Is that dependent on MCPs?

Shoutout to the Priest that hinted at me how incredibly useful Mind Soothe is. I mean I'm someone who uses every shit he has and I certainly used Mind Soothe before when I saw it fit but I never knew just how big the aggro radius reduce really is. You can skip so much shit by just Mind Soothing everything.
---
My guild does reserve runs for people.  Wondering if I'll get help lol.
---
UBRS trash is serious business!
---
Quality post
---
You know what sounds more boring? Having to wait on the mana users as a non-mana user.
---
Grinding full pre-BiS is certainly valuable and definitely worth your time, however I've found much of the game is lost in the process. If you're not a top percenter you can easily survive paying less attention to it.
---
On my Hunter I'll be getting the pieces I come across for sure, but after Devilsaur I won't be drooling over pre-BiS stuff all day. I'll become a Dragonscale LW and grind out the Black Dragonscale Recipes because they're cool. After those, I'll get t0 and call it a day. With that gear I won't be at the top, but that's not my goal.
---
you dont remember what vanilla was ,clearly
---
You should give it a shot! Check the LFG channel and whisper those in need of a tank.  I usually say something like “hey if you can’t find a tank I’d be happy to run it for green drops or runecloth drops”. Most people will keep looking, but eventually hit you up when no one else bites.
---
BRD runs are the most profitable, especially if you already have the hot items like HOJ. So many green drops and runecloth.  Ask for the greens and you will make about 25 per run, and I can usually clear a full run in an hour. Or join the Arena/Anger runs with the same deal but maybe try to grab the blues no one needs or wants, which can go between 2-4g per blue. That’s like 10g per run and they only take like 20 minutes max. So let them know you will take the blue drops no one wants as payment, most don’t care.
---
Haha good point. None of this matters if he hasn’t trained Growl.
---
why are you crying in hunter when hunters can solo farm like gods and make fuckin bank
---
No image?
---
There was a post yesterday talking about dungeons. The top comment was a guy complaining about groups that invite people who are a little lower level than the rest of the group.
---
U didnt upload an image
---
Not that easy yet a dozen frenchmen somehow figured it out... there are zero excuses.
---
spell crits only do 50% more damage, not 100%.
---
What if it was just one Hunter with six guns?
---
Yeah so imagine the voracity with which people attack you in STV, except that's basically anywhere you someone now.

This is serious for anyone asking
---
I've had someone print out an error message, hand that to another person, who then takes a photo of that print out with their camera phone and sends us that photo of a print out of an error message.
---
It's not disrespectful.
---
I'm agreeing with you in that if I had kept pugging, I would have burnt out too.  
---
But because I found a solid guild with players who I trust know what their doing, I can tank more relaxed, at my own pace (which they let me cause I'm the only damn tank in the guild).
---
from the research i have done it is only very few specific weapon procs, outliers rather than the rule.
---
Instant BG ques. I’m down wit it
---
That's why I put in the part about assuming the talent that raises it to 100%. Anyone tossing frostbolts in MC would have to be incredibly ignorant to not have it.
---
Not everyone is at the same level of progress. My guild started clearing MC on week 2 but that doesn't mean everyone else did.
---
Also, some dps items are BiS for tanks and sometimes items they need don't drop. (shocking!)
---
I thought it was a paint brush painting a metal thing yellowish green.
---
Because that’s not the case when leveling...? We have to spend a ton of money on pet food, water and arrows
---
Unlikely that they will open any new servers in the next few months.
---
I saw HOJ drop 3 time in a row and ended up rolling need on it for Offspec (I'm resto shaman)
---
Always saw a swinging axe... until today.
---
This is the way to finish it: Have only one person drop the bag, then have that person stay at the bag the entire time, just stay put. Everyone else can protect the npc’s.   
---
If the person who drops the bag moves away from it, it bugs out.
---
If you place more than one bag, it can big out too.
---
Forsure warriors are a great class, dont get me wrong. Mages just have such a good kit. 
---
and honestly warriors kind of suck in PvP unless they have a healbot / dispeller or are chugging free actions pots
---
Or any caster in general. Or a hunter.
---
This is the first one i hadn't seen before of the ones posted recently (although i kinda prefer to think of it as the iron parrot)
---
Part of the reason we never saw feral players in Vanilla was because of the talent trees. Until AQ innervate was the 31st talent point in Resto.  DPS was considerably lower because we didn’t know what we were doing, didn’t itemize as well as we do now, didn’t have the end state item changes we have now (giving us more raw stats), and didn’t have 1.12 talent trees.
---
When every boss in MC falls down in sub 1 minute mana isn’t an issue at all and innervates aren’t as needed as they once were. And they’re baseline for Druids so it doesn’t matter anyway. Paladins are beasts now that Holy Shock is more than just an offensive spell, so healing doesn’t fall squarely on the backs on priests like it did in Vanilla.
---
Add all of that together and you get viability for feral Druids! They’re not great main tanks, but they will remain viable through Naxx and are amazing in fights like Twin Emps (in AQ40) and Patchwerk (in Naxx)
---
Really? Don’t know if it is the time I play or what. But never felt we were that outrageously outnumbered. Yes horde is definitely the majority. But not so bad that you couldn’t get some alliance down to help push back.
---
100% works on unit frames. Clique wasn't working for me early on in classic so I made a mouseover macro
---
Maybe a noob question..... but how do you have spaces in your name?
---
Do you have succubus? Great time to practice seducing , doing damage with shadowbolt/searing pain , and reseducing
---
Same.  Always thought it was a claw.
---
He's so enthusiastically..... begging?
---
(If you're not trolling I'm going to call you painfully naive)
---
Lol, what? Would it also be “pretty BM” to roll on items you need to level once before equipping? I understand the stance that everyone can roll need because it’s money, but in what world do you need a recipe less just because you can’t consume it on the spot?
---
[Wow looks like I was wrong!  Look at all these top 10 dps hunters in the top speedrun guilds I guess I forgot about!](https://imgur.com/a/KjkbalB)
---
Probaby, but would be slow enough to not be worth it.
---
Bear threat is strong baseline and MCP allows it to go to infinity basically.  Or at least as high as you need it. Dps can go balls deep if the Druid goes full MCP. 
---
In general you don’t need to use MCP every fight as a bear, whereas with Cat if you want to boost those numbers it’s MCP 24/7 on bosses.
---
Possibly coords with no decimal? CL = Current Location? No idea dude sorry
---
Did you make those boots yourself? They’re awesome

Isnt it the other way around?

---
Spriest is even easier as you can mind soothe and just walk around the right side straight to the bugs avoiding all the hyenas
---
no, sadly disengage is just a threat lowering ability, no backward leap.
---
I used to love this skill in WOTLK because with good timing and mouse control (easy to learn), that is also a great forward jump.
---
Also it saves you from high falls if activated at the last moment :)
---
I would like to use eviscerate but alas....
---
If you just killing some mobs yeah but mages usually like to flex their aoe skills and use 15 spells at the same time
---
56 Warlock here. PVP server. In a sizable guild.
---
I have 300 tailoring. I was intending on doing 300 Enchanting but it's such a bore/drag. Would it save me money if I switch to Alchemy and buy raw mats off the auction house? Just being able to make pots for PVP and raiding seems like I'd save a little money compared to buying the pots outright.
---
Was running a few instances today as a healer but I'm shadow spec so was feeling the mana burn.  Suppose it keeps me on my toes though. So... 
---
Thanks hunters?
---
Yea i did this a few days ago and it was really easy we even ran on  few eggs for the lulz
---
I did that when classic came out, and throughout stockades I can't it was extremely fast, but i can say that exp was around 70exp per mob, so it wasn't that amazing but from my experience as a mage getting to 60 doing aoe farming is that id still prefer 3 mages in a 5man than 10man, felt faster, and i personally thought it was better exp.
---
That’s the spirit, keep workin at it

I’m trying to see it but I can’t... all I see is an axe.

It's a World of Warcraft subreddit, what mind-throttling levels of humor were you actually expecting?
---
Please enlighten us with your data on casual vs hardcore player numbers... Oh wait nvm you're completely pulling this out of your ass with zero factual basis
---
Lapdogs all of you!
---
True lol
---
Yes, until locks get better gear and stam. Right now with a couple pieces of t1 I’m at 3.4k health. In t3 and world buffs locks can get to over 9k easily. 7k+ is too much to burst and stunlock through.
---
Leader of the pack? you have a feral druid with you?
---
I only use Curse of tongues for healers or summoners, the extra time to kick those abilities is worth the loss of damage. I don't think weakness is ever worthwhile.
---
Time, time, time, and more time.
---
They put in way, way more time than you do.
---
Way more. Per player, and over the spectrum of their guild, way, way more time.
---
Skill only accounts for so much in this game. In fact for the most part the game is not that hard overall even at endgame.
---
The deeper truth is it's a time crunch.
---
A guy in full T1 has played a lot and probably gotten solid quick runs under his belt.
---
A person with 3 60s in T1 has been playing way more than the average person would find acceptable in order to achieve that goal.
---
If you put that much time into learning an instrument or some other skill youd see the same sort of results simply by throwing so many literal hours and days of time at the hobby.
---
A token druid for MotW is worth it regardless of performance.
---
Devilsaur mafia is why
---
Classic is partially a museum, however imperfect, and the time period post-honor but pre-BGs is a unique phase that people should have an opportunity to try out. 
---
Granted I don't think it's a phase that should last very long, and they should probably throw in a BG before p3.
---
The blessing spam should of been fine for agro he was either lying or he chose the wrong class to buff. My guess is he was lying about the blessing spam.

It's the Total Roleplay 3 addon for classic. Let's you show a more "in character" name to other people with the addon.

Ah gotcha, thanks for the info.

Thought I was the only one who did this.
---
I have a guildie who legit ran 353 runs for his HoJ. I was there for a bunch of them and he had an addon tracking them. He did lose a couple rolls along the way though.
---
Lol yes every pvp server has overwhelming odds.  Kept using that as your excuse.
---
I can't remember about in vanilla but when I tested distracting shot in TBC it did the same if not less threat than damaging abilities(including autoshot), minus the damage component...
---
I never used it kiting the beast or kiting all of the dragonkins on razorgore either.
---
that layer lit af
---
Serathil OH, BSH OH, Rivenspike MH, even Iceblade Hacker is pretty solid main hand despite the attack speed.

Being able to use devilsaur and maintain weapon skill is massive.

Sorry my lord, I shall bow more often to you saltiness

I was able to get these guys to not aggro me and loot this bad boy a while back.

They lagged significantly less than official blizzard classic wow in large scale battles, yes.
---
No one is claiming that it was seamless.

Encapsulates this sub: oversensitive and ultra casual.

I mean the first druid healer is likely going to do very well on healing meters.

damn after all these years

RBG's went from 1.1k-2.4k for rankings when I participated back then. You also started out at zero.
---
Bloodsail Buccaneers is a RP server so I'm running Total RP 3: Classic.  You can change your name and anyone with the Mod can see it.  It also copies names of people around you so when you see them in the world via Trade channel, guild channel, etc.. the name also changes.
---
Had someone schedule an ony buff? We had a few guilds packed in SW on the weekend because someone had announced a buff coming on the realm discord.
---
Will feral the actor?
---
Hmm yeah I don't know of any efficient way of looking it up. I know some engineering stuff (grenades, death ray) require human form. While others (shrink ray, net-o-matic) do not. A common thread is if interacting creates a cast bar (mining, crafting, casting come to mind), you need to be in human form.
---
Lol he didn’t even know what it was he just saw it had more agi then his chest piece
---
I just use ElvUI with the BenikUI Mod. It's pretty minimal looking. IU'll get you a screen of my UI when I get home.
---
A lot of your ui clutter could be solved with necrosis
---
Honestly I bring food/bandages to dungeons I'd rather healers just let me do my thing if there gonna bitch about my lifetapping. Locks are honestly mostly self healing unless we're aoeing.
---
Well now they can see what I've been yelling about for the past week lol.
---
Hehe...for what it’s worth, as far as it could be correlated anyway, Hunter’s definitely bring a hefty dose of ADD to table it seems
---
&gt; hunter
---
As horde player, rogue and dps war easily dps out hunter if melee group get buffed Windfury totem by shaman.
---
Hunter in high position in the damage meter is probably true as alliance player, but not as horde.
---
Basically this is how it goes:
---
GBoK generate a base 60 threat per target per cast.
---
With RF up it's 60 x 1.9 = 114 threat per cast per target
---
Let's say there are 7 mages in the raid, with mages being a popular class that is entirely possible.
---
You cast GBoK on those 7 mages, then you get 114 x 7 = 798 threat per cast for only 150 mana.
---
If you have more of the same class, then even more threat.
---
Compare that to other threat generation spells. It's mana efficient and generates an obscene amount of threat.
---
A blue post also said the GBoK was not a bug.
---
I'm interested in your statement on tanking up to Naxx. What are your itemization? Do you have enough damage mitigation? What abilities do you use? What's your talent build? I'm very interested.
---
someone wanna tell him or should i
---
Not really.  In our guild groups, tank has first interrupt.  Pretty simple.  Nothing in Classic is so punishing that letting a cast get through will spell a wipe.  Even most raids it's not that big of a deal until like AQ40.
---
Cool thanks. I've never played on a RP server so had no idea addons like that even existed.
---
I think these two commonly get the mention because of the level ranges they occupy and just how many runs most people do of these in particular. I ground out a LOT in SM, and did a fair share of BRD, which is the first taste of what end-game can be like. Just the SCALE of BRD kinda makes you go "woah, this is a WORLD" 
---
I will say I think Maraudon is quite iconic, but other than a few runs to get all the quests done I didn't spend much more time there. Maraudon has a lot of beauty.
---
Now as far as dungeons I hate: Uldaman. Shadow Fang Keep is commonly reported to be super troublesome for some, as well, which is why many don't like it. Razor Fen Downs is another that few players run more than once or twice.
---
Using growl in dungeons can be useful if a healer pulls aggro because the tank misses. You can grab the mob and then tell your pet to attack the priority target to drag it back to the tank. If I'm not in a dungeon, growl is always on.
---
It actually is but ok.
---
I swear either scholo or strat could be 10 manned, did they change it to 5 only for classic wow?
---
I switched to seal fate daggers just this week, because I'm hitting 30-34% crit when buffed for raids. Went in worried my dps would take a hit but I ended up top damage in ONY and Rag. Honestly it is a lot more fun than combat was for me and is better in PvP so I'm loving it so far.
---
Grobb
---
Doesn't cover when they miss either.
---
Feral does everything that Balance can do, but better. Feral:
---
* Can fill an essential role (tank)
---
* Needs gear that most classes do not want (few Feral items overlap with Warriors/Rogues)
---
* Does not use mana. This allows them to save their Innervate for healers, and also keep some mana in the tank for off-heals if necessary.
---
In PvP, Ferals can pick up both Feral Charge and Nature's Swiftness, which are easily the two best Druid abilities in a PvP setting. Balance has to choose one or the other.
---
The *Holy Grail* reference is on point.
---
Given that it was a 25 man group, probably there weren't enough people of the same classes all around.
---
I was tossing up whether to commit to feral tank/dps but no way I'm farming MCPs. So I've resigned myself to healing
---
Biggest cost is the loss of quest progress since it's a raid group, unless that's what you're referring to by xp.
---
Or a battle shout when you are the warrior tank with 2 DPS warriors with improved battle shout
---
SMH that’s the worst kind of person. That’s like the mage in my SM lib group who needed on the staff off houndmaster with +attack power vs beasts because it was blue and did more damage than his staff lmao
---
What if people enjoy the default UI, why can't you just let people enjoy what they enjoy?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
/s
---
that reminds me, i got a tree bark jacket banked, for sale on rattlegore
---
I have almost 700 healing and in vanilla we cleared MC before any of this crazy gear was in the game. You do not need to cookie cutter for a 10% healing until we get Naxx or something.
---
This is great advice but for me personally, it's so hard to follow. I want to level quickly and be time efficient but know I'll be burned out. Made it to lv43 over several weeks and then stopped playing for a month because of the foreseen burn out.
---
Now I'm starting over because I want to take my time--genuinely take my time. I want to conciously think about enjoying the ride, not the destination. I want to chat with people, do professions, and have fun.
---
SRSLY mind soothe for me is key bound.
---
How can priest not abuse the fuck out of this spell?
---
You want to calculate it not for current gear and frost spec, you want to calculate it for fire spec mages in BWL / AQ40 gear since that's when it will really matter, rolling ignites are when high crit is important. Even then you're still better having another mage or lock or rogue or fury warrior than having a boomkin.
---
Are there any zones that have quests locked by other quests? Like “deliver this message to X” and that unlocks quests that would otherwise not show up? I remember this being a thing but finding them is harder than I remember.
---
You could try an item restore? Might be worth it for 40g.
---
Ffs literally data disproves your claim. Wow engine doesn’t scale well in this way during pvp. It performed much better being run on dedicated hardware.
---
Theoretically what’s possible and real world results are not at all congruent.
---
You're awesome.
---
31/5/15 is fine
---
Not if the guy bought out the market then listed for double the normal market price in the first place, which is almost certainly what happened here. The people that get angry when they get undercut are the ones that invested significantly in this "strategy" of theirs, only to have it undone by someone who knows the normal value of the item.
---
Thank you for your duty, sorry we make it difficult, albeit hilarious sometimes.
---
Amplify magic increases healing taken but also increases magic dmg taken. However if the enemy does no magic dmg then all it does is increases healing.
---
I've been bamboozled
---
I’m not gonna badger you like some people in this thread about “that’s too much stuff on your screen”. You pay your money so play the game however you want.
---
You sound like someone who just took their first French class
---
use the hide button?
---
Oh hey its that ability i have on my warrior ive used three times
---
Pick a wiki. Throw out a search. "Wow classic hit"
---
Here's the first result if you can't be bothered.  
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Hit
---
Intercept can be used as an interrupt as well.
---
first things first pop reck huh? what shit
---
&gt; is there an enchanter that teaches 225+ enchants,
---
No, there's not.  
---
Every 225+ trainer for every profession is only one NPC per faction.
---
They go for 20-40s per on mine, heh.
---
People have tried to artificially raise to 1g per many times, but no one buys em and they're back down to silvers in hours.
---
If it hinders your leveling significantly and you feel like you have a decent understanding of how to use your talent points now go ahead and respec. But if you are not entirely sure about where to place talents yet you are probably better off saving that gold because eespeccing gets more expensive every time you do it.
---
Dot dot wand is definitely an oversimplification of a mana conservative leveling technique Locks use. I assume you leveled Drain Tank...which while I’ll admit isn’t the most fun way, it is more than dot dot wand. 
---
Fear juggling is a much more fun way to handle mobs, it uses way more mana but is much more fun. 
---
You failed to mention the amount of downtime Mages have while leveling due to being oom and drinking. Warlock do not have this issue.
---
Ham is more typically associated with Christmas in my experience
---
Thank you!
---
So you have another way to level up besides grinding at 40+
---
Some people say 55+.
---
I swapped at 52 and didnt feel like it hurt to do it 3 levels earlier.
---
I primarily did dungeons from 52-60 though. If you plan to solo any part of the way I'd say 55+ is reasonable.
---
I have a new rule. 
---
I don’t tank for other warriors unless everything I want is reserved. 
---
I’m a DPS main that’s tanking, why should they have the fun at my expense? 🤷‍♂️
---
&gt; assigned to farm materials to help the established raiders
---
fuck that shit lmao, i'm in one of the top guilds in the world and we all farm our own shit
---
nty
---
If you're building for a pure aoe set which you will not be using anywhere else then stamina/hp on everything and spellpower on the weapon. Strength/agility don't do much for you so don't even look at them. We don't have many options in terms of enchants right now, so slap some cheap stamina enchants, get +8 spellpower on your T2 kettle and skirt (if you have them) and you're good. Just a small reminder - +7 stamina on shield and spike are mutually exclusive, and we want to keep the spike.
---
Oh no, it's only rage thats the problem. The threat output in deep prot is ridiculous.
---
Benediction is pretty balanced. I'm horde side and it feels like it's ever so slightly ally favored
---
Me: waiting for the healer to get a decent amount of mana before we pull the next group of mobs. Jumping around the healer to let the group know I’m not afk and I’m waiting for mana
---
Mage: types “sorry getting tired” and casts frostbolt on the next group of mobs
---
This is wrong at minimum on the crit part.  I promise you both your CL and ES will autocrit.
---
Well obviously hes begging for his main
---
In that group you're basically a walking totem for the warriors who do all the damage. Doesn't really matter what spec you choose as long as you keep that WF up the warriors will be doing way more damage than your personal contribution
---
On the other hand, I should get back to reading the wheel of time. I don't even remember what book I am on. 12 or 14 maybe I think lol.
---
Exactly. There is no down time as a lock. Like there is downtime on a mage. You have you suc out. Dot dot and want. Using fear is cool but it pulls other mobs. Warlocks are only fun in PvP but it's not so much they are fun but strong. Its dot,dots run around. I leveled a warlocks already and I found it boring. And my main is a ret paly.  If fearing dotting is fun then warlocks for you.  My rotations are simply efficient. 
---
Mages just offer more when it comes to fun. Your more engaged in every fight. I'm level 23 on my mage and I'm having more fun on a mage then a warlock. I've leveled both that's why I say a mage is more fun. With phase 2 comming up holy shit I'm going to have a blast leveling this mage. I won't even log onto my lock or ret paly till phase 3 because I'm having that much fun on a mage.
---
Proof of those numbers or you're just another person wildly exaggerating their experience, which with that mentality of course it's going to seem like a drag.
---
Wow, reading this was like pulling boilerplate, unimaginative, funny-for-2006 teeth.
---
Finish all 55+ quests. They now give gold at the rate exp*6 bronze coins.  
---
So normal 4k quest now would net you additional 2.4 gold.  
---
That's 200-300 gold from just WPL+EPL alone.
---
Exactly.
---
I don’t get it. It’s all about maximum aggro generation with just barely enough survival to get over the line.
---
Healers will keep you up easily since your raid dps is much higher and total time of fight is much lower.
---
No reason pally tank or bear tank can’t do it. (Just, not as well.)
---
You can do Alt + PrtScn it will capture the active window only.
---
As a warrior tank I can say that 80% of the time it's  the huntards fault. No class pulls more crap in dungeons than them. The other 20% is when the huntards pet aggros.
---
diff metas at diff brackets
---
The chance to proc isnt increased by having two on?
---
Decent offhand for leveling rogues but it's nothing crazy. The proc is super underwhelming and 1.3 speed is too fast for a main hand.
---
You use water as a hunter while leveling?  Just level as BM and use auto shot and multi shot.  
---
My hunter alt is 53 and there's almost 0 downtime while still killing quickly.
---
100%
---
It's not even really 10% healing.  Purification only affects the base heal so with good gear it's less than a 5% increase to your total healing.
---
This was the one thing Blizzard should have focused on for the release of Classic.  Not integrating it with Battle.net or overwriting Legion client, making a Vanilla client that supported world PvP even better than Vanilla did.
---
you can also add in race to /who to get more granular. If you had a few people running whos and combine the data-sets you could pretty easily get a decent count (like the pop websites do)
---
Yes, back when noone knew where to find Mankrik's wife...
---
People know twinks exist now. Also, the vast majority of players have some kind of goal-oriented playstyle now, so do you honestly believe we are going to see many new level 10 priests entering BGs, just to see what all the fuss is about? Please.
---
Did that in loobers the other day. I felt so fucking bad about it, but at least the two mages saved the day with the sheeps.
---
I think it's wrong to assume full buffs though. Raid content is easy enough that most people won't bother shelling out 25-50g for consumables or taking the time to get the DM buff. Yes, with full buffs, I am sure a dps war will come out on top of a similarly geared hunter but reality is that people aren't going to invest money/time to prep for a raid just to get a small chance of rolling on an item that might not even be T1 BIS.
---
Really now, I'd heard otherwise.
---
I add you when possible. 
---
-Jaé
---
Not a warrior. ;)
---
World of Warcrafts storyline ended with Wrath.
---
Everything after has been bad fanfiction.
---
Which is why I quit the game after hitting max level in Cataclysm.
---
IMO Wrath was the end of the Warcraft story. The Burning Legion never again tried to invade after the events of Warcraft 3 and Burning Crusade.
---
Arthas was the last true enemy and was defeated.
---
I noticed this happened often on my laptop, but not my desktop. *shrug*
---
  
---
I found a macro for “spammable stealth” for my Q keybind, but I use a different macro (ranged attack) for canceling stealth. This essentially eliminates the problem because I no longer rely on Q to unstealth.
---
Tunderclap generate low threat. Also since you in the battle stance - it only generate 80% of low threat.  
---
Battle Shout will generate more AoE threat without risking of breaking CC effects than Thunderclap.
---
No, but they performed just as well as Vanilla did back in the day, maybe a bit better.  Classic performs worse if anything.
---
actually if you parse it, compare the "standard" BiS list to the 6/2 setup you will see an over 100 dps difference. Which is not an insignificant amount at all at that stage...
---
The lists serve a purpose, you are right, shouldn't say they are trash.
---
But they should all show alternatives, or people should understand stat rankings if they want to maximize. Blindly following a list and thinking you are going to be good isn't going to do it. You are going to be subpar-average and as a whole the rogue community suffers for it.
---
Look back 15 yrs, the word "huntard" was thrown around b/c of players like this. I would rather not see our community follow suit with the same kind of reputation.
---
Really depends on your class. Some classes scale better with gear than others. For example Hunters or Feral Druids will be like 150% with full prebis, while rogues or fury warriors will be like 200%.
---
Phantom blade is a nice crafted boe if it's worth the gold to you. After that thrash blade from the mara quest to kill the princess.
---
opening a chest that close to mobs will aggro them no matter the level of the player/mobs
---
The lowest rank of Renew you should be using is 3.  Any rank of a spell you learn before 20 doesn't benefit fully from your spellpower.
---
Jintha'Alor and associated quests should be like half a level
---
I don't think it matters lol, the majority of classes in classic have veeerrrryy simple rotations.
---
Don't get me wrong, I love classic, and that's not a turn off for me personally, but if you're someone who enjoys class complexity, Classic is just not a very fun game haha.
---
I saw the dwarf for a second then my brain slipped back into only seeing the facepalm Picard with shiny bald spot...
---
This is exactly the kind of add-on I've been looking for, thank you.
---
Sometimes it takes a while to find a group so I quest while keeping my eye on chat, sometimes I miss things.
---
Thanks!
---
green parrot, sideways, iron helmet - you can even see the eye
---
FOR THE HIVE!
---
What are your objectives in WOW?
---
You over exaggerate so much get a grip man. You sound like a 10 year old having a fit. You don’t get camped every second you play. Nobody cares about you that much. If you have a mental breakdown every time something in the open world doesn’t go your way then just quit because you won’t have any fun.
---
I had a moment like this in retail as a hunter.  
---
We were in gadgetzan at that pit that has a platform connected by bridge at the bottom.  We jumped into the pit to skip all the mobs, and upon landing I realized I hadn’t dismissed my pet, who was now running all the way around the pit to get to us.  
---
It pulled every single mob on its way down.  The party realized, called me a dumbass, and gathered on the bridge to get ready for the fight.  My pet, a smug looking turtle, got to me and then promptly died.
---
I didn’t make it past the 1st wave, but my party managed to kill every single mob.  It would’ve been badass if it hadn’t been my fault
---
nothing wrong with the dps... it can be much better with a 2h but this is way more fun.
---
I was prepared that meta scientist people would get mad about this, but i dont really care about your theorycrafting, it even says in the original post its not about that.
---
Blue pvp gear isnt until phase 5 or 6 iirc
---
I always thought Medium Leather looked like a fish face.
---
Ehh it's really not as unbalanced as people say.  I mean, it's kind of unbalanced when you're talking about 1v1 dueling or arena type scenarios, but that's not all pvp is about.  In fact, hyper focusing on balancing arena style play I think made the game less fun.
---
I am **\*so glad\*** that I'm no the only one who thought this for the longest time! I think it was Legion when I finally figured out what it actually was!
---
I found that Desolace was relatively calm on Herod during that range.
---
yeah no worries.  enjoy UBRS
---
are you sure it's just not the boot enchant that doesn't stack?
---
it's the streamer server so be wary of that
---
Even if for some reason you wanted Int/Stam/Spirit, Felheart Bracers have the exact same stats as Sublime wristguards, but higher numbers.
---
cheetah
---
It’s cause you are wearing green tinted goggles instead of lucky fishing hat you casual. Lol all jokes aside it’s very creative I love it :D
---
Comparing old, rich country club players with recluse, socially stunted MMO grinders.... not really an apt comparison.
---
Ah ok, I've got a bit of levelling to do before then.
---
3 months between phases isn't rushing really
---
As a healer I never complain about a druid in the party.
---
for PVP no, but for raids yes.
---
yea dont rush in phase 2 with wpvp gangin, there will be at least alterac or both av wsg before phase 3, same as they did DM, there you go fast as healer : )
---
only when i try to report a player
---
anti-snitch feature
---
classic.
---
Wow, never realized this until today (15 years later)!
---
It's hard to say, I don't think there's any chain guide or anything like that.
---
But if you use WoWhead and search up a quests for a zone, you'll find all the information you need.
---
In your case, at level 42 somewhere like Ferelas would be a good zone to level, so I'd check the quests available there:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/feralas#quests
---
From the list you can see all the available quests, and if you find a certain item/reward that you like, then click on that quest and you'll see the quest is either part of a "Series" or "Unlocks" a new chain. 
---
For a "Series" example if you look at the Alliance quest "Delivering the Relic", you'll see that it's part of a 4 series quest where you need to complete three quests in order before you can access it (1.Against the Hatecrest, 2. Against the Hatecrest, 3. Against Lord Shalzaru, 4.Delivering the Relic).
---
An example of the "Unlock" is the "The Mark of Quality" quest available for Alliance, if you open the quest you'll see that completing it "Unlocks" a new quest chain for "Improved Quality".
---
Lol at the rogues comment
---
Back in vanilla high ranks were dominated by organized teams of players that basically always played - namely, the warriors and their healers.
---
Avoid going there on Wednesday.
---
scatter
---
If you are mainly a tank then you don’t need to farm so many MCP and you don’t need to be a dps hero using them when it’s time to dps since you are coming as a tank. 
---
The really cool thing about Druid is that you can do it all in good time. Start out with healing and get comfortable. Then as time goes on pickup feral pieces. Then when you have time and experience see if your guild will let you try feral.
---
I agree pvp in 60 zones will be crazy, although I specifically pointed out those since they are lower level. Generally its significantly easier to gear a lower level twink-alt with crazy advantages over newer/lower players going about their day prepping against other 60's stacked with consumables and raid gear waiting in a bush with the intent to kill you. 
---
thus i feel like the 1 percent of people who are gunna go absolutely nuts for the elusive rank 14 are going to be taking the easiest route to get the most kills because of how the honor system does ranks. But, eventually the vast majority of that race will die off when they realize that they just dont have the time to keep up after seeing that one guy literally playing 24hrs/day just to put themselves ahead far enough to take a nap without losing 1st place.
---
my point is that yes the higher level zones are gunna be hot, and maybe even hotter. but it will more often than not be tense/expensive combat vs stv/hb's "easy" pickings.
---
You don’t know that for sure though.
---
I think the obsession with BIS gear comes from the fact that the *other* part of raid prep is actually really hard for a lot of people -- you have to be social.  So they focus on the part they can control.
---
I think the happy medium is like a half-twink. Put in some decent effort to get the best gear and toss a few gold to support one of Orgrimmar's little mom and pop enchanter's stores, you can put up a fight against the real twinks but you're not some unbeatable god.
---
like a year ago. and no it just started happening today.
---
I am that hunter
---
#NoChanges amirightguise
---
Jack of the trades should be the most valuable class for raiding!Instead ppl only look at metters instead utility
---
Ah ok
---
u/ramlol is that you?
---
Welcome! I was completely new too. What did you do?? :D
---
I believe that’s 0.0000000001%
---
I’m starting to get a real bad taste in mouth for mages.
---
You cant do damage if you dont hit the target.
---
Sad times.
---
You never played on private servers since vanilla have you? Times changed
---
this happens a lot past this certain level, since most zones 30+ are contested areas. Use this time to save up some rested exp. and use it to grind mobs in a less populated area, and farm some gold for that 40 mount. You can also just look for some SM groups and try dungeon leveling
---
thank you
---
Mages who decurse nasty curses from the tank/group without having to be asked.
---
Who am I kidding this kind of mage doesn’t exist.
---
locks are kinda boring to level - but are fast levelers. You get a free 40 mount, and about a 400g discount on epic mount (can get it to 400g to get ur mount if you can find another lock with the items). They are amazing in pvp if you learn the class, and are top dps late game raiding wise. 
---
Mages give you aoe farming which is a very lucrative way to make money and to level. They also eat most melee classes in pvp and are great raid dps early game and late game. You will however be treated as a vending machine 100% of the time you are playing.
---
That just means you're not that good in pvp...
---
Auction faster is good for this
---
that's where blizzard hid the Ashbringer...
---
Sounds like someone got flared and then stomped by a big red npc lmao
---
The spelldmg you recieve from.crit is depending a lot on hitrating. You cant crit if you dont even hit your enemy. This makes hit much more valuable then any other stat, especially for wl as they cant get hit with talents. You want to get 16% hit as a spell caster for raidencounters
---
I know this isn’t exactly what you are looking for, but maybe it helps. It’s touch to find specific stat weighting info.
---

I have a hard time seeing the parrot even when I try to.
---
Im lvl 55 with herb 300 / alch 250 and I feel I'm losing money with my professions ;_;
---
For real. I had a warlock do it again the next run. I’m pretty sure they just did it for their vendor spec
---
I am looking for a video for you dude.. Cant seem to find it :( In this video, think a coalition with dreamstate in it fought hordes at one of the world dragons. Atleast 100-150 players and people where still able to aim/cast blizzards and the like. Might not have been seamlessly but it sure as heck is better then what blizz is putting out.
---
I've found calling people 'child' has managed to really piss people off in Classic. Either literally asking "are you a child?", or something like "what are you, 11? Do you have permission to play this late?", seems to get a hearty response.
---
I tried, it didn’t show up :/
---
caveat is that this applies really only to horde locks. WOTF is on a short cooldown and makes UD immune to succy charm/fears. Come PVP trinket, you'll have to deal with melee having that to break your CC, also.
---
Countless of times I’ve stepped into other roles. Tanking pat mobs with only my own HoTs and barkskin etc. . Topping up the tank and dps whenever a pull drags out past healers mana. Not to mention when I am the dedicated tank and heal isn’t keeping up- quick NS/stomp/regrowth, rejuvenate &amp; innervate the healer. Back at it. 
---
People talk about the “diversity” of druids but I feel like the ACTUAL practice we do goes majorly unnoticed.. ;)
---
My finest moment was when a priest stopped the party and made it very clear to everyone, that we would have wiped countless of times if it wasn’t for my heals and tank support. Felt very good- thanks mate &lt;3
---
You cast both searing pain and shadowburn when the mob almost dead obviously. If you stand at Max range for shadowbolt and cast sp immediately after and they will hit at the same time. The threat on sp is completely irrelevant when using it at the end of the mobs health. This is all for a dps gain, while being small adds more depth to the class. You'll also being using searing pain and shadowburn more often in later raids when you have to burst adds down quickly and there isn't enough time for a shadowbolt to land.
---
This class isn't mindless shadowbolt spam for good players sorry.
---
Dont listen to this guy, he has no idea what hes talking about and leveled his lock completely wrong. 
---
Drain tanking is available to locks as early as lvl40 and is nearly 100% uptime on mobs with insane single target damage, varying cooldown usage and rotation that changes based on gear and situation, and no drinking required.
---
Mages' most efficient single target leveling is literally frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, then drink.
---

---
In early vanilla days, I definitely remember 10 manning scholo and 15 man UBRS. No idea at what patch but I was a pretty early 60.
---
What are you missing in the story?
---
Haha, thanks for showing how you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. Cute how you waited all day after I debunked your nonsense to comment with cherrypicked data in a shitty attempt to try to redeem yourself, but unfortunately couldn't produce more than a garbage comment.
---
 Next to the obvious fact that you're coming with very specific scenarios in which non-existent buffs for hunter are given to the warrs and rogue under the pretense of a specific speedrun scenario, already showcasing your faulty line of thinking.
---
Yikes, so let's look at actual representative data:
---
[APES last raid
---
](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/f8wjGmPY2J1CrWKz#boss=-2&amp;difficulty=0&amp;wipes=2)
---
Oh look, hunters topping the charts.
---
ONSLAUGHT
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/HN13PdvxcbWtJgwy#boss=-2&amp;difficulty=0&amp;wipes=2
---
Oh look, hunters topping the charts
---
And so forth, and so forth.
---
These are the normal raids with fast excecutions, not the ones wehre melee dps gets catered to the point where it will do the highest damage lol. Embarrassing dude.
---
Wow you're actually doubling down on your delusions.  Imagine accusing someone else of cherrypicking data when you're using the ALT RAID of Apes, which is 4th on the speed list and Onslaught which is 14th on the list while ignoring every other guild that performed better than them to "prove" your point.
---
Once you get shadowburn it's fine, just remember to drain soul at the end.
---
Mark of the Wild alone is a great thing to have
---
Why stop there?
---
Probably not the right forum for this type of issue.
---
Typically, this type of behavior is your pc trying to protect itself from damage. 
---
(Eg: before overheating)
---
If it was just WoW, the game would crash...likely not the whole system.
---
Happens with other games too?
---
Do your pc specs meet the min requirements?
---
*any DPS spec. 
---
Let's be honest...ret doesn't count.
---
Sounds not bad think i was 37-40 gold or so at 35 , don’t go ah buying stuff , ignore skills apart from most used , loot and sell everything i vendored most except good green boe and any blue boe . I had skinning/herbing got my mount about 25% towards 41 , should be on pace if your wise with your gold from now on , not a problem if u dont have it bang on 40 but 41 would be nice for you i think
---
These are the kinds of rabbit holes I live for! Thanks!
---
i was a rogue and had over 400 at that level. didnt even do anything crazy to farm, just didnt spend much, and quested mostly to level
---
i'm baffled how some people talk shit about feral tank.
---
Oomkin, retpala or others, i understand, but "feral tank are bad" just stand on absolutely NOTHING. They ARE f\*\*\*\* great, unbiasedly and objectively.
---
Fail. Nice cherrypicked data again. Your first link can't even be taken serious, specific melee dps catered raids where hunters get diminished due to SoP. Yikes.
---
Your second link is already nonsensical as we can see here, [ the actual normalized scores.](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/statistics/1000#metric=dps&amp;dataset=95&amp;class=DPS)
---
Nice option cherry-picking to try to entertain your bias.
---
Hunter will outperform rogue and warrior in many, many cases and even with the absolute highest dps included (specific melee dps catered scenarios) will still be closed behind warrior and rogue. Hunter tops the charts, as everybody is saying in this thread, in many many raids for a reason.
---
Let’s be real now. This is literally not the reason why anyone twinks. They do it because they’re bored or have nothing else to do. Gearing out a twink can cost hundreds to thousands of gold. You have to have an established max level toon to do it really.
---
Thats a fair thing to say.
---
Hahaha! I was torn on which to wear, but I felt the goggles had the more "iconic" twink look. If this was in game, trusttt I would twink the right way :)
---
I’m not super informed about these sorts of things why is it bad to COoD? They aren’t able to like somehow not pay I would think
---
Object rendering is not server side. Never has been.
---
Druid turns into some fat fuck chicken nobody likes. Ok Boomie
---
It's not about big numbers. I was like you, I wanted to go Fury. Once I went Arms and felt how fast I killed things with Sweeping Strikes there was no going back. Plus tactical mastery is probably the absolute best talent for warriors, especially once you get whirlwind.
---
You might kill one mob faster than arms, but arms can consistently kill 2-3 in the same time. And it's not like changing your class, you still use all the same abilities, just in a slightly different way. You don't have to be all pissy about it.
---
The top parsing guilds and top parsing individual players are all Horde side.
---
Do you follow the WCL metrics, or even know what they are? Warcraft Logs is the only objective measure of PvE progress, which heavily favors Horde, along with server first boss kills which have so far all been Horde side, except for Onyxia.
---
Lol that’s most likely the case
---
I’m an engineer, I always carry sappers but dynamite is a good idea too
---
Not even
---
You could still hit 60 before phase 2.  Don't procrastinate!
---
Thank you!!
---
You cast searing pain when mob is at -10% health. Sb has a very slow projectile speed and sp is instant like a fireblast. So yes a sb/sp combo will always do more dmg than 1 sb followed by a 2nd one never landing. 
---
And I have clear 15/15 naxx in vanilla and a recent pserver. So yes I'm very experienced while you probably haven't seen vanilla raids past immune fire bosses since you only use corruption and sb lol. Go back to retail locks im sure you got me on them I haven't played on in prolly 10 years.
---
&gt;What is a spriests rotation like in a raid setting?
---
SW:P, MB, Mindflayx2, MB, -&gt;repeat until SW:P needs to be re-applied.
---
&gt;Doesn't mind blast cause a lot of threat?
---
Yes, but, it shouldn't really be an issue. You can get -45% threat from talents.
---
In a raid, a tank's threat shouldnt be a problem. Unless they're still in 2005.
---
Get that gold!
---
This comment got me.
---
&gt;I'm sitting at around 20 gold at level 32, do you normally have 100 by the time your 40 if you're frugal?
---
If you plan it out, don't buy your talents and optimize your gold then you can have a mount by 40.
---
Realistically, most people are about 42+ before they get a mount if they haven't prepared or gotten hugely lucky.
---
I’m guessing their guild consists of players who have been playing classic quite a bit since it released in 2004 (on private servers)
---
Alright, so you just linked a graph that shows rogues and warriors outperforming hunters anyways to support your claim that hunters outperform them them.  At this point, I'm not even exasperated anymore, just disappointed that I wasted my time trying to argue with someone who has a mental disability.
---
The mentality has shifted a lot in classic vs vanilla as far as straying from the “meta”.
---
Hey thanks! They're actually boot covers over-top of some regular boots!
---
Hi, /u/H82xw9faeudp5AZfty9u

---
Go herbalism for when you hit 60 and want to solo dire maul east for gold farm.
---
Feral tank early on with MCP's are some of THE highest threat in the game.  Feral tanks are gear dependent, yes, but a lot of it comes from PVP and a good one is a viable offtank into Naxx while also providing fantastic support to the raid.
---
that 2 gold must be hard to come by
---
I see. Yeah this came has a steep learning curve.  Warlocks seem pretty awesome! Enjoy.
---
You’re forgiven
---
Was in a group with TWO locks. I said "hey,  soulstone expired"....crickets....20 minutes and 1 wipe later, one them finally thought to SS me.
---
Your server will have an official blizzard forum as well as a subreddit most likely. One or both will almost certainly have guild recruitment threads, check out the description of a few and see which fits your style, probably a casual levelling guild right now.
---
You can also keep an eye out in Trade and General chats, as well as '/join GuildRecruitment' in game
---
But why though? Everyone is on the same level, I'll share what I know, doesn't mean I ha e to like it when I answer the same types of questions over and over. There is a lot of basic information each class and player *should* know.
---
We are obviously not talking about a level 20 who has never played the game before that doesn't know what Wailing Caverns is, or needs direction to a quest or something. No were talking about higher leveled players who should know these things by now, or have learned *how* to learn.
---
grats!
---
This is such a classic tale it hurts. Been there many times my friend. I love having hybrids in dungeons.
---
[Band of Brothers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_of_Brothers_(miniseries)) 
---
Highly recommend show. If you’re a smoker, you’re gonna have a bad time lol...
---
thanks for the gold kind stranger
---
Thats not a bug you absolute trash can of a player.
---
You can literally walk behind the house and get to him easilly your just shit.
---
Sorry i get trriggered when shit players complain about loosing and blame a bug.
---
I mean, go back and look at the 70 bracket post-exp off. it thrived right up until warlords, with nobody able to queue into you that wasn't also a twink.
---
the only brackets that died were the ones that already had nobody playing in them. the goal of twinking for the majority of the people doing it has always been to fight other twinks in a nonrotating environment.
---
your statement is as ignorant as saying "people only build legacy decks to wreck standard players".
---
And don’t ever change! Keep the spirit alive!
---
lol fucking cringe. I bet you guys have a montage with Drowning Pool's "Bodies" in the background too eh?
---
Yeah, the WoWHead *raid* bis list says they are better than [Felheart Bracers](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16804/felheart-bracers) which is objectively wrong. Some of these guides really need proofreading.
---
Nah you easily get 3k gold at level 20. Every mage starts with 1k gold in their inventory afterall.
---
am warlock, i most likely used it on myself less than thirty minutes before entering the dungeon
---
Keep up the good work, these are hilarious...except for shaman where you're wrong and I hate you.
---
Do you plays FPS games on the same dpi?
---
7500dpi is crazy high dpi if you dont turn ingame sensitivity way down you would move an entire screens length in 1-2 seconds.
---
How is that playable?
---
So dedicating 10 years to a hobby is only a disorder if it's WoW?
---
lol... u cant be serious.
---
Lol, glad Im not only one. Never bothered to upsize that. :D
---
Cheers!

Straight up the only reason I rolled Hunter back in Vanilla lmao
---
Well, gnome as a race is pretty much a meme even back in the days.
---
Same experience here on the high-pop RP server.  People only run a select few BRD runs.
---
I got all the way to mid-50s and I cant even run the best dungeon ever.   This is SO dissapointing.   I hope beyond hope that one day Blizzard re-releases BRD in all its glory with an actual incentive for a FULL clear.  Give me a week to do it, but please... I want a full clear of that glorious dungeon.
---
Might be [this one.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYFD06UFscw&amp;) I don't know how many people were there, but the PoV character's abilities seem to go off fairly quickly after using them.

**Current Progress:**
---
Currently, the majority of our members are level 60.
---
We are currently building our second raid group and will soon have (2) full Molten Core groups. 
---
Guild raids of Molten Core are under 3-hours with all encounters being 1-shot.
---
**Additional Information**  
---
Rotating Loot Council: 3 permanent officers, 3 rotating raiding members (weekly)
---
Schedule: Wednesday @ 8:00pm raid time, 7:30pm raid invites; and Thursday (if needed)
---
&gt; it has chunks.
---
Yeah.  Theres like eight chunks and people only want to eat two of them.
---
Brand new to WoW, lvl25 orc rogue, wondering if there is a way to macro weapon swaps? I'd love to be able to use my dagger for a backstab/ambush, then pill a sword from my inventory to main hand to increase dps
---
Oh sorry I thought you were saying it didn't work my b
---
Let me know when I can tank, DPS, and heal a dungeon by myself.
---
He's not even a good warlock player...   How does he think Affliction is bad for PvP?
---
I feel the same way, they probably learned a lot from making the other classes and applied all their knowledge to hunters.
---
Yeah I have been playing classic wow since release and it just started happening today. I just played 20 minutes on league of legends without a crash. So I deleted a lot of add-ons and playing wow again to see if any crashes
---
Different strokes for different folks I guess. There's not much going on in classic at the moment, so I always show up fully decked out in world buffs, songflower, etc.  
---
Raiding is a weekly event for me and a lot of fun, so I want to be as optimized as possible. There's also friendly dps competition within my class, so that helps motivate getting all the buffs as well.  
---
Not to mention my guild rewards the juiciest items to those who contribute the most.
---
Empty bag slots are birds
---
My pleasure!
---
Just pick one and roll with it. Pretty much all of them have a chance at dropping BOEs obviously the higher the level the more you can sell the BOEs for. Also if you are an enchanter you can DE everything thats BOP and sell the dust and shards
---
I mean, your entire post history is responding to different comments of mine in different threads. That is already showcasing some kind of huge mental problem on your part. Your comments have a very emotional and panicky vibe, making it obvious that you don't have anything going for ya in life. Now you have also been proven wrong over and over on something you dedicated your entire life to, making it even more painful.
---
You couldn't handle the facts, as substantiated by 10k raid logs, and now you're collapsing and panicking. Sincere advice: get that mental disabilitiy treated, instead of projecting and making nonsensical comments. It's honestly embarrassing.
---
Get cucked
---
Are we pretending that the information back then was even remotely close to being as thorough and accessible as it is today?  Really?
---
See this is how I can see that someone didn't play classic.  You probably have no memory of the incorrect and misleading comments, the totally missing information, or the completely off-kilter guides.    It was insane.
---
Yea I really wanna go on grobbulus, but I am attached to my character and also it is a lot of time that I don't have to reroll. People telling to reroll are acting like all we do is play WoW. lol. We have lives, i took time off to level and now I am not gonna have any.
---
Hakurai on YouTube does a series
---
How fast was the AOE levelling?
---
Sounds like you were never planning on leveling anyway
---
Taunt = Hug
---
how about find people who like to play the way you do, instead of bitching endlessly about people who don't
---
there's an idea
---
Crying helps
---
Okay ?
---
... He's targeting skull if it's a run with life and death on the line, and you shouldn't be hitting anything else.
---
&gt;I'm a 60 Warlock, and I know about things like princess runs/zf mage grinding but classic is my first time playing wow and I'm not sure I'm good enough for that.
---
You are. Watch a few videos, try to get similar items or at least a similar HP/mana pool, then head to Mara or ZF.
---
You will likely die in your first few attempts learning various aggro ranges, learning damage from enemies and from pathing, but you will improve and over time you will be able to farm the content without issue.
---
The most important thing is learning from your attempts, I spent about an hour dying in Stratholme yesterday trying to farm the Hearthsinger with a friend, when we learned the tricks/patterns we needed to follow, we stopped dying and managed to kill him once every 10~ minutes or so.
---
They're so *girthy* though
---
Yea desolace is where I'm at right now I'm 35 or 36 it's pretty quiet and the centaurs are easy to grind
---
Except it's like that associate has things you never will that make your life at work easier.
---
Sure if this person had more experience theycould do more. But it's their fresh take on ideas that have made the work load a lot smoother.
---
It may have taken slightly longer but you all leave the office happy and making jokes. 
---
Slow is smooth and smooth is fast 
---
I'd like to see the priest innervate himself.
---
Who else has MoTW?
---
Thorns?
---
Battle rez?
---
Oh shit the healer is oom I'll pop out of bear and start healing. Never seen a warrior do that.
---
Oh the tank died. I'll pop bear formand taunt. Never seen a priest do that.
---
People say we arent worth the raid spot. Tbh, there are a million warriors. IMO its everyone else that is more easily replaceable.
---
Wait now you got me worried, I'm a prot warrior and we've just cleared UBRS. Why would this game be especially time consuming for me? I'm genuinely asking.
---
Hahah thank you, but idk about famous! That was such a fun time. I really enjoyed the band that was playing, if you couldn't already tell, lol.
---
Like what
---
That was awesome.
---
there's only like 4 zones with them, and only 1 per zone. so it might as well be an ungodly long respawn
---
Thank you!! I was all over the place because half of the time I was lost lol
---
Ahh thanks!!
---
Thank you I appreciate that!
---
Not a trainer, but you can always check the auction house for recipes
---
You can definitely melee the two murlocs in the towers. Looted this particular chest a few hours ago.
---
It’s called buying gold
---
If just half of the people complaining about the imbalances would just swap to alliance then there would be no problem.
---
I haven't played lock since tbc so you'll have to figure some stuff out via trial and error or Google. You should be manually controlling your felhunters counterspell and devour magic, especially vs a magic-cc threat.  You might want to use it to remove a priest's fear from yourself. You might want to remove his fresh new shield. You might want top spam it on CD early to get rid of buffs etc. PvP is dynamic. You shouldn't do things without having a reason to DO them. With a lot of practice, you'll recognize what you need to do, when you need to do it; and most importantly WHY.
---
It's a lot of hot glue, velcro, and tears keeping it all together, haha. Thank you!
---
Sure, but that requires in game player interaction, which is what classic experience is about.
---
Rivenspike &amp; bone slicing hatchet are better than dalrends for orcs.
---
[Band of Brothers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_of_Brothers_(miniseries))
---
Mara, Dire Maul, a bunch of them can earn you great gold
---
He is. I got to 40 and rerolled, my 2nd time around I flew through the levels.
---
I work 12 hour shifts plus extra call ins as a first responder, I coach a community league and have a kid of my own, I still have found plenty of time to level.
---
I have a 60 and a 46 now.
---
If you haven’t run RFC I think he has a q for that.  Also the brd quest to save the princess
---
Searing pain can be good for fast burst, when you don't have time to get a shadowbolt off. It can be also be used to bait a kick/lockout on your fire school so you can freely cast fear and other shadow spells.
---
Can relate
---
Mathematically 2× 1% chance isn't 2%.
---
You are a....badass?
---
Fuck urgent care tho
---
What is target seletec?
---
You'll want Argent Dawn rep for shoulder enchants, and some other goodies. You'll want some Timbermaw rep to get through the tunnel, and in later phases they also have some (not great) rewards. Thorium Brotherhood will offer Fire Resist gear, but the content that's needed for is already trivial without it.
---
If you're Alliance, you can work on Frostsaber reputation for a special snow tiger mount.
---
You should bind all your pet abilities. Offensive devour, defensive devour, spell lock, seduce, etc. Dont keep them on auto cast. You can make macros to target yourself, or to target your buddies.
---
I remember turning in tokens for xp. We received 3 for a win and 1 for a loss. Was that after Vanilla? I can't remember.
---
I feel like we have all been there at least once
---
I got hacked in WoTLK, they restored like 50% of my gear/items. One of my characters had barely anything restored which caused me to have swap mains.
---
A friend was similar.
---
I have heard they usually restore everything, guess we got screwed?
---
Either way supporting gold buyers is bad for WoW.
---
What?  You rolled on a 1h weapon over a warrior?
---
Whow i would just g kick you right on the spot.
---
Why would you roll on a PvP server tho?
---
You might consider the add on Questie.  It will show you available quests. 
---
Or check out a leveling guide from Warcraft Taverns for ideas on where to go next.  They have alliance and horde versions.
---
Paladins are so bad I haven't seen a single Horde even try using them.
---
Basic backend programming 101: Of course we sanitize all database inputs 
---
But people are more than welcome to try cross site scripting or sql injections:-)
---
You're right, I was leaning on stereotypes for dramatic effect.
---
I see your point. But even tho this is classic, there is still a big difference in the game that where available back in 2004 and then the classic we see today. We came to this idea, because we wanted to show our friends what gear we had and didn't want to record a video like most streamers are doing. This dosn't block your classic experience, if you want to run around and inspect players, be our guest! But some people like a modern extension to the game &lt;3
---
hahaha
---
I'm for them, all my friends are spread accross servers due to horrible communication and I'd love to get everyone together onto one
---
Gg wp better love is sell them for 500g more each than to equip it
---
Don't forget the ability to zap all around the world while other classes spend 10-15 minutes on a boat and flight path.
---
I mean just running any end game dungeon in a group should net you at least that much per hour
---
Very sad for you :(
---
PTSD for healers.
---
In that case why is robe of the void (which has no hit) listed as BIS until phase 3, but not for example felheart robes which have 1% hit?
---
Then idk what you're crying in hunter for.  If the gold spent doesn't warrant you spending any time finishing then it can't be that bad
---
Intimidating Shout.
---
Enjoy the 6 extra mobs. Fuck all of you.
---
Is that fucking Ross from Friends?
---
There is no SL/SL
---
Of course its the same... the key difference is tho.. i run with a guild consistently and everyone gets loot eventually. We run 4 UBRS a night for skinning knife/flask attempts and gearing out our tanks with fury gear.. play with a guild.. make some friends.. keep grouping with those friends.. get gear.
---
Right, they should be making enough threat in the first place.
---
Guilds out there have warriors pulling well over 400 dps.  Tanks can make enough threat.  Maybe not paladins though.
---
Pretty sure its just 3 days.
---
At lower levels that's definitely true. If it's a pull with a single mob that's obnoxious, but ultimately doesn't matter. However, tanking end game I prefer taking less damage during the initial portion of a fight, since it can be spikiest damage wise.
---
That being said, it's infuriating when I'm LOSing a pack of casters, or just trying to position a pack in general, and a mob is stunned before I have them where I want or they haven't even reached me yet. That's not exclusive to rogues though.
---
I see, thanks for the answer.

Do you know which members are professional streamers, and do you know their Twitch channels?

---
Even so, faerlina is the highest populated NA server. Without layering it'll be fun to watch.
---
Roughly. The Classic warlock discord has a spreadsheet in the PvE Resources section where you can input all your gear and it will tell you precisely what the stats should be weighted at since it varies based on your gear.
---
It really wasn't a nightmare though.  The nightmare was balancing the classes across each other in the sandbox of WoW, which isn't as much of an issue in a game like overwatch.
---
Shame
---
You don't have to like reserved item groups (I don't unless it's like orb for tank or something) but joining a group and agreeing to their outline of what they are doing and reserving then going against that makes you the asshole.
---
If you don't like those groups just don't join them.
---
At the same time though, that also means a larger number of people that do twink. Given how quickly inflation of gold and high cost items being frequently sold has ramped up in Classic, I'd actually be amazed if you don't see at least half of the players in any given BG for the first week or so being twinks.
---
Grats! Wanna have one huhu
---
It’s not BIS twink but it’s definitely viable behind BOSA and the silencer
---
People who make fun of people for saying frisky are the sort of people who prefer PvP servers.
---
If its red its dead. I will attack any alliance i see idc. Show dominance. Even if you get slaughtered like a fat juicy pig by some one 30 lvls higher. OOOOHHH NOOOO they killed me! It shows them you have the balls to play rather than trying to hide when youre going to die wether you like it or not.. dont make it easy for them.
---
Two of your best in slot items come from LW - Devilsaur set. Saves you a lot of money to make it yourself and you could make a lot of money selling it. My best in slot chest is bind on pick up so I took tailoring, levelled it to max just to make that Chest. When I make it I'm going to drop tailoring for alchemy. I've been saving all the herbs I've gathered while levelling on a bank alt.
---
If you use bartender, make sure you use the actual bartender key binds, or at least clear them. 
---
I had this problem sometimes until I played with those settings.
---
Felstriker is alot better than Gutgore, yes... obviously
---
Cool thanks for the info
---
Pug tanking is miserable. The random whispers from players asking if you want to tank can almost amount to spam at times. Theres a split amongst DPS on how fast or slow they want you to pull so you can never win. Most DPS refuse to pay attention to their threat meters (I doubt most players dont even have threat meters set up) and take it out on the tank when you cant get aggro. The lower levels are absolute hell for warriors because we function off of 1 taunt CD. Some healers come in without water and get mad at the tank over it. The lack of situational awareness that a lot of people seem to have results in mobs and pats being mispulled left and right. Being a warrior tank, my repair bills are ridiculous. Sometimes I've had to prioritize repairs over levelling up skills or buying food. Most of all people just dont care about you, the player. They just want a meat shield to run in and spare them an hour looking for a tank. 
---
Yet these are the same players that have the nerve to complain about lack of tanks. Tanking can be really fun, but during the levelling process it's absolutely miserable and sucks the enjoyment right out of the game. Were practically sacrificing our fun for 50+ levels.
---
Definitely an axe haha! That's good.
---
The best thing about twinking was always arena skirmish, which was exclusively twink on twink
---
Probably Soul Link, since you’re dying so fast. No point in being a glass cannon if you die before you can do any damage.
---
Try this:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IV0mZbxuzgxotZxx0z
---
I don’t play a warlock, maybe someone else can make you something better. That gives you soul link, more survivability via demonology, shadowburn, and imp drain life/corruption.
---
Anyone else got any pointers for this guy?
---
There are no rules of thumb for this. Your only constant is your base spell damage. Beyond that, the correlation between sp, hit and crit all changes once you change any one of them. 
---
Personally i just calculated it all out. Its not that hard.
---
Yeah, Orcs and Humans' Orcs are basically comically evil bad guys with a simple backstory, basically a reason for the game to exist.  Orcish Warlocks in it were basically mages with no understanding of where their power came from.  There is no mention of demons in the Orc manual.
---
Yeah, I've logged and went on retail for a while.  Not looking forward to Phase 2 but hopefully will be high enough that I won't be seen as an easy target.  If you go on zone chat there usually is a higher lvl willing to help you out with gankers.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI6j5tLCWZs did a cool video on it. :)
---
Not if really geared
---
No. Pretty sure complaining about population imbalance has been a thing for almost 15 years. Blizzard hasnt done anything about it. Why keep complaining?
---
This is probably the biggest thrill I get out of tanking. I can personally decide if a group is going to run now or waste an hour looking for a tank. It's too much power.
---
LMAO
---
You should be using everything. Even diffrent curses changes the outcome, of the fight.
---
I have 5 days played game time hitting 60 on my lock. But I leveled it wrong? I dont get why people on reddit take everything as a personal attack. Drain tanking is hardly any then wanding. 100% uptime but an AoE mage kills more mobs so if we look at the math mages have more uptime. While you jump mob  to mob  after you kill 2 a mage would have killed 10 mobs. Then they drink. Followed by blink is the most fun spell in the game. Go invisible cast blink. Run around with rocket boots  with a warlock you just stand there and dot and run around or drain tank. My entire post is on the more enjoyable class. And coming from a ret paly warlocks are boring.
---
I was told to do skinning and mining when I started
---
Just shut up.   The dude is right,  a shaman with ironfoe is stupid af and a waste.
---
Screenshot of your 60 ally on stalagg? I’ll show you mine :) it’s not even close to 80:20, it’s more like 1.8:1
---
What guide(s) did you follow for aoe grinding? There doesn't seem to be much for alliance.
---
Dun spec prot unless you have a guild/raid spot as a tank. Prot warrior is extremely bad on mob grind or questing solo.
---
Get two elven rings and call it gg. Stealth runs are pretty easy and much faster than princess runs.
---
[Blinking Rules &amp; Regulations](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Blinking_Rules_%26_Regulations)
---
Please report back, lots of people could benefit from this information! :)
---
There are a lot of variables, it depends on your rotation, your current damage, your current hit and crit, and your talents.  I've got a whole spreadsheet to calculate it for my gear, and that's just using a simple frostbolt spam. Basically naked it's about 9 SP/hit and 8/crit,  fully geared and raid buffed currently it's about 17/hit and 13/crit, and where I expect to be in full MC gear it's  25/18.  But the numbers are going to be different for locks. Your damage will be lower so you'll be on the lower side of those numbers; DoTs can't crit so if you get any damage from those the number will be even lower for crit.
---
I love it!
---
Is there a leveling guide out there that focuses more on completeness and experiencing everything rather than speed?
---
Classicwow.live and joana have speed as the primary focus, which means there is quests that get skipped, as well as dungeons.
---
I still want to level with a guide, but Im not concerned about speed, so I was hoping there is a guide that focuses on completeness.
---
That makes a lot of sense. Building the other classes, coming up with ideas that didn't really fit them, and then eventually finding a place for them in the Hunter.
---
Had a rogue try the distract shit on me today but my jump pattern just can't be beat and there is no way i wont land in lava!
---
You disgust me. Go on.
---
The bit I dabbled in Warlords I remember laughing thinking they made this whole huntard thing way too easy now
---
why didn't you take a screenshot of the photo you took from the 2nd phone though?
---
Just do the regular runs (i.e. not tribute, not jump run).
---
If you do east you can get the Crescent Key by doing the “chase the imp” quest (talk to the imp at the start on the left, he runs away, talk to him again each time you catch up.
---
When you have the key you can open the doors to West and North.
---
The level of difficulty climbs from East - West - North but not by much and some of the trash in west is actually pretty rough. Use interrupt. Use poly sometimes.
---
I’ve noticed in the last week or two that there are very few “regular/quest” runs going for any dungeon, everyone is doing 1-2 boss shortcut runs trying to get their BIS items. If you can’t find a run, try starting one and say that you’re doing a full run, you might find people in the same boat as you.
---
Yeah, that dps can either die or bring it to me. If they die, I've kept my cooldowns/rage up to pull it off the healer. I mark everything, a druid needs you to focus more. If I split my threat and cooldowns too much, mobs are all over the place and everyone dies. I *will* try to pull that mob off my dps, but they need to *make it easier* for me. It's not that I can't get threat if they don't, but if I try to go out of my way to pull it off that 1 dps and something gets resisted people die.     
---
Yes I saw that mob on you, you kept dpsing it, you didn't bring it anywhere near me, I'm not blind, I know what I'm doing, and what I'm doing is not wasting everything I have to help 1 guy that can't be assed to give half a squirt of effort.
---
They’re the original hero class!
---
Lmao you literally linked alt raids in a desperate attempt to prove your point.
---
How much are runecloth bags and mooncloth bags on your server? Competition on my server has gotten so bad, the bags are selling for less than the price of runecloth required to make them. I was trying to maintain a 30-50s margin on bags until the last two weeks when people began listing the bags for 2g to 2g20s. Same goes for mooncloth bags where the margins have shrunk down to less than 1g. It's simply not worthwhile to make those for profit anymore.
---
Could be worth abit, depending on how active and many twinks there's going to be on your server. The bow is bis ranged weapon for 39 warrior's cause of it's stats. But you would have to wait around for someone wanting the bow specificly.  Maybe around 50g? Currently with a chance for higher value in phase 3, when bgs becomes available.
---
it's not just doable, it's easy
---
Only better feeling is that flurry sword from Uldaman quest
---
As a shaman, there is *no* class I'm happier to see in a party than a druid. Druids are the goddamn best.
---
Well people wouldn't lie on reddit would they?
---
Definitely lol I was leveling mine back in WOD and I was like it can’t be that bad and pulled everything. Legion was also rough with barrage in Nethes Lair especially at the star on the dungeon with the worms.
---
Ok first of all when you're tanking most of your rage is spent of sunder armor and cleave. 
---
&gt;The majority of your leveling time is 1 on 1;
---
Not as arms... That's why it's so good... 
---
&gt;when you fuck up and pull multiples, those may count for memorable moments, but the reality is you only remember them because you're pushing the edge.
---
If you pull multiple and succeed you can do it *consistently*. That's how I leveled! 
---
&gt;It gives me nearly instant ability to use rage without waiting 3 seconds for the next swing;
---
Heroic Strike? I wouldn't recommend ever using heroic strike in general unless you were almost rage capped. Also don't Rend like, ever. Unless you're fighting a rogue or something, it's just a waste of rage. With sweeping strikes you can cleave two targets *twice* in one swing. That's 4 effective weapon swings, and don't even get me started on what Whirlwind does with sweeping strikes.
---
And you were being pissy, your original comment said something like "but muh tactical reee". 
---
"Pissy; arrogantly argumentative." Now you know the definition. 
---
I'm just saying maybe give it a try before you rule it out. There's a reason why every says to go arms, cuz it's fucking nuts. Or you could be a contrarian and stay Fury even though it is objectively worse to level with. 
---
You make a valid point for piercing howl though I will admit. But more often than not you have a class in your party with a mass slow like a shaman or a mage, still good point.
---
This is all assuming you're above 30, if you're still 20 something Fury might be better.
---
Meanwhile I'm sitting over here having spent well over 500g in respecs &gt;.&gt;
---
Wow I must have insanely bad luck going on then
---
Karen becoming the manager. That’s akin to dividing by 0.
---
good thing archeage just re released D: 
---
oh wait its a shit show
---
I mean in reality it’s a lot harder to solo farm than you think. You probably won’t get one kill every 3 minutes, more like one every 5-6 minutes with being lucky on respawns. You’ll also need to bring a tonne of water and food and you’ll go through lots of gold worth in supplies. On top of that, most guilds are 5 manning the farms, so the spot is extremely busy, therefore making it less likely you get 1 kill every 3 minutes. On PvP servers you will just get killed by a 5 man party if you’re solo. And the run back is a very long one! 
---
IMO it’s worth paying at least 300g for the eyes, and farm the gold some other method.
---
...vanish, I’ll just sit and watch everyone die, then go make myself a sandwich while you run back...
---
Trolls have three toes, actually. It's just that one of them is located at the heel of the foot, similar to bird feet, I suppose.
---
I love this meme
---
Fight club has a dps spreadsheet. There's a link in their discord.
---
ready for P2 btw
---
Hunters are fine as long as raiding is not your goal, even if it is, hunters have a role in every raid
---
That's impossible.
---
Either we hang together, or we will most certainly hang separately.
---
dont you have some dps calculations to do or something? nobody is asking for your negativity
---
most ppl say "gz" when someone finds something this rare you know... and now it happened to be a shaman.
---
You could also look into running some of the faster dungeons during offnights, I'm finding they make some decent gold and can be fast if the group knows what they are doing.
---
Player vs Player battles are relative to the situation you are in. You might find yourself against PvPers who have prepared and gathered the many trinkets, offhands and engineering items available in classic WoW. You may have been ganked 2v1. 
---
To be competitive, not only do you have to play the class correctly, and instinctively (all keybinds memorised to muscle memory) you also need to collect all the items that give you the competitive edge.  
---
Dont be too hard on yourself, and always reserve the right to improve. Some players out there have years of experience as Gladiators or Field Marshals and know the tricks to outplay in PvP situations. 
---
The best advice you can receive is to find your playstyle. Start by dueling people your level outside the major cities. Challenge your guildies. You'll soon find the strategies to beat each class as a Warlock. Then you will find that the people you are meant to beat beat you only because of certain items they have. Then next time, you may counter them with an item you have up your sleeve etc etc.
---
I'd say hunter. More buttons, more options.
---
R13 blows t1 out of water. Same iLvl as T2, only more PvP oriented
---
Completly untrue. Also u can make your OH never miss. Def not a war.
---
I'd love to see a non-easy mode Warlock pvp video.
---
Is wotf on a separate cooldown or does using it end up making trinket a short cd? Been a while
---
thanks i actually laughed out loud on this.
---
What is this, World of Welfare?
---
can you explain this a little bit further? we are currently doing 20man splits on onyxia but the aggro seems completely random. im sure we could do 10 or 15man ony if we figure out how the p2=&gt;3 transition works
---
Second chance for sure :).
---
I don’t want to judge you, am trying my best to understand your ui, such as what skill you insert into your hotbar, then I realized why ur skill is here then another skill is at the other end of the bar. It’s just mind boggling.
---
There were twinks back then too. There were twink guilds back then. Azgalor had two or three rival twink guilds *just on Alliance.* There were people who basically mained their twinks.
---
How people think that twinking is some new idea that the unsophisticated savages of yesteryear couldn’t have even dreamed of is beyond me.
---
Improved shadow bolt alters the math considerably compared to mages. Even if you argue that other locks may steal your ISB counters, the opposite is also true so it’s a wash regardless of the number of locks.
---
Well all classes are fine of the fight lasts 3 minutes or less lol
---
quick question. Do you need 10 people to run rend runs? or any dungeon actually.
---
I actually respect someone less if they're throwing out all the thinly veiled "please don't attack me!" emotes.
---
Kinda out of left field
---
What ability is this again?
---
Won't you end up very oom without a mage or very poor from drinking constantly ?
---
AGM is good even at 60
---
Step 1. Find Warlock PvP video
---
Step 2. Realize they are Horde and realize how many times they would have died had the person they were up against had WoTF
---
Step 3. Keep looking for Warlock PvP videos
---
It's almost like classes underperform overall due to mana constraints  over a long period  of time and not actual throughput
---
The quest for total balance was one of the first mistakes
---
Yea, if you spend about 5 seconds you can see the difference. This isn't rude, its advice. Because clearly OP cannot see for shit.
---
Warlocks are in short supply compared to Mages on my server, so I almost always can find a spot in a raid or dungeon if I decide to PUG. I can summon people, soulstone people, and give healthstones to people as long as I have shards.
---
Rotation in raids is kinda boring. SM/Ruin uses whatever Curse the raid needs, sometimes Corruption, and then Shadowbolt spam. Life Tap for mana. DS/Ruin sacs their succubus, puts up their curse, and spams shadowbolt.
---
BIG downside: Farming shards at 60 requires killing lvl 48+ mobs. You also dedicate anywhere from 12-30+ bag slots for shards if you're on summon duty or healthstone duty for the raid.
---
Check out Zephan's Warlock Simulation. That's the best resource that I know of for calculating it all out since it changes as your stats change. Rule of thumb, as a fresh 60, spell power is probably worth around 12-14 crit and hit.
---
I'm on my third warrior in vanilla/classic.
---
First go around I was almost over the place and did my fury from around 45 up, difference was night and day for downtime between pulls.
---
I went full prot with that one and went php spec with a taurean.  Arms all the way, and got carried through dungeons for gear.  It was not as fun, consistent, or rewarding to me.  (I have an enhanced shaman, so if I want to see big numbers I dont have to go far.)
---
I tried arms up through 35, and midway leveling, rage starved and waiting on a taunt cd, dragging mobs off casters, I respected to fury and everything snapped into place.
---
I could tab sunder (lol cleave) revenge, demo and battle shout without praying to not miss so I'd have rage to spare.
---
I dont need an instructional on what abilities to use while tanking, thank you very much.  
---
And yeah, I do all this without leaving defensive stance, so the need for tactical mastery when instancing isnt there yet.  By the time I'm at the level wherebstance dancing will be a thing, I'll be deep enough into arms to have it.
---
There have been countless tests of fury vs arms and all the credible ones say the same shit.  Play what you like, because 1 dps isnt game changing, but frustration is.
---
I think it's accepted that sub / assassin is best for pvp. Definitely the most fun.
---
Agreed. Unless I'm in the middle of the map and we're-both-just-questing-the-graveyard-is-so-far-away-please-don't-kill-me-god-dammit.
---
For Warlocks with pre-bis it isn't. Ruin adds 100% damage bonus, so every crit is like 2 hits, and improved Shadowbolt adds further benefit to every crit.
---
I always saw parrot
---
Amen. RPGs aren't meant to have all classes balanced around 1v1 or 2v2 combat. That kind of defeats the whole purpose of having unique classes. They're meant to be better and some things and worse at others.
---
This is the answer I was looking for, thanks
---
Definently see your point. Could be a feature we implement, if you dont wish to be on the armory you should be able to opt out just like raider.io :-) This site isnt ment to offend anyone but merely a service for those who likes to see other peoples gear and talents
---
SCUM FUCK WARRIOR SHIT PLAYER GIVE ME A CHANCE TO MOONFIRE NEXT TIME ILL FUCK U UP KID
---
I go to this game to get away from all that
---
Im 53 and have herb/alch and I have 220g I do not even buy anything. I would also like to know the secret.
---
Can confirm.
---
Was dwarf mage in beta.
---
you type /combatlog ingame or use an[ addon that does this](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/autologgerclassic) (note that you need to enable advanced network logging or w/e in settings) and then you upload it to classic.warcraftlogs.com.
---
god, last night I spent so long on that. Had to run all the way there, wait half an hour for him to spawn, walk his slow ass all the way to the end, and finally watched him die and tirion appear only to get ganked by a pack of alliance douchebags.
---
Legitimately fuckawful quest.
---
You guys need to follow the 3x20 rule
---
Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.
---
And visit the damn optometrist.
---
You can do it as a fresh 60, I did.
---
Just put run speed on boots, void walker on passive.
---
Make wide circles against princess and if she starts getting near you, set your void on attack to set off her aoe spell and then set your void walker on passive again.
---
&gt;I could tab sunder (lol cleave)
---
What kind of tank doesn't have rage for cleave? 
---
&gt;And yeah, I do all this without leaving defensive stance, so the need for tactical mastery when instancing isnt there yet.
---
This is why you don't have enough rage for cleave 
---
&gt;I'm on my third warrior
---
&gt;Compares arms warrior to enhancement shaman 
---
Why are you lying? 
---
&gt;I dont need an instructional on what abilities to use while tanking, thank you very much. 
---
You obviously do.
---
Don't forget an epic mount. If you're planning on doing battlegrounds all day long you need an epic mount, 60% won't cut it.
---
Pets chasing fleeing mobs is where I shit the bed most but tabbin’ will get ya indeed
---
How so? I deal almost no damage. Genuinely curious how I'm supposed to actually kill other players before dying(I only have around 3k hp due to all the cloth) because it feels bad.
---
I try to avoid inviting them to dungeons.
---
There is gear progression which seems to be what they meant. Going from prebis to raid bis.
---
I think he was asking what youre REALLY playing when that warlock ganked you that caused all that salt.
---
Nearly all of them that drop from an endgame instance. 305 vs 300 wep skill is huge. 
---
Rivenspike
---
Ribsplitter
---
Serathil
---
Boneslicing hatchet 
---
Iceblade hacker
---
Hedgecutter
---
It's actually Archmage Antonidas.
---
Actually that's Grobb
---
I’m against paid transfers. It’s going to make an existing problem far worse.
---
I would be for faction specific free transfers, even a slight, non-game-breaking bonus like a pet for transferring to a server that needs the balance.
---
Holy crap - I totally forgot my first ever character in the beta was a dwarf mage.
---
I wish I had friends like this
---
As a druid I tanked form  10-47, switched to heals, made it to 51 and I was like I quit now I am a Moonkin! Gonna switch back to heals at 60.
---
I m lucky af. Whenever this happens i m busy anyway and wouldnt have been able to play anyway (work mainly).
---
Blizz gotta deal w/ this before phase 2 and before making all servers single layer servers.
---
Stephen Hawking.
---
I second this. I did my first MC the other day, i had bothered to get almost all of my pre-bis gear unlike the other warlocks in the raid. Despite all of us just corruption - shadowbolting, i consistently had 100-150 more dps than them while also being the inferior dps spec (SM/Ruin vs DS/Ruin).
---
Same here. I’ve always been a hardcore pvper and ignored raiding in the past, but now i find myself less interested in pvp and more interested in trying my hand at raiding.
---
Zug Zug.
---
I had 800g when I hit 60 on day 9 of release, had I spent more time making gold instead of just leveling it would have easy to get the rest.
---
Skinning alone from 40-60 was close to 400 gold, and farming BRD with a group was about 10 gph from vendoring trash and greed won blues.
---
You may want to farm felcloth off the demons in azshara while you level up if you plan to build robe of the void/felcloth gloves, not sure if your interested in those if your not raiding but since your tailoring it's worth mentioning.
---
[/salute](https://imgflip.com/i/20uywz)
---
I appriciate the detailed information, you have made it alot easier for me! Thanks alooooooot!!
---
Can you do a [mod:xxx] condition if you also want to use mouseovers? Or since the modifier will return a condition does it ignore the mouseover piece? Been trying to figure out how to do it. Might not be possible since a lot of macros will only allow one action to complete in classic now. 
---
Ex. I want a macro to cast highest rank SW:pain over what I hover, but if I hold ctrl it casts a lower rank SW: pain on what I hover
---
If you ever see a troll priest named Indolent, I'm a care bear and will try to mind control you into the instance (unless you're someone that was such a dick to me before I added a character note to your name, for instance by chasing me across the map with 5 people). That being said, most people die before the mind control even goes off. I feel bad for all you alli. Good luck, and god speed.
---
Hes a mage
---
On Yojamba too, but it was the Alliance camping. Came back 20 min later it was the horde camping.
---
In classic.  Tanking in heirlooms was pretty awesome tho
---
Could have also just made warlock and mage faction specific with dwarves gaining mage and trolls gaining warlock.
---
Here’s to hopefully 15 more!
---
Cheers
---
&gt;they are the only other class that fuck s with warlocks in pvp
---
Hello, I'm a shaman
---
Yea... that too.
---
Deciding who gets the item based on how big of an upgrade it is will encourage people to just not grind their pre-BiS or better gear in general. It's a terrible metric.. Whatever you do, that should not be the criteria.
---
As a mage, I silence the aoe farmers.
---
+4 dmg should be your goto- once you get a new weapon try and get crusader on it
---
Please is pretty formal and not rude. You have a terrible attitude, I'm having tons of fun 🙃
---
Unemployed?
---
Dwarves couldn't even be mages until Cataclysm.
---
As a druid, I kinda feel this. I've been in a dungeon where the tank was pulling quicker than I could heal, like I'd finish healing them and they'd pull before I healed the dps. He died, I rez, I said "nobody can die for 30min". Tank kept pulling too much too quick and I couldn't keep up, we wiped. I have a lot of respect and admiration for tanks who can read their group well and find the right speed for everyone
---
Thanks for the input, I like the idea of being useful but also not the most played class haha. Soul stone is amazing, I main a tank and having a warlock in group has always been a god send, can’t say te same about mages to be honest.
---
You are right. Freezing band is only good in pve. Frost damage sucks for PvP since it doesn't affect skills you use often in pvp: fire blast, arcane explosion, scorch if you're elemental spec.
---
I did the same thing, made a mage to farm gold because I didn’t my options as a holy priest and now I’m having a lot of fun on my mage so. If you like alts go for it. I aoe grind  to level only when it’s convenient tho. I’m only 34 tho, Thinking about just respecting for single target. may not have answered your question but it’s fun, you won’t regret it. :D
---
You better pop potions every pull because you just spend 800g on 6 spell power.
---
Because I already factored it in, dumbass.
---
Cant you do sth like:
---
/cancelaura stealth
---
/cast [no stealth] stealth
---
in the same macro so it knows what to do for when you re either stealthed or not? The syntax might not be right but you get my point.
---
I hope people were throwing https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18640/happy-fun-rock
---
They sometimes start evading when you're in fucking melee range. It's a bunch of pussy murlocs.
---
Fucking autists man
---
Ignore them and move on. They probably will quit after a while and you have never have to deal with them again... Nothing to be sad about, even if life sucks outside of wow. Better times will come. :)
---
Two sides of the coin I suppose.
---
I think that +hit is far far better than 22AP.
---
I just won it on my second run, used up all of my luck for the rest of classic.
---
Meat shields have feels too. Straight up tho, a genuine “thank you” is in order.
---
My first main ever was a warrior, that repair bill is more than hefty.
---
Nah ungoro at 51. One round get all shit done, no need for return then!
---
You may be a mage, but i still give you a thumbs up and an upvote. Keep up the good work.
---
Best method, though you have to do it for every game and it’s super hard to get used to: not bind movement to WASD. But ESDF. It frees up so many more easy access keys on the left, with the normal ones stil beingnin easy reach.
---
*seductive moaning*
---
Are you just wearing a ton of +healing greens?  Do priests get some kind of bonus to +healing?  I can have like... 540 at most on my druid.  I guess I don't have something neat like Benediction, but outside that I have full prebis blues, full t1, Aurastone, and a hide of the wild.
---
Private servers and Vanilla worked fine.
---
They said if the community wants to they’d consider it.
---
As someone who’s new to WoW in general, How do you know/decide which bracket to keep your twink in? 
---
How do you know what stats/items to go for (depending on the class of your twink)?
---
a lot of rogues have done the crunching and as human shadow + devil is pre bis for human swords atleast
---
We certainly all wait together during the run back/Rezzing regardless of you survive the shit storm
---
Is it still a laugh if no one hears it? :/
---
So, it does change things.
---
A point here and there won’t hurt. Just roll with it! I did the same on my rogue but probably won’t respec until much higher (43 now) when I know what build I want to try next. Mistakes happen but it’s a part of the game! Don’t forget to ask peeps for help or look up guides. Have fun.
---
It doesn't change what I said.
---
Glove slot for hunters is usually a LOT of hit.  You're either getting a flat +2 and some stats (tier, voones) +2 from completing devilsaur, or effectively +4 from trueaim.  I have not done the research as I don't plan to PvE on my hunter, but would it currently be worth using the gloves in any scenario given the fact that you need to make up a minimum of 2% hit?
---
I have both the helm and the mount, I'd rather loose the helm than the mount 
---
Without hesitation
---
Being the tank with a hunter friend doing dungeon grinds together.. oh man i gotta show him this he will laugh.. i will cry..
---
I'm on the fence....... I have a warrior in progress and im having fun but i have this fear that I will have a hard time finding a raid spot since tanks are always filled. Im basically a loner cause all my friends quit the game..... contemplating making a Resto Druid cause it seems that healers are generally in demand. Also considering PvP I know Warriors that are geared are great but what about a Healer Druid??
---
&gt;pfft this guy needs to use ABILITIES to win. Fucking pathetic.
---
get a jump run buddy
---
people love grounding totem over eating a table sacrifice
---
Haha, now you've truly lost it. More delusions from a cherrypicker who doesn't how to have an argument without logical fallacies and confirmation bias. 
---
You really just dismissed a raid with 18 melee dps in a topguild getting outclassed by a hunter? You can also look at the individual bosses and you'll see top 3 hunters everywhere. Ragnaros for example.
---
These are just logexamples, I can provide dozens more examples of topguilds but you'll just  *insert nonsensical excuse* to dismiss it anyway because the cognitive dissonance impairing your mental is too severe to even look objectivitely at anything anymore. 
---
It's okay buddy, one day you'll understand statistics and data representation and you might even present valid data! Till that time keep making a fool out of yourself so we can have a good laugh.
---
I think that's more a problem in PvP than in PvE. Mobs aren't complaining about one hero having an unfair advantage over another like people tend to.
---
Best of luck with your grinds, may your friend wield the discipline most of us cannot!
---
I chose to make 49 my endgame. Currently unsubbed until p3. Got a bad-arsed 49 shadow priest dripping with 49 BIS items and powerful enchants ready to own WSG and eventually AB.
---
Someone in my guild post the Warcraft logs after raid which has this.
---
The bugs took over and named it after themselves. Silithus is how a swarm refers to itself. Silithe and Silither and male and female, etc etc
---
Seek help.
---
Those mobs would have been worse than most because of the quest reward though. Everyone wants that damn stopwatch.
---
I'd bet real life money it's going to happen.  They didn't invest all this time/money to hook modern client and utilities to run vanilla content for 6 phases.  They've already said that BC will be easy to implement now that they've spent the effort.  Regardless of what you want, the writing is on the wall.
---
Rogue. No one ever wants you. I got kicked from an MC raid with 27 people because they said 2 rogues was enough. I barely ever find groups except with under geared tanks that can't kill the boss I need. Or if I do get a good group it takes 2 hours and the thing I need doesn't drop anyway or the other rogue gets it or the resto druid needs for their off spec because no one gives a shit about you.
---
Solid advice, much appreciated
---
Yeah I was here.
---
Blizzard is a joke. Can’t even run a server half as well as two dudes in a basement in Moscow. Embarrassing
---
They’re gonna have cross realm bgs right away in classic?
---
Can someone help me understand addons, how to get and make work etc. I have twitch and downloaded a couple but I dont know if they are working! Sorry if this is a common question I'm very noob
---
5 weeks as first priority - no 2 hander drops. Feelsbadman
---
DS/Ruin (15% shadow damage buff from saccing succubus vs 10% from Shadow Mastery) will typically do more raw dps, the downside is that you lose your imp for bloodpact. In my raids so far, we try and have one SM/Ruin lock in the tank group for the stamina buff. 
---
I enjoy the SM/Ruin build more because it's far more versatile overall, particularly PvP. I won't ever need to respec, unless i wanted to purely play PvP in SL spec or go full destro around AQ40 ish. Plus, having a pet is part of the warlock fantasy and i'd only give it up if the alternative offered a more interesting rotation, which it doesn't.
---
[You rn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hnd8NC4YRmA)
---
A hooker quest?
---
Except you don't manage people at all. If you have to manage people during raids, you have bad members.
---
Fuck man, I really want to run a Belf or a Draenei
---
Every time she knocks the tank back into the wall he looses about 20% of the threat he had. It isn't just staying below the tank but staying about 30% or more below.
---
Living in paradise
---
Eh? I opened it as a hunter. Stand on the hut with them and melee. Easy.
---
May as well start the nesingwary quests in stranglethorn. Or Arathi Highlands if everything in South shore is done.
---
Tbh I do see randoms in greens in puhs sometimes that contributing half of what another player would bring. So i specting can be fine sometimes imo.
---
It depends on whether your pug is contested ofc. I've been to a good mc pug (cleared up to domo with 1 soulstoned wipe) where the guild brought in a couple  lvl 59/8 people because they lacked too many.
---
I had this issue and this fixed it. But I'd have to delete it every day. Then, suddenly, it went away all together.
---
No idea why, I'm just glad it's gone.
---
I’m in the same boat as you. It confused the literal fuck out of me. I wanted to find a video walking you through literal step by step and I couldn’t find one. I got questie to work SOMEHOW but I really don’t know how bc I didn’t know what I was doing.
---
As a bear I miss it. so close to 10k hp :(
---
Hey man at least you got one to work! Did you use the twitch app or something else?
---
Over 60 runs haven't seen it once lol
---
It can vary on the guild....
---
In my guild, we wiped on ragnaros one time and just as we were getting ready to go for attempt #2, we see a random warrior go charging over the lava into ragnaros and die within 1 second. Some guilds may punish you for this, we pissed ourselves laughing and still wind the person up about it to the point of it being a running gag.
---
So I'm only gonna tell you what my class leader of rogues told me. Raiding = combat which = swords especially with thrashblade plus the sword spec combos. Make that windfury plus your procs hit like 2 million time
---
For pvp, it's up to the player.
---
Wanna have a fair chance against most people? Combat
---
Wanna melt every clothie in sight but be deathly afraid of plate? Subtlety and daggers. Ambush, gouge, backstab, evic and most people melt. 
---
Don't fuck with certain warlocks though, they will wreck house. 
---
The warlock I know can 1v1 quite literally anybody and consistently 1v5's, I wouldn't believe it if I didn't see it for myself.
---
I missed the leveling curve on Deviate Delight and would love to transfer to Bloodsail Buccaneers.  
---
I made a huge mistake rolling on a pvp server.
---
Wow will do, thank you so much!
---
Lmao, that's a great response.
---
Magically evading sounds like Ninja Murlocs to me.
---
Can gnomes shoot bows?
---
I and a group of friends decided to so sungeons 5-6 lvls below the final boss for fun. (the mosy challenging you can make it honetstly, we couldn't equip the gear that dropped.) It was somewhat challenging sometimes but unnecessarily tedious.
---
Played a lock main from vanilla on to legion and again in classic. I have used the wand a handful of times.  If that's how you are playing. It sounds like you are taking the fun out of the game and lazy.
---
What do I do about DoTs being applied to me?
---
As a noob mage I just get killed very quickly when vsing warlocks and priests and feel powerless. On the odd occasion I win the fight I still die afterwards. Seem very OP but I am new.
---
It appears you went as "sexy af."
---
He’s saying you are now post to all the pugs, which is the same outcome (for them) as you burning out.
---
You turn their green bar into your green bar and then your green bar into your blue bar.
---
Warlock is tons of fun for solo pve. Also tons of fun for solo PvP. Warlock is just a ball of fun it starts off slow(you do damage over time, stuff just doesn't live long enough for you to shine) but some time around level 30 you go from the bottom of the DPS chart to the top.
---
I think the best way to find a wholesome and social community is to actively engage players that you find out in the world. That being said, people on RP servers are generally friendlier, and I've heard good things about Grobbulus, the RP-PVP server
---
I was there fighting on the alliance side.  It's quite sad that illegal servers halfway across the world from handled these situations 10x better than Blizzard's servers.  This is just simply unacceptable with Phase 2 and world bosses being less than a week away.
---
Do y’all have Divine Intervention in classic?
---
There's really nothing they could have done about that. In any game woth linear progression you just have to break the chain at some point. You can't have people being carried through molten core in wotlk, they would just mever catch up.
---
The 2nd top comment says that in the manual, Dwarves were mages. So it would make sense if it was a dwarf.
---
STV, desolace, thousand needles. I recommend doing lower level STV quests -&gt; desolace-&gt; 1k needles -&gt; higher level STV quests
---
You can buy 6 Slot Bags for 2s50c from the Vendor...
---
What kind of Guild only has one tank? We have like 5 tanks with an additional 4 people who want to be tanks.
---
Yarp.. its gonna be a total shitshow and PR meltdown!!
---
*grabs popcorn*
---
Got 3 in a row the other day. No joke. The 2 warriors and 1 rogue in my party were very happy.
---
I agree. Thank you for your help and your helpful video :)
---
Customizing the game is almost a game in itself. It can become fun and addicting. I would start with a few simple addons.
---
Go into brs, keep left, go to the first little corner before the mobs on the left, next to a little circle table, stand in that corner, and spam the macro /tar Jed for about 30 seconds to a minute, if he's there, hell show up, if he isn't targetable within that time, leave, reset. 
---
With 10 people doing it, you should NEVER be without a Jed while running ubrs
---
Yeah but u dont actually apply totem buffs to ur weapon. It classifies as a buff
---
More like Unfairbanks amirite?
---
...I'll see myself out, thank you.
---
r/misleadingthumbnails
---
Yeah if you want to do more than being one of the lower dps in pugs you will probably want to be respecing to combat. If you have thrash blade I'd go swords.
---
I'm still using the SM staff at lvl 60, I have most of my pre raid BiS but have never seen an upgrade yet.
---
I literally pug mc and ony every week.
---
It’s good to give the group more info and there’s no cost to doing so.
---
It lets me know I don’t have to counterspell and can switch back to frostbolt role whatever w/o putting CS on a waster cooldown.
---
There were short, sick, and green creatures.  There were mechs.  There was an asshole turtle.  It’s all I can tell you as it was years ago
---
Iron parrot would be a badass name for a pirate themed metal band
---
Warlock, there's less of them so it's easier to get into groups and get geared. Once PVP hits too warlocks are a very fun PVP class.
---
ROFL.  I love that.
---
Scroll down to the 2004 April fool's 
---
https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/games/april-fools/archive-2.html
---
I wouldn't worry, a lot of locks reroll at around 40 anyway to a drain life build. If not that when you are 60 if you raid you will probably switch to one of the ruin specs anyway. 1 pt wrong while leveling is not a big deal, i would try to subtract the missing point from something less vital on the way up the tree though so you you don't end up 1 pt shy of a top level talent you want.
---
Main reason a number of dps warriors dont pummel or disarm is because they didnt spec into tactical mastery so switching stance would reset their rage
---
Personally tactical mastery is probably my 2nd favourite warrior talent after mortal strike because its the only talent that holds my weird playstyle together
---
There's a **lot** different between Vanilla and Classic servers other than the exact hardware they're running on.
---
Remember that server hardware back in 2004 was also substantially slower than it is now.
---
Is their summon interruptable? I thought it wasn't.
---
This is the very first thing I asked my guild when I joined:  Where the pvp nerds at?  &gt;proceed to add every one.    
---
Decent PVPers make PVE a joke.    
---
Decent PVEers may be playing with a driving wheel.
---
Eh. Imagine you play for 2 months, get to 60, get some raids under your belt, maybe some good loot. Then your friend wants to join you, but is unable to create any characters for your faction due to this restriction.
---
I'd be a badass golfer if I put the time in that wow gets.  As is I go from fighting a slice one year to fighting a draw the next year as I just don't play enough to lock in that muscle memory and technique.  My main golfing bro for permanently hurt so that took a big hit on my game also.  Wow is always there waiting though good weather or bad.
---
Where do you solo farm as priest?
---
2 hours for an escort? What you think I'm *made* of money?
---
Is that a beard.  TIL.  Thought it was a dude pointing to his temple and it sparkling.
---
&gt; and you still have to gear which is even worse,
---
You might need to corpse hop into dungeons but the dungeons themselves are isolated from world pvp. The same can be said for gold - you get decent gold just running dungeons tbh (I usually pull like 20g/hr, which isn't as good as dedicated farming, but is good if you're also farming for loot).
---
Each of the 3 major cities has weapons trainers,  and they each teach different weapons,  just go talk to them (or talk to a guard and ask them for directions to the weapons trainer)
---
I as a priest was in uldaman with 2 druids... close to the end one druid remembers he had innervate... the other one didnt even bother to look for it... So overall close to no innervate for me :D
---
You need to equip arrows as well.
---
What's it like being alliance on Skeram? I've been watching us horde camp pretty much every alliance player we can find for a week or so now. I feel bad. Wish the population balance was a bit better. 
---
Sincerely,

---
And you know that the moment that tank has been resurrected by the healer, the first thing he or she is going to do, is pull that gun out of the Hunter's hands, forcibly insert the barrel down said Hunter's throat, and fire.
---
I have only seen one prot warrior in my dozens of dungeon runs at 60 and the one I saw was actually 2 weeks into release in ZF.
---
That look is just so fitting for it I felt.
---
Sorry that it has to be you...but thanks for being you!
---
I have a guildie that makes it his life's mission to camp this quest in his down time. He gets so much hate for it in whispers or on discord, it's pretty funny. He got a couple other rogues together and they shut this escort quest down for an entire Saturday.
---
The Ony thing interests me, how is raid dps for that? I read a story yesterday about a paladin going OOM halfway through phase one , is he just bad? Or can you recover enough mana with phase two that it isnt an issue.
---

---
Yes
---
I genuinely have more fun with chaos vs order and structure I have to admit.
---
I think they are starting to get the message.  The class has virtually disappeared on my server.  I've honestly tried to mourn the loss, but for some reason, the grief just isn't there.
---
I fat finger my X onto C every time so I ended up buying the 2 to the same thing.
---
This needs to be a short clip with bleedingthrough playing
---
FAP, LIP, Invis potions, Swiftness Potions, Fire/Greater Fire protection, Greater Arcane Protection, Elixir's, sell your Xmutes or just use it yourself.
---
I could understand equipping 1. But the 2nd is unnecessary when the save princess quest ring has 18sp. Giving up 500+ gold for 3sp is insane.
---
&gt; definitely won't outperform combat or any warrior spec.
---
_Any_ spec?
---
[That seems like a challenge.](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/032-5050013-050550035032202)

Use the twitch app. You click install and it installs the addon, and you can update them on the fly. Much easier than doing it manually.
---
This, it was fun in vanilla and the beginning of BC however once arena became a thing in BC people started to cry about everything so they had to deal with all those talents a lot more -&gt; balancing a pve game for pvp was a bad idea.
---
I’ve still got to leave alliance dominated zones. I may change opinion once I venture into uncharted territory.
---
It's still amazes me that the servers are actually this laggy. Some, not all, of the PS handled similar numbers better :/
---
I only get the mob back if it goes from them to the healer.  If it doesn't, then I let them tank it; half the time they are able to anyway.  Hunters are a lot stronger in Classic than people realise; and that is actually a big part of the problem, because they overestimate themselves.
---
Thanks for linking this, it's math I wanted but was well above my grade.
---
Wow...always thought it was fingers being snapped
---
It's because you're not 300 Alch yet. You can start churning out Greater Fire Protection and LIP's and they sell 100% of the time for me. Plus selling/using your transmutes.
---
Phenomenally done! One that can be rewatched several times and still catch little things.
---
Lei of the lifegiver is bis for most healers until aq40 (and that offhand has a like 10% drop rate, lei of the lifegiver may never get replaced by most healers). The caster offhands are bis for a very long time. Don Julio's band is amazing, who is going to have two mc rings before AV patch? almost nobody. Don Rodrigo's might be good, I'm not sure, but spell pen is very hard to find, especially on a ring, so it might turn out amazing or bad w/e. 
---
Sure, unstoppable force is going to largely be used by unlucky people or tanks that couldn't get a decent 2h'er, but not all loot needs to be amazing, its a rep reward that you can literally farm in one crazy long weekend, and with so many other amazing items, I don't think it's a probably.  
---
Most importantly, that's just AV loot, the other factions have amazing side grades/slight upgrades for certain classes/specs.

When you write \`/fl h\` do you see help printed? If so, write \`/fl rmi\` to reset minimap button position, it may help.
---
Because when you're mad skilled and winning a 1v3 you just got 3 honorable kills.
---
A raid of 40 wiping an epic enemy raid of 40 in a long fight earned 1 honorable kill, each.
---
What episode is this from?
---
I don't think they've announced any plans, but I would bet they do at some point.  I love the big brain move of transferring to a low population server than complaining about low population, lol.
---
Forming groups with whomever you can scrounge up to go.
---
The very condensed essence of random
---
You just push the Shoot button and a macro of /startattack alternatingly and your character will shoot and stab at the same time. Unfortunately applies the 0.3 second windup on your wand shots though.
---
I think they also give little honor. And it's not like most level 60's put up a good fight either.
---
OMG this is awesome! All the pieces look spot on.. 19 twinks are so nostalgic for me..
---
You're welcome...but I'm still going to stand still, laugh, and watch you die the next time you pull something. :P
---
Do you even lift bro?
---
battle shout can affect 9 targets if you put the warrior in a group with pets, that probably competes pretty well threat wise to bok
---
Sounds so fun..
---
Wait can someone link to this phase 2 in less then a week update?!
---
gnomes are very intelligent so mage fits
---
Let me first state that twinking can be quite expensive.
---
I’ve been twinking for a long time, so a lot of it comes down to knowing what tools different classes have in the different brackets and a bit of the meta that goes into it.  19 will have a lot of hunters rogues priests and Paladins, with hunters being recognized as top of the top tier.  29 has hunters still really high up but rogues close the gap a bit with poisons and casters start getting more dangerous as well, 29 will also see druids and shaman and to a lesser degree hunters zooming around as the only classes with speed increases, Mages get blink at this point so their skill ceiling also goes up. 39 opens wide up with all classes having the tools to be dangerous and very viable.  49 is like 60-lite with pretty much the whole tool box available to all classes on a somewhat smaller scale, 49 is also distinct in that mounts now play a factor.  Just because a class isn’t top tier in its bracket doesn’t mean it’s not viable or fun either.
---
I planned my twinks out from day 1 with plans for what gear I would need and started buying the BOEs I would need as I had the funds.  Experience played a part and so did research, the info is out there but it can be difficult to sift through the junk because things changed through the expansions and you would need that vanilla/classic info.  The pservers didn’t have everything right in regards to this either.
---
If you have more specific questions I would be more than happy to answer them if you want to PM me.
---
That's what everyone says until they realize that after awhile they need raid items to be able to compete vs any semi serious pvp player
---
Gnomes fit in small places. Who would have thought?
---
Can't see any bug here. Certainly not behind that UI. Looks like a neckbeard nest equivalent of a house
---
Yeah, it just amazes me how many people seem to pull aggro then blame the tank. Like, at some point you’re the common denominator, dude. Good dps is responsible for when and where to drop the haymakers, and when to chill for a sec.
---
They usually have natural magic resistance too, in warhammer which warcraft was based off dwarfs have no mages and magic resistance.

---
How do you solo farm as mage with engineering?
---
IMO the disconnected health and mana pools, the mana values being outside of the bar, and the ridiculous amount of clipping when the values change. 
---
I can look past the fact that the pet frame was on top of the action bars because it's likely the first time OP has used MC, I know that's a thing I wouldn't think about when setting my UI up.
---
And this is why reserve groups put it on masterloot when they get to the boss with said reserved item
---
U can jump up on the platform and kill them.  I opened this chest the other day.

You're welcome. :)

You don’t like hearing the same info for 10 minutes every video he posts?

“Guys get to 60, get pre bis, level engineering, farm consumables. Get MC runs as soon as you can. Level an alt if you’re having money issues.”
---
Repeat ad nauseam and farm clicks with catchy thumbnail.
---
Does being a gnome (+15 engineering) change anything in what items are the cheapest/easiest to craft to powerlevel engineering?
---
It takes about 3 days /played with an extremely efficient dungeon group, a less experienced group could easily do it in 5 or less if they followed a proper guide. If you didn't have any obligations, it could most definitely be done, and even if you have other obligations you'll most definitely be able to level and gear up decently within a month and experience phase 2 wPvP some before they probably release BGs early.
---
That’s nothing mate, you’re not even lvl 60 therefore BiS farming is leveling you, not just burning your time:
---
20 runs into HoJ farming - Druid needs it for feral set. Took 29 more runs to get one, got savage gladiator chain on 45th run - woot!.
---
8 runs into UBRS, warlock ninja’s the painweaver band.  15 runs since then and I’ve seen it drop 3 times and lost it each time to a fresh 60 hunter, rogue or warrior (I’m almost full BiS with raid gear etc).
---
5 full clears of MC - no 2hand weapon drops at all.
---
i agree with this upvote, but at least I can get off this server.
---
still man the grind is way too much to do again.
---
What kind of person or group of people spend their time not just reporting for language, but also coming to Reddit to talk about?
---
It's time to grow some thick fucking skin if you can't handle a little bullshit.
---
The non obvious answer is outside of getting pre raid bis and raiding is there isnt much that you need to do in this phase. Its all about setting up your own own goals to keep the treadmill running.
---
meh. idk how else to let blizzard know. The blizzard forums are full of the biggest trolls and wierdos, and they ban u for anything.

That's the key, shit visual comprehension

yep its blizzards fault for letting it get like this

Ion Hazzikostas on suicide watch
---
okay but i would rather just get to choose which horrible server i am on. I doubt much ppl would even use it though, at 30 bux.
---
Well, if you don’t want to dungeon grind, my best advice might be to buy some lesser invis pots from the ah (50s-1g each). They last for 15 seconds and should be able to confuse your attacker or let you run away from them.

And I open on a warlock with voidwalker up

I get so giddy when they sacrifice early

There's no pet to keep me in combat

And they get the full combo

Cheap Shot, kidney shot, blind, sap cheapshot etc

If you can live through the cheapshot kidneyshot

Hold sacrifice until the blind wears off

And keep VW auto attack the rogue during the blind

He might gouge btw

He might waste vanish to restealth

Then sacrifice after cheapshot

Now he can't vanish your coil

This is what I’m getting from everyone. I’m only a level 29 mage but I can see where raiding can get repetitive at times. I didn’t play past level 4 in retail. Is retail any better in terms of combat. It seemed really boring that the mobs didn’t seem to care if you were around them(no aggro) and they didn’t really do much damage.
---
I would just take the mats and teach him a lesson
---
The BIS raiders going into pvp is easy pickings for a hardcore pvpers. We don't have dual spec anymore, a good raid spec is hardly a optimal pvp spec for most classes, and BIS gear largely ignores stam. Such as with Vanilla, pvp geared pvp specs will wipe the floor with raid geared raiders. Unless they have a separate set and constantly change specs ($$$) they'll be easy kills.
---
Good point. Thanks I'll go ahead and try some daggers out. Have distracting dagger as a start

"I don't personally want this particular piece of loot, therefore it's 'garbage'....DeVouT ManTLe Isn'T eVen On ThE BiS LiSt!"
---
I feel you. I'm on the only (to my knowledge) PvP realm that has a ratio that favors Alliance to an extreme degree. Heartseeker is 80% to 20% on average. It's hell here. I left Stalagg as horde because queues sucked, and I wanted a balanced pvp server. Stalagg was too horde heavy just like all other realms so I said it cant be worse here. Well it was worse. Only this time it's reversed where I'm the faction that suffers. I wish Blizz would give us server based BGs instead of cross realm. This would make it worthwhile. It sucks so much theyre going to add cross realm BGs.
---
It is a pretty solid answer to be honest.
---
You think a couple of hundred low poly coprses are gona crash the servers? Lmao
---
Oh I dont mind being off tank or dps i just worried bout getting a raid spot in general but i seem to have maybe worried to much but i am still contemplating maybe i wanna be a healer instead lol
---
That seems like a lot to me if it's all my mats and they just have to click the 'Craft' button or whatever. Can you share insight on why that's an appropriate tip? I don't do blacksmithing.
---
Think of it like this: you're going to be dispelling buffs worth thousands of gold every hour if you're on a competetive server, eventually you'll reach a million. With current exchange rates that's about $700000 or 2 Rolls Royce cars worth of gold that you're dispelling. The evil within me has almost convinced me to level a priset just because I'm thinking of this.
---
I'm a fairly casual player. maybe a little above casual with the amount of play, but i'm by no means hardcore. 
---
I'm a prot warrior, and i'm hoping to main, or at least off-tank permanently as my raid role. 
---
I've been hearing a lot about tanks having to be hardcore to get anywhere, am i just fighting the inevitable spec change to dps, or is it doable?
---
It was a thing in vanilla

Oh that's annoying, good to know though
---
Desolace may be huge but there are tons of quests there and good rewards. The only difference vs flats is that desolace needs to be done in a specific order so you don't end up running around a lot. It's actually quite efficient if you stick mostly to the questing path
---
In shimmering flats you could have an IQ of 50 and it wouldn't matter. If you see a mob, kill it, do that for 4 hours and you'll be done with all the quests
---
It's not just hitting the button, it's the hundreds of gold they spent to get there.
---
It is that weird feeling I have as a shaman healer. It is hard af to find dungeons that I need. But everyone and their mother and their grandparents as well want me for raids. I see every single raiding guild on my server recruiting for Shaman healers as high priority.
---
LOL. never played Vanilla?
---
Paid transfers were in Vanilla.
---
Do some research before you reply,
---
Another person who never played Vanilla.
---
Sigh
---
I spent way too long trying to open this when I was underlevelled for the area.
---
what is this 'main healer'?
---
it would be hundreds of thousands
---
Cause they payed prolly a lot for the pattern. And if u give him only like 1g tip, then it will take  a long time for them to get the money back.
---
Brilliant, just brilliant!
---
&gt; What kind of tank doesn't have rage for cleave?
---
The kind that isn't going to waste a dumb fucking hit damage when I can literally press two keys and get 250 threat on a mob; that's who.  Jesus christ, Cleave is right up there with Heroic Strike for utility while tanking.  Have you every consulted a single fucking article on the matter?  Cleave is bottom bitch.  You're either the dumbest fucking warrior in the game right now, or you need to produce COPIOUS amounts of evidence on just how much extra threat you generate using a rage-dump ability when tanking in lieu of going sunder, tab, white hit, sunder.  
---
Your groups must be fucking misery.
---
&gt; And yeah, I do all this without leaving defensive stance, so the need for tactical mastery when instancing isnt there yet.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; This is why you don't have enough rage for cleave
---
No shithead, I don't have enough rage for cleave because it's a rage dump.  Retaining 25 rage is never going to change that, because I'm going to sunder the motherfucker again, or piercing howl, or refresh battle shout, or demo shout, or fucking any other thing in the game rather than go for "teh rage dump"
---
&gt; I'm on my third warrior
---
&gt; Compares arms warrior to enhancement shaman
---
&gt; Why are you lying?
---
^^  Thinks cleave is a viable threat generator in a dungeon and not a rage dump.  Claims to think you can't draw parallels between Arms capabilities and Enhancement shaman with slow 2 handers.
---
Your right that maybe I *shouldn't* compare them though.
---
Enhancement shaman are actually useful.  You're not.
---
&gt; I dont need an instructional on what abilities to use while tanking, thank you very much.
---
&gt; You obviously do.
---
Ok cleave boy.  Why don't you go dig up the corpse of the EJ forums and see what they think about your fucking 'leet "HURR DURR I CLEAVE ALL DA THINGIES" strategy you miserable fucktard.
---
Yeah we have a bear tank for MC and it's pretty easy unless he has to put on high resist gear and DPS opens early.
---
I would take 5-10gold cause im not greedy, depends how long it takes to meet :)
---
If you're reporting them for language, why would you want to continue talking to them? The ignore is only temporary, it is removed upon relogging.
---
Location is north of Eastern Plague lands in an unnamed region. I basically went swimming to see what I could find, and found this tower
---
I feel like world PVP is gonna be a lot of fun while levelling though, which is why I'm levelling an engineering hunter for that sole purpose \^\^
---
Corrupted Ashbringer come AT ME
---
What spec are you playing and how does your gear look? Warlocks are highly gear dependent so you start off pretty slow. If you're undergeared then no doubt you'll have a bad time. If you're getting 2 shotted by a mage at 3600 hp then he probably has way better items than you or got some really good luck on his crits.  
---
For pets in PvP the rule of thumb is to use fellhunter vs casters and voidwalker vs melees.
---
Also undead rogues are the one thing that will counter you hard. Not much to say there. Warlock is probably the closest thing in the game to a PvP class with no counters, but an undead rogue just happens to be the only thing on that list.
---
If you go down engineering the Shadow Reflector trinket can be annoying as hell. If timed right we can death coil ourselves, and it gives you a 5 second window to kill us after your initial stunlock. It's still warlock favored, but it closes the gap.
---
Vampiric Touch was revolutionary for shadow priests. Awesome role to play - it's a shame they're not so useful in classic.
---
you are a wizard. i just got ganked in STV but i aint even mad
---
Bad luck bud. Though in my guild a 1 is a 101 😅
---
Ye I know.. Green=kill.
---
would it really be significantly better than a thrash in the OH?
---
I've done countless UBRS, and there has literally not once been a priest who wanted to do this boss. The only requests have been from feral druids and rogues who want the leather chest. The devout shoulders have dropped several times and not a single need roll was spent on it. They're not bis, they're bad.
---
Blacksmithing is the most expensive profession to level. It is so extremely expensive that our guild bank actually paid the leveling for our Blacksmith after we realized it will take him 120g just to level 30 skillpoints. 
---
And a lot of the good level 300 recipes are also once again behind a rep grind that costs hundreds of gold.
---
I think applied poisons also classify as a buff though. Notice how whenever you put them on, the icon of the wep you applied it to will show up in the top right along with the remaining duration. WF buff from the totem looks identical, it just says something slightly different when you hover.
---
Well, as in consept of tip, tip is very optional thing, and should show gratitude towards provider of service. Think about all that money he wasted goin up to 300, i suggest, if the BS'er doesnt ask for a tip, give him 1-5 gold, if he is asking for a tip, look for another bs'er.
---
The time of MMO's is over for company's, Everquest is the only thing that will ever come even close to WoW.  WoW was given the resources and people with tender loving care and masochistic tendency it needed to be built and became what it did.
---
Do you truly think a company is willing to invest millions into a potential MMO that could fail?  We saw it with a dozen or so MMO's that everyone said would be the "WoW killer" but that never happened.  Companies are more likely to invest into a phone app game that will net them money for less buck than a true PC game, tis why you see FPS games have "Seasonal packages" it's disgusting.
---
Similar to the one in Desolace
---
Be fair give him a couple copper, thats the equivalent of what he would give in retail
---
How much crit chance do you end up with using this dagger build?
---
I've done black smithing to 270 so far and it's cost around 150gold.
---
From 270-300 its looking like it will cost hundreds more. 
---
They'd also need to specialise in weapon smithing and then specialise again in sword, axe, or mace. Plus the cost of the recipe. So a huge investment on their part.
---
Depends on class. A fresh 60 warrior might do 300-350 dps, but a full prebis warrior can do over 650-700. The biggest jump is from fresh 60 to prebis. A Naxx geared warrior will just do a little bit over double the damage of a pre-BiS geared warrior. for classes like hunters, the increase is a lot less.
---
You can skip the last one of the bug packs, saves you one void incase you need to sac first one. :)

---
Wtf its an axe? I thought it was a green crab claw.
---
Because starting at 60 with 750 gold is significantly better than starting with 200. Jesus chill it’s a damn joke dude.
---
Mind controlling people off of felwood at the horde camp the moment they land so they have to hearth
---
Mind controlling lowbies into mobs and then breaking the mind control so they get aggro and take durability hits.
---
Rotating mind control/sap/poly lowbies in an endless CC loop and drowning players or kidnapping them off to some building where noone can see what we're doing with him.
---
calling people "airy aback t g a a c b"'s in gnomish.
---
Except its not a meme spec.
---
Not committed but been a victim of. I saw an alliance warrior struggling with a pack he had pulled. Knowing the hard time warriors have I, a horde rogue, decided to help him; rather than gank him. He survives. I’m almost dead, turn around to /wave at him, just in time to see his axe smash my face off.
---
Haha nice.
---
"Don't worry, we can save a LOT of money by hosting the Classic realms on our retail cloud services (that rely on sharding to not melt down) and nobody will notice!" 
---

---
Yup
---
Private servers didn't use a system that only works for sharding, Blizzard does.
---
He's 57,what do you mean "at your level"?

Very easy. All horde outside of like 2 or 3 guilds are absolute free kills. It’s a great server for alliance that love PvP.

Takes up a debuff slot aswell. And obviously worse in MH ofc

This has been disproven multiple times, stop regurgitating this utter bs
---
Not necessarily.  They're used for different reasons.  Hunters can solo tribute runs, but groups do it as well.  Its different loot, and provides nice buffs for raids.  I think jump runs are to just skip a lot of stuff and get to other bosses quicker.
---
"Go go go guys, we cant lose a single day of massive queues to coordinate the rest of the year!"
---
Imagine losing it to a hunter. Yayyyy.
---
You should have cast an Innervate on the healer to make it even better.
---
Stacking debuff that increases crit chance with frost spells. Applies up to 5% and is universal to the raid.
---
Oh is this Twitter now?
---
Significant. Let's use dps warriors as an example.
---
Me, hitcapped, with a lot of +crit/str/AP/agi gear.. next to a dps warrior in a pieced together non-bis plate set.
---
None of my yellow attacks miss.  My rage is being used to deal damage almost no matter what, my strength/AP means bloodthirst and other abilities hit a hell of a lot harder, I have lots of rage to the point I need to dump it with other abilities, my high crit chance means I'm setting off flurry procs left and right, which are generating faster hits and more rage, which results in more abilities and more crits.  Flurries and hand of justice procs are popping left and right. 
---
The other guy is missing a bunch of swings generating shit rage, some of that rage he painfully waited for is wasted completely on misses, he isn't proccing much of anything, he's mashing an ability waiting for enough rage to use it.
---
Xd doubt that druid is gonna gank someone again soon
---
You're living in a fantasy land if you think the ratio is anywhere near 1.8:1. It is easily 3:1 and I can't see how anyone who plays alliance on that server would argue that
---
DM:E Lashers.

"PUG" stands for "Pick-Up Group," meaning randoms you pick up to run a dungeon with, usually from spamming in one of the chat channels.  It has become another noun : a "pug" can be the name for the random you picked up, often combined with the class or role, so you'll see someone talk about the "pug mage" or "pug tank." And it's become a verb : "none of my friends are on, so we're pugging a healer" or "I was pugging UBRS the other day and Felstriker dropped and the hunter rolled need and won."
---
Ehh Reddit is just a social media platform.
---
Thx  , felt awesome
---
Man you really fucked up. Just tonight I finished playing at 2.30 after getting a group together for Sunken Temple at 1.00.
---
I could still join a group for ZF or a BRD Arena run if I wanted to right away, both groups were looking for a player.
---
Zandalar Tribe is great.
---
Yeah I love dungeon runs because we don't even get close to the debuff limit so i can bleed away.
---
Someone's mad. They obviously used old servers to emulate the vanilla experience
---
Just surprised they werent healing
---
SM/Ruin is much better as a fresh 60 for sure. And honestly until your raid really needs that extra DPS from DS/Ruin I'd stick with SM/Ruin so you can easily solo things efficiently without having to respec
---
Does anyone know where the picture is from? (Movie, series etc?) 
---
Looks interesting :D
---
I don't think anyone is really willing to take a SL lock raiding, so you're kind of stuck either paying huge gold to respec twice a week or like most people you'll pvp with your raiding spec. SM / ruin is a good compromise.
---
Why does every world pvp fan roll horde then complain the servers are unbalanced?
---
Its really not that unbalanced to be fair, you just suck if you think it is
---
i think you’d be fine if you find a guild looking to raid but not hardcore into progression. the reason it’d be tough otherwise is there are only so many tank spots to fill in a raid and a serious guild is going to want the same people tanking so they can gear them up as having tanks geared up is very important. if a guild has already established their core raiding group it’d be tough to find your way in as a tank.
---
Quel'Serrar?  If you want it so badly, at least learn how to spell it.
---
thanks for looking into this gideon, definitely will end up linking this to someone at some point.
---
Exactly my thoughts.
---
it does in the sense that things will stay orange/yellow for longer for you, so you can craft lower level stuff for a bit longer and get a good benefit from it compared to races without the +15
---
No changes boys.
---
The only change now is that BRM will become the lagfest that was Tarren Mill.
---
Not clear the whole dungeon, but basically Arena/Anger/Golem then all the bosses on the way to Emperor.  Its a pretty quick run, but I got most of my T1 gear already so that plays a huge part in this.  Grab all the greens/blues that no one needs and you walk out with 25g easy.
---
Actually if you have at least 2 or 3 frost mages then arcane FB spec is highest raid boss damage. You can utilise other people's frost stack and get access to arcane power to burn hard on every boss in execute phase.
---
Have a look at Judgement's guide, as someone already mentioned it's been built for a paladin.  
---
Alternatively I have a speedrunning guide that I normally sell, but happy to send you a copy for free to help a bro out.
---
A rogue will destroy a raid spec'd mage.
---
I'm arcane/frost and I can destroy casters, but a well-played rogue will eat me alive. It's the ciiiiircle of liiiiiiife . . .

The prophecy tells of N'zoth's arrival in 15 years! &lt;Old Gods&gt; is a casual raiding guild that focuses on fostering a small community of mature and relaxed players. We laugh when we wipe. We cheer when we are victorious. We recognize that WoW is a game and that life (*usually*) comes first. Most of our members are early-career professionals or graduate students. Although smaller than many guilds, our player base is active. Members frequently run higher-level dungeons at all hours of the day. We have established a collaborative environment where members help each progress. When not raiding, many of our members engage in World PvP or level alts together. We have a lively Discord with conversations ranging from Dungeons and Dragons to oceanography. 
---
**Recruiting:** 
---
* We are currently recruiting level 45+ players looking for a relaxed and fun raiding experience to join our core raid group. We have availability for all classes and all roles. No prior raiding experience required. 
---
   * We currently have a raid team of about 25 members.
---
   * We welcome all class specs regardless of whether the spec is optimal.
---
   * **High-Demand:** (1) Tanks (regardless of class), (2) Holy Priests, (3) Resto Druids, (4) Mages, (5) Shadow Priests, (6) Boomkins, (7) DPS Warriors.
---
* We will also accept any player, regardless of level, simply looking for like-minded people to spend time with.
---
**Amenities:** 
---
* Guild website to manage raid sign-ups and track information.
---
* Guild bank.
---
* Discord.
---
**Raid Info:** 
---
* **Mondays and Wednesdays from 8:30PM-11:30PM Server Time.** We currently raid with a partner guild, &lt;Wipes Happen&gt;.

---
I don’t see why not. MC isn’t hard enough that every player needs to be 100% optimal. You get practically the same +15% shadow damage buff with DS that you get with SM.
---
I’m not saying SL is as good at PvE as SM/Ruin is, just that playing SP in PvE is kind of a meme, just like playing SM/Ruin in PvP.
---
It's very very heavily nerfed.
---
If you want to get Exalted with another faction, prepare to obtain a lot of Runecloth.
---
I don’t mind how it works so long as it’s one of the following:     
---
1. When BGs come out, the market is over saturated and I can get one for less than 100g.    
---
2. By the time BGs come out I can actually afford the 300g each they’re currently being listed for.
---
I've looked into this some time ago and a semi-serious search online shows that these so-called missing parts on the proverbs where modern additions and not part of the initial proverb. In some cases the original even meaning the opposite than the "full" version (like blood is thicker than water).
---
Sorry to disappoint you!
---
Yeah then it will turn out to be like in Battlefield (or similar games) just with longer time period. Your friend end up trying to do character every day until maybe after week (or month?) balance has finally shifted so he can create that character.
---
Idea of limit is nice but it just wouldn't work very well.

Yeah these servers are a joke. I don't see Blizz doing much about it since it affects a really  small part of the pop (people who do organized PVP)
---
It's unofficially called 'Northern Lordaeron' if you're looking it up: https://wow.gamepedia.com/Northern_Lordaeron
---
Most speculation is usually based around the fact that Quel'Thelas - which is right next door to this - was initially intended to be a zone in vanilla, but was eventually pushed back to being part of TBC, and that the tower might be a leftover remnant from that.
---
Lmao ao generous giving out 100g in retail , that 's like what you get for farting and vendoring trash from a quest over there
---
Reroll alliance dumbasses.
---
Feels good?  They handled it pretty well honestly, not what I thought, but pretty well
---
i’d just follow the guides and whatever they tell you to go up to just go up 15 more. i don’t think there will be much of a difference pattern-wise but i could be wrong
---
TIL people are always high af
---
What do you mean can't do any aoe? One WW is enough to get massive threat.
---
Yeah but farming gold as a warrior isn’t the best. While trying to buy pots, level armorsmithing (throwing gold out the window), repair bills.
---
I guess I really enjoy the first few zones. Started out with a hunter actually, but hunters are in my opinion fkin boring, and it had a great name, so I deleted it at level 24.
---
Hahahahahahahaha
---
you dont have to lock it, just put a queue instead. problem solved.
---
Cool! Thanks for the response
---
Maybe you already know this, but you can play retail up to level 110 with the subscription you already have.  I think you even have access to class trials, so you could try out different classes at level 110 to get a feel for the game at high level, at least for solo content.
---
I'm telling people since month that its never going to work. The servers are just too big. A few hours ago I tried to farm some Arcanite at 0430 on a fucking wednesday morning ...even then it was completely overfarmed.
---
always thought that this and the red one were like the circular saw or something
---
Birdman was "average" at its best. It had almost no capabilitiy of capturing the watcher unless you are super into artsy self pity. First rule of good movie, (like a book or any Story telling device) is absorbing your watchers, and it simply couldnt do that. If it was a movie made absolutely same about an Office worker or engineer or someone no one would even care about the movie. It just freaking spoon fed the Artist ego.
---
Now read again all the guys you wrote? Great picking whatever suits your Needs. Other than Edward Norton for 1 movie, MCU never had start power leading, the most famous ones are supporting actors with drasticly less Screen time. The stars of MCU which build it are RDJ, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans. If you wanna.
---
1 star playing a 3 Minute Screen time in 5th movie of the serious doesnt mean it has star power.
---
It's still a shit talent. Doesn't change. And has nothing to do with "following bis lists/specs".
---
Not dead bodies.  This is the new Naxx floor decorations for STV.
---
5-10% of mats costs if its a rare recipe u cant learn from a trainer, 0% if its a guildie
---
I was Mc attuned and had Valor shoulders at 56 haha
---
Damn which one? I did scholo but don't think anyone knew about this.
---
I quit right after they opened the dark portal. So everything from to current.
---
Can you not stand on top of them and kill them like every other evade stuck mob?
---
That's a talent you don't wanna lose, trust me. Healing is no fun without it. 
---
I was triple specced for a short while, with only one point in that talent. It's a huge difference.
---
Yeah i hate it when people don't carry me
---
I remember watching that movie but don’t remember much cause it was forever ago... there’s my 2 cents.
---
Kinda smells
---
No love for the enhance shamans r1 earth shocking all the casters :(
---
I disagree u can spec Fury/Prot and still be okay. A lot of my gear is plate with 1% hit/crit, more agility, this only works if ur healers don’t suck though. Also if u want to be an off-tank. Just have to watch if damage gets scary you’re gonna have to put ur shield on, on the fly assuming ur dual-wielding. Fury/Prot is so much more fun to play then deep Prot. IMO
---
I like to compare 2-3 guides side by side, as some make more sense than others. If you're crafting item X (material cost 5 s / craft) until skill level 100  and doing item Y (material cost 35 s / item) until 120 you obviously should go for the cheapo item as long as your gnome racial allows until it doesn't reliably skill up. That is, unless you need a certain number of item Y to progress further down the line - hence look through the (multiple) guide(s) beforehand. You are an Engineer, do some research!
---
Its pretty useless, do not recommend buying them unless u swim in gold
---
heheh *arm thing
---
But you'd have to rebalance everything as players would just be way to powerful.
---
The bit I agree with here is "separate out the pvp game entirely", since it's no doubt impossible to balance classes for PvE content and competitive Arena PvP at the same time
---
You're not alone broski. I do the same but I flake out around level 23.
---
It's adding up. Sure, one item on one person with 6mp5 isn't changing much. 1 item on 10 ppl already gices 60mp5. If the dds and tank also make such "small" expensive upgrades it can add up a lot and can help to progress bwl more efficiently.
---
I agree that it's a small upgrade for one and by far not necessary. Its the same for enchants. But it's often not just one item. There can be 2-3 such items and overpriced enchants and in the end it adds up and can make the difference.
---
It's not needed, ture. But it's not useless.
---
I wonder if it has anything to do with the personality of the players that choose the priest class. I don't consider priests to be the douchecanoe class that mages and rogues are
---
No private server has done this lol. At least any popular one hasn't.
---
This is horrible, theres no way anyone will want to do these massive battles like this
---
I've always preferred speccing deeper into affliction, but thought I'd try out ds/ruin (minus imp life tap and ds) at 57 to get the feel of it. After farming for 5 minutes I almost hearthed to org to respec again but after a while it started to grow on me. Mainly for the instant demon summon in pvp situations. Think I'll probably go back to SM though as it seems way more efficient solo.
---
k
---
Diabetes and classic? Sure, why not
---
I've OT mc as fury dps and been fine...
---
Paladin
---
That's some serious doomsday stuff there
---
Run some instances. I reran ZF till I was 50, it’s fast and good exp. once 50-51 you can go do the blasted lands quests for the buffs, or start in Ungoro or searing Gorge or Azshara.
---
Save BRD till 52, then run it till 55. There are loads of groups for BRD. Once 55 get the Ony attunement quests for LBRS and start that early. Should be plenty to get you up to lvl 56-57.
---
Then there is Burning stepps, WPL, EPL, Winterspring.
---
B-BuT eLitEsT 60s!!!1

if you don't like it don't play it

what is this comment?

Wait, you can kill people in Nesingwary's camp? I thought it's like in Booty Bay
---
Stranglethorn Vietnam

Think it is Band of Brothers.
---
Mara princess runs are harder on gnomes because of the swim thing unless you bring nogenfogger. I died a few times getting the hang of avoiding the deeper water.
---
I agree with opening transfers from high pop servers to low pop but paid transfers to any server is a horrible idea, Faerlina already has Queues of at least 2k people at 00:00 am everyday, once Phase 2 hits it will be a shit show again and with paid transfers it will only get worse.
---
Image reminded me of Shazzrah, some hordes are so confident they straight up AFK at entrances.
---
Getting to instances is a pain (2 deaths getting there is considered good) but in world pvp, 9 out of 10 hordes suck when going 1v1,or even 2v1. Extremely easy to get away, kill or at least take one of them with you.
---
My theory is that the numbers advantage has made the hordes too cocky and they have forgotten what to do without the numbers advantage.
---
Okay...i guess im wrong, just sharing my personal experience is all
---
I actually agree. A pure dps class being stronger than a hybrid makes sense.
---
Lmao that was the best "....." at home Ive seen yet
---
Aight, I'll just get my pve *and* pvp gear real quick. Surely it can't take that long? Especially for classes like shaman who are pretty much forced to re-specc for every pve-event if they even want a raid spot at all.
---
Spread the word about threat add-ons in your guild, friend group and pugs. Part of a tank's responsibility is educating the public.
---
Check the ah before selling it. On my server they’re at least 400 g
---
Healing in MC has just been trying to snipe heals for the charts anyway
---
Noone thinks that, and I did not say that anywhere in my post.
---
Bro you’ve got 23 days played in 2.5 months and act like it’s gonna take you a year to hit 60 again lmao. 
---
You enjoyed being Horde on private servers with a (still large) 60:40 advantage and now you’re finally getting punished for rolling the chimp faction and not having anybody to 5v1. owN
---
Just wait til he joins raid groups that need instead of greed on items that sell for 100g+ on AH.
---
And I fully understand ! It is mostly a lot of nostalgia from my side :)
---
What's that got to do with it?
---
The game engine still has to do it all and it's running locally on your machine. If the engine isn't built to handle that, it's gonna run badly regardless.
---
Thanks a lot random stranger! Cheers and truly thanks for helpin answer my questions
---
Grazy rage gen
---
I never understood the gnome hate
---
The bat handler is in Southwest, think of it like Southwest Airlines for your flight. That’s how I always remember it
---
That would be funny. But from what Ion has said lately, I think he got the message too. It would be interesting if there was a culture shift going on there, realizing they don't need to constantly reinvent the wheel, and throw out good design.
---
Like the covenant system, it almost seems like an improved upgrade to the class hall idea. Except any class can join any covenant. We'll see, I didn't go to BlizzCon to get my hands on it.
---
What didn't you enjoy about your Druid?
---
Anyhow, Honor is coming out in 6 days - you will see more world PvP action (ganking) in all contested zones, for sure, if playing on a PvP realm. 
---
If you can live with that, no, it's not too late - far from it.
---
You really only need 5 people, don't even need to be that geared.
---
We had a semi-geared tank and healer but all dps were putting out 200+ dps and runs went smoothly.
---
Finally, a person who is able to understand my genius (lul). I maintain, it is very logic for me haha
---
Ill take the free kill please.
---
That's like saying everyone has a tough time finding Mankrik's wife. Because, you know, we did 15 years ago too, right?
---
You’ll never get my character. 
---
Elitist scum
---
More complicated was a good thing ffs
---
Pretty much alliance on most servers
---
Im on the same server, are you Alliance too?
---
its actually disgusting how accurate that fury warrior description is
---
I think they've realized they've lost alot of older blizzard fans and are trying to win them back.
---
WoW classic being obvious.
---
The D4 panels emphasized how dark they want to make the game, and they're bringing back D2 classes.
---
They're constantly reiterating on what older design choices they liked.
---
Who knows ultimately how serious they are.. but it's interesting to see them trying to win back the faith of older fans who feel jaded by later designs.
---
You are awful if your raid spec had spirit tap lol
---
First compliment I got was how on point I was with my sheeps. Still get praises when I can spot it and sheep :D
---
Awesome
---
I use it a lot to help LOS too.
---
In MC there is like 2-3 pieces for  spriests, rest bis gear is boe greens or from dungeons.
---
Our guild has been doing DM since it came out and we've only gotten 2 books, our total runs will be over 1000 now. Maybe we're just unlucky but the book is rough to farm and you gotta get lucky if you don't want to buy it.
---
And if the BS asks for a "tip", to word he **really** is looking for is "fee". I hate how people are misusing "tip" in-game nowadays. They should get their account locked until they have proven they know the differences between those and will use them correctly.
---
Guys only want one thing and it is disgusting.
---
falling lately, started at 300g and is at 150-200 atm
---
My guild and I usually do 5man rend runs :) Way less competition for gear that way ;)
---
Bloodsail Buccaneers. PVE, RP but most don’t. Friendly players, lists still leveling and on alts.
---
it also looks like the expanding brain meme
---
Yesterday I /waved a ?? Rogue that was running beside me. He then spent the next 30 minutes following me around, sapping, cheapshotting, applying crippling poison and stealing my mobs.
---
0/10 wont wave again.
---
I thought that was only for rogues because of poisons.  For warriors I was under the impression that it didn't matter.
---
I've really had a blast in the hinterlands/searing gorge horde side, finding a solid group of 5 and blasting through those elite /big grind quest hubs. Although I've climbed jinthalor enough times this last week for a life time helping people out lol.
---
Should be ok tbh. Raid gear is oberrated. School chest is so so good f. Ex. So a lot og the currently Best gear is blue dungeon gear. On My warlock I use green shoulders for raids over tier 1 shoulders ex. Which is why I love Classic. So go for it m8
---
Elaborating on the difficulty rating - West and North (full run) are pretty much on par when comparing the most difficult trash. 
---
In West you will encounter some packs with 3-5 ghost like mobs (you will know them when you see them) - don't get too close; they do an AoE silence. Some of the mobs (I forget the name) do an AoE ranged damage spell that can't really be avoided; you have to burn these down, which means no Blizz but single target damage, as high as you can manage. Also, some casts here are interruptable - help out your healer by doing so when possible, he will be grateful. Those lead on to Magister boss, who's Mindblast and Mindflay deal a shitton of damage and can both be interrupted. There are also invisible pats here; be mindful of those. Upstairs, hug the Hunter boss once engaged - like a regular hunter, she does very little while you're inside her dead zone. She can however use the one ability that rains down arrows on an area, and she can target herself with it - people have to move out quick as it does a lot of damage. 
---
North, towards the end of the dungeon, has packs with 2x Ogres and 2x Felguards if I recall correctly; using CC (poly) here is important (having Lock as well is therefore good), but burn down the Felguards asap and use silence when appropriate. There are also invisible pats here which are the highest prio; they summon two voidwalker-looking mobs, and should be killed asap. These voidwalkers are not your regular harmless blueberry type, they do a nasty AoE spell that can wipe the party if they both get off a cast and you're fighting other mobs. 
---
Other than that, since you are level 58, be very mindful about aggro range. In East (the easiest of the 3, by far) you can interrupt some triple-ent pack mobs from casting a heal, other important things don't come to mind. Use AoE for the packs with non-elite plants once the tank has some aggro, keep Nova/blink/survival stuff ready in case you pull aggro on them.
---
I appreciate you taking the time to write out such a detailed response. Thanks for the information, I'll probably be going to mercenary rout in the end.
---
I dont know, if I am thinking back to vanilla Tarrens Mill was never different. Lagging like hell, more like a dia show than anything else. #nochanges I think
---
There are a couple of things that really don't click for me in the argument you raised, please help me understand:  
---
1. Isn't honor stored on character, or is it account-wide? Why would one gank at level 20-30 when the gear is level 60?
---
2. Not counting non-PvP characters (bank alts, disenchanters), the amount of level 60 players is by far the highest compared to other levels. Level 60 characters are usually found in the endgame zones because the endgame zones provide the best drops or contain mobs needed to grind reputation with endgame factions. In my opinion corpse camping someone can be detrimental to honor gaining tempo unless the population is really low, I think it's more worth it to just move on to the next victim as fast as possible. Also, level 60s contain the highest amount of ranked characters, which provide even more honor. When one gets the jump on someone 90% the victim is dead unless they have some crazy cooldowns ready, because usually they don't have the consumables ready or aren't even prepared. Why gank 30s when unprepared 60s or high 50s are also pretty easy, provide more and are more numerous?
---
You are a shining beacon of huntarkind. Light our path!
---
I see you've attempted the robot chicken quest D:
---
And those people only complained because the game has lost its soul but they didn't know it yet, so they thought it was something else.
---
All comes back to Blizzard.
---
I learned this a month ago, and I've been playing classic on private servers for over five years.
---
I started sobbing to myself for a few hours
---
lol retail was made for people like you. i dont mean to sound insulting, they literally made changes to these things to fit your...playstyle or whatever.
---
Charge &gt; defensive stance &gt; demo shout&gt; get sundering. Just put 1 sunder in skull Sunder the others a few times the other mobs but get ready to taunt the skull because they will jack agro. Then taunt and sunder that mob as much as needed but at this point if the dps is effective it will be shortly after dead. Then start sunders on X again.
---
Hello! looking for leveling friends or just social joking on chat by times, playing with troll rogue currently lvl 10 on EU Pyrewood Village. Give me PM if interested :)
---
In our guild we decided to farm it for the last few rogues that needed it. In a total of 13 runs we got 4 HoJ.
---
The group that did not want to bother doing jed fishing.
---
Or the raid leader that invited everyone who sent him a whisper immediately
---
happens everytime
---
SM/Ruin is fine for PvP. Most PvP will be in Zergs or will be unfair. So you can't balance your build around fucking 1v1, that will never happen.
---
SM/Ruin is the only really usable build unless you don't do PvE.
---
Arena was a huge mistake. Nothing under 5v5 should have been allowed.
---
Hell yeah dude! I play an undead male character and I too am sick af
---
Howl of Terror
---
Now we have a party
---
I also wondered... Why the hell would it be a beak?? Thanks for enlightening me!
---
Lay on Hands, if the tank still dies - grab a shield and become a tank yourself :)
---
I two manned with two rogues. 5 runs in 25min usually. Only a couple wipes, but always hit the instance cap anyway. In total it took us 162 runs to get us both one.
---
&gt; Balancing the talent system was a nightmare though, each expansion made it more complicated.
---
The lesson to learn from that is to recreate what made it good, and ignore that minority that whines. Because no matter what they did to talents over 15 years... people NEVER stopped whining.
---
So what did they gain in the end? 15 years of modifications, only for half of us to beg them for the original version, thats currently powering a shitload of subs and thriving..
---
Ohhh the irony. The game was rigged from the start it seems.
---
Ok, only level 35 currently, and the build I was following didnt give CoR yet. Cool tyvm for info!
---
Yeah, I'm just worried people on unbalanced servers will flock here and fuck it up.
---
it shouldn't be opt-out, it should be opt-in. Why should I have to create an account and go through some bothersome ritual to prove ownership of my character, just to opt out of a "service" that I never wanted nor signed up for in the first place? This is just like all those free newspapers filling up my mailbox every week
---
Blizzard should be embarrassed.
---
I had one druid tank (for brd) so far telling me he wanted to roll on healing gear, but tbh most seem to have switched to resto already, which makes finding a tank for brd stupidly hard.
---
10%
---
I would wait with soul link until you get better gear, it sucks to raid with SL.
---
I am at 4,1k hp with SM ruin and i shred the most ppl.
---
And when you chose to go SL make sure you go with nightfall and full fel concentration instead of shadowburn. You should aim to go SL when u have 3set bonus from t1(15%extra life drained)
---
And when u are SL u eat the rogues stun, coil him afterwards, dot him up and start spamming searing pain to bait an kick from him, and when he kicks you drain life without almost any pushback because of 5/5 fel concentration.
---
Against Casters you wont win without felhunter, bind silence and dispell to yourself, dispell all Novas, mages do alot more damage when you are frozen.
---
Was this on Bloodsail Buccaneer?
---
&gt; PvP servers are dying 
---
Actually they've been increasing in numbers.
---
&gt; not in quantity of players, but in quality
---
How did Blizz measure that? Oh, it didn't, this is according to your veeeeeery narrow perspective.
---
Not stupid, just forgetful.
---
Yeah you can, theres no guards so get killing.
---
I did my first ony as a priest and t2 head dropped, I rolled a 2 so that was fun :c
---
is there an overview where you can find these translations?
---
but then you're alliance.
---
I assume you are on a pvp server?
---
If you can solve this networking problem for the gaming industry, there are quite literally millions of dollars just waiting for you.
---
?
---
fury rotation is quite involved.  make sure you have enough rage for bt and ww when tbey come off cd, queue heroic strike and unqueue when main hand about to land to get hit bonus to offhand, time cds to get maximum dps from execute phase.
---
If you gave me the plans too I wouldn't want the tip lol. Otherwise between 1-5 gold seems reasonable to me. If you are a guildie I also wouldn't expect any.
---
If you are in it for the long haul aka naxx then get exalted with argent dawn so you can get in to naxx for free. Also you should get the quests done with the hydraxion water lords to get a quintessence every week for your guild running MC. Costs nothing once you get the quest chains done. Do you have forgrings seal? That is a long quest chain and gives a great ring that isn’t replaced for awhile for healing. Work on exploring every inch of the map and getting all of the FP and also work on getting all keys for every instance as the key ring is coming soon with phase 2. (Allegedly) do you have truefaith yet? If not I would that’s bis until full set of T2 in BWL. Also go for mats needed on the hide of the wild. Personally I would also level a mage to farm gold for mats for raiding consumes. Raids like aq40 and naxx take a ton of consumes trying to progress through and you will run through gold.

---
My guild has two raid groups that run at the exact same time... that'll be a fun debate over world bosses.
---
Because you don't need that. Sure you can snitch a little bit more healing by going full resto. But resto tree has a lot of useless talents for raids. I.E Tranquility is pretty much dead ability so not worth to put talents into that. 
---
Reason why a lot of resto players want to have somewhat hybrid spec is that you want to be viable in outdoors as well. Resto druid is not bad for farming. Especially balance tree offers more melee damage and more spell damage. This is one of reasons why Moonglow is quite effective. In current content you don't need mana efficiency of Moonglow spec. Most bosses in MC die in minute.
---
Having spec that sacrifices some raw healing to get more damage saves a lot of money. Respec for raids is not required and outside of raids you can do outworld content.
---
No one forces this though. On current content going full resto is fine. You are not lacking with healing if you don't pick talents from another trees. But like said putting all points to resto is just waste of druid's potential.
---
I am.
---
I sometimes wonder who’s running the show at blizzard.  How many of the original devs are still there?  I mean, this isn’t a new problem.  It was the same in BC on some servers, plus they had the low pop problem too.  
---
YET, they still managed to fck it up, again.  I just don’t get it.
---
I love to have a good rogue in my party. Those that know their cc, interrupts, distract and whatever else you have that can make a run so much smoother and turn a potential wipe into a small hiccup you barely notice.
---
Yeap!
---
Please do!
---
It's something of a sick fantasy, I'd love to try it, but as there's nothing to enforce the rules... I'd never stick to it.  Must admit, I'd roll PvE for it :P
---
Yo SAME!

Get another druid to cast thorns on himself and watch porn on the side while he autoattacks to be your bootleg ret pally
---
way i did it was 2 rogues. you stealth through, fight angerforge on the staircase, then jump down around 50% when he spawns adds so they have to run further around. the rogue that does the most dps you want to be combat swords with riposte, as they'll be tanking for the most part. and riposte procs like crazy with the initial adds hitting you. also greater stoneshield pots help a lot as they raise armor by 2000. at 50% you have to burst him down before the adds overwhelm you, so you save adrenaline rush and thistle tea for that phase. after you kill him loot and vanish.
---
I messed up and didn't go Gnomish first and went for Goblin egineering so I didn't get the Gnomish Death Ray for my rogue. Should I drop egin and relearn it and learn gnomish for it? I only have about 400g rn and still no epic mount but I want the trinket for PvP
---
&gt;and by cc i mean pick pocket

People don't crap on druids, they're literally preferred over warrior tanks in 5 man for their AoE aggro.
---
Mine hits for 39 with 3/3 Imp Thorns and Cenarion 3 piece. I also wear my Naglering for 3 arcane thorns and my Cloak of Flames for 5 fire thorns when I know there is a rogue around with ill intent. Still trying to get Essence of the Pure Flame off of Rag to hit a nice round 60 Thorns-type damage. Anyways, fighting a rogue, my thorns dmg accounts for about 40% of the damage dealt to them for me.
---
This has always been the case, I think it may have been usable on private servers? which is why where the confusion comes from. 
---
It's use in the twinking bracket is for defensive setups such as a priest with evo blade/that 1h healing mace.

Ngl. I love looting a chest, leaving some cheese then seeing someone else fight their way to it, only to loot some cheese.  Little rats.

That bot is probably richer than all of us.

Looks like someone giving a handjob
---
I was in a SFK group and rogue opened an locked chest that contained a blue boe, he didnt pick it up and started to ask group if some1 needs it. Discussion was set up and after 5minutes the chest despawned nonlooted so I dont think this is true.

Imagine coming to Reddit and writing in all upper case, expecting Blizzard to listen to you!? There are official forums for this dude. Perhaps a well worded post with proper feedback and less attitude on an official forum will receive better attention. Just a thought...

None... But I spent nearly 4 hours on the escort part of in dreams as the circumstances of the quest are horrible. I would also say that jail break can take forever off you keep falling.
---
Warlock is amazing, I've played melee since TBC and I decided to main a warlock in Classic. And I'm loving it, sure we cant compete with mages, warriors and rogues or even hunters right now. But later on when we get the hitgear we need, we will start to compete with other classes more and more :) 
---
I would definetely recommend Warlock!

Indeed. I see a lot of people complaining about the problem, but no one offering viable solutions. Keeping in mind there's a very vocal group that want #nochanges that Blizzard has to tread carefully around.
---
The big brain zero survivability build, thanks I hate it.
---
You gave druids a disservice mentioning only forms. Innervate is a huge lifeline in dungeons. Battle res is also very good. 
---
For sure swapping to bear to tank is good but how about if you're the bear tank and you pop out, warstomp, regrowth yourself and innervate your healer then go bear again.
---
Good list tho ands I agree

Problem is I doubt non-SL locks can survive a Rogue's initial stunlock opener without a sac, at his gear level at least. SL might be the only way - 40% damage reduction during the opener and he will prob be able to survive it.

---
First of all, a point we've had to hammer home in the private server community and now appearently need to in Classic community as well: 15 years old memories are not evidence or proof in any sort of way. Memories are incredibly fallible and people have all sorts of weird agendas that skew them either purposefully or no. For the sake of the argument I'll accept that Jed fishing was a thing, I still don't think that one thing validates the idea that you can accurate use vanilla behaviour as a model for how people will be behaving in Classic.
---
Yeah againts TOS apparently, no one seems to know/care though. And I mean blizz probably isnt going to ban anyone over it anyways.

&gt; If you could get about 10-15 druids to have an innervate rotation on an elemental shaman they would pump out some serious damage!
---
P.S. Going OOM is an outdated notion pushed by players not willing to put the effort to resolve it. Mana issues have been solved years ago... A good ele shaman should never go oom or the need for Innervate.

I'll talk it over with the guys upstairs, but I can't make any promises. The blacklist overlords are fickle with who deserves to be put on it.

---
You would be decent, not as strong as a Swords rogue but enough to hold your own.
---
If you're planning to raid as daggers later you should try to snag a Mugger's Belt or Distracting Dagger, and use 6/8 Shadowcraft. The proc on the set bonus works really well with dagger spec
---
Why won't people just keep this sub about classic we don't care about your kids
---
I mean, some people do make 80g/hr. Sure.
---
What you do is wait until TBC when rogues get Cloak and then warlocks run screaming in the other direction from you.
---
cheap shot on skull because tank should ignore skull, especially if skull is a caster.
---
&gt; Feral tanks can pump decent threat if you come to raids with buffs and manual crowd maces etc. The issue is if maul is parry or dodged it can set you back big time as you really dont have other abilities on use that generate as oppose to warriors who constant have globals to use.
---
This is where the big boy shaman tank come into play! Constant threat through Rockbiter/Windfury and Earth Shock. Was surpassing typical feral druid threat yesterday on my Raid Shaman Tank.
---
Yes it is. It creates entire copies of the world on the same server. Each copy of the world has a maximum player cap, and people get shunted between those copies as necessary to avoid overcrowding in zones.
---
Unless you want to claim each layer takes a chunk of total player capacity (which is wrong, because it would mean a 3-layer server having worlds with only 33% of the players it can handle in it) then layering increases capacity.
---
you dont seem to be familiar with the game or common sense.  but, enjoy the downvotes lol
---
I guess I should've seen the gatekeeping coming and just not used specific numbers for the kill times.
---
So you are the mage heh? :D
---
Next level shit.
---
nah you're good man you dont need it

my suggestion is to always group up when you go around in contested zones and please join PVP RAIDS TO HELP!

When it happened about 10 people from the raid said they were going to put the guild on the almighty “blacklist,” and I’ve heard the term thrown around plenty. I went to sleep, woke up pissed, and I want to know where to go as far as 3rd party networks to make it clear the guild running raid pugs are scummy with loot.
---
Where are you farming 40g/hour as a warrior?
---
Wait, did you actually tank the boss?
---
In any case, I use [Global Ignore List](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/global-ignore-list) to keep certain people out of my groups, but that's more of a personal blacklist and there is no feature to share or synchronize data directly.
---
But the timers I have on my PC are great lol
---
I’m in a semi hardcore guild and have had MC on farm since week 2. (Don’t mean to brag, sorry). So we’re all pretty well geared and are looking forward to form groups and raids to do world pvp. 
---
Yes we’ll probably be outnumbered but FAPs, sapper charges and a shit ton of Mages will hopefully give us a fighting chance!
---
I'm afraid you've just created an army of individuals who leave a piece of alterac Swiss in the chest for lulz

What's slow about it? You have to be careful on the trash near Jed, but everything about Rend encounter is timed anyway.
---
If they  releaze phase 6 before that expansion, it would be beyond rushing
---
I too am excited for lack of skill PVP at 19.
---
Tldr; dont do pug raids.
---
I ask for an oil in chat if the healer thinks I missed it so I can help save the party.  I get so excited when I can use things other than my two button attack in dungeons, oh healer died, battle Rez/innervate switch to bear let's go, that should be why you play druid to do more than one thing when it hits the fan
---
No I played dps but made it clear I rolled this character as a troll warrior with the intent to tank. I left on a month long vacation and came back yesterday and an way back in the tank line for my guild so re rolled to arms/fury.

&gt; I know people will say if you want to play paladin tanks just play retail, which is already what I do. But I can't help to feel that the design of not having paladins as viable tanks in raid content a bad one.
---
Paladin raid tank is viable, you mean optimal. 
---
Hell, shaman tanks are viable...
---
FAP? is that what I think it means haha
---
Arena in itself was no big problem, it was more of a "little bit more balanced gurubashi arena" at least in my opinion, the problem was taking a big MMO Player vs Monster Story World and balancing everything towards 3vs3 so 6 people feel like they have a kinda fair battle (which they never had, forums where always full of "this is op, that is op, this class is too strong etc. no matter what) while the million of players have to deal with frequently changed abilities for the sake of nerfing them for pvp.
---
Since Arena was the trigger for this I can see why you say Arena itself was the mistake thou
---
agree with all except warlocks
---
human hunter makes much more sense than warlock
---
But that trajectory of achieving godlike power doesn’t make sense in the context of actual gameplay.
---
If you’re one of the greatest ever heroes your faction has ever seen then why is most of your time spent doing busywork for random citizens? How does that make sense when you’re getting ganked? 
---
Playing the ultimate hero feels extremely contrived to me in multiplayer games.
---
But muh pvp racials
---
just hit 60 ill get a new, just dont have one yet. not that i am choosing to use vanquisher because I think its the best. just gotta find a better. i was leveling with thrash and vanquisher just hit 60 and got mirahs
---
&gt; If we're going to make paladins viable tanks then are we making shamans viable tanks too? Or do alliance just get an extra tank because some pally thought he was a warrior?
---
Paladin raid tanks are viable. Shaman Raid tanks are viable.

---
&gt; I like this idea for classic plus content. They should be able to address these issues through gear and consumables. Maybe a class quest for a trinket that causes increased threat. I’d like to see this with all specs that become unviable the further you to. I also want to see the quests and zones fleshed out and finished.
---
All dps specs are viable. If you mean tank viability that's a different topic.

also I always thought gnome warriors is retared
---
just like how tautens can't be rogues because it doesn't fit their class, neither should gnomes be warriors as it just doesn't make sense..instead gnome priest should fill the empty space
---
It is time to start carry FAP, invisible potions, healing potions, etc. Usually, I played hunter and never had a problem with ganks, but now I am a shaman and I can't track stuff anymore and that is kinda annoying. Especially when I never got killed when I am on max hp

I put epic mount above all for pvp because with out it, you'll get slaughtered in the open world. So in my opinion, I would say no and shoot for your epic mount!

"You wouldn't believe how this lvl1 character made a thousand gold! Money making technics the economy don't want you to know about!" But seriously... thats a genious way to make a lot of money.
---
It's a new meta over a decade later I reckon. People trying to greese over it instead of slow and steady. As a healer then and now, it makes me more irritable than I'm happy with
---
&gt;As Mage it can be huge. When I just hit 60 I would barely do like 230 DPS on Ragnaros. Last night I did 523 DPS.
---
I don't get it, as a warlock, I only get \~+35 dps increase with 100 spellpower.
---
Frostbolt has +82% coefficient so 100 spellpower is +40 dps. to gain 300 dps, you would need 750 spellpower. With 1.5 BiS the max for mage is 400 (with max enchants) which translated to 160 dps, not 300. Maybe you just play better? :D
---
How come you reached +250 dps as mage?

Until your questing and all these fucking gnome mages tag mobs right before I can hit them, when they just saw me stealth behind them. Fuck gnome mages, I never try to save them from ganks (also they just look funny when they die). Also while not every gnome mage is whiny bitch (plenty are quite generous) but the vast majority of whiny bitches I've met have been gnome mages.
---
You haven't mentioned, but you are clearly alliance. Which race tho?
---
And it's partly what is in place in retail now, the main talent system + 5 PvP specific talents
---
Your numbers are way too high. No chance a preBiS warrior is pulling 700dps on single target, without full raid consumes, buffs, and world buffs.
---
More like 350-400 DPS preBiS and 200 fresh 60.
---
You can use both if you use one, log out for an hour, then use the other. The buff will stay while the cool down ticks down.
---
Its supposed to be an axe? My whole life is a lie...
---
How are you gearing for that? I tried with a priest but I’m in full leather fury crit /hit gear with a BRE and I’m getting murdered
---
Don't let allies faction transfer.
---
Those numbers dont account for the thrash proc/wf proc + bigger crits with the high topend dmg. You’d usually want a slow hardhitting mh and a quick ragebuildibg offhand

If you are going to be playing dps then it’s perfectly fine for you to win the helmet. That helmet is not a tanking helmet as the tier 1 set is much better for tanking.

A tribute run kills the final boss without killing the earlier bosses, you get better rewards at the end but obviously you skip a lot of boss kills.  Hunters can solo it, think you can duo-stealth it, but 5 man groups run it too.  People also do tribute runs to get access to 1hr buffs, useful for raiding.
---
Jump run is named because you skip content by jumping off platforms instead of killing trash.  You do it to farm the last boss &amp; once you've killed him you get access to 2-3 rich thorium veins/chance at arcane crystal.  The fastest way to kill him, is by killing the hydro boss &amp; the sacrificing demon, then going straight to him.
---
So any classes can complete those two... but you'll find certain classes prioritizing it as their best way of making money.  Solo hunter tribute run, solo warlock jump run, duo jump run/sometimes trio.
---
Both mage and warlock do 200..300 dps with purchased/questing gear (100..200 spellpower), depending on their skill, buffs etc.
---
For warlock, mage and shaman, every 100 spellpower is +35 dps or a bit more (depends on talents).
---
BiS that can be bought or dungeon gear and full phase 1.5 BiS gear difference for warlock is 200 spellpower (+70 dps), mage is almost 300 spellpower (+105 dps). This is all on paper, depends on other aspects as well but should be roughly accurate.

More fun than a guy pretending to be a fucking troll? Damn, one man party machine.
---
Or just but edgemasters and you're 1 point away of hardcapping .. since they're bis for several patches even when using racial weapons.
---
Does anyone know to set up the "only show healers mana" option in Grid2 raid frames addon?
---
That's the plan. I get very bored in dungeons and this is a way to entertain myself while running the same thing over and over.
---
Warlocks are the mages that pretty much did forbidden magic in pursuit of power. Hence why Warlocks location for trainers for the Alliance tends to be hidden. 
---
So the archetype that you'll willing to do anything for ultimate power, is a very human behavior. 
---
Plus, I think if Dwarves &amp; Gnomes were the only mages on Alliance side, a lot fewer would play it, as they are simply ugly in vanilla models.
---
It’s hard to say. But from my and my friends experience there’s definitely more Horde in the open world. My guess is that the server is around 55% H / 45% A or 60% H / 40% A. It’s definitely not a terrible imbalance and perfectly playable on both sides.
---
As a warlock fearing people that have jumped into the lava:Yes, yes they do.
---
I mentioned raid-geared toons because it seems like even a lot of PvP players are gearing up in raids this time around. It's less that I think raiders will flood the battle grounds, and more that there's just a plethora of extremely well geared level 60's who will have a big advantage and head start when it comes to gear/experience/resources. 
---
In other words, it's seeming very likely that the BG's will be at a stage where everything will feel very established instead of tumultuous and new. It's not a bad thing, it's just something that would have been nice to re-capture.

---
Buy original windows you pirate lol.
---
There are so many factors to take into account including your dps, your party/raid's dps, people in your party/raid dying and more. What you can do is check the average kill time on warcraftlogs. Try finding comps that run with the same amount of players as your raid group. Hope this helps.
---
There is a sword drop from last boss in ST. Chance on hit to spawn a dragon whelpling that fights for you
---
What a mad lad
---
Bubble Hearth. Screw you guys, I'm going home.
---
I honestly wouldn't call the talents a strong point in Classic. For me anyway.  Some of them are quite great and iconic, most of them are just generic filler.
---
I went from +60 spellpower to +400 Frost spell power. Also got more hit and more crit. I also got the Talisman of Ephemeral Power which helps a lot. The increased intellect and spirit also means I can cast non-stop on Ragnaros. First week(s) I would have to use evocation.
---
Move speed on boots enchant (super cheap).  Bind pet attack &amp; pet follow to button presses, set pet to passive. If you're DS, also bind that.  Those 3 changes made all the difference to me.  If you're struggling, I highly recommend doing those things.  Made all the difference to me.
---
Also confirming Yes practice is a thing.  I went from "this is impossible, I'm gonna re-roll hunter" to accidentally locking myself out because my runs went to 8-9min each.
---
You can download the trial version and keep using it as long as you want. So no, it's not pirating.
---
Sure, but this requires a lot of attention on the feared mob, it may be more useful to just dps
---
Well at least on my server I've never saw that much corpses. A few skeletons lying around for sure, but never in that extent.
---
Step 1. Find a reddit post about Warlock VS Undead matchup 2. Realize they have never learned that you can just death coil WotF and as an horde lock you'd have to deal with fear wards everywhere and double dispel 3. Keep farming Undeads as they think they're a counter to you.
---
Those exceptions to **MS&gt;OS** usually only apply to certain cases. For example, when the ID reset is imminent and without the [Moonkin](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/5000500302551351--505003021) healing or someone even respeccing into heal, the boss kill is just out of reach. In that case, the hybrid class switching roles would be crucial for the raid to continue.
---
I'm not saying that your contribution wasn't equally valuable. Just make sure that this was malice and not just a case of failure to communicate.
---
I don't feel like the ultimate hero playing retail, though.  I feel like I'm a strong champion of my faction who helps in defending Azeroth.
---
Yeah! Download your character and Then post it! Then it Will show up!
---
With pvp coming out in a few days and Farelina being one the most populated US servers you might die alot and be part of some streamer events (unless you enjoy that).
---
Matter of time? I've already seen this many times.
---
that makes sense for whirlwind, I use that one a lot.  I just don't know a good method for figuring out how to tell which weapons are best for me. Until I start getting into grabbing whatever is on best in slot websites.
---
Warlock or Druid on a RP-PvP server? Warlock for easier play outside vs gankers and overall levelling. Druid for easy levelling but harder to deal with gankers.
---
Got a warrior friend at 60, so grouping won't be an issue. Druid can HotW/NS and heal him or tank when he's not on, warlock can just group with him so always got a tank.
---
Professions to level? Mining/skinning for gold? Or herbalism/skinning? Mining might be the way to go because P2 needs more engineers - herb also because stranglekelp/swiftthistle..
---
Decisions decisions!
---
It works with recklessness 😎
---
You don't like what people say so you want them banned?
---
Just needs more JoJo
---
Yeah! We tried it, it took a long time, but it is possible😇
---
Thank you, ill have that in mind!
---
Thank You! We Will look into this!
---
I think RP servers should be the only servers with report options to begin with. And I think RP servers should be moniticed better and faster to keep true RP's happy. RP servers are save spaces.
---
Reports should be for Cheating, Hacking or Botting only.
---
If there would be a realm without a report or even a Ignore option I would play there for sure. I dont care if I encounter racial, sexial or hatefull speech.
---
But my skin is as thicc as twitch thots thicc asses.
---
I actually skipped STV until level 40. You don’t really need it if you go the other zones and do some SM runs. I did all the quests in Southern STV around Booty Bay. Then went off to Tanaris.
---
Thank you very much!

Can the mods explain why they are so mercurial on removing content that people seem to like?  I've watched multiple non-WoW pictures/memes with WoW-related text on them be posted, saw more than a few get hundreds of upvotes and get removed, yet the top one right now is at 4.4k and is not removed..   
---
The nature of moderating memes/shitposts leads me to believe there is some fuckery about, if people like it, and it's not offending anyone, and at least pertains to Wow, what's the big effing deal?  And why are you not being consistent?
---
Skyrim intensifies
---
Shazbot!
---
Its funny, because it turns you into a human. Wannabe Alliance.
---
I'd take the staff any day and put in weeks on better dps than waiting months to outroll the bazillion other casters in my raid group for mageblade.
---
He doesn't like them breaking TOS so he wants them banned. This is very reasonable.
---
It's like wanting people banned because they use the boat and rooftops to gank people in neutral towns. You can try to put this as "You don't like how people play the game so you want them banned?" but it's still against the rules.
---
You missed the point so badly is it off sight now it seems.
---
I mean yeah, that's kinda right. But at same time if we are talking about dungeons I don't see much of issue if it isn't like really undergeared healer.
---
Most bosses I've done with pugs kill bosses under 10-20 **seconds**. It's ridiculously easy already, trash too. And most raid bosses can be done with 20-25 people awake.
---
That said, it's your group and your rules. But I'm hoping it won't go to "gotta have over-geared to get gear"
---
By Thaurissan's beard!
---
It’s sad that both games have gotten so far away from how they used to be. Hopefully D4 and SL are a return to form.
---
Resto druids will shine in TBC.  
---
Oh, sweet Lifeblooming 2 people and Hoting 3-4 more.  
---
Until them they are meh.  
---
It's never too late to level Pala. In one-two months more people will stop playing, so there will be free slots in raiding guilds. Don't worry much about it.  
---
And people won't stop playing - they played classic on private servers for 15 years already :)
---
Yup, with an AH on its back
---
Yes, and i think it was common to do so. We were bad back then. I recall scholo as being insanely hard, but these days even with entry level gear it's pretty simple if you know how to pull properly.
---
Up voting because he is a troll
---
lvl 19 rogue twink!
---
Hunters shouldn't be rolling on it. Yeah it's 20 AP, but the proc is completely wasted on them.
---
Interesting. We'll have to wait and see if they can make it less grindy than it sounds.
---
Horde I take it? Ashenvale, South Barrens, Thousand Needles. Run RFK and BFD whenever a group pops up as it's XP at the end of the day and you won't get your xp/hr interrupted from gankers.
---
Classic warrior levelling = you need at least 5 years of professional psychological treatment after every non-green mob you kill (lvl 10-40ish)
---
I think Druids are a lot stronger versus gankers; your mobility, roots and heals will make you so slippery. Also smooth leveling with the ability to tank etc.
---
&gt; Feral Druid has the single most engaging rotation in classic wow out of all dps specs.
---
How? I hate "powershifting". Shred-Shred-Shred-FB-Shift-Shred-Shred-Shred-FB-Shift-... 
---
Without bleeds Feral is two-button class. 
---
Until Blizz remove limitation of 16 debuffs on bosses - Feral would be very boring to play.
---
It hasn't been like that for a while, you can download the full pro version ISO from the microsoft website for free and you can click "activate later" on install, it will give the exact message in the screenshot
---
This makes me happy at level 50. I would go nuts if I had that many at low levels.
---
So everyone just copies each others thread ideas like a bunch of monkeys, hoping their thread will get Reddit karma like the original?
---
You should use a 20 spell power offhand
---
I mean it evolved in retail with "need 1k RIO to join this +10 run" problem is you need to do +10 run to obtain 1k RIO and most of the time this is from someone at 800 RIO wanting to be boosted on his main
---
To be fair. I love having druids in the party because they are just so versatile and can help out where needed. Keep druiding people!
---
great effort, bring on the gulch
---
because theyre bad players and lvl 60 pvp is too difficult
---
they would rather spend hundreds of gold on gearing a lowbie and killing those with 1/5 of your hp and damage... because thats the only way they actually get any kills :D
---
its sad but true
---
I believe the green can roll as a bag at higher levels too, had one chest that it had a 14 slot bag instead of a green.
---
49 is the best bracket
---
Nevermind PvP, the servers can't even handle raiding nights on sunday. I missed a week's worth of raiding because i couldn't log in.
---
that really depends on your personal preferences
---
most people would say warlock is boring since your rotation is shadowbolt into shadowbolt into shadowbolt for raids and a corruption beforehand in dungeons but I don't think more buttons equals more fun so I'm fine with it
---
And do less DPS than the tank while draining to full hp while the group kills the pack, rinse and repeat because now you've spent all your mana gaining your health back. Just tap and eat+drink or just drink, warlock's waste everyone's time with their inane bullshit.
---
Did 80+ runs and had to beat a Hunter for it who also needed on it.
---
Thanks for the video. Watched it now. Once Ill get 60 Ill have to start out HotW/NS, but im considering speccing 30/0/21 once/if I get T1 or comparable capable dps/heal gear.
---
Thank you again for the guide :D I would more of that kind of content
---
I change to my dagger when stealthing.  
---
This way I can add the weapon switch back to my sword to the ambush macro. This works instantly because you can still switch weapons while you already are on a GCD, for example from ambush.
---
How old are you? At least thirty, if you’re playing this game, right?
---
the only people I know that twink a character are people that suck at lvl 60 pvp, they simply think its too difficult and cant stand being on even level, they need to have 5x the HP and damage to even stand a chance :D
---
its hilarious when you think about it
---
Leveled my priest to 60 without visiting any dungeon. Had enough gold for some BiS (like e.g. Truefaith Vestments) items though, specced to holy and want to learn how to be a "real" priest now since I have basically zero experience in keeping others alive.
---
I'm kinda worried I will screw it up and get called out for that.
---
Just dont show up to do the quest the same day everyone goes to MC and gets their eyes.
---
Nobody ever does the quest on saturday or sunday.
---
Yes.
---
"hey bro I just came here from... I just need some silver for..."
---
I answered like you: Get the hell out of the city and play the game like everybody else.
---
ill never understand how arenas happened BEFORE rated bg's
---
In patch 1.10 they added additional loot to the older endgame dungeons, but reduced the player cap in each of them to compensate so they couldn't be trivialised. This meant BRS went down to 10, and BRD, Scholo and Strat went down to 5. Dire Maul was always 5, though.
---
/u/Botboy141
---
I guess I was imagining all those times when we had one warrior on all the adds and just AoE'd them down after killing Garr. Silly me.
---
people who twink dont want a challenge, thats why they do it :D
---
for once in their life they can feel as if theyre good at something xD
---
He’s likely lying. There’s only one legit way you can get this much gold so fast and it’s not by using the AH.
---
Rough descrpition is fearing mob after mob, so once you cast new fear on new mob, the first once comes running back to you upon breaking fear. You cast fear again on the one approaching you, thus fearing him away and breaking fear on 2nd mob, making it walk towards you.
---
Rinse and repeat.
---
Then you can add 3rd mob, play with Curse of Recklessness, or  add banish with elementals present.
---
Atleast that was my understanding.
---
I don't know what other people do. I saw the post with the blink icon and thought I have to share this because it blown me away when i realized it's not a parrot.
---
lmao
---
When can I go into RFK? 30? BFD is for 22+ i assume?
---
Speaking to the guides part, i wrote a short 1v1 guide to all warlock matchups. You can find it at the classic warlock discord, OP. Its in the pvp FAQ.
---
Of course there's a difference!
---
A Fury-tank still is a tank and thus requires defensive stats. The whole idea of it is that it can generate more threat due to using talents that increase the damage while being sturdy enough to take a beating without risking to die.
---
Fury-DPS-Gear has almost no stamina on it and a lot of it isn't even plate-gear.
---
When you are really well geared you might start replacing a few tank-items with more offensive ones for more threat but that won't happen pre-raid.
---
PvP comes with it's very own requirements for itemization. Kinda like an inbetween of tanking and dps gear. You want the stamina but not necessarily the other tank-stats like defense and dodge-chance as they are only usefull against other melee and mean you have less damage. But you also don't want to run around in leather-gear that would make you too vulnerable to other melee.
---
Basically look at what stats the PvP-Items have and use similar items for that.
---
no ultranumb soundtrack 8/10
---
It's literally not the same game, it might look similar but it is not the same game.
---
Literally copy-pasted this exact response from another thread. How much did blizzard pay you to make up shit that's not even remotely close to the truth?
---
exact same on Nethergarde(EU) - I thought it was a bug just on our server...
---
There is no way of doing that in Classic WoW.
---
I know, I put it there as a reference.
---
Pesky Priests and Impatient Paladins ;)
---
&gt;If Phase 2 comes out in the next 4-5 weeks, with Phase 3 only a few months after that ... then I would agree that its time to raise hell to slow their horses.
---
Well, what do you know? Phase 2 is coming out in a week, which it's exactly those 4-5 weeks you mentioned.
---
Should take the loot and leave that mold in, so the next person to go through the trouble of opening it gets a pleasant surprise.
---
Who the hell has a hunter as a solo dps in a dungeon
---
Yep, definitely not as strong as it used to be on privates. For better or worse.
---
Suggestion: Choose your title wisely
---
And it feels so damn good
---
id rather slit my wrists then wait several days To complete bene lets be honest. In the end the respawn aint really long but if atleast people could not try the quest to fail it.
---
I said this in game, explained the difference too, got railed at by chat...
---
I.. I can't unsee
---
Looks ok, I would only put enough points into ret to get improved BoM then investing the rest of the points into prot to get improved hammer of justice or concentration aura. Additionally improved devotion aura is kinda weak so I put the points in redoubt instead.
---
Is LBRS doable around level 58? And is it necessary to run 5 or 10 man?
---
&gt; Any real arpg fan will turn towards path of exile
---
As long as said real ARPG fans don't mind constant spam scrolling down their screens, about the latest streamer who is the VERY FIRST PERSON EVAR!!1one to enter the billionth floor of their never ending dungeon.

Not at Deadmines level.

[This](https://imgur.com/a/oWZUHGd) is how i like my UI, a lot of space to see everything happening
---
No, arcane mages are easy pickings. You can still probably 1v1 a warrior, but any range with half a brain will make quick work of you once they realize you don't have iceblock (AP animation really gives it out). I guess you can pom-poly, so you got that going for you.
---
Phase 2 isn't really about 1v1, though. People that are serious about honor farming will be roaming as ~5 man groups, and it doesn't really matter what spec you are if you run into them solo.
---
Are you on an RP server? I’ve never seen anything like what you describe
---
It appears you got punched in the vagina.
---
I’m guessing here but I would think so it’s about who your friends not sexual preference
---
5pcs and specimg pet full fr+stamina improves the pet survival rate by a lot
---
Not really, anyone can do them but level 60s generally. You're more of a liability before that due to body pulling at larger range. Tribute runs have some nicer loot, and jump runs are more for gold farming.
---
See now THIS is good content, people put effort in here and its hilarious, good job.
---
Please more of this and less of the copy paste shite on this subreddit
---
Explosion in motion.
---
A lot of people have a very unhealthy relationship with Wow specifically.
---
Finally executing it after you kite it around the whole map? Yes.
---
Also, wtf are the weapons for warriors? 20-37lvl is crescent staff, 37-51 is ravager and 51+ is lord alexanders...
---
And I picked the stupid staff from maraudon instead of thrash blade.........
---
But I ain't complaining, actually enjoyed it. Finding dung groups in 30 seconds is nice.
---
It's only a fallacy if he doesn't provide a definition (at least within his own context) of what a "real" ARPG gamer is.  If he provides a concrete definition, then that becomes testable, which means it's not a fallacy.
---
Yes. If everyone in the raid bar main tank is engineer it's the most reliable way of killing Onyxia.
---
Maybe if they do classic+ more bosses than are more interesting (not a dps race)
---
It’s balanced for 5 people, and 58 is perfect
---
It makes it easier to play effectively imo. A Macro to have your felhunter Target yourself use devour magic then return to the previous target all in one button is an extremely useful one that comes to mind for PvP. Sure you can do this without a macro pretty easily but it's usually not as fast and in PvP half a second is a big deal.
---
Holy crap it is an axe? Dang
---
M'lady
---
Crescent staff is until 30, the get some help from a high lvl friend and get whirlwind axe until 37
---
With a little bit of effort you can kill all ads on mobile. With some more effort, you can kill any incoming ad - even on your smartTV - coming through your router.

Solution: Get linux

Thank you for so perfectly illustrating what I am talking about

Right, but that doesn't make it an evaluation copy. Only products listed here; https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/ are test products, where you will notice that Win10 Pro is missing.

Just because something CAN be done technically, does not mean you are allowed to.

Just a standard PvP server, perhaps RP is the way to go

Bay and Preach interviewed Ion for half an hour(iish). Where, if i recall correctly Ion referred to the amount of work for maximum power gain to be something like capping valor, with extra work going towards

---
Probably savory deviate delights.
---
It's not difficult to get 2 a run. And there is a long time before zg.
---
Why should I pick Warlock over Mage for alt char? I have druid now and never played ranged class like ever. Does Warlock got more keys to press? Because I heard that Warlock is just weaker Mage with more to do. I can "sacrifice" dmg for more fun but is it worth it?
---
"Redditor repeats meta manifesto" 
---
Yawn
---
The thing is: the client can handle the players fine. It's the server that can't keep up.
---
They changed it around 1-2 years ago, so it'd be ontop of everything, burning itself into your monitor.
---
Had the name of a rogue pop in my head, but didn't think it was the same server. Turns out it was and I was right. Nice job man!
---
Or he could get Linux, which is both better and free :3
---
Aight, thanks for your response :) then I know
---
It's very hard to escape, but there are mature guilds with an age cap. A problem is that it isn't always age, but social segment as well. Inevitably I always end up cringing, like you, when they reveal themselves in a guild. And it's not only the men. They are aggressive, sexist, and all-round inappropriate, and seem to almost hate what they are doing. I have not found a place without a few rotten apples yet myself, and it's usually the first thing that makes me leave - not the content by a long stretch! I have sort of given up hope myself to ever find a real pleasant guild. I guess it's just asking a tad bit too much from a videogame, which is fair.
---
He did - one who prefers Path of Exile or Diablo 2 over Diablo 3.
---
Did you make a character on a Streamer server or something?
---
I have not seen what you are describing.
---
[These](https://playvanilla.blogspot.com/p/maps.html) maps are awesome and feature paths to guide you through each dungeon.
---
Too bad most tanking warriors aren't wearing a shield ;)
---
Batching isn't what's causing this but okay.
---
Best farming if you have mining and decent gear is DM:East. 
---
Otherwise an optimized Mara run is pretty good. 
---
DM:East bosses are still good without mining and the gear/spec to kill last boss, but I'm fairly certain 3*5 bosses an hour in Mara is better GP/H. 
---
If you're only aiming for 10-15g an hour then you can do just about anything.
---
On retail, they were 1g each before gold inflation.  They're actually pretty cheap in classic.
---
The rule is

It is omg :)

Maybe you could use a weakaura to show when the buff has procced and then you know when to cast a high rank spell. I doubt there’s any way of automating it though.
---
Yeah I agree, I can pull 700 with a few crits and full buffs on trash. But as I said that's not representative of the DPS a pre-bis warrior will do.
---
As a side note why do you not use whirlwind on bosses?
---
Dog i spent between 50-100g each raid :&lt;
---
How do you define healers? Or just all hybrids?
---
Rogue Spec, which one? I'm lvl 12 and still didn't picked up a spec, can someone help me with it?
---
There is an application which enables you to make any window always-on-top. Can't remember the exact name but a google search should do it.
---
Who's Joe?
---
I don't have a shield atm, but when I get one, rebout will be more useful i guess.
---
Warriors have slows, stuns, interrupts, and fear.  When they use them it's lovely.  Or, when you ask the dps warrior to hamstring, they complain that their dps goes down.  Potential to be more than just dumb damage bots, for sure.
---
Ok, boomer
---
how do people know your gender in the game? I rolled as a female troll, but i'm a dude. My actual gender has never come up.
---
Roll alliance and try the game in hard mode.

What the other guy said - BRD is a low level dungeon. You'll honestly be fine in there, say to your group that you've levelled as shadow and don't fully understand healing yet and they should be OK with helping.
---
If you're up front and honest about lack of experience, most groups will be 100% fine with that. If you even say "please can you give me advice on what I'm doing wrong" they'll more than likely help.
---
You're a healer, the world needs healers, if they're dicks then being a good healer wouldn't stop them from blaming you even when it wouldn't have been your fault.
---
Healing's an easy ride man, enjoy it!
---
Oh I remember now! It’s J O E M A M A
---
One of my friends was leveling a warrior, he was lv 43 and close to give up and never touch the game.  
---
I bought him a full blue set of BiS plate gear &amp; executioners with crusader.
---
He was cutting through mobs with ease and had finally fun again.
---
Moral of story, if you play a warrior without being resilient, twink it. The 40-45 bracket was horrible for me when doing it at release. At least I was able to do dungeon farming instead.
---
no idea unless I saw you pvp
---
invest in free action potions, Limited Invuln potions (HUGE, only reason I can 2v1 sometimes, VW sack and then LIP = free win vs 2v1 melee, im a 60 UD warlock decent pvp gear), even regular frost protection pots vs mage, or even regular shadow protection pots so you can eat thru them to lifetap instead of your HP if you go OOM, or just generally good vs spriests/other warlocks.
---
Sadly pvp isn't just dot fear and run, against any half decent pvper anyway.
---
There there, my son. No generation rules forever.
---
Because that and blackhand's breath are the only available trinkets right now that actually do something for your DPS. And you need a lot of static stats to beat what is close to a 2% DPS increase.
---
Hunters shouldnt roll on it all now dire maul is out. Their class trinket from DM gives more ap.
---
Or you get Corpsemaker at 29 if you have no friends that help you. His weapon list is wrong.
---
Are you sure about that?
---
 I'm pretty sure i opened chests that just spawned that didn't have greens in them.
---
And i've seem chests despawn after a few minutes after i looted a few items out of them without any one looting the other items.
---
What? Of course people do this on purpose. And they did this in vanilla too. Idk why this is a big deal. I see it as like a harmless prank and when it happens to me i just think oh you fucking assholes and move on.
---
Doesnt matter, use thrash MH and mirah OH
---
Hardcore superfarming with luck yeah. But If I'm hardcore superfarming on Retail I'll make 25K an hour. Which would be 250G an hour on Classic according to this comment.
---
SM ruin is fine for wpvp. not as ideal as SL or conflag, but not bad at all. 99% of the time im out in the world farming (farm a lotta devilsaurs, deal with a LOT of ganks/pvp in general/2v1s) I always have VW for sac, consumes ready, healthstone/SS up, etc....even get a stack of 12 stam/spirit food(cheap, 20 are like 1g on my server) and some rummsey rum(more expensive, 3-4g per 10).
---
Horde sorta get the opposite:
---
c ƒ ◃ c c € f   -&gt;  o k z o o m a
---
Alternatively Wowhead put out a census graph where you can see it!
---
Tanaris. Grind wastewander mobs. Good xp plus hold onto the water and you turn them in for co and the quest is repeatable.
---
Everyone is like do aoe farm and that's good but when you're not in there grind those guys. Can do until 50 really.
---
Not really, I bought my epic mount at level 59. [It's really easy, the fish and pearls in my bag here are worth over 150g on the AH.](https://i.imgur.com/QcNTm0w.jpg)
---
RP is where I’ve seen the weirdest stuff, in goldshire inn etc
---
It's not worth using Edgemasters for humans who already got swords. Devilsaur set is a better option. Besides, if you got a sane loot council any human fury warriors will be handed maladath and get 309 skill.
---
Tanked it at 57 with a same level healer so you should be ok. It's a 5 man dugeon
---
SM ruin raider and pvper checking in. SM ruin is not the ideal pvp spec but it works 90% of the time. I dunk on fools all day in un'goro, 2v1 often. Only trouble I have is vs good mages. I have a mix of t1/necropile, staff of dom, mostly best pvp gear you can get outside of t1/2 besides my t1 pieces. Not terrible not amazing. Still have like a 60-10 KD in un'goro and thats farming devilsaurs, getting the tag + kill + skin being prio.
---
If you’d guild is unlucky on weapons, swords should be prioritized for warriors and daggers for rogues. Especially if human.
---
I thought Warlocks are mushrooms
---
Comments like these give me huge orgasms.
---
Thank you for your response. It looks like this is going to be downvoted to oblivion, but it's nice to know I'm not the only person who feels the same. It looks like I'm going to be quitting wow.
---
lol go back to retail
---
Welcome to a girl's life in videogames lol. No, not every guild is like that but many can be. I started playing vanilla when I was 11, fortunately before ventrillo was used for anything except hardcore raiders, so I flew under the radar pretty well. I had many awkward guilds and eventually found a wonderful kid friendly one.
---
The one thing I found in videogames is if you have a connection before you talk, men are ok with you. Instantly start talking in new guild, random Overwatch, pug raid? They are going to be crude. Talk after your second raid or several matches together though, and I've never had anybody say anything mean. I've even had some men apologize to me for what they were saying about women in general, or their swearing.
---
Keep at it and you will certainly find a good guild. Lots of women play and are active and vocal in the guilds they are comfortable in.
---
Oh yea I actually forgot about that one, my bad, but still, unless you have gold for Kang at 44 you are stuck with ravager until 51 xd
---
Also there was noone to help on lvl 30 since not many people were much higher and nobody was farming the elementals yet so getting 37 was faster
---
As a warlock who has farmed Mara close to 200 times you can do it. Watch a few videos try a few different strategies you may die a few times figuring it out but once you do its incredibly easy and you will average a minimum of 35g an hour.
---
go with combat swords if you want PvE and as for pvp Seal Fate but id still say combat until you get 60 and for raiding.
---
https://tenor.com/view/scrooge-mcduck-swimming-money-gif-5178207
---
What a pathetic mindset.
---
Kargath is like its own little city of bored level 60 players. It was interesting questing in Badlands and seeing the LocalDefense channel report locations of Alliance and having a response of "killed him" just a few minutes later.
---
Whines about faction imbalance after rolling horde
---
You are the problem boyo
---
Eearly lvls doesn't matter that much, as a couple of % more dmg sin't THAT big of a deal. What matters most are lvl 40 (31 points in talents - last talent available in each tree).
---
I would advise you to just play till about 40 and decide if you like that talent tree, or if you get some weapons you can switch between combat swords and daggers sub
---
&gt;blizz servers are WAY better.
---
They are way better because they are official. Having an official server makes me never play on a private server again. But its not better for this stuff. Not by a long shot. Classic servers lag as soon as there are 2 raidgroups fighting while that worked perfectly fine on private servers
---
But as I said, getting a dung group in 30 seconds I didnt do many quests between 30-40
---
Should probably say that was taken from classicwow forum, I didn't do those maths myself! But it still highlights its only a small difference between the two.
---
Are you in a guild/raiding because if you are that can affect for build further. For example only on paladin needs to go deep enough into prot to get kings, leaving the other paladin the ability to go holy/ret.
---
Gottem
---
Thanks man, I have /cast charge/intercept and then /cast hamstring and have noticed that it only does hamstring if I press that button again.   
---
It's the same idea for the way you've setup your macro there right?
---
it’s the top one or close to the top on the classic warrior weak aura page
---
Download the addon Character Notes and you can add a note to anyone, along with positive/neutral/negative colours to make it easier to notice at a glance. It'll add [note] any time you see their name in chat or /who, and on your tooltip.
---
It's what I use to blacklist people, or remember decent people. Or just add notes to friends alts so I remember which alt has which profession.
---
Thanks, so far I've gotten good tips Im gonna try out so if iam not happy with those i'll definitely get back to you.
---
Band of Brothers is one of my top ten TV shows.
---
What’s this referencing? New to wow so don’t know
---
Yey, Darkmoon Faire guildies :)
---
2 manned it with warrior+priest. We're pretty geared, though I was healing in shadow spec.
---
You can do arena, the trash packs are harsh so you have to be patient and make sure warrior holds the aggro.
---
Then soothe the packs to make your way through the gate bridge, or just fear/whatever the packs as you run past them and jump out the window to reset aggro, and do the lock skip (the weird parkour where you end up on the gate bridge without opening shadowforge lock). The next pack of 4 mobs is unskippable, and you probably want to wait for fire elemental patrol first. MC takes care of one of the dudes if you're having trouble taking all 4 at once. Then another pack with 2 dudes + fire elemental.
---
Now for general, there's a neat trick. You need to stand under the stairs leading to his room, on the left side, hugging the wall (under the overhang). If you do that, once a bunch of mobs rush in to help the boss, they won't be able to path to you and will just stand there confused. They will never deaggro so once the general is down you either need to kill them, or logout reset.
---
You mean the ones that are immune to nature damage? It doesnt work in classic
---
BRM is basically people /yelling random Latin letters and numbers at each other
---
Well, they are pvp servers after all so they will get impacted too. However rp-pvp people are usually a bit more chill so the impact won't be as much as in normal pvp servers. Just my two cents.
---
It's called Arcanefrost.
---

---
I have the same problem..  
---
But I decided to level a druid so I can do all things.  
---
We'll see how long I last.
---
Getting 5 filler talents from level 10-14 is better than getting absolutely nothing. I like some stuff of the new system but its too barebones. Ideally for me would be to have traditional talent trees from 10-60 (with the shadowlands level cap) and then having the new one at max level on top of that.
---
This sounds false. I've looted chests with silver in it, and also chests in dungeons while running solo that has no greens.
---
No because of missing 20% glancing damage and missing 3% hit.
---
Rogues are fine with it because of their talent trees. For orc warriors it's literal trash.
---
Ran mara princess for the ring, when it dropped I accidentally pressed greed..
---
i remember on my pserver getting disconnected every few hours became the norm to the point it stopped being questioned ever, as well as few second lag spikes which werent questioned either anymore.
---
If that is the case you should be good with the above build as you will be blessing kings/salv/light. 
---
I would say prioritise the mount. It means you'll get to the gear faster :)
---
I did get it while leveling, fortunately we had some in the AH :) Was an insane improvement.
---
On what? From what I understand raiding isn't that tricky so you don't really need flasks or consumables, DM buffs should be good enough.
---
Sm ruin is better if your raid allows for 1 corruption.
---
No idea why that guide is skipping out on one of the best leveling tools you can get; Riposte. I'd rush that if I were to make a Rogue. Doing that takes 11 pts, follow Imp. Sprint and hit in whichever order you prefer (Imp. Sprint might be good with Honor coming around soon, otherwise straight hit) and fill out DW spec until you hit 20 points. Proceed with Blade flurry etc.
---
Yes expecially after Rend, Rend run can be done with 5 people easily, but pack after that are tough
---
We cant say rape in game anymore? Serious question cause my leeroy lets go is usually lets rape em.
---
And don't forget the free mount at 40.
---
if you get upset about something like that you should look for proffesional advice cuz its not normal.
---
Its exactly a representative because people would do above 700 consistently if tanks could generate enough threat.
---
I dont use it beacause as i said i pull aggro too hard. I dont even bt on cooldown. 
---
Much better to let ranged classes enjoy themselves than being the odd one out laying dead with some rogue and other fury war out of 40 people, having wasted expensive potions and buffs.
---
Threat gen limits dps very hard.
---
go back to your dead server
---
Personally I prefer the look and feel of a staff. However, I intend on pvping and the mageblade is much better because of the offhand swapping.
---
But I still want that staff
---
But that's like, druiding 101. Save your res for the tank or healer going down mid fight.
---
be a warrior and grind out two epic swords from ST each sword can proc up to 3 dragonlings i believe.
---
What else are you going to do when corpse camped?
---
Because warlocks dont have a talent that gives our shadow bolt 6% spell hit unlike mages and we dont have access to any more than 2% spell hit right now.
---
Is it a frost mage or an arcane mage? It's a frost mage who specced into arcane for the raid, and you know it.
---
It depends. For my spec there are 3 exciting talents in the entire tree. Everything else is just "Increases whatever by 1%" for 5 points. There were 6 level chunks while leveling where I could have not spent points any not had any negative impact on my leveling performance. It DID feel pretty good when I got actual useful talents though. 
---
I can't disagree more on providing choice. Min/Maxing has been done for ages and the only choice is honestly "the best" or "wrong" which is why we have cookie cutter builds. There's very little wiggle room on that. Just the utility talents that don't really matter in 99% of cases. You can do that in retail as well for the utility talent rows though without spending gold to respec. 
---
Loving Classic, but for me the talents are not a strong point.
---
You've done 35/11/5 wrong.
---
You don't need the judgement talents when you don't have lasting judgements.
---
Taking 3/3 lasting judgements, take 2 points out of toughness and take improved might.
---
yea indeed
---
Hehe, cheers buddy - it should cost about 400g right?
---
300 for quests, the rest for misc stuff and travelling?
---
Exactly so if the tank always has the offtank near when fireball is cast, then they will remain at full threat.
---
Sure downvote me for asking a question. I know they said in august, before the game was launched that they are **planning** to remove layering before phase 2 but my server still has 4-6k queues in primetime so I'm just wondering how they're going to reduce that kind of population in to just one layer and in less than a week.
---
As someone with a 60 priest, 60 hunter, 43 mage and 40 warrior I know these feels.
---
ress all together mass fear go mount regroup, rebuff and counter attack!
---
And then fap?
---
That would be 28/18/5 which is a fucked build compared to 33/18/0 (which I use)
---
Forgot to loot of last boss in Wailing Caverns before jumping down. That was a long sad walk back.
---
Good idea
---
I think it's because the guide focuses on PvE damage output for fastest levelling. Parry is useful but doesn't increase dmg out, Riposte is mega strong in PvP however the guide is for levelling and not PvP. Also not all mobs can't be disarmed and you kill a lot of beasts/other mobs that can't be disarmed.
---
That said, I've edited my reply to include Riposte. I think it's a must have on a PvP server, PvE I'd skip personally but you can't dps when you're dead so others may take it.
---
Depends on your server/If you can make the mats yourself. If you are an alchemist it will be somewhere around 350 ish but if you are buying arcanite 400+.
---
I would suggest picking up key talents in this order:
---
* Remorseless Attacks
---
* Improved Sinister Strike
---
* Precision, Riposte
---
* Blade Flurry
---
At level 32 your talent build would look like [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/02-32005501000401). And like [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/025023105-3200550100050150231) if you follow thisroute up until level 60. This is not exactly the meta build, but some talents are more useful for leveling than they are for raiding and vice versa.
---
Edgemasters Handguards dropped in BRD, it was a 4 guild/1 pug run. I said "all greed" not thinking. The Pug said he "really needed it for BiS". But he was a human warrior, so not helpful.
---
He needed it, but put it on right there. Oh well!
---
Easily with well geared people. It's doable, but a group of 7 people is probably the most efficient
---
and then, yes FREE ACTION POTIONS!
---
No it only affects unarmed strikes and fist weapons. Each weapon type has its own skill, so swords use sword skill, maces use mace etc.
---
Psychic Scream for shits and giggles.
---
"Warlock: I leveled one for a bit and thoroughly enjoyed it, but I fear that a warlock at 60 mostly spamming shadowbolt in both PvE and PvP would bore me really quickly."
---
My warlock is 57 right now, and so far in wpvp I can beat almost anyone but the 60s that are geared.. It is a lot of fun and and I am constantly topping dps charts in dungeons as well as I am allowed to multi dot.. Not looking forward to raiding though, but considering that endgame is not really my goal I am very happy with my lock.. He can also farm gold easily to fund my twinks and lvling alts
---
Speaking of 2 games, neither are wow classic. What is the point of your post ? Retail bad classic good upvote to the left etc ?
---
Sounds fair. I was invited to an UBRS group last time. 3 warriors in it already and they were looking for 2(!) tanks. One tank joined, noticed 3 warriors and said 'ya, but no'  and left.
---
Finally one of the 3 offered to offtank and we found a druid MT.
---
Agree with this. Sometimes getting that resist on a fear in MC or Ony is super nice.
---
Is that Freshfish on Blauxmeux? He is a legend, I go to him daily
---
Holy shit its an axe??
---
Haha. Yes we will. Gotta do all my research possible as you can see, but im confident now we have this.
---
6p sc is actually better since the prebis list from the pservers is based on rogues needing 9% hit for yellow instead of 6% of classic (absolutely bot saying that you dont need hit).
---
    Problem with 6p sc is the transition into epics being harder since breaking sc weakends it quite a  bit. 4p still good.
---
Shadow reflector means nothing in a SP vs druid match-up. A good SP ain't gonna burst you they slowly drain you. One reflected mana burn (and its so easy to stop the cast) won't win you the duel
---
Find a nice hive in silithus and camp rich thorium respawns.
---
This is true, 5pt1+2pt2+dagger bracers is bis for daggers, not sc.
---
Crossing fingers that Riot actually makes a decent one 🤞🏽🤞🏽🤞🏽
---
I mean, popping lip makes any lock v rogue a trivial affair. They have very limited amount of time to kill you and you can artificially increase the time it takes for them to kill you by 6 seconds.
---
It's because there's simply no resemblance of a parrot in that icon.
---
That's happened to me once ever
---
And if I didn't try, we were gonna have to pull that mob anyway so what difference does it make?
---
Everything you said is wrong.
---
Congratulations
---
I have no problem with the queues, because I'm logged in before they begin. Queues wasn't the point of my post.
---
Cheers, happy if you found it helpful.
---
As I said, the time spent putting those points in parry feels pretty awkward as you keep looking at Precision right next to it, but it's great once you get it. The Remorseless attacks tip by E-sport is also good, although it will postpone everything in Combat by 2 more levels. Personal preference on when to pick those up.
---
No, addons increase the loading time. Especially if they don't unhook from the events they no longer need. (Like PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD, which you probably need to process only once)
---
He heals you when you are under 50% hp otherwise he does lightning. He has low hp from what i seen.
---
I'd say that I'm glad that by luck I didn't choose retri when starting my WoW "career" back then. I started in TBC and looked over the talent trees. All trees had meh telents mostly, but I liked Holy Shock. So I started as Holy, not knowing it was a healer spec. Looking back I think that I wasn't that much slower than Retri and the self-sustain was nice. And with Holy Shock unlocked I dare to say that I levelled faster than Retri...
---
To bad they destroyed Shockadin in Wrath. At least MoP/WoD retri was really fun and current Retri is... serviceable.
---
I’ve raided for a year as resto Druid w Top 3 guild on one of the biggest pserver last year. When I submitted my application, they hadn’t a single Druid on rooster, so they would take anyone. 
---
We run 35 minutes MCs, downed Nefarion on a first try (I played crucial role - hibernating dragonkins and decursing MT), got funneled all the class loot, but I still got nightmares that I’ve run out of regents and have to buff 40 ppl over and over again. I don’t know if my developing depression lead me to play resto Druid, or playing Druid did it.
---
TL;DR: You’re fucking on point, mate!
---
&gt; Chests have a 100% chance to spawn with a green or better.
---
Not true in Classic, that was a private server feature.
---
Itemrack lets you queue equipment so once your rockethelm is on CD it will switch to mind control or stat helm.
---
I thought you couldnt target him tho :s maybe aoe? On wowhead a hunter is describing how this is THE best trinket ever so I will grind out the rep and get him, expect a post about my experience then ;) idk how long it takes but I have a feeling quite a lot, raid groups seem to work for grinding rep so thats good
---
One thing is for sure. You have to choose between ice barrier (shield that absorb damage) and PoM (next spell is instant cast). Depends on your style, either aggressive or defensive. Evocation and Ice Block, though, are almost mandatory for survival, that's why both became regular spells in TBC. In vanilla wow most mages had a cookie cutter build with 14 in arcane and 37 in frost or some slight variation of that. Some fire talents are pretty good too, but Evocation and Ice Block are just too important to give up for some burst DPS, and since most mobs in MC and BWL are immune to fire, so frost was almost universal.
---
Just wanna say for Locks, a couple pets get invisibility so they're not in the way at all. And while soul shards can be a hassle, once you have bag space they're not bad at all. Also, in pvp they're arguably the best class.
---
How much gold do you have currently?
---
'Probably not even" isnt really a proper way of saying "Not even close" 
---
800-1000G on retail would be the same as 1G in Classic. Not 100 lol
---
Doesn't make it any better than the product though. Names don't make good games, in the end only good games make good games. Names can influence if a game becomes a good product, but even good names can fail in that respect. Thus, just looking at a name or name-dropping a person makes no sense.
---
Undead priest with no jaw here... This is so accurate...  and that attempt to hearthstone out of battle made me lose it hahaha
---
No they are not, you get axe of the deep woods for mh and flurry axe for oh. If you don't want to shell out for flurry, serathil does the job
---
Me too
---
Dude. I did this on HoJ last night cause I was stupid baked. I’m a 54 rogue. I wish I had a recording of my face. 100% meme material I’m sure.
---
Indeed, took me 30 secs.
---
I'm stuck in the same position as you. Played a warlock to 35, but gameplay got rather boring (send pet, dot, dot, dot, Drain Life until death). I rerolled a warrior, currently at 37, and while I love tanking dungeons (even pugs), I don't have the time to be a fully committed raid tank, and fighting for loot with the 10 other dps warriors in a pug raid doesn't sound like fun. Also the repair bills are only gonna get worse when I get plate armor, and I'm already short on cash.
---
I'm thinking about switching to rogue. I'm on a PvE server where rogues aren't nearly as prevalent as they are on PvP servers, so finding groups should be a bit easier. There's also hunter which I enjoy playing, but people keep saying how it's gonna drop down the damage meter the further we get into Classic.
---
Whats NS?
---
... well if people wanna to hurt themselves then good on them xD
---
in WoD i was making 200k a week from the garrison just sending out followers on missions

I started out with 6/8 shadowcraft and two pre-BiS pieces. I replaced those since they have about zero stamina on them.

There is no case where you don't get edgies as off-race
---
This is a shitty point I'm about to make and it's a bad mentality to have because if everybody has it then it's a downward spiral. 
---
Talking on everything aside from Fire Prot Potion: do you really think that those buffs (just on you) are going to be the difference between a kill and not? I used to raid lead in TBC/WotLK and I would tell people that consumables were optional for:
---
* Bosses we have a 60%+ or higher wipe rate on as it's not on farm.
---
* Bosses we have on farm.
---
* First run attempts on bosses (like the first 15+ tries)
---
* Bosses we had killed previously after X amount of tries and it was the first 2-3 attempts of that night.
---
&gt; not everyone seems to be that great at raiding
---
Is that because they're shit or because they're not using consumables? If it's the former then you need to nudge the RL/class leaders to educate the poor performers. 
---
It's MC at the end of the day and people shouldn't be downing consumables all the time.
---
Retail raiding (heroic and mythic) and M+ are highly engaging in comparison. The leveling experience is a joke though
---
Like anyone who's leveling will ever enter BGs
---
Then it’s not a tip, then it’s a fee. 
---
Why don’t people understand this basic fucking difference?
---
Bows. You get more access to a lot more bows from quests and dungeons than you do guns. 
---
There's also that little thing where a bow goes "boing" whilst a gun goes "BOOOOM!!!" everytime you shoot.

Poe and grim dawn are arpg games. Even the torchlight series

Thats your definition

Haha never. My green offhand sword will be replaced eventually! xD
---
Both of course. Never know what type your next upgrade will be.
---
I know, I know. And it is in less than a week. Just wondering how they're gonna reduce all the very high population realms in to just one layer.

Does Moonkin form and Leader of the pack give the crit buff to the druid as well, or only party members?
---
Guess you will love diablo 4 then. “Skill tree” just has 1 path and there’s only 3 main stats 🤣

I and my friend are ret pala and feral druid. The number of times we could avoid a wipe by going off main spec is crazy.

My rogue is lvl 18, few more levels to go and I will be rich!!1!!! Hah

As someone who has mained hunters throughout most of WoW's existence, boy do I ever hate derpy hunters who give the rest of us a bad name.

We’ll see

And the druid? Looks like you just need decent blues. Thats great :D
---
Druid aswell.
---
God damn that looks like fun.
---
A shame we'll never experience it on Classic.
---
Absolutly nothing. My server seems to be 90% Retail kiddies that ignore the community aspect of the game as much as they possibly can. The other 10% are hardcore raiders that hit 60 in 2 weeks of release and just logs on once a week to clear MC/Ony

Too slow, not worth xp/h

Na it’s better to play a game with braindead loot “get the green items and complete the set” to do 1728383738282982838382928383891828338 damage with my auto attack in Nepalem rift 2728282
---
Weeelllllllllll fuck
---
Same
---
Yep. The level squish looks like a good step in the right direction.
---
Removing something they could earn a lot of money from (level boosts), is a promising sign that they might be thinking more about making the game good again.
---
It's also encouraging that they mention Alts as a key feature in the expansion. Maybe they will tone back the time gated content a bit, and let the people who play a lot play with alts without being punished (AP).
---
The 5% to bows doens't matter while leveling
---
Just use whatever ranged weapon you find that is an upgrade
---
Btw if you're not lev 16 yet, get the xbow from undercity .
---
So I can be a goddamn ninja.
---
I love how you respond to a content creator posting a video of a possibly fun and different way to play WoW classic, with a min/max mentality answer :D
---
I'm exactly this priest, except i never get the set item to drop....

Death grips!!
---
What's the "0 - 8" under your character?
---
Is this a blunt joke? 🤔
---
Fishing on one monitor and watching some chill shit on the other is actually a good way to make a considerable amount of gold.
---
At max level gear doesn't have the same impact. You have a complete toolkit to fight back and it is possible for undergeared good players to take on naxx geared players. The same is not true of twinking a twink could use just auto attacks and keyboard turn and kill a same lvl opponent as long as they can do alright at facing them occasionally so they hit 2-3 auto attacks to kill them
---
That wasn't the problem at all though. My PC is a beast and I don't have many add-ons, and the ones I've had I've been using since release. After 2h of not being able to connect everything was back to normal, so it was a auth problem (and blizzard had a notice for that in bnet).
---
Doesn't the imp damage make up for the lost 5%?
---
Good call, thanks. I definitely forgot about using crappy weapons...
---
It's just a fucking game!
---
In summary raiding is about maximising DPS and sacrificing everything else including say armour, health etc..
---
Where as PVP is almost the alternative, you want to stay alive as long as possible to 1. Not give the enemy free honor 2. Use your abilities to keep people alive. 
---
As a paladin in PvP, the longer I’m alive the more freedoms, cleanses, heals, stuns, saps I can give
---
I want to have the full t0 so I actually have everything ready to do the t0.5 questline later on. I could do it later, right, but I want to be prepeared.
---
And especially as a full holy, parts of the t0.5 are okay to farm with ocassionally. Also, the quest line is fun and adds cool bosses.
---
Stevie Wonder? I didn't know you were into ARPGs!
---
Totally forgot about using crappy weapons. Thanks!
---
No one said it's as hard as mythics, each expansion has made harder and harder raids. We are explaining two different kinds of people. I'm talking about the people right now that are acting like MC and ony is as hard as raiding gets in vanilla. We literally only have the easiest fights released but people keep pretending otherwise.
---
I excedently pressed greed on my bis shoulders when no one needed them. It would be my last item I needed  from the dungeon and Ive not seen it drop since.
---
It's just so hard. Imagine having to choose between three abilities which have all effects described in the talent choice itself. It is really hard. What does "cost: 400 mana, does 255-500 damage" *really* mean?
---
25s for a crusader enchant is not adequate enough to be classified as a tip lol  
---
is 1c a tip? no it's much too low, same with 25s  
---
Don't be stingy and tip properly.
---
That’s what you get when downloading windows from Microsoft and don’t have a key.  It’s perfectly fine.
---
I played in vanilla, but I had no idea about int affecting weapon skills. Crazy! Thanks.
---
I noticed that too, I used that guide myself, and in an earlier version it had Riposte. No idea why they removed it. For leveling I'd recommend Shadowpanthers build: https://shadowpanther.net/leveling.htm
---
While I usually agree with this it's not gonna happen. They aren't doing it anytime soon and if it's that bad I would reroll. Know it sucks but it is what it is
---
Can somebody help explain the method of switching engineering specs? For example if you get all the gmomish items then switch to goblin will you lose all the trinkets?
---
Yeah man as much as I shit on retail it is very annoying to see people that think vanilla raiding is hard. I mean I love vanilla raiding but you're right, it doesn't even touch heroic difficulty let alone mythic. Not even the late phases.
---
Show us the older videos.
---
Gonna take you several weeks at least.
---
I wouldn't get your hopes up. They dont even have good servers up for retail. They think this is ok. Its fucking activision blizzard what do you expect?
---
Gimli:
---
It's true you don't see many dwarf women. And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance, that they are often mistaken for dwarf men.
---
Aragorn:
---
It's the beards.
---
And this in turn has given rise to the belief that there are no dwarf women, and that dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground!
---
Which is, of course, ridiculous.
---
And so it begins...
---
Oh wow thanks
---
They don't sell for shit on my server (Westfall-Horde). Can't even get 1g for a full stack usually.
---
They are not bringing tier sets back because they want ppl to always be able to grind for something new instead of finally feeling the satisfaction of getting your bis item after 40 runs
---
So no everything that ion said is gonne be bullshit or lawyer talk AGaIn just as always
---
Could you elaborate as to why? I know it's just personal preference but opinions matter :)
---
Ok thanks, thought so. It was just that wowheads gearplanner didn't give the extra crit when you spec into moonkin form. Thought I had it wrong all these years.
---
Probably the overall fight was shorter, therefore more mana and cd usage. Also there were most likely less downtimes after several kills. Do Rag presons or with sons is also a big one, there will be a huge difference in dmg as with sons you basically have insane downtime.
---
Most ppl don't understand where dps comes from. DPS increase per stat can be perfectly calculated.
---
Says a lot about the state of blizzard doesn't it.
---
I'm sure this isn't a hardware thing, but a cutting costs thing.
---
That's not enough. Need those dark/demonic runes and mp5 food too.
---
Back then, possibly. Not today though, which is my point.
---
I have 3M gold in retail and it’s not even something I worked for
---
They did show off the skill tree and it’s akin to original d2
---
I feel like it’s the job of these panels is to sell games rather than give people the inside scoop. I’ll reserve my judgement for when it comes out but it having a dark theme and bringing back d2 classes doesn’t mean we’ll get another D2. Unfortunately A-Blizz has a terrible track record with original games the past decade or so.
---
Ideally you want to get [https://de.classic.wowhead.com/item=9375/expertenhelm-des-goldminenarbeiters](https://de.classic.wowhead.com/item=9375/expertenhelm-des-goldminenarbeiters) (or edgemasters) and get Rivenspike + Bone Slicing Hedget for non BoE weapons. For BoE weapons you want axe of the deep woods &amp; flurry axe.  
---
Edgemasters will be your BiS forever as a non Orc/Human DPS, so getting that will be great for you. 
---
Tanking you will use dual daggers if your are not the MT with thunderfury. You will need Aged Core Leather Gloves from MC for that
---
.
---
Buys stack of fishes for 1g, asks for a tip ; some ppl won’t give anything and some others will give 1g I guess..
---
To be fair, I think ret paladins do less damage... lol
---
people tend to pay or even overpay if they find the action funny, genuine, or kind. The guy says that any offering will strenghten the Horde (so he says you can pay if you want), and I'm sure many will pay a few golds for a Savory Deviate Delight, because of the added cuteness of the situation. I really dont know how much he is actually making, but I'm pretty sure it is a decent way of making money.
---
I like to kill lowbies that try to butter up to me.
---
I wouldn't call myself a good PVPer, but I usually don't have an issue pvping although my shitty gear. I don't know if I'm choosing the right opponents but I remember fighting off people higher level than me during leveling. Firstly, don't engange with your death coil. That is your 1# escape tool as we don't have a blink like mages and it heals for a great amount. I'd recommend entering combat with a seduction, somehow try getting them CC'd. If they are mounted just start off with a fear. Trust your DoTs and overall burst damage as you are running Ruin/Destro.   
---
My usual combo if I'm going for a 1-0 burst is Seduction, Soulfire followed by a deathcoil -&gt; Shadowbolt then finishing them with a Shadowburn. This can easily take down most classes, give it a shot and goodluck :)
---
&gt;I don't consider priests to be the douchecanoe class that mages and rogues are
---
You have a couple of priests who like to use MC to grief other players. I usually like to think they have been whispered to by the void lords while in shadow form.
---
Welcome *to the Hotel California!*
---
*...You can log out anytime you like, but you can never leave.*
---
Absolutly not true. I have looted many chests where I am sure that nobody has been there before, which didn't yield a green. This might have been true for some private servers, but not in Classic.
---
He’s prob not making much money off the bags but the cloth he got from aoe farming. Tailoring is a money sink profession with the itemization they went with in classic.
---
It really depends on how fast Blizzard want to shove out the phases. At most, I would guess that we have about 10 months more before they decide to implement "Burning Crusade Classic" or whatever they decide to call it. That's the "cap" on playing time. Now, based on what we've seen so far with how they're pushing content, I expect that it will actually be more like 6-8 months. Plenty of time to level characters and play the endgame.
---
Now, here's the uncomfortable truth: the people who are any good at the game are already 60 and in raid gear. So you will be more behind the curve for attunements, etc. the longer you wait. That is completely irrelevant if you find a good guild that will do runs to gear/attune people, though.
---
Nothing comes close to the glory that was Barrage in MoP. Sometimes pulled things through walls, floors and time itself.
---
With pre raid bis its around 400 yes. But actual bis reaches 450+ consider mage blade and 2 rings of spellpower and choker of firelord. All those boost it to 450+ maybe even 470
---
They're just going to remove the last layer and laugh as the queue times double. Blizz gave the tools to the players (free transfers), it's up to the players to use them.
---
I swapped servers 3 times. Still on a full realm, no queues.
---
Sfk is easily doable. It is however incredibly boring so throw on a series or movie on a second monitor if you've got one. Make sure you've got a ton of free space in your bags. It's not exactly profitable either, unless you get lucky with the boe
---
It's actually the avatar form for muradin in wc3
---
Just hilarious man!
---
Everything you said is wrong. Blizz patched the chests to no longer include a green every time to fight people farming thousands of gold by just layer hopping chests
---
More likely some neckbeard 60 rogue sitting at the Darkshire flight master 8+ hours a day ganking lowbies immediately when they land. Yes, I'm looking at you Kript-Blaumeux.

 Good Morning young fellas…

I got a Little Question… i cant decide for my PVP char… my decision is between Hunter - SM/Ruin Warlock

mainly I want focus on BGS Only … no PvE or World PvP

I know All 2 have different roles in each BG… but what is Overall Stronger in SoloQ BG, 1V1 - 1vsX … I know its Hard to tell  but I would love to get some helpful and Good Answers  
---
Peace much love and good evening
---
Imagine the shit show in really populated servers when a world boss spawns and everyone and there gramma trying to kill it.
---
Basically al of the server in one location.
---
Maybe this is just a stress test for the AQ War efforts 🤔. If so 200IQ
---
Until we found out the devs were selling gold and Rank 14 characters. Fuck that shit!
---
Have only run a couple MC raids so far, PUGs at that, and each one I have seen them do this. But even as a PUG you'd think they would know better than to use their combat rez. Only positive is that the couple wipes we did have I don't feel it would have helped anyways. 
---
My only guess is they might be used to just not having to care much about it from instance runs. Depending on the group you can be pretty haphazard about what you do and your cooldowns.
---
This is not true and was already proven before. Chests will despawn after a few mins if you did not loot all the items.
---
you think they gonna renove level boosts? 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂
---
Pretty much the horde version of alliance spamming Y O U L O S E  when 30 of them steam roll over you

Didn't played much of WC3, not being one of the biggest fan of RTS. But I do know a lot of icons from original WoW, back in 2004, are taken straight from WC3 indeed !

With the faction balance on many servers a lot of people can forget about world bosses anyways...

Do you play on Herod? Lol

That's not the one he's using, no? His regular "health window" looks like the standard blizzard one, but the only change is the way hp and mana is shown.. that's what I'm after :(
---
Oh wow :D I said i dont wanna spend ages on getting my raid stuff now cuz MC and Ony are not difficult cuz you need best gear, but you linked german wiki :D heccin tryhards :P did not even think about those 2 items tbh
---
People need to play like a druid.
---
My bags are constantly full and I never have any vendor space. Why?
---
I have 5 different sets in my bags. 1 tanking set. 1 healing set. 1 kitty dps set. 1 boomkin set (this generally stays in the bank actually lol). And the most important, my PvP set.
---
You'll never really have a set of gear that can do it all, so keep your pieces of gear for when you'll need them for something niche.
---
The only two items you need to make as gnomish is death ray and battle chicken. (Of course you can make others as well, but you can also buy them later or ask other people to craft them for you)
---
There's also the non-combat pet if you care enough.
---
You need 240 engineering for that, which should be around 100g. Then you drop it completely, level it up again and read the book in tanaris (steamwheedle port I think?) to get the goblin quest.
---
Yeah I do this, but I have MANY binds and macros that I need, I am already using this but reaching the limit of what I can do x(
---
Yep.
---
Yep
---
Pretty sure that’s gonna be all of classic lol
---
yea if you are critting with a 2 hander rage is not an issue xD.
---
Don’t sweat it. Blackstone is good. 
---
If you do want to get one or two they go for 20-40g from hunters doing solo tribute runs.
---
If you are in a guild just see if any of your hunters is camped in DM every day. I usually give it out for free to my guilds rogues.
---
&gt; How many of the original devs are still there?
---
none
---
I play on an alliance majority server, loved STV as a horde, more people to fight.
---
You will have a rough time without gear. If you had a good bit of raid gear you could make it work even this early, but in all pre-raid you will suffer.
---
Most of the ppl I have seen wanting to trade Classic gold for Retail gold have listed it at 1:2000+, so I guess you could have given him 5s and it would have been about equivalent :P
---
&gt; Rune of the guard captain if ~~melee~~ horde.
---
On the other end raiding MC is really boring. Its a fun little mini game to outout has much DPS as possible. To complete with your guildies and on parses. If a majority of the raid has this mentality, shit dies fast. Meaning you get out of raids faster.
---
Not necessarily, one of my guild mates did the wintersaber grind and he is exalted with both wintersaber and the furbolgs. Granted he played for about 12h a day for 13 days. If you have no life you can do it faster!

Ahh, well unfortunately for PvE every spec is mainly gonna shadobolt spam. Not much difference. But yea play around, lmk if you find an entertaining spec so I can try it too ahaha

Nah. They’ve been asking survey questions for the last year to try to determine how many hours to keep the levelling experience to force you into level boosts. Look for 1-60 to take at least 100 hours on average.
---
same as rogues
---
You are right. LIP seems to just act like BoP. If ony is targeting you and you pop a LIP, she will stop targeting you and hopefully you can stand away from her and the tank can reach an aggro threshold where she won't go back onto afterwards. It doesn't appear to drop threat. I use a LIP pretty often in our ony kills as a warlock since I am not an engineer.
---
I feel ya bud

It's really odd going from retail hunter to classic hunter.

One has careful timing of spells between autos and the other is literally slamming my face into the keyboard at 120 apm
---
You could do it yes. But nothing beats DM East if you have good runs practiced
---
Yet they still have a use, sometimes very effective in particular situations. Not everything is going to be useful all the time. This leads down the path of skill pruning and you are left with the handful of skills that work in retail today and they are all fundamental to your rotation, no decision making required.
---
You can get rid of it by closing Windows Explorer in the task manager.

No trouble! Hope it helps. Lmk if any of them act funny, I didn't test them in game. I think the help/harm one might be wrong if you wanted to use it, happy to fuck it up if so

Did a quick check on price gold sellers put on a couple of high pop Retain and Classic EU servers. There's ofc extra difference from the fact that you can purchase play time with gold officially, but still. On average Retail gold is worth about 2000-2500 times less than Classic gold. So no, not even close.
---
It's for the aesthetic I believe. The item is indeed trash.

Which is so fucking greedy. Every is paying fucking 12 Euro a month. Those 50v50 battles include players paying 1200 euros a month for a 15 year old game and serverhosting. Seeing the state of the server there must be like 5 euro of those 1200 left over after paying all those shareholders, because fucking 10 euro a month servers could handle this shit. This whole thing is just neoliberal capitalism in a nutshell and every day i start to hate this world we fucking live in more. Can't someone instead of shooting up malls target greedy fucking ass people deserving it for once? Maybe fear will instill some fucking morals in those defenerate greedy subhumans.

No problem. I don't know much about leveling with daggers other than it being problematic, but if you're leveling with 2 people Daggers might be more viable - it's all coming down to ambush/backstab - white hits and SS don't deal that much damage with daggers. That said, you could look into [this combat daggers spec](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/wow-classic-combat-daggers-rogue-leveling-talent-build-1-60) or a more [PvP oriented one](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/rogue-dps-pvp-classic-wow#cold-blood-hemorrhage-with-ghostly-strike) (Not the Hemorrhage one, but the Improved Sprint Backstab one further down). I've only done some 39 PvP with daggers and more late game play, so I'm not very knowledgeable about these builds - I'd probably go with Combat Daggers myself though unless you want to trade away some PvE capability for some added PvP utility and prowess. You could technically work in Parry/Riposte into the Combat Daggers spec as well if you wanted, at the expense of Imp. Evasion and some DW spec points.

Fun fact! If Undead change their language to Gutterspeak then they can use alliance &gt; horde translations to speak to the alliance.

What effort? Sharing facts that most people already know and debunking comments ridden with logical fallacies doesn't take any effort at all. Like I already said, it's just a simple click on warcraftlogs to show how good hunter performs in over 10k different raidlogs.
---
1. educate your group. tell them if they do too much aggro
---
2. use skull, X, ... for target priorities
---
3. respect your healers mana
---
4. build your overall config around your tanking needs.
---
e.g. it should be easy to stance dance into berserker, and charge back into a fight once kicked away. change back to def during charge.
---
have your survivability cooldowns on key binds
---
have health pots on key bind
---
5. use threat plates for better aggro overview for larger groups

6. get 5-6% hit on your gear. so important

When we (a 10 man raid group) wanted to turn in our quest to Emberstife, there were 3 people who had just started fighting him for the quest. We asked them to reset the dragon so we could just quickly turn in our quest and would then in return help them slay Emberstrife. They refused and told us that it will not take long for it to respawn. However they were struggling to kill him and we were just standing next to them, watching them die so we could turn in our quest. Still makes me chuckle :D

Have servers not gotten better since 2004?
---
From the perspective of someone who played Tribes 2 before Ascend, Ascend was already a worse game because it was limited in favor of making it an esport. 
---
Loadouts were customizable and based on the 3 armor weight categories (Heavy, Medium, Light), Vehicles were important for objectives and weren't restricted to purchasing them by objective points as a currency. Maps were much smaller in Ascend compared to 2, but they were much smoother. The worst offense in my opinion was adding hitscan weapons to Ascend; the only hitscan weapon was a laser sniper rifle that used up your energy meter so you couldn't escape immediately after sniping.
---
Just because Hi-Rez is a shit company that crams e-sports down everyones throats in each game they make doesn't mean the originals are shit. They did the same shit in Realm Royale as well with their constant patches changing everything and adding hitscan weapons in that too.
---
Well, first of all they wouldn't be selling 60 boosts quite yet. Maybe in 9.1 or 9.2
---
If they are looking at 1-60 being 100 hours, that would mean 1-50 = 50 hours, and 50-60 = 50 hours (since 10-50 = One expansion worth of content, and 50-60 = One expansion worth of content)
---
Many people will have characters in the 40s-50s anyway as well. Paying to boost to 50 is not going to be as lucrative as it has been.

Yea i mean im alliance and i dont see them wpvp as much as storm so i guess i just never clocked them.

10s each in my server...I wonder how fishing could be so profitable for an under lvl 20, where you can farm hundreds of them in The Barrens with a lure and no fishing skill at all
---
I have no done any in-depth comparisons. It's not like these guys were in bad gear, just not mostly pre-bis or stacking far more Stam/int than shadow damage. I was about 350dps and they were around 200, so it's not as bad as wand dps. As you say, there are a lot of variables in play.
---
Not on my server. A stack of deviat goes for 1g and a bit and stonescale eel so far isn't better, might change with harder content.
---
Its called price fixing
---
Yea, but considering how much control rogues have in PvP, being able to mouseover stuff would transcend rogues from being mere killing machines to fucking gods.
---
You can move the base ui, just right click and remove locked frames or smth.
---
Other faction doesn't see custom emotes. It says something like "so and so gestures strangely" so you can't just use emotes to talk to the other faction.
---
Oh ok thanks.
---
I believe Leatrix Plus can do it, and maybe Elvui as well.
---
i feel the same about shadowlands. sure it looks amazing and fun. but undernearth it's still retail. welfare epics, not challenging, doesnt require any social contact, mount/toy/transmog collection game.
---
I'll stick to classic aswel
---
Our DPS start doing real damage after 20 seconds and it works fine.
---
Is it Savix who has an addon for that?
---
Yes, but why won't it work in horde?
---
Or you know.... be rolled by whoever is specced for the weapons.
---
&gt; the other is literally slamming my face into the keyboard at 120 apm
---
That was early Wrath wasn't it?
---
just reply with "Go back to your home country".
---
It works everytime.
---
Weakauras
---
Yeah I agree with that - he was just saying it costs a bomb to run MC when in reality it doesn't need to. Also the fact he said that people aren't great at raiding makes me think he doesn't need consumes either.
---
These guilds have dual wield warriors in full T1 and co.
---
At most that’s like 5% though, not saying it doesn’t happen but I’d be skeptical if a hunter told me it resisted twice, in a row
---
paid transfer wont fix this. There are nearly no balanced servers if they opened paid transfers all hordes would flock to to that server and make it unbalanced. Should have just rolled alliance everyone could see this happening from miles away.
---
Because that is how statistics works.
---
I dont think this is true and honestly if it was it would be a huge mistake.
---
Catering your design to the audience you used to have is a meaningless endeavor when the potential new market is always larger.
---
There are simply more of the next generation than there is of the former.
---
What is most likely happening is that they are realizing WHY this type of designed was so appealing in the first place and what they have been trying to peddle to the next generation of consumers is what they percieved they would like rather than build off the foundation of what they know was already well liked by the previous generation.
---
In a sense, they dont make Diablo 4 more like Diablo 1/2 because they want that audience back. They make Diablo 4 more like Diablo 1/2 because it was a proven success with that previous audience and something of a similar design would likely appeal to a new generations audience as well.
---
Its the whole point of what Kaplan is saying here, its that the old system actually did work quite well and that exposing this system to the newer audience is likely to work well still.
---
This a RP server?
---
That guild sounds kinda corrupt.  If they are mandating things go to a guild bank the guild should be providing things to its raiders.  
---
Im happy i found a guild that does dkp. You raid you get points to spend on gear. The more you raid the more points you have to spend. Nothing more fair then that.
---
Thats exactly what i said. And that happened because of arenas.
---
FD not dropping combat, extremely dependant on your controls success to win, can't control anything that is dotted, pet doing crap... And also, the majority of the time when I PvP I'm indoor and being LoS like hell, I'm just not having the fun I had in the past. Also, there were these duels I lost against druids that didn't even cast a single spell, they simply spammed moonfire and killed me. I am not exaggerating on this one : 250 500 250 250 500 250 250 500 500 250 250 dead, just moonfire, this really ruined my experience. 
---
I'm not complaining, it's just not for me. I used to nomatch most non-warlock, non-SP ennemies in duel but I can't anymore, that's why I'm giving up.
---
Roll a pve alt and play that when your friends aren't around if you enjoy the game enough to risk playing alone.  I just found a guild that is one of the most helpful ever and super chill on Mankrik sever and the people have been awesome to play with. 
---
Now for the dickish part: you need to toughen up. Going through life and constantly getting offended or dismayed by the actions of others--a thing you cannot control--will result only in misery for you. That doesn't mean you shouldn't have feelings or even stop being sensitive, just don't expect for people to respond in kind. Honestly, if you're getting offended by this shit, it sounds like you've had a pretty easy life so far. A lot of people don't have that luxury and they become hardened and desensitized as defense mechanism and some of those people go on to be assholes because they want to make others feel as shitty as they do. The rest of us just go on and deal with shit. We adapt and overcome and just move on because you can't control it, you can't stop it-- it has always been this way and will always be this way. It's basic human nature. Don't let it defeat you, rise above it and enjoy life the best you can.
---
that talent tree is mind boggingly massive. i love it, except the fact you cant redo them (i think?)
---
thanks! It seems to be able to be pushed back too?
---
-Xp gained is based on the average lvl of the group. You have to invite more players your lvl or lower to decrease the average lvl of the group. If you can clear Deadmines in 4 pulls ( let’s say 15 minutes ) with a full group , let’s say 1 60 and 4 lvl 15s the average lvl of the group will be 24. You will be getting drastically more xp an hour doing 4 runs vs 1 single run with the average lvl of 18. 
---
-Tabing in and out is pretty simple stuff there mate, idk what to say if you think that’s complicated. You can also just put your character on follow on one of the other people in the dungeon and they will gladly keep you safe for the free runs
---
Ascend was far from perfect. It was buggy, poorly optimised and HiRez couldn't balance for shit.
---
That said the ways in which Ascend was different to the previous Tribes games was not the reason for its downfall. In fact my comment is saying that vet players from previous games made things worse by being the vocal minority. Demanding they be catered to despite the fact that the game as it was had found huge popularity.
---
HiRez were a bunch if bloody idiots who made mistake after mistake, they shoulder the blame for their game dying. One of their mistakes was listening to vets who whined about how much better mechanics were in previous games (e.g. no health regen).
---
i mean they've directly said levelling from 1-50 will be 70% faster than it currently takes to level to 120 in retail, but you go off chief
---
Luna Unit Frames might be something to look into.
---
consumables are needed to compensate for low gear and don't be left behind.
---
other than that yeah, hardly ever need. done mc 2 times, with only a couple of wipes tops. dm buffs are just for speed up the process for early bosses. never used a flask.
---
Pre-BiS dagger is: 6 price shadowcraft + devilsaur set. MH= shadowfoot stabber, OH = distracting dagger.
---
I have 3/8 and honestly find the set bonus completely useless.
---
If my pet is talking enough dmg to get killed, mend pet isnt gonna do shit to stop it
---
Here's a base that you can adapt. Note that I didn't multibox on official server.

Water elementals in epl/felwood for essence of water. Idk what they go for on your realm, but could be a goldmine.
---
What the fuck are you talking about? David Brevik has never worked on PoE or worked with the GGG company. He did an interview with them and thats all.
---
The last ARPG David Brevik worked on was Marvel Heroes in 2013.
---
Duels are pretty shitty as a hunter tho. Just like my GF, a hunter needs space. Duelling kind of prevent you from doing what you do best which is kiting.
---
FD will drop combat but only if you call back your pet first btw, I struggled a lot with this but after I started macroing FD it worked out fine.
---
Sure is, done it TONS of times :D

---
STV depends on your faction balance a bit, but can be a mess with PvP - especially if you are in the smaller faction. There is a decent amount of quests there though (e.g. kill 10 of young/normal/elder raptor/tiger/panther...).
---
I did my early 30s in Ashenvale I think and that was nice and fairly empty. You could also transition to Thousand Needles (there are a bunch of quests in the southern part of it which are early 30) or Desolace (not too many quests, but again pleasantly empty), but both are a bit annoying to reach.
---
Also after Stockades I think there is Gnomeregan near Ironforge.
---
The real questions being asked here
---
Shits a fucking mess. I will check out phase 2 but it will probably be a total wash for the type of prestigious wpvp I like.
---
Bruhve... Do I spy Ironfoe in the hands of a Dwarf?! If so Congrats! Although the Undead Rogue in me feels the need to point out that the language Buff is all but wasted on you. The 2 free swings however... Light guide you!
---
I never played the previous games but fell in love with Ascend, clocking easily 500 hrs during its short life. No game can replicate the unique feeling of the core components of Tribes; jetpacks, skiis and spinfusors.
---
Not sure I think it should be possible to upload someone else's character at all tbh. Like someone else said earlier this feels like it should be opt-in and not opt-out. I personally don't mind the service but if someone doesn't want to be on the site it shouldn't be up to them to have to make an account in order to opt-out of something, but rather it should be up to everyone that wants to share their character to upload imo.
---
Because not all phrases are available for both sides.
---
I got silenced for 1 day for calling someone a shitter in world because they deserved it.
---
That quest was easy
---
I can even figure out what spell this is, let me know I wanna see it at a distance.
---
Any link for a tutorial on this? Im fairly savvy with network stuff but never heard of the router wide adblock thing
---
Ret dps is still better than Druid or Shaman dps.
---
€ ÀÁ Š 1 1 € is my favorite to trigger those undead rogues
---
i have only ever seen ganking shadowpriests when they are partied with others. If they are solo it's usually because they are just farming some quest mobs.
---
Leveling warriors have a similar connection too, they know what each other has to go throught, but once they hit 60, that connection disappears.
---
What are common druid specs for dungeons/world PvP?  
---
Is a split spec viable if you want to do both healing and tanking 5-10man dungeons? If yes, which one would you recommend?
---
This is not a rule of the ToS. It never has been.
---
Apparently gnomes don't have to worry about it.
---
You lost me at effort
---
How did he not ding once from discovery experience?
---
They're talking about the system, not the balance of it in classic.
---
reply to know aswell
---
Open world or duels? Duels it's probably warlocks open world probably rogues
---
Is there a good, free,  in game leveling addon? Like Joana's but then free. An addon that tells you what quest to do next, where to walk to, what hearthstone place to you etc. Thanks
---
You want people to pull aggro in phase 1. At least when ony starts the P2 transition, so the tank doesn't get fireballed.
---
Is that... Elijah Wood?
---
I was always jumping into MC by falling off the bridge on the right side, until I noticed the "you died" message that pops in chat just before I zone in. Apparently I die from falling in the shallow lava but I still appear inside MC, with no buffs and with reduced durability.
---
One of the few balanced PvP servers. Big up Yojamba!
---
There are far better and more accessible shoulders than Devout Mantle. It's not worth the ass-pains to get.
---
This post hurts to read.....
---
Someone else also said that it sometimes bugs and gives you too much +healing.
---
Healing role is the less consumable dependent class out of the whole pool. Major Mana potions are not required for current content. A cheap spirit buff food like tender wolf steak or AD revered spirit buff drink, a few stacks of mana potions, a few regular fire protection potions and you are good to go. If you want the extra mile farm some Satyrs for Demonic Runes. For mana intensive fights you want to pop a mana regen consumable every time it is off on cooldown. Go down to 70% mana, pop a potion, then pop it the moment it goes off CD, that's the trick. Nothing else needed.
---
The list you posted is for 20-man split runs.
---
You don't get dishonorable kills for killing lowbies, only for killing 'Civilians'.
---
The company exists to make money to make more money... everything else some necessity between them and ROI.  Whatever gimmicky, nostalgia-drenched, heart tugging, sentiment-filled anecdote can keep our attention for a few more minutes... or least one more billing cycle.

&gt; A week ago, I was banned for using a third party or boots
---
Was it rare boots, or epic boots?
---
Personally I only run in greens, I dont want to risk a ban too
---
Feral Druids (tank and cat) become actually good with BWL and peak out at AQ 40.
---
AQ40 times, feral druids can be easily top dps if they are well equipped.
---
That and the quest can be very aggravating due to disruptions. We had to work together tonight so we could all get it, taking turns, buffing, and lots of waiting. It was pretty wholesome.
---
Dishonorable kill is only for certain PNJ only. Lvl60 can kill all the low level they want without any risk
---
100% of the time when someone says they were banned for "nothing". They were banned for exactly what they were accused of.
---
Also, what the hell are we suppose to do about it? Why post your story here?
---
haha need to edit my post :P
---
I got gnomish to horde "addicted to soft feet" poggers
---
I feel like there is more to this story...
---
The best option would probably be to download simcraft and try different setups to see which gives the best DPS (look up classic simcraft, it's currently in development but at least rogue module should be fully functional).
---
No clue how you saw a fist there.
---
You can make weakauras for it, pretty easy
---
sry, my English isn't that good
---
Thanks for the reply. I assumed it was a bit overboard for the current content I just wanted to make sure I was over prepared for my first guild run
---
you have no clue how the pvp system works.
---
29 twink ?
---
Again, I'm trying to emphasize that vet players from previous games did not cause the downfall of T:A. The final patch giving vets what they wanted didn't cause the downfall of the game, the game was already on the way out due to the previous patches that HiRez kept implementing. One of the most egregious cases of this **had absolutely nothing to do** with players being vocal, it was greed. They have, multiple times, implemented weapons that could only be purchased with real money that were actually broken. But when the weapons were available for purchase for the f2p players 2~ weeks later, they finally nerfed them. 
---
Realm Royale is the most recent example of HiRez being at fault because there's no Vet community you can blame there. They had a great somewhat unique Battle Royale game that was getting popularized by quite a few streamers but started to make large fundamental changes to the game that as far as anyone could tell, no one asked for.
---
Spirit is mana regeneration. If it’s + healing that’s need to me.

I main druid myself and I almost only use this youtube channel for all druid builds, info etc. He is an amazing druid player and has a lot of knowledge.

For example if you are looking for a PvP to choose. Watch one of his newer videos.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfRwuVkhZgw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfRwuVkhZgw)
---
Nice! You'll literally never replace this ring, because ring of spellpower never drops!
---
Don't let this guy talk you out of it! You can downrank spells in your rotation to help with mana problems. Fights don't last as long with the efficiency of the new meta, so you have less worry about going oom. We have 1 boomkin in our raid. With the right items he does pretty decent dps, does well on mana, and adds 3% spell crit to our mage group. It may not be better than just taking another mage, but I don't see it being so bad that it just shouldn't be done.
---
That not how it work.
---
Your standing isn't linearly linked to the honor you earn. 
---
It's calculated relatively to the other people from your faction.
---
So if you are the first one of the side of the realm you will earn 13k standing. 
---
Having the first place with 6k honor is the same as being first place with 100k.
---
Could also be bandwidth issues.
---
Why would he be ? His quest to completely sink down WoW is going well !
---
yes it will be an additional 10%. The only person who can answer the question is you. I bought mine because I want the ability to chase people down, especially with carrot on a stick, spurs, and glove enchant.
---
no lol
---
 
---
- Blizzard
---
I killed bats and plague hounds in all yestwrday for an hour and made ~50g. Not amazing, but pretty good for casual and mindless creature slaughtering.
---
Depends entirely on the gear of the party, the difficulty of the mobs, and the party composition. I've found that especially in caster heavy lineups you may as well not bother with CC.
---
The AoE that a party of casters can dish out is very high, and CC'ing a few mobs will just make them have to single target that stuff down afterwards for no reason. Generally, the healer OOMs about as fast as the casters anyway, so CC'ing can end up making your casters the limiting factor, rather than your healer.
---
And even for melee heavy lineups, if the healer and/or tank has good gear, or you're just doing something relatively low level like BRD, it can be the better choice, as the healer doesn't really OOM anyway and more rage is good.
---
Or point your dns to ad guard for an easier solution
---
hoping to get some fuzzed about it, so Blizz can get the finger out their ass and do somthing.
---
Sounds accurate. Grass is always greener, m'dude.
---
How does one select region before logging in? My battle.net simply won’t connect
---
53-54 is a decent time to start grinding out your prebis list from stuff like BRD and if you want your full prebis you'll want to farm ST for the offhand. 
---
i'm not sure what spec you are for leveling but SM/Ruin build would probably allow you to drain tank/quest decently as well as do good dungeon DPS. 
---
As for what dungeons to do your prebis is kind of all over the place. Sunken Temple has 2 items that are prebis for you, but they're also incredibly RNG to get. BRD is always a good choice to run as its decent EXP and you'll have some good upgrades in there, the boots off argelmech are great, and your prebis belt drops off of the arena event. I would run them until you're 55-56, you'll want to save the princess at some point as well for the ring.  
---
Once you get to 58-59 the whole end game dungeon system opens up more for you. If your goal is to PVP I would probably grind Scholo for the caster set as it has a lot of the stats you'll want on it.
---
Yea, Alliance :)
---
Same. Art style was really cool and combat felt good but everything is so complicated. So many meaningless skill trees that just feel like gates to actual skills.
---
Just wondering, how long is a clear for you as a warlock?
---
In BRM i rez people into the lava while having a buddy keep me alive.
---
I of course use rank 1 so people die instantly and don't even have mana to prevent it.
---
If you wanna be a dick, do it in a video game instead of real life. It's a great way to deal with downtime when you're locked out of dungeons too and there's no alliance to kill.
---
The repair costs are the icing on top.
---
What I'm trying to say is, stop telling others how to play the game you insufferable entitled prick.
---
&gt; That's actually the exact reason why people switched from pservers to Classic.
---
Is it? Or is it because pservers were closed?
---
I bet you were one of the skilled horde killing alliance nonstop 5v1 in STV and laughing to yourself..   you’ve dug your own grave mate.  You didn’t want fair PVP, you demonstrated that much. I hope Blizzard never allows you to transfer off the hell you’ve made for yourself.
---
Ah, ok - that blows that plan out of the water. Thanks for the clarification.
---
:-)
---
Tyr's Hand in EPL. Truck loads of cloth, random greens/blues and the occasional backpack. The mobs also drop a respectable amount of raw gold as compared to others. Make sure you interrupt the heals and the mobs here are cake. If you want to farm bats (also EPL), they drop strangely pricey grey vendor trash.
---
It isn't in the case of devilsaur mafias. I don't think blizzard would care in this case either
---
"We need paid transfers because I am not going to reroll 23 days played of my life."
---
But you're not getting paid transfers. So you can quit or re-roll. Your call
---
I always saw it as a helmet with green "hair"
---
Right click your health bar unlock.
---
Doesn't do combo points but then it's a specific add-on search for that
---
This is made exactly to balance those talents, Flurry as a free-to-enter talent would make it even more impossible to skip than it is now since, with the correct gear, it's pretty much a permanent 30% auto attack damage increase on top of extra rage generation, think of it as a 10 points talent with the extra perk of going very angry if you get crit'ed, same with the crit damage multiplier increase talent in Arms.
---
Talentgating isn't that much of a problem, the problem is mainly talents that aren't ever taken because of how deep they are in the tree compared to their usefulness, those talents should be revamped to be viable options even if niche.
---
Seems like they banned everyone who used mouse-/keyboardcontrollers
---
I used a bot for fishing (shame on myself), which pretty much got me the ban. The other thing I used was a macrotool which repeated simple inputs (keyboard and mouse).
---
Both these tools couldn't get detected if I used something like teamviewer, but in my understanding, skype and teamviewer can technically fall in the same category and so, be bannable.
---
So all in all: If you use a tool which emulates mouse or keyboard inputs, ask if that tool got you the ban. They don't ban you because a computer told them to, if you got a long ban, you got proofed by a human and they had a reason behind it.
---
And to your title, nobody will believe you, because 99 % of the people banned tell the same here...
---
TSM didn't get you the ban, there would be a gigantic banwave if they'd ban TSM users
---
Is it true that Windfury totem's enchant only lasts 10 seconds on my group's weapons?  If so, why does the totem last for 2 minutes?
---
400g is really not that much for a mage lol
---
The server has to tell 80-100+ players that the glowy frostbolt effect or the blizzard/fire raining from the sky *where and how* to render. The server processing the rendering of these objects in real-time with locations and properties of these particles changing constantly, combined with syncing everyone's damage, everyone's hp, etc. causes quite a bit of instructions to be delayed. Aka lag. This would happen to any game ever and its why I brought BDO up, because it happens to deal with this rather well. It just... turns it off. Turns off all the visual effects of other players so the server doesn't have to process them. But that's only in pve. It too runs into some problems processing hundreds of players fighting over Mass PvP objectives, albeit less so than classic's 15 year old engine(including server component).
---
I have no idea what people expect a 15-year old, un-refactored un-optimized server component be to capable of doing.
---
The best way to check what level you want to be for a dungeon is to check the last boss' level. From memory, SFK: 26, BFD: 28, RFK: 32(?). 
---
As a healer you can be much lower (5-6 levels)
---
As a dps, you can be 4 levels lower, any lower and you will miss or be resisted too much
---
As a tank your threat will suffer unless you're 2-3 levels lower
---
Diablo 3 was more fun to me than PoE ever was. I couldn't get past the ruined city in PoE in three playthroughs due to boredom, but I've sunk hundreds of hours into D3.
---
So maybe I'm not a 'real' ARPG fan, or... maaaaybe PoE isn't as fun or engaging for some as it is for others?
---
People gotta stop sucking PoE's dick, cuz MAN that pedestal it's up on is way too tall.
---
Weak auras
---
Nah, those are cheap.
---
Pretty sure you can't win/honor trade as easily on pservers. Well i've not heard of anyone doing it.

But if you add spaces it's just characters being translated not words

---
Might want to calm down a bit.
---
type. /range 20
---
Yeah, apparently it doesn't work quite like I thought.
---
I knew high levels didn't get honourable kills from significantly lower players, but didn't realise the dishonourable kill was for NPC civilians only.
---
On alliance dominated servers, do you just seemingly camp areas for no real reason as well or no?
---
You shouldn’t speak about a game you haven’t played. Poe combat is slow to start, but that’s kind of the point of a game like that. You start off as a weak hero and become a god with every peace of gear upgrade and skill point decision you make.
---
In diablo 3 you are a god from the start and there’s pretty little difference between a level 60 and level 1 aside from the skills.
---
Ok, first learn to actually use your pet bar instead of leaving it on auto. Remap your keys if you have to. You think warlock is easy but in reality you have to play two characters. You and your pet. 
---
Second of all, don't open with death coil. It is your clutch spell when everything else is lost: mana, life, pet, healthstone, drain life, use all of these tools before using death coil.
---
Will of the forsaken? Well, sucks to be you but it lasts for 5 seconds. You have to survive those 5 seconds and then you're good. Unless it's a warrior. I'm sorry. This is why it's important to save death coil for last. Because death coil is not fear. It's a horror effect and can't be wotf'ed or blocked by warrior's fear immunity.
---
Necropile is shit. Get some decent gear. I'll make you a list if you're willing to grind Dire Maul and Strat.
---
Free action potions? Nah, fuck that. Free action potion doesn't remove disabling effects that are already on you. Limited invulnerability potion? That's your best friend.
---
Good luck. If none of these work, just roll undead.
---
Why do people do this over jumping in the lava?
---
Man, if the other Druid was shaman instead, that would be insane melee cleave with wind fury totem sweetness
---
If mobs are gray for any member of party - rest would be getting ~5% of exp per kill.  
---
Best "boost" is done by characters that 8-9 levels higher than you.
---
No chances. :/^)
---
I would prioritize doing DMW first -&gt; DME  -&gt; DMW to first pick up your water quest, then do the water quest in DME and lastly turn it in again. I guess you could also find someone with the key that can open the door in DMN and let you skip the 2 DMW runs since you only need the library for the water quest. But since you want gear and xp anyway you might as well do the full DMW runs. Like someone else said I would also do atleast 1 full DME run to get your key, but if you only want the water asap, most ppl do the water elemental and satyr in the jump runs anyway.
---
When I told my coworker I’m going on the RPPVP server because RPPVP is traditionally the best WPVP server type they laughed at the word RP. Now they’re on a 30/70 server on the losing faction and seeing all the Grob posts of mass WPVP.

Only issue the server has is a couple cancer guilds

It's been 3 months.  Economies are irreversibly fucked.  Prices will change but they'll never be retail normalised.
---
Bring up your character/inventory sheet. Go to the Pet tab. It should be right at the top.
---
The problem is that there are no threat meters/plate on the standard UI and so many DPS don't have them so they have no idea of threat  they or tank have and just instant DPS/Aoe tank has no rage 100% fault of blizzard entertainment and  the DPS it's only the tanks fault if healer pulls aggro in 1 heal if all mobs hitting the tank
---
If you haven't tried retail, you may as well check it out. Plenty of flaws in the current expansion but there's reasons Wow is so popular.
---
ahh, thank you thank you.  make perfect sense now
---
Thanks man. I appreciate that. I do like healing.
---
Yeah but it doesn't work like that unless he was brought into the group as a tank and they requested he goes DPS. Otherwise I can just roll on all the shadow gear I want by telling every pug that my OS is disc
---
I'm to stoopid to get it I think. I no oonderstand
---
Ligma
---
No it's not. Blizzard and Rain of fire/hellfire aoe spells that have a 5sec channel and its spamable 
---
That easily pulls aggro off considering Whirlwhind can only be used in zerker stance and not in defensive stance and has a 10 sec cd
---
I mean it has worked like that for all raids I have been in. You are allowed to choose your main spec before the raid no matter what role you fill.
---
I'm not trying to be antagonistic at all but I don't remember a time when HiRez bent over backwards for any of the vets from older Tribes. In fact they were mostly hostile towards people who criticized them, such as when they [entirely pulled a map](https://i.imgur.com/g5h2xn6.jpg) because people complained about changes to it.
---
could ask this about any faction dominated server
---
1) No, keep the bonus drop hit from someplace else (question 2 and 3)
---
2) No, use HOJ or the Loadstone
---
3) use non hit shoulders if you are at 12%
---
keep the Dsaur bonus for now and focus on other gear. dropping the hit trinket drops you to 10% if you get HOJ/Loadstone which is fine. NS shoulders would bring you back up to 11%. once you have those is when i would look into breaking the Dsaur bonus for T1/T2 items
---
I'd rather have eye of org and maidens circle over the course of a raid you'll be able to go faster and have less downtime and 3 spell dmg isn't worth it
---
Look at my dagger. It's placed wrong.
---
&gt;I used Teamviewer when classic come out. for the loggin que, same as many others. thats it.
---
That's what I meant, the human proofing you probably saw that and decided it's okay (a friend of mine does this since every addon launch ever and to avoid the luciferon EU queues and didn't get a ban).
---
There's another thing which got you the ban. You got banned in a wave, if you did something wrong on that account a month ago, that could also be the reason.
---
There's a reason behind your ban, nobody will believe you that there isn't. The only ban I ever read of which wasn't deserved and got reversed was by somebody who played wow out of an internet cafe.
---
Must be a terrible noob. Straight ignore list material.
---
I mean from a technical standpoint, wasn't spell batching originally a thing to prevent this kind of thing from happening?
---
he's alrdy in aq patch
---
Click on your character settings (idk what it’s called, where you see your armor, reputation, skills, etc) there will be a separate tab for pet and it will show loyalty level at the top.
---
I did the same but I selected Europe and got in.
---
Do you a source what are normal retail prices? Where are you getting that from.
---
It's been like that on private servers for years, nothing new to see here. If you want to get away from people like that I suggest you play other games than WoW Classic since it attract a lot of people like that.
---
People throwing around the welfare epics line should just come to terms with the fact that the color purple just doesnt mean the same thing anymore as it did back then. Thats literally all it is. A color. 
---
Of course getting a 370 ilvl epic for basically free feels like welfare, but getting a 450 ilvl epic is just as great as getting an epic back then, or even more so, since its mythic loot so less accessible than epic loot in Classic.
---
I was playing on Horde Skearm when the game first released. I had to take the last month off to focus on my studies. It sounds like Skearm's server balance is awful now, so I'm looking to find a new home. So a few questions:
---
Are there any PVP servers that are nearly balanced? 
---
Also, what is Grobbulus really like? The RPPVP has me intrigued, but whenever I look at the subreddit it is talking about how the main guild is a white supremacy guild...
---
I’m super excited for 40 and up. My mouth has been watering at the thought of getting Mortal Strike. Getting Whirlwind attack alone flipped my playstyle upside down and forced me to learn and appreciate stance dancing to make full use of all my best abilities. I’ve never had so much fun playing a warrior. I leveled one through BC and tanked through Wrath but the classic experience puts them both to shame.
---
Came for the bells.
---
Lolwut since when do boomers do math and research things?! I don’t get this insult.
---
 Icy Veins and Wowhead seem to agree:
---
1. Spell Power (or +Shadow Damage);
---
2. Spell Crit Chance;
---
3. Hit Chance until 16%;
---
4. Spell Penetration
---
5. Intellect;
---
6. Stamina;
---
7. Spirit.
---
&gt; Is it just me or does it feel like dungeons are really favored towards Horde?
---
It is. And not only dungeons - even flymasters and city locations are more favored towards Horde.  
---
Root cause of this - Blizzard first developed Alliance side, carefully placing quests, locations, dungeons and hubs distributed in the world. But then they where close to release and they need to create Horde quests/cities/etc, so they just quickly drop hubs on the remaining empty places.  
---
And this remaining empty places where in the middle of the maps, closer to dungeons, because rest was already occupied by Alliance.
---
No, you just feel entitled because you play too much.
---
Anybody?
---
Maybe I’m getting confused lol. Lemme log in and check.
---
I want to see this hot rogue without her guild tabard......
---
Why dont the alliance have representatives like this?
---
Pretty much asking for the personal resource bar from retail
---
Yeah I really like that in retail too 
---
I wouldn't mind an addon for it in classic
---
nah even when people dont have or dont wanna pay they still give something. i would do like 40s20c or 60s90c to be cheeky
---
Thats way too soon, I don't understand why is there such a need to rush a 15 y.o game.
---
agreed. i pretty much only have corruption, a curse and then shadow bolts. but i love shadowbolts.
---
i prefer the simple damage 'rotation' with lots of utility buttons on the side
---
Maybe with some more Intellect your character might learn to hold it correctly!
---
^ see above for a typical toxic "get gud" neckbeard
---
I'm still looking at a huge stack of free Win 10 Pro licenses that just won't shrink because every time Dell replaces one of our mainboards, we get a new one. But we run volume licensing so we don't need that.
---
Doesn't Rivenspike stack with Faerie Fire? Should I use it if we have a druid in the raid (or just tell him to not use Faerie Fire). Also for orc warrior which is the better, Rivenspike or Deep Woods?(for MH)
---
As one of those 25 year old kiddies that pushed for spell batching, I did a shitty writeup about its positives [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dplm9t/spell_batching_needs_to_be_tuned_down/f5wz27o/) and another one about cool classic mechanics, most of which are enabled by spell batching, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dr21xo/this_game_is_far_too_researched/f6ggpvu/).
---
Yes, base threat is the same for all buffs as is scaling by rank.
---
Guardian's Favor is definitely very good for 5 mans or even in raids to save DPS or get aggro back. Imp Conc Aura is a tech because I also do low level dungeon farming with this spec and often you macro into Concentration aura to heal yourself up without getting interrupted.
---
If you don't do dungeon farming, then you can put points into Toughness. 
---
Also the 2 points in improved BoW and Lasting Judgement in the holy tree are variable, they are both to help with dungeon farming.
---
Blaumeux has definitely been great. He gave me a fish and next time I seen him said I smelled fishy how rude
---
Not according to my experience. But as I wrote in my first comment. This is my experience. I don't doubt your experience can differ from mine :)
---
True, could be warlock troll and shaman troll  would make more sense than mage troll.
---
its a legit question,
---
Welcome to noggenfogger! I’m Finnley (Tauren warrior)
---
the shit that bugs me is players in group that complain about lack of hit, but haven't done the easy wyrmhide spaulders quest. these players drive themselves crazy over 24 attack power, as if that's make or break for them in MC.
---
Is that.. the Baron Rivendale mount?
---
Actual, real physical pain was felt for every moment after the 2017 blizzcon announcement and leading up to release.  The release date announcement was like twisting the dagger in my heart when it wasn’t going to be early summer.  Now that were here, all I can say is what a long, strange trip it’s been so far.  Happiest time of my entire life.
---
anyone else having trouble logging in?
---
Maybe ill give it another shot. I have been trying to not buy skills so i dont even have whirlwind yet becuase i have been trying to save for a mount. Im at 30g but im just thinking about skipping it and buying the mount around 45-46 when i will prob have the gold
---
It's definitly easier than it was on pservers.
---
The numbers are assigned in the order that you have joined channels.  They are not tied to any channels.  I /join'd lfg before the official LookingForGroup channel so my LookingforGroup is on 5 and lfg is 4.
---
If I were to leave lfg then "4" would be assigned to whatever I joined next
---
I do farming devilsaur if I can hold down more than one spawn.
---
Wasn't off spec. it was completely on my spec. 
---
Vanilla was never like this.
---
those boots aren't even bis for mage tho
---
verify? because thats an interesting trick
---
Heal/tank is not the best choice for new druid players.  
---
Better to take hybrid cat/bear. They use almost same gear, you will not sacrifice DPS in the world and just kill stuff faster than heal/tank.
---
Something like this - https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/014005001-5050321303222151-05
---
still better than no pvp, even more braindead raids, and crazy lag with trash layering to boot.
---
Until you need Shadowland to play new tbc
---
https://discord.gg/QSYxjfx
---
&gt;First things first. Don't think that everyone knows the bis for every class. They don't.
---
&gt;In my case tonight, I (a priest) know I need my FIre resist set for mc.
---
What a way to start a post. Fascinating.
---
Meanwhile, me da stronk and simple warrior just charge forward to the spot where you can see the boss every time, spamming howling and the macro, then run out.
---
we do Ony + MC in 2-2.5 hours 
---
if we were better with travel time and not forgetting to douse a random rune in MC that would be faster

If you're shadow tell the mage to quit crying
---
Don't. Absolutely a waste of money.
---
There's been problems the last few days, just keep trying and you'll hopefully get in.
---
Plate/mail mostly, and you just outlast everyone. Divine Favor + Holy shock for 1k bursts of damage, add in judgments and melee procs. you will never do a ton of damage, but you also can barely be killed if played right
---
It is, its from Episode 8, The Last Patrol where one of the guys gets hit with a random mortar from across the water
---
That's why you're 60 and he's 57 2 months in
---
I didnt claim to know. I stated what it appeared to me as. Learn the difference before you get defensive.
---
They could have shrunk down and revamped the talent tree.
---
yeah, for each city. there are 3 cities. therefore, 9 stacks of each?
---
It should, since it was one of the things that was "fixed" in BC.
---
You right. That's what I meant to say.
---
Fair enough,  I'm going to give it a shot. I want the cat mount lmao. I'd go for the mechanostrider , but being a human leaves me with slim options
---
Same talent trees, different talents as some talents have become main stay abilities for all specs. You get one every 5 levels after lvl 10. 
---
Source: I played the demo and looked my talents
---
As stated in the title, I am not across the BiS for every other class.
---
Further it is not a ninja. That language is my point exactly. I have a need for them and just because it's BiS for someone else doesn't mean they get it gifted. When did this become a thing? It's bullshit. Go grind more.
---
&gt; Catering your design to the audience you used to have is a meaningless endeavor when the potential new market is always larger.
---
This is absolutely incorrect. Business-wise, it's better/cheaper to retain customers than it is to make new ones.
---
This has literally never happened.
---
Ah yes, judging a film or book by it's cover. No one in history has ever advised against such an act.
---
Just note that hit chance basically only matters in raiding
---
...not that it matters since there are only 2 pieces of gear with spell hit right now(not sure if any lock Tier 1 has hit)
---
Consent was given the second one makes a character on a pvp server. Just sayin...
---
Buzz fucking Killington over here
---
The torch room is no longer viable? What did the patch change?
---
Yeah i was thinking the same thing to begin with. Just so i can gear up and then swap to a hybrid spec. My goal is world pvp.
---
:,D
---
I love standing next to the healers as their defender. Whoops, you got agro on a mob, here's a nice frost nova so you can walk away. Oh look, we've butt pulled, have a sheep! 
---
I think it's a lot of fun, I've avoided spell cleave groups because of it
---
Shaman pros:
---
- High burst damage
---
- 6 Second CD interrupt (5 if talented)
---
- Utility, powerful heals, purge, Poison Cleansing totem, Grounding totem, Tremor totem all have strong PvP appliances. 
---
- Relatively beefy with mail armor vs melees.
---
- High skill ceiling with Fire nova combos, healing jukes and totem usage
---
Cons
---
- Easily overwhelmed with lack of oh shit button other than Nature's Swiftness (if talented)
---
- Runs out of mana very easily.
---
- No hard CC
---
- Itemization can be difficult
---
There's some out of the top of my head. In 1v1 situations vs melees I find myself mostly kiting with Earthbind totem dropping fire nova &amp; throwing Chain Lighting &gt; Shock combos every 6 seconds. Against mages &amp; warlocks I might throw some Lightning bolts too and focus on countering Poly with Grounding totem &amp; Fear with Tremor totem.
---
What I like about ele is the burst potential &amp; counterplay that the kit offers, well timed grounding totems against polymorphs, poison cleansing against blind, tremor against fear are very satisfying.
---
Another positive for Ele is the lack of cooldown dependency.
---
Looks like you are Alliance, so for you I have a gift - [Jame's Alliance Leveling Guide - Chapter I (30-41) [old version]](http://www.wow-pro.com/leveling_guides/jame039s_alliance_leveling_guide_chapter_i_3041_old_version)
---
That's a great way to artificially inflate the competition for items that already have a lot of competition.
---
Grinding consumables between raids hasn't been a secret since 2004
---
that was the intention behind doing it, we wanted him to call his guild so we could fight haha
---
Probably true. But I'd consider that part if the endgame and not necessarily leveling.
---
Def this
---
&gt; No new talent row at 60.
---
You get an entirely new talent system at 60
---
you can kill those 2 murlocs by meleeing them from 0 range, otherwise they evade ...
---
Zug zug
---
If you're going to eat it all anyway what difference does it make to calorie intake lol
---
What are random places? Might just be a place where horde have a reson to be but you do not know why.
---
There have been numerous examples of people being wrongly banned and being ignored by Blizzard CS.
---
&gt;They come across to me as a people who have failed at life and feel the need to try troll people in the game to feel good about themselves. It's actually quite sad.
---
Oh?
---
The recipe is a 1% drop. You can farm it up in an hour or so. That's what I did for mine as alliance.
---
Not really, turns out that people want to gear for their main spec.
---
lol why was he banned from twitch
---
evade is the better dodge, heals to full too! just op
---
DM pants are out and vastly superior now (Padre's Trousers).
---
Seems like a good way to break a finger.
---
Heya, currently running dual daggers at the moment.
---
Currently I'm building towards a 21/3/27 build. The only thing I'm really taking from Combat is the Improved Gouge. I do take the improved Ambush in Sub, but only cause I have the dagger to back it up.
---
Do you just vendor the leather or sell on the AH?
---
Or you could listen to people who know what they're talking about. (and use your own judgement ofc)
---
Warrior stacking was popular on pservers and they are also popular in Classic.
---
Channels will end up on /7 or /5 if you've joined other channels before, if you join /lfg before the offical channel it won't be on /4.
---
To be honest, I don't WANT to do this, as that's how I do retail. I'm just hoping for a general bit of advice here to avoid making any major mistakes.
---
Took me 21 runs for the trinket.
---
Yep. We should defenitely just screw all the plans there were and do everything the way a couple of People want it.
---
And while we are at it. 
---
With the release of PVP why not open gates of AQ? I mean there is going to be a huge WorldPVP fight which fits perfectly into Phase2!
---
There isn't supposed to be Content on end for People playing 18hrs a day.
---
Just deal with the fact that they will be in Phase 3. I'm strongly against this because it will COMPLETELY kill World PVP which is what I have been looking Forward to the most.
---
Just take that away from the People because you want BG's right away.
---
Thank you for being considerate!
---
&gt; Source: I played the demo and looked my talents
---
Probably subject to change =)
---
So one is unofficial like /World?
---
"If /gkick and /gquit are on a boat and /gkick jumped off, who is left on the boat?"
---
Ah the good ole days!
---
I do both and see the same hunter still trying to sling magi staff in /1 when my buyer traveled from Orgrimmar and back.
---
So thats about 14g/hour, not too bad. I have to check, how that compares to my server (only fished those for myself).
---
Im talking about the Second Wind trinket with a roughly 9% droprate
---
Close to BlackRock, and it's a horde outpost. Thorium point is easy to get ganked at. 
---
At least in my experience
---
You do know fd can resist?
---
One of the best looking setups on TukUI I've seen. :) Looks a bit similar to mine. Very nice.
---
For PvP you want Agi and Stam gear.
---
It's funny you say that, my boyfriend is the one who introduced me to wow and his main character is a tank haha. I'm trying to level up so I'll be able to play with him. He definitely hears me complain when I run a dungeon with someone who's newer to tanking, although he'll usually play with his alt (mage) with me (druid) when I'm playing
---
People just repeat what they heard on YouTube. And for him the release of DM is probably = Phase 2. Even though that is still to come..
---
Is fire tuned grimoire better than a drake stone of shadow wrath 
---
And similarly is the saphron drape better than the archivist cape of shadow wrath because of spell power vs into and Stam values this is from pve/raiding perspective
---
Not at all
---
The LFG channel isn't offical but people will join it because they just as you don't realise there's an offical channel.
---
The other day in Org a Mage was doing “Food/water, tips appreciated”.  I asked for 3 stacks each, level 45, asked if 1G was good.  He came back with “It’s 1G per stack” and kicked me from the group.
---
Four Cities: Troll and Orc turn ins are both in Org, Tb and UC.
---
No they're not. Most quest givers are not civilians.
---
They do keyrings? I thought its 1.11 aka p6?
---
**^(Activate Windows)**
---
I'm with that. I defenitely want the world pvp for a month or so at least. It is a blast and brings sooooo much Drama to every pvp Server. Makes People quit and other People sherrish!
---
Big part of Classic and shouln't be taken away by BG's right away
---
Get the Mechano!! Everyone will go Cat.
---
I dont understand people some times. Some guys was saying its griefing when you camp a player for hours.... if you keep coming back for hours you are stupid and it's your fault!!! Log off and play an alt, call a friend, take res sickness and run
---
This isn’t a theoretical exactly this was done in retail and exactly the thing people are telling you will happen happened. We have the answer, paid faction transfer is really bad for faction balance. People will 100% just transfer to the dominant faction.
---
&gt; The D4 panels emphasized how dark they want to make the game
---
i never understood this issue with D3. it "not being dark" was so low on the list of issues with the game it didn't even register IMO 
---
the game had serious issues at launch. color pallet and tone were not one of them
---
Yes, this was my attempt at sarcastic humor regarding how annoying it is to get. 
---
But now with DM out, there's another even lower drop rate trinket to hunt, which I still haven't seen drop. Amplifying Cloak, again?
---
Well, you don't, other guy will. What did he lose? Nothing. Only a few minutes.
---
If you're hit cap with 20% crit, survival is fine for raiding until AQ.
---
Ha! The classic drakedog into.
---
Price of cloth has a huge effect on the price of tailoring goods. Most people will try to price their items around the cost it would take to source it all from the AH. If you are getting the cloth for free (as drops), it opens up the profit margins a bit.
---
Of course, at that point you could always just sell the cloth for a higher AH price.
---
Vanilla was fantastic?
---
80 people? I don't know what you're smoking but you should consider rehab.
---
Not *quite* edgy enough, but pretty damn close.
---
Yes it is dependent on when you join the channel. Some fuckery happened to me and I had LFG at 1 and Worldchat at 2, Trade at 5 and general at 4.
---
Ok boomer
---
There is plenty of competition for you because you have to claim your spec when recruited. Raid leader has every right to turn you down or say that you can't roll for shadow gear. If they simply can't get other healers they will take you but there is also a good chance that they don't.
---
On our horde dominated server, they camp all sorts of places at all hours, so I assume ally would do the same if they were the majority.
---
The age old adage comes to mind "If it ain't broke, don't fix it".  People like being given choices to build and customize in games. Even if they are small % gains, the fact is you got to make the choice and not some RNG system.
---
The ubrs wolf meta just does not make much sense for a hunter.
---
You need to do two things man: 1. Spec 17/31/3 (do not worry about getting to 9% hit that much) between 5-8% you'll be fine. With 8% hit I missed 1 aimed shot and 1 multi shot for the whole raid duration.
---
2. With this spec, go find a random cat (get a 60 lvl one from winterspring)  spec it into bite/claw/dash/stealth (forget about growl, it'll be your raid pet) 120 fire res, max stamina that you can get and some random shadow/arcane res. 
---
With these two things your pet will do two times more damage than the wolfs, the buff from the wolf is barely noticable and you are better of just having a high-dps cat.
---
Ehh, it depends. Shaman healers are amazing imo. Wait until you're like 45 to start grinding for BiS. Alot of it is lvl 49+, for now just keep grinding to 60. Once you start running like Mara and Sunken Temple, you can start thinking about that kind of gear.
---
GLHF!
---
Always two sides.
---
Yea he had 3 epic boes before 60 lol
---
Not for Blizzard. If they were focused on maintaining customers, their playerbase would have an average age of 40.
---
Their top 3 franchises (Starcraft, Diablo, WoW) are niche genres. RTS is all but dead. MMORPG is all but dead. Action-RPG (or whatever Diablo is) is the most active of the three, but still very niche.
---
Young players want to pew pew pew. They always have, they always will - Goldeneye, Halo, CoD, Fortnite (which is pew pew + Minecraft). If Blizzard wants to thrive, they need to drive more players into the pew pew game and modernize the Diablo franchise (thus: Diablo Immortal)
---
&gt;bringing back players
---
&gt;attracting people who have never played
---
Yea, one is a former customer who is familiar with your product, and one has never played/used your product and might not know anything about it....the point is still the same
---
It should have been many more people recognizing this iconic 19 rogue twink, you were surrounded by battle.net frontrunning zoomers.  Overwatch 2!  Shadowlands!  All fucking trash compared to this amazing game.
---
How?
---
You can get a legit Win 10 Pro key for less than $10 on amazon,
---
100g is pretty a pretty big difference for me!
---
And does it take 1 week to get the rank or it's done everyday?
---
left of where it says americas there is a dropdown
---
Iirc stamina is more important than int.
---
yo we don't have enough talent points for sl/sl yo that was tbc
---
9/31/11 is fine for molten core, and prob the most all round versatile build
---
20/31/0 if you're serious about pvp, not even rogues can touch you with grim reach
---
you need to bind everything, set up macros for your pets, get rid of your left and right turning keys completely to make room for all the binds you'll need to be competitive, get used to mouse turning
---
honestly specs don't matter much in realistic pvp scenarios, you can win more duels with soul link but in group pvp your job is to keep tongues up on casters, bait kicks, and machine gun if you're left alone, this is why sm/ruin is also fine
---
we get pvp trinkets soon anyway, relax all
---
I want to try it more just to do it. I know it's not a viable option really. I just think it'd be fun and gives me another reason to level hunter and try a different pet.
---
No wonder the price is so low on the Recipe and the Deviate Delights. Mystery solved
---
Has no place on an rp server

Even wrath hunter wasn't as spammy as BFA current hunter.

To make it worse the shit you are spamming feels like it does nothing.

Will give it a try ! thank you
---
Yes, because 440 ilvl will be pretty irrelevant once 8.3 hits. Then 475 will be all the rage.
---
Just view "Welfare Epics" as "Classic Blues" and "Mythic Epics" as "Classic Epics" and then your perception changes.
---
While I dont like ilvl bloat and I hope they adress that with Shadowlands, the purple color just hasnt meant anything ever since item levels became a thing. Back then epics were your endgame gear, nowadays high item level gear are your endgame gear.
---
I play way too much and this is the first time I've been unable to login. Idk what you're smoking.

Ele Shaman is big burst but can be fishing for crits, decent healing even when building damage, lowish mana. They can wear decent armor with a shield and have strong offense support abilities (very low CD interrupt and offensive only dispel). Although it is harder to support allies with totems being a ranged caster that let's you be more selfish with them. 
---
Hunters can outrange you and you don't have much to close the gap as you will probably never be in range for frost shock against a good hunter. Shadow priest can fish for a blackout proc and combo it into a silence to finish you. You can dispel warlocks sacrifice bubble, but with a felhunter or succubus it can be a rough fight. Even with heavy armor, rogues can still mess you up. Mages are are probably a pain, it more depends on the spec how the fight goes. The good news is, most of these fights can be ended by you with a couple of crits but good luck getting them in some situations.
---
Shadow priests melt face. Lots of sustained damage, decent burst damage, good potential to lock your opponent out of playing the game. Has a ton of offensive and defensive tools, but has to go out of shadow form to access many of the defensive tools which is a massive mana sink so no healing for you. Shadow form/inner fire can make you as tanky as plate classes. Sustained mana problems.
---
Can 1v1 pretty much anyone but warlocks with felhunter/succubus, has offensive and defensive dispel so sacrifice bubble is bad against priests. Close matchups are mostly hunters, it's a kill or be  killed where you have until they drain your mana to kill them, Paladins oddly enough because of them having multiple lives and them being a wild card, fire mages can be rough, and rogues can be rough. All of those are even or slightly favor the priest I would say.
---
A lot of this was me looking up matchups so not 100% sure about all of this, but hopefully a good place to start. 1v1 I would recommend spriest, group play I would go with ele shaman.
---
That was exactly what I pointed out but some people are just dumb I guess
---
this is what i want to know, i'm curious if its simply population based or more so the demographic of who plays which faction
---
Uhhhm, you have your hearthstone in Kargath?
---
Unpopular Opinion: I hate deviate delights' both effects. I even hate seeing people with the effect. Specially on the Horde, it feels like a kind of Fortnite skin and draws from the immersion
---
They didn’t even knock!
---
Disengage and Feign Death have saved me more times than I can count tho. Get's whatever is killing me off my ass and let's my pet take over again. Then I can get back into range for actually bow shots.
---
Some bosses in MC resist fire, and the others are completely immune
---
Retail normalized? Retails market has been around for 15+ years... classic launched 3 months ago... how do u compare..
---
I've just recently started using the traps. Not well, but I'm trying to place them more often.
---
I'm on a horde dominated server and we wind up ganking more than they do.
---
Ordinarily I'd agree but the items i trade them are worth  considerably less than they are asking for, like throwing pennies at a highway panhandler.

I just refer to his camp as the danger zone

I can't see any options for it to show only hp as a single digit, nor the look of it doesn't look alike the one he has in the video "/ I've tried fiddling around with the options to try to and only use single digit value, but there's no option for it!  
---
If you see also in the video with the priest Lurtax, his health bars aren't as thick as when I'm using Easyframes, any clue?
---
Why would you have so many rules a spreadsheet is needed?  Golden rule and word of mouth really should be enough in this game.  It's not the military academy or a state barr.
---
Boar for charge or spider for web
---
it's brutal on Herod alliance as well. This problem will only get worse in p2 because it will force the alliance into instanced content only.
---
There’s always people doing lava runs. No need for a 1000 runs just for the last boss.
---
You'll likely be resto, as ele DPS is pretty bad in classic. I wouldn't start grinding for prebis until you're in your early-mid 50's. as a healer you can probably start doing BRD runs at 52-53 with a half decent group. Without looking it up i'm going to assume most of your pre-raid BIS comes from the 58-60 dungeon sweet being scholo/strat/DM so any grinding you do before them isn't going to do a ton for you bis wise. assuming you're elemental now I would 100% stay ele until at least 57-58 when you can start grinding the end game dungeons, then you can swap to resto if you want. There's no reason you can't heal dungeons as elemental anyway.
---
Uhm in Warcraft Logs the only top Backstab parses are people with Perdition’s Blade. Most other high parses are combat swords. And that’s exactly my point. Combat Swords is best because there’s more good swords around in the game than daggers. Once you get Perd’s and Core Hound, you should go daggers.
---
They are good for pvp, their issue is probably that they lack escape. Ele sham is more about burst while spriest is tankier and can outlast.
---
Ele sham is more annoying to gear. Their pvp set is more enh focused, and to get good burst you need good caster gear from raids that will probably not go to an ele sham so fast.
---
Spriest really likes their pvp set, and you can get anathema, so gearing them is easier.
---
Yes, HoJ is BiS (optional) for Ferals. It is pretty much BiS for all melee classes.
---
A mythical creature, the existence of which is used to troll melee dps. Kind of like snipe hunting.
---
It's just not true, that retail requires less social contacts. The loot from LFD and LFR is pretty bad. If you want to do actual endgame activities like (mythic+, raiding, rated pvp) you need to find a group. Yes, there are tools nowadays, that are more efficient than trade chat spam, but they don't automate the process. And for the most difficult content (mythic raiding and high rated pvp) a fixed group is a must, if you want to succeed.
---
The different in challenge between retail and classic is mostly, that you can choose your difficulty in retail. If you judge retail by its easy modes with terrible rewards, it looks easy. If you judge it by the actual endgame, it's harder than classic.

The welfare epics are also only epics in color. Usually they might as well be blues considering their quality.

No, but it has been reported in this sub previously and if you want to be completely sure, ask two different GMs.
---
Lib also has a guaranteed Fadeleaf spawn in its courtyard
---
The point im making is that there is a variety of ways in which you will go to BRD. Some times you will intend to go to the last boss. Some times you wont.
---
No, I must have missed it. Lemme look at it quick.... Okay so it's 8 "talents" per soulbind, 5 of which don't give a choice, 1 is locked in based on the first choice. And it looks like we'll have 3 soulbinds.
---
Idk, I'm not really sold on this being great customization. It's just a rehashed artifact weapon that isn't locked to your spec this time.
---
Is this suppose to be impressive? Do u play like 1hr every 2 days?

That is, he is the same as approximately 98-99% of the population of our planet. They just do not care. And this is not bad, but I personally see a fraction of the truth in this rage.

You can get the whirlwind axe at 30 with some creativity and some gold.  That will last you to late 40s early 50s if you get unlucky with raveger.

Get elvui classic with the benek rogue mod. Thank me later.

Hunters soloing DM:T all the time also sell chest items. Or raids doing DM:T for the buffs. Hang around DM you might get lucky WTB
---
I had no idea this was a meme lol I was just reading some posts about new players trying classic and vets commenting on how they envy them. 
---
Now that I'm looking back, 30 minutes or so after I posted this, I realize how stupid this post really is lol, might delete.
---
Sounds like u just need to go mage and play it how u like. Frost bolt spam won’t come in to play for a long time if your main is still 40s like mine. Let the min maxers do their thing and u just do what’s fun for you. Ive got a few alts all playing spec that sound fun, and plenty of rested xp since I can’t play every day.
---
Mainly look for these runs:
---
- early 50s, jail &amp; quests. You can get a nice shoulder and back  piece from interrogator.
---
- 50-55, arena/anger/golem. Ring and sash from ogre boss will carry your last level and some alternative for endgame bis. Watch out because they are dps real bis. Ask if it's ok to roll first. Golem drops dps boots and healing trinket.
---
- 55+, coffee runs and the seven can get you a healing hammer
---
- 55+, shadow key forging (you need to be dead to get the quest)
---
- 55+, lava runs and emp runs (mc attunement), get that staff and hand piece from the princess... You need it!
---
- full run... Well, hope you have lots of time
---
Then you should look into finishing up said questzones (don't go to Ungoro yet if you can help it) and enter ST at 51 (52+ if you go with randoms).
---
You mean Diremaul? Cmon it takes like 5 minutes or so. Port to Thunderbluff and fly to Feralas.
---
Except you said that person was incorrect, and then brought up retaining current customers, which no one was even talking about.
---
kiting mobs make it easier on the healer.
---
Freshfish is my guy

Yeah I’m from retail and I’m absolutely appalled at the amount of n-words and just casual racism/bigotry I see.
---
It would be something if it was just that one little edgy asshole, but it’s dozens of them....
---
I am so glad I rolled on a PvE server and have that "part of the game" out of my game.
---
Depends on how you categorize. Total population across all servers? Likely much less than blizzard. Population per single realm? thousands more concurrent and tens of thousand more actively playing. 
---
And the original vanilla client was/is a horribly unoptimized mess for modern systems. So theres really no excuse you can make for blizzard here imo.
---
&gt;First thing they did when retail vanilla was successfull was to fire half the team.
---
Lol what
---
Phase 2 will melt reddit beams
---
Do you have an actual source for level averages or just an assumption? I'd love to know.
---
Limited playtime =/= “bad at the game.” 
---
Grinding and no-lifing WoW =/= “skill”
---
This is why I came to Skeram, **target-rich environment**, and a couple of friends play here.
---
Awesome this is a great breakdown. Thanks!
---
Yes , i do have improved stealth :) Thank you for the comment &lt;3

Alliance can say  3 1 p ž 1 ƒ 2 Ä 1 À 2 3 € 1 3   which translates to  Y O U L O S E M O N K E Y B O Y

The real beauty of PoE's skill tree is: While you may have a planned cookie cutter build, depending the gear you get, and the content you are trying to complete, a 10 point respect can drastically change how your character plays, or can really bring the power of the gear that has dropped for you as opposed to the gear you want to drop.
---
I love warlock for one spell, banish, makes my job as tank so much easier, fuking elements hurt....
---
It's not because of your level. You barely get more mana from having higher level, and if you get a next rank of heal it only minimally increases your mana efficiency. Either you were spamming flash heals, or the group was taking too much damage.
---
mmm...coffee run.  yes please.
---
Ppl are wild to think Blizzard would devote resources to making new content when they could just release the old content.
---
Also TBC was fucking banging and id rather play that than new content from the current dev team.
---
It doesn't exist
---
And then you hit 60 and wield thrashblade mainhand and dalrends offhand for the rest of classic because dalrends mainhand doesnt drop and you wont win any raid swords
---
What the fuck? Yes they were talking about it, the guy I responded to was literally talking about it.
---
Person above op I responded to: 
---
&gt;I think they've realized they've lost alot of older blizzard fans and are trying to win them back.
---
OP i responded to says: 
---
&gt;I dont think this is true and honestly if it was it would be a huge mistake.
---
So you read that and at no point thought they were talking about the business of new customers vs old customers? That's not similar enough for you?
---
Most aptly named undead rogue I’ve ever seen

This is what I'm using, just need 2 more shadowcraft pieces
---
This is all based on the assumption that you want to be relevant in phase 2. If you want to be a no name scrub, then disregard the advice. Sounds like you're just projecting your Phase 2 insecurities onto the rest of us.
---
You know as well as anyone else that your suggestion would not be a very accurate depiction of TBC. Personally, I enjoy classic for what it is. I also don't trust Blizzard to properly handle classic+. If by some slight chance they actually do classic+ and make quality content, that'd be cool. I'd rather be on the safe side and not even have the opportunity to ruin what we have.
---
imo, the word balance is like a mind virus for developers.
---
A few braindead players using the wrong debuffs can absolutely destroy your raid DPS. 
---
We went from wiping at 30% to one-shotting in phase 1 basically just by fixing our debuffs.  We had warlocks casting siphon life ffs.
---
The number doesn't mean anything. The number is just in order of whatever additional channels you joined on that particular charackter.
---
It is actually super annoying, because if you play an alt, you need to make sure to join all your channels in the right order to not go insane from selecting the proper number while typing.
---
Good character name 👀
---
I didn't mention them being epics is the issue. 
---
It's that the nearly strongest endgame gear is being handed out basically just for logging in is the issue. All this gear will be irrelevent once the next expansion hits. And the one after that. And once that one hits, the gear from the previous expac will be irrelevant too. This argument doesn't really work.
---
Gear this strong SHOULDN'T be handed out until the next content is out. The only thing being irrelevant here is the players' effort and time, because why would you spend days farming this shit when you will be handed it for free a month later?
---
Absolutely this.  
---
It's 'balanced' until 40+ then becomes entirely alliance. Serious world questing ends for Horde around then, you'll be lucky to see more than a handful in a zone yet be constantly dodging alliance.
---
It’s almost like prices directly correlate with supply and demand. Damn prices, why you so fucked!!??!
---
Cringe
---
Poor you, you have to fly there for less than 10m or take a portal and take 5 minutes. Meanwhile alliance takes 30 minutes because they need to fly to menethil, take the boat and then fly to their FPs which are at either ends of Feralas. 
---
It’s hilarious to see Horde complaining about DM when they have it so much easier than Alliance.
---
Also makes it harder on the healer when they get whacked constantly...
---
I'm in America, and the servers are down here.
---
Had you considered scrolling down to see the other posts regarding this? Just curious.
---
&gt; not a BILLION DOLLAR AAA PRODUCING COMPANY!
---
I'm hoping that one day people will realise how broken the AAA paradigm really is.  It probably won't happen, but it would be nice.
---
You're missing out on the literal back bone of the games design narrative and long term content, and you're paying a premium to do it.
---
Due to unregulated transfers, Heartseeker grew extremely heavily on alliance side as a "destination" it used to be relatively balanced but is probably not close now.   I would say the split feels more like a 70/30.
---
What's the quest? Do you need a full set to start it?
---
Your not wrong. They did say in the panel that it will be the same system if I remember correctly. Just different talents in different rows. Some talents became spells for all 3 specs to help with class fantasy like frost shock and anti magic shield.
---
Ya I use to get excited for blizzard games. This type of thing is why I don't even bother looking at their new stuff. I know they will screw somethibg up. They don't put the time, effort or cash in to do it right.
---
3 1 p 12 11 2 ppp 41 12 11
---
Lmao
---
Looks like I'll just have to jump in and start!
---
Warlocks cant wear maces
---
&gt; then instead let classic lead into vanilla+.
---
I was on this hype train, but I'm off now.
---
1. It doesn't make business sense for Blizzard to make new content. They have 2 full expansions, done, tested, ready to roll out. They're coming.
---
2. Mega servers will be fine, but the medium/low pop servers, TBC+ (and especially Wrath+) will spread their playerbase too thin. Dead Vanilla servers everywhere.
---
3. Do you *really* want developers in 2020 making content for a game from 2004? Modern game design is very different than Classic. There's almost no way you don't get a lot of retail ideas shoved in: deep homogenziation [ie: 'fixing' classes], tokens, RNG, etc.
---
I'm playing a mage, wife is playing a lock, we're on a PvP server.
---
I told her when she got it to keep it up on us at all times, since then we have a better chance of seeing that rogue trying to chew on our (really, my) back.
---

u sir are a hero

How much does that cost? Asking for a friend.
---
Activate your windows bro
---
The trash in zf is 45,bosses 48. If the rest of the group is 45 to 50 yeah you could heal at 40, but you'll pull a lot of extra stuff. Run cath until 42 and then heal zf imo. Do that until 50 and brd into lbrs into 60
---
Phase 3. Update your Atlas loot
---
&gt;Uhm in Warcraft Logs the only top Backstab parses are people with Perdition’s Blade. Most other high parses are combat swords
---
Your point is that the only reason dagger parses are higher, is because of the itemlevel Lead perdition grants compared to missing sword alternatives at same itemlevel.
---
Even with cts from BWL and maladath,  dagger with perdition and cht sims higher. So at equal itemlevel, dagger is still better in the most Situations
---
And there are like a Lot of dagger alternatives for swords. 
---
Can You list the overwhelming amount of good swords compared to dagger?
---
That's more of an issue of Blizzard's design and balance than something you could blame players for. 
---
With balance, if you're interested in PvP, Horde generally have better racials. Will of the Forsaken and Hardiness in particular are busted good, so if you're a min-max type of PvPer you're going Horde. 
---
From a design/flavor perspective, and this is entirely subjective, Horde are just more interesting than Alliance. Humans are boring, Dwarves are kinda cool, Gnomes are lamer dwarves and night elves are there. 
---
Or you get to choose between: Zombie, the best part of Lord of the Rings, the worst part of the Trollz movie, or a being a thicc slab of beef. 
---
There's just no competition.
---
Because it's boring running 1 Vs 50 into brm.
---
The actual game as it was intended? Yes.
---
To be fair it's kind of odd they went with lime green for the blur lines on the axe
---
I've had second wind drop the last 3 times I've gone. I'm a warrior though and I'm starting to think garrosh the dervish is not real and made up to make warrior go insane
---
Has anyone else been getting the same loot drops in MC week after week? It's like every boss will drop shaman or warlock tier gear every single week. We have yet to see a single giantstalker BoE drop after 7 weeks, while we are collecting so many druid, warrior and priest BoEs that we are selling them on the AH
---
Being 39 in a 44 to 50 dungeon probably means he was missing a rank from 40 to 44 that would help immensely
---
I can confirm that this is correct and you can abuse that info, too:
---
If you are stuck wondering, if a quest is for LBRS or UBRS, just look at the quest type. All UBRS quests are (Raid) and all LBRS quests are (Dungeon). No exceptions.
---
Indeed. Its a beast of a dungeon and you'll spend hours there. But the loot. Oh lordddddd the loot :)
---
GLHF

I can't believe how fast "ok boomer" has become oversaturated. It never seems to be used in a fitting context either, just a generic insult or a rebuttal to a complaint.

---
AHK use is 100% bannable. This is not what multiboxers use.
---
I mean you can still wear swords vs 99% of the things you are fighting, just want axes for raids.  no need for 12% hit vs random mobs you farm for gold or places like DME
---
Stack of Oily Blackmouth is over 2g on my server somehow. Night Fin is also pretty decent.
---
Otherwise, I expect Stonescale to creep up a little with flask usage in higher tier raids.
---
That's your upper slash dagger
---
Are there multiple levels of rewards for world bosses? How does determine its reward for a priest healer?
---
Take the cannolis leave the gun.
---
A trick I use is the following trick to avoid gaining aggro, Mind control your victim, align him between you are the mob, exit mind control and fear right away.
---
It will fear your victim into the mobs and he will get the aggro since he is not your pet. After you kill him the mobs will probably go after you, but it is so worth it.
---
,
---
Go priest for the offensive dispells, fear bombs, and MC.  Ele sham is badass too, just in a different way. Both drink a metric fuck ton of water
---
Pathetic cunt.
---
Gotcha. That’s just a guess though, right? There’s no official way of finding out?
---
Imagine being so shit at the game you just hang out in packs outside of actual content to skillessly gank people actually trying to do said content.
---
Wonderful stuff.
---
Difference in mana efficiency between rank 5 and rank 6 heal is miniscule. Sure you heal more per cast, but you also spend more mana doing so.
---
My druid is level 59 and I'm quite pleased with it because I feel like I can outlast to win or disengage and run whenever I want which is great. It also feels good because I know I haven't mastered it yet so it feels like a high ceiling type class. I haven't considered hunter but I've never played one so that might be interesting too. Thanks for the insight.
---
Wago.io
---
No multiboxer uses AHK.
---
Easier PVP ranking. I’ve come to the realization that my schedule doesn’t allow for any real raiding, so... yeah.
---
Hunger for Blood, they kept nerfing it but no matter they did it was still necessary to maintain 100% uptime for optimal dps.
---
Do you have anything to back up that claim, or is it just a vague feeling you have?
---
You need to define what benchmarks you're using for 'inferior' as well. What is it inferior at doing? If you want to say it's 20% inferior on 5man healing, I'd agree. But it's not 20% inferior for raiding.
---
Assuming you're raid healing with chain heal as I have stated:
---
an extra 20mp/5s = 13.5% more mp/5s in my current mix of t1 &amp; preBIS, and 9% greater mp/5s in t2 gear +p4 consumables
---
an extra 10% healing on base spells = 5% more healing in my current gear, 4% in t2ish gear (if 3/8 tier 2 doesn't work with it, this will be even lower (i.e. the bonus to healing beyond the first target is not affected by purification, they are two aura effects, and I can't find out anything about how they interact).
---
Right now, if I had to put a number on it, the loss of mana regen + purification healing = 7% inferior (9% if you just add the numbers together, but we weight HPS higher than HPM in current content).
---
In t2ish gear it will be closer to 5% inferior. And this is 'maxing out'. If you're deep resto and not popping pots on CD, then you should know that you can switch to ele resto and make that change if you want to. Vanilla is all about choices and trade offs. Some are massive discrepancies - e.g. bring a ret pally to a raid rather than another DPS warrior - that's 50% inferior. 7% isn't on the same level.
---
If you're having difficulties on progression and you are 100% sure it's your healing needing to change (rather than sub-par DPS or poor execution or many other factors), go deep resto. But it's not some magic bullet, it's just a bit of a boost.  
---
Those are the numbers. If you are clearing MC, you don't need to go / stay deep resto. Those are the facts. With phase 2 starting, this myth that shaman need to be deep resto to heal in raids really needs to die. We can reassess at BWL.
---
Remember, the key questions when healing are: is my healing sufficient that we are killing the boss before he kills us? Am I keeping raid members alive (unless they are doing stupid things like standing in deep breath)? If you're clearing the content, you know that you are achieving these things and you can afford to make some trade offs in order to open up other possibilities for yourself. What you're sacrificing is, hopefully I've shown, not very much, what you gain is huge in terms of enjoying play for most people, I imagine.
---
If you have no interest in doing any soloing / PvP outside a group context, stay deep resto, sure. But all of this is important that we qualify words like 'inferior'. 'Inferior' at what? What does this 'inferior' choice allow me to do in a superior way?
---
Please help me understand. 
---
So, if I were to say, "You come across to me as a (insert random insult here), its actually quite sad". That wouldn't actually be an insult?
---
1 mistake every 30 min is the Druid Code.
---
Ouch...
---
Sounds like you've got some anxiety about death. Wanna talk about it, sweetie?
---
I did the winterspring dragon second, forgot to Loot. Did the third, went to turn in and realized.
---
That's classic :) it made a memory because I wasted half an hour traveling.
---
You want to be careful praising rogues for stunning mobs the tank is fighting, this often angers rage using tanks because they cannot get rage if they’re not being hit
---
Share that mouse over sunset plz
---
Well technically he was right :D
---
Wow, people need to pay attention. I swear people don't even think about what they're looking at anymore. I question what else you see in life.
---
Yes needing Dalrends for a slight dps increase on your farm spec is trolling
---
Basically taking the bacon and lettuce out of your BLT.
---
Hell in retail you could spend 15 levels just to get a talent that gave you a sprint button. Then you have to wait another 15 to get something that was semi interesting.
---
That's an awesome way to do it, I wish my friend were into WOW.
---
You can work and wow..
---
he wants to be horde and not have much competition to rank up, 
---
this is a realy good plan
---
Twink items are niche it's not a real good consistent farm. They don't drop reliably you could farm sfk for a week and not get a shadowfang. And even if you do it sells for like 50-100g if someone even wants to buy it..
---
Took me 1, but then you replace it with DM trinket.
---
For Alliance getting to DM take even more time.  
---
From IF ~3 minutes to Menethil, wait for ship 5-10 minutes, fly from Theramore to east Feralas FM ~4 minutes, run around Horde city right in the middle of Feralas ~5 mintues.  
---
And direct flight from Darnassus to Feralas take ~15 minutes, so even if you instantly find mage with portal, you pay gold and arrive at the same time :)
---
I love my pi hole so much...

Eh, I hit 60 in three weeks (6,5 days played) on a warrior and I still hit 60 with 650g.. It's just about using the auction house, also easier to sell stuff for gold while leveling now than it was two months ago I imagine.
---
I wouldn't do Strat/Scholo until you're at least 57 because of the aggro radius. It's doable, but will take longer and be riskier.
---
 he wants to be horde and not have much competition to rank up,
---
So....  You ask for a fury tank prebis list three times, then you end your post with “looking for best pvp gear”?  Go home, you’re drunk.
---
I just made an Alliance character on Grob... Long live the capitalists!!
---
Ok, we are talking about different things. I am talking about old returning customers, current customers, and new customers who have never played. You are apparently just talking about people who aren't playing vs customers who are. 
---
I'm saying that they are talking specficaly about returning players vs players who haven't played before (new players)
---
Holy shit, I would have a stroke with that keyboard.
---
They will feel as if it is" revenge" and the "others" started it. 
---
Even though everyone feels lie a victim and justified in their action.
---
Seems he want to be on the 10% horde side. So rather than afraid he's looking for a fight.

I've literally never gotten a single worthwhile drop from felwood fire elementals after killing them for quite a while.  They're also never camped during peak hours, so something tells me I'm not the only one who feels they're not worth farming. Water eles are good but camped 24/7.

He was getting in to Twitch (originally was just YouTube uploads) and was rating characters gear/appearance I can't remember. Somebody kept trying to link him indecent images so he was relatively smart and would open the images on a second screen and if they were OK he'd move it to the stream.

Some 100000 IQ player linked a gif that went from WoW char to some porn or something. He closed it but people reported him and he got a 3 day suspension.

afaik 400 if you're desperate and 500-600 is normal. But it might also depend on the server

Then you go for ElanTedronai
---
Mfw the only tank loot that seems to drop for me in dungeons is +dodge gear. Feelsbadman.
---
Yeah, and you can't even use mage portal. Because flying from Darnassus to Feralas is the same ~15 minutes, and then you need to run half of location to DM for ~10 minutes.
---
I think this is, again, because Retail is better overall for raiding, and classic is better overall for other things.
---
Shoutout to Honorbound on Moonglade EU, who's maintank was literally a nolifing warrior called Caesar. Those guys carried my ass through UBRS at level 58. Love ya'll.
---
You mean the main part? As in the literal back bone of the story and driving force of content? Carebear.
---
Just adding to this: I think the biggest mistake with arenas was to declare them as the actual pvp endgame by giving them better rewards than BGs. Arenas should have been a fun side mode to show off with rewards that are equally good at best. By making the best pvp equipment exclusive to arenas, they declared BGs to be the beginner/casual/non-serious mode.
---
Hahahahaha playing alliance must suck.
---
My server is almost perfectly balanced and i can tell you, it's the exact same situation here.  You think you have a 1v1, and before you know it he's running back with his 4x lvl 60 friends to corpse camp you for an hour.
---
holy fuck. i thout it was something we had in our pockets.
---
You should really use your battle shout to generate threat. It is a good threat Generator for bigger Groups. 
---
If you have IMP BS on you then you can't use your own BS. Therefor those 2 Warriors may actually just have been considered and asking themselfs why YOU don't use it for tanking :D
---
Idc how you spend your day, life or even gaming, but your post is just obnoxiousi insinuate that u think ’ur better than ever1 else.
---
Maybe get heal bot. Oretty common to use. That said have lower ranked flash heal, and I use highest rank of heal and rank 3 I believe heal to just spawn. Greater heal when it gets heavy. All about order of operations. Main goal is the tank. Get a general idea for your heal amounts, turn on character hp values. Play the math game.
---
I literally just (within the last 2 months) upgraded my laptop that had Windows 8 on it to 10 and it never asked me for a new key or to pay.
---
I'd say the lvl 1 warrior was just created for the joke name
---
Did 510 with pre-bis and 1 item from mc. Your numbers are WAY off.
---
In a few months.
---
I'd prefer swords from a utility standpoint.  I can go farm and be perfectly fine.  If I do a dungeon and either pull or just attack something without a tank I can SS perfectly fine.  Swords are "easier" to deal with most of the time.
---
I went dagger though because I am alliance and the clusterfuck for 1h swords is going to be insane.  Aside from other sword rogues, there are warriors who are going to want them since being alliance many of them are human.  There was also the issue that I got an epic dagger before a sword, partially because more people wanted the swords than daggers.
---
I'd "prefer" to be swords, but I'd rather have better weapons which is easier as daggers.  As a raiding spec it really isn't too different.  Mobs will be facing away from you almost 100% of the time so backstab vs SS positioning is irrelevant.  Swords will use Evis from time to time while daggers largely won't.
---
PvP wise it's interesting.  People like the big ambush/backstab crits to kill people, but a lot of the time good pvp fights come down to control rather than pure burst.  If you CAN kill a guy in 2 seconds that is amazing, but if you don't now you are sitting there with no energy and about 4 seconds because you can do anything useful.  Daggers in pvp also get reemed pretty hard by anyone who isn't cloth since armor will obliterate your burst and you don't have much else.  PvP wise, rogue's control abilities end up being much better than the raw burst.
---
Oily on faerlina go for 10g a stack

I upgraded for free only a month or two ago. I expected them to ask for a Windows 10 key or to make payment, but it never did.
---
&gt; Close to BlackRock, and it's a horde outpost. Thorium point is easy to get ganked at. 
---
Like what /u/dperls wrote, there is also an Inn, meaning it's the closest Horde Inn to BRM. There are usually Mages somewhere nearby, meaning there is easy access to portals, so having your HS set to Kargath is sort-of like having it bound to all capitol cities + Kargath in one.
---
Southshore Tarren Mill. How do you leave this out?
---
Yep... I actually think Classic would be missing a lot if all we had was viable Content and nothing like this. Where you just discover and wonder why it is there etc.
---
You'll choose a companion tied to your covenant. Seems to be like 3 choices per/cov. Then you assimilate his talent trees and can switch as will between the 3 companions.
---
Can use them as bodyguard or just get their talents without summoning them.
---
Looks good for an extra customization tbh.
---
The only official channels are General, Trade, Local Defense, World Defense, and Looking for group
---
The numbers are arbitrarily assigned based on the order you join them (trade maintains its number as you enter/leave cities).
---
I'm not sure they're necessarily doing this to bring back old players.  I think it's more to the effect that they realize they've strayed in their quality.  They had certain design principles that brought them success, and they've let those lapse - they got caught up in other things.  It seems they may be trying to go back to those roots that Blizzard was built on, and re-capturing old fans is sort of ancillary (although obviously intended) to that endeavor.
---
It's sort of like building a sports team.  You spend years building up a farm system, drafting smart, etc.  Then you sign a couple key free agents to round out the team and your success explodes.  The last thing you did was "sign a couple key free agents," so your owner mistakenly thinks *that* was the key to success...as opposed to the massive foundation building that came before it.  He encourages you to keep signing more and more expensive free agents, and then can't understand when your team starts falling apart.
---
Finally, you convince him that he needs to go back to the draft and develop strategy that originally built the team.  "Re-capturing old fans" that stopped following the team because of its recent failures is obviously a goal of that.  But the real impetus is to re-capture that original management mindset that built the team, and then winning back those fans will be a natural follow.
---
Had the same issue a while back, classic.wowhead is showing them as p1
---
he wants to play horde and rank up faster
---
Your first post stated that 15k honor translate into 15k standing to reach rank 5 which isn't true.
---
You need 15k standing to reach rank 5 and only the first guy can earn 13k standing in the first week. 
---
Aren't those threshold for pre 1.8 honor system?
---
Damn you are so far up your own ass. 
---
Just let people do what they enjoy man.
---
Don't be sad. I was playing in vanilla too and still I %100 found out the layout of BRD a month ago.
---
I use this guide for bis items. http://www.wowclassicbis.com/

If you are able to get into DM, don't really get obsessed about BRD drops unless you need a really bis item like last boss's epic hammer.

Just need to spread those hours out. I work full time and I've got a 60 with raids two times a week.
---
Right now I'm farmin for epic mount. It's probably at least two weeks till i get there due to the amount of hours i can put in a day. 
---
But now I've got a goal to reach for for at least two weeks.

Please inform on what RNG is?

Act 2 in inferno was a wall in terms of gear requirements. You could play act 1 and feel like you were moving at a good pace and that you could move on with some challenge but continue to make ground. Act 2 reminded you how wrong that was and you needed some serious changes to your gear to consider moving past that.
---
We had the winterspring dragon bug for our healer. She couldnt loot the skull so we had to wait for it to respawn 3 times. It turns out your have to do enough damage to register the tag...
---
Lmao God dammit
---
Most tanks don’t have good AOE threat so chain lightning is the issue. Stick to single target on the tanks primary target and you should be okay
---
i'm not hardcore, and I would still go to pserver even if I never have before.
---
Official servers really suck, too many people cramed into each, not enough ressources to maintain the many raiding guilds each side has because they increased max pop dramatically compared to what it was before, stupid bell batching, login issues almost every day, and can't handle more than about 50 ppl in the same place.
---
It's like they WANT classic to fail. Many bizz top management still dont want to make classic wow, like they didn't at first, with their statements "you think youdo but you don't", but were forced by acti-blizz board because it made economic sense (as it now largely proven with blizz doubling the number of subscriptions thanks to classic), but since it kind of shows that blizz top management failed to bring retail to a proper place where people would enjoy it, they still want it to fail and sabotage everything they can to prove their deluded point that it was only nostalgia and current retail wow IS better than vanilla
---
To learn goblin
---
There's a book called "Soothsaying for dummies" in a small gnome house to the north of steamwheedle port (is that the name of the settlement to the east of gadgetzhan?). There's a gnome in a turban there.
---
If you have a specialisation in a profession and want to retrain in another one I believe you have to unlearn your profession entirely (by using the unlearn button in the professions pane), retrain to the level where you can take specialities and then interact with this book in order to clear it and allow you to get another specialisation.
---
Check out wowhead classic website I'm sure there will either be a guide or some helpful comments there. Their guides do go over the different specialities, what recipes they get that are unique to them and details like you are asking for.
---
Wowhead's classic version is excellent once you get used to how the site works. I highly recommend it.
---
You underestimate the lengths people will go to make sure no one is safe... everyone that can be killed will be killed.
---
Looking at the representation of alliance and horde I’m Warcraft logs the server is altoesst 75% alliance
---
&gt; Getting to Badlands as Horde is horrible.
---
Yeah and getting to Thanaris for Alliance is a walk in the park past Dustwallow Marsh, Barrens and Thousand Needles.
---
Damn that's smart
---
You cant converse me Windwall Totem is useful.
---
They also stated, that it was still not working as intented
---
Good to know! Not sure why I'm remembering it that way.
---
this. Everybody at work is looking at me weird I laughed so hard.
---
&gt; but everyone wants a more dark souls style game nowadays, me
---
see its not everyone, i do not want that. i played demon souls and didn't play any of the souls games after that, i simply do not enjoy that style of combat or find it at all rewarding
---
same for POE, everyone seemingly wants diablo to be POE. and i'm just like if you like POE so much just play freeking POE
---
I would say 500 at minimum honestly. Because the drop chance for that parrot is extremely low, like 0.01 in some cases.
---
Get a threat meter. 
---
Chain lightning has a huge threat Count. You should really only use lightning bolt also for mana Efficiency. 
---
If you don't want agroo --&gt; don't use chain lightning and get a threat meter. If you don't use chain lightning you won'T go from 0-100% straight away and can actually stop DPS before you pull agroo
---
IIRC you can disable auto accept and auto turn-in. At least in the BFA version of this mode you can
---
Yeah I think I'm gonna try felwood eles and fish in the downtime
---
Its probably an alliance spy lol
---
Not your personal army.
---
Rare spawn in duskwood drops a felhunter summon.
---
I got a new motherboard and haven’t been able to activate windows since. So annoying.
---
Agree with everything but I don't think they let people choose their destination with the free server transfers. Each server had a specific destination realm for people transferring.
---
Dps the tanks target. If you attacking ads of course ur gonna pull. Protect warriors dont have the best air threat.
---
I make about 100g a day making lvl 55 water and selling it “for tips” on the bridge between the AH and bank in IF. More people tip well than you’d probably imagine.
---
i am letting them for sure man, i just commented ot like they did
---
Yeah it's the best for outdoor farming, though come next week that's probably not going be a great idea anymore.
---
It's also good for dungeons like maraudon or deadmines: east, especially with ghost mushrooms going up in price.
---
Have you checked out DHud?    
---
    
---
Here's how mine **[looks](https://i.imgur.com/nC21JPM.jpg)**
---
Yeah but horde has the n word
---
nah Skeram takes the cake. Good luck playing here if you're alliance on phase 2
---
Not understanding the need/greed system would be kinda embarrassing but I was such a noob when I first started playing that all the way to 50 I was picking gear based on armor values, not stats! When my friends figured out why I was having such a hard time now THAT was embarrassing.
---
How much are mooncloth bags on your server? Still around 3g for me. Runecloth bags around 2.5-3
---
Flameguard gauntlets are way better
---
You server doesn't have a dozen mages in kargath offering ports?
---
Get the devilsaur set. It should be the 1st set of gear you go for once you hit 60.
---
this is what i'm trying to get at. ive played on both sides over the last 15 years but i have experienced it similar to you.
---
Ali will kill you but then move on to whatever they were doing vs camping for hours on end

It will never be the same as retail because people are older. People have came up with more efficient strategies. We know what's coming unlike retail.

But this doesn't mean economy is fucked just that things are different

Only a manual searching add-on that almost nobody is using due to the extra steps.

They also announced that they're removing the infinite grind that they had in Legion and BFA. I'm waiting to see more details, but that intrigues me.

What thorium veins are near the first boss? I thought it was the last boss online?
---
pvp players sure get triggered that other people don't like pvp. I don't understand why.
---
I think he meant the actual talents rather than the Soulbinding system. Nothing's been stated on these talent choices. If I had to make a guess, they'd grant the first one at 10 with the rest interspersed until you get your capstone ability choices at 50 with the level 60 option being your Soulbind trees.
---
That much off thorium?! Thorium is sub 1g per bar on my server.
---
Yo you sound like you might need to drink some water.
---
Pretty sure the pickpocketing route around arena, out the left window of bridge, down to bael'gar pickpocketing right side and left on return, rinse and repeat gives 40-50g an hour with no downtime. 
---
It's a more active task and doesn't require getting keys from other players.
---
Sure.  
---
There is a difference between making a definitive statement about someone or something, and stating how you perceived something.  
---
So, your statement that I am a narcissist was made as a definitive judgement. A statement of "fact." You made that definitive judgement based off knowing nothing about me, and an incorrect interpretation of single statement I made. That, is no good.  
---
If you had said that what I had said came across as somewhat narcissistic then that is simply a statement of how my action was perceived by you. That could be a reflection on my communication, of your perception, or of any other number of variables. It is decidedly less combative and presumptive than stating it as a "fact."  
---
In my post, I merely stated how people who troll other players with "go to retail" are perceived by me. It was not a definitive statement of judgement. There are obviously many reasons why people do it. What varies is how people perceive it and the context of the conversation. They are usually trying to taunt or enrage the victim (i.e. trolling for fun), so in that context my statement was a little bit of a dig showing that it doesn't always work that way, because you cannot choose how other people perceive your actions. To one person it will enrage them, to another it will trigger another far less flattering response. It is the same thing as a guy who walks around in camo clothing who may think he looks cool and tough, but to most other people he looks like a douche. Note that the same rule applies to Alliance who troll as well, as one other poster point out. 
---
If I had stated that they ARE those things, then I would indeed have been being a tool.
---
To bad you don't really need them as you only need about 4% hit on gear with the combat talents. Less if you have 310 weapon skill.
---
If u did nothing wrong you whouldn't be banned. As simple as that.
---
So they're totally out of ideas &gt;.&lt;
---
I was wondering what they'd do when we killed off all the major lore characters... bring them back!
---
So is this the place Sylvanas went when she jumped from ICC? Maybe I'm wrong but the trailer doesn't make it seem near so bad as she thought it was.
---
Had 2 hunter t2 pants drop off rag last night. Saving them to disenchant. Meanwhile weve seen no magleblades no dps caster rings 1 caster trinket, and 2 staves, one of which went to a PUG on our first week of raiding. Weve cleared MC 9 times now I think.
---
You don't make things better by ignoring that a problem exists.
---
I feel bad for my rogue friend. He can’t get groups unless me or my friend log in to start his groups. On my faction/server rogue is in such insanely high supply with only a moderate demand. And if he fights enough for his raid spot (Which he has) there’s still 5 other rogues that all need the same piece and 4-6 fury warriors that probably need it too....
---
Here my buddy and I are in a bunch of epics and invited to literally everything
---
Every once in a while you just delete someone as a Shaman and that is so satisfying.  You don't really get that with a Druid unless it's a caster and they are sitting down drinking.  Even then, I've rarely one shot someone unless they are very undergeared.  
---
Both are fun.  The druid is much tankier in pvp and has a larger learning curve, but once you get it down you can become near unkillable.  As a shaman, once you are in a fight in you pretty much either win or lose.   If you're a druid and things don't go your way you can get away and reset.
---
I prefer shaman because chain heal and chain lightning are the most satisfying spells in the game in my opinion.
---
LIP = lesser invisibility potion?
---
Taking BiS from someone so you can add slight DPS to your farming spec...  you don't see how that could be seen as trolling?
---
yeah, that's normal, the world is not all rainbow farts
---
I didn’t judge it by its cover... it set an expectation for the film for me as it should 
---
Judging something by its cover means never seeing it and basing all your assumptions on the first impression
---
I believe those are ancient night elf ruins from when the blood elves were expelled from Darnassus and moved across the world to start their own city but before they developed their own architecture.
---
Put on some spell damage gear and do maraudon princess farm including ghost mushrooms. (even better if you are already moonglow)
---
No we don't. Level up a new character in another realm.
---
well its not really dumpstered you can get the belt just not right now. Think of your purchase like a pre-order.
---
Very true
---
Ok, so Hammer of Grace does have 6 more healing. But the Aurastone Hammer has 5 mp5 and 10 int (and 10 sta, but meh). So if mana is an issue, Aurastone is better. If mana isn't an issue, its kind of a wash tbh.
---
Still, sad that a relatively common blue out of BRD rivals an MC boss drop...
---
This fucking AIDS is going to infest the only game I enjoy playing...Yay
---
Horde bias.
---
&gt; The fact that you can brick a character means it is not fake.
---
Completely wrong. The fact that you can brick a character is a result of the respec costs being way, way, **way** too high. If they offered basically free full respecs then the PoE talent tree would be just as complicated but you would not have bricked characters.
---
Yeah they sell for a pretty good price on Faerlina, wish I fished more while I was leveling. I’ve been doing it a ton now since I keep forgetting to reset my hearth from winter spring to IF. 
---
So I fish while waiting for the boat to come and sometimes stay a while in darkshore or wetlands to level up my fishing and catch those oily bastards for money. I was shocked how much they were going for when I went to sell my first batch. Now I run around winter spring for thorium and fish for deviate delights.
---
Even ahead of the curve it was losing money.
---
Hmm, interesting. I haven't observed the same problems when I've used curse of tongues.
---
Why would you play battlegrounds if you were sub 19 and weren’t twinked? To farm honor to level?
---
That seems like it's a YOU problem. 
---
60 and 46 isn't a lot of hours compared to some people who have 3 60s in teir gear already.
---
I went from 1-40 in a week of just playing very casually.
---
Classic doesn't take long to level at all, you just have to know the quests, routes and be efficient.
---
It's in no way some long harsh grind like some people make it out to be.
---
Boomie here. I don’t even want me in grp :(
---
They're never doing classic+. It's nice to dream about, but it's not happening.
---
Oh, so ten level 60 Hordes right at the Alliance FM in Everlook have really important stuff to do for an hour that I was there.  
---
Yeah, gotcha.  
---
There's party of level 60 outside every exit from Gadgetzan, Everlook and booty Bay. They all have really important things to do, yes)
---
It shows 31 points in the image at the top?
---
Is that what activision-blizzard calls optimization?
---
No it didn't; it was part of making WoW simpler. Arena was only played by maybe a single digit percentage of the population, why would they ruin their game just for that
---
Even if you get lucky with ravager, you keep both. WW Ace is your solo/questing weapon, ravager is your dungeon weapon.
---
And it's price goes lower everyday because of "50 leathers per day" farmers :D
---
Well at least you remembered to pick up the ony attunement quest before running the dungeon...
---
A reason to finally let lose and farm alliance is great content.
---
It is as simple as "read ability and use" until you get into endgame. Retail talents don't allow you to build a broken character. So you can level and do dungeons by guessing, which ones are good.
---
If you go for max pve dps, nearly every talent system is just an illusion of choice. It's a lot more nuanced in pvp. For example you might prefer a deterministic but smaller damage boost over a random one, because you can align it with you partners burst damage. Or whats best, a short AOE stun, medium single target stun or a long slow?
---
whats your castbar addon? I use ClassicCastbar
---
Not really on retail to be honest...
---
Man.  The plasma rifle really did leave a bad taste in everyone's mouths .  Hitscan, very forgiving hitscan at that, super powerful rounds and ludicrously expensive.  Everyone saw what that was.
---
I have sheep mouseover macro'd with a moon icon component, and my counterspell is wheel-up. 
---
Being assigned 'star' out of nowhere once to sheep with made me &gt;:c once, but other than that I find this SUPER useful, as it 'marks' the mob I'm sheeping before my cast is off, giving people a second to get away from it.
---
I'm quick with interrupts but that long cooldown makes me cry.
---
Don't worry, I'm doing enough killing for the both of us
---
Why is that a laughing matter? 
---
I rerolled because I wasn't enjoying the server/faction I was on and am enjoying my 2nd toon much better.
---
If you were to reroll tonight you'd be in your late 50s by the time Phase 2 launched. The people laughing at this just aren't efficient in their leveling is all.
---
Hemosexual. Genius
---
For some reasons i thought is karma fishing post
---
I have a connection to leveling warriors regardless of what class I'm playing cause I've been there lol. 60 warriors though? I'm just gonna run away haha
---
LookingForGroup is official and 80% of all people on my server us it.  
---
But there's some activity in "world" channel. Don't know about LFG, never joined it.
---
No, I think he's implying that OP is a potentially homicidal racist who luckily happens to spend his time making content like this, cause if he went outside (the implication is that he's a basement dwelling neckbeard) OPs evident racism would cause him to kill black people.
---
Not saying it makes sense, but that's what he was trying to say.
---
People don't like people telling them they don't like what they like.
---
Wow that was a shitty sentence
---
its a nice pvp staff. Its quite a bit below mageblade pve-wise.
---
I just explained why.
---
As heals that usually group with a mage, I only discriminate against casters (&gt;.&lt;), not melee. I would welcome any rogue in my group.
---
On a side note, our guild is in fact recruiting rogues for our raid because we only have 2, 1 is level 59. Competition is so low that even the level 59 has already won a couple T1 pieces.
---
This isn't the player's faults obviously, but the players absolutely exacerbated this problem.
---
I played on Herod initially.  The population disparity became apparent as soon as I hit contested zones - it was a fucking nightmare.  Everywhere I went, it was always a 2:1 or 3:1 advantage.  And the Horde pressed that advantage as much as they could, ganking at every opportunity.  That's their right, of course - it's a PvP server.  But it made it so that you effectively could not quest as an Alliance in the open world.

So I transferred to Earthfury.  And so did a lot of other Alliance.  The disparity was bad enough, but the Horde non-stop pressing that advantage by ganking every Alliance in sight because there was no risk of retaliation exacerbated the problem to epic proportions.  Now there's no alliance anymore.  They fucked themselves because it was so much fun antagonizing players that had no real chance of defending themselves.  So while Blizzard should have put measures in place to prevent, I'm definitely playing the world's smallest violin over here for the Horde players pissing and moaning about the population imbalance.
---
They were most likely not tank main specs then. Many warrior DPS players tank in dungeons to get a group quicker. If they didn't, people would basically never find a dungeon tank.
---
They actually did that in cata. The talent tree got a lot smaller and you were only allowed to invest a maximum number of points outside of your primary spec.
---
New to wow, started as a lock, got it to 46 and did not enjoy it. 
---
So I made a druid got it to 50 and I love it. Decided it would be my tank/heals MotW alt. Then I rolled rogue. I got it to 47 yesterday. My guild helped me get thrash blade and Mark of the chosen, and I completed the elite hinterlands quests last night for the rune if the guard captain and that sweet necklace. I have both my weapons fiery and I'm feeling like a beast. I love rogue. 
---
I just picked up fishing since I had just gotten my nat pagle rod, so now it's time to sling some hooks :D
---
I've got all the gear for 19 priest, 19 rogue (2 shadowfangs for enchant swaps), 29 rogue, 39 rogue as well as odds and sods for all sorts of other chars.
---
Been buying the gear whenever I see a decent deal and farming it myself, slowly preparing the characters when I get bored and storing the rest. 
---
Frankly I don't really care how the market goes as I've bought them for my own characters along the way but I agree with the general concensus that the market will be flooded once p3 hits.
---
It’s fucking absurd that people use this line. Oh it’s easy, why bother having the right spec.... an attitude like that in a raid group is the difference between two three hour raid nights to clear all content and one two hour night. No one wants to waste hours of time.
---
Close to alliance and horde city, easy graveyard. Wide open battlefield. Tradition. It’s not for “farming honor” by gsnking levellers but rather big x v x fights
---
From what I understand of the backstory so far, the horde and alliance are not formally at war. At least, that's what thrall keeps telling me lol
---
This is why I’ll go pvp from now
---
Yeah, I liked PvP in BC, but I fucking hated arenas, and I hated how I was forced to play them anyways because someone decided that arenas would be the be-all end-all of PvP rewards.
---
The fact that they had gear that you could only get through arenas was a huge mistake. They should have let you grind those out in BGs if you wanted to.
---
The difference is in classic you get to create your character's story. Your headcanon IS CANON.
---
In retail you don't have that luxury. You are what blizzard tells you that you are. "Champion! Hael her woons!!"
---
So your mad that blizzard gave players a choice and the players made a choice you didn't like.  How is this blizzard fault?
---
Not really a class so much but a server question.  I just can't find a home.  None of my friends stuck around so I really don't have anyone to play with.  I've got a 50 warrior on Heartseeker, and a 31 Shaman on Herod.  Both servers are just so lopsided though.  Also, I would rather be on the underdog side of a server for world pvp, but not when it is 80/20.  
---
I've heard Sulfuras is a good place for Horde since its a little more balanced but Horde is slightly outnumbered.  It also seems like Alliance is either severely outnumbered or completely dominate on almost every server.  Anyone have any good recommendations?  I need to just pick a home server and stay with it,  otherwise I'll never hit 60.
---
LookingForGoup is available though default UI and also it don't have a moderator so it can't be locked or something.  
---
It's first time I hear about LFG custom channel.
---
Thinking about making an alt after I hit 60 to help our guild with what they need in raids. I'm thinking of either a warrior or a resto shaman. Is leveling for warriors as bad as everyone says it is? I tried it once and it was very dull. I play an enhancement shaman in retail, and while I like it, the rotation is a bit dull. How is the class in classic?
---
Following.
---
depends on the server. There are some servers that are seemingly just ignoring that shit and just repost the entire supply after a full buy out in a 10 minutes time and its all back to original price from SUPER hard undercutting all the way back down as if by mindless bots lol. Servers just have too many people with too large of stores atm in some cases atm.
---
&gt;  Awesome. So I logged and now I'm sad. 
---
Don't let others in game effect your feelings like that. Shrug it off, people will always be toxic. As for the 25s tip, did your GM not put a crafting fee, this is a normal practice for those expensive for those enchants that are hard to get. Hell I paid 20g for my spell power enchant and the guy wanted 30g I had to bargain with the guy. If they just ask for a tip I'm only going to put up a gold or 2. If they have a fee, I pay the fee + a few extra. 
---
Guild fights happen, even at the start of the game. People get made gquits happen as with trash talking. It's a huge mmo what do you expect?
---
I saw this guy yesterday and gave him 55s for a deviate delight
---
Rogue is my first pick as dps when forming a group, at least 1, just as high priority as mage. You are not useless, don't give up *hugs*
---
essence of water sells good.
---
Element of fire sells for a decent atm but i suspect they will go up come p2.
---
I would kill myself losing to a clicker
---
Yeah for sure. Loved having rogues in my 5-mans when I was healing. They kick those casters so they run to the tank instead of hitting me, kidney shot runners, and they usually peel off the tank's target and attack whatever was going after me.
---
Eh. I prefer the retail talent system. It scales much better, and there are *substantial* differences between the choices at each level.
---
I don't go around getting mad that people don't like the things I like though. This mentality seems most prevalent among casual players and pvp'ers.
---
2 types of calculations u need to make as a programmer when making online vidya games. U have to decide how much of your game is ran on the server and how much is ran on the clients computer..aka your pc.
---
The more stuff you choose to run on client side computer. the better your game runs. but it's easier to "cheat/hax".  The more stuff you choose to run on server side computer. The more secure your game is. At the cost of performance.  
---
Think of security at a concert. No security. Every just walks right in. but also more chances of fucked up shit.  more security=less flow more restrictions. less bullshit. but everything is slower.  
---
with todays technology. there will never a 100% bug/cheat free game. There will never be a lag free game.
---
You still need 5% hit against mobs your level, 6% for 61, 7% for 62 and 9% for 63.
---
I like to be hit capped before I think of anything else. Currently running a crossbow and +7 hit (3 from talents, 2 devilsaur set, 1 trinket (horde benefits) and 1 marauron ring). This works up until lv 62 mobs.  
---
There are some hit items you can get which should last a long time: boots from the bat boss in scholo, belt from urok doomhowl, bracers from the wolf boss in lbrs,  shoulders from the bael'gar quest or truestrike (gl with those).
---
It hurts to miss an aimed shot! Better make sure it doesn't :)
---
In your position, I'd use voone's grips + blade master leggings (so + 3 hit).
---
Also, keep running scholo! You can also get bloodmail boots for +1 hit as well.
---
Because PVE players are like vegans, they are always writing and sharing on reddit how HAPPY they are that they are not playing on a pvp server. We get it, you don't have to justify your choice by telling everyone how happy you are.
---
I hope he isn't thinking he's going to hit Rank 14 if he "doesn't have time to raid"
---
It's all kind of important. Consensus seems to be defense to somewhere between 380-400. generally 1-2 piece of "threat" gear, something like savage glads for the crit or voones for hit. You probably want every piece other than your threat pieces to be plate and have stam/defense on them. hit rings from princess/DM trib. 
---
It's honestly all just a balance, if you're just starting out with a fresh guild your DPS likely won't be doing enough DPS to rip threat off of you anyway especially if they give you a buffer like they should be. 
---
The rule of thumb i've followed on my warrior is Defense to 380&gt;Hit to 6&gt;stam&gt;agi&gt;str every % of pure avoidance like dodge/parry is equal to around 8 defense rating.
---
its just like any other boss or mob
---
it has a loot table and drops stuff that is lootable by the player/party/raid that gets the tag on it
---
here is the loot table from one of them as example https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=6109/azuregos
---
That is only if you move your character perspective. Don't mouse look when FD'ing and you're fine.
---
Vanilla had paid transfers, dolt.
---
Yep this is on blaumeux! I was so surprised at the novelty of it I have him 55s for his deviate delight
---
Can confirm, its like 10:1 Ally to Horde ratio on Heartseeker. Its more of an educated guess based on the fact every raid and farming zone is completely owned by Ally with literally no contesting happening what so ever. Horde generally wont even attack you in leveling zones due to the fact another ally is probably 10 feet away and there are no other horde anywhere to be seen.
---
&gt;  Alliance raider you have your Hearthstone in Menethil.
---
i don't think i have ever heard or someone setting their HS in Menethil. i played Ali 15 years ago and i play it now
---
This feels weird, didn't expect to see myself in a screenshot on reddit
---
Can only see my nametag, though
---
And the inn means a mailbox.
---
You either ignored or failed to understand what I said.
---
If you think everyone in your raid is playing optimally, specced optimally, geared optimally, and using optimal consumables you are deluding yourself. If you think that happened in vanilla you are also deluding yourself.
---
I’m a noob rogue what’s the purpose of both pickpocketing and locksmithing? What’s the point of leveling them
---
The PvP system is less than a week from being released.
---
What?? Retail is the normal economy? With Garrison abuse and 5 million gold mounts? Explain please.
---

Set bonus is amazing if you farm open world, in raids can't say, i dont rly heal my pet. For mara is good as well.
---
I dont care about what you say and yet here you are replying to me ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
If you don't ban a bot the first day, they'll recoup their investment and when they do get banned it's very likely they're profitable already. That means they have more money to re-invest.
---
Blizzard loves botters because they pay monthly subscription. I 100% think if players didn't FORCE blizzard to ban them, they never would. 
---
I ran bots 24 hours a day 7 days a week for MONTHS in retail before I got banned. That was enough money to recoup my investment 3 x so by the time I did get banned I had plenty of cash to start up again.
---
No good botter does multiple accounts from the same public IP
---
No good botter uses the same bot
---
I don't know about typical. My unbuffed armor is somewhere around 7.6k, and my unbuffed health is normally just under 6k. Fully buffed I end up at I believe 6899 HP, but I don't know how those buffs affect my armor because I never really check armor during a raid. 
---
We just have more mitigation buttons than druids, + a shield. Their raw stats should still beat warriors in bear form, but the block chance from the shield mitigates a lot of damage that druids would be forced to soak.
---
Possible they paid a power leveling service.
---
i have no idea what any of this gear is
---
How does respec costs mean it is fake complexity. Being able to fail at something means it is more complex not less. Messing up your first character is a right of passage. Almost everyone does it. It is part of learning how to play the game.
---
For example...
---
Text: lol
---
Horde sees it as “bur”
---
Alliance sees it as “kek”

Fury warrior - currently with 2x Chorushs blade. Besides Dalrend set, are there any obtainable blades which would be an upgrade? Obtainable, as in both financially (looking at you, Quel) and realistically (Ironfoe dream)
---
Someone in general chat asked me why bother farming felcloth in felwood as a warlock, when I could enslave demons and farm elites for that
---
Where could i do that? Googling it pointed me to some DM route and also showed me winterspring and blasted lands but nothing concrete only wowhead database.
---
I'm a lvl 58, what could i solo farm that is more profitable. Are there any more zones to farm felcloth? Except felwood and azshara
---
I said that. I'm still not a huge fan of the classic talent tree. For high-skilled players there is only an illusion of choice given that there is a best build for whatever it is that you're doing. 
---
For lower-skilled players (like my wife who selected talents from every tree because she didn't know better) the trees were confusing to the point where you just don't care where the points are actually being put.
---
Now, to be completely fair, the current system isn't great for low-skilled players either because each of the three choices offer different abilities that mostly do the same sort of thing on each tier (with some obvious exceptions). It's just at this point, if you're not doing end game content there really aren't and "wrong" talent choices. 
---
For higher-skilled players, you can tailor your talent choices based on different fights or if you're doing PvP on the fly.
---
I could just like you know.. flag myself.
---
Random number generator. Loot is determined randomly and sometimes it stacks in one direction for awhile.
---
Until a week or two ago, this wasn’t the prevailing hypothesis regarding the threat mechanic. It’s relatively new, and not everyone sits in discords all day, so it’s definitely not common knowledge.
---
what you lose is, time? i assume it varies from person to person
---
Delightful
---
Blizzard doesn’t have the capabilities to fix this. If they did then it would’ve been fixed a long time ago because retail lags even worse than this.
---
Ah yes, the immersion of realism in world of warcraft
---
Yeah I can’t use these as a feral Druid in classic.
---
&gt;The lich king is always a loose end, as whoever you put under the helm, eventually will succumb to it's corruption.

---
It's been a problem since classic released so I'm sure they are aware of it and looking for a solution to start phase 2. Curious to see if they are going to be able to do anything about it. Does anyone remember if this was this much of an issue at this stage in the life of vanilla back in the day?
---
Yea, saw a guy begging for bags level 1 in SW a few weeks ago. I called him out on it in /y. A few minutes later he whispered me that someone gave him a gold.
---
I was beyond mad, mostly towards that 60.
---
Im so glad i rolled on a pvp server so shit inst boring as death.
---
much higher than a vanilla server is supposed to be.
---
Finding one in the same demographic isn't ideal. You need to find one with the same goals and plans as you. This way you can come together to achieve these goals. I'll play with anyone from 12 yrs old up to 90. As long as they want to raid to the best of their ability, will take criticism, and just have fun in general.
---
Ooh really. Okay I need to get this.
---
A group of us ran SM Armory the whole way through and it wasn't until we got to Herod we realised the Party Leader forgot to reset the instance...

if they are getting whacked they aren't kiting.

The Rake. Cat 1.2 attack speed found in Mulgore, just a bit East of Thunderbluff.

---

---
Its just your phrasing bruv, u like golf does that make u a bad parent? Prob not even a factor in that equation. So why is gaming? U talk like if u play X amount of hours then u neglect your kids... but Hey only my POV
---
Stop putting words in my mouth it’s annoying.
---
My point is Combat Swords and Daggers are both strong. Good swords are just more readily available right now. Mirah’s, Brutality, Dal’rends, Thrash Blade, Viskag. It is one of the reasons why most Rogues are Combat Swords right now. And it’s also why I would advise going Combat Swords. UNLESS you get Perdition and Core Hound, then switch to Dagger and fuck shit up.
---
I also don’t understand why you bring BWL items into this discussion. OP wasn’t asking what to spec in phase 3.
---
Nice. Was thinking about rolling a little alt over there, but...with what time? :P I love RP servers.
---
I had that issue and bought a pro key off eBay for super cheap.
---
Enrage is dope for fury prot tho.  Where you can get crit and still stand.  Shame about the sit crit fix.
---
So is every UBRS a raid run? Will I be competing with 9 other players for my BiS gear? Or is it viable to run UBRS with 5 man?

We dont get triggered, we just make sure you understand youre a carebear.
---
Is there even one person who is expecting the depicted expectation?
---
He had to have paid someone, wouldn't make much sense for a total noob to surpass experienced players, and get purple gear before even hitting lvl 60. He could also have been a different person with a similar name. Or he studied his ass off and just has more time to play than you do.
---
If you put stand and sit on the same macro you can use a single macro like a toggle instead of using two.
---
It is very gear reliant...which means if you are just questing along trying to do yellow quests it will be quite difficult and slow.  However warriors also have the advantage of being able to get into the content that gives the good gear quite easily...as a tank.  With mostly dungeon gear and a great weapon doing quests on a warrior is actually quite quick...until you gets a whisper asking you to tank another dungeon which is still good xp.
---
I know it's not how it worked back then, but opening locked chest for your group seems a good way to make dungeon budy.
---
It feel so self entitled when a rogue keep a chest to himself when it's one of the reason to bring one. 
---
Or do DM north tribute which is the best with a good rogue. Dunno If anything is needed for rogue here..
---
Pit-pocketing can be used to farm dungeons. 
---
A lot of locked boxes drop in dungeons as you level up, boxes that you can picks. You can get A LOT of good gear, potions, scrolls, metal, ore, etc. in those boxes. And, as a rogue, it is YOUR JOB to open them up. Just like mages open portals, warlocks summon/provide heal(and soul)stones etc.
---
ok boomer
---
some people go through life just begging. They survive, but they aren't living.
---
Whats that matter when you get max level in a day?
---
Also key abilities? I can't really think of any key abilities in retail, I guess each class has one thing that kinda sets em apart?
---
DK has grip
---
Pally has bubble
---
Rogue has uh... half the classes can be not visible now I guess.
---
Mage...uh idk
---
Priest can well...oh mindcontrol!
---
DH can jump glide! That's pretty sick
---
Warriors can spell reflect
---
Hurts my brain to try to think of other mostly unique abilities. Every class can - quick movement, interrupt, multiple CCs, multiple offensive / defensives...
---
When you play a healer your own faction gives you a much better reason to hate them.
---
Stop standing in fiery shit
---
Having fun
---
380 ? Isn't the def cap at 440 ? Or is it only for later phase and to diffcult to have right now?
---
BGs are cross realm. And how exactly is being outnumbered in WPVP mean more honor/hour?
---
And how does one expect to do any serious Ranking up if they don't even have time to raid? 
---
Seems like a high pop server with even population would be better.... Might be able to play pug some raids at least...
---
Keep in mind, there is no Burning Crusade right now. And even if there were, Pservers have been doing just fine for years, even with other options available.
---
Ask character boosts from blizzard. Maybe lfg for instant grouping.
---
Generally speaking, a mix between threat and mitigation, especially for a newer tank, is perfectly fine. If you're confused about different BiS lists, I'd just use the one on Wowhead. It doesn't offer multiple sets like Fight Club does, and it doesn't give the hardcore optimal options either (i.e., Edgemaster's) but it's a good introductory set, and automatically throws 2 pieces of mail gear at you as BiS so you can mix and match threat and survival. 
---
If you want some of my personal recommendations for which pieces are important, I'd recommend checking out this [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dri9ga/warrior_tank_when_am_i_raid_ready/f6lti0b/?context=3). Please note, my recommendations were based on his gear, so some of what he has is good (i.e., Voone's Vice Grips are amazing) and some of the other gear he has should immediately be replaced with better items, like Draconian Deflector and Brigam's Girdle. 
---
Let me know if you have any questions, and good luck in MC!
---
or worse: "lol mages dont dispell, ask the priest"
---
&gt; had more pve content than pvp.
---
it does, because the overwhelming majority of people dont give 2 shits about PVP. Hell they allow people to turn off PVP on PVP servers now and had to invent warmode to get people to do it
---
What do you mean pick pocketing can farm dungeons? How is that different from killing and looting the mobs
---
I'm not a warrior player so this is out of curiosity but why would you ever skip Tactical Mastery? It seems like such a good talent and you'll miss out on Overpower if you don't have it. Or am I mistaken?
---
The market was supplied somehow before. Buyign out the current stock doesn't stop the supply from coming in
---
Managing threat tables to have a tank on top when ony lands is asking a lot of the average player...
---
I think Vanilla end game has a gearing issue people don’t understand until they’re 60. If you’re a warrior/rogue/mage getting any raid gear is extremely slow. Like, you could go multiple months in some cases and get no pieces. With 40 people and 2-3 drops per boss, it’s important to a lot of people to get the bosses on farm ASAP.
---
I’m not saying people are screwed if they reroll now, but getting fully geared isn’t very practical for a lot of classes and it’s important to begin progressing with a guild ASAP.
---
ZG and AQ 20 do provide great ways to catch up to be viable in AQ 40 and Naxx, but if you want to be “Geared” it’s not a very forgiving end game unfortunately.
---
I was assuming that you would pull three to five mobs, and the lock would put his succy on your primary target, DoT them all one at a time until all mobs were dotted, and then return to the primary target, life tap, and use drain to burn it down. Then keep repeating this process until all mobs were destroyed. 
---
If the lock is solo, yeah they would chain pull mobs one at a time, but given consecration and whatever that reflective shield thing is that pallies do to cause mobs to damage themselves, I’m assuming you’ll AoE pull. I think having the Lock use hellfire would be too mana intensive, but eh it could work if you’re also having to drink after every pull.
---
Isn't Krol Blade an upgrade? Also, please don't be another fury warrior who thinks Quel'serar is decent for you. Blues would be better for a fury DPS than Quel, it pains me seeing these fury warriors rushing Quel'serar.

This is pretty damning evidence of Blizzards incompetence as a company.

D3 plays like a Diablo game made by WoW developers. Keep in mind Blizzard North was effectively its own company with its own culture / art design / ethos for most of its lifespan.
---
Diablo 1 &amp; 2 were dark, gothic, borderline horror games. The questing was elegant and stayed out of the way, the story militaristic. 
---
Diablo 3 had a crazy bright color pallette with current-era Blizzard's focus on colour spell and loot explosions everywhere. You had emots nonstop, a storyline that kept interrupting what you were doingt, boss times and enrages and a constant tuning of loot akin to an MMO.
---
What limited exposure we've had to Diablo 4 feels and looks much more like the original titles. Its the only thing that really grabbed me after this Blizzcon to be honest.
---
Retail wow looks content light, and basically a maintenance expansion. The storyline in WoW has been garbage ever since Cata and that isn't changing.
---
Overwatch 2 is basically a big patch. But they'll charged $60 for the next iteration of the game since money. 
---
Diablo 4 though? Just the cinematic alone was a massive commitment, and the gameplay looks much more authentic and interesting.

To piggyback off of what he said, I healed my way from 53-60 R-Sham, and hopped in any group I could. It didn't matter what the goal of the group was , it was all experience. Towards 56/57 you can definitely be a little more picky about which runs you do cause then you can start healing Scholo/Strat/DM:W,N,E
---
I'm shocked at how you're missing the point here.
---
I'm not saying that respec costs means it's fake complexity. I never said this, nor did I imply it.
---
I'm saying that high respec costs doesn't make it "real" complexity. Which was your argument, that because respec costs were high, it was "not fake complexity".
---
In reality, they're completely orthogonal.
---
Crippling poison in pve? I know several tanks who would go full on berserk on you for using it. It prevents the tank from kiting mobs into the next pull to make the run faster.
---
I hate the kodos mount. Coming from a Tauren char, please change my mind before mount level!
---
Neither did you....  Everything in moderation is all I got to say.
---
And you can do it by yourself.  A rogue can make 40+ gold per hour just pickpocketing BRD alone.

Out of all the rogues i've had in my groups levelling up, only 1 would distract patrols
---
An epic BoE ring dropped when I was running a dungeon 13 something years ago on my Warlock. I still remember getting so excited my heart rate went up, sweaty palms, all that. Googled the ring to find out it's value, should I equip or sell it? Apparently a great twink item, and I already had an epic staff, maybe this should be a twink character? 
---
Then the time went out to need/greed and I automatically passed on it.  
---
The hype caused my brain to

I kept having runners in my BRD last night, started applying CP, and the whole run went WAY more smoothly.
---
you only need ~30% to make it work, its easily to get to right now
---
the bigger issue is hit for raiding as SF right now
---
Thank you for rolling on a pve server instead of playing on pvp and bitching about it.
---
Lol yes I know :P
---
It is gonna be a patch though. So I still fully believe that they will fix it with that patch. Don't know why I get downvoted for actually trusting in Blizzard :O
---
They stood to their word in regards to layering. So I'm hopeful they will also fix this.
---
Lots of potential for price fixing with things like devilsaur mafias.
---
Its really just what you like more. Bot are raw dps. Do you want to stun and burst people with your mele weapons. Or doing you want to kite and torment fools with your frost spells? Cant really say one is better than the other.
---
It's value will basically only increase as more money gets into the economy, but more people will farm it too so it's tough to say if it will appreciate that much.  Early in p3 might be the best time, when twink BGs become a thing.

Good daggers are scarlet kris, darrowspike, gutgore ripper, bonescraper, distracting dagger, dagger from Ony pre q ( dunno the Name with + dagger), barkeepers shanker, Kris of zul serak.

Besides the fact dal rends is so hard to get, there are At least equal aquivalents for dagger.

By no keybinds they mean they setup their keybinds in clique, which is separate from yoir action bars. It's basically like using mouseover macros but you can also bind right/left and middle click.
---
Based on other replies in this thread, it looks like your first talent will be at 10 and you'll get a new one every 5 levels until 50 with Soulbinding being unlocked at 60.
---
You will naturally decay 20% of the total honor needed to obtain your rank, which is trivial below rank 6.
---
Once you hit Rank 11 and 12 does the Honor Contribution Points start to hit hard.
---
I've already seen something like "go to bfa" from alliance players.
---
Isn’t that 12% difference?  
---
And typically I am good to go in a dungeon that I am the appropriate level for.  In this instance it just didn’t seem like my output was enough.
---
Not for those classes, but yes. Paladin, Hunter, and Warlock seem to be the easiest three to gear, but of course that's completely anecdotal.
---
Last two weeks, we've gotten so much paladin gear that every single paladin in the raid walked out with at least 2 pieces. Last night we got enough hunter pieces that every single hunter walked out with 2 pieces of gear, and some got 3, and the same for warlocks. It's getting to the point where more than half of them are passing on gear because they already have it. 
---
Meanwhile, after 5 weeks of MC, I saw my first ever Warrior BoE drop last night, which I promptly rolled a 3 on. That would have finished my 3-piece Might set, too.
---
I am actively trying to recruit rogues for my raid group. I only have 3 rogues, and while a couple warriors out dps them, they are consistently high on the damage charts, and are overall much better players. They stay alive better, respond to boss mechanics better (not related to their class, but that the player behind them is more competent). And I want more. At least 2 more. 
---
I also want a resto druid (I have 0) a couple of hunters, and more paladin healers.
---
What I've come to find out is that so many people wanted to play the "best" of something, that they completely forgot that blizzard actually did a fairly decent job balancing wow classic (eventually). I have 6 priests. Does a priest do more hps than a paladin or druid? Of course. But a paladin has more longevity while healing a tank. A druid provides hots that cover gaps in healing when the tank healer gets punted or has to move. Paladins also provide blessings, which are invaluable.
---
Warriors are the best melee dps, mages and warlocks the best ranged dps. But you still need hunters. The first raid I led into MC, despite having over 30 guilides, I had to pug a hunter, just so I had 2 to dispel the frenzy on Magmadar. I remember when hunters were extremely common.
---
I wish more people had gone into classic to play what they enjoyed, rather than what was "best".
---
&gt; (agil vs. wf) 
---
Did someone say totem twisting?
---
Probably a rogue. Maybe mage tho. However a lot of pretty capable.
---
&gt; If OP and his son are experienced players they are ultra casual, because 32-40 in two weeks is very, very slow.
---
We are both somewhat experienced (I played WoW 2006-2009, we played 2015-2016; no private server play), but we also have some inefficiency "problems":
---
We only play (our mains) when we can both play together. So we only actually play for xp less than 10 hours a week.
---
We are wanting to hit all the leveling dungeons for the experiences (as well as for gear). So some of our less than 10 hours a week is spent traveling and/or LFGing.
---
We are playing a warrior (me) and a warlock, so we aren't the best class pair for fast leveling.
---
If I was playing by myself, I'd probably level faster because I'd spend more time questing and mob grinding than travelling and LFGing to/for dungeons.
---
If he was playing by himself, he'd level much faster because he has a lot more free time than I do.
---
Gutterspeak appears the same to non-undead as Common appears to the horde. Anything the alliance can say to the horde, the undead can say to everyone else.
---
What's the limit? I haven't done any grinding yet, started with a warrior and rerolled at 57 from the horrible grind so no idea
---
Yes you can, but this is one of the rare scenarios that should be talked about instead of just using crippling by default.
---
Also this will only apply if the tank is underleveled for the content he is doing and/or a very bad player which also would mean that he probably doesn't know how to kite properly anyway.
---
also stops the tank getting dazed while running to the next pull
---
I love that you got downvoted when making an obvious joke.  
---
Anyway I just like gnomes over all the alli races.
---
Eh it's too expensive lol. I'm 200g away from epic mount so not gonna blow close to 300g for that set that's just gonna get replaced soon anyway. I'm doing well on the dps charts and our guild is progressing through MC fine, and I'm 1 of like 3 hunters so I'll be in giantstalkers soon lol.
---
I haven't walked to the end of the hall yet, but I think the mob exists (the other ones do), it's just that the quest drop doesn't exist yet.
---
The realm population is like 5x compared to classic with the same amount of shit from back in the day. It will be fine.
---
Does this still make a rogue lose his combo points on Target? Otherwise whenever I change targets it's bye-bye CPs.
---
humanoids
---
Nice! What’s that bag addon btw?
---
I think you missed the part that the intro is also part of the joke, like old Flyn, Hydra, Vurtne, Kalimist and other famous pvpers in the early days of arena and late days of vanilla.
---
It’s never been fixed in retail. That’s the rub, we have no reason to believe blizzard cares about large scale PvP.
---
&gt;leave this out
---
The start of the video is literally in the Foothills.
---
Goes the same way for adults using racial and homophobic slurs in a video game. Grow the fuck up and it wouldn't be a problem.
---
I feel you. I have all the mats for lionheart helm, but the guy with the pattern wants 300g to craft it. Where am I supposed to come up with that? I've got 100g to my name and nowhere to farm. And if I want to get into pug groups I pretty much have to tank, which I hate. Frustrating.
---
Except someone then posts even more for the normal price again, all your over-market-price stacks don't sell and you are left bag holding. 
---
Commodities are very hard to corner like that.  The market for an item needs to be slower and lower volume for that to work.   There's too much of deviate being posted and sold constantly. 
---
If the price fluctuates (by more than the 6% AH cut) you can potentially make money reselling commodities by timing the cycles, but there's still some risk of a macro trend coming along and messing you up.
---
Cryopier SMASH
---
It's just straight DPS that goes into that conversion. Meaning only the crit chance that intellect gives. That conversion is a nice thing to look at, but doesn't factor in the max mana that intellect gives so keep that in mind.
---
343/331=1.036. Aka using GH1 is 4% more mana efficient than H4. Subtracting percentages directly usually results in meaningless numbers.
---
I know. I have played P-Servers. I also know how much it lags. 
---
I'm just Saying that I trust in Blizzard Fixing this Prior to release or with the PVP release next week.
---
Well to be honest I think it will be difficult for Blizzard to do given they don't actually have physical Servers anymore. So they can't do that much by themselfs really.
---
But I trust they will pressure their Service Provider so much that they will sort it out... Afterall Blizzard is huge and other companies try to please them.
---
Just trust in Blizz and it will be OK I'm sure. Latest one week after release with a huge uproar of the community this will be fixed!
---
By posting this and spreading awareness, you are giving that group a bigger platform.  Myself and many others would never have even known this was going on if it wasn't for this virtue signaling.  
---
So, while what they are doing is terrible... who is actually responsible for spreading their ideals to the masses here?
---
I don't think you've got that right, as what you've done here is literally judge the film by its cover. The cover set an expectation, you didn't enjoy the film because you expected it to be something different based on its cover. Hence, you judged it by its cover and because of the preconceived biases you went into the film with you didn't like it. The phrase doesn't necessarily mean never seeing/reading the product, it works in this case as well.
---
yea, its easier to f up kazak. im not lying we already have an army of sub level 10s parked out there for this exact purpose
---
&gt; wowbash
---
https://web.archive.org/web/*/wowbash
---
Doesn't look like the internet archive saved the images... damn.
---
Yea we camped this dude and his mage buddy for a while, didn’t see that in the video
---
Welcome back! Did you enjoy your 'break' from WoW? :)
---
I was just using purification which is 10% more healing, then plus the value of mana tide and most likely healing way as well. That seems like about 10-20% to me.
---
Yo bro, register your windows!
---
Atleast Blizzard servers don't take a random crapper and roll you back all the time.
---
It's not a matter of opinion, let's see.
---
Horde is ez mode
---
lol
---
Have no clue. You should not be able to vote if you don't comment in my opinion.
---
I’m about 3 weeks into full raiding but I’m a Druid so I’ve geared extremely quickly. 1 T2, 4 T1 (My tier 1 generally isn’t very good anyway). But in the 3 weeks all of our rogues mages and warriors are pretty much still in full pre-raid aside from a few people that have dumped a lifetime of DKP into some random piece.
---
Especially these classes get screwed coming late to the party due to extremely high supply of them and high competition for their gear. If anything they can join an equally geared raid that’s starting up that starts progression from zero. 
---
Do they have time? Yes. Will it hinder them to start over right now and play catch-up all of P3/P4? Absolutely
---
Just kidney shot them when they start running :p
---
I apologize for the misunderstanding, those are the ultimate pre-raid pieces to aim for. He was using worse alternatives in both cases, and since both Deflector and Girdle are great items, I advised him to get both of those as soon as possible. 
---
There's really nothing else that compares to either item. Closest alternative would be Skullflame Shield, which is expensive and also going to be replaced as soon as you get Drillborer's Disk, so I wouldn't say it's worth the money unless you're into the look of it. I don't know of an equivalent belt other than the Onslaught Girdle from Ragnaros,the hit% on Brigam's is pretty hard to replace.
---
imagine thinking the complexity of PoE is fake
---
It's a pug. Watch threat meter, if tank isn't putting out a lot of threat then you just stop attacking. You don't keep pushing threat and then be like lol tank should aggro more. Use your head.
---
That's not the point, buddy.
---
There is a 5 per hour per account limit on resetting / entering new dungeons. So you if you’re farming a dungeon or looking for a rare mob in a dungeon, it’s good to keep track.
---
/r/microsoftsoftwareswap
---
Oh, ive hopped right into Ungoro since the Hinterlands was empty for me and I've already done all the main Feralas quests too. Besides that escort chicken one (fuck that one)
---
You are delusional, the effects will be felt serverwide and when Sally McCasual in The Barrens has to wait 30 seconds to loot her Plainstrider beaks you best believe there will be complaining and annoyance.
---
This is disheartening. If blizzard doesn’t know how to fix maybe they should reach out to the private servers guys for tips.lol!
---
Not sure what you mean by "negative honor". If you mean DKs, each DK instantly reduces your Rank Points (Your current rank score) by 100 at level 60. It subtracts it instantly. If you're say, at 0 RP into Rank 10 and get just 1 DK, you will instantly go down to Rank 9 and 34900 RP.
---
AdiBags. :)
---
We don't banish them. Just have a fury throw on some midigation gear and tell him to tank two of them.
---
Cant go to the last boss without killing 2 other bosses first
---
Ah ok, I assume it's per dungeon not just 5 resets of all dungeons?
---
Looks like adibags to me
---
You are one expansion ahead of time!
---
You get way more than 20 nightfins per hour if you go to a good spot at the right time of day.
---
Thanks
---
I don't recognize the faces of the actors. The words on the building are in German and it appears to be snowing.  This doesnt look like Bob but I can be wrong everyone else in the thread says it is. Weird huh?
---
You very much can compare the two. Just not directly
---
But if blizzard had a client 14 years ago that could handle mass pvp even on worse server infrastructure, but they no longer can handle that pvp on the new clients and new (and improved) server infrastructure, then clearly there is some kind of flaw in the new client or server infrastructure, that blizzard has to find and solve.
---
Yeah. People who play 40+ hours a week without batting an eye don't understand people who can't/won't just drop everything and reinvest in a 5-10 days /played investment to be raid ready on a different character.  
---
It can be done, but we're talking about long-term investment. With most of a person's free time. Over the course of weeks.
---
Great answer man! The 5% for level 60 is what I needed, I can still do that with my other gear + bow racial and still get  that 100 bonus AP.
---
Thanks a lot!
---
I use the one built into Tukui, long time favorite ui overhaul :D
---
/r/microstsoftsoftwareswap   Ftw
---
Started later, Plays more. 
---
Playing with you he realized how much other things are available in the game so he got into it much more.
---
Watching Videos on YouTube can get you a really Long way! Watch 30-40 Videos about classic and you are not a newbie anymore :P
---
But your explaination about his dads acc. and his child is playing also makes a lot of sense!
---
He hooked me up with a fish and I immediately ran over to the rock elementals and paid my debt with the blood of lvl38 paladin.
---
Imagine being so miserable you need to make others feel just as miserable.
---
Yikes.
---
I just hope I actually get to do runs for my gear and find it myself instead of buying it off some fucking auction house. I want to run for specific uniques and great items, not buy everything for my character. That killed the game for me. I had no desire to actually play because there was no point. Also, I want to level to 99 and I want the last 30 levels to be a commitment.
---
Wish I could upvote you twice.
---
True
---
Everybody was noob at some point.
---
Yep.  If I'd wanted to build combo points I wouldn't have rolled a goddamned Paladin, I'd have rolled a rogue.  Still a little sore over it all these years later.
---
Very true!
---
&gt; I just checked OP's post history and he claimed to be 32 in a post "4 weeks ago", so it's 3+ weeks since he met this dude. It's definitely easily possible to level that quickly if you play a lot, even if you're a bit of a noob.
---
&gt; *actually FOUR weeks. That is extremely slow.
---
OMG! Has it really been that long? I just hit level 41 last night, but we haven't played (these mains, for leveling) since last week (we didn't this past weekend). We need to get our game time organized.
---
haha
---
Yeah you can kind of stand under her, but you want to stand sort of at her flank instead of directly under her in case she deep breaths.  You should have enough time to get far enough away as long as you aren't directly under her.
---
That’s it. Rerolling.
---
Ooh i thought its only hit as i always played casters .Nice ,thanks
---
Not enough head banging and fist pumping
---
What mooncloth bags are at 3g???? They go for 20-24g on Herod atm. Hell just one mooncloth is around 17g. 
---
Runecloth bags are around 2.5-3
---
I was a Gnomish Engineer, and reset and now learned Goblin. But I destroyed my Gnomish Engineering Membership Card when I switched, and now I don't know how to obtain a Goblin one because the guy in Tanaris acts like he doesn't have a quest for me. Does anyone know how to get a Goblin Engineering Membership Card? Or do I need to wait the 14 days of game time that would normally be required for the card to expire and then try and renew it?
---
What class/classes do Mages struggle the most against in PvP? Basically talking more about open world unstructured PvP.
---
This spot almost always had fight going back in vanilla.
---
This is not true, I've had chests spawn in right in front of me while running around looted them and got nothing but junk. There is no guarantee of blues or greens even on the higher level chests, and if you partially loot a chest it will eventually despawn on its own
---
Not as long as it's an important quest giver.
---
&gt;Boomie: No one is glad you exist  
---
All the mages in my guild have been trying to get our 0/30/21 Druid to go Balance for the crit buff for like 3 weeks. There's a demand for Boomies, even if it is just DPS trying to climb the meters even more.
---
Jenri.
---
What server are you on? On Mankrik people still act warm and fuzzy on horde side at least and give free enchants bags all the time. I was in blasted lands killing the servants of grol near alter of storms and a 5 man of alliance were doing the elite part of the quest i just "helped" dps the named elite and everyone of those ally /thanked me. Was playing on my warr in barrens with guildy and grouped up with mage and priest to kill one of the centuar. Had a good time chatting waiting for respawn now i have another healer prieat added to friend list. There is still good players out there. Some bad eggs too. But you can just ignore them.
---
&gt;People were pouring hours into the beta knowing their characters would be deleted. 
---
What makes you think those players are these players? Not everyone has the same tolerance/enjoyment of non-permanent character advancement. I say this as someone who does actually like it.
---
&gt;You could be 60 just a little after phase 2 launches and all that preraid BiS and MC/Ony gear is still going to be there when you hit 60.
---
There's a large assumption of where people are gearing/game wise. A lot of people are not in pre-raid bis gear.
---
&gt;People's reactions are usually "You can't be serious" or "There's no time to reroll before Phase 2"
---
The second point that you dismissed is probably the most "logical" of the complaints. Leveling post P2 is going to be harder, so people are using this as a big boogeyman trying to convince themselves it will be impossible.
---

---
I think the reality is split between "If I have to put in another 150-200hrs to play endgame again, I'd rather just play a different game" and a healthy dose of character/social attachment. Your acquaintances, your guild, all the achievements you made are null if you re-roll (in people's minds of course). All the unfun things you did to have fun have now been completely undone.
---
Really I'd say it's the nature of WoW itself. It encourages long term investment by doing things you likely don't enjoy. So once you've done a bunch, the prospect of having a lot more non-fun to get to the fun bit again is rather unappetizing.
---
Ah right I get you now. On re-reading it now makes complete sense.
---
Thanks! Glad to know I've got a few tanking BiS items sorted :)
---
He's not even shadow smf fam
---
Still though, the darkness of the game while not being a huge deal at face value, is indicative of other problems. D1/2 were grim and depressing. Attempts to make the game less violent, brighter or more cartoonish can potentially be red flags of a game just trying to reach the lowest common denominator
---
If you play warrior,  you have to commit to it,  because it's the worst leveling by far.  If your main goal is to be useful to guildies, you might consider going druid since they level fast and can fill any needed role,  especially in dungeons.
---
Bingo
---
You really don't need them. If you are combat spec you'll have 5% from talents + 305 weapon skill, meaning you're only going to actually need 1% hit from gear to get yellow capped.
---
6-piece shadowcraft + devilsaur is probably the real pre-raid BIS; additional hit from rings/trinkets/ranged weapon isn't useless since it does help your white damage but you definitely don't need to prioritize it as much as the initial lists were saying.
---
wait the 14 days.
---
congrats! Took me almost 100 runs to see Assassin's Blade, then got Shadowfang on the very next run.
---
For Arcane Power Frost single target only I would say around 350 frost spellpower.
---
It's the new "savage".
---
My fucking god the amount of people (in their twenties!) who went around using that word. When asked what it means, they didn't even know.
---
And the only warlock a raid should bring is an alt in quest greens that sits outside the instance and hands out cookies.  
---
And the only rogue a raid should bring is a fury warrior.  
---
And the only Horde character you should bring to raid is Alliance, cause Horde has no Blessing of Salvation which means they\`re inferior in PvE.
---
TOP DEEPS can you read now?
---
... What? Is this the new wave of enclave trolling or something?
---
"Hey, don't call out that group that likes so subliminally spread racism and white supremacy! That's *SPREADING THEIR MESSAGE*!"
---
Like, no, it obviously isn't? There's a reason they don't share that info publicly you dingus. That's how alt right recruitment works, nobody falls for their bullshit when you can see it out in the open. Calling it out and rooting it out is what you do to fight it.
---
Is that 14 days of /played or just 14 days total? I've read it's /played, but without a card myself I can't really confirm it.
---
Shadowfang Keep
---
I'm not much of a fan of current LoL so I can't say id trust them to not screw it up.
---
I hated how pretty much every class has had a change similar to this at some point in their lifespan. My fury warrior went from being a master of all weapons, burying enemies in a flurry of attacks from a variety of 1-handers  to being forced to use dual 2h weapons of a limited range of types. My resto shaman went from providing raid wide utility, mana restoration and aoe healing to... having the exact same heals as every other healer, but green. My mage went from slinging shards of ice to...frostfire? Why the fuck is there fire in my frost.  If I wanted to be throwing fireballs, I'd be fire spec. At least that one went away.
---
They thought it didn't matter because everyone uses the 'best' build anyway, but it turns out not everyone wants to be absolutely optimal and would rather just play the character that they liked enough to invest hundreds of hours to bring to the cap with EXTRA stuff rather than fundamentally altering how their characters work and making them completely new every time an expansion hits. Who knew. Except everyone.
---
Sure and you have a horde/Druid tag and sorting by new on the classic wow.
---
Why do people feel the need to lie like this?
---
I am doing my first raid tonight in MC but my computer is a bit bad. It drops 15 framerate or so in Ironforge with the 40+ people so I am afraid of it chopping out when all the spell effects are going wild.
---
What can I do to increase performance besides clear it with air cannister, disk defrag, disk cleanup, and clear WoW cache? WoW isn't the only thing that lags, the whole computer is laggy as a whole.
---
Ahh ok, damn well i guess I shouldn't have vendored my stuff when I upgraded.
---
Yes. Pickpocketing has different loot than killing. If you just kill an NPC they might have 3 silver. If you pick pocket you get 2 silver and a lockbox, then kill them and get that 3 silver as will
---
World of Warcraft has attracted alot of edgy bois over the years, it's no surprise they cannot tell the difference between their own kind of trolls and an actual hate group.
---
You’ve used everyone’s luck for the next week, thanks a lot asshole
---
Meanwhile, Sulfuras NA Eastcoast PvP is probably as close to 50:50 split on a PvP server you can get, and its great.
---
Sometimes the Horde is the dominant faction in BRM, then 5 minutes later alliance have taken over, and then flips back in forth indefinitely.
---
It is bis for dagger rogues.  You go mh sword oh sword. Or mh dagger oh dagger shouldn't be mixing if you are speced into one or the other.
---
Repairs, potions, consumables, all cost money. 
---
Mainly potions, you don't NEED your rage flask or your Shadow Power elixir, but should bring HP pots and Mana pots, maybe fire res pots if your resistance is a bit low.
---
Not all guilds are full clearing without issues, there are still a lot of people pugging to fill spots on our server.
---
Who else but rogues would roll on it anyway?
---
I would definitely give it to a dagger rogue first though.
---
I have 6 weeks raiding with just an Archmage Seal from raiding, not everyone gets gear in raids. If you want to PVP phase 2, it's  going to take a few weeks to level and another few weeks to get dungeon geared which is too late for some to consider rerolling depending on what they are going for.
---
I'm talking about seemingly limited supply items that have also been listed at a seemingly low price. There are just some servers that are currently not functioning rationally market wise. Too many people prospecting etc. MASSIVE reserves on several accounts not just a couple etc etc. Basically supply and demand has been thrown off in a weird if not massive way at the moment.
---
This isn't contained to WoW....
---
Payo from Method actually uses Viskag/CH tooth as OH.
---
So.. now I'm even more confused
---
What g/h do you usually make with dungeon farming? Is it faster gold than leveling a prof?
---
Oh yeah, I see that now. I watched the gif on my phone and couldn't tell how bad the clipping was, or how disconnected things are. That is... Hard to read.
---
The same is true of Taurahe. Do trolls have their own language? I don't recall.
---
&gt; There's also that little thing where a bow goes "boing" whilst a gun goes "BOOOOM!!!" everytime you shoot.
---
Out of curiosity: Does that actually make a difference? Do guns pull more mobs by accident because of noise?
---
correct
---
Feral is best during BWL progression until Nefarian.
---
Yeah, I don't blame them at all. No ill feelings towards anyone who drops groups due to roll competition. I personally don't mind running with competition in dungeons, because at least I still get to run it and have a good time. But like you said, after 50 runs you kind of just want to be done.
---
Bought mine for 10g in my server... Still there can't possibly be a huge price gap between the raw goidh and the cooked one, otherwise buying one just to cook it and Resell it would be the greatest gold making scheme
---
shut your pi hole!
---
That boy needs therapy.
---
Peredition's blade is a 1/6 drop chance.  
---
If your raid group has even 5 rogues, that's almost 5 months until you get your Peredition's blade on average.
---
Yes, you can get lucky, but that's not representative.
---
Warlocks
---
Warlocks and Spriests are for sure the hardest matchups. Druids and Hunters can also give trouble if they know what they are doing.
---
You can't do it alone, no. You need a army of farmers coding you the stuff if you want to corner a supply market..
---
You mean, out in the environment with PVE gear on? 🤔
---
You both sound like morons
---
It's from wowbash, so this was 2006/2007 or so
---
Still gold though
---
I went prot at 47 and regretted it, now I'm running 2h fury and I'd say it's worse than arms at this level just because of sweeping strikes and dual wild not being viable until you get hit rating.
---
Staff is epic bruh
---
I've only needed to do it a couple of times, but we've had no issues. MC can break early but shouldn't be immune against these mobs.
---
You should know. Whether or not you choose to do something about it is definitely your own character defining moment. Why attack the messenger when you can just introspect? You can call it whatever you want. I'm a guy, I think people should know about this thing that I think is awful, so I'm sharing what I know? 
---
Don't like it? Don't like me? Ignore it. Ignore me. (I would rather you reconsider, but hey, that's not my call)  Go ahead, be a part of the problem. You do you!
---
Noggenfogger is bis because it gives undead male animations for casting. (for gnome mage is bis at least :D)
---
&gt;There's plenty of weird gear that gets made pretty much exclusively for bear tanks, like all the leather with very high stamina
---
It\`s also for PvP rogues who don't wanna to be absolute glass cannons.
---
LOLOLOLOL good use of time
---
Golem lord for the trinket
---
I did notice that it is not working as kargoz was teaching in his videos. If you start with wanding I believe that a full swing is even needed for your first auto attack
---
That's something I can't answer:
---
I got banned for 1 of 2 tools which just interact with graphical movement + keyboard and mousecontrol. Technically if I used that tools over teamviewer, they'd work and be undetectable.
---
If blizzard allows teamviewer, they make themself blind for a wide variety of bots, that's why I think it's a grey area, same with virtual machines, linux (sandboxing) and MacOS (jails, sandboxing).
---
Tl;dr: Maybe :)
---
&gt; im not sure

So uhm, in other words you're naive and ignorant? Happens man.
---
In the mean time [you could educate yourself on dps scores from 10k raid logs](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/statistics/1000#metric=dps&amp;dataset=95&amp;class=DPS) and see that hunters will always outdps mages and warlock, and in many occasions rogues and warriors as well. So yeah, hunters will consistenly top the charts.
---
yeah WoW has always been pve centric.  I play on pvp servers because it makes the world feel more alive and I do enjoy world pvp occasionally.
---
But world pvp is only really good if the factions are relatively balanced. If you happen to be on one of the servers with a 2 or 3 to 1 horse alliance ratio. You are going to have a bad time.
---
You can clear raids without the best gear. Sure, an upgrade is an upgrade but if you're paying 500+ gold for 3sp, you better be in some crazy high level guild that is pushing out realm firsts, otherwise it's a poor investment.
---
I would DEFINITELY take the gold over the 3sp, but I'm not a mage so I can't literally turn mana into gold by selling water and food for hours a day on the IF bridge.
---
Every time we try to raid at the reset day there are Like 20 guildes around mc entrance and its get laggy quite fast
---
Good question, I'm not sure.  I just play Horde.
---
some people are just shitty people, you will encounter these people eventually.
---
I just posted my first yesterday morning with a question about selling a drop I had.  I was clear in the post that I’m a new player and that it was my first post.  After 15 min and three comments, the post was removed.  No explanation, nothing.  Certainly doesn’t give one motivation to post again.  Especially when I see some of the silliness that stays up.
---
no... good players ( that you probably don't see in 5-man anymore cause they are done with their pre-bis since a while) VS bad players.
---
While not max my account has a free lvl 110 upgrade sitting on it. So I could take any of my characters and just skip a large portion of the game. I used something similar before a couple expansions back when I dropped in on a free weekend thing. Had a lvl 30ish warrior and insta leveled him to 80.
---
I think you can buy such upgrades as well and leveling is probably a lot faster now too.
---
Hm, probably going to aim for R14 and then betting he can use a transfer to get out of alliance hell with his ill gotten gains in tow.
---
As a warrior, I love rogues, and want more actually. Why? Because they can use daggers far more effectively than I can. Are swords still better? Of course, but the difference is not so great that you are hampering your raid significantly. And now the weapons go to someone who can (actively) use them, and frees up sword drops for either other rogues or warriors.
---
&gt; you are missing 5% spell crit which noticeably makes you a worse raid healer.
---
Is it noticeable? For Phase 2, I was debating between Deep Holy and Holy Reck, but I don't want to take too much of a hit to my PVE healing. Holy Reck would obviously have to skip out on the crit for the extra damage. I was thinking this wouldn't be too huge, but if it is, then I'll stick to the Holy build.
---
From what I have researched, most variations are very subtle and come to personal preference. I believe Comb talents, Sub Talents are same and small changes in Ass.
---
You have less than 2 weeks to hit 60 and get geared before phase 2. It's quite humerous to think that's possible for anyone besides neets.
---
Glad I could help mon, have fun!
---
I think thats your own mentality, I would never think of looking at a guide especially when it comes to a new game.  
---
Also PoE's talent tree wasnt "fake complexity" and calling it such is just trying to make your own self feel better because you couldnt come up with your own build. Youre so used to things being so simple or having info spoonfed to you through a guide that PoE's talents made you quit.
---
Sounds like a joint effort.
---
then whats this got to do with the honor system??
---
I have the same problem as the person you replied. Replaced mobo and can't activate. I don't care how cheap it is, not going to spend money on something I already paid for.
---
Lol no, this is getting so overhyped. It’s not going to be that bad. Don’t be the person who riles everyone up for no reason.,
---
Great. You figured out how war works.
---
You pull him down to where you fight the water elemental boss?
---
Pages doesn't exist.
---
&gt; Not as a Holy Pally. Your best chest is cloth, your best pants are cloth, best boots, wrists, arms.. all cloth
---
Wrong. This is PVP, not pve. You wear as much plate/mail as you can regardless. 700 armor and +stats is superior to 17 extra spell damage or whatever in PVP. Again, you are outlasting everyone you are fighting. +healing &gt; +sp for PVP.
---
Plate of the shaman king is plate + SP, Rock pauldrons  from BRD, more plate +SP. Barrage girdle is mail +SP
---
My current Hpally loadout is:
---
Head: Lightforge
---
Neck:Tempest Talisman 
---
Shoulder: Lawbringer Spaulders or Earthslag Shoulders
---
Back: Hide of the wild or Spirtcaster Cape
---
Chest: Plate of the Shaman King or Lightforge
---
Bracers: Lawbringer bracers
---
Hands: Death Grips vs rogues or otherwise Harmonious Gauntlets/Lightforge
---
Waist: Barrage Girdle 
---
Pants: Judgment Legplates with +8 SP
---
Boots: Magma Tempered Boots
---
Rings: Songstone of Ironforge / Rosewine
---
Trinks: Burst of Knowledge / Secondwind
---
As an Hpally you should be going for toughness over everything else in PVP. You are literally useless if you wear cloth, as your role in BG's will be to survive and support your group. this is NOT raid healing, dont wear your pre-raid bis nonsense when fighting other people.
---
Fury tank is not great right now, you do not have access to the gear that allows you to generate threat and have healers keep you alive. Not to mention the dps classes aren't doing damage that requires fury tank yet. Prot tanking and fury dps both value the same things like hit% and crit but prot will lean for plate and fury for max crit
---
Minimum settings, kill non necessary processes in task manager (only if you're comfortable you understand what you can and can't kill), don't use discord on a cpu hog (Chrome w/ a million extensions).
---
There's a lot you can do but the first step would be identifying what you're bottleneck is. GPU, CPU, RAM paging. Some things you won't be able to compensate for. 
---
Alternatively just pretend it's 15 years ago and you have the normal experience.
---
It's great! Small horde pop, but I haven't had any bad experiences myself on it, and haven't seen so much assholery on it either.
---
What class are you? As a mage I've farmed elite demons in Winterspring for Eye of Shadow (~300g)
---
Also any level 60 can farm those satyrs efficiently, they're lvl 49-54 regular mobs
---
I thought we were talking duels but in wPvP I've chased many druids down with speed pots and trinkets. If they run, I sw:p and devouring plague which forces them to heal (and therefore stop running). 
---
Also here's how it works in a duel: druid doesn't leave cat? He dies to dots. Druid leaves cat to heal? Mana burn. Shapeshift to avoid manaburn? Cancel mana burn cast and druid lost 600 mana, dispel dot. Rinse and repeat to win
---
Is there a ranking of dps logs for classic with arms v fury warrior? I understand fury beats it but I was just wondering how much.
---
We get immune response nearly every run.  Weird thing is the immunity stops the cast from working but also doesn't start combat/create any aggro.  Even retrying on that same mob, immune again.
---
Just luring you into a false sense of security.
---
I was adamant about finding a guild to accept me as their only Shadow priest and luckily my buddies and I found one. Ive found that a few priests in my guild who switched from shadow during leveling to holy for raiding never play either. As a holy priest you have access to holy nova for AOE farming and if you have herbalism you can farm DM East for good money. But as shadow you're obviously competing with many classes for loot in raid so that is the tradeoff.
---
Also prophecy gear just never drops in my MC raids.
---
Run through loch modan.
---
It's not about pvp, it's just that the honor meatgrinder that happened on northdale afaik wasn't fun for anyone.
---
Hello friends so I’ve never played wow before but I have experience in other mmorpgs and similar games like MOBAS etc... I’m typically a tank player in almost any game (Reinhardt main with 100+ hours) so I intend to play a tank. From what I’ve gathered the tank classes are Warrior, Druid and Paladin. What’re some of the differences and pros/cons between these classes?
---
I hit up that AH wayy too soon. I never really got to enjoy D3 properly I think. I remember in D2 going to the sewers in act2 on hardcore mode was always a thrill.
---
And then when I got back into playing it was all about spamming rifts
---
I don't know if you have any sort of budget, but you can go to walmart or best buy these days and get a solid state drive for as little as 25 bucks. If you don't have one already it is hands down the cheapest upgrade and probably the most beneficial. It's easy to set up and if you just run Wow from it I guarantee you will notice a huge difference.
---
I dont see how that has any relavance. I just think your way of looking at life is delusional, pathetic and would lead the majority of people to live an unfulfilling, sad life as a loser.
---
But cool if it works for you... I just don’t think it does for most.
---
BEST. IN. SLOT.
---
Nice, good job on being such a pussy you switch from your server cause you were being killed on a PvP server. Very nice of you to leave your already underpopulated alliance behind to be even more outnumbered.
---
BC was probably the most fun I had in the game though that's also when I started. But put a lot of time into it. Wrath was fun as well for a while but got burned out during nax. Came back for ICC and played the first month of cata. During wrath and that early cata I grew to dislike the direction the game kept moving until I just couldn't motivate myself to log in anymore. The things they kept changing, or adding, or my pally and shaman didn't feel fun and felt like I was just being slowly homogenized into all the other classes.
---
So for onyxia when she drops down I can I just pop the device and then keep dpsing?
---
Are we taking bets here?
---
Yes but after leveling to 60 once, I'm good. It was fun, but it won't be fun a second time.
---
That's a pvp 2hander though. There's plenty of better ones for pve.
---
Yup. And bug him out the same as the first boss.
---
firefox + ublock
---
A lot of people disliked the talent trees back in the day. People disliked having to respec talents to change specs, and didn't like having to research optimal cookie cutter builds. There was a push since vanilla to make dual spec available and make a lot of 'mandatory' talents baseline. Thing is Blizzard actually listened over the years and made these changes.
---
What's funny is I also remember a lot of slippery slope counter-arguments like "why limit it to dual spec then, just let them respec whenever they want then" which actually happened but at the time was met with criticism that it's a poor argument and would never happen.
---
There are a bunch of people on my server lining the AH with it for 1k gold so I’ll take this pricing any day.
---
I saw that yesterday and tried but it seems I was too late.
---
I'm not sure, every other language (French, English, Spanish) in the EU zone had 48% Ally and 52% Horde, while for Russians, it's 67% Ally, 33% Horde, overall.
---
I have no idea why that is, but it's an insane discrepancy.
---
There has to be some reason that explains it, there's no way it "just  happened".
---
Aye.
---
As a rogue, I'm curious to when distracting patrols is needed. Only time I've done it is before pulls to gain a little more drinking/eating time before facing them.
---
If a pat is going to aggro onto the group during a fight, should I vanish and distract them or something?
---
Yeah exactly
---
Dude if the tank is going "full on berserk", that sounds like a whiner.
---
“If you weren’t this kinda loser, you would just a different kind of loser”..
---
Yep.. what an amazing perspective.
---
Hunter outdamages other ranged DPS in t1 content. They just don't scale well.
---
Why do you HAVE to be 60 and HAVE to be geared by the launch of Phase 2? 
---
That's my question.
---
I love them too.
---
the blackrock part is already the way it is now tho
---
Mount &gt; Mind Soothe imo but to each their own
---
"so much time left" at the current accelerated phase rate, naxx will be out in August to funnel people to shadowlands. Ext December. There really isn't.
---
Idk why you got downvoted for explaining chest drops lmao. You’re right
---
Fo ur to leave
---
Level 48 resto shammy here. Is phase 2 really gonna be as bad as everyone says? Is it time for me to live in dungeons?
---
Think he meant 30.
---
I think they got worse over those xpacs. 10 more points, 2 more tiers down each tree that take 10 pointa. You just follow the obvious path made for each spec. With the bottom tier abilities being so obviously good you just had to go for them.
---
What made specs interesting was the mix ones, and all the off kilter talents that could set you apart, but after classic blizzard did their best to stamp them out. Prep/adrenaline rush nerfed, frost/unholy DK nerfed, ret/holy nerfed.
---
It became so much more cookies cutter over time. I'd rather the talent trees filled out empty spots than keep going down.
---
A resto druid.
---
This is in fact how I paid for my mount.
---
Have you used the book in steamwheedle port? It's supposed to be in one of the huts, named "soothsaying for dummies".
---
I use shield slam on big packs and I really like being able to get a huge lead in threat with just one ability, allowing me to use sunder on the others and giving me a bit of time before I have to go back to the one I used ss on.
---
I tried both deep prot and fury prot and shield slam was the thing I missed the most (with tactical masterie). Shield slam is way better than 2 sunder imo
---
Sounds like you don't understand the game very well then. There are absolutely many pieces of gear in classic that don't fit the "traditional" armor type for a class, but are best in slot piece of gear. There is 0 reason for a raiding rogue to get priority over a raiding warrior on leather, if they're both best in slot pieces. 
---
You're going to see many warriors in leather, pallies in cloth, etc.
---
All of the above, but you need to make sure you keep a healthy sum of Stam.
---
I haven’t seen any of it yet but I believe it’s mostly Alliance that RPs. On RPPVP severs you basically have to look for it to see any, which is fine by me, I don’t RP
---
What do you mean by unacceptable? It's unacceptable only if you refuse to accept it and express it by canceling your subscription, right? That's the only way to affect Blizzard, by voting with your wallet.
---
Yeah I guess the whole game was a bit of a mess. Hopefully the get it right from the start. I liked the rift system at first and leader boards for it, but yeah it was very much the same after a while. Which the game had no monthly fees or DLCs every other month I suppose.
---
His ass
---
Yeah. Works great in deadmines and Stockades.  Not so much in Scarlet monastery where you cant pull 20+ mobs without actually dying.
---
And running SM 100+ times to get from 30-40 is mindnumbing and will make you go crazy.
---
Very easy,  there's a general spec called HoTW/NS (heart of the wild/natures swiftness) that is the best general hybrid spec in the game, really only need separate gear depending on which role you need to fill,  no respec required.
---
This is true . I wouldnt of been there doing it if battlegrounds was a thing
---
Good points - it’s hilarious though when I see “LF3M, need tank heals and DPS, HoJ reserved” or something. When you have less than 50% of a group and are missing two of the harder slots to fill, yeah it’s way easier to just start your own group without that BS. I wouldn’t want to group with somebody reserving in a PUG regardless, and it’s so much easier to just start a group.
---
I absolutely notice them but it doesn’t ruin the server. They actively do try to ruin it though lol
---
Yeah, scourging through wowhead looking for different +hit on gear plate tought me that their is not much. I'm going to try to got \~380 def and 3-4 +hit, with sword and my human racial I should be good. 
---
Plus my guild is more casual side so not so much chasing ultra BIS. Hell we even have a boomkin and some retadin but we have fun
---
Shit on
---
Skeram is similar but maybe not quite as bad. It really does suck. 
---
I mean, you get a glimpse into how fun things *could be*, such as when you're demolished when entering BRM every time. You can appreciate how fun it could be if things were more balanced, and sometimes BRM would be horde controlled, and other times it would be alliance controlled.
---
But when it's 100% horde controlled, it fucking sucks.
---
"Dyslexics untie" is genius.
---
No it wouldn't. It might make things easier or reduce the effort required to respec but it wouldn't make the talent tree itself any more or less complicated.
---
If they’re running an eviscerate will probably kill them, However i assume the rogue has no combo points for either
---
doesnt matter about comparison of servers clients or tech when the the end service is worse than what illegal private servers can offer for free.
---
Warlocks- Anyone have a lightweight add on that will give some sort of visual indication when Nightfall/Shadow Trance procs? My Combat scrolling text indicates when Riposte procs on my rogue, but for some reason doesn’t flash when I get a nightfall proc
---
I think it is, I don’t think everyone is going to have the same experience, I think much fewer people are going to have the expected negative experience the thought prior, and I also think that what will make the fame bad for one person might not make it bad for everyone.  
---
People are trying to hype this so hard but let’s be real - the game isn’t going to change much phase 2.
---
/cast Conjure Gold
---
As a healer I like having rogues in my group they can be helpful.
---
I've never seen the bracers below 1000g on my server, I would definitely take them at that. That's an evening of farming DM.
---
The 3 piece bonus isn't great, but it's definitely helpful when soloing PvE and in some situations in MC. 
---
However, the 8 piece bonus is a massive upgrade and can last you until Naxx so missing a single piece is a huge deal. I would highly recommend getting your hands on any pieces you can, especially at that price. It would really suck to be missing 1 piece and not be able to find it.
---
And rank 3 heal is thr most mana rfficient spot heal right?
---
It’s the gnome mages these days
---
Shenna didn't develop shit. It was Viper and Daemon who developed the private server core that was used up until Classic's launch.
---
Last night we saw Giantstalker Shoulders, Chest, Gloves, Belt for sure. I don't know what else. 
---
Last week we saw Shoulder, Helmet, Belt, Bracers, and I don't remember what else. 
---
It's totally out of hand. That's what people expect when they see me with Quel'serar and my T2 helmet, but almost everything else is still blue. Fortunately I got my T1 shoulders, so I'm at least a spiky boy.
---
I'm a shadow priest (which is my fault, yes) and I've just accepted the fact that I'm just not really gonna gear up because there are no set pieces, and I'll be rolling against every single caster for anything I CAN use.
---
Yeah that should work, as long as the tank has any threat at all (which is not a given, if they got fireballed recently and didn't hit the boss for some reason).
---
You have to run the gauntlet. Make damn sure you grab the Kargath flight path.
---
Well this made me decide that I am going to leave my level 38 priest behind on blaumeux and rise from the ashes as the undead warlock, former priest and fellow future destroyer of all capitalism — serphucalot... grobs freshest piece of decaying meat bone.
---
True but they have proven large scale world pvp doesn't always devolve into a giant lagfest.
---
Yeah sometimes I get bored killing you and your friends and have to switch it up. Watch your six! :)
---
I feel like rogues and tanks go hand and hand. 
---
I always keep an eye on a tanks health as a rogue. Sometimes a kidney shot to help a healer get some heals caught up is better than an eviscerate. 
---
I cringe for the tank when I see ranged DPS open up when a tank is trying to LOS pull or even just gather mobs. 
---
I always appreciate a great tank !
---
How much gold per hour is this? How long to clear sfk as a 60 , assuming it's a 60
---
Thank you for the math! I don’t know any of the background numbers in this game.  
---
I had one DPS in particular that was eating away at my mana, and on top of that I seemed to be the prime target for everything lol
---
Activision Blizzard servers get worse every year.
---
Korobar the Human Paladin needs a guild!!
---
They are horrible. Currently, hunter DPS is top-3, right behind warrior and rogue (so top-1 for ranged-favored fights).
---
I postponed meeting a girl for drinks, so I could raid. Well to be fair, it was mostly because there was a football game I wanted to watch. I'll schedule her this week on a non-raid night. #priorities
---
It’s a power play. Undead Rogues like to feel the rush of power by juggling someone else’s life in their hands. They have the ability to save or kill you. They’re nearly as evil as Gnomes. Gnomes feel no pleasure in saving a victim.
---
Not true, pvp with daggers are really fun and strong. See grim, rup, etc...
---
Well it's optimized for retail. Doesn't look like their doing much to optimize classic servers.
---
Yeah, I've already switched, and I'm already 300 Goblin Engineering with all recipes learned. It's just that I don't have the membership card, and I don't have a way to check when mine's up for renewal because I don't have a membership card of either kind of engineering.
---
Because if you manage something under the hope people will freely choose the best option for the game, you fucked up. 
---
You manage to what you expect players to do, you don't pray they make the 'right' choices to manage your game for you. And Blizzard could reasonably have expected the damaging transfer behavior they enabled.
---
Not noob to god but my hunter friend started 2-3 weeks ago hit 51 this week pet classes that are played competently level quick.
---
Retail
---
If you'd read my post, you would see that purification affects only base heal, not +heal. Its value diminishes as your +healing increases. Your random estimate maths doesn't work. 
---
Healing way isn't relevant when shamans should be raid healing with chain heal. Using them as tank healers is a waste, priests are far superior for this, and you're bringing a decent number of priests because as Horde they are your only dispellers.
---
For your second point, no, not really. That only works if the people playing the healers have DPS characters to switch to. You really don't want to be messing around with raid composition on every encounter - it's best to try and bring a static raid team. Otherwise you will end up using gear upgrades in a sub-optimal fashion. And talking about 'superior' and 'inferior' and these tiny margins is only relevant for progression. Now you're changing it to clear times and farming raids. Once content is cleared you can drop healers for DPS to clear faster, that's a choice. You can also let healers drop from the absolute min-max healing output to something that lets them do other content. That's another choice. Your idea of making healers all be 100% pure resto, not doing anything else, and once content is on farm they're benched, sounds awful frankly and I wouldn't join any guild you organise!
---
Don't move goalposts mid-discussion, define your comparative terms clearly, and read what has already been stated rather than ignoring it.
---
yeah i have looted chests with no greens in them. i assumed like chests were better in instances or something
---
I had no clue what the picture was
---
Damn that goes for like 250g on my server
---
What's your level? I hit 60 like 2 weeks ago and I've been having a blast just tanking dungeons from lvl 55 or so. You get the occasional bad group but those tend to fall apart. People have been nice mostly and if they're newbies they tend to listen.
---
Since I was a newbie as well people often helped me with pulls and such, sometimes even pulled because they were impatient but that's fine if you're ready for it and are new to the dungeon.
---
I use this. Not use if pickpocket is one or two words. It works better if you are not moving and you need auto loot on. Sometimes you don't auto loot the pickpocket fast enough but then the pick pocket loot is added to the corpse at the end.

This is me with like 7 or 8 alts but my main is level 55, can’t decide lmao
---
Good idea. Ignore the replies about having a job and playing. That's completely different than looking for a job. When you have a job, easier to tear away from the game and work. 
---
Without a job, hard to tear away and spend the hours needed to find a job. So quit wow, go all in finding a job, then come back to wow with balance once you find one. /my 2 cents
---
That guy already has no life.
---
Ah, got it, thanks.
---
Is there an add-on to show incoming heals?  I think I have seen streamers with it.
---
This is with everything though. You'll always have people using a word out of context which lessons the meaning of the saying. That is why you get people moving to new phrases or sayings often because many words lose their impact due to overuse or loss of meaning.
---
It's still useful, at least currently, when the context makes sense.
---
Its a huge difference
---
My buddy just got approved to switch to Sub and he even went into Hemo/Ghostly Strike. It took a bit of convincing but the convinced the guild leader that Hemo debuff should be Prio over a warlock we had that was using Corruption. His damage had been fine. Not as high but still near the top of the raid.
---
Now he can gold farm and PvP but still is a sword rogue
---
It's good for mages and warlocks. I'm not sure about priests. For shadow priests I guess it's good, they have the same item stat prio I think.
---
I'm sure he's drying his tears with $100 bills.
---
or the gold to do that constantly till it pays out... but i wont tage 300g to have profit in 3 months
---
Just roll Mc is too easy
---
does adibags do the value stuff too, or is that a different auction mod?
---
Is there an add on that I can grab that will check my hit %? Will it show what my weapon skill contributes?
---
Honestly, that will probably happen for a few weeks at Southshore/Tarren Mill.  The towns are so close to each other, it's a perfect storm.
---
But... But... Muh memes!
---
So you have 13spi 33 heal vs 9spi 15 heal and 14 int.
---
+4 spi +18 heal at the cost of 14 int.
---
I'm no paladin expert but I'm thinking those numbers are definitely in the realm of sidegrades.
---
&gt;I can't wait for when the server will literally crash upon receiving onyxia buff,and you're not able to log back in due to queues.
---
because the servers are cheaper or they didn't think of this outcome. I'm fairly certain blizz did very little pserver research into player behaviourl.
---
I main a pve raider. But I have a pvp alt. Leveling is like x6 slower
---
yea you can save lots of bandwidth if you make your connection prone to be exploited by cheaters
---
While I would argue your first point, I would agree that furyprot is not at all required at this stage. That said, I currently use furyprot mostly because it makes solo life so much better and my threat is quite excellent. I wear only plate and I am hit capped (6% 305 skill) and have 22% crit in defensive sance. It took a long time to get to this point, and for a while I was making my healers work harder, though every time I offered to respec to deep prot, or throw on plate, they said that it made it too boring. I think I have really cool healers, so that might be it.
---
No new talent at 60, the last one's at 50, instead covenants replace the 50-60 progression (another case of borrowed power, it sounds like).
---
Check the fire elementals in arathi highlands. Easy to kill for even healers and drop elemental fire which sells nicely. It is camped a bit but might be free in the middle of the night.
---
Two dudes in a basement do have the attacker number that all Blizzard servers do. It's not apples to apples. The security that Blizzard has to have on all of their servers is a good deal of overhead that private servers likely wouldn't have.
---
No idea if that is the reason for lag or not, just pointing out there may be other factors like an[other] ongoing DDoS.
---
I thought you wanted no changes?!?
---
&gt;optimal raid comp shifts to include more casters
---
AKA mages.
---
What server do you play? Was that guy a rogue with epic dagger? I introduced my friend to wow classic, he lvling by himself as I'm already 60 and raiding do can't help him a lot. He was and still is inexperienced. He tried new locations being under lvl, I gave him gut ripper epic dagger when he got to lvl 40 and now he is around 57. He did pretty good job lvling actually.
---
Haven't been in high school for over a decade, so I can't directly relate to his statistics class he's in right now. Never claimed my math was spot on or correct, but it's not dramatically off by any means.

I'm currently having a blast with Hunter, and honestly pets are the best part. They allow you to level without taking almost any damage, I can comfortably kill mobs 4+ levels above me, and in pvp or pve vs caster mobs, there's a ton of spell disrupt of you get a fast AT pet. If you put some comfy keybinds (I use mouse wheel up/down) for attack/follow, having a pet becomes an extremely useful tool.

hemo affects all melee right?

Arrrrr

BiS OH is from a lvl 56 elite quest in Ungoro...
---
If your goal is to be "wanted" in a dungeon group, you should roll a warrior DPS. They are in the highest demands. That said, its hard to find raid spots as a tank, since you only need 2-3 of those for every raid.
---
Healers are abundant in dungeons but really needed in raids for example. But if your sole need is to be wanted in dungeons, go for a warrior tank.
---
Keep playing your druid. Go Hotw/ns spec (0/30/21), heal raids, tank dungeons. You won't top any charts but you're super valuable in a guild and its tons of fun.
---
Alright so I realize my post couple of posts in this thread have been on the brusque side, and I'm bringing this up so as to say that this post I am being more sincere. &gt;!I just did a weed so I'm feeling friendlier.!&lt;
---
Do y'all have an actual  source on population numbers for the private server? I will admit that I've never been a private server guy, only fucked around with em a couple times, for maybe a week at most.
---
Small indie company
---
Not worth it for exp no. But 100% chance on getting the gear you actually roll on is worth a bit of extra time.
---
Phones about to die but will write. A detailed response message me if I don’t within the next few hours :)
---
To you and /u/Soulaxer:
---
Contact Microsoft, they're really easy to work with on this kind of thing. Linus Tech Tips did a video about it because they're swapping out motherboards all the time for their tests and videos so they have this problem often and said that it was a pretty effortless process.
---
What the fuck are you even trying to say? Naxx in march
---
Ok
---
What if you have both?
---
Holy shit... 400g? I wish it sold for that on my server. I've only seen 2 on the AH in the past 3 weeks, the first sold for 2000g, the second for over 1500g. 400g I could manage. But even as I save up for 1500g, theres no guarantee one will actually be on the AH. Its just been absurdly rare on our server.
---
Lvl 60 mage with tailoring and skinning. Any suggestions on how to farm gold for my epic mount?
---
If you take into account 8h of sleep, there are still 4h of life.
---
Yeah, he says in a raid the debuff pops up and immediately disappears, implying each Hemo is adding X damage to the raid Vs the warlock’s corruption being Y. I guess he was convincing enough.
---
Keep in mind I’m in a guild that doesn’t enforce a meta, we have a boomkin and an Ele so other guilds May not tolerate it. But his literal damage has been fine
---
i came back because the game was better back then, not because i wanted to see **old shit**
---
Grobb is awesome,  the small portion of players that frequent the subreddit are the ones way more concerned with drama than the game.  That being said,  just roll horde and camp the racist alliance losers with the rest of the server.
---
No thanks
---
Most raid frame addons should have heal predictions, just gotta make sure every other healer in your raid is using compatible ones (which they all should be as long as they've been updated recently).
---
&gt;Nobody had any bags
---
Speak for yourself :D i had three 6 slot bags before leaving the level 6 area :D
---
Prior to BGs, maybe.  The scale of what you have to do to accomplish R14 cannot be done by just kill trading.   You get the maximum honor from a 60 with the highest rank for the first kill of the day.  After each kill, the honor drops until after kill 4, you get 0 honor from it.  You'd literally need to kill trade raids of players to even come close to what people are going to get farming BRD.  It's not even a contest at that point.  And if you are kill trading at the raid level, just fucking fight, you'll have more fun.
---
It was the Serenity Now funeral raid.  No I don't remember other names.
---
It's about a 50-60% dps increase excluding consumables. The difference increases with consumables because crit scales better the more spell power you have and vice versa.
---
people quoting higher figures is because they're not controlling for all variables. You also have to normalize for crit RNG, hit% rng, consumables, raid buffs, etc.
---
Go into ZF and farm the graveyard.
---
I know this post is from a month ago but I would like to give it the kiss of life, now that phase 2 is announced and I would also like to pursue a tri-spec.
---
I was set on a tri-spec that was 17/13/21 (imp manaburn/ blessed recovery/ silence) until some conversation brought up that blessed recovery (at least right now in classic) get's overwritten by the next crit, so if you get white hit auto attack crit, it will overwrite the damage from the let's say, mortal strike crit.
---
So now I want to tweak it and would like to discuss some of the potential options.
---
**Usefulness of Spell Warding in the Holy Tree :**
---
Is the flat damage reduction offered by this talent more useful than putting points in Disc? (like Mental Agility)
---
**Shadow Reach vs Points in Weaving:**
---
In order to try and reach Silence, there are two abilities here that we can try and pick up, however, I've seen a mixed bag for reach and weaving. Wouldn't we want weaving as a bloat dispel item? 
---
**Imp Shadow Word Pain:**
---
I remember reading a long time ago that by adding more ticks, the damage per tick decreases, even though the over all damage increases. (this is due to the spell power bonus being spread over a longer time frame rather than the shorter duration), In PvP wouldn't we still want more damage "upfront" and considering how quick some fights are, the longer duration wouldn't be helpful.
---
Let me know your thoughts.
---
Pshh amateur, I talked my way out of getting laid on a tinder date because "I had a headache" so she would leave my apartment so I could play classic.
---
&gt; but the damage is so low (compared to the pure DPS classes) 
---
better than warlocks. Actually can do well in short fights/with infinite resources (Vael).
---
Personally I think leveling is a terrible experience, the game starts at 60 for me. Leveling is just a chore, I don't want to do it again.
---
Disheartning
---
I... need to try this. I'm fury/prot, so I have a hit capped plate armor set for the harder hitting bosses, and my priest friend is really good. Thank you for the idea, and double thanks for the idea to bring death grips!
---
Not arguing that but if one is doing a lava run grabbing these are like 1 pull away and they are stil very solid
---
but battlegrounds are not on the horizon :S
---
Healcomms. In order to see others heals they need the addon as well though, but it will show your own heals at least.
---
Running all the way from undercity would be faster than trying to reach badlands from STV at 38 I'm pretty sure.
---
Advertise a BRD quest run and just see how far you can get.
---
Because it's not possible. They are tons of exploit that have been exposed over the years which where available on pservers.
---
They should have rework the old one but it's not feasible on the same time-line and require way more work.
---
I do think it's about money bot not sure about servers cost
---
MT takes priority, always. Your OT is a tool that gets you loot. Your raid is a tool that gets you loot. The bench is a tool that supplies your raid. Everyone's job is to follow orders and allow you to MT content. Don't listen to this crying children that think any part of this is unfair. What's unfair is slowing your progress to a crawl, making everyone else unable to see the content. As the MT, you're also the billboard for your guild. When someone sees you hanging around in town, they'll know how good your guild is.
---
My advice would be to use some initiative and try harder.
---
Recently I've focused on mindlessly farming DME on my healing priest because I need gold, and I'll watch LFG and world the entire time to see if there's a group that needs a healer for a dungeon that I want to run, and sometimes I'll go an hour without seeing any spot for me.
---
If you really want a dungeon, start a group, ask all your friends, ask your guildies, be funny/ make your message stand out a bit, /who x class you want and copy + paste a nice message to recruit them. It takes a lot more effort than just waiting to see a group you want that needs you, but it is WAY quicker. 
---
I use these methods on my 60, and also on my 36 alt, and it's very effective. I suggest networking yourself more. When you find good party members, don't stay quiet and just leave when done. Be friendly, add people to friends, stay in regular contact. You will run dungeons you want, whenever you want, if you put in the effort with some/all of the things I suggest.
---
There's also the fact that Blackguard is not obtainable until phase 5. Same with Ebon Hand.
---
Yes.  It was worse.
---
Depends on the class.  Empty 14 slot bags, Level 60 mage, you looting yourself you can prob do it in 15-20 mins depending on how big of pulls you do.  Ive ran it around 15 times and have zero blue BOE drops and have been making around 5-8g a run.
---
What is better for a UD Combat daggers spec.
---
Barman Shanker x Distracting Dagger or Bonescraper x Distracting Dagger .
---
Low rage is a good reason, because you are losing DPS when doing OP with 90 rage. That 65 rage couldve gone into HS/Cleaves or BTs/WWs.
---
It really is not minor, because due to the lowish amount of crit, it's harder to keep flurry up 100%.
---
Can't get ony head, songflower is always picked, therefore overpower is a good way to trigger crits to trigger flurry.
---
Why exactly are you increasing the miss by going back or am I missing something? Genuinely curious.
---
For cat dps, horde should use rune of the guard captain and blackhands bredth. If you take the tanking trinket mark of tyranny, then you use hoj and rune.
---
I think my guild will be ok with me going hemo what I'm concern about is my damage output because of the loss of 5% hit and 5 weapon skill from combat.
---
Can you raid?  Yes.  Will you be "ok" enough for the raid to clear MC, sure we did MC our first week with like 26 people, so some guy dragging ass isn't a problem.  Will you be good? No.
---
TY !
---
Do you think something like this is good? not too hard to obtain with a solid group of 5 : [https://sixtyupgrades.com/set/kvLf8LPU2GEocLTZoP7wAb](https://sixtyupgrades.com/set/kvLf8LPU2GEocLTZoP7wAb)
---
UBRS is easily doable as a 5 man through Rend...after the rend encounter the pulls get dicey for a 5 man. Emberseer is cake with five but you do have to play a little smarter. GL!
---
Unfortunately our smaller than expected number of deaths while leveling won't be able to appease your recommended salt intake :D
---
I had no idea what bad luck was until I saw the threat on here about the guy who finally got Savage Gladiator Chest on his 670th some odd arena run...
---
I truly am an amateur.
---
Meh even under this circumstance it will still require months on end of brain churning grinding.... fuck that shit.
---
No.
---
After how bad the launch was the very least they can do is give us a few days of free open transfers (even if they limit the factions to keep a balance). My friend group is either all over the place in terms of servers or have quit because of how the launch went. And no one is willing to start from level 1 again.
---
I agree those weren't the most serious issues. But the gameplay affects the tone. Yes, there's corpses and blood, but the way the game plays prevents any sort of "horror" feel. It's fast paced, flashy, easy (for the first 20+ hours anyway), and the MMO elements are really in-your-face. You're looking at constant colorful explosions, damage numbers, and shiny loot and ignoring the beautifully grim artwork in the backround.
---
It *never* hurts to use frost trap. And immolation trap is great for bigger pulls. Drop a trap at the tank's feet or in the way of where the enemies will be pulled to. But the immolation trap goes at the tank's feet since it adds to your aggro.
---
I am sure the server software has improvements from more than 300 different people and is in constant development for over 10 years. As Vanilla is not getting any additional content all the pserver community did is improve performance and fix bugs.  
---
I believe blizzard would be able to fix this but the money/work is obviously spent elsewhere e.g implementing the newest iteration of titan forging
---
They aren't ever coming?
---
it was for bnet integration i think,  isnt hard to hotfix exploits
---
We are the dominant faction, and we intend to celebrate phase 2 on a most glorious way.
---
they are but they aren't on the horizon yet
---
You have bigger crits with a slower weapon
---
FUCK I just finished those quests and it was the biggest pain in the ass running back and forth
---
Yeah that would be a huge loss in DPS. I’m not sure exactly the spec my buddy is running but it’s definitely not skipping out on Hit
---
Not but maybe youll then see that youre doing something wrong when you undercut that much
---
NugEnergy
---
It's a Pi Hole, PaniqFTW answered the question for me.
---
It's 5.5% for 61 and 6% for 62.
---
Just remembered this, no idea if it affects the classic servers or not, but back in I think cata or mop they changes how the servers process things to reduce latency by 2 or 3x. I imagine this increased the processing load on the servers.
---
Pi Hole.
---
I never disagree with that, just explaining some of the reasons why. 
---
Actually we don't have any Intel on how its implemented or what kind or servers are used, so it's just speculating. 
---
Just wanted to give my guts on the matter which is that the integration of classic in the retail client was a mistake and probably what cause this weird issue. The Vanilla client is more optimized than the Integrated classic. 
---
My take is that they could run old vanilla like a breaze with those server but not the new classic version.
---
Co-efficients 
---
Derating

Bigger numbers

Zugzug

I would say Barman. You should aim to pick up Darrowspike from the Scholo quest.
---
It sounds like your technical knowledge starts and ends with turning on a computer.
---
This would be a large scale operation that would take many weeks if not months
---
I believe most of the bosses in MC will be immune to the DOT.
---
Dam Horde.
---
if you want higher chances of getting a dungeon group then play from 5-9 local time, people are off work and more people on
---
Yes, thats what I said, you get triggered.
---
Not correct. Close enough for WoW logs to detect them.
---
Any halfway decent healer has already started casting their heals before you need it. This is not an unassailable difficulty.
---
was it not a few years ago? I'm sorry, must have messed up the dates
---
Thank you
---
Alliance don't have WF, fury spec only really has whirlwind which wouldn't be used while tanking.  Also a faster 2h would mean more consistent threat generation.
---
are you on Blaumeux? he's been there for days dude.
---
Rip. We were having it our a 40v40 I'd guess on thunderfurry last night and it was smooth as butter.  Poor horde were not allowed in BRD lmao.
---
Oh yes we do RP, as a sample

Some of the other events i partake in with the guild  and joint venture guilds, there are no words to explain how much fun and enjoyable they make "not playing the game" lmao, there are times i don't get xp for days becasue of all the rp, so much more to this game than just leveling.
---
No you dont, this game is built off speed coefficients just like SP/+HEALING based on the speed of a cast.
---
You could say this about the auction addons, threat addons too yet everyone is fine with those.
---
The lag is as important for your "Vanilla experience" as the world Bosses.       
---
At least the Server don't Crash completly like Back then.
---
Ok dude. People have different priorities. A kid is top priority for some and bottom of the list of others. Don't go around policing other people's way of life.
---
You tried carebear, you tried lol
---
I bet my ele sham would rip a mage up :)
---
Best argument I have see for this reasoning
---
Could use WA2 to set that up. Dunno if you consider it to be lightweight.
---
Never played a rogue before classic and had no idea you could do this until yesterday.
---
&gt; a lot of players would love to see classic expanded into TBC
---
and they could easily still have that option alongside the new content
---
if you want to see new shit, transfer your character to a plus server. if you want to see old shit, move to a TBC one
---
like the OP said, it takes almost zero effort for them to spin up TBC shit for people
---
Am i just expecting too much from this reddit?  If it's not a meme post about an icon that looks like a parrot, no one cares?  Is that what i'm getting here?
---
this legit made me lol. rare insults material.
---
Also, let's appreciate that you're still pretending to not be triggered while saying this.
---
&gt;but things in the later half of the video scare me a bit
---
I have some pserver experience and let me tell you - that\`s EXACTLY what\`s going to happen.
---
personally I use [sixtyupgrades](https://sixtyupgrades.com/character/avgMEYH13Vpj8QJMt6JqQq/sets/new) as source for statweights
---
it says: 
---
healing: 1
---
spell damage: 1
---
intellect: 1
---
spell crit chance: 20
---
mana per 5sec: 3
---
I don't know if it's reliable
---
Rogue mate :)
---
if tons of other 60s are there then yeah id go there. otherwise ill just be running around wpl and epl farming herbs and killing allies as i see them, like i do now except i ignore allies besides enclave atm.
---
When you join a group and they want to do a jump run or tribute run, ask what you have to watch out for and do what they say. I did the same on my first tribute run, never did one before, I stayed back and did the same what the others did. No problem.
---
This is really normal for wow in general. Greater magic wands are used to level up enchanting. As such greater magic wands have a really high supply that is independent of the actual demand.
---
Awesome ty. I assume you can only so this 5 times a day before you're locked out of resets?
---
Damn can't unsee now lol.
---
2h tanking doesn't make sense so threat gen is irrelevant. 2 swords means double threat
---
Classics talent tree is worse than BC AND wotlk and prolly cata.
---
60 Holy priest here. With P2 hitting next week, i am getting nervous because i am 21/31/0 due to being the best healpriest in my raid grp. How can i best survive or be a helpful hand in PVP? No silence and not much dps is making me sweat my pants...
---
fish pools in classic get exhausted right? 
---
you cant sit on the same spot for 4 hours like on live?
---
addons good, news at 11
---
here you go
---
LOL it’s not like blizzard could be doing this for 2 month already because they literally always give all information out right away.
---
I know it probably isn’t true but it is very possible :p you talking about technical knowledge actually made me laugh ty 😂
---
Some short notes about other DPS classes in a group setting:
---
Warlocks have Soulstones, summon, curses and Banish
---
Mages have AoE, sheep, and free drinks/water
---
Shamans have a ress, buffing totems and off-heals (as dps). The same can be said about Paladins and their great buffs.
---
I don't see many druids queued as DPS, but their off-healing as feral is way better than Enhancement Shamans and Shadow Priests imo. Battle Ress is nice too. 
---
Warriors wear plate.
---
Hunters have... eh, freezing trap. They are also ranged dps. 
---
Priests can, kinda, swap out of Shadowform and off-heal in a pinch. They can also ress.
---
Rogues as you might know don't bring much to the table regarding group play. They can off-tank a single target with stunlock, evasion and other cooldowns, however a dps warrior will off-tank even better (and for the first 59 levels is in the same gear and spec as the tank, lol).
---
I play on a PvP server but I just wanted to say that to trigger you more kek
---
I’m level 54 sitting at about 300g (warlock mount is cheaper). I’m going to be pvping a lot at 60. Since pvp consumables are not cheap and I still have to lvl engineering, are there any suggestions for making gold while leveling, specifically these last few levels? Any certain grinding spots, etc? I’m also 270 tailoring
---
Not every rogue needs to get perd blade man. You have viskag brutality blade cht etc
---
Goals while questing include trying to convince the priest that I actually died and it's not a random feign death.
---
If you have an appropriate amount of hit, rage generation should be higher dual wielding, allowing you to pull more threat. Honestly though tanking with a fast 2H is probably not bad in like a dungeon or something
---
You know what? You're right. Using *epidemic* to describe it was not a good choice. I took the word the first time it was used and ran with it. This whole discussion we're having distracts from what I am trying to accomplish. An anonymous do-gooder found the topic so interesting they wrote to the NYT. Hopefully they want to take it and gather better data than "it is a widespread issue".
---
lol second 60 *stares at my main at lvl 46*
---
Its 5 times an hour, and you wont do 5 runs in an hour anyway, so just grind on.
---
You don't even need to activate windows, all you have to do is run a script that gets rid of the watermark. I was told it wasn't permanent but I ran the script over a year ago and haven't had a watermark since.
---
You can still catch them without landing in the pool
---
Yeah sure you do carebear, lol
---
Yeah. I think you should have around 6200 to farm them comfortably. You can do it with less if you do single pack pulls and cycle Power Infusion/Inner Focus on every other pack, but that will be much slower. Probably a good idea to buy or farm some +int gear and maybe buy a few Elixir of Greater Intellect, if your gear doesn't reach all the way, if you can get them cheap.
---
I always take rogues over warriors in dungeons,  they're more useful.  But there are a metric fuccton of rogues and I do my best to avoid duplicates when filling my groups.
---
Yeah, that wouldn't be too bad, although there's a few pieces that are good to obtain that I think would heavily outperform some of your listed items. 
---
1. Mirah's Song over Dal'rend, for a 1h weapon it's pretty hard to beat Mirah's Song as pre-raid unless you get lucky with something like Ironfoe. Not to mention you've actually selected the off-hand Dal'rend, which you can't use with a shield anyway. 
---
2. Replace the Deathbone Gauntlets with Voone's Vice Grips. Almost irreplaceable for a tank's pre-raid in my opinion. 
---
3. Replace Deathbone Legguards with Warmaster's Legguards. You get more offensive stats for threat, combined with the same dodge chance. 
---
4. Replace Shalehusk Boots with the Ribsteel Footguards or w/e they're called. You lose the dodge but gain some nice offensive stats. 
---
5. Finally, I'd probably replace Mark of Tyranny with Mark of the Chosen if you're going to be a MT. The proc on that thing is almost constant, because it's got a minute duration, and I think the +25 to all stats will outperform the 1% dodge in the long run. 
---
I tried to list them in the order I thought most important, so if you're unsure of which to prioritize, I'd just work your way down the list. Shalehusk and Mark of Tyranny would both work, I just think there's some relatively easy to obtain options that would be better. Other than that I think you'd be just fine to MT an MC with that gear.
---
Hey it’s Freshfish! Blameaux represent! A true hero of the Horde.
---
I think they would have to allow template lvl 60 or 55 characters for tbc to make sure there is enough population.
---
Most people use them in BGs primarily.  I’ve had some fun with my 29 rogue and 39 lock in wPvP though.  
---
Yes though, explicitly pvp only, you don’t want xp as a completed twink so you avoid a lot of other activities.
---
Oh, you're probably right! Thanks
---
Paladins dominate in raid progression and premade BGs.  We’ll have all the realm first final boss kills on the next phases.  We’ll have instant queues and our rankers will cut thru you like a hot knife.
---
Shaman are fun, and they can throw lightning and purge, but they don’t compare at all to paladins in group content.
---
Get used to it. &lt;- Official Blizzard Response. It's been like this since Vanilla. Can retail servers even handle 200-300 people?
---
World PvP has never been something you can really sink your teeth into beyond some scattered fights in the wilderness.
---
Carebear detected.
---
Kill alts until they switch to mains, than kill mains.
---
As an undead rogue who hit 60 just a few weeks ago, I always tried to help Alliance players I saw struggling while leveling. 
---
Motivation: It was equal parts trying to be a bro, but also self preservation. Me helping you hopefully makes you less likely to push my shit in. Didn't always work.
---
Stacka of Squid go for about 7g on Skeram. Usually the best moneymaker I've found.
---
most rend/jed farm groups aren't 10 man they're 5 6 7
---
o u got me I actually only play Asherons Call
---
Oh sure, there's stuff that could be done but don't confuse Blizz/Activision with people who would.
---
Then it comes down to the DPS and rage increase from dual wielding compared to a 2hander and rage generation in execute phase. 
---
Fast 2H is still inferior to double daggers.
---
What are the prices for essentials like elixir of the mongoose and greater fire pots?
---
The server performance will never get better, unless people start a riot.
---
Blizzard is a publicly traded company. Literally nobody at the high paid decision making positions at Acti. Blizzard cares about you people and your lag. They care about turning a profit for the investers in the company. They do that by spending as little money as possible on the product. This is the result.
---
I ran from STV. Right after you go through BRD you make a right and go straight.
---
I know right what a filthy casual
---
Just like every dumb meme does.
---
Raiding schedule? Takes like 3 hours to finish every raid out .
---
&gt;warriors wear plate, and I don't care what anyone says on that one
---
Tell that to whoever designed vanilla plate stats, unfortunately
---
Honestly OP it's extremely hard to parse from your post that you're specifically asking why Fury tanks don't use 2H, and that's why you're having a hard time getting replies to the question you mean to ask.
---
Except alliance has better access to BRN which you’ll be spending waaaaay more hours in then those low level dungeons.
---
Nobody asked you lol.
---
Has Blizzard ever acknowledged this problem? I remember back during development they gave us some assurance that the lag problems in BFA were due to the more complicated spell effects of BFA, so they wouldn't be a problem in classic. What's going on? Did nobody get to ask a question about this at Blizzcon?
---
"But you can't be Arms spec if your raiding. You can only have 16 debuffs, and MS is not wanted."
---
Bullshit. This is only stands for hardcore nolifer progression maniac guilds who will drop the game the instant they cleared Naxx.
---
Always blame something other than your skill. Am I right!?

To accomplish that make sure you take damage and make your timing believable! As a priest, I always see through the feign. I spent most of my BC raiding on a hunter :-p

Could probably be done quicker if your paying attention and doing bigger pulls.  I just put on netflix when i do it so im not moving as fast as possible
---
Naturally. By the end of Vanilla, classes were balanced around the game's meta and the technical limitations, so naturally with those technical limitations removed there would have to be some adjustment. But if you take a few pieces from TBC (say, Paladin Taunt and Crusader Strike) and see how that works within the existing balance and then adjust from there, I think you can make a pretty fun game that still has the spirit of WoW Classic.
---
Warrior or Rogue. Rogue is a lot of stun locks and controlling fights which I find pretty similar to how a warlock wants to play and warrior is more brute damage and constantly being in the fight.   
---
I’d say warrior is the biggest opposite to warlock.
---
You’re so triggered here it’s cute
---
This. This is 100% the reason. This is without a doubt totally justifiable on Blizzards part. It would cost Blizzard SO MUCH money to run everything on a singular physical server. More patches, more IT support, bigger data centers, more single points of failure. I'm a network guy by trait so I don't know all the ins and outs of server administration but I do know the metrics would never justify what they'd need to fix this issue.
---
neither of us know what their plan is, but I do know that they'll learn what OSRS did; no new content = user drop off.
---
Pick a class bro!
---
Im not saying anything. Blizzard did.
---
Yeah where can I bet it all that it won't be fixed lol
---
Thank you so much mate !
---
Care to explain why myrah song is so much present in all BIS guide ? It doesnt look like this great
---
You could argue it adds to the world by not having every literal thing explained
---
Also, don't need on Druid gear. Having had a rogue take my BIS tanking gloves, I'm not keen on ever having a rogue in my group.
---
I soloed this as a holy priest last night. I didn't need to kill any hyenas though.
---
The boss fight took 6m21s though since the only damaging ability I used was SW:P and Devouring Plague.
---
Touché about the human topic haha. I mean always loved draenei but can't play one so... Humans are just too strong in classic for warrior tanking.
---
Okay, because when I see the stat on dal'rend off hand I didn't quite understood how mirah could be better.
---
Staged joke for Reddit
---
Ahhh that's a bummer! Well then you could two man DM east jump runs with a warrior!  Great money!
---
Thanks for the advice mate!
---
bro nice me too lol. And an alliance warrior. Did my last ZF run last night starting Mara today
---
45g is about right at my server. I saw it drop twice. For epic patterns the unspoken rule at our server is that everyone roll need on it whether or not you are a priest. I lost the roll twice so I just bought one off AH.
---
This should make the servers run better, not worse, since each shard server only has to run 1 zone instead of the whole world.
---
Meanwhile russian basement servers can support massive world pvp on a single server instance
---
That 99.99% of the addon users wouldent do without spy.
---
I get that it’s kinda hard for blizzard to ban it. But I think it’s the same as using automated inputs. The same argument could be used “It literally just send input commands for keys I can press myself”.
---
Fair enough. Doesnt mean its worthwhile except for aesthetics.
---
But when 2/3 of the choices in each row are pretty situational or flat crummy, how is it better?
---
Man, I love this community so much. A lot of times it's toxic as fuck, and there are certainly assholes, but then you get people like this guy. This is fucking awesome. I still wish I played the game.
---
Agreed.
---
I put a month or so into Cata, and then quit. I had my suspicions before that, but I was determined to give it a shot. Sadly, my suspicions were correct.
---
Over 9000
---
Torn between SL spec or Nightfall/Conflag for World PvP in Phase 2.
---
Currently have 4300 health unbuffed with Demonic Embrace talent, and +200 fire damage (319 shadow).
---
I've been getting conflicting opinion on whether or not Nightfall/Conflag is good enough at our current gear level...
---
Don't you go with a slow 2 hander while leveling for the hamstring/hit-timer thing?
---
I always thought the spell icon for silence was a fish hanging from something. Like it's hanging out to dry or being cooked over a fire or something. Never bothered to look closely enough to see the pair of lips, but I thought it was really strange that a fish would be the icon for silence.

If you can get into a spell cleave group SM is amazing exp (30k+ an hour - i topped off at 50k with the best group i had) which makes leveling fast. I did SM from 33-40 and was able to go to zones and faceroll quests because they were yellow/green after.
---
1) Make sure to have Righteous Fury active 100% of the time.
---
2) Have the newest rank of consecration.
---
3) Use your other abilites, e. g. Retribution Aura or Blessing of Sanctuary (actually a bit later)
---
4) Switch Targets between hits to get more threat via Seal of Righteousness since you dont have Seal of Wisdom yet.
---
5) Just make sure to get the strong nasty Mobs (big 2h adds for example) and ignore casters or skull. Everyone takes the same damage from spells, so it doesnt matter if you get hit or a DPS. Skull will just die instantly, no Need to build threat.
---
Rogues usually have really good dps in single target boss-fights. As I explained in the last paragraph, they do offer some cc with stuns and cds. Rogues are probably mostly desired in melee groups/melee cleave groups as they benefit from WF totem. 
---
I am Horde, the dynamic might be a bit different while leveling as Alliance :P
---
That is ideal, yes. Both in terms of accommodating how paladins generate threat, as well as xp/hour.
---
I'm stashing my bank full of free action potions to trickle into the post phase two AH.
---
Well, I'm not sure if they do. I've heard they do but I wouldn't hold your breath if they won't even enforce safespotting rules.
---
As a warrior tank I will tell you I have no problem bringing a rogue to dungeons, but they need to be focused on the group and not meters. Don't open up on something immediately. Give it a few seconds to all get in position and see if there is something you can do to help. If the healer/range get agro try to lock things down and drag stuff back the the tank. 
---
I once was doing a 5man with 2 rogues and was a bit pessimistic about it but kept it to myself. They didn't do the best job letting me keep threat on the main target but the but it didn't matter because the thing was either stunned or switching between them so much that it didn't make a dent in them. When things got harry they stepped up to kick and kite things to me or lock down the more dangerous stuff. 
---
It was probably one of the easiest runs I've done. The funniest part is that I left feeling fairly useless since they did at least half my job. So coming from a tank, what was posted above is 100% true. If you utilize your entire toolkit people will want you back. 
---
And for me as a tank, meters only matter on bosses and only when things are going smooth.
---
You didn't censor the second pic lol
---
Ahh that makes sense. I probably should’ve kept the Tigerstrike Mantle I got as a BoE world drop. I heard it was a good twink cape but needed the gold for my lvl 40 mount so I sold it. 😑
---
Same can be said about cast bars add on. Don’t see OP complaining about that.
---
Alliance Incendius is A+ join us :)
---
1.5M people have downloaded the addon world wide. I don't think the police and courts have time to prosecute everyone if it was made illegal. Also think of all the people that have to be extradited to the US.
---
Damn! I did that as well on Ravencrest. Can't remember if it was during vanilla or tbc though. I believe it is not that uncommon thing to do.
---
Actually power shifting while tanking plays a key role as it allows you to drink potions/use sappers without skipping a beat
---
Trolls on the internet?!?! No way that doesnt happen.
---
You can knock out a lava run in 20 minutes with a half competent group.
---
I was there for this in &lt;Rise&gt; that helped put the wPvP event together. It was nasty the entire time. 30 seconds to rez after hitting accept. No clue if spells went off or not.
---
Nobody is getting mad tho. We are just stating facts.
---
Wow is a pvp game in its essence.
---
The latest Elvui update has predictive healing.
---
people switched because they had a chance to make their usually temporary character permanent, to play with more people.
---
Thank you !
---
Really?
---
In addition to all this you CAN hold aggro on a primary single target (boss mob for instance) if you seal and judge righteousness on cool down
---
I see it now. Thank you.
---
Nah only when you’re out of range/hearth/flying
---
Why wouldn't you just smash first? Like, honestly what would that set you back 3 minutes?
---
you have seriously garbage hunters then my friend
---
You arent alone on PoE.  I can't get into it.  I much prefer Grim Dawn.
---
Watching a mara farm guide. Will try tonight. See how I do. Thanks
---
You are missing the point entirely because this isnt about choosing between retaining what they have versus going after something new. Its about people who have already departed and trying to WIN THEM BACK as opposed to spending that effort towards a larger market entirely.
---
In both cases they are not retainable customers, you have to sell to both of them so it makes sense to choose the larger market rather than burrow into a niche and hope a much smaller pool returns again after already departing the customer base.
---
It's not sarcasm. My only goal here is to motivate people to talk about it, and maybe report this vile stuff wherever they see it.
---
Fuckin crybaby rogues it's not like anyone can see you
---
The problem with this statement it's a hypothetical based on the assumption that the new content is stuff that you want.  But given many of the negative opinions surrounding retail, the reality is that despite a lot of effort to create that new content they may just make things worse or not improve it enough to get people to want to play the new stuff.  
---
There are lessons to be learned from the popularity of Classic but the black and white of it being TBC or classic plus may be oversimplifying the scenario.  Maybe they need to fix retail.  Maybe they need to make a new game that has a different infrastructure to make sure that the good things about it aren't hurt by the mistakes of its predecessor. 
---
Also I don't think the opinion that just because its easier to make a legacy server vs. new content means its not worth doing.  I'm having fun playing classic.  I don't think I should be upset that it was easy money for them.  What I want from a game developer is a fun game and I got that.  Do I want a new game that is as much fun as classic with updated mechanics and end game player engagement? Yes but I'm not convinced they know how to or have the desire to do that. 
---
Then there's the fact that different people liked different expansions for different reasons.  If you make new content it has to be one way and takes a lot of production resources.  Or you can spend less resources making legacy servers for multiple expansions creating a wider range of play experiences depending on preference.
---
You are including that with world buffs... if so why dont you go ahead and include that tribute run time, flight to felwood and trip over to stormwind before you travel to MC as well...
---
Works for FFXIV, character creation is extremely limited on very high-pop servers.
---
The ring from trib is preBiS for us.
---
Leave the defending to the hunters. Rogues are there to spin flags/sap cap!
---
I'm not sure about rage gen, but with 2h fury a big part of your dps come from flury. The attack speed bonus would affect a slow 2h more than a fast one.
---
Last night I did a full strath run, Jaundice and all.
---
Our tank was a paladin.
---
I have NEVER come close to wiping on the doctor boss.
---
He has this mechanic where he engrages and switches targets, the tank absolutely needs to taunt him and keep aggro as he hits like a train in this part.
---
Pally tank could not at all, we wiped twice. 
---
It's pretty brutal.
---
Just wanted to add that for rogues we can also use vanish to drop **ALL** threat instead of just dropping some on one target with feint.
---
Wait was it in a Swedish guild?
---
You don't need to access storage to process world PVP combat
---
In Brazil we call it "Gambiarra"
---
What?! That’s meh server. I must seek out this fish man. Just dinged 60!
---
From my understanding, a slow 2h is wanted if your horde for windfury procs from a shaman, and for instant attacks based on weapon damage like Mortal Strike, Whirlwind, and Slam.
---
well there is your problem... you are still trying to get sleep...
---
You are correct, this person is interpreting an entirely unmade point and seems too stubborn to admit his mistake.
---
Please I'll suck ya toes
---
Oh! I didn't know that! You got me, then. I'll see myself to the shame corner.
---
Do you even know how to read or do you just guess what people wrote? Because quite obviously you are too retarded to read otherwise you would know we are far beyond that :P
---
But you probably tried to be funny? Kys
---
Yeah, we just blacklisted the guy and his guild.
---
And last night we finally got the necklace. Must have ran that place at least 15 times more and have to give up an orb to the tank each run for most of the runs. WILL NEVER RETURN TO STRAT LIVE AGAIN.
---
We really need an official response from the team regarding this issue because more threads like these will pop during pvp phase.
---
Who is it?
---
if world bosses are unplayable and I can go to a free server and get playable world bosses, why the fuck would I keep paying a sub?
---
Enh shaman. 
---
Where warlock is about meticulous timer upkeep in PvP and shadowbolt spam in PvE, enh shaman kind of goes all in off the draw, and rngesus takes the wheel. In PvE, they actually have a couple buttons to press.
---
You should look at your Priest BIS slot and determine that yourself.
---
If any of them drop from Anger, Arena or Golem you can spam those runs.  If they drop from anything else than you'll need to do full runs most likely - or find Saving Princess runs if you just need that boss for instance.  Just spend like 10-15 minutes doing a bit of research and put together a list of bosses / items from each slot so you can check them off the list as you get them.
---
Word of warning... won't be easy.  I am a Warlock and here is a BiS belt from one of the Arena bosses and I have literally run Arena 30+ times, seen the belt drop twice and both times I was beaten on rolls.  So just keep positive and change it up if you are getting frustrated and go try another dungeon.
---
How come this one doesn't list the go back to retail one for Horde?
---
I sound like a broken record, but Blizz totally fcked the server balance thing.  I wonder who was responsible for choosing the # of servers at launch, not capping the amount of layers per server, not balancing horde/alliance character creation etc.  Someones head should roll.  
---
I wonder if they will create new servers in TBC and try get it right (I mean, they've only had 15 years of experience to get this right...........)
---
Yeah, my tank didn't really have the luck with gear yet, so I'm aready overtaking him in aggro with barely any consumes.
---
I just prefer going with optimized rotation which is enough to be around 400-600DPS in all fights (I already have OEB though).
---
Once PvP hits, our serious rankers are also allowed to just sit in PvP spec and do 20% less damage as long as they pull their weight overall.
---
At level 53 when can I run BRD? Is there a certain run I should be looking for?
---
&gt;"Warrior is going to get *insert obvious rogue gear here*"
---
Lots of "rogue gear" is also BiS for DPS warriors.
---
Stop being greedy.
---
The Fight Club warrior discord has most of this data, or links to it. I've been lurking there for a while, but every active participant there is way more knowledgeable about this stuff than me.
---
In short, however:
---
While you have Heroic Strike queued up, your offhand attacks act as if they're yellow hits. So they ignore the hit chance penalty from dual wielding. You can even unqueue the HS right before your mainhand hit, so as to not waste the rage.
---
As for instant attack procs - [here](https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Windfury-Totem) is a long-ass writeup by magey on Windfury Totem. The rest of his wiki is also an interesting read.
---
I think you missed the part where this wasn't an issue on private servers.
---
I do why people downvoting you so bad. Yes you can tank in fury spec and do ok depending on your group but fury spec should never be a tank or off tank in a raid. Dungeons are ok but for fuck shake out on a shield. The amount of damage fury takes over protection is ridiculous and don’t care how much treat you build it isn’t gonna work for any raids other than MC. I feel like right now people have a false sense of how BWL and NAXX is going to be as they were a lot harder. Healers won’t be able to keep you alive if a boss can one hit you. I’m really sick of warriors thinking 2h tanking is ok, like your a tank it’s not your job to do damage and it makes the healers job a lot harder and it doesn’t speed things up if you wipe.
---
Spell batching is trash and lowers the skill cap. 
---
Tanks die due to spell batching, LoSing spells sometimes doesn't work due to spell batching, interrupting spells sometimes doesn't work due to spell batching. 
---
There is no consistency and it leaves a moronic level of RNG that you can't compensate for.
---
Epidemic definition:
---
&gt;affecting or tending to affect a disproportionately large number of individuals within a population, community, or region at the same time
---
&gt;characterized by very widespread growth or extent : of, relating to, or constituting an epidemic
---
&gt;"the practice had reached epidemic proportions"
---
Not only are you using a shitty semanitic argument to defend racists, you're wrong about it too. WTF is your point here?
---
Looks like you can go as low as rank 2, which you learn at 22.
---
I'm using Nugrunning. It gives a bar with each dot ticking down where you want, and also a bar on nightfall proc. If you want something simpler, without the dot tracking, you can try "ClassicSpellActivations". This highlights the shadowbolt keybind when nightfall procs.
---
Re-read my original comment.  I'm talking about before inflation happened.  
---
As someone else pointed out, they are fucked for multiple reasons, and they will never be normalised because most of the reasons have nothing to do with it being a new server, or layering.  People know where and how to farm.
---
Can someone explain to me the connection between attack power and damage? I’m a lvl 22 hunter and I’ve heard that 1 agility = 2AP, but what does that mean for damage from auto shot, pet attacks, or abilities (I.e. raptor strike)?
---
Help other guildies get loot in dungeons... but I do agree to a point. Almost to 50 on my first alt
---
I kinda did the same. Warlock 46, hated it. Druid 50 gonna keep as my tank/heal alt. And im playing a 47 rogue now which I'm going to main.
---
I just hit 60 and want to level and alt but I’m having trouble deciding. I know. I want to tank and I already got a druid to 18 but now I’m wondering if I should switch to a Warrior.....help?
---
dps on trash is not what people talk about when saying how much dps they do...sure i as a rogue can burst for 700 with bladefury and adrenaline rush on trash but thats inflated numbers, not raid boss numbers.  
---
dps is usually what you can do on a patchwerk fight single target.
---
What is the normal cost for items from the DM North Tribute chest on your server?  I was quoted a price of 60g for weapons, and 50g for non-weapons, with an escort.  Is this fairly consistent with what others are seeing?  FWIW these prices were quoted from a solo running Hunter.
---
Then you have the rogues that pull groups on accident and run them into the party rather than vanishing or dying. (obviously not all rogues, just this one shit rogue I had in DM:W yesterday...) I need you dps to understand, if you do that you die for it or get out of combat. Don't risk a group wipe.
---
I read that rogues dont need to stack more than 9% hit rating, so with the 5% talent u only need an additional 4% from gear, but it looks like the BiS list on Icyveins has it set much higher than that. Is there any benefit to stacking additional hit?
---
10/10 MC + Ony? Waiting around for people missing is usually 20 min, travel is around 10 min. Waiting for people forgetting the amulet is around 10 min. Rolling for loot + explaining to new players also takes time. The whole raid process is longer than 90 min.
---
It was lagging the surrounding zones.  Searing Gorge, Burning Steppes, Baflands were all unplayable,  and the lag was being felt in Ironforge as well.
---
Unlocking boxes.
---
According to wowhead here: https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=674/dual-wield
---
You don't just add the weapon damage together.  For dual wielding the calculation is: Effective DPS = 0.76 x ( [Main Hand Weapon's DPS] + ( 0.5 x [Off-Hand Weapon's DPS] ) )
---
For 2h the calculation is: Effective DPS = 0.95 x [2-handed Weapon's DPS]
---
To put that into context, that would give dal rends set an effective dps value of 52.18dps.  Which would put its effective dps on par with rare ilvl 63 2h'ers like Barbarous Blade, Bonecrusher, Arcanite Champion and Arcanite Reaper.  Of which, Bonecrusher is easily obtained through a quest in DM with a weapon speed of 3.
---
\*On the first sentence about wanting you i was like\* Damn straight nobody wants you rogues, because like 99% of the times you want to reserve shit the tank needs.
---
if i buy out the whole market for 10g, and resell 1 fish for 10g, everything else i have in stock is bonus. I've done this alot. 
---
While you are right that other people are going to come into the market and try to push the price down, this does not mean that it is completely fruitless. It does depend a lot on your server, but generally if you buy low, sell high, your pretty safe.
---
I’m cold blood prep at the moment. My DPS isn’t as high but I’ve been able to pull off some really Roguey stuff 
---
Love when a caster is stuck on a healer and I just completely lock it down
---
You're positive, huh? You sound so certain. It's impossible for you to so simply say that one detail is the reason for the performance issues.
---
My theory is that their more-modern server technology allows for dynamic growing and shrinking of certain zones, but that kind of elasticity comes with a price of more complicated server/service infrastructure.  Aka there's an overhead that has been introduced when they made servers more flexible to growth. That's my _guess_/theory.
---
matchup specific trinkets and potions are a rabbit hole you can go into for days. At that point it just becomes a matter of whos willing to try harder and spend more money, which isn't that relevant if we're just discussing matchup balance. If you have LAP then you'll probably win. If rogue has shadow reflect and times it on your death coil you autolose. If rogue uses greater shadow protection life becomes hard, and if he uses juju might then he'll easily 100-0 you in the initial stunlock unless there's a huge gear discrepancy. 
---
I can go on but I think you get the point. There's really no use in discussing a matchup if one party is allowed to use consumables and the other isn't. If those are being considered than a more prepared player will almost always beat a less prepared player unless the matchup is REALLY lopsided (like mage vs warrior kind of lopsided)
---
Alliance warlock. What trinket can i get to break fear?
---
Come on now, you perfectly know the 3 hour was ment to describe the whole ordeal, flexing with a 90 minutes now it turns out it's more like 2 hours. :-)
---
It's literally just from the combat log.  Say you're a warrior and you walk into my view distance or fly over me while I have my combat log open.  I'm gonna see:
---
    YourCharacterName gains Battle Stance.
---
I run in and kill the mob for the Alliance player, then I kill the alliance player.
---
I just saved you durability damage.  And helped you.
---
Why are you booing me??
---
smf? Shake my Fanny?
---
If someone’s not bringing a priest or shaman than it’s their own fault for a faulty group.
---
&gt;lowers the skill cap
---
All of the displays of mechanical skill that people would make in prebc/tbc were caused by spell batching. Vanish coil, gouge blink, sw:d poly, scatter charge, combat sap, ff vanish.
---
Yea i've noticed that, where would i find such dedicated discords?
---
This happens to me all the time as my girlfriend is constantly on /follow me.
---
Jeez. Yeah, AH prices fluctuate a ton. I'm on Venoxis - Ger which is still layered due to the high amount of players. 
---
We have both Deepwoods and Flurry for 250-350g.
---
Same damage?
---
You might want to look at those items again lol
---
Cruel Barb + fiery/icy is the poor man's twink weapon
---
I can tell you Almost all warriors will not be using leather for PvP, my leather pieces are for pve only, for PvP and tanking i have a full plate set and i know most others also have
---
i guess my gold comes from fails.
---
Okay so I’m going to do what I can to provide an answer based on my experience. I’m not a theorycrafter. 
---
One thing I’m seeing is that you’re trying to compare double Dal’Rend to raid 2h weapons. 
---
My understanding is for tanks attack speed is crucial for threat / rage generation. The math I would do is how many times am I hitting the boss per minute, every time I hit the boss I am generating rage and threat. 
---
2h @ 2.10sec = 29
---
2h @ 2.9 sec = 21
---
DW @ 2.8 + 1.8 = 54
---
This is 54 chances to crit and proc flurry to further increase your speed. And while each hit may not be causing the same damage when compared hit to hit I would think that the amount of threat and rage generated from 54 hits is much more than 29. 
---
Like I said I’m not a theorycrafter. But I’m willing to discuss more if you feel this is wrong.
---
Do a little class research if you don't know what you want to play. See what the viable playstyles and specs are for what you want to do at endgame (pvp, run 5 mans forever, farm cosmetics and money, raid) and then look up videos and see what you think of them in action.
---
...avoid becoming a twitch streamer/youtube personality fanboy.
---
Bro, my wand deals frost dmg. Im down to arcane explosion and fireblast when that happens!
---
but the warrior isn't gaining battle stance he already had it.  it didn't function like this in vanilla
---
Alright so we are at my apartment. I can tell its going to happen, she wants to watch some tv and its going to be a slow progression to when its going to happen. I'm going to be invested in this endeavor another couple of hours and probably get wrangled into some cuddling and then she is going to try and sleep at my place. Keep in mind its already getting late and I have work the next day. For me it was pretty much get laid, deal with getting her out of my place and then sleep or get to grab some quality time on world of warcraft. If she was like "hey I got to go soon so lets have a quicky" then sure. But this isn't a movie or something, that sort of thing doesn't happen very often for me.
---
I forgot to get the last hand (3/4) for Hands of the Enemy in MC last night
---
I love riding up on my mount and watching an alliance warrior struggling and near death on a mob that I can take easily.  I stand there watching until I know they can't do it.  The whole time they're thinking "Fuck I'm definitely dead now, that guy is gonna eat my butt".
---
Do I *accidentally* put on blade flurry while I help you?  Who knows.
---
Crippling poison is more beneficial than not. Helps with runners, helps when tank loses aggro to a caster or healer. Never a bad thing for them to run slower. Even if you're trying to go super fast. Since when did the tank need to be right next to a target while hes running to pull more? If he's quick pulling a new group the other group better be in clean up phase where the rogue can finish them off solo. I mean...what?
---
But dal'rend defender can be equiped in MH so technically I can use it with a shield right?
---
Hoot hoot.
---
Yep but fandom is still up and running with lots of incorrect/outdated info, and it shows up higher than the osrs wiki on some queries :(.
---
fuck that cliff, and getting MCed off it lmaooo
---
Well, I dont know what defender is, but the Tribal Guardian cannot be equipped in the MH slot. Only OH. So Sacred Charge is the only one of the two that can be used with a shield.
---
The combat log shows you if an entity is friendly or not.  You can even filter it to only show enemy actions.  Spy also doesn't automatically /tar anything to show you their level.  It makes an educated guess based on what actions they took or buffs they have (e.g. if a Warrior gains Berzerker Stance it will say the warrior is level 30+).
---
Sounds like you are either underleveled for the dundeon or getting shit dps that don't know how to switch targets if they pull agro (and that happens with every tank)
---
Thats a shoulder item though.
---
They're not. Simply because from 305-308 you go from approx -20% damage each glancing yo -5% so no, you should Always get edgemasters
---
It’s not the 3 minutes of sex. It’s the 2 hour nap afterwards
---
damn it
---
Leveling on Tuesday is good. You can quest with less 60’ out the open world cuz they’ll all be busy raiding for a couple of hours. Thursday as well I think?
---
I'm on a server without layers, so I don't have that particular issue. But the lag or desync or whatever you call it when you change zones is definitely there, even without layers and at low play times and low pop zones.
---
I would love to play alliance but all my friends went horde so the division was go alliance or horde with friends. Really a no brainer there howeve I still don't want to play on an unbalanced server and turns out my server is the most unbalanced one in my country and that sucks
---
Yep.  If you want carpal tunnel.
---
I thought the amount that was shared though depended on if you actually hit or healed while fighting the killed person or basically if you did nothing you only got like 1 honor point but cast a spell or two and it’s shared evenly. It’s been a long time since vanilla so hard to remember.
---
&gt; That 99.99% of the addon users wouldent do without spy.
---
thats what all addons do, automate the annoying manual things
---
Kazzak doesn´t drop any healing gear. Azuregos has a couple of things that are interesting.
---
I main a Druid and love the utility they provide while leveling. If you spec mainly feral, you can DPS, Tank, and Heal basically everything through level 50. Leveling as feral isn't too bad either.
---
Skinning and herbing really are such easy ways to make gold while leveling. Imo mining isn’t as good because you have to go out of your way a lot of times just to level it up, and you really don’t start making money off it until you can mine stuff like thorium. 
---
Skinning and herbing though are so easy you barely have to think about it. Just send stacks of leather to a bank alt whenever you get to a town, half the mobs you end up fighting while leveling are skinnable.
---
This is all true with the exception of weapons and offhands. The furbolg pouch and skull of impending doom can both be hotswapped during combat (still have to wait 30 seconds to use)
---
You won’t do very good damage at all, but most fights at this point don’t need a ton of damage.
---
That said, rogues are a dime a dozen so if you’re trying to find a raid spot, most raids are going to take the guy willing to respec to pve combat for raids and show that he’s actually willing to put the effort in on the pve side as well. Lots of people want to pvp, but in classic if you want a raid spot as a rogue in a good group that’s consistently clearing MC, you’re going to have to be willing to do things like respec and bring consumables, or wait a few months until pugs are geared enough and willing to take pvp spec players and face roll it still.
---
In my own personal opinion, unless your guild is super casual and don’t care about clearing bosses at all, trying to raid in pvp spec when the difference is as big as it is for rogues is disrespectful to everyone in the raid who actually put in the effort.
---
No XP from the respawning mobs, happened quite a while ago
---
Gotta wait until Tuesday, Nov 12  and honor up and get the PvP trinket.
---
You can def heal Cath at 37. Not sure about the + or int/spirit though.
---
It give you the coordinates of where you were when you saw them.
---
Passively reading and actively inputting command are definitely the same thing, yep.
---
The impact of attack power on individual skills i sbased on attack power coefficients (similar with spells- there's spell power coefficients).  Here's a source for you:  [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Attack\_power\_coefficient](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_power_coefficient).  That is not classic-specific, but this is:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/95abc8/list\_of\_spellcoefficients\_1121/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/95abc8/list_of_spellcoefficients_1121/) 
---
Hope that helps.
---
The biggest one before classic DID have rollbacks and frequent crashes.
---
Kill trading is an unfitting term. What will happen is that the top pvp'ers will make deals who gets R14 next and play accordingly. Meaning the other candidates limit their honor gain in favor of the one who is supposed to get R14 that week.
---
The goal is not to gift kills to one player but to control the numbers at the top to make the outcome of the ranking predictable and get a new R14 each week and in the agreed on order.
---
This imagine has only been reposted [one time previously in 2015](https://www.tineye.com/search/291477b9722ab0658408383904b4dfc7650e9e81?page=1) but could possibly be much, much older.

You have the most precious thing. Something we here don't have. You have the chance to walk away. You can walk away a lead a good life. Get a great job, meet a spouse, raise a family, and die happy well into you 80's.

The only thing you can do is walk away. Because if you keep going forward, well, that's hell you're walking into kid.

Massive world pvp like this is something the community wants to engage in, not something we are trying to avoid. Its also an issue that will make a huge aspect of the game, world bosses, completely unplayable. I dont even want to image what the AQ40 release will look like when thousands flock to silithus.
---
Has Blizzard addressed this yet? It's such a bad experience. Especially when paying $15 a month on top of it, and realizing servers that were run for free were better then what a multi billion dollar company like Blizzard provides.
---
You can only have one specialization. You'd literally have to unlearn/relearn engineering and skill it back up which would be a huge waste of money
---
A geared SL Lock with every cooldown has no 1v1 counter, but I would still strongly recommend against specing it right now
---
The first time I encountered this it was magical. “Who is this little floating guy and what does he want”. Then we got ganked. Fun times.
---
It is going to vary from server to server. Why ask people if you already have the answer?
---
:(
---
I understand I need another player with enchanting to enchant my gear, I have a few questions.
---
How do I go about finding another player to do that? Spam trade?
---
If I have all of the mats, then how much do I tip? 
---
Also any etiquette I should be aware of?
---
300-400g Horde @ Smolderweb
---
Wish I had remembered the first char i leveled there. I remembered on my alt and got so mad about those GY runs back I did on my main they were like 8 mins.
---
This hurt my feelings
---
Yeah it’s a hilarious video even though I feel bad for laughing while I laugh since it was a serious traumatic event for that guild. Still funny to watch though the horde shred through them
---
That moment when you spot someone talking straight out of his ass.
---
Confirmed Stalagg also was lagging in even a 40v40 last night much less the 200v 200 that happened later
---
You can heal Cath as a priest early, just might have trouble finding people willing to let you in.  My friend started healing SM GY at level 20 and now is currently doing Scholo at level 52.
---
As a healer in dungeons, +healing/int is more important.  Solo questing/grinding, spell dmg/spirit is more important.
---
Tanks are different because there’s only like 3 of you, so even if the mt gets funneled 1st priority on everything, the offtanks will get items the second time they drop. Gear funneling would feel much worse on a mage or something when there’s 8 others in line
---
Well, you're probably one of the few, usually I don't come across friendly undead rogue. Just yesterday I (44 dwarf SP) saw a 43 troll warrior struggling against 2 mobs, one almost full and one low life. I did as much as possible to take threat on the full life and killed the other one, the warrior survived with about 5%, showed me he was thankful in emotes. Maybe 3sec later a 49 UD rogue came to kill me, he probably was just there the whole time, watching his fellow horde warrior dying. The troll was sorry for me (emotes again) and the rogue came back to kill me again twice after that.
---
All that to say, thank you for being a nice player towards those who struggle, despite the faction. I try to be like you ! And I hope acting that way may influence some others.
---
Psychosomatic
---
Yeah I’m just playin
---
If 100v100 is an issue now, can you image Silithus during AQ40 event when there are thousands upon thousands flooding the zone?
---
Then buy them and sell to vendor?
---
&gt; st majority of players will continue to never experience this and not care. There will be no bad PR from
---
Thats why i support Star Citizen and am helping to make the game I WANT to play in :)
---
Exactly.  It is harder to scale one shard big enough to handle everyone than to create infinite smaller shards for chunks of the population.  It is very possible the system architecture itself would have to change in order to compensate for this issue.
---
VMs can be spun up quickly but they all share the same resources or are hard capped on what they can use.  So if Blizzard hasn't started pulling realms from VMs and onto dedicated hardware, we aren't going to see this solved anytime soon.
---
Que the dominant faction and offer free faction Xfers until the faction balance is withing 5% of eachother.
---
What kind of stupid fucking analogy is that?
---
Pics or it didn't happen...
---
The others have said some good things. One bit I would like to add, however, is that Paladins are arguably the best tanks for everything except raids. If you want to tank, and do not plan on tanking raids at 60, the  a paladin is certainly a great option. But like the others said, you cant really main tank raids, and you'll have a near impossible time trying to find a guild that will allow you to raid as a paladin tank.
---

---
As a hunter I’ve never even seen that second list before when looking for BiS options and I’m pretty sure the core marksman rifle is never really worth getting as it costs far too much for the stats it gives, its mostly just to show off with how crazy the weapon model is
---
&gt; My biggest fear is that they don't have any real gamers left on the dev team, so they lost that connection to what we want to play.

---
Are these fury tanks actually geared enough for it? Seems like they’d be a mana dump with low mitigation
---
Main difference is that you already have a job.
---
only if you suck
---
Insufferable people like you demand that fringe issues be thrown into spotlight and you don't see you're just giving them a louder voice. Anyone who sees the issue different than you is labeled with a buzzword and therefor needs to be censored. You've got a lot of growing up to do.
---
One handed weapons get the same dps contribution from attack power as two handed weapons do, and you can also equip an off hand. End result being that you do a lot more dps.
---
But isn’t that why you get the good items on one side then carry them over to the other specialization once you level engineering up again?
---
Its still something that EVERY PERSON and their dog complains about and wasnt in PServers and doesnt add to the game but takes away from it, but sure, lets just fix the ONE thing that sucks about the game and not all the things while we are at it.
---
Efficient raiding wouldn't involve doing Ony and MC on the same day. Ony has a 5 day reset, MC has 7.
---
42 here! hahahahahelpmehahaha
---
I mean granted the second list is simply without a money limit what your pound for pound best option is stats wise. I just dont understand the logic of going past 9% hit
---
I don't think there's currently any to break fear. You can make the blacksmithing trinket which makes you fear immune for 30 seconds but doesn't actually break fear.
---
I very quickly realized I can no longer play WoW or a number of other games anymore.
---
I cannot commit to 1-5 hour uninterruptible sessions of gameplay. Honestly I don't know how I did it in my 20's.
---
Back to Monster Hunter, PoE and Warframe for me.
---
I’m on Sulfuras Alliance side seems very balanced if not a tad horde favored
---
The smallest realm in classic will still lag like crazy if they organize a large battle. This isn't an over populated realm problem.
---
I think its funny how Its so hard for me to find a group but once I do Im always top Dps, I Save the group 90% of the time with distracting pats or cc'ing casters and picking every lock in brd! makes 0 sense why Rouges are not picked up enough. I havent ran into alot of warriors stealing my gear but when it does happen its a shame cuz its bis for me and everyone knows it, but you have to Feed the warrior who gets plumbed by anger for not wearing plate. But ill wait till the 12th and be sipping my tea as I one burst a warrior. \*insert Kermit Meme\*
---
Just wait until you see the hamstring icon....
---
Spirit is your priority, especially leveling. You want to maximize your spirit for spirit tap.
---
What spec are you?
---
Can you mind soothe multiple targets at the same time?
---
My man. quality post.
---
Lol if it doesn't then it makes me feel better having it at least
---
FUCK GRIZZLY.
---
They have baited us with their fucking cheating bullshit and led multiple horde raids right to us.
---
Those people deserve to get hit by a bus, then set on fire, then beaten with clubs, then ripped limb from limb before finally being thrown to the wolves.
---
well it would make sense. they are a business and they want to lower costs as much as possible, so they don't spend the money unless they're basically forced to. If they need 5$ worth of gum they spend 5$, not 6$. 
---
It would be weird if it were the other way, if blizzard spent thousands of $ for upgrades that were above and beyond what was required. 
---
so technically every business wants to be "cheap" and frugal.
---
This works best when the population is distributed across all the shards.  But because shards aren't (theoretically) dynamic and able to grab resources from other shards fast enough, when one shard starts bloating with players, the resources aren't generated fast enough to meet demand.
---
I suppose that would work if you went gnomish to goblin as the gnomish stuff is soulbound... I don't know if anyone would actually bother though?
---
Yeah but people would never read their combatlog every millisecond while just mindlessly grinding mobs. Only a few would. That’s the difference, most other addons people would bother to do manually if not given the choice.
---
IMO int/spirit till gearing for raids as you are probably still shadow spec, meditation helps greatly when you get in the low 50s.  For ease/speed I tried to be near the level of the last boss.  Obviously you can go in earlier with a heal spec, geared or higher level tank/dps.
---
Legitimately laughed out loud multiple times while reading this, between the hawking and epstein jokes i was gone.
---
Also thanks for not personally attacking me. Sincerely, combat rogue
---
I told myself that I would do one run a day just to see if I could get it. 
---
Shadowfang dropped my very first run and I haven’t gone back since.
---
I consider the time spent drinking to be offset to some degree by not waiting for another tank. I've seen some groups advertising for a tank for 30+ minutes. 
---
And yeah the bosses that need taunts are a pain, but I tank as 30/21 (Holy/Prot) and if I can't get aggro back I just spam heals on the warrior/rogue with aggro.
---
And then 6 months later they would use the shit out of it again.
---
It's never too late to start playing classic
---
It's really not that bad. There's one DPS check in the game right now (rag) and everybody is so damn optimized from a decade and a half of theorycrafting that having a few suboptimal DPS specs (boomkin, feral, enh, ele) isn't hurting much, especially if they bring utility. Minmaxing 15 year old content cleared in the first week by sub-60s makes you look like a tryhard.
---
Yeah by defender I meant Guardian sorry. The name sliped. Hooo okay so that's an information I didnt have. That explain why no one mention it on tank weapon despite its stats.
---
Sometimes it just happens to line up, like this coming sunday, for example. We usually have separate raids and kill ony before each reset.
---
So... you'll give me a fishing rod too?
---
It also has to connect each zone simultaneous.  Think of all those players flying through zones loading in and out.  That's a lot of extra legwork at the back end
---
No way. Come join the party!
---
Nope it still looks pretty good to me, people looking for groups constantly in lfg channel for all level ranges.
---
Fayejin
---
If you like both classes, I would main the warrior when it comes to group play/gearing him up from raids and all that, and use the hunter for solo play/gold farming.
---
Killing civilian NPCs, and it nukes your rank into the ground. You can undo months of honor grind in one evening of NPC camping if you so desire.
---
Oh my no. Come join the fun brother! Plenty of raid groups still need folks and are still pushing content..Heck, phase 2 isn't even out yet. By the time you hit 60, guilds will still be recruiting and still forming new raid teams that will need new people. :) Its never too late.
---
It will be for world bosses tbh
---
I think I got it on my 2nd or 3rd run.  Beat another rogue on the roll.
---
Nice! How did you avoid that one pack? Did you drag him up the ramp and then path him back and forth off the ledge?
---
 I tried that but you know once I jumped off to the bottom of that terrain ramp and dogs got me lol
---
Yea no i get that in a perfect world, where any item is available to all, dual wield would likely pull ahead.  But this isn't a perfect world.  There are a TON of warriors and rogues, and they all want the same weapons.  Warriors have the option to use a 2H, rogues don't.  So when a good 2H drops like OEB or Bonereavers drops, a fury warrior is much more likely to get it.  So now how to maximize the potential of said weapon?  Is this better than say quel'serrar/dal rends combo for tanking?
---
he was joking. the drop rate is 1/25
---
I haven't seen one in well over 50 runs.
---
Get better at the game
---
The OG talent system was great, aside from all the ones that were basically useless, but by the time they got rid of it there was just too many levels for that system to keep up with
---
Both automate actions a player can do by themself, no?
---
I think that’s the meta for PVP specs but i guess I’ll just have to do more research.
---
Don't sweat it if you're not totally optimized for pvp.  Just follow a warrior and toss him heals and he'll love you.  I guarantee it.
---
More DPS  
---
More TPS  
---
Excess rage &gt; Heroic strikes  
---
Offhand continues generating rage
---
Raids before braids

/stop casting

Done. Bind your totems and other 5 skills you use like a man.
---
I would include the time you spend hustling to buy people's coffer keys, as that is perhaps a non-trivial time sink?
---
My main is on a PvE server, and I rolled here because a good friend of mine picked it and I followed.
---
However they recently stopped playing, and I'm considering re-rolling on a PvP server instead before I hit 60, or at least level an alt on a PvP server. My main is 46 so it isn't too late for me to switch. 
---
My question is, when P2 rolls out will PvE servers be missing out on a lot of content?
---
I'm not huge into WPvP so I'm kinda on the fence, since I know BGs will still be there. In vanilla I didn't really join WPvP groups or anything but I did enjoy the occasional fighting in the open world.
---
So, for those on PvE servers or that have switched from one to the other what do you think? Even though I'm not a big WPvPer I still feel like something is missing on PvE, though I'm not sure I'll enjoy it more or not. And leveling has been nice since I can usually only play a few hours a day max, and not every day. Thanks for any insight!
---
I have no idea how some members of my guild accomplish as much as they do. I'm 60 with maxed professions/some BiS and I feel pretty decent about that. Some guildies though have everything.
---
I even commit to a specific goal every day. "I'm going to farm X dungeon for Y item today". If I dont het it I'll come back tomorrow. Cant be more efficient than that right?
---
I just hit 50 being a prot pally all the way from level 1. I started the talents from holy tree (Divine Intellect/Imp. Seal of Righteousness/Consecration) then moved to protection. The whole point of it is having some AoE threat generator, mitigating the incidental aoe generated by the DPSers. Holy shield could do the same job, as long as you can ensure the other party members won't start hitting mobs before they hit you. The biggest payoff for 0/31/0 is getting Blessing of Sanctuary one level earlier, which is a huge part of paladin tanking. 
---
On another note, i believe 25/26/0 is less efficient than either 30/21/0, 20/31/0 or 21/30/0, as the biggest payoffs on holy tree are Illumination/Divine Favor, and Holy Power.
---
/r/stalagg also here. Fuck this server
---
I make 40 an hour doing mara, more if I bothered to run DME instead.  So yeah, 80gph is possible in DM if you're lucky.
---
If you are a fresh 60 don’t try and tank as dual wield. If you are dpsing raids go ahead and go fury, but when tanking slap on a shield and mail/plate gear. Try not to wear your leather stuff.
---
You can tank any 60 dungeon as a fury warrior with a shield.
---
It really doesn't matter if it's $100 or $1B. When the needs don't justify the means that's all that matters. To make infrastructure changes that could cost in upwards of $2-10 million and an extra $1 million a year to support, just to help out with 200v200 world PvP that's is not extremely common, it could never be justified to the people that actually push the budget. Those people aren't the game designers, they're business men. It's all about metrics.
---
I’m guessing it’s just because as you said they’re using the best money can buy and the they’ve put the %3 scope on the rifle for money’s sake but idk
---
I bought mine for 15g it only took 32 runs.
---
For every good rogue out there, theres at least 3 shitty ones.
---
What sever are you on?
---
Can anybody link me a good guide to leveling mining wowhead doesn’t seem to be the best it’s taking multiple days.
---
You mean people are going to cooperate in order to reduce the soul crushing grind?  The use of honor caps and determining who gets R14 each week makes a lot of sense and allows people to avoid playing for 18 hours a day for 3 months.  That is not a bad thing.  Kill trading is colluding with the other faction to allow them to kill you repeatedly then doing the same to them.
---
is it tho...? what good is taking a single drop out of the ocean...?
---
You know it is possible to have wow without layers, and without unplayable lag in large scale PvP, right? Not mutually exclusive.
---
If you’re looking at an alt to solely make money on then I would recommend a mage as you can net a lot of gold from aoe farming in dungeons or zones. They’re also relatively fast to level so it wouldn’t be as much of a time sink. You could also pick up enchanting instead of mining which could make you a lot of gold
---
Shadowlands looks a little influenced by classic. Going from 1-60. Each level is supposed to be meaningful again.
---
Crit is an insane heal paladin stat. That is why the MC robe with +2% crit is BiS.
---
The ring is from what I've seen the most bought item and I normally see it at 50g. The other stuff people will try to charge 50g for you can normally talk them down. I got Rod of Ogre Magi for 25g. If they are waiting to find someone long enough they will take whatever they can get.
---
The last thing they'll do is fix it though. We'll have BGs or BS one way or another.   
---
I've never seen real world pvp without lag till I watched Pservers... It just doesn't exist for blizz.
---
Ashkandi on horde has plenty of people leveling
---
No even if a guild has a full group they are going to need alternates.  You aren’t going to be able to have 40 people show up every week or even any week consistently.  Stuff gets in the way.
---
It’s a chat parser that’s it
---
Do you play 5 minutes a day or something?
---
Not all of them. As a healer I sympathize with that on many levels...
---
Hey thanks! I'm using a combination of elv ui with the klix ui package.
---
While also working in real life to support my playing this game.. I can't get shit done, and it amazes me how many people who have absolutely 0 life to actually be able to do this..
---
Well yeah FAP is even better but then again if you assume trinketing kidney then you would rather have a lip than gapping their opener and then eating their damage.
---
We are in agreement, locks &gt; rogues in any fair 1v1.
---
I did the exact same thing recently. 60 priest on PvE alliance, now a 45 priest on PvP horde. Following...
---
You're making assumptions. Ones that are likely not true and thus your argument is without merit.
---
I have the same issue except most of mine are in their 30s and one in the 40s. Every class too
---
Not my recollection of vanilla and BC PvP realms
---
Thanks! am full shadow but keep all my spells upgraded
---
This would've been correct 5-10 years ago but nowadays most cloud infrastructures use hybrid or all flash datastores for their VMs. Spinning hard drives are only used for cold storage.
---
You don't need goblin to make the PvP bombs though.. What extra stuff do you get some goblin?
---
Well I think I know why we think differently. Do you play Horde? I’m Alliance and all of the Rogues in my guild are Human, except 1, who is a Dwarf. Coincidentally everyone is Swords except the Dwarf who is Daggers.
---
Anyone feel like whenever they find a chest and open it, all they get is cheese and a potion that is two tiers below what you actually use??
---
This is absolutely the problem.
---
They have the resources and money to throw at the problem so there is zero lag when large PvP event happen or when there is more than 40 people in an area.
---
They need to either scale up their cloud environments or dedicate more scalable resources to deal with the network traffic, else the game will continue to be straight up unplayable.
---
Its a fucking MMO and the game servers literally shit themselves when a large group attacks a city or congregates anywhere. World bosses are going to ass rape the servers when mutlie guilds are trying to PvP and tag the boss.
---
I honestly can't wait for that inevitable shit show. At least it will be wide scale enough across all servers that it will illicit a response from actiblizz
---
To kind of add to what others have said, he may have also found himself a very active, helpful guild that's been carrying him in dungeons and helping him improve. Maybe he did the ZF zombie spam somewhere in there, too.
---
That's true, forgot about the fire immunity
---
Depends on the enchant and how rare it is. If it's just a common recipe they learn automatically maybe throw them an extra gold or 2 to make it worth their time. If it's something that's rare and in high demand you're probably going to end up having to pay for it instead of giving a "tip" which depending on your server can be anywhere from 10-25 gold per for things like spell power and crusader. 
---
And yeah you just ask around in trade chat, or guild chat, say what enchants you're looking for. Often enchanters will spam in trade chat and have their rates as well for enchanting. You wouldn't even have to "spam" trade. Generally just saying hey I need crusader enchant, my mats. will get you plenty of whispers.
---
It's not subliminal though. 
---
I played against the Enclave in Planetside 2 and trust me you wouldn't join them without already knowing what kind of group they are.
---
If they've sanitized their public image it's probably because they'd be banned for a more colorful description rather than some attempt to subversively indoctrinate people. In my experience you would never make that mistake if you played with or against them- they are not family friendly.
---
I could have gone the rest of my life happily thinking that TE withered away.
---
They don't use cloud infrastructure. Everything is onsite at multiple databases. They did a walkthrough a few years ago and showed their server rooms.
---
I started playing a week ago and now I'm hooked, I've done more with people in a week than the last 10 years of retail
---
Nope.
---
One is passively reading a log, the other is actively inputting commands.
---
I completely agree the generic increase this ability or stat line by x% with each point don't serve any functional purpose and don't feel rewarding at all. Furthermore the changes are often so minimal that the effects aren't even noticeable until the whole talent is maxed out. I'd much rather have more talents that augment my play style and give new utility than change base stat lines and marginally tweak numbers.
---
I have my main,but I’m finding it hard to level an alt since I enjoy my main to much lol.
---
How do you cancel a heroic strike?
---
You can't vendor enchanting mats?
---
you can also buy tarnished elven ring these days easily as dm tribute runs are a chest so once someone finds one they can invite you after its dropped
---
Phase 2 might make things cancer but atm I think pvp server is the way to go as long as your class is a strong wpvper. Yeah you will get ganked by 60s and corpse camped, may be forced to take a break or abandon what you’re doing and go somewhere else. But that’s part of the experience and it’s not as common as you’d think. Most of my engagements are fun and relatively fair
---
Not every letter can be translated.
---
I have a question about UBRS-Rend strategy, interestingly I did not find any guides (spent ~45 mins searching) mentioning the specific issue I had to face today:

We had 2 warlocks, 2 warriors, a rogue and a holy priest(myself). I started the Rend fight at full mana, everything went smoothly, but at one point - Gyth was still alive, but Rend already got off - Gyth suddenly froze me completely. Unable to do anything, I had to watch the main tank's HP going down from ~85% to 5% and then could not save the situation. Obviously we weren't able to reset and I did not recieve a soulstone so it was very painful and awkward as everyone started to leave the raid group completely clueless what happened. 
---
None of the guides I found write anything about this freezing, but there must be a strategy to avoid this. Does the main tank need to make sure Gyth is kept far from the group looking in a certain direction or is it enough if I just stay as far as possible? How far can Gyth freeze?
---
Scroll up m8
---
That could and did happen back in vanilla days. It's not new.
---
It reflects how it was in vanilla. It was moved when t0.5 was added. Just guessing, but I think they moved it because it's frankly stupid strong and very easy to get from angerforge being so early in BRD
---
Happened to me on my way to MC raid last night lol, luckily got a cauterizing band to fix it up.
---
15 agility doesn’t come out until a later phase (5 I think?) and I believe lifesteal is better for 19 rogues until then. I could be wrong.
---
That same mentality is why people don't vote. If enough people do it they will notice if all they care about is money.
---
15g seems to be about the average.  The ring is great but with DM the price fell because of the tarnished elven ring.  But the attractiveness of blackstone ring is it's much easier to farm.
---
&gt; and blizzard has already explained, multiple times, that there was a team that developed classic and it wasn't just copy-paste
---
I never said it was copy-pasted. Don't put words in my mouth.
---
It would still be much more work to design, develop, and implement Classic+ than to port BC to "classic", especially considering how much of the heavy lifting was already done for Classic.
---
The buff itself is bugged, the displayed value is not the actual +stamina provided.  You can test this by having a priest without Imp Fort try to buff over your fort, it will tell him a more powerful spell is active.
---
War is hell
---
Pretty ironic coming from the idiot alleging all private servers are down using an article from 2016 about Nostalrius shutting down (not even when Classic was announced, let alone live) as the backbone of your claim.
---
Just take the loss, B.
---
Two times distracting is most helpful (from a tank perspective):
---
- If we're in the middle of a tough pull and a patrol is coming up on us, distract it to buy us some time to finish up the current pull. This one is obvious.
---
- If we're finishing up a pull and a patrol is wandering by. If it's in a position where it can be easily solo pulled, distract it, so I can easily pull/clean it up after we finish the current pull, instead of having to wait for it to patrol back around. This is super helpful in Undead Strat, for example.
---
I only ever had one group so far with action like that :/
---
 People getting feared and sheeped left and right and I'm there spamming dispel while making sure the tank doesn't die.  Then next run we have a mage and rogue who made it feel 10x easier with cc
---
It was a joke, but also 29 is much different from 20.
---
Do you manage your 5 second rule for mana regen well? Your mana regen from spirit stop for 5 seconds after casting a spell that costs mana. Since your max rank spells are your most mana efficient with no plus healing, you want to load up and cast "bunches" of spells that will allow you to stop casting for at least 7+ seconds so you can get some regen. 
---
Your mana only stops if you cast a spell that costs mana, and inner focus makes your next spell cost no mana. If you find yourself in a nice little regen window and only your tank is taking damage, let him get a little bit lower than hit him with an inner focus max rank gheal to top him off, and keep on regening. You can turn a 8 second regen window into like a 15 second on like that as long as your dps aren't taking unnecessary damage.
---
Do you find yourself having mana issues on a normal pull where you start at 100%, or is it the tank just kind of pulling a little too fast?
---
I think they have a point. Other than druids (which still were plentiful in night elf lands at the lower levels), I've encountered a SHOCKINGLY small number of rogues in the PUGs I've done. It's not a huge number, but there feels like a disparity. For similar gear competition reasons, I've rarely seen two warriors or two paladins together in a PUG, unless it's close friends / a second paladin is going healer and doesn't need / get priority for tank gear. I have seen casters turned down to avoid competition there, however a mix of mage, priest, and warlock is super common, or otherwise two mages and a priest.
---
99.99% people would be hopeless in raids without DBM, they no one seems to think that's cheating.
---
You still haven't given a scenario where crippling hinders the group.
---
DBM / Boss spell timers to be specific.
---
i cant help with the addon but if you have second monitor.......
---
It's fine, unless you have 2 wipes in 30mins. If that happens, we'll let's just say I hope you have your profanity filter on.
---
Everyone gets the extra HP, the tooltip is just not updated.  Your friend can check their actual HP total differences to see it.
---
The problems with renew are that there can only be one active (the most powerful) on a target, and especially in raid environments you get trigger happy healers obsessed with topping people off even if the renew would do the trick, so it does end up with a lot of overheal.  That being said, it's still not *awful*, just ill-advised, and it's entirely fine if you're solo healing.
---
As someone that farms gold specifically with certain chests, this is not true. Chests do not always have a green or blue at all, it’s actually rarer to see anything but grays.
---
Well he's alliance so that's probably all he can do
---
Rogues aren't useless at all, it's just that everyone's pre-BIS is Rogue gear and tanks (who are usually DPS warriors) get to call the shots on who joins.  
---
It's a supply and demand issue, and really seems to mostly just apply to pre-BIS dungeons.
---
Well crashwing definitely wasn't the biggest one before Classic and is hardly a good example to bring up when talking about Vanilla private servers.
---
Thank you very much for reply! I will do so, and Knowing that it‘s my team‘s task to pull off enemies from me is also good to know. Will i stay in my bis raid equ or should i switch to +spell dmg?
---
Oh...
---
The tone of the plot was criticized a lot. People hated that Diablo was a saturday morning cartoon villian.
---
well at least you wrote the necessary FAQ
---
Wow I just watched that private server video and that was the most epic shit I've ever seen. Blizzard has a week to fix this if we want to experience that on honor launch. So depressing.
---
Fiery is cheap (relatively) and procs often so makes the enchant feel very nice.
---
Alexander's Axe could last you till 60 assuming you don't see/go searching for something better, so I'd say it's definitely worth the enchant.
---
Given other player's reactions, it seems that a player has a stored list of buffs that tick down and an aura list.  As buffs can be removed, by and large, it makes sense the server has to track them.  Auras on the other hand are binary and without duration, on or off.  So when a new player loads into your detection distance, the buffs are part of the character but the aura is tracked separately.
---
I think this occurs when zoning as well.  You are in battle stance and zone in, you get the text "enters battle stance" when you load.
---
It's seems you haven't read the whole discussion and I have been a tad unclear. I know what server lag is but there is many possible reason for server lag. 
---
When I speak about the client I speak about the software part of client/servers Wich are both impacted by the passed update. One cannot evolved on is own, they impact each other. 
---
I was arguing that it wasn't necessary the hardware processing fault but more the quality of the sources or just the fact that software are more and more greedy now than 10 years ago.
---
Keep your calm next time
---
Blizzard  has to find a way to fix this if they want to revive  wow both Classic and Retail.
---
i appreciate all this info and conversation yall provided, if you dont mind one more question which i may have missed your answer to, is it tanks or dps warriors that tend to get armor and such more geared toward pvp? or does it not matter if you're tank/dps and any pvp gear that drops from raids is a whole other story?
---
Ya, lets do some maths....
---
ALL THE HIGH POP SERVERS will be feeling AND REELING from these effects...
---
ALL THE STREAMERS are going to be publicaly filming this shitshow as they try to world pvp and rank...
---
And this will be happening to about 60-70% of the TOTAL WoW classic population, with low pop servers taking up the other 40-30%. 
---
AND YOU ARE TELLING ME: "There will be no bad PR from this."..............
---
WHAT PLANET IS THIS KAT ON!!!??
---
That’s a problem with reddit in general. People silence the opinions they don’t like.
---
I feel like this sub skews people's perceptions a lot. Like level 60 in two months is FAST. I can imagine people sitting at lvl 35 can be disheartened when someone in full prebis 2 months after launch is seen as a casual.
---
Yes but that site is very simple and tries to translate letters individually, with maybe a few letter pairs. You'd have to find a cross faction friend and try every possible combination of 3/4/etc letters if you wanted anything longer.
---
Energy + combo points + kidney cooldown + multiple mobs running.  Crippling is way more practical.
---
I think TBC would be fun without flying mounts in game. All of the Wpvp capping zones would be actually fun in Outland with everyone running on ground Mounts. Then having 40 man raids to cap these positions and hold them might actually be possible and be more integrative experience for the community. 
---
Once flying mounts get added it’s the first step in disrupting community interaction by taking away one of the most fun aspects of classic which is Wpvp.
---
I've never seen it under 350g and usually around 450g on Old Blanchy server.
---
Good to have friends that play warriors... i will hind behind them as good as possible. Thanks!
---
2min I will never get back....
---
Thanks m8, very helpful!
---
enlighten me? Youa gree with a hybrid tax i understand that. But are you ok with warriors not paying the hybrid tax?
---
2 1.5 spees weapons attack faster than 1 2.2 speed weapon. Isnt that obvious?
---
That 18 hours will be tripled on relevelling in p2 with everybody ganking everything.
---
I feel you. I wish there was a way to keep the interesting gameplay without the bullshit feeling of dying in the same batch that you're getting a heal. Most prebc veterans also agree that the current implementation feels worse than it did back then - I don't know if that's actually true though. But Blizzard did say that they didn't exactly replicate it, so there might be room for improvement here.
---
Watch someone who plays the game because they love the game and not someone who plays the game because it makes him appear popular.
---
I'll second this - Vishas is really close to the entrance of BRD, and any group doing prisonbreak or (often) arena farm will typically pick her up.
---
DING DING DING DING DING!!! WE HAVE A WINNA!!
---
Plz Step up and claim ur shitty lag as prize!!!
---
Dont forget to deposit your 15 bucks every month for "Server Fees" folks! :)
---
You already mentioned fast weapons, because you are right, a tank can make it work. However a tank gets infinately more rage, therefore you will simply not be able to dump your rage to turn it into threat with a slow 2hander.
---
I am 2hand fury, because I did get OEB and often I find myself critting with BT + WW + 2x WF and now I'm at 100rage and overpower triggers. I try to get rid of my rage, another WF crits and I simply cant dump it.
---
Now imainge a prot warrior with the same problem ONTOP he has the boss damage. He will never get rid of it. 
---
A bit more obscure: There are no +weaponskill items for 2handers apart from the built in one in OEB which is too slow.
---
The best TPS combos currently are Quelserrar + some OH + Edgemasters and Perds + CHT + aged core hound gloves. This gives so, so much more threat than any 2hander you can throw at it.
---
Exploits are not problematic simply because of the complexity in fixing them.
---
Yeah I saw I typed "trait" for some reason after I posted it. Didn't bother to edit it. Thanks.
---
Volunteers... lol. They had deals with a ton of gold selling websites where they legit spawned gold for them to sell for a major profit. How else do you think 100g was only $8 on private servers? I know it sucks but I'm not wrong. Read the other comments below.
---
Pretty sure assassins blade is also bis for a 19 twink.
---
Crusader is the best enchant for both. Fiery is the poor man's choice because it's 10g vs crusaders 80g.
---
You want assassins blade OH because it's a faster weapon. Which is ideal for hiring casters
---
It's all dungeons
---
Disagree. Anyone can start a group. Social connections and being good at recruiting is a lot more important than your role, in my experience. Like I said, tanks have it easiest, but all roles can do it, IF they put in the effort. 
---
If you can't form a dungeon group as a dps during peak hours, you're doing something wrong. If it's off hours, I can sympathize, but it's still possible with the right effort.
---
Hunters aren't on my list of end game alts, so I haven't dove deep into the whys and wherefores.  Just offering a different angle.
---
everybody wants rogues, we are #1 in dmg dude and you dont even have to 'try'
---
Yeah I find it insane apparently how many rogues seem selfish on lockpicking (at least in text). In practice most rogues I've grouped up with have been nice on rolling for the chest like anyone else and unlocking it for the winner, as well as occasionally unlocking doors. I feel like lockpicking is literally one of THE biggest reasons to bring a rogue over some other DPS, as it's more loot potential for everyone as well as some interesting options in their toolkit.
---
Gyths only freeze is a frontal cone and the stun lasts 6 seconds
---
All of gyths ability are frontal cone breaths, he shouldn't be facing you
---
Stratholme holy water and r4 holy nova
---
so if i decide i want to reach a point where fury tanking is an option, would you recommend starting off farming my prot tank bis?
---
Oh tanking, you want quick weapons for tanking for smooth, consistent rage generation. you also want to attack quicker so you have more opportunities to crit.
---
they aren't zoning into somewhere though they're only entering your range.  again this did not function this way in vanilla.
---
Agreed. Flying mounts, daily quests, and the death of old zones/wpvp tied to one stupid  zone "Isle of Quel danas" or daily quests. Why do people want to continue making the same mistakes?
---
Didnt retail have the same formula for like multiple expacs? Timeless isle, tol barad,  isle of quel danas, argus, it goes on and on... 
---
TBC is the first retail experience which WoTLK cranked into overdrive. Can't change my mind.
---
I’m just saying that you shouldn’t be running around out in the open world with your raid gear on. You equip your raid gear when you get in the raid/dungeon.
---
Wait till the power guilds start doing Nefarion attempts  on the same night :)
---
THAT will be just like classic lol
---
It does matter because you can only pick one "tree" at a time.
---
You still run into the same thing, though. If you're going frost as a mage, for example, you're going to want to push down to get Ice Barrier. So every time you level up, you'll be putting a point into the frost tree, and will choose among some number of available talents. And just like retail (actually, MORE than retail), there are plenty of absolute garbage talents that are super situational that you'll almost never use - like Frost Warding.
---
I even get bad lag when getting an ony buff at peak hours, can't imagine when everyone there is actually casting spells
---
Will this show any player around you what they are casting and when or just who you’re targeting?
---
"we already experience 6k queues on peak days at peak times" damn bro that's amazing people are still waiting in those
---
The thing that is frustrating about Warrior DPS is that almost all loot is given to MS (Tanks) leaving you with little opportunities for loot. Also, there is usually a good amount of dps wars in the raid reducing your chances even further.
---
Lmao. I once saw a young orc struggling in the Badlands. I’m a lvl 60 nelf just getting my mining up. I feel bad so I dismount and sling a couple arrows into his target to help him out. 
---
Did I accidentally use multi shot to finish the mob and the orc? The world may never know.
---
That's what killed pvp for me too. Hated arena, did the bare minimum 10 per week to get some points for the best gear so i could go back to world pvp, bgs. Completely immersion killing too. Also hated resillience but thats another issue
---
Lol!
---
I don't know what the combat log was like in vanilla, but if for some reason the modern version of it is more expansive, then I agree a combat log nerf would be warranted. Spy is not the only addon that uses the combat log to do "unfair" things. Another good example would be the addon that shows enemy buffs (though they must be applied while you are in range), which previously was only possible with Detect Magic.
---
Awesome, thanks for the info! First time mage player (ran a warlock from TBC through Cata) and I'm still getting myself sorted when it comes to how to prioritize PvP. 
---
Also, thanks for the reminder to keep a down ranked Frost Nova bound. I can shift+frostbolt for a R1 bolt but I've just been using maxed nova for everything and wasting mana for not much damage increase.
---
Pretty sure Blackcrow crossbow is better than yours even as a troll
---
Literally from my old guild The Collective, probably even back when they were The Night Elf Collective.
---
They turn into Greater Magic Wand with 1 simple wood, which vendors for 15s 36c.  You can level to 150 enchanting and make a profit on my server.
---
It does try to but sometimes fails as far as I understand. And it keeps records of all players  you have ever met so it knows their level by regonizing the names. 
---
Also pretty sure the combatlog was changed with classic because I don't recall that feature, could be wrong tho. 
---
Anyway IMO knowing there's a mage casting frostbolts and what lvl they are 80 yards away is just stupid, regardless if it's an addon telling you or yourself making that deduction.
---
With bis gear, engineering and consumables maybe. Your average world PvP encounter I'll easily take rogue because realistically how many people are going to walk around with an inventory full of matchup specific potions / trinkets and be willing to spend 10 or 20 gold worth of shit every 1v1 fight. I don't think there's much practical application to considering high end consumables when talking about class matchups, but that's only my opinion. 
---
I consider rogue the counter to warlock until post BWL gear, when Warlocks practically become raid bosses in 1v1
---
&gt;So you read that and at no point thought they were talking about the business of new customers vs old customers?
---
The quote about retaining customers doesnt refer to customers already lost which was the point being made. The person insinuated that they are aiming to bring back old customers that had left and I said it was a mistake. You talk about retain ability vs chasing new potential customers but that doesnt apply at all to this argument because its not about retain ability, they already lost those customers.
---
Nobody is comparing keeping current customers to chasing new ones, the entire discussion was about a company focusing on trying to reacquire old customers who have moved on from them as opposed to going after a new larger market entirely.
---
You seem incredibly hellbent on interpreting this entirely incorrectly because you are far too stubborn to just admitting you are wrong.
---
Oh well, its best not to engage further.
---
i never asked for fury tank pre bis, i asked if such a list existed. im simply a noob looking for general knowledge on the matter which people were kind enough to berate me with.
---
There's no huge emphasis. It's just fun having lots of buffs. Big numbers, many funs.
---
I think the math put crusader ahead of lifestealing for level 19. I could be wrong though
---
I'm with you, four bars from 47 as of last night.
---
I seriously doubt it's a hardware problem; pretty much any company would buy their way out of a problem like this if it were possible.
---
expecting that many people to unsub is a bit unrealistic. 
---
people might not like what they've being served, but they're still gunna eat it and ask for more. 
---
Until everybodies personal benefit is less than the cost to make change, than nobody is going to do anything.
---
We do MC around 2 and a half hours at the moment without world buffs, but there are DPS that try hard and use Flasks and elixers. We could easily hit 2 hours flat or less if we cut out boss fight explanations for the new guys, and sped up our loot rolling. 
---
We will probably do the felwood and Ony buffs for BWL just to make sure to down the Guild Breaker, but that is the main reason for it.
---
Ok, so you are correct, any fight that has a threat reduction, but not a threat elimination, is tankable by a paladin of sufficient skill and preparation. Scholo is definitely tankable but a paladin. I was more speaking of the general situation of a complete threat drop.
---
Fuck some servers that don't have queues as bad as gehennas lag for a couple mins (you literally can't log out for 2mins) when ony buff comes out. And that's fucking ally side Herod, I'm sure horde will crash the server on a Tuesday once layering is gone
---
Until then you will just be the scub with wtf gear.
---
Personally, I am of the opinion that at MC gear level, fury tanking isn't worth the risk without full world buffs. Without that stam cushion, and with the reduced armor from no shield for shield block to reduce the amount you are crit, and from weaving in mail pieces for agi and hit, you are in danger of dying. I've noticed that as long as world buffs are rolling the tank is pretty safe but if he dies (say from getting crit a few times in a row...) he's much less safe after that. So IN MY OPINION, at this gear level where Bloodthirst isn't actually generating more threat than shield slam, fury tanking isnt that much more threat (yet).
---
THAT SAID, suppose you have a raid full of big dicks who can't be contained by a prot build. ok. so youre now grabbing Enrage in order to produce more threat.  why use DW over 2h? Well as above, there's smoother rage gen, more heroic strikes (which is more threat), more frenzy procs.
---
But in terms of the specifics, should you use quel serrar+DRoff, or should you use OEB, for tanking? Well the answer imo would be to not give OEB to the tank in the first place. youre gonna want that OEB throwing executes from the DPS warrior. 
---
n.b. I am not an expert and am merely giving my opinion on the matter, I will be the first to admit I could be wrong. But when I imagine tanking with a 2h, the #1 thing I fear is the slow start. If your first thing gets parried, and then you can't manage to fish a crit cause your attack speed is so slow, youre gonna be later in getting Frenzy going, which defeats the purpose of being Fury in the first place. Basically if you have a slow start with a 2h, it's going to compound on itself. By that same token, if you have a fast start with a DW setup, *that's* going to compound on *itself*. And imo, it's very important to have a fast start when tanking because you need your threat to skyrocket as fast as possible if you've got a whole raid behind you wanting to blow up the boss ASAP
---
Noggenfogger is a funny name
---
16 debuff slots and none are going to be from sub
---
I leveled a lock, and for a brief moment was grouped with a feral Druid who tossed me some heals, and it was glorious.
---
A lock isn’t great for pulling every mob in site and aoe’ing them down all at once. It’s the ability to chain pull without downtime due to life tap and incoming heals. Full dots on a mob, next target. Keep moving. 
---
Paladin role should be to use consecrate where applicable, auto attack and keep the warlock alive with heals. Use mana to offset lifetap. 
---
Have the lock spec for drain tanking in affliction. Corruption, agony, siphon life and immolate when possible will kill most mobs around your level and a little lower. The benefit/speed of the healer/lock combo is that the lock can life tap and non stop chain pull. 
---
I’m not familiar with classic paladin talents, but if there’s a way to spec for mana efficiency, I’d suggest that. You should be a full on support role. 
---
Drain life will help offset your healing required and when you’re oom/drinking.
---
Also Horse on Kritonos. Having a great time leveling. Horde heavier, but Alliance are very hostile at times. It's pretty amusing, can't wait for World PVP
---
It's good you like the retail talent trees. I prefer classic ones. Lots of people are divided on these things. 
---
Neither one of us are going to convince the other. /tip hat
---
You sub prime fucks that should have never buying a house in the first place are the ones that destroyed the housing market.
---
I dont think they make laws for WoW. Would probably be why.
---
I mean, I’m a tribal leatherworker at level 54 and cornered that market pretty well. I have my 3 piece black dragonscale already and both devilsaur pieces. All enchanted fully. I got lucky forsure money wise, so I’ll take your word for it that it is more difficult for most people lol. Plus my buddy had the boots pattern so no fee there :)
---
lol, stay bad buddeh
---
&gt; you'll notice them stand still for a second and porting forward as they both get loaded in on the new shard
---
I've noticed this when I'm multiboxing, didn't realize this was why.
---
Don’t like the truth then change yourself - despite what you turds tell each other, it’s the only thing you have a right to change...and damn do you need to.
---
Hardcore no lifer = not awful at the game? Interesting. 
---
You do you man, at least if the boss self-heals it won’t be a full heal.
---
&gt;"you think youdo but you don't"
---
Dude is president of Blizzard so.....
---
Warrior has more tools for tanking and specs for tanking.  Feral has that nice "Do it all" quality where you can heal if you want to.  I leveled a warrior before and tanking as one is a lot of fun.  I'm doing a druid this time and it has its merits especially as a main.  I only ever pally tanked in TBC but I always felt it was super boring (though effective to be sure).
---
Druid's got a bunch of cool spells but especially when tanking, shifting out to use both them and consumables can be risky business because while out of bear you lose your massive armor buff.  With a warrior you can stance dance and burn consumables while having more abilities at your immediate disposal.
---
So the choice becomes specialization or variation. 
---
If you aren't sure what you want to do I would go with warrior they have access to more items and more skills for tanking.  If you want to heal, like the idea of stealth on occasion, need an easier solo experience for leveling or just really like the idea of staring at bear ass for a long time then Druid is great.
---
You can only get 13% with pre-raid BiS, and you can't use most of it when tanking.
---
He atoned for his guild’s sins: https://youtu.be/jyLVgmdCHWM
---
I know Warcraft Logs supports classic Guilds, so you can see the first/fastest/whatever guilds on your server, but only if they upload their logs publicly, and have them set up as being from their Guild.
---
Just click the Classic checkbox next to the search function, and search for your server.
---
There might be other solutions, but I don't know.
---
As a tank, I value rogues who:
---
1. Focus fire skull
---
2. Use stuns instead of trying to ‘top meters’
---
3. Help interrupt casters.
---
That is all.
---
Yea, I bought the book on the AH for 45s, so figured why not. Every other classes books were going for between 2-15G.
---
I heard there is a way to spam Jed runs? Something about forming a raid group, then each member leaves and /target jed until one gets a hit, then they invite all members back and run the instance. Does that work?
---
I read somewhere that grinding the city bosses in small groups viable
---
Pretty much yeah. Because you basically try to outweigh the amount servers are shit by paying more for their processing ability
---
Yep, the last few streamers i watched doing wpvp in raids at BRM was just a frozen screen for 25 seconds with aoe everywhere, then 10% show dead, then frozen screen of aoe, then 30% dead. then the streamer dead. I really hope they figure it out.
---
What a dumb fucking post.
---
As stated *many* times before it reads the combat log.
---
LOL, not even close. I play 1-2hrs a Day since I have my 2nd 60.
---
Shadowfang on fairbanks doesn't even sell for 9g. I know because I went through that process already.
---
You have two options: 
---
Mind soothe your way around the top and kill 3 packs of bugs
---
Go through the courtyard by aggroing all the dogs up to the ledge, and then run across as they're about to reach you. When you get to the other side, jump to the ramp. You can mind soothe the boss as you're running so he doesn't also aggro you.
---
When I actually fought the boss I just jumped on and off the rock, and when he came back I would reapply SW:P and try to LoS him as I jumped back to the rock in order to avoid his charge.
---
How are people selling dungeon runs for gear when it's a random drop chance? I've seen ads for Briarwood Reed 150g, Rend MH, etc. This would require you to run along with them and hope it drops eventually with it being looted to you guaranteed, is that right? I'm just trying to figure out how they do it when gear is random unlike Tribute where anyone can loot it.
---
wow classic also had multiple full world/layer crashes during the first month. or did you forget?
---
this is exactly why blizzard implemented battlegrounds.  wpvp crashed the servers in vanilla.
---

Hey man, the sooner you recognize that your death is real and inevitable, and that death renders all life absurd and meaningless, the sooner you can be happy and fulfilled.
---
Quel'Serral is 2.0, Dal Rend's offhand is 1.8, that's a total swing time of 3.8, which is slower than Bonecrusher which is 3.0.
---
Flying mounts dailies tokens hallway dungeons spaceships and hideous zones.
---
Ya nope.

Druid lvl 53 here, been using respec a lot while leveling to see what fits me best. I prefer a moonglow build where I have decent balance damage, but can still heal all dungeons, but I can not seem to find a Pre-BiS guide for that spec? Is is the same as resto? Any help and advice on the class/spec is greatly appreciated! Want to focus mainly on pvp as phases roll out, but that will be a secondary focus while I get through the current raids and dungeons.
---
They run the dungeon as many times until you get it essentially.
---
Druids have some of the best buffs in the game
---
Yeah you have everyone run in the instance while not in a group, so that everyone gets a unique dungeon. Each person runs up to a certain corner where jed is able to be targeted, and you do this over and over until someone gets one, then that person invites everyone else to go inside that specific instance.
---
i mean.. that's what the game was... we're here to play the original game, if you don't like it go find a modded vanilla server :/ there are places that cater to what you want to play
---
Yup exactly this. Spy relies on your combat log to tell you stuff, and stealthed characters / actions while stealthed won't show in someone else's log. Someone going stealth nearby will, though.
---
To answer OPs question, it's "legal" because Blizzard isn't going to remove the combat log. If they did, many other add-ons would break.
---
Transfered from stalagg to hearthseeker, went from 80:20 Horde to maybe 75:25 Alliance... So I feel you!
---
it doesn't seem fair that I can only downvote this once
---
Please activate windows
---
Actually, a well made blade would be finely balanced at the hilt to blade regardless of size.
---
You chose that guild name on an RP server?
---
The Beyond Redemption Guild? For people beyond redemption? Sounds like silly RP.
---
If your goal is generating threat, you want to cast as many heroic strikes as possible. This is best with a pair of 1H since your main hand is faster and you waste less rage with each heroic strike. Also, at equal weapon ilvl, dual wielding does more white dps and more rage per second. Last but not least you can switch from dual wield to 1h + shield in one GCD. It requires 2 GCD if you start from a 2H.
---
wpvp had the same problem in vanilla.  blizzards fix was battlegrounds.  they get everyone spread out across different servers.
---
He is a legend, please award that man loot priority for me.
---
Chests that aren’t fully looted despawn in 5 minutes.
---
Don’t look at PoE then
---
Paladins are equally as good if not better than priests for PvP and pve.
---
Druids are the worst healer but still have a vital role to play and shaman play offensively in PvP.
---
I honestly can see Blade of Hanna work. 2.1 speed, +5 sword skill by human. Did not know it is THAT fast. Thought it's at 2.6. speed.
---
Typhoon no. It's much too slow. As horde you want slow weapons to have abilities like revenge trigger high damage white hits from Deathbringer. 
---
As alliance you want fast weapons spamming HS.
---
You can always do them on the same day, and 2 weeks out of 7 you'd have to kill ony an extra time.
---
This is what park Mage performance looks like.
---
Sometimes there's an obvious lag when you move into a new zone, especially if you're flying.
---
Plasma wasn't hitscan it was just a fast moving projectile.
---
nice dress mate
---
I make a killing selling the Black Dragonscale set on my server.
---
With that said, while not BiS, it's close enough that it doesn't matter.
---
My setup is the same as your list, but with Carapace Spine x-bow (w/o 3% hit)
---
I mean they can just have a VM that has more resources dedicated than a normal shared server for example no? I don't see why you'd need dedicated hardware if you run a single VM
---
I'd argue that levitate is one of the most crucial spells if you are horde. You need it for 1k and water walking and the zeplins. Don't skip levitate. Better skip fade.
---
The subreddit can be literally only posts complaining about this and Blizzard wouldn't care as long we are all still paying the subscription. 
---
It really is that simple; until their internal metrics show enough people quitting in response to these issues they are not going to spend any additional money to fix them. People can complain all they want but if you are still paying $15 a month Blizzard does not give a single fuck.
---
gotw/motw isn't better than fort + saving yourself a 8 minute run, and the group 1-2 minute per death in reduced clear speed after any death-resulting mistake.
---
This is amplified if you have a warlock that provides your group with total wipe protection with a SS
---
As a Level 33 Hunter I feel like I‘m a little too underlevelled for anything but the very beginner quests in STV. I can kill Mobs 3 Level above me, even two of them at once but I don‘t feel it‘s very efficient. Where should I go to before coming back for the Big Game Hunter quest line? Desolace or Arathi?
---
2hrs a day equates to less than 6 days played over the last two months. Am I misunderstanding  you? Didn't know it was possible to do 1-30 in three days played.
---
It doesn't tell you there are invisible players near you, it tells you when a player in render range goes into stealth.
---
retail bad upvote plz
---
These clips are single handedly killing my motivation to play this game. World PVP was THE feature I was playing Classic for. Need word from Blizz ASAP.
---
Nostalrius shut down years ago. There are still private servers. Right now WotLK realms are hot but I'm still playing on 2 vanilla servers: Kronos which has a low pop and Turtle WoW, a very small server that makes custom content out of unused Vanilla game files. Today I [raced on the Raceway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5gvq_qcaT0)
---
It's because your critical heals give you back the mana it cost to cast them. If you got a lucky string of crits you can be sitting at full mana topping the healing meters while everyone else is running low. It's really nice for dungeon groups, too, because divine favor + big heal = a lot of healing for 0 mana spent, and with a decent tank you can invoke the 5 second rule enough that you just never have to stop to drink.
---
&gt; Thats why i support Star Citizen and am helping to make the game I WANT to play in 2050:)

WoD3 and I think you to get that name right
---
You haven't met the Muja have you?
---
This dude RPs so hard, he RPs in real life. Had him in discord and his roommate/wife/girlfriend/IDK said they were running to the store and asked if he wanted anything.
---
His response was to yell back:
---
&gt; Muja Muja!
---
2 deaths, not 2 wipes.
---
Can you talk about 2 things?
---
1. 2h or 1h+shield? (if it varies by match ups, which?)
---
2. Do you take the 8 points of shield talents and 3/3 imp righteous fury?
---
Paladins for alliance and priest for horde
---
Personally don't like shamans as pocket healers since they don't have dispel
---
Ok. That sounds comforting. So if i understand correctly, mining just takes time but the profit usually pays off in the end?
---
So you're saying it will just be Mages AoE farming warriors?
---
I just like bows hehehe. I know the xbow is better but I’m a nerd who values aesthetics (although those are wildly subjective)
---
Foreshadowing to who's the true evil behind void lords.
---
Also you can see this zone nonsense happen when you run from burning steppes into BRM, you'll have a brief lag at a certain point while people enter the new zone
---
Sorry I came off as not-calm due to my first sentence. As you probably read I also believe that you might not be able to throw more hardware on the issue and solve it. And yeah I did interpret what you said to be talking about the game client (wow.exe + libs) itself. Cheers.
---
\#GrobMob!
---
Would you consider it a fair 1v1 if the stealth class is ready to engage and the warlock isn't? I am assuming bare minmum both classes starting at 100% and the lock has a pet out. You can sac while stunned and boom 2k hp shield which is likely enough health to survive the opener. And on my server faps and lips are between 1.1 and 1.25. Not 10g per fight, but that might be true on your server. Whatever, this is a stupidly conjectured fight where either of us can assume one class has the upper hand.
---
Ah. I wondered why you didn't use thorium point, but I guess it don't have an innkeeper
---
I love rogue. Started as a gnome rogue over 10 years ago, switched to BE rogue in BC, and now I'm an orc rogue in classic. Its such a fun class, I love all my somewhat gimmicky but also useful abilities. I got lucky with a blue mace drop (wilts third leg) and went mace spec for the first time ever and been having a blast with it.
---
I've also gotten grumpy groups that are at first like, oh great, a rogue. In the end they seem to lighten up after they realize I have my head in the game and am generally responsive to my surroundings.
---
Blame dwarf bots scouring the land opening chests. They nerfed the shit out of chests before 1.12.
---
The Game is 70 days old (Europe), let’s say the average to level 60 is around 7 days /played then you need about 2.5h each and every single day since launch to spend on WoW. If you have a family, a job, and hobbies beside wow that is actually a lot. Also consider that probably a lot of the people didn’t play directly since launch day (like myself) so take another 10 days off for example. Respect if you were able to manage this with family/job/hobbies but I guess those people had to sacrifice quite a lot for that, be it sleep, their hobbies,  or their relationship.
---
&gt; ....since I have my 2nd 60
---
L2R, Kid!
---
Happened last night at around 6pm on my server.  the head dropped amd everyone in org was froze for a good 5 mins.
---
Dustwallow also shit the bed when 3 raid groups flew in at once.
---
I originally joined groups as dps first and watched where my tanks went first then I tanked when I was comfortable with where I was going
---
I'm worried that the bar for twinking will be a lot higher in Classic. In TBC it wasn't too hard to dominate with mostly the best AH greens. But I think this time around everyone will be in absolute BIS and twinks will feel less powerful.
---
That's kind of you to misinterpret my post and assume I'm bad. I'm referring to every horde warlock pvp video where they're using fear and seduce as a complete crutch
---
Any advice on Pally tanking I’ve never actually done it. I probably should have been tanking earlier dungeons...
---
Try getting a number anymore.  It’s impossible
---
I understand what You mean - when youre human it feels bad Not going swords and waste the racial. 
---
Im actually alliance and all rogues except 1 are dagger specced. If You have aged core Hands or distracting dagger You also get the Bonus weapon skill to get to human skill.  
---
Ive Played both, dagger and sword. I had scarlet kris and bonescraper - farmed dal rends and specced sword recently, but im definetly doing less dmg in raids with swords.
---
This part of the combat log hasn't changed from Vanilla. Carbonite has the same functionality but it calls it "punks"
---
I mostly wanded them since I didn't have holy nova and immo oil still makes you take a fair bit of damage.
---
That's why I promised myself I would not start leveling any alts until I hit 60 on my main. I managed to not have any alt above level 6 by the time I hit 60.
---
yeah but 2004 hardware and 2019 hardware are a lot different lol
---
it most certainly did not
---
Thanks! So if Gyth is properly turned away, only MT should get frozen and then it is immediately dispelable by a priest, right?
---
You can. Imagine you schedule 20 runs. It doesn't drop. You do another 20 and don't sleep.
---
A "normal" pop realm will still lag to fucking hell and beyond if there's even a raid vs raid happening, which if you want a ****normal**** pop realm means there's probably going to be a couple guilds on each faction going for a world boss if it's up during normal times. Let alone on a Tuesday raid night or others
---
This stupid sharding technology makes retail wow a laggy mess in outdoor content too. Sometimes even just doing world quests I end up with a 1-2 second delay on spellcasts.
---
What commands are you putting in if you have a chatbox with filters open.
---
Man, so many online at 3 in the end. I wish our guild was that active.
---
Pretty sure the blame usually lies with the faction that has undead, and therefore undead rogues.
---
The fact that you can brick a character might mean your choices matter, but it also means they’re not really choices at all. There’s a right answer and a wrong answer. So you google what the right answer is and you pick that. That’s the definition of fake complexity.
---
I know that. But it never registered to me that I was gaining anything. There were several underwhelming options spread across columns and rows. It just felt like a chore more than something cohesive and mysterious, like it was just a game routine and the outcomes while different, never amounted to anything spectacular or unique.
---
It's confusing in the sense that they rewrote the book on talent trees in RPGs and it came out a mess. It's a kid gloves talent system that doesn't register with long-time players.
---
Your silly or meme-like name can be flagged for rename, basically thats all
---
useless when you have a warlock, though.
---
How much different?  
---
... 9 different.

---
&gt; too many warriors in this subreddit with no sense of urgency
---
The only sense of urgency that most people have in this game, comes from their sick dream of AFKing in Org or UC, while wearing tier 6 on their mount, while everyone else there drools over them in awe.
---
&gt; (one mob at a time???)
---
I will tank two if I am using a 2h; I will only tank 3 or more if I am wearing a shield.  I actually do want more than one mob at a time, because I use adds as rage batteries.  I am, however, conscious of my healer, and I don't want to put too much stress on them, because I actually care about other people.  I know that's seriously last millenium of me.
---
&gt; refusing to adapt to realistic tanking scenarios
---
"Realistic tanking scenarios," don't include sociopathic Zoomers who don't care about anyone but themselves.  I only just spent two hours doing the ZF mallet quest in the Hinterlands, tanking for a part of mature adults who I had known previously, and there were zero issues.  The Mages didn't open with Pyroblast, and the Priest wasn't spamming Mind Blast at everything in sight.  Yet I also still held threat, sometimes on 3-5 mobs at once, and all of said mobs died.
---
Stop defending bad pug DPS, and trying to shift the blame to us.
---
About to turn 60. I've started doing runs for attunements and getting better gear. As a rogue, I found I get accepted to more groups a lot faster if I say "Rogue dps, won't roll on (insert common bis item people grind for)". I've come to accept taking 2nd or 3rd bis items or forming groups with friends/guildmates if I really want something like HoJ.
---
I'm Horde side so at least most warriors are Orcs rolling on axes.
---
I just hit 175 as of this comment I’m on the FP to searing gorge to do some more mining before i head to work later.
---
As a prot paladin (while leveling), I love grouping with a resto druid.  Lack of res doesn't matter to me.
---
Both
---
If you compare Quel'Serral/Dal rend combo with OEB, you end up with dual wielding taking 3.8 seconds to complete and 2h taking 3.4 seconds.  So wouldn't you get more HS with the 2h since it only works off your main hand?
---
We clear ony and mc in two hours on one night. I’d be surprised if the entire raid spent that much on consumes lol.
---
I hope you’re in a pointless tryhard guild and saving another 30 mins doing that lol.
---
World PvP is one of the few reasons I play WoW. Please Blizz, this is embarrassing.
---
Labor costs, initially infrastructure costs, maintenance costs. We were discussing going to all physical servers. Obviously my numbers are just random, like I stated at the beginning. It 100% could be under a million but also, it doesn't matter to the overall statement. Network Engineers are 100% not server guys, like I stated...so you're right, these are all spitball comments based off my experiences in and around data centers to help justify a counter argument to your complaint of "This needs to be fixed, it's easy but I have no solution to offer".
---
again, I don;t really care about your ideas about why it wont happen. you can stop trying to explain them to me
---
It was to make it so everyone was on an evening playing field when one person has 47ms and the other has 1400ms latency
---
You're not *that* casual if you were 60 two weeks ago.
---
Vanilla was a game changer and incredible for it's time given the circumstances, remember hindsight is always 20/20. 
---
Stuff was rushed, and they didn't even know if it was going to be a big hit. MMO's like WoW were still a niche market at the time and some legendary titles were released around that time, they had some serious competition. EQ 2 was launched the same month as WoW (the sequel to the current MMO King), and Star Wars Galaxies was released a year prior.
---
Do the math out and crunch the numbers yourself. 
---
The public opinion on most things is honestly just wrong. I’ve made posts about BiS lists and how they’re wrong for a lot of classes. I show the math, and do a pretty deep dive into it all. 
---
Most people here just respond with a down vote and, “You don’t know what you’re talking about, the websites are correct.” You’re not going to get anything constructive out of Reddit.
---
Yeah, as 1 guy said the problem is lack of tanks.
---
Why?  The only tanks that will run instances are dps warriors who want rogue gear.
---
Add to that the lack of ranged dps in general and large population of rogues and warriors relative to mages/locks and you have this situation.
---
But, again, the problem is easy to solve.  Make friends, run dungeons with them regularly.  Start your own guild and run who you want.
---
If you aren't willling to take responsibility for your own outcomes then you will forever be at the mercy of other people who don't value you.
---
I do this from time to time. When I see an Alliance lowbie killing a mob while on the verge of dying, I stealth up to the mob and kill it instantly. Then I /lick the lowbie and stealth away.
---
Yet the servers still take a shit whenever people PvP with layers. Jfc reddit
---
If you work more than full time, and then accompany a raid schedule let alone a lot of us have a family, it makes it pretty hard to have a life and get decent sleep
---
Just like in actual vanilla, in classic getting into a top raiding guild as a rogue is an accomplishment. And if your guild falls apart, as a rogue...you are fucked. Lighting doesn't strike twice, and getting into a guild of the same level is very hard. You can have the gear and the parses, but in the end you need to know someone or just get lucky.
---
Yeah I don't even train ranks of frost nova beyond 1 basically useless. Also due to heartbeat mechanics and DR there's not much point in Poly past like rank 2 or 3 in PvP at least. Things you probably want to have R1 versions bound (I too use Shift to do this)
---
* R1 Frostbolt (easy spam slow)
---
* R1 Fireball (put a DoT on that rogue), technically R4 fireball is more optimal for DoT duration 
---
* R1 Cone of Cold (slow applies, much lower mana cost, can also fish for Clearcasting) 
---
* R1 Fireblast (preferably mouseover) good for sniping totems 
---
* R1 Blizzard (low mana AoE slow), good for popping rogues out of stealth from a distance
---
* R1 Arcane Explosion (mostly for spamming if you think a rogue is nearby to pop them out of stealth)
---
&gt;Same damage
---
Per attack, Shadowfang deals 3-6 more damage and with the 0.10 faster attack speed, Shadowfang is 14.44% more weapon DPS than Cruel Barb. Plus the chance on hit for Shadowfang is better than the equip for Cruel Barb, so really Shadowfang is &gt;15% more DPS than Cruel Barb.
---
speaking as someone who pugs 10/10 and 1/1 with kids in greens.  I have to say LOL at this dude
---
Second 60?
---
I’m working on my first 50.
---
&gt; core PVE content
---
World bosses have never been "core PvE content". They're a side-show to the raids. Only a few guilds will have reasonable access to them anyway.
---
Taladril is a joke.   
---
His threat numbers from private servers dont hold up in classic. In fact, the testing was noticeably scuffed in favor of druids even when he did it originally.  
---
Anyone who has played with a good warrior and feral tank knows that feral is shit in this phase.  
---
Skarm stopped playing his druid and plays his warr cause druids are shit. They have some buggy issues that werent on private, and their threat and gear just isn't matching fury's.  
---
Most of the big name, druids from p servers have rerolled warrior.  
---
Have YOU looked around at what class leaders are doing? Or do you only know Taladril?
---
Says the man that turns helms off so we don’t know you’re wearing a silly felt hat
---
Well I see the mechanic of you tools as this:
---
Your Whiney babies that can’t handle life because you were raised so damn poorly and kept away from life until you were just dumped out there and now you can’t even handle “bad man talk”.
---
I member when I was mind visioning someone in blasted lands and they hearthstoned back to stormwind. It didn't break and I could jump mind vision to other people in SW
---
Yeah, honestly Ive been trying.. Haha
---
Keep in mind these squid are seasonal. Only during the interview. They will jump up in price when they are gone.
---
Wait until AQ40 is out mages will look like that to ;)
---
That needs to be tested I think.  I have a hard time believing that a pally tank is actually going to be able to generate more threat vs a single target than a dw fury/prot, but they're definitely going to generate more TPS than a fury/prot vs packs.
---
Do people think classic is on different servers? 
---
Does nobody do large scale pvp in retail? It's garbage and laggy. Welcome to how the entire game is
---
Huh, I thought it was just me. I went through my friends list the other day, and was honestly surprised. It's like 8 Rogues, 3 Pallies, 2 Priests, and a warlock. I couldn't figure out why so many were rogues until I realized they were all rogues I'd met from dungeons.
---
Also, Skarm made this video *before* the GBoK/Righteous Fury not-a-bug was discovered
---
Consider that an entire vanilla realm ran on a 2x2-core 2.2 GHz CPU setup with 6GB of RAM. It's actually quite a feat that with almost 15 years of technological progress, they managed to throw something weaker at the Classic servers.
---
That’s good to know, but I chose this one because on my druid it shows mana while I’m in a non-mana form. Not that I really play my druid, but whatever.
---
Nah going after hit% for DW is uselss for a Hunter and there isn't anything that requires over 9%.
---
they also increased the number of connected clients to remove server ques.  hardware is better but there are a lot more players connected.  im not surprised at all.
---
But if people go to Google and figure things out themselves, most posts here would not exist.
---
the convo isn't about classic's class balance, its about why them trying to make everything equal went wrong.
---
Ally on skeram here. It's rough.
---
All the console sees is /gquit
---
nope.
---
The "client lag", which comes from the abilities costing much more power because of the number of procs, frequency, complexity etc is different in Classic than retail. Classic runs much better than retail on world pvp
---
The main issue comes from servers
---
Best UBRS group I ever had was all melee. I think we had 4 rogues and 2 warriors, was a pretty awesome group.
---
Did you need to use Distract or anything?  Curious if a druid could do it without the extra toolsets the rogue has...
---
Don't me like my dumbass who still gets too excited and tunnel visions on the stats.  I luckily havnt done it on anyone's important gear but a few times now as a priest I've rolled need on leather gear cause it's got like +22 to damage and healing lmao.
---
Servers over crowded as fuck with layering gone. 
---
Nightmare to get anything done outside  tbh.
---
&gt; Pretty much the horde version of alliance spamming Y O U L O S E when 30 of them steam roll over you
---
oh you mean Alliance do spit on you when you kill a warrior and he comes back with a mage and a healer and starts to spam spit on you?    
---
Yeh I know what you mean.
---
1 second less LB casting means a whole life, never skip it. You want Resto up to NS and fill Ele accordingly.
---
Solo (1h+Shield, fast dagger with FT and shock spam), duo and dungeons (healer) all are viable choices
---
I agree with your username, toxic player
---
The Xbows are considerably better by a large margin if that makes a difference. Ancient bone bow does look pretty mean though!
---
This game attracts some serious sperglords.
---
15 is in p3 but 25 is p5
---
Make a macro and add pickpocketing to your openers.
---
Yes, but what are you grinding honor for?
---
By using the word cuck you are advertising yourself as an incel.
---
As an incel your opinion is, by definition, garbage.
---
You do realize that raiding on wow is as much class synergy as it it is fear, right?
---
I’d take a shaman naked with the right spec over a feral Druid in purples with a bad spec.
---
You're just wrong here.  A paladin in full mitigation gear spamming GBoK with Righteous Fury, with those same items, is going to generate more total threat.
---
I’m not your buddy, friend.
---
It's also 2019 so I expect a 15 year old game to actually work and not be worse than it was when it was first released.
---
For me the biggest flaws in retail are the lack of talent customisation, the world does not feel dangerous and the fact that if you work towards some item very hard, it will be worthless when the next expansion hits.
---
Had this happen while pulling the same ogre pack. Even pulled the trolls from the floor below.
---
I got a chuckle outta this
---
People have brought this up for years on retail and blizzard has made statements about “looking into it” but it has never been resolved.
---
Can’t blame him for trying to reset the market. It’s plummeted recently (to my benefit as a broke priest). But it tickled me that it dropped right back to 50g the next day.
---
Did you do full runs doing this? What about chests? I heard chests don't drop Shadowfang or Assassin's blade.
---
It took me two months to hit 60 on my rogue. I don’t like farming/grinding. I only did quests and killed only as many mobs as needed for a particular quest. Sneaked past mobs if I just required to obtain some item etc.
---
I wouldn’t even consider starting an alt any time soon.
---
lol yeah. By that I just meant people that'll actually have level 20 warlocks at every spawn point etc.
---
I'm not on a mission to educate, today, my friend.  The housing market crash was as a result of people who had no business buying a home being sold loans they didn't have a prayer of repaying and on variable interest rates, to boot.
---
Boomers are typically middle class and don't live beyond their means.
---
And I'm a millennial, so let's squash that before it's even a thing.
---
I'm just trying to get my first 60 still so I can stop playing so much and only raid etc. Only level 51 and I'm hitting a leveling wall.
---
Too many other games to playyyyy
---
Or just limit where ppl can xfer from/to
---
You unlock unique gear for reaching higher ranks.
---
It was ruined by the time I was 16 not sure how it's my fault, but ok boomer.
---
Aren't people complaining about similar issues with retail? I mean I guess it' a possibility, where I work we commission server specs and that spec is sealed for 10 years no matter how shitty performance is. I just expect a company like Blizzard would be less stupidly rigid, but you never know
---
Except there is no best build. What passives you take will change based on your gear. While you are playing through the story an experienced player can just go 90% damage and be just fine. If you go too much health you will not have the damage to kill the bosses. Google will not tell you the exact answer. The most you get will be suggestions that may or may not work for you based on how good you are at the game.
---
Watching the Nostalrius videos makes me sad that I wasn’t part of it :(
---
I had no idea real WOW was still alive all these years. I left when they shat out Wrath and didn’t look back.
---
xD Please try that in p2 and report back with what you learned about dishonorable kills after.
---
If I understand it right then no, it doesn't but the way back machine can find it
---
I may be mistaken though.
---
So plenty have offered advice on rotations and things of the sort, and regardless of if I agree with them I'll focus on another topic.

Level. When leveling, if you're going into a dungeon as a tank and you're lower than the average level of the mob you're -going- to lose aggro to any DPS of similar or higher level than you. This is because you're facing the full brunt of level disadvantage with Parries, Dodges, Blocks, and all such things from the front. Not just the misses. The problem here is at least Warriors/Druids can struggle along with taunt. This is then pushed harder when so much of a Paladin's threat is off reflect damage. One series of parries, dodges, or resists and there's no chance you're going to hold aggro. 
---
The reason you felt fine in Graveyard is the levels were more aligned with you. So while you 'can' do Library at your level, I would strongly suggest waiting until 33-34. It will -drastically- affect your experience. As a Tank you really don't want to be going into things at the bar-minimum level required. You can. But you'll feel this every time.
---
this isn't batching
---
I didnt say that you fucking inbreed. I said "Blizzard said that phase 1 was the longest" 
---
Are you unable to understand the concept of time? Do you think phase 2 is gonna last untill february and somehow nullify what blizzard said in the first place?
---
Your threat generation is gonna suck compared to using faster 1hers. You also can't spam out heroic strikes as fast when you need to dump rage.
---
cause you don’t know the difference between VM in a SAN and physical servers.
---
10% increased physical damage and free attacks from 'Omen of Clarity' give you ALOT more threat as tank. Proboly even more considering the 0/30/21 doesnt pick all bear talents right? So imo its slacking hard if you do this for raiding, but for dungeons its no problemo at all.
---
G-unit?
---
Where are you getting 3.8 from? Quel Serrar hits every 2 seconds.
---
I dont know where you were playing in TBC then. the obsession, especially with TBC even more than in vanilla, was having Perfected-out twinks, gurubashi, fishing gear, shadowfang, etc.
---
Try to open the fight casting Judgment of Righteousness on the primary target, and keep Seal of Righteousness up at all times. As long as you have Righteous Fury on, and the other party members are on Blessing of Salvation and hitting the same target as you, you should be keeping the aggro. If you lose it, use Judgment of Righteousness as a pseudo-taunt and only stun it if this doesn't work. Make sure you also had all the ranks on the Improved Righteous Fury talent.
---
Go to retail
---
i want phase 3 or 4 for battlegrounds! give me 72hour altrec valleys!
---
Why does the second list not have devilsaur? Also why use truestrike shoulders? The hit cap is at 11% on that list, the 2% isn't needed lmao. I've never seen that second list before.
---
Probably because you are all too busy killing the horde FP at thorium point... we're just trying to raid damn it!
---
You feeling the need to justify not being level 60 by implying everyone who is are loser neckbeards is your attempt to protect your own fragile ego which is classic narcissism. It’s your attempt to maintain superiority over others.
---
You could but think about how much faster you'll be heroic striking when using a 1.4 MH vs a 2.10 2h
---
Lashers and herbalism. I make good gph on my mage doing it and I haven’t even thrown in the 12 pack of satyrs yet. The gph will go up greatly with that. So it takes me about 8 minutes to kill all the lashers and get all the herbs. Do that 5 times. Play an alt for 30 minutes. That’s what I do. If you just wanna farm farm do Satyrs too but I didn’t like learning them because 5 minutes walking back to try again lol.
---
Any data on this? I used this argument but wherent able to find anything to back this up other than Twitch trend
---
Oh honey...
---
No lol. The offhand doesnt have to wait for the mainhand to finish swinging before starting its timer. Both start the instant you start combat.
---
I recommend early Oxhorn.
---
It doesnt have any bearing on prot pallys, you do it when you have a geared raid and the additional threat from dual wielding, which lets dps go harder, becomes more valuable than the extra mitigation of a shield.
---
Play on a PVE server. High levels killing low levels is part of a PVP server.
---
I wish we could duel because there's no way you force me to heal in cat. Between my heal from sw:p and plague (1.5k total), my shield, and the damage I do to you (2.5k with those two dots in 20sec, without even wanding) and my shield + trinkets, not even feral druids can force me to heal.
---
Check out the druid vs shadow priest duels from the classic tournament, those are some of the best players in that realm and it's so easy for SP
---
There's a pretty huge difference between changing the timing of various releases and changing the core mechanics of a pvp server dude
---
This is probably that one guy who tried to argue that fire spec is viable in MC
---
They left because of your foul attitude.
---
Its WCL
---
Not many more months. We are a few weeks ahead of the actual vanilla timeline. And guess what - the honor system launched in vanilla while people were still leveling and we survived. I didn’t even start until after the honor system and I made it to 60 just fine.
---
You’re just wrong. I’m not bothering to get into this here.
---
I agree entirely with your premise that PI isn't an effective healing ability. 
---
My point is total utility is a function of several variables. If HPS is what constrains your guilds progression, extra mage DPS will not solve your issue. If your metric is 1hr clear, then maybe you're playing in some upper echelon of no-lifers, but there are so many casuals in my guild that the issue isn't HPS OR DPS it's getting new folks to master mechanics and their own classes. It's not selfish lmao, if your prog requires more heals then you're helping, point blank.
---
Really this whole "there's only one way to play" shit is so extremely toxic. I'm just saying that if you look at things holistically it's hardly "decided," depends HEAVILY on context (and preference :)) 
---
I think being a meta-purist for a 15year old game is just a waste of time.
---
Not sure where you found that second list, but it doesn't have devilsaur set so it's wrong.
---
Lol so you played D3 like 4 month ? They removed AH and added all you said above. Also levels are just numbers it's the content you get out of it that's cool not the level themselves
---
no there literally isn't. Hey what if they released blackwing layer tonight? Is that cool? It's just changing the timing NBD.
---
yea I thought so...
---
You should read up on how the API works because what you are claiming is not possible with the limitations given to us.
---
I use the “Details” addon. you can add it up manually but the +25% from spirit is a pain is the arse to calculate
---
And you forget thaT gearing up a guild is about advancing to stronger raids on the backs of weaker ones. 
---
If spriests get Pvp buffed over healers then when you walk into the next raid tier and they eat your tanks face, well.,. You all deserved it.
---
Both MH and OH weapon have their own swing timer which you can observe with a swingtimer addon.
---
This is why you can cast HS to have no miss chance on your OH, once the OH swing is through, but your MH swing did not come through yet, you abort the HS to save rage. This way your OH can not miss anymore.
---
Thanks! Assuming a PUG still collecting pre-raid BiS, how many damage dealers should the raid have for a Rend run?
---
Guns,  the BOOM is so much more satisfying.
---
One is a pickpocket/sap macro, the other is a PvP sap spam macro.
---
Select few, yes.
---
I think this too. So many people trying to twink. If everyone is a twink, no one will be.
---
Are items for 19 PvP selling at high prices yet? I have a bunch of blessed seer staves I picked up for 4-5g each.
---
99.9% of opinion are trash brotha.  The point .01 is mine
---
Aww yeah! Also keep in mind that this works with a flight path. However if you log out and then in again you will for some reason not have a soul shard returned. Which is why you should tell pet to stay, walk far away for it to despawn before logging off. If you log off with a pet out it will not grant you a soul shard however you do this.
---
How are you wearing your pants
---
Thank
---
ok dude whatever lmao
---
Its always the roleplayers fault, true...
---
Sorry but this is wrong.  Ganking will still occur as you won't get dishonor for killing lowbies from what I understand and remember.

Mindblowingly stupid
---
Not enough cannibalization or pvp for my liking...
---
I won’t take a Druid healer. Not worth the headache.
---
It does too.  Prob because he’s been spoon fed gear that should’ve went to the others where it would’ve increased the damage x1000% more.
---
Well tbh there is hundreds of thousands playing Classic and 10 classes - so we definitely get to see all kinds of people but I can definitely say that every few days I see a Mage do something that puts me in pure WTF mode!
---
Like seeing a lvl 46 Mage kite humanoid around while fighting the other.. i asked him why he didn’t polymorph it and he legit didn’t know. 
---
I saw another Mage pull with his wand and start casting Frostbolt, like why would you do that? 
---
Or my all time favourite: I have seen multiple instances of Mages exclusively using AoE spells on single-targets..
---
Im not saying ALL Mage players are dumb, I played a Mage on Pservers for a year before Classic released. But god damn does that class have the worst / lowest skilled players i’ve ever seen before. None of these are exaggerated at all sadly.
---
Those are legs right? Look way too big to be arms
---
There's a guy on Incendius named Towncrier (Horde) that has been posting cross-faction trash talking plain letters on the neutral auction house for 1 copper. 
---
Pretty funny. 
---
______ level 60 horde was ganked by lvl 53 alliance player ______. ______60 could not be reached for comment.
---
Really? Why's that? I've never rolled a lock so I'm not too familiar with their skillset, and I do run with a lock in my normal group. I don't wanna be doing redundant shit
---
Also on whitemane. I think it’s very even personally
---
&gt; Leveling I had to take you guys on runs and it always was rough as hell.
---
Interesting, I'm a mage so I wouldn't see quite as many other DPS, but I've literally only seen one moonkin.
---
This would break 99% of most non-UI mods lol
---
We OSRS now boys, bring Yews to vanilla!
---
garbage ass horde...
---
Good thing I only want to gank with my rogue alt.
---
I'm sure you can provide plenty of benchmarks comparing a physical server from 2005 with a VM in a SAN from 2019.
---
Yeah keeping people alive is super overrated. Giving one guy mana who doesn't even need it on the other hand...
---
i want to go a dwarf pally but theyre like too small for me. and i dont wanna go human because it feels lame
---
Why post yours?
---
nah too many rogues when i LFM UBRS
---
Open up free character transfers to PVE servers once phase 2 launches.
---
It’s not my job to educate you
---
Makes sense
---
Yesterday I hit 60 on my second toon.
---
I’d like to be proud of myself...but it just ain’t right
---
Why post yours!  It goes on and on.
---
I really don't think that's the main issue. A lot of private servers were able to handle it but they were using the old client. I know everybody says Blizz is cheap, but I don't think it's THAT cheap.
---
I love doing this tbh lmao
---
Yeah, but they are being posted so much that I physically can't keep up.  Every time I check there's like 20 more.  It's not going to change any time soon.
---
Think of a drum. Hit that drum with both hands held together every 3 seconds.
---
Now split your hands apart. Tap the drum with your right hand every 2 seconds, whilst also tapping the drum with your left hand every 1.8 seconds.
---
ElvUI
---
&gt; If they've sanitized their public image it's probably because they'd be banned for a more colorful description rather than some attempt to subversively indoctrinate people.
---
They deleted their website and youtube channel because members expressed concerns over losing their jobs if this issue got more exposure. This was said in a recorded discord meeting.
---
its the chance dude, its never coming again. Looks like ur blind. and mad.
---
My bet is arms
---
Username checks out, lol.
---
I’d love to know the answers to this as well. Doing full runs, and are you looting chests?
---
This is why you bring a ret pally, shadow priest, or shaman to your group.
---
Its really not trouble for me when I heal on my druid, most groups already know what the deal is and will run back if necessary.
---
Oh no!  So much free money, what are we to do!
---
Lol come on man, the more you talk the more it becomes apparent you really have no idea what you're talking about. Who are you trying to fool. Labor costs? Infrastructure costs? Maintenance costs? They rent these servers, but build them in their company building.
---
And it is easy to fix and I do have a solution to offer. Spend the monthly subscription fee we're paying them for server upkeep on better servers. The amount these servers cost to rent is not some unknown factor. You know how hard they're probably laughing right now because of the profit margins Classic has. 
---
Almost all of the initial cost of investment was spent 15 years ago and now they're just raking in easy profits. They most likely spent virtually nothing on Classics development. Just the salaries of a small team of coders porting it over to the newer client. They obviously didn't think it was going to be nearly as big as it turned out to be, the proof being the amount of servers they initially had for each region on launch.

Forget large scale pvp, server cant even handle 2raids getting onyxia buff
---
Honestly sorry to say this but what a massive waste of time if you don't include standard talents and at the very least the healing power scaling of the abilities.
---
You won't learn anything from this because the efficiency of deranking comes from having the same scaling as max rank abilities..
---
&gt; And why is that? It was the only one with actual players then, and the one whose players they wanted paying subs in classic, only to replace it with laggy as fuck servers that cant handle large scale pvp, awesome. 
---
Yeah, nice tangent AND straw man. The point is that you literally said all private servers were closed when only Nostalrius was closed. After Nostalrius, many popular servers surfaced, such as Kronos and Elysium. It's blatant you're talking straight out of your ass since you're basically saying those servers didn't have actual players when in reality they were very popular too. 
---
&gt;  only to replace it with laggy as fuck servers that cant handle large scale pvp, awesome. 
---
Literally not the point of the callouts. Read your comment slowly since it's not your first language.
---
&gt; Still wanna know what factually incorrect in my comment though, as I only said "pservers were closed" and you have the proof that at least one of them was. 
---
Do you know the definition of plural?
---
"Private servers were closed", no, only Nostalrius was close. Factually incorrect. Get it now?
---
&gt; Now please press the downvote button again, seems it's the only thing you can actually accomplish. 
---
Aight imma' keep doing that. Seems like someone takes purple arrows personally :)
---
DKs are from killing civilians which is what a lot quest giving NPCs are.
---
Are you doing full runs? And are you looting chests?
---
Just about to start the grind in my 60 Mage
---
They’re actually playing it low and slow to get people to really snap and get into Shadowlands.  Just wait.  
---
They’ll release a few teasers that make Shadowlands look more like classic while simultaneously sabotaging more pieces of classic and then bam, huge player base conversion.
---
ElvUI. Spend 15 minutes getting to know the add-on package and it had everything you need, in most cases.
---
Blizzard probably uses containers nowadays. They're similar to VMs but don't emulate the entire hardware. In fact, they don't emulate anything at all. A single kernel can run multiple containers and each container thinks it's running on its own, isolated system. 
---
This makes them far less resource-demanding than traditional VMs and they can be spun up and shut down in just seconds.
---
This was epic.  I agree too because I've literally been In groups where my fellow horde members were like "that alliance is cool and helping us, dont attack him" what the actual f*ck.
---
The proc is just a small bonus, the additional damage is probably irrelevant.
---
Darrowspike is recommended for its high average damage. The 30 AP boosts Bonescraper by about 2 DPS but the benefit to Backstab from Darrowspike is greater.
---
I would certainly offhand the Distracting Dagger.
---
More like 20, but I see what you're getting at lol
---
No.  It’s sometimes the hunter/ locks let too, but usually mages.
---
Sure, 1 ring can be BIS for pvp, but that's only counting the 1% of the time it procs and actually saves you. Not to mention, if you're a mage and losing to melee, you need hard stats, not a ring with a 1% chance to save you that can probably be resisted.
---
If we removed that proc, the ring is mediocre and there are plenty of better choices as someone mentioned in another reply. Don't get me wrong, the ring is great. I would just much rather have 500+ gold than have 2 of these on. People can have other opinions, that's fine too.
---
Think BRD when going to the big fire lava molten golem dude. As you are clearing various mobs and pats there are times when the mobs on the other side will mobilize and walk across the way and often to where you are currently fighting. Generally ends up in a wipe. 
---
It's not like some amazing thing that you will be requested to do all the time. But those moments with you can bring that utility will feel that much more useful. 
---
I play shaman and we have an ability called far sight. Seeming kind of useless it let's you view an unlimited distance outside and can be continuously recast to view further and further away. There has been several times this came into use for a group when hunting for an elite who pats instead of having to count myself dealing with mobs and terrain.
---
i like trying to get into UBRS groups, all i need is the damn skinning knife. 
---
people can clearly see im running perd/CHT but still dont believe im not gonna roll on dalrends.....
---
Yep. They were pushing for arena to be an esport and balanced heavily for it.
---
Hang in there, 51-60 went way faster than 40-50
---
Can't wait to have people waste their gold on potions and bombs in order to kill me. Even though they don't need either, honestly.
---
I've got one kid and a full time job and my main is level 17 lol
---
I wouldn’t necessarily say that rolling hunter is a good way to find groups more quickly.  In my experience my 5mans usually only want 1 leather dps and are usually more interested in having none in favor of classes with more utility.  When we do look for a leather dps though, 9/10 times we are looking for a rogue for lockpicking and saps.  I’ve just never said “sweet we have a hunter in our group” because there’s just never been a time where they’ve brought more value than another class.
---
With that said though, if you roll a hunter you’ll have an easier time playing solo than you are now as a rogue so that’s at least a plus.
---
Which is why I rolled a shadow priest this time around, but I still can't help but feel bad for the people who try.
---
15 years ago when WoW first launched however, when people see paladin on a character creation screen, a lot of people definitely see a stalwart defender with a shield.
---
I know it's a fool's errand to be a competitive tank with a paladin after all these years, but I still that wish it isn't.
---
The vanilla/classic talent trees weren't a problem for players, they were a problem for the developers.  It is very, very difficult to balance multiple types of gameplay with talents as diverse as what was originally available.  Hybrid builds can result in some crazy, unintended consequences.
---
This big reason talent trees were first limited by having to choose a spec and then no hybrid points until you hit the 41-point talent, and then limited by having only one tree for a spec, is because it allowed Blizzard to design raid encounters much better.  They could be sure that melee DPS, ranged DPS, tanks or healers were actually in those roles - and target or limit raid actions based on that.  So the game has sacrificed a bit of uniqueness in the talents trees for what is arguably a much better raid experience.
---
I don't know if you've done this already but here are the changes I make to give myself more keybinds:
---
* Move your Strafe Left/Right keys from Q/E to A/S and unbind turn left/right (use the mouse to turn). This gives you two new keys
---
* Switch run forward (W) to (S) and switch Backpeddle (S) to Ctrl-S (or Shift-S or something). You generally don't need to backpeddle very often and almost never in PvP (really you only want to backpeddle if you're trying to reduce the leeway mechanic) so there's no need for an "easy" backpeddle key. 
---
* Move "Sit" and "Unsheath/Sheath" weapon from Z/X to something else (like on the numberpad) these are "RP" abilities which you don't need quick access to.
---
This gives you 5 more easy to reach hotkeys: Q, W, E, Z, X. Then I also happen to use a MOBA mouse which has 7 buttons in a circular fashion from the thumb. I use shift/control to modify spells (e.g. to downrank or mouse-over). So my total keybinds are: 1-7 (mouse), Q, W, E, R, T, Y, U, F, G, H, J, Z, X, C, V, B, N + shift/control versions if necessary. I use awkward binds like N, J, H, Y, U for less common things like Decurse, Slowfall, Dampen/Amplify (macro to be shift for amplify), Fire/Frost ward (macro to Shift for Frost) etc.
---
If your MH is 3 seconds and your Offhand is 1.5 seconds. In a 3 second window you'll be getting 1 mh swing and 2 of swings
---
Same here, just hit 31!
---
I disagree
---
best xp is to start your own group, get a priest and 3 mages, and do big pulls of the loops around jail and arena. you can do arena too, it takes like 2 minutes. Priest bubble warrior, go collect a bunch of stuff (exactly how much you can do is mostly up to your mages) and let the mages do the nova/coc/blizzard spellcleave thing they want to do most
---
I'm not even sure how to use it and the small flaw that we've seen doenst really affect my game so I have just left it
---
Battlegrounds only. They're at the max level of their bracket. There is no purpose to a twink in world pvp.
---
i do this as well, i finally got a message from someone saying "don't think i didn't notice that distract" when we had already pulled more then we wanted
---
made my day
---
I think its worse in long fights due to damage caused per mana expended
---
They were the same numbers on different screenshots, where I was in Stormwind on one and Molten Core on one. However they were different numbers on different characters. Thanks for trying :D
---
I came across twinks back then but they were rare. But for the most part I would have the highest damage and kills in wsg and I had mostly AH greens. No feet of lynx or sentry cloak. No fishing or gurubashi stuff. 
---
I did have the leg thread though. But no talbar mantle or head enchant.
---
Also: not a question, but I noticed that after I [asked in the "Classy Friday" thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dmuznc/classy_friday_mages_october_25_2019/f5h7x4n/?context=8&amp;depth=9) about mage AOE farming gear, Icy Veins added a BIS list for that:
---

---
Typical spaceforce buncha shitters showing up late
---
Allaince on whitemane PST PVP. Fairly active group of levelers with people on daytime and evening hours. Server is really really busy and fairly easy to find groups. Hit me up on here or ingame name Atlan.
---
I remember during the LK fight we had to tell our healers to disable Decursive because it would all but auto-remove the disease that you had to bounce around to kill the big adds in P1.
---
I actually did the reverse of you. Honestly go with what youre gonna enjoy. I rolled a hunter but got really bored with the playstyle. And i want to pvp, and considering i mained a rogue from lich king to wod, i cant imagine pvping any other way. But if you do stay on the rogue, dont worry about the grouping. I mean yea, it can be hard, but that can be supplemented with getting a guild/group of friends. Just do what you think youre gonna be happy with, dont wanna max out a toon that you dont enjoy ya feel.
---
Probably better just to reroll at this point?  You lose so much time and have zero chance of world bosses *ever* otherwise.
---
There would only be like 5 guilds that meet that though, considering many of them are streamer loot funnel guilds apart from like the mediocrely fast Mc guilds, where 2 or 3 are good
---
or he is full of shit
---
Only if it's about to die before you can frostbolt again. Scorch fibroblast before it dies for even more try hard dps.
---
I have. Show me what you've read that proves this isn't the case. I can show you my clips proving thar you're incorrect dude. It's whatever idrc
---
And we're not bad at returning flags either. Especially with a +1. Druids can run flags easily. Rogues aren't that bad of getting a flag to midfield to hand off. 
---
Not every BG has that perfect "tank that knows what he's doing" breakdown. 
---
There's so much to be done. Even if you are sitting a flag you can help by directing the team strategy.
---
Yep, glad I caught on to this early too. 
---
A mage buddy of mine has seen the whole necropile set drop from the many many scholo runs we did, but always greeded on it because it wasnt pre-raid bis. Recently he's realized that its actually a good pvp set and he regrets letting it go.
---
Am I the only one that uses a sword and board still? I have no problems tanking normally in MC, holding threat on Onyxia, or any dungeons.
---
Put crippling in on your main hand! Instant on off.  You get more instant prices on your offhand rather than your main hand.
---
Doesn’t even look bad ass
---
Isn’t it the horde getting shredded though?
---
Dude, I notice the same thing! Like you get in a group, and it's quiet, not a lot of talk (not saying it's because they hate you), but then towards the end they start being more vocal about the DPS/spell interrupts, blinds, distracts, and emergency kidney shots haha. We are pretty chill when you find one of us who knows what they're doin.
---
It does have bearing because one of the primary arguments for not having prot pally tanks is "they can get crushed, warriors can't because shield block pushes it off the table" yet I'm frequently hearing about warriors dual wield tanking, so clearly that's not as important as people pretend it is. Then paladins should likewise be able to 2h tank, right? And generate big threat with greater blessing spam. I'm not sure how this amount of threat would compare to a warrior though. The paladin could even 2h tank but switch to shield whenever redoubt procs.
---
I hear your point about dual wield tanking requiring a well geared raid and understand that applies even more to paladins. I'm just exploring different ideas. 
---
Still, just looking for a place where the topic of dw tanking has been theorycrafted and not just glossed over.
---
Honestly, my recommendation is just do the orb method. I don’t have a ton of time, but a 45m orb run, getting lucky with 2-3 sometimes is a nice way to make 30-90g depending on your server. I hate tanking too, but with a competent group strat live is pretty cake, and taught me a ton about tanking.
---
Fuckin nerd
---
I love me some data.
---
I was doing these calculations just the other day too. But instead of calculating the efficiency of the min and max heal separately, I used their average value.
---
So, for each type of heal I calculated its efficiency with the following formula:
---
(min heal + max heal) / 2 / mana cost
---
You've been given some good feedback so far, and maybe you can use my tip as well. Your spreadsheet is a good start, and I applaud your efforts to share helpful and organized data with us.
---
Quitting too early. A lot of classes have a point later in leveling that they get real fun. Like priest at 40 with shadow form. Anyway, long as you are enjoying it, that's all that matters.
---
 Pushing my second toon to 60, who is 51 now. That'll give me a raid healer and pvp/farmer dps. Alts after that probably will taper off at different level ranges. Not necessarily for twinking, just to have available to join/help people with whatever. That's the long term plan anyway.
---
When people say warriors are the most gear dependant class, it's true. 
---
A lvl 10 warrrior gets the same 1 rage from 20 damage (just a number I pulled out of my ass) as a level 60 warrior with raid gear. When you hit for 1000 damage whitehit with wbuffs, you get 50 rage per one hit. 
---
Rage generation becomes *insane.* And bosses only get harder, start hitting harder, the warrior starts to hit harder. In the end you you can infinitely spam your abilities only the GCD holding you back.
---
In later raids you don't have to decide between HS, sunder, SM, revenge etc. You just use them all as they come off CD.
---
Yes it's not that big of a deal, but worth it to ask people of Reddit :)
---
That sounds so dumb  lol
---
Fucking what.
---
If she got pregnant when classic dropped there’s nothing that changes.
---
Obviously you are neither a woman or someone who has been pregnant. 
---
Nothing changes. You are just what- 2-3 months along? Ez clap.
---
Morning sickness maybe but that’s it.
---
Fury warriors and ret pallies using rogue gear will be destroyed in PvP.
---
Hopefully theyve been farming PvP sets or they are in for a rude awakening.

The circle of ganking.

They transferred from a heavy Horde server to a heavy alliance server.  Now they're whining that they have no horde to kill.
---
Meanwhile on Stalagg, Alliance dominates Horde, despite being outnumbered.
---
Every alliance that went to Heartseeker from Stalagg is an idiot.
---
Yeah, it’s hilarious in the context of giving out of touch, unapologetically dismissive old fart types a taste of their own medicine. That crowd can dish it but they sure as hell can’t take it, which is why it’s funny.
---
Stronghold was absolutely invaluable to me in vanilla.
---
If you want to be cheap go farm death grips, but disarm immunity is critical.
---
what was the same?
---
40 to 50 was definitely a slog. But now all my friends quit and I'm the only one left, and my guild is already cementing core raiders etc. It's tough finding motivation to keep grinding it out sometimes but I definitely will soon.
---
Just hope I have a raid spot when it happens
---
This is a terrible place to ask questions as most of the people who answer arent paladins or are incompetent. Have your dps locate the f key and judge seal of righteousness on cooldown with rf and consecrate up. If you are an actual paladin tank you're sanctuary blessing yourself and salvation blessing everyone else. If something mind bogglingly unlikely happens like a mage crits 12 times in a row and starts to get agro use hammer of justice to stun the target before it gets to them and it will in all likelihood be dead before it gets unstunned. You dont have a taunt but you have two independent counter taunts. If you're duo tanking and need to give agro to the other tank and they cannot taunt you bubble yourself. If someone draws agro on a stun immune target and you want agro back or you are trying to "taunt" off an offtank like in ubrs you blessing of protection them. In the event you're doing all that and still having trouble then re evaluate your gear and talents. As with warrior tanks bitching about rage for tanking your threat is tied to holy damage and by extension mana. If you have any further questions ask the paladin discord or section of your server discord for paladins. You're less likely to be answered by apes.
---
Why did I post this?
---
You've got severe issues bruh
---
Here's your answer
---
Rogue
---
Or druid
---
Avoid all w pvp til your heart's content
---
Your father's a cunt.
---
Imagine you're in Winterspring and after hours of looking you find a Black Lotus! Youre playing on a PvP server. Now imagine a level 52 gnome rogue comes out of stealth right if front of you and takes it as you're realizing you cant kill him because of some bullshit normie trinket from some reddit thread for casuals.
---
Fights between a disarm immune warrior and a non immune one are always very onesided.
---
Thanks mate, I appreciate the post. I'll look into that spec.
---
I mean, i’m getting it before I raid.. seems preraid to me.
---
Even the silver to learn the profession, 10 baubles and a strong fishing rod!
---
I highly recommend running most instances at least once to do the quests, doing a quest run is very efficient in terms of XP, and you get nice blue items that help you level quicker too.
---
Damn Daniel, people are savaging this post
---
c ƒ ◃ c c € f
---
The key thing I think they should do to alleviate this problem, is to show the current faction balance on the server selection screen. Then anybody that really wants to be on a faction-heavy server can choose one, or people can pick more even servers. 
---
I don't think forcing the factions to be equal is necessary, but people shouldn't have to rely on addons and 3rd party websites to be able to see faction dominance.
---
Where the hell were all these type of girls when I was on tinder?
---
No you can't. That's how much vendors pay for linen bags...
---
Yeah you got it pretty spot on. It was not unheard of only one existing per server in Vanilla.
---
people underestimate the power of the melee cleave steamroll in UBRS. we have run it as well, not even a hunter, just warriors rogues and a bear druid tank
---
its nuts how fast things die
---
It was as much laggy before the change
---
What dungeon runs are the best strictly for exp grinding as lvl 55 wrrior?
---
You were playing 7.5 hours/day??
---
In some ways it'll sort of be both. 
---
There's gonna be a metric FUCKTON of ganking, but there will indeed also be SS v TM battles, that definitely was a thing and will be again (especially in the first few weeks of PvP I think), and some people on each server probably will earn a bit of a reputation. 
---
Though everything depicted in the "reality" section will also happen except perhaps for killing some quest givers. (Flight masters though for sure).
---
I disagree. Only 3 pieces of T1 have +spell damage on them, while most are +healing and mp5 (useless for PvP). Plus the T1 bonuses are also useless for Ele. You’re much better off building a set of mostly mail items with Int/Stam/SP/Spell crit. I say mostly mail because there’s a few slots that you don’t have a ton of mail options, and a leather/cloth item is just better than any mail option. Chest/boots are tough to find good mail pieces.
---
Other than the gloves/legs/bracers of T1 you’re not really interested in any pieces. 
---
Use a 1h wep and a shield, shoot for over 3k health at the minimum, have around 200 sp, and you’ll be set for PvP with room for upgrades.
---
It's certainly better than retail. I started playing retail again after almost 10 years expecting a more mature community but Jesus christ are they toxic.
---
Exactly, I’ve been seeing people talking a lot about moving back to private servers, we just went nuts about classic for like years. All those toons on nost just lost, I would lose my shit over that. That said, we’ll have to see how bad it is with world bosses... let’s wait to see how they do with P2 first, Then talk about it.
---
I must admit, I also have a mage. He impressed me by being responsible, communicative, and competent.
---
jesus
---
Oh got ya. Re-read, yea I was wrong. Thanks
---
I
---
Thanks! I'll give it look.
---
Just using the numbers and not exp difference is naive.
---
dreadwolf boots from LBRS have like a 50% drop-rate and are not that far behind mongoose or swiftwalker. and LBRS is super easy to find groups for as a rogue
---
Honestly if you want to learn exactly how this game works with regard to the warrior class, you should look no farther than the Fight Club discord channel. It’s the best/highest quality WoW Classic content that I have found. It is also an extremely active and reasonably entertaining forum.
---
Level 60 Rogue - What profession do I replace Skinning with?
---
My other profession is Engineering. I am maxed out on everything. Got 4 T1 items, everything else pre BIS. Have over 1k gold so I can easily level up another profession. Which profession will be best to replace skinning going forward into phase 3-6? Which will make me the most money? Which will I end up using the most? Thanks!
---
Hell, even in my own guild...I'm the OT.  I'm fine with that.  0/30/21 makes me the guild's swiss army knife.
---
Certainly
---
90% of the time it'll be just like the second half of the video, but 10% of the time there will be some of the first half. That was my vanilla pvp server experience at least.
---
Oh my god. Thank you, thank you so much.
---
Omg you have such succulent veins I would love to draw blood
---
Shimmering flats gives a good bit of XP and they have you running to booty bay a lot anyway.
---
Hillsbrad Foothills also has quite a bit around your level.
---
He's not a nerd, you are just uneducated
---
Exactly. 
---
His fire and corrosive breath will also not be hitting you, and the tank should hopefully be getting knocked back into a wall
---
It should appear in your character window. There is a drop down menu that let’s you see different stats. Select “Spell”
---
As a priest I can't think of a single 5 level stretch where I didn't pick a talent that was a noticeable difference for my character. Maybe it's worse for other classes. My 36 paladin alt I've also been very excited to get talents at least once every 5 levels.  
---
Its really surprising to me anyone could play an RPG, level up, once.. or even TEN times, and not get to choose a single stat increase or new ability, and not dislike that.  I find it awful.
---
yea i see people talking about rogues taking lockboxes and chests, i was a rogue in vanilla and am one now and i have never not opened the box for the group.
---
Most people sell it for around 20g for their mats. Essence of fire down to 5g and below on my server so your best bet is probably to buy mats.
---
Yeah 51-60 grind is nice because you can start targeting your BIS as part of the leveling.
---
Nope also no guards so its a pvp mess.
---
&gt; the full servers like Herod/Faerlina are just gonna crash, cause its gonna be like 1000+v1000+ in one layer.
---
Yeah, I'm unfortunately stuck on Faerlina, all my buddies rolled on the realm and I decided that I didn't want to play alone lol. Phase 2 might be the "update" that pushes me to roll on either a lower pop realm or take the free transfer to Earthfury, if and when the transfers are available.
---
Speaking of transfers, maybe we'll see paid transfers added in, because the backlash from the horrendous lag is going to be wild.
---
It takes at least 2 resets to complete the questline.  Anyone who has completed the questline and rings the gong within 10 hours of the first person gets the mount.  Multiple people from the same guild can get the mount assuming they finish the quest in time.  Each person will need to grind the 42000 carapace fragments in Silithus(roughly 20000 elite levels 60-63) though,  which takes an extreme grind.  The questline is not going to be the bottleneck though,  the war effort is what will be the ultimate limiting factor.  On pservers there were dozens of people finished with the quest just waiting for the war effort to complete,  which usually took about 4 weeks.
---
T. Scarab Lord on Lightbringer
---
Kaplan was hired as a quest designer on vanilla WoW.  Seems strange that he'd have all this power you're claiming before launch.
---
I was surprised to hear that phase two is coming so quickly. I think that a lot of people are pretty happy to be playing classic, and don’t realize that a certain level of polish is completely missing from the game. I can’t help but think, that they got classic to a state where it was considered acceptable, and then simply said good enough, our work here is done. 
---
I feel like i learn more from this reddit about classic changes/bugs/fixes/releases than I do from blizzard. Maybe im searching for information in the wrong places... but am I the only one that feels like the classic team has been really subtle with any/all information registering classic? I feel a “you lucky you even playin this, and here is what you get” vibe.
---
the problem will be paladins and shamans, but yea i would rather have my 35 days played undead mage on the ally and on the same server than leaving to a new server like heartseeker.
---
i canceled my subscription after i hit 60.  but i thought they already removed layering though.
---
The point I'm making is that the economy is fucked, and it cannot get any better now.  Price expectations are set.
---
the boats ending up in stonetalon are perfectly normal.
---
with literally everyone telling you the same thing...thrash+mirahs...it should be obvious
---
Ele/Resto shaman is probably a good bet. It’s a powerhouse in BG Premades, great at throwing heals at the same time, competitive in raids (You’re really only missing manatide) and nearly every raid group needs more shaman for totems. My buddy is Ele/Resto and they just have him DPS until we get to a harder fight or annoying trash. 
---
You’d be best off telling the raid that you’re a healer though rather than break down that it’s hybrid
---
&gt; I’m leveling a ret pally so I plan to quote you on this. But no mages roll arcane, never seen a beast master raid. There are a number of do called meme specs that could be boosted to make them more Competitive
---
Mages don't roll arcane because fire/frost deals more damage, but Arcane is still viable. 
---
By beast master, do you mean melee hunter? yes, its a thing. And calculated to be the highest dps achievable by a hunter in the game, [if done properly](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?p=14974).
---
&gt; Jeff probably didn't even make the call to scrap it.
---
Hmm.
---
Jeff was lead dev. He made 100% of resource allocation decisions. every single fucking thing wrong with vanilla is his fault.
---
I'm not sure where you're getting your info from, but he was in charge.
---
The numbers of Youtube vids on this subject is somewhat lengthy, however, if you enjoy the history of early Wow, I'd suggest watching them. 
---
Remember, the game was in development for 6 years or so. The fact almost NONE of the end-game content (out of 15-20 planned areas) made it into the game is telling that someone re-prioritized resource allocation, i.e., re-do shit that had already undergone testing and QA.
---
Depends on essence of fire prices on your server.
---
ITT: "Some people in a basement somewhere ran better servers"
---
I've got into a habit of giving him 15 silver every time he gives me milk. I have almost a stack of milk on my Rogue now lol.
---
a 30 minute one, it's only something you pop if you're sure you're going to lose.
---
Been leveling a tank and always invites rogues but I guess fuck em they want to go after warriors anyway no more invites from me :)
---
The gems are like 20% drop each, so if you're rolling against 4 other people every time you'll be running it a lot. 
---
Depending on class you can see how many you get while just farming gear.  People mostly run the 3 boss (Voone, Vosh, Omokk), so the first three gems are easiler to get in general. 
---
Wyrm is the really rough one because FC runs are far more rare.  Typically if someone wants Zigris (for HoP) they'll just FC since that's 90% of the way in. 
---
I was super lucky that I got Wyrm's gem on my first FC run, maybe my 2nd or 3rd lbrs run of any kind.  I actually got my Omokk gem last, and before I got my Skyshroud pants.  There's just a lot of RNG in there. 
---
I'm guessing I did 50+ total runs. 
---
Then you have to find help to forge the seal, which is difficult.  You could camp Emberstrife and beg people coming to do their ony attunes to help you, or try spamming /4 to see if anyone else needs their seal forged.  I think I had my gems for a week or so before I found an LFG.
---
At the same time, in a 10 man raid finding one with the key is usually not a huge deal.  You don't really need a key.  I've yet to sell a key service, either.
---
Damn, way to make female Undead players feel left out. :(
---
A lot of people were/are interested in those servers. Millions of players in fact.
---
I just did this, I started levelling a troll mage on a pvp server while my main is a level 52 NE druid on a pve.  It’s def not too late imo.
---
Yesterday on kurinaxx ony head drop there was like 150+ people in org and as soon as the head dropped and lightning animation hit, the entire fucking city lagged for a solid 15 seconds.
---
Unreal that shitty donation-run private servers can offer better performance than a billion dollar company
---
Honestly blizz. Throw like $5k more at each server for fuck sakes. It’s peanuts for them and would help players a lot
---
Kk just what I was looking for thanks
---
we have 6 including myself. I feel you. It's not 9 but the struggle to win gear is real.
---
Sadly if I want to play with my stubborn friends that is not an option. I suggested it way back in week 1 and they didnt listen
---
They only removed it for low pop servers, \~60-70% of the servers still have it
---
Biggest servers still have queues currently even with layering, it's gonna be a shit show, I guess they are gonna open server transfers again
---
This addon was in vanilla.
---
Shout out to that one rogue who tried to backstab onyxia
---
A nerd defending a nerd..
---
Warcraft lore?
---
Two types of people here, 
---
1. People who don't have a shit bucket and Finnish raids in 6 hours after a lot of tears and screaming from their poor raid leader.
---
2. People of the golden shit bucket master race whom all play relaxed and well. They finnish MC in 1 hour with only lvl 50 greens and no buffs or potions. 
---
3. I my self am a god and not a person, and meta comments about nagging wow experts are great ( ◜‿◝ )♡ .
---
&gt; I can stack 2 set of all the cloth t0 to farm 200 armor set bonuses and spec soul link on my warlock to tank 5 mans just fine. Works as well or better than shaman or even paladin tank depending on competence and gear. Should I do it in raids though? Probably not...(aside from twin emps.)
---
The difference is should and could. But these off meta tank specs are not too far behind as people think.
---
Honestly, nothing new. Due HW cutting, BF series went to complete garbage latency wise. CoD, no idea but I doubt its as good as dedicated servers we used to have.
---
And CS is also crap mostly.
---
In this case it might be cost saving, or it might be just completely different architecture that simply doesnt work at all with more than like 64 ppl at once.
---
LEEEEROOOOOOOOY JENNNN --- Jenri has left the guild
---
Oh dude have you ever been in a deprivation tank? Sometimes I'll just do dmt and hop in one of those and I'll start talking to aliens and shit. Have you ever done dmt? Pull up that video of that wendigo ripping a dwarfs face off jamie.
---
[lolwot](https://i.imgur.com/pQlRNcu.jpg)
---
pay faction change for non-pally/shaman meybe?
---
Same, I'm 48 but hey I have my boot flask and maxed out fishing and cooking, so that's something.
---
Lots of classes share loot tables no idea why rogues think themselves so high, I’ll make sure to avoid them from now on when tanking
---
I've seen ~30g asking price on Faerlina Horde for the Magi staff.  I imagine that's easily talked down to 25.
---
On any server with a healthy population no world boss will ever be pugged. Also most guilds will never see a world boss.
---
World bosses will be farmed by a small number of guilds repeatedly on each server. These guilds will have parked watchers and summoners in each world boss spawn point. By the time someone notices one is up and attempts to pug it in world chat, those guilds will have summoned 40 players to the location and the boss will be at half health before you get 10 people into your pug. Or 2-3 of those guilds from both factions will have their raid teams there and there will be a war, your pug will be sabotaged if it tried to ninja the pull, especially with kazzaks heal on death mechanic.
---
This is how it was on low pop private servers, it will o my be more intense on high pop classic servers. Of you want a shot at a raid boss join a large guild with multiple raid teams. Keep in mind, this is all assuming the lag somehow gets fixed, otherwise shit will be unkillable.
---
Amen brother.
---
Can only do if hunter or mage lol
---
Marriage material that one.
---
They're great healers in PvP, but it takes skill to utilize the kit well enough to be better than a paladin.
---
Don't worry I'm sure we'll fix everything here on the wow classic sub reddit by advertising for the worst among us. Go back to twitter with this crap
---
Meh hope they wise up, it's a snowball effect and it's only going to get worse
---
Which tournament? I just tried searching for one, but I came across some joke tourney where a bunch of items are banned including even Thistle Tea and Healthstones. So that one is clearly a joke.
---
Yeah I guess I did. Was a slow period in uni right after exam so I had alot of time.
---
You are thinking about the expectations from the video where everyone goes the Hillsbrad to fight and have a good time.
---
If you have your life put together you can make time for the things that you enjoy.
---
Wake up, 8am. Get up and run to work, take quick shower, be at desk by 9am.
---
5pm, go to gym for 1 hour session, run home, shower. 7pm.
---
Cook and eat dinner, 7:45pm.
---
Sit in my ass and play games/relax until 12:30. then go to sleep. thats almost 5 hours a day to just sit around playing WoW
---
I notice your "make dinner and put your kids to bed" takes 4 hours a day. At that point you're just saying "i cant play a time intensive videogame with just the time between when my family goes to bed and when I go to bed" which is true.
---
I dont even know what that symbol is and I've played for 15 years
---
I'm not assuming we will lose any impactful amount of subs over it. I'm just saying if you're really trying to make your opinion heard then you stop paying them money.
---
That’s the global cooldown being applied. Most spells will trigger the global cooldown otherwise things like arcane explosion 15 times in 200ms would be possible. Fire blast does damage immediately, so if the mob will die before your 2.5s frostbolt cast would go off, you can squeeze out a bit more damage by doing an instant cast. Scorch has a 1.5s cast time iirc, so if the mob will live for 1.6s, you can’t get off a frostbolt but a scorch fireblast will be able to go off.
---
Kurinaxx! Horde! Lone wolf as well, but I love helping people out and questing
---
I am in the same boat, that 1% seems to be more like 75% chance one will resist and that is with only 3 mobs, couldnt imagine if i could gather 10, I would never get a chance to blizzard, every time would be a resist and yes i have precision
---
And it will go straight to the top and get reddit gold. big bad cloud bad reeeee
---
Not usually but I do get salty when i see a rogue with viskaag and ony neck do less dps than the tank. In a group full of blue geared people.
---
best xp is to start your own brd group, get a priest and 3 mages, and do big pulls of the loops around jail and arena. you can do arena too, it takes like 2 minutes. Priest bubble warrior, go collect a bunch of stuff (exactly how much you can do is mostly up to your mages) and let the mages do the nova/coc/blizzard spellcleave thing they want to do most
---
For PvE dps warriors need a lot of mail/leather armor for the best dps potential. Most plate sets and tiers are specific for healing or tanking only a number of plate pieces have good dps stats. Warriors need more +hit for fury since they have no talents for hit as well.
---
I got a new wand just before Maraudon. Nature damage. 
---
Always keep a backup wand.
---
“The most recent and interesting discussion happened because of all things, WoW Classic. That was really cool as we started to talk about ‘Are there lessons from WoW Classic that’d be cool in Overwatch’s progression system?’ I was somebody who had worked on WoW in the early days, the original game, Burning Crusade, and Wrath of the Lich King. I had a great conversation with Tom Chilton, who was the game director from Cataclysm through Legion. “
---
In other words, Jeff is awesome.  Tom, not so much.
---
Which is awesome.  Hard fought well geared battles between mostly equals with no need to do the gear grind up?  Yes please, more of this.
---
Im in love....
---
True, but from what I've seen they do engage in RP.
---
This outfit screams “I wish I was Alliance”
---
True I missed the whole event on my server because I got disconnected and wasnt able to log in again without disconnecting for the entire event lol. That was over 10 years ago though so the servers should be able to handle that sort of thing better. But for whatever reason, blizzards servers are now worse at handling large events than they were back in 2005.
---
 We always get what we want.
---
\-Zyk
---
No it's not. It USED TO BE but was changed in a later vanilla patch (hence we get it)
---
I was gonna go for the mageblade but there are so many mages so I’ll be rolling against 9-10 of them
---
Same I have a level 11 or 12 alt that I do not want to level.
---
Myzrael needs more horde, lots of great guilds and helpful people in our faction. We're dieing for shamans
---
Slow and steady wins the race lol, hoping to hit 60 sometime in 2020
---
I would leave a guild if they gave CHT to a rogue who already has brutality blade. That’s a clear corrupt loot council. Or even worse your guild does free rolls! Rip
---
90 minutes? Try 45. And I’m not even in a hardcore guild or anything. We just have the entire raid flask up and do elixirs.
---
Level 49 lock, been thinking of respeccing to demonology PvP build over draintank since phase2 coming out. Anyone have experience in how much slower it is for leveling? Not going to enjoy having to drink again lol.
---
I know but when are we ever gonna see that drop so
---
Nice! Actually kind of enjoy how slow the grind is, makes me appreciate it more.
---
Wife her ASAP
---
Not much usually, but I've gotten two rings from pickpocketed lockboxes in the past week that were great for my class and sold really well on the AH. Plus you get reagents for poisons.
---
vanish distract... fucking brilliant, thanks
---
Lmao if they're going to make changes, you think THIS would be at the top of the queue? Sorry bud you're going to have to live with your decisions and the facts of life, no magical trinket is going to come out of nowhere to make your life easier
---
Eh.. Maybe. It's certainly possible. 
---
It's also possible that the modern client isn't coded to handle this type of large scale combat very well. The client they ported classic over to always operated with sharding. Hopefully they are working on a fix, but it's not self evident that hardware is the issue.
---
This. Easiest way.
---
If you were watching the combat log you would see them, this is just a heads up.
---
So? That makes it more likely there will be large scale PvP not less likely
---
We had one of these in EQ and it was great. It did require someone from each guild to send in their progress each time they reached a milestone, and it had to include evidence. Every guild participated though, for the brags. Of course in EQ there are FAR more raid targets than in WoW and it takes way longer to progress through them over the course of each expansion.
---
That’s what I’m saying the mage blades don’t really drop
---
I had names reserved on both rp servers, Grobb and BB. Coming ever close to go time, i was leaning heavily towards pve, a path i know well. But... i wanted to know what all the hoopla was about pvp and to know why pvp servers far outweigh pve servers. What was it? and now i know!  Landed in an active guild with amazing peeps.
---
Pretty sure if i went BB i probably would have bored out in a month and would not be playing wow at all as retail does not interest me the way classic does whether it be pve or pvp. The game is only over a month in now, roll on grobb.
---
Gehennas is the "anybody whose anybody plays here" server for EU.
---
They’ll stack the group with other players who don’t need the item, and if it drops, you pay them and the item is guaranteed yours.
---
Cool guy doesn’t base his ego on video game progress because he’s too busy being cool guy.
---
Ya horde has flight paths, dungeons, racials, luckily skill isnt needed compared to alliance.
---
Yes it is, pretty sure they do front flip attacks
---
can tell you from basic testing in-game this is just wrong
---
dual wielding is far more DPS
---
Dal rends doesnt get beat by a 2h until you start looking at bone reaver's edge
---
I'm going to go out n say you play a lot more than you let on or think.
---
Close the top and throw his ass into the lava pits of Blackrock.
---
I still think this is all somehow Google Chrome's fault.
---
how is that possible- cant you only enter an instance 5 times per hour?
---
I guarantee this mage will regret his decision 2 weeks before his subscription expires and he realizes he has two worthless rings and his other items slots, consumable bank, and epic mount fund are sorely lacking.
---
I would love one if you’re able please :) I can pay shipping!!
---
Yeah definitely ask first. If no one knows, its still fun to figure it out as you go with the group. Classic is meant to be a community where everyone works together to accomplish a task. As the tank you can take control too and really should so you can go at your pace. Some people may get mad that "youre going too slow" but theyre usually dps that can leave and go wait an hour to find another group or let them pull aggro and die. Most important thing is to have fun with it
---
Crikey mate, i found one
---
But taking damage gives me more rage to *deal even more damage*.  And your rage gives me a semi erection
---
.. or who is he going to kick once he returns :D
---
I lead the pack even further away while everyone runs, then I vanish or die.  Quick mana pot and 10-15 seconds of mana chugging can make the difference between squeezing through or wiping the party
---
How would paid transfers not be a better fix lmao?
---
They are basing the price on the average amount of time it may take to get you your drop. They'll keep running it until you get it.
---
If they charge 150g and it drops first run they saved a lot of time. Consequently you may get run 5 times and it will never drop and they don't make any gold.
---
I don't think they underestimate it's power, but rather they would rather not roll against 6 other people on a 4% drop rate item.
---
I know I'll just get baited into a trap... but... I read a lot of vague complaints on this and other subs like the ones mentioned here. Is there like a list of "problems" that people are mentioning that I could read up on? I'm a casual player who just hit 40 after 2+ months, so I haven't been able to really have any complaints of my own. I can't remember what "true vanilla" was supposed to feel like anymore, other than vague memories of running cross-country to SM in 2005. But I have played vanilla pservers for years.
---
Assuming 1 day /played for level 20, and 70 days since release, thats roughly 17 minutes per day average.  Frankly, I wouldn’t play such a time consuming game if you don’t have much free time.
---
I can, but I won't
---
Lock trinket doesnt remove stuns, sadly.
---
There’s a global cool down on spells, trinkets, and a bunch of other things.  The only reason you don’t notice it on Frost Bolt is because you’re casting while the global cool down is happening.  Fire Blast is instance and has no cool down but is still affected by the global cool down.
---
What he was saying is that you can cast a short cast of scorch and instantly follow it up with a fire blast (since the cast time is just long enough to hide the global cool down from you like with frost bolt).  
---
You would want to do that when you don’t have time for an entire frost bolt, but you do have enough time for a scorch and a fire blast.
---
druid
---
I leveled with another shaman. So we'd have GoA and WF up at all times. Until BRD when you need aoe damage our first picks for dps were always rogues or warriors. We'd pretty much always pass on hunter DPS though. 
---
Maybe that's why rogues always added me, but i never suspected rogues would have a hard time finding groups.
---
I think it’s a lot like dating... what people think they want and what they actually love are different.
---
Or take gambling for example. If you won every single time on a slot machine, you’d get bored of it. You wouldn’t get a buzz out of “maybe I’ll win”.
---
And then if you did win, you basically had unlimited money, and everyone else (let’s just ignore inflation and supply/demand) then suddenly you can all buy everything cheap and nothing is special any more. 
---
Scarcity increases value. If everyone has it, no one has it. 
---
And it’s like that with armour/progression in wow. It’s not special and doesn’t feel like an achievement if you didn’t have to earn it and everyone else has it.
---
Alliance on benediction! Send a letter in the Mail to faldran if you’re interested in guilding up! We have about 170 members and many people are almost to 60 so we are about to start raiding
---
Not having played classic and getting extremely tilted when being farmed I’m slightly worried about this, is it going to be so bad as you just can’t level through a zone?
---
Its the old elitist jerks thing.  Elitist jerks describe the most optimal way to play wow that a person of slightly above average intellect and below can understand and implement.
---
They simplify things while pretending that their way is the best.
---
Which isn't true.
---
Basically you can use this heuristic: if the community concensus is that A, whatever A is, is the best, whether its best in slot, best build, best strat, best whatever, then, by definition, there exists B which is actually better.
---
Its just that B is too difficult to describe to people in a way that they can understand.
---
Example: paladin tank on last boss of first phase of icecrown citadel.  Everyone knows you have to have max defense to not get crushing blows and you need at least 2 tanks for this boss.  As paladin tank you don't need max defense to knock crushing blows off your list.  I did it.  And because of that I was able to solo tank that boss by not ever getting hit by his de-aggro.
---
This held true back in the EQ days.
---
Holds true today with the best in slot concept being completely wrong in most cases.  Warlock particularly.
---
Basically if the stupid masses agree that something is the best then you know for a fact that that thing/way/strategy isn't the best.
---
Sometimes, though,they get lucky and are correct.  But that is super rare.
---
Everytime anyone writes LF1 DD he instantly gets whispers from 5 rogues. Thats why most rogues are ignored – there are simply too many of them.
---
I don’t know what server you played in vanilla but large scale PvP battles crashed my server all the time. Generally wiping out the whole continent it was happening on.
---
This guy reserves items as rogue.
---
Healers/casters don't really care about fire res
---
The cloak, bracers, and boots are all rare world drops.  You can purchase them on AH they could be 125-250G a pop.  I think that cloak is over 200G on my server.
---
The green lens could easily be 40-50G if you want the max +36 enchant.
---
Man Mindlessly Regurgitating Uninformed Reddit Posts Accuses Others Of Being Brainless Drones
---
There is SO much that is immune to nature though.
---
*cries in elemental shaman*
---
its not just debuff slots
---
it's also that arms does about half the damage going fury does
---
if youre in a shitty guild that cant kill rag maybe theyre okay w/ it, but even relaxed guilds that want to clear content wont let you be arms
---
Feral cat/boomkin
---
You think Blizzard rents servers from another company to run their game on? Hmm..
---
Imagine typing this non ironically.
---
Zzzzz ony buff
---
Don't switch. You can raid as shadow and you can get gear via PVP. And Shadow is a freaking powerhouse even in blues. So yeah... switching class if you like the gameplay would be the biggest mistake you can make.
---
Im only lvl 50 Rogue but I definitely have started more groups throughout my leveling than I have joined. Only a couple times I can think of and it was off peak where I wasnt able to get a group together in a reasonable time.
---
I see fewer Druids at higher levels. I see fewer Warriors at lower levels.
---
This is brilliant, and as a new warlock I appreciate this sort of information.
---
If your mage is aoe dpsing and not pulling aggro off his aoe tank and he is frost spec then he is doing it wrong.
---
arcane explosion and flamestrike are superior dps to blizzard in every way.
---
Therefore being frost is just gimping your dps and leveling speed.
---
60 to get friendly. There are other quests you get them, so not sure after that.
---
Nah, it's easy to get keys. You can even do it while you're farming.
---
I mean, Reddit was around a decade ago, so..
---
Totally agree.  Been playing about 3 hours a night, 3 nights a week so far.
---
It's cheap to level until you hit very high, so it's not necessary for copper-mithril leveling.
---
I also think 285 is much higher than you need for the BoPs you want to craft
---
It sounds like your MT should be looking into getting more threat-oriented gear so that you and the rest of the DPS can unload. 305 weapon skill, 6% hit, and crit after that - should do the trick.
---
Solid response princess.
---
Orc stun resist triggers me to no end. I would definitely suggest orc.
---
Sorry i know the post is really old but i couldn't find the information elsewhere, but is the KoS shared by guilds and Faction or is it personal only? Like if i update a player with a KoS reason will that be flagged for everyone or just my person KoS log?
---
You’re wrong.
---
No you are correct, crusader is top.  Close second agil in P3.
---
Here's some points I think might be relevant:
---
Retail is more profitable simply from the capacity to be more profitable(micro-transactions).
---
Classic has a draw for many reasons. This brings in new people for whatever reason.
---
The ability for people to play classic or retail on the same sub may generate extra revenue. (I'm betting it does)
---
My tinfoil hat theory:
---
The "you think you do, but you don't" then the popularity of classic may have had an effect on future development: 60 cap, implied implementation of talent trees(class focus over spec focus), unique traits for each class.
---
Edit: Forgot to say why I was making these points.
---
I'm fairly convinced that they are going to sabotage classic to push players to retail. I fully expect phase 6 to be released a couple months before the expansion. I hope I'm wrong.
---
Druid and hunters are super easily classes to get tier gear thrown at.
---
tattoos and wow. Thats a swipe right.
---
omg who cares
---
Buying edgemasters = Rich as fuck apparently.
---
If you cant afford edgies, you shouldnt have rolled warrior, never mind a shit race warrior. The info was available before beta. Warriors have to buy most of their gear, shouldnt be surprised.
---
NEVER in the HISTORY of WoW has the game improved because the Devs changed something based on forum user demand.
---
Face it, the players don't know what they want.
---
Druid without a doubt
---
\#2 on Patchwerk gets the Hateful Strike. It can't crit (or crush IIRC), but hits so fucking hard.
---
Sure, if you know what you're doing. 
---
We spent 2 hours wiping to Ony, 2 hours wiping to domo and an hour wiping to rag. 
---
Rest of MC took us about 3 hours though.
---
Usable on Garr and Golemagg. That's about it.
---
&gt;	(I can't stress the crippling poison enough, people have such a hard-on for their damage ever since damage counters became popular, they're willing to risk group wipes if it means their name can be on top)
---
Preach! I play a warrior and usually end up tanking. If just one rogue would apply crippling poison I’d invite them to every single dungeon I ran from then on. Between DPS who give me a half second before going full ham AoE, CC that doesn’t get reapplied, and healers that just need to DPS (the target I’ve only applied one sunder to or marked yet) I have enough on my plate without having to worry about having to hamstring mobs before they start running.
---
But 15 levels in retail is about the time it takes for a single level past lvl 40 in classic. I'm not even sure I'm exaggerating...
---
Fresh account posting political shit in a gaming sub, seems legit.
---
Also, Rule 5
---
such a massive DPS loss
---
just farm your 100g per week dude, it's not hard at 60 when you can easily get close to 50g per hour in DM:east w/ jump runs, or Strat:live orbs
---
Fury does SOOOO much more dps than arms, even if youre using mortal strike. Crits boost your attack speed 30% which is massive dps gain and death wish is insane spell. Also being able to use blood thirst is way more dps than whirlwind
---
You can use TSM (Tradeskill Master). It needs to be scanned for an up-to-date price though. Usually once when I log in and once before I post before bedtime keeps it up-to-date nicely for me.
---
I’ll race ya!  Thinking I’ll probably hit 60 around Feb, but not sure how much I’ll be able to play.
---
Druid or Paladin. Can't go wrong with either. They each have a varied toolkit, are tanky and you shouldn't have trouble finding a spot in a premade group.
---
A lot of people are upset? From this post it just seems like you buddy
---
You just described PvE. 
---
No need to ruin others experiences because you find one part annoying
---
I feel this, I keep putting off getting my lvl 53 to 60 to instead play a handful of lvl 30ish alts.
---
Go Undead, if you love their animations you'll have the best time if you go Undead. Orc is strong yes, but Undead with WotF is also a very strong option.
---
Marco here. How can I help
---
It’s because a majority of the population that browse this subreddit nowadays have room temperature IQs and actual problems don’t get fixed, and the threads get brigaded with monkeys replying “well that’s how it was in Vanilla” when it clearly wasn’t.
---
Just gonna wait for the next private server, at least this time they’ll have the Blizzard client :).
---
Just allow creation of instance of Azshara and Blasted Lands up with only the boss each week and be done with it.
---
They are low value for hunter because the weapon skill helps warriors and rogues in other ways than just hit. For hunters it does nothing other than provide hit. Also getting to 9% is not difficult.
---
Only other caution I have is that unless you’ve done really well with keeping your gear up to date (I know I did not) the dps might not change much. As BM you’re pet does good dps regardless of your gear. As MM your pet does less dps and your dps will be entirely gear dependent.
---
Yes, they do a front flip when you do a combo move like evicerate I believe
---
It's not said enough around here. If you are 60 now, you are not casual.
---
No - you are not.
---
People who put in the time and want to dish out the gold can get it done. Sure pvp will be tough for collecting the silithus carpaces or w/e they were called but honestly the shitty part is coming up with 10 elementium ore for the chain.
---
I get! My cat wants to lay on my right hand and mouse.  I'm like, we need to have a talk. This isn't going to work. lol
---
\*sarcasm intensifies\*
---
Always feelsbadman for the rogues and warriors
---
Bro the name of the dungeon is Shadowfang Keep. They literally named the place because that's where the sword is kept.
---
Not even Molten Core is called "Sulfuras'sses Hold", and that's like..... at least 25 levels higher than this.
---
I want to make an undead warrior because I think undead is the coolest race on horde. But everyone says orc and Tauren are better warriors. Should I go for what’s better or cooler?
---
10000% sure that's a dude.
---
Dude doesn't have a clue.
---
How much different?
---
...the exp difference
---
If your consistently losing on a mage a ring isnt going to help you fyi.
---
There are alternatives from dungeons or just lower damage (+17 instead of +20) that go for a lot lot less. Like 1/50th the price. All the frozen wrath items have gone down a bunch on my server as well. But if buying them isn't an option just get spritecaster Cape, Dire Maul bracers, Omnicast boots.
---
Expectations change over time, and to say its fucked just because prices are low doesn’t make sense, it’s a just a buyer-favored market
---
If you’re using macros, which you should be, isn’t the weapon switch 1 button instant?

---
&gt;The welfare epics are also only epics in color. Usually they might as well be blues considering their quality.
---
No. Compare the end of expansions crappy epics with be beginning of game loot. Compare for example the LFR gear from Antorus, to the Mythic Gear from Emerald Nightmare.  The LFR gear is superior in almost every way and is also way easier to get. If you are going to consider the lfr gear blue than you also need to consider the early mythic gear blue.
---
While I don't know about BFA as I haven't played BFA, this design philosophy has been in place since Patch 3.3 of WotLK when you could run 5 mans for badges of frost to get your 10m normal T10 set. As it has been in place for more than 10 years, I'm guessing that design philosophy hasn't just disappeared with BFA.
---
Ah your typical Onslaught player saying things they can't really back up when it comes to hardcore players leaving
---
Yea but 90% of guilds doing this dont realise their tank sucks ass. 
---
He gears like shit and does his rotation wrong, so your guild think he needs threat gear, bcause they don't know shit about tanking tp tell him hes bad.
---
If you dont have dps pushing 1000 or more dps, you dont need fury spec. A prot tank can hold aggro over 1k dps warrior with proper rotation and gear.
---
Main tanks are stealing bis dps gear to bandaid their shit play. Not in our guild , we will look at your rotation in logs and call you out.
---
The mages don't need or want a warrior for their spellcleave groups.
---
You'll have to find three mages that don't know any better to do what you suggest.
---
Ive gone back and played d1 and d2 over the years. I still get jump scares qhen the butcher comes to murder me in d1. Shit was scary. D3 was a joke compared to that.
---
Makes sense, only reason I wanted to roll a Druid is because there are next to none on my server. But from what everybody is saying it sounds like it’s time to make that warrior.
---
&gt; and if it is situational I carry around a stack of those books that give you 1 minute to change your talents in the field, so I still have it anyway on fights where I need it and didn't have to really make a choice.
---
This is the important part, though. It's not the talent system being different that makes the decision pointless, but the fact that you can change it on the fly.
---
Picking between 3 shitty options in the retail system and picking between 2 shitty talents in classic isn't particularly different. You say you ignore it forever, but you could say the same about shitty filler talents. I'm not familiar with the Shaman talent trees, but the Mage Arcane tree has plenty of those. If you're spec'ing down to Arcane Power (the last talent), you need to go through some truly worthless talents. For example, you basically need to pick up +6% hit to arcane spells... but that puts you over the hit cap for pvp and dungeons, and the only time you ever use an arcane spell against any higher level mob is during the Majordomo fight, and even then it doesn't matter because you just spam sheep until it takes. It's a completely useless talent that you can put anywhere and ignore it forever.
---
There's a similar useless talent just under that one that gives you +2 resist all per point, plus some mana when you resist - useless because as a mage you won't run out of mana anyways (mage armor + wisdom + that other arcane talent + free mana gems + evocation and finally mana potions if you REALLY need them).
---
These are literal throwaway talents that you only take to get 20 or whatever points in the arcane tree to get to the good stuff. You can spend them basically anywhere and completely forget about them forever.
---
33% drop chance?? Idk about to that. My guild has cleared mc every week since week 2 and we haven’t seen a single mageblade
---
...or choker... or mana ignite cord, only 1 toep and 1 ring of SP. /noose
---
Pass on stormwind. I'll just hearthstone to kargath
---
Where is Priest's Heal spell!?
---
That's literally what I use for 95% of my healing in raids, Rank 2 at that...
---
Also, as others have mentioned, without taking talents and healing/spell power (and their coefficients) into consideration, this table is pretty much useless.
---
I'd also consider factoring in the casting speed, especially since some lower ranks cast faster than higher ranks of the same spell, despite benefiting from the same talents and healing/spell power coefficients. For example, a Druid's Healing Touch doesn't become a 3.5s cast until rank 5.
---
ie.: HPM is nice and all, but HPS is also very relevant when one wants to get the most healing done the fastest, without wasting their mana if it can be avoided.
---
B+ for effort, F for relevance.
---
The trailer for Shadowlands compared to the trailer/cutscene for vanilla WoW really underlines, for me, the differences between the games. The original cut scene left you thinking, "What an amazing world! I could be that guy! Or her! Or maybe I could do that!" The Shadowlands cut scene, on the other hand, does not invite me into a world or make me daydream about playing in that expansion or becoming part of that world. It's just watching a typical, over-the-top action scene in which the fighting is supposed to be amazing but is, in fact, completely meaningless because it's so over the top and I also don't care about the characters one whit. 
---
Give me a dwarf trudging through the snow with his pet bear because he's out hunting shit. A Tauren gazing out over the lands of his peoples. I watched that cut scene way back in the day and thought, "Can I do that?! Can I play all those different things?" Shadowlands leaves me thinking, "Well, I'm sure I'll get to watch lots of poorly written scenes in which I am as powerful as a God watching other Super-Gods supposedly be brooding and meaningful or something."
---
tldr: The Shadowlands trailer did not grab me back.
---
Horde is trash. Upgrade from mud huts poor ass
---
Doesn't seem like this ring would be very worthwhile. If you were going to use it, then I guess using it on CD would be the best bet. Not sure how long the CD is, but if it is super long then you should probably use it during the latter half of MC since there are longer fights toward the end of the raid.
---
&gt;HOW IS THAT ANY DIFFERENT in any way shape or form than what WoW has done from Vanilla to now for the past 2 decades??? 
---
WoW is an actual released game ;)
---
Personally love the pre-bis look with true strike/devilsaur, etc. I love being a dps warrior. It’s just solo play that’s a major pain in the ass.
---
Yup, stone form and EA are incredibly good. I really miss dwarves as a dwarf warrior vanilla player
---
As a fellow Westfall Horde warrior with around the same time played, I'm right there with you. I picked Westfall because it was a High pop PVE server. Problem was I didn't find out it was only High Pop because Alliance have 75%+ of the balance until I was already mid 20's with a couple days played and sunk cost fallacy. I pushed on and on now I'm 60 with 20 days played and no chance I would ever reroll as much as I'd like to play on a pvp server.
---
There really is no secret. It is just the sheer freaking amount of time spent. And where did all that time come from?
---
It's because they:
---
- Probably took time off work to get a jump on the game on release
---
- They find some way to play the game during work hours
---
- When you're working or at school, they're not. All that time you're spending doing those things, they're playing the game
---
- Do you have kids and are raising a family? Chances are, that they are not. And if they are married with kids, the stark reality is they are on the computer almost all the time. And their spouse is doing everything from cleaning the house, raising the kids, cooking dinner, taking the kids to school, extra-curricular activities where it's just one parent sitting there watching that piano recital, that big sports game, all the moments that it's one parent being a parent, and the other playing World of Warcraft.
---
I've seen this stuff man, over the many years of playing WoW. It's all about who's putting more time into the game in lieu of all the other life stuff that's going on around them. I've seen military dads who finally come home from their deployments, and to their spouse, they're home, but well they're barely around physically, because they're always playing WoW.
---
you guys dont just head to next boss while the loot is rolled off?
---
Or if you do, how fucking long does rolling take jeez!
---
If I was you I would be playing undead, because I would love their walking and animations.
---
Not sure if she was Famous before, but the name was Fayejin

this might be what you are looking for  [Serenity Now Crash Funeral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEpv7YxnLCQ)
---
What stat, though?
---
if your guild isn't using consumables now i hate to break the news to you about future raids.
---
That's the one that got me. /camp seems so innocent.

And you’ve made it a shitshow of epic proportions.

Also private company. Freedom of speech doesn’t apply here. Just like Twitter, YouTube, etc. they make the rules. If they wanted to perma this guy and all the other accounts they can.
---
\#NoChanges
---
It's unacceptable that the server remained up during that battle.
---
Exactly.  
---
They needed a modern backend 
---
The main reasons was there was no way in hell blizzard could run with the old user/password system and not integrate the game on battlenet.  
---
The world bosses / world massive pvp is going to suffer.  
---
The main problem with BRM is that it’s actually between two zones as fighting often stars outside then go inside.  We actually have zoning between zones here also in the middle of a battle ground making the situation worse.  
---
But 100v100 fights dc many in old vanilla 
---
100 paladins vs 100 shamans for example had tons of dc back in the old client.  
---
And how often did you end up in more then two groups doing for the same world boss at the same time back then? I had once such encounter on my server we actually let one group go at boss then when they failed we killed boss as he reset.  
---
Now I know we have 10-15 guilds capable instead of 2-4 but the risk of them clashing as a boss spawns is low.
---
6 for me as well, which I don't think is bad, however the last 3 MC's...two pieces of nightslayer.
---
You found 200 Alliance on Skeram? Nice
---
Why would storage latency have any effect on player latency? It's a function of CPU, memory and network capabilities. Not to mention, VMs are capable of using local storage, not that what would be an issue as network based storage is perfectly acceptable for even the most IO intensive operations. In fact, most major cloud providers by default provision your VMs with network storage as default. And the talk about VMs being much slower is plain wrong. VMs approach near bare metal performance in nearly all usecases, bare metal is a dying breed and mostly used for hypervisors. The performance hit is in the 1-5% range.
---
I would be shocked if Blizzard is using HDDs for their game servers, most companies are using all SSD these days, with HDDs being relegated for specialty purposes (security cameras, backup storage, etc.)
---
being top dps is not the goal of a nightfall build lol, also I'd say doing half dps of fury while boosting all caster dps is a pretty good damn tradeoff
---
BiS warlock tank chest!
---
Yeah that’s it. 
---
Spriest are a one minute wonder with no sustain.
---
Farm SM till your eyes bleed
---
Not sure if this is common knowledge but you can complete this as a group of priest if you all have the eye. 
---
The priest who accepts the quest is the only one who can move, the others stay put by questgiver and just spam heals... it even worked when the person died and got a Res. 
---
Saved my GF countless hours as there was a group of priest all waiting for quest respawns. 
---
Goodluck!
---
Theres a vendor right outside the greymane wall one of the refugees is blind and is neutral to both factions
---
I just don't get how no one is seeing this coming...
---
Kinda I've done it with gurads/flightmasters
---
Tone the hysteria down a notch.
---
Week after P2 launch the crazy 150v150s will basically stop existing. Why would you plan one when you know the game can't handle it? People will try for a bit and give up.
---
I agree it's disappointing, but it's extremely unlikely this will kill the game. Mass PvP is not a huge % of total game time. But as usual, gamer community has to claim the sky is falling over every significant setback. We've already forgotten classic launch, probably one of the smoothest mass MMO launches in existence. We've already forgotten the political snafoos of late.
---
This will blow over like anything else.
---
Yeah, I think things would have picked up significantly at that point, but we never made it that far. Good luck! What level are ya at?
---
&gt; **No talents ...are taken into account**
---
Makes this kinda pointless then, wouldn't you say?
---
Or the old "/em has reported you Away From Keyboard and you will be removed from the battleground in 20 seconds. To cancel, please enter /afk cancel."
---
As do the alliance. Racials like stoneform, fearward, escape artist and perception. Better access to BRD (by far the most popular end game dungeon area) and calling reinforcements from Stormwind/Ironforge is far earlier then calling them from Org/Undercity.
---
Both factions have their ups and downs but people will always take the easy route and blame everything, but themselves.
---
If you look to a few of his replies, he actually says that exactly. 
---
&gt;Quel'Serral is 2.0, Dal Rend's offhand is 1.8, that's a total swing time of 3.8, which is slower than Bonecrusher which is 3.0. ... Do you not add the QS and DR together? Does one not wait for the other? Are they constantly hitting at the same time?
---
This is why it takes 15-20 minutes instead of 5.  You cant pull the whole place because of this.
---
Right on. I'm jealous haha
---
So actually I was in this battle and it seemed like the actions weren’t actually happening when the server was behind, so I assume it would apply to the boss too. Likely the boss would just swing once or twice a minute along with the server tick, just a thought who knows really.
---
Hey quick heads up, you can save yourself some time by just riding over to Wallace the Blind at the Greymane wall, rather than porting to UC.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=3534/wallace-the-blind
---
I'll argue warlocks have the easiest time questing, but druids can level faster. After lvl 20, you can get up to 30% move speed which helps out a shit ton. Ofc, it falls off at 40 when the lock gets a free mount, then later the 500g epic mount. At 60, druids can get into more groups cause they can do every role, but locks have great damage output. There's a lot of give and take.
---
If you're an objectively evil dude, go warlock. At 60, mosey over to redridge and put one curse on every Alli scum you see. Did they run out of range into town? Good thing they can't see the stealthed succubus about to one shot them while you stand 60 yards out.
---
&gt;The people laughing at this just aren't efficient in their leveling is all.

Or don't have as much time as you do. You could be one of the best speed levelers, but if you can't put in the hours regularly then it's a pain in the ass to reroll.

Stop being a snowflake and move on.

For reference in high school I raided 4-5 nights a week in vanilla (6-11 pm) and in college it was about 3 days a week from 6-11 pm.  I'm 31 years old now and I don't regret playing it in high school since it kept me out of trouble but I definitely missed out on better experiences by playing it in college.  I had fun but it wasn't worth it.
---
Definitely doable. Healed it at 55 as Holy/Disc priest and it was fine because the tank was pretty well geared. Certainly easier with levels, and you’ll find some people who don’t want to group with anyone not 60.
---
"original game"... Servers crashes indiscriminately with 200 ppl in 1 zone. Pick one.
---
100% boomkin
---
Shrug not going to totally disagree, I mean you speak some truth. There are some guilds who are efficient, are comprised of gamer types and are generally quite good at the game.
---
Then there the guilds who aren't quite as skilled, are mostly social to be totally honest, but they're stepping into MC for the first time and take upwards of 20-30 minutes just to co-ordinate everyone(much of that time spent babysitting the drama-stirrers).
---
Each types of groups have a blast and enjoyment in their own way. I hesitate to call the social guilds "suck" because well, 15 years ago I used to be in one and genuinely loved the conversation. But they are not raiders by any stretch of the imagination.
---
&gt; Is this a bug?
---
Ayy
---
If he ring CD is 30 min. The ring in question creates a 500 damage shield around caster that increases mp5 by 22 as long as the shield is active. The shield stays for 30 minutes. Basically it’s 22 mp5 if you can manage to keep your shield on you(by not taking more than 500 damage) it’ll last 30 minutes right when ring comes off CD. Incredibly hard to use don’t bother. Good in dungeons maybe if your group is so good that healer has no chance of even taking a random auto from a mob.
---
&gt;It is harder to scale one shard big enough to handle everyone than to create infinite smaller shards for chunks of the population.  It is very possible the system architecture itself would have to change in order to compensate for this issue.
---
I think you hit the nail on the head if I had to guess.  Classic follows the games more modern architecture where they scale horizontally and not vertically due to low demand on a single shard. 
---
It's probably containerized and managed by kubernetes or something and is not architecture to hand 100s of players on the same shard.
---
Whereas the private servers are either running on a single physical server or a fat ass VM in the cloud. 
---
If I had to guess this is simply a result of classic wow running a modern architecture that was created to address modern issues. Unfortunately classic is stuck with classic issues, such as players wanting to actually be in the same spot doing a lot of things. LOL.
---
every single thread about levels devolves into some reverse dick measuring contest where everybody wants to declare just how 'behind' they are
---
Targeting the leveling audience for gold doesn’t sound great.
---
Haha, go play a mmo where there are no faction and wpvp mean you vs everyone and not carebear wpvp like wow which is 55%vs 45%
---
Maybe OP lost a bet or something? I don't know why anyone would willingly play a female cow.
---
Just go fury arms so you can dps well. You will struggle immensely if you dont have tactical mastery in dungeons. I tank every dungeon as full fury/arms just fine. Just have a good mixture of hit on your gear and youll do just fine. 
---
Get a threat meter if you don't already got one so you're familiar with how much threat your spells are doing. 
---
Revenge&gt;sunder&gt;heroic strike&gt;shouts and if enough rage incorporate blood thirst is how I do it. Had plenty of experience tanking in vanilla on a warrior over the years and unless it's a heavy caster group most dps dont really pull. The odd geared rogue with cds but you can just do a taunt into mocking blow and taunt and things should be dead by then.
---
Good luck. Check out the warriors discord  fight club. It's definitely a lot of eliticism min maxing but there's a lot of people there that do the proper math and you'll get pretty much any question you need answered.

dude who cares you're playing with you're friends thats what matters dont forget it
---
&gt;Sounds like we need to unsubscribe and stop paying until they fix the issue to send a message that this is not acceptable. 
---
People have been threatening to do exactly that since Vanilla. It has never gained enough traction to amount to anything, and a new effort today would be no different. The vast majority of people who play Classic would continue to do so, thus a movement such as this would hardly even be a blip on Blizzard's radar.
---
I for one can not be convinced to unsub just because of poor server performance in a 400 person wpvp setting. I'm certain I'm not alone in that.
---
Farm SM Arm and Cath, and mix in RFD until you're ready for ZF in your mid-40s
---
When going for threat and you aren’t rage capped you’re gonna be using heroic strike a ton so you want as fast of a weapon as you can get, and even 2.1 speed is pretty slow.  It also has to do with available builds an talents for warriors for 2h vs DW while getting the prot talents you need.
---
I wonder if this was found on [Dwarven Tinder]

Satyrs are fantastic. Fel cloth and rune cloth plus demonic runes are op.

It always reminded me of a cutout of the OG Blue Eyes White Dragon card. Maybe there was some Warcraft 3 map that had that as the tooltip and that’s why I connect it, but it kind of looks similar also!

---
Hit after the yellow cap for a rogue is still a stat priority over nearly everything else since more then half of a raiding rogues damage comes from white hits. Not to mention each point of additional hit raises your soft crit cap. 
---
There isn't a single spreadsheet in existence that would prio shadowcraft anything over the generally accepted his pieces. On Kronos, Darkmantle 4 piece was bis due to a broken proc rate on the energy regen set bonus, but nothing like that has been reported on classic. Shadowcraft is shit, it's got spirit on it ffs. If you actually wear that to raids you'll be looking at blue parses.
---
In theory, but when they design each shard to only be able to handle 20 people so they can cram 100 shard instances on a single physical machine, it makes each shard run worse than it would otherwise be able to.
---
Don't focus on trying to find the best farming method yet,  if you're a fresh 60 you should have TONS of quests left - focus on finishing those while mixing in raiding and 60 lvl dungeons,  get all your keys

W/o PVP, or world bosses, or 1/5 the raids they wanted to put in the game. 
---
I mean i get ya, but u got to see what im on about. Its two sides of the same coin... Blizz just did it with more PR and Advertising behind it
---
What I enjoyed about your post is how refreshing it is that you're upfront, you're transparent on just how much sheer time you're spending on the game.
---
Versus so many others here who hit 60 within the first few weeks and somehow claim they're casual. Ya right. Anyone can do the math here and there is just no way.
---
Woow thats New to me
---
/played?

And people wonder why Live has so many difficulty options and depth of activities.
---
Warcraft is the ultimate compulsion-driven game.  It wrote the book on how to keep people playing.  Said people got really good at WoW leveling in the last fifteen years.

There it is, the alt-right's favorite phrase.
---
On skeram, no queues.
---
I mean it really doesnt take THAT long.
---
There's an obvious explanation for this. Each individual item of the set isn't an upgrade over other items they have (so they sit in the bank), but the set bonus would make the set of tier pieces an upgrade. But the tier gloves are required for whatever bonus they're going for, and they can't afford to lose the hit from the other gloves, so there is no point in using any of the tier items.
---
In Blizz we trust?
---
I mean not in a 1v1 but i wont be able to 1v3
---
For instances like mara, a lvl 60 will invite you to the group,  you wait inside the entrance,  they blast through to the boss and kill them,  and if the item you want drops you pay them and go loot it
---
&gt; I remember back during development they gave us some assurance that the lag problems in BFA were due to the more complicated spell effects of BFA

---
Well you probably want the key, so go get the key.  This would be a prison-side quest run.  Sometimes hard to find since few people bother with prison after they get the two worthwhile quests done.  SF key isn't absolutely required since others will have it, but if you are wanting to organize runs you are better off having one than asking for it when filling.
---
Depending on faction there's the eye of org / IF songstone quest in prison which you can try to start at the same time, which involves one of the prisoners.  The last part of that quest is a "save princess" run which is a special run for the quest reward item and not often run since it involves not killing the princess who drops some great healer gear.  Worth noting, you will have to be patience to find a group to save princess, but quest reward item is great for casters, bis for some. 
---
The most common runs then would be arena/anger, arena/anger+golem (at healer request), a mish/mash "quest run", and then lava run (emperor/princess, jump down at incendius). Lava runs also pick up MC attunement on the way since its like one extra 20 second fight to grab on the way.  99% of emperor/princess kill runs are going to be lava runs for people who have already done quest cleanups prior and are farming gear. 
---
Specific runs for flamelash, incendius, fineous, etc. are rare and usually just sorta tacked on to general "quest runs" since everyone is in it for a long run cleaning up misc stuff all over the place.  These quest runs usually do a couple of the quests at guzzler, maybe fineous, and maybe chest of seven, flamelash/incendius, etc.  Usually everyone will just state what they need to clean up and everyone will run it.  "Quest run" is a good advert for "catch all, whatever everyone in party needs" sort of thing but may not include a full clear since thats going to be a long run already...
---
Looks like Prat.
---
There isn't a whole lot to do at 60 for me now. I can farm gold, run dungeons for minor upgrades, and raid. I can only raid once a week, and I'm geared enough that I don't need to do the dungeons anymore. Farming rep for a cool mount is relaxing. Leveling a new character is fun for me especially since it's only a couple days a week.

then why do you need a shield? if you are over geared you're getting fuck all rage, feels so shit man, why suffer through that, why make your game harder for no reason
---
&gt; at the appropriate level for the instance in question
---
none of the pre-60 dungeons need a shield, and you're just misguided or masochistic if you're leveling as protection

Yeah, but work provides a natural balance with a structured routine and schedule.  Daily goals and things to get done.  When your between jobs, there’s no structure unless you put it there, and that’s simply hard.  Cutting out distractions is an important part of that
---
thats actually me. i peel of the casters, when LOS isnt really possible. kick them and guide them to the group.

i am also one of those guys who tends to have evasion off CD in cases in that i maybe need to OT. so many times saving the wipe on drakki with that. feelsgoodman
---
Ah ok. I haven't actually made my character yet to try this yet. I am just in the planning/gear hoarding phase. Not being able to get this changes what I want to get for my chest piece.
---
The game wasn't designed around all the early farm, and plate  knowledge and player quantity.
---
The snakes in WC are also bad about this. One of the worst dungeons for it. Fortunately it's a lowbie dungeon, but still annoying. And if mysteriously get stuck in combat in a dungeon this is often the cause. A shout aggro'd on a rat / snake / cockroach / whatever and it ran away to some corner of the world when you didn't notice.
---
Saw the math a while back, after friendly it was llke 600 or something for the easier / closer quest (the other one has you killing elites far south so runtime etc make it effectively worse despite better reward)
---
no?! liar
---
I appreciate the feedback. Any tips on keeping him alive? I generally try to be attentive to melee damage and his health, but between MC having quite a lot of melee related mechanics, not getting heals on pet, and me managing my rotation/boss mechanics, I find it a bit difficult to keep him up.
---
It's not that they're a mana dump.  The dungeons aren't that hard; you can effectively and efficiently clear any endgame dungeon (maybe not DM:N) with an all 57 group in levelling greens.   The problem is that they don't have initial burst threat and DPS pull off them quickly, which spreads the healing out to the mage/warlock (REAL mana dumps) instead of the warrior who has natural damage mitigation with plate and a shield.
---
Time your runs so they take no less than 12 minutes. If they do, you'll have some downtime. You have to sell and empty bags at some point anyway.
---
Nothing HAS to be done in any kind of order.
---
What they're probably mean is that those particular talents are more beneficial early on than the others.
---
What got me was a lan party where we played custom RPGs in WC3. Going through the similar patterns of choosing a class, a role and finding loot pulled me in. I would've stayed away if it were as easy to play that one custom map as it is to play Wow for the similar feeling. 
---
Also protip: wc3 can easily provide a lot of variety for a lan party without having to download different games.
---
Hi, is there a place for ppl looking for guild? cant find any /r wowclassicguild or something. me and my friend play together and we are 49 lvl atm, we take it slow and chill, and we are in a guild that clears all pve atm but we havnt make any friends so far, we looking for more friendly guild, like a group of ppl like to play together etc. we play Horde in Ten storms if any1 is interested.
---
Its just a matter of what is most useful at which point in time while leveling. In the end it doesnt matter much of course, as you will soon get another talent point while leveling.
---
Druids are great for fel wood satyrs. Moonfire/insect swarm on 4-5 mobs (remember to be aware of the casters). Barkskin into hurricane it all down. Clean up the rest with bear or moonfire did you have the mana for it.
---
I just don’t have the motivation to do the ~10 day grind again. If there’s nothing to do on my main I’m just logged tbh. I definitely understand alting can be fun just seemed to hit a wall

But I’m Level 48 Spriest on EU Gandaling. Looking for someone to duo with to reach 60 ASAP. Can play during the day for the next week, and most evenings from 8pm GMT
---
It really isn't. I just listed that because, to my knowledge, it's the only time Blizzard has even referenced lag as a problem.
---
So much salt... I didnt get my shoulders until \~ run #135-140 of which half of those runs I had it reserved but it just refused to drop. Lost about a dozen of them to other people.
---
When will i be able to craft Ebon hand and Persuader?

It works fine if your are tank #3/4.

They are mid tier right now (behind frost mages, ahead of locks) and only get worse as Vanilla progresses.
---
My third Main just reached 30 *cries in twinkoholic*
---
Really depends on how you play. If you want to level up fast there are skills you should get faster than others. If you want to pvp there are skills you should take first. But overall it really doesnt matter that much, even still it makes a difference
---
We have 6 hunters lol
---
I’ve been doing a combo of pickpocketing and relic coffer runs since I hit 58 months ago.
---
I’ve found that the average worth of each coffer key to roughly 75 silver. If you do get a blue BoE (very rare) that bumps it up but those are an anomaly. So if you walk in with 55 keys you’ll walk out with roughly 40g. Depending on fat stacks and grey drops it may vary but roughly I get 75 silver per key.
---
When keys could be easily bought for 15-20 silver on Herod it was very lucrative. Now keys drop to 30-35 silver a pop. You can still occasionally snipe a stack for a super low bid but it’s much more difficult now. It’s far less lucrative but still a low effort way to make some gold, but if you have to spend 18g to make 40g it’s less worthwhile.
---
Typically I will combine both PP and coffer keys with killing Pyromaster. It’s a lot more time consuming and has some risk but you can do it naked (except for soloing pyro). And you’ll get a lot more gold over a longer period of time.
---
I’ll often go in with 33 keys and combine PP and do it for an hour and get a lot more gold.
---
The other issue with Coffer Keys is how limited they are. If you’re on a server with a ton of low price keys you can actually judge it by GpH but since the keys on Herod are limited by quantity and price I view it as more of a extra side thing to do for quick gold.
---
Technically it is pally and shaman due to them being faction restricted,  but if you disregard those it's the druid.
---
Yeah, I can totally see that. That's why I'm mixing the rep grind. There is also no sense of urgency to level the alt. I'm playing to play, not hit max level.
---
Well I'll be damned.  Been a while but you're probably right.  I just remember being murdered with it at launch.
---
Anyone wanna over/under this guy hasn’t “stuck his dick” in anything in the last year?
---
Lol show me a holy paladin in full plate... they all wearing cloth and leather
---
fury/prot you're swimming in rage from swings and don't need to rely on having mobs on you, this is how you can easily catch up and keep up on multiple mobs
---
As an ongoing policy, especially with a subscription model, it is cheaper to focus on retention of players you risk losing. Sure, this discrete section of players are now ex-players. They wouldn’t have been if Blizzard had focused on retaining them earlier. You seem to be arguing that because they’re gone, Blizzard should not switch it’s design focus back towards retention and creating a sustainable mode over innovating. That’s a shortsighted way of viewing it, because new players today will become ex-players in the future.
---
That was epic
---
well they might get their way soon if they don't fix this fuck.
---
There isn't a solution to this issue, not an immediate one. That's in Blizzard's court.
---
What I'm saying is this won't lead to mass exodus into private servers. The vast majority of the game is not massed world PvP, so most people won't be particularly impacted after the first week calms down.
---
It's a shitty situation, but this post is ridiculously overblowing it when it comes to reactions.
---
This has become a pet peeve of mine. When people use acronyms/abbreviate when they are clearly not going to be understood.

Hate to break your bubble but you will still need all the hit gear for raiding. I wont get into it but between the additional white value and the increased crit cap, it comes out on top of shadowcraft and its rng based/unreliable low ppm.
---
I can assure you people will be selling elementium so if you're motivated to farm enough gold, you can buy them. I'm guessing 500-600g a pop.
---
Isn't 25 agi a 2h enchant?

Meanwhile I'm just sitting here with a handful of /afk macros to toss out in AV.

At what level do you think a warrior can solo Shadowfang Keep?

90 minutes? Takes like three fiddy

what happens?

Ha! With Horde, you don't really have much choice. When out of form, you're trundling about the fields either way. Female cows constantly look "out to lunch," though. I actually raided with someone who changed her druid to a male night elf when that service became available in mid-WotLK, and she loved playing male characters.
---
Sure is... I'm learning so quickly!

Go ahead, tell me you're not what I think you are, troll.
---
Most levels you have some freedom fon the order. IE: I reduced the cooldown of sprint and evasion early because i was tired of running before getting my mount, but things like reducing the energy cost of sinister strike are too good to wait on.
---
In my experience over the years of vanilla in alt raids and pugs hunter are usually some of the first to gear up. Sure your off pieces might not come fast but tier gear for hunters seems to drop a lot. Just in my experience I suppose.
---
Wait you are telling me people knew how to use prnt scrn back in 2007
---
Oh I'm not arguing the relevance of your post at all. That shit just stood out to me
---
&gt; Who uses consumables other than some more basic ones on content that is on farm?
---
Players who want to compete. Like you said, it's on farm anyway so the only fun you'll have is to win the meter. It's not expensive and its more fun than being a bot that doesn't give any effort.

Dope! Going to try this out!

I'm actually right handed, so generally hang a little bit more to the left.
---
/camp logs you out.
---
That happens for me 99% of the time. Yesterday, I found a random chest in Desolace and a [Zealot Blade](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13033/zealot-blade) (worth 6-12g on my server) dropped from it.
---
I agree with that. Blizzard isn't going to fix anything. Their balls fell off years ago. They have no ability to do anything substantial or impressive. That's what happens when accounting starts running your whole company.
---
Yes, well maybe not the best but the best one in a while that is still on my mind
---
Funny way to spell paladin
---
Most likely will see either WSG or AV (if not both) before phase 3. Since P3 brings in BWL for raiders and Darkmoon Faire for casuals.
---
Pretty much this, "quest run" will be a grab bag for whatever people need.  It would not be as loot focused, but would hit more bosses that drop meh-tier loot for quest purposes.
---
I do not understand how I am now part of the problem because I don't agree with spreading awareness.  This is an opinion I hold that spans beyond this specific topic.  Our entire culture these days is about expressing our opinion on things we simply don't need to.  
---
I go to the thread you brought awareness too and I see a bunch of people laughing about the content posted on the Enclave website.   They think it's funny and are making jokes about it, so has the awareness been good and is it making a difference in the world?  This is how we combat racism, by sending thousands of otherwise ignorant users to the source of the platform.
---
So...you don't want a legit classic experience? If the servers aren't at risk of crashing it isn't world PvP.
---
This.
---
I had a day off without anything to do, and 5 levels flew by in a blink of an eye. Otherwise its often a slog.

Time is a big factor in progression.

My succ is always still there when I log out and in. Never had issues with it despawning.

Early on crit dual wield dmg chance to get energy and combo points back are just so useful for leveling

Awesome thanks!

And is the only way I log out. No clue how or why I started doing that.
---
'Saladvault' wtf is he playing on their guild bank??
---
I get that. I guess I should've been more clear. 
---
Op comment was that guilds that aren't consuming now will struggle later I find to be asinine. Plenty of guilds have no care about top 99% parse because there is such a massive rng factor and chasing 200 world buffs. 
---
Lots of these guilds have 10/10 for awhile now and just require basic gfpp on a weekly basis.
---
sell all those things, (somewhere else) and just buy some game time for yourself,

He was at 80% hp, he wasn't exactly in immediate danger. It's just that popping a 30m cd as soon as you get into a fight is totally overkill. It's just an insecure move like... what happens next time the druid comes back?

It won him the fight but it probably wasn't necessary is all. Insecurity is all I'm seeing here.

All of Blizzard's cinematics for WoW are fantastic. But yes I would suggest you watch the BfA cinematics first. It's a bit of a story driven trailer.
---
My fianceé watches the cinematics with me everytime they make a new one and she doesn't even play the game. They're just *that* good.
---
Maybe, maybe not. Depends on the PMs and whether the BGs are ready before BWL. I expect we'll get one, maybe two BGs as a 2.5, but only Blizzard can even potentially answer this definitively and as we've seen they can change their minds.

god damn don't you hate it when trash players do the whole "i played 15 years ago and i know what i'm doing but i'm still crying on reddit" thing. fuck me. you bet they were bad 15 years ago too but just didn't know it. you try explain how they can play better and just get spam downvoted by the noob ass echo chamber brigade and get called a zoomer or a retail kid when you're a 30 year old man lol
---
On my server pally pop is equal to druid pop in the 45-60 range and shamans are a whopping 3% of the pop at those levels while druid and pally are tied at 9% each
---
&gt;You've gotta balance that shit, and I don't mean put in effort to balance it. You have to actually be a person who has a wide array of interests.
---
That sounds terrible.
---
Jokes aside, that's great that the two of you make it work! I agree, just going by the people I've met in and out of game, that WoW is relatively popular among women compared to many other video games. I'm happy with my girlfriend, but on the off chance I'm ever on the market again, I wouldn't necessarily dismiss the idea of dating a WoW player or gamer; I've just always been a little wary of the idea.
---
Yeah we are working on it. We clear mc and onyxia in one evening in 3,30 hours total. Not complaining) Would be nice to truly unload sometimes though.
---
Just ask yourself can I cannibalize alliance with orcs?
---
I use elvui's debuff auras.
---
Word on the street is that it was a 200 v 200. I cant confirm the numbers during the battle, but i can confirm that i saw over 5+ Ally Raids forming in searing gorge outside of kargath  on my way over to STV, and i knew that Onslaught was forming their raids along with a few other guilds on the opposite side.....
---
We got the chest and came in after, and that was the results of the post fight shenanigans.
---
For the coffers you only need stealth and the keys to open 11/12 coffers. Supposedly some races can open the 12th coffer from inside the 11th coffer without shoring the boss, but this activates the golems and you need stealth to drop aggro.
---
If Tauren are able to open all 12 coffers you could do it naked, let the golems kill you and reset while running back.
---
Sixtyupgrades only evaluates gear based on the stat weights inputted by you.  It's not a "smart" evaluation that will re-evaluate gear based on your hit cap.  It treats every single hit% as whatever value you tell it to regardless of whether that's the actual effectiveness in game.

How to identify a Star Citizen cultist: "What is 'released' anyway?"

Nice dress lol
---
Original game, every time. This was also a battle at the seam between two zones so it's not really representative of how every large scale fight is going to pan out. If this were in any other zone or fuck it, even inside the mountain then it probably would have been fine. My guild runs into BRM every week and a raid of 20-30 people are always waiting to try and wipe our guild out on the way in, probably about 100 people with stragglers / bench and we never receive a hiccup of lag. The real issue here is just people fighting on the "loading screen" of zones. Yeah that sucks but the one downside gets a much smoother rest of the entire game.
---
You need the 2 quest drops from BWL (the head of Broodlord Lashslayer and a drop from Nefarian), only 1 person can get the quest item per kill, and you can't start the quest to get the item from Nefarian until the week after getting the Broodlord head since the quest starts from Vael (who is dead by the time you get to Broodlord).
---
There are a lot of expensive mats and elite farming required for the quest, but the 2 quest drops behind the BWL raid lockout are the only bottleneck that can't be overcome with a little (or an obscene amount of) elbow grease.
---
&gt; did he not look at the role he was given
---
That wouldn't even work since /gkick actually isn't the command to kick someone, despite it always being used as a joke. /gremove is the actual command to kick someone.
---
I'd say it's really not that unusual for husbands and wives to play WoW together. Or at least back in the day. Nowadays perhaps the audience for Classic is smaller than it was for WoW at its peak when it was a juggernaut.
---
That is wildly helpful, thank you.
---
I've already done Steps 1 and 3 but haven't unbound the (S) key yet, though I now backpedaling is wrong in 99% of cases and I actively try not to; WASD is just an ingrained habit for me. But I'll take your advice and change up the keys. I might keep forward as (W) though and make back peddle shift+W because my hand rests easier on A/W/D I think. 
---
I might need to invest in a MOBA mouse lol. And will switch over some of my uncommon spells to less used keys. Right now I've got most of those spells on Shift+Q E R T or Ctrl+ 12345 but I think that's wasting space for more valuable skills and/or downranks. 
---
Thanks for all of the advice, I know it will take a while to get used to but it'll make a big difference. 
---
To think, back in TBC I only used 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and pretty much clicked everything else on my warlock lol
---
Always gank every rogue you see. They'll deserve it later
---
16 days ago you were trying to sell your PSN account to play Black Desert Online, what changed?
---
The thing is.. it's not *that* different.  Servers have mostly increased in density, not speed and for a problem that scales with the square of the players involved, the speed difference doesn't buy you a lot of headroom.   Also, any flexibility they've built in to the code because they could rely on shards to make optimization unnecessary will be working against them now.
---
What are some good chat box enhancements or addons? Like colored names by class or a [G] next to guild chat? Or cleanly having them in separate tabs? Also, how do people change the default fonts? Is this within the chat settings?
---
So which way do they run compared to where you're standing / facing?..
---
Worst fad ever, I'll take eating Tide pods back over this Boomer BS
---
Good druids are amazing to play with.
---
Despawning due to flying also works the same way for hunters.
---
Oof
---
Any informative videos of 1v1 rogue duels? Does payo have any videos?
---
Strange, cause a cursory look at warcraft logs shows average hunter damage parses about in line with warriors and rogues, and above frost images. Number 3 on the top end of damage. But, I guess th randos on the net know better haha.
---
In other words, most casual guilds also don't AOE dps bosses. In other words, keep the dogs in. All snake/salamander bosses keep the adds in. As well as use sappers. A good rogue/warriormage will NEVER be beat by a hunter. Same for .
---
What, that they'll have more consumables available for then?
---
Could you elaborate on the fights being mostly auto attacks? Like when are abilities allowed to be casted and what happens to casting specs in these?
---
I feel all Horde races have a huge benefit for warriors.
---
Trolls with beast damage + berserk
---
Tauren with a stun + health pool
---
Undead with an extra fear cleanse + sustain from cannibalizes
---
Orc with stun resist + Bloodfury (if you hate your healers)
---
I actually decided to get those 7 days trial and I realized how shitty Black Desert Online... It's a sad time for mmorpg lovers and i've been trying to look everywhere for a good one with a lot of people, and it's not like the idea of going to a mmorpg of more than a decade ago excites me a lot, but right now it's probably the best option.
---
It's so sad, you can't do anything :(
---
There is no AGI Enchant in this phase and the BSH is rare and you would need two.
---
Barbarous Blade is a way better option anyway.
---
I've had issues with soul shards not always returning, however I couldn't say for sure what the actual cause is as it works sometimes and not others.
---
Guild Executioner needs to be a rank in all guilds.
---
rip
---
it's better to trade it to someone that might actually need it and at the same time plays wow.
---
If they decide to do a 2.5 they should put in the .5 tier gear imo.
---
I have been grabbing chests, 2 blues out of them so far, but both were 5 gold ones (the 1h mace out of one, forget what was the second one). I would probably skip most of the chests if you couldn't get mind thrust bracers or the 2 weapons out of them, although I have gotten a meadow ring out of one so they might be worth doing anyway.
---
There is no honour in this....... yet.
---
Absolutely not, with worst hardware and network connectivity it was better than this
---
Until BGs release there are going to be people farming wpvp for rep very hard.  I expect it will be pretty bad, ganking up by a solid 4-5x at least, dedicated groups will be roaming certain arenas, particularly ~48-55 leveling zones at the bottom edge of honor for 60s.  
---
It could be awful on servers with high faction imbalance.  If there's some balance then ganking groups will get counter hunted, there's more reward to respond to /3 help requests now, etc.  Those not actively engaging may become lower priority targets, but that doesn't mean you'll get ignored if the opportunity is there.
---
I got it on my first run a couple days ago. Did 4 more runs after that and nothing dropped..
---
I wouldn't say they aren't noticing it. Do you compliment every mage on their sheep or counterspell? Or hunters when they actually trap something? (lol) Or warlocks whenever they banish/seduce a target?  
---
Probably not. These things are pretty basic and are kind of just expected to happen, so it's not worth mentioning to most people. That said, I always like to compliment priests who are quick to dispel harmful magic debuffs, or tanks who instantly taunt when I'm not paying attention to my threat.
---
Our guild is led by speed runners for other games, and we are a "casual speedrun guild." We've mostly just been focused on beating our own cleartime record in MC. Now that our record is with world buffs, the only way we can beat it is with world buffs. That's why we use them, at least.
---
I just answered your question. I don't care about your explanation.
---
It's a DPS gain, and I've found it to be useful for PVP, but it's less mana-efficient than sticking with frost bolt. It would be fine for shorter raid fights and clearing trash if you want to pad the DPS charts, but if you want to sustain mana, I wouldn't work it into that rotation.

How original
---
I think it’s going too slow
---
try here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Gandling/
---
Everyone else loves the shield though so if you go AOE grind (doesn't matter with a smaman or a group of mages) and everyone trades agro you will be happy for that instant heal of 350 HP.
---
For sure.  I can't wait to PvP but these kind of massive grand scale battles are just shit shows.  Fun for the novelty but that's about it.
---
.5 didnt come with BWL it came with AQ
---
That as an entirely useless comment then.
---
Might be a typo but there are no epic BoEs that drop in SFK or any content until the early 40s. BoE blues for sure though.
---
Keep mining, very useful to supply engineering mats. Especially if you are planning to level both gnomish and goblin
---
Also depruning abilities.   It doesn't would like they are changing much about class gameplay though, which is a shame.   I miss burning embers...
---
(X) Doubt
---
Hahaha same, and sometimes the msg would be from the opposing faction!
---
imagine being you and thinking sex is some rare thing.  im married and my wife is pregnant.  don't let your mom forget to pick you up some pizza pockets on her way home
---
Don't forget that smelting increases your level too. So it's not 100% scouting for nodes, pulling your hair out, only to realize you've been circling the map behind some 60 on an epic mount for the last 45 minutes. 
---
Happens. And check out the GatherMate add-on to keep track of where you've found nodes.
---
Yea. The blizzard store
---
I'm stoopid :)
---
So how does one go about using tinder? Asking for a friend.
---
No Kittyyyy that's a BAAAAAD KIIIITTTTYYYYY!
---
I can link you my healing spreadsheet for holy paladins. 
---
It accounts for everything. 
---
HPS, Heal/Mana, seconds of uptime before out of mana. And everything is adjusted to reflect your crit rate, mana regeneration, fight durations, healing power (and how it scales with cast time). Everything. 
---
It also can be used to compare gear, and show whether a new item is an upgrade or not.
---
I wouldn't be opposed to getting WSG/AV before BWL so I don't get fomo of choosing to raid instead of pvp or vice versa.
---
I'm in agreement that we see Phase 2.5 with BGs by January at the latest.  I don't think massive scale world PVP is going to be very fun with the current servers and people will be frustrated with the PVP grind during the initial part of this phase.  I hope I'm wrong, but I think it'll be a lot more 5man death squad ganking Winterspring/Plaguelands than insane 100v100 BRM deathmatches.
---
You're just projecting now.
---
On your way out, see Rule #5.
---
Okay, fair. I mean obvious, I was thinking outside of that.
---
Spell Batching for the fucking WIN!!
---
When mine will actually lay on my lap for 5 minutes hes been getting in the habit of putting his paw on my wrist and not letting me really move it.  Hes kind of a jerk like that...

Oh well.  My mouse sensitivity is fairly high, so just using wrist works while questing...lol

But kitty also just wants to play :(

Eh a lot of rude people have a decent amount of sex. We live in a society.

 I wanna roll alliance and on a pvp server. Im est based but willing to go PST if necessary. Anyone?
---
I've seen this one a couple of times :
---
\[person1\] How do you leave the guild ?
---
person2 has left the guild
---
person3 has left the guild
---
Working as intended
---
Lol a good mage? You mean a mage that hits frostbolt better than other mages? No one is talking about the top 10 guilds. This was a general post about the state of dps as a whole. Are you in a top 10 guild? No? Hunters doing more damage than mages is true for 90 percent of the player base. Average damage parses have a whole lot more significance than the 1% of players who pull out 1200 dps every fight. Next time I'll preface my comment with "except for 1% of the playerbase" to make you feel better.
---
Even then, they're a rare beast and they know it. Our chances are a little over a snowball in hell.
---
No, they are not rushed. Anyone crying "im only able to play 1 hour a week and will miss out on endgame content!!!", thats literally what vanilla was like for people who didnt play a lot or anyone who didn't start at launch, the good thing is even entry level raids will always be relevant and no one will miss out, even if it means doing MC in 5 months instead of today. This FOMO is ridiculous.
---
The WoW Board Game is great. I own a copy of it with everything. It's a wonderful conversion, except it's built very much so to be PVP-focused, alliance vs horde, and requires a lot of work to make it work "single" faction.
---
 It has two expansions. The first, Shadow of War, adds more content to the base game. Think of it as filling the game out, versus adding a ton of NEW stuff. It makes a lot of what it came with work better.
---
The second expansion, TBC, adds Outland, more level/talent/items/etc. I think you need the first for the 2nd, but I'm not sure. It also adds dungeons and dungeon loot, which kinda broke the game - it's a bit too efficient compared to the rest.
---
Underrated comment.
---
nope, when you switch the main hand you trigger a gcd
---
Do you think this would be doable as a level 40 warrior ? Or should I look at a lower level dungeon ? I want to grind out gold for my mount , but I actually kinda don't want to get too much exp because I'm waiting for a friend of mine to catch up
---
Ungoro, Feralas, Hinterlands, Felwood, Blasted Lands too.
---
dont worry those same raids will be relevant content forever in classic wow so you got time lmao
---
I found /camp by myself, thought it would give me rested xp anywhere I logged out. Like you sleep at camps just like inns right? I mean I played a hunter, so....
---
I bet it's their shitty sharding tech, you could get lag like this out questing in BFA with 5 people in the area.
---
They need to wait at least 3 months before releasing BWL, if not 4-5. There's no way people will want world ranking for that long, so yes I see a BG phase 2.5 to be VERY likely, probably in January.
---
It makes perfect sense to release like this, the original phase system was garbage, I hope they do the same for patch 1.7 and 1.8 (currently set in phase 4 only), and seperate them. 1.7 is ZG only, 1.8 is nightmare dragons and pre AQ stuff unlocked. Way WAY too much content for one phase, ZG is a crazy hard grind(2-3 hours of raiding every 3 days on top of all the stuff you already need to do), and 1.8 is almost worse if you go for pre AQ Cenarion Circle exalted by farming the summoned bosses.
---
While there aren't a lot of warlock mains, there's a ton of warlock alts. They're a powerhouse when it comes to pvp.
---
Also I heard somewhere that the classic servers are hosted on AWS. Way less control that a VMware environment in their data center
---
Nope, still got the 20 sec timer outside of taverns/Towns
---
I don't think you even know what an API is, because like I said, this isn't something available for developers. If it was there would be dozens of addons able to track enemy player coordinates right onto your map, yet there are none. Better call scooby do, mystery solved.
---
If you are facing a rogue there is nothing better than Freezing Band. To the point where rogues in the CDL want it for Rogue mirrors. If that procs during the opposing Rogue's stunlock it's game over.
---
It is a DPS increase. However it is worthless in MC because everything is either immune to fire or highly resistant to it.
---
Perhaps you should start acting like an adult then.
---
So to devide that so you take the lowest or highest shown number?
---
Fuck this is just such a tremendous joke from blizzard, their potato server structure or whatever you wanna call it runs so fucking poorly, some dedicated nerds did this ten times better with some donated money..
---
I’m not saying there are no choices in the talent system whatsoever - just that there are a lot of false choices you’re railroaded through to get to the real choices
---
Obviously talents differ from build to build so yeah it’s not all cut in stone. But the possibility to brick your character isn’t proof of a talent system where “choices matter”.
---
I don't know, you can be married and have a pregnant wife and STILL be a virgin.  (lol)
---
Well to be fair that would probably exacerbate the problem not help it.  Cause then people would *actually* know where the faction they wanted to go to was dominant, and attract those types of players to that type of realm.
---
What logical person playing tauren druid wants to join a pvp/rppvp  realm with 15% horde to 85% alliance?
---
Jealous
---
Does it work if they already have the buff or do they have to click it off?
---
Back in vanilla there was also talk that the mana generated by blessing of wisdom transferred threat back to the Paladin instead of the person who got the mana.
---
I used a mix spell power gear and mitigation gear based on the fight. I had styleens, elementium reinforced bulwark, all the plate tank gear from aq40, t2 etc.
---
Spec was 11 holy, 32 prot, rest I shifted around from time to time.
---
Tanked all aoe trash in 40 man's, nef phase 2-3, the second Drake in bwl, fankriss, all zg, naxx trash and helped on some bosses, most of MC, etc.
---
Judgement of wisdom with a fast weapon was key. I also had the crafted gloves that gave 8 mana per hit (16 with SoR).
---
100v100 BRM doesn’t work currently. We broke the mountain on skeram yesterday. Literally couldn’t move or cast spells.
---
Keys value averages 65s each
---
Less cost per key (il use 20s based on what you got at but note most servers you cant find for under 30s)
---
You can grab 11 per run.
---
You can do 5x runs/hr.
---
(.65-.2)\*11\*5 = 24.75g/hr on average (19.25 if you buy keys at 30s).
---
Issue is, GL finding enough supply of keys to support this farm.
---
1. No
---
2. No
---
3. No, unless you count the fact you asked me Questions 1 and 2
---
Grats! I should have rolled a druid, 3 runs in MC with about 5boss down each time.. not a single shaman item at all.. yet I've seen 2+ druid each run.. was only one resto druid last night and he made out with 3 pieces of T1.
---
I know that but you could say the same thing about deep prot needing hit vs mitigation, people make lists despite navigating tradeoffs. 
---
Theoretically ideal fury prot gear maximizes agility hit crit and stamina main difference being not caring about defense since you actually want to be crit. BiS lists always subjective especially for tanking because its not just tps and not just mitigation. Doesnt mean ya cant make em
---
Thats exactly what I'm referring to, I'm not sure at what point the servers will start struggling but I think the server issue will prevent any large scale world PVP from happening.
---
Fair enough, it sounds super in-depth like a group of five could have a blast. The PvP aspect is really cool, but I imagine there’s some good over content too like raids and what not (I mean you mentioned some dungeons in TBC) 
---
I have a few buddies who are board game geeks that never played wow, you think they’d have fun with it?
---
The pacing is faster than it was back in the day. We're months ahead of where we were in Vanilla: 
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y0oFgZLdJB45OqLU42n3z_ykmdDIjd-W4TJMTkUhTwE/edit#gid=0
---
Because you clearly arent raiding and are commenting on something you know about second hand.
---
Amazon?
---
Ok dad
---
It will never go away until they go back to a single physical server.  These cloud servers are shit.  I called it like 100x since the classic was announced.  Wpvp is never gonna work with cloud servers.
---
I've been getting people with /camp for weeks. It's such an unknown command, with a sensible but vague action.
---
I think it was implemented because /camp was the EverQuest logout command.
---
You can, but it sucks. Without double vanish there's is either more down time or more death. The choice is yours.
---
Never promised to be a 200v200 battle simulator.. uuhhh, what?
---
&gt;Your post has just a bunch of speculation and opinion and no substance at all.
---
I am really confused by this post. We go from P2 to AQ GATES in the same sentence like its happening soon.
---
Just because your wife let you have sex with her 3 times doesn't mean you don't have a pretty obviously fucked up view of women. Tell your wife I feel bad for her, if she exists.
---
Yes, I’m not saying there aren’t any choices in the talent system. I’m saying that the specific “choices” that fuck you up if you don’t pick a certain way aren’t actually choices. In that way there is objectively a lot of false complexity, but no one would say say *all* of the complexity is false.

Chance on Cast: Attract IRL Pet to Caster
---
Private servers handled it better.  I fought in multiple fights of comparable size on northdale and lightbringer and there was maybe 1-2 seconds of lag.  Not great,  but manageable.
---
Big true, I’m just hoping I have enough time to scrape out the blue PvP gear and I’ll be happy
---
I dont know man.... she may only know how to Vanish....or worse Backstab!!

I recommend it even more if your herbalism
---
well you should be hotting yourself regardless before the pull.
---
Imagine sacrificing sleep as an adult to play a 15 year old video game. Yikes
---
The point of batching in the first place is to increase the efficiency of combat calculations on the server. If batching has any effect at all in these kind of scenarios, it would actually be to make things run more smoothly.
---
"Grats now go take  a shower and go to sleep" was a pretty common greeting for new HWLs
---
Whats a....Lvl 60?
---
\---Signed Dad of kids who play sports.
---
I swapped from that addon to a Weakaura and like it a lot more.
---
Naw, they're rushing it. End of story.
---
Also, take \~10 days of playtime to hit 60 = 240 hours needed.
---
And say you play 5 nights a week, Sun-Thurs (and have a life on weekends so dont play Fri/Sat).
---
And say you play 8pm-12pm on those 5 nights.  Thats 4 hours X 5 days = 20 hours a week of time played.
---
So 240 hours needed / 20 hours a week = 12 weeks to hit 60.
---
Game was release Aug 26th, that would mean **Nov 26th to hit 60 playing 5 nights a week for the "above casual" player**.
---
I would have figured about a month post that for BiS dungeons/some raiding, and then Phase II at end of Dec/early Jan.  Sadly, no.
---
Game is being rushed.  Most players are still trying to ding 60 and Phase II is here.....
---
In some extreme cases the points in the skill tree have next to no impact on your character.
---
Rend in the arms tree at level 10 does 2,3 damage per second (28/12), with its first point your damage is increased to (32,2/12) which is 2,6 damage per second.
---
The different is so miniscule that there is pretty much no reason to put points into the tree in the beginning. I'm not even sure the very first point actually increases the damage per tick at all.
---
Therefore in this case putting points into cruelity and then 2 into parry,  you are already at level 17 and at level 20 you already get the next rank of rend. You wont have wasted the points in rend nearly as long.
---
This anecdote shows why sometimes it makes sense to put points into your tree in a certain order.
---
Another one would be imp ghostwolf. You can put points into it from level 16 onwards, but you only can learn the spell at level 20. No point putting points into improving an ability you havent even learned yet.
---
Lol, you can't even interpret statistics and yet talk to the guy as if you have any clue of what you're talking about. The statistics on warcraftlogs are normalized and based on the 95th percentile, meaning they are represented by guilds who actually KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING. That means including flasks. Finish elementary school before you make comments on the internet buddy.
---
&gt; A good hunter is much easier to play than a good mage 
---
HAHAHAHAHAAHAAHAHAHA, pressing frostbolt over and over for 2 hours is so hard yeah. A good hunter who actually needs to weave and use multiple abilities is infinitely harder (and is actually one of the hardest classes) than a good mage. What does a good mage even mean, clicking on your food buffs and having the right spec? Bhwahaha. 
---
There is absolutely nothing difficult about a mage and a hunter will always top the charts.
---
So my server is super unbalanced. We outnumber Horde by a lot and the lack of world PvP really bums me out
---
But after seeing things like this, maybe it's not so bad
---
Because /camp was the logout command for EverQuest.
---
Yeah and look at the great state the servers are in WITH layering 
---
It’s like you wanted to double down on being a jackass
---
Oh, totally true, I was arguing about emberseer not dropping much of value, not the rest of it.
---
I would think the best route available to a healer would be 2-3 person DM east drop runs.
---
Thanks I actually have this add-on but will look closer how to set up tick counter
---
Honestly you both should be going ret and arms/fury. Then after 40 you can put points into holy and prot. More dps output and each of you should be able to offspec heal and tank. I've been able to tank as a 2h warrior in every dungeon including brd.

Can't you just go feral dps and grind mobs? Probably shouldn't be too difficult without respeccing, just swap out gear.
---
Then it becomes a math problem on what's more efficient...looting 12, but having to run back; versus looting 11 and doing the alt switch method.
---

---
Same faction training mobs into you is bannable. Just report them.
---
I feel you on the limited time. BRD is rough...
---
Im sorry for trying to point out red flags to you.  Im sure my advice would be useless for you my mistake.
---
Segra Darkthorn isn't a Civilian so no DHK. But she is one of the few 60s you have to worry about as an Alliance attacking Xroads. So she doesn't drop from one shot like most of the NPCs there.
---
represent
---
I ask exactly the same question. We have multiple Warriors in the guild, but either they don't want to tank, or rarely login. I'm the only reliable regular tank in the guild.
---
Mind explaining a little further?
---
If you use your excess rage on sunders prior to stance swapping and WW’ing (25 rage) 4 targets, how is it better to just sunder (15 rage) one?
---
In order to sunder those same 4 targets you would need 60 rage, so I’m not certain why its not good AoE threat to supplement with WW.
---
Not trying to come at ya, just genuinely curious why it’s not advisable in your eyes!
---
okay but thats not hte players fault, players like to pvp. The problem is that blizzard let the allies run to ther servers and didnt fix balance only made it worse.
---
Different person, dude.
---
against TOS to aoe grind? was that actually said to you?
---
yeah i'm saying i liked weak aura more, specifically https://wago.io/uy-Cz7oZl 
---
I was able to remove my mana bar off my health, and set that where i liked it and see the ticks.
---
You can also set up warnings at different health %'s
---
What does it mean to be “flagpoled”?
---
I completely agree. If Blizzard wanted to make a cinematic mini series, I'd watch it.  
---
I just fell behind. I think the last thing I played and saw was... (being vague here for the sake of spoilers) the land seige of that city. So, since that was over a year ago, I'm guessing I have quite a bit of catching up to do.
---
&gt;yes, but at 11/12 the efficiency
---
As with everything druid related, so it is with this.
---
no, I always go 1v1 or 1v3. I let 1v1s happen I don't interfere. Ur judgements are meaningless.
---
But imagine Classic+, a game we all know and love, but with little Easter eggs like this that are actually useful in some way.
---
Don't need to click it off. Just GBoK spam.
---
They're not wrong.
---
I mean it gives joy to griefers what can I say. Why do you Think every minecraft Server has a grief protection :p
---
What kind of gear when feral?
---
I started leveling on release and it was fun. I’m leveling in my alt now and there are much much less people around. So it’s a much different experience if you aren’t around the same level as the core base
---
First people say hordes want to make it unbalanced, now they say they would flock to make other server imbalanced when their own server is already horde sided? Which one is it?
---
Everybody is. Shadow priests are cancer. They must be destroyed.
---
I agree! Let’s compare Perception to 25% stun resist!
---
What is parses?
---
No worries man :) If you need any help or tips please feel free to ask.
---
It'll probably take a few tries to get the princess/tinker kills down but once you do you could probably do it blindfolded
---
Nope, it functions just like /logout.
---
Level 43 priest.  Where do I quest to get gear?  I'm using gravestone scepter wand and have the hat and shoulders from SM cath but I feel like I havent had a proper upgrade in several levels now.  (Mostly shadow specced for leveling but healing in dungeons)
---
It's literally impossible as you describe it
---
Thank you, that explains a lot... it looks like I will have to stick to full run pugs, where they appear to prefer the above mentioned composition. Jed/Rend runs - at least on my server - seem to be very impatient, severely undermanned (I guess to avoid looting competition), and being the only healer really unenjoyable.
---
That's kind of obnoxious.
---
You mean that one night a week you clear ONY/MC and then have to find stuff to do?
---
I rolled rogue because druids don't really use melee weapons. I could heal on the druid, but I'm literally just standing around in the meantime because I have no wand, and staff bashing puts me in melee range. So I specced as a tank and keep it as my tank alt.
---
Rogue is pretty sweet tho. Just dishing out some nasty bursts, having fiery weapons, stealth, pickpocketing, varies CCs, ability to disappear from a battle and not die. I liked stealth on the druid alot, and I already have a tank alt so I figured there was no point in making a warrior.
---
What's funny is this lag is probably the result of a network/software architecture they invested millions into creating. Remember we're on the retail client and backend now along with all the changes that brought.
---
It might be now... notice I posted this 3 hours before you? And he posted basically when there was 5 comments? Think before you comment ffs
---
It's not like the threat is 100 pct figured out on Onyxia big man, fite club literally just created a channel solely dedicated to the fight to theorise about GUID affecting it etc.
---
You rolled a mage, deal with it.
---
You will hit a point where you only need to really log for raids and you'll favor staying logged out with world buffs, but it's definitely not once you hit 60.
---
It took me about ~6 days to hit 60, and I probably spent another 5-7 days getting preraid BiS, epic mount, 2x 300 professions, and enough gold farmed up to buy enchants and consumables.
---
I remember being in your position, racing to 60 so I could just raid and play less, but I actually ended up playing a lot more for a while lol.
---
Devilsaur is expensive but I still think it’s one of the easier pre raid BIS items. I think it went for max 300 on my server but it’s usually well below that. It’s essentially a passive set.
---
I don't know about this man, I play on the server in Deadbeat Dads and we've been dominating the horde for the past couple weeks. It's definitely still hard doing random things out in the world but it's not insanely bad
---
and .2% less chance to be dodged
---
Obviously jealous of you playing with another cat... Duuuh
---
Let me tell you a story. The other day I did a lbrs with a 58 warrior first time tank, a resto druid, a warlock, another guy, and me a rogue. At some point someone died and the druid blew his brez. Then 10 minutes later 2 people die, so they run back to the instance and and the warlock summons them back to us. Then 2 pulls before the last boss the other guy dies. The lock says that he's out of shards and can't summon and the brez is still down. So we go find a 3 pull we skipped so that he can make a shard and summon the other guy. We kill it, and as we're running back to the last bosses room to summon the lock falls off the bridge and dies. So we wait for both the other guy and the lock to run back. 
---
This was the funniest fucking thing I've seen in a while, and it would not have been possible without a resto druid healer.
---
If it's a drop quest, it just means I would have to spend double the time in that area getting 8 raptor hearts for myself and you.
---
Also rare drops cause I'm a greedy fuck.
---
The pacing is not necessarily irrelevant especially when considering the massive time investment it takes to get to 60. And I'm aware they were adding to the game as they made more content.
---
I'm worried they will rush pacing to the point it infringes on raid content, not that adding BGs early is bad. My assumption is, if they add honor then they will add BGs following, and if they add BGs they will be forced to accelerate BWL... which is bad. *Unless* they take the lost time and add it to AQ. I don't want to see a Classic lifespan less than 26 months.
---
False, I talk to 2-3 people a day who were r14 back in vanilla.
---
Dont really know what the quest is about but good job man! Glad you are happy and yes, reward for your efforts is verry nice! :)
---
if you have 305 skill then you only need 6% hit not 8
---
Okay but that begs the question: Why the fuck spend all your free time in azeroth??
---
Activly sabotaging a member of your own faction falls under griefing and is bannable just so you know.
---
MD bros &amp; Mazda bros???
---
Start tanking it in berserk stance with a two-hander 😂
---
Find yourself a girl that will get you pizza pockets. 
---
Now find a girl that won't steal your pizza pockets.
---
It's because they run cloud servers for "load balancing."  Game like this cannot communicate with that many players across all that with low latency.  That's why retail is all sharded and phased - less load, less bandwidth = money saved.
---
Over/under for this guy too anyone?
---
Balancing wow with adult life is a fun challenge. Fighting the urge to play more whenever I see someone with gear I want to have lol. But having way more fun playing limited amounts with no strict rules for exp gain.
---
&gt;/dump IsQuestFlaggedCompleted(questID)
---
OMG.. thanks for this! I typed it in and it said dragon menance was completed..  same with the jailbreak quest.. it seems i'm on the crumbled note quest!
---
Phase two will be a mess. World pvp/world bosses, yeah right. The amount of lag already is disgusting and there is no way they can handle the load.
---
So awesome! Myself and 6 others have been planning a LAN party first to 20 or whoever gets furthest in 8 hours, we've been planning and talking rules for weeks and this weekend is the party. Super excited!
---
Due to the reward system and the psychological effect of not break neck sprinting through the entire thing? With that logic, Classic could exist in a 1 year life cycle... which would be boring.
---
&gt; stoneform, fearward, escape artist and perception
---
In general, the alliance options are either burdened by drawbacks, or their viability is very niche.
---
stoneform's useful as damage reduction, but only turns fights around if you can dispel blind or d.plague with it, and those classes still have other options to fall back upon. FW + SF is strong as hell, but it's on a specific class-race combo that most people would avoid if it weren't for optimization.
---
Escape artist is good *if* you're a gnome rogue, as other gnome classes either don't care as much about being rooted, or don't have tools to close distance even if they had the CC break. On top of this, it has a cast time for some reason, making it even easier to reapply the effect you're trying to escape from.
---
Despite perception's reported strength, the classic server tickrate is such that they're close enough to CS me by the time they get revealed anyways. Most guides generally describe it as only being impactful in rogue v rogue duels anyways.
---
Conversely, WotF breaks the only forms of CC that priests, Warlocks, and Warriors have, and has a lower cooldown than perception. Blood fury's a major dps increase for melee classes on a 2m CD, and hardiness is renowned as the most insanely powerful pvp trait in the game. Berserking's one of the only effects that reduces cast times, and while warstomp's as awkward as escape artist, it's hard to discount the value of an aoe stun in pvp.
---
And this is absent of the pvp value of horde priest racials: ToW and HoW mitigate melee classes that are otherwise major threats to priests, D.plague can be removed by 2 classes + dwarves but is immensely powerful, and ToW/shadowguard can cheaply apply shadow weaving and blackout procs.

It’s low hanging fruit in Reddit comments that generates upvotes.

"It's a pvp server"
---
Your raids take more than 2 hours over the course of multiple days? Feels real bad.
---
Yeah I guess that makes sense. I've got a full time job and a full time kid so I only play for 1-2 hours a night after everything's done for the day.
---
I had a similar thing while farming Omokk, I feared an ogre into the tunnel and a cockroach ran the opposite way and pulled another ogre. It's pretty easy to reset them but still a weird interaction.

I just started playing yesterday. RIP me

I really don't like kitty. I do enjoy druid overall tho, mained one for a couple expacs. Been tempted to level one or not.
---
Back in Vanilla, people shared accounts with trusted friends to grind R14.  Little gangs formed to help a specific person reach R14 each week.  If you were not in the gang, you had little to no chance of making R13, let alone R14.    
---
OP is correct, it is not easy and it is a shitty grind!   Dream on, but have realistic expectations.
---
Wait, you can do this?
---
You are probably on the point where you have to find the note in BRD. You may have done dragonkin menace without realizing it or while in a group and other people were doing it.
---
I disagee that you apply the min max mentality to this, buffing caster dps should make up for my loss of arms 2h 30 compared to 2h fury's 80
---
Thanks, just downloaded it
---
And people are excited for Phase 2 lol.
---
Shits gonna be unplayable.
---
I have no doubt in my mind that classic+ will never happen. Still, it's nice to dream.
---
Can't spell Mazda without MD. But yeah, I drive one haha. I was just at the Catonsville location a couple months ago for some recall.
---
It's just a game man
---
LH, gates of aq.. there was 15k online and most of them all in Silithus.  Only had a few hiccups at the start.  It was the most fun I had playing wow since vanilla.
---
You really wanna sound smart? Throwing terminology, again, proves nothing pal. You don't have any in game experience using the ad on, refuse to look up info, and wanna just argue lmao. I'm done here
---
Sorry, wasn't flair so it was down for some minutes, its here now
---
meanwhile, I picked up the Improved Soul Drain talent for grinding, and had to make a macro to delete any soul shard that isn't in my soul bag. I sometimes have over 30 soul shards vanish from my inventory at once.
---
The mage shielded himself, which generates threat.
---
My first TWO battlegrounds I got tricked by this. I did it the first time and looked away and thought I maybe did something wrong that made me leave. The SECOND time I typed it in a realized what an idiot i was.
---
I just took a look and that site is better than most. Many sites ignore green items that are better than the blues some lists have (Deep River Cloak is ignored for some reason pretty consistently) as an easy example. Or pretend that Agility enchants exist already.
---
My comment was aimed towards dualwielders. But on the subject of BRE, bosses in classic have lower armor than on private servers so you might be overcapping armor penetration with BRE proc, making it kinda lack-luster compared to private servers.
---
It's not super consistent but they tend to go the opposite of the direction they are facing. So like op said put them (enamy) between you and the mob/guard you want the to run too.
---
We’re just pointing out the red flags man
---
A priest's heal is never late.  It goes off exactly when they want it to.
---
That's why I've missed yellow hits under 8% hit right? Also most of a rogues damage comes from slice and dice white hits and you need as much hit as you can to up that dmg. I've noticed dmg gains stacking as much hit as possible compared to 6% plus stacking AP and crit
---
other guy above recommended the command
---
/dump IsQuestFlaggedCompleted(questID)
---
and it seems i am indeed on the crumbled note! Yay!
---
Such as? Every class has leveling specs that are also viable dungeon specs.
---
I feel you, friend. 32 yrs old here, family (wife, 6 yr old, 8 month old). Our guild did our first MC 2 weeks ago and struggled to get even 15 guildies into a run. We ran for 4 hours and still only went 5/10 bosses. Last week with a PUG went smoother, albeit I’m sure from people getting more geared each week.
---
To top it off, I’m a holy spec Priest, so I can’t exactly efficiently solo farm anything. Working 7-330 M-F, not even any OT, donating plasma twice/week. I usually can’t play till we get the baby to sleep. Until then my wife and I are doing our part to get things cleaned up, dinner made, entertaining/changing/feeding the baby, and any other things that might come up on a day to day basis (laundry is always a big one, mowing/snow blowing is another).
---
You don’t even account for family events or activities or leisure/bonding time with the fam (going to a movie, dinner with friends or fam, helping out parents, any other random activity). By the time all is said and done, I can get a few hours in each night, and unless the baby sleeps a solid 1.5-2 hr nap on the weekends, then it’s usually the same there too. I will sometimes binge a 4 hour night raiding but it’s coupled with sleep deprivation and either not logging on the next day or playing with burning retinas until I go to bed at a more conservative time.
---
It literally is 100% figured out. Wing Buffet reduces threat by 50% every time it's successful (can be dodged/parried/miss). P2 and P3 transitions are full threat wipes. P2 "ends" when her landing animation completes, not as she's moving. P2 fireballs and deep breath targets/behavior are just random. That's it. Everything else works exactly the same as everywhere else in the game. Most of this was suspected by the end of Vanilla. All of it was confirmed by Blizzard in interviews, public talks at conferences, and blue posts throughout the years after.
---
except priests with wand specialization and spirit tap
---
yeah just found this out!
---
Contrary to what others have said, I personally find that as a Hunter I find groups fairly quickly. Granted its mainly for end game content that they are useful, for instance UBRS runs. They are needed to kite the last boss, it makes the fight 1000x easier. Those mechanics are also used in a few MC fights like Domo. Hunters kite a few of the elites while the group kills everyone else, then you FD and send them back. I'd say hunters have a fair place when it comes to usefulness in a group, as long as you can use your abilities correctly.
---
Many command line tools disregard a command with unexpected or invalid options/arguments to safeguard against misspelling or pranks like above. WoW console does not seem to have that safeguard and only checks the validity of options it *expects to have*. Gquit doesn't expect anything, so it doesn't check anything.
---
This
---
Damn feral Druids below shadow priests? Is that like including when Ferals are tanking or are some lower end cat dps holding the averages down?
---
There is no evidence so support this whatsoever. Batching is commonly used in all types of software to improve performance, because modern computers (as a rule) are much faster when performing repetitive computations with limited scope.
---
There are no mistakes, just happy accidents
---
It's constant, and the title is correct.
---
Well them getting a reaction out of you obviously worked for you to post a huge wall of text out of something that probably happened less than 3 times to you in your entire leveling experience. 
---
The truth? Mages are mostly all assholes. Not all of them, I've met some great ones. But at the same time, so many of them are entitled dickheads that's why people choose to do this to them. Not saying that you are one, but mage is definitely the easiest to play in almost all senses, and while yes certain things may be hard to master, they can literally do it all easier than any other class. What does this lead to? An over abundance of people wanting things now, fast, and easy, causing the most bottom barrel of players to roll mage.   
---
TL;DR: You're a mage, the most popular class, the most disliked class, deal with it.
---
Yes, tailoring was a mistake. No, you would not have been better off with leatherworking.
---
Bluntly, everything you need from tailoring or leatherworking as a druid is BoE. Therefore, you need to know tailors and leatherworkers - and they are both easy to find - and have a big pile of mats. Note that raw cloth sells for less than bolts, because cloth is used for First Aid and reputation handins ...
---
So, add a gathering profession to enchanting. Check the price of valuable skins, herbs and ores before deciding between herb and mining (briefly, there is very little leather gear worth wearing, so there is very little demand for leather. And a lot of skinners, because a lot of people paired skinning with herb or mining).
---
You don’t say!
---
Was he not level 60 or something?
---
Yes, but I don’t think coffers are very efficient at all. There are probably a lot of other activities that would net you more GpH.
---
That being said coffers have a benefit of being a relatively quick boost of gold with very little effort and generally very little competition.
---
I can go do my laundry or step out of the house and I’ll still be in stealth in the dungeon and go finish my run.
---
Is that like 1 quest a day thing?
---
Not really necessary unless you want to hardcore min max
---
For all the uninformed naysayers in this thread, 
---
Dire bear form and moonkin form get the same armor bonus.
---
This also seems to be the case for Incendius-Ally. Obviously anecdotal but I've seen a lot of guilds/raids specifically looking for warlocks.
---
50+ sucked, I think I was all out of quests by 57 or so. Really had to scrape the bottom of the barrel, running around from zone to zone just to do a single quest
---
I have this same problem.  My cat loves to rub it’s head on the esc key so you can see this can cause problems.
---
Well obviously some things have been slowing you down lol
---
Yep. I think that intensified my dislike for them as well. Being forced into an absolute shit gamemode to be able to compete in pvp that could actually be fun was horseshit.
---
Yeah, But what about the world bosses?
---
I wish. They are 50 silver per fish on my server
---
Ah so easy to dismiss actual data as well. I accounted for the mages being more prevalent lmao. This is fucking laughable. Let me know when top 10 guilds run more than 3 hunters. Theres a reason they don't.  I did nothing other than take your phrasing and turned it against you. Hunters are trash and always will be.
---
Spell queuing and mobs that hit from 15 yards away, not important
---
If you've done the [BRD escort](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=4322/jail-break), you should've done the [SW escort](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=6402/stormwind-rendezvous) next, but that quest is often bugged, so maybe it failed and you deleted it from your log (or you're still on it and haven't noticed). 
---
If you think that's the case, you can try dropping/restarting it from the NPC ([Squire Rowe](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=17804/squire-rowe)) right at SW entrance, he'll summon Windsor and you'll be able to talk to him and restart the whole [SW event](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=6403/the-great-masquerade).
---
If not, maybe you have to kill mobs in BRD until you find [A Crumpled Up Note](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=4264/a-crumpled-up-note).
---
~~Worst case scenario, try paging a GM and politely asking them to point you in the right direction. Considering how buggy the SW escort is and how important Onyxia attunement is, they should help you, hopefully.~~
---
\* Or use [this tip](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dsm0zq/ony_attunement_cant_get_dragonkin_menace/f6q8grq/) to figure out which quest you've completed or not completed.
---
I got tricked into this very early on in vanilla, after like a 2 hour queue in what was probably one of my first ever BGs I got in and immediately kicked myself out cuz someone said this in chat. I was so pissed at myself.
---
I'd rather be a tide pod eating zoomer than a boomer anyway. But luckily I'm neither.
---
Doing each sm in order always fills me with satisfaction, especially with the awesome storyline
---
You definitely are scared of stuns. Also wotf doesn't do anything to poly
---
Ok, and the idea is you use the same mh whether SnB or DW so that you can just do one swap?
---
WOW's history with pvp has been riddled with absolute shit-tier decision making. They need a gear normalized pvp mode where it all comes down to spec and skill. Right now gear &gt; skill unless you're running a few specs.
---
Yeah I don't buy this for a second. I'm on stalagg and it's terrible. PvP between raid groups in BRM is garbage and even with an extra layer org is a fucking slideshow/queue time on any action. They desperately need to improve the servers.
---
People were excited for launch. It was expected to have severe queue times and massively populated starter zones. It did. Here we are nonetheless.
---
What we need is Blizzard to rip off the fallout boardgame as it works well for questing and combat. I would buy that without hesitation
---
Sick tip, I didn't know you could use a command to verify the status of a quest!
---
but why is the raid bothering to bring someone like you who wont respec for the purpose of doing significant more raid dps? Why not just slap that on a ret paladin who can at least bring some extra buffs?
---
It’s not bad, but anything that lists core Marksman rifle is clearly made by somebody who just adds stats up &amp; not anyone whose played a hunter. 
---
If you’re looking for the best DPS weapon, you want the Carapace Spine Xbox in strat. You won’t clip Your aimed shots with that and it’s top end damage for Aimed / multi is higher. despite lower “dps” it’ll actually result in much higher average damage per second over a boss fight and be essentially your BIS item til Rhok. 
---
(Yes, blastershot is SLIGHTLY better, but let ur other dpsers have it)
---
You train it at level 60, did you check your spell book to be sure you didn’t already learn it by accident
---
r/sounding
---
I am 55 and have tanked everything up to BRD (only a few arena runs under my belt so far). My biggest recommendation is not in rotation, but to get a 1 hander with speed 2.0 or less (2.2 is highest I will use if it’s big dps bump). Faster weap speed will provide a more steady stream of holy damage (threat) that will allow you to better establish control, and also start tab auto attacking other mobs once your skull target is down to 50% to bolster the aoe threat from your conc/ret aura. Use sharpening stones as well while tanking, every bit helps.
---
For leveling spec, you will go 11 holy of course for conc. I am 5/5 str, 5/5 imp SoR, 1 conc. From here I like deep ret with focus on tank attributes. My goal was to be a tank first with ability to go 2h and quest effectively. So I went 5/5 benediction, 2/2 imp judgement, 3/5 parry, 2/2 pursuit of justice, 5/5 conviction, 2/2 imp ret aura, 2 more to parry, 3/3 vindication and had 1 floater which I put towards eye for an eye (thinking threat) but probably would have been better spent on Sanctity/SoC. I skipped these because redundant with SoR and imp ret aura. After vengeance I am finally into Prot with redoubt etc but it’s probably time for me to make the switch to sanctity at least. I wanted to share this build though because I do think it provides great middle ground between dungeon tanking and 2H questing without respecing, especially if you are like me and do not plan on healing until I want to step into a raid.
---
Finally to answer your actual question. Open 98% of elite pulls with judging seal of righteousness on your skull marked target. Immediately refresh SoR and then drop the highest level conc you have available. Stay on skull for 2-3 swings, and use that time to mark an X target. If skull is above 50%, judgement skull one more time, refresh SoR, and switch focus of your autos onto X. Drop a lower rank conc if 3 mobs remain. Rinse and repeat this basic cycle... BUT remember that you are a paladin and you have a Swiss Army knife of tools. The general strat will suffice for vast majority of pulls, but to get the most out of your Tankadin, you will need to know when to deviate and use the other tools at your disposal.. here are some keys that come to mind...
---
1. Have a few pieces of gear in your bags with HIGH spirit. Swap them on after combat ends if you expect to need a drink. It will expedite the process. Try to always bring 2 stacks of best water available into a dungeon, even if a mage is coming (things happen)
---
2. Seal of Light and Seal of Wisdom are both fantastic tools depending on team comp. Judge light often on bosses or big mobs that deal splash damage when you have 3+ melee in party. Judge Wisdom on a boss or difficult mob when you expect to use multiple max level concs or can’t afford to sacrifice threat via downranking SoR. In either case, you still want to open with judging righteousness to establish threat.
---
3. Seal of the crusader is a strong tool early on but I find it’s not worth the judgement Cooldown. While leveling, I use Crusader more often in periods where I got a new rank of Blessing of Wisdom/Seal of Wisdom, or had less mana issues thanks to strong gear.
---
4. You have no taunt and close minded people think this means you can’t possibly be a good tank. While it is certainly a limitation, it’s not a deal breaker. Use Blessing of Protection on your healer (dps sometimes) when things get hairy. It will cause a temporary aggro dump during which you HAVE to pump out as much holy dmg on the target ASAP. After BoP expires, threat returns to the BoP target, so the goal is to overtake their threat during this window. 
---
5. Don’t be afraid to bubble yourself in the most dire of situations. This works best when you have a Warrior dps standing there to take a few punches. The key though is to bubble only for 1-2 seconds, enough time for you to catch a meaningful heal back to 40%+. You will have to right click your bubble buff to disable and then be ready to stun any mob on your healer/squishies and hopefully stabilize the situation.

6. Lay on Hands.. typically best used on yourself if you don’t have a dps Warrior to grab threat for a moment or if bubble is down and you only have a prayer left. To use it wisely and decisively, you need to Recognize what is causing you to be going down in the first place.. do you have all the aggro and are just getting melted, or is there a mob on your healer interrupting casting, or is your healer CC’d and can you cleanse? Being aware of the situation will help you get the best of this powerful ability, and not squander it.
---
7. Last one since I just reminded myself above. CLEANSE! Very very powerful tool. You can eliminate all sorts of poisons, diseases and pesky magical debuffs. Prioritize cleansing yourself and cleansing the healer. You can really make a difference in your healers life by cleansing them if they are turned into a toad or something (ZF).

I know this was a lot more thank you asked for but I am very passionate about paladin tanking (within 5 mans before the haters strike me down!). Aoe threat is very strong and fun. Mana is far and away my biggest complaint. I know my build is not cookie cutter but I do believe it provides significant dps increases for questing or even dungeoning as a dps, while also providing great threat and moderate mitigation (while leveling!). I do intend to make the transition to the traditional deep Prot for Blessing if Sanctuary at least but have not yet had the heart to give up Vengeance. I would love to hear if any other pallys out there have used a similar approach to leveling as a Tankadin.

Agreed. Reaper of Souls made the game decent again by removing the AH.
---
Please do link these places where they confirmed how the threat mechanics work. Seeing as it's confirmed in a lot of places according to you, I'd love to see these confirmations. Can't wait for my month of theorycrafting, checking logs, making a seperate channel in Fight Club DEVOTED to Onyxia to be proven wrong by some random on reddit!
---
"  know people make it work, and I'd be interested to hear their counterpoints on the topic. " i think youre in the wrong sub mate
---
Hit is most important to get that yellow hit cap, but it is still useful after that, though to a lesser degree. If you're more curious you should look up stat equivalencies. They so a decent job of converting extra hit % increasing your dps as much as x attack power would.
---
How is anything infringing on raid content?  What does that even mean?
---
If anything, adding BGs earlier than planned makes it easier to justify sticking to their original schedule.
---
you dont want to use tanking gear in PvP, raid plate DPS gear is usually very good for pvp tho!, you simply value stamina a lot in pvp along with STR, Crit and Agi (as long as you have 6 or 9% hit too)
---
unoriginal and boring... cant wait to hear kids saying out loud in public and i get to throw up from cringing.
---
Oh nice I put a gamble and posted it at that
---
Will give it a try and do some variations. Would be nice to have sone kind of control over it
---
None of that is true.
---
Literally none of that is true.
---
P2 Fireballs are aimed at the highest threat target on her list. 
---
Threat reduction from fireballs is mitigated by stacking based on GUID. If two people are stacked, the lower (newer) GUID person is the person who gets the threat reduction. This has been tested and is the best working theory we have now.
---
There's no threat wipe in P2 or P3.

people are already leveling 2nd or 3rd characters to lvl 60 while I haven't even reached 30...
---
*cries in warrior*
---
Sure.... :)
---
that was really my questions, is that proc worth giving up 28 AP? I feel like the 28 AP is a better choice since ill use blood thirst way more than my thrash will proc. BUT a previous comment was about getting just bigger crits on whirlwind and overpower which makes sense my DPS would be higher with thrash it sounds like. Even though I think my base auto attack dps will be higher not using thrash.
---
You've leveled 3 60s.
---
Time doesn't matter to you brotha
---
Yeah this is a legit raid tanking, raid healing and PvP spec. You just can’t dps that good.
---
Got it for 20 bucks before it was "the shroud mouse"
---
P3 Transition is absolutely not a full threat wipe.
---
It's 20 hours a day for 11 weeks
---
Your insignia will remove fear but not stuns so yes your definately scared of stuns.
---
Yea that's what I was thinking, the truth is that everyone is a warrior/mage/rogue it seems. Rogues and warriors competing for weapons is huge, as a hunter it seems like their would be way less competition. It's funny because it seems like it's the opposite of when I originally played, I see way less hunters than I did back in classic as it seems the more "meta" classes have skyrocketed in popularity this time around now that everyone is more min/max conscious. Not to say I don't see a lot of hunters still, but they don't seem like the vastly most popular class these days.
---
I am 60 lol and I just checked its not there
---
5% chance in statistics means getting boned every once in a while.
---
Right, lets farm MC for 8 months before we see BWL, lets have no BGs for several months, because less content surely means the game is more fun, right? There is no way players will get tired of it faster if there isn't anything "new" to do, right. This is some backwards thinking.
---
So "ITT: the truth"?
---
It's self regulating and so will never be like it was in vanilla.  Gems will always sell below vendor value for as long as the game remains the same as it was in 2006.  The playerbase know all farm locations.
---
I pay healers to spam BRD Arena with me since they dont get any gear there. Selling services is decent income for a healer. I typically pay 3g per run and they get all drops. The healer typically makes 25-30g in the 35 minutes it takes until we get locked out.
---
It's not even his video....
---
Min max refers to the minimum a spell will hit for and the max it can go. People use the term loosely to describe playstyle focused on getting the highest damage/healing possible, at the risk of losing some quality of life  (ie priests spamming greater heal instead of dispelling another party member, or a fury warrior wearing leather gear over plate because it will produce more damage but less survivability) it's not a bad thing to be focused on min maxing, but gotta know when to concern yourself about purely high numbers or worrying about other aspects of the game
---
I play on Heartseeker now. Most of the refugees there are fairly considerate to the low pop of Horde. I was about to quit Classic completely due to all the excessive griefing before I switched. I would consider it if I were you ESPECIALLY with HKs coming out...
---
fun fact grizzly was on nostalrius and would bot and exploit the game and their GM got banned
---
Nice dude did you just start learning about networks and wanted to share with the class?
---
I'm liking my odds placed on you not having gotten any.
---
Ok good to know for later on.
---
Not the point
---
Bloodfury is meaningless it’s a measly 25% on base ap.

Hardiness on the other hand is &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wotf
---
Elvui, it's kinda dogshit but I'm used to it now
---
It's ok. I was on Mankrik (pve) before and the community was so much better on it. I've noticed on Incendius (pvp) I'm seeing a lot responses to people asking for help like "your mom gave me mage water last night" or on the Orgrimmar AH /yell spamming "free blowjobs" and shit like that. It doesn't offend me, but it's a serious dip in quality from Mankrik. As for pvp, alliance seems like serious push overs so I almost always have to initiate, and often my horde counterparts will watch me get stomped.
---
Overall, my pve server was better, but I feel that pvp has the *potential* to be better. It just isn't.
---
Ah, so now you're just low effort trolling as you have proven to just be an enormous fool. You have no actual data, you made up some [statistically incorrect nonsense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misuse_of_statistics) on the spot and ignored the actual significant data, which was provided by the number 1 wowlogsite in the world.
---
I'll just post[ the actual data again](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/statistics/1000#metric=dps&amp;dataset=50&amp;class=DPS), just to rub it in your face. It's beautiful how you are failing hard at trying to deny simple facts. It's even more beautiful how mages get outclassed and outdpsed by hunters as is statistically proven and represented by the best guilds in the world. Next to that, mage takes zero skill to play, while hunter is infinitely harder.
---
And I'm saying this as a mage who actually gets top parses in a top guild on my server, that's the most hilarious part. You're delusional.
---
Umm any AOE class is just using the abilities in the game, as intended. One person AOE farming isn't griefing in any way, or Blizzard would have dealt with this *problem* along time ago lol However, the kind of activity he is describing is considered griefing and has seen lots of people banned.
---
GM / MT of &lt; Filthy Casuals &gt; on Whitemane - Just for what little credibility that gives and where my experience comes from. 
---
Fury / Prot is AWESOME if you're looking to push your raid. But thats literally the only reason to run it. 
---
Dungeons - Going deep prot, or fury / arms (normal dps spec) is much more viable. With deep prot you have every tool that you need to tank any dungeon and that is all that you will do. With Fury / Arms, you still have all your tools to tank (Tactical mastery being number 1) and the only thing you give up is the 15% threat which is kind of helpful in dungeons but not really needed. 
---
If youre just dungeon spamming... DO NOT go fury prot. You dont have tactical mastery and its just more of a pain than helpful. 
---
Raids - Your MT and OT can go fury prot if you want to push limits and do damage. As fury prot on some boss fights I'm pulling more DPS than a lot of other people. You don't lose any mitigation talents as fury prot and you have more damage capabilities. This is extremely good for your main OT since theyll be DPSing on certain bosses. so they won't lose a lot of DPS. IMO thats the MAIN person in raid that should be fury prot.
---
Common Misconceptions of Fury/Prot - 
---
\- You always have to Dual wield. This is just not true. If youre taking a lot of damage you should be throwing on a shield. You need to have macros that swap between sword / shield and dual wield so you're ready for any situation. Don't blame healers when you die while you're DWing. Throw on a shield and take less damage.
---
\- Its the go to spec at 60. Not at all, this is really only good for your Main and Off tanks for raiding purposes only. And only if you're trying to clear faster as a whole raid. If youre just worried about killing bosses stay deep prot as MT. 
---
\- Its better to tank with. No, this is literally just for raiding and I HATE being fury prot when dungeon grinding. No tactical mastery for stance dancing charge is extremely painful. You're even more rage starved. 
---
If you have any questions that you think I could answer I'm more than happy to help.
---
I used to be the GM of a top ranked guild a while back. I'd definitely step out of a date for a sec to jump on Discord and handle business. Or if they knew I was a gamer I'd be upfront ahead of time. "We can definitely grab dinner, but I have to talk to these people at this time for 15 minutes" Most guys tended to be understanding. 
---
Had a ton of international members, so finding that ideal time was tough and needed consistency.
---
Sulfuras?
---
Depends on the weed. Was it fire? Or garbage?
---
Yeah, they're still capped by the resources of the physical machine that's running them.
---
The idea with a container-based architecture is to design your system so that higher load can be compensated by automatically firing up more containers (horizontal scaling) - not by expanding existing containers (vertical scaling).
---
If their system is designed so that one container is responsible for a single given zone, this tech won't help them at all (which is the case right now, I guess). In Retail, however, this probably works very well, as you can just shard the zone and let multiple containers deal with a fraction of the total players in the zone.
---
They need to find a way to make one zone being able to be handled by multiple containers at once. This way, when more players interact within a zone, more containers can be added to handle the increased load. Horizontal scaleability is basically uncapped, as you can always just use additional machines. Vertical scaleability requires more powerful machines, which will always cap at what the current hardware is capable of.
---
So yeah, the existence of containers doesn't really change your point; they basically do what VMs do but better :)

Personally I wouldn’t run the 30/21 hotw spec without at least 3/5 feral instinct and bear primal rage. But I would highly recommend 5/5 feral instinct with that spec. 
---
With that in mind tanking is not a meme. But if you skimp on the feral instinct then yeah.
---
Rogues live or die by their friends lists - or, specifically by being on the friends lists of healers and tanks.
---
Generally, healers and tanks don't care about big DPS numbers. They care about the run being smooth and therefore fast. The big advantage of rogues over furry warriors is you actually have utility - you can interrupt enemy casters, sap things and so on.
---
Therefore, if you're in Scarlet Monastry or wherever, tell the tank that you'll clean up runners. Keep an eye on anything breaking for the healer, and do what you need to do against it (believe me, the healer will notice).
---
Outside, you absolutely want to be increasing the number of warriors and druids who know you and like you. If you see a warrior trying to solo things, ask if you can help. Hang out with them.
---
Yeah, it cripples your XP per hour for a little bit. But it puts another name on your friends list to whom you can say 'Hi. Ive got a healer and a shammy, and we're looking at running Sunken Temple. Interested ?'
---
BTW, hunters have exactly the same issue, as they do okay DPS but can't heal and they arent a mage ...
---
Is the patchwerk one fake? Why does he do the death line before playing the kill player line?
---
Big jealous!
---
That does sound fun, plus it's faster for both of you
---
Haha don't worry man, I get what you're saying. First thing I noticed was 'Barista' as well. Combined with the information provided.. yikes. :)

Pet snake u mean

im not a neet, shower more than once every harvest moon, and own deodorant so place your bet if you want
---
Nothing has *yet*. If you were listening I outlined that for you. No, it doesn't as the PvP gear is as powerful in many instances as BWL gear. It's the same sort of issue as releasing DM so early, it along with other factors helped to further trivialize MC for many players.
---
The raid tiers should last no less than 6 months, IMO, with the initial MC seeing 7 or 8 as people would enjoy the opportunity to level and not feel like they "missed" content. Those of us who are already 60 and have two characters in MC are a minority Blizzard shouldn't cater to. Let the people level at a pace that makes sense and have time to see some MC or intro BWL.
---
I feel they are might fall into a breakaway where they will shorten the windows of all raid content and we will see a sub 26 month Classic experience (which was already too short).
---
any one else having issues updating classic? Keeps saying initializing...
---
Literally haven't had a patch problem with it since release.
---
It still depends on the span of time you put in for that level 60 and 4X(forgot the exact level). The fastest to 60 is 3 days 7 hours. Phase 2 is in 6 days. Even the record holder would have to play 13hrs a day to get to 60 in time for phase 2, so those saying he has time are crazy.
---
You may also have a different definition of casual. I only get to play about 12hrs a week. Even being efficient it’d take me a month to get to 60. It’s all really relative.
---
RIP
---
I mean people shouldn't hardcore corpse camp holy priests or I wouldn't have to come up with unconventional tactics to kill them
---
It's funny how you mention Mark Kern when he is the guy who said that he had to get rid of half the team after vanilla launched to massive success. Those people were going to leave whether they wanted to or not.

Both have up and downs, work around them or don't.
---
Just a tiny nitpick, but even with Carapace you will still clip a bit. 3.5s weapon speed is the minimum for no clipping, which unfortunately doesnt exist. But you're right about it being by far the best option (assuming you dont need hit from Blackcrow) until Rhok.
---
Maybe but trying to get .5 sets before AQ changes the order in which content is released a bit. Youre promoting #somechanges and that just wont happen with blizzard.
---
Look at her arm. ROFL back at ya
---
maybe they bother because I show up on time and know the tactics? srsly, just because the game is about min maxing for you it doesn't make it about min maxing by default for every existing raiding guild -.-
---
Ok then smart ass, show me **any** addon that can do this using the provided API. I'll wait. You can't, because it doesn't exist.
---
Most servers seem to have their own sub and many have an organized discord! I’d start there
---
lol this is not correct. Many issues but the most obvious one is that P2 fireballs are NOT random.
---
You're in the level range for Uldaman and ZF. Not sure if there's good priest gear in there though
---
Ya the only time I really hamstring is in PvP. And that pretty much consists of spamming charge or intercept, followed by spamming hamstring until you connect with one to spot from being kited
---
Sure. :)
---
I've always been a huge UD guy, dont rp or anything like that, but following the storylines through all the zone specially ud related I just can't get enough of, so this new xpac with sylvanas is right up my alley lol
---
As for loot competition, it's about the same as other classes I'd say, a lot of dps classes need the same gear. And especially ranged weapons, I've lost so many rolls against warriors and rogues that rolled need because it has 1% hit. But once you get Rhok'Delar, you're all set lol
---
Dreamweave set is a really good start.
---
There's two things warriors "can" do to improve their base gameplay at the expense of enjoying the game at all. Hamstring kiting and ability queuing/cancelling to reduce required hitcap.
---
Both are a pain in the ass. Both don't really make warriors less painful to level.
---
Don't bother with them, just play. It'll be painful leveling no matter what you do. Endgame you will facetank everything so kiting isn't needed from hamstring, and you will have enough hit that ability queuing isn't needed.
---
And boss fights.  They are so fast in mc
---
Has it been confirmed if honor kills earned this week will count as honor next week at reset when the ranking system drops? As I recall when the system originally came out in vanilla this was the case so many people were able to get their corporal trinkets right away

COOCOO IS THAT YOU I NEED  U TO SET UP NEW DISCORD BOT FOR ME OFC
---
If it’s not trainable are a main city trainer and you don’t have it in your spell book and you are level 60 you need to submit a ticket, because there is no prerequisite for it except level 60
---
Not 11, more like 3-4
---
The first 11 ranks/weeks you can take very casually
---
I was working full time and still made rank 11 on my actual alt without even giving up my raid time on my main
---
It's only after that where you really have to ask yourself if you can commit...
---
Your comment history is more toxic than lake karachay :-)
---
still working on getting to 40 for my first mount, currently 34..
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=25890/greater-blessing-of-light
---
Looks like the trainer.
---
You got a source for that half threat reduction? Because if that was the case I would be losing aggro every wing buffet to dps or offtank. I'm pretty sure it just reduces your threat by a few thousand.
---
Edit: Guides say 25% threat reduction which sounds a lot more accurate than 50% from my experience. (I solo tank p1 every time)
---
If your 60 grab the wolf from LBRS they have a fast attack speed raid buff and bite rank 8 I'm pretty sure.
---
Yeah, well, you know, that's just like, your opinion man.
---
Tough shit then. What do you want us to do about it? Listen to you whine? I’m not a free therapist sorry.
---
I've lost two Emp runs right in front of boss when an add runs a solid 45 yards without crippling poison on it because everyone target switched off the skull to start ramping DPS on the new target. Both times the add pulled the boss, and with it, the entire room. Then we wipe. Then we realize there are respawns. Then people leave.
---
Use crippling poison for the love of god, at least on your OH.
---
Yeah logging in for 4 hours once every week is really a killer.
---
Two weeks ago I saved an ally warrior from getting killed by mobs only for him to heal up, call a friend over, and jump me and try to camp me. 
---
Tsk. 
---
Grabbed another rogue and we finished that fight. Hope they enjoyed the spirit rez.
---
That's perfect. I was worried about getting lost in scholo
---
I'm a mage and I say GTFO with your stupid logic. Am I an asshole? For your I am.
---
A good rogue provides absolutely amazing utility.
---
Runners just die, before they get to their friends. Enemy casters keep being interrupted. Skull dies fast, without the mobs next to them taking extra threat and thus getting distracted from cleave-addicted furry warriors.
---
Bad rogues just provide DPS.
---
I did it all at the same time. I've "only" sunk something like 14 days /played in the game iirc
---
Link to the fight club discord?
---
slideshow isn't server lag.
---
As a healer, you shouldn't worry about not bringing anything else...
---
As long as people aren't dying, that's all anyone cares about from you.
---
Made the entire video worth it for me. lol
---
When going outside a dungeon, every tank warrior is a dps warrior.
---
Northdale came out AFTER they fixed those problems.. Their previous servers had lots of problems.
---
Gotta remember to put that space first!
---
Get 5/5 feral instinct it’s much better for tanking than thick hide.
---
Edit: Also Blood frenzy over 3/3 natural shapeshifter is big oof for kitty dps. Natural shapeshifter is more value.
---
Why
---
Wouldn't he have a massive pull radius at such a low level...?
---
If you're using world buffs and itemize correctly (don't go over 6% hit, it's almost pointless, crit and attack power is far more valuable) your DPS should never be as low as 350-400. Maybe with poorly itemized prebis and No worldbuffs you'd be doing 350 DPS.
---
Make a lot of sense with what the other guy said. Thanks for the tip.
---
Am I delusional? My statistics were ripped off the best logging site in the world, from the top ten guilds. Nothing I said was false. It's hilarious you refuse to accept the fact you're fucking wrong. I also say this as a mage who is currently in the top twenty mages worldwide in a top ten worldwide guild and the #1 guild on my server. You're fucking laughable. I went through every top ten guild and counted their numbers for both mages and hunters and divided by number that made top fifteen. Pretty easy, you can do it yourself too! You're wrong, bud. Sorry to tell you :/
---
Tanking is a meme when it's done in a gimp feral/resto spec to save on respec costs because some mouth breathing streamer popularized it. I might as well take off half my gear to save on repair costs, sure it will hinder my party, but I'll save some gold.

If I'm running a dungeon with a bear druid, I want to run it with a feral druid.

I remember back in the day I got rank 14. People reported me and threatened me because I was suppose to wait inline behind others. Your high if you think I'm waiting weeks of play 12 hours a day.
---
Got rank 14 and people spat on me and hated me. Good ol PvP grind.
---
&gt;You don't want to be the dicks that ring the gong the day before the other guild is ready.
---
That reminds me of the rogue who didn't get to the gong in time on his server, so he transferred to a server that hadn't rang the gong yet, rang it, then transferred back.
---
If you have skinning a good strategy would be to find high populations of beasts that are several levels higher than your pet and grind. It would take awhile but it's probably safest if you dont have BM talents. You'll also get good grey drops and skinning from beasts.
---
Dungeon. I see hunters with broken tooth that isnt attacking a lot. They just passive it and collect xp.
---
Yep. Same as playboy existing to expand our diet of short fiction and automobile repair advice.

Never mind that undead rouge cover-up, we want to know more about that escort.

I made a facebook and tinder account solely to LFM for games but I got reported within a few hours for impersonation. The account got shut down before I could do anything lol.
---
Meh sometimes ill pretend to be noob to let other people enjoy "teaching" me the game, sometimes I learn new things.
---
Being a know it all isnt very fun after a while, even though I have 120s of every class on retail I still ask my friends questions about their classes just because I like to hear *them* explain it.
---
How would you space it out to make Classic retain replay value years down the line? Theres only so much content available and none of its fresh or new anymore lol
---
What a blatant lie. The cheeky bastards.
---
I'm about 99% sure on both:
---
* Logging out doesn't dismiss your pet automatically
---
* Starting on a flight path will refund your soul shard if you have bag space
---
Rng isnt really something you discuss lol. Its something you complain about lol
---
Isn't it literally the same item? But it just increases in ilvl and maybe the tooltip changes color?
---
That's what turned me off from retail. The item grind just isn't there. It's an "ilvl" grind.
---
We've already seen precedent for changes from vanilla and changes from the planned phases. I think it's silly to assume that won't continue in some capacity.
---
It’s not thrown away unless you delete/vendor the items. You can always sell them back for 1:1 money back. 
---
Plus, once the item gets released, those mats might raise in value. So you might profit off it.
---
If they can take the throne, it's definitely worth it. And right now, it's easier than ever to do that, because I think a lot of players feel like I do.
---
One thing that would help with outdated gear would be to maybe move the "updated date" text to the top instead of the bottom?
---
There's some truth in this. There's also some truth in the following: nobody should ever stop gaming because of a significant other or spouse.
---
I never said it wasn't the way they were designed, but let's not pretend that Classic is some sort of paradise of balanced classes.  
---
A mage AOE farming isn't griefing, sure. However, when you're preventing others from farming because of it, that's going to be frustrating to the other classes.  
---
When they went from killing 1 mob a minute to 1 mob every 15 minutes all because one single other person same level and relative gear power shows up, what do you expect them to do?
---
Honestly man. I wouldn't play if I was you.
---
If you have to ask  if the game is dying you are not interested in the game. Your just late on the hype train.
---
In what universe does ANYTHING sell below vendow vlaue my dude? Thats stupid as hell. Not only do you get less if you sell the item you also have to pay the auction house. Why would anyone ever put sth in the AH for less than vendor price? That is bullshit. (1 or 2 idiots on your sever that do this dont really count )
---
Why should it be like it was in vanilla? It's not like economy is bound to a patch or anyhting like that. 
---
Of course the playerbase knows all the farm locations. What is your point? If everyone farms the same stuff the price on the AH will plummet and less people will farm that stuff.
---
People think they are smart and have been hoarding free action potions since release. In P2 every AH on every server will be fkin flooded with that stuff.
---
Long story short: economy is dynamic and not connected to a patch or 2006 or anything. Should be obvious that the economy wont be the same as in 2006. And why should it be? The economy is supply/demand, nothing more. 
---
You still dont make any sense at all.

I would hope you would leave the dungeon after losing a Baron cape. Otherwise you're that weirdo that hangs out inside empty dungeons.

Most healthy relationships thrive when your hobbies have a few things that overlap but then many things that don't, this way you have things to share with one another, things to enjoy away from one another, and things to tell each other about. 
---
If all you ever do is the same things your partner does, it can make the relationship feel "dull"
---
While I fully agree with your sentiment, I strongly disagree with your premise . It’s clear to me that Blizzard does in fact care about these issues (not for altruistic reasons) , and also clear to me that they are aware of the prevailing opinions on message boards such as this . This can make a difference regardless of subscription losses , or lack there of .
---
&gt; but people will always take the easy route
---
Which is why the horde pop is higher on all the pvp servers
---
Chaingun is technically hitscan, but not in a way that matters past 20 feet.

Just going to emberseer is mega greedy, at least do jed too if you don't need rend, up to jed is easy 4 man with 1 mage
---
Congratulations, you've made the dumbest post of the day on this subreddit.  The problem in the OP is the server side lag due to the processing of variables and the flexible structure of their cloud-based server structure.  It has absolutely nothing to do with the client side app or connection.  Blizzard is (saving money) by not dedicating hardware to individual servers and instead running virtual servers that share load balancing and offer piss-poor dedicated resources.
---
It's lazy and cheap.
---
Orcs also get 25% stun resist
---
Lol mages complaining. Literally the most busted class and still bitch about everything
---
I'm having a blast leveling and doing all the quests, exploring. Buts its my first time playing wow so that might have something to do with it. I didn't know about ability queing. I'll still try to learn these but for now I think I'll enjoy playing warrior regularly.
---
I think the ease and lack of competition appeals to me. 
---
My usual gold farming spot is often contested, making it harder work to achieve gph.  Since some classes are more efficient than I am at that farming... sometimes it's pretty frustrating. 
---
I'm looking at this as an easy option if keys are cheap enough.
---
Though it might be an endgame ish dungeon BRD will always be my favourite dungeon in the game. I'll never forget my first full run taking like 5 hours on my male human paladin &lt;3
---
I really enjoyed Deadmines. Never really played Alliance in retail, so doing the quest chain that led to the dungeon felt really immersive.
---
Is it a dying game? Nothing has killed wow in 15 years and classic wow has cast increased subs by 2-3x.
---
What makes it better than retail? Retail is a glorified mobile game. Classic is the game that put mmos on the map.
---
the tactics? dont stand in the fire and swing on boss
---
it isnt about min maxing dude
---
min maxing describes when ppl worry about 1 fucking dps or some shit
---
what you are trying to do is just fail at basic competance
---
you dont spec holy priest if you want to dps do you?
---
arms is notoriously bad PVE single target damage w/ a wasted debuff slot to boot
---
if youre showing up to raid without the proper spec, it's like any other failure, like showing up in greens and not farming pre-raid blue gear, never using any consumables, etc. 
---
i guess if you have an super casual guild that wipes constantly in raid and doesnt care about loot you can come as arms
---
I am a long time OSRS player as well. Love the satisfaction of completing a bring (especially gear) 
---
I have never played WOW before classic release. My brother got me into it and I’m going to tell you now it’s a freaking blast. I have logged into osrs maybe 1 time to check the GE and some prices and logged right off. 
---
I say 100% you should give it a shot. If you join Thunderfury alliance I will help you with some bags and goods to help you get started
---
Gotta be a fucking moron to shout about how it's terribad and all this shit while private servers was better and not understand server architecture or have number of players in the zone data available.  But here we are with another one of these threads.
---
Of course. But your hunter. It happens
---
I personally only filter 1 guild that i know is Spanish and terrible, but i understand that if people have to to choose, they should filter on gear.
---
I do plan on taming one to learn the moves, but I unfortunately won't be keeping it because as I said I prefer the white wolf model more.
---
This is already a well known hypothesis. It's been tested player side by using windfury and other chance on hit effects to show that there must be additional parameters to RNG. Example- (1) if X action hasnt occurred in Y times, then add Z modifier.
---
Ehhhh... imp Drain Soul is pretty bad as a leveling talent even if you specifically play around it.
---
It MUST be a drain soul tick that kills the mob. Anything else won't trigger the bonus. And the bonus is doubling your passive mana regen for 10 seconds. I don't know what you're skipping to get that talent, but it's not worth the points.
---
P.S. this was changed in BC to give you the bonus as long as one of your spells landed the killing blow.
---
I don't play Runescape but if you like more older style MMOS then I think you would prefer classic. Classic is a lot more grindy when it comes to levels and specing your character. Both have grinds for loot, although I personally believe the loot grind in Classic is more rewarding. 
---
I am sure someone else will go into more detail but classic WoW is a lot more older style MMO than Retail.
---
They already have everyone's money they do not care.
---
Say something and someone smarter will say something smarter:).
---
The old rule of the Internet is still working as intended.
---
Id go orc is ur basing off racial stats. 25% stun resist + ur pvp trinket for fears&gt; than wotf....imo atleast
---
If you AoE grind you deserve it
---
I'd hire ya to gather herbs and mine for me.  I'm not sure if that's against the TOS though.
---
Honestly did not know that, that's great news to hear
---
Every MC I've done with any of the guilds I've filled in for, its RAINED druid gear.
---
They usually have 1 actual resto druid and then they are forced to disenchant or just dump it on to the token feral druid in the raid.
---
Meanwhile, 6 weeks later I have yet to get a single piece of shaman T1.
---
And you’ll be giving up hands down one of the best single target DPS in the game?
---
Your loss I guess lol
---
I just started playing myself with a friend who was glued to OSRS. I think he still gets on there every now and then for farm runs, but this game seems like it completely made him forget about rs.
---
As for me, I played osrs for a small amount of time but it never captivated me like classic WoW is right now. I love straight up RPGs and had never played an MMO outside of ESO.
---
Idk man, this game though is just amazing. We're having a blast. As for population, there are people everywhere on my server atleast. Also, we're definitely not the only ones who have never played WoW that decided to give this a try. I'd say it's probably growing in population.
---
If you pre-order the new xpac you get a free max level retail character.
---
Druid tanks have the great advantage that you can tank, heal and dps without re-arranging your talent trees.
---
This means if you're off-tanking in a raid, on the fights that don't need an offtank you can either join the healers or dps as needed (and if you DPS then every fight some lucky healer gets a new mana bar through Innervate).
---
While it is very rare for a druid to be the number one Main Tank in 40 man raids, it's a lot easier to gear two plate-wearing warrior tanks and one leather-wearing druid than three warrior tanks ...
---
Druids also have better AOE tanking than prot warriors, although worse than Paladins.
---
Druids are also utterly able to tank every five-man instance in the game.
---
1. no. blizz doesn't release player counts. lots of full servers and full servers have many more players than vanilla full servers. Guilds are pretty important for finding groups and socializing. 
---
2. the progress "feels" better. When you are in a major town, you can tell who is a badass by what they are wearing (in retail you can change the looks of your gear). in retail the lines between the different classes are very blurred; in classic the lines are not blurred. in retail all specs excel; in classic we have meme specs (ret paladins, enh shaman Oomkins for examples)-basically these specs aren't optimal for pve but are tons of fun in pvp or w/e.
---
classic is every bit worth trying for $15 (the cost for the monthly subscription) to try for 30 days. try it. do what feel fun as far as class or spec.
---
Ok I see that makes sense now.
---
I always quote my friend on rank 14 players. 
---
"Either account sharing or on Meth"
---
Tailoring is not terrible. It meshes pretty decently with disenchanting, and the mooncloth cooldown is nice passive income right now. My druid is also tailor/enchant. Though I might ditch enchanting. Not sure, after getting smoking heart. Gotta decide before investing into expensive recipes. 
---
Leatherworking is not bad, but there is no particular reason to have it on the same character as uses the stuff.
---
what a moron, ofcourse the server dont lag in a duel
---
I think you're missing the point.
---
There's no doubt that a shard can handle less than a dedicated server, right?  Otherwise it would be pointless to even have shards.
---
So no matter what the exact number is, even if there are only 2 shards per physical machine, they clearly have designed the server architecture to have more shards/layers/whatever on each physical machine and that means each individual shard/layer/whatever is going to perform worse than it would if that shard/layer/realm was on it's own dedicated machine.
---
That's the point.
---
He doesn’t mean epic quality; he says epic in place of valuable BoE blues. Some of those BoE’s are crazy expensive because they are twink items
---
Or fight literally any mob next to the mass of  scarabs in ZF. It’ll proc 100% of the time.
---
Lmaoo wow.  This was the one in tanaris. He was a good 10 levels below me and I was literally just passing by to ungoro lol I don't know why but it's payback from STV days lol
---
lets be real.  private servers were only played because there was no official playable version of classic.
---
even the best private servers were completely horrible when it comes to actual gameplay.
---
Rule #5 is hard to understand apparently.
---
You found henhouse!
---
Depending on what build you're going it gets you access to certain powerful abilities earlier, for example if you're going combat swords you want to rush to riposte asap bc it's broken early on. Crit dagger spec putting 2 points into relentless gets you a massive crit chance buff etc etc
---
A full clear takes me a little while as I'm not sm/ds or succubus drain spec. I'd say roughly half hour-40 minutes  if I'm killing and looting absolutely everything
---
See it now!  
---
Yeah, resto gold farming kind of sucks.  It's why I am working on a couple alts as well.  
---
Other item to get ok gold...questing!  There are a lot of quests in game.  Doubt you've done them all.  Group up with someone and quest.  
---
Other farming - Group up for Ekto farming in WS.  Can sell the Ektos and if you grind the furlbogs, the firewater also sells well.
---
Troll rogues aren't half bad, the health Regen and berserk finds its place
---
We need to keep pushing this until blizzard bans these scum bags.
---
So I’ve been told to report. But two out of the 8 people who’ve done it have bragged about about how come back to do it multiple times. So I don’t see the report button working anything else I should be doing besides that? I’m not sure if I’m just stupid but i can’t even find a way to open a proper ticket on classic.
---
I have never ever ever played a video game with RNG without dozens of hypothesis about how this or that can not be random and must be controlled by one thing or the other. People are really really good at finding patterns in random numbers. Pseudo random number generation is a field of study you won't find errors or trends with your eyes or with anecdotes, it's really really good. How much data do you think you would need to collect to see a meaningful trend, it sounds like you have (at best) 70 data points where you kinda sorta have  a feeling for the distribution of inter-crystal wait times. I promise you that even if you had perfect unbiased recall, and you understood how to test for correlations in random number generation you would find you don't even have the statistical power to say anything.
---
You keep saying things like "you don't see this or that" but provide no calculations and no actual backing. Importantly you can't just look through strings of already determined random numbers and say "look this would be improbable" because you having infinitely many hypothesis.
---
Here's a challenge: go /rand 100000 times and see what your distribution looks like and look for temporal correlations. You won't see any.
---
The default raid frames can do class color, mana bars, etc, so, use that I guess?
---
there were also very few players on the servers compared to classic
---
Yea I mean it blows my mind that I tried answering his thread the best I could while giving first hand knowledge I have (because I mistakenly geared up as fury prot as well) and he gets upset. Like I don’t know why you would make this thread if you didn’t want advice. Like it’s way harder to fury prot dungeons compared to arms but you can work with it if you know how. The on pull WW on packs of 4 or more is huge. If you use serker rage, blood rage, and rage pots intelligently the shortcomings are a little less noticeable. That simple and the dude freaks out.
---
KEKW
---
Why? It’s taken me almost the exact amount of time to level as my rogue. I just have more gold from doing it over weaving in quests. That’s been the only experience difference.
---
Prat is a commonly used one that supports all the functionalities you're looking for and more.
---
Wut do u pickpocket for? Just pure silver or any specific items?
---
Jeeze, you sound upset. Maybe i'm just lucky and raid with some great people, who don't give a fuck and understand and have been thru vanilla before, but the more gear your MT has, the quicker everything goes (Trash, bosses, 5 man farming etc...). We all have jobs and real life obligations, so the sooner we clear (less than an hour clears now) the better. Realizing we have 20+ weeks to farm this before BWL (Already cleared 7 times) and that even our 3rd OT is almost fully decked out now. Everyone will get gear -- who cares if it's this week or in 3 weeks? Why not just make everything easier and quicker as a whole. Maybe you just raid with some really shitty people.
---
As a healer it can be nice...besides unavoidable dots/ n mechanics u can go pretty long in a raid without taking dmg...so you can plan the buff out switching to a dif ring when ur not gonna use the buff. But dungeons is more so when it can really shine with less downtime drinking. But as a dps caster its more so meh IMO.
---
Is racism politics to you?
---
Takes about 2 runs to learn thedungeon well enough.
---
What does that do?
---
&gt;&gt; I can literally mine 100 rich thorium nodes and get 0 crystals. I can then mine the next 100 and get 20 crystals. Yes, I mine a lot. But it has shown me two up and down cycles. Two positive and two negative streaks. This permeates the game.
---
I have experienced this exact thing in almost every aspect of the game.  Not sure if it's for real or just you notice when things happen this way.  I was farming DME for Rich Thor last weekend, first 2 runs I got 2x Blue Saphs and 3x Arcane Crystals, followed by 8 runs of just thorium.
---
Same thing occured to me farming Felcloth in Azshara, first hour found 2 Felcloth, second hour found 18 (I time my runs and input data into an excel sheet).  This RNG has seemingly followed me around, where my runs pretty much fall into less than 5/hour or greater than 15/hour (granted I've only spent ~5 hours farming this area so definitely possible sample size is the issue with both of my anecdotes).
---
To me the RNG in this game has always felt really streaky and it's quite bizarre.  Still not sure if I should have my tinfoil hat on or if it's just something you notice because usually finding multiple items in a row is noteworthy.
---
Yes, you did.
---
What *is* your point then?
---
I bought 7 swiftness potion recipes in the 1st week. They're still sitting in my bank. I'll see what the price is when WSG releases.
---
Paladins are more like Brigitte than Reinhardt.  This is coming from someone who loved playing both.
---
Druids are like if Roadhog pulled himself to targets.  A highly mobile wall of meat, but you can't effectively use your self healing unless you're out of combat.
---
If you are tank 3/4 pretty much anything works.  Just make sure you’re prepared for those “oh shit” moments.
---
That happened to me on pservers though
---
not the most unbalanced
---
I had same problem. Get the trinket tidal charm. It has been an absolute game changer for me against melee. Also swiftness potion and curse of weakness combined with dots will beat anyone range. Just always try to keep max distance and fear. Shadow ward always right away when see preist or other locks. I use Felhunter because it allows me to see rogues which is a huge problem for locks. We are human so use perception as well. Gl bro

Sixtyupgrades.com has helped me tremendously with my Shaman. I like the flexibility of being able to look through the list of items once the paper doll is filled out.

Their threat is probably higher than a protection warrior's though...
---
Yes because every class being completely even is fun and gives you a sense of identity.
---
LOL! Sorry to hear that.
---
Haha, I literally have hundreds of greater magic essences that I bought for 12s and am going to turn into 15s each tomorrow morning.
---
I've also bought low level meats and gems for below vendor value.  It happens constantly.
---
The prices have plummeted and people still put hundreds of Runecloth on the auction house for 3-5s each.
---
Ofcause it will. It will properly be put out on days with release of other studies games like we have seen in the past. The release date are never random.
---
Just dungeon spell cleave then lol
---
I'll second BRD. I get that it's huge and people don't like to spend the time to go through it, but it's a city. It's an actual full-on city that you do dungeons through. 
---
I remember my first run through took about 4-5 hours, and at about the 2 hour mark we made it to the bar and we took a break for RL stuff and it just felt so fitting. Sitting at an open table waiting for people to either get back or run back (FD FTW) will always be my favourite thing in a dungeon.
---
Paddington NSW?
---
I raid with fantastic people, but we have seen one t2 warrior pants and no helms and not a lot of other tank items. And we’ve been doing it for awhile. I find all tanks in my guild important and I rather have them all happy then one really happy one and 2-3 others just here
---
1.) The +5 bow/gun skill moves the effective hit cap down to 6% which means it's worth 3% hit, not 1%. 
---
2.) Agility enchants for weapons wont be out for a year or more, which means a hunters pre-BiS and BiS until BWL is the 2H sword from DM North, with Peacemaker from UD Strat a close second (4AP less).
---
3.) Devilsaur set is down to 180g on my server (Grobbulus) and under 130g if you buy the mats and have a LW you know make them. That's extremely cheap for gear you wont replace until you're equipping T1 pants/gloves for the 8pc set bonus.
---
Got mine for 15g
---
For the most part, 20 points into Holy is all you need for healing (Illumination), so I would probably put the remainder into Ret or respect into Holy/Prot. I’m level 50 and did the reverse of what you’re doing (full Ret first and then Holy) and let me tell you, Repentance is very helpful for PvP.
---
Also, even Ret paladins are “healers” in the sense that your damage isn’t as important as your utility, so imo as long as you understand that blessing/cleansing/healing is always going to be expected of you, I would play the class the way you enjoy it.
---
It is a great dungeon tbf. One full run is enough for a lifetime though. Its crazy how it can take longer than a end game raid lol
---
Exactly. How I can believe that Blizz wont buy an hardware 1000x cheaper?
---
Raelis spell announcer maybe? Not sure if it's updated for classic or not.

Hi, I recommend you check out the AddOn called Necrosis. It doesn't interfere with your non-Warlock characters and does a really really good job of managing your soul shards to the point that I don't even bother with a soul bag anymore.
---
This is an item you will want to hold on to for a long time.  It’s hard to sell at the moment for a high price because most people don’t have expendable gold. People are still saving for epic mount, leveling professions, and BIS BOEs.  In a couple months when people have epic mounts and have most of their “necessities” they will start looking at possibly buying rare pets. I have 6 of these pets at the moment that I’ve bought for an average price of 135g. I’m hoping I can sell for 500g plus, but that won’t be happening MT any time soon.
---
I bet he has no clue what Warcraft logs is either, but googling either one will take you there.
---
So what happened to the 3 mages and a priest thing?  You're going to get three hunters and a rogue with "brd xp farm + arena."
---
It kind of pisses me off that before release this place turned from a cult of "fuck layering/sharding" to "it'll be fine!!1". 
---
This is why I maintained the narrative of fuck sharding. If you think the only reason they implemented sharding in the first place was for player's convenience you're out of your mind. They built it from the ground up with the server's being incapable of handling this type of stuff, *hence why they needed fucking sharding to begin with*.
---
Sharding was temporary mitigation of these problems. And just as I thought, they appear to have not taken it seriously enough or fixed it in the time they bought themselves by implementing sharding in the first place.
---
Hey Julia. I also live in Paddington. Call me maybe. Can heal your hearth and am unable to deal damage.
---
Hard to say, I dont recall at which point you're nullifying boss armor with BRE on classic boss armor values. If you gain some armor penetration from 1-2  stacks of proc, BRE might still be better. It's easy to calucalte though. Boss armor (~3200) minus 5 stacks of sunder, Faerie fire, curse of reck, maybe annihilator if your guild is tryhard. What's left is what will be affected by the BRE proc.
---
&gt;  It only has to be you or your pet that lands the kill
---
Nope. It SPECIFICALLY needs to be a Drain Soul tick.
---
It was changed in 2.0 to be you or your pet.
---
EDIT: Sorry, I'm mis-remembering. This talent didn't include your pet until patch 2.1.
---
Oh lol didn't even know they had these settings
---
These are not the same. Layers isn't what prevent serious lag. Also, if the servers can't handle this, then it won't handle AV release either.
---
Unfortunately it’s wrong about everything and basically a post written by someone who just discovered what a SAN is.

These are the people playing hunters to fullest extent by the way. Keep knocking in your echo chamber claiming hunters are anything other than mid tier DPS. I can link this all I want too!

There's no BiS list as it's a niche build that's also quite new (to the community)

Hate to break it to you but people still sprinted through vanilla, they just weren't as good at sprinting.

Only the debuff needs to be active. Your damage sources are not what triggers the Shard. That's also the case for Shadowburn.

I haven’t heard a definitive answer between bite and claw, but I would assume go with claw since the CD is much smaller. The rest of those skills will work well for MC. I’ve noticed the biggest thing for pet damage in MC is being aware of which packs will aoe and kill your pet, and micromanaging when they attack and when they stand next to you.

Thanks, I will check it out tomorrow! Btw the domain is the other way around, so https://classicwow.live/

Super good suggestion :-)
---
The website is not meant to "judge" people's gear (e.g. for invites to raids etc) but it is ment for people who likes to browse their friends/guild mates/favorite streamers gear and build, and maybe get inspired. 
---
Unless Blizzard gives API access, it will never contain 100% updated gear and build of players and so the website shouldn't be used to judge other players gear etc with.

I personally loved checking out the different armories of players on the pvp ladder on retail to see their build/stat priorities/enchants etc :-)

Twinks have the potential to have a much more equal playing field than level 60 PvP. It takes a hell of a lot less time to twink out a 19 than it does to get rank 14 on a level 60.

You don't. Because you'll lose people if you try to drag out content longer than it should be for a decent amount of the playerbase, and you start to lose PvP being anywhere near good in the late AQ and naxx stages. Once naxx comes out there's kind of a ticking bomb before it starts to die since people will get shit on in PvP, and have no objective to go for
---
Lol nice troll.

I'm not sure why people dislike pets, it's easy enough to control them if you bind some of their movement abilities. As mentioned as well warlock pets can go invisible and are not a hassle with happiness/training abilities by taming other pets. 
---
Soulshards for warlocks isn't so bad either, just throw a soulshard bag as a bank slot and when you are out farming\\running a dungeon anyway just build up shards to bank when done and withdraw them on raid night. You don't need to go farm before each raid that way, you will generally always have your shard bag on you filled pretty easily without having to try as well.
---
...you are literally arguing about 1 fucking dps, most raids don't even account for nightfall users' dps! just shows that you have no idea what you are talking about

Unless you’re demonology spec you’ll probably start to find the void walker becoming more useless as your damage/threat increases. You’ll probably find it better to switch to any other demon just to burn mobs faster.

If you’re fighting mobs a few levels lower, you can probably take on 2-3 mobs at once by drain tanking and chain fearing. Use fear on one of the mobs and AOE fear on the other ones so you don’t break the first fear, dots on all then and kite.
---
Yeah you got a couple more zones that follow the ud story, then there is a gap for a while till you get back up around the plaguelands then it picks right back up full swing.
---
Yea haha sorry typo. 30
---
Not trolling then or now.  Go ahead and search through the rest of my comment history,  you'll find I rarely mention my race or orientation on reddit and only in relevant discussions.  
---
Frankly you're demonstrating my point perfectly,  you're so narrow minded that you cant possibly conceive of someone of my demographic disagreeing with you to the point you're certain I must be lying. 
---
Get over yourself.
---
Warlocks have underwater breathing spell
---
I'm RPing a double agent.
---
[You don't believe in it.](https://i.imgur.com/qUeHe0q.jpg)
---
lol that poor warlock
---
Name of this raid frame addon pls? 😁
---
Is there really a point to playing if you're not 60 in phase 2?
---
None of them.
---
I feel for you.
---
Renew is generally okay in dungeons and smaller groups as long as you're not constantly spamming it.  It's good on the tank as he heads into a fight.  In raiding you are going to want to be as mana-efficient as possible, and Heal uses a lot less mana than Renew.
---
Yeah, there aren’t many fights in MC where you need more than 2 tanks. The only ones I can think of are garr, sulfuron, and majordomo.
---
I think people underestimate how good hamstring can be. It's probably only 2nd to wingclip, for instant melee cc. For warrior, when your fighting a mob and see you are loosing slightly, hamstring and run 20rds for a few bandage ticks is one old trick. Also, being spacially aware, when a caster or healer pulls off a target your attacking, hamstring quickly and you will have not only prevented them from taking as much damage, but often caused more damage/healing because the caster/healer can continue doing damage or healing while the slowed mob slowly walks toward them. Learning the best times and uses for hamstring in pvp and pve can take a while, but it's a nice tool to have in the belt.
---
Someone linked me the 21/30 build!  Not good for PvP but I want to start running endgame content. And just ask if it's okay to roll in shadow gear cause eventually I want to go back to melting faces.
---
queues increased when they removed layers on my server last week, but went away within a day or so
---
Difference between assholes and socially well adjusted people:
---
Good people would simply tell you they need to kill one of your targets for a quest and ask to group up.
---
Assholes just assume the worst of you without asking and then go out of their way to troll you for merely playing a class they don't like.
---
Now all that being said, if someone did have a quest in the area, would you invite them to group so they can get it done and leave? Your answer here also helps us differentiate between nice guy and asshole ;)
---
I’ve been using a drain tank build from 37 to 44. Might be something you want to look into. Has yielded good results for me - good DPS and minimal downtime.
---
I think people see how easy the raids are and just assume, LOLWOW WAS EASY, and don't understand the pvp system is an entirely different beast.
---
Are you Feral druid ?
---
None of the streamers are very good for learning the game.
---
A week ago in Org someone asked in Trade Chat how to quit a guild. After about 5 seconds there were many lols and wtfs.
---
I don't mind answering questions. I'm combat swords and it's been fine. Just make sure you have a vanish off of CD. I'm thinking of respeccing for movement speed and preparation, but maybe next week. I never get detected in BRD, so improved stealth isn't necessary. Also, don't get too close to the fire lords, they have a fire shield that will pop you.
---
Last night on Faerlina horde so many people were trying to get the Ony buff that it glitched it out and only one person in our entire raid got it. This was about 10m after a head dropped on the other layer, so really it was a fraction of the cluster fuck it should have been. 
---
It took me over a minute to login or logout; people think layering is cancer but it's nothing compared to the game being unplayable
---
Ye I mean it's not awful if that was the average payout, for those already farming something at around that rate it might be a nice change of pace. The variance in drops and how much they actually sell for is gotta be insane though.
---
He is currently unavailable, would you like to leave a message? I will make sure that he receives it after he gets back.
---
This only works if other high levels are there. lol though. And Why would they be in the first place? If it’s an agreed upon place to fight then you’re still fighting 60s
---
Cataclysm brought back twinking, imo, for the 70’s bracket. You could fully deck yourself out in Cata greens and a lot of blues and be an absolute fucking monster at 78. Have a few friends and didn’t need that deep of pockets.
---
What the fuck?
---
Well, I guess you’re right. Also today I was last man standing together with a oom healer, finishing off the boss with evasion, and other cd’s. felt amazing. So. Cool class. I’m convinced.
---
Right but why? 60s just agree to go there and fight each other
---
Ability queuing is using the 'feature' or better described as a bug, where you can queue up Heroic Strike after your main hand has hit but before your offhand does.  Then you cancel the ability after the offhand hits but before the main hand uses the ability.  This works because HS gives a +hit bonus to your offhand when queued.  And because HS is not the best rage dump for dps warriors, you can use a macro (along with a swing timer) to queue and cancel your heroic strike for maximum dps.
---
Other note, dual wielding gives you a massive -hit to your attacks.  Around 25%.  So to have this ability make your offhand hits ignore this penalty boosts your damage significantly, as it also generates more rage, which means more damage.
---
Do it at 3am ofc
---
As a rogue I don't know. I remember doing SM on a pally and getting good amount of gold but I'm not sure if as a rogue you can beat brd run
---
Maybe madseasontv or staysafetv.
---
Not a lot of educational or beginner streamers for wow
---
Watch a couple of YouTube videos, plenty of good ones, watch some beginner guides, dos and donts, and then more end game stuff like PvP to give you motivation
---
&gt; It's not really hard at all. You have unlimited access to the engine. You can perfectly simulate any possible spec and the upper limits of its dps, survivability, etc.
---
This is one of the most naive things I've read on here in a while, it perfectly encapsulates the idiocy of the community.  Even assuming they could 'perfectly simulate' all the different ways players can spec and the effect that has on every mob, every boss, every dungeon, and every raid - and in multiple settings solo, 2-man, 3-man, etc., up to 25-man raids - with every single different possible gear loadout - someone still has to decide on what to do when there is a discrepancy and/or something is out of whack.  Then, once that change is in DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN, because that one change could change hundreds of simulations.
---
That said, you can't model all those combinations.  So this comes to you're other naive point:
---
&gt; They don't want to spend resources to think about the different ways players might play, so they instead limit the ways players can play to make it cheaper for themselves.
---
Even all mighty Blizzard doesn't want to spend a ton of money on something that isn't even on most lists that people complain about?  Amazing.  The old joke of 'this cost us a raid tier' might be totally true if you got you 'perfectly simulate' requirement because they'd have to spend all their money and resources on a Deep Blue-level supercomputer and nothing on the rest of the game.  It would cost us expansions instead.
---
Obviously you know nothing about software development.  You're about as bad as the idiots who thought that getting WoW Classic going was as easy as booting up one of their old servers and having at it.
---
Just play the game yourself instead of watching some weirdo play it, man!
---
i have a 34 warlock and I've used voidwalker exclusively. No issues with threat unless you don't train your pet skills. Which unfortunately, I think most people don't know about. I even forget and if you forget to rank up the taunt ability your voidwalker will simply not be able to hold threat.
---
As a warlock your main issue is management of threat so you can dot up and intentionally pull aggro when the mob hits around half life which creates a very efficient leveling process where your voidwalker and you are perpetually at high life and mana pull after pull.
---
I would agree with madseason but most aren’t worth your time.
---
Both of those points were true of private servers as well,  and it still took about 4 weeks.
---
Streamers? Only a few of them are good.
---
Plenty of YouTube content creators that are great.
---
Skarmtank is one I thoroughly enjoy.
---
Didn’t they remove layering already
---
Oh that's what you meant, makes sense.
---
Someone asked how to kick people from the guild. Someone replied that the way to do this was to use the command gquit. This command causes you to quit your guild.
---
What server are you playing on?
---
Not on all servers
---
You can get both ginormous cloud instances and even dedicated machines on the cloud (some of the larger instance sizes are automatically their own machine you have exclusive access). This is either them cheaping out on the amount of hardware allocated or just limitations built into how they coded the game.
---
We had guild members section off the area
---
Not easy in a sense of mechanical gameplay. I mean overall gameplay wise they have it ALL.   
---
   
---
Can AoE Farm, fastest leveling if done correctly.
---
Can make food/water for self  
---
Can sell food water/portals  
---
can portal at any time 
---
With medium level skill can be gods of PVP just due to their enormous CC
---
I'm by no means saying what they are doing to you is right. I'm just trying to give you a reason as to WHY they are doing it. It's because so many mages that are met throughout the game are not nice, tend to rush dungeons, tend to create stressful atmospheres, and that leads to a huge bias towards ALL mages.
---
Ew then I’d have to socialize
---
One of my favorite pranks is to stand in the massive mob at the gate in AV before it starts and type "/e has flagged you as AFK. If you are not AFK, type /afk clear to unflag yourself." Usually gets 5-10 people.
---
“Makes people profoundly nervous at a great distance” i lol’d! 
---
so true &gt;:)
---
So you're telling me at the 95th percentile that hunters beat mages and when I tell you at the ninety ninth percentile of guilds mages BLOW hunters out of the water you refute it and go crawling back to your statistical average? Hint hint, nobody cares about average in WoW. You care about the BEST. 
---
The 99th percentile is the top end of raiding guilds popping flasks, getting all world buffs, doing dedicated speed runs, etc. You're a fucking fool to think otherwise. I would LOVE to see any raiding guild stack hunters like they do mages, warriors and rogues. They don't for a REASON. So ignorant it's fucking hilarious. 
---
I've broke this down cookie cutter style for you and you refuse to accept you're wrong. It's so laughable.
---
 I put the significance rate at .01 because it signifies the BEST which is where the BEST players will shine. Hunters are notoriously fucking easy to play, that's why your average hunter will beat your average mage.
---
 The guilds in the top .01 min max Mana, downtime, AOE, sappers, dynamite and boss kill time and mages ALWAYS beat hunters on it. Imagine that.
---
Sweet, first tine playing rogue, and just about to ding 60, but been focusing on xp mostly esp with RL and sporadic play times, and not much time to focus on other specs and farming etc. over just getting xp and whatever needed upgrades :), gotta get info on how to best pvp soon too and all that jazz :p.. but thx man appreciate it :).
---
find someone who plays your class that you enjoy watching pretty much. Just scroll down the wow page every now and then and give the people of your class a 5-10 min watch to find what you enjoy, and then learn from them.
---
Don't watch streams you don't enjoy to learn, that's just gonna be a bad experience. Watch streams for enjoyment, and get some knowledge as a bonus deal.
---
Mazdaratti life
---
I'm just telling you how the spell works.
---
I honestly don't care if you don't like it or if you think it's some kind of personal insult against you.

Anyone who doesn't believe me can either try it for themselves or go to the wowhead page about it and check the comments there:

---
kromcrush - had a 15 min queue (only 150 people though kind of weird) the day layers were removed tried logging in ~7pm EST. (peak time)
---
not suddenly
---
I feel like the people who decide to take staff of dominance now should get prio on staff of shadow flame or claw of chromaggus in phase 3. Mageblade + offhand much better though for phase 1 + 2.
---
It should not affect queues. Cause server size remain unchanged they just divide it into 2 layers.
---
It's all good.
---
Makes me sick when people beg for gold, I ALWAYS give them shit
---
sounds like you're reading a guide that was intended for pirate servers. the technique does not work  well on classic. 
---
it's only really useful if you're bouncing aggro on a big elite between different players if there's no healer around.
---
so you're saying i could live my dreams as a moonkin druid and not have to melee things to death for half the fight?
---
No, tested this in BRD last night. Had a 26 boar and they didn’t aggro his circle, just my characters.
---
3 dungeon runs on passive brought him up to level 39.
---
Also the pretty sure the mob needs to be green or better to you for your pet to get xp from it,
---
In the demo, all the current talent rows were still there. IIRC, the levels for them were 15, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 or something along those lines.
---
As for changes to the actual talents, doesn't seem like they've gotten much into spec rebalancing yet at this point in the development cycle.
---
I think those are cow chop socks if im not mistaken.
---
And you should meet some of these people and see their character. Not their in game characters their personal characteristics that get transcribed into the game cause they are shitty shitty humans.
---
Yeah the far left movement really need to be contained.
---
&gt; Nope. It SPECIFICALLY needs to be a Drain Soul tick.
---
Incorrect.  It only needs to be you (not your pet) that deals the killing blow.  As long as you put your pet on passive before the mob dies you will get the buff.  If you don't believe me, get a mob in shadowbolt health range, fire it off and before it hits start drain soul.  Check your combat logs.  The shadow bolt kills the mob, you get the buff.
---
It's not worth learning for leveling, good for pvp.
---
That's pumpkin pie
---
You might be better off just fapping to a camgirl.
---
Let the world of warcraft open up to you organically. You might find the game to be more enjoyable if you experience it all on your own, at your own pace.
---
I don't think there are any good streamers to watch before starting out. Best of luck to you out there!
---
Fair warning it's not the best gold per minute technique but it's steady, consistent, and I don't get bothered by alliance or other horde members and herb nodes. It's super brainless farming but that's what farming is. Hit me up if you want PVP advice please to play a rogue OG vanilla
---
You don't think letting his competitor know he's weak is a problem?
---
Punkrat and WillE on YouTube both have some great video series for players just starting out or returning for classic.
---
Locks are sometimes assigned another curse to keep up, some raids these days are letting then use corruption too. Then the rest would be healthstones/summons/soulstones and in MC a bit of banishing.
---
It's not much more though, the plus I would say for warlock is it's played a lot less than mage (at least on alliance) so it's easier to find groups and the utility will still get you some demand.
---
If you ever tried another class you'd see why warrior is generally considered harder to level.
---
But neither of these skills are critical endgame.
---
Oh look at mister I give every gold begger gold, so woke
---
&gt;That sounds terrible.
---
damn I spit my coffee out
---
is your reading comprehension THAT bad? I said that "min maxing defines when a player worries about 1 dps." I then proceeded to say I AM NOT MIX MAXING. 
---
wtf dude, youre so clueless
---
my point is that going arms is far beyond simply not min-maxing. It's falling below a basic level of competence. In reality it is more of a 150-300 dps loss depending on what phase you are in. 
---
Youre literally dead weight w/ a negative effect on the raid as arms. If you go fury 2h you can at least reach 80%ish if the dps you need while buffing the raid w/ nightfall. Because it boosts other classes 15% it's worth it. 
---
But why is it worth it? Because 15% is a lot. Likewise going arms and losing 50% of your own dps is a lot. 
---
Coming as arms to raid is not choosing to avoid min/maxing. That is simply coming unprepared to raid night. Min maxing is when people worry about extremely small power boosts. Coming as arms versus fury is not a small gap. It is significant, and super easy to fix by simply going to the trainer.
---
Lol, did you really say the 95th percentile is equilavent to the 'average'? Alright, thanks for confirming that you have zero clue about what you're talking and actually put the nail in the coffin for yourself. You're a complete idiot.
---
If we would take the average, these would be the relevant statistics:
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/statistics/1000#metric=dps&amp;dataset=50&amp;class=DPS
---
As you can see, it looks severely different and hunter is now even higher.
---
Now let's look at the academically most significant data. A.k.a the most representative and normalized data of every single server in the world as shifted by the TOP guilds:
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/statistics/1000#metric=dps&amp;dataset=95&amp;class=DPS
---
There is a reason the best logging site puts hunter in top 3 dps on their FRONTPAGE:
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/
---
Lmao, get a clue, little uneducated troll.
---
Which guides do you recommend?
---
When you need to heal turn ret off and turn concentration aura on, now you have 100% resist to spell pushback.
---
Give your mage wisdom instead of salv and BoP him and you can kill faster/with less downtime. With nova and bop there's no need whatsoever for salv, as mage should be pulling off you every time.
---
Oh that's cool, I'd coordinate with the larger, more prominent guilds, too, considering the population imbalance there.
---
It's the same on Gehennas, here's some clips from today.

It's actually embarassing that they're running classic on a Nokia 3310.
---
And we're paying for this shit.
---
Even worse, if we all unsub'd - they'd just say "ah well, we tried giving them Classic, but it appears they didn't really want it after all."
---
I'm getting nostalgic over the private server experience...
---
We're a lot more knowledgeable than we were. Rag died a WEEK after release, not months. Many guilds clear the raid content in a night, wasn't possible back then.
---
Timeline NEEDS to be faster.
---
Hey so I've just started both an enhancement shaman and an affliction warlock. I'm seeing that enhancement shaman has little desirability at 60, is affliction lock any better or did I chose the 2 classes no one wants anything to do with?
---
It's called the global cooldown or GCD. It keeps you from doing infinite instacast spells back to back with no delay but doesnt impact anything with a cast time (longer than 1.5s if i recall correctly). If you hit fireblast at the end of a frostbolt cast when the mob is about to die anyways, you'll have to wait for the GCD but it will be dead already anyways so no lost DPS.
---
yes we are the pariahs..perfect for a good rp.
---
Naw, that'd be ninja'ing in my book.
---
&gt; And the bonus is doubling your passive mana regen for 10 seconds.
---
I think that's the significant part, not how hard or easy it is to get it to proc. Spirit regen just isn't where any significant amount of your mana comes from in the first place, so doubling it still doesn't change much.
---
I have heard of these mythic MMO gamer girls. Alas, I have never dated one.
---
Mining thorium &amp; arcane crystals in the hives in silithus. Got my epic mount in a week there
---
I feel this. This was roughly 4-5 weeks ago(but somehow feels a lifetime ago). Even when I've advertised "arena only" and assembled a group, by the time we're all in the dungeon and finish the arena, I proceed to run to reset, one guy goes "but you said anger/arena" and is quickly followed by a second fellow.
---
Well shrug, I know what I said but hey if we can do anger(and thankfully we did) then hey hey all the power to the group. But this really brings to mind exactly you said. You might for something, but whether it truly happens is another matter, especially with pugs.
---
I've had everything from a full run which lasted easily 4 hours long, to runs where people dropped in and out, replacing as many as 3 different people by the time the run concluded. And other times I wanted a fuller run but nope it was only arena because that's all the group wanted.
---
I suppose that’s true. I can’t imagine not ever doing it. Some of the gear in there is just insane and the quests are just icing on the cake. 
---
If it wasn’t obvious it’s also my favorite dungeon.
---
His videos are fine. His stream is really boring though
---
He knows too, don't worry.
---
OLD PEOPLE BAD
---
YOUNG PEOPLE GOOD
---
The next retail expansion will be the driving influence over the classic phase release schedule.  I don't think they'd want phase 5-6 on the verge of release at the same time as shadowlands, so I imagine phase 6 will be released a month before 9.0.
---
People say its unbalanced because it is. Two weeks after launch when the census addons were working, it showed stalagg was the most horde heavy server in NA. After duskwood on alliance it was nearly impossible to level because there were no groups to do any elite quests with and horde were everywhere. Everyone went to heartseeker and it made the problem worse, I waited for a week after transfers opened before going to heartseeker. Considering it was the worst before transfers, I would bet stalagg is still the most horde heavy server in NA.
---
/dance
---
I’d say warlock. Despite being a pure DPS class, the three specs feel **very** different. Affliction is slower, more measured, and DoT based, whereas Destruction is bursty. Demonology maximizes your own tankiness and survivability, and it also makes your minions stronger and better able to keep you alive. Each pure spec is very fun, though you’ll want to look up the hybrid specs, as they are best for questing, raiding, and PvPing.
---
My main’s a Druid, so I love the class, but you’ll either be healing or off-tanking for the most part. They are very dynamic healers, and their tanking mechanics are 10x simpler than warriors. Plus, you are nearly ungankable in wPvP.
---
You really can’t go wrong, but I’d give the edge to warlock.
---
Prefer a rogue to a dps warr any day of the week.
---
AQ and Naxx are going to last a long time. AQ is probably going to take 5-6 months, and Naxx even longer than that.
---
There's the vast majority of the playerbase who have never SEEN the inside of BWL, let alone AQ and Naxx (40).
---
The phases will slow down, but they need to get the trivial things out of the way sooner, to keep people interested.
---
Also they are going to be releasing shadowlands for retail sometime next year, probably in one of the lulls, my guess is phase 4.
---
Used to play with a guy named Crazytank, but then again I imagine it’s probably a fairly common name.
---
Because fuck mages ofc
---
Like I said. You can do this to all classes. Warriors are so lucky they get to be the top dps, top pvp, and top tank. 
---
Priests get to be ungodly good 1v1 pvp, top healers, easiest leveling, (even easier than mages, mages can be faster. But not easier than)
---
Hunters get to have a tank with them that doesn’t take away from their exp and can heal them. 
---
Druids can survive a lot, stealth, tank, heal, are fairly god like in 1v1 against mele. Etc
---
Rogues. If you don’t want to do something like a key attunement don’t worry you have LP, don’t want to fight all these mobs to get to the collection for a quest. Stealth. Don’t Wana pvp stealth, someone killing your stuff no fun combo them while they sit there for 30 seconds not able to play the game. 
---
Paladins- literally unkillable by p6.
---
Shamans get to be the best mele healers, will always have a spot in raid for windfurry, can play any of their specs and have a use until the end of time
---
Warlock literally the easiest gold making class in the game. Not only do they have pets that can rank for them but can solo most dungeons, they stand a chance against everyone in pvp, souls stones so they have two lives. Can aoe farm just lower levels than themselves and are essentially dark angry mages. 
---
And on top of that you could be the most geared mage in the world and I’ll still one shot ambush you with your shield down unless you have fort up.
---
You seem to be under the impression that 19 twinks will only play against under-geared level 10's. I think those brackets are going to be mostly twink vs twink.
---
Make an undead warrior and PvP. Ally locks and priests will love you :)
---
Yes broken text being translated to the opposite faction will DESTROY the game you play.
---
I've seen a lot of people say its still doable on classic but having a bit of a different technique. Theres a video showing you need to get out of range from attack hitboxes then going in to that hitbox for an auto attack, not straight at the mob. If its an important mechanic i want to learn it just seems like it doesn't work for me no matter how hard i try. from the replies though that specific technique seems to be only usefull in certain situations so thats good.
---
&gt;Anyone who doesn't believe me can either try it for themselves
---
dude, have YOU used it in classic? I'm telling you that you're wrong, because I have **dozens of hours of experience using the talent** to back up my position. Maybe you are right about how it worked in vanilla, but in classic right now, it works with any damage you or your pet causes.
---
The only person that cares about the meters is whoever is posting them. Non DPS generally do not care about meters.
---
this process COMPLETELY depends on your server and faction. You can get R14 quite easily if there are not numerous other groups directly competing with you, which would be the case on the smaller faction on a pve or rp server.
---
There are two things you need no matter what. A group of at least 15 that works out a schedule of who gets what rank each week and the ability of that group to play consistently every single week. not a big deal. Whether this group has to nolife 15 hrs/day to get 3M honor or only 20 hrs/week to top the ranks with 600K honor is completely dependant on what other groups are also doing the same thing on YOUR faction on your server. In many cases multiple groups work out deals between themselves (that is caps) specifically to avoid the nolife thing.
---
On the right server you  can go from R10 to R14 in a couple months max, even with competition, and only playing a completely reasonable number of hours per week. doesn't have to be every day either, you can do 10 hrs on sat / sun and pretty much nothing  on the weekdays.
---
Finally we are in 1.12 when the grind formula is significantly easier than what vanilla people dealt with for most of their BGs.
---
Lol facts
---
I made this comment around here yesterday.   It’s absurd that an MMO isn’t capable of performing one of its primary advertised features.
---
You had a choice of pvp or pve server. Stop bitching like all the others who where preaching PVP ONLY M8. Then come here and forums to cry.
---
Blackrock mountain, a shithole only Ragnaros could love. Glad i was able to capture the sense of dread and resilience required to run BRD.
---
Strange thing is the kinda managed to have acceptable queues now. Last week my server had like 2-3hours at primetime, now it's like 15 mins.
---
for leveling? 
---
no
---
the server lag, spell batching, and increased melee distance on moving targets makes it a complete waste of time unless your weapon has a 4.0 second swing timer
---
if your 2h is more around 3.3 seconds youll find that you actually take more dmg relatively speaking than if you just stayed melee and kept swinging
---
Yep. Was originally apart of a smaller guild thinking of joining the accord before we decided to just absorb into one of the larger guilds apart of it. Made it so much easier to find groups for dungeons, farm runs, and raids so far. Plus a lot of people just willing to give advice. Did a 25 min jump yesturday so they could explain to me how it works. Then did another 4 in a hour with no issues and me walking out of there with several upgrades.
---
Just not sure why it’s directed only at mages. I never ever dealt with anyone like this with my rogue. I never had people pulling things at me because I can stealth past all the other mobs. Like...

Even funnier: throwing up an [Ancient Dalaran](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=120146/ancient-portal-dalaran#comments) portal\*. It looks exactly the same as a normal Dalaran portal on mouseover, but instead teleports you about 50 feet in the air over the giant crater in Hillsbrad, whereupon you promptly fall to your death.
---
Use it sparingly on your guild members so they think they can trust you.

^(\*WotLK and later)
---
&gt; any and all classes are accepted whenever I form a group as I want everyone to get loot and have a good experience
---
i was like that, too, but losing that 5% drop item 6 times in a row will quickly change your tune lol
---
Were you in a grinding spot though? You may have been out of the quest areas but while leveling I ran into some mages who would be AOE farming some of the top grind spots which was frustrating. I didn't grief anyone but I would constantly have mages who would deliberately run over to tag a mob I had already put dots on (take a bit to tag) to bring it into their AOE storm which was really annoying.
---
+23 offhand of frozen wrath on ah prob easiest/best
---
I think tier 0.5 should come out in phase 4 with ZG. Good spot in the timeline for the catch up mechanic.
---
2 things:
---
1. Arathi highlands fire elementals. Druids are overpowered taggers with moonfire, just camp your toon there spamming a macro like /tar fire elemental /cast moonfire and you will make crazy gold per hour. The mobs are so low health you can do a wrath + moonfire to finish them or something.
---
2.Diremaul tribute with rogue. This can be done with at least prebis gear, and as druid you gear super fast in raids anyway. Basically you stealth all the way to tribute, then kill king gordok while kiting the caster.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GrSZdrrZ74](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GrSZdrrZ74)Keep note that the rogue NEEDS a specific spec for this, which is kinda annoying.
---
LF2M 1 heals 1 tank for DMT spam
---
People still fall for the /e macro that says a rogue pickpockets you and stole your gold. The /camp trick worked like a charm even into Cata. Lets not forget about macroing something like "/e has reported you for being AFK. In 30 seconds you will be removed for inactivity unless you type in /afk to clear this status." If theres a trick, theres a person whose going to fall for it.
---
I’ve listened to healers, I’ve listened to rogues.
---
I’ve watched all the warlocks, who steal someone’s soul.
---
Oh pretty please forgive my lack of deference to your self-stated superior existence.
---
Obviously, I've gone wrong in having an opinion because an internet person patronized me for it.
---
Playing with people with this dumb fucking mentality enriches the experience, you postulate?
---
why did you not xfer?
---
Yeah. Current content doesn't really have any fights that a paladin can't tank.
---
think that's just your experience. my guild is overflowing with rogues and hunters and have barely any fury/mages
---
It's like a puzzle that nobody will notice if you solve, but will make a difference nonetheless.  Takes a certain kind of personality to enjoy.
---
Zandalar is probably the best eu realm.
---
Is it just my server or is it common for a large percentage of the player base to be huge assholes. I’m newer to the game and whenever I ask questions or see others ask questions the main response is just hateful shit. There have been times when I’ve interacted with some very nice and accepting people but most of the time I’ve seen really shitty behavior. Plus tons of awful comments about race and religion all the time on LFG. I definitely don’t consider myself that sensitive but the amount of terrible stuff I see on the world chats towards new players can be overwhelming.
---
Irony is a cold hearted bitch
---
Wtf is this post? How does 1 bite = 5 claws in any situation? 
---
&gt;As a bite that overkills is wasted damage
---
Yeah, no, with 40 people in a raid you shouldn't even be thinking about overkill damage. It's just so rare compared to the bulk of dps you are putting out; especially when it's bite. It's not like it's execute or some ridiculously high damage ability that might be overkilling by 1k or more; and even then it's a pretty moot point since after a kill you're probably out of combat.
---
You can *say* that bite frontloads damage, and it does; but because bite is on a CD it comes down to how long you can stay on target at once. Chances are, you'll be able to focus dump with claw fast enough that the "front loading" aspect isn't really relevant either.
---
Just block them and in-character explain that the Loa must have cursed you to not ever hear a word they said because to  you they're totally mute.

---
Emerald Dream FTW
---
&gt; dude, have YOU used it in classic?
---
Yup. It doesn't proc unless the killing blow is Drain Soul.
---
It can't be your pet. It can't be another spell. It has to specifically be a Drain Soul tick.
---
I played around it for a few levels before ditching the talent.
---
If you don't like it... I don't know what to tell you. I'm sorry if you feel this is some kind of personal insult directed at you.
---
Just to clarify the main post: Is it a confirmed feauture in WoW Classic that Seal of Righteousness rank 3 has 20% scaling per weaponswing instead of the usual 10%?   
---
If so, that seems like a pretty large unintended bug.
---
Correct. But the number of times the US and the Soviets directly fought each other is very very low. To make the metaphor directly apply to WoW's factions, NATO never had direct hostilities, even in a minor way, with the Warsaw Pact. 
---
If WoW had a Cold War akin to the real one, then orcs and humans would rarely strike blows at each other. Rather, they'd be funding &amp; arming proxies. Alliance would be shipping weapons to the centaurs and the quillboars. Horde would be providing guns, red bandanas, and training to the Defias. Each faction would pick a side in the Goblin conflicts and fully support them. But if a human and an orc met each other in the field, they'd probably interact with a cautious politeness and then go their separate ways because neither one is at the pay grade for starting a war. 
---
Furthermore, the Alliance would note the Horde is short of many necessary resources and would make bank selling stuff directly to them. Just as the US exported wheat to the Soviet Union.
---
Isnt that what they did from d2 to d3? and also when they revamped the wow talent tree system? I wouldnt necessarily call either a success.  
---
The issue is that there is balance the way it is and if you try squishing it, you ruin it. It also isnt necessarily less user friendly, you just need to look at it a little bit and plan it out. Just because you cant randomly click somewhere and not make a wrong decision, doesnt mean its not "user friendly".
---
* cat ✔️

Upboat. Me simple.
---
Buy the mats off the auction house then ask in trade chat.  Or you should just see people advertising regularly.
---
As far as tips, it's sort of subjective.  For a rarer enchant they might charge a bit more, but if you are providing all the mats you should have more room to negotiate.
---
If you've never played before then I'd say don't ruin it with guides and streams. Experience it as a new player first.
---
Yes. Get plate gear with intellect for PvP. Tier 1 + tier 2 is ideal, but the Lightforge set can work in a pinch. You will cast max rank Holy Light and Cleanse a lot in PvP, so intellect tends to be more important than bonus healing, and obviously plate gear for the survivability. And for the love of god: wear a shield! Either Sacred Protector or Malistar's Defender.
---
For a talent build: Holy Shock and Improved Concentration Aura are the two most important talents for PvP healing. 31/20/0 is perfectly usable in both raids and PvP.
---
You can also get a 2H to swap to for killing clothies. Not a high priority, but if no one in your MC raid wants a Finkle's Lava Dredger when it drops? Pick it up just to have it.
---
&gt;If we're finishing up a pull and a patrol is wandering by. If it's in a position where it can be easily solo pulled, distract it, so I can easily pull/clean it up after we finish the current pull, instead of having to wait for it to patrol back around. This is super helpful in Undead Strat, for example.
---
I've had tanks getting pissed when I do this, they don't like me pulling anything. But when ever I distract and gun pull them click evasion and Dodge tank it, I have 0 threat and the rack can easily pull off me.
---
Again, I get bitched at for doing that more than I get a good job. Tanks rather just wait for the pat to come back around.
---
thanks for the response! &lt;3
---
Let's just all agree to only have 5v5s max.
---
Hilarious, you can't even write one or two sentences coherently. This is just really embarrasing. 
---
&gt; So the front page links to the same graph you linked, weird two things show the same thing. 
---
Uh no it doesn't, lmao. Look at the url, are you really that dumb that you can't even click a link?
---
Let's look at some of your completely borderline mentally impaired statements so far:
---
"95th percentile is the average"
---
"mages are difficult to play"
---
"hunters are easy and mage is harder"
---
Mages are the easiest class in the game as is universally agreed upon, while hunters actually require thinking and are inifnitely harder than mage. Seeing as they have a rotation based on weaving they are in fact one of the hardest class to play.
---
Also, why would a top guild take 5 hunters in this phase lol (even though some do)? If you need physical dps, you get a warrior dps who can do 1k+ dps as is shown on the same link i shared. Mages are taking because its either them or lock/spriest for spell damage and seeing as there are trashmobs and some mobs where AOE is required mages will take precedence over the other 2. The fact you didn't know that warrior dps is top is just really embarrasing as well and the fact that mages and hunters DON'T DO the same type of damage is even more embarrassing.
---
Honestly, the fact that the best logging site in the world puts hunter top 3 dps on their frontpage is all that is needed to be said. Keep enjoying spamming frostbolt for 2 hours straight while living in your delusions, mister uneducated.
---
What you are doing is ok i'd drop shadow bolt though, you'll find the VW eventually struggles to hold aggro even with the improved talents. Some switch to other pets but I still found it held long enough to make a difference and allowed me to multi pull easier and safer vs killing 1 at a time faster with succ.
---
Tanking moltern core before level 60? NTY
---
Yeah fuck us for being excited for PvP to be an actual thing, what the hell are we thinking!?
---
Just because certain choke points will be laggy doesn't mean that every PvP fight will be unplayable....get over yourself.
---
Oh yea if you dont have goals you're there for life. I haven't got to brd level yet but you better believe I'm doing a full run when I get there. Then I'm gunna spend 12 years solo farming angerforge for HoJ (y)
---
as snoop mentioned invisibility is different, but you can still have the strongest stealth detection as a Humlock. Perception + fel hunter's paranoia.
---
For real. What a dumbass comment
---
&gt; people know it's coming, and some are stockpiling mats already
---
there was a q&amp;a where a dev said the original war effort was designed as a huge gold sink, and the amounts of each turn in were determined on a server-by-server basis. they know how big the stockpiles are and how big the populations are and roughly how fast they can farm everything.
---
Sounds fine. You can handle harder two-pulls at that level also by dotting one, pulling way back, putting void on the other while fearing the first. Void off-tank. Dot the other, reapply fears as necessary. Later on you get AoE fear and death coil. And they both help you take a few more enemies at once.
---
It was able to....
---
**ON PRIVATE SERVERS.**
---
I am a level 60 priest with something like +350 healing at this point... should I really be using Rank 1 of everything?  It feels like I'm barely doing anything then.  I was downranking a little bit, but to like Rank 4 FH and rank 3 of everything else.
---
I mean you're a shadow priest, that's worse than ret pally.  I think it's the worst in the game.
---
Shadow priests were good at all until TBC with Mana battery.
---
haha... ;)
---
Tauren are good for Nax when that extra health will make a big difference. 
---
Orcs are really good if you can stick to using axes for that skill bonus.
---
If you don’t care about min/maxing and having to farm a little harder for gear, play whatever you want.
---
Everybody falls for it once. That's why it catches on.
---
There's some addons to make it a little more convenient too. Did I Do It will show the entire chain when you give one quest id. Makes it easy to find a quest you want to do online and find out where you left off or if you even started the chain.
---
I tank everything outside of MC and Onyxia as Moonglow resto. Your spec doesn’t matter, your gear does. Same in PVP.
---
drop the frost trap. The one that makes an area slow and kite them around in it. Hunters excel at area denial. Conc shot, scatter shot and if they do charge/intercept pop macro to fd and drop frost trap again. If you can cc them you win
---
You stop leveling in wailing caverns?
---
Did you not see the picture I posted? The event takes zero effort and maybe 2 minutes at most yet people in the group make it sound like I'm asking for some impossible boss that takes dozens of extra groups of enemies to get to. The reality is that it's very quick and easy.
---
Before classic came out I had never seen people spamming ‘care!’ Assumed it was people whose first language isn’t English and they’re saying they instead of ‘be careful’?
---
So ability usage is throttled for three reasons:
---
1) On retail, PvP damage is nuts. People drop dead in seconds unless they're constantly healed. (Healing is not throttled) Which leads to-
---
2) The focus of these battles is RPPvP rather than just PvP. People mashing abilities like crazy doesn't leave much room for actual RP. Especially since on retail we now have a potion that lets us talk and emote to the other faction in /s and /e. People prefer to focus on the RP element. Throttled abilities means people can type more than mash abilities.
---
3) Lag, especially these days. The server buckles just with auto attacks and a few spells, whenever we go all out it just brings the region server down and causes a rollback. So even if we ant to go all out, we can't in large groups.
---
Healing is unrestricted, but damaging abilities are limited to once every five or so seconds for the above reasons. AoE is also generally not permitted. Nor any CC, from stuns to interrupts. Casters generally sit behind melee, with one spell per five seconds. Certain super hard hitting abilities like Chaos Bolt or Greater Pyroblast are also a no no.
---
Now personally I'm not a huge fan of this. The end result is a stale fight where each side fights in a bunch or row in the same spot for two hours. RPPvP is a weird beast, where people will claim they're focused on RP, but at the same time their characters never fatigue, or give up ground, or retreat UNLESS their HP hits 0 in game mechanics. Which never happens unless either they stop being healed, or someone "cheats" and bursts them down. Which is a bit :thinking: when that's more PvP than RP, to never back off until game mechanics makes you drop.
---
Also you get shit like mongoloids heroic leaping into the middle of the enemy army and surviving a 1v40 because they're prot specced, they're not allowed to be bursted, and usually their healers don't notice and are just topping bars. (Speaking of, healers barely get to RP which is another reason it kinda sucks. A friend who got jumped by a rogue, then RP'd being too injured to keep healing others, and got blasted both In and Out of Character by his own side for "failing his duties" lmao).
---
Fortunately this is less of an issue more recently as there tends to be an agreement that Being Massively Outnumbered and Surrounded = Burst to death to discourage this sort of shit. But it still happens occasionally. Or you have people ignoring the melee up front and just running through them to punch the casters and healers.
---
The only time a fight ever seems to progress is when enough people "cheat" without being noticed or called out on it, causing people to die, meaning the battle line actually manages to move. I find the battles a bore lately, the battles stagnate fast and go on forever, raid chat is just HE CHEATED HE USED CHAOS BOLT HE STUNNED ME HE BURSTED ME REEEEEE (I had a guy bitch to an organiser because I used Disarm on him of all things), and the /s and /e channels are scrolling at light speed so it's very difficult to have any interaction with your own or the enemy side.
---
Frankly I think any CC that doesn't displace your character (Fears and knockbacks) should be allowed, at the very least. I remember for a time even slows weren't allowed, which meant frost mages were basically flat banned from campaigns unless they used Ice Lance and NOTHING ELSE which of course made for an even more boring battle. That was changed after much, justified, complaining.
---
And that's not getting into the constant arguments of who won what fight, who ignored which side's defences/walls/traps/turrets/mines/magic wards, who ganked who, who kept cheating, which team has more campaign score, whether the organisers are showing factian bias (in 99% of cases they are, I remember a time where Horde mounted a stealth mission to steal Alliance supplies and failed, Alliance mages from the safety of their base just fucking teleported ours out) and blah blah blah. I stopped going to them early in BfA tbh, just constant bitching and drama.
---
But the campaigns certainly started having significant lag issues after WoD, I know that much. But on the upside I do have a lot of juicy RPPvP stories as a result... mostly because of OOC drama rather than anything IC.
---
I would recommend warrior, they have more options while tanking and they do better damage is you decide to dps.
---
Paladins use a lot of smaller faster heals and are usually the tank healers so their crits are usually not overhealing.
---
Assholes certainly exist, I haven't noticed them to be in huge quantities but they're definitely out there.  The very nature of the game tends to attract a lot of antisocial types.
---
My only advice would be to look for a guild that doesn't promote toxicity.  You'll have more leverage and run into less assholery when you do runs with your own guild.
---
I doubt it, the queue size shouldn't be for the capacity of players in a layer but rather the capacity of their servers.
---
The only demon skills I upgraded throughout leveling was the taunts, yet it still felt like a waste in later levels. My kill times always felt way too slow when I was waiting for the void to build threat. Once I got higher levels it was more efficient to just nuke since my crit chance felt pretty good. Cycling between drain life and healthstones whenever low from life taps.
---
When it comes to mana I think I’ve only needed to buy maybe 6 stacks of water total from lvl 1-60 since I come across kind mages so often, so refreshments were never an issue.
---
Outlasting opponents is a niche taste, but it definitely appeals to some.
---
chest despawns in 15 ish right?
---
Hooking up with "nerdy" guys AKA mega Chads that play videogames.
---
Does your keyboard have macro features? We've seen before people say they were doing nothing but then say they use a keyboard that comes with macro software which can be against TOS.
---
I've yet to see one of these posts where it really is for nothing, it usually comes down to some application (even if you were not using it to cheat) being flagged.
---
You also may have just been banned for using teamveiwer, i've seen others afew years back talk about bans for rdp and programs that would essentially mask the IP you are actually at.
---
&gt;And this is just for RPPvP which is mostly autoattacks or one ability every five seconds with some emotes and dialogue.
---
I'm super new to Wow so this sentence makes me giggle so hard my sides hurt. Is this really how an RP server would handle a big raid? Just 200+ people all RPing and voicing/emoting out their own story arcs?
---
Yeah. I'm actually after for the xp and gear. Would need the good water too. Thank you for this!
---
Giving DM in a phase 1.5 is a lot different than moving things from phase 5 to phase 2.5
---
So even on great hardware, pvp is basically just mages spamming aoe? 
---
Cool.
---
I spent all my time in classic for 2 months. I didn't play classic for 2-3 weeks and I feel great. Classic is fun experience but I would rather play other games than grind/farm after lvl 60. ( I cleared every dungeon, gite my prebis, cleared mc and ony multiple times).
---
Good luck in your journey, for the first time it's hella fun.
---
It's about intent.. if you are farming and they intent to do it to harass you.. they are in the wrong. If they come to farm, and the fearing etc is a means to harrass them into leaving, then they are in the wrong as Blizzard sees it and that's when they start issuing bans.
---
Why though? It's one out of jail card. 
---
In this video by APES [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fd97o-gEBuk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fd97o-gEBuk), it was a decision to NOT pop against the first 40 men raid, because they wouldve been wiped by the next raid without them.
---
Same with worldbosses if the lag wouldnt destroy the fights. If the fight rages for 6 hours and you can only pop one every 5 minutes, it needs conscious decision making by the lead when to pop them. It's not a braindead item you can throw in every minute like iron nades.
---
As someone that started later in Vanilla, and is already tired of everyone being so focused on BiS, etc, I'd rather just have the final version of the game already. Let the hardcore players burn through it, that's what they want to do anyway.
---
I'd like to be able to break from quests and dungeons to do some BGs. I'd like to have AV and the quests waiting for me at 51. I'd like all the gear sets in the game for collection. So on and so on.
---
I'm actually thinking I might just unsub until a much later phase.
---
That sounds like a casual talking.
---
I bet Stonetalon Mountains are 0.0. in some blizzard coordinate system. Just like [Null Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Island) south of Ghana.
---
Just chiming in with others to confirm that you're wrong. It doesn't need to be Drain Soul that gets the killing blow, just damage from you.
---
You can post all of the old patch notes that you want, but this is how it currently works in Classic.
---
Can I play on Grobb as a EU player?
---
I loved this one. People would whisper me so angry.
---
It was always fun to do this in the middle of the Ironforge AH and just wait. 
---
You'd always get someone.
---
I don't ever wait for void to build threat. Immolate, corruption, agony. Start wanding. Halfway through the mob will aggro from Void to me. That's fine. Mob dies very soon after.
---
I'm only 34 so maybe it gets worse but it seems fine for now.
---
I think this is probably it. To do the type of sharding they do there essentially has to be a cluster head to move all the information back and forth between the virtual machines/containers. That cluster head type system probably isnt handling shit loads of people in one place correctly since it wasnt designed for having that many actions come from one VM. The architecture probably needs to be tweaked for this type of load. Throwing beefier hardware might help a little, but considering how far tech has come since 2007 (Dell 2950s anyone?) its pretty evident to me that its not a beef problem.
---
DM:E jump runs are the healer go-to cash grind. Grab mining and find a tank willing to split the thorium nodes at the end with you.
---
Rogues share a lot of gear with fury warriors, who just do more damage and have the option of tanking. 
---
I would try mage or hunter if you’re feeling a bit disenchanted by the class.
---
Just got the formula: Enchant Gloves - Riding Skill out of an lockbox. Any thoughts on whether to sell this thing or to use it and sell enchants? Thanks in advance!
---
I play druid and it’s really tough being indecisive. I never know what gear to chase and have wasted tons of gold to respec. I just save gear for every spec.
---
As said I'm certain it's been like this since sharding was added. When a zone doesn't shared (IE on Classic or RP realms on retail) the lag gets insane if more than a single raid are in one spot. it was like this in Legion and WoD.
---
You need to focus on Drain Life leveling/questing.   Play with your Voidwalker out and let him tank your quest mobs.   Set your pet attack and return to your mouse wheel up/down.   As you DoT the mob and drain life, send the Voidwalker to the next mob when the current one is about to die.   It's all about uptime and speed when you're leveling as a Warlock.   You will have many abilities to keep you alive and sustain that uptime -- you just gotta use 'em!   
---
Level 60 Warlock - Rattlegore Horde - IGN:  Longinus
---
Okay so like warlock dotting they guy and pulling would have been fine by me. But he would be on the other side of the farm (first time) and then once I ice barrier and mount up I’d see him start waking towards me. He’d have 1-2 mobs on him. As he was a lock and then I’d grab my 6-8 undeads and then I’d see fire about to land. So I’d drop a quick rank one arcane. To tag em. This was the kill stealing he was trying to do. Multiple times. Each time I’d just let him get Agro and die. Then he went a different rout. Would wait until I pull. He’d then wait until I froze and blinked and the mount up and run 5-6 mobs through my blizzard. 
---
Other person targeting me. Not for the mobs I was killing but because I was pulling more than 3. He wasn’t there for the one quest in the area that has no killing needed to it. He and his 2 other friends were doing the scarlet quest to talk to their leader and bring him back to his dad. I’d pull then freeze them. I’d then start to aoe and he would come in and fear. I asked him kindly not to. He then did it again after I cold snapped to be able to regain control. He then feared a 3rd time and as they were beating me to death “yes die you piece of shit” came out of his mouth. Then came back and said “don’t make me do it again. You better not pull more than 2” and stood there while I afkd him away. 
---
I of course am in a grind spot. There were other mages there too. There were alliance mages there doing the same thing. But instead of killing the alliance mages targeted me.
---
Xaryu has a good video. It's mage perspective but he goes over the matchup as a whole and what he's thinking that the rogue will be doing
---
The point is to get more pics off crippling so you are providing utility instead
---
I dont know if you've already rolled or not. But please consider Incendius Alliance. EST PVP server and also pretty even. Great experience so far.
---
I am so glad I left Stalagg
---
Idk, I see the intent for both to tag as many mobs as possible. Mage gets to take 14/15 of a camp unless I do something.
---
Yes you should learn it it helps a lot. It does take a lot of practicing to get it right though. Just charge in and hamstring right away. Try it on different mobs it works better on the slow ones. Some mobs depending on your hamstring level won't work nearly as well. And get a weapon swing timer.
---
It makes leveling a warrior actually enjoyable if you can get it right. Just need to learn how the leeway works. Most important thing is moving in so that your weapon swing doesn't reset.
---
Yea but QUT.
---
UQ plz.
---
Agree. They are, in fact, pretty involved with the community and care about these issues a lot. Not because they care about you, of course, but because of your money. It's a big company after all.
---
Lol, I don't out dps them all, just a few. But yeah I need a new MH for raiding. My point is that daggers are totally viable even without total pre-BiS/BiS.
---
thanks a lot
---
Blizzard hear ye. Blizzard don't care.
---
This is pretty detailed. Will make sure to remember this on my first run. Thanks for this man! Do you think I should just wait till 60? I actually just hit 59 early this morning.
---
It does work you just need to practice.
---
Notice how you listed exploits as your example, whereas pulling mobs into you isn't an exploit whatsoever.
---
Show me where in the blizz ToS that pulling mobs into someone is considered griefing. It OBVIOUSLY isn't, you're just whinging about having to interact with other players in an MMO.
---
&gt; &gt; Deep Blue-level supercomputer
---
&gt; Well, I know you have no experience in the industry. What a joke of a post.
---
Someone doesn't understand sarcasm and hyperbole.
---
So what you are saying is the D2 was perfectly balanced?  Laughable.  And if you think they perfectly simulated every possibility to get their so-called perfect balance, you are wrong.  They made estimations and guesses and happened to get it as close as they could.
---
Twitch app makes it insanely simple, go for that!
---
What?? Why do these rogues feeling like they are entitled to lockboxes?
---
It’s absolutely a good reason to hold content back, if I’m playing 2-3 hours a night most nights and more on weekends and still largely behind on content, why should I bother continuing my subscription?
---
As a teen I missed out on end game content for various reasons, as an adult I’m interested in seeing that content finally.
---
This isn’t t to say I expect a release schedule to meet my needs, but most of the casual crowd isn’t on reddit, but they are important base of the game.
---
There has to be a balance between content release needs of no lifers and filthy casuals.
---
She goes to QUT so no
---
Haha, let's look at the BEST PERFORMING MAGE in the FASTEST raid so far, in the world:

https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/BMLYJPbcaf2q7x6N#boss=-2&amp;difficulty=0&amp;wipes=2&amp;type=damage-done&amp;source=17
---
Oh so difficult man, spamming frostbolt for nearly all your damage. And secondary and third spell damage coming from instant AOE spellcasts that a literal primate could do.
---
There is absolutely NOTHING but NOTHING difficult about mage, it's by far the easiest class in the game. This isn't even an discussion, you're literally arguing against the universal consensus.
---
Hunters are infinitely more difficult than mage and at the highest tier are some of the most difficult class to play. This is also universally agreed upon. No discussion there as well.
---
And I'm saying this as a mage, but thankfully my brain isn't defect like yours. You're a mage who is probably very upset with the fact that you have to spam the same button over and over.
---
&gt; You pulled this out of your ass, just like your misuse of statistics. 
---
Lol, 'misuse of statistics', aka link to the most general form of presenting viable and significant statistics from the the best logging site in the world.
---
Keep projecting uneducated boy.
---
And again, mages don't do more dps than hunter. Hunter outperform and outdps mages, here I'll share the relevant data again:
---
August 06? Lol. That's barely vanilla. Foh know-it-all
---
How you 30/0/21 shamans liking life at 60 so far?
---
I hope so. WSG wouldn't throw anything too out of whack, other than making it easier for more people to rank up. AV however, adds a bunch of new purples you can get in a single weekend so that one should probably wait for P3 because it would be a vastly larger game-wide power upgrade.
---
While I considered rogue/druid for stealth runs, it's alot of fun doing it as a druid duo instead. With 2x tanks/dps/healers that can rotate roles based on mana availability, and 2x innervates, there's a whole lot of potential to pull off long boss fights.
---
I play WoW with my fiancee and it's great. We don't play together all the time, we have our own separate classic and retail mains that do their own things. 
---
But we have a handful of characters that we rolled together and do M+ together when I have a low enough key for us both to do. It's great, lets us spend time doing something together we both enjoy
---
You’ll see people mention it negatively, but they don’t drop group over it.
---
This might actually happen lol
---
Default can do that, other than that Luna is nice
---
It really only matters for the power levelers.  Small changes to talent order can shave hours from your leveling in the long run.
---
Kinda?
---
In a dedicated RPPvP event yes. Characters will interact with one another like, well, characters. And with the new x-fac language potion more recently rivalries and sworn enemies are made on the battlefield.
---
In a Battleground, Arena or WPvP area, no. We play the game normally in those cases. Whether or not we RP stuff out depends on context, time and location. 
---
Contrary to popular belief we don't RP our way through raiding, PvPing or questing. We usually go to a hub, campaign location or guild hangout for it. If an enemy faction raid formed and stormed a city for example, we'd either ignore them (The default) and pretend they aren't there, or we break character to PvP their butts then go back to what we were doing as though nothing happened.
---
Idk i dont watch streams
---
Kite them...  Stay close enough so they can't intercept but stay far enough for you to range attack them.
---
Well, i think you are misrepresenting what i said by a fair bit. Making something more user friendly is not the same as making your choices not matter.
---
A lot of the talents are just strait forward stat increases, that you need to go through anyway to get build relevant talents. Sometimes there isn't even a choice. That's the part that I meant with fake.
---
I could easily come up with my own builds. I could also write a simulation to optimise them. I am just not willing to invest the time to do it. I already have to calculate and simulate more complex stuff at work. So I prefer to do simpler stuff off work. I guess my brain needs to rest sometimes.
---
The talent system was also only one of the reasons I quit. The biggest was probably the sluggish controls. The game just felt terrible compared to Diablo 3. I haven't tried it in a while, so that might have been improved.
---
Edit: One thing I forgot. I didn't use a guide. The game just looked like I would need to use one, if I don't want to spend a lot of time theory crafting before actually playing the game.
---
No most players aren’t still trying to hit 60. There’s a lot of level 60s and a lot of guilds have MC on farm. Not just private server try hards.
---
I am very suprised someone knows Minion but mit twitch/curse :D
---
Oh I’m sure. They’re all solid chests but greens are rare.
---
That’s a trap
---
If you see someone on your server with it equipped ask if they bought it and for what price.
---
It's the best BoE one-handed sword in the game. I'd start astronomically high and work my way down if you're selling. 
---
If you're buying, spam city chat or whisper someone who is selling it there. I doubt that anyone would list it in the AH if not to advertise that they have it. Just start a conversation and see if your budget matches his price and if it doesnt, try to work your way down. If the seller is in a hurry they will contact you later on and see if you would be interested in a lower price.
---
Theres probably so few of these in existence that people either equip it or sell it to the person on their server with the most gold. Sorry for the non-answer.
---
the classic.wowhead guides are pretty comprehensive. 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/scholomance-classic-dungeon-strategy
---
This is so hyperbolic
---
Once I got more damage my void will literally lose aggro after I throw the second dot on. Maybe I should’ve waited longer but I’m too impatient.
---
I’m usually able to stand at max range and get 2 shadow bolts off before the mob can get in melee range of me, which by that point it’s already at 60% or less.
---
If you have 3 layers, theoretically you can expect 3X the wait times.
---
Next Tuesday will be a shtshow for high pop servers.  Rushed Phase II is coming out, its a raid night, removal of all layering.  Looooong queues to ensue.
---
If a mob turns big and red its getting a kidney shot. Doesn't matter if it's only a 2-pointer, that can give enough time for the group as a whole to burst it down and conserve a lot of the healer's mana. That's also if everything is going as smoothly as possible too; in a worst-case-scenario that kidney shot can mitigate domino effect wipes. 
---
Once you get to a certain point, your combo point dps doesn't really make a gigantic impact. You'll wind up doing decent damage no matter what, so you may as well make the entire run faster.
---
Priest are fun - Mana Burn, Fear, Shield, Mind Control and more
---
Full out war every time.
---
and if not possible im just boned? thinking about respeccing out of trueshot just so i can have counterattack
---
I've never done any of that, but like many others are saying--a lot of mages I've run into are dicks (at least out in the world, not in dungeons). I will tell you that every time I see AoE farming mages it irks me a little inside because I've tried grouping with some while they're killing quest mobs, and they NEVER group. Like I would be grouped with you for all of 3-5 min and I'm gone. It seems like they've all watched this min/max how to level videos and don't want their exp/hour tainted by helping someone out.
---
This I dont quiet understand.  They probably brought back layering then (i.e. no way there was suddenly a mass transfer off your server).  
---
This coming Tuesday will be very telling for the pops of the servers.
---
&gt; but the real fun was fighting the other twinks and understanding what combos/abilities you can use as well as what the enemy can use due to the skills/talents/gear being so much more limited.
---
Twinkers always tell this lie. But when they got put in segregated battlegrounds where they could have "the real fun" 100% of the time they all logged off and never came back like the seal-clubbing, lying cowards they were.
---
&gt; people have the most fun against other twinks
---
No they don't. They want to grief levellers and newbies so they can pretend they are good at PvP.
---
cutting corners, saving bucks and it will come bite their butts.
---
If you don’t have rare ench patterns, it’s not the greatest at making money. Have to get lucky disenchants. I’d suggest taking a gathering prof instead. Tailoring is ok for mooncloth cd, passive 15-20g every 3 days is good enough to keep it.
---
My main is a rogue. I leveled him mostly by questing because the first few weeks everyone was aoeing dungeons in a raid and no one wanted a rogue. Finding and making groups to piece together my pre-bis, taking forever to form as I had to pull teeth to get people to run with a rogue. 
---
And for the attitude of others as you describe is why I make an effort to not gank other rogues in the world, especially those leveling up still. I probably won't be afforded the same courtesy, but I like to imagine that we're rogues of a secret order first, and faction members second.
---
Us yellows have to stick together.
---
&gt; It doesn't need to be Drain Soul that gets the killing blow, just damage from you.
---
Nope. Unless something changed in the last few weeks, it needs to be Drain Soul that kills the mob. Otherwise you don't get the buff.
---
If you follow the link, there are comments from people in classic and vanilla that confirm it.
---
Once again, the killing blow needs to come from drain soul. Nothing else will proc the buff. This is how it works IN CLASSIC.
---
Looks like eHEROES won in this turn based game.
---
Fair enough.  I'm not saying it is great -- I've never played mage, don't have a strong opinion on it.
---
I was just saying that "If you're getting hit 50 times by a rogue for the ring to proc, you're probably already dead" does not accurately reflect how a 2% proc rate works.
---
Damn sometimes you forget how far in the past 2006/2007 was.
---
Literally what? What did I say that was pathetic?
---
&gt;That being said, I'd probably ignore someone who was whispering me begging for money because that fuck probably already got gold from a few other people.
---
I'm supporting giving bags to noobs, and against this whole starting with bags "isn't trying out classic"
---
Which is the first time honor is calculated.  I think that is pretty cool they are pretty much sticking to the unspoken belief of 3 months per phase.
---
I'm confused why people want these level 19 weapons, in vanilla WoW wasn't the first BG bracket 21-30?
---
&gt; Exactly, running around as a twink 19 in WSG you feel like an elite compared to the people who queue while they are leveling.
---
"...and if it feels *good* to me, how can it be wrong? I mean, it's logically impossible that I could be having fun while spoiling the game for everyone else, right? If it's fun for me it must be good, end of story."
---
Can you stop hosting classic servers on mobile phones, Blizzard, please? Thanks in advance, your paying customers.
---
I'm a priest, not a hunter.  I have zero idea of the actual break down.  Is it 1 for 1, 3 for 1, 10 for 1, I don't know.  I do know from my dabbling that bite equals claw in damage parses.  I was attempting to give a basic breakdown of why, from my limited knowledge.  And not just tailoring the information to any fight or play style in general.
---
I don't know if the raid group is crazy for demanding bite over claw or if it's a legitimate difference.  If there was zero difference, then there would be no need to say which skills.  If there is a minor difference that builds up, it's worth examining.
---
Is there a site that tracks this data, per sever?
---
Wow I feel like the only one here who gives people gold. It's a cooperative game, and it's not like I need the cash more than they do. It's a tiny inconvenience to me but it could be a huge help to them, the utility calculation seems easy.
---
That's pretty handy actually. Sometimes I wonder why tf my tank won't snag a mob, and knowing that taunt resisted on the fly can help decide if I need to vanish or CC/kite
---
That's where I have issue. If I'm farming somewhere and a mage comes and uses their abilities to make it impossible for me to farm then I'm fearing their mobs. I was here first and I'm not taking all the mobs. If you come in and take them all for yourself then I'm fighting back to keep my spot. If I'm banned for that then so be it, that's be frustrating enough to make me walk away from classic. It just isn't right that one class gets priority and is backed up by bans.
---
Plus how do you even prove intent on the mage? He could be intentionally griefing you by taking the mobs you've been farming and it just looks like he's farming himself. If I move on to another camp and he follows it still appears that he's farming.
---
I’m new to wow. For real a huge group of horde can just run into alliance city and cause mayhem!? I need to go find something like that on YouTube that sounds wild
---
No probs. Doable at your level, but might be hard to find group as many want as smooth sailing as possible, meaning lvl 60s. Give it a shot though!
---
No stat bonuses on Shadowfang. Assassin's Blade will probably do about the same damage, or even more with a +3 str and +4 agi on a rogue. I'm not about to sit here and do the math, though.
---
Maybe they have internal metrics that lead them to do this phase at this time.  Maybe they do not know better than you.  If only the census addon worked and the public could see how levels are in classic.  I know I can search the 70-110 players that currently log into my modern server during tuesday, thursday and friday prime time.  i see about 60% are 120 and 40% are leveling still.
---
Dis you mean : RNJESUS?
---
If a twink plays against anything other than a twink, they are at a massive advantage.  The brackets will not mostly be twink v twink.  It will be 1-5 twinks vs everyone else.
---
But who pays attention to chat or chat bubbles during a fight? Personally I’m not ADD enough to pay attention to that on top of everything else.
---
From what I understand, it's a DPS loss if used on a stationary target that won't die before your next frostbolt can go off.  
---
You should only use fire last while you are moving, or on a target that's about to die.
---
There are some goodies in ZF for sure. I always hated mara so Idk if there is anything good there. You'll get a great staff, gloves and shadow priest hat from ZF. Those SM cath items will stay with you for quite a bit tho. There is some great stuff you'll wanna get from Uldaman too.
---
Once you get to around 53 you wanna start doing the first phase of brd, you'll start getting best in slot. Do the arena and some of the lower level bosses. 
---
To be honest the mid 40s up to low 50s was the most awkward time for me. I just did tons of ZF runs and grinded through those levels asap.
---
And I over here have 2 60s (warr/rogue)
---
Well fuck me sideways that happened to me twice around the same spot the last two times i was in LBRS and i just thought it was from the fucked up pathing that came with the Dire Maul patch
---
That weapon is too fast. Everything less than 3 seconds will meds up your rotation. Steady shot has a 3 second cast and in that time your character wont auto attack so you are delaying your auto attack every time you cast steady shot. You will always want slower weapons than 3s. Lnly exception is rohkdhelar because its just too good compared to everything else currently in the game
---
Wait till he's at ~10% hp before kamikaze attacking him with the rest of the cool melee and see who lives
---
Why would an AoE Spellcleave group take a rogue?
---
I think you figured it out already but didn't see anyone tell you that A Crumpled Note is a random drop in BRD, so you just have to kill things until it drops. It dropped really quickly in classic for us.  Dropped much slower in vanilla, but its random so keep at it.
---
My semi casual guild went from 8/10 attempt 1 in MC to downing rag and ony all in one night by the third attempt. No one wants to be in this easy content for like 8 months. Idk why people are complaining. Slow down later content not this.
---
I think they need to redo the entire hardware and network they have for the classic servers.  There is too much bandwidth for their cloud server solutions to support open world raid bosses and world pvp.  All the data is getting lost and people are freezing and characters stop responding.  Also, we are learning that the "entire world layer" is in fact a lie because even on unlayered servers there are segmented areas of the world that you can watch people warp around.  Places like BRM, Major cities, and other zone boundaries.  They are like sharded experiences in non layered servers.  Open a trade window with someone and try to jointly walk out of a city to see what I am talking about.
---
you all have cell phones right?
---
Yeah I definitely won't be using it to look up people I have in pugs, more to share my gear with friends.
---
Why would rank 1 be better than max rank, even if just for the slow?  Wouldn't they apply slow at the same time, so might as well do damage too?
---
Except of course that isn't how it works out.  Roller coasters are more fun because you are no longer standing in a two hour line.  And talent trees are more rewarding when you finally manage to progress up to that one talent that you really wanted. 
---
PoE's talent tree is a perfect example of it.  There are really only a few dozen very strong points to spend in the tree, but the journey to those points is filled with small but meaningful decisions.  A little bit of survivability here, a little damage here, a little stat boost so I can use this new piece of gear of here.  
---
Every level you get to make a small choice, that gets you closer to the thing you really want.  It is great design. It is engaging and interesting. 
---
Getting one talent choice to make every 10 levels is boring as fuck. Made worse by the fact that you want to change it constantly from situation to situation, from boss fight to boss fight.
---
or get herbalism and grab some of the herbs in there.
---
Pickpocketing is incredibly beneficial, you get silver, lockboxes, vendor trash, potions, food AND it forces you have enough of a delay that the tank can build there's before you unload. 
---
Lockpicking allows you to open doors, rare chests, and lock boxes.
---
You should absolutely should level both. The provide utility and make you money.
---
Id say its around 3-4g from vendoring items. Takes around 20mins for a run upto the worg room.
---
I’ve averaged around 1 blue every 4-5 runs. 
---
The problem is that beside the Shadowfang and Assassina Blade, the items are hardly worth anything. 
---
So if you get 5 blues and its other ones, then youre not getting more than 12ish gold per hour.
---
Which isnt a lot, but at least its low effort.
---
I was in the same situation as you. Needed Truestrike shoulders, so did a couple guildies. So we made a 5man group. It is a cake walk, takes about 15\~ mins per run, so you don't have to worry about lockouts. 
---
One thing I did notice, which was mental, is the amount of 16 slot bags that dropped. In 14 runs, we had 5 Pumpkin Bags and 2 Traveler backpacks drop. We also got 3 Truestrike shoulders. And with all the green items that drop, its not terrible gold per hour. About 20g/hr each. So it's not even a waste of time for people who don't need anything. Any time Jed spawned during our runs, we would go and grab him too, easy peasy, and even sold a couple kills to people waiting outside.
---
Like everything in this game, with a few buds, or a decent guild, anything is possible.
---
So the example I used is from hirumaredx’s video about how he argued with a GM and won. 
---
It would be arguable that in a game where you can’t kill people on the same faction as you that purposely using game mechanics to kills someone on the same faction as you would fall under an exploit. Along with the reason why the inn isn’t an exploit is because it can be repeated and other ranged can just attack back saving you from being camped. 
---
The only way for me to retaliate is to grief back. Which doesn’t ever work for me. Because it’s how I lost my original account back in 2005. A warrior kept taking my tin nodes in hillsbrad as a bear or cougar would attack. So when I later saw him trying to mine I’d pull packs of mobs to him and vanish as they got agro on him. 
---
And I’m not talking about people running from their mobs running past me trying to get away and I get the leash. I’m talking about people in 
---
/say verbally harassing me telling me they’ll continue to do so as long as I’m aoe farming.
---
Server almost crashed when we dropped an ony head last night..
---
Wow. Dumbest thing i ever heard.
---
You can solo kill princess as any spec. With herbalism, you can easily get 30g+ an hour
---
I guess killing anyone in world pvp is wrong, yea? Its always an inconvenience to be killed in WPVP.  How dare we inflict that on another human?
---
Yeah so I don't think he should be greifing you, but look from his side and he has mages running in all throughout his leveling process and taking all the mobs causing him to have to wait for respawns or move. You can't really complain too much, mages have been a massive pain in the ass with how popular AOE farming has become.
---
I had this same conversation with someone else on this same thread. I'm not the one making any decisions lol I'm just stating reasons why it may not work or get fixed as easily as you and the other guy seem to think.
---
Nice job at saying at snarky comment at the very end of both of your statements in an attempt to belittle someone making a legitimate statement that you don't agree with.
---
You didn’t read anything he said.
---
I wonder how good treant's bane is for an orc warrior. Its a fast 2h with good stats and crit, could be not bad I think. Also most rage generated for tanking comes from damage taken and not damage done from my experience, is there any evidence contrary to that?
---
30/0/21 lock is solid for raiding but it is focused on hard hitting shadow bolts due to shadow mastery.
---
You and the other people in this thread are delusional - "Hey, Jeff Kaplan - I'm the lead dev, and you're some schlub off the street, but you can go ahead and do what ever you want to the game, including removing classes, specs, items, lvl 70 end-game dungeons such as karazhan and Stormwind Prison, it's cool bro. I don't mind".
---
You're absolutely delusional if you think that's how it went down.
---
I mean, I _just_ got through telling you that it's Jeff's job to lie to you. I don't want to go over this anymore. There are dozens of vids discussing how vanilla wow was fucked up and scuffed by design decisions. Jeff admitted he did these things.
---
I'm not sure where else to lead you so you stop spewing blizz propaganda.
---
Honestly, I'm glad you posted this as I was considering the exact same shit with black dragonscale and devimsaur combo. But I was told it wasn't Bis and to not waste my money
---
You're so fucking hilarious.
---
Thanks for entertaining me at work. I've yet to see a Warcraft log to back up your claim? Also, you never did dispute the fact that only 7 percent of hunters make top 15 in their raid while 25 percent of mages do in the top ten guilds worldwide.  Hunters should be higher than mages, if they "top charts" right? 😉
---
Anyways, have a good one mate. Enjoy mediocrity.
---
IT also says it in /rw and /yell /say.
---
preps for other offtanks to pick it up asap if they read that.
---
The craziest thing going back is that WoW vanilla only went from 11/2004 to 1/2007 and Naxx did not come out until 9/2006. So unless you were elite raiding guild you barely even touched Naxx. 
---
Naxx, even though it is forever away is one of the main reasons I was hype for vanilla. Cause my guild only downed like 5 bosses in their before BC.
---
The problem with rogues isn’t that they don’t provide utility, (stuns and LP are both nice to have) but that a lot of the gear you want is in competition with the tank. Warriors and paladins are afraid you are gonna take the weapon or trinket they want, while druids are afraid you will need on the leather gear that they want. What I found that helps me find groups is identifying what gear a tank wants from a dungeon and telling them that I wont need on that particular item. It kinda sucks, but if you’re just trying to do dungeon quests it can help speed up the process of finding a group, and if you can start to make friends with tanks on these runs you could get invited to future runs.
---
Apparently in Paddington.
---
Man I miss this game. Can't wait to finally play it come December.
---
It showed as 1h for me when I replied. And it wasn't the first time I'd seen the thread.
---
So true. I felt like a I was working for a political campaign trying to get votes for some horrid politician lol
---
I don't think you're supposed to be casting shadowbolts unless you're destruction spec. It's less dps than wanding I believe and very mana inefficient.
---
Not sure since I just run affliction/demonology. I almost never shadowbolt.
---
Well I mean if you’re a warlock priest or druid I’ll never complain about asking to group or having you be in the area. 
---
I had a priest with me up until level 42 when he took off for a weekend and I hit 49 without him.
---
But if you’re finishing a quest I’ll always lend a hand. Fuck everytime I run through hillsbrad to get to scholo on my rogue I ask if any warrs need whirlwind dead
---
Appreciate the details. How do you get fr5? I only have 4
---
my server is even worse. anything that isn't pre-bis/raid-bis related sell for less than actual vendor prices. like, you can literally buy them at AH and sell them to vendors for profit. nevermind that for i.e. a bag, you need to buy the thread, so it's a net-loss to even bother crafting them.
---
i've been writing mail to people selling for way below vendor prices and they all say the same "i use auctioneer and don't keep an eye on vendor prices".
---
the problem is auctioneer. no one should use that shit. just get auctionator and vendor price addon.
---
Doesnt give 600-1000+ HP
---
Layering is cancer, the games only this way because they refused to open more servers (the correct approach)
---
Ah, /rw. That would do it. Haven’t raided since WotLK so I’m not familiar with who can talk in /rw and who can’t.
---
Wasn't the drop rate increased in one of the earlier MC itemization patches?
---
Not increased from original vanilla 1.12, but increased from the earlier versions of vanilla like 1.1 etc?
---
Still it's largely luck, they are very rare to drop 3 in a row.
---
Yeah, there is usually a dog there, but not always. Probably not worth the time potentially saved even checking.
---
Blizzard doesn't care about Classic WoW.
---
They aren't willing to spend any money on server performance or code optimization and it clearly shows.
---
A slideshow haha that’s funny
---
I’m fairly certain you are wrong my DOTs would constantly get the finishing blow and I would still get the talent.
---
R a r e
---
No the game isn't being rushed, the content isn't new and is already figured out so it makes sense that it releases slightly faster than it originally was
---
Really depends on how bad you need the three gold.
---
No, we’ve become less computer literate. People use phones more than computers now, and phones have a camera attached.
---
Not true.
---
Honor does not equal rank points.
---
Rank points are assigned based on how your total weekly honor (uncapped) compares with the total honor of all other players on your faction.
---
If you killed one opposite faction player per day giving you 25 honor and zero others on your faction PVPd at all, you would be the number one ranked pvp player on your faction and get the max rank points (13,000) 
---
Do this for 6 weels and you are grand Marshall.
---
The only factor that matters is how much honor you get in a week compared to the rest of your faction on your server.
---
Not really though because he finished the first camp you're moving away from. It appears that he's moving on to the next camp just like you.
---
&gt; This is definitely asshole behavior
---
That's my point. Mages have free pass to be assholes and everyone else just has to take it. They have the ability to tag and down entire camps in the time you can tag and down one or two mobs. If you fight back then you're griefing. And they can be safe from bans if they do it to grief you because you can't prove it unless there's chat.
---
You thought we wouldn’t find out Blizzard! And it only took us 15 years
---
not really, you will get hit from outer space anyway due to melee leeway
---
Okay here you go.

There's the epic wolf mount, 918g. Spent anywhere from 1g 10s to 1g 40s per stack on 420 runecloth so I'll pretend I cheaped out for you, that's 462g. I spent 120g on the devilsaur gloves and 180g on the devilsaur pants. Pants and helmet both have libram of voracity at 50g a pop for 100g total.
---
Scope I have on my gun cost 400g. All other enchants I'd guess 50-100g so I'll be conservative and say 50g. So that's 2,650g worth of stuff on me. Idk why you'd choose to not believe that among anything but yeah, you can make bank off tribute runs. And as you can see I'm clearly poor now.
---
Is all the major cities like this or have the server community just decided to try take down Org?
---
Might help a bit if the playerbase was spread out a little bit.
---
It is nice to see the servers full of life tho :)
---
All the content is there!  There is nothing new to develop.  No shit patches are hitting the server faster.  There is no new testing to be done for a new encounter or talent build.  They never thought back then, "Oh, we need to let the patch breath for a bit because we don't want to overwhelm players."  The forums were lighting a fire under the devs asses for more end game raids, balancing their class and pvp content.
---
If you want to drag your feet, then you can because there isn't anything being taken out of the game for you to lose an experience.  I have a large group of friends that stopped when they hit level ~15 and couldn't join a warsong gultch queue, because that is how they remember the wow experience.  To many, questing and raiding is a background activity to capturing flags and defending the tunnel.  
---
It has been 11 resets.  The best time most people had with a wow expansion in recent years was the 77 day content cycle of Legion.  If you think this is not the best way to pace content, then I call bullshit on you egregiouswow.  The 77 day cycle is the best pacing for any content.  **Just because software development cycle in 2005 was slower than the wow classic phases DOES NOT MEAN IT WAS BETTER BACK IN 2005!**  
---
I bet there probably won't be more than 3 weeks of high warlords and grand marshals before all world pvp/flight path ganking/servers stop responding from 100+ player battles cease and players go into instanced pvp.  That too will be an improvement of the play experience for all players.
---
Your range attack is much longer than their intercept range.
---
No but the shield is massive enough to absorb all of that and if they are full demo spec, they are taking about 30% reduces damage until they sacrifice. So between that, the shield, the instant resummon, then re sacrifice and finally health stone, it makes locks literally one of the hardest and tankiest classes to 1v1 in the world. Mind you the whole time you will have dots on you and/or a fear.
---
No ones going to have an TUF at p3 launch either. Im talking about when the masses hit the exhalted rep.
---
A bit of a different topic but I think this is something you would understand on a deep level. Back in *Wrath of the Lich King*, I had a few coworkers who also played WoW and we're all on the same server. We each work for different departments and do very different things for the company so you would think that most things would be pretty segregated in that respect.
---
But one of the coworkers(whose technology issues started to overlap into my area of expertise) asked me a work-related question while I was preparing for an ICC-25 raid. This sounds uncharacteristic and unreasonable of me, but I nearly lost it. I'm not here to talk about work. I'm here, because I want to **escape** from work into Azeroth. Work is OVER and done with for the day. 
---
It pissed me off more than it should have. And I let her know, in as diplomatic terms that I could muster, to please do not ask about me about work when I am gaming. Gaming is one space, and work is the other space. Please do not cross from one to the other.
---
She backed off, but I think it was after the raid concluded and indeed long after I had cooled off, that she hit me again with the work-related question and that she'd see me tomorrow. *FUCK*.
---
Yeah some other guy in the thread claiming he tanks in moonglow resto spec lmao. When even full feral without threat talents is very noticeable how much less threat you have when you run with geared dps.
---
that he should've taken a screenshot.
---
When leveling Broken Tooth I found LBRS to be the most efficient.
---
Wasn't aware holy priests could solo him but just checked it out on YouTube. Going to try this out until I have the intellect I need for dm:e lasher farms.
---
Haha i feel you. My list also looks badass. The black dragonscale looks dope. Even if it isnt “BIS” necessarily its close and really good
---
That is good to hear, I will give it a try next time, keeping all this in mind. Can I ask what class you are?
---
&gt;d in BG's because most of it is glass canon dps only machines.  
---
&gt;A frost mage with 8 pieces "of the frozen wrath" is high dps and good for speedrunning raids. But without intelect or stamina these people get stomped hard.
---
I mean those going into p3 with rag/ full t1 gear and weapons
---
Why does the way others played the game bother you as long as they follow the rules?
---
So let me get this straight, she played WoW to share time with you, but when it came to dinner and dishes, (i.e., grown up stuff), you felt you weren't given enough personal space? Lol.
---
Also all the gear that dual wield hit stacking is getting the hit from 2h is getting dps from instead. Like dual wield choosing 2% hit or 60ap they take the 2% hit. But 2h can say, I am hit cap I get the 60ap. So yeah, dual wield can get more and more hit to bring it closer to 1 but 2h is instead increasing their damage overall because they dont have to waste as many slots or stat allocations on hit.
---
Oh, you're back. That was fast, can't handle being put in your place like that huh?
---
So far, I provided multiple warcraftlogs that completely destroyed every delusional thought you put forward. Too bad, you can't handle the wellknown facts and have to low-effort troll as a coping mechanism.
---
I play mage, but I will acknowledge that it's horribly boring in raiding (and I'm in a top guild) and 100% the easiest class to play. Like, every mage I had this conversation with will say the same. You on the other hand, play mage and have a severe coping deficiency as a result, you don't want to feel you put all the effort in your toon for nothing and therefore have to make up nonsense. It's ok mate, it's only a game.
---
Make everyone bring gnomish cloaking device, non engineers do not touch boss until P3, easy threat.
---
There is absolutely no reason to think this is a storage latency issue. You are jumping straight into one possible problem when there are many other potential ones that we could speculate about, and many ones we don't even have enough info to speculate on whatsoever.
---
Don’t think he read the post
---
We have one Bonereaver so far..no SR yet
---
Yeah it’s gonna be pretty bad.
---
Org is really the only place people go on horde, where alliance do split it between stormwind and iron forge. 
---
Realistically this is just people waiting for a buff, the rest of org doesn’t look like this at all.
---
There aren't any decent caster glove enchants in p1, so riding skill is popular if you don't care for the profession enchants
---
you should delete or edit all these comments so people dont get the wrong idea, sure the talent is kind of dogshit but it still procs if other things kill the target in patch 1.12
---
I'm amazed they didn't do faction specific transfers. Maybe it's time to allow transfers between high population servers if one side is really unbalanced.
---
I told My GM that I can spec hotw/NS so I can offheal better when needed. He said he doesn't want me in raid if I don't have leader of the pack.
---
Interesting. I'll respec and give it a try when I get home.
---
That's not how it worked when I was leveling, nor was it how it worked in TBC. This change had to have happened in the last 3 weeks or so.
---
That wash the idea from the beginning and what's they said BUT everything points on the fact they they used layers to increase population when classic became much more popular then they though
---
Is there an add on that shows me for example how much atk power or crit rate I'm getting as a warrior from agility?
---
dont listen to this guy he is straight up wrong, imp drain soul procs just like getting a soul shard
---
You can probably find a guild on your current server that is good. I play on a small server. I feel like I know someone everywhere I go and my guild is on discord chillen every night. Would be the same as looking for people here, only without having to reroll
---
I'm catching up on South Park right now! I'm a few seasons behind
---
Staying within that 3ft circle might prove difficult tho..
---
Intercept = 8ft closest range
---
Auto Shot = 5ft closest range
---
I heard that the Realm Royale debacle was caused by the company's president trying to micro manage the game, when the actual people working on the game were taking feedback from the community on how best to proceed. It's unfortunate when that happens, but it's not surprising that it does. Is the game essentially dead at this point?
---
I wish to laugh at alliance because they dont do faction pride
---
This feels like a Retribution Paladin post just a bit more self indulging because Rogues are already a strong dps class
---
You could also say it's storage admin if you want to get super specific about the roles, but one thing we know for certain is that the guy he's responding to has no reason to believe what he said, and probably doesn't know much about the topic at all.
---
Yeah relative to population
---
yeah the game forgets that you invested a soul shard into the demon once you log. just some odd coding basically
---
You can but there’s a few talents in balance tree that you want in order to really crank the kitty dps. Most important is natural shapeshifter for power shifting enables you to do A LOT more dps. 
---
Natural weapons and omen of clarity are a big booster too.
---
This is great wish there were more galleries like this.
---
Agreed, and to add to this, attention seekers often spend a lot of time posting stuff in trade or LFG to try to get a rise out of people. (Especially on the weekends.) In my experience a handful of loudmouths usually aren't representative of the player base as a whole.
---
&gt; it still procs if other things kill the target in patch 1.12
---
It never procced that way in 1.12.
---
I'm not about to change any of my comments either.
---
People have become less tech literate. 
---
Phones are designed to be a super-simple interface.
---
Nono, it was more about getting all kinds of relationship related messages inside the game when the game for me is supposed to be a free-zone kind of thing.
---
Getting texts or a call on my phone about remembering dishes is no problem, its kinda different when those messages pop up ingame if you know what I mean.
---
Is it not okay to steamroll content from 2005 if four or five of your raiders have rank 14 weapons?  Like do you think that one raid team will also have every rank 14 player on the server joining?  That seems like a fair way to give them kuddos to say, allow them to top the damage meters and not need weapons from most of the bosses.  They will still wand the ancillary pieces and set bonuses.  The other 8 classes in the game are proven to not be as extremely gear dependent like a warrior is on his or her weapons.
---
And you spammed getting them on stonespine world chat after
---
Idk, I generally felt the opposite. I love gaming with my SOs and it's often too much work to explain and justify it to non-gamers and a lot of shared activity is lost.
---
I haven't really encountered the lack of space issue on that front, to me lack of space is more relevant to things like living together.
---
I like mad season he teaches a lot about lore and different quest lines for cool items like Quel Serrar
---
*laughs in PVE server* Ahhh, lag free! :D
---
Okay and what do you just sit in zerker stance then entire time
---
Because if you stance swapping
---
You are swimming in rage starvation
---
Damn that would be cool to test
---
No smartphones so everyone knew where print screen was!
---
Ah true I always forget about the 10% more damage.
---
well it needs to be somebody's job if you believe that the storage latency from a SAN has even the slightest chance of being the cause of these problems
---
The 3D to 2D projection could be calculated by the Add-On code before rendering in the 2D UI plane.
---
scatter FD trap after intercept, pray to RNGesus for an aimed shot crit
---
You're missing a picture of her face...
---
Can we upvote this more please
---
Real alphas hang out in TB, the ultimate Capital. Want your reagent vendor be right by AH, mail and bank? Instead of some shady goblin cave foreskin rouges are selling crack too 500km from the center? Yeah TBs your place
---
Tech has become more human literate
---
Had a talk about it, but she didnt understand why. That was back in tbc though, so have both moved on since then. All good., but it was a nice lesson for me that its good to have separate hobbies and respect eachothers free space.
---
this guy can't handle not having tactical mastery i think, 15 years of tanking and doesn't have macros for stance dancing maybe, who the fuck knows, keeps freaking out and refuses to listen to other warriors trying to give tips, like i think the guy straight up doesn't believe in any of our first hand experiences
---
Even reddit seems to disagree with you XD
---
I think that's very likely
---
Strategically taken video AT PRIME TIME ON RESET DAY!! Fucking christ are you people new to this game or something? STFU. It was like this on pservers.. it was like this in wintergrasp in wrath. It was like this in the valley during mop. It was like this in legion during isles.. go play a lower pop server you ungreatful fucks.
---
&gt; You can also fuck your cousin but it’s still pathetic and trashy.
---
Wow that perfectly sums up my feelings. I hate how people justify to themselves ganking greens and grey all the time.
---
staged
---
does anyone know how to get the raid table to be small and compact like in the video??
---
It increases chance to hit and it makes your glancing blows do more damage. So basically makes you do the most damage
---
Speaking as a warrior, you definitely can, but it's not a good match-up for you. Your best chance is to hit the deadzone for intercept. As a hunter you can stay just far enough away from a warrior to keep shooting, but close enough to stop them from intercepting. But unfortunately this is way easier said than done, especially with melee leway on their auto attacks. 
---
You can also try staying way out of his range, as your auto shot range is farther than intercept. But the same issue applies, if you mess up at all they will intercept you or you will end up too far away to hit them.
---
If it's any consolation, it's one of the only match-ups that leans heavily to warriors. Evenly skilled, we lose out to most classes.
---
it's usable out of stealth in vanilla
---
It's too late OP, I know how to do it now &gt;:D MUAHAHAHAHA Thank you for this &lt;3 This is going to make leveling and doing dungeons so much easier.
---
Every time I get ganked while leveling it's a gnome or female human. Female night elf is somewhere close too. Why are dwarf players so chill?
---
Because it's their skill that openes them I guess???. I honestly have no idea why people think that way
---
Yeah that’s to the other faction. That’s easily fixed by not being on a pvp server. I’m talking same side killing.
---
I know it's an unthinkable idea to you guys, but developers often actually care about their games. I know I do. As a company they obviously care about the cash flow, but individual developers do care about their games.
---
Probably a dude
---
Oh we need more of these
---
level 63 boss mobs have 315 defense skill. the difference between their defense and a melee attacker's weapon skill is used to determine the hit table and glancing blow damage penalties. 
---
going from 300 to 304 are tiny jumps in effectiveness. 
---
going from 304 to 305 is a YUUUUGE jump in effectiveness. 
---
going from 305 to 313 are tiny jumps in effectiveness again. 
---
against level 62 or lower mobs, edgemaster's are not the best.
---
Well then the solution is obvious, shut down the servers and focus on Diablo mobile.
---
its all explained in the bug section on the wow forum in classic
---
Continue methodically killing every critter I see -- got it.
---
they do but unless ur willing to put the effort into actually learning it and how to use it, its not worth it
---
Snarky, I'm using that from now on. Love it.
---
Seems like a pretty interesting theory. So far looks like no one has debunked it yet. Gonna try this in my next guild run and see how it goes!
---
i spend a lot of time on twitch watching streams but never bothered with the app until playing wow classic for the addon helper lmao
---
still use browser for streams though
---
fuck ads
---
Toggles autoattack on resurrected players?
---
People need to continue to talk about this more and more.
---
Please, for the love of God, pet that adorable cat!
---
That’s pvp. I’m fine with pvp. I’m not okay with a warlock telling me to stop aoeing or he will pull things to kill me. And then whisper spamming me when I talk to his guild officers before resorting to opening a ticket that also hasn’t done anything. Because he has continued to come back on different days. In different areas.
---
Every single zone in Classic is its own separate shard.
---
In all seriousness though, there are a LOT of bugs like this, for example there's a warlock exploit that allows you to have two demons out for a short time, 30-40 seconds
---
There's also an exploit that gives you unlimited mana until level 10
---
There are a LOT of exploits that need fixing ASAP, some are insanely broken.
---
Hit doesn’t help with taunts, it just helps generate more threat off melee attacks
---
If you are hugging the wall you won't get spotted from the dog side corner, otherwise you can open a vault and stand in it.
---
Kill it
---
&gt; It's definitely been this way longer than a few weeks.
---
It wasn't working that way when I tried it. I had to search for information to find out why.
---
If it's working that way now, something has changed within the last few weeks.
---
&gt; People in this thread have verified and posted proof, and you just keep saying "check these wowhead comments."
---
One person has posted proof, and that was *not* my reaction.
---
Accountants slow way down Nov/Dec too. A lot take the last 2-3 weeks off at the end of the year.
---
You begin by chipping the wood past kindling stage and get some flint and steel.
---
I've done a little. The positives are clearcasting for regrowth is a free heal but takes time. Sitting in bear spec most of the time and you get nature's grasp, which while I always forget to use is pretty amazing against people who can kick. So you're also limited to shifting more (which means more furor procs). Usually means casters you cat more and sit in bear for pretty much everyone else. You're gonna get wrecked by shamans (lucky me I'm horde) and I think it's way better against druids because clearcasting will give you much more longevity against druids. Paladins are similar. And once they blow hoj, you still have clearcasting. It's good for 1v1 just as NS. But 2+ NS is better, when a arms or fury warrior tries to kill you in bear with 10k armor and they sunder you to 6-8k and you're still cutting their damage down in half you're going to win. Then you pop nature's grasp and you win. Hard casting regrowth isn't a problem 90% of the time. And the other 10% your gonna die to a lock regardless.

You mean on reset day when all guilds are waiting for onyxia/warchiefs buffs in org? Strategically taken screenshot to inflate your opinion. Go stand in the same spot on a monday morning at 3am and take a screenshot and show us. God this is fucking annoying af.
---
I'm a rogue, I have never thought that - it's a green item. That's crazy
---
Spent all night soloing it to get the pants, no regrets.
---
Ty will try it out.
---
There it no storage admin lmao. Database admin?
---
As a mid-level warlock, should I still be using imp when doing group content like dungeons? Sometimes I feel like the succubus cc would be pretty helpful, plus her dps is better than imp.. but obviously the stamina boost from imp is a nice party buff
---
Druids. My main is a Druid. Sad.
---
You can type care with your left hand very quickly
---
And a 30 day cooldown.
---
Sad we have can't engage in big scale pvp action and our spells are pre lagged because of batching.
---
We did this on Monday and it works as advertised
---
Damn near impossible with leeway and absurd deadzone.  If it's a tauren warrior, you're just NOT going to do this.
---
real money trader i think
---
Quit.
---
TIL frieza is alliance. Proof that horde are the good guys.
---
I remember the consensus being more of a "temporary necessary evil"
---
Do you cut your nails at your desk? 😣
---
If they charge you you're pretty much screwed.  If you deny the charge, scatter trap the intercept and hope to god their fear is down since trap's only gonna last 6 seconds.  If they fear after the scatter trap then you're dead.  A good warrior will have you hamstrung so you're not going to get that far away.
---
Go to winterspring, google Qia. Check the comments. Find the macro. Profit.
---
If you have further questions the comments there will answer them for you.
---
"Go and stand in the same spot on a monday morning at 3am" says it all.  
---
Ofc it's prime time but if it's already that bad now what will it be when they drop phases in a few days, that's the point.  
---
Imagen that with dubble the people..
---
It is confirmed that in WoW Classic SoR rank 3 has 20% spelldamage coefficient instead of 10%, however Blizzard has vaguely stated that they won't be changing "bugs" like old accidents made during development but will try to fix bugs that break things.
---
So when I goof off by randomly wanding critters between pulls, I'm actually preventing wipes?  Good to know.
---
lmao, wow
---
It only takes 35 mins to do 5 runs, then log out and do something else. You can also mine dark iron for more extra gold on the side.

Again, you don’t know that.

Threat is bad in AoE, but  perfectly fine in single target DPS.
---
You da new OOK!
---
This is really concerning. While I'm excited for P2 there's not a really a lot there for me. I primarily play PvE and am more interested in BGs / dueling when it comes to PvP. 
---
I'm concerned however because this is going to hurt a large portion of the player base and could seriously damage the WoW Classic community as a whole. There's no coming back from that. 
---
Blizzard needs to fix this. Until they do they need to communicate to the player base about how and why this is happening and how they're going to fix it. 
---
Shadowlands can kick rocks. I've waited forever for Classic. Give it to me proper, I'm paying a premium for it.
---
Yeah it was nuts, my guild was the only one to clear naxx, the entire server gathered together to celebrate with us. Both factions literally bowed down in tribute to our raid team.
---
We were all exhausted, and BC was a week away... it was insane.
---
Scatter FD with DR doesn't last long enough for hamstring/crip poison to wear off. The best PVP spec is  21/27/3 to Intimidation + Trap people for full duration and still have scatter shot CD up.
---
Every time I read “we live in a society” I can’t help but read it in George Costanza’s voice lol.
---
i really need to start reading tooltips
---
Yes it absolutely will. It’s a complete power swing. If a rogue pops prep and his 2nd combo get interrupted by a freezing band the fights over. Idk why everyone thinks mages insta-win every matchup, they’re often way closer than you’d think. 
---
Not everyone is a perfect player fyi.
---
&gt; Slow down later content not this.
---
2.5 is fine, bring out BG's as the servers can't HANDLE the large scale OWPvP.
---
AQ and Naxx are going to be LONG phases.
---
All online communities are like this, especially with gaming.  I don't know what causes it, but it's mostly brought about by teens trying to be edgy and express a "counter culture" type opinion and then adopted by people that never grew up in their 20s and then a smaller number in their 30s until you get to people that have legitimate aspurger's syndrome.  
---
It's so strange how it's progressed over the years.  I remember not seeing such bad stuff when I was younger on the internet, but now it's pervasive in literally any Discord, voice chat, or in game chat.  It's strange that since the media has taken such a strong stance against things like racism and sexism, that it's become more common to see things like the N word and other stuff.  
---
I never found that type of "reaction comedy", if you can even call it that, to be funny.  I don't know why it got so popular.
---
Reminds me of playing gtaV with my friend flying in a plane on Xbox. 
---
Him: “Hey how do I take out my landing gear?”
---
Me: “Press Y”
---
Him : presses Y and watches as his character opens the door and flies out of the plane.
---
The dick makes it cuter
---
Grob gang
---
Hahahaha upvote it, its so goddamn acurate!
---
I dont think I've seen 30 alliance in one place in classic so far...
---
Here is the only situation where a priest or pally is better than a Druid for healing.
---
You have no warlock
---
Or
---
More than one person die within a 30 min period. (And it's not the healer)
---
That's it. If you wipe, it doesn't matter if you have a res, you all run back. If the healer dies, they are running back and it's the same time lost.
---
So ask yourself...how often are people dying in your 5-mans, and when they do how often is it a total wipe? For me its usually no one dies, it is a wipe. Rarely is that the case.
---
However, bres is, more times than not, better than res because it acts as a wipe recovery if done well. When you're the healer you're likely one of the last to die, and you can use it as wipe recovery with any competent group. Because honestly, how often are you rolling with a shadow, ret/protection or else/enh, I'd say more often than when I'm running without a lock. Its way better. I'd prefer a druid healer over a priest any day. Especially with a better toolkit for dps once geared over both holys but not over shamans because totems are way better.
---
Yes, I Know that there Is some kind of formula and +20 dmg does not equal plain +20 dmg on each spell or dot I cast.
---
my guild just blows him up and has all the mages only decursing and melee using pots like u said
---
Is it true dwarves love gold?
---
Nah, we just tell it that to get it to sleep with us.
---
Honestly, this is one of the quests that many people know what is going on.  A lot of cross faction help actually happens by clearing mobs.   It's one of the few quests where I've seen known griefers actually not grief but watch.  
---
There will be the occasional troll that screws with a player, but that is more rare.
---
Just Report them
---
Eeeh idk. Sounds like a croc. Letting stealth classes get the jump on you for free and excluding certain items seems lame and fake as hell.
---
All the good writes left ages ago.
---
Had a quarter of orgrimmar DC during Ony Buff on Smolderweb last night, and another 50% were lagging and running in place for about 20 seconds...
---
I think it's a pretty reasonable, albeit slightly aggressive pace for now.
---
I'm not sure I'd really _want_ to be "done" with MC/Ony once BWL comes out.
---
When players feel "done" they typically get bored, and stop playing. 
---
Right now without Honor as a time sink, a lot of players just kinda raid log 1 night a week for the MC/Ony clear.
---
Post Phase 3 launch is actually where I would rather see them take a longer 'break' and slow down releases as having a second raid actually gives reasonable weekly content for average raiders, and access to BGs gives a good amount content for PvP.
---
Just a guy saying the N word a lot, nothing else interesting.
---
Spell power= all your spells. Shadow power= shadow spells
---
Cause its a pvp server, get over it
---
Do you go OOM in fights?  If no, then you don't need int.
---
Lol just started playing Wow in Classic. EQ for 20 years. I use /camp.
---
I thought they couldn't use the API like they do in retail so that wasn't possible?
---
It was not like this on pservers lol
---
For shadow spells, +spell damage and +shadow damage do the same thing. But since +spell damage applies to any spell, not just shadow, you generally get less of it for an equivalent item.
---
2% but also gets rid of the bugged hidden 1% extra you start with. So if you are a human rogue using swords you can have +10 from talents and racials. I believe that would only be +hit total.
---
Also of note the glancing blows caps out at +8.
---
Also of note that ranged weapons don't do glancing blows.
---
Tldr +5 is such an incredible stat for any melee dps but don't shoot for more unless you get the easy free ones as a human combat rogue. Also it's not worth using as a hunter.
---
That's toxic right? I mean what they are doing.
---
I love my cx-3! :D
---
6% with 305+ wep skill (orc/human/edgies/aclg)
---
9% with 300 wep skill.
---
Wep skill + 6% hit is the highest priority a tank has.
---
Not to be a dick, but you only say Oh fuck with a lock when a mob is legit just bashing him in the face over and over. Renew or Rejuv are great but that's about it. 
---
If your friend doesn't "Get" this or demands to be topped off, take him off that pedestal you have him placed on, cos he's wank.
---
just trust me i've been there before and it's NEEEARLY worth it but it's not
---

---
Pretty sure 15 is where glancing blows deal 100% normal damage.
---
Yeah great suggestion, ignore the talents that increases your armor which is by far the best stat for druids.
---
I sure hope not
---
It's not random, it's iterated based on character creation date, so if you stack two people together the OLDER character will have their threat reset.  
---
It's stupid, yes, but it's not random.
---
Warlocks don't really need topping off when they are tapping, the exception being a mob legit just repeatedly kicking the shit out of him. 
---
Rejuv or Renew is alright, appreciated even but a good warlock won't demand heals constantly if they do they're probably wank and don't understand what their class is capable of.
---
you see there is this thing called "fun" some people think BGs are "fun" tough concept i know

Are you retarded? Alliance have the strongest PVP premades due to palidans, an alliance only class. Alliance has better pvp potential then horde hands down.
---
Well thats a blind spot for npc's, i think that's not how those "cities" work, am i right??
---
I really really hope they do. I rolled my Druid on the wrong server smolderweb alliance seems super imba compared to horde. Feels like 3 alliance to 8-10 horde
---
How do you get dbm to track dungeon kills? Mine doesnt do that
---
You said something about vanishing for threat reduction so other person can tank, not something about vanishing after looting. Are you lost in your lies or what?
---
But more servers means they are dead during non peak hours. 
---
Also people don’t want to play on low pop server. 
---
Look at how many servers there are which are dead right now and even have free transfer, yet people don’t do it.

I find this absolutely crazy... Back in vanilla we never had 1 binding drop ever in my guild and we ran MC countless times. We even had our alts running it with half main half alts and never had it drop. Not saying we did MC from day 1 on our server because we weren't the top dawgs but still we had it on farm before NAXX and still!!! Thats nuts. Grats x3,000.
---
Not really, but it’s against the rules. You can report them for Cheating if they are safe spotting guards
---
Not even a single letter?
---
It’s not a misconception at all. It’s barely bis in pve because of 3 SP which was what the initial post was about. 
---
You could argue stam rings are better but I would hardly say much better. Everything has its place in WoW and if you know you’re gonna have to deal with stealth, it’s bis. ESPECIALLY before pvp trinket. 
---
People have this bizarre idea that every fight is going to be 1v1 honorable duels. Like if you’re playing you know this is VERY rarely how it is. Even just running WS and BS for thorium I rarely ever fight 1v1. Just wait until we actually get honor. 
---
The ring is AMAZING at turning around unfair fights. I swear that duel tournament has warped everyone’s opinion of each item.
---
This is literally how wPvP goes 90% of the time even on Smolderweb which is supposedly 50:50
---
People will 3v1 or 5v1 you then spam /laugh and camp
---
Huh, neat trick, I'll have to try it!
---
Could just be a 5-man dungeon too. No doubt I would swap to frost if and when I go into end-game raiding, but for now fire is more fun to play for me and very few npc's I have encounter have been immune. Granted I'm only 55 though.
---
I just saw Noggen making you skeleton. Don't know what else it does.
---
most likely classic, has the same chat ui as me
---
You are all wrong. 
---
The "tech world" is just way more incusive/mainstream now.
---
I think WSG launched as 10-20, 21-30, 31-40 etc but they changed it to 10-19, 20-29. 
---
AB starts at 20 tho.
---
It wasn't raid day :C
---
Alright thanks man, i dont want to bring negativity im just asking thats all
---
Get 2x arcane protection potions and top meters after first curses went out.
---
Yea I’ll concede maybe not worth 500g to you. But imo it’s one of the best items you can actually buy with gold as a mage.
---
There's a reason why they call it "Stamina" instead of like "Health" because it represent your ability to keep on fighting rather than your actual health.
---
https://imgur.com/ARmikhs simple screenshot of the page from D&amp;D 5e, that sums it up quite nicely. 
---
It also kind of explains why an NPC can die to a simple dagger in a cutscene but can take on thousands of dagger hits in gameplay.
---
So, vanish basically resets your threat. If a rogue isn't vanishing when getting beaten nearly to death by a mob then it's either on CD, which he will probably say or they don't understand what it does.

&gt;barista on tinder trying very hard.
---
That's not a red flag, that's just you over-generalizing after getting dumped by a barista on Tinder. So now you're a bitter man with an overweight wife whom you deep inside wish was that barista, but you know you're at the point in your life where you must settle.
---
See? 2 can play that game. I'd bet you my assumptions about you are far more accurate than your assumptions about the average barista on Tinder.
---
Grats on your finds mate. What are your addons called? Especially interested in bag and layout ones :)
---
not necessarily true. some private servers had times of 12k ppl logged in at once, we dont really know how many blizz allows on a layer but we do know even lower pop servers are having lag fests when too many people get together
---
Did the truth hit a little hard, cupcake?
---
This. Very simple. I think Op is confusing themselves.
---
Back in the day I convinced some kids that ALT+F4 gets you a God Sword and thousands of Gold. Well, about 5 minutes later trade chat was booming with people bitching about how ALT+F4 shut their game off. This was during TBC, I had several others who got into the joke and started naming off things you'd get with ALT+F4. It continued for the next several days until people stopped falling for it. Good times.
---
Yikes. Armchair psychology at it's finest, maybe this is your coping mechanism? Link to top guild please with proof? Orrr is it coming out of your ass? So far I've provided basic math from top 10 guilds worldwide that disputed every claim you've ever made and yet you've provided nothing but shitter 95 percent parses 🤷‍♂️ 
---
Why would I have a coping mechanism? Let's entertain your idea that hunters out damage mages right now and somehow "top the meters" LOL, mages rogues warlocks and warriors STILL outscale them in p3 and beyond. Hunters won't even come close to mages then (who share the #1 spot with fury warriors in term of dmg). Why would I cope with playing one of the most versatile classes in the game? I don't. You're making up shit to attempt to further your point. It's pathetic. Is your version of top guild the top 100? Or top 1000? Both are jokes, whichever. 95tj percentile players do not play the class to their maximum extent and as such, we need to look at 99 percentile in order to grasp a classes full capabilities. I've provided you the math, statistics and ability to grasp the fact hunters simply aren't good 🤷‍♂️. Now it's just up to you to accept it.
---
Do your dps warriors ever pull aggro?  Or do you ever have to tell them to slow down on their dps?  We have those problems all the time when the tank has a sword and board.

Which means no one has to work to learn it. So people are less tech literate.

You're adorable
---
&gt; Those of us who are already 60 and have two characters in MC are a minority Blizzard shouldn't cater to.
---
You say that, but how do you know?  What % of people that log on are 60 compared to those that are still leveling?  What % of people have been 60 for weeks?  We don't have that answer.  Blizzard does, and they are making decisions based on that data.
---
We are at 1 complete set and 1 extra binding.
---
&gt; They get groups much easier
---
nope. raid spots perhaps, but not dungeon groups.
---
I might, but not for awhile
---
The luck that we had tonight is speechless, almost impossible. I've read about guilds doing MC for more than a year and they dont even see one binding.  happy for our maintank that we got it so early, we can easly grind up the arcanite bars untill phase 3 arrives also.   
---
thanks for such good words bro
---
You’re the man. Thank you!
---
Agreed, but an apple is the closest thing to an orange I have right now.
---
Yea i didn't realize the two weapons swing independently of each other.  I thought it went MH then OH rinse repeat.
---
That’s cause most rogue guides recommend keeping s&amp;d up at all times, and that often doesn’t leave much room for evicerate to be your main finisher. Most guides also recommend going combat for PVE.

You. Are. Delusional.
---
Report and scurry away it’s what I do... even more enjoyable when it’s a 60 hoping all that playtime is for birthing when the ban hammer comes down
---
The average person watches 6 hours of TV a day throughout the week.  That's 30 hours for the AVERAGE person.  20 hours is still casual.  I don't play that much, but that's what the numbers are.
---
You can ask what's needed and depends who you have in the party. If you have annoying enemy casters you may even pull out a felhound.
---
That sounds crazy difficult to do IRL honestly.  I can barely pat my head and rub my tummy at the same time.  Now asking me to do that but at a slightly different rate for each at a consistent rate for each.
---
What do you lose by them releasing PvP ranking next week?  Does MC go away?  Does Onyxia go away?  No.  You just get more content.
---
As you mentioned HoJ if you have a geared friend who is a rogue or a guildie willing to help or pay a little for it you can both Run HoJ Trinket over and over and over and over. The only thining limiting you is the instance reset timer it's that fast to do.
---
Stealth past everything, 60 pick's the wheel lock thing, stealth some more, bash his head in, loot him, vanish and leave. Or for flavour try to kill all the adds,
---
Just read the last sentence in my previous comment.
---
Just unacceptable that's all it is
---
your ass is not a better source
---
Could be bias, as a warrior I invite hunters more often then rogues.
---
Anecdotal at best. As a software engineer this seems like a really silly algorithm to write. If anything you’d randomize who got the threat reduction if multiple targets got hit, not use the ID or GUID of the objects (player characters) and just take the lower value. It’s also more difficult to determine which GUID is “less” since it’s not an integer value and would require more cpu cycles to calculate. What’s easier to calculate? Is 10 larger than 9 or is c0181e6e-29e3-477a-9641-656691255658 larger than 
---
4ed84701-5415-43cd-9554-01e520006c33? As I said, silly. 
---
According to other people that have tried to figure out how her threat works, if the fireball hits multiple people, the threat reduction doesn’t work and will keep targeting the highest threat until they take the fireball alone, which is more than likely what is happening here.
---
Is there a website where I can see the animations of every race/gender?
---
People always talk about "aborting" a HS.  How exactly is that done.  I click HS, it lights up to tell me its going to go off on the next swing.  I click it again, and it doesn't disengage.
---
This is definitely true. I've seen too many horror stories of boytoys.
---
Would getting GUIDs and using the information in this way be considered an exploit?

Digg was more popular than Reddit I’m pretty sure
---
Hit doesn't do shit for taunt. You would need spell hit
---
Can you link me that macro. I'm like you, if a macro will do it, I don't need an add-on. I have plenty of add-ons as is.
---
I feel like a lot of the general hate toward rogues is due to the ganking people get from them throughout their time playing the game. Even if its opposite faction, it still leaves a bad taste in people’s mouth to get spawn camped by a rogue while questing. The fact that we lack utility and are melee doesn’t help, but again I feel that a lot of it stems from a general dislike people develop for the class based on personal experiences against them. The reasons people play rogues is the same reason people who don’t - dislike them.
---
Dyslexics Untie LOOOOOL
---
Yeah as far as  i remember lagg was normal in larger city raids. 
---
Would like to see someone put some perspective on this issue. How hard/expensive is it really?
---
so you admit you didn't even know there are people whose sole job is to manage storage infrastructure, yet you think you are qualified to diagnose a storage latency issue from a company that works on a scale large enough to have those roles, who you have absolutely no meaningful information about? am i getting this right?
---
Rogues are the second hardest class to level after warriors. 
---
The best thing you can do it invest in some health potions so when you grind you have more survivability. 
---
Your biggest obstacle are corpse runs. 
---
Also, stop running dungeons unless you need loot or a quest reward. Dg’s give terrible exp.
---
Think it depends if you are talking DW versus not DW and yellow attacks or white attacks. Going beyond that point for dw white attacks minimal increase to glancing blows damage isn't worth it when it comes at the cost of another valuable stat like crit
---
Just gotta hit retaliation and sweeping strikes plus have a nice fat health potion available
---
What if I told you there is a reagent vendor next to the AH, mailbox and bank in both UC and Org?
---
that's the joke

They do for overwatch, I dunt see why they wouldnt for wow
---
Back in vanilla one dropped for my guild. We traded it for 10k gold, and a sulfuron hammer. This was pre Naxx. As a benchmark, crusader enchants went for around 100 gold each, and the crimson whelpling pet was about 25 gold.
---
No idea how much it would go for right now on your server.
---
Mind blown
---
I used to do that back in *EverQuest*!  Such a classic.
---
You might have seen the other suggestions for him, but madseason is legit your best option.
---
Honestly, turning off XP evened the playing field and made it more fun for me. I enjoyed the segregated portion of the changes because BGs were higher pace....what I ruined twinking entirely for me was heriloom items.
---
You could now farm all twink items from any other character and it kinda took the journey away. There wasn't any planning involved when making/leveling a twinks; which was half the fun for me.
---
Not sure why you have so much pent up passive aggressiveness. 
---
If you don't participate, why do you care what other people do with their time in game? It's a videogame, hombre.
---
A question regarding Free Action Potions: What do they stop? It says stuns and movement impairing effects but what does that mean?
---
I'm playing a Hunter and trying to figure out a PvP spec and gear for phase 2 and I have absolutely no idea how to work around FAPs and there isn't a whole lot of information on them (or at least I couldn't find much). It seems like I can Scatter + Freezing Trap through an active FAP, but I have no idea why.
---
Also; Entrapment, Imp. Wing Clip or neither?
---
A risk I’m willing to take
---
Once you get almost bis, 24ap is massive.
---
No, I think they're fine.  I'm only 57 now and I've been playing since launch.  I'm probably the least common denominator here though.  Everyone else is already level 60 and raiding.  By next week I'll be 60, I'll be in MC with my guild and probably clear it without issue.  I'll be done with Onyxia by the week after.  Then I'll be raid logging and doing some PvP with my guild for fun, without really trying to get to any specific rank.  That's pretty much the game from then on in.
---
If people are THAT worried about getting to 60, then put in the time and get there so you can sit around doing nothing for 90% of the week.
---
Marry that one.
---
Top rogues in arena / bgs were orcs.
---
Yellow hits do not proc glancing and the equation for glancing is calculated based on the difference between attacker weapon skill and defenders defense skill. Does not matter 1h vs dw. Also as a side note, glancing blows do not happen in pvp.
---
Welp, this WAS wholesome.
---
Robert Rambles (I think is his channel) has a decent set of videos. They get boring pretty fast, though.
---
Item rack wont even let you swap weapons while in combat, it's so dumb.
---
Have you ever considered how annoying it is for everybody else when you fail your aoe pull, die and all mobs are running back to their spawn location and I pull aggro of 5+ mobs which weren't around when I pulled my single mob.
---
Get rekt, I fully support people fearing your mobs and screwing with you. Stop crying
---
Why are Rogues frowned upon in PvE groups? I grouped with one the other day and he did some serious DPS. I'd take him any day over the handful of bad mages I've grouped with. Is it because they simply lack an AoE?
---
Eh, not sure about that. If you're a him you're likely to deal more damage than bear, but have more aggro issues with the dps, so it's a question of is the downtime worth the increased damage? I'd say no, even 5 points into reduced rage is massive.
---
