With how massive some of the dungeons like BRD are it's not really viable to always do full clears. I'm not going to spend 3+ hours every time I want to do BRD

at your level, work on Oily Blackmouth. Blackmouth oil (made from the fish by alchemists) uses 2 fish and sells for about 15-20s a piece (my server). Or you can sell the fish itself. You'll need to compare AH prices. I don't think your fishing is high enough for anything above that.

Scorch spam is best spam

I don‚Äôt even know what is BiS for me at this point. If it looks like it‚Äôs an upgrade I‚Äôm rolling.
---
DS/Ruin optimizes your shadowbolt spam damage, which your raid DPS boils down to.
---
SM/Ruin is not quite as effective at shadowbolt spamming, but grants some additional and/or improved DoTs which will be very helpful in 5-man instances and PvP.

Thank you. You're right. Without good officers, it's hell. Been there lol. Good advice
---
Yes unless I'm misinterpreting this 
---
https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/world-of-warcraft-game-time
---
those players where actually worse than bots lol
---
Yes, that isn't a realistic expectation. You should expect anyone to roll on any item they "need" aka would equip if they won the roll. 
---
Also, people should chill MC/ONY can be beaten with people wearing crappy tier .5 gear. It's not like you need to be fully decked out with BiS pre-raid before you step foot in a raid.
---
Wow found a lookalike when everyone has a very limited preset amount of physical features to choose from. Different tusks too, is this what this sub is now?
---
Always amusing when people with no clue about the game decides that some item is inherently an item for "their" class and refuse to let someone who gets equal value from it roll.
---
You know what we call players like you? A ninjalooter.
---
Shadow weaving, priest talent, does affect shadow wands.  Other than that, I don't think any other skills aside of curse of elements/storm strike affect wand damage
---
Wow I want you to be my personal tutor you seem really good at this. Some questions I have: is it worth it to buy a level 30 range blue item if it‚Äôs cheap and then sell it for higher? What do I do if there‚Äôs a valuable item that is being listed many times for very cheap, Should I buy them all out and then raise the floor price? Will having around 100 of that item already change your decision? What are some general tips just for someone trying to make some quick gold to buy their mount?
---
Well I don't have any experience with it but azshara says it's 45 to 55 so I guess that's the place to go
---
Can I get your gold before you die?
---
IT's not illegal.  Colluding in-game is against the rules, but any collusion outside is perfectly fine.  Shit like this happened on the forums all the time in 2005
---
only read 10% of this thread.  don't under any circumstances do a loot council.  you aren't a guild that should do a loot council
---
Can't say I've met a lock that has needed more than renews or the occasional lesser heal but then again I also haven't met the kind of lock who lifetaps or hellfires themselves to within an inch of death either so that may be why I'm all for healing our purple-mage friends. :)
---
60 alliance locks are usually in more of a demand so you could have that as an advantage over other classes such as mages. Locks are beasts in pvp both 1v1 and in group fights. You can also go for a more DOT build or crazy burst with conflag and shadowburn. Nice thing about lock is you do great damage with pve builds in pvp as well, so you really wont ever need to respec for pvp  (another thing that mages wish they could say)
---
Ok, thanks but it really wasn't worth bringing something situational like this here. I feel like you're just reaching at this point. Keep it basic and simple -- if it's good for you, and will actually make a large difference, roll on it. If not and it would just slightly be an upgrade, take it if no one needs. 
---
Bottom line is, we aren't only limited to our bis. It's bullshit, and ridiculous.

for me its not gear as much as pacing in relation to zone pop. A lot of alliance warriors roll human for obvious reasons... and things go great till westfall.... then you spend 30 minutes per quest fighting every mage and their mom for mobs.
---
I actually went with druid instead and although the speed of combat, gear, etc feels similar it actually feels like im accomplishing something. It FEELs like this is due to fewer people playing in nelf zones.
---
I dont care how fast or slow my leveling is... but when i log in I sure as heck want to at least finish a single quest...
---
Personally, I'm very wary of Loot Councils. I'm in favour of a DKP system with clear, strict rules... minimum bids, decaying DKP, etc. Set up as a silent auction sounds good to me, too. That way screenshots can be taken of everyone's bid for documentary as a precaution against complaints. :)
---
Hillsbrad/Alterac Mountains, Desolace, go do Shimmering flats quests, Arathi Highlands, SM farming

What's the easiest way to get a quick price check on something?  How do I know how much I should be paying for pre-raid BiS items from the AH?  Or should I just spam trade chat for them?
---
Greetings rogue brother, you should get a gouge/blind mouse over macro
---
#showtooltip
---
/cast [target=mouseover,harm] Gouge; Gouge
---
it lets you gouge whoever your mouse is over so in this tiger 2v1 you could have gouged the second tiger without losing combo points on the first, if you don't have you mouse over anything you'll just gouge your target. For a blind macro just replace the "Gouge; Gouge" with 
---
Blind; Blind
---
Time to stock up.
---
Private servers. Definitely never played on them though.
---
I imagine its mostly younger people feeling like they are involved in something, it isn't much different than people chanting the same thing over and over at a ball game. At least when it comes to big twitch streams.
---
But fuck is it annoying to group with some robot that just says the same 3 things over and over.
---
Yes. Unless you're needing stam to stay alive or having mana regen problems.
---
It's white and looks longer than your average cloak or cape.
---
I suppose u haven't tried druid in wow classic, old version or this now to say that. You should level a druid and see that its actually way way powerful for both solo and dungeons.
---
Not emoting they are using translators
---
wow, that's a bit nifty
---
What is hello kitty island adventure?
---
I honestly never played vanilla wow. I started in TBC. I started on a warrior then and now classic I'm warrior again. It can be annoying but it really isn't that bad at all. Not sure where these memes come from but my experience so far has been very good with tallboyslim the dawi.
---
My favorite spot is in shimmering flats, all the beasts have excellent grey loot tables for vendoring. Slightly better with skinning but solid regardless.
---
Aq. People need em for greater nature protection pots
---
Who cares. As a healer Im bored out of my skull healing MC. Tanks dont take damage.

For the many typos, probably.

4 hour Mara - best run to date. Pick one.

You have ‚Äúofficers‚Äù in your guild and ‚Äúmembers‚Äù and ‚Äútrials‚Äù i‚Äôm assuming? 
---
For p1 I wouldn‚Äôt worry so much about a loot system, what‚Äôs important is clearing rag and ony and building up a reputation, get some class officers and build up the roster with solid people.
---
Once p2 comes then you‚Äôre in the right place for a loot system since you will already have your roster and new people will know if they want to be part of a guild that gets shit done, they will have to follow the rules.
---
my groups keep failing at the torch room

i need to kill emp regularly for ironfoe
---
i think it's just a pipe dream
---
Supposedly Flask of Wisdom restores 2000 mana at no cooldown, so if the issue is mana, you should be able to stack up on lots of flasks for all casters and spam them as mana potions.
---
I think it depends what you do. For PvE I don't think you *need* any addons really. Threat meter maybe. In PvP some can help you for sure. Cast Bars for enemies, as an example...
---
That's not the definition of worth.
---
Because for warriors it's temporary.  It's a weak CD.
---
You can get a head piece a bit earlier than you otherwise would, but that's about it. Bombs and shit can also be good because rogues have terrible AoE.
---
^ this. 
---
I‚Äôm playing and loving Classic but I don‚Äôt understand what you were trying to get at here. I can log on retail right now and Org will be this full.
---
How do you use master looters? I kinda want to in some situations but am scared of messing it up, and you can only really practice in a group setting.
---
That's very true. Just not the norm with warriors
---
You need a pretty high lvl to be able to pick that quest
---
I didn‚Äôt do anything but eyeball it, 14 runs should be around 90%~ yeah? 99% at 28?
---
Your mistake was using microsoft search.
---
[New Census Addon](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/censusplusclassic)
---
Rogue is pretty slow. It's like 3rd slowest (behind warrior and paladin), although still quite a bit faster than them. Or maybe 4th slowest. 
---
There is a chart somewhere which shows leveling speeds.
---
Why is a warrior a nightmare at 60? It's tough to find a tank spot in raids, you'd want to find a guild to let you tank.
---
DPS is fine though as a warrior.
---
Do they not realize they are not only bringing a dps but a potential off healer or off tank if things go south? People are so one track minded lol
---
What activity are you talking about? Pvping on a pvp realm? Choosing to fight only certain players of the enemy faction? Neither of these things are remotely bannable. You need to prove that cross faction communication occurred, which blizzard does not have the power to do.
---
Assuming there isn't a Priest
---
You would know about weirdos. ;)
---
Wouldn't surprise me.. Really tiresome having them promise things then doing something else, and not even saying a word. We should be able to expect a closure time for the transfers when thats what they said they'd give us.

Wait he was still kitable in wotlk?!

Yeah but like in wotlk

Probably better to stick with Mara, with herb prices going down you will probably average around 25g. The only plus side is random chance for purp BoEs that are very rare and the books that are rare.

Not only no, but *&amp;%^ no.

Gear can be ‚Äúshit‚Äù if it‚Äôs not ‚ÄúpreBiS‚Äù.

I think the private servers are much higher profile than people would assume.  They have real GMs, and giant budgets.  They have a EULA just like blizzard, although there may be different nuance in the legalize; and they will absolutely be willing to ban you if you're doing something disruptive to the server.
---
Let me share what I think is one of the funniest videos MonkeyNews has made.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKZZJlX6keU
---
No, take your small server back in vanilla. Now multiply it to how many people are posting on reddit. It's just you hear more about it.
---
It's cuz perception is pretty much useless
---
This guy statistizes.
---
You are right to deny it. I've seen several incidents of people getting themselves banned simply by playing on vacation, so the sporadic change in IPs and locations will trigger a flag. Just tell him to get a leveling guide and powerlevel to 60. If ur main is a mage then he should be able to aoe level one pretty quick.
---
What's updog?
---
The difference between mob level is very noticeable with warriors. Against Red and Orange, pretty much forget it. Against green mobs, I feel like a god.
---
I‚Äôve been straight vendoring wands. Ain‚Äôt much but it keeps me training
---
Kinda just made my own route and after I stopped dieing from the pats and learn when to pull you will clear before the 12 min mark. The gold income is all based off the AH and price of herbs on your server.
---
Not the same Org/Sw tho
---
Do tell!
---
That's a shame, I suppose I'll go to Ashenvale, since it seems neutral.
---
Fun fact for pallys: open world mobs gain more range when you hit them with your weapon. If you see a badass mob you need to kill in a group of 5-6, hit him once, pop divine shield/blessings of protection, and run away. The other mobs will reset but the mob you want will still be on you. This only works well with pallys because you can ignore daze and root effects, however this is also possible using a melee demon pet for warlocks.
---
It was only a BiS, it was only a BiS.
---
What I said takes into account talents. Your pet should be doing about 40% of your damage *with the BM damage talents*.  It's a 2-3% damage increase with those.
---
And it's not nearly enough to see significant diminishing returns on armor. As for threat generation, almost all of your pet's threat comes from growl and screech's AP reduction. The owl isn't even going to be generating 7% more threat, it'll be way less.
---
Not the same Org/SW
---
No way dude for real? Nice haha I laughed hard when I read that
---
J heard this was hard, dropped off the first whelp I killed lol
---
Yeah, open roll on all- at one point that was legendaries too üòÇ. I fixed that asap
---
I've literally mained Mage in every expack.... don't try to pull that shit lol. I was obviously being hyperbolic, there are SOME fights you have to move in, but in vanilla... not many. No one is personally attacking Mage, a lot of us are Mages. Calm down.
---
Congrats. If a majority of your raid showed up in greens I guarantee you wouldn‚Äôt be clearing it as fast or as easily as a raid with BiS gear. 
---
You have no point.
---
Good try! It might be from that book too, I've never read it. But I was quoting Seth Brundle, a character from The Fly movie starring Jeff Goldblum.
---
Yes, CAN BE. Not IS.
---
Look at context bro, look at the situations being discussed. It's too late in the day for me to bother breaking it down for you.
---
I suppose I play druid and I know what I'm talking about. This item is crap for leveling.
---
It's the younger kids. They are little brats.
---
She must have a similar spec as I do.  I didn't get a mount until 46/47, and that's only because I turned 12 gold into 100 gold over a weekend when runecloth bags made a healthy profit.
---
I went for a pure group build, thus couldn't solo to save my life, and ended up playing mostly solo.  (Far more healers now than when I played vanilla, and was in constant demand).  Basically after every 2 fights I need to drink, or wait 3 minutes to recoup mana.  So killing monsters actually ends up costing me money, and it's purely through completing quests where I was making any money at all.
---
I should have gone shadow like everyone else.
---
Lol this would take you right past my house
---
But still, Blizzard has that "reference client" that they can always refer back to if something truly is wrong, and most bugs get fixed relatively promptly.
---
Compared to private servers where you'd need to go all Sherlock Holmes on any bug, digging through videos and forum posts from over 10 years ago to find little shreds of evidence that it is/isn't supposed to work that way, and then maybe in 6 months the fix will go live if enough people agree with your findings.
---
"they have the source code" is mostly a reliable argument. Not completely infallible, but mostly reliable.

Don't let the bad apples ruin your barrel.

That sped me through the 50s pretty quickly

My runs take 15 mins total. You outrange her stone throw and then do auto, Multi shot.
---
Also you Bait her earthquake with your pet and do auto, Aimed, multi, auto, run a bit, auto. 
---
It‚Äôs not that bad just try it again. If Rot trip is catching up to you though you‚Äôve got serious problems. I‚Äôd assume you don‚Äôt have 2/2 pathfinding talent which you need
---
Im on that. Gratz
---
I just wanted to give my perspective to the community based on what I know. You're making an assumption as to what our guild is based on. If you were a member or someone with a better understanding, maybe you'd see it for its benefit not just its detriment. Sorry the guy insulted your intelligence when he asked if you wanted to merge. It's early in classic, it's early in raiding, and IMO all this is to help people overall. I can't speak for Zerth. I don't know what his true feelings are, but as I said, from the perspective of a member of the guild this whole situation is blown way out of proportion because the 2 of you butted heads.

You can get back in the chest fine? Are you just trying to justify ninjaing items? Literally never had this problem and I've done a lot of chest runs.
---
nah with sweeping strikes and cleave you go two at a time with little downtime if you're geared.
---
I think the opposite. People focus on one character and burn out. Either levelling or after realizing doing one raid a week isnt that fun.

[NugEnergy](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/nugenergy)
---
In terms of speed if min/maxing, owl is the best.
---
But that also assumes you are killing 2+ mobs most of the time.
---
For general use/wpvp/non-min-max-ultra-efficiency, Boar is king.
---
Charge, ability to eat all the food pretty nice, but no focus dump so damage isn‚Äôt min/maxxin‚Äô
---
For easy of use, or not really wanting to micro a pet between 2-3 mobs each pull, I‚Äôd 100% recommend a boar.
---
That's awesome.

I mean that's pretty spot on. Basically someone young who has been so ruined by the instant gratification of the modern world that they behave as though they have a sever case of ADD. Name is a reference to Boomer, as in Baby Boom generation.

Just black list the asshats? Sure I've dealt with a few but I've got a list of ppl I refuse to play with and sadly add to it each time I get a new toxic encounter.  That is the life of any online game. U r not going to avoid it. Just ignore and move on

Well you're either saying that or arguing with me over literally nothing, take your pick.

knew what that was before clicking on it and its def the best youtube guide.

Cries in druid.
---
My old vanilla/bc guild did a "Community Loot Council" where in that if a piece of gear dropped, the players that could use it would deliberate amongst themselves as to who would should get it. Everyone had an equal say and thier disscusion happened in a seperate vent channel. After they came to a consensus, they would return and inform the gm as to who got what piece. Looting did take a considerable amount of time but no one was ever upset by it.
---
lol salty

Good to know my rotation stays the same into my 30's

---
Reminds me of Athene. Just without the part where he literally turns into a weird cult leader.
---
I can get back into the chest but I don't see any items in it.  Once he suggested addons, I think it might be the faster looting addon.  But no, I'm not trying to take the BiS weapon from my healer fir the whole 2 or 3 gold it vendors for.  I actually sent him 40g to apologize for it.
---
You lost me at alliance lol, I'm enjoying my mage alt (also a rogue main)
---
The probability of it dropping 2 night in a row is obviously insanely small, but the 1st one has already dropped so that's not really relevant.
---
Every time from now on they still have a similar chance of dropping.
---
&gt;Just because I'm telling you to stop being obtuse does not mean I'm angry.
---
That's true. But saying this
---
&gt;Then make a point of fuck off already, jesus. What kind of conversation is this? You have made literally no point and keep asking me to tell you what point you've made.
---
Means you are
---
No its not lmao this is econ 101 dude.
---
I kind of enjoy just putting on some music, drinking a beer or 5, and making herbalism laps around Felwood.  Maybe not the most efficient, but it's relaxing and got me my epic.
---
Is the coefficient the same for both?  I found a few different answers online when I looked- not sure if folks used a later version of the game to get their numbers for Vanilla
---
No but it really isnt hard to follow ! guide and get help from a guildie if you are serious about getting from 1-60.
---
As long as you have a single friend willing to give you points or a guild and you plan on being  serious it really isnt that unrealistic.
---
that depends on how many healers youre running and your gear level.  I've been in plenty of wipes where healers went oom so far.
---
In a perfect world, yeah.  everone pulls between 200-300 dps in preraid gear and every boss dies in less than 2 min and no healers ever die.  in reality, in pugs, that doesn't always happen.
---
Not only that but in dungeons efficiency means less stopping to drink. 
---
It still definitely has value.
---
The thing that gets me about hunters is how much they try to rationalize their behavior: pet taunts during dungeon - "at least the tank isnt taking the dmg" , hunter multi shots a sheeped target - "you cant argue with dps meter" , hunter needs on-proc melee weapon - "I'm running a semi-melee build."
---
There is no winning.
---
Lol.
---
Had a warrior tanking scholo last night for our group for gold. He had 7/8 T1 and was saying hes a dad and doesnt have a lot of time to play. ....ya, right dude. 
---
It's a competition to people for some reason.
---
Netherwind has slightly more alliance than horde
---
It seems like you are leaning towards warrior and mage.  By your description of what you want (aoe, different abilities to rogue), I would say mage, warlock, or hunter.
---
If you've leveled a rogue, you can level a warrior.  Very similar difficulty of leveling, but warriors can tank pretty much all the way to sixty.  You are correct though, that without a pocket healer pvp will not be the easiest, but could still be fun if you enjoy it enough.
---
As a horde player, I've always desired to play a paladin.  The beefy healer seems so fun.  Completely different role to rogue, but also not what you described as your preferred choice.  Tanking with them is really not viable.  Unless you are spamming stratholme or scholomance.
---
There is no world that has ever existed where OP gets 60 in 84 hours. Stop.
---
are the books in dire maul available yet? If so how do you get them all I can see when I google it are people complaining about drop rates
---
Me too üòÄ
---
The warrior in the meme should learn to tank. Then the rake would shatter into splinters when it hit his metal face. He would gain xp from every rake shattered.
---
Warrior is a lot stronger than people think. Many players just play them wrong.
---
There is a difference between a 16 year old comment in an MMORPG game forum and your 40 minute old text that your crush still did not reply to
---
Yeah, my point wasn‚Äôt to never have alts. It was to get a main to 60 first. That‚Äôs a common theme on people who‚Äôve bailed:  multiple level 20-30-somethings without a selected main focused to 60.
---
Dude you misinformation you are spreading is ignorant af. Plz stop
---
Ok boomer
---
You died on purpose. We saw the jump...
---
Yes it is. Items aren't solely judged on their economic worth...
---
Not really, you just need to prove patterns of behaviour - blizzard can tell when you log on to certain characters, where your characters are, who they engage with and do not engage with over time - blizzard really only viably needs to infer that you're doing something from your ingame activity - they can ban you for anything without concrete evidence at any time.
---
This looks awesome, I'll copy it down for my hu ter friends and see what they think.

What does that last line do? Clear our error text that show up on screen? Like you cant do that while walking
---
You tell yourself anything that makes you happy mate.
---
Dinged 55 tonight as shaman and want to play resto in endgame, is it a good idea to respec now(to resto talents) or is it possible to heal dungeons as elemental spec up to 60?
---
Worried how hard questing will be.
---
Dude some people have been farming MC for a month. There are loads of 60s with MC gear who will shit on your damage. Also taking a low level makes skipping trash or just  normal routes harder.
---
holy shit lol
---
It would take less actually, he could just get level 60s to power level him through all the dungeons and honestly it wouldnt be that unsurprising if you had a friend or guild help as I've done this for lower level guildies when I'm bored.
---
Mage is very fun to play. Aoe grinding gets old quickly though.
---
When you count total given stats, Deepfury only has 1 more (23 compared to 22).  Also, Shadowcraft contributes to a set bonus so I'd argue they're the vastly superior braces as long as you have at least 1 other piece of Shadowcraft.
---
old guy here, i love it.  cant wait to call all my buddies zoomies in discord.
---
And 60s are far more likely to be geared.
---
lol.
---
It's spellcast not dmg, same mechanic for shadow weaving.
---
by geared I mean just be up to date on your gear. And you can take on those two faster then the mage can take down 4. With only a bandage at most in between. Its not that much slower. The only reason i'd be faster for mages is because a lot of groups are grouped up in 3 or 4 packs. Just need the right farming spot.
---
k
---
Can you highlight the parts that give misinformation please?
---
sounds like a pretty shit game if you can scam people and get away with it, having a monopoly on items is kinda aids but it actually requires effort and time from the people doing it where as scamming people is just a dick move
---
I dinged 60 6 days after releease with 5 days played, lvls from 55-60 takes 2.5-3h and that's not even pushing it. So i'd be off by a few hours if you played for a day. But in that time you'd be happy to ding 39-40 you noob.
---
All I did was point out the distinction between your lazy "hyperbole" and reality. 
---
I don't care enough about you or this conversation to get worked up in the first place. Your attempt to establish my position for me is a failed one.
---
Another Zandalar!
---
I might have abused you at some point. Sorry. STV gave me PSD.
---
\- Vilan, Alliance Warlock
---
Oh well yeah but context goes a long way, he wasn‚Äôt talking about that
---
Same. After awhile I was like... I bet I have to use a quest item.
---
Did you even read what I posted or literally just the first sentence?
---
&gt; It's the same for frost mages and warlocks. Greens with +30 spell power will sell for 150g, while the same item with 26 sp will sell for 20g. 4 spell power is not worth 130 g.
---
Not worth it to you.  But that's mixmaxing.  Same thing happens in games like Path of Exile as well.  Is 10% more stat worth 500% more?  Not for most people, but for **some**, getting the best piece possible has no price limit.
---
Fine by me
---
Actually that's exactly what it means
---
I‚Äôm typically on prime time. Maybe near instances, but out questing it‚Äôs like 75% horde in my experience.

#&lt;Flat Azeroth Society&gt; - Skeram Horde - Loot Council
---
## Hello!
---
**Flat Azeroth Society** is a group of committed casual players. Most of us are professionals in our 30's with kids and/or responsibilities that make our WoW time precious, so we try to take being prepared and effective seriously. We are currently looking to recruit dedicated weekend raiders (**Fri/Sat 9pm-12am EST**) to fill out our remaining raiding slots. We are a close knit group, and are expecting a zero stress raid environment. Our first MC raid is planned for 10/25, and we are working on preparing our members with pre-raid BiS gear and profession help until that time.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
### Current Recruitment Needs:
---
- Druids (**very** high)
---
- Warlock (high)
---
- Mage (high)
---
- Hunter (high)
---
- Shaman (medium)
---
- Priest (medium)
---
- Warrior (low)
---
- Rogue (low)
---
If you are interested in joining us, or just reaching out to figure out who we are before making a decision, reach out to either **popa#7770** or **Mancake#0179** on Discord.
---
How do you rationalize setting pet to aggressive though?  It's not useful anywhere.
---
is there a way in game to determine what is damage and what is what you called spellcast?
---
"Git gud?" 
---
They're the absolute worst class to level.  A facerolling hunter is more survivable than a warrior with cooldowns to blow, time to waste on getting gear, and gold to waste on pots.
---
Unless you have a pocket pally following you around everywhere.
---
Last two pugs I was in had 9 and 10 mages
---
Check out Guidelime. It‚Äôs a framework for player made guides. There are many you can download and it‚Äôs quite comprehensive.
---
Do you really think baby boomers played a lot of wow? 
---
They mostly complained that our multiplayer computer games were letting hackers put viruses on the family pc, and offered all of their Ask Jeeves toolbars as proof.
---
You are bringing up the only exceptions to the rule. A low level mage if you dont already have a mage is going to speed things up. Also taking a low level tank or heals is standard if you cant find one. Everyone else is ignored.
---
Not really, only by inference from application of the debuff.
---
BC
---
Just go collect herbs and nodes and they‚Äôll appear on your map and minimap. No need to import, just go farm.
---
This is a bit of flawed logic, as the main location changes from expansion to expansion... But for Orgrimmar specifically? Think it has to be Cata. The new old worlds, back on the main continents, plus you had stuff like the food dailies, etc which grew time spent in towns -- not all dailies of course, but you sometimes did actually quest in Org. Plus they introduced LFR in the latter part, so between LFG and LFR, you had less reason to leave Org...
---
Brooo CoC is awesome i even spam it on critters. Fight me.
---
How much of that would Be spent on getting mc ready ? Since i really have no  idea how Classic works when it comes to gearing up for The big content
---
If you have a higher ranked wowhead account, your upvotes and downvotes count for more than just 1. So it doesn't really need 100 people to come and downvote, just enough people that have old/well used wowhead accounts.
---
Still frustrating though... no idea why they would import 2.0.x stuff in the first place.
---
Holy/prot aoe farming is great, what you talking about?
---
It's an MMORPG.... RPG.. R.. P.. G.. If people want to do a Mafia, that's up to them.
---
Any of the pure DPS classes will be fine.
---
And here I am 9 days later to downvote your ass :P
---
That‚Äôs not your friend it‚Äôs an acquaintance trying to pass as a friend to glean favors. Look out for people like this in real life too. It seems you might have a hard time establishing boundaries so please work on that!
---
Today, on any server with actual horde players. The majority of WoW players didnt magically get up and leave retail to start from scratch on classic.
---
They are independent events. Every monster slain is a new unique roll.
---
I just wish more classes had options like warriors have Lionheart Helm.  BiS for all of classic, available at the start.  That way you can buy the piece and that slot can be done *forever*.  There is a lot of satisfaction in that.  
---
Obviously it shouldn't be this way for many slots, or really, even more than one.  I just wish other classes had something like this.
---
If you're minmaxing most people say wolf but I like boar because the charge is funny. It doesn't seem to make a huge difference for leveling, just whatever you like and be sure to train the top end growl.
---
Jokerd is a pro who's been doing this dozens and dozens of times. We're not all Jokerd, we don't all have his experience and knowledge. Let's be realistic for two seconds. OP will die, make mistakes, probably do a few inefficient quests, probably want to level professions which will take time, probably want to enjoy the game and check out dungeons and shit which will also take time.
---
It's one of the classic is better circlejerks that makes no sense since cross realm.   I had no problems on retail doing group quests/elites after cross realm was implemented.   It's pretty much the exact same experience I have on classic so far, since I the groups formed questing are disbanded and everyone goes their own way rarely to run into each other again in classic.
---
Engineering is great, it'd make tanking even more fun with grenades (more aoe threat). I went herb/alch so I always have potions, but that's really not necessary.
---
He's never RNG missed 7 attacks in a row. Just get better RNG idiot.
---
That's literally the question here. What is the chance of 2 rolls happening in a row or within some very small distance of each other. And the answer is "exceedingly unlikely". Whereas the answer to the question "What is probability of only one of them dropping over a certain length of time" is "significantly more likely". Just stating that the probability of every roll is independent tells you nothing of value.
---
You‚Äôll soon find out that growl and screech won‚Äôt hold additional mobs when you multishot/dot
---
Also lets assume the pets are the same level (100 base damage per hit) and we already know they share 2.0 attack speed
---
20% dmg talent:
---
Owl - 107 20% dmg = 128.4
---
Carrion Bird - 100 20% dmg = 120  
---
Oh look a 7% difference in damage. Woooooow.
---
15% crit talent (lets go with damage and not crit chance)
---
Owl - 107 x 2 = 214
---
Carrion bird - 100 x 2 = 200
---
Oh look a 7% difference
---
30% attack speed buff (1.4 attack speed)
---
Owl:
---
* 107 per 2.0: 53.5 dps 
---
*107 per 1.4: 76.43 dps
---
Carrion:
---
* 100 per 2.0: 50 dps
---
* 100 per 1.4: 71 dps
---
Hey look a 7% difference.
---
BW
---
Owl: 107 50% damage boost: 160.5 
---
Carrion: 100 50% damage boost: 150
---
Shocked. 7% difference.
---
And I didnt even calculate what happens when they stack. 20% dmg and a crit, then AS boost into a BW activation?
---
Even more of a difference.
---
Do you get more gold from quests at 60?
---
I bursted out laughing.

---
I just skipped STV entirely, I'll go back and do the quests for gold when I'm level 60.
---
What you are experiencing is burst dmg, as you dont fight mobs for more than 30 or so seconds while leveling. Paladins do great burst dmg, but their sustained dmg is lackluster. Not nearly as bad as people make it out to be, but lower than all other specs. 
---
My guild currently takes a paladin to MC because we want all 4 blessings and auras but only have 3 holy paladins. Ret is relevant but as content becomes harder and people start criticizing particular people for shortcomings, ret is usually a target.
---
start at grom and go south to BB. if youre feeling brave, swim around the bottom and go back up the other side. high level baddies over there though.
---
So what‚Äôs the point of your post? You sound convinced already.
---
It is all fine as long as you dont roll on bis of otjer classes when it is just slightly better than what you have for yoz.
---
The part where you tell OP he'll make it in 84 hours bro
---
Not true. You definitely can. Not the first week, but once you get a solid guild core and start picking out the knowledge leaders, you can build a reputable base. 
---
With the knowledge of all future loot drops, it is very simple in classic to start assigning priority as we all know how these loot tables play out.
---
DKP or EPGP is 100% blind to that and relies on the player to decide at an individual level what is best for the guild. 
---
Also, reiterating your original point of rewarding those that put forth effort...  DKP/EPGP is hard and fast numerical value to who wins loot. There is no override or protection for the best interest of the guild as a whole.
---
So I started a warlock recently, I just reached level 10 and I am wondering a thing or 2 about pets.
---
Should I always use Voidwalker to tank in my place while leveling or can I keep my imp out without hindering my leveling experience. 
---
I like the blasty nature of the imp and I find them fun to have around. 
---
Also I'm interested in going demonology with the imp as my bestie. Would that be really bad ?
---
Because it's just wrong? I did the same and didn't spend any gold on anything except the necessary abilitys and I only had enough g because I specifically farmed for it...

---
Realm?
---
Yes and items sell for more
---
Becaise character progression is kinda the point of an RPG.
---
I'm not stupid. I'm jist saying we alrdy waste time playing a ge. More so by playing a revamped 1 at that. Nothing wrong with this. But tp furthermore jist waste ur time and energy making sure no one but u van farm one leather source.... it jist so ridiculous.  Like I said. I get the idea behind it. It's neat and funny. But why continue and continue its not literally gaining y anything u couldn't have gotten if not more by doing other shit. 
---
Imagine. ..just imagine if this effort was put into more positive things. Ppl farming massively together or clearing things or whatever the server needed. Guilds and more.
---
The only realms that have cross-realm enabled are completely dead realms, on my realm Stormwind and Org are both filled to the brim with people.
---
Pretty sure they are
---
Wrong. Read my other post. Or don't because you are clearly either A) trolling, or B) made up your mind already and only want to argue.
---
isnt it possible for the rogue to cc chain them to death with the right cooldown/ability usage and talents? double cold blood evis during stuns should down a clothie.
---
Yes, you'll get more gold instead of exp.
---
will take 200-240 hours for an average guy to reach 60 and attuned
---
If you lose durability you're losing both, though.
---
Except it isn't. Some people don't care what u have on, they expect you to not roll on THEIR BiS. I don't really care if its only my 2nd BiS and it's some randoms 1st, if its much better than my current piece im gonna take it. There are situations where I change my mind (if i like the group, the person seems really cool, etc).
---
Pick up enchanting and solo dungeons as Feral tank to DE all the drops.  I remember that worked well back in the day.
---
DW is the hard way to level. It‚Äôs literally worse in every way. You can‚Äôt even tank for shit because of no tactical mastery. It sucks for pvp, your instance dps will suck. You won‚Äôt be using whirlwind axe. Other warriors will see you dual wielding and laugh at you.
---
you don't know that words can have multiple meaning?
---
Your art was just expressive enough to really sell the story.
---
Does there have to make a thing that makes them bad? They just don't do as much damage as everyone else, not by a long shot. That's all.
---
Ashbringer EU here:
---
honestly, almost kinda disappointed in how calm STV is. I got ganked in STV like...twice?
---
In pservers like light's hope or nostalrius you would get killed every 10m if you were lucky. Nesigwary's camp was filled with corpses and the skeletons literally covered a large area around him to the point you couldn't see the ground. There were whole areas controlled by one faction or the other with literal shifting battle-lines.
---
It was like "we control the troll area so let's go do those quests. We can't really go to the tiger and raptor area though. A group of 10 allies is there and they are killing anything that approaches".
---
In comparison, 90% of players seem to ignore you, you don't need to constantly be in a group of 5 for protection etc.
---
When phase 2 hits, layers are lifted and honor is enabled, I guess this will change though.
---
Too many mages supporting each others addiction for money lulz. git gud filty casuls.
---
I just ran to desolace from shimmering flats through feralas. Never been to stonetalon. I got the FP in feralas and tanaris though. If i wanna fly from feralas to tanaris, it gous to auberdine, then theramore then tanaris. Basically circles the whole continent instead of going straight to tanaris.
---
Holy shit this is amazing. If that were me it would be all my previously farmed mats for my alt accounts professions.
---
Just give me the horsey...fuck my alts progression!
---
boomer = people born around 1990 and before in the context
---
If you use an imp instead of a voidwalker you will probably have a harder time leveling - I personally wouldn't let that influence your decision.
---
Dalaran (lag city) was always the most full city I've seen in my wow play time.
---
Yes. SS + WW on two mobs = 2 instant hits on each mob.
---
Entirely this. Unfortunately logs and screenshots can be faked and Blizzard will only take action on things done via their channels (aka in-game chat and Bnet)
---
It's a damn shame but it'd be a big step-up to start taking action based on evidence collected out of game and though I think the net effect would be positive it does open corridors for abuse.
---
All of the solutions you suggest do not work and are also against the rules of the game. Just let it go. Realize bots are banned in waves. You sound like you have problems managing your emotions
---
Dalaran was sex
---
But you're being elitist about this... I don't get it
---
I have a lvl 34 priest alt. I may have stripped them down to 2G to fund my main's mount lol.
---
Woah is that all the abilities rogues use even at that level? I have like 4 full bars for my level 43 warlock, lol (tbf one bar is pretty much all macros and food)
---
I agree it's definitely bursty and without a good proc my damage suffers. Pretty much every Forum/site I've read just say "ret paladins are bad" but don't actually elaborate on what that means. 
---
Community wise it's not great even leveling as ret, often I'm told "you will get booted if your damage is too low". But much to these elite groups surprise im usually 2nd or 3rd dps. 
---
It really feels like ret paladins being bad is more of a meme than anything.
---
Which pre-bis list is better overall?
---
 The first set is composed of Shadowcraft armor and seems better for PvP.
---
[https://sixtyupgrades.com/set/fqp5eZtQ4dnfFq735o6PuQ](https://sixtyupgrades.com/set/fqp5eZtQ4dnfFq735o6PuQ)
---
The second set is about the same as the wowhead pre-bis list ; it has a higher hit rating by sacrificing stats.
---
[https://sixtyupgrades.com/set/86WvxqsoKwgSDTqHfyisUH](https://sixtyupgrades.com/set/86WvxqsoKwgSDTqHfyisUH)
---
He will steal your shit.  Probably the reason he got kicked out of the guild.
---
Bro... same.
---
What have you been farming as Rogue? I need to make 200g asap.
---
I'd rather have tanks who take maters in their own hands and do the works instead of being babysitted by their guild like spoiled little children who go on tantrums when people don't do what they ask.
---
Aaand claimed by Avex inc.
---
very nice. Gona do this on druid and sneak as much as I can.
---
I can scarcely believe two female trolls both chose the ‚Äúpretty‚Äù face. And on the same server,even. Wow!
---
I suppose it's more of a what's the reason? Is it there spells? Rotations? Why am I doing so much damage if there just plain bad?
---
Frost is pvp...
---
I'll charge you 20 silver for the time it took me to answer your comment.
---
This is also on Skeram server with the guild ONSLAUGHT spearheading the operation. Same exact thing.
---
He's literally saying "Although I doubt it'll happen any time soon, implying that the chance of another dropping is very unlikely as a result of getting two so soon." But it's not, the chance of one dropping is equally unlikely as it was before.
---
I think you guys need 9% hit for raids so I‚Äôd say the second set but I could be wrong.
---
part of the fun lol
---
pve is pure glass cannon and includes more hit
---
use https://sixtyupgrades.com/ to build your own bis list with custom stat weighting based on what you want.
---
i saw not one but -two- mages using nova + blizzard on one single mob in WPL, at the same time in the same place. one mob per mage
---
wtf is in that mage water
---
Walked up to do the quest and saw 2 other people standing around waiting. Blew the horn tagged and killed the mob while being flamed and cussed at by the other 2 for stealing the spawn the had been waiting for. 
---
Was hilarious.
---
‚ÄúBut I think you‚Äôre needlessly confusing yourself with the percentages‚Äù 
---
Lol you seem to be the only one who is unable to get it. He understands the percentages just fine
---
It looks interesting but one thing I like to manage myself is aspect switching. Sometimes you just want to remove aspect without spending money on another aspect, say when kiting princess in maraudon for instance. There you need to turn off cheetah for a moment when you take damage before turning it on again. Having an aspect of the monkey in between just costs unnecessary mana and makes you farm slower
---
the have as someone said good burst damage with less sustain hence why their popular in pvp
---
‚ÄúI find myself not having much fun in a PUG unless I get a decent drop :D‚Äù
---
Why I don‚Äôt raid. Once that loot drops, everyone looses composure and wants it for themselves. 
---
0-100 real quick
---
Impossible to do that on a WPvP high population server.
---
So should I be looking for more stam and resistance then?
---
I guess you could say that one's a bit long in the tooth compared to the other?
---
Seems legit.
---
What if you never die in wow
---
Not our fault you didn't roll god class!
---
K this is amazing. Thank you. I learned a lot from this. I'll definitely try to do a round Robin system so that people get at least the chance to get something. But high value loot I will loot council/have limited people roll
---
i'm seeing a few war dps in my runs and as im a war tank it's a little bit aggravating since, if i pug, they will most likely be rolling on any decent tank gear as well. 
---
hasn't happened yet but i'm concerned.
---
\&gt;thinking I'm talking about literal boomers
---
30 yo boomer detected
---
Or a cloth and plate hybrid which completely takes away from the point of Paladin survivability.
---
i gave ur mom 4 o's
---
i played for 12 hours a day, grinding mob exclusively and it took me 2 weeks to get to 60. I got more gold for grinding mobs i get decent gear from AH. If you play 5-6 hours a day and you're not efficient with that 5-6 hours, it's gonna take you at least 2 months
---
If you spend 5-6 hours a day grinding mobs exclusively, you should hit 60 in a month.
---
You can sometimes go to molten core with meh gear since some raid group going MC late will just invite anybody to come to fill in the slot
---
ARMSTRING IS THE BEST WARRIOR ABILITY!
---
A warrior would get dazed and just die. Rogues can do it too with Evasion, but still a pain in the butt with the dazed effect.
---
Maintank &gt; Offtank usually.  
---
Even in pugs you can explain, that you dont have a guildraid and thus will be available for pugs in near future. This way you eventually start a new raidgroup yourself. Just make a discord-server and invite everyone who is pugging.  
---
Explain, that if you get enough people for a weekly raid, you will consider to get serious.
---
You seem like you now stuff about warriors, do people level as fury or respecc when they are 60? I'm 51 arms atm and not sure if I should switch to fury... I have the trasher blade but no second weapon
---
you‚Äôll spend a decent amount of time farming dungeons levels 50 - 60 to get your gear and good exp/hr, you‚Äôll most likely be ready by the time you hit 60. Works a lot better if you have a guild/ group of friends that you can farm BiS and exp in dungeons with. If you‚Äôre a dps I wouldn‚Äôt sweat it too much but for Tanks and Healers, You actually need a decent amount of +healing gear and tanks need Fire Resistance gear for MC. Worst case scenario, you get super unlucky with rolls during your leveling process and you‚Äôll need to farm a few BiS pieces you feel are necessary or that you feel will help a lot.
---
Learn what you use, get the rest after the mount
---
Do you have to pay for them?
---
They totally will. 
---
You realize that farming raid consumes is one of the only real downtime activities to do in Classic? Right?
---
Not after selling the book üôÉ
---
My servers pretty balanced
---
&gt;The potion lasts 2 minutes.
---
with a 2 mins cd.
---
They can also used a bow or gun though right? Definitely makes it harder but I do it with my low lvl rogue too to clear camps
---
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have any relevant knowledge but here‚Äôs some paragraphs of bullshit I felt like adding to the discussion‚Äù
---
He mightv lost the horn
---
I dont even understand why people do that, you can spend your money on much better things than freaking reddit awards. Guess theres a couple rich people on reddit
---
Yea I was going to suggest this and even the humanoids there drop a shit ton of greens and greys there as well. (stv) 
---
SM  GY for a priest is a little play ground and you can eventually duo with a buddy. I‚Äôm lvl 41 now but at lvl 36+ me and a warrior would farm the rare mobs in there while we wait for groups. 
---
Disc (imo) is better until high 30s (40). But shouldn‚Äôt make a big difference either way. 
---
(I put 7into shadow until i respect at 38)
---
I just got this yesterday
---
OR... ALTERNATIVELY... don't play ele so you can heal the warrior properly so he can wear DPS gear and do it all in 10 minutes instead of having to do all that nonsense at the end on the ledge back and forth :s
---
It‚Äôs not emphasising the raids though, it‚Äôs just bringing them up to a decent standard for 2019. Just making it so that you can‚Äôt kill the bosses in under 30 seconds would be a start...
---
It dropped for me in MC yesterday on EU-Morgraine Horde
---
Banish one, fear and dot the other. Maybe you can kill them solo.
---
All mana DPS are already expected to be pumping pots 100% of the fight. There isn't really anything you can do that isn't already expected of a competent mage or warlock.
---
This doesn't mean you can't be a ret pally. It'll be hard though if you want to do raid content. They're really just a labour of love for pvp.
---
Some people respec to healers for raiding so they can get their gear that way (so long as what they're asking for is found reasonable by the GMs).
---
I‚Äôm sorry, a bis OH thru naxx or bis oh till u get viskag, so tell me again who gets more usage out of felstriker, you sound like a warrior who is upset he can‚Äôt roll on corehound tooth because your raid has dagger rogues, it‚Äôs called a spec, only BS rogues use strictly daggers and great ones are few and far between, next.
---
on it. thanks
---
Don't worry, they'll be stuck marking us with skull/moon/cross and killing us 1 by 1 so we have nothing to fear
---
There are some nice things you can get. There's a very early head piece, you will be able to craft your own gun with special ammo which can be nice, although neither of these are particularly game changing. 
---
The more noticeable stuff will be bombs and dynamite which you can use for AoE stuns and burst, since a rogue completely lacks AoE damage unless you talent it in Combat. At around 85 you can create a Target Dummy to distract NPCs, around at 125 and 155 you can create a flame and ice deflector respectively which are elemental damage shields, and at 175 you can summon a Compact Harvest Reaper to act as a temporary pet. 
---
As early as 200 engineering you begin to see some of the really great PvP toys, in this case the cloaking device.
---
per title, they are cogs related to a quest nearby and move dynamically as i move around the area... not sure what addon is causing it (just re did my UI)
---
I was telling someone yesterday that back in vanilla and TBC there was no BiS lists and if there were they weren‚Äôt set in stone and most likely wrong and this is part of the reason why raids are so much easier now.. on top of mechanical skill.. am I right I‚Äôm saying this? Cuz when I used to play I never even heard the term BiS used but like I said that was 12 or so years ago and I couldn‚Äôt just be remembering wrong
---
For some reason the name being Biizzard really got me laughing.
---
I pretty much gave up before reaching level 60. I loved the nostalgia, but the groups for instances were absolute nightmares.
---
Following for answer. Have same problem.
---
Will I need to farm at max level? This is my first time reaching end game. The idea is that I can buff groups and raids in different ways. Most of the defenses I've picked aren't really meant for myself, Anticipation and Toughness are kind of fillers to get to the next talents (BoK and improved concentration).
---
Questie
---
Blizzard be like ‚ÄúDoN‚Äôt YoU gUyS hAvE gOLd tO bUy tHeM?‚Äù
---
The rolls are independent, but the actual question is - how likely that 2 guys will have the same thing drop in a row? Imagine you have a list of 10 people with a priority of getting a certain drop that is indeed independent in each case. Do you think the probability of the 10th guy to get that drop is the same as the first one? Are you going to tell the 10th guy that there's still 1% chance he'll get his thing?
---
That‚Äôs how many people farm princess. A fully broken cloth or is about a 3g repair bill. I don‚Äôt know how many times you‚Äôd need to die to reach a broken item but it‚Äôs more than 10.
---
I noticed that too - genuinely interested to hear what the reason is.
---
I BiS‚Äôd a girl and I liked it
---
My rogue life summed up in 2 paragraphs
---
Any particular option within questie?
---
Put your hand up on my BiS, when I BiS you BiS  we BiS
---
No you're right. BiS was never a thing, fury wars wearing leather wouldv been kicked for being ninjas, and most people clicked skills compared to the extreme macro optimization we have now. Very different. But, it's much more the skill aspect, considering guilds can clear these raids in greens just because of how much better the average player is now compared to back then.
---
Depends on the realm, I'm on a high pop realm and I NEVER see people who are cross realm, they only have cross realm enabled for dead realms.
---
using microsoft search and not google KEKW
---
Which one? What are your quest times like at prime time?
---
In vanilla I was the officer of a raiding guild and we did zero-sum DKP... it worked beautifully. 3 trouble/drama-free years of loot. Everyone was dripping in tier sets.  We even ran with free-for-all because we trusted each other, seems like an extinct concept.  Cleared through most of Naxx and played up through BC content too the same way.  A little overhead tracking it on a web site, but free market, you bid the points the item is worth, to you.
---
its gotta be bobs from fight club.
---
I did roll the god class of people who want to be nice and help others when they are in need of a tank? No problem, a heal? No problem. free of charge. Want to be buffed with the best buff in the game? Here it is improved with talents 5/5 free. 
---
Not of these people of greed selling stuff they get for free unlimited or these tanks who got geared up to the teeth by their guild and sell their services to run dungeon. How greedy is that?
---
Hey y‚Äôall remember Hong Kong?
---
Let it all out, pal.
---
Welcome to the streamer server, you dumb fuck. You knew exactly what to expect going in.
---
No you're right.  That first one lools like it's for soloing and pvp.
---
C'Thun was killed by multiple guilds the day it was fixed. By vanilla players that played on 10 fps and has limited knowledge about the game. It's easy for the players of today.
---
How are you undead then?
---
Nah zoomers stay home unemployed and play fortnite and retail wow all day, and can communicate entirely in twitch emotes
---
Boomers mark targets in wailing caverns with skull/moon, complain about spellcleave groups and how games just don't have soul anymore
---
r1 fireballs dot is extremely short
---
&gt;but in an encounter with actual mechanics it's just not better.
---
yeah having 2500 hp is no way to go through life!
---
Maybe since you literally said the same thing that was already posted...but incoherently.
---
Yeah, I wonder how the underlying system works because I've noticed a lot of 'the same' loot as other groups. As in, some bosses dropping EXACTLY the same drops as two or three other groups, and more than one boss in a run. Four guilds got their first binding all within 30 minutes of each other on my server two weeks ago. At least three of the groups also saw the warrior chest drop later in the dungeon alongside the mage sword...
---
There's a setting in the menus to specifically auto decline channel invites
---
The panel where the priest shows up is perfect!
---
How is it against the rules to aggro a bunch of mobs and feign death? 
---
I'd love to hear this
---
All but certainly. You'll want to do it so you can afford consumables for raids, so you can afford respecs if you choose to do that, so you can save up money for the materials to get your epic mount. You can of course chose to forgo all of this but that's up to you.
---

---
This is what changes I would personally make, it wouldn't mean you had to use a shield but when you were in World PvE farming I'd swap to a shield temporarily and use Blessing of Sanctuary.
---
In stv, fished up a mithril trunk that had 2 greens in it. One was a 2h sword, sold for 2g77s, the other was a cape that had 22 healing on it, sold for like 50s. So one catch got over 3g, which brought me up to 27g. Which means, at lvl 44, I have 63g to go.
---
Those guilds had all been grinding the fight for a while, they were experienced doing what had to be done.
---
Making your own is fine, you control who you don't and don't wanna play with. 
---
A community one tho? Neh
---
I'm a warlock main but I started a druid alt.  One of the classes I never really played before because I wanted to do something different.  I played nearly every class past 100 except druid and hunter.
---
Not really how Starter Pack memes work ok.
---
Just dinged 60 as a holy priest and I tried my hand at farming mara last night. I've seen videos of other holy priest soloing mara, but I cant for the live of me do it. I've seen hydra solo mara with no gear, so there is definitely hope for myself. I think my main problem is that she catches up to me and smacks me. I can usually bubble and tank a few hits but after 2-3 times this happens I usually wipe. Does anybody have any tips? Or any other money makers I can do as a holy priest. Professions are tailoring/enchanting btw. Thanks in advance!
---
Is that not just me drinking a V?
---
We live in a (capitalist) society
---
Just report and move on. Is it really bothering you THAT much that someone may or may not be using a 3rd party program to level their fishing? If so you have more issues than people using bots on wow....
---
A ret pally, even just by name, shouldn't even get to roll on gear tbh
---
Reserved is bullshit as well. Don't invite someone if you don't want them to roll on your item. Simple.
---
*Tldr: im angry that some people are more in demand than me!  So I‚Äôm going to pretend like they‚Äôre not!*
---
How are you people getting fishing past 150?! 
---
Ive refused to google it but i give up now, ive trained finding a trainer in SW, IF, Westfall, Duskwood, and Redridge and nada 
---
Im level 22 btw ..... been playing since launch lol
---
The pots are cheap but yes id assume you can howl of terror them and loot it too
---
Is it just me or does he lvl 60 have a bigger head?
---
The time is always being used, it's not a counter. If you are logged out for a week you will lose a week of time. Their is no other model of wow time, because you have to have retail wow to play classic.
---
Also Rogues usually get the opener. Let's not assume duel situation here. If a Rogue waits for his energy tick and goes ambush + backstab out of stealth that's a really shitty situation to start a fight for the mage.
---
Rogues can do so much shit to lock a mage down - if you manage to catch up to blind range after blink and apply kidney shot that's a lot of time of unavoidable damage - barring ice block which can be used to restealth or whatever. If the mage is not ready for an ambush the rogue might even get a CB evis off and the mage is just dead.
---
I totally agree with you on that mage vs rogue is super interesting and that people are totally oversimplifying it by saying frost mage counters melee. Rogues are slippery and have a lot of powerful tools.
---
I think the 60 is just a little closer to the camera
---
Dude actually thinks perception is as good as will of the forsaken.
---
Okay, so I probably misunderstood something I read. I remember someone saying he was important enough that they had a leash for him, but I could easily have read that wrong.
---
Not a hardcore guild. Hardcore guilds clear mc in an hour and give out loot to who needs it. Nobody complains because they are going to do it for the next 5 months and everyone will get everything eventually. It's not like you need the gear since you've cleared the hardest content already. And pvp isnt out yet so it doesnt really matter.
---
Meanwhile, basically all resto shammy pre-bis is from DM.
---
You actually think perception is as good as will of the forsaken?
---
if you block the invites you still get a pop up telling you that you were invited that you can right click on to report from
---
lmao @ the end where the tree warder waddles in
---
Dude actually thinks perception is as good as will of the forsaken
---
Sadly true. 
---
For every 200 savvy people there is 1 moron who will fall for it.
---
That still makes it worth it because the investment in the scam is originally zero.
---
Ba da Ching!
---
49 levels and the few extra points in stamina and strength you get by leveling and walking literally miles on end without mount.  
---
Also everything is trying to murder you. Oh, you didnt mean roleplay reasons? Well, I cant provide knowedge on dat.
---
&gt; Horde is doing just fine without Fear Ward 
---
Tremor Totem
---
It'd be bzzmers
---
I bet u/Asmongold is hitting himself for not being the first warrior on classic getting TF
---
It's a mix of retail players keeping their mentality in classic and the game being researched to the bone already and people accepting no less than the best
---
"I am you. But from the future.'
---
No eating his corpse? :-(
---
Anyway, pretty bold to gank a Rogue in STV. I hope you stalked him for the rest of the day.
---
This is the best answer.
---
I havent had anyone bad in the dungeons themselves, however that could be because im only still lvl 30 on my main character and have done upto gnomergan. I imagine the longer people play, the more frustrated they can eventually get with dungeon PUGs and eventually just get tired over the smallest things.
---
Just read the rules of the game. Training feeding etc are explicitly named. It‚Äôs in the rules. If you‚Äôd ‚Äúlove to hear this‚Äù then read the rules of the game which you agreed to abide by.
---
[Wow, good choice](https://youtu.be/utFRqsT61-k?t=32)
---
You can canalize in combat
---
I'm not telling them what to dom they can do whatever. I agree with both sides. It doesn't affect me. But it's just my point of view that I'm allowed to post. So sorry not sorry
---
I've seen a 5 man multiboxer farming hillsbrad fields do that on an Alliance warrior lol.

No that is more for feral dps to min-max.
---
There is a maul in Dire Maul that drops that is a decent alternative to Warden Staff.
---
You would be an ALLIANCE Rogue...
---
Found the aspiring MT who got pushed down to OT.
---
The one got the 'well fed' buff a little too often. (Sorry, that just came to my mind.)
---
I had used nine and a mage tagged it so I figured whatever I'll just use it again but no it has one charge so I had to abandon the quest, run back, get it again, run all the way back and kill it.
---
Just cuz this mage didn't wanna right click an item
---
As a Warlock, Mages are tasty treats too. Curse of tongues and gg. No fight after that. Blow your CDs keeping that succubus off you, corruption, Life Siphon, Immolate, and Drain Life will have you dead in about oh now
---
Are you aware you can download vanilla wow for free and make your own servers? It's easy!
---
AV fights have lasted full days, anything's possible
---
I'm on Area 52 and see plenty of people cross realm. Yours must just be the highest or something.
---
Drop it like a hot potato.
---
you don't want to find out when monkeyman on some backwater server gets his whirlwind axe? shame on you
---
Spot the guy who's never mained a healer.
---
I wonder if we will see the mythical female ogre...
---
Wrong flair. This is nostalgia not discussion.
---
The free transfers were out for a really long time. Why wait so long? Seems like a really bad decision. Should have not waited to the last moment. Stuff like this happens then. This is on you guys.
---
So by your rules, I should be banned because I FD'd to avoid a bunch of mobs and they aggroed onto the player doing a quest in the same area?
---
It's not required at all unless the following is true:
---
You're doing feral DPS most of the time in raids
---
You're playing with elitist dick swinging try hards
---
Just find a non bleeding edge elitist guild and you will be fine with a good stat stick with agi/stam
---
&gt;Reminds me of Athene. Just without the part where he literally turns into a weird cult leader.
---
Who wouldnt want to be in a cult lead by the guy who invented stepping out of LoS around corners?
---
Amazing!
---
I was thinking the same thing.  I‚Äôm a holy priest and I have a slow go at farming/killing things for money so I think an herbalism prof would be easy money
---
Yeah man its ghostly strike, then sinister spam until i get a riposte or 5 combo points for that fat evis
---
You'd be just cheating on yourself ;)
---
Yea I‚Äôm having similar thoughts.
---
I‚Äôm at the point where I can‚Äôt progress without relying on other people and that has seriously stalled my progression and interest. 
---
I had a great time leveling to 60, but I‚Äôm not really having fun with the end-game content and the greed of the community has really soured my enjoyment. 
---
A couple months later and I think I‚Äôve had my fill. I enjoyed the game, but it‚Äôs too much of a time sink for me to play long term and I‚Äôm burned out so this feels like a good place to end. I won‚Äôt be renewing my subscription after this month is up.
---
Is this happening on multiple computers?  Do you have any other internet problems?  Have you tried a reinstall of WoW including the Blizzard app?  What error message are you getting, if any?
---
Oh, it's a really great zone. Especially on a PvP server... absolutely love Un'goro
---
Your posting policy is shitpost huh
---
That doesn't make it ok to waste other people's time. I'm not saying it's the end of the world. Just that I'd also make sure to never group with someone like that again.
---
Trying to get them blacklisted from others the s extreme though
---
Fair. It did make me happy last night
---
That makes me happy, during my first week of playing I met really nice people willing to help but now, a month later, kindness and patience is a rare commodity. I've rerolled prot paladin and am honestly scared to death to tank dungeons.
---
Your description hits too close to home except I‚Äôm not in my 60s yet.
---
Druids can do stealth tribute runs solo, but I think it works out to be faster if you duo with a rogue, however idk what rogue would let go of the low effort autopilot pickpocketing+Netflix to do DM.
---
And I need it for gold.
---
I've seen your art of and on in this sub and we play pretty much the same character.  I also think it's funny that we have been pretty much the same levels so i totally get all the comments you make in them.  That said.  Yes.  I'm level 39 right now and am so close to getting the mount only because everything else sucks.
---
I can‚Äôt believe after all these years there isn‚Äôt an addon that tracks DKP automatically for you?
---
Yeah I‚Äôve thought about this. The PvP is the whole reason I play the game, but at this rate by the time bgs get released I‚Äôm gonna be so far behind on gear I‚Äôm just gonna get rolled and it won‚Äôt even be fun
---
I'm on the alliance side of grob so I can't speak to the level of RP but 100% horde are active af on grob
---
I really enjoy the status update drawings of your character :)
---
Pics or it didn't happen.
---
This post kust shows a lack of pvp experience, especially since you think WotF is more OP than passive 30% stun resist.
---
I'm old as fuck and ruined by instant gratification of the modern world.
---
Hey I‚Äôm in Fusion and we‚Äôre always looking for people. Just message someone and I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll put you into contact with the right people.
---
I mean yea but it's also kind of a short DoT. It can be a nice bonus if the rogue fucks up but I wouldn't bank on that happening.
---
My plan was to do holy with ret specs (but heavy holy for all the excellent advantages)
---
The free mana pot makes it different
---
Someone turned me onto the secret. Can do 2 same level mobs no problem:
---
Sweeping strikes
---
Stance dance to berserker
---
Whirlwind
---
Dance to battle
---
Cleave
---
Dance back when whirlwind is off CD
---
Since i started doing that I have been flying with leveling.
---
Humanoids that run are still a pain in the ass (I‚Äôm looking at you, trolls in STV).
---
What is that threat add-on and is on t better than details tiny threat?
---
Yes this is happening on 3 separate computers, we have tried reinstalling WoW and the app on all of those computers as well.  No other internet issues. We get error message 51900328 / 51900319 upon getting disconnected. Still no luck. Thanks for the reply btw!!
---
Can we ban posts that complain about other posts? Just downvote and move on.
---
UNLESS it was freely cast through the elemental talent (clear casting?) the one that makes the offensive spell cost no mana to cast, that will not interrupt the 5 second rule
---
Not that I know of.
---
That's a tough one because you kinda use everything you have as a shaman. But you can do things like avoid upgrading any weak spells that you never use, upgrade only your strongest slowest healing spell, and only buy totems you're going to use.
---
I consider myself a good Mage and never attack someone unless they attack me. I would definitely never attack someone lower level than me.
---
you could easily cut pretty much any class down to 7 days /played being generous. I did 60 in exactly 7 days while playing spaced out of my fucking mind on lack of sleep and a lot of afking in cities
---
Couldn't say if there's anything "critical" pallies need to heal outside the holy tree. But if you want to heal for raids no one will be unhappy.
---
Thanks for the advice. I play on Atiesh
---
There is now, back then it wasn‚Äôt as easy.
---
Once I replied to a very old comment I made myself with another nickname I did not recognize. I still feel ashamed..
---
Thats fine though, rings and amulet is always probably the worse things you can get away with especially in classic.
---
Your opinion is valid. I reluctantly joined my guild's MC run last week, we wiped 3 times on like the third boss, I hearthed, made up an excuse and got the hell out of there. 10 minutes later I was in org leveling an alt. Leveling MUCH more fun imo, I think you should try leveling an alt instead of grinding end game.
---
Not for current content. It is BiS for a druid tank that needs to build threat quickly so your DPS can go hard asap therefore any boss that is a dps race (like 2nd boss in BWL) it will be useful. I'm 1st OT in my guild and I use warden for the mitigation. Not even running full tank build and I have no threat issues on bosses so you have some threat improving levers to play with before being forced to farm Gnomer weekly.
---
Boomer/zoomer are states of mind my friend, actual age is meaningless :)
---
You do lose the CPs, but its quality of life to use mouseover macros for gouge, blind, and kick.
---
Why not just a "/s attack now" and press when you feel it's okay.
---
I enjoy the burst damage but healing is pretty fun as a pally as well
---
Priest, just make sure he lets you get the last hit on enemies, and you should have 0 downtime, zero mana issues.
---
That way he can drink when he needs to and you just keep the tempo going
---
To expand on this question, do most people hit 60 with lots of quests to do still? I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a LOT of quests but I really don‚Äôt know how many and if it‚Äôs normal for players to get like 100% quest completion or something similar.
---
Especially later on when your dots (agony and corruption mainly) scale 100% with it.  
---
You tell me, my corruption deals 1000 damage? My agony even more..? That must be broken!  
---
If lowlevel alliance players annoy me (hunter was using freeze trap on me while I was hearthing), I apply all my dots and see if he survives (he can pot, eat, whatever), I let him life. If not.. its their fault with messing with me.  
---
But I am always impressed by the healthpool by some lvl 49-54 classes.
---
95% of female trolls have that face. It's the only "pretty" one. All the other 4 or 5 options are like an old, crusty swamp witch face.
---
I just wish that blocked the damn text chat, too. Every time I look at chat I have a message that says "[random name] has invited you to the MYWOWGOLDDOTCOM chat. We blocked this message because you have chat invites turned off."
---
Thanks. Now can you also block that stupid message, too?
---
I've been dcing from wow a shit ton as well, like every 30 minutes or so. But everything else I use internet for is just fine.
---
Wait wait wait... there‚Äôs a hole in the wall next to the gate?? Has this always been there? All these years I‚Äôve never noticed this.
---
The first unlikely event (drop #1) already happened, so it's no longer relevant to the statistics. All of the other outcomes where the boss failed to drop the first binding did not happen.
---
The only time that the "2 drops in a row" thing is relevant is when you haven't attempted to get either drop yet.
---
Anyone here knows how to make whisper not appear in a new tab?
---
I wanted them to a while ago, but now i cant seem to reverse it
---
Is this your king?
---
Yes exactly my problem! But not really because I make it about 15 seconds then a DC haha.
---
I think this never happened and you're 11 years old.
---
Nobody is so naive that they woukd be this conflicted over something so obvious.
---
Earlier patches had less quests so yes you would hit a point where you needed to grind
---
In classic i think it's beneficial to grind here and there to speed things up, but if you really want to only quest there's enough just be prepared to get like 1/3 of a level in this zone then jump over and get some xp here then jump over and get some here etc.
---
Personally I just do the yellow quests i have in a zone then grind out the missing xp then ding do the orange then move on and repeat.
---
Ret pally (and same thing with shaman) dps isnt an issue for dungeons its actually quite good for those. 
---
Their issues lies in Raids and how much better other classes scale with raid buffs/ debuffs and talents vs raid bosses.
---
Tell me how, because I tried fighting a mage that was lvl 40 when I was 41 and I couldn't kill him. Sure, he couldn't keep up with me to kill me, but between his ice barrier constantly freezing me and him blinking/kiting and me blowing through all my mana to unsnare, I couldn't do shit.
---
But nobody beat pre nerf cthun so that arguement is invalid
---
No part of this post has a mage asking for a tip to make water
---
When you are 55 you run BRD, when you hit 57 you run LBRS, do a couple of UBRS for rend quest and a chance at Briarwood Reed and you can hit 60 very close to full pre raid BIS. I also farmed satyrs to get enough cloth to craft a pre raid BIS robe on the way. Hit MC the day I dinged 60 and that was last Monday. Played as many evenings as I could ~4h; played a lot on the weekends but did take a week (2 weekends vacation) so all in all I'd say it takes about a month.
---
GDKP has won me over.
---
It DOES require a moderate wealth average for the raiders but you can start with low numbers around d 50g if need be.
---
Pros- No need for spreadsheets or addons, people who cant afford bids right away will leave with a good chunk of gold in their pocket for next time, it can be eschewed very easily without pissing off too many people to a LC for specific drops, and you can allow PUG players to join hassle free
---
Cons- Some folks dont like buying their gear, even if they end up with a rebate at the end of a raid, people who drop mid raid and need replacements will not get a payout, and as I mentioned before it does require at least some decent sum of gold per player to be fair
---
Is that near the small camp with a fishing pool? You can get there if so and if you fish in the pool it gives you peacebloom.
---
Despite mages being one of the two classes that can remove curses and most of their damage being instant cast anyways?  lol  Warlocks have plenty of tools to stand ground against mages but cot is extremely situational.
---
4chan meme about young people playing fortnite and listening to rap, Boomer is drinking monster and playing doom.
---
This eventually got picked up by twitch and is a frequent meme used by streamer Asmongold and such.
---
I personally thought it was funny now it's just annoying
---
So realistically it should be "Ret have high dps  until endgame"
---
Why corpse run? Just log out in dungeon and have someone reset (or have alt in party to do it). You come back at the start of a reset instance
---
Unless you are lucky with rare recipes none of the crafting ones really grant you money from what Ive seen. It's not for a casual player. I'd recommend just doing herbalism. It's just OK money, but end game keep in mind pots are always being used so the herbs sell.
---
Let me tell you about Blink. Blink removes stuns and teleports you 20 yards away.
---
good guide but one question, wdym lava jumping is hard in classic? just spam the space bar as fast as you can tahts all it takes, at least on a p server, once I realized that I felt like an idiot for buying fire prot pots. I didn't take any damage just doing that method, tho maybe with the classic cline twhich is based on retail its not as easy idk
---
You beat me to it, such an odd fishing spot with odd "fish" but it's rather neat.
---
What a useful comment this was
---
That's pretty cool :D
---
Well they certainly do well in naxx. Having access to exorcism/holy wrath is nice for dps.
---
A hunter really should pass on Dalrends though. It‚Äôs really not even that good for them and it is amazing for warriors/rogues.
---
No need to have second account, just have someone invite your alt to party, log out and wait 2 mins for lead to pass and reset.
---
Passives have a decided advantage over actives however, because they cannot be misused.  WotF won't be much help on cooldown, and the Alliance will eventually get the pvp trinket that works on all CC and not just a select few.
---
Someone ban this bot
---
That was my thought exactly but it's good to understand that it's a sustained damage that's the problem and not that RET is bad in general. Completed a run of ZF last night with another Ret and we were both top for all boss encounters, dropping off during the temple fight.
---
no amount of tryharding or loot funnelling can guarentee you to be the first person to get TF. It's an entirely unrealistic goal for someone that doesn't have the ability to just poof the items into existence.
---
Wouldn't auto-looting green/blues drops with ML on result in the same prompt as if you right-clicked on them? Obviously people should be careful about using it, but it seems like it would be trying to do the same action (looting) which would prompt the same response (bringing up the list of players)
---
Yeah, well fuck you too
---
Not sure if blinking through tight aggro spots and novaing a big group of mobs constitutes as "any class".
---
From the video it looks like some classes could get in serious trouble trying to get to the lava.
---
Asmon. gets funneled and carried through everything and is doing mental gymnastics on how being babied didn‚Äôt make him the best.
---
Use the imp dude it works just fine. I ended up drain tanking and using the succubus but the imp is totally fine for leveling and you use it in dungeons anyway.
---
Lol. "Work your rear end off to get nothing" is exactly what happens with the classic rank system if you don't hit the threshold for the next rank. Even if you participate in your servers rank 14 mafia you'll still get destroyed in pvp by people with AQ/Naxx gear.
---
Careful, blizzard might ban you now.
---
is core-hound belt in the game? wowhead says phase 3, druid BIS says its in now
---
Yep, looks like he uses the same spot I used on private servers
---
https://puu.sh/EttTx/ce9debe6d2.jpg
---
Although 1 lasher pack still pulled afterward.
---
... no one has the first TF yet. The instance to obtain hasn't been released. Anyone could get the first one still.
---
the same items that are bus for pve are bis for pvp for the same reasons - top dps
---
store mounts
---
It‚Äôs a great pvp hot spot.
---
The sad part is that anyone can become a moron after the 5th night of a sleepless baby and just trying to get a small break from responsibilities after a tough day at work with only 6 collective hours of sleep across those 5 days.
---
That weapon sucks, but cool quest.
---
Replace with what for hunters?
---
I've done a few more runs than you in about as many days. Haven't seen any of those either. Just gotta keep fanning the flame of hope!
---
I did see the healing trinket from Golemlord but that's all. I'm really growing to hate a certain specific mail chest and leather kilt
---
So this has nothing to do with the general vanilla experience and everything to do with you being loot focused. I will say that players like you are not uncommon, we average 1 gquit per week due to loot. It is the reason I love priority loot allocation, it gets rid of loot focused players who cause drama and leaves behind people focused on the greater goal of clearing content which is going to be critical in AQ / Naxx.
---
A good mage is now going global for global with me as I reapply that and my succubus is whacking the everliving fuck out of them.
---
On retail. I play Tich.
---
That's an ad hominem.  When you don't have any argument why even bother?
---
The warrior discord has had all this data for weeks.
---
It's more like a large scale inconvenience. If you just wanted to do Dire Maul, all that "world pvp" of spamming aoe at the entrance of a dungeon is nothing but an inconvenience. Of course hardly any of the pvp servers are balanced, so there's always one faction that can barely play the game, and one faction just stomping over everyone else, so if that's what you enjoy from world pvp, WoW has that in spades. Anyone that cares about their time should roll PvE and wait for battlegrounds.
---
Why don't we make our own rules in the game then? Is it the only way to help other people only if they pay you?
---
Ahhh so you are from the pedantic school of pointless clarification. Well have fun with it then.
---
Using mumble in 2019 OMEGALUL. Even if you "prefer" it. You still need discord for everything else. Stop living in the past and come back 2019 lol
---
Hunters do yes, and as far as I remember you can use that spell, move your pet, then select the 'Wait' spell on your pet's bar (whatever the 3rd button is called, the one after attack and follow) before dropping the spell. The pet should stay where you left it
---
Wow I had no idea priests could do mind control.
---
Lol
---
You don't have an argument either though
---
Yeah idk which phase it's in. I just know it's in the future
---
I agree with you. To be fair, one major difference from back then is that now people are obsessed with BiS. People not only theorycrafted it a lot; they theorycrafted the fun out of it. 
---
Everyone is after the same pieces and stuff. Back then, DKP was a lot more important than now. And people were running instances they like for better gear but much less of an obsession about *that* particular loot.
---
I'm loving it but min-maxers ruined a lot of it. They say they can enjoy the game how they want but their way of having fun impacted the community for the worst.
---
It's definitely not in a mages best interest to be going global for global against a lock. Welcome to insta fear land. I will reapply curse of tongues every time you remove it.
---
I agree with all but the solo mob CoC. Especially if you're going to drink anyway, CoC is just a replacement for Fire Blast in most cases.
---
I don't see a great reason for shadow priests to drop shadow form because the cost of going back into it is 45% base mana right? So, would probably need to do that if you're in dire need.
---
As a shadow priest managing mana is important so i'd assume down ranking spells plays a big role in that.
---
Guide slaves are just so obnoxious. All the work is done for them and they act like a hotshot.
---
Insect swarm is useless because there aren't enough debuff slots to use it.
---
On my warlock i had half pre-bis gear when i hit 60. Plus the MC trash wrist i bought from AH and a couple of hundred gold saved to get the MC trash belt as well. 
---
If you think getting pre-bis requires hundreds of hours, you just support my argument that twinks are lazy / bad players who can't compete at max level and settle to a lower level to be able to win something.
---
I dont wats goin with reddit but it aint editting my comments when I use the edit function, was suppose to say "I dont know what else to say" before the last paragraph....

What‚Äôs proper etiquette when the tank and healer insist on skipping the bosses that DPS need loot from? Our DPS in Scholo was 2 locks and an s priest but they skipped Vectus and Deathknight because they wanted to ‚Äúget out of there as soon as possible‚Äù

If I had bothered to set up my recording shit I would have a pretty good highlight reel of people starting shit with me and getting embarrassed. Something about playing a rogue brings out the idiots who start shit and suck at it.

No I‚Äôm still in the guild actually lol because I haven‚Äôt even been playing now. After I told him he was clearly wrong and the proof was right in front of his face he just stopped replying and ignored the issue. After that raid was finished I logged out and have lost all interest in even logging in again.

I‚Äôm a lvl 34 rogue and I‚Äôve played without any add ons at all and I like it plenty and have zero problems. However, I‚Äôve considered getting an auction house one for convenience and the cast bar one to better know when to kick a mage in the balls to help my tanks. I never wanted to use Questie but now eventually I might and turn off the objective markers like u/Xhukari explained. Also, my guild requires a couple, mainly Bossmods, to do raids. I‚Äôd rather not use them but my guild is great and if that‚Äôs what they want then I‚Äôll definitely install it when the time comes. Other than that I‚Äôd just recommend whatever works best and feels good for you.
---
I'm a lvl 42 mage and slowly training up tailoring. I will eventually need the robe of the archmage so should I buy the pattern and parts now before the price increases or it is relatively easy to find the things I need when I reach lvl 60? Atm the pattern has dropped from 150g to around 60/70g.onn my server
---
Can be, or it can be just as useless as any other racial with improper use.
---
This is a good strategy. Check the levelling guides on wowhead, many will tell you which spells to get and which to skip to maximise gold at 40. The shaman one definitely does this
---
Dr. Dre maul

Relax man. He's looking for a different way to play an old game. A bit more difficult? Yeah, but it's a unique experience and I'm glad to see people have still found ways to overcome the World of EverQuest mentality

But druid LMAO no wonder you angry

You okay man?

T1 is garbage for most* classes. In many cases it's actually far better optimized for pvp.
---
For example, for shaman the only piece worth using for healing is the helmet. But the entire set is very high up on the quality chart for pvp where beastly raw stats are more important than equip bonuses.
---
Higher tiers don't suffer this issue. But you might be seeing people in pvp gear.

---
Never do it with people you don't absolutely trust.

I've done it a couple times but only with absolutely amazing people who I trust cherish playing with me more than robbing my account. You know that guy for like a month now, he should fuck right off. How fucking rude to say that you're selfish. It's rude to even suggest that at this point but to get mad over rejection just takes the piss.
---
I just downloaded the twitch app and it was very easy! At first, it only recognized retail when selecting WoW. I had to let it scan for other games by pressing the gear to the right. Then, it was easy! Everything worked very simply from there on out.
---
Rofl and I'm the inexperienced one. 
---
Please explain to me how perception is as good as a CC breaker.
---
I‚Äôve read people don‚Äôt really want DPS Warriors, and tanking often seems like an incredible hassle to be honest. I love to tank when it‚Äôs five mans and I‚Äôm leveling but I‚Äôm unsure if I want to end game.
---
Do you think I‚Äôll have trouble as a DPS/off tank warrior?
---
get auctionator add-on and do a scan of the auction house and it'll tell you what it's worth on your server.
---
I didn‚Äôt really explain it that well. Depending on what rarity you set ML to you will still prompt need/greed rolls. So if it‚Äôs set to greens you‚Äôll dictate greens and up, blue would be blue and up so on and so forth. So if you don‚Äôt want to sweat greens and blues set the rarity in ML to epic. Make sense?
---
Yep - genuine question so unsure of why downvotes.
---
How easy is it to get though? Whats the %; who else rolls? Is it the class trinkett?
---
Cheeky bastard trying to take advantage. He has no right whatsoever. Time to cut him off.
---
Wowhead is free of charge so someone (else) has got to do all the work.
---
The thing is though that Blizzard was relatively hands off for a majority of vanilla content during 2.0-2.2. Most of the things that saw changes were in class design, talents, and the obvious inclusion of the opposite faction class to your own. However come 2.3, an extensive amount of the vanilla content was changed. Reduced levels for mobs/bosses in dungeons, readjusting of vanilla dungeon gear, reduced experience requirements, removal of a large amount of outdoor world elites, etc.
---
Patch 2.0 comments about vanilla content are likely far more accurate than a lot of the vanilla private servers over the years. But definitely as time moves beyond the initial launch of TBC, while more and more undocumented fixes go unnoticed that certainly makes said posts have less credibility to talk the old content. 
---
Lastly, I don‚Äôt know about you or most people, but I just tend to view such old comments as museum pieces. I don‚Äôt care whether they are right or wrong, I am just happy that they exist again for us see. And said comments need to be taken with a grain of salt anyways. Because even though we are playing vanilla content, the structure of classic (static in nature but progressive content unveiling) is not entirely like vanilla when it was retail. Those comments are made with imperfect knowledge of the time, and depending on the patch, rather different class design. And that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt take those words of old as being relevant to my current play experience.
---
For a situational 30 min CD, nope
---
Sadly. Now you need to reroll to undead
---
Oh god a multiboxing post. These almost always lead to a shitshow in the comments
---
New org though. Gross... Why they fucking ruined I‚Äôll never understand.

You ok man? Do you wanna talk about it?

Is it recommended to actually invest in the expensive Enchanting recipes? So many people have it, its hard to imagine one getting a good return from them...
---
I‚Äôm stuck at 58 lol, I just can‚Äôt seem to block off ~2 hrs uninterrupted anymore to run a dungeon. I end up sitting in a city looking at LFG chat for a little bit and then log off :(
---
Did you run out of thread on the fourth one?
---
Looks like you just shoved his whole head in.
---
It does, that's not what I was addressing though. I was asking if auto-looting would automatically give yourself the items rather than prompting the list of people you can give it to. Essentially, is it actually possible to auto-loot and accidentally take the items as a master looter or does the game give you a confirmation first?
---
Somehow my server is a total carebear server. I'm kind of a carebear myself. Now Blackrock is a war zone and everyone who enters there knows what they're getting into but out in the world people usually just wanna get their shit done and not start a war that will ultimately hinder their progress.
---
based
---
You clearly have no idea how coding or software development works. Something being ‚Äúhard coded‚Äù (whatever you‚Äôre trying to say there, in going to assume you mean coded in a way that‚Äôs difficult to change) doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt dig in and figure out how it works, it simply takes more time. 
---
There is ZERO chance emulated servers were able to recreate things as accurately as blizzard.
---
Well I dont understand why people were in such a rush to hit 60. It isn't like Classic is going anywhere. As long as you keep pace with the phases I dont see the point in rushing.
---
I think Warriors and Rogues disagree hard here
---
Don't join a group that has a reserve list.  Simple.
---
The average person still has no Idea that they‚Äôre even a thing. We‚Äôre hyper aware of them here, but they‚Äôre a teeny tiny part of the overall wow population.  Blizzard really doesn‚Äôt pay as much attention to them as you‚Äôd think.
---
They‚Äôre shitters for it but they are the hard rolls to find. You could obviously say nah I need this boss I‚Äôm not moving on without them and hope your dps agree, then you put them in the predicament to replace you or do the boss. If they declared prior to going in they were going to skip them then that‚Äôs on you, if not then it‚Äôs a dick move and I‚Äôd stand my ground personally and just wait to get kicked or do the boss. Also never trust ‚Äúwe‚Äôll do them after‚Äù imo.
---
I had the same question. Thanks for answering and OP thanks for asking.
---
I'm fine lol I don't play on streamer server so it doesn't bother me. Funny that people think this behaviour is universal when its only on the servers overwhelmed with manchildren and edgy twitch kiddies hmmm
---
Damn if you are this much of a pushover can i share your personal bank account?  
---
Yes i am a random stranger but it would be selfish of you to keep all your money to yourself
---
All the free light leather q_q

Nice Bullshit.

When you actually play human in classic you'll learn why perception is useless when compared to cc breakers or stun resist.
---
Lol yep.

But Reddit also loves shit like /r/communism and pretend that all the issues with totalitarian regimes is entirely capitalist propaganda.
---
Too few drops in raids is my issue with the game
---
I mean if theyre at least useful for something thats cool
---
True, but is spirit ress camping the same? The only thing you can do is either run to another zone by knowing where the spirit ressers are or log out.
---
I'm Horde on Stalagg but I feel for ya man. It's kinda sad. Even in higher level contested zones its easily 6:1. I hardly ever see Alliance and when I do, I don't even bother with ganking because it feels dirty. 
---
Everyone was clamoring for a census and found out that there was a slight imbalance so a ton of Alliance fled to Hearseeker which is now overwhelmingly Alliance. Now both servers are imbalanced.
---
Who throw tantrums? Like the one you‚Äôre throwing now..?
---
Shankngank, guild Degenerates,on Destromath.  You only smell bullshit because you're spewing it.
---
Sweeeeet thank you
---
Screw your so-called "friends" and roll the Night Elf you were destined to play.
---
Ditto.
---
Mages really are drinking what vanila hunters did back in the day.
---
It just depends how much grinding you did between questing. If all you did was quest and did not grind at all you might have a hard time finding quests efficiently.
---
Reserving happened in Vanilla.  Maybe not as prevalent as now but it definitely existed for all top end dungeons.
---
ZF/DMN/DMT
---
As aoe farm mage you will want to farm a set of gear specifically for aoe farming. High int/stam gear, such as necropile or magister set, or *of the eagle* greens. 
---
Spelldamage is not relevant when ur blizzarding/using AE, as it scales very poorly with aoe spells.
---
For example in my raid set i have around 2500hp and 5k mana, along with 300+sp whereas in my farm set i have 3400hp, 6300 mana and 120 or so sp.
---
Having more mana/hp makes aoe grinding a lot easier
---
And shortly after was traded to the warrior or rogue.. good trick
---
Faster offhand = more poison procs, they are not PPM, as far as I know.
---
Thanks!
---
Spending money lol
---
Hey guys in a pickle...I dinged 60 on my NE Hunter and it felt as empty as what happened...literally nothing no one on my guild on spamming for a solid hour in chat just to get a dungeon I feel super unhappy have zero fun socially 
---
I‚Äôve been thinking of packing up and rerolling a orc shaman just because it‚Äôs the opposite of what I have tried 
---
What do you think is it worth trying to start over to find a social group or just keep trying to play my hunter with no one? I‚Äôve tried almost 4 guilds so far with no luck...how did y‚Äôall find a group?
---
WC is great, about a month ago me and my friend met this mage during a wc run. We still invite him along to do stuff at 60 and consider him a friend.
---
You guys are saying this shit all day until your BiS +Healing Item gets needed by a Hunter for his PetHealEq.
---
I didn‚Äôt blink through any pack that you need to use blink to avoid. You can get to the jump spot without aggroing a single mob (except the 2 fireguards at the end but they‚Äôre next to the jump and as you jump they drop aggro).
---
u/pepetopdeck downvote this one please mr no changes!
---
tinypic as well.
---
Yeah, on private server it works by just spamming. If you try that on classic it won‚Äôt work!
---
Not sure if he strictly streams, but I live Frostradamus' videos on YouTube!
---
Yes! But that‚Äôs the only gate you can skip using that method :(
---
Yes yes we know, me oof smash and all.
---
I'm playing the long game. Just accumulating items that will be in demand next phase but selling cheap now. Right now have loads of pristine diamonds and larval acid that I bought before DM announce. A lot of it is guess work, reading what is coming in P2 / P3, will it be popular, what mats are related to it. 
---
I sell 1 devilsaur leg every couple days that gives me 20g profit which is not bad for a few mins work but it's low turnover so not going to make me rich.
---
I mean, like literally and GM worth their salt will put an end to this real quick.
---
I'm not sure if it does happen or if it's a common occurrence but the logic behind it does make sense. If they automatically detect your account is logged in from a unknown location it could be temporarily suspended or disabled because they don't know if the person using the account from this previously unknown location is actually you or a hacker who has your credentials. Also you should know public wifi's especially at coffee houses are extremely risky to be logging into anything on, especially the public PC's in similar locations.
---
Wow
---
You seem to forget that Blizzard doesn't have to prove anything. If they think you're being fishy its fully within their rights to just out right ban you. Its in the ToS you signed when you made your account.
---
Be heavily suspicious of anyone making claims like that imo. Many times it has been legit bans that they were trying to get overturned by community pressure.
---
It has only "happened" maybe 2 times according to posts. Pretty likely it's bullshit and they were up to no good.
---
Saying spez as an edit comes directly from The_Donald, just fyi
---
Just put the guide in its own addon folder and load it at the add-ons menu. Once in game right click Guidelime and set your guide
---
Weakauras just seta up UI indicators based on whatever condition you want. Ao it can do it as long as you set it up
---
Depends on where the ip is
---
ahhh I see
---
The real LPT is in the comments
---
Stacking resistance is only helpful for planned 1v1. Maybe your good buddy is a priest that always duels you. Could be helpful to get a shadow resistance set just to duel him. Or maybe you find yourself dueling a lot of mages and can look at Fire and Frost resistance.
---
In general PvP though, you can just ignore resistance for the most part and stack more stamina/stats.
---
&gt; Don't join a group that has a reserve list. Simple.
---
this is how its done.
---
Anyone minds clarifying wtf is "elitist" about giving additional information? Or is any comment containing the term "bis list" elitist by default?
---
&gt; If I see another imageshack link....
---
I saw a image link for a image hosted on MySpace the other day.
---
Going for that Classic experience.
---
No. Blink frees from stuns
---
Bozmers actually, which are similar but legally distinct from the wood elves from the Elder Scrolls series.

Nope, questie just isn't that great of an addon not content wise or coded

I'm not sure if I'm allowed to reply thx to everyone, so I'll say it once. :)

Thx everyone. :)

It's weird that it turns green if it's in the middle.

"*Onyxia was easy with 5 level 70s.*"
---
Do note, for stupid solo shit consumables are a common thing. Pot that cleanses you ever 5 seconds for 30 seconds would likely help.
---
Again I'd imagine mana would be an issue
---
What's the song and artist?
---
how could they possibly enforce that when people use vpns all the time? sounds like complete bullshit.
---
Question about Mage/warlock equipment. I have an Icicle Rod that 
---
"Increases damage done by Frost spells and effects by up to 10".
---
Does this mean that 10 damage specifically is added to my frost spells or is this some sort of a modifier? Would it be better for me to use my Emberstone Staff that provides significantly more Intellect? 10 damage doesn't seem like a whole lot.
---
Furthermore, is this the same for the other elements (ie damage done by fire/arcane/shadow etc)?
---
Thanks
---
The problem is that tryhards end up imposing a meta and atmosphere to the game that casuals don't. Seriously, the obsession about BiS is getting really fucking annoying.
---
Makes sense! Thanks
---
I wouldn't use it for trash. Only boss I've used any on so far is Onyxia, although I do have more for Ragnaros. But for most MC bosses, and especially for the trash, don't need any potions unless you're messing up.
---
That‚Äôs dmg for deadmines guy
---
You realize that there were buggy "mechanics" in original C'Thun that have absolutely nothing to do with dps threshholds right? I'm curious how you intend to deal with tentacles spawning in the stomach and inside walls where they cannot be killed. Or lethal fall damage. It's not a problem you can just throw more dps at.
---
People are already making twinks for every level bracket. 10-19 is going to be almost all twinks. What do you mean not ready lol
---
I imagine it would more be bans from using VPNs not just other IPs in your local area.
---
r/ihavesex
---
Priest and pally will get priority, but you should still be able to get a spot in a raid as a Druid pretty easily.
---
God forbid people get excited about a game.
---
Wrists are bis for pvp
---
No but Worgen are, despite being a playable race in Cata.
---
Contested Leveling zones (searing gorge, stv. Etc.) Will be a camped nightmare on the release of honor and pvp. Some people would like the time the currently planned release date gives them to level. To try and aviod/take part in the fun part
---
Nah, unless I'm running with guildies get stuffed. It's still an upgrade, and I can use it for my shadow set.
---
They're not imposing anything, every single game in the world will have guides showing what the best items/builds are, this is nothing new lmao. I see way more casuals crying and justifying to others why they're not going for optimal gear than I see tryhards telling people what to do.
---
no it didn't, asmondgold is irrelevant to memes
---
In certain content stages, as alliance, with mcp, they certainly can compete with rogues or could on private servers. They are not "slightly better than enhance", please. **There's tons of great feral parses already that support this.**
---
Its just a pain in the ass to get an MCP's every week.
---
15,000 still then. Layers just made it easier to quest and shit. It didn‚Äôt increase server population
---
if you have issues holding threat with a blue weapon at this stage of the game you have far worse problems than loot ....
---
maybe consider playing a 1 spell class
---
TLDR: We don't know
---
Lava is based on a tick. If you touch the lava when the tick goes off you get damaged. So when you take damage, delay your next jump a bit until you sync it so you're in the air during the tick.
---
Yeah im a tauren. You can still eat quillboar droppings. Unless youre a night elf. I like them.
---
We don't really know.
---
That‚Äôs a town?

I'm going to bet it takes Warriors longer than 30 seconds to solo Incendius when they're wearing full fire resistance gear.

How long does buffing someone take?

It's a combination of a lot of people not having trp installed + not wanting to rp until they hit 60 + people who rolled on the server with no intention of rping because people said it had balanced factions.
---
I certainly don't know. I'm hoping someone here has a better grasp of realm caps than I. I realize we aren't allowed to know the official numbers.
---
Like 99% of people who play a female troll pick the same face and that hair. Female trolls look dope, but their animations have to be the most stiff ones in the game
---
Hunter was a bad shout from the get go, they're not in demand and as such you can't really do much with them.
---
You either roll a warrior, priest/druid, or a mage. Remember, hunters will get fun once pvp is out and if you're desperate for social interaction then you should check to see if there's a subreddit/discord for your realm and post on there.
---
Happened to me when my net died and i used my phone to hotspot
---
But 1.9 is before 1.12
---
Straighten your fedora and move on, bud.
---
idk but just cause it says not updated if you check "load out of date addons" some are fine
---
Wouldn‚Äôt it be easy using palantir to map out transactions across servers and spot the trend?
---
It only tacked on about an extra 30 minutes total. But for 20-40 people to all agree on something like loot, especially on the internet, was worth it.
---
Bad bot.
---
Wyrmrest Accord always has Org packed.
---
Thank god I'm a Warlock.  Got that shit for free!
---
I meant literally. No one knows anything other than the information you posted.
---
That's it.
---
The stats on the gear represent what state of mind Blizzard was in with the different classes. For paladin it was the 'holy warrior' and so you obviously got a bit of everything.
---
Is it good? No. Is it good class fantasy? Yes.
---
good to see a fellow pede playing wow doing to good work
---
I can‚Äôt say for certain. If you auto loot it should prompt ‚Äúthe item you are about to loot is bind on pickup are you sure?‚Äù Or something like that. I‚Äôd personally turn auto loot off just to be safe.
---
Of course had this problem earlier so I felt your frustration haha
---
Well they fucked that right up then didn't they?
---
And then the information posted is limited af. 
---
Census addons mean very little to reality.
---
If someoen keeps pestering you to lend them your account theyre 100% trying to yoink your stuff. Thats been my experiencd.
---
Yeah, I can see how it would be super annoying for those dealing with it every day.
---
I'm afraid you are right. I'm hoping someone has something I haven't heard about or at least more informed guesses.
---
They should, but don't expect them to in a PuG. They want to run the instance for those items? They can.
---
nah
---
Hold up now. There is an alliance FP in stonetalon?!?! How have I played this so many years without realizing this
---
How would that make them more unbalanced?
---
I skilled engi, learned gnomish engi, and then unlearned and reskilled for goblin engineer by taking the book in Steamweedle Port. I do have access to the goblin schematics, but I dont have the option of getting the membership card resent from him. Weirdly enough I still have that option from the gnomish engineers. Anyone know what I should do to fix it?
---
What? You didn't like the ~~tar pieces of s-~~ muck men disarming you every 5 seconds?

Probability means how likely something is to happen. It gives you an idea on how many runs you'd have to do to likely encounter the item once, based on DR. Each kill increases your chance to encounter the item, the drop rate however won't increase but your chance to have seen it will.
---
Also its not DR√óDR. Its DR√óNumber of runs. 
---
X=DR, Y=Number of runs
---
Formula: 1-((1-x)^y)
---
I can see why people struggle to understand why probability is useful when they can't even calculate it.
---
Tough day today.  This gave me a chuckle.  Thank you.
---
It's honestly quite tiring. People quoting some introductory statistics courses without making any attempt of thinking it through.
---
The probability of getting something to drop within a certain time period is a compound event. The probability of getting a drop within N lockouts is not the same as the probability of getting it tomorrow. 
---
The probability of getting a 1% drop today is 1%.  Within next 5 attempts it's 4.9%. Within 10 attempts is 9.56%. And the probability of getting it within 11 is 10.46%. You would need to attempt it 69 times to get a 50/50 drop chance. 
---
Now say someone got the drop on the 10th attempt.
---
Now what the person was saying.  "Given the small drop chance it's unlikely I will see it the next few attempts". Which is absolutely correct given a small chance of it dropping and the fact that you can't compound any previous days because the person #1 got his drop, the probability of seeing it next time is 1%. Now what the other people are saying: Nah, it's all independent, implying the probability of it dropping the next try is 10.46% which is would be if those two were on independent lockouts.
---
Bet
---
Yeah. It sucks. I'll probably quit soon. That's ok.
---
yeah I've got the enchant on my boots!
---
I was level 51 warlock and saw a level 59 undead mage killing and finishing off a level 49 dwarf. I figured I was going to die but I had to help my fallen comrade. Somehow I won.
---
It's used by people in DM Tribute (Frost Oil). Hence the current price.
---
You literally just gave the definition of independent events.
---
&gt;Two events¬†A and¬†B are¬†independent if and only if their¬†joint probability¬†equals the product of their probabilities.
---
but if im joining a pug, although the expectation is that ms would be need and the others would greed it, i wouldn't be surprised if they roll for it.
---
the perils of pugging i spose.
---
Hahahahaha no tell him to get fucked.
---
that makes sense for when the honor system drops soon, but how're people not ready for bgs? world pvp is gonna die once bgs drop cause you gotta queue for bgs in major cities, so all the high levels will be in org/iron forge.
---
Warlocks in PVE do get pretty good as time goes on but mages still have some pretty crazy damage.
---
However, in PVP Warlocks are monsters.
---
They have the same damage modifier as cats, but they have less health, more armor and can't learn Dash. The lack of Dash is mainly why cats are preferred.

I would assume there's a filter for that type of message in your chat settings?  I haven't looked, but you might check it out.

I kind of like seeing it because after getting so annoyed by the invite box popping up all the time and finally finding a way to avoid it, I like to know it's working!
---
Jeez. Im almost 12 days at 55. Im a warrior,  i afk a bit and work on professions a bit.  But i have played vanilla-wrath and multiple pservers.
---
The only reason to really get 300 tailor is to craft truefaith vestment. As soon as you have crafted that I would drop it for herbalism. 
---
Enchanting is tough. It takes alot if dedication to be worth because you need good server reputation and rare/expensive enchants. Speculating in disenchanting is a nice quick way in making some extra gold though.
---
A medium server now has more people than the fullest Vanilla server ever had, and that's all we know.

&lt;DOGZ&gt; was literal cancer on Northdale. Not surprised at all to see them pop up on Reddit.

Typical alliance trying to gank while you‚Äôre in a fight for you life with fucking tigers
---
When I was questing at hillsbrad, after a group of ally killed me outside the yeti cave.
---
I rezzed and a ally fire mage pollied me, (I go straight up to full health) as he casts his pyroblast, it hits and doesn't kill me, I fear and dot him up, and he dies.
---
I was amazed of the strategy he employed.
---
Would you recommend using this to level, or is Arms still the way to go?
---
I'm not concerned with how monotonous and meticulous it'd be to do this all the time, so strictly from a damage and survivability perspective -- is this a better way to level vs Arms?
---
RIP
---
Is it a minor or significant dmg loss using crusader over +5 striking on perdition's blade as combat daggers/pvp build, etc.?
---
per
---
I mean, that's fine. Especially because people weren't able to stream it back in the day. If you think about that mechanic though, it's kinda similar to the "Hard mode" style things that you did in say Ulduar or something like that in WotLK. Which did give you "some dumb loot".
---
is it bad that it took me a while to see it?
---
I already made my truefaith vestments but I make a lot of gold making Runecloth bags and mooncloth cds.  Plus I invested a ton to max it out.  Enchanting just seems like a waste to level.  I think I‚Äôm gonna herb.
---
I'm tempted to deliberately gear with 2nBis just irritate the min/maxers
---
happened to me once over DW pass and i had to run from there to wherever i was going. wasn‚Äôt pleased but it was funny lol

I can see myself doing it for battleground twinks because I always loved doing that. Like having a holy priest for raiding and a second shadow priest as a 49 twink or something like that.
---
Prob whenever you can get rend weps
---
Blizzard would be stupid to invest tons of development money into making a new game that has a high risk of failure rather than rehash and already successful expansion that would guarantee them another 2 years of regular subs from a huge chunk of the community and has very, very little risk.
---
If you were an intelligent businessman who didn't give a damn about the Warcraft lore or video games in general you'd immediately back the less-risky and almost guaranteed profit of TBC rather than the highly risky and *expensive to make* Classic +
---
How long did it take until you got your account back?
---
Think you can run BRD exp farming or BRD arena/angerforge/golem run. They are around 20-30mins per run.
---
Alternatively, you can run DM as well, each wing is around 30mins as well. Just abit hard to secure a slot since many 60s running it and ppl prefer picking 60s for faster run.
---
The only concrete thing we know is "Med pop realm already has more players than a full vanilla realm did". That was in a blue post.

Thanks for the chuckle:)

Escape removes target

Donald posters bad guuuuys
---
I saw an alliance guild push them out while I was questing there today. Last night was bad, but I ended up killing two of them during a skirmish and got a leather from a nice person in general chat.
---
Exactly and it‚Äôs a lot smoother and less clunky. Definitely wanna get used to using that mouse for player and camera movement. Opens up a lot of stuff
---
The cost is there, just not in dollars. Dont think for a second its a goodwill project these days.
---
This lol, i got through svt with a breeze on a very horde dominant server doing the quests at night and some dungeon/other zone during the day, ofvourse everyone cant do this but i think svt and searing gorge could be the fastest two zones and the jungle is awesome so no skipping.
---
naw people are nice it depends. let me break it down for you 
---
Priest heals: usually an ok dude, chose priest to get into groups quickly 8/1‚Äù
---
Druid tank: ‚Äòhold on lighting a bowl‚Äô 9/10 chill 
---
Warlock: at least you got summoned 7/10
---
Mage: Chad/Brad. 10/10 Dps, water is a plus, can be turds 
---
Shaman: ???????
---
Warriors: 5/7decent in all aspects
---
hOw DaRe YoU jUdGe WhAt IdEoLoGy I cHoOsE tO iDeNtIfY wItH?!
---
This isn't Asmon's guild
---
A warrior can't do anything against a half decent mage. The rogue was bad though.
---
When you say 'make a ton of money's you have to look at it from a raw material POV. If you could sell the raw materials for just as much then you have made 0 gold from the proffesion. The mooncloth CD is decent passive income depending on my server. On mine the transmute is only about. 10-15g profit which in my opinion is rather poor for a 4 day CD.
---
But yeah stick with tailor and try out some herb.
---
Ive had this except same bug kick me off a mount 
---
Right after the Great Lift going into 1k needles
---
One time I got on a boat in Ratchet and it DCed me going across the Ocea 
---
When I re logged I was dead at the graveyard in Stonetalon mountains
---
The bugs obviously hate me
---
That's much scarier XD I think I would've just died
---
imagine thinking both sides don't do that in equal mesures LUL
---
Mr. Big cock here, lookout fam
---
I‚Äôve never heard the term pound salt and you‚Äôve just made my night
---
Wow it sounds like the game has been targeting you with these :P next time you'll be a thousand miles in the air while over the mountains and fall for days XD
---
Amazing a frost made killing melee.
---
i did about 3 times, tan through like darkshire or whatever (playing horde) and had to use pots to pass guards
---
https://youtu.be/lu0yhNUVQvw
---
I'm not sure I've seen anybody lose half their health that quick to a bunch of white hits and a SS.
---
How much gold should i be sitting at at 40 with mining and skinning at the appropiate level? I saw the bars u make out of copper ores goes for 1g/stack on firemaw, thats pretty juicy. 
---
Also at what skinning leather is it a good time to start putting it on AH? Thick? Rugged? 
---
Thanks.
---
That's nightmare fuel right there, but also part of why I love this game - now you have an amazing story of a unique challenge that you faced!
---
Then why would shadowguard proc blackout? And i can confirm it does.
---
HElLo I aM vErY mUcH gM for BiIzArD, gib cREdIt cArD InFO oR FaCe mY bAnS

yah we can tell

loool i can use that on my application to Stormwind state college
---
That main tank get free gear just for showing up and get helped by their entire guild? Thats a pretty solid argument I think. When you see how these maintank interact with other players on their server. Hooo I'm bored of this content... ho I don't need to do that content. Give me 20g and I'll come. And then "you guys can't play the game you guys are noob". Princesses, spoiled. Earn things the hard way is good. Help others before yourself is good value even in a video game.
---
So sure what I'm saying might be bias, but I've seen this before and I see this again.
---
The only cost to me for the bags is the leather and it‚Äôs dirt cheaper on ol Blanchy server.  But I agree tailoring isn‚Äôt the best overall.  I‚Äôll keep my enchanting rods in case I ever want it again but I think herbalism is the way for me.  I have an epic mount so I can level it quickly.
---
Makes sense. I couldn‚Äôt care less whether they do classic + or TBC I‚Äôll be excited for both.
---
Well if you fly to Darn you're flying over Feathermoon anyways so it isn't a huge issue.
---
Roll druid with a HOTW/NS spec. You'll be a viable healer in raids, can PvP ery well both in AND outside of WSG, and you can tank 5/10 man instances with guildies/friends. Gearing is much easier because less druids raiding, and leveling is a cakewalk.   
---
Hardcore strat is to become enchanter for the heart of the mountain trinket, but only sumper important if you wanna tank stuff endgame.
---
1v3 what? 1 mage vs 3 warriors? The mage power level is still slightly than those 3 warriors combined.
---
If he took a shadow priest, a sl lock and a ele shaman I'd be impressed but the truth is he'd get fucking stomped and chomped even if they suck.
---
The greatest warrior still loses to the worlds worst mage unless that mage has no idea what range is. Too easy to play in the deadzone with all the immobilization. Throw in a FAP and the mage is fucked any day of the week though.
---
Whatever man then don't read the quest and miss out on a huge portion of the game. It's obviously up to you.
---
You're not being a dick by having boundaries. He's being a dick by pushing your boundaries. This is narcissist behavior, making you feel like you're harming him by simply having a perfectly normal and reasonable boundary.
---
&gt; The early release of DM and recent streamer podcasts with devs show this pretty clearly.
---
which interviews? i listen to a ton of podcasts at work.
---
12 k is a fair estimate. But why do you care so much?
---
You could start doing a /who and start counting but who really cares at that point?
---
Let me guess, you play horde?
---
What do you mean? Nothing happen in 1989, it was a totally normal year.
---
As I asked before, what would, in a fair and transparent way, constitute 'doing it' for the purpose of issuing a ban? 
---
As a Blizzard GM, you can't exactly check who is sitting in Discord or any other external chat with the opposing faction, so you have to go by in-game actions. So, what actions would somebody have to do in game to get banned for Devilsaur Mafia?
---
Hey pal, you just blow in from Stupid Town?
---
Bump
---
It‚Äôs fine as a rage dump. Leveling a warrior you should be pooling rage on one mob for sweeping into ms/whirlwind. Then the second mob gets white/sweep, ms/sweep, WW/double sweep and white/sweep. That also works with cleave giving a quad hit as well. Popping all your sweeping charges in roughly three globals is worthwhile even if it‚Äôs ‚Äòless‚Äô efficient because both mobs should be dead by that point.
---
We do make our own rules. The rules are pay for the water or dont get it. When you're leveling, it can take like 10 casts to get a stack if you just got a new rank and i'm not going to stop what im doing to make someone water.
---
And at 60 a stack of on-level water is almost 2g (or more?) so the piddly 50s or whatever you pay for mage water is nothing.
---
I mean yeah I am definitely not saying do that. That's where you gotta have common sense and decency cause it's all just gear in a game!
---
Shamans will always be needed for raids, if that's your goal, and are decent in pvp, depending on spec and bracket. They are middle of the pack for leveling, but get pretty fun after 40 if you respec ele.
---
Careful guys, massive cock on this one
---
Roll PvP. The honor system isn't coming out until nov/decmber at least so you'll still have time to level to 60 before it becomes a bloodbath.   
---
Also, I think druid is the most fun. Lots of versatility and it allows you to heal/dps when you get bored of tanking. Warrior can be REALLY unforgiving to new players, so keep that in mind
---
Is firemaw a good server? Ally/horde ratio?
---
&gt; The average person still has no Idea that they‚Äôre even a thing.
---
pretty sure minecraft took care of that 6-7 years ago.
---
I used to play from different computers/countries quite often. Never got banned, just triggered the account lock quite often = quickly resolved with answering security question/whatever you set as security measure on bnet.
---
Greater version just for rag have shamans drop fire resistance if needed. If your alliance then you‚Äôre probably fine just using greater with buff from UBRS for rag.
---
In the current state of the game where people are clearing MC and Ony with a raid of 25-30 players, most sub-60, it's mind boggling that anyone would force anyone to play something other than what they want.
---
What is the heroic strike que feature?
---
Yeah he had some money on top and was straight up bragging about how easy it had been to get his mount money right up until the point he realised his mistake.
---
A beautiful piece of WoW history.
---
Maybe you got there too fast
---
It could also just be that he is on a dead realm, has a bad guild, is on pve where it's often the case people just stick to their guild and not look for pugs. Doesn't have to be him...
---
In my experience, most of the 60s are too busy fighting over leather to bother with levelers.
---
Most bis lists also only take into account pre pve like hitting a dummy. In an actual raid where you are progging you put on whatever resist gear to not die first.
---
Also most of the bis are bad for pvp except some classes. Warriors wearing leather and shit
---
What is ‚Äúfap‚Äù in this context?
---
15 times a day
---
That makes it even better.
---
Don't forget about the 5 minute diseases they apply that halve your move and attack speed.
---
Same for femorcs only 1 cute face.
---
Dire maul came out yesterday, which made life easy to farm.
---
Up until yesterday it would have been worth 50-75g as life was hard to farm.
---
Wait.. cat for pvp, surely you mean moonfire/insect swarm spam along with entangling roots? Cat can be used as opener but if you ever go into cat form midfight you will get absolutely wrecked by everything. 
---
Examples;
---
No armor vs rogues/warriors
---
OOM vs mages because of shapeshift spam
---
Locks already own you, same with priests and hunters. But you can win with dots if you travel form kite and heal.
---
Seconded for Incendius.  Not using a server pop addon, but the unofficial discord shows 2201 horde and 2126 alli.  Should give a pretty good idea of over balance for the sampling size.
---
Cheating or not. It is stupid to not use it when everyone else is. I wouldn't mind if Blizz banned it. But until then I will use it.
---
Just wait for BGs :)
---
I think they're filled to the brim because of cross-realm.
---
The drop rate for bindings is absolutely not affected by how many lockouts you've done or how many bindings have already dropped. Stop over complicating things, you're confusing yourself.
---
stay hydrated as well!
---
if you need motivation check our r/hydrohomies
---
At least for hunters too there‚Äôs many ways to craft your pre bis.. you can pretty much mex and match any few items with hit on them till you hit cap and fill the rest with agi. Following the pre bis list 100% is stupid tbh
---
My favorite are the Thott comments which used to just display chronologically, so there's a random, "no you're stupid, shut up" in the middle of the comments.
---
I leveled fury, use the best weapon you have access to at the time. For awhile this prob be a 2hander but later on you can dual wield just fine.
---
Purepwnage.  It's been so long.
---
All you can do is farm mc/ony, get epic mount, max put professions, farm gold and like argent dawn reputation, there is no rush.
---
I wouldn't know, never used one.
---
From what I understand - part of the Warlock epic mount quest line involves buying some decently expensive vendor items. After you summon the boss/event and get your mount, you keep the items you need to summon the boss and other warlocks can complete their quest with your summon.
---
This means you can get your epic mount summon, then help other warlocks by saving them a bunch of gold by summoning the boss for them. Charging 75g per summon is cheap compared to what they'd have to spend on their own, and gets you a pretty penny in the process.
---
Yeah, you save all the mats (arcanite bars/black dragonscales etc) which costs about 350g to get alone. This way any lock that joins can go in and complete the ritual part of the quest chain.
---
A lock on my server made over 3k gold today.. its fucking stupid.
---
If you wanna do LC, which in my opinion is the best long term solution, my best advice is to point out Class Leaders who are responsible for knowing the Class and they should keep track of who should get what and who can help the guild long term.
---
The class leaders for mage/warlock should discuss together how they wanna approach staff of dominance vs. Mageblade as an example.
---
Service was fantastic! 5/5 would come again.
---
Bad bot
---
Yeah that blows man haha. I had it on the AH fir 50g which was cheap at the time, but no one bit. Unlucky!
---
I cant imagine my life as a leveling rogue without improved sprint and improved cooldowns on sprint and evasion.
---
According to a wowhead article I saw, it literally JUST got updated.  But your point stands.
---
Lucky rogues get to decide how most battles are going to go.
---
Cataclysm
---
I couldn‚Äôt love this more. Amidst all of the (reasonable) blizz drama, this has been the best game thing to happen in a very long while.
---
If the rogue isn't frost nova'd or slowed, he should be able to close the distance with sprint before you can finish casting poly and use kick/blind/gouge/kidney shot. If not he can always vanish.
---
Thing is all that BIS gear doesn't mean a damn thing if you can't play your class correctly
---
AFAIK the only thing that you could do to figure out who's good is Warcraft Logs.
---
Also evaluate your hit against your spec. You need at most I think 5% hit (correct me if I'm mistaken). Which is as low as 0% if you have the combat spec for hit.
---
But I like what you've done. I wasn't aware you could change the weights of things on that site.
---
Server time, which is what you'll see realm time referred to as.
---
zhevras are not a real animal bro.....
---
ShadowUF is great and easy to customize
---
If he was your friend he wouldn't ask in the first place, and if he did he'd understand why you wouldn't be comfortable with that, and if he didn't even make it THAT far he still wouldn't guilt trip you for it cuz that's just manipulative behavior. 
---
On top of that, this is to gain access to your account. No matter who he is he doesn't need that or the sensitive information it allows access to.
---
Don‚Äôt loot the body until they‚Äôre not nearby, even if it means the body despawns.
---
As a warrior lvling you are going to die a lot. As a warrior dual wielding while lvling you are going to die a lot more... plain and simple it sucks.
---
I wish there was a wow heroes for classic.
---
Literally happened to me yesterday when leaving BRD. Couple of the elite dwarves just outside the instance chased me clean all the way out of the mountain and halfway to Morgan's Vigil before catching up and annihilating me. Didn't hit them once.
---
And yet 3 charges. This is a good levelling weapon
---
Because now you are spending time leveling up/loyalty up on two pets?
---
It's not really bad but there will be situations where you will want to pull out the voidwalker, like times where there's a tough pack of mobs and using the voidwalker to switch between each to grab aggro will allow you to solo it and using an imp will not.
---
Just look at people's gear and ask them. That's how you do it in a normal world. Or even easier - join semi guild raid, then join guild if all comes together.
---
Honestly, you do you. If I meet someone like you in game, I would simply put you on my ignore and complain a bit to my friends about you and that'd be it.
---
So giantstalker just drops all night Everytime you raid? This story sounds like bullshit.
---
if it wasn't thats an immediate /gquit from me
---
It doesn't affect my decision on where to level but it bothers me to see all the posts of people asking about new realms because of high or low or unbalanced pop when Blizzard isn't allowing us access to the information to answer these questions. 
---
Is moving back to a high pop server a good idea? That depends on what Blizzard is doing about ending layers. If it's 12K now does that mean they will be only letting 6K play on each server come Phase 2? If so that's a massive queue for Faerlina or wherever. Or are they just going to drop it to 10K in which case if you hate playing with only 3K and don't mind 30 minute or so queues during prime time then a megaserver is totally for you.
---
Yeah like literally any damage.
---
Mage have no threat dumps, but their threat reduction talent makes them very powerful.
---
I think they might be meaning that paladin tank = more dps aoeing because more aoe threat. Then the dps get in a group with a warrior who can't hold as good aoe threat. Sounds like a poor excuse, people can also learn how to react respective of the tank's class.
---
That's just teaching life lessons...kind of like Alt+F4
---
The drop chance is unaffected, but the probability of *you seeing it drop* absolutely is affected.
---
I wouldn't think you would have trouble, warriors are gear dependent but as nutella said they can be up there with the top dps classes plus get to wear plate and tank when they feel the need. 
---
If you are not feeling it though there's not danger in trying another class, the 43 levels you have on your warrior won't vanish and you can come back any time to finish him off or just leave him as an alt gaining rested xp.
---
If we're casting globals, what are you interrupting with counterspell?
---
Ah right good call, I had it at 6% for yellow hits but that's only for pve isn't it? Also don't know if rogues have a hit talent.
---
More familiar with casters gearing :)
---
Hi mate, big congratulations! Could you please tell me where did you decide to pickpocket mobs and what build you were using?
---
Naxx is like a year away lol
---
In going to guess that was 3-4 realms combined in ur case.
---
Follow the guide you pleb

/s
---
It sounds like rogue is not for you, perhaps try something like a mage?
---
I‚Äôve not encountered any crappy behavior in classic so far. Everyone had been super friendly and helpful. I‚Äôve had great dungeon runs as both healer and as DPS. 
---
Yesterday I spent several hours in a small party of randos (two tanks a healer and me/rogue) grouping other solo people to help with the elite quests in Arathi. We ran the Stromgarde quest line must‚Äôve been 12 times. That‚Äôs not an isolated incident.
---
There have been several times people have saved my ass in tight fights or responded to a LFM and offered to help with an orange quest for no gain of their own and have said something to the effect of: ‚Äúthis is about community right? We have to be the society we want.‚Äù So now I have also started randomly helping anyone I can who‚Äôs calling for LFM even if I don‚Äôt have the quest. 
---
I rolled on an RP server so maybe that‚Äôs part of it?
---
Nameshame them everywhere you can. Ita more fun to watch them get blacklisted. Someone that does that will ninja loot.
---
Stealing leather from the enemy tho... that's fun
---
Is that where they Harvest up all the Dwarfs and put them into re-education camps?
---
get used to the "full on rogue sry" response
---
My hearth is in kargath, if I get a group right when I log in, often the case, it's gunna take me a while to fly to gromgol, zep to org, and fly down to feralas.
---
Where are your "friends" during all of this?  Loot council is truly the best system when done right but the worst when done wrong
---
Opinion on best dps/grind spec for prot warrior?
---
I put mine on the AH at all levels.

At 40 i had around 130 gold with mining (low level though) and skinning.

Yes but I don't imagine getting jumped by a mage with a felhunter out. An invisible succubus ready to fuck their day up though? That's some good shit.
---
Here comes greater faction imbalance, yay
---
Most of the top guilds upload raid logs to classic.warcraftlogs.com then the site ranks on speed and dps. It isn't a perfect measure but it's about the best we have
---
What server do ypu play on? Eu/Us?
---
Blizzard used to have a traceroute tool you could use to test your connection to their servers. If the results are poor, you can show them to your ISP and they may be able to help.
---
Loook up spell coefitient. Not all spell benefit the same from +spellpower.
---
Another reason I‚Äôm pumped I‚Äôm not a warrior
---
Everyone on PvP believes they will be doing the ganking, not that others will gank them.
---
yeah like you, boomer
---
Nope, ranks have nothing to do with spell resist chance.
---
Go play alliance and don't run any of the 4 SM instances a single time and tell me how your leveling experience and gear is between 30 and 40.
---
Reddit has become the wow forums of vanilla. I personally applaud and respect the comradarie of the community in our new digital construct.
---
Well, I play on US West coast server, but it doesn't really matter, I'll create a character on whatever server the guild is on. Horde preferably.
---
If tank gear drops... who else are you gonna give but the tank lol?
---
Climate yuppies exists everywhere
---
f in chat
---
Nope, which is why using R1 abilities to get status effects in pvp is a very common thing.
---
R1 frost bolt for example to slow someone, because it applies the same slow but casts faster.
---
Thanks :)
---
I'll tank it instead you think I care? You think because tanks are rare gives them an excuse to be shit, or rather adopt a mindset that tanks can do no wrong? If your dungeon group can't cleave at all at lvl 50, you suck.
---
Precision, a 2nd tier talent in the combat tree.  Obtainable for any builds that favor improved sprint.  Less common, but different things work for different people.
---
I've been aoe grinding as a mage using R1 ice nova and it seems like a lot of the time at least 1-2 mobs will resist it and it's extremely annoying. I've watched a lot of mage vids and it doesn't seem to happen as frequently to other people as it does with me :(
---
Imagine playing classic as horde: Do i play as Shrek, a corpse, a literal cow, or a really stretched out boar?
---
You want to aim for highest possible crit numbers. That means crit equip bonuses and agility.
---
Main hand should be either Felstriker or Heartseeker, good luck getting Felstriker to drop. Offhand should be something fast. Best pre-raid right now is Distracting Dagger.
---
For gear, just look up rogue pre-bis lists that have several options and choose the one that offers the most crit. Some good items to go for are Eye of Rend, Muggers Belt, Devilsaur set, Mongoose Boots, Truestrike shoulders, hand of Justice, blackhands breath, deepfury bracers, mark of fordring, painweaver band, Blackstone ring etc. Those were just the ones I have off the top. Good luck man!
---
Nice! I'm going to try and get my grandma to move from Mankrik to Azuresong, we all live on the west coast and made a mistake the first time.

I'll buy all of the black mouths. The profit margin for alchemy is outrageous

I like how you get butthurt over how other people play the game. I never said I had ill intentions, MC into PW:Fort is the usual, or a heal if they're gonna die. Thanks for your comment though, I'll file it into the recycling bin.
---
You're still better off in normal gear just using chain heal. The set bonus doesn't make you more mana efficient compared to stacking HP/Mp5.
---
I did the math for someone a while back. It's great pvp gear, it is useless healing gear.
---
Daggers exist.
---
Wrong. You can turn this off.
---
Thought I could but get no loot
---
There are daggers in the game and it's a 100% viable spec.
---
I am west and play incendius, I get 50 ping. It's rlly not a big deal.
---
You can skip rockbiter once you have flame tongue, also skip frosttongue.
---
Magma totem isn't worth the mana till 60 when your mana pool is big enough.
---
A lot of the buff totems can be skipped as well.
---
Horde or Alli?
---
You clearly dont know how to play rogue.
---
You stay at the boss until they either do it or kick you. However important on Vectus is that you have the item ready that makes the trashpacks easy. Else it is understandable that the others will want to skip it.
---
impossible to get it as it's not out yet
---
What is soaking tier gear?
---
Thank you very much, I really appreciate it
---
Happy birthday
---
Free action potion
---
You have the mageblade as well. BIS for paladins.
---
Not really, even without the attackspeed normalization every range weapon out of MC is an upgrade to the dungeon ones. They have \~9 dps more than the dungeon ones and with the higher attackspeed about the same min-max dmg. But I don't think I'll roll for them (especially the gun), because I'll drop it the moment I get the questbow
---
Me n the boys?
---
Thats exactly my thoughts on it.
---
Yeah theres a reason you don't see horde on Heartseeker. It's brutal here. A lot of the alliance here are smart though, they don't gank or camp people trying to level because they know its better for the servers health if these guys get 60. But unfortunately the majority especially in sub 50 zones aren't this intelligent. They just jump and zerg rush down every lowbie horde character. So many just say screw it and go play on another realm where they're the majority. It's odd to me because most of the alliance here I assume came over here because this happened to them from dumb horde. But now they're doing it themselves.
---
I've kept a track of the population even with the census being broken thanks to having two accounts, and it's about 78% to 22% on this realm. Alliance keep growing as horde dies off. Blizzard goofed up by not locking down realms when they got too much of one faction.
---
No worries, just a bad day relatively speaking.  All good.
---
Try this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fREa-rfs8aU

I've had multiple messages like this.

Casual vs Bleeding edge competitive

An argument as old as time.
---
Smell the roses, Frank, level your professions!
---
Fuck you, Jerty, get to rank 14, pussy!
---
Felheart has 128 damage across 8 pieces. It's terrible minus the chest but volatile power chest is still godly.
---
You can't enter an instance in any way if you're locked out. The portal stops you.
---
Casting the aspect again will auto cancel without any mana or macro
---
It's very different roles, it's not about effiecntly when you're 8/8 t1, it's being able to be a dedicated tank healer while splash healing melee and getting the raw throughout of the Healing Wave on the tank. Again, niche role meant for 100% minmaxing ad a guild, only worth it when you have 5+ shamans. Not worth it unless you just want to min-max a raid in the most insane way.
---
Alrighty then, thank you
---
Hilarious xD
---
Bobs or vagana
---
No this is Patrick!
---
Is it really though? I ask because people said that about Heartseeker too, when in reality it only felt that way because they were comparing it to shit like Stalagg. I mean in vanilla a high pop realm capped out at around 3000 people online max (Kern himself said that). Whereas we saw on todays realms you could get over 15000 easily so by comparison it makes regular realms feel low when they weren't.
---
&gt;Reply
---
I think it's more that this is what Vanilla raiding is like, 40 people, you're legit just a number to the raid leader.
---
10man raiding is truly the way to play
---
Now that fortnite is back, this shouldn't be an issue.
---
Fortnite can babysit those kids over there.
---
All you're doing is trying to justify what I said, proving my comments right. So thanks for that. Try playing as Horde and going into hillsbrad ever. There were two allies there today, 50 and 47, killing every horde they could find. Hillsbrad is for high 20s. It still took two allies to kill them at double their level.
---
Depends what type of person your guild leader is, depends how much he cares about the guild and members, depends who else is on loot council and how much they care, depends what's happening in their life at the moment, depends on a lot of things. Doesn't have to be purposeful. Maybe they're treating you unfairly because they want to give the items to their friends. Or maybe they just don't pay enough attention and didn't even notice they were treating you unfairly. The only way for you to find out is to log back in and speak to your guild leader. Also I don't know how close you are to the friends that brought you to that guild, but you might want to speak to them. If they don't give a shit, then they're not really your friends, just ... people you play with.
---
You should definitely try and find out whether your guild leader is negligent or malevolent, and decide yourself whether you can trust him again. And if not, plenty of good guilds around I'm sure. No need to be defeatist.
---
Please ELI5
---
Not everyone man. My friends and I wanted as close to 50/50 as we could get because we have fond memories of early vanilla world PvP. Theres no joy in zerging down one guy with 10 of you. At least to me.
---
It's always been a problem. Always. It's a flaw in the design of their game they spent YEARS trying to fix, but always seemed to fuck it up even more. That's when they finally scrapped talent trees and were able to make some progress. Classic is a big fucking mess. If you're not a CC class you're at a disadvantage in PVP. Stick to PVE and there's no problems. That's what WOW was, and PVP was just an afterthought.
---
MCP has +16 str. I don‚Äôt even use the charges... That‚Äôs real nice, but on my server its over 15 gold.
---
Shaving 2 minutes off of an MC Tim didn't seem that crucial to force everyone to get BiS beforehand. Not sure why you would think that if necessary.
---
Again, I'll tell my guild/friends list to quit inviting me but people like me as a healer. Your Reddit rage has inspired me to turn down the main reason to play classic. Thank you.
---
that is a negligible consideration as I stated but you're welcome to prove me wrong
---
each additional % of hit should only allow for .07 (.05 from sword spec + .02 from hoj) more attacks from hoj/sword spec. Hoj/Sword spec basically increases your actual hit rate by 7%, i.e. if you hit 60/100 attacks, hoj/sword spec will make you hit 64.2/100 attacks (60 * .07 = 64.2)
---
So +1% hit for hoj/sword spec can be thought of as effectively +1.07% hit. Crit still wins, as it is effectively 2% hit.
---
They're a sidegrade at best and often result in lower damage than the blue crossbows thanks to how aimed shot interacts with your auto shots.
---
 Ecstasy shaving 2 minutes off a run is exactly how much time can be saved. It‚Äôs science right?
---
My special is in 2040 after I win the lottery in 2037 blow through all my money in 2 years, the last year I spend homeless and suffer a massive head injury trying to fish a soup can out of a dumpster, and then our healthcare system picks a drug addicts brain to transplant mine with and its Mitch Hedbergs.
---
There is a 1% unavoidable chance to resist spells. Nothing you can do about it. If it's just 1 or 2, you can let them beat on you while your Ice Barrier is up and get them in the next nova. 
---
There is literally no reason to use anything but R1 Frost Nova
---
Tanking in raids definitely requires a player that is confident, likes a challenge and can handle getting abuse when things go wrong. 
---
Keeping aggro in classic was a genuine challenge and if DPS don‚Äôt respect that, you can get into a lot of issues. 
---
Having said that, raid tanking is probably one of the most rewarding things I‚Äôve experienced in a game. Just not for someone who is looking to ‚Äújust enjoy the game‚Äù, it‚Äôs stressful.
---
Well I guess this is one way to get gold for epic mount.
---
That fucking dwarf in Blackrock Mountain chased me to Thorium point. I just let myself die at this point.
---
This is how it works for raids in retail. Classic is a different beast.
---
and the fact that you fly to gromgol -&gt; zep instead of just buying a mage port to org shows how much u dont care about getting the run going. just wasting ppls time xD. prob always last person to get to the run.
---
They had tar lords in a previous zone which sou ds racist af
---
Because it looks bad ass. Why would I want my iconic class set, I should just use this pile of trash that looks like level 40 greens. Oh its my fault for not being a resto shaman.
---
I get it. I do. I just think it sucks. Always have. But I have a reply. Why do so many people try to over optimize everything at the detriment to everything else in MMOs? If you're clearing the content no problem with a 40 man squad in full greens, why do you need to tell people what they can and cannot play as? Wear? Roll for?
---
I just find the entire concepts that many hold dear to be a killjoy, a bummer, and completely un-fun.
---
That's okay I guess. I'll never get my tier set, because you're right. I'm not wanted unless I play what other people want me to. That's okay. I'll just play something else.
---
They can save about 350g I think if doing it together so makes sense.
---
Its great. /s
---
My guild currently uses roll system. Some people have gotten 2-5 pieces per raid. Others (and our strongest dpsers) have ended up not winning anything. So despite having some people with a lot better gear it is still our best but least geared players topping the meters. If that ain't unfullfilling I don't know what is.
---
and those ppl are prob on herod or whitemane or gehennas, all examples of cancer servers. there are plenty more high pop ones then that
---
Even as a rogue ungoro was rouuugh on Fairbanks A
---
You pretty much said "allies do exactly what you said they do because of this" or am I mistaken?
---
&gt;They're a sidegrade at best and often result in lower damage than the blue crossbows thanks to how aimed shot interacts with your auto shots.
---
Didn't think about the aimed shot mechanic, that's why simcraft makes them such a small increase. Thanks, now I definitely won't roll for them
---
&gt;This will be my last comment
---
Thank God lol
---
og amount
---
Chest is still pretty garbage compared to the void chest or the winter night.
---
Booty Bay, lowest level. Fishing shop. The guy there will sell you a book for 1g that gets you to 225. When you're level 35 &amp; 225 fishing, you get to visit Nat Pagle in Duskwallow for a quest.
---
ik ik but im proud
---
that wont change if you steal a weapon from dps
---
Do you have a source for this knowledge pl0x
---
If they keep this up, it‚Äôs only matter of time before some world-altering cataclysmic event occurs.
---
Only save 250 on summoning mats, but that‚Äôs nice too :-)
---
Just wipe off the nostalgia goggles and enjoy the game for what it is. It's not going to have the same wonder and joy as when it first came out because of the nature of MMOs in general currently. That being said, it's fun. Have fun and play when (or if) you like
---
No they're all green, which is the saddest part lol
---
Can't seem to get through get through the gap at the gate, tried noggenfogger as well. Any tips for squeezing through. Race is Night elf.

Labelers like you are why racism exists. I don't label people as anything, neither should you. I am not a 'naysayer'. I don't perpetuate anything. I am not detrimental to anyone. I am not unwanted or bad, nor do I cause bad or detrimental things to happen to others.
---
I simply said: use the route you're supposed to use. Don't try to circumvent procedure. You're not more or less important than anyone else. If you can't deal with that, are you sure YOU'RE not the one that is detrimental to others? I mean, you have no problem STEPPING on other people to get what you want. Literally CLIMBING over people and rallying others to agree with you en-masse to get something of literally ZERO value (except perceived value, to you, revenge/retribution/vengeance/etc).
---
By all means. Continue thinking you're a saint. You're a snake.
---
How is it useless when it's litteraly not out... So easily offended lol
---
I'm a little unsure of how to check that
---
Rogue. Imo the most fun and well-designed class in Vanilla. You won't be as desirable in groups as any of the other classes you listed (if that's a significant factor to you), but fast leveling, very little downtime, unique gameplay experience you won't get with any other class, wide toolkit, beast in both PvE and PvP.
---
I can't tell you about the length. But when I asked in /lfg when to start tanking it, I was told 58 was a good level to do so.
---
You can live through it?
---
-Warrior
---
That‚Äôs AOE attempt was harder to watch than the spell batching death
---
True, but if you "steal" a weapon from a dps you might just have generated enough threat before the unlucky streak.

I'd always planned to be a tank.  Druid tanking was an unexpected turn of events though as I had originally planned to play a warrior but through a forced server change and thinking I'd return to the original server after it settled, I thought I'd give the Druid a run.  As it turned out, I never reverted back to my original server and so the Druid became my main.
---
I'm still levelling (mid 40s atm) but I'm finding the tanking is getting better as I go.  Early on it was a nightmare - especially with DPS pretty much unleashing as soon as I started moving towards the mobs, but thankfully lower levels are a little more forgiving than it sounds like higher levels are.  As I level the threat generation has improve immensely and I'm noticing its easier and easier to maintain threat from the get-go.   I've had mostly positive runs so far so I'm really enjoying it.  Healers have been particularly positive.  
---
I like the versatility in general.  It's great to be able to quest as cat (although slower with a primarily tanking spec) and then switch out to heal and keep going.  Downtime is minimal.  In dungeons, the ability to go in as a tank or DPS is also pretty useful.
---
You're gonna complain about a warrior wanting to roll on Felstriker, yet you're doing the same thing by saying "it's 100% a rogue weapon"? 
---
You're doing the exact thing you're complaining they're doing.
---
Of course it does you idiot. You think anyone actually cares about anyone elses fucking VIRTUAL wealth in a video game? Ever? "This guy is cheating! Put him in video game jail!". No, you/he/they/it felt wronged, and they want the person who wronged them to be punished. They want their ability to play the game taken away from them. They don't care how or why.
---
I am not supportive of people that break the rules. I merely proprosed that due procedure be followed. If you really think that's so bad, I'm sorry. I don't think I am some kind of monster for expecting this, nor do I think people like you that just instantly hate others for such little reasons (and such bad judgements) have very good opinions yourselves, worthy of any kind of recognition, themselves.
---
Look. You pay to play a game. Someone breaks the rules. You are given resources to deal with it. You/he/they/it don't like the tools, you go outside of the game and try to make some kind of mob. I don't think that's cool. I don't think that will ever be cool. You don't agree? Fuck off, you're a moron.
---
You can do things better with better stuff lol fuckin duh man. You have no point worth saying lmao it's so obvious it goes w/o being said.  Eod this is a game and your elitist attitude makes it shitty and unfun
---
North and West are two of the harder 5 mans in the game, I'd delay those until you've gotten a bit of gear at 60, west you should be able to jump into right away and clear.
---
But don't try to toggle HS. It will just be a DPS loss compared to BT/WW not being used off CD.

In a 40 man raid, there'll always be a spot for a ret paladin and no one cares for your dps before aq40, because your support will even that out.
---
The real issue is your mana and as soon as your raidlead requires everyone to use consumables, you'll have more afford to get them, because you need more to get the same results. Mana is an issue too, but that's avoidable with enough pots :)
---
Loot council is the best way to maximize progression, that's what it's good for. Take a piece of loot and give it to the player where it would give the most benefit.
---
It's not designed to be fair or good for individual, just for the benefit of the group as a whole.
---
It's easily abused and pretty much everybody involved needs to be professional about.
---
In other words, get out of there as quick as possible. time is such a limited resources that it's a shame to waste it on "drama".
---
You sound like dedicated player, go and find a different group to play with who are more inline with your mindset.

Its not uncommon for people to get the bomb in MC while typing and you get a message like "hey whats upwedadwawdadsdwasdwadwads

I don‚Äôt think those words should exist in the same sentence.

you really don't get the 2 &gt; 1 argument, do you?

the tps difference from QS to viskag is minimal.

Classic is turning into a toxic cesspool *really* quickly. The honeymoon period is officially over, the Gearscore mentality is oozing out into the world fast.
---
roll an alt.
---
Also it gives you an avenue to report them.
---
As do the horde. Because the alliance do it just as often. It's even. Except I've never had an ally have the balls to fight me one on one if it would be a fair fight. That's the only difference. Horde aren't afraid to fight.
---
Right now i am using battle stance (puts on my axe and goes into battle stance), defence stance (puts on my axe and shield and goes into def stance), charge+hamstring, normal attack + sunder
---
LET ME MOVE TO FAERLINA
---
That's why she's EX... right?
---
SOD and mageblade is loot whoring and unfair that someone is rocking a shit tier witch blade or similar because you had a bag space to fill.
---
yeah dude for every 1 nice person out there, theres 100 of others that would not do this
---
you just need to poly em if they have the free action. you can fake cast the kick then poly. with ice barrier and mana shield being enough to negate 90% of the dmg. you can even just blink+poly cuz they cant really catch up to you in the 1.5 seconds it takes to cast. (there dmg is also fairly ass outside of ambush and evi) then use fire ball to apply a dot so they cant easily restealth. using r1 bolts to keep em in combat with max rank bolts ofc being used for dmg. (you also dont need to be facing them to cast poly)
---
people over estimate the power a free action pot has over a mage, we can reset a fight infinitely and drink+eat as we need to regen.
---
the tldr (and overly simplifed) of any mage vs melee class. is you land a poly, get range and then you kill em. (now vs a rogue with eng, thats a bit different.)
---
Yeah for sure. I was really excited for classic because for whatever reason I thought things would be different. I played EverQuest and WoW back in the day so... I've had plenty of experience with 'people' in MMOs.
---
For whatever reason I thought a lot of people would be like me I guess. Nice, older people that are calm, polite and want to coordinate and work together. Nope. Its the same batch of 30-40 year olds acting like 12-18 year olds and 12-18 year olds acting like 12-18 year olds.
---
Time moves on, but nothing really changes.
---
I'm learning to get over it and just play the game anyway, but like you I can't help but be as you put it, "disheartened". Because its disappointing.
---
FOR SURE
---
And yet that tps difference is way more impactful than 1 rogue/warr getting a viskag.
---
bump
---
Possible they didn't know what you were doing and thought you needed help. Either way would still be annoying.
---
They have one other passable one, but it's not as good looking as that one that everyone uses.
---
Being in the initial ball of gameplay is like a drug to some people.  I notice it with diablo3 I only really like it when the servers are popping with people and you just level and play with others trying to get stuff. Then it tapers off.
---
Like the meme of private servers F R E S H...
---
But you're right classic is out and here for awhile, but there's always alts to level :)
---
Don't believe his lies, this video is clearly a deepfake.
---
-Also Warrior
---
They're out there. For sure. Just like BoE epics are out there.
---
That's the point of the thread dipshit
---
I‚Äôm duo leveling rogues rn and I went combat as my buddy went daggers. This is absolutely true. We‚Äôre always neck and neck expect for when his ambush one shots.
---
*To be fair*.....at that low a level, it's possible they had no idea what taming is because they're new players. It IS still possible they were just being nasty, but they could also have been new players who'd never played hunter.
---
He drops a green, just like all high level rares.  The exception to this are the ones that drop blues.
---
Yes it's called retaliation you can live through it once every 30 minutes
---
if you were the only enchanter. yes.
---
as it is though, more no than yes.
---
I see no problem here. They even went so far as to explicitly draw you a map guide
---
How does it work for MC? Can you only re-join the same raid group ID? Or if you kill 1 boss you can join other raids that have killed 1 or more?
---
Short answer; maybe. 
---
Depends on if you value 150 mana over 90 health and however nuch you‚Äôd gain from the 14 spirit. 
---
Definitely not if there‚Äôs a warlock or priest in your party.
---
&gt; fury wars wearing leather wouldv been kicked for being ninjas
---
maybe if you were playing with shit players
---
It's not so much as adding dps but find a build that I can raid with and tank instances.
---
It rarely adds 100%. Read up on spell coefficients.
---
I reccomend checking out the classic wow rogue discord. They will have a link to big macro dumps.
---
People do realise that the authenticator eliminates the automated tracking right? Since that system is close to impossible to hack through (you can't just hack the account you have to go through the login servers and systems). 
---
Setup a token if you're worried and it wont be an issue. Without it you have a 50/50 chance of getting banned.
---
Most women I‚Äôve known like hunters which is wild because they have some more complicated mechanics than most but are incredibly easy to play even if you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing. 
---
Any clothie is pretty easy/fun to play. Warlocks are, in my opinion, a good balance of fun, appeal, and complexity.
---
The truth of a combo is any combo functions for wow classic leveling if the goal is to have fun. Hope this helps.
---
I would just find a new guild. There are so many guilds still filling out their core teams and are doing simple MS&gt;OS rules. I‚Äôd just join one of these. 
---
You‚Äôre never going to get gear joining a guild that is already established. At least not until the game has been out for longer and these established guilds have geared out their entire core team...which will be very long with 40 people.
---
Dat wing clip spam uptime
---
Two fold:
---
Blizzard is stupid
---
Players would be stupid to take it. They have to A) hope there is enough alli going to start on that server or already be 50/50 or somewhere close while also having a healthy population. Lots of factor in that choice that make it bad
---
He also looked like a retarded goat
---
I feel like alliance always has a lvl 60 buddy doing the questgrinds for them... As well as hordes being mostly solo/duo when questing and alliance bloody partying up 5 people even when grinding drop quests...
---
'alright'
---
This whole thing is amazing
---
Great story. Thanks for sharing and sorry for your loss.
---
Just wonder why you assume that good Mage has to be frost.
---
I'm guessing you just learned what ad hominem means, seeing as how you said it in every conversation lmao
---
Best addons for healers? Cheers
---
so after you accumulate some good crit chance would you say dagger spec is better?
---
YES! it is a wonderful way of dealing with non-taunt immune things. It gives all the other threatmongers (WARRLOOOCKS) a chance to go all out.
---
Play another spec. There are several different, fun ways to play each class.
---
But, rogues are combo point dependent, so you might just dislike the idea of building points to unleash a finisher. Perhaps play a different class? I would recommend a Druid. You'll have a lot of buttons and abilities.
---
Classic is super simple compared to later expansions which is a turnoff for many (myself included). Still having fun, but healing is really a 1-2 button thing until tbc...
---
Can't remember what it's called, but you need a bar showing mana when in cat/bear form - very important.
---
As a tank, it's very helpful to have a unit frame addon that colours them according to aggro.  When you're tanking, mobs that you have aggro on will be green; mobs that you don't have aggro on will be red.
---
Interesting, nothing to or from heartseeker. I guess we will continue to play on a heavily alliance server. 
---
On day 1 my group flipped a coin between stalagg and incindious. Didnt found out about how unbalanced stalagg was until we were already passed 30 and it became nearly impossible to quest as alliance. Now we transferred heartseeker a few weeks back and we have the opposite problem that there will be no horde to kill for phase 2. I wish that fucking coin landed on tails that day.
---
You need to have a cerain amount of hit chance to be able to hit the boss. Without hit raiting a huge portion if your spells/abilities simply wont even lend on the boss and hence huge dps loss.
---
Daggers are priced pretty low on AH because of all combat rogues, you can get blue dagger pretty cheap, 1-5 gold. I doubt that sword spec is SO much better then daggers if you can maintain the good equip
---
Thinking raid time is a function of dps output lmfao. Wipes dude.
---
google vanilla wow hit table (sometimes called attack table) and it will be explained. it's a complicated subject that needs some studying to understand.
---
The more of one thing you get, the more value the other things have. Gear optimization is finding the sweet spot where every stat has the same value.
---
As for hit, the value isn't strictly dependent on other stats. It's also a matter of not wasting your resources. If a spell misses, you've just wasted all of the mana cost on top of dealing no damage. Rogues get back some energy sometimes, but it's still a waste.
---
Been playing rogue for years, so the combo system isn't the problem.  But definitely going to change spec!
---
Admittedly I don't know why I slipped down the rabbit hole again lol.   Peace out
---
Totally new player here, took me 11 days played to get to 60. Gearing up wasn‚Äôt too long though as long as you don‚Äôt follow a pre bis list too faithfully..(you shouldn‚Äôt)
---
12 days should be a decent estimate.. on your off time, like eating or when you can‚Äôt play you can look at guides etc on the way
---
Those guys exaggerate. I'm a Priest 59 with almost 13d played. It's not my first time playing and I don't fool around a lot. Sure I occasionally I responded to help requests or the like, but not excessively so.
---
But 7 days? Yeah.. I say you can't do that that without either being a very experienced player or following an optimized step by step guide from 1-60.
---
I know what you meant.  I was just being an asshole lol.
---
45% base mana lol.. More like 8% or something like that.
---
From my second attempt onwards I specifically told people to not hit him and that I'm taming him. Then they would specifically come and kill him. One even /laughed
---
I use normals up to Rag then use greaters on Rag.  1 pre-pot then another as needed.

To you. To some people it‚Äôs like a second job they enjoy. To others it‚Äôs literally their job. Never forget you are not everyone. If you think you deserve to be in the leading guilds racing to be the first to clear content without putting in that kind of effort your delusional. If you enjoy just clearing dungeons and only dipping your toes into end game raiding then more power to you, but I‚Äôd keep your judging eyes off of people who do enjoy that, lest we start judging you for being a filthy casual.
---
If something is free, then they're making money off of you.
---
I xferred from skeram to Earthfury a few weeks ago, i dont regret it at all, earthfury is a dope server. Pug raids, good population, good economy, and great faction balance. Would love to see it go high pop.
---
But they are also limited resources. Nothing like a 0-1 charge MCP cause it‚Äôs BiS right?
---
The Feral in my guild uses them like potions.
---
My only KoS is rogues, also i'm playing gnome warlock named Cheeky so i'm receiving a lot of ganks
---
No, if you twink to all hell and kill low level mobs, dagger is better.
---
We'd recruit as many spriests as we can get... we have 0 :(
---
Sorry for your loss and grats for your gain )
---
No pet bar. But unlike Mithril Dragon that we get at Engineer 260 skills, it follows. 
---
Is it working as intended in Classic?
---
Fury tank is specifically set up to maximize threat generation, and when you're fury tanking, you actually do still need a shield for pulls where you're taking a lot of hits super fast, because of how block works in WoW.
---
So, if he's dying on a pull where it was like 5 or 6 mobs and didn't put on a shield, that's on him.  If he's dying on like molten giants and shit, well, that's really on the healers, because unless he's rocking like 3.8k hp, that should be a breeze to heal through.
---
For PvP, I agree, prep is essenstial. I would say that coldblood as well. For PvE, I wouldn't trade Adrenaline Rush and Blade Flurry for anything. These two cooldowns, paired up with SnD and finished(or started) with thistle tea makes you feel badass. While soloing boss if you add up evasion and riposte to it, it makes you feel like a real badass cutthroat. I like how in Legion (or before, didn't play WoD) it became outlaw talent tree. I enjoyed raiding m+ and m raids as Outlaw, I really did. It was very cool experience and if classic + will be a thing, I would like to see Combat Spec evolving to Outlaw. Roll the Dice and Grappling Hook were my favorite abilities.
---
Ooh ok, I was asking people in game but nobody knew or care to answer, gotta wait then, shame it won't be this year since I like events in games.
---
Because then they'd have to admit that faction balance was actually a problem, which they've never done in the history of wow, despite the players complaining about it for the past 15 years.
---
I need to fan boy on streamers! Reeeeee
---
A lot of the time I'm the moron. I have pretty low spectrum autism so most of the time people don't notice it (which is still hard to admit because I always feel like people are going to rip on me for it), but it manifests when people tease me. I can never tell when a friend is ripping on me or genuinely making a negative comment (almost always ripping on me). Same thing with scams like these. If it's not as blatantly obvious as a "Nigerian Prince" scam it just won't occur to me to be critical of the situation.
---
You have a 1-100 chance of rolling either a hit miss dodge parry block or crit. Each of those has a base % and can be increased with gear and talents.
---
Most of our loot drama is inbetween mages and warlocks discussing who gets the mageblade. Mages think that it is called MAGEblade for a reason, and warlocks feel like thats not a valid argument.
---
Then the one rogue Blessed by RNGesus sitting with 35 crits.
---
You can only join the same raid.
---
I had so many mages attack me for being in their aoe spot. So instead of letting me slowly farm 1 mob at a time on my Pld. They end up with me waiting for them to pull and going after them for an hour. Even the ones I couldn't kill still lost their big pulls for being greedy.
---
&gt; in literally every aspect
---
nah, gearing is garbage,  professions are garbage, wpvp is garbage, realm identity is garbage, sharding is garbage. i get it that you enjoy getting babied by papa blizz, but pls lets not get delusional.
---
Water elementals hate him for this one trick
---
Does the guy next to you have the baron mount? Lol
---
The fight was literally impossible, could not be done, not in the best scenario.
---
u met a random dude on wow classic and ur wondering if its a good idea to share accs with him?? XDDDDDDDDD
---
You can turn off channel invites in social settings. Not seen any sign of gold sellers since, and regular players dont use it at all.
---
So basically, never pug?
---
Wtf are you talking about. I literally said 5 weapon skill gives 2% hit rating. Can you read?
---
I went 6 piece shadowcraft lbrs dagger mask unforgiven and strath ud dagger to raid
---
I am staring at the EU server lists at this very moment with more servers layered than not.
---
Best 2 man with resto sham would be lock IMO. That‚Äôs what I would want to pocket heal.
---
He said resist not miss.
---
Two different things. Resists can always happen. Miss however is skill vs defense check - hit.
---
Reduced spell resist as a stat becomes available in phase 5.
---
I am using Grid2 with mouseover macros.
---
Cat bad. Moonfire good.
---
Bought some weird leather frost and shadow resist shoulders that drop from school. Stuck them in the bank. Someone said they sell for 150g when naxx comes out. I figure 10g isn't a bad price. I think I can get at least that back.
---
This is fine.  Anything that you might want to use that requires stance change is a good skill to macro, eg overpower and intercept.
---
I'd say that I raptor strike about a third of the mobs I encounter at least once when leveling, not always because of pulling agro but because I have to move into the direction of the mob anyway, running past and striking works well for that.
---
Melee weapons are more relevant to hunters then people think, of course not as relevant that you should roll over a melee class
---
Its pretty fun playing double daggers ans trading off backstabs if you ever feel up to that. Probably not the best but it's fun lol.
---
Disclaimer: May or may not only work when barely anyone in the zone cares. (or its like early in the morning)
---
Hmmmm not really man. OP is a loot whore, no two ways about it. He didn't get loot, he rage quit like a baby. Let's not sugar coat it.

I hope you have loads of fun bro. Cheers!
---
&gt;It wasn't until I had entered all the details on my licence (didn't submit thank God)
---
Slightly off topic but the form could easily send the data *as you are typing* rather than when you hit the submit button, in fact that's how I would design a scam form if I was a piece of shit.
---
Their fault for eaves dropping...
---
even google doesnt know, seems about right
---
people here are always talking about the community and how much better it is yet the sub is full of the most self serving assholes they at the same time complain about.
---
Why do you need to play with those people? They obviously aren‚Äôt your friends if they behave this way. So unless your only with them because of the content they are clearing that benefits you why stay and put up with that? Your situation sucks, I feel bad that no one appreciates the time you spent helping other players. That isn‚Äôt anything wrong with the idea of Pre BiS though. That‚Äôs a problem with your guild not appreciating your efforts, so leave plain and simple.
---
I know it was the trinket that made the sheep, but felt weird right when it happened
---
Intellect also gives spell crit.
---
What movie was the original clip from?
---
Silly Alliance
---
I was confused at first as well, but then I just got the shit and used it and I do feel way stronger. It's weird.
---
Kinda what alliance has to do to get to MC on a 70% Horde server
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm u but stronger‚Äù
---
Shiiieeet that‚Äôs me now
---
Text/SMS can be spoofed very easily. It is not recommended for 2 factor authentication. Better use a dedicated  App, like the one from battle.net.
---
Sentences
---
This so much so
---
&gt;Rogues are slippery
---
In classic? I would argue that druids are slippery af, shamans too if played by a really good player but rogues? One dot on a rogue and hes basicaly done most of the times. Its the main reason why they arent good in BG's.
---
He said resist though. As a hunter you need to know this as well;
---
Resist is not miss. Miss is miss and resist is resist. The one has nothing to do with the other and they work on separate tables/rolls. So increasing your hit will not decrease the mobs chance to resist but your chance to miss.
---
Decrease targets chance to resist spells is a stat that becomes available in phase 5. For now its just this annoying thing that happens and you just have to play and plan around it.
---
Time for a Mak'gora.
---
There are so many noob mages right now it's ridiculous. To be fair, I've tried to help out as many as I could, they usually tell me they're just new to the game. But holy shit, the amount of times I've seen a mage use blizzard on a single mob...My goodness.
---
Spell power = spell damage and healing.   
---
If the item gives 10 frost dmg, it will add exactly 10 dmg (not a random 1-10 value). HOWEVER each and every spell has a coefficient.  
---
Frost bolt receives approx 85% of your total spl dmg I think.
---
you can almost walk up there from burning steppes. its very easy to do.  
---
if you wish to return.
---
Should have just put the guy on ignore as soon as he started flaming.
---
Boss max HP was a 32bit number, yes. And literally everything is natively handled in a power of 2 in a computer due to how a processor works.
---
what a mental case. some people just think they are entitled to the world
---
Makes sense. Does it also do that for healing?
---
That Hunter will never need to buy ammo again.
---
I am joking of course.
---
imagine not being able to find a grp 10pm into the night cus every has work the next day. wouldn't happen in faerlina

Nothing happens, horn gone from backpack

Nothing happend, horn gone from his backpack.

wow

Just have a macro that equips your dagger when you cast ambush and another macro to that equips your sword when you use Sinister Strike.
---
you're the stupid one, i already explained EXACTLY why you deserved it
---
if you don't know how to read, that's on you
---
Thanks for the reply. How are you getting this info?
---
I also main a mage and it's true, people new to classic read guides that said mage was the best and chose it, and have absolutely no idea how to play it. NoobMage  is the new Noob Hunter. I hope it is just a fad!
---
This wasn't on the Bloodsail buccaneers server was it? Are you a human rogue?
---
Hunters could replace it with MC gear as well. For rogues it‚Äôs literally bis even during AQ40.
---
Dude, I remember watching this video back in the day. It inspired me to want to play a Mage. I got to Tanaris and AoE'd pirates and got bored.
---
Rogue is strong at 19. Back in '06 when I was fresh to the game, I had a garbage geared (some white items, lol) 15 rogue when I started dabbling in WSG. I consistently did very well on that guy, and then a twink guild took me under their wing and shared that world with me. It was then that I decided to make the bigger commitments and go after the impossible shit like AGM and Fishing Day gear. I never did get my AGM, but the fun I had on my 19 was endless. I chased a 40+ mage out of Elwynn Forest for fucks sake! It don't get any better than that :D
---
Bottom line: For very little commitment, you can get some good miles out of a 15-19 rogue. For a lot of commitment, you can be the grey-level boogeyman to many mounted invaders of your lands.
---
It‚Äôs not about difficulty. Let‚Äôs say there‚Äôs 100 players wanting to run MC and we have 40 slots. 60 people don‚Äôt get to come with us. How do we choose who comes? Whoever has the best gear. How do we determine what‚Äôs the best gear? Make a BiS list for each class and take the people who are closest to it. Simple as that. Glad you made it work in all greens but if your group ditched you for a better geared healer that wouldn‚Äôt be their fault. Unless you have your own guild, spots in end game raids will always be given to the players with the better gear. So if you want to make sure you always have the best chance of raiding you do your best to have that gear. Simple as that.
---
Census addon
---
lol
---
Yes
---
Additive, each peace of gear with "% spell hit". Everthing that says just "% hit chance" is for physical dmg.
---
However read my response to him above. And to get a better understanding of hit/resists I'd suggest google, the wiki explains it in detail.
---
Mages always level fire blast. I really hope so.
---
Within the context of the video, that area is a small circle, there isn't much room.
---
Well when hooked on phonics didn‚Äôt work for you, what should you expect would happen?
---
The graveyard is riiiiight next to the camp. Maybe he just wanted to get away before the overleveled mage got back.
---
Some say he is still there killing lions to this day.
---
this has happened to me 3 times on thalnos
---
As you get more experience you‚Äôll  figure out which bosses ppl prefer skipping. Vectus is sadly one of those because of his trash mobs. You‚Äôll need to make sure your group is fine to clear him before you start the dungeon.
---
I thought Blizzard broke the census addons weeks ago.
---
That is literally a bis where a warrior needing it makes no difference. They only have like three charges on the use ability so you will have to keep farming a lot of them if you want to keep using it. Without using the use ability it is a really bad weapon at 60.
---
5% for pvp.
---
9% yellow hit cap for lvl 63 bosses @ 300 weapon skill. 6% with 305 weapon skill.
---
Everyone knows a boomer is obviously anyone born before like 1998
---
Play with non-retail players. The game is doing great and more content just came out :)
---
Which addon do you use to check proc percentage
---
I know. It sucks. I already rerolled, had days to think about it and I think overall its just easier to play what other people want me to rather than what I want to. It sucks but its how players have deemed things to be.
---
Hope this example makes this more clear: 
---
Let's assume you have a 9% chance to miss your special melee attacks, or a 17% chance to miss your spells against a target 3+ levels above you. So of every potential 1 DPS, you only do 0.91 or 0.83 of that DPS. 
---
If you increase your melee hit by 1%, this goes up to 0.92 DPS, which is a 1.1% effective increase. 
---
If you increase your spell hit by 1%, this goes up to 0.84 DPS, which is a 1.2% effective increase. 
---
So you can see that the lower your initial chance to hit is, the more impactful 1% hit actually is. Keep in mind that quite a large portion of your DPS as melee are white hits, for which hit chance is even lower if you are dual wielding (thus the effectiveness of hit on this part of your DPS is even higher).
---
Dude.  
---
You shoulda just gave her the water.  
---
oWo
---
Nicely done my friend haha
---
Yea, played priest since vanilla. 11 days played for me to 60. Likely no more than a day afk. At these guys sub-10 day estimates it is all about following a guide to minimize running and flights. I despise mindlessly following one though and was willing to pay the time. Will do so on all alts as well. I like that my journey will be different each time.
---
Sure, they are not. That does not mean, however, that guilds cannot clear MC and Ony in one night. In fact, there are guilds that clear both in well under two hours and thats with breaks.
---
Actually there is a guild for you: UC elevator victims.
---
Isn't speaking with other factions like this breaking the game ToS?
---
Its pretty bs unless they can detect vpn ips. Ive different ip everyday
---
I‚Äôm so jealous of these developed server economies.... swiftness pots are like 5s each on mine. FAPs are still 10s a pot, etc
---
If you're having trouble progressing: loot council.
---
If you're not having trouble progressing: DKP or have people roll on the gear. Let RNG be the decision maker.
---
If you want to make things simple: make rules for what specs can roll before they roll on things. Otherwise you might have dagger rogues rolling on swords or ret paladins rolling on shields, etc.
---
Okay, if you still dont get it, im gonna stop now, because i wont be able to get through to you.
---
This is the reason they can have more people pr. layer:
---
&gt;First and foremost, players have leveled up and spread out around the world. This allowed us to accommodate more players per layer, which means fewer layers required per realm 
---
But please explain to me, if layering affects queues, and there was an abundance of layers at launch, why were there 3-4-5 hours queues on servers in the beginning? Could it be that layering did affect server population, but was a means to not overcrowd the starting areas? This is in line with the quote above. Im still waiting for some kind of source for your claim that more layers = higher server pop. Note that just because a layer CAN contain the population of a entire server, does not mean that it WILL contain the population of an entire server. That wouldnt negate the problem of the overcrowded starting areas.
---
i was already full ive done nothing but eat gnomes my entire time in stv
---
how biizzare, how biizzare
---
In my opinion you should just focus leveling as fast as possible if you dont want to take it slow for the roleplay experience. If you use the time you use for pickpocketing during leveling to farm gold at 60, you will make 20 times more gold for the time spent, so its very inefficient.
---
I leveled alt rogue during vanilla and it was ok, but he was very twinked with best blues and enchants.
---
you sound super angry, everything okay?
---
That's how I kited Gamon from Org to Silithus
---
yes those are reusable to remake the event for others
---
I mean, if he would have offered me enough for mine and other people time then I guess fine, I could help him out. But first, his friend should say something beforehand, he pointed out about his friend doing Strat to get this mount but nothing about waiting for him 20 minutes, him coming to our dungeon and me and my guildies having to wait to do our run. We were on timer as well due to raiding night, we have attendance / being on time DKP so it's not like I had a lot of time to do the instance anyway.
---
Stonescale eels are selling for like 20s a stack on my server. It‚Äôs fucking brutal
---
Everything you just said proves what a bad player you are. "I dont like to heal as shaman" lol. And if you really are beating other real dps then your guild is total shit. Thats really sad.
---
Didn't know there was a bl spawn. We sure this is live?
---
its painful. you are the worst version of every class. imo bear is terrible at this level, you take a little less dmg, do equal or  (maybe) less dmg than auto-attack/moonfire, and it costs way too much mana to switch between forms to heal. it might not be the fastest, but it was the least frustrating was to autoattack, moonfire, rejuv. i didnt notice improvement until around lvl 30 when you become a rogue that can heal. its a big upgrade from there to 60

and posting on this subreddit with a screenshot of them on their mount. ssssss

Try and make an in-game ticket..  blizzard can see if it happens and most likely will help
---
[This helped me tremendously] (https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d1mr1j/dungeon_leveling_guide/)
---
we sure this isn't NetEase trying to make some extra cash?
---
The problem is that pre-40, there's no ice barrier, which definitely pushes the advantage to the favour of the rogue. (Though obviously not on that low HP, this mage was just bad).
---
It‚Äôs a bug that was quashed in TBC but it existed in 1.12 Vanilla.
---
This need to go up.
---
Thanks for the reply. I'll check the addon tomorrow. If you are right about a server cap of 4500 in Phase 2 it's no wonder Blizzard isn't spreading that news. There will be a huge outcry.
---
I pay a sub to wowhead, so you're welcome I suppose?

We got our second binding last ID - I think it is still something rare to already have both!

Damn. Immersion ruined!!1111

I'm not exaggerating, I'm just going off of his term "good efficiency". If we're talking casually playing and mixing it up and playing to have fun that's another story, I agree that it can definitely take longer. But I thought we were talking about good efficiency like the guy I am replying to. I'm not saying there's something wrong with not playing extremely efficiently. But it appears I came off that way.
---
Get the mod Extended Character Stats. It really helped me out on gear decisions. You can see how a piece of gear effects all your stats. 
---
And MP5 alone isnt much... But it means a lot when you can stop casting for 5 seconds and regen 30-40 mana per 5 youve stacked.
---
Ur mom
---
They depended on /who commands running in the background by the addon and were blocked like 5 days into classics release after Blizz changed something in the api.
---
Classicrealminfo ran of crowd sourced logs which worked longer than the addons. But we honestly have no idea anymore. Its all just estimates and zero data.
---
Reported!
---
Amen. There's no excuse to not at least have some cheap vendor bought food on you. Or bandages. Its called a GROUP after all. You're working as a GROUP. Everything you do should be with the mindset of: "How can I help my group?"
---
If Ur willing to skill sub Go brd pickpocket... Van kill 3 bosses there
---
Even with Cross Realms, Area 52 is empty these days.
---
I didn't say every casual player should be sub-7 or sub-10 days played. He said good efficiency and I was basing my comment off of exactly that. I'm also not telling people how they should or shouldn't play.
---
So you're the guy who goes and necros decade old forum posts

"fun police", because running through dmn 20 times to gather world buffs would be so much fun.

---
I'm a big fan of this build, you get your healing Mana Regen which is arguably the most important thing from the tree for vanilla pally healing, and you get everything you need to be a really good tank. 
---
1 guaranteed crit heal and the rest of the talents in the holy tree just don't seemed to be worth in making you that much better of a healer than the prot stuff does at making you a reletively viable tank.
---
And any raid is generally happy to have sanctuary and an off tank that can actually tank unlike the builds without holy shield.
---
Anyone 56 or higher is dead.  Below that I'm more likely to help you.
---
I was raiding in pugs, it was free roll on all loot.  Not my fault I roll well.
---
Yes it's. I've made a  youtube guide with the spawns

---
Back in the day my 12 year old ass fell for this..
---
I would say no. If a pet is getting hit, its by AoE and all the other melee players are getting hit too. Jimmy john won't be too pleased that he died because Porkchop got a heal.
---
Also, the hunters can heal it. Also, it loses nothing by dying, though the group might lose some DPS (marginal at best if they aren't a beast master), and overall its just not worth it.
---
I don't think anybody except the most hardcore raiding guilds that care about optimizing absolutely everything will care about whether hunter DPS falls off.
---
Oh boy, this brought up memories of AV trade wins talked on irc.
---
I'm getting f old.

Typical horde behaviour
---
Mage is a safe and boring option. Overly popular in classic and they‚Äôre certainly powerful, but have an awful reputation in the community. Play what will make you happy in the end. It‚Äôll be fun either way.
---
Didn‚Äôt Ion post proof it was mathematically impossible back in vanilla?
---
Dude just hasn‚Äôt been outside in a while lol
---
What do you mean won't let you reset? Resets are infinite, it's entranced that are capped. If it didn't reset it meant for that one run you were still logged on your main and in the instance. That is the only time it will block resets.
---
gotcha :) thank you for your time. I‚Äôll most likely go sword spec pre 40 at least. I play on an RPPvP so i‚Äôll be dabbling in PvP a bit while leveling so I‚Äôll most likely respec for a Semi-PvP build after 40. Do you have any recommendation builds for PvP?
---
From the actual game mechanics. Holy Light is a smaller heal - even with Blessing of Light - than the other slow single target heal and Flash of Light is significantly smaller than the other quick heals (much less the slow heals).
---
There's also nothing Paladins can do that comes even close to Prayer of Healing or Chain Heal in terms of throughput.
---
well i saw this many people in all the expansions..
---
It is! To be honest, I love Ulduar as a whole! Most fun raid in Wrath, IMO.
---
to avoid playing with a bunch of twitch retards?
---
I can hear the fast breathing and the pounding in the keyboard
---
I didn‚Äôt even consider that lol but no self respecting mage would give me water I bet :p
---
&gt;are better at changing their role midfight
---
Literally the idea of a druid's design. Designed with the "hybrid tax" so they can only perform about 90% of the other classes, overall, but also able to fill all roles with corret build/setup.
---
i have a question about this we have 3 computers in the house connected to the same internet can i use different pcs when playing?
---
Why D:
---
I am very close to leaving. I grew attatched to the casual crowd it started with but disagree with the direction it's moving. 
---
Kind of have been in the air because the others are undecided and I don't want to just leave them behind,  we all joined a guild to build something,  I still want to do that. 
---
But it IS a problem with the idea of BIS, when PREBIS is all that's weighted with things like getting into raid or whether you deserve raid loot, I think the WHY you dont have all your prebis is absolutely tie in. Doesn't matter if you helped other members get theirs, you don't have yours. Thats a mentality this gear hunt has created.
---
Wait, are you me? Did i write this? Haven't slept in years
---
Hahahaha drop a totem for them :p
---
Without a questing add-on or leveling guide, I guarantee you will miss a lot of quests in retail.  You miss way more by not using it than by using it.
---
A part of me feels like China is pushing these posts so people get distracted.
---
Not that I‚Äôve seen o.O
---
You can certainly do either, but depending on how you level, swords may be faster. For example I did a ton of grinding (other than a few quests and dungeons for certain gear upgrades), so I really liked being able to just walk up to a mob and spam SS until its dead. Plus every few minutes I can pull 2-3 mobs and AoE them. Now this Rogue was my first character so I didn't have much gold for leveling gear.  
---
I have a friend who's currently doing a pretty similar leveling method via grinding but he's doing daggers so he's grinding mobs with low armor so that his Ambush can take out a good chunk of health. I would imagine it can be pretty fun with a decent speed if you have the gold and can buy good twink/leveling gear to keep up with gear upgrades (same with Swords too as well I suppose).
---
Disable DBM HUB under Questie settings.
---
Now add kings, instants, crits, snd etc.
---
lol yeah, as if the horde ever 1v1's . if you beat us, you beat us because you're 20 lvls higher, or 2-3+ vs 1.
---
Had a mage like that. He was complaining about me picking up all the herbs. I started leaving herbs for him. He did not pick up any herbs. Turns out, he was not a herbalist...
---
Private servers maybe? Are you for real?
---
But they tell me I'm a tall one all the time...
---
you're not getting over level 15 in those zones
---
i already told you, we're FORCED to go to redridge
---
*laughs in the 20+ times i got killed by the same 60 rogue*
---
Then dont fucking cry when you arnt invited to raids.
---
Just talk when you join the group. ‚ÄúI have all tanking gear so rolling on dps‚Äù or whatever it is
---
going out of your way to get "leveling" bis and enchants would slow down your overall leveling process? 
---
Usually you just do your 5 dungeon quests for each dungeon and get back to questing afterwards. 
---
Only certain circumstances would warrant farming out an item (ravager for example).
---
The best advice to speed up your leveling isn't gear or enchants, it is using time efficiently and tracking xp/hr
---
On my server light leather regularly costs 18-25 copper each, medium for 55-65 and heavy for 1,55-1,75. Leather working worth it?
---
This is just one of the many areas in which the skill plays a factor, really. If a good mage is a little alert (i.e. not in the middle of farming), he'll respond too quickly to allow you to do an Ambush &gt; Backstab. A good mage also won't allow you to restealth from an ice block. This is also one of the silly parts of these discussions, as it's often a sequence of "you can do X!" followed by "a good player will avoid/counter that perfectly". There's some truth to the arguments, of course, but the fight is too volatile to apply any strict rules to.
---
Ironforge was originally the only Alliance city with an auction house, so that sort of made it the place to be by default.
---
But the big open space to hang out in between the bank and auction house in Ironforge is really nice. Always see random discussions there in /say etc.
---
The baby wasn't holding its candy hard enough. Not my fault it has a baby grip. You're a dick. The fact you don't understand that what you did was dickish actually just shows you're a bigger dick than we originally thought. Enjoy your pixels.
---
The point is dalrends are such a small upgrade over 2x UD strat axes that it's not even worth attempting to get them. Much smaller drop rate, higher competition, and a lot of angry players if you do win the roll.
---
Comming from Teldrasil through Ashenvale to this place, I nearly cried the first time.
---
And you do all of that at a sub par level. Grats! :)
---
Tanking RFC can be tough because you got so few abilities to hold aggro. It gets better. I'm at lvl 25 with my warrior, tanking SFK, and I barely lose aggro during big pulls.
---
PvP definitely even during the leveling phase thanks to bombs. You can craft early level helmets to equip. Let me tell you though, those bombs are really useful because rogue leveling in general sucks ass so if you accidently pull a 2nd mob you're fucked unless if you have cooldowns. But with bombs it'll help out a lot.
---
For east i believe 56 is more than fine.  
---
At 57  u can start clearing west (but take it slow, some mobs hit quite hard)
---
59-60 for North. You'll have a pretty hard time towards the end of the dungeon if underleveled and not properly geared.
---
booooooo, enforce faction balance you turds
---
And if you don't like playing the game, why are you playing the game?
---
Yes.
---
Apparently hard mode Mimiron was way harder, at least according to Kungen.
---
Is this a 2006 Runescape post?
---
And thats why you are bad
---
Seems I wasn't the only one who was chased indefinitely by an elite dwarf from Blackrock Mountain. Thinking nothing of the dwarves, I ran right through one thinking I could shield and blink away no problem since my guild was waiting on me to turn a quest in to Maxwell. Boy was I wrong. 
---
It chased me through the mountain, nipping at my heels as I ran up the center column, diminishing both of my shields quickly. Health and mana were low. I blinked across the chain, finally making it to the exit of the mountain, thinking surely this was it. He must reset soon. 
---
He kept chase. I ran across the entirety of the Burning Steppes on foot, within an inch of my life, avoiding enemies left and right, saving my last bits of mana for blinks when inevitably this Usain Bolt of a dwarf would catch up to me.
---
Then I saw it. The encampment where the singular ? was ready for me to turn in... if I could just... run... a little... YES! Success! I turned in the quest, accepted the next, and Shia LeDwarf gave me the sweet release of death. It was finally over.
---
Except it wasn't. Suddenly in guild chat, "What did you do to piss this guy off?!" I looked back. A low level guildmate happened to arrive at camp the moment I died. SHIA SURPRISE! This dwarf wasn't satisfied with my death alone.
---
I screamed, "PERIUS, NOOOO! RUNNNN!" It was useless. He was lower level, and stood no chance alone. I released, scrambling to get back to my body, and when I returned I was met with sounds of death as the dwarf went on a killing spree, slaying every last person in sight.
---
Bodies. Bodies everyhere. This dwarf single-handedly annihilated all of the unsuspecting travelers hoping to find refuge within the encampment. 
---
Shia LeDwarf will forever be remembered and feared for his endless stamina and thirst for death.
---
pretty sure its +2% hit,  +.2 % crit and -1% chance to be dodged or parried.

And this is how raid loot gets distributed incredibly inefficiently. So many people with this mentality are going to be really salty when they actually start raiding
---
Was thinking about leveling a lock just to "sell" those mount runs for 100g but then I remembered classic leveling speed.
---
Hahaha I laugh (at least in my head..) every time they say that. Love it.
---
Link?
---
This might come as a shocker. But even a PuG can have nice atmosphere and people putting others ahead of themselves.
---
Classic doesn't have to be a faceless 'screw these randos over' -fest. Leave that in retail where it belongs.
---
I watched streamers playing games I couldn't due to hardware and budget limits back when I was in college, with not enough money to buy myself PC good enough to handle new titles. When classic was released, I only watched streams during beta due to not being able to get into beta myself. Other than that, I think I have been watching twitch since classic released :D
---
This is just really dumb. I hate it when people that know nothing about the game talk about things so confidently
---
The fuck kinda bullshit is this? I dont mind healing but I am much more comfortable with druid or priest. Doesn't make me a bad player for not finding a certain play style right for me...
---
That's why they have multiple classes and multiple specs.
---
Just try it out and always be ready to switch to 1h and shield if the situation calls for it.
---
I tank every non-raid instance like that no problem.
---
WeakAuras 2. I use it to replace my entire UI. Completely customizible beyond what any other addon can.
---
Pros:
---
Dynamic UI that pops up to shows cd's, timer debuffs/what have you.
---
Least amount of clutter.
---
Waga.io lets you take advanced scripts and easily incorporate into your own UI.
---
Cons:
---
Takes longer time to setup than you average UI addon.
---
It can be really hard to figure out why a custom made script isn't working due to a lack of error messages in Classic.
---
Looks like Chromie is fucking about again
---
There are people on both sides bitching about people's playstyles and I don't find it healthy.
---
Actually, i was playing on alts on tuesday, figuring the instance would be released wednesday. Logged off and didnt notice the announcement fast enough to log back in on main. 4000+ que.
---
So no, i wasnt there. I was there yesterday, no alliance in sight.
---
Yes but you can still pvp if you turn on pvp  and if I casting blizzard on a pack of mobs and the horde flagged for pvp it inns into the blizzard it will flag me.
---
Yea I think the issue is something I get to involved in the numbers. Because I‚Äôm new to wow I keep trying out the different classes because I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs good/what I wanna play and wanna make sure I enjoy the class before committing to 60.
---
Imagine making every post with a gnome in it about arbitrary fantasy race hate.  
---
You do you tough guy.
---
Downvote because washed up on stalagg is cancer colluding with grizzly

And it doesn't benefit from multipliers like kings.

Turn off channel invites. 5 days played and I've had no spam.

You don't need the be breathed yourself right? Just drop the sword and move away?

What kind of RP character names themselves Muddaearth?
---
The only reason I like to use two-handed weapons when I can is because the extra dps really seems to help with threat,thank you for your response you really put this in a way I had not considered.
---
why are u assuming all of twitch is retard?
---
Kek
---
Time for daily mage circle jerk?
---
I've been doing a lot of SM runs both as 2H and with a shield. Both were fine. With a 2H mobs die faster and it's easier to hold aggro, but you're taking more damage. I found that once I included the extra time needed for my healer to drink, it wasn't faster.
---
I suggest getting King Bangalash.  He‚Äôs easier to get than broken tooth, and is just as good if not better.  Required level 43 to tame and he‚Äôs damn good.  Cats are good Bc of dash, and you + your cat tear up clothies like mages and locks who then can‚Äôt get a cast off Bc they‚Äôre getting constantly hit
---
Would BRD be a good start as I haven‚Äôt done that yet? I plan to attempt it in the morning.
---
Its funny because its true.
---
You‚Äôd have to be an absolute moron to transfer off of any server that doesn‚Äôt currently have a queue. In vanilla WoW server population is everything. A server can never be too big up until the point where there is a queue. Don‚Äôt make the mistake and transfer to a dead or unbalanced server.  The only thing that can‚Äôt handle large populations is the Blizzard servers. Better economy, better time finding groups, more world PvP and community events, more options for guilds. There are few downsides such as tougher competition for world resources (but it‚Äôs ok because those resources are valued higher anyway so it evens out). The positives of being on a high pop server *vastly* outweigh the negatives up to the point of having queues (except maybe if you‚Äôre on Faerlina). The world of warcraft should be busy and bustling in all zones. Take this as a warning from the many who have taken the ‚Äúfree‚Äù transfer and regretted it.
---
Happens on the other side of the fence too: I see a gnome and I expect to see a mana bar, when I see a non blue resource bar beneath health I am like "WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE".
---
Hard to read is it mate? I don't do that, I just expect it from PuGs. 
---
And as someone who played vanilla back in the day I can assure you that's how most people played then as well.
---
What the fuck?
---
You literally explained what we did 15 years ago. I think ill prefer just nuking it down at the his spawn spot.
---
Yeah, the #arresteddevelopment screaming and bleating in a pug that he deserves something more than anyone else will be the one on insta-ignore and idling in a major city.
---
"assuming" lol
---
Umm, people act in Manors all of the time, to which manor do you refer? I am pretty sure Downtown Abbey is filmed mostly in a Manor.
---
Stalaggs purely horde lol
---
Fuck Un'goro. I never go there if I can avoid it. Un'goro and Silithus are the fucking worst.
---
How bizarre how^ bizarre^^
---
The number of people who seem to think I'm saying I do this is insane. I don't. I just expect it from randoms and am usually correct, there's no point being upset over it.
---
Traditional PvP subtelty build is the way to go. You'll want the 5 stacks of improved stealth, improved stealth speed and very importantly you'll want preparation so you can vanish again more frequently. 
---
I was pickpocketing LBRS, I found I got more heavy junkboxes per hour there. I would do a typical rotation through the dungeon, similar to how you would clear it normally. As you get to the ogres, where the tribute pile is, I would jump down to the bridge below and complete the cycle again :)
---
Have fun and good luck
---
Did it on Razorgore which usually has queue. Didn't got ganked once, but I killed a few alliance though :)
---
Certain pservers until WOTLK
---
I tried this addon and I can configure the settings in game but the actual mana bar doesn‚Äôt show, even when enabled. Any idea why?
---
I have never seen the combination Cold Blood and Preparation.
---
YO this is funny man.
---
Like actually funny good stuff.
---
Nobody cares about anything you have to say, I think I'm going to ignore you now.
---
As you do more tanking in dungeon, you will also start gathering knowledge on what kind mob does heavy melee damage, where most caster mobs do spell damage(shield/amor does nothing). 
---
So go 2 hand tanking and have fun. On the other hand, they are mostly off spec healer during leveling, so if your healer is a pally/shammy with str/agi gears, put on a shield.
---
Hunter doesn't fall off until very late, and only in the limited world of raiding. They are still hugely useful in PvP, as solos, non-raid instances... and they still have an important place as ranged dps in raids, they just do a bit less pure dps than some other classes.
---
I agree with this until you get Cheap Shot, Stealth at last possible inch, mouseover Distract, Pick Pocket, Cheap Shot. You take less damage and spend less time eating and end up with more gold and lockpicking skill.
---
If i play healer, i love when i see my tank using a 2H, if they are using 1H it often signifies that they have no idea what they're doing.
---
For low level dungeons atleast
---
All of us got scammed like this at some point in Diablo 2. I know it's hard to imagine someone falling for this, but it obviously happens often enough for it to be "worth it".
---
That‚Äôs the thing, though. This is pre-raid BiS. They aren‚Äôt paying whatever it takes to be ‚Äúthe best, strongest, fastest, most-geared‚Äù. They‚Äôre paying to be very very very very very *very* marginally better equipped for their first few raids, which is where most of their *actual* best gear will come from.
---
Oh :( what usually is the better combos?
---
That's just something we'll have to live with as long as streaming is so popular.
---
I've always said it and will keep my stance that most of these guys were basement dwelling nolifers 15 years ago with barely any social skills. The only difference now is that they have a camera in their face and get to spout their gibberish to an audience that actualy listens to them.  
---
Before nobody liked them and suddenly they have their own following of people who gobble up their nonsense. Add to that the competition for viewers and what you get is some fake persona trying to come up with ways to attract viewers at any cost even if it means being a complete imbecile.
---
I don't like it but in the same vein most of these guys are so fucking stupid it hurts and when this fad dies out they will continue being unemployed leeches.
---
Sorry, but you are a dumbass to even consider it. I would never let someone I met three days ago, let alone not in person to use my account . How old are you?
---
e
---
Not this one, go back.
---
That was golden
---
As a healer main, I would say it is acceptable if you are highly geared or several levels higher than the instance we are doing. If you are actually risking a wipe by not using a shield, provided I do my job to the best of my ability, then that is not really fair to the rest of the party.
---
There is no way. But if you re not in a hardcore guild you can specc aoe for this tier anyway
---
This is why Vanilla is a masterpiece.
---
Yes, I started healing brd at 52,
---
I was lucky enough to be in some guild lbrs runs from 53,
---
53-57 consisted of lbrs runs and mainly brd.
---
Then from 57 onwards I did a lot of strath and scholo.
---
I think it took me two weeks to get from 52-60. 
---
I did only a handful of quests between then but I found my fun in dungeons, as it kept me on my toes
---
I do itemless/suitless tribute myself, so I'm aware.
---
But I'm assuming there is a lot of players that buy them, might explain the price
---
That's where you "EZ"
---
I forgot the /s at the end sorry..
---
This spec is one of the most played rogur speccs in pvp ;-)
---
Exactly. 
---
‚ÄúSolve the problem we created for us by making your playing experience much worse! It‚Äôs free!‚Äù
---
lol, I actually thought he was trolling at first, but I think it's just damaged goods
---
My brother farmed that damn cat for hours every week from 50-60 and STILL only just got it yesterday...
---
Sounds more then fair,I only ever do it if the healer is ok with it and I‚Äôm not taking that much damage
---
No. Its quite a chain actually. Only small part of it is in Dire maul.
---
Idk why u expected people go back in time while playing classic. It's just todays society and people overall are just toxic.
---
Honestly, I get why back then the majority of people played alliance. Like basically every single horde character looks like absolute shit. At least in the creation screen. Was it not for me wanting to be Shaman (and the fact that I knew the majority would be horde and I wanted to actually raid) I would've played Alliance. 
---
I'll probably only begin playing an alt once BC is out and I can make a blood elfe.
---
Are you in a guild group? Why are you needing on those?
---
lol. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad I went from a high pop server to a low pop one! It‚Äôs better! can‚Äôt wait for it to become higher pop though‚Äù
---
 /s a c ‚Äö c √á√à ‚Äö f 30  for the mage.
---
Uh nah
---
You roll on Leather as a Warrior and a leather user needs it you are a ninja.
---
Do you respec resto every week for raid aswell? Fellow ele shaman
---
i was in one of these top guilds at the time. the lasers can target people in the stomach and cause auto wipe. healers transported = not enough dps = wipe. only dps get transported = no heals = wipe.
---
were we as good back then? no but a lot of the nerfs targeted mechanics as well as the numbers and that is why it was killed.
---
No king rules forever.
---
I got asked to Rez someone.... only problem is I‚Äôm a hunter.
---
I'm an idiot  lol. Thanks
---
Geeze not another one of you guys...
---
Your first comment was unhelpful unless he is level 60. If he is level 60 mobs will always be below his level but can still fully resist which is what was causing him issues.
---
Miss chance is only 4% against a mob of your own level meaning you will RARELY miss unless its a raid boss (17% miss chance if target is 3 levels above you). But all this info is readily available to you on the internet.
---
You keep downvoting my comments even though they are 100% correct and you understand none of it but keep responding. Go back to reading and learning about the game and stop spreading your poor understanding of things on the sub.
---
It‚Äôs not the same as private servers. There‚Äôs an elite there

Seriously. And I wish gamers were smarter in this too. It's gonna be so fun waiting for the BGs with those last 5 Alliance players on the other side. Little imbalance (60-40) is okay but who voluntaraly goes on a server dominated by one faction and plays that faction... That's just beyond my understanding lol.
---
I would assume so, but I'm not sure. Both class quests require the use of an instance, so I just kind of assumed it would work. It might not. Check wowhead or ask around in game. Good luck!
---
No, I am having a blast. Joined a guild with description I liked before classic even started, we did our first raid last week 8/10 MC, we did our second raid yesterday with Onyxia, MC 8/10 and we are back to MC in sunday to get Domo and Rag. It's been a lot of fun, no drama over drops, clear system, organization and leading. We don't have full raiding roster yet though but our 23-25 people roster is enough to raid for now \^\^
---
Lol... bruh, I hate to be the bearer of bad news but Like 50% of the DPS warriors BIS for classic is leather and mail...
---
For leveling, daggers are just not as good. As everyone is pointing out. However as much as I usually have an opinion on these "A or B?" posts, in this case I think the actual difference is minor enough that you should roll what you like more. If you are duoing, the daggers are more viable for backstabs. As a solo you will be doing a lot of stealth/gouging, but if you are into that then go for it. Maybe you'll be 57-58 by the time you would have otherwise been 60, it's not a huge deal.
---
We do not one shot every boss but we laugh. Play stupid music on discord. Drink beer. Give out dumbass prices etc. 
---
However I got stuck healing which I don't really like
---
To be honest, one of my worse memories was the endless waiting on buffs, healers that dont drink, warriors that wait 5 minutes before every pull etc...
---
This spellcleave meta was a big eye opener for me and I love it.
---
Classic isn't hard and dungeons are not hard. Coming up with new pulling stagedies to speed up the dungeons is one thing I love about the new meta and I'm curious about the new next level dungeon clearing strats people will come up with. Testing out all the limits and possibilities.
---
But impathient people will always be annoying. But I don't think it is much worce than 15 year ago.
---
That makes the whole thing even more insane. Not only is he a fucking lunatic he also considers one emote an RP lol which is just... pathetic given the circumstences.
---
Yeah, how come they get to do work that they enjoy doing and getting paid for it?! They should get regular jobs and be miserable like the rest of us! /s
---
I've seen posts like that on here, every posts that mentions streamers riles up a part of this subreddit.
---
I grinded a total of 2 levels to get to 60, unless you count a maraudon run quest run and doing mc/ony attunements as grinding.
---
Why would you block out the  website name?
---
The funny thing is, the chance is kind of normalized.  It tends to be a guild effort to get the main tank a windfury, and you can't really do anything to improve the rng.  You can dispute my first point, but I'm sure we'll do whatever we can to get our main tank all the mats required, if we're fortunate enough to see both bindings in time.
---
I think this happens in both factions. The exaggerator is everywhere.
---
Thanks,I may make a macro summing up what you just said.
---
Recount mostly.
---
Play with [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mDgzTHmaAQIIx-tZou4yxo0l9GOY5LlLRSmbLjOuCWM/edit#gid=729770934) and find out. (at least set bonuses vs +heal)
---
We farmed lashers back in vanilla. I'm a holy priest, I'm now lacking a proper income source (as I was counting on the lasher farm). And DM jump runs used to be one of the best income sources for tanks. 
---
I'm all for nerfing mage AoE farm but as a healer/tank I can't farm anything. Glad my mage alt is already 48.
---
TLDR: Is camping, doing nothing for hours fun for you?
---
I never knew that I would actually get camped playing as a druid, as someone who can go invisible anytime I want. But worse than camping, barricading someone. This is probably the few places in the game where you could block someone from getting into a certain zone. As your typically scumbag assassin, I kill anybody who's near me, thats why I'm on a pvp server. But I have never camped anybody, it's not fun, it's not fun waiting for something you have no guarantee of. If the person you're camping would use their head, they would simply call somebody higher level which would kill the camper (camper loses) or log out and do other things which would leave the camper doing nothing making it boring as hell (camper still loses). As I am writing this, the hunter is still blocking the tunnel (at 12 am...), only he has moved onto the other tunnel so I almost died again LoL. But I can guarantee you, this hunter will not be able to kill me again as I will switch to my alt, he will probably stay here blocking for hours, not killing anybody. So I ask again, Is camping fun for you?
---
Ah yeah, spamming sheep vs a attacking guards and a druid that can spam moonfire. Ofc
---
anyone know why its saying "Hook Failed!" on the top of my minimap like this?
---
[https://i.imgur.com/XOj7P8B.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/XOj7P8B.jpg)
---
Reminds me of wallwalking to get into unfinished/inaccesible areas back in the good ol days...
---
Dude, you suck. How long did it take you to tab to the barely-alive mob? That mage went full retard.
---
How so?
---
The second one is better if you plan on tanking stuff. Holy Power and Divine Favour are at current content level simply not needed once you get a decent healing gear going. Holy Shield however is a fairly good mana-efficient aggro+damage reduction ability that's while not mandatory helps quite a bit with the paladins sub-standard tanking.
---
I entered MC with almost full pre Raid BIS and 21 pts in holy. Only bosses I had to use a pot where Majordomo and Rag, anything else simply drops too quickly to notice the lack of crit. If you chug potions on cooldown and show up reasonable buffed you can pull it off without any points in holy.
---
I agree but unfortunately that irony is lost on these angry neckbeards as they love biting the hand that feeds them
---
Pretty sure that's the only new face they created after changing to the new model from the old nightmare fuel hunchback cronem model. The rest of the faces look like they were created with that old on in mind.
---
If u dont care about prebis until youre 60 the absolute fastest is to do zf grave runs til 52 then brd prison/arena runs 52-60. Get 3 mages and a healar and run as tank.
---
Very different situation and very misleading to compare them.
---
The logic in league was that a lucky crit in an early skirmish is worth a lot more than consistently higher damage since the burst is a lot harder to handle and really tips the scale.
---
In WoW the dpa is more important since the encounters aren‚Äôt between to equally strong characters where one needs an edge.
---
At Bfa launch
---
Content is easy enough, that we don't even really prioritize any of our tanks.  They'll all be geared in time for next phase.  I guess you could complain that they share some loot with melee dps, but it's far more important to gear the tank then the melee anyway.
---
If you wanna tame it you do it asap and restart the quest yourself
---
Everquest's progression servers were a huge success.   
---
If Blizzard is good at anything, it is stealing ideas.
---
Leveling my hunter atm, been told that set is the one I need.   
---
Curious what pre-raid alternatives you suggest instead (don't feel like farming rend that much, tbh).
---
o
---
It‚Äôs gna take a lot of research to figure this one out
---
"All the time" lol, stop exaggerating. Also no one is forcing you to read it
---
What kinda gear do you use? Just normal tank heat when tanking , healing when healing ? What about aoe farming
---
If you don't treat people fairly they won't come back.  Guilds like yours a dime a dozen.  Your incentives system won't be fair because people are flawed and incapable of being unbiased. 
---
It will turn into cronyism, crash and burn.
---
thx for the advice, I‚Äôll most likely respec some sort of seal fate daggers build post 40 when i can afford some better gear. going to give sword spec a try, at least for pre 40. thanks again
---
&gt; I'd rather have tanks who take maters in their own hands
---
The funny thing is hat's exactly what they're doing when they tank the raid that allows you to get gear lol
---
Yes I was thinking the same. Without winters chill and taking shatter instead for more solo usability?
---
Thank you,I assure you I don‚Äôt plan on tanking in leather anytime soon.
---
To not promote it in any way. Image could be taken out of context and whatnot.
---
thanks for the input, I barely know what i'm so any advice is helpful :D
---
Blizzard also claims that batching was in the game in vanilla despite it clearly not being the case. I have to wait for a second after hitting anybody with a frost nova or it gets broken by the last spell I cast.
---
Keep in mind that this is considering you are a good tank, knowing when to pop a cd, when to switch to 1h+shield, how to pull, what target to focus, how to deal with a dps pulling a pack.  
---
It's not always the healer's fault. At best, just use any dps as scapegoat since they are easily replaceable.
---
I'd just buy the cloth
---
And so, 2019 continues the trend of people pointlessly adding ‚Äòliterally‚Äô to sentences
---
There was no attitude before the third comment. Which was called for with your "know it all"/ignorant attitude when you keeo talking nonsense.
---
How is it irrelevant?
---
&gt;If you're pulling 5 mobs at a time, that's a 20% chance 1 will resist the nova.
---
No, thats not how math works at all. It wouldn't even be a 20% probability. And you immediately go and mix things up again, we were talking about miss now not resist. There is a 4% chance that you will miss a nova no matter how many mobs you pull, there is a higher probability of the nova missing but the chance is the same.
---
But I'm not going to explain how the universe works for you. There is school for that. Again, go fucking read, its all out there.
---
Your choice. But if you are not going to instance &amp; raid 7/24, you'll not regret it. Hunter is one of the best classes to solo farm contents. It was rarely that I tried to find other people to do elite quests. Also excluding mages, they are really successful to farm. %99.9 uptime while farming mobs. Mages always has a attack &amp; drink cycle but they can kill more than 5-10 targets at once. This makes kinda same mob per second.
---
These are your "friends"? As in you hang out with them IRL friends? Doesn't sound like the sort of treatment I would tolerate from friends.
---
Onyxia deep breathe theories were some of my favorite. Lots of people, like you said, even became superstitious about them.
---
Actually I got away by stunning him with pounce and dash then just powershifted his slows, however, I ran out of mana so I died again but I was already out of the tunnel when I died.
---
I thought he was RPing to be upset, wtf lol
---
First time on a PvP server? 
---
wipe away the tears, and find something else to do. 
---
It's been like this since forever.
---
You forgot to scream.
---
WoW Classic: The good thing about not having transmog is that you can really see and be impressed by the effort the best players have put in, because they‚Äôre the only ones in impressive, cool-looking raid gear.
---
Also WoW Classic: *the actual appearance of every single class‚Äôs raid BiS for half or more of the phases*
---
Congratulations still
---
Idk what server you're on or what levels you're referring to, but blue daggers around level 30 are 20-30 gold.
---
That looks like a ton of fun locking down a d area you cant ger through. 
---
Your not having fun so your wondering if this guy is? Hes having the time of his life. Your reaction is what he wanted. You have him his climax.
---
Also, until you get ferocious bite at 32 all you have is Rip as a finisher. Don't wait till 5 combo points to use it because enemies while leveling die too quickly. Just use it whenever the target is at about 50% health to get maximum benefit (bleeds also ignore armor).
---
When I was 40 in TBC, I just begged until someone actually took me and bought the mount for me
---
Would you say that it‚Äôs possible to play and farm stuff solo as a warrior? Or would I have to realistically find people to help?
---
im simply asking if camping is fun for people, bcs it is not fun for me. I am not whining, I simply want to know what a person who camps is thinking.
---
Sprint ready now!
---
Happy to help!
---
If u use the same time to farm gold at your own level, you can buy 10x the amount of cloth from ur dungeonboost
---
Seems that you had a bad  wc run. It's nice that you made friends after all
---
And now Backstreet Boys started playing in my head.
---
It's you're, not your. Damn Sankabark, git gud.
---
If you're gonna go for it with no charges, why not get something decent instead? MCP is *only* good because of the charges.
---
Fist of Omokk, Slavedriver's Cane, hell, even a green 'Of The Monkey' in the mid-50's massively outperforms a chargeless MCP.
---
Understood
---
Just buy it. For the amount you'd earn farming money at your level you'd get more cloth than by spending the same time in RFC and with less hassle, too.
---
For me, I only have an issue if those pushing the bleeding edge have a negative affect on production/release/design as a result of their powergaming. I get the powergaming itself. And that always seems to be the case, unfortunately, not the other way around.
---
It‚Äôs what you get for not leveling your warrior!
---
Just take another route?
---
The warrior is half leather and has bad gear apart from Ironfoe. If you got the plate DPS gear, sure go ahead. But with barely prebis he will shred the warrior.
---
If you just buy the cloth you save lots of time..
---
However, from a community standpoint: this one is a great thing! Id love to get carried through instances in no time getting quests and those gear drops that could help me speed up my own path to 60.
---
All depends on your approach to helping other or just thinking about yourself.
---
If someone spends hours upon camping, then i'd put 2 and 2 together and guess its fun for that guy.
---
Neither have I! \*cries in warrior\*
---
If I see a mage, doesn‚Äôt matter if he‚Äôs lvl 60 or 13 I‚Äôll crush that kumcake.. these blokes needs to feel atleast some resistance in this game.
---
From a fury warrior's perspective, hit and crit are huge. I'm gonna put aside the fact that crit and hit increase your damage the more ap you have and talk about the class specifics.
---
Without any hit gear, you have about a 17% chance to miss for white attacks and 9% for yellow attacks (for a 63 boss). The way the warrior rage works is you use white attacks to get rage and then spend it with yellow attacks (which you can think of bonus damage). If you miss white attacks you don't generate rage that you can use on the yellow attacks and if you miss on yellow attacks, you either loose the rage or loose a global cooldown (1.5 seconds) in your rotation, so your damage per second suffers. 
---
Crit chance serves two purposes. The first one is similar to the above, meaning that when you crit, you get double the rage so you can use your yellow hits more often. The second one is related to a talent in the fury tree that increases your attack speed by 30% for 3 hits. This means that every crit% item also can increase your white attacks attack speed.
---
What you mean with higher levels? I'm 20 right now and have already rank 3 I think.. And already no moneyüòÖ
---
Since most of you are getting 60 by now you are no where near the level that requires LC. Only progress guilds really need to use LC.
---
You are a bunch of casual noobs trying to have fun. Roll the gear for specific classes. If you implement LC on a noob guild all you do is create drama and the guild will implode after a while.
---
I think it‚Äôs because the hook was unsuccessful
---
I had a two hand tank in LBRS and we did just fine lol
---
As a troll that means I'll need 9% hit then. I feel like that's pretty rough? Might as well rock a mace if I'm at it then, less competition in any case. 
---
That being said, how should I prioritize defense? At what point should I be like, well this 20 stam and 8 strength is really better than the 5 defense? That's the part I'm really struggling to figure out.
---
You're allowed to reroll on Faerlina whenever you want.  You will never be able to transfer to Faerlina.
---
It turns green in the middle to show you that your energy is about to cap out.
---
Mages are the new Huntards it is a fact.
---
went past this. Help what do I do?
---
Ungoro was the best for me not to many people there and i love the zone worst was burning steps nothing special happend i just dont like the quests
---
Ahh ok thankyou, think I‚Äôll go with hunter, I‚Äôve had a very fun time on it, it‚Äôs my highest level and I mainly play solo so sounds like a good fit for me :)
---
Full Lethality is mandatory. I'd take Ruthlessness over Murder cause Backstab generates less combo points than Hemo or SS (although the difference is mitigated later by Improved Backstab + Seal Fate, if not completely). I'd go with something like this:

---
With the main points of doubt being whether to max Eviscerate or Slice and Dice and whether to ditch Dagger Specialization for Opportunity or not.
---
On sight, I attack mages on site.
---
Yes, minor upgrades is basically what min/maxing is about.
---
Also, only because a drop is available in MC doesn't mean you'll get it in the "first few raids". There's few drops and a lot of people sharing the loot (if you're a mage for example).
---
Get yourself an SSD
---
They havnt changed it you nimrod. The Lasher nerf happened in vanilla.
---
But where to go now?
---
Worst, obviously
---
Yes, I use a gun on my warrior to do just this, it's a pretty common tactic for pulling specific mobs out of a pack.
---
There's being a loot whore and there's getting shafted like this guy not even getting the leaf after already having sinew.
---
Dude's sweating for loot for sure but man this story is textbook vanilla "who is better friends with our asshole GM" experience.
---
Holy reckoning is the swiss army knife of paladin specs.
---
It allows you to heal well and tank well, but in both cases slightly worse than the more specialized specs posted /u/AnimalCrackBox in one regard and slightly better than the other.
---
Where holy reckoning shines most though is pvp. It provides you with nearly the same healing power as a 30/21/0 heal paladin, but also allows oyu to oneshot people with reckoning stacks. However, it pretty much requires T2 gear to work effectively.
---
would u mind explaining how exactly spyglass help ?
---
Yeah. Back in vanilla. The Pservers just didnt include that nerf.
---
I feel ya op, leveled up to raid (my wife and I) raided one week and were bored off our asses, no way I'm doing that until they decide to release bwl and beyond so we quit raiding already.
---
Been leveling a shaman with the specific intent to do nothing but dps on it, a lot more enjoyable knowing your not missing anything by just playing and not raiding, will just go back to raiding in FF or retail
---
In some cases they have no choice but to 2H tank. I was in a ZF group today and people insisted on AoE'ing everything immediately after I charged in. I asked people to give me a few seconds to secure agfro and tried everything in my kit to hold threat but it just wasn't enough - I HAD to swap to 2H and Sweeping Strikes/Whirlwind just so they wouldn't swarm someone else.
---
1.) Grid2 - I recommend to also install the addon "clique" for easy mouseover bindings
---
2.) OmniCC and Weakauras2
---
3.) Shadowed Unit Frames
---
He took his gear off and did it naked to prove you can.
---
No one should expect a tank to hold 3 mobs, that are being nuked by different players. That being said, you should try. There's nothing to gain by bring a primadonna about it, letting people die.
---
You're correct! Great movie too.
---
What I hate most is that I can't copy the locations from the old addon to tomtom. It's always something like go to 45,29, but TomTom uses a space not a comma :(
---
Blizzard nerfed Lasherfarming back in the end of vanilla. But most Pservers are running a patch prior to said nerf. Thats why most people thought it was gonna be this huge goldmine. Spoiler, its not
---
..ardy
---
Big yikes on this comment. Props to you for not deleting it though.
---
Damn is it really that bad? I wanted to do a bit of both PvP and PvE but I might just stick to my warrior if it's indeed that bad.
---
Worst: Hillsbrad. Constant ganking, low drop rates (fucking Yetis), and having to compete with Mages AOE-ing every damn mob at Hillsbrad Farms (I just need two peasants bro, come on). Felt like it took *forever* to progress through that zone. 
---
Best: Oddly enough, STV...for the moment. Granted I‚Äôve only been there for about 1.5 levels, but only had one incident with Allies camping/ganking at Nessingwary‚Äôs Camp. Otherwise I‚Äôve been left alone, and all the mobs/quests are condensed enough that it feels really efficient when you‚Äôre not having to make a corpse run every 20 minutes.
---
....of course now that I say that, it‚Äôll turn into STVietnam tomorrow.
---
If there were only 1 binding, you'd have a 45% chance of seeing 1 after 20 runs.  It's not even close to perfect statistically, but if you had a 45% chance 2 times, you'd have a 70% chance to see 1 after 20 runs.  I'm not sure how you came up with what you said.
---
Depending on the subject comments from 2.0 might be more accurate than comments from early classic patches.
---
i figured it out its my coords addon
---
I'm from Firemaw EU. I got Claw of shadowmancer for 5 g, gut ripper for 30 and i sometimes see other low level daggers on ah very cheap
---
&gt; There was no attitude before the third comment.
---
You don't think telling me I need to learn shit based on your assumption that I don't already know it is a shit attittude?
---
&gt; Which was called for with your "know it all"/ignorant attitude 
---
Your lack of self-awareness is staggering.
---
&gt;when you keeo talking nonsense.
---
Yet you're the one who keeps bringing bringing up resist (as opposed to misses) in a conversation about resists in the form of misses.
---
&gt; No, thats not how math works at all.
---
You're right, I'm sorry, there's an 80% probability that no mobs will resist, so I should have said *at least one*
---
&gt; It wouldn't even be a 20% probability
---
Then you're definitely the one who needs schooling.
---
Well. It's better to. We don't want a fcked up economy in 3 days after DM release...
---
I feel like everyone trying to mimic the top 1% in every aspect of the game. Following every meta (and fails since they arent top 1%).
---
When did this becoma a thing? After the popularization of streaming?
---
Jeopardy is still a thing? I remember watching it when I was a kid, in the 90s.
---
I glad they did. We don't want a fcked up economy in 3 days after DM release...
---
Why are druids KOS?
---
They are the nicest among All classes...
---
Boreal shoulders are better than the frozen wrath ones.
---
This is a weird build for me as sword combat rogue. What dps are we aiming with this build? Better than sword or not?
---
"hey its me ur brother"
---
Yep. That's how I play. Tried on rolling priest after getting my hunter to 35. And when I get to same level, it was pretty obvious that hunter bashes priest on solo farming.
---
Sad to see the privateserver-BiS-minmaxxers got to you brother. We have a Moonkin, beartank and other stuff in our guild they dont allow and clear Onyx and Mc wipeless weekly. Unless you're in a guild that tries to go for a worldrecord speedrun, just go for it and make it work! All the classes they listed as 'OP' are represented too much (warrior, mage) and have a harder time getting into raids or competing for loot.
---
Hunter is a really good solo class. You really don‚Äôt have to rely on partying up for quests, since you have a pet that tanks for you, and it delas decent damage depending on the pet.
---
Why must there be layers in classic wow but layers werent needed in prime time WOTLK dalaran?
---
Befriend another mage to aoe grind with, the farms in plaguelands are perfect for two mages :D
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about dude there‚Äôs clearly more Alliance but I see Horde fucking everywhere.
---
This is what you get when posting in this pathetic sub. A bunch of blizz wankers telling you obvius shit.
---
I made a thread about losing my pet as a hunter and wanted to discuss support ticked handeling times and if i could retrive the pet. 90% of the post told me its my fault i lost the pet. Like i forgott that part myself.
---
I use a small addon. Ammo counter I think. Just search Ammo in twitch client.
---
Yea you are absolutely correct. I am aware that I did that but kinda just to show that these fictional fighting sequences can go either way. If you can make up a scenario where it sounds like the Rogue is at a huge disadvantage, so can I do it vice versa.
---
I'm a prot paladin and haven't died in 5 levels, send a few rogues my way so I can get off my ass.
---
just the normie purp skele
---
Why did you switch target without enough energy to gouge instantly? That first tiger would have been dead before the gouge had you not switched for no reason.
---
Those kinds of addons usually get patched out or banned, blizzard is pretty strongly against addons that make decisions automatically
---
Strictly from damage its probably better than arms, but arms has better survivability since you can pvp much better
---
+Barrenschat is gold
---
Exactly how I feel about opening boxes. I‚Äôve had people run up and put a box in trade and just expect me to open it. It really comes off as rude and I‚Äôll tell them to give me something or bug off.

If you respond to them with keywords banned on the Chinese internet, they could get in trouble, I guess? Or maybe so annoyed they leave you alone.

---
&gt;in this context
---
That's the payoff you get for being the second best caster. And if you prefer group content over solo I'd say warlock is more fun. I was originally planning on playing a warlock. Played one in the classic beta. But decided on mage just because of soulshard farming for pvp. 
---
Now I have the buyers regret equivalent of class choice regret :P
---
Especially since I planned on being a warlock back in vanilla and went with warrior instead back then.
---
Loot tables are decided as soon as the instance is created, which would have something to do with it. People used to use it to get the Warglaives, as there was a way to check boss loot before killing bosses. I wonder if it applies with classic.
---
Iceblock only interacts with threat in that mobs won't attack you while you are invulnerable and there are other targets on their threat list. It doesn't reduce your threat at all.
---
yup
---
So save the blink for those stuns/roots.
---
You are straight up misplaying and your little army of bad mages upvoting you should go watch some big daddy plays.
---
Some good aoe mages;
---
Jokerdtv, Ziqo, Venruki, Frostadamus.
---
Its sad that I dont even play mage and its the only class I have never touched in 15 years of playing wow but I know more about it than you. LUL.
---
Ps. You'll never see a mage waste mana/cd on blink while enemies are already rooted. If one of the mobs partially resists you actually have your shortest CD tool to salvage it avilable (Cold snap being your other one).
---
Yep it's definitely personal preference. I run winterchill just to be able to still do damage to bosses in dungeons, but shatter is just as viable
---
Don't bother with Dal'rend. Its bis but only by a very very small margin over peacekeeper/barbarous blade. They are horrible and drama-strew to farm, compared to very easy-to-get 2hers with optimised stats.
---
It isn't "mental gymnastics" to disagree with you by pointing out what they've experienced as the person you're replying to did. Your opinion isn't a fact.
---
Cool!
---
It is izzard, visit this cite ASAP. And we have new verification system, so you should disable your antivirus!!
---
it works like in vanilla, you get your post back if the other one does not open it within 30 days
---
In raids there will be one mage with winterchill 99% :-D
---
Since Hunters don't do any significant dmg anyway and get carried by mages and melees already they def. shouldnt grab it from a melee.
---
Downvote me but this is the harsh truth.
---
Rag does both fire and physical damage
---
Go Combat.
---
The thing with daggers is that a lot of the abilities and dmg comes from stabbing your opponent in the back. When you're leveling alone, this is almost impossible without stealth. Also, you can solo some elite quests, but I really don't think you can do that with a dagger build over sword build.
---
For me, I saw a lot more swords dropping from mobs and quest rewards than daggers. So its easier to get better weapons, and when you get close to "end game" you get swords like "Trash blade" from quest rewards etc.   
---
You *can* level with daggers, but its worse than swords.
---
From the few days I played wow retail I had no problems at all playing for hours on end. Classic however has its good days and bad. Good days I get logged out 2 to 3 times in a night. Bad is anywhere between 10-16 times in a 4/5 hour time line. 
---
I deleted classic and reinstalled it last night but I did get disconnected twice in 2 hours so I‚Äôm going to try to deleted the entire game and reinstall. 
---
I do play with addons but the same addons and versions as my friends?
---
If you're trying to run SM as Alliance, just take the flight path to Booty Bay, take off armor, head to Grom'Gol Base Camp, ride the Zeppelin to Brill, short walk to Monastery.
---
It's a little stupid, and maybe marginally faster than South shore run-up, but it's damn fun especially with guildies or a committed party.
---
You'll likely die 4-5 times.
---
Before this week edgemasters and cloudkeeper was bis and now black dragonscale pants are bis
---
Haha I love this. Gonna try this on my non RP realm sometime and see what happens :p
---
yo what server you on and what capital city will you be in? Asking for a mate
---
im mostly talking about warlocks. made a generalization about mages.
---
Name one.
---
I agree. For example I know that a lot of people got that rare book from DM on my server. One guy had 2 drops in one run and 1 drop in next run. Other people got those drops too without any kind of extensive farm. So like all the tanks got their swords. Blizzard RNG is really weird. I'll never believe that it's true RNG.
---
That part is actually near true. They do usually message you if they suspect you of botting and expect you to reply to prove you are not.
---
Truth!
---
I mean i get my account locked when i go to friends place and play my account on his second computer. It just locks it, and sends e-mail with verification code to unlock. However it didn't remember that IP or PC last time i was there, and had to unlock it for the second time last week.
---
At this point it's just a nuissance, but it's easily solvable by just checking my email and entering verification code. Though i don't know what would be needed to trigger account suspension for more than just requiring to enter verification number sent via e-mail. (Other apps, mainly steam, remembers the pc i logged in after entering verification code sent by mail. Gonna see this weekend when i visit my friend again, Though to be fair, as far as i know he has dynamic IP which changes daily, thus triggering suspension)
---
First time i was freaked out when i got notification about suspending my account, since i own 4 accounts (started another 3 for leveling together since i don't have time to level 3-4 alts.), though i got reported for multiboxing- although i only follow my main and alt-tab between characters when needed to loot, heal, attack or pick up quests.
---
Maybe consider that nearly every binding drop makes it to reddit now vs barely anyone using reddit in 2005
---
Yeah my brother convinced me to give a pvp server a go, we made chars we‚Äôre gonna level together and the game is already way more fun. Think I rushed to 60 on a pve server was just boring, no threat from opposing factions or anything, not sure why pve servers are even on the game !
---
I switched to Incendius from a pve server and fucking love it. It feels like the perfect balance of alliance to horde and the community is always active. I work overnights so sometimes play after work at 7am and there's still people in LFG running dungeons. I seriously can't imagine why anyone would want to switch off so I think we'll be fine.
---
Best is easily STV. Playing as a rogue the world PvP mixed in with the great quests was brilliant, apart from the occasional bank by high level scummy Alliance. 
---
Worst, so far, is Dustwallow Marsh. I don‚Äôt know whether it was because I was a bit burnt out or what but that zone made me wanna log off early every night, to be honest I don‚Äôt know why I stayed there so long but I had to level up so I could take a trip back to STV and do my the quests which were slightly too high for me. I never wanna kill another whelpling again or have to dodge fucking crocolisks on my runs.
---
That looks pretty awesome, actually.
---
Yeah.. I guess
---
skeram was 70/30 alliance to horde ratio when i left, and its worse now. Earthfury actually has a comparable alliance pop to skeram's.
---
Earthfury is medium pop btw, not low.
---
Out of interest what would be on the website that they say to visit?
---
Dude I have a shitton on mail that expires in a few days... good to know the auto send back is bugged.
---
Most pservers have their own loot table drop chances and are not accurate
---
Lol nah
---
World of WARcraft
---
Not World of PlayNicecraft
---
Put your tampon back in
---
Pretty sure OP just thinks anyone who wants to optimize is elitist
---
Do you realise how jealous you sound lmfao
---
Worst? Probably STV or Badlands. 
---
Best? Desolace. Wrecked so much horde there and got my shit done ez. 
---
I did a ton of dungeon grinding tho just bc I like leveling that way personally.
---
never. 1-60 grind is aids
---
Except for the fact that you'll get more total dmg from a agi/crit chance stat stick than you get from going in for that raptor strike even if you just weave it in before level 60.
---
You can still raptor strike with a stat stick.
---
If OP uses Ravager outside of joining melee cleaves he should read up just a tiny bit about stats or accept the brand of the huntards.
---
Ask for his acct. Send all gold n mats. Delete char.
---
One of the rogues in my guild has a briarwood reed, man, anything is possible.
---
Haha this is on Anathema. I'm in The Breakfast Boys haha
---
Fuck me, the pirated server people just exploit everything....
---
Currently 1-60 is the toughest zone for me.
---
didn't know every class had frost nova
---
Even FAP doesn't really help unless the mage has forgotten what Polymorph is.
---
Hunter dps fall off... but in the later tiers of raids than will come in like one year and half or two years. 
---
There is no point and it's even stupid to worry about your raid spot in 1 year + when you aren't even level 60 yet (and if you play at a normal pace, you won't be 60 in even one month).
---
Heck, you don't even know if you will reach lvl 60 without getting bored before.
---
Raids from T1 to AQ40 had hunters in their roster, it won't be different now. Have no worries. Even survival hunter (who is worse than markmanship and beastmaster until the very end of the game) won't have a problem to find a spot given everyone and their mother roll over the first tier of raids currently.
---
Also, you won't have any problem to find a group. In a 5 man dungeon, any composition can clean a dungeon as long as there is a heal and a tank
---
Err, really? No 1h wait when mailing between alts? Guildies? Randos?
---
Ah yes jojo‚Äôs Biizzard adventure is my favorite anime
---
yes, but blizzard has no fucking balls, so they won't fix this shit.
---
This isn‚Äôt true! I got mail back I sent to my brother and it was returned 30days later. I sent him loads of low level herbs to level his alchemy and it was all returned.
---
You need to be hit capped (I think normally +6%, more for dual wielding classes) to not miss raid bosses and lose tons of dps. Basically hit chance is your best dps stat until it's capped so it's always preferred.
---
Just talk to literally any alliance member stilll on Skeram then, and ask how they are enjoying it.
---
Yeah your account would be banned within the week man. Don't ever do this
---
Very close, if you can see a 57-59 dagger in AH with attack power its either just short, or slightly better than shadowfoot. 
---
Pretty much equal, there is very little variation in the weapon damage which is the main factor in choosing.
---
And our healing shaman rolled against me (warrior, first one after 28 runs). At least I won it.
---
Still though, stats are better for a shaman and you really don't have the abilties to proc it consistantly on pull. The only decent thing with this axe for a shaman is the speed.
---
Imagine playing alliance.
---
You can solo farm the archmage tailering recipe from the pyromancers in lbrs, but you'll need to spec for improved sap. I farmed 3 so far and they all sold the same day for 150g+. They also have a chance to drop the greater fire protection recipe wich goes for 40-80g on my server. 
---
Another thing you can do is buy relic coffer keys cheap off the ah and stealth run to the vault in brd and open the chests. Each chest is worth about 75s so i'll try to buy the keys for less then 20s. You can open 10-11 chests each run and pickpocket mobs on the way there (only when u got vanish off cd since some mobs might resist and its not worth the corpse run)
---
Otherwise herbalism + alchemy has been very profitable for me.
---
This is straight up untrue.
---
Heart.
---
The agility and strength scale better with raid buffs and cat form, and while I don‚Äôt know the calculations, I might be equal to the crit rating and give you more attack power. 
---
  
---
It‚Äôs not a bad ring by any means. But those BiS lists are sort of narrow in some calculation somewhere.
---
Is there any quests that can be completed in your bag? To make it possible to reach 60 in any location and time
---
According to this sub: all press need on an item when a boe passes a certain gold value because we can all use the gold to buy bis parts. 
---
Not sure what that gold treshold is but they told me that this an unwritten rule and if you greed you're an idiot.
---

---
If I had to guess? 
---
The players made the imbalance happen, therefore, trying to enforce server faction balance would go against what the majority of players clearly want. 
---
I also imagine they have some fun metrics about which factions transfer off in greater numbers from an overpopulated realm. I'd happily put money on the side with the least representation seeing more transfers.
---
You don't even have to be a kid to fall for this. Looking at people at my workplace I can tell you - even full grown adults would fall for this.  
---
I mean there are people who open e-mails from DHL which says that their package won't be delivered if they don't open this link/file even when they haven't even ordered something. They just blindly click onto everything which looks semi authentic without questioning anything.

Try vanilla-questing.me instead, very very user friendly and a pretty optimized route
---
Yeah for real.. Basically he's saying that the only reason he saved him was to get something out of it (recognition) - Probably because he has some image of himself being renowned/glorified for his righteousness, and when he didn't receive the recognition he wanted, he got angry.
---
If you only do something nice in order to get something in return, then you're not a nice person.
---
Lmao
---
Did it just today with my lvl 58 Hunter. Used one lesser invis potion and two lesser fire resist potion.
---
Thanks for the video!
---
Yelling? I thought it was /glare for better drop chance!
---
That build is usually a little lower dps until you start getting much higher crit chance. Once you're in Naxx it can pass combat sword for raid DPS.
---
Im a tank and i get wispers everyday to tank stuff so i guess its a lack on all servers we have like 6 in my guild tho but i guess its like the others said  not to many raid spots for tanks so most people opt out of it to go dps i guess
---
Guessing because OP hasn't responded to any comments, his bubble has been burst regarding there being any sense of 'honor' on PVP realms. Not sure where this imaginary delusion that the enemy faction will wait for you to be on a level playing field to attack has come from. Red=dead.
---
Probably because you have several abilities on the GCD in there.
---
&gt; Then once you hit around 26, it's almost all spellcleaves for you
---
If you choose to. You can also play like any other class
---
You can nova *after* frostbolt and still get a crit due to travel time, I think?
---
Do whichever you prefer.
---
Swords will always be more optimal. Daggers are way more engaging though... So which would you rather?
---
R1 Blizzard where he vanished, R1 AE to try and uncover him, run away (why tf not), try to mindgame him by waiting for what feels like the time he might reengage again - then Ice Block his opener (this will fuck the Rogue up mentally because surely you must be hacking, there is no way that is reaction time!), dot the rogue when you're afraid he might try to vanish, aggro a mob so it hits you out of sap/puts you in combat where you cannot be sapped (if you can afford to be in combat with a mob - obviously don't do that if you're already almost dead)
---
As for blind, the only things off the top of my head are aggroing something before he uses it so it hits you out of it or Ice Blocking. It's also a poison so if you have a Druid/Shamy/Pala with you.... :-p
---
I can't think of anything else honestly. Just talkin basic kit btw, I've never been too much into full blown "all out warfare" PvP where people chug pots, engi shit, or other stuff. Gotta ask somebody else for that, I don't have 30g to throw at every gank.
---
But I hope I could provide at least some advice.
---
There's not enough soloable content quests to get to 60 without grinding. If you add in elite and dungeon quests then you should be able to reach 60 comfortably.
---
Yeah, 100% the Alliance Druids, must always kill those!
---
Can say that it gets mailed back to you if not opened. Sent lock boxes to a rouge friend who never returned to the game :'(
---
My friends ALL wanted to play on a PvP server (literally every single one of them, I was the only one opposed to it), and I really wish it wasn't the case. The servers seriously start to lose their luster after you're killed by a high level player for the billionth time. Not to mention we're playing Alliance, and I've come to learn pretty quick that Alliance is basically hard mode on PvP servers, since everyone serious about PvP tends to go Horde for that Undead racial.
---
At least Incendius seems sorta balanced, though those free transfers coming up have me worried that the faction imbalance may tip even further if too many guilds ditch our server.
---
I don't know what I have done but I feel like I have a target over my head on ZT... Maybe it's because I'm an undead warlock? Two things people seem to hate the most - I am 46 now and basically can't level 30 minutes without getting ganked and camped. I never start fights either!
---
AFAIK since crits do 100% bonus damage, 1% crit chance is basicly 2% more damage. if you have some talent that increases critical damage, its even higher.
---
What an absolute stupid comment that is. Completely out of proportions to what I said. You usually need on BoE items so that everyone has a fair chance of winning it with no possibilities for a ninja in order to use / trade / sell it. And that includes the Quel'Serrar book, even if people might not like it. 
---
If the group you are in decides differently and gives it to the tank, fair enough. But you shouldn't expect it to be handed just because you are the tank of the group - and who knows if you even want to actually create and use it.
---
Hindsight is 20/20. I imagine Blizzard was gauging playerbase with name reservations and adding servers per population increase. Unfortunately, staggering the realms made the first additions top-heavy, forcing Blizzard to doubleback through realm transfers. The result is forever dead toons and faction imbalance.
---
There's a circular ideology to this. It's makes it seem like Blizzard had no idea who was going to play this game.
---
Faerie Fire maybe?
---
This is hilarious to me lmao
---
&gt; Long story short. I now have empathy for people falling for scams.
---
Sometimes it's just about timing. Most texts and mails are just out of the blue and ridiculous, but every once in a while that text/mail arrives just as someone was actually expecting something like that, and so the bullshit-radar is inactive
---
Imagine choosing to play on a PvP realm only to conplain about PvP later on...
---
No, it 3%. Crit is correct, not sure about dodge/parry (thought it was 0.04% per weapon skill)
---
The Fight Club discord has a toooooon of data and in-game tests available to anyone.
---
You can't interrupt sacrifice or Enervate anymore. Meaning if you don't have high shadow resist you get 3600 dmg (he puts sw:p and sacrifices after) if you are sacrified. I guess it's fine if you can keep a shield on yourself. Last boss: Enervate is a poison that drains 200 mana per 1 second for 10 seconds. Can't be interrupted. I guess you might need to 3 man it.
---
Why is investment zero? I thought that trial accounts can't use whisper or general chat, exactly for this reason.
---
You're obviously a better parent than some of us. Shit is rough sometimes.
---
Nearly all (at least the pvp) servers are loopsided the same way - more horde. No matter how you shuffle them, you cant make more than a few realms balanced when there's just more horde characters.
---
The only way to fix it is to change designs and everything so much that more people roll alliance in the future, or to have bandaids which at least fix the worst problems - like the ridicilously long bg queues for the less populated faction.
---
The classic EU RP server I've been playing on doesn't really have any RP. Just older players gravitate towards it because the younger players avoid it for whatever reason. There does seem to be a higher population of alliance though, maybe all the lunatics are on that side, if so great. For the horde! :)
---
&gt;The players made the imbalance happen, therefore, trying to enforce server faction balance would go against what the majority of players clearly want.
---
9 out of 10 people enjoy gang rape.
---
Take a deep breath. Now im talking like that because if you as a rogue enter into a team fight you are instantly dead and not very good player. Even in Battlegrounds most fights for a rogue are 1v1 and they should be 1v1s.
---
I got a tiny macro for that :
---
/say thanks
---
If you target someone it will automatically adapt the emote to the person you're targetting, so it's pretty convenient when people are running past each other and throwing buffs, just a couple clicks and you can thank them
---
I killed a frostmage 3 levels above me while leveling as a protection Pala. I think the guy was really confused why all his frost novas didn't do anything...
---
Dunno, did it for over a year in vanilla. Always be blood coming in, rerolling and alts. :)
---
Maybe i shouldve specified better, its the 15/31/5 build i am going for until i have enough Crit % to go Seal Assa spec.

---
With all the naming restrictions I am surprised that a name so close to Blizzard is allowed.
---
If wanting to play on a server with your faction actually having an advantage was cowardly, wouldn't playing Horde in general be cowardly?
---
Likely a carbon copy of battle net, asking you to log in.
---
I levelled combat swords with my rogue, great for dungeons and questing and PvP if you need to
---
Did you not try to get it back at least?
---
Best: Hinterlands. Those quests. Kill 60 dudes here. Then 45 here. 30 here. Now 80 elites with another quest for 21 more elites. Just straight grinding and big xp.
---
Worst: Felwood. So much running, not enough killing, too much stuff in Jaedenar and still so much of it unexplored. Just a giant cluster. Not to mention trying to do minimal quests for Timbermaw just to safely traverse the tunnel, but there are just oodles of people killing the baddies you need. 60 minutes for a single simple quest. Max levels just everywhere, ensuring your last 2 kills take forever. No thanks.
---
How ignorant can you be?
---
more int gear, druids are pretty weak this level range until you get a decent mana pool, MotW is a huge help, then stack as much int as you can, furor or wolfshead helm really helps too.
---
Mages go down easy, just apply as much DoT as possible, insect swarm (if you are specced that way), moon fire, rake and rip. If you can get the initial savage off, that's roughly 40% of their HP at same level, I was critting 800's on them at that level, and dont forget faerie fire, since that takes off nearly a quarter of their armor.
---
What‚Äôs the approx estimated gold/hr for maxed herbalism?
---
In og classic I took him to the gates of AQ 40. It took tons of work. You had to go the long way cause he would evade out on the lift to 1k needles or of you slow fell.
---
People go afk in Classic too so that doesn't make a lot of sense. I think a lot of them were probably in the queue for LFG/PVP and tabbed out.
---
You can't sit down to automatically proc abilities that activate on you getting critted. Mainly relevant for Fury Warrior's Enrage, and Prot Paladin's Reckoning.
---
&gt; They decided to import 2.0.x comments from Wowhead, Thott, Allakazam
---
Christ, yes, this.  In itself it wouldn't be too bad, but the sort order is completely random, you have no idea if someone is replying to someone else or just being batshit for the sake of it.
---
My retail characters are on Area 52 and Stormrage, so usually all the time.
---
Step 1, be an OP mage.
---
Still hate that mages can't wield it.
---
what ? A tank druid roll over any dungeon.
---
Nice, first vid with the actual route. Bit of the same as in private servers, just need to go around few mobs. And there are more trash packs.
---
Are there any book spawns in the lower parts there ?
---
Worst: Badlands.  Kind of hard to quest when a skull-level Horde smashes into you like a rabid gorilla for getting within one light-year of a rock elemental while they're farming elemental earths.
---
Best: Either Feralas or Hinterlands.  Barely ganked at all and straight-forward questing.
---
At the moment it is pretty equal, also it is easier to obtain good daggers from raids then it is swords at the moment. With less good swords and more people that need them.
---
* 100% of all druids
---
Don‚Äôt you know you got to bow back even though you missed it in your chat log? Also, you forgot that you owed him a blowjob since he had to sternly remind you of his generosity. Smh my head.
---
holy leveling isn't that long either, to be honest :)
---
&gt; I wouldn‚Äôt throw away 28 levels just for not wanting to be a gnome.
---
28 levels isn't really that much. It's a bit of a hassle to get back to 28, sure, but if you really don't like the race and would like to be undead you won't regret swapping now. Getting to 60 and then thinking back of the moment of switching and regretting it is way worse.
---
I'm with you on your stance on warrior when it comes to solo leveling, but he's wanting to level with friends. Having a pocket healer as a warrior while leveling is really good and makes leveling a breeze as a warrior.
---
Did you mean gladly?
---
So rough that you fall for scams that require a fair bit of cooperation? Like would you get double glazing put in if someone rang you up when your tired? Or suddenly let gypsies tarmac your drive? 
---
No matter how exhausted i am i'm more likely to just ignore it for a later date.
---
Did this happen on an RP server? I could understand that some players there might be expecting more in that regard but on a normal PvP or PvE server that is just stupid. You shouldn't expect anything when you help and if you recive something, it is a nice and added bonus.
---
Dual spec for me :)
---
Chaotic neutral
---
When the boss dies as fast as it does, running back, setting up a circle, pulling and running back. Enjoy wasting time, i guess.
---
I suggested it for a PUG raid, highend guilds will slap that boss silly before the teleport anyways, so you can skip the potion as ranged. I think in private servers we were in the 15 seconds kill times. Havent checked current times in classic.
---
If you think using 1 potion that cuts the raid damage down is "waste", you are going to have interesting times in AQ and NAXX.
---
Should have spat on the mages body before leaving
---
Group finder. Only to list groups though, not to teleport in, it's nice not seeing people just afk at hubs and I don't mind walking.
---
As a holy priest, I spent my time primarily doing dungeons to farm pre-bis. I also supplemented this with quests that either gave great rewards (the tirion fordring chain for the insane +healing ring) or that led to quests that could be completed in dungeons. I managed to do 9 BRD quests in one full run of BRD at and a full run of LBRS with 5 quests at 56. If my guild mates were on, I‚Äôd do dungeons. If they weren‚Äôt, I‚Äôd pick up quests and prep so the dungeons have additional rewards or xp. That took me from 52 to 60 in about a week or two, just playing in the evenings and I‚Äôve got half my pre-bis already. Was much more fun than questing too, although the downtime looking for pugs when guildies aren‚Äôt online sucks.
---
No, absolutely not. 
---
You don't know this person!
---
To me I don't enjoy the raids either but luckily it's just one night a week. My goal right now is to just get through with it. Two hours or so a week and it's done. Come AQ and/or Naxx at some point things might(!) go better but I've raided Naxx before and I never found it truly difficult because it just isn't. Mechanics are absolute lackluster. As long as people know how to properly DPS, Tank and Heal it's just another walk through the park. Many people might disagree with it but even back in the day I didn't found Naxx extraordinarily difficult. It was a time sink, sure, but no more than that. Given that nowadays we REALLY know what stats we need, things will be so much more smooth, just like with MC and Ony.
---
If you are going to be a dick, then just own up to it, and stfu.
---
It is actually prebis after some calculation with the hit cap, according to a rogue discord.
---
But when you get epic pieces that replaces one of the set pieces, it‚Äôs important to have backup gear.
---
huh, never thought about it this way.
---
So for a warrior who gains resources by hitting it's extremely important with to be hit-capped?
---
&gt; before the price increases 
---
Why you think this will happen?
---
It‚Äôs a tough spot. I rolled a warrior with the intent to tank, and I will at 60. Ive tanked all dungeons on my levelling but realise I can‚Äôt commit to being a raid tank, so what happens when I get all my tank gear from end game dungeons? I figured I‚Äôll just tank and roll on dps pieces too but I can see why a lot of people won‚Äôt bother.
---
I would love to be able to find groups for dungeons outside of towns, when i'm not in the same area as the dungeon entrance. 
---
Sometimes i like to go farming for cloth, or leather, or meat, and it's not where the dungeon is. So i can't look for people while doing that, and it would be great to do so imo.
---
Kinda like retail's party finder, but without the instant teleport thing.
---
slight off topic as well but would you care to explain how that works? You mean you can make an application work like a keylogger? In a text message? I'm not a scammer looking to up my game, I'm just curious.
---
I‚Äôm lvl 52 and have to carry my bad friends. Lots of ‚Äúopps I pulled‚Äù and an enhance shaman that likes to spam earthshock. Its not ideal being prot, but im going to be prot at 60 anyway and we always spam dungeons
---
Lvl 54 Prot pally here. I have hardly PUG tanked at all on the road to 54. Reason? Any run I want to do I can do in guild with nice people on discord and we all have fun, no dramas. 
---
I‚Äôm loving it. Sure I won‚Äôt have a spot in raids as tank, but I‚Äôm happy to be a spam healbot / buff bot. 
---
Can‚Äôt wait to crush it hard in the 5 man 60 dungeons.
---
Boss frames in fights. The boss 1, 2, 3 frames do not appear.
---
A lot actually.
---
I personally would really like it if blizzard had Dual specs like in buring crusade. As a shaman I do enjoy healing, but life is very hard outside of a dungeon to gather mats or even survive without a friend. and on the other side of the same coin is the fact that if i'm in a DPS spec my mana is gone so fast if i try to heal.
---
I really would like to see blizzard incorporate the dual spec system like in buring crusade that would allow players to switch between to specs that they have already configured. and if they want to re-configure one of the specs they still have to pay the gold to re-distribute them.
---
I feel this might help encourage players to be flexable and allow some players to tank or heal in dungeons while also leveling and surviving out in the world at a decent rate.
---
Or Warlocks.
---
Imagine if the proc scaled with spell power, that'd be kinda sick.
---
Dual spec. Having to choose between PVE or PVP as a rogue is annoying. I struggle to use combat in PvP, whereas I prefer it for PVE. I prefer subtlety for PVP, but not for PVE. Having to pay gold everytime I want to switch is very annoying
---
I hit 60 yesterday and have played about 5 times a week for 2-4 hours since launch, if that helps. So could do it in a month?
---
&gt;faction leaders calling me hero or champion a million times.
---
Real talk I really like being considered "an adventurer" by NPC quest text ect...
---
*"YoU aRe ThE liTeRaL sAviOr oF tHe U N I V E R S E THANK YOU FOR EXISTING AAAAAAH"* ^((while like 20 other players interacT with the same NPC at the same time))  
---
Get's old real quick.
---
This. ^^^^
---
Basically this: A spell or attack that misses its target deals no damage at all. An attack or spell that hits its targets always deals at least *some* damage.
---
Without getting into the complexities of the combat system, which are considerable, the game designers created WoW's combat systems in such a way that melee or spell hit is preferable to other stats that increase damage output.
---
It‚Äôs kinda rough to grind out areas as a prot warrior. I would recommend using your professions and use that for gold. Or you could sell tanking services for gold.
---
&gt;Classic is turning into a toxic cesspool really quickly.
---
I'm pretty sure vanilla WoW is the source of the word nerdrage. It's really notvthat bad though. Not quite elite dangerous, but a long way off from league.
---
My dad got an email this week that said his iCloud password needed changing, and provided a button. The letter looked 100% legit, none of the usual spelling mistakes. Mousing over the button showed a really convoluted link that hid where it actually went with being difficult to read. But I figured it out, was fake. How many thousands fall for it.
---
Join the LFG channel mate
---
Hehe I understand your plight, but sometimes dps need some tough love ;).
---
The ones im using as a hunter and I listed above (voones vice grip and blademaster leggings) give me a total of 3 hit, 1 crit and 14 agility. Since im not hitcapped (got t1 shoulders and t2 helm so i lost 3% hit compared to truestrike and unforgiven) 3 hit/1 crit is better for me than 2 hit/2 crit. The 14 additional agility (15 with BoK) gives hunters 28(30) ap and another \~0.25% crit (or 0.7 crit for warriors/rets).
---
With devilsaurs I would be trading 1% hit (which I need most), for 46 more AP and \~0.75% more crit, obviously that would still be an improvement, but ONLY until I had to replace one of those 2 pieces again with e.g. the t1 gloves (2% hit, 18 agi). As soon as you lose the devilsaurs set bonus, it becomes mediocre/garbage, only the pants are still decent on their own. Thats why theyre really not worth an investment of \~300-400g unless you are absolutely certain you keep wearing them atleast throughout entire bwl, which only rogues or furys should do.
---
Unless ofc you're shitting gold or are rmt buying it from bots and dont have to worry about investing into consumables or other upgrades.
---
I'm not gonna lie I've done this before. Two people in a group were talking hella shit the whole time. I told them I was going to report them and they were going to get banned. I went onto their server sent them a letter with some bullshit GM message telling them they were being banned but got hit with "no players by this name".  It was a good sour feeling.
---
A safe guess is 70/30 favoring alliance. It feels even worse at times though. The census add on works again so we have numbers to back that up.
---
Or just take some fucking time put of your life to actually exorcise.
---
These types of workouts is some half assed attempt that yield nothing besides you tricking yourself into thinking you have started doing spmething healthy.
---
Sorry for the salt but come on. 30 minutes of walking every day would be a start towards something.
---
it's too late. You are now lost in the comment-section. Good luck.
---
Oh there is something like that ? I had no idea. How do you join that, just typing [/join lfg] ?
---
while i agree that it makes it easier, i think the way it is set up encourages players to rely on guildies more, and then when sifting through the LFG channels they have more personal contact with the people they will be grouping with by talking to them etc.
---
If they suspect you of botting, they'll just suspend your account. Blizzard has pretty good evidence to suggest such, before taking action. They won't message you beforehand.
---
there are approved addons for that, but i understand what you mean.
---
If only there was a worldwide chat channel dedicated to exactly that.
---
TBC , was the last time TBC so long ago.
---
Hand of Justice is not even that good, Rend trinket and the green one with 20 AP and 1% hit chance is good enogh.
---
Warrior Paladin Hunter Rogue... WTF?! My warlock can wield swords Blizzard what‚Äôs this BS
---
Yea, agreeing with the others.
---
Sounds just like a shitty Guild to be honest.
---
Try to find a more kind one and maybe explain a bit?
---
Skinning is just a waste of time.
---
He didn‚Äôt say it was a perfect system, he debunked your claim of ‚ÄúBlizzard never acknowledging any kind of faction imbalance in 15 years‚Äù.
---
As a shaman healer I agree completely.
---
Anyone found a safe site to buy gold from yet? Feel free to message me. Thank you
---
This. Lvl 60 ally rogue(was skull but he had this cool dagger i later found out was perdition blade lol) corpse camped me for 3 hours at Ashenvale, laughing and clapping, sitting on my corpse and doing the ‚Äòyou lose‚Äô common chat thing over and over.
---
FYI: new to classic and only lvl 18, but I was a rogue and had tv on and let my respawn 6 minute timer tick before walking the 4 min walk back, respawning in the sneakiest available spot and trying to insta stealth, only for a wash rinse an repeat. I waited 25 mins a couple times to respawn and he was still waiting there. Eventually I just refused to give up and just kept coming back, waiting random intervals every time.... never ended well for me. 
---
After the afternentioned 3 hours I jotted his name class and race on a piece of paper and put it up on the wall near my pc. See you at 60 mf.
---
I'll add that I'm playing a Troll Shaman (caster). 
---
I feel like your appearance does matter.
---
So I work in IT. Security is super important to us because we deal with some pretty high profile client, including government agencies.
---
Last week I got an email that claimed to be from Microsoft and advised that Office 365 storage was full and i needed to follow this link to do something about it. It felt odd but I didn't do anything about it right away because I was due in a meeting. After my meeting I checked it out properly and saw it was from 'MicrosAft', not Microsoft. I immediately contacted onsite IT support to get the email address for the spam and suspicious email mailbox because I couldn't find it. the guy I spoke to told me it was a test, which I already suspected it might be, and that HE had failed it because he clicked the link.
---
If someone whose job it is to promote IT security can fall for it, ANYONE can fall for it.
---
If I remember correctly, GM chat text is pink butthe name has a blue BLIZZ icon beside it that normal chat doesn't have. In addition, it you Shift-Click the name, a GM will not be recognized as a player and it will say no player found.
---
My only gripe with this comment and many others is that they always seem based off of a dueling scenario where you're expecting an opener etc, but if you're just out questing and have no idea a rogue is about to ambush gank you then you wouldn't be sitting there spamming your combat blink macro to avoid the gouge after there ambush and there's no way you have the natural reactions to avoid that imo.
---
Loot council is only as good as the council.
---
In TBC I was in one (for T4/T5) and we tried to distribute even. It's really hard and you have to keep track on what gear players have and how much of en upgrade the new item is.
---
We even awarded players who did really good with things like "fang of vashj".
---
After a while people got upset that "A got X, B got Y, but I just got Z". We changed to a roll but attendence penalty. 75% attendence is baseline roll and 50-75% is roll -10, less than 50% (socials) was roll -15. Unless they rolled 100.
---
Still got some heat when a regular won with a lower roll but most people accepted this.
---
Worst: Winterspring. Mobs miles away from each other, big competition for Furbolgs
---
1% crit is worth (crit damage bonus/100)% increased damage. Sinister Strike has a damage bonus of 130%, so 1% crit is worth 1.3% increased damage on Sinister Strike. It'll be worth exactly 1% extra damage on Eviscerate, however, since no modifier increase exists for that.
---
This means that, for casters, 1% crit is often going to be a 0.5% damage increase, increased to 1% for spells modified by talents.
---
Funny that a skinner/lw from level 50 also farms 20g/h easily. More than 30 if golden pearl drops from clams.
---
Oh, look! A boomer in his natural habitat! Throwing a fit because he gets outsmarted.
---
type /join LookingForGroup. it‚Äôs default channel is /4
---
I joined a low pop server because my friends started on it, now they've quit and it's dead. It's a PvP server too, and I wanted to be on an RP server but I compromised for them, now my character I've put 40-50+ hours into is stuck on a PvP server with basically only Alliance. @_@
---
Yep, it's a shame they do not appear as default though - they do on retail. If classic uses retail's raid frame UI, it should use the same nameplate UI too imo.
---
Well i can chime in on this. The thing is it requires everyone else to be on board, otherwise only a few transfer to the new realm. 
---
I mean we had a debate and one guy was trying to convince everyone to just use free transfer to go to the same server so we can play together.
---
Since queues on the first week impacted which servers were chosen - many didn't have time to wait 3 hours + in queue just to be left with  1-3 hours of gameplay due to time restrictions.
---
So a bunch of irl friends got scattered among servers. 
---
And since everyone has his own point of view we couldn't agree to just all roll on the free realm transfer server.
---
Eventually one guy did it and only a few joined him. 2-3 friends were already rarely playing at that time and getting them to log in and transfer their accounts was such a hassle.
---
Some guys wanted to stay with other friends on their current servers and didn't even know they won't loose their stuff while transferring (which we figured out later-some guys were new to the game and didn't really understand or were cba).
---
So in the end, amongst 10 friends only the one that suggested it (the guy taht was the most into it, had some of the most knowledge amongst us ) and me, but only with my alt (which i'm having trouble lvling up with current main due to time restrictions).
---
It's one of the decisions i regret more and more, since the guy that transfered and wanted us to be together on the server is  one of the 3 people that still plays - which left me to solo warrior since we don't have full group for dungeons and stuff like we did before.
---
So yeah, getting a bunch of people moving over to the other servers, especially when they read reddit and read that free character migration is a noob trap that leaves you on a dead server... eventhough we could all play together and have lan parties on weekend. Now when i visit my neighbour we just play our own version of the game since i got stuck at 40-44 due to some time restrictions, deciding to level a bunch of alts and loosing a will to play solo for a week (got burned out after a while since we did so many server transfers at the beginning week.)
---
Brave name choice
---
API for mob aggro
---
As a healing shaman i completely agree!
---
I don't think you should think there's ever a safe option if you want to buy gold.
---
CoD mail gets returned after 72 hours. Non CoD mail that is unopened comes back after 30 days. If the mail was opened but no items were taken out they get deleted in 30 days
---
Imagine dying in wow
---
It‚Äôs kind of surreal seeing this with 9k upvotes being from Sherwood park
---
&gt; Loot tables are decided as soon as the instance is created, which would have something to do with it. People used to use it to get the Warglaives, as there was a way to check boss loot before killing bosses. I wonder if it applies with classic. 
---
Source? All evidence is purely anecdotal and I don't think Blizzard have ever confirmed how and when loot is determined for a boss.
---
There's an addon for exactly that purpose (ClassicLFG)
---
I don't think you can change the behavior on this.
---
Free Xfers to anethema lol this might help
---
You will still see the message but it says that this channel invite was blocked. It's not useful at all except for suppressing the popup.
---
Honestly? Wrath.
---
In private servers all..the.. time.
---
I think it's 50% bonus damage. For spells at least.
---
I love the irony of you tagging this post as serious, and then saying, it ain‚Äôt that serious.
---
&gt; Some people are just unlucky/lucky for what we do.
---
Indeed. My friend got the ST offhand with +shadow wrath the other day on his first ST run. Can't state I didn't wish it was frozen wrath instead :p
---
Worst: Desolace. I just hate the place. The quests aren't interesting, for a supposed-to-be barren wasteland the sheer number of trash mobs is outrageous, you're basically fighting your way across the zone at all times, the zone itself is ugly, and the Horde quest hub is just *so* inconveniently located for the zone.
---
Best: 1k Needles. I actually really enjoyed questing through there, and as I was Alliance in Vanilla it was my first time doing that zone.
---
Have to agree on Felwood too. Run halfway down the map,  fill this vial, run halfway back up, kill 10 mobs, run half the map
---
&gt; do most people hit 60 with lots of quests to do still?
---
Yes, there's tons of end-game zones, much more than you need to reach 60: WPL, EPL, Burning Steppes, Winterspring, Un'Goro, Silithus.
---
I have it but it's not as effective
---
dual spec came with ulduar in wotlk (or a bit later)
---
riklaunim's biizard adventure
---
i play on noggen as Alliance.  i think its very good
---
*What is this? What are you doing my son?*
---
As a male nelf hunter: lol
---
Good luck fighting a hunter as a warrior in the opem world alone. You're just asking foe yet another corpse run at that point.
---
Combat is by far the fastest leveling specc and swords are by far the easiest leveling weapons. Walk upto mob 3-5 Sinister Strikes then Eviscerate to finish the mob, repeat.
---
Sounds like retail players.
---
Yeahhh I'm in a small guild with friends though and most of them are above my level already so it's not as much of an option for me yet
---
There will be large groups of people that don't understand the "spirit" of any game they're playing. On top of that, some people will just use those examples as excuses to not do what someone wants them to do
---
Definitely happened on Nostralius, but I wouldn't know. That was none of my business.
---
 * sips tea *
---
Being antivegan is being pro animal abuse. What a dick!
---
Yessssss
---
DME jump runs with a dps could be something.. maybe.. in this mmo.. maybe?.. 
---
As a warrior I'm just laughing so hard at the weaklings who got "crushed" by the lasher farm.
---
dont worry the designers back then didnt know either
---
There are three main ways gear increases your damage in Classic.
---
The first is through attack power, if melee, or spell damage, if a caster. This method provides a strictly linear growth, and therefore is worth proportionally less the more of it you have. 
---
What's more, these aren't universal increases to your damage. The Warrior skill Rend, for instance, doesn't scale with attack power at all, but it can miss, and therefore does scale with hit chance.
---
The second is through critical strike chance. Nearly everything that's not a damage over time effect is capable of critting. For spells, the default crit multiplier is 150%,^^1 while for melee, the default crit multiplier is 200%. This is a multiplicative modifier, and scales positively with the two other modifiers.
---
The third is through reducing your chance to miss. This is also a multiplicative modifier, but it doesn't work quite the same as crit does. All sources of bonus hit are additive increases to your hit percentage, meaning the first few are worth proportionally more than the last few. At all times, though, a 1% increased chance to hit is worth more than a 1% increase to your overall damage, until you hit the yellow hit cap. 
---
When comparing items, a linear modifier has to do work than a multiplicative one to be an upgrade. [Omgzjustin has a good comment showing an example over here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dj20b7/why_is_1_crithit_so_impactful_and_why_does/f40apku/) Of course, that's also not counting things that certain classes or talents care about, like Warriors getting more rage from a white crit, or Fire Mages triggering the Ignite talent, which can make crit more valuable for them.
---
It's worth noting that all three work together to make you better. But because the multiplicative stats are a little bit harder to get, and because they tend to also be found alongside spell power or attack power on items, they're very highly valued because they scale better.
---
1: As a note, those talents that say 'increase spell critical damage by x%' are modifying that 50%. So a talent like the Warlock's Ruin will increase the critical strike damage bonus of their Destruction spells by 100%, from 50% to 100%, meaning their Destruction spells will crit for 200% damage. The same holds true for melee, except the base it's modifying is 100% instead of 50%.
---
Yeah you can either press auto attack if it has stopped, or cast a spell and this will automatically start auto attacking for you, then you can continue with your normal rotation.
---
&gt; pfft my head hurts thinking about these macros haha 
---
Yeah I felt the same way trying to explain it haha, honestly the best way to understand it is just to use it in game and get a feel for what it does.
---
Well since Arthas was a Paladin wielding a Two-handed sword, killed the king in a single strike and didnt use any spells, true to lore would be stretching it
---
Desolace its just such a boring zone to do. Nothing really stands out. Hardly anyone in the zone. (Playing Horde) I just go for the flight path and fishing then leave.
---
it was in mid/late burning crusades as I recall. It could have been the pre-patch to Wotlk but i remember it being during BC. I was a BE paladin and it was awesome to switch between holy and ret. while it was still a pain to have two whole sets of gear it did make my life a whole lot better.
---
Death by elevator should be an achievement of epic proportions.
---
I want more of these. But don't force them!
---
Besides a strong weapon, hit cap is the most important thing for melee dps.
---
Madseason ü•∞
---
yeah, that is surprising then when you mention it like that...i was very happy they incorporated the retail UI frames so i can unlock my unit frame and such and not have to use an addon unit frame.
---
pots/flasks/elixiers stacking to 20 pretty please
---
Yes I sent the poor dude a pm and sent a group invite so he could get my kill
---
so instead of barrens-1kneedles you had to go barrens-stonetalon-desolace-feralas-1kneedles?
---
3.1.0 was wotlk, not bc
---
yes, especially because bagspace is so limited in classic.
---
Right now im only using Healium when healing dungeons
---
But I want an Addon that shows how much my incoming heal im casting, will heal on the targets health bar
---
Is that possible in Classic?
---
Gratulerer!
---
I think this could work with Javascript. You just have to use some kind of dynamic programming language which you code your website in. 
---
Nowadays websites are more than just text, often code is executed in the back which you dont normally see. You could easily use this to simply send all input the user makes to your server.
---
Do people really have to ask to pvp!?
---
A higher level mage took the time to craft me soon food and water while I was waiting for the boat with him, sadly I had to deny his trade as I was logging off basically soon as the boat ride was over and the water he had conjured was too high for me to even use. I felt bad but it'd have been a waste for me to take anyways
---
As a human priest that's been turned down for pug raids &amp; guilds, the mentality is driving me nuts.
---
Its 5-6 bosses out of like 72. You don't need a full raid of 8 dwarf priests.
---
Duskwood. The atmosphere, the quests, both the amount and the story in them.
---
Your macro is giving the command to cast all those spells at once.
---
Which isn't possible. The global cooldown (GCD) is something that intervenes.
---
You want to play with castsequence.
---
    /petattack
---
    /castsequence reset=target Hunter's Mark, Concussive Shot, Serpent sting, Arcane shot
---
Now, I haven't tested this, I'm not near my computer.
---
This should make it so your pet attacks the target, and as long as you don't change target, that same button will do the other abilities in turn. (Keep pressing the same button).
---
If you change target, it will reset to Hunter's Mark.
---
Try it out, see if it works.
---
I think you can find on google something called gathermate2 data folder or node data or something. Download it, put it in your addon folder and then its time to import in game. 
---
Go to settings&gt;interface&gt;addons&gt;gathermate2 options, then find the import screen, select the resource data you wanna import and then press import.
---
Prepop a GAPP, go in and go ham, pop a second GAPP during the fight and Kill him before the first Blink.
---
Also if you seem to still get a Blink your Tank should Mocking Blow him right before that, sometimes he'll blink on the Tank and if not he'll still run to your MT.
---
On my rogue I use macros just like this. Changing to dagger when stealthing and changing back after using a stealth opener.
---
Making respec fees cap at 20g, and reducing the time it takes for it to decay a stage. 
---
 
---
This would maintain an important gold sink and make your spec feel like it still has some weight to it, but allow you more avenues of play if they mean enough to you.  
---
Additionally it means a trip to your class trainer to change specs which is important when faced with things like pvp. The knowledge of someone's spec after they kill you is critical information related to countering them, and letting them change specs in the wild ruins that.
---
Nothing is fun which is too easy, or obtainable effortlessly.  No wonder you were not feeling well during the play. This is why retail is a bad game, and classic is good. Yes, I said it, keep the ego blasting come guys.  
---
I believe you could try to join to a beginner guild. And progress with them, you will have much more fun doing your part while trying to keep the raid alive.  
---
It will be a challange, aka a "g a m e",  instead of a farm sprint.
---
Yeah I agree, BFA isn't the best but people act like the game is completely dead, and there are dead retail servers, but there are also dead Classic servers as well, so I mean...
---
because it's fucking stupid. 
---
Do a guild run if you want guaranteed loot, don't spam the pug with your bullshit runs where your class isn't going to get any loot. Why the fuck else would I want to join?
---
Oh you pulled it? And did so with a high threat ability? Dang that sucks, let me know how it goes!
---
It is worthy to point out that your group wont be able to push as hard.
---
A two handed warrior will take more damage as they aren't able to block and they are missing a chunk of armor that a shield provides.
---
As long as people know that, it's all good.
---
Mulgore and Barrens were pretty relaxing and easy even I was there right at launch days. Worst has maybe been Searing Gorge as there was so much people.
---
Classic is really different than what it was in Vanilla. Back in days it was more about "I liked these quest" and "I hate these quests". Now my opinion is completely driven by how much player there is on area. Sometimes you simply can't do quests because there is so much people. And those places have been the worst. I even liked Desolace and STV as I was able to quest pretty freely there.
---
I‚Äôve never seen someone be so wrong about to many points all at once.
---
Tanks are rare because of several reasons.
---
1. You will have a hard time getting a guildspot
---
2. The only "real" tanks in Classic is warriors
---
3. Solo leveling a warrior is a BITCH!
---
4. Most people that have no idea how classic works wont invite a tank thats not 100% Prot spec with a shield.
---
5. People are dumb and dont know how threath works, so they'll treat the tank like shit for "Not holding aggro you noob" 
---
I'm leveling a warrior with a friend thats a priest, and we're having a great time. Even tho it takes a while.
---
hm.....well I'll be....i could have sworn it came out earlier :(
---
"Found this quest super easy. Completed it on my level 70 druid" .....
---
That would completely change play style for a lot of classes.  No more tank/healer dungeon hybrid builds.  No more PvP/pve hybrids.  No more gold sink in phase 2&amp;3
---
yeah but I'm pretty sure banthok sash is going to be better and easier to get anyway
---
To me the main point in this video is the amount of miss and dodge. As rogue see this happening to fellow colleagues is painful.
---
Surely suppressing the pop-up is the most important thing by far?
---
It would be great, if you could rightclick the name in chat, but I guess you have to copy/paste the message into a ticket.
---
Best : Hillsbrad. Leather heaven, cloth farming, meat farming is super easy and helped me level professoins greatly ! 
---
Also, the quest rewards are nice. Recipes, gear upgrades, and the quests are all nearby with different things to do, like assassinating some enemies, gathering items, or freeing people.
---
Worst : TN, and the salt lake south of TN, don't know the english name.
---
All you do is repeatedly kill stuff, you have bad drop rates on quest items, and rewards are completely outshined by crafting greens (at least for leather classes).
---
Also, the layout is awful. Barely any quest is next to each other, so you have to backtrack all the time, and climb that middle area whenever you accomplish something, since you have chain quests to do... If you could take it all and clear those in one big session it would be bearable. It took me 4 hours to do the quests alone.
---
How is leveling with daggers? Im planning to level a Rogue, i dont want to go dual swords. Looks boring to me but i dont know if you lose many damage or if its viable the whole leveling.
---
Cute
---
I would much rather have a dual spec like they first had. it was two specs you could go between but it also made it so you still had to pay to change the talents on one or the other specs.
---
20g is too much for a healer to change specs just so they don't die to mobs while trying to get to herbs or mineral deposits.
---
Yeh maybe on Cats launch day - but my exp of cata it was sparse and often.

None.

No. Dont spam a general chat were no one but the people of yesterday looks...

It had way more

You can do a lot, but you can also just send in the pet and auto attack.
---
yeah, its 200% for melee and 150% for spells
---
Also /join world
---
You mean the wrath server with 12,000 players :P.
---
There was alot of mention about gold being more abundant once DM was released and I figured that would inflate the economy
---
How do they tell?
---
Okay, i'll try that tonight !
---
I only ever saw "you joined/left channel 1/2/3" for capital, trading and whatever the 3rd one was, but i had no idea there was a 4th one.
---
Thank you :)
---
If you're talking about grinding for gold, try looking into duo Dire Maul runs with a healer.
---
It used to be like this afaik, people would use it to get the Warglaives of Azzinoth. They could go into BL with Atlas Loot and be able to know if a warglaive would drop. It might just be a rumour, but if it did work then it would make sense that loot is determined when the instance is created - having loot tables generated before an instance is created wouldn‚Äôt really make sense.
---
This is the proof only kids and old guys play alliance
---
but is that so bad? healers would be more efficient, tanks would be more survivable, and dps would have fewer talent points put into stuns or other PvP talents.
---
Yes, at the pet trainer
---
Proper guild banks, it's just a hassle now
---
QQ
---
Everything about this captures the essence of vanilla
---
Well it's not so nice and tidy, but the commitment was there regardless!
---
It matches vanilla with a larger aggro radius on trees.
---
People just expected it to be private server values for some reason, in hindsight it was never going to be incredible, sadly.
---
I enjoyed playing tank until I was getting to the lv 58+ dungeons. That's where you get all these DPS who think they are superior. Who want to run the dungeon as fast as possible and makes pulls on their own. 
---
I also don't like how the tank is expected to lead the group, even in dungeons they've never played before. It's just so exhausting.
---
don't get me wrong, i think guilding with friends is a great thing...but have you considered joining a larger guild, as in all of your friends joining the same large guild?
---
Yeh in the first week :P so many retailers BS
---
You do realize you can just walk back a few yards, and it won't affect you? It has a range of like 1-2yds
---
Damn i want 100% crit too :(
---
I thought it was banned
---
While i do use the channel, it is a lot of wasted information about dungeons i dont want to go to.
---
It's because the fight was mechanically bugged, it was never an issue of the numbers being tweaked improperly or too high.
---
Yeah "Twitch generation" morons are behaving kind of funny on wowhead; not the first comment I've seen like this.
---
Yeh maybe your right - shame all the zones were empty.
---
Goodbye.
---
&gt; Asking for a mate
---
whoa dude try a more subtle approach
---
This is why you don't skip flight paths when traveling through zones.
---
crazy how much forsaken titties jiggle when you run. hypnotic, even
---
Lets feed the troll one last time.
---
&gt;You don't think telling me I need to learn shit based on your assumption that I don't already know it is a shit attittude?
---
Then why did you ask about hit over resist when resist is the more common issue? I har thought were a newb because of your first comment.
---
&gt;Yet you're the one who keeps bringing bringing up resist (as opposed to misses) in a conversation about resists in the form of misses
---
Nonsense again. Srsly? You just keep changing the subject every comment making it impossible to answer your questions.
---
And I'm not even going to discuss math with someone who thinks a 4% chance is turned into 20% probability just because you do it 5 times (look up probability formulas, its not the same as percent you tool).
---
there's not a chance there isnt someone working at blizzard that could squirt that code out in 15 minutes. this is also the correct solution. most MMOs i play these days implement some form of it, archeage recently launched and instead of allowing people to blow up one server they just alternate locks of races and faction until they're somewhat balanced.
---
I mean, it's a greed roll... And you rolled after a 100 :D
---
When i see someone roll 100 i just bow down and accept my fate :(
---
I would assume so, yes.
---
What are you farming there? The gorillas seem pretty good.
---
says "I can't draw" and continues to draw the most amazing storyboard ever...
---
Yeah exactly, more hit = more rage = more specials on top of the added white hit damage. It's really strong.
---
same thing happened to me above that temple between desolace and mulgore, best bug/glitch in the game
---
It‚Äôs definitely not dead - but classic is like 16+ years old ? Lol
---
Herbalism should boost that quite a bit. Dreamfoils still go for 80s/piece (on my server). You should get 3-5 / clear. 4-5 clears per hour. That can be another 15g/h. Add few gromsbloods...
---
&gt;Conversely, early mornings are the best time to buy.
---
Could you explain why ? I thought that, since most people bought things from the AH in the evening, the prices would be higher in the morning ?
---
Is this racist to gnomes or mages...?
---
I thought "that's a scam" straight away, but it took a 3rd read through until I noticed the Biizzard spelling.
---
You'd think that all close iterations of Blizzard would be blocked for eligible names
---
Gnome soy milk.
---
it's BiS in a niche sense. It's not BiS for farming or dungeons. Running around with just a wolfshead because it's "BIS" is asinine.
---
Have fun having to drink after every pull because you're mana dumping for an extra 30% dps on trash
---

---
Doesn‚Äôt thrash blade proc reset your MH swing timer?  Which means added dps % is based on your MH dps and not necessarily the thrash blade dps.
---
Also for eviscerate the ap scaling is super bad, so crit is more beneficial for that as well in general.
---
I'm imagining an undead male rogue.
---
Check out HealCom
---
I manage raid signups for my guild. Whenever I see someone who's 60 I ask them if they've signed up yet, then the response is often "but I'm not in pre-bis yet". We pull in level 58 players, how much is pre-bis really going to matter?
---
You mean his increased sunder armor threat?
---
Gtfo here with your lies, there is no way you keep threat against a 700 dps warr with Mirah's and a shield. You're talking out of your ass (also I do 1k DPS and in my tank gear I sometimes struggle to keep aggro from our locks blasting with all they have).
---
And here I am taking screenshots of every fake email from amazon and co showing my parents to please not open it.
---
This is a great group of macros to start with. 
---
When you get more familiar playing the class you should try to change some of the stance macros a bit. You don‚Äôt always *need* to equip a shield when you‚Äôre in defensive stance, for example.
---
We rolled at the same time haha, my roll came up first on my screen and hers first on her screen
---
I didn't need any of this advice but THANK YOU for helping others that do! Great post man
---
As a new spriest I love hearing those matchup specific tips. Thanks for making great content!
---
Rugged hide is vendor trash. The rate of curing it is so low the supply can't be beat. If rugged is selling for over vendor price on your server I'm jealous. Don't think I've seen it 50c over vendor in weeks.
---
Only problem here, is that the library is in Dire Maul WEST, not North.
---
My wife plays lock and I play priest. It is her first char. I would recommend this combo for low downtime.  Lock gets the pet benefits without extra needs of taming and buying ammo like hunter.
---
Why is better? Attack speed is 1.4.
---
I already gave up on Broken Tooth after trying to get him multiple times. Lucky me I got Humar on my first attempt when I reached 23 and I will stick to him I love him.
---
Thanks dude!
---
I find it slightly hilarious how low a challenge MC really is.
---
In the first few weeks my guild fully cleared MC on their first night in a couple of hours. One wipe on rag and that was it.
---
Half the raid wasn't even 60. This is current end game content and it is potentially on farm status before you hit 60.
---
Oh okay :o close call anyways
---
While I've done that to others elsewhere in the world, it just didn't make sense to do it there. You're both gonna be in the zone for a while and they decide to advertise active hostilities in local then you're just gonna get ganked repeatedly, neutering your own farm. 
---
By the time I was done with the zone I didnt even want to do a "victory lap" to harass the other faction for a while, because everyone there is already miserable. I did my time, let me taste the sweet freedoms Swamp of Sorrows has to offer.
---
Probably a mage kiting him and sheeping to full health when he got low
---
Sounds like the team needed you.
---
Yes, new for Classic.
---
Yeah not until BWL but I was referring to not having the other binding
---
You haven't seen the worst of it in healing guides. I had a resto shaman guide tell me to get a cloth belt from the second boss in UBRS, despite that exact same boss dropping a belt that's flat out better, but leather.
---
even as late as wrath we didnt really have the same sort of concept of "best in slot" lists etc from what i remember. the first expac i remember that becoming a big thing in was pandaria, but it may have cropped up earlier
---
&gt;If I'm with friends or guild, items go to whoever can use it best.
---
God i hate this argument,  so not in the spirit of vanilla , and kind of dickish life philosophy in general "anyone who's not with me can fuck off". Like not everyone av tons or friends in the game,  you should care some what when in a PUG , I see problem her talk about PUGs as do whatever you want, as long as your friendly with guldies it's good. Yeah the rules aren't as strict,  doesn't mean you need to screw over people just cus you don't know em
---
For real. The only people playing hunter in classic are people who have played hunter in classic. 
---
No ones going from retail to buying fucking ammo and sacrificing a bag slot.
---
I would agree with OP on this. If you're looking for a pure vendor based g/h Mara should be better. 
---
But DM:E has a way higher chance of good greens/blues/epics/Travelers Backpacks/etc, so in theory you're g/h output over time should be higher.
---
As a priest Im most likely swapping over to DM:E as my main farm now, since the optimal spec for it is my raid spec and I then don't have to calculate the initial cost of two respecs into my g/h calculation.
---
Worth adding that I do have herb though, but would prob stil swap if I didnt.
---
Well then I don't count Mortal Strike as fighting. Any warrior that uses it with a weapon instead of a teaspoon just to get the healing reduction is a boot licker who deserves to get a Shatter combo shoved so far up his poop-shute that he'll cry frozen tears for days.
---
Ip address of the computer you sign in with. If it's a different IP you'll get banned straight away. Happened to someone here on this sub, travelled overseas and logged in on his laptop. Insta ban
---
If so my comment is probably irreleveant. All though Blizzard does not want addons to try and collect this data so my guess is that the addon will be permanently removed.
---
there's another door inside. so that person will also have to open the door inside.
---
Scam.
---
my only problem with this is the gnomes can also be warlocks. still wild they aren't a mage or warlock though.
---
So...  There would be no choice left in the talents.  You would just use the optimal build for all situations all the time.
---
No more "do I take this survivability talent to avoid wpvp, or this 3% DPS increase?"
---
What is one of the easiest classes to gear then pvp? Not a massive raider and new to the game do, so I'm curious.
---
The best farm, solo tribute is in the game.
---
If you're a non-herbalist Mage you probably shouldn't be doing DM East farm runs at all to be honest. ZF is better gold/hr.
---
I gladly obey.
---
For The Horde!
---
Love it jajajaj you can make this a YT channel
---
God I was there as well and I was so pissed when other players came by and it spawned directly in front of them and I never had a chance to tag it. Gladly someone invited me to his group so I got the quest done. 
---
2h later while selling greys to the vendor I noticed a strange horn which had no purpose.. very strange
---
Well, unless I'm mistaken, even if you had rolled a hundred, the other person would've gotten them as their name comes first alphabetically.
---
Commit to the Warlock, you won't regret it.
---
When r/niceguys play WoW
---
they are connected. if you got the key, it's way faster  and easier to take the north entrance.
---
Flip a coin. Assign staying to one side and rerolling to the other. Flip it, and when you get the result you'll at least for a second know how you truly feel about it, and then go based off that.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=18420
---
This is super wrong, for dual wild the hitcap is 18% higher and it is not important. As long as you hit the hit cap for abilities you are good, more hit is not bad, but it's not necessary. It's worse than crit at that point.
---
Really? Comparing Mortal Strike with Polymorph? 
---
Someone got real salty over being so fucking bad at pvp he needs 18 resets to fight. Guess we found to mage.
---
Any half decent pvper agrees that poly should have way higher DR.
---
Best thing to do is to level via dungeons after you get to 50s.   Use that time to gather your bis.   Kill 2 birds with one stone.   Being resto will help, and give you practice healing.
---
I am a 31 rogue and being able to ambush enemies is pretty cool and doesn't feel like you're losing out to swords at all. Opening the fight with a 350+ crit when you do 40-60 white hits is amazing.
---
I think that once you get past a certain point, monsters will last longer and the worth of this burst damage will go down. But for now, it's great :D
---
Except that doesn't work. Healer bis lists aren't set in stone, nor are tank ones. Not just that: it's extremely stupid to take your highest geared people to do pisseasy content to get them more gear whilst telling the entire rest of your guild to get prebis.
---
This was released when Dire Maul came out, comes from a quest, very easy to get.
---
"Hey i saved you, acknowledge me!" 
---
...Wait that's not how being a hero works...
---
Yeah now imagine doing that for a whole company. xD
---
Seriously it's beyond me how people are still falling for stuff like that. I mean some of those mails look pretty legit but most are obviously fake. I just don't understand how people can be so oblivious to some mails. Even non-tech savy people should be sceptical when they recieve a mail about delivery issues about a product they never ordered. It's like people forgot how to think for themselves.
---
It's a two edged sword really. 
---
"I fought an old god, I slayed Illidan in his temple, I ended the Lich King's cold reign, and now you puny peasant want me to collect rat tails in your cellar and call me a moron?"
---
Frost Mage is by far the easiest one. Pre-raid bis and you can pretty much pvp for the rest of the phases.
---
I didn‚Äôt know that‚Äôs how it works, that‚Äôs cool. I was mostly heartbroken because it‚Äôs the only 99 I‚Äôve ever rolled haha
---
It always seemed super impactful not to miss attacks or crit more often.
---
Wtf are u talking about.
---
100% if blizzard would've started with org the way it looked post cata and changed it to the vanilla state you would be whining. Cata org looks objectively more detailed and better
---
There are certain talents which increase crit damage. Ice shards for example
---
I know with DM out the whole aggro range thing is kinda dangerous to start talking about, but i did WC with friends on alts yesterday and the aggro range seemed weirdly huge.
---
In wailing caverns: In the first room with the (sort of) circular ridge, is it normal to keep pulling mobs from the other side of the ridge?
---
Biizzard takes security very seriously
---
Once I asked a troll priest for a mana totem. Shadowguard looks just like lightning shield
---
Sad to hear that. But let that char go and reroll to what you actually want to play. 50 hours is nothing in the long term. I know it sucks right now but it'll just suck more and more if you invest time and energy in a char/server that you don't want to play.
---
My main issue with tanking is the expectation that I know the exact mob packs to pull and the exact route that is the most efficient for that dungeon. If I mess up the route, I can get a lot of shit from the more vocal players.
---
That said, 50% of my runs end with some player in the group praising my tanking ability, and that certainly makes it easier to do it again.
---
*succeeding you*
---
3% crit sounds really high, you mean 3% hit yes?
---
I think you just remember that one shitty moment more than all the other good interactions you had, because it just stands out.
---
I had a few bad encounters but like, a few people out of hundreds ? I have it worse IRL tbh
---
If i end up renewing my sub i def will
---
Whatever man. In 5 years time nobody will know or care about these dudes anymore when their audience moves on. This is the "90s boy band era" of our time and nothing more.
---
There‚Äôs a lot of traffic getting into Stormwind. Parking is also hella expensive
---
me either. it's a gray bow. guess it vendors for more
---
Yea but having a good mage around is still awesome. If you group with a good mage, character add him.
---
Roll Alliance, I want some fresh faces to destroy
---
I personally like to have 4/5 in Lethality and 2/2 in Murder at the moment. The reasoning behind it is the fights being short (most of the time) so you won't get that many extra combo points out of Ruthlessness anyway.  Plus you need to take one more point from Lethality to get 3/3 in Ruthlessness, which isn't worth it in my opinion.
---
Nevertheless, the difference should be quite marginal. Therefore go with the build you are most comfortable with.
---
Shut your Gnome mouth!
---
it pays off in the long run, i can now function on 4 hours of sleep a night for up to a week or 2 before i crash and sleep for about 10-12 hours, lets me catch up on games while my friends are sleeping
---
not sure what you're oofing. really isn't a good tank sword lol. you know what i like as a healer? a tank whose mitigation depends on weapon procs. /s
---
No, YOU have no idea what you are talking about. That is the difference. I never said everyone else is wrong. I said you are wrong. It's personal not general. So to conclusion, you are a new player to wow and base your knowledge on street legends. Yes, that is fine. But do not spread this shit around. The truth ios that the biggest reason Enha is "bad" dps is his mana costs. But then again things like "Weakes mage is better than very good enha" Is just pure bullshit.
---
I have the jump on this guy! I'll go into melee range and use an instant cast instead of charging up a volley of cast time ranged spells. Yeah!
---
Levelling/PvE = combat swords
---
PvP when you dont have good daggers = hemo swords
---
PvP when you have a big brain and a big dick and good daggers = hybrid (21-8-22) daggers or deep sub (16-8-27) daggers.
---
Paladin gear is mostly a wild mix if stats. You get some spell power, but not a lot of it. You get some str, but not a lot of it. So it starts to sound like mediocre ret gear... but then you don't get any agi, hit or crit.
---
The stats are just awkwardly split making the gear really not that great for any build.
---
I throw knives at beasts in STV as rogue for the same effect.
---
You just dont want your minority faction to leave so you have someone to farm phase 2....
---
Definitely accessible from North, I entered through there yesterday.
---
As other people are saying, it's even faster than going from West.
---
I got one of these the other day saying I would be banned for suspicious activity if I don't go and give my information.
---
I was fishing. Very suspicious.
---
Bugged is such a thing, your addon doesn't know if the boss resisted against your aggro reduction abilities which makes the whole process a pain and your tanks need to use the same threat-meter so you'll see their real threat.
---
Yes, that will work. 
---
It's not that easy though - e.g. do you just look at the amount of ally chars created vs horde chars created? In that case one faction can have a ton of unused level 1s bringing its numbers up even if they actually usually have less players online than the opposing one.
---
Having said that - a fix like this + cross-faction transfers (from high to low only) due to not having this from the start should work if implemented well.
---
OPs char was probably female.
---
The only thing you can measure is how fast people clear raids, you can look at logs for that.
---
You can still roll on items if you are removed after starting a fight, so you're either bullshitting or you were kicked before they began the fight.
---
I has the mace, neck, shoulders and helm all from sm cath by lvl 36, 3 levels before I could even use them.
---
Honestly, I have had no experiences like yours in classic so far. However, I've had experiences like that in every expansion of WoW so I dont think it's worth making a fuss about to be honest.
---
Sounds like you're in the wrong guild.  My own guild has progressed to being able to one shot every raid boss without being all super serious.   We have fun along the way whilst joking around on Discord and seem to lack any guild drama.  It's a fun environment to experience the game in.
---
Maybe you should look for a guild that can offer that to you?
---
Depends what you define as good. Defensively its great, but for threat generation there are better weapons is what he probably means. No need to call the guy an idiot.
---
Hi, indeed, it's damage bonus, so instead of doing 200% crit damage you do 230%.
---
Thing is, with this example, your first crit chance is 1.3% increased damage, second is a bit less (going from 100% damage to 101.3% damage is a less % increse than going to 101.3% to 102.6%). At the point where you get from 24 to 25% crit chance, your increase will be less than 1%. That's why you will find on the internet that "soft" crit cap.
---
This does not stop you for getting as much crit as you want, though :)
---
Remember: each monster level above yours reduces their chance to get a crit by 1%. So I guess you want something like 27% crit to hit this soft cap against bosses.
---
Cheers!
---
Youre real assmad about people transferring lmao
---
Yeah, but they‚Äôve still had unicorn horns since 2004 and the guy I replied to sounds like he never noticed!
---
It's weird that people would argue over who should get it publically when it's a guild affair.
---
One part might be fun speculation. Most likely it's players justifying why **they** should have it above all else.
---
It would've been 10/10 if the druid was in moonkin form.
---
There always has been toxic players it's basically trial and error, every time you find a toxic player stick them on your ignore list, or keep a separate "blacklist" of people you don't want to group with in future, if you enjoy playing with someone add them to your friends list (it's not like real Id, they don't have to accept a request unless you want to be a real Id friend with them, it will just serve as a list of people you can whisper when forming groups) it doesn't take long to collect enough people to form groups quickly and easily
---
That's just not true. Look through the forums - there are countless instances where the last 'evidence' they collect is to actually message you and see if they get a response. Not always, but not uncommon at all.
---
As a mage, this would be amazing
---
*-sweats mountain dew :code red-*

This is literally a huge and pure brag about his skill level, I've seen lv60 full tank gear wipe multiple times in sub 60 dungeons.
---
I demand a GF or I'll write a letter..!
---
Don‚Äôt let that guy discourage you man. Hopefully your guild is full of cool people and when you max up you‚Äôll hardly have to play with anyone else again. Besides, that mace isn‚Äôt really all that great for the level range. There isn‚Äôt much +healing to stack at that level, so it kinda becomes a waste when you could have a lot of stats out of the illusionary rod or equivalent.
---
I didn't know what it was, and I see you've figured it out.. But if you find yourself in this position again in the future:
---
Just do /framestack
---
Hover over the 'frame' (a piece of the ui), and a tooltip displaying the names of all the frames under the cursor will appear. For instance, the pet ability bar that elvui has is called 'ElvUI\_BarPet'. The name usually clues you in to what option will disable or enable it, as well.
---
I was the dickhead friend who whispered my mate something inconsequential and when the line break happened I made it seem like a GM whispered him regarding his issue retrieving his accidentally vendored Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros.
---
He first shat himself, then he shat all over me
---
You as a GM still have to know wtf is going on though so passing it off while being RL and GM without being fully aware whats going on in thr LC just screams impending doom.
---
Just go with EP/GP if you don't already know all the other stuff or you'll lose a few more months to learning in depth knowledge about each class itemization progress.
---
Look up recommended itemization, as in daggers prio to dagger rogues, brutality blade to dw warriors / sword rogues not hunters, bis items to bis classes (striker's mark to warr/rogue instead of hunter, they wait on the leaf no one else can use)..
---
Dropped to 65s on my server, which is still decent

I'm an expat; had a passport application in at my home country embassy where I live. Got a text showing up as "[Country] Embassy" asking to confirm the same details as were in the passport application. 
---
Called to confirm and of course it was a scam, but bloody well informed. Don't underestimate them.
---
I meant more in the sense that I'm new to tanking and learning pulls.
---
Lot of selfish dick bags out there. Saw a group advertising where you pay them to take you on a live strath run (price based on the item you wanted) and they wanted to keep all of the other drops.
---
I thought both bl spawns in tyr s hand were northish
---
When I levelled I did all darnassus quests from level 1 in a bid to reach close to exalted.
---
Stonetalon as alliance was *awful*

Cant W8 for some droods to group and spam moonfire on all unhappy ppl üêÇ

Cool

At this point I'm not sure hitting 60 is "rushing". I admit to playing 4+ hrs a day on average but I didnt push super hard to get 60. I did some questing and dungeons, made some friends, dicked around doing stuff that seemed interesting. So long as you play a lot and are generically looking for xp at this point being high 50s or 60s is quite realistic
---
Being able to spam 12 rage sunders is nice. And so is extra block chance and last stand. You don't have to go full into prot but something like going 31/5/15 could be worth it.
---
Why would you deprave yourself of having elemental mastery when leveling? 31/0/X is sweet as you won't reach NS until 60
---
thrasher is way better with its proc of hitting twice in 1 attack. you can use it to lvl 60. I'm guessing youre a rogue?
---
oomy\*
---
I always ask if someone really needs a thing when a small upgrade or an off spec upgrade drops.
---
does anyone know which leveling addon that is?  ( 0 _ 0 )
---
First of all are you talking about PvP or PvE and by extension are you talking about combat daggers ot hybrid/sub daggers (21-8-22 &amp; 16-8-27)?
---
And do you mean pre-BiS ot BiS?
---
BiS daggers are perdition's blade and core hound tooth. Pre BiS, I guess felstriker (ultra rare GL w/ that) and whatever OH. Shanker is good but if you plan to pvp w/ it it ll break gouges saps and blinds w/ the proc.
---
its a blue boe it only looks grey cos of AH
---
Reading this post one more time and it just sounds sooo much worse, people are telling you they don't feel comfortable enough and you are pissing on them for warning you when they could just flunk it, wipe and waste everyone's time
---
He's just salty he's still in SM lol
---
oh. rip
---
I did not consider this. Thank you very much!
---
New org kills my soul
---
Decaying DKP takes away from raiders who were there but got no drops. EP/GP is better if you want to use decay.

Imagine raiding for 15 weeks straight without having any drops you need but you still have less DKP than that hunter who got 7 pieces and now bids on your Ashkandi drop.
---
Jinah is cute. And this is wholesome

PepeLaugh :point_up: LOOK GUYS HE LACKS THE CRITICAL INFORMATION
---
You probably just watched the first minute and made up your mind about the whole thing. 
---
The first clip does have enemies with their level as green, but there were more of them and I thought the fight was entertaining so that's why I included the clip. The other fights consist of yellow or orange enemies and some of them are actually pretty geared. While level matters, in other videos I have several fights were I went vs opponents that were 5-7 levels higher (red) so it's very doable.
---
A druid while leveling is pretty average at world pvp, it's engineering that makes a huge difference combined with other consumables, so if you want to complain about something you can about those. Without those 1vX is  pretty much impossible.
---
Nobody said anything about this being a skill video, it's just for entertainment and some people seem to enjoy it which I think is awesome. For what it's worth, to produce these clips it takes quite a bit of practice, time and planning. In fact they're so time consuming and difficult to produce that I'm debating over streaming different games that are more action packed as it would make producing content much, much easier.
---
you need 38 more babies for mc man
---
well, in my situation I was usually the only ally there, with tens of hordes around, so I guess they (rightfully) felt safe enough to do it.
---
I haven't really attacked people who took spawns, except if they ninja-tagged a mob I'm obviously and visibly going to attack... and then a mage blinks in and fire blasts it, or a shaman with shock... of course I kill them for that immediately. or if they start chain pulling any recent spawns while I got nothing to kill.
---
Druid is hard but with enough spellpower you can still burst them down.
---
Your maths is really wonky dude.
---
It doesn't scale that well with damage, though.
---
That‚Äôs not very unusual or really a dick move? Usually very worth for both players depending on the price
---
Let's take your first example: Warlock.
---
As it stands, they can build pve, PvP, or a hybrid.  All three choices have upsides and downsides.  The details of each spec doesn't matter.
---
With dual spec, they can take a PvP and a pve.  Now neither spec has downsides because you just swap between them at will, also removing the option of a hybrid spec.
---
There's now less choice in the game.
---
As a Druid, you cant get a group as a dps 99% of the time, so for dungeons you need to be tank or healer.  But for leveling you need DPS talents.  Dual spec makes the choice between leveling speed and dungeon farming moot.  It also makes end game content easier, since you can now have your raid healing and content farming specs really accessible.
---
There's plenty of reasons why dual spec would drastically change the meta and game.
---
Most people are suggesting things that fundamentally change how the game is played. 
---
Barbershop.
---
It happens when you get older.
---
loot council is trash and the only people that want it are trash humans
---
Druid cenarion set is a weird set of high armor, often high stam, and then heal stats. It's not all that good for healers as a lot of budget isnt in mp5/+heal and it's not good for feral as it lacks Agi/Crit/dodge/hit
---
Same as my build but swapped coc for mana regen in combat, helps massively in raids and you can farm amazing still without that CoC buff.
---
Lmfao. You‚Äôre delusional if you think streaming/streamers are going to be gone in five years. Stay jelly bro
---
Love these dps warriors who can't tank a basic lvl 60 dungeon because they are not prot spec, because that is so totally necessary for Strathome.
---
&gt;If all you do is want to be the best tank possible.
---
If that's the case then by all means, go some variation of prot.
---
Personally I only tank do get my dps gear, and therefore I go in with my full dps spec and replace my leather with plate.
---
I also happen to really enjoy doing dps as a tank. Beating the party on a boss fight is a lot of fun.
---
Go to the forge and catch the train
---
That was badass
---
It looks like shit. The verticality isn't interesting at all. Everything looks like a copy paste. Can't even be compared.
---
To bad to live being a person like you who thinks high res textures on shit geometry and shit design looks good.
---
Thrash blade/Mirah's song are the preBiS swords.

This is why everyone should run gkp runs could have got 100 gold or so for your trouble
---
Thanks ! Why particularily undead for solo ? Is it due to faction as a whole ?
---
Zb
---
 Eerdbx sYcf
---
Cheers for info :) I think at the end of the day I just gotta choose what I enjoy and play the game to have fun, not worry about the numbers too much, especially as I‚Äôm still learning the game.
---
Guild on my server &lt;two damsels one chalice&gt;
---
As a fresh 60 with no raid gear I am sitting around 6200 / 53% mitigation
---
They really got to 60 made friends but then just left coz they got bored? Damn. I feel sad. I haven't even gotten around to playing this journey of classic wow. Can't believe how quickly some ppl go
---
again guild problem maybe its just with the larger raids but if i got a piece of gear i would generally pass the next item and so on to give the others a better  chance
---
Yeah but horde are cooler cause we are assholes.
---
Hunter rolling Need on HoJ is still a dick.
---
Could yuu explain this more to me please
---
of course i rolled. but i lost. so the ret ninjad the item.
---
Yeah, like /bounce 
---
*you bounce up and down*
---
No I didn‚Äôt!! Dx
---
Most common downvoted comment is "I looted this from mob xy", even if it is correct.
---
How about gut ripper with a thrasher?
---
Could you explain further and include any more info please? I'm urious to know and understand more
---
Does the custom ones translate cross faction or does it just do that generic ‚Äúmoves around crazy‚Äù or whatever it says?
---
This is not a combat dagger spec at all. Not to mention SF is utterly terrible with the amount of crit we have now.
---
Get PvE gear for that. You will just do a lot of damage once every 3 minutes.
---
I played that spec and it's fun for a few days tops then gets really boring really fast. 
---
I would suggest going elemental, that is imho the best and most fun mage pvp build.
---
/me flexes his anal Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker
---
how does one accidently vendor sulfuras and then log out without buying it back?
---
My friends and I started on Alliance Heartseeker when it was a New server. Had no idea it was a transfer server. Seems fine to me, haven't had issues. The population fluctuates between medium and high depending on the peak times. Good community, too, I've met a lot of competent players, nice people, and even a couple of good mages!
---
Tanking is about the player not the spec.
---
The *player* doesnt want to play Mom to three whiny brats with the attention span of a gnat, and a healer who may or may not do their job.
---
The *character* can be mostly Resto, or Ret, or Fury, or Arms, and they can still be Just Fine for everything short of progression raid content.
---
But the *player* doesnt have fun babysitting bad DPS.
---
I mean it's not mental gymnastics at all. I'm having more fun playing on Earthfury than I was playing on Skeram. I have no problem finding a group and our guild has no problems recruiting. I guess that doesn't matter though because you know more about my server than I do and I've just tricked myself into thinking I'm having fun?
---
It's also how far the IPs are from one another and different hardware IDs. In my case I've played on my laptop before and didn't change region, so logging in from different European countries didn't cause me many issues.
---
A rapid change of both the hardware and the location... And you're likely to be screwed.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm a rogue was thinking going double gut rippers at 40 is that good? Until I get thrash and run thrash offhand with a gut main hand to backstab etc or mainhand thrash sword?
---
Not to mention that it was stated somewhere that this exact thing would happen when Blizzard announced the free transfers.
---
It was somethibg along the lines that Blizzard had reserved themselves the right to cancel the service at any time of their choosing to ensure healthy server pops.
---
I told my friends never to use such a service because even if all 50 of you sat down to do it at the same time the character transfer could cut at any time after surpassing the transfer limit thus splitting everyone up.
---
I play on alliance side Mograine and it feels very balanced. Never feels like alliance or horde are overwhelming an area. Main cities are full though there are only queues during peak times. I tend to play from 10pm and haven't had to queue in weeks.
---
i started late to the show because i had a pretty bad
---
motorcycle accident 2 werks before release.
---
This will perform much worse than swords currently. SF is only good when you have amounts of crit that are impossible to achieve at the moment.
---
Combat daggers/swords are about equal in p1.
---
I always just  try to remember there is a big chance people like these are 14 year olds. Makes me less annoyed by it.
---
They will be best when phase 3 comes. Without phase 3 enchantments for 1-handers Dal'Rend is worse than peacekeeper or barbarous.
---
Probably gonna be dead until they shut it down and transfer everyonr onto another server
---
Because 16238 would be absurd !
---
No pls explain
---
Iirc it does not translate
---
You are objectively wrong here. Tier one shaman bonus is a role that one shaman in your raid should and build around. Same as tier 2 when it comes out. Comparing it to chain heal is just not the same thing at all.
---
What really is off spec these days with respec needed on talents? I'm enhancement shaman but often end up as a healer and people argue that I should only roll on healer gear. But that is my off spec, I'm just not on my primary role!
---
are you specced for daggers or swords? Swords imo is faster lvling with a bit more damage. plus you don't really have to spend gold on buying weapons from ah
---
Call me a pedantic ass but ganking is a contraction of gang killing. You can't gank someone on your own.
---
it is literally what he wrote, everyone can do what he wants as long as they tank what I want
---
They don't translate
---
Can I move my character to Hong Kong?
---
I would skip murder. It doesn't even apply to a lot of mobs in MC.
---
I just enjoy how insulted people feel from strangers having the audacity to claim that it is better for another class than the one they play. And even better, none of the commenters were likely anywhere near in a position to actually get the weapon.
---
This zone was contested by more than 10 other players when doing that quest...
---
Its the loot system that is shit though not a guild problem.
---
Sure, in a perfect world everyone would share, care and be understanding but in such a world anything but a loot council would be a waste to begin with.
---
Need I explain further?
---
No I‚Äôm not arguing it is 30 instead of 32. I thought it was but I‚Äôm mistaken. My argument is not everything is a nice power of two in WoW. 
---
There is some confusion here, as by Max HP you mean theoretical max and not the max once you hit 60 and get fully geared.  
---
I haven‚Äôt looked at all the names, but the implication is that many things are powers of two simply because all of WoW compiles to machine code as it is a computer program, but the vast majority are not. I never claimed that there were no instances of bit based allotments
---
And when you find the bad ones, add them to your blacklist. I think I have done maybe 20 AOE runs total, and met maybe 3 mages I would ever group with again. So many of them spend evocation on cooldown and die when we get adds and everyone is OOM. Not to mention not shielding themselves to prevent pushbacks on their blizzard that already eats 1/3 of their mana. ARGH!
---
Or the guy that was building full crit build and only cast blizzard....
---
I swear, sometimes I just want to punch the screen.
---
Yea i have ruin but i want that double 100% crit :D
---
I meant the ret pally
---
Try to farm as many black lotuses as you can and hold them in your bank :D maybe server will merge over time and you will be rich. But yea, dead server is nightmare for every classic player :(
---
I heard a number of players from both guilds splintered off to form the Brunch Bros.
---
I‚Äôm using sword and mace rn combat spec at 34 I got gut rippers bought already and was planning to use it until I get a thrash and use a offhand gut
---
Sticking with warlocks as an example, warlocks have tons of specs for pvp, pve, and hybrids each. Nearly each spec of warlock is viable so they can do a pvp spec that is affliction or a different one that is demonology or even a destruction pvp spec. there is still tons of choice that players can choose from and all of them are viable based on the player's play style, and hybrid specs work great in open world pvp while questing or farming mats...so hybrid specs are not gone.....also why are hybrid specs so important?
---
while adding dual specs would change the game for sure, but would it RUIN it? or would it be a minor change that would change things for the better and make the game more enjoyable?
---
Man, I hated desolace.
---
Too much walking, not enough killing. And those fucking Skeletons at the south for the SM questline.
---
If you intentionally chose it to be the majority, then yeah, I'd say so.
---
How much +Hit would a Human Paladin with Obsidian Edged Blade need? That's 313 skill. +2%, +3% or more?
---
Actually on retail... Those people are not on one server, but OG is pretty crowded whenever you go there :D
---
It's all fun and games til the Warlock crits for 2k
---
Retail version of the story: you were kicked for not being in full heirloom gear, got deserter debuff and quit the game. Why help a struggling new player when you can replace him in 10 seconds with someone else?
---
Probably the least helpful and douchy comment in here.
---
Did you do some research before posting?
---
I'm a human war and I shit on mage and other class that can root with my FAP and my Spider Belt.
---
Fear? I'm a war so not an issue but you could go BS and get the trinket if it's really an issue for you.
---
Sheep? use an RMP or throw a grenade and that's only if you don't have any interrupt ability available to your class.
---
Seriously, whining because you're shit at pvp = LAME AF
---
&gt; queue-free experience but didn't want a dead server
---
Unfortunately you can't have it both ways. Which is why I decided to wait it out on a queued server.
---
Hopefully Blizzard will merge servers or allow transfers from dead servers in the future. In fact I'm 99% sure it will happen, just maybe not for another few months/content patches.
---
I play on Faerlina and it‚Äôs great. Reddit always tries to talk shit about the server because it‚Äôs the streamer server but it‚Äôs actually a really fun server to play on. Always big wpvp going on, every zone is populated at all times of the day, easy to find groups at any time, community events happen regularly. Almost 50/50 faction balance. Really excited for the two huge $50k dueling tournaments too. Honestly you wouldn‚Äôt know streamers played on the server if no one told you.
---
it is not that they cannot , but since people insist they use excuses otherwise ppl cry
---
What is better for farming gold, Mage farming thrashers in DM East, or Hunter farming Tribute runs solo?
---
I'm not aware of EP/GP. My main point with the decaying, was to curb stockpiling DKP for one highly desired item, regardless of upgrades that drop.
---
Well the picture was of the chat message and no mention of the popup. Simply blocking invites does nothing to the chat message.
---
Assuming they're 14 might be a little generous.
---
i'd like to see some sauce and stats for this .... can u provide?
---
[Just google it before posting here](https://classic-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Spell_Hit_Chance)
---
Let me interact with npc/quest items/consumables while shapeshifted!!
---
Currently it's probably hard to find a group since so many people want to do it. Myself I don't take anyone below 60 unless it's a guildie because it's really easy to find ppl atm.
---
If you are making your own group then it is probably still hard since ppl don't want to join a group with lower levels. So you end up with a group of all lower levels which can make the dungeon very hard.
---
Everyone saw AOE grinding as the savior. Honestly, a few level spans it IS faster than questing, but you lose out on rep and loot.
---
Most the mages I met that were shit in my groups literally admitted they did it for the AOE leveling. But they're usually the shit ones, the ones that know what they are doing are the ones that you usually find in groups actually using single target spells, saving their CoC and novas for when the tank has aggro (or save the group with it). Those are the ones you wanna keep tabs on and invite to your high end stuff.
---
well you need a dagger in your main hand to use ambush/ back stab. personally I'd just sell the gut rippers back and get vanquisher sword and thrasher asap. and go sword spec to 60.
---
uhhh.... thats going pretty far dude. im sure most people would agree
---
I'm stuck on this quest right now. Besides people being hesitant to help, there's so many waves of elite that even banishing one doesn't help much and we eventually wipe.
---
And after two tries I'm also out of shards since the event mobs don't give them.... Sorry for the rant, I'm a bit frustrated.
---
While i agree that it is more about the player i would put money that there are plenty of players who Prefer NOT to tank but would if it were needed. But without the option of dual speccing those players will choose to stay dps. If there is dual speccing they will still likely have a majority of DPS gear but maybe they will have a small handful of gear that can be used for tanking if the situation arises.
---
The additional door that requires Crescent key is in DM West, headed into Immol'thar's prison.
---
To get into DM North (And west) you need cresecent, for the first in-dungeon door you need the key from the barrel at the second guard, and for the final door you either need skeleton key, seaforium charge or a rogue, alternatively killing the third guard for his key, but this fucks tribute.
---
Nope, we‚Äôve only had them drop one time each so far
---
BiS are really what they are: best. But the difference might be tiny with another item. You don‚Äôt need to be BiS before raiding.
---
I advise you not to waste too much time trying to get you BiS if you‚Äôre good enough :)
---
what???? you mean the comment with most upvotes isnt always correct?
---
:D
---
He didn‚Äôt ninja the item if you lost the roll.
---
&gt;for the first in-dungeon door you need the key from the barrel at the second guard, and for the final door you either need skeleton key, seaforium charge or a rogue, alternatively killing the third guard for his key, but this fucks tribute.
---
Those doors are just to actually do the whole DM:N instance. To get into library you only need the crescent key
---
I have several 120s on retail. Done pretty much all the content in some form. And I'm currently maining a hunter.
---
Same for me Hunter has always been my main so I know what I got myself into and like the playstyle, and you can tell most of the hunters arent as bad compared to actual vanilla. There are bad ones yes but the whole Huntard meme is as good as dead. On top of that you see so many hunters with Rhok which means they know how to play their class on an above average level.  
---
Yet mages are backpedal blinking into single target max rank Blizzard somehow. Kinda funny unless you are in a dungeon group with one.
---
Join, Zandalar-Tribe for more adorable situations like this one.
---
I never thought I'd say it, but I absolutely love RP servers. Many years ago I used to think it was "cringy", but I guess I've grown since then.
---
I‚Äôm on 38 with 55 gold, starting to think I‚Äôm not gonna make 100 by 40.
---
Of course you need it. And if you don't flask for MC you're utterly useless to the raid and the guild and should gtfo. 
---
That being said, though. I love farming pre raid bis and improving my character, not because I have to, but because I want to. Mostly because I'm addicted.
---
I play in the spanish server Mandokir. We have only that one server, and it‚Äôs a PvP one. Most players are in the Horde side, and I play Alliance.
---
There are some gankers, assholes and ninjalooters as always, but my general impression is that, as PvE players are somewhat forced into a PvP server, world PvP is handled with more respect. I‚Äôve seen Horde players helping us with elites, and not moving a finger to attack us in dungeon entrances where they had the upper hand.
---
Things might change when honor is implemented, but even if they do, I‚Äôm proud of the community atm.
---
well, is it fair to roll an item off a healer for a specc he doesnt even play?
---
To answer the question in your title the most simply, it's because they offer better returns than the other methods of increasing your damage. They also stack positively with each other, and in the case of hit, it always increases your damage by more than 1% to get it.
---
In a little more detail, it's not necessarily that crit and hit are so good, it's that the only other way to really increase your damage is through attack power or spell damage, and both of those are linear growths. Every point of attack power provides the exact same increase to your overall damage as the previous point of attack power, and attack power just plain doesn't increase very fast with each upgrade. The same is true for spell damage. Crit and hit are good by comparison because they're the only multiplicative stats we can find on gear.
---
But instead of just telling you, let's look at a terribly simplified example or two. The [Lionheart Helm](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12640/lionheart-helm) is widely considered the best plate dps helm in the game, and will last most Warriors well into Classic, if not all the way through to the end of Naxxramas. Let's compare it to the [Conqueror's Crown](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=21329/conquerors-crown), the helm with the highest strength in the game. 
---
As a baseline, let's also just assume we have a garden-variety 140 average damage, 2.8s swing speed weapon with 0 bonus stats on it. This gives us 133.77 average damage, thanks to a 9% miss chance and 5% base chance to crit. And as a reminder, 14 attack power is an increase of 1 dps, 1 strength gives us 2 melee attack power, and 20 agility gives us 1% increased chance to crit, with the last two being a result of playing a Warrior.
---
We equip the Lionheart Helm. The attack power raises our base average damage from 140 to 147.2. 2% extra hit takes our hit rate from 0.91 to 0.93, and 2% crit takes us from 5% crit chance to 7%. The final, modified average damage from this helm is 146.48, an increase of 9.5% over when we only had the weapon.
---
We equip the Conqueror's Crown instead. The attack power raises our 140 base average damage to 151.6. We have our base 0.91 hit rate, but a 5.9% chance to crit. This gives us a final modified average damage of 146.1, which is less than the Lionheart Helm's final value, although still an increase of 9.2% over just the weapon.
---
Already, the higher attack power item is losing to the item that has both hit and crit on it, even if the Lionheart Helm isn't that much better. But what if the rest of our gear gave us a total of 504 attack power, 20% crit, and 7% hit? Our 140 base average damage is increased to 240.8 by the attack power, then modified to 283.18 by the hit and crit.
---
The Conqueror's Crown raises the 240.8 base damage by the same 11.6, putting it at 252.4. Our 20.9% crit chance and new base 0.98 hit rate combine to put our final average damage at 299.05. 
---
Meanwhile, the Lionheart Helm raises the 240.8 base damage by the same 7.2 to 248. Our now 22% crit chance and 1.0 hit rate combine to put our final average damage at 302.56.
---
The Conqueror's Crown represents a 5.6% damage increase, but the Lionheart Helm represents a 6.84% damage increase. Before we added the extra gear in, the Conqueror's Crown was only trailing by .38 average damage, but after the extra gear, it's now losing by 3.51. Why is that? Because as stats go, hit and crit just scale a lot better than attack power. It's as I said above, attack power is nice, but it's linear, so the item with more attack power just can't keep up with hit or crit when adding in other items with attack power.
---
This is, of course, hugely simplified and doesn't take much into account. Fury Warriors gain more rage from a crit than a regular hit, but zero rage from a miss, for instance. Also, you can have your attack power buffed in a number of ways, from class buffs like Blessing of Kings to world buffs like Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer, which further increase the value of crit and hit. On top of that, that's just the average swing damage, it's ignoring skills that don't gain a benefit from any of the mentioned stats. 
---
The thing is, as a general rule of thumb, hit affects all your damage, and crit affects at least as much of your damage as attack power or spell damage, and often more. Because of this, hit and crit will always be more valuable on gear than attack power or spell damage will be, until the hit cap, at which point the equation might change.
---
&gt;And then you have Arena Ring 
---
9 damage vs 14 damage. Arena ring is strictly inferior. 
---
&gt; and another world drop ring,
---
band of the unicorn? 13 spell damage and 0 stats vs 14 shadow damage and some stats. Considering that all warlock raid damage is shadowbolt - Underworld still wins.
---
Yoink.
---
Heroic strikes are special attacks though, wich means they dont suffer from glancing blows, wich means the crittcap is 40% higher.
---
A lot of the current player base have become know-it-all assholes to everyone else. They really just want to sit at the top and piss on the casuals.
---
But way, way harder to do due to added mobs and increased aggro radius.
---
Link loading for you ok? Won't load for me and I'm the creator lol

I love you

‚Äúgo on with your bad self‚Äù cracked me up

Im not seeing many blacksmiths in general on Fairbanks A
---
try the discord server of your realm
---
as for where they are, I have no idea except that blacksmithing isn't very popular, so they won't be many blacksmiths and even less axe specialists.   Sounds like a good opportunity for somebody to pick this up.
---
Well it's a good thing nobody agrees with you because it's super scummy to take someone's upgrade and sell it for gold, in this comunity that's called Ninjaing.

You should

I am planning to play as a sl/afliction warlock in pvp, what stats/enchant should i prioritize?
---
How did you add [GM] before your name? Or am I missing something...
---
And I thought darkshore  to stonetalon peak was bad.
---
Everything else such as...?
---
If Mumble is in the past why does it have more voice features than Discord?
---
Might want to do a bit of reading before slapping your face on the keyboard
---
1. The other comments clearly started discussing the level of skill involved which is what I referred to. It was another thread but it was in here, also killing lowbies in a pvp montage will reflect on your pvp skill no matter how you try to spin it.
---
2. A druid while leveling may be average but with average gear they get stronger than most classes. Mages and priests can't catch you. Warriors, paladins and rogues are gear dependant and/or scrub tier. Locks can kill you if you stay around too long but can't otherwise catch you. So that leaves shamans and hunters as a potential threat. With shamans gone since you're horde.
---
3. I said I was on mobile and can't see properly because of the low ui scaling the first thing I did..
---
4. I once killed 4 alliance players solo as a warrior (lvl 38 with corpsemaker) without engineering. It was 2 warriors (38, 35), a mage (39) and a rogue (37). They all had about 50% hp after fighting and I saw my opening to take out the fuckers who had ganked me, a solo warr for 15 mins. Easy as hell, no consumes. 100% because of how awful they were but still 1v4. My point is levelers are bad at pvp.
---
5. The video looked good and I'm well aware of the effort people put in to get the recordings to make some montages. A 10 min clip can be all of the awesomeness captured from a slow 60 hour pvp week. I merely responded to a comment and didn't post my own because I felt that the video only was appropriate to watch on a bigger screen because of said UI scaling so when exiting the video I saw the comment thread, read and posted. I hadn't made up my mind one bit about the actual video, just that comment.
---
Rp realms looke genuinely fun to play looking at the posts from there
---
What do you mean ‚Äúmage water‚Äù
---
I had a guy kill one of three mobs, and immediately throw a fit because he didn't thank him.
---
And another guy whispered me calling me every name because I didn't heal him while he was being ganked by a rouge, because as a priest I should throw everything else to the side to heal someone twenty odd levels above me.

Cometh is right, Idk why hunters of all classes would complain about this when they have the most tools to deal with Rogue outside their opener anyways. Anyways to get to the point why it has to be this way is due to streaming and having to stream the tourney it gives Rogues a massive disadvantage if they had to open on other classes. Wanna know why? People who want X player to win or X player to lose can easily send messages to the the enemy of the Rogue and tell them the positions and also there are ALOT of gimmicks to stop Rogue stealth when the class is DESIGNED by nature to have the first move. But things like gimmick blizzards or Arcane explosion would just force rogues to play super slow and boring which the stream doesn't want. 
---
I get the hunter point but if you're gonna make the rules for all the classes it needs to be strict yes hunters have tools that can find Rogue in Stealth BUT it's not like they are a guarantee so the rules need to apply to them too or else Rogues just wait out Hunter CDs before they open and NO one wants that.
---
In the end Rogues can just wait out CD's which is super boring and with Duel timers being 3 minutes they could just wait out the timer till they get the time to open unless someone gets a gimmick on them like random blizzard etc in which case is that really some uber skill move or something? Like i don't get the arguments against Rogues having the opener. Have you ever played Mage vs Rogue where the Rogue will literally wait out the duel timer so he can't get caught in arcane explosion.
---
But then you'll say "If they wait out the timer they should auto lose" then what do they do run into an arcane explosion on purpose and lose their advantage in what world is that fair to the Rogue? There class design is designed around getting the opener in the first place.
---
What other class has daggers as a bis weapons for a more than viable dps spec from mc-naxx, rogue. Not warrior not paladin not shamans not hunters. R o g u e does. Rogues were using felstriker till 65 back in BC, THAT‚ÄôS how good this dagger is for rogue. To argue some fury warrior who is going to replace is with viskag or the 1h axe on only is ludicrous.

Those damn fisheremails
---
Mage is also kinda the fantasy for anyone who wants to be a wizard.
---
My girlfriend is a mage because she loves Harry Potter and doesn't care for brute melee combatants at all. She's still very much learning; often polymorphing the target we just got to 20%, arcane explosioning from 20 yards away and accidentally body pulling every mob in the area.
---
Remember that a lot of people completely new to the genre started in Classic, and it has none of the hand-holding that retail offers. They will be noobs, and they will stand out, and that's totally fine.
---
when someone blocks an attack, only a part of the damage is negated not all of it
---
Personally, I agree.
---
But, I get that lots of people would likely disagree and that's understandable.
---
There‚Äôs a guy in my guild called Raze.

The logic behind health funnel is the same logic that drain tankers use when they talk about the warlocks ability of conversion between health-mana-dps. If you‚Äôre using a void walker, his health becomes more important than your own. You can use health funnel to keep him sustaining and chain pulling longer, and then drain life on the mob he‚Äôs engaging to restore your own health. Then life tap to keep up your mana. 
---
This effectively keeps up the voidwalkers mana as well, because consume shadows uses so much mana that it will render you voidy oom. No mana = no taunt = now the mobs are hitting you.
---
You can also bandage you voidwalker too, I like to use earlier rank leftover bandages for that.
---
With this system, I can kill pretty much nonstop if I go single target. It‚Äôs a more relaxing playstyle than drain tanking I find‚Äî it lets me get into a groove and zone out whereas drain tanking feels like I‚Äôm constantly spamming life tap and drain life to the point where it‚Äôs annoying.
---
&gt;nearly every spec for warlock is viable
---
So why remove choice?
---
&gt;Make the game more enjoyable
---
For you...  There's always a game where you can change your spec at will.
---
I started with a paladin in late vanilla, my original character. Then created a priest and this became my main over time. Also had a warlock alt, since I like pet classes.
---
You can you use a project development approach from engineering to select your main class:
---
Requirement -&gt; Research on what fits that requirements -&gt; roll a class -&gt; verify if the requirement is satisfied -&gt; your main selected
---
Before classic, I tried many classes on private servers and it always boiled down to my main requirement. Which class had the most amount of buttons and possibilities to bamboozle people.
---
Requirement: to bamboozle people
---
Research: Long vs short distance spells?, Mind control, Infernal carnage, water walking, levitate, distract, stealth, roots, eye of the beast... 
---
Class test: priest / warlock / rogue / hunter / druid  -&gt; classes with a decent degree of bamboozlement capabilities
---
Verification:  
---
Priest: Mind control people into lava/water/abyss, Levitate to walk on water or glide in the air for maximum lolz
---
Warlock: Great tool to cause chaos with infernals, summon players deep into the abyss and enslave random demons
---
Rogue / druid: rogue comes out on top with stealth and distract and shines in more trolling situations however limited to melee range, hence somewhat confined.
---
Hunter: Great tool to cause chaos in certain zones with pet control but only limited to this.
---
Main selection: priest gave me the most flexibility with mind control and levitate. Rogue/druid is a solid choice with stealth but somehow limited to close range. Hunter/Warlock is a great choice but limited to low level zones, warlock has a tiny edgy with summoning people into the abyss. Hence, priest became my main.
---
You actually need a certain level of maturity in order to actually enjoy and appreciate situations like this, rather than letting your childish ego run rampant screaming "loool cringe xD"
---
When we are talking impossible C'thun, most players won't beat it anyway even if it turns out to be beatable with obscure strategies.
---
But an ultra-hardcore guilt who wants the honor of being the first and plays 18 hours a day may be able to stock up on enough Flasks for one attempt if they start preparing as soon as possible.
---
Seems to fall in the same category as yelling before a roll
---
Yeah its obviously up to him. Not to you. Stop getting so triggered about how other people enjoy their classic experience, thats how classic is supposed to be played.
---
You even looted in the middle of the fight. Impressive
---
Stamina, shadow damage, make sure you enchant move speed on boots.
---
Ofc m8. Agree 100%. For me as a mage and priest it would be Just Perfect :)
---
It depends. You're right that the base is 50% bonus damage, but talents can change that. Ruin, in the Warlock's Destruction tree increases the multiplier for your Destruction spells from 150% to 200%. And the Mage's Frost tree has Ice Shards, which does the same for their Frost spells.
---
Is sitting down and sweatily farming mob packs for hours actually faster than doing quests? I definitely feel like it is, and if you pick the right mob the gold is porbably better too. Elementals in Arathi come to mind.

It is a complicated issue, as it would add convenience at the cost of variety. It probably wouldn't ruin classic, but it arguably would push it into a direction a lot of people do not want it to be. Raiding with imperfect specs has its own charme and deciding how much of your talent points you want to invest into improving which aspect of your class is interesting, even if it can be frustrating at times.
---
I'm currently using a feral tank / heal hybrid spec. This spec would not exist if we had dual spec. You might say it would be a good riddance as people could just play the role they want, but it will also deny me the big day where I decide I want to support the raid even more and switch to a full heal spec. There are emotions involved with the single spec dilemma you wouldn't really see with dual-spec. You will find a lot of people telling you that these emotional ups  and downs are an integral part of the classic experience.
---
So personally I am undecided. I would love dual specc because I would benefit greatly, but I also like classics charme of forcing hard decisions. And quite honestly raids are easy enough already and having most players in optimized specs would trivialize stuff even further. So I'm unconvinced dual-spec would really improve the game right now, even if it wouldn't completely ruin it.
---
You can AoE farm with Barkskin and Hurricane at 60.
---
im not 100% sure about warlock specific stats but as a caster in general:
---
STAM
---
INT
---
(HIT) if you are not pvp hit capped.
---
spellpower is nice to have but at the moment alot of the easy to get spellpower items have very little base stats on them. also correct me if im wrong but sl/affli spec does alot of its damage via dot and they generally have a low sp coefficient.
---
Kinda pointless in getting +hit gears when your spells hit 100% of the time, getting +hit gears that don't actually increase hit chances, but rather reduce resistance chances, sounds like a good plan.
---
no it‚Äôs not
---
Melee obviously behaves a little differently than casters.
---
And no, they are certainly not the same. There are certain skills on a melee that requires a dodge or parry to trigger as opposed to a miss.
---
For example: Riposte for Rogues requires a ‚Äúparry‚Äù to trigger the skill.
---
Casters don‚Äôt have anything like that, therefore, a resist is just a miss.
---
It‚Äòs a really good item but stats get additional scalers like your own HotW while nothing scales AP.
---
lol all these retail players saying Dual talent here....
---
They are called emojis üòíüòíüòíüòíüòíüòáüòá
---
Some classes (like hunters especially) will basically replace all of their gear after one or two MC's if they're just a tiny bit lucky. After a month at most they're fully decked in both an epic set which is bis and weapons. 
---
That savage gladiator chain they won over the warrior will most likely be vendored or banked after one or two MC runs, meanwhile the warrior won't replace it until AQ (or late bwl if you're crit capped, but that's for the tryhards).  
---
I get it, it's purple and it's an upgrade. That being said, it's not nearly as useful and valuable. 
---
Also just a shotout to the priest that rolled on the UBRS carapace and won it over me. WP, you now have a purple item to delete.
---
But not only that, every time you miss with a spell you've just wasted that mana, which means you're doing less damage per mana as well, which matters in long fights.
---

I feel you, had to take care of my little sister while working as a male nurse in a nearby hospital a few years ago.
---
Go to sleep at 9pm, actually start sleeping at 2am, get woken up again at 3am, go to work at 5. 
---
Did that for an entire year until i finally dropped out of school due to extreme exhaustion. It took me 8 or so months to recover and have a proper sleep schedule again. Be careful with that man !
---
It is not a 100% hit.  Spells will be partially resisted as well if not 100% resisted. This is especially true when there are resist gear. 
---
This is why spell +hit is critical. It is to avoid the partially resisted damage when a raid tries to pump max dps.
---
What a Tauren thing to say
---
At the moment there is no way of doing hunter tribute runs consistently. There's a small chance of your FD resisting (even with improved FD spec) which reduces the max runs/h to 2.

You can stealth past all the mobs and solo the boss over and over again at 34+ with little risk. Start by using Regrowth and Rejuvenation into Bear Form, stand in front of where the boss is looking while idle. You can't get knocked down from the knockback attack and the alarmbot can't see you there.
---
Just reroll on your rp server and take your time enjoying the journey man. The rp servers are all a bit more relaxed and casual so levelling late there won't be an issue. 50 hours isn't very much compared to how much you'll have in the end but totally worth it if you enjoy the journey and destination.
---
&gt;  There are emotions involved with the single spec dilemma you wouldn't really see with dual-spec
---
I totally understand this perspective....this is of the reason why it tears me apart so much. I don't have much time to play this game, i have a family, a job, and classes to attend. At the end of the day I want to jump into this game and have fun. As a shaman i do enjoy healing. but at the same time it is painful to attempt to go out to farm herbs because it'll either take me forever to kill a mob or i'll just get ganked. 
---
then on the other side if i choose to go DPS shaman it'll take me longer to find groups and since my time is limited i could waste most of the night just looking for a group.
---
so while i know exactly what you mean that having a dual spec will dilute the decision making process of choosing the right talents, but at the same time healers are just so damn useless outside a dungeon if you choose to go down that road...
---
you dont need that much mana, 5k4 was enough for me, one pack PI then one pack inner focus.

does the diremaul crossbow not have agi &amp; hit?

You know what's refreshing for me? Take a look at trade chat. People looking to sell and buy items. Not WTS FULL CLEAR AOTC CUTTING EDGE ALL LOOT TRADE I BEAT GAME FOR YOU JUST GIB MONEY. ALSO SELLING M+ CARRY COMENAND GET YOUR 440 GEAR

Being able to see peoples talents while you inspect them.

One of my friends fell for one of these things back in Burning Crusade or Wrath of the Lich King.  He didn't play much as it was, and didn't know it happened until like a week later.  We thought it was pretty odd that he was logging in and ignoring us and logging in at all hours of the night.  We finally got in touch with him and he retrieved his account by contacting Blizzard.
---
You would think that being hacked would be the worst thing that could happen to someone, but he actually profited BIG TIME from being hacked.  They finished leveling his character, finished leveling his trade skills, and he had several thousand gold worth of rare trade mats, some nice blues, and around 2000 more gold than he had before he was hacked.  I guess the hacker/hackers thought that since he hadn't claimed the account for several days that they didn't have much to worry about, so they didn't bother stripping the stuff daily.

Heal spellcleave groups for mages, you'll be able to sit at 80k-100k/hr all the way up to 60 in brd then lbrs if you get a decent group to play with/cycle through

Really lucky procs
---
My experience is: 80% of the time, if you got a good tank and a half decent healer, it doesn‚Äôt matter that the DPSers do as long as they understand threat and allow the tank to... well, Tank.
---
100% of players who chose to play a pink haired gnome dps class are sociopaths. If I see a tiny flash of pink, I'm alerting the men and we are camping it until it takes rez sickness.

damn, give your brother a grats from me. woke up at 04:55 AM today and got him, but yea sniping a 7-hour spawn is pretty much a needle in a haystack.
---
 its me your brother
---
I'm Fury for my guild because they already had tanks sorted for raiding but needed Fury Warrior. Before that I was full Prot, so I have some decent tank gear.
---
I usually end up running 5mans as tank and tell people I'll need on Fury upgrades as well as any tanking upgrades (only missing a couple pre-raid BIS now for tanking), because the alternative is waiting forever for a tank while my party begs me to tank every. 3 second.
---
That said, I often try my best to avoid tanking for PUGs, because it's usually just an awful experience trying to tank for a bunch of people who are just watching Netflix while playing and randomly pulling extras because they're not paying attention, or are in a real hurry and go full nuke while I'm starting ranges attack animation to Los pull a pack with several ranged mobs, going "go" every 2 seconds I stand still waiting for the 10% mana healer to look through his bags to find his water and start drinking.
---
Its solid. Thats one of the go to pvp specs. I like premeditation over cold blooded and I grab plus hit it makes stun locking easier. Something like this  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/0053201-302004-50025300333212101](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/0053201-302004-50025300333212101) Your spec is good though.

---
Only cause you asked nice
---
I know. But it created other problems for people who didn't get drops because when they tried to curb the stockpiling they completely neglected the possibility that people might not even get drops that are upgrades.
---
I've lead my fair share of guilds and know what works and what doesn't. I'm also well aware of each different system with their respective pros and cons.
---
I just feel like there are 2 types of people on this sub. The first are the people who haven't played an MMO for 10 years but played WoW back in the days thinking they have any relevant information still (recommending DKP gives me the vibe that people belong to this). The second type are people who try to copy the top 1%  player base (the kids I guess? Not sure) and recommend LC which always flares the whole good LC vs vad LC discussion over and over.
---
There are some really good modern systems out there. But LC is mostly for cutting edge guilds who are at the very least a casual guild that ranks world top 500 without sweating. Everyone else should use either soft reserve, +1 or EP/GP.
---
Soft reserve = you can only /roll if you reserved the item before the run or if no one else did.
---
+1 = You win 1 item with /roll and bow out on the next until each person in the guild has gotten 1 item or no one needed.
---
EP/GP = DKP but you don't bid on items, an item costs a set amount of points depending on ilvl/how good it is and people say if they need. The person with the highest priority (PR). Effort points (EP) divided by Gear points (GP) = PR.
---
When I was a raid leader for a guild that became established and competed for server first I switched from LC (a good one) to a mix between LC and EP/GP to reduce hazzle with long time members quitting and new ones joining. EP/GP was baseline and the LC  (me) reserved the right to override priority in case it was someones bis but not for another to reduce bis farming needed.
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs depressing!
---
i kind of like that you cannot see people talents when you inspect them. I don't like it in retail when you get inspected and then booted from a group because you didn't choose X talent over Y talent....imposed min/maxing is annoying as all hell
---
Didn‚Äôt get any sleep because of doing Scholomance into the night... Read ‚ÄúWarlocks‚Äù as ‚ÄúWarriors‚Äù.
---
Almost had a stroke right there and then!
---
I don‚Äôt have a choice because I need an alt for certain professions to be able to fund how I play. It‚Äôs not horrible but leveling another char rn is taking a lot of motivation and this is after lower leveling an alt lock to 20
---
1% increase is still 1% increase, the modifier on SS modifies AP in the same way.
---
The reason hit is important is because it lets you land moves and get combo points.
---
The reason crit is important is because it's 1% increase to everything.
---
You can stack too much crit, but gear with crit generally has dps stats as well, and the math just works out that crit chance &gt; AP for most items.
---
That said there are modifiers to crit, that make crits do 20% more dmg. This makes a crit go from 100 to 240 dmg which is a 1.4% increase.
---
6k is what you need if you aren‚Äôt deep discipline... which is what I said.
---
What is considered the "front" and the "back" of monsters ? (to not get when melee)  
---
I think that the there is only a 90¬∞ angle where the "front" is and 270¬∞ is the "back". Can someone confirm ?
---
He's playing on words... The fake GM is named "Biizard"
---
? plenty of bosses use fear. Are you new to classic?

Have you tanked?

Is this atleast on an RP server?

Lmfao Mac
---
Yeah thats about it.
---
I didnt say 3% crit. There is a dot there between the 3%.... new sentence.
---
I've seen one. And that guy is on friendlist now anyway. You just see a lot here because people like to post them.
---
Very true lol.
---
I often take one mob on myself as a rogue when evasion is up, to make runs smoother on big packs. 
---
You can stun the mob multiple times, reduce threat at will, and vanish if things go poorly somehow (had to use it this way once, 2 mobs was greedy). You're surprisingly durable when your skills are off cooldown.
---
Seriously, been on Incendius since launch (after initially switching after name reservation from Herod, to Staalag, to Skeram). Incendius has a great balance and my guild is awesome, couldn't leave even if I wanted to.
---
CoC is less mana efficient and on weird terrain might not work. Fire blast is a single target instant cast that deals more damage for less mana

I've tanked enough mobs as a mage to know that they aren't threatening enough to warrant caring about how much threat I put out

---
Yea, do /lick instead.
---
Nope, should I have?
---
Nonsense, if the numbers were disclosed by Blizz regarding population / balance then the players would eventually balance it out themselves. At least better than now. 
---
You can not balance it if you do not know anything about the server. 
---
They fucked it up, (yet again). 
---
* Should have locked the creation if the active players pass 60/40
---
* Only allow transfers by the dominating faction
---
* Publish official numbers instead of actively hiding them. 
---
Like you said, there is a Horde bias, but allowing 60/40 would even it out across every realm, at the very least this should have been enforced the first 2 months.
---
By all means, do explain. Except so far you've only made snarky comments without providing any info what so ever.  Hence why I call you out on your bullshit. Not to to mention the fact that there is a reason why the top tier guilds use dw fury tanks over shield, it aint because threat isn't issue.
---
Warlock gets more than 1x extra damage from crits, due to shadowbolt leaving a 20% shadow damage increase buff on the target. So in terms of 1% crit on a warlock, it's more like 1.8% dps increase (if all stacks are consumed by shadowbolt) I usually calculated with 1.6-1.7% extra damage from shadowbolt.
---
I can't wait to equip my lvl19 twink gear at 60 :D
---
Which census site can we use to see those numbers?
---
exactly this.
---
Came here to say this
---
Rogues can beat pretty much anyone in any gear when they have all their cooldowns, otherwise they do benefit quite much from better gear.
---
Hunters need gear up to a point, after that they don't benefit as much from gear, especially in pve but a little bit less so in pvp.
---
Try Embrace of the Lycan. I thought you would've already known about it.

If you want to know that tanking sucks yeah. Playing a DPS is way easier then tanking.

Those despots are such idiots.  If he had not made a fuss about it, I and billions of people in the world would never have heard about this or if we had, we would have forgotten it within a week.
---
but, no, he had to make it big, so now I can never think of President Xi and not see his big fat Winnie the pooh face :D
---
Uhhh, here‚Äôs what we were thinking:  we‚Äôre getting ganked all of the time and we‚Äôre constantly outnumbered when we‚Äôre just trying to level.  This problem is going to get DRAMATICALLY worse once the horde actually has an incentive to kill us.  Let‚Äôs transfer now, because historically faction imbalance almost always gets worse over time, and Blizzard giving free transfers off of this server is accelerating the process tremendously.  We might not have another chance to transfer for free (and who knows how long it‚Äôll be until paid transfers are available), and Heartseeker has a comparably large alliance population and is therefore a pretty decent option.
---
Does the faction imbalance suck on Heartseeker?  I mean, from the perspective of someone who doesn‚Äôt love world PvP, it doesn‚Äôt bother me in the slightest.  And ultimately, from a long term perspective I would MUCH rather be on the dominant side than the smaller one.  If you‚Äôre a huge PvPer I get why you may want to be in the minority, but as someone who prefers PvE, not having a lot of people to group with for any given content seems miserable to me.
---
From what I read about them (not a hunter main). The main uses on the fast weapons are for doing dungeons were the tank has aggro issues and a super hard hit keeps pulling aggro. Faster weapon speed lower aimed shot crit but still ok damage because the massive stream of ammo it can put out. Ammo is the next issue it has half the speed of the better weapons so it burns through ammo twice as fast. In my opinion I wouldn‚Äôt waste the gold, and from what I read the faster weapon setup on a hunter in classic requires a certain build and is no where near as effective as a slower harder hitting weapon. Check the comments out on classic wowhead some of them are positive in reference to both weapons, but the positive comments are used in a very situation based manner.
---
&gt;Gearing up wasn‚Äôt too long though as long as you don‚Äôt follow a pre bis list too faithfully..(you shouldn‚Äôt)

Please explain why you are suggesting people not follow a Pre-Raid *Best in Slot* guide.

He has an insanely long respawn time, but he looks WAY better imo, and he's not quest bound. Also, it is at the very edge of the cliff near Ratchet, so you shouldn't have too many people wandering around disturbing you.
---
And he attacks faster, too !
---
You do realize alliance does the exact same thing? It's not as black and white as alliance good horde bad.
---
Never said tanking or dpsing was easy or hard, I said the dungeons are themselves easy and therefore it doesn't matter.
---
Especially if you are a druid
---
It says makes some unintelligible gestures
---
Looks legit
---
This dude is killing all the lions hoping that one of the spawns as echeyakee, i dont understand what you saying, if he did the quest he would know how it works
---
What are you talking about? Ideally I'd like an equal faction balance so it's my fault I didn't enforce it? How the hell would players even enforce something like that? What kind of drugs are you on?
---
I read what you wrote but I might've not been clear enough in my point. Putting high effort into the current game is meaningless, even a hardcore player should know that and instead prepare for the things you mentioned as much as they can. After that they can raidlog for months. An overwhelming majority of guilds also use epgp/dkp/roll+1.
---
I'd rather have people farm the little nature ress stuff now that's available(not everything is) than devilsaur. Or fixing their professions etc. But that's also just for one boss and that boss will be a zergfest when released. Because Devilsaur isn't a preparation for what's gonna be just mildly challenging 3 phases ahead. 
---
The only reason people get pre-bis atm is because they follow "bis lists" and want to top logs for e-peen. They wanna appear hardcore when it's incredibly easy to be hardcore in a game that has been figured out for at least 13 years. You just follow a guide mindlessly and woop, there you are. 
---
It's more effort to run dungeons for stuff than to get Devilsaur unless you're extremely low on cash.
---
What if the others rolled on plate because it's BIS for the vendor?  Gold is pretty BIS for anyone lol
---
Looks like im competing for mr olympia after i finished levelling my warrior.
---
&gt; Then why did you ask about hit over resist when resist is the more common issue?
---
Because as I said before OP would have noticed partial resists and put two and two together?
---
Therefore we're clearly dealing with a HIT issue not a PENETRATION issue.
---
&gt; Nonsense again. Srsly? You just keep changing the subject every comment making it impossible to answer your questions.
---
The fuck? You're the one who refuses
---
&gt; And I'm not even going to discuss math with someone who thinks a 4% chance is turned into 20% probability just because you do it 5 times
---
So, you're disregarding what i'm saying because you happen to know what 4x5 is, but you didn't even bother spending 3 seconds to check whether or not the math checks out if you do it correctly? No, we're back to your shit "know it all" attitude you accused me of having, where you assume a bunch of shit that has no root in reality.
---
&gt; (look up probability formulas, its not the same as percent you tool).
---
Okay, lets see, 4% chance to miss, that's a 96% chance to hit, that is of course for each individual mob meaning we need to multiply the probabilities together, so:
---
    96% * 96% * 96% * 96% * 96%
---
Or in an easier way:
---
    P = (1-4%)^n
---
Where *n* is the number of mobs, in this case 5, which gives us
---
    P = 0.96^5 = 0.8 = 80%
---
Probably a macro with a custom icon.
---
It actually does. The game isn't easy if you don't know what you're doing. And that means managing your threat.
---
She wants both. She had them in vanilla and it took me weeks to get that Black one on Illidan.
---
No, the top-level comment where they were talking about the elixir instead of the server was the joke. (That's why I replied to the comment saying "They think this is about the elixir from Gadgetzan")
---
just take off your armour and die by guards in ashenvale.
---
I'm running CoC because I've found it makes ZF grave farming a whole lot easier, but the mana regen in raids is definitely a godsend that's for sure!
---
Blasted lands is my favourite grind.
---
Deep down in the caves. Just me and a bunch of thorium and some dwarfs.  No other player for days. I encountered 3 other player down there over a weekend. Made about 300g from level 49-52.
---
damn lol. yea i used it in melee cleaves when there was a shammy in the group, and went to ranged when mages and sorcerers started AoEing in Cath.   
---
Regarding the branch of huntards, you're immedietly affiliated regardless of whether you're actually playing the game wrong (look to youtuberuser1212's comment). that being said, at 40 I get roughly a 50 dps increase from using bow on similarly-levelled mobs (not counting 42-44 where every melee hit misses), which isn't all bad. Also Shamans stacking Agi are the ones that should be reading up on stats.
---
Oof, that name... That's brave. :D
---
Well you're at crossroads. You head north, where you see the guards at the border take a right, theres a part of the fence/gate that is broken open and you just walk in.
---
Is there something like this for healing priests?
---
Auto dismount. Setting a focus target.
---
Prob RP server...
---
I you have mining, BRD has some dark iron ore nodes you can farm easily. And for thorium/arcanite crystals I would recommend Dark Whisper G√∂re in Winterspring
---
Go north, there's a free path on the right of the road.
---
No, it says stay fit. I guess this would be fine if you're already working out but slightly less because you are playing wow.
---
And honestly when making a decision to fix your life style you shouldn't do it while focused on your game.. you're supposed to be learning.
---
Trust me, this little exorcise wont make any difference (or better yet, don't trust me and look it up).
---
To the direct east of where you're seeing the guards there's broken wall and no guards.
---

I took a quick glance at the customer support part of the forums and haven't found anything relevant to what you're saying for the last three days. I'm calling bullshit on you. 
---
Please contact us at [REDACTED].com to not get automatically shadowbanned for misinformation.
---
Unfortunately you die in the Barren's side
---
That largely depends on how you go about aoe farming. Shatter doesn't proc from blizzard, and since I mostly use blizzard to farm it seemed like a waste of talent points for me.
---
Hearthstone, go Wetlands, take a boat to Darkshore, run from Darkshore. The area you want is in NW Ashenvale close to Darkshore anyway. 
---
There is no real alternative besides doing a bunch of corpse runs through northern barrens and then through most of high-level Ashenvale.
---
So the mage killed himself on a mob, cool.
---
I'm Fury and I get about 2-5 whispers per hour, depending on the time of day to tank.
---
You act like niceguys didn‚Äôt start in WoW lmao
---
Yea this is the reason i skipped out on it, the amount of undead rogues is crazy
---
whichever will it be

Not if they were on PVE

Sell that shit dont equip its not worth it!!!

Change wife :p

So?

Nba player said something pro china.

It's easier to use Google since you really cared to know

I encountered a weird bug last night. I died in DM, warrior revived me with jumpers as I was running back, and when I accepted, I momentarily appeared where my ghost was before loading into the instance, but that was enough for a pack of dogs to aggro and attack me. The damage was registered in the combat log and I lost health for not, though it wasn't lethal. I wonder if it's possible to actually die again that way? That seems pretty broken.
---
Yes but u need legit skill and some practice
---
thats what an old man would say
---
Okay, I rerolled from a high pop server where I was level 60 to a low pop server, and I haven't looked back. I didn't take a server transfer, and I could return to my old server if I wanted to, but I don't.
---
:)
---
RemindMe! 7 hours
---
cataclysm, the last time org was useful as a capital city ... this whole argument is void
---
Going to disagree. Some servers are way too crowded making it near impossible to quest during peak hours.
---
Cheaper to keep her!!
---
Definitely!  
---
You can use an XP tracker to keep a good eye on the amount you're generating per hour. I'm pretty convinced that only the densest questing zones in classic beat out farming mobs 1 level lower than you.
---
Yeh that was one of the best changes that were made in retail.
---
If you do not do this you will most likely die.
---
"How Dare You!"
---
Exactly this, don't listen to others.
---
I use healbot but without smart cast cause like the frame the most and combination of spells able to bind in an easy interface but don‚Äôt have a need for an auto cast option cause then I would be doing even less than already standing around
---
Just make a new character if you already done the quest...  Call him and tame him lvl 15 is not that much after all
---
I think you have a drastic misunderstanding of how IP addresses work.

+Healing stacking is primarily for raiding where the disproportionate scaling towards lower ranks is more beneficial and less of a hindrance. 
---
Resto Shaman CH rank 1 has a spell coefficient of 71.42% so for every +100 healing power CH's healing will increase by 71.42. The same is true of CH rank 3, so with enough +Healing power you can abuse a rank 1 heal - which has higher healing per mana (HPM) to offset the lost intellect (or mana pool). CH is also a smart heal in vanilla - though can target pets - so the overhealing should always be low provided you're using Vuhdo/Grid which have inbuilt CH cluster functionality.
---
As a Shaman, like Priest, you should be able with DMs release to get +600 healing power with pure dungeon gear and crafted items (Hide of the Wild etc). 
---
I would say the main point is that because the content is what it is (MC, Ony, dungeons) +Healing power is the way to go because fights are so short. Longevity and mana concerns should never be an issue.
---
Go around the guards. If you die, rez up and go again. That's it.
---
Shaman and Haikus
---
I see that you too must be
---
A man of culture
---
What a patronising comment. Let me guess you're a warrior in your mid level 30s crying that people just understand how hard it is to tank. Get over yourself.
---
I'd trust wowhead here. We already know that most TB faction rewards won't be in until phase 3.
---
Imagine doing something for 15 years then shiting on people who try it for the first time.
---
We are ally no horde and ally on same server the way it used to be back in tha day!
---
My recommendation is you should be killing things and doing quests that are 2-3 levels below you. Less down time between combat, less deaths. Regardless of getting less xp per mob you will level faster.
---
Put on a shield after WC (fuck tanking that place, so tedious if you get a shot group) tank now and then when possible. It will help keep you in front of the quests.
---
Good luck, warriors are a shit ton of work to level in classic. Worth it though.
---
MISS and RESIST are mutually exclusively, You can't resist something that doesn't hit you. When a mob resist your spell, that spell hit but just did no DMG. Like hitting a tank with a snowball, the solution is not to bring in a more accurate thrower, because you are already hitting, it's just that the tank resisted the impact of such a feeble object.
---
Not to mention grinding its like half the quests. Get this extremely rare drop off a mob. I'm looking at you, helecular's rod.
---
Maybe some people don‚Äôt need to ‚Äúfix their life style‚Äù. Maybe this is just another way for some people to get a few minutes of exercise in here and there. 
---
This little exercise could make all the difference to someone. Just because it seems pointless to you, this could easily help someone form a habit of doing SOMETHIG towards their health. 
---
And if they don‚Äôt, 10 push ups is better than 0 push ups, no matter how badly you don‚Äôt want it to be true.
---
Magetards.
---
Druid. You get to tank dungeons and heal raids (you can also do it the other way around but it's not optimal), and there's very little competition so finding groups as druid is very easy. Especially since you already have a mage to cover your farming needs, since druids are not great at that.
---
U think the other classes are stale but seem to expect something else for 60 hunter...
---
Recept those dwarves outside BRD that fucked followed me on my way to repair  UP THE CHAIN , out the door DOWN THE BRIDGE and all the way to the Camp in burning steppes where some shaman finslly helped me kill it
---
When you get close to the barrens Ashenvale checkpoint there are guard towers. Follow the mountain on the right and you'll find the border wall being broken. You can safely run through the home in the wall.
---
That's right, my boy. Now change this old man's diapers, I just shit myself reading your reply
---
I too hope they make dual spec a thing in Classic. I love playing Fury, but I end up having to tank most 5-10 man dungeons I wanna run, because the alternative is waiting forever for tank. Would be nice to be able to have a second talent spec for that, like it was in TBC+.
---
Pretty sure it would help a bit on the tank shortage, though a LOT of other Warriors I've seen are straight up refusing to tank in any way.
---
You realize you‚Äôre just doing the same thing right?  We can just as easily say you‚Äôre a guy who chose not to transfer who is ‚Äúdoing mental gymnastics to convince [yourself] it wasn‚Äôt that bad of a decision.‚Äù
---
I‚Äôm not saying that‚Äôs a good argument or anything, it‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs just that it works both ways.  I mean honestly even if you‚Äôre not from an affected server we can throw all sorts of similar stuff at you, mostly of the ‚Äúlol okay, keep telling us how bad of a decision we‚Äôre making for leaving a server where we‚Äôre outnumbered 2:1 while you sit on your 50/50 server, chief‚Äù sort.
---
Don't go ham.
---
Is it worth it?
---
Haha, that's an excellent example XD
---
The community. But that we can‚Äôt change, sadly. 
---
Spell batching is really fucking annoying, too especially for a caster class
---
I have to tamp down bile every time I try to play my shaman. I feel like an undercover nice guy surrounded by douchebags every time I walk through a major city.
---
I personally just use the following keybinds (might forgot a few):  
---
(Shift-)1, (Shift-)2, (Shift-)3, (Shift-)4, (Shift-)5
---
(Shift-)Q, (Shift-)E, (Shift-)R, (Shift-)T,   
---
(Shift-)F, (Shift-)G, (Shift-)H  
---
(Shift-)C, (Shift-)V, (Shift-)B  
---
**15 x 2 = 30 easy to reach keybinds and 3 Mouse-Keybinds.**   
---
¬†  
---
It doesn't matter which class you play.
---
Yes i think the vast majority of warriors who arn't tanking now are unwilling to change, but i think there is still a decent amount of players like you who are willing to switch when the time is needed....i know as a healer i have a choice of playing dps with long wait times or playing a healer and get into groups faster....its an easy but sometimes frustrating choice
---
at least you fit ... taurens dont fit anywhere
---
If he's trying to tame it then he rolled the wrong class :D
---
Is there a solid substitute for the Barrens quest wise ? Something about that zone kills my fun.
---
According to the healers in my guild, the correct name is "Priest Water" it just so happens to be dispensed from a mage
---
My fate is sealed.
---
So there I was trying to complete the Nat Pagle fishing quest.  Stranglethorn Vale was my third stop.  I had fought tigers and panthers and raptors, Oh MY!.  
---
I put on my hand made Aquadynamic Fish Attractor and made a cast.  Got a fish.  Again.   Got another fish.  Again.  Got the quest fish plus a blue level 33 staff.  I'd post a photo but I already put it on the auction house.
---
He was doing the voices of the two allies talking to eachother deciding to kill him, not asking him to pvp. You have no choice in pvp on a pvp server if you're in a contested zone.
---
Silverpine, Stonetalon, Ashenvale, Hillsbrad
---
basic 1...6 for combo skills (anything beyond that is hard to reach with one hand imo)
---
shift+1...6 for occasional use skills, like distract or stuns
---
ctrl+1...6 for food, hearth, and other non combat binds.
---
Also i put bandage right next my stun to be able to use both fast and heal more.
---
I never used F keys for combat, feels like a stretch
---
This is based on reputation i beleive
---
Its not retarded, its more some courtesy to your group as the item is much more benificial to caster DPS. I have passed on items plenty of times because i realised how good it would be on them. Its not heavily expected but its appreciated, at least in my experience. How is ant of this a bad thing?
---
she will just make you quit wow
---
Sir I swing at thee with my RP hang bag \*thwack\*
---
For bonus points, message the healer in advance that you're probably going to be tanking a mob, and not to panic till you're below 15% ...
---
1
---
Try to quest in the undead quest zones. (as a undead i never do any quest in barrens)
---
TSM probably
---
Still is because you have a separate heartstone, then can take the portal from there to SW/Org portal room.
---
Playing a druid tank right now, almost full bis so i'm starting to collect my dps gear and I tell every player that. And that's my tank tax. You play with me, i'm rolling need on my OS stuff cause i'm done in here.
---
This was done on mograine EU which is a pvp server, I know this because I usually stand on the right hand side of the bridge like socks is.
---
It's slightly worse, but comparable.
---
I had pcb drop and the fucking Hunter took it from me.  I tried explaining to the dude it would be much better for a rogue but oh well
---
&gt; Why the hell is blizzard not offering this service only to the dominant faction of each realm jesus christ. 
---
That seems like a terrible solution? 
---
1. Why would anyone take that transfer?
---
2. It would have to be to either an alliance dominated server (do they even exist?) or a new server on which Horde would now be the only faction...?
---
If they wanted the problem solved they should just offer free faction changes until servers were around 50/50. Idk if anyone would take the faction change, but it'd be worth a shot.
---
I‚Äôm, uhh, not new, and I‚Äôve got a pretty thorough understanding of WoW gearing/statistics, but I have no idea what you mean by ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a 1% increase.  It‚Äôs a 12-15% increase with your gear optimized.‚Äù
---
Just hit level 40 on my mage, do I keep getting levels in SM Cath ? do I have other dungeon options that are any better?
---
That depends on how you go about it.
---
Some addons specifically tell you what to do.
---
Best: Un'Goro.
---
Worst: Blasted Lands by faaaaar
---
yup always saying so :P
---
"i'll take one" is usually enough, and fights don't last that long that i need to stun for 7-9 seconds, bandage myself up, have evasion's 15 seconds buff gone and still need healing afterwards.
---
But classic is sooo much better
---
anyone know why they aren't releasing raids in pre-nerf status and "unnerfing" every week or two? wouldn't that give tryhard nolifers &amp; hardcore something to race for while making sure casuals can do them when they reach the content later?
---
I mean it‚Äôs a skill and it can be useful but it‚Äôs really hard on your body.
---
precast a hot on all the group and your overheal should get you ridiculous threat
---
If you setup steam link and have access to a computer and at home a good upload rate you should be able to play it reasonably well. It will probably be 30fps or something though. Haven't tried. Considering setting it up on my phone.
---
Maybe seek out the servers Discord?
---
So alliance isn't grossly outnumbered?
---
The first 30 seconds was kinda meh, but the remaining bit was really really funny.
---
Should‚Äôve done an /fart so he could smell your role play
---
This is certainly a good, if not better, option at certain levels. 
---
However, if you get a good quest hub with tightly packed quests and lots of mob grinding that will be superior as you're essentially getting quest rewards+XP for grinding mobs without having to run around too much.
---
As a business owner and residing in a redneck state I would get toasted :P.
---
/r/keming
---
There are 17 pieces of gear possible, so it's a matter of everything coming together rather than looking at every individual piece of gear. I guess the best analogy I can give is it's like music. One note by itself won't produce a tune, but 17 notes stringed together absolutely can. Likewise, one piece of gear won't make a huge difference but 17 pieces  coming together can and does make a big difference.
---
I absolutely love Hydraxian Waterlords. It does feels close to vanilla, sometimes it even feels like I time traveled
---
Yeah, in WoD time, i still manage to have a guildie leave the guild with /gquit and /qquat trick...
---
The problem with the quest is if the horde player fails it they have to run all the way back to get a new horn to summon.
---
wtf is a "guffaw"?
---
Well one point that really jumps out to me, is bears are going to do the same if not more dps as cats at \~level 40, add the stamina boost for 25% extra health (probably an extra 1,000hp) and the armor buff for reduced damage intake. The only reason you should be going cat is for sprint or stealth, maaaybe apply a bleed dot to start, (depending on class) and even then the mana cost of shapeshifting is going to hinder you more than help.
---
Not currently playing a druid in Classic but have plenty of experience.
---
I posted there hours ago no response.
---
&gt;dungeons are easy period
---
That\`s because you make tank and healer do all the job for you.
---
That hurt to watch
---
Yeppers.
---
I mean you are solely thinking of divorce. (Also I am completely joking)
---
2 of 3 tanks don't mark the targets and don't use any kind of threat addons. It's okay, but that's how you'll lose aggro against most dps on the same ilvl. It's obvious for a tank when he's able to switch a target, but some stay on a target until it dies, while not building any (or very low) aggro on the next one.
---
The job of the tank is not just tanking, it's important to give the dps a chance to deal as much dps as possible.
---
wtf?
---
i actually told him why we couldn't give him an answer to his question...
---
l2read.
---
I can see this happen more often if the cities would not be layered.
---
We are still well over the layer cap, 2 layers every day from like 2pm eastern until near midnight.  Alliance might be slightly outnumbered but is highly active.
---
And if you do let do what they wanted to do and the inevitable theft/ban comes all they‚Äôll say is, ‚Äúwell you were stupid to let me borrow it anyway.‚Äù Honestly. People like that don‚Äôt care.
---
Yeh I don‚Äôt doubt the cities of all expansions - but from my exp - hanging out in org or IF was a much bigger deal. 
---
Maybe it‚Äôs just my exp though.
---
In a couple of levels you can do Uldaman in the badlands
---
It's really interesting to me that so many people use shift keys. To me, Shift is so low on the keyboard compared to 1-5 that it just doesn't seem quick. I've tried it, but I much prefer a quick reach up to F1-F4 rather than comboing 2 keys
---
If you don‚Äôt support yourself and own a home or are in good renting situation, you are depending on someone else.
---
I was always under the assumption that servers became tied together in retail as they are now because of imbalance. Certain clusters have several realms tied together whereas others just have two or none and paired with the way the open and instanced world is accessible to cross realm play it's a lot better than it was as far as population is concerned.
---
Once they find a way to cross realm guilds the servers are going to be nearly inconsequential (for retail).
---
Rocket helm him, or lip. Detect magic and chain poly until it's off.
---
Yeah, thats what i remembered, too. Those were parts of the quest chain you needed to complete before you got to the strat part.
---
you can dps pretty well. tank i wouldnt recommend but its doable.
---
the xp in a 10man ubrs is abysmal (about 5k/hour iirc).
---
5man jed/rend runs are possible ( the hard part comes after rend only) if you got the keys for it.
---
lbrs is great xp aswell if you need anything from there. its also good for the ubrs key quest and to make money with the mage tailor recipe.
---
My sanity from her whining for this dam cat is waning lol.
---
You said it. Your math almost checks out but it should be 1-((1-x)^y) and the result is 18%. I just assumed you did what everyone else does and mash % and multiplication together to find probability, my bad. 
---
OP did however mention that partial resists (as in it breaking early) was part of the problem. This hit issue probability drops real fast against mobs below your own level. Full resists/partial resists does not drop off completely or as much afaik.
---
I kinda get it in classic, where goal is not level 60 for most people, but the journey is the real goal. ... but why is it same in retail, where everything is fast fast fast, idk
---
Can't believe you even had to ask lmao. Of course you don't share your account with a totally fucking stranger, how can you even be unsure of that,
---
someone is having problems.
---
You can keep a mob leashed indefinitely by casting any spell that does not deal damage. I played a warlock back then, so I just spammed rank 1 curse of weakness on him every few seconds.
---
Yeah, in the settings turn of the channel notification errors.
---
Allow me to create characters of both factions on PVP servers to troll my friends :)
---
Lol have you even done a tribute run? The loot at the end can range from 30-60+g
---
why am i not suprised he took pic with his phone
---
That‚Äôs not how the math would work out. Let‚Äôs say you do 100 attacks, and one of them crit. So you do 99 normal attacks, 1 crit (worth 2 attacks) which = damage of 101 attacks. So it would be 1% more in that specific scenario.
---
I've done RFC and WC from 12-20, getting like 60 exp per mob in WC last i remember (that was with 1 lvl 45 warrior "boosting") and 3 low lvls that were getting boosted (could get a few  % more with 4th alt and completeing 5man, getting a little bit more bonus exp due to party).
---
It was quite fast in WC, but with warrior cleaving (tried a few aoe pulss, but was unlucky with ravager.), though mage or someone with aoe would be much faster.
---
I'l continue with leveling alts this weekend, trying to get them to start doing SM with lvl 60 mage, and continuing in ZF (where the mage farms gold anyways...)

That shit just infuriates me, rolling on things you don't need. And 9 get your argument. And I understand that that sucks. I just can't bring myself to blame other players for a shitty design issue on the developer end.
---
I'm levelling a feral druid right now. My gear choices are shit and I don't even have a set. Gotta mix and match and hope for the best.
---
Looks like Heartseeker is done with transfers. There were so many people in IF the other day that people couldn't even use vendors or their bank as it was all super delayed/lagging.
---
Can you explain how you are using 34 skills, when there are like only 12 you need in the open world and about 6 in raids? xD just wondering.
---
PvE as Resto and PvP as Ele?
---
Yeah that‚Äôs a shame and a huge difference from vanilla.  My brother rolled a dwarf priest because he liked dwarves, only later did he even realize that fear ward would be helpful.
---
No we dont
---
Slutty Priests only want heal T3 Tanks instead of nice Rogues. smh
---
Thinking 10 push ups will change anything is just tragic. Its actually not better than 0. You probably have a bigget chance getting injured than getting benefits from those 10.
---
Sorry you're so fucking lazy that you feel the need to promote this bullshit instead of something helpful.
---
Roflmao I remember that trick üòÇüòÇüòÇ

I was more mundane and just did [Guild] [My friend]: hahaha I suck cocks

*Oh fuck Alliance*

-My shaman friend questing in STV
---
I'm a 60 Undead Mage on Faerlina. Majority of the time I'm trying to PvP in some way.
---
It's always a given to PvP.
---
&gt; This is current end game content and it is potentially on farm status
---
That's because the vanilla patch we're playing has had some heavy nerfs to MC and it was basically on farm status back then as well. It should be different when more patch appropriate content rolls out such as AQ40 and Naxx.
---
There's a little spark on your energy which I assume is the energy refresh rate, what ui gives you that?
---
Wasn‚Äôt even funny the first time
---
Actually happened to me yesterday, i went to winterspring via flight and it had to have taken over 20minutes because i was in flight my whole duration of the phone call.
---
I shouldn‚Äôt be here. I should be back in Stormwind feasting with Azeroth‚Äôs finest heroes. Yet you come to us for help unreciprocated. How dare you!
---
I mean any populated server you see a full org...
---
The chest can contain zero rare items at worst. It's nowhere nearly as good as on private servers.
---
Never heard of that server
---
I don‚Äôt know the exact numbers but basically spell hit is reduced chance to resist, Raid bosses are lvl 63 and the chance of your abilities being resisted is increased for each level above your target is from you. In this case 3 levels.
---
You must be one of those very few hunters with triple digit IQs
---
As alliance, I have also noticed that gnomes seems to be the ones most eager to attack hordes on sight. My own  anecdotal statistics for horde goes like this:
---
Undead (Always, no matter the situation) &gt;&gt; Orc (Very often) &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Tauren (Only druids though, cats attack, no other classes) &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Troll (Never)
---
Fuck china thats what
---
I hit 60 on my priest and respecced to a true healing build and am having strong thoughts about just saying fuck it and going shadow because killing things is miserable.
---
No way, this would make spec choice largely irrelevant. And I say this as a resto shaman who can't do anything efficiently without a group.
---
If you want to fix the sometimes shit gameplay for solo healers and tanks, give us something else that doesn't turn us into dps like give us a pet that only works ungrouped and does decent (not dps like) damage but requires tanking or healing to do its job.
---
I don't know much about pvp, maybe a dual talent tree, one for pve and one for pvp would work.
---
Yes, to setup it takes a little longer.
---
Basically you determine points for being on time, staying the whole raid, wipes on bosses etc. You can make it as easy or complex as you feel. Personally I had on time, full consumes (during progress and early farm), being available the whole raid night (if on reserve) and a few performance checks (deducting points for causing wipes or major time loss, keep in mind this was a world top 50 guild).
---
I used google docs online so everyone could double check (manually compared to our addons). To make it easier with the now +40 man large guilds (compared to my 24 man guild) I would try to make sure I used automated EP/GP tracking. This should be available with addons even in classic. What it does is check for the consumes you have listed, if people were in raid on time and so on and automatically the set amount of points for each thing.
---
If no such addon is available in classic I'd recommend putting the officers on this chore while raiding so that the raid leader can focus on leading the raid. The officers can at least use buffwatch addons available in classic to help on certain fronts.
---
I love charging into a multi boxer, intim shouting them and watching the Multiboxer scramble to get everyone back in position, killing the one he is controlling, waiting to see which one he has to fumble to switch to, killing that one and repeat.
---
It‚Äôs not dead at all.
---
There are two spawns from what i've observed however they're pretty rare and one I can't get due to a death lash protecting it. If you pause exactly at 5:43, there's a little root spawn there and a book will spawn right next to it. If you can kill the death lashers, the second book is after the pack at 7:49 by the most south-western death lash.
---
I never played pserver and remember lasher farm being like 10 times the profit it is now and the lashers are way harder to kill (back in the day I lvled there form 58 to 60, now my mc equipped lvl 60 has serious trouble doing it) and the aggro range increase on the trees kills the far east entrance so you lose 2 groups per run
---
We used to do this back when we raided on private servers, due to the aggro ranges seeming stupidly large in some cases (The trees in DM East are bad, but the Huntress/Bear is asinine with like 50 yards aggro range) we didn't bother as soulstone was down and it was getting late.
---
But yes, theoretically you can get pass the guard by hiding in the corner and have a rogue/hunter pull him, run like hell and then vanish/FD.
---
There's also the slightly messier version of person pulls the boss, runs like hell, you run past, person dies in ress range and you keep going.
---
Found mine on the twitch client

&gt; **All of us** got scammed like this at some point in Diablo 2.

Speak for yourself, I've always known that being asked to submit your information through unofficial channels is bogus.

I'm soul link + aff warlock, currently level 50.
---
With Succubus out I immo + corr + agony 5-6 mobs at the same time, then some wanding, then bandage and life tap to full.
---
Drain tanking is another option, link was shared here earlier.
---
I get that problem, but I'd rather have a solution that doesn't change what I am.
---
Sometimes it's important to recognize what you're dealing with. You are not dealing with a single word he is saying, you are dealing with a person that is upset and looking for an outlet. There is no point attempting conversation because there is none in the first place. Everything you are blamed for here is out of your control yet you are held accountable for all of it.
---
This is just what i've been told. My friends say its just not in the tooltip.
---
fucking stormwind doesnt even have an innkeeper that sells meat. Have to literally go to IF to feed my pet.

It happened in my company the other day, it was an email saying I'd been added to a Teams group... I had no reason to think it was phishing except for the fact it was sent to the entire company. And there's no real reason to add hundreds of people to a single group. Anyway, I had stuff to do and just ignored it. But, as expected, the next day we got an email from tech support asking us to ignore the email and for anyone who was fooled to contact tech support to fix the issue...
---
Elitists in classic are the worst. Being an elitist in a game where none of it really matters. I mean min-maxing buffs etc. for fast raid clears or parses whatever for fun, ok I get it, but none of it really matters. Could have cleared the raid in the time it took to buff the whole raid with world buffs, not really talking about time saving here. 
---
BiS list is just something to grind for, to have a goal. Don't be a toxic shit to other people in your group. Nobody cares about  if item X is your BiS or not. People need on gear if its an upgrade. Guild group is different sure. I will need on every single upgrade, unless there is a person in the group who the drop is best in slot for.
---
Reenactment you say
---
Until you realize that the sound is only heard by your party.
---
I leveled enchanting until skill 98 when I realized it was way too expensive. I‚Äôve been leveling tailoring tho. Also been leveling fishing and cooking but that should be a plus because I can sell fish for a tiny bit more to vendor if I cook it first xD 2 c vs 4 c. Ka-Ching! Haha good luck with your gold farm! You are so close ;)
---
Put consumables that you wouldn't normally keybind, it's better than clicking them.  
---
I use  
---
1 - Feint (hard to reach for me, really situational spell)  
---
Shift+1 - Slice &amp; Dice (not yet using it in rotation, might move)  
---
2 - Gouge (easiest to press while strafing)  
---
Shift+2 - Rupture ( situational )  
---
3 - Backstab (uncomfortable keybind, things that I don't use that much)  
---
Shift+3 - Expose Armor (even more situational)  
---
4 - SS ( easiest keybind to spam )  
---
Shift+4 - Kidney  
---
5 - Riposte  
---
Q - Evasion  
---
E - Nothing yet  
---
Shift+E - Bandage  
---
Ctrl+E - HP Potion  
---
R - Stealth if not in combat, Cheap shot if in Stealth, Eviscerate if in combat and out of stealth  
---
Shift+R - Vanish
---
T - Sprint  
---
Y - Perception  
---
F - Nothing yet
---
Shift+F - Distract  
---
Mousewheel Down - !Stealth (good for spamming when waiting for combat to drop)
---
Mousewheel Up - Tag/target macro ( good for spamming on contested mobs )
---
Elvui
---
Dragons Call Horde: Just hit 20 with 2 chars, but the community is really nice this far

It will probably go up to 40..50 but in private servers it has occasionally been sold for 100+.
---
Not sure about 270.  
---
IIRC it's only 180 degree, maybe even less. As I cat I have attack that only work from behind, and it's never worked from "front side".
---
4 mages and watch the chaos unfold.
---
Thanks for your response! This is what I was afraid of. Shadow at 60, I assume, means you can solo and PVP far easier, but wouldn't get invited to 60 dungeons/raids?
---
Dual spec
---
And none are animated for furbolg model :|
---
I‚Äôve been playing primarily kitty and tanning when needed - I have spent so much time in Gnomer farming those damn things. I don‚Äôt know who thought three charges was a good idea.
---
Earthfury isn‚Äôt a dead realm, it‚Äôs a dad realm. It‚Äôs only regarded dead by those who don‚Äôt play on it.
---
They were dead during Legion because guess what, Dalaran was the place to be. Now in BFA its back to SW/Org.
---
Are Warriors really the premier DPS class? I guess I'm not super familiar with classic classes because I always thought arms/fury warriors were kind of a meme.
---
11/0/40
---
Depends on level. 
---
Pre40 with voidwalker i would avoid immolate and shadowbolt because you will get threat at 50% mob health and not 100%. Just corruption, CoA, wand and Drain Life. Shadow bolt with nightfall if you need it.
---
Post 40 with succubus (as Mana battery) I usually go Immolate-&gt;CoA-&gt;Corruption-&gt;Drain Life/wand (depends on Mana and health). Nightall procc depends on the mob health and your mana situation. No need to cast a shadowbolt while the mob has 300hp and dots rolling.
---
And when before the next mob dark pact the succubus/life tap and start over.
---
Uh no? U clearly didn't play in Vanilla
---
Asking the camped to remain while knowing they will continue to be camped is a little heartless, don't you think?
---
Playing good dps isnt easier, but you can get away with playing bad more than the tank. Also you can half-AFK dungeons, no need to concentrate on Trash or bosses
---
Chaotic neutral.
---
Harder to kill boss with 4 mages
---
Yeah definitely, strafe is A and D.  I think it's critical to strafe on a rogue. I turn with the mouse
---
Blizzard has more than a decade of experience with what transfers do to servers. This is not a hindsight issue. They know what happens and they are stupid
---
Or right click on the chat window tab and in the options, you can add the channel (and give it a unique color).
---
1. SS 2. Slice and Dice 3. Evis 4. kick and i pretty much just click anything else as the situation warrants. yes i am a mouse clicker. its worked fine for 15 years and i have no plan of stopping.
---
Just an idea, should be able to quest fine as a healer. Depending how you leveled, you could quest for your gold income? 
---
I'm a mage and haven't quested from 50+ I'm saving it for P2 when I can be PvP spec
---
Don't think spells can miss at all in retail. Partially resisted because of resistances, but that's it. And yeah, in vanilla a resist is really just a miss. Partial resists are caused by resistances and in the combat log will show up as (Resisted : 118). Not sure if resistances can be so high that they'll cause a full resist.
---
Why are you checking if a different player who isn't the spammer is offline?
---
big old papa bear telling a story huh
---
Well if you had soulstone you could just run past and wipe :D
---
Disapointed that the RPPVP transfer options are PVP servers and not the RP server...
---
See...this isn't what I was referring to
---
Idk I had downloaded it day of this video, in the tutorials i just set it to rogue, and that's an energy tick rate not a swing timer if referring to that sparkle
---
Here's a post I made in the question thread about this yesterday, and there were some helpful replies addressing that :)
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dimukd/what_should_i_play_wednesdays_october_16_2019/f3xikbl/
---
Yes! I killed it 4 times alone in ~25 minutes for that sweet MCP.
---
Bring emergency mana pot and health pot just in case.
---
Ask for Priest and Mage buff before leaving for the dungeon and it'll be easy.
---
If someone would let me have briarwood reed pay 50g and pass on all other items, i would do it
---
Because it adds more damage than the usual amounts of attack power/agi/etc you see on gear.
---
Windfury Totem
---
I'm so glad I switched to Horde
---
But I do miss dwarves
---
What we're saying is, if you respecced to pure heal builds, soloing / doing quests is going to be very difficult as you're geared towards healing others not damaging mobs for quests?
---
I think rogues get some of their energy back. Maybe 80% of it. But for finishers, they get 0. There might be a talent that refunds energy on finishers if they miss/parry/dodge.
---
Yup, you need to set new goals
---
For water dispensers lmao. I named my mage Fastfood because I knew I was going to be giving out water and food 24/7
---
I don't understand your initial question then.
---
Yup and its accurate as hell, takes you step by step and auto changes to the next step once one was completed
---
I got on a FP yesterday that was like one inch away on the world map. Took 15 minutes.
---
Free transfers pushed Alliance off servers that were horde dominated and made faction balance worse. Skeram being the example I know personally (aside from all the evidence since vanilla first got transfers)
---
Holy shit, I used to troll friends in raid chat all the time like that and completely forgot too
---
Meanwhile my lvl 47 hunter still trains for the Azeroth marathon. ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Yeah and remind me how if players wanted to enforce faction balance, how would they?
---
Asmongold doesn't even run the server though, there's a handful of people from his guild, other than that there's 1 neckbeard alliance guild and 1 neckbeard horde guild that practically runs the server. In classic WoW, it's quality over quantity. 10 sappers is enough to oneshot any amount of players in PvP. His raid's DPS now, almost 2 months into the game is lower than what the pserver guilds did on week 2. I wouldn't be worried at all about it being a "streamer server".
---
I haven't tried boosting with warlock, although i do imagine they would be pretty good at it with enough aoe, maybe even dots do enough dmg at lower dungeons (RFC, WC) to just run around dotting everything.
---
I've done it with warrior main that was 45 lvl, just cleaving through the dungeon, but you can do it faster with bigger pulls and aoe.
---
probalbly running around, dotting mobs to pull them and then just throwing rain of fire if necessary, or even hellfire.
---
Never have problems holding threat as a Paladin. Mark 1 or 2 for priority, run in consecrate, let them hit you with ret aura up, consecrate again. Congrats you now have solid aggro. Blessing of salv the dps and you'll never have an issue. Paladin tanks are the superior dungeon tank (sorry Horde) because of our ability to hold threat on multiple targets with ease. Taunting is not necessary in dungeons.
---
Netherwind was dman near 50-50 last time i checked and thats where i play sooo...
---
aren't difficult for who? The healer? The tank? I'd love to see all your flawless runs.
---
The verb refers to the subject which in this case is 500 - plural, and so require weren't. Now if he said "the first batch of 500" then it would refer to "batch", and be singular, and wasn't would work.
---
Warrior is one of the most brutal classes to level. Especially at low level. You could try another class maybe. Hunter is nice and easy like a mage. Druid is rather fast as well. Same goes for Warlocks. So I would advise Rogue. Since that is a very interesting class. That is not as brutal to level as a Warrior. But still considerably different then a mage.
---
I literally said that in my comment.
---
I don't have an issue with him using a ring with those stats etc. It's the fact he's wearing it and didn't sell it.
---
Why is everyone over analyzing EVERYTHING I say lol. It's simple man - almost nobody was OK with a class taking a piece that isn't their armor type. Fury wars with leather, even hunters with leather. If the majority back then would bitch about it (and they would), what's the point of arguing that some people still did it? This seems pointless
---
A hearty laugh, old-timey-style
---
The only difference is a vanilla server had a steady influx of new players populating every zone in the world.
---
The problem with classic servers is you going to have all the players bunched up in a select few zones. Making the rest of the world dead.
---
Yea I dont even play retail anymore because it sucks so much but Org on Zuljin has never not looked like this.  Literally from Vanilla till today it's been packed.
---
Undead cleavage.....
---
I haven't used it to create groups, but for finding groups, it basically works like a chat filter. You can select one or multiple dungeons to look for and if it sees someone mentioning it in chat, it puts it in a list (and pops up a notification if you want).
---
It doesn't automatically invite everyone in a group, talent sharing is very limited and can be turned off entirely etc. The mod author is apparently very aware of the downsides a too powerful addon could have.
---
Onyxia buff is the one buff that guilds actually make sure to get, because it's very easy to get it and it's incredibly strong. Casuals Will probably skip all the other buffs though.
---

Give that a go. It is decent.

I have learned that macro's make the druid. To be a good druid, you really need to utilize shape shifting, doing things in and out of different forms. This is even true for tanking, yes you will shift out of bear form while tanking, not often, and ironically, this will happen more in those o shit moments. I have even Off healed as tank in those o shit moments when a runner or dps gets feared into another pack and ends up tripple pulling. 
---
Macro all those shape shifting things up and put em on your bars.
---
Lmfao god damn u just shit on this mans life üòÇ
---
I save up all my turn ins across the map (low xp go here type quests) and then when survivor comes on, I watch it while I fly to all the places to turn them in. I can easily get half a level if I save up 5 or so boring turn ins. Especially hinterlands to undercity to org to tenaris to fellwood.... stupid cleansing water quests...
---
Hunters have tranquilizing shot so raids will always bring some hunters
---
I am leaning towards 4/5 Lethality because of the direct output and 2/3 Ruthlessness because it can add some extra flow. Also feels better in dungeons. I really havent been sold on Murder tbh. Thanks tho.
---
All of this, hunters should never use any weapon that doesn‚Äôt have stats on it, proc weapons are almost completely useless for a hunter
---
I was choosing between warrior and priest and went priest a raid has 2-3 tanks (usually affiliated with the guild running the raid) but has like 10 healers.
---
My head canon:
---
The gryphons know how to fly to specific flight points if you signal them with a certain item or scent. Encountering a new flight master teaches you how to signal gryphons from neighboring zones how to fly there.
---
Like in this case, the gryphons in Astranaar don't know how to reach Ratchet but they know how to reach Azshara if you can give them the signal for it. But since you don't know the signal, you have to fly to Auberdine, where the Gryphons know how to fly to Theramore, and the gryphons in Theramore know how to fly to Ratchet.
---
Thats how I picture it at least.
---
It's true I was the moron
---
Truth be told I was 12 and new to the scene
---
I feel you on the warrior thing. I don‚Äôt have hours a day to play, but I got my first character (warrior) to ~29 and just couldn‚Äôt do it anymore so rerolled a mage. It‚Äôs way easier but running dungeons is pretty boring. I miss tanking so I‚Äôm not sure what to do at this point.
---
If you're horde try shaman, combination of being able to use hammer and shield with spells too is so much fun. Definitely glad I picked it as my first one to level.
---
This is great! AND you CAN draw. It looks nice you just need to practice but the fundation is there. Keep on going!
---
Assuming I'm listening

I developed a good havit of checking dates before commenting, and it's hard to sometimes NOT comment.

I moved from stalagg to heartseeker and it was a great move that I genuinely couldn't be happier with. I'm an off hours player and would consistently find myself unable to get groups for dungeons or a raid guild that fit my schedule. Heartseeker has way more players on alliance side, so now I can get groups and even found a morning raiding guild! I'm excited about it, even if phase 2 pvp is going to be pretty lame.
---

True. A good DPS can make things a lot smoother.
---
It wasn‚Äôt atlasloot directly telling you. It was if you used atlasloot to ping the server to retrieve item data. If atlasloot could not retrieve item data for the left glaive, you would get disconnected. If atlasloot could retrieve item data for the left glaive, that means that atlasloot could retrieve the data from somewhere - it would retrieve it from Illidan‚Äôs loot table for that particular lockout.
---
At the start of Cata WoW had around 10M subs it only started dropping after
---
You just ask the rogue trainer each time you visit if you are lost for places to find them they are easy to spot if send to the correct spot
---
Technically speaking, I don't think "diminishing returns" is an appropriate term for linear scaling. Every point of crit adds the same amount of DPS (until soft cap, and ignoring talents like frenzy). Diminishing returns is when you have a mechanic that artificially dampens the resulting amount when you have too much of it.
---
Tip, unbind backpaddle from S, and put something useful there unstead. I use it with all modifiers (shift, ctrl and alt)
---
Ahh. A *good* rogue.
---
Idk what you're talking about, warriors can be fucking brutal after 30. I've had more than 1 occasion multiple people trying to jump me and I can get 1 if not both of them.
---
What? You got a source on the cross realm battleground?

Don't they make it so you fly around every near path in case you have to cancel it via that one button that I don't remember what it's called.

I think you'd be surprised. My 28 year old sister, a manager at a major multinational aerospace company, called me in tears last month because a scammer called her on the phone, said her bank account was compromised and asked her to transfer her savings to an account number that they gave her... and she just did it.

Just because people are sheeps and downvote something thats reasonable or because they can't be bothered reading all of it doesn't say shit either.

I'm moving to Earthfury as well
---
What am i looking at?
---
I honestly never see gold spam in chat
---
Nah once you get a feel for tanking in general you'll be fine. Don't be afraid to ask if you don't know the way, most people are chill.
---
Must be ally on gandling. I made 300g on mining this weekend. 
---
Another 200g leveling 1-40 by skinning and some mining at the end. Thick and rugged leather sells. Everything above iron sells. Even the stones sell for a quite a bit.
---
But i think gandling is kinda horde heavy. Atleast from my experience.
---
I think it's because of how quickly raiding guilds formed.  My friend wanted to be a prot warrior, but our guild made him repsec to DPS is he wanted to raid.  Sure he can still sword and board and tank a little, but when he is LFG now, it is as DPS so he can gear up.
---
I did enjoy this
---
Elaborate Haiku poem
---
I am bad at math
---
As a mage, one of my fav things to do is find mages aoe farming and sheep the mage, CS the blizzard for guaranteed death
---
Just take it easy, in few months , battlegrounds will be available and the game will start to be quite fun again .
---
You vs. The Priest he told you not to worry about.
---
Extended character stats
---
#nochanges so blizz won't add quality of life stuff like this.
---
Just pick mage you plebs
---
still enjoying the leveling. i know endgame will not be my thing, but leveling is so awesome
---
Pretty much like always for me, same as when I played Legion, same as when I played on dozens of private servers, but with less anal spam.
---
For melee you see it, when you hower your mouse at the melee in the spellbook
---
Not sure to love or hate him
---
You‚Äôre right man. I‚Äôll just stop brushing my teeth and drinking the chlorinated water and see things with my third eye like you.
---
&gt;For every 200 savvy people there is 1 moron who will fall for it.
---
You are very optimistic about that ratio.
---
&gt; And another guy whispered me calling me every name because I didn't heal him while he was being ganked by a rouge, because as a priest I should throw everything else to the side to heal someone twenty odd levels above me. 
---
I absolutly love when people keep farming while Im being ganked by a rouge. Is it so hard to help?
---
Shamans can go 30/0/21 in earlier raid tiers which is pretty good or even kill things in Resto spec as they have access to a decent amount of SP gear, but the latter is still quite miserable.
---
Priests can also just wear SP gear and Wand/Smite things to death. I‚Äôve seen people doing it, it‚Äôs alright.
---
Haven‚Äôt played a Druid at all, so can‚Äôt comment on them.
---
Killing things is already miserably slow as a Ret Paladin, as Holy it mainly depends on your secondary talent tree. You can get talents in the Ret tree and kill things even more slowly with a 2h, or go Holy/Prot for absolutely terrible damage capability.
---
That‚Äôs what I did, 31/20/0 Paladin, and I have no regrets other than the inability to gank Horde as well as during leveling. But at least most of them won‚Äôt even bother doing the same to me. There are only a few quests at 60 where you need to kill things solo, and I can make money by Mining and selling everything on the AH. The only thing I have to kill is the occassional mob standing on a node.
---
YOU BREAK MY IMMERSION
---
That's really encouraging, thanks! Now did I make a mistake picking Troll as a warrior?? I am level 12 so not too late to change....
---
I just ask party member to show me the way. If I mess a pull up, that group of mobs will stick in my mind.
---
The build you posted would be better. Premed builds are more fear dependent because you lose the extra damage added by the assass talents. The hit you need should come from the pre-bis gear. 
---
As far as keybinds (which is what I think you‚Äôre asking about bars), you want it to place your highly spammed abilities on keys you find comfortable to push easily. There should be about 5 or so of these that you can then add a shift or alt modifier to to stretch that number to 15 easily spammable keys. Less used abilities need to be somewhere that you can reach easily but not fat finger. It sucks fat fingering prep. Most importantly is to make your setup then realize it‚Äôs going to take time playing to get it second nature to push. Don‚Äôt let that frustrate you into reverting back. Stick it out. You‚Äôll get there.
---
They could just make decimal numbers if level scaling wasn't a concern. Many games do that, there's no reason to limit items to whole numbers only.
---
" Or can you most likely wing it with a decent group? "
---
This is the fundamental problem.
---
With a decent group, you can do anything.
---
Without it, the mage is narky the autoshotting huntard broke his sheep, and the boomkin doesnt want to heal. Meanwhile, the retard rogue keeps trying to maximise his combo points on an elite.
---
He stood on top of the stairs and tab targetted then sent his pet in without looking. So he aggroed everything downstairs üòã
---
As an RPer myself, this guy is completely nuts. You don't need to be in character 24/7 even on an RP realm. And using /bow is barely RP lmao.
---
This is a good idea. I went from super easy to brutal might be a better idea to ease my way into a warrior
---
yes
---
The key was in his explanation of the buffs. Just using a few off the top of my head for a feral druid, DM: 200 AP, Mongoose 25AP (and bonus crit, well ignore the crit for now), Firewater, 35 AP, Str Pot 50 AP, Squid 10AP, Ony Buff 140 AP..., MOTW 10‚Ä∞ Stats, etc., 
---
And right now. I'm running around unbuffed IVO 1000power.  Let's call it 1600 fully buffed. So without any hit, let's say the gear choice is 9‚Ä∞ hit over 5 pieces of gear for an extra 15AP in lieu of the hit. You can either take 9% of the 1600 AP and turn it to 0 damage, but add 75 overall power to those hits...ot ignore the 75 net AP gain, and do the 1600 every time. Similarly with crits, that's an opportunity to turn 1600 power into an effective 3200 power 1% of the time. Fully raid buffed, my feral is probably at 30% crit chance.
---
Tnx and you know if it shows the percent for each skill?
---
Go holy but take the damage talents, smite dmg and holy nova n shit. Now u can heal and dps fine.
---
Skullflame used to be horde heavy but now it‚Äôs not as bad, is actually a very chill realm alliance side
---
stonetalon and ashenvale are not substitutes for early barrens. And once you hit the 20's you'll be traveling a lot between these three zones.
---
My warrior levels only in dungeons on rested exp, so maybe you could do that? Let it gain rested in a city while you play other characters, then hop on and tank until you run out of rested.
---
Plenty of classes around that can tank, except that very few want to bother.
---
Tanking for a PuG is a nightmare. It's only on very rare occassions that a run goes smooth as butter (As in, DPS doesn't start going full-blast 0.1ms after I pull, healer doesnt cast pre-heals for some reason, DPS attacks whatever I give the skull-tag, et cetera).
---
Other than that, while there's ALWAYS demand for tanks in dungeons groups, there's comparatively few for raids.
---
Most groups assume that the tank knows the place, but being realistic, that's not always the case. As a healer, I've checked up some full clear runs just to get an idea of the flow or layout of some dungeons, because some I just remember in a most fragmentary fashion. One boss here, one drop there, one dangerous mechanic here. Good to get a refreshing course before, and perfect to check up on a commute or while getting some food. 
---
If you're unsure of how to navigate or execute a certain dungeon, just be upfront about it and more often than not someone will have done it or at least remember it more clearly than you and with any luck they're happy to lead/point in the right direction. If not, you are all equally lost - then you'll just have to move at a slower pace and perhaps look some stuff up from wowhead (there are guides for all dungeons IIRC) now and then. But better to come a bit prepared, IMO.
---
Thanks, hopefully I get nice party members like you and Senzafane above!
---
They know they'll get free upvotes.
---
He's #1 of the b-tier.

Same. I kept strafe where it is, but did Stealth A and Kick D. I'm gonna give the rest of your bindings a try tho
---
It does not show the skills but the general spell crit %
---
Toxic language and hostile. Nice combo.

I didn't cry I simply said it isn't fighting which it isn't. Then you made a really stupid comparison.

Guess you didn't see the part of the video where he showed how to kill the mobs as a mage? Didn't realize every class had those abilities.

I was commenting on the mage only part shithead.

So IF there's room for a lot of Hordes on Westfall that solves an nth of the problem.

Quest is also sharable. To kill water elemental.

Maybe you can sell it? :)

Maximum efficiency
---
Hi!
---
Currently started to level warrior and priest with a friend. We will stick together for all leveling progress. 
---
Anyone has experience and/or tips how to progress as fast as possible?
---
Like, what are the best specs for both classes. Should we respec at some point.
---
Best leveling via dungeons or quests and so on.
---
There is another.
---
Mined last night and this morning and nothings changed
---
No clue what you are talking about
---
Don't forget about Cooking too. Cooked reagents get 2x vendor value.
---
I mean max HP as in the actual max that the game is able to handle. Some things are limited due to purely gameplay reasons, such as party size or max levels and similar. Most other things that aren't clearly visible to the end user will be limited by the size of the value stored in memory on the server. That's why some things have a hard cap that can't easily be increased.  There is a maximum level reachable by the player that's limited by game design. There's a max amount of armor one can have that's limited by the bit allotment (in theory) or the items available for the player (in practice, by game design).
---
I mean, they could store the value of "in combat" as a 32bit value, but it's pretty pointless when it can only be true or false, so 1 bit is sufficient. The other 31 bits are just wasted memory that will put load on the server without good reason.
---

---
Wohoo let's transfer to a dead realm! I want to wait 1 hr for strath groups and notnsee anyone whilst leveling alts!
---
Don't worry. Rogues were just as hated in vanilla. Don't let it get to you
---
Yeah I feel you. Proper feral loot is hard to come by, but luckily not much competition (if you're a feral tank, that is). Ain't much point in getting mad at people, though. The priest that rolled need on the carapace was obviously completely new to the game and didn't know what he was doing. It sucked in the moment, but not much you can do about it anyway. He learned his lesson.
---
I've never gotten an emote return, wave/hello etc, in the open world by my own faction or opposing. 
---
I've never actually whispered someone over it though.
---
If your that fucking special you getting conned in wow your deserve it. Is the bar that low here. I bet you click the big download buttons dont you.
---
Druid might be a good class to try:
---
1. It covers the roles you can't do on your mage (Tank, Healer)
---
2. You get Feline Swiftness at level 20/21, and travel form at 30. Mitigating the frustration of not having Epic mount somewhat.
---
And Demonic/Dark Runes can Crit damage you.
---
I think that's an entirely different scenario than being whispered to ask if you're botting. If you're AFK, they'll just kick you from that if you fail to respond.
---
Druid?
---
To quote both the vending machines and the taxis: "REEEEEEE!!!!!!!"
---
The investment is $15/month
---
I think you want to focus on dungeons past 30. If you were to stick with quests you'd want priest to go shadow past 40 since it does considerably more damage, but that would mean no more healing for warrior.
---
So I suppose holy for priest, and arms for warrior.
---
It cannot proc itself in classic iirc
---
I don't see the issue here. They're not doing a Strat Live run, they're selling you an item. You should literally be able to afk through the whole instance without contributing anything since you're the costumer.
---
Dude that's risky not putting your phone in flight mode while flying
---
Which class btw?
---
i think theres a bigger chance hes closer to 30 tbh
---
I wish alliance had a 2nd flight path in STV... :(
---
Sales is fucking stupid. It's a bunch of adults that are dumber than high school children. 80% of your org passes the internal phishing test. Sales has like a 55% pass rating. They are a group of adults who have been working with computers for decades and still haven't learned how the fucking TV in the conference room works or which cable is an HDMI.

Damn I loved Shimmering Flats. It's like 8 grindy quests all overlapping in a small area, I banged it out in a night and made a ton of money from the junk.
---
i signed up for a dire maul run and ended up with 4 people from the same guild. pretty soon one of them dinged the map and ran over to loot a dusty tome. all i could think was that if a foror's dropped, they would all roll need "for the guild's tank." there was nothing in the tome but it really soured me on the idea of pugging dire maul, so i think i'm gonna run everything else and wait for my guild to catch up to me.

To give you a little info to save for later, ferals have hotw spec. A relatively deep feral spec made for bear/heals that manages fantastic damage solo (for a healer) at 60

Nice screenshot!

That's not how it works. It does not scale, it is summed and then applied.

I've noticed a similar trend.

Why are you just spamming Sinister? Rogue rotation is fun if you play it proper.

---
Well after so many alliance chickened out and transferred, either due to false rumors of dramatic server imbalance or actually getting beaten down one too many times... it seems to me at this point we only have one option: Continue the beatings until there are so few alliance left that Blizzard is forced to merge the server with an Alliance heavy one.

Does anyone know why sometimes when I log in all my character specific macros on my action bars are showing the big question mark? To get rid of the question mark I have to re-save each of them in the macro section of the menu.
---
Each macro does have the question mark as its macro icon when I created the macro but each one also has a "#showtooltip abilityname" at start of the macro for it to show the ability icon I want. Wondering if it is something with that, that sometimes when I log in it for some reason didn't load the showtooltip stuff for some reason.
---
I asked in world chat and the only person to respond said to not close the game with an alt+f4 but I don't ever close the game that way so not that. I close the game by pushing escape then choosing to exit game.
---
It's even better when you go Beserk as a Troll.  STABSTABSTABSTABSTABSTAB!!!!
---
The Priest should not shield the warrior except in oh-fuck moments as early game taking damage is a large source of rage generation.
---
Ensure the Warrior can resist the urge to execute everything, and the priest should last hit everything to maximise the uptime of Spirit Tap.
---
Yeah this is crazy......I mean if it was my mate of 10 years I probably would, but someone I only met a few months ago.....nope!!

Reminds me of the dwarves in the hobbit, in beorns hall
---
I Always go for the ugliest design possible. Once I got a whisper commenting how ugly my female dwarf was. I felt extremely proud at the moment.
---
Im not proud of this. But when i was lil shit 14 year old back in TBC i used to send phising emails to people offering to sell/trade accounts on a local trade website. The mail basically said blizzard got news that they tried to sell the account and to prove its the real owner by providing accounname, password, secret question etc. Most people fell for it, since they actually tried selling their account.
---
I usually just changed email/PW then vendored their gear, and opened a ticket from their account that they tried selling it, with a link to the marketplace.
---
Back then i felt really good about doing the "right thing", but looking back i was just a major asshole.
---
Getting some bang for your buck...
---
It seems paltry until you consider how much of other stats you would need to equal that percent increase, and then realize that some of those can't be increased (like weapon skill, which has a hard cap even with your racial bonus, and barring a very few items with +skill), or Int / Agi, which only give as I recall 0.04% increase to crit per point. So that 1% crit is equal to 25 Agi or Int on that same piece, and many pieces that have those 1% stats also have other significant stats or bonuses. Also it seems like little on its own, but when you get to the point of assembling your min/max gear set all those 1% pieces add up when you put them together.
---
I did exactly that and here are some takeaways from our leveling. If you plan on leveling together all the way (which sounds unlikely, but let's assume you pull it off) the best specs are: whatever you like will work.
---
min max: You go Arms with some residual points in Fury. Priest goes for a hybrid spec.
---
Here are some tips to speed you on the way:
---
* Try to run as many dungeons as possible. Do each dungeon \~3 times.
---
* Let the Priest have the killing blow on all mobs because Spirit Tap. That is a bit hard to pull off, but keep it in mind.
---
* Don't waste rage on execute (also killing blows, see above), except when its the last mob of a quest.
---
* Pull 2-3 mobs at a time always.
---
* Priest focuses on healing, dotting and lots of wanding. Occsassionally use of mana burn or silence to counter caster enemies.
---
* Warrior focusses on charging things and keeping adds off the Priest. Make very liberal use of cooldowns.
---
* Priest should use direct heal spells over hots and wand/Mind Flay over Mind Blast to conserve mana &amp; manage aggro.
---
* Warrior: even thou you have a healer, make liberal use of food, bandages and heal pots. Trade all your drinks and mana pots to the Priest.
---
* Priest: trade all your food and heal pots to the warrior.
---
* Once you both hit level 40, the real party begins and you can just blast through anything everywhere. After 40: don't be afraid to change to FFA loot and split up if an area is crowded or mobs spread apart.
---

I get that sometimes yeah, but they always manage to fix themselves after a while. I've never timed how lang that while takes but never so long that it gets annoying. Do yours stay like that?

Still 300 armour though.
---
Flight path bad
---
I encountered this like 4 threads ago, but the opposite. If you're downvoted you're wrong.
---
Thanks for the laugh.
---
You're totally right lol. The downvoters need to track their spending
---
it's decent melee dps in low dungeons after wolfshead helm as well.
---
but I would recommend what you said: spec 0/30/21 and fun effectively healing/tanking with only a gear swap
---
Sadly, the ratio is probably more than 1:200, but yes, the statement stands.
---
Are you ok?
---
m o r a l l y g r e y
---
Sth simiar happened to me in regards to a quest. 
---
It was that part of the missing Varian questchain where you help a gnome ambush someone in Stormwind Keep. It was full, so people were grouping - however, probably due to how it was cripted, idk, only one person could turn in the quest at a time, which some didn't know and I was unsure about. 
---
So I grouped with someone, and then I couldn't turn in. Then I got invited to a another group. I told them that grouping doesn't work, they told me otherwise, and I just wen't along with it. 
---
After we killed the guy, it tried turning in, and realized to my surprise that it worked. Believing that it was indeed a sharable q, I considered it done, thanked them and went omw. But apparently, I was just the only one out of that group who managed to turn in. 
---
And then I got the very same guy who told me it was shareable messaging me saying that I suck and various other things for abandoning them. 
---
I didn't even realize what he meant, and tried to point out that I indeed was helping them. The insults continued, and then he blocked me. 
---
It happened almost 30 levels ago now, I am still confused, bewildered, and angry at that whole incident.
---
She's a beaut
---
Except it is also in Dire Maul NORTH
---
Ah..hahahaha haha.
---
Ill take it.  Early on in vanilla, I believe, you had to actually stop at each griffin master.
---
Roughly the same here just no second binding drop yet. I'm the tank. Our other tank had a bit more time to grind gear before our first raid in the second week so we let him MT and funneled some gear into him that dropped to make it easier for us, but when we killed Garr the Binding dropped and it went to me because i will take over the position anyways over time. (Also guild lead but it didn't went to me because i said so but because many in the guild said it multiple times that i should have it for building the guild up out of nothing 2 months prior to release) He's not mad tho we know each other for about 10 years now.
---
Not ever, really. It's a bad habbit IMO.
---
*Grounding Totem Purge Purge*
---
*Elemental Mastery Talisman of Ephemeral Power*
---
*FUCK YO FACE*
---
I really doubt faction changes would fix the problem. If you picked Ally or Horde, it usually for a reason, not a whim
---
I just downloaded a flight timer last night. Flew from Tanaris to Ashenvale, 17 minutes 50 seconds.
---
The only time I really felt the need to research dungeons or dungeon bosses was when they started introducing heroic dungeons in the first or 2nd expansion. 
---
Currently, outside of raids the worst that can happen is you might pull a few extra groups of mobs that are not needed to complete the dungeon (because u took a wrong turn) but it's all xp so who really cares. Anyone who complains that you pull 1 or 2 groups of non essential mobs are probably idiots that should be ignored anyway, it's usually kids that want to wtf-rush through everything.
---
Also warriors are very gear dependent but with you having that mage that‚Äôs good at farming gold you could send the warrior money to buy good weapons/gear/potions that will help a ton but will still be rough. My main is a 53 warrior and I took a break to level a rogue alt. That rogue is now 30. I tear through mobs and quest so fast compared to the warrior that I doubt I‚Äôll go back to it.
---
This ring dropped for me, I should have worn it instead of trying to sell it. Hardly goes for anything on the AH. I'm now 58 and it's not really useful for me anymore.
---
Plenty of people were afking and botting in battlegrounds back then, and it was really hard to get enough afk votes to kick someone from alterac valley. I'm not sure what my punishment would have been by the GM if i didn't get right back into the game after he messaged me, but maybe a 24 hour ban, i don't know. Maybe you are right and he would have just kicked me.
---
has to be a few min before the next stop, always works on longer trips.
---
Many years ago before the days of "warden", and before I realized how bad bots where for MMOs, I worked with a small team who developed one of the early bots. I specifically built a chat bot to respond to GMs!
---
Even after warden and the other detection methods, they would still come check on you to verify if they aren't 100% sure.
---
Blizzard just added this new feature called /tell 
---
It let's you message other players in game!
---
I actually liked that quest, I got good xp while grinding and then it eventually dropped
---
there shouldnt be many quests to do at 60 besides group quests and there you can be the healer so dont worry its fine as you always group anyway for dungeons and Holy AoE is fine for low lvl stuff
---
what the fuck are you talking about? this is exactly what i mean. i am making a post about your  (bad) experiences with other players. and answers like this are exactly what i mean. what am i making up?
---
Onto his tendies
---
I misremembered. Thanks.
---
Hmm I also noticed that you can zone into the instance after dying - i.e. if you turn right after entering BRM and jump off the bridge into the lava below, you will get ported into MC (assuming you're in raid) but if you happen to fall in the wrong spot you will also trigger a death - so you lose your buffs and item durability, but still appear in MC well alive.
---
Could you guys suggest a server for me? I'm looking for a PvE server on the US Eastern time. That narrows it down to *Windseeker*, *Mankirk*, *Westfall*, *Pagle*, and *Ashkandi* (off the top of my head, anyway)
---
I'm looking for a relaxed server with a decent faction balance (I'll mainly be playing alliance, with a horde alt or two) and I'm not looking to join a progression guild or work toward raiding, so I'm not picky there.
---
Just let me know if you're on one of those realms, and you like the community and feel like the faction balance is fairly even! 
---
I played a bit in Wrath and thereafter, but totally missed out on vanilla and TBC, so I'm excited to dip my toes in the game as it was originally! Thanks for your time \^_\^
---
&gt;I don't get why people like to say "Cities in BFA are dead" all the time :\
---
Because a lot of haters didn't even play the game and hate it just because of neophobia and because it's "cool" in vanilla community.
---
I always hate that.  People advertising to sell something, but refuse to give a price.  
---
Dude, YOU‚ÄôRE the one selling this shit.  You should have a price in mind.
---
Is questing faster as a warrior? If not, I would definitely prefer to grind dungeons.
---
On weapon skill :  
---
Does the level of the mob you hit matter to up your weapon skill ?
---
Can I get to 300 hitting mob lvl 10 for exemple while your lvl 59 for example?
---
Did you have more chance to get point if the mob is higher lvl ?
---
YSK: the "classic-wow" part of fandom is a direct copy of the normal wow wiki from circa cataclysm era, with some parts manually stripped out so you don't immediately notice that most of the pages refer to post-vanilla mechanics and gameplay. It survives solely on its name which ranks it high up on google.
---
Fandom is an infamously shit company that will do anything to farm ad money.
---
Thiis iis siily.
---
If they ever monetize respecs I'd uninstall immediately.
---
Tell that to Zod‚Äôs snapped neck.
---
How much?
---
It‚Äôs already possible to respec for gold so why would they sell it for real money?
---
That's to escape not win the fight..
---
biizzard are such commies omg
---
As /u/FabulouSnow said, it's a shaman weapon enhancement that gives you a 20% chance on hit, to instantly do 2 more weapon swings with + attack power (based on rank).
---
Yesterday I basically two-shot a level ?? lock, while I was level 43. Windfury activated on my frist swing, and some of the attacks critically hit. Then 3.8 seconds later, my second weapon swing activated windfury again, and the lock died.
---
It is a lot of fun, until all your attack miss/dodge/parry, and windfury never activates.
---
nova into blink :D why dont u use iceblock after it too?
---
Will I have issues tanking these at these levels? Can I tank in arms spec with a sword and shield?
---
After we got the data
---
Crusader
---
You can always level an easy class like hunt, lock or druid.
---
Do you think this still holds true?
---
I think, that now if you aren't level 60, you are screwed.  
---
I'm at level 33 and haven't been able to play the last few nights because of griefing. Not even my usual grinding spots are safe.  
---
I'm debating starting a new character on a PvE server, but also don't want to do that.
---
What level can I start MARA
---
"Not all heros get recognition."
---
I wonder what‚Äôs wrong with people 
---
Classic is already monetized in a way 
---
Retail doesn‚Äôt have an intrusive shop 
---
They have like character things and a couple mounts
---
It‚Äôs not gonna negatively affect you to kill a lowbie as a level 60 when honor comes out, that‚Äôs not gonna change.
---
yeah, faction really doesnt matter when it comes to stuff like this.
---
You could compare the list to the BIS Tracker interface addon. See if they differ anywhere.
---
Oh please, getting outnumbered trying to level 10-1 in every zone is not fun. As an Alliance player that moved from that steaming pile of shit server I could not be happier.
---
That's good too, for that raptor strike you weave in before your aimed shot autoshot. Yea, the one you have in your rotation.
---
What do you mean what do I mean?
---
In MC at least 5 warlocks is seen as a lot. Hardcore guilds will often cap at three because even in late game raid tiers, they only become just as good as mages because rolling ignites are so strong. Meanwhile anything not a tier piece they are competing with mages for it...
---
I'm top range dps as a warlock in my guild... for now... The power of warlock early in progression is managing mana pots, bandages, and health stones (plus other secondary potion cd items) to never go oom and keep casting in long fights. As gear progresses and our guild shortens these fights, I know I will be falling behind the mages. Up until they all run oom they are on pace with me in damage when they have a bit worse gear.
---
ü§êNo comment
---
um, yeah, u r correct :-) BUT! there r still ways to inc crit damage + more rage from crits for wars, so with some other investments its more then 1=1
---
Why would they ever do and why anyone buy it
---
What???
---
I started casually levelling a Paladin alt a few days ago because I got interested enough in Paladins as a utility/healing class to give one a shot. I then started doing more reading and it seems there's a lot of negativity about the class in general, so I'd like to ask a few questions:
---
1. People say they're shit DPS and levelling is painfully slow. I've only made it to Level 14 but so far I don't think it's slow and painful. There's almost no down time and I can deal with 2 or sometimes 3 mobs at a time. Does it slow way down later on or is this just a meme because Paladins aren't Hunters or Mages so they suck to level?
---
2. Doubting that I'll have the time to do any raiding on an alt at least initially (maybe guild alt runs in future who knows) can anyone recommend me a decent spec that's fun for PvP? Ideally with enough Holy that I can still heal 5-mans? (which so far to me seem to be very lenient on class spec, *needing* full-blooded Prot Tanks and Holy Healers seems to be a raid thing?). I know next to nothing about Paladins, I don't know which talents are good.
---
I can‚Äôt believe you didn‚Äôt even suck my dick madam after I saved you from that despicable man
---
West Story made it to WoW.
---
How could you not see, or hear, his hyelp!?
---
This guy knows!
---
Tiger to the mage who frost nova'ed: So, you have chosen... death.
---
As a warrior, go shaman. Shamans are amazing! They give windfury, heal, and can deal damage. Dungeons are best run by 3 warriors, and 2 Shamans. 
---
That being said druids can also do cool things like tank,  buff the party, run fast. Did I mention you can be a freaking seal?! That's amazing to be able to swim fast. Druids also do better pure tanking on lower levels, especially on multiple enemies. 
---
But as I said, go shaman. It's the best. Strong buffs and heals and interrupts (yea they help a lot) and strong quick combos in pvp
---
I don't get why anyone would be against Blizzard bringing DM early. It's just another dungeon.
---
They should put in a bg as well, like Warsong. Even without honor. Just so you can get some fun time in between the grind.
---
I use a 11/0/40 spec. In frost, i spec into imp blizz, imp nova, imp CoC, frostbite, shatter, etc. 
---
You can still aoe farm pretty decent (in before 'cant aoe farm with frostbite') and your single target is decent. 
---
You could spec out of frostbite, but its so good for dunegon running, as you can 50% small trash mobs with 1 frostnova / CoC
---
Mograine!
---
Fucking crumpets and that bear is always up to something in IF hahah
---
&gt;while you`re just spamming Blizzard and thinking "WOW IM SO GOOD AT THIS GAME".
---
sounds like you had a bad experience with a mage so you're expressing your anger here instead, just let it out it's all good. 
---
&gt;Even as early as SM Library, if you pull those shaolin monks too close to the healer - they'll interrupt heal cast and lock out the whole holy school for 10 seconds, which may result in a wipe. Scarlet diviners there cast manaburn on CD, and ill manaburn a heal if no other mana-users present. Manaburn is easily recognisable (it's the only shadow spell they channel) - but i've yet to see one rogue/mage trying to interrupt it. They`d rather wait while healer drinks after every pull.
---
I'm aware of how the mobs in SM work, I spent 14 levels in there. Had my fair share of counterspells casted on mana burns and monks interrupting me, but they straight up were just easy to deal with. Pressing your kick binding then changing target isn't exactly something groundbreaking my guy. 
---
&gt;Let's not forget that nasty pull in ZF, right at the exit to Gah`zrilla pool from pyramid. 4 shadowhunters (ranged, can instacast hex) and a healer. If not CCed properly - they just hex the tank, hex the healer and go to town on DDs.
---
Don't remember any scary pack at the end of ZF, maybe they are random spawns within the pack like a lot of the individual mobs in there? The single zf full clear I did was smooth as silk, no problems just doing the old pull pack, press damage buttons/occasionally CS, drink/move to next pack
---
&gt;Higher level dungeons have even nastier things to screw you if not handled properly, but you don't know it because others do it for you. 
---
what phase do these dungeons with nasty mechanics come out in? sick of dungeons that are easier than retail LFG dungeons.
---
I don't get haikus
---
They are extremely simple
---
And not even good
---
Even 60‚Äôs can still kill grays, it‚Äôs just not gonna boost their honor. But it‚Äôs not gonna negatively affect them, so why would that stop people?
---
&gt;If the numbers were disclosed by Blizz regarding population / balance then the players would eventually balance it out themselves. At least better than now.
---
The moment unofficial stats went up for classic servers the faction imbalance exploded. The community can't be trusted to balance it because the majority want to play on a pvp server with little chance of being ganked. It's... Ironic to say the least.
---
It's more about how many hits before they die. You can say train unarmed to 300 in deeprun tram on rats in the corner where they spawn.
---
So no level doesn't matter for skillups, just the ability to hit while they live that's affected.
---
From personal experience, chances are higher on higher level mobs.
---
That button didn't exist in vanilla
---
Thanks. Haikus in English make no sense.
---
Throw weapon - 1 Sinister Strike - 2
---
Eviscerate - 3 Rupture 4
---
Backstab - Shift 2 SlicenDice - Shift 3

It's like people want to be able to stop playing the game lol
---
uuh. nice haiku :)
---
I remmber my frst adrenalne ruhs.
---
I expect this post to be removed.
---
Yes, that is possible. Weapon leveling speed is primarily affected by Intelligence. If you plan on getting a weapon from 0 to 300, consider asking a Mage for a buff before you depart.
---
Started playing with my brother on Gehenna and my god the queues are outrageous. Haven't been able to get on after work all week. Rolled on Zandalar Tribe an alt whilst I wait for the situation to right itself
---
I didn't say they couldn't? But saying that 3 hours is slow even for a casual guild is blatantly false.
---
Just grab some oil of immolation rank 4 holy nova rank 6 renew and rank 4 flash heal. And if you want to be really special some holy water.
---
You'll smash it.
---
Dps warrior?
---
That's not how it works
---
Alright, from my experience yesterday, 55+ for DM East, 58+ (preferably 60) for DM West and North.
---
‚ÄúCheaper than AH‚Äù is not a price
---
I doubt they will try something like this. No matter how you look at it, it still allows you to save gold by using real money and a lot of people would hate it for different reasons ("No change!", "Blizzard is charging extra money just to play the game the way I want to!" etc).
---
I'd assume they stick to services that are kind of accepted (Paid Server Transfer) and gladly take the subscribtion money rather than risking to alienate the playerbase.
---
There's a rogue on PragerU named *GetGanked*
---
Instance resets don't seem to show for other party members.
---
Or.....English language is not something they use a lot;)
---
/reload refreshes it
---
I'd like to know that as well.
---
It's the difference in toddlers racing on tricycles and adults racing formula one. We're smarter and better at finding items our characters need because of experience and time.

I apologize, I thought you said he booted you, then said you lost the roll, as in 2 separate things, but you said both.

As a deep resto shaman I farm herbs to buy random shit in the AH and farm rep where needed via dungeons

Now there is dm so more loot and quests and watnot

Hang on, you're that guy who made the Dota Digest?

That was funny, I hope you're making some more good stuff for Classic!

I did something similar with a female undead

Yea ur right, apparently its only a dishonorable kill if its a graylevel NPC

---
Hazzikostas' proof, quoted in the article, is that just killing the adds (here he makes the implicit assumption that they get lucky and adds spawn in the room) requires 230k damage per minute, which he implies is just barely doable against a single target - and not doable when people have to move around and deal with other mechanics. Since then, stacking fury warriors and mages has been demonstrated to put out much, much larger numbers. In fact, it seems to me that the DPS numbers achiavable today are enough to skip the adds almost completely, just as any good MC raid skips Ragnaros' submerge phase.
---
That said, I don't believe they'll release the fight. Intentionally publishing a bugged fight just to test an old myth is not a good idea.
---
It's because the guild you're in is corrupt. It's not that uncommon. My friends and I do the same thing. Find a new guild.
---
I have the exact same perception from the opposit direction: every hordie seems to quest in a party and have lv60 friends very close.
---
Which means that it's probably the same in both factions, we just remember those which pose a danger to us more.
---
1-6, Generators/Spenders
---
Modifiers (and 1-6), Cooldowns, Macros, Special things
---
Only running this because I've ran it since vanilla on my rogue, changing it now would feel odd.
---
Yeah, Westfall is PvE too, it just hurts finding groups. Luckily I'm in an active guild so if I need a group I can usually find people there.
---
I'm confused, couldn't you make another party and let warlock keep the instance for his friend?
---
I've never seen one and to my knowledge feral druid ones won't drop until phase 5. These were also added in later vanilla patches.
---
Well the fortunate thing about spriests is that they're easy to spot!
---
Iirc it's yours..
---
im a person that played more pserver than official server after the end of wotlk.
---
im not sure how you came to your conclusions.
---
the way bugfixing on pservers worked is:
---
1. you find something you think is wrong
---
2. you research the topic to find **evidence** about the unintended behaviour indeed beeing a bug ( patchnotes, videos, calculations, maybe some forum posts and comments that underline the problem and or directly describe the correct behavior etc.)
---
3. you submit a your change via a bugtracker **with** your researched evidence.
---
4. the devs review your ticket and implement it as soon as they get to it.
---
now, there obviously are some problems with that.
---
things only get fixed when:
---
 there is evidence, the devs know HOW to fix it (most are literally hobbyists coding in their free time to help make a better server), and they have enough time to get to it.
---
keep in mind that the first point alone is quite tricky since patchnotes are limited to the most obvious changes and most footage is 360p and rarely complete if existing at all ( who made a video about the patrol routes of humans mob nr 105915 in westfall back in 2006?). most calculations are community based and an approximation at most.
---
so when privateserver enthusasts claim " x is wrong" they are either only at step one in the above mentioned steps and since blizzard has ALL the evidence right there in their reference client their claim is more like a: "please check x, it might be wrong"
---
or
---
they already found evidence "y is wrong, here is a video from 2006 vanilla of y beeing different" in which case blizzard has to find out why its different in the video( different patch with undocumented changes in the patchnotes or other reasons etc.)
---
they are idiots just being loud idiots in which case we get to sigh in unison and can be happy blizzard has the reference client.
---
all in all i dont see how a community that is drilled to make changes based on evidence is somehow representative of people that do the exact opposite.
---
also i dont see the connection between paying a sub fee to making baseless accusations.
---
if your point is: people care less about a product when they dont pay for it
---
then please keep in mind that every day your complete progress on a pserver could be deleted for seemingly no reason (blizzard shutdown, person in charge of server lost interest, drama between people in charge, fraud, electronic failure etc.etc.etc.)
---
so yes the users dont pay but they are also loyal enough to the product to take the chance of day to day account deletion.
---
i appear to have rambled quite a bit. but i hope you get where i come from :).
---
First of all you should have a price prolly second of all 
---
The quantity influences how much they offer you per item 
---
Seems the POV here is an idiot
---
Tell him to level the class himself.
---
As a warrior when I need to train up a weapon skill I find a barely green mob and spam sunder armor on it.  Sunder does no damage but counts as a weapon swing.  If the skill is brand new, ie I got my first polearm recently, I can hit sunder on cooldown and the first minute I've gained 60 points of skill.
---
Pay attention next time and respect the bow. The bow is love, the bow is life. Death before an unreciprocated bow, you coward!
---
Just because an item is rare does not mean it is valuable
---
Looking for a bit of macro help.  The macro below does everything I want it to do except for squelching the "that's not ready yet" voice over when inner focus is not available.

Am I the only one sick of hearing from Mark Jacobs? I instantly skip through those parts.

Shouldn‚Äôt you get a sword considering you‚Äôre human?

That's why there should be a creation lockout if they pass the 60/40 mark.

---
There are also parts of the world that are just completely flat and empty and buildings with missing textures when seen from above. They shortened a few flight paths in Cataclysm because they didn't have to avoid those things anymore.
---
They need to allow just alli to xfer to stalagg, I honestly think thats the only way to solve the imbalance. Ever since everyone transferred to heartseeker the first time, every zone is dead after 12. If not just open paid transfers so i can get the hell off this server.
---
I'm on westfall alliance side.  Community is active and lookingforgroup is always busy.  Our forums and discord are crickets though.
---
Thank you for destroying skeram, you rolled there and are the cause of the imbalance for leaving. The ratio before transfers opened was fine.
---
Did DM east with my friend fury warior, he tanked it with a 2h no issues
---
I wish to god the names were uncovered just so we know who dumpster fires like this are.
---
You've never tanked before? I wouldn't start with something like BRD, Sunken Temple or Uldaman. Start with something like DM (all 4 of them! :-), SM, Strat. Anything you can either follow a "road" or just kill everything.
---
[These maps](https://www.fadedandblurred.com/wow-classic-dungeon-maps-for-tanks/) are awesome. Open the page before zoning into the dungeon, don't search for the link after you got lost.

That‚Äôs an interesting build.  Most people go 0/30/21 for NS.  That instant full heal is so hard to pass up.  But 0/30/21 is more of a healing build rather than a tanking build.  
---
If you‚Äôre primarily tanking why so many points on resto?  You can‚Äôt cast them in bear form.  Wouldn‚Äôt you be better off going balance for the omen of clarity and even thorns?
---
I‚Äôm looking for a compelling reason to keep lotp.  Help me out, man.
---
Hi. I would recommend orc warlock or shaman. Everyone loves those.
---
No time for raid, no time to achieve enough honour for rewards.
---
Classic is time in &gt; reward out.
---
Alright, thank you!
---
The buccaroos
---
Thanks for the tips!
---
Been seeing this a lot for 55-60...and it‚Äôs happened to me.  
---
Whenever I see a DPS warrior asking for a tank I just glance right over. Like nah dude, you don‚Äôt get the cake and eat it to.  I‚Äôm prot specced and life sucks unless I‚Äôm in a dungeon/raid.
---
But you said you one shot every boss, that hardly sounds difficult right now?
---
Sounds to me like you need a less serious, more casual fun guild.
---
&gt; Basically he's saying that the only reason he saved him was to get something out of it (recognition) 
---
Sorry I have to break it to you, but that's how everything works. Everyone always does everything for themselves. Sometimes the reward is intrinsic like you feeling better because you've helped someone, sometimes more extrinsic.
---
It was a well known fact 14 years ago because nobody then knew these new tricks. Now some people know how while most people still keep persisting outdated information. Considering druids are the least played class there's a high chance of this being a self-perpetuating thing. It's just not true at least until AQ40, but chances are you will never see it, because people won't allow it based on outdated information. Which is funny because content right now is so easy you can walk in with pretty much any spec and succeed without investing a large effort.
---
It was a solid 75% of a lvl with just turns ins , excluding all the kill exp and mob grinding I did
---
Ty guys &lt;3
---
Happened to me in legion,I accidentally out a neck up for 7000g when I meant to out it up for 70kg,a tsm user bought it right away.
---
Haha I thought I recognised his name from somewhere
---
43 Shaman here - getting a little tired of questing and finding mobs are camped all the time. Is it worth respeccing into resto and levelling primarily in dungeons? I'm probably going to be healing end game anyway so this could be a good time to get practice in.
---
I life tap inbetween pulls, bandage and eat drink still. and most of my dumbass healers will still blow a greater heal on me
---
implying op doesnt actually know that
---
i thing 1-5 should be used for less used skills and Fs like for buffs etc. 
---
I use E as main spam key and then shift, ctrl, alt to next ones. Same with R, F and Q. Also middle button on mouse with Ctrl etc.
---
Completely outnumbered now? Yes.
---
Before the transfers opened? It was 58/42.
---
I feel like what we lose in DPS we make up in utility. +100 (+50? from howl) attack power for your team, traps, etc. Not to mention fd/jumper cables if you're an engineer
---
Dog eat dog world
---
Either bring some well geared guildies and friends or pay some well geared people for help.  I did a mix of the those.  I‚Äôve got my trinket on my 19 twink priest
---
this wont help gehennas, that server is still layered so expect queues to increase even further when they disable the second layer
---
Skinners love this simple trick...
---
There's a point just before the flight path approach where it branches off and bridges over to the outgoing flightpath for the next part. You have to hit the stop button before hitting that (invisible) point or it won't work.
---
Wow there's actually a lot I had no idea about
---
I got owned in STV while playing on my mage. was minding my own business, sitting down eating and drinking. Saw just I'm the corner of my screen a mage starting to cast Frost bolt. I jump up and try to cast ice barrier but from one guy came 5 frost bolts then right after 5 fire blast
---
It's this mentality that gives you shitty tanks leveling up. 9 of 10 warrior "tanks" level up as arms or fury with little to no points in protection.  They are basing threat on dps. Protection stance increases threat but you have no aoe abilities to maintain threat on larger pulls. In our aoe meta gameplay now where almost no one uses cc, if you want an aoe tank, use a paladin. If you're horde, dps will need to either use cc or wait until the tank has sufficient aggro (but that won't happen, hence all these types of threads). This in turn causes less people to roll a tank because they don't feel like they are contributing to a group if all the monsters run free or attack their teammates.
---
Good post. Youre very smart
---
An addon for sniping ah
---
which of these serveres to you consider 'dead'?
---
To avoid queues. A lot more servers were open in Wrath, and the biggest servers still had queues. As they're starting to remove layering some queues on Classic are starting to come back, like Herod for example
---
Activate the summoning stones.
---
I levelled prot. If I‚Äôm alright after that, I‚Äôll be alright forever LUL
---
3. Can someone explain to me how Paladin AoE grinding works?
---
this is why i'm making this post. yes i know i need a sword, but the above weps is what i currently have. the deathbringer is a huge dps advantage but then the mirahs song is faster? so which would be better for me to use?
---
tooshay!
---
Yupp it‚Äôs always worth it to stick around and grind mobs if they are fast to kill and you have no competition for spawns. 
---
The second you need to actively look for mobs to kill its time to rotate.
---
okay thanks so gut and another dagger how long will this weap load out last me?
---
Don\`t forget to run RFD for a sick plate chest before lvl 38 (assuming you\`re war or pala)
---
Party it's the fear of missing out. Since there are so many who rushed to 60 and other who just have a lot of time on their hands and naturally just get to 60 rather soon, some might get pressured to hurry up.
---
I joined a guild about 3 weeks ago and people getting 60 one after another and the people I hung out with on discord also were a few levels above me, where they could go dungeons that I couldn't, yet. So I hurried up to catch up because I didn't want to miss out on the fun and the prospective amazing drop that I might want.
---
Idk... being on full/high pop Herod as alliance can‚Äôt be much better...
---
I‚Äôm not kidding when I say I get about 80% of my quest help from Horde.
---
SFk, RFK, RFD, BFD, and several other instances are impossible to find groups for since the alliance population is so low.
---
Forget about trying to find an elite quest.
---
I see 5-10 Horde for every alliance player.
---
It‚Äôs getting old.
---
I believe it would look something like this
---
%√∑/W&lt;¬∞~]?v./
---
Nah, it's the same for level 1 critters or level 63 raid bosses.
---
I think it was in a time where the future was a mystery and anything was possible.
---
Now we realise it's better to aim for attainable things and find contentness with what we have. I tried to shoot for Shadowmourn, but only got the materials. I still needed the guild to want me to have it. I learned my lesson. We're entitled to *nothing* in this game except for enjoyment.
---
So are your ‚Äúfriends‚Äù still telling you it‚Äôs all good and fair after the last run?
---
Oh wow, does horrigan have a black friend as well? Must be impossible for any racism to be taking place there
---
i know this is an old post. but hopefully someone will see my question:
---
I am having a hard time deciding on my BiS gear. i am following the guide for gear that is linked in this post but sometimes i get confused as to why something isn‚Äôt listed there. for example, i have had the whole Shadoweave set (none of it is listed there) since my low 40s and now i‚Äôm 56 and starting to replace it. i recently won a roll on the silk web glove from BRD, they have 13int and 13sta and no SP damage, yet they‚Äôre listed here. but the shadoweave gloves that have 5int and 17SD aren‚Äôt listed here. are the Silkweb gloves better than the shadoweave gloves? why
---
Mages got shafted by dire maul too so no reason for you do it. Sucks
---
People would totally buy it. I'd assume many of the players have an actual income this time around. They would hardly miss 10‚Ç¨. But even if people used it, it has this scammy "we release a crappy game and make you pay to make it bearable" feel that plagues mobile games. I doubt Blizzard would want to be associated with those (even if we have phones *scnr*).

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dj5jpd/new_servers_any_possibility/). 
---
The reality is that most of it is like The Office but with none of the cute hijinks and double the ineptitude.
---
In addition to the other guy; as a rogue theres definitely some abilities that one wants to bind multiple times in a macro. E.g. stop-attack CS, stop-attack EA, mouse-over blind etc.

Maybe stuff has changed, but originally in TBC fishing was based on the number of casts, not what you caught. So it was entirely possible to go from 1 to max wherever you wanted as long as you kept reeling in stuff. Even garbage counted. I just ended up sitting in WC from 1 to max back then.
---
Haven't tried to level fishing in classic though, might be different.

---
Good old Classic giving gamers a reason to shower
---
but real talk why did you not /thanks or /salute after he saved you? that should have been your first reaction. 
---
ungrateful. sad.

---
I worked at a small manufacturer and one of the managers downloaded something from an "improve your Google search results!" type of email.
---
It was ransomware, encrypted everything on the network and demanded a ridiculous amount of money in bitcoins.
---
Made my job a nightmare since this backwoods hick company was really not prepared very well for something like this.
---
The vast majority of these people become managers not because they're smarter or harder workers than anyone else, but because they're friends with the owners. So of course the guy was never reprimanded or taught what he did wrong.
---
So I think what i'm realizing is I have my movement keys different than most. I keep QWE as strafe and forward. So my hands are up high enough where the F keys aren't a huge leap. I can hit Eviserate(F2) while strafing without an issue. I use A and D for utilities. I'm seeing through this post that people bring strafe down to A and D so now Im understanding how Shift is viable for them
---
What he said, but should be noted its considered a belly laugh, one of those loud involuntary ones. So pretty much any dwarvan laugh.
---
&gt; I don't give Blizzard any credit for addressing faction imbalance with that, because I consider it a band-aid fix
---
You just said they have never admitted faction balance was a problem in the history of WoW...
---
Go elemental - you can solo and heal very well in instances. Maybe respec resto at like 55
---
Depends on what gear people are aiming for. Balckcrow is the same as satyers bow. The hit is good if you don‚Äôt already have % hit gear in other spots. Only stacking % hit gear is not the most optimal. Rogues get 5% hit from talents. I wouldn‚Äôt trust 100% on the BiS lists because before satyrs bow they said PCB was better than black crow, yet bow a bow with the **same stats** as black crow is magically better?
---
No PVP -&gt; PVE transfers? I might continue playing the game if that's available.
---
Not BiS with dire maul live, FYI
---
All I know is that Mankrik alliance is toxic as fuck.
---
This is a pretty recent update I think. Def need a rollback on it.
---
How is Earthfury looking these days?
---
Honestly, that's pretty much all zones near Night Elf areas. The NE starting area has you running all over, filling vials and moonwells. Darkshore has you running back and forth collecting water from falls or picking up remains on beaches. And then Felwood is just more of the same, but with different things you pick up.

Personally I'm thankful.

I want RPPvP to be RPPvP. Not PvP. This is a chance for people who jumped here just to skip queues and PvP to move to a pure PvP server. Rather than sit on an RP server yet mock people who RP or RPPvP.
---
no, most damaging abilities (multi shot, aimed shot) depend on raw weapon damage, which is extremely low for PBS, making it trash tier for hunters.
---
That's hardly imbalanced at all and I would gladly roll a character of the minority faction on a realm with that balance ratio.
---
It would be an attempt. His suggestion wouldn't change the balance of Horde and Alliance players.
---
how's that stupid?
---
To add on to what everyone else is saying here, because from what I've read I've yet to see this pointed out.
---
So, yes off-hand attacks go from 27% base miss rate to only 9% when queue'ing a Heroic Strike, and yes this will obviously lead to more Rage.
---
On top of that, and the thing I see being missed in this thread is that Special attacks (Yellow attacks, whatever you want to call them) cannot become a Glancing Blow.  So, this combined with the additional hit % mean that your off-hand attacks will not only land more often, but they will do full damage (minus mitigation from armor) when they do land.
---
All of this added up means more Rage and more Rage means you let Heroic Strike go through more often.  This also means that your main hand attacks now carry that same 9% base miss rate and will not be Glancing Blows.
---
Altogether, you increase your DPS a lot and this is why their parses will show more Heroic Strikes.
---
I showed you my /bow, pls respond
---
Man ain't that the truth.  People are putting way to much importance on BiS gear.  Even your second or 3rd BiS isn't gonna be much different than the best. A lot of people seem to be under the impression you need these to raid and in like half my guild was wearing greens and whatever bullshit they could find back in vanilla and we still cleared MC.

I had a mage flip on the wlock for getting a libram, which he greed won. Pulled some mobs and hs'ed out. He didnt roll on the libram which makes me think he allready had one. Mages be weird.
---
You‚Äôre just gonna have to trust the people who say there are no ethical microtransactions. 
---
All MTX hurt an MMO in one form or another.
---
Cause he enjoyed being on the dominant faction population wise. Now where is he gonna get his free kills? How is he gonna hide his terrible play with numbers if there's no one to outnumber?
---
It's a win-win for warriors. The more you can land your white hits, the more rage you get, so the more damage from skills you can do (which will miss less often...)
---
Have a rogue friend pick both doors for you.
---
Fire prot pot is going for around 100g on my server. Mongoose isn‚Äôt the hard one to get.

I play on faerlina alliance I really haven't ran into this problem tbh
---
Come to think of it he might just be straight grinding levels. Those lions spawn insanely fast, it's probably super efficient and gives tons of leather. You'll never really have any competition either since people just summon echeyekee and leave.
---
Wrong dicktator.
---
It does matter.
---
That's interesting, didn't think the regeneration would be that significant! I'll stick then. Thanks!
---
if you have the Recount addon (dps meter), you can see the talents of everyone else who also has the addon.
---
and which is better in raid tanking between druid and paladin isn't even a debate, so i was speaking for dungeons.
---
Also, druids can tank 90% of raid bosses and are the best offtank for the whole content, we see raids with druids as MT downing onyxia/ragnaros left and right. a fresh lvl 60 druid is  also better than a fresh lvl 60 warrior for tanking.
---
We had battlegroups in vanilla too.
---
Hello fellow Buccaneer. The awesome Horde community on Bloodsail really is the best kept secret
---
Depends whenever you find a better mainhand dagger or decide to go change spec to combat or hemo.
---
Imagine going to a store and the clerk wont tell you the price
---
+5 weapon damage on MH (this increases top end damage for higher Backstab crits). Off hand = Crusader and later +15 Agility (in Phase 3 when Timbermaw Hold reputation enchants come online)
---
Also f\*\*k off.
---
You are correct.
---
Did OP just try and make a political joke and accidentally out himself a racist
---
I rerolled my original character from when I started playing like 10 years ago or however long it‚Äôs been, a human warlock into an undead warlock for classic
---
I don‚Äôt really do much actual role play but I think it was a really cool idea and I‚Äôve quite liked it, especially since undead have always been my favorite race and I just got forced into alliance back then
---
I am also playing with 2/3 Ruthlessness and 4/5 Lethality. Since you crit quite a lot with backstab, it should be better this way.
---
Aye, this is the literal point of IF airport.
---
But they control both. They could have just textured and designed the direct route rather than the ones they did.
---
...... 
---
Because you‚Äôre on Faerlina Alliance. The balance is well in your favor.
---
Some servers are the opposite though. Herod is at least 70:30 Horde, with each transfer phase it feels more like 85:15 Horde. 
---
Faerlina is the opposite of that.
---
Looks like a raid wipe... mystery solved
---
Technically at that point he was a death knight.
---
This reminded me, me finding out that you can 2-man Nightbane in Karazhan (Twisting Nether EU). If you lose aggro, that thing moves through the door and starts attacking people in stable area.
---
Best DPS is certainly [0/31/20](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/-05050105305010051-5023011053) or some variation. Second best by a fair distance would be [Impale Prot](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/30305001302-03-50250112530001051).

It's to make you play longer.
---
If they can force 2 hours of playtime where you're forced not to do anything, then that just serves to lengthen the game.
---
Imagine how much wasted time you'll spend on flightpaths over the next year. Blizz are raking it in!

It's like when people changes their Facebook profile to include the French flag.

I think the thing I don't get is he tried to make it look like the guy got kicked but it is a completely different character name he clicked

You both seem annoying af.
---
That's because people don't talk to each other in retail so there's nothing to ignore.

I dont want to miss out either, but I also have a job and offline responsibilities. I get maybe 2-5 hours a day unless I take vacation and then I have all day.

Do it. Delete your horde and main Alliance on Skeram or Stalagg or Kirtonos. Be the change you want to see, unless its all hollow words which I'm suspecting it is.

How many tubes of lube?

So I throw the ball to Naturally...
---
LMAO I have never had trouble progressing through raid content.
---
I rolled a healer and my brother rolled a tank - LF 3 DPS &lt;insert dungeon name here&gt;
---
&gt;Soul Link is a ridiculous talent. Just look at the amount of damage it mitigates vs other talents in this game. It's not balanced at all. It might be fair if it were like, 15%.  But 30 is just absurd.
---
did you ban Stealth and charge aswell? Sounds pretty arbitery. You wanted this remember? YOU wanted this.
---
I'd tweak the taunt macro slightly.
---
\#showtooltip Taunt

/cast Defensive Stance

/cast Taunt

Any sheep/gouge will stop your attack, but taunting doesn't start it.
---
Blizzard scammers would get so much more traction if they just invest in some proofreaders.
---
It's the same as any expansion though right?
---
More horde on heartseeker&lt;3
---
Got from 52 to 60 in a weekend just grinding Lbrs.
---
Idk man, it just seem selfish. First they are selling the item, they are selling a chance for the item. Second, is it not enough to just get all the drops? It's live Strath, there is likely going to be a few orbs.
---
They should call you the fish monger! When I have enough time off I have a ton of quests for Uldaman so im figuring 1 run from there and I should be set... but I wont have time to do that until sometime next week. The suspense. Lol
---
Well I used to tank in retail but in the later expansions, where I remember it being really easy (not mythic or anything). In retail I used to heal so was basically dragged through dungeons rather than pay attention to what's happening at the front! 
---
I am only level 12 at the moment... so a way off those yet haha.
---
Wow that link looks amazing! Thank you for that, something to study and keep open on the second monitor :D
---
Why would they give a fuck about other players? If they want to spend gold to do 0.01% more DPS let them. That's not a reason for "le casual redditors" to call them elitists.
---
Hardcore minmaxing vs MC is bad? Hmm tell that to the guy who lost Rank 1 on Raggy by [19 DPS](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/rankings/1000#boss=672) :D
---
They were fine for you. If all of those Alliance agreed with you they wouldn't have left. It doesn't make sense blaming the transfers than it does blaming the Horde for farming those Alliance so diligently. As players we can't regulate the behavior of other players. Only Blizzard can do that. Clearly they fucked up. Lets place the blame where it belongs.
---
"So it doesn't have a price huh ? Nice."
---
*walks away with the item*
---
Feel a bit worried with Flamelash being on there, while we're a high/full pop server there's never  any queues on weekdays or weekends.
---
I'd understand more if it was Horde only since the server is favoured towards Horde.
---
Saw a ton of mages spamming general trying to sell stacks of water for 2g a hit the morning of release. Be interested to know how much they sold actually.. I imagine a good chunk based on how crazy some people tip me for lockpicking.
---
When I botted back in nilla I believe glider had a function to send you a text when you got whispered so you could remote in real quick and reply back just incase that scenario happened
---
Had the same thing happen 4 times in the span of 6 months. Luckily we had a shit ton of backups because it was a bigger company but still, very annoying.
---
I remember one time our exchange server crashed and didn't work for a while. Some woman in sales notices he can't recieve any mails and also can't send out mails. So his first impulse was to write a mail to me with the following content (mind everything is kind of re-phrased because it's translated from german): 
---
Dear X,  
---
I'm in urgent need of help. I can't recieve nor send any mails. Please help me as soon as possible.  
---
After our server went back online again I read the mail and decided to call this woman.  
---
She immediatly complained why it took me so long to respond to her mail.  
---
I decided to lead her torwards the answer instead of just explaining it to her.  
---
Still after I recited her mail, paraphrased the content of the mail and asked her if she noticed any issue with that, she had no idea why it took me so long to respond and what she could've done differently.
---
I was stunned by this stupidity...
---
Go on with your bad self
---
Hey buddy, FYI that's not how layering works, max server capacity is still the same
---
BinNy PLs PlaY DMC2 is VuRy gUd Gaem
---
I enjoy the wait sometimes, feels like a nice ebb and flow, gives me time to read some stuff up on the game, or watch some videos.
---
Just communicate to your group.
---
"Hey, I haven't been in here in over a decade, hollar if I go the wrong way, or do something stupid please"
---
Usually does it for me and my groups, They know to speak up up if it looks like something questionable is about to happen, but other than that most people just want to get the dungeon knocked out, so will put up with quite a bit.
---
Myself If I'm little uncertain, I'll leave a bigger margin on the healer's mana, and be more vocal about what I'm doing. ("waiting for pat", "healer mana")
---
Currently playing a 30 Feral Druid and tanking for the first time.  
---
I played WOW back in the day but don't remember all of the dungeons, layouts, mods...etc...  
---
BUT I have had a great time tanking, I have found the majority are super helpful and will put up with a silly wipe from a mechanic or something as long as you show you're willing to learn.  
---
I often get lost but usually someone knows the way and is happy to guide, if not we just follow a rough 'path' and try not to go back on ourselves. As long as you're steady and don't over extend you're usually pretty good with most groups.  
---
Just my personal experience but I am loving it!
---
I guess tusks grow with experience?
---
The stupidity of this statement is amazing.
---
They really did it just to reduce textures.
---
So I have this idea for a great movie...
---
&gt; That's not my point
---
So why did you reply to the comment if you're talking about something totally unrelated? I'm saying OP is a retard for calling that guy Elitist.
---
&gt;I don't think they actually have the exact source code for the server
---
They do. That's what is meant by "reference client", how else would they be testing these things? If they just had the CLIENT itself, they wouldn't be able to test anything.
---
I don't feel like it's particularly underpopulated. You ally or horde
---
im stuck cant get to my corpse or graveyard its there a way to hearth back to the inn?
---
This is a problem for future me.
---
Curious, why not keep stealth and exit stealth on the same click?
---
   &gt; I strafe with A and D
---
Seems like everyone but me does haha
---
That doesnt sound true at all. I can't think of a single other talent that has secret functions not mentioned at all. And no, the arms talent that generates rage is not the same - it's worded poorly but its not a hidden mechanic
---
Hows the gold per hour?
---
A man of culture, I see.
---
Earthshaker is far from dead, rerolled there myself from Gehennas. Seems like a healthy realm atm!
---
Anybody knows if they did an episode on rogue pvp?
---
Up to brd you should be fine.
---
Mara queen hits like a truck tho.
---
I farmed here for a while, there's an infinite spawn of those lionesses every 15 seconds.
---
What part of it do you disagree with? Very unclear response.  
---
Did you not want a key ring? It was a thing in Vanilla.  
---
We don't have guild banks right now, did you want that? I think my biggest "I wish they added this" right now is  the Calendar. It literally doesn't affect the gameplay but makes community in-game stronger. Easier to coordinate events.
---
Left Herod as Alliance to Heartseeker. It was refreshing being able to actually play the game.
---
Thanks for sharing your experiences so far, I am more confident now in giving it a go!
---
rather be an idiot that an asshole
---
21/30 Holy Priests in spell damage gear can easily do 300-350 DPS spamming Smite and MB on CD.
---
This is true. I'll try to get guildmates involved first...
---
In conclusion: Mages are the real problem here.
---
Your obviously talking about &lt;The Linner Lads&gt;
---
Fucking what?
---
/w or GTFO
---
Ideally, yes.  But rule of thumb, if it hurts more, use it.
---
Same with maces.  But if you're passing up using a better weapon JUST because of that when no other comparable choices.
---
It's basically the same as tier one, except its spell damage rather than just healing
---
I was talking to a guy last nite who told me the census addons have been fixed, the current server cap is 9,000 players with half in each layer meaning when layers are removed Blizzard will be allowing only 4,500 players on each realm at once. 
---
I'm not saying the guy is right but there is a reason they are offering free transfers from Faerlina. I'm not sure when I'll get a chance to log on to test this out myself but if he is right then your experience is going to be very very different in a month when they remove the 2nd layer and you are facing 2 hour queues again.
---
Do you have 300 Engineering, and about 2,000g worth of Iron Grenades / Sapper Charges / FAPs and LIPs?
---
Because if not then you are not ready for Battlegrounds. And most aren‚Äôt either.
---
So are unicorns...

I've been healing MC for 3 weeks with a 31/0/20 resto shaman and I don't have any issues, just use mana pots and be efficient. I keep my overhealing under 25% and still beat deep resto Shamans, I ranked 3rd out of 6 last MC.
---
Guild bank
---
That's why they say bring a warrior friend along as a regular healer.  I think Druid Heart of the Wild spec is the only one that can put out some damage by swapping gear sets to help mitigate how miserable it is for healers to solo content.
---
Depends on how they do it of course. But if someone approached me and told me that they're willing to sell me an item from strat live, I wouldn't mind it. As soon as they demand that I put in effort as well it's a different story entirely.
---
The sound effects really bring it all together
---
They never message me because they know my warrior ass has 0 gold
---
Fuck, I hate nerds.
---
Doesn't that 20% increase apply to crits and non-crits? Meaning that it's just double damage for crits(%1 increase)?
---
Help me understand how you getting more than that? Unless something is only increasing your crit damage and doesn't not increase non-crit damage.
---
Which is horde on every single PvP sever except 2. Think about that for a second.
---
    /console Sound_EnableErrorSpeech 0
---
Well, it's a reenactment, we didn't want to *actually* kill anyone.
---
&gt; Since there's 2 of u you can also trick the horde player. Your wife stands in shadowmeld. You just stand like 30 meters away attacking random lions. As soon as they start the quest you switch to the horde and start attacking, your wife hops out of shadowmeld and start taming.
---
Barrens is Horde territory. Unless they flag themselves deliberately, you can't attack them there.
---
Even if you traded the BiS items from "+frost dmg" to "+ spell dmg" you'd probably miss out on about 40-ish spell dmg, maybe a bit more....  Not a deal breaker by any means....  Fire is far and away much better single target DPS than frost.... Much much better, but because of bosses immunity to fire... not viable until AQ.
---
Who?
---
there is an "unstuck" ability when you click on the questionmark in your ui.
---
im not sure it would solve your problem since you didnt provide alot of info but it could potentially help.
---
male tauren /train is the most god tier emote of all time
---
65% horde before any transfers. That's not fine. Horde transferring is the only solution. Don't blame alliance. Horde will all stay because they enjoy pve care bear realm.
---
Yes... true altruism doesn't exist. But showing kindness because it makes you feel good is undeniably more noble than showing kindness for an expected returned favor, no matter how small.
---
The only reason I can think of is somebody is being disappointed about lack of RP ( personally I find tons of RPs in playing time ) but you can't transfer to the only RP realm out there lol.
---
Moving to another PVP realm seem pointless when the there is no queue problem as well.
---
I  fell from the grave in hinterlands now im in the shore and cant get back to my grave because the whole coast of the hinterlands is mountains that i cant cross
---
Flamestrike proc on this shield IS NOT WORKING now
---
Have you leveled mostly with spell cleaving?
---
The game can be easy if everyone knows the roles. I'd say its more smooth then easy. It might be more easy for mages/locks/hunters because they're ranged. And they can cc so they don't die instantly. I've seen plenty of mages and warlocks dying in dungeons though.
---
Yeah you are right, couldn't remember the name of it. Tarnished elven ring or something similar.
---
TEABAG HIM!
---
There‚Äôs a pretty good guide out there, I think it‚Äôs on wowhead, that will shoe you the places you need to go. 
---
For instance if you at 150 go to badlands and enter Angorr Fortress. You need to be a higher level than the area because they are elites. The top area can get you over 175 and you can go to bottom area to around 225. Then go to searing gorge.
---
Fury can definitely have moments where it's gcd locked even with Heroic Strike spam, usually during a good Recklessness sequence.
---
Whatever it is that you're losing on a miss, you don't want to. Missing a 30 rage Bloodthirst restores 25 rage, to my knowledge. Assuming that you would be rage starved and thus Bloodthirst cooldown doesn't matter, you waste an average of 0.45 rage on each Bloodthirst having no hit compared to the 0 you waste hit capped. That's a lot. Simply sinking it into an Execute later on would deal 7 damage, *per Bloodthirst*. That's already a lot of damage going away disregarding all factors but one and assuming the cooldown doesn't matter.
---
Earthfury alliance checking in! It‚Äôs a great server I agree
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Yeah, just farm Mara lol, at least you can put your brain on cruise control since it's very easy.
---
True
---
Good to know. That you beat other (deep) resto shamans says more about your skill/gear level relative to theirs however, as deep resto will indubitably be more efficient at healing.

nice thank you this solved it

I literally went upstairs, had a conversation, lost track of them time, took a piss, grabbed a drink, went back to the conversatio... Shit I'm probably AFK in UC.  Went back to the computer... still flying.
---
I think you‚Äôre fine. Cold blood / Prep is amazing.
---
Rivenaleem has left the guild.
---
Whenever i see a party of alliance, the horde are usually running around solo getting roflstomped... :(
---
This is a terrible idea. It's already annoying enough when you find out a friend is playing on another server and then you would also prevent people from joining the faction their friends are playing on?
---
Delete this post immediately.
---
Please people come to Bloodfang! PVP Alt is suffering over there
---
That is a hard question to answer. As FuZePL said, Viskang with Brutality Blade is the best combo, though Ironfoe is very nice (shame you can't offhand it).
---
In the end, I think Mirah's song will outperform Deathbringer for a few reasons. First, the 5 weapon skill essentially equals 3.5% hit. So you have 3.5% hit, 9 str, 9 agi vs 16.7 dps. Imo, the hit alone wins, let alone the stats on Mirah's. 
---
Also, keep this in mind: as fury, your offhand's sole purpose is to generate rage to use abilities tied to your main hand. Hitting hard is nice, but hitting more often is nicer. Stick with Mirah's.
---
All non-layered realms get Medium/High during peak time.
---
Why didn't you just answer his question?
---
It's not cloak of shadows.  If you don't have points in sub when you're super close to a target chances are they might still be able to see you.  I remember running, sometimes even with sprint, just to make sure they wouldn't see me after I vanished.
---
As a warrior in our current meta, yes it is. I initially rolled a horde warrior but found the kit severely lacking for aoe tanking (which is what all groups want to do). If groups single targeted and used cc in dungeons, warrior tanking would be much easier
---
 Because of this I rerolled to paladin. Tanking is much easier and less stressful now. While we don't have a proper taunt, it's not really necessary. With the proper talents, holy damage does massive threat in a short period of time and we can always judge sor for a high amount of quick holy damage.
---
It wasn't until lots of casual guilds were in BWL in Vanilla that people understood fury warriors could use leather and mail instead of plate to really optimize their glass cannon.  Even then, it was pretty rare outside the tryhard guilds.
---
That's just Vanish and batching in a nutshell. It's also what allows you to vanish Death Coils and stuff.
---
if you google "rogue vanish bugged" you'll get a million hits that range from today back to 2004.
---
&gt; Back in the days Vanish allowed avoiding getting hit by mid-air spells. Later on you could even negate instant cast spell effects due to short amount of time of immunity Vanish provided, which was added to the game because of rogue players complains about Vanish being randomly broken. This was changed in early Cataclysm after Vanish was reworked into providing unbreakable 3 second Stealth
---
Well, yeah. That's how WoW works. Thing is, you're only going to get IN to Naxx once you already have good gear, or a guild of naxx-geared people boost your through. 
---
&gt; Private servers can deal with it by resets or tbc progression but not Classic. 
---
We have no idea what they're doing after Naxx, but anyone with a lick of common sense knows they'll release TBC servers. As for what happens to Classic as it is? They could probably release new progression servers quite easily whilst maintaining the current ones as "museums". After all, some people will still play through each tier because they want to, even if the one after is available.
---
Shift e and shift f are amazing keybinds
---
The Sunday Breakfast Club is on Ten Storms though. We only raid sundays.
---
Palaret are sadly in the very bottom of the DPS chart, at least in raids, because most of their dps come frm autohit, judgment and... nothing else.
---
However, is it a problem ? Not really. In dungeons, having like 3 retpala as dps won't stop a group to clear the dungeon. 
---
Current raids can be cleared by groups of 20/25 pugs in green. Even if half of a 40 man raid'roster was retpala, they would clean at the end. Having a few retpala won't stop the raid to be a sucess.
---
Also, a paladin bring other things than his damage. Blessings in auras are VERY powerful, and a raid will always welcome a paladin if only for those.
---
Also, yes, paladin leveling is slow. And boring (your only tools are seals, judgments and autohit, at level 60, you'll play as same as in level 14). However, it's also extremely safe and quite easy, given they have mail/plate+healing and ton of panic buttons.
---
For pvp, retpala are absolute murdermachine but need A LOT of gear for that. Before that, they are mostly used as healers : they are extremely good healers (in every area, dungeon, raid, pvp, battleground...) and an extremely powerful duo with the warrior.
---
You can pretty much heal during the entire leveling even without taking point sin holy. However, whatever your spec is, it's usually recommended to take holy first, at least to take consecration, which is mandatory for tanking. Consecration + retribution aura + holy shield (in prot) mean a ton of aoe damage and watching your opponent killing itself.
---
Holy shit i thought the rogue was a respawn. I was wondering why he bothered to frostbolt it.
---
Wont happen
---
Thunder Bluff is where the best stories are told IMO
---
I highly recommend Ctrl/Alt + Mouse Wheel Up &amp; Down for your stuns, silences, etc.

That is the literally the exact response I came here to type lol.

In this thread - retail players taking giant shits on tiny retail players.

All it takes is some distraction, expecting something, or whatever.  If they catch you at the right moment, they can get even the best.  Heck, just look at some of the "news" media out there now, as it'll become harder and harder to distinguish between old Onion/Beaverton/ones for your area from the real news.  If people's guard get down to those levels, then scammers will be rolling in profits hand-over-fist

I‚Äôm dead.

workin on fixing my bad habits one at a time while trying not to wipe MC groups but i hear ya haha
---
Can confirm that &lt;Washed Up&gt; is a cancer guild.
---
Thanks for the input!  I will probably stick with what I've got.  After some more thought and research, I can't justify switching and spending a great deal of time/gold for just one robe.
---
Staff of Dominance is better for smite builds than Anathema.  Checkmate!
---
That's not even many, last night was double.
---
You mean imagine going to a place where prices depend heavily on quantity so the clerk can't tell you the price because you refuse to give him the quantity you're interested in and then acting like the clerk is the problem.
---
Is it still layered? If so they might expect queue times once they remove layers.
---
2 arguments really. The fear of massive economic change, which apparently isn't going to happen as badly as feared, as DM isn't the cash cow it was on private servers. And secondly, the fear that blizzard listening to a few ppl that rush through the game will mean, they will rush through other content as well. I personally don't want BWL this year, aq in spring and naxx before the summer (to exxagerate a bit).
---
i've heard of a run on sentence but never a run on word before.

Yes with full mana and hp

---
Ayyyyy you're the first fellow F key user! I was beginning to think I was all alone haha
---
Why do these kinda players always ignore at the first sign of a mild disagreement or misunderstanding?
---
I saw a guy going nuts in trade claiming "ninja!" because a Warrior had rolled on a level 19 leather chest with strength on it. I whispered him pretty casually suggesting that it's normal for a dps Warrior to use leather, he /w me back an angry response saying how I was wrong and the mention of a leather user in his group, finishing with some insults he put me on ignore before I could reply.  
---
It's like a breed of player, irrational, short tempered and trigger happy with the ignore function.
---
Ya similar to a guild on my server 2 horde one Cup
---
It's actually 17% chance to miss against lvl 63 enemies as the default. Then you want to reach 16% +hit thru talents and gear since you'll always have 1% chance to miss even with 17%hit.
---
However, as a caster in phase 1.5, the max hit a frost mage can get is 9%, 6% from Elemental Precision talent and 3% from gear([Ban'thok Sash](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11662/banthok-sash, [Star of Mystaria](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12103/star-of-mystaria), &amp; [Arcanist Crown](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16795/arcanist-crown)) We'll have to wait for later phases to get any where near the 16% we want.
---
the character whispering him is called Biizard
---
this was proven a myth lol o/
---
Fire resistance will always be helpful for longevity but is really a tank thing. Some fire resistance pots can help for key areas. Otherwise there are pre raid Best in Slot guides all over so aim for those items or similiar ones.
---
happy to help :)
---
Correct me if I'm mistaken, but I think that's an addon called Necrosis?
---
You don't need no group when you're pickpocket farming BRD for 50g/hour.
---
But realistically, you're going to have issues finding groups that don't compete for your loot. Fortunately you get really good weapons from quests at 60 (Maraudon &amp; Scholomance), which are proven to be almost as good as Dal'Rend set weapons.
---
Tbc progression might be a thing though, no ? I sure hope so at least, tbc was my first expansion and I'd like to play it again.
---
Before sharding

What's the mage!

But doesn‚Äôt rock as much as ZZdolf
---
A guy in my guild name is wankybob. He's still not been banned yet.

Also had the binding drop for our raid group last night, Firemaw EU - Horde
---
Seems really crappy of that company to phish it's own employees.
---
Sounds like you just had a shit guild experience lol.
---
You joke, but leveling a female character was eye opening for me.  Sooo many weird/awkward borderline flirty comments in PuGs and preferential treatment.  I couldn't tell if people were RPing or just lonely 14 year old kids.  And constant free stuff.  It got to the point where I'd tell the gifter no thanks and they'd get all whiney until I said I was a dude IRL.
---
Oops - *dont forget to keep slice and dice up!*
---
Can you use spirit healers from graveyards other than the one you start from? Say I have a Night Elf (+50% speed as a wisp), would it be possible to die in Menethil and corpse run to the graveyard in Dun Morogh to get to Ironforge 50% faster?
---
Fury is better because you can get the talent that buffs your damage on a crit, and sit down to force mobs to crit you and force the proc. You can also force your off-hand to have the hit rating of a yellow attack if you queue heroic strike and cancel it at the right times. Those two cheesy techniques make fury better afaik.
---
You have to log out (those inside dungeon) and someone outside the dungeon resets it. Then you log in, you are at the start of the dungeon, with the dungeon being reset.
---
I miss dual spec as a druid haha but its not so bad. I miss the fun achievements like Explore zones , read all the books. Problem was the raiding achievements and everyone asking for them before they would invite.
---
Summoning stones also I do miss them! Especially when you have to replace someone half way through due to disconnect and the replaced person are on the other side of the world.
---
I agree though im a #somechanges some people will say go play retail if you want changes but thats not true, there are huge differences between retail and classic one or two changes dont turn classic in to retail. 
---
Im hoping they do TBC that was when a lot of the best changes were put in.
---
What's on healing duty; we're not talking about him!
---
Keep rolling with Hunter. If you are enjoying the class, you should definitely stick with it.
---
How are you getting sweep to hit both targets? I literally move them so it looks like they are stacked but I never hit the 2nd target. The range is abysmal
---
I don't know!
---
&gt;they're ranked #3 in the world
---
How would you even measure that? The third guild who killed Ragnaros?
---
Welcome to mmorpg's.
---
Been playing mmorpg's for a long time and i've found one needs to set broader long term over arching goals/carrots right at the start or you end up where you are.
---
Example, i already have several alts on the go, in that spread, already planned out what each one is going to do for professions.
---
I'd just suggest rolling several alts till one clicks, you might find you love another class much more than the mage.
---
Fucking aoe farm mages in WPL killed me so many times on those farms.
---
Link to source? Blizzard has said they want vanilla like experience, that includes the amount of people in your world and for that reason the layers held population of vanilla sized realms. There's nothing vanilla like to have 10k-20k people in same layer and what is the population cap on single layer realm then?
---
Its true. You make one tiny mistake its over
---
Nope, the proper tooltip doesn't show up. Instead of the normal ability tooltip it just says the name of the macro (such as Sinister Strike if that is what I named the macro).
---
Anyone use a mouse like this for mouse over/clicking on an add-on like vuhdo?
---
Bracers and back of spell power for warlocks are bis for a long time, not just pre raid.
---
It's melee only. That buff has always been melee only.
---
you could probably do some fun stuff if you got a shaman to follow you around and spam water walking
---
Convert the party to a raid group.
---
Invite a 6th player (a friend or guildy)
---
Have you original 5 party members logout (to character select screen). And stay logged out of like 20 secs.
---
When they are all offline, the 6th player resets all his instances.
---
Now log back in and you will be in a fresh run.
---
I'm at work at the moment so can't remember if the syntax of all this is correct, but...
---
/cast [stance:1] Charge; [stance:3] Intercept
---
That makes it so I can have 1 keybind for charging, changing depending on what stance I'm in.
---
/cast [stance:1/2] Shield Bash; [stance:3] Pummel
---
Same principle - puts both interrupts onto one button, casting whichever is available depending on stances.
---
And then the usual ones to change stance for particular abilities, so I can put an Overpower macro on my Berzerker bar for example. 
---
Also re-bind strafe keys to A and D, freeing up Q and E for more pressing uses, because you should never be keyboard turning anyway ;)
---
Before Naxxramas your best gear is from quests, world drops, dungeons and raids. After Naxxramas 90% of your best gear is from Naxxramas.

Because I am at work atm and just thought about that ...

---
Back it up

I think if it was 'Mistcape' then it would be. Also, Classic came out a couple of years before the first Mistborn book.

People next to each other in the game world exponentially increases load. Having 2 sets of 5000 is easier than 1 load of 10k seeing each others spells and everything.

Never mind, answered my own question

&gt; If you run to a Spirit Healer at another graveyard and ask her to bring you back to life she will do so, but the resurrection sends you back to the graveyard at which you originally spawned as a ghost.

im emulating the true 2004 vanilla experience with my playstyle
---
It would be nice if there was more theorycrafting instead of mindless upvote parties
---
Disagree. 
---
I'm on Deviate Delight, which I believe is one of the lowest pop servers, and it's awesome. People like you on this subreddit keep making chicken little posts about how my server is dead and I need to reroll, but I've not found that to be the case at all.
---
Ive never once had to wait in a que. I've never needed to plan my play time around, or not log off to make a meal, because I needed to plan around getting through a que. I've never had issues finding groups for elite quests or dungeons. Sure, it might be hard to put together a dungeon when I first wake up at 6am EST on a Saturday, but that's my quiet leveling/farming time. Give it a few hours for more people to wake up, and dungeons will be firing off left and right by 9 or 10am.
---
On the topic of farming, I can actually get into the good farming spots from time to time. They aren't being camped 24/7 by multiple other players. I run into other players in the world all the time, both horde and alliance. Enough that I can group up for a quick elite when needed, but not enough that I'm getting ganked constantly (STV notwithstanding!), or that there's never enough gathering resources available.
---
Sure it's really hit or miss to sell those fringe use whites on the AH right now, but it just means that I don't have to waste time AHing tons of junk, and I just vendor a lot of it. In the same vein, it also means that the prices of items on the AH of desirable items is lower, and more affordable. And I still bought my mount at 40 with no issues.
---
I've played on some of the fresh private servers in years past, and that shit is miserable. Barely being able to find enough open copper veins to level your mining skill past 50, fighting just to tag quest mobs against 15 other players, getting ganked every 20 minutes in contested zones, every farm spot being camped day and night, etc. 
---
So there might only be 10 raiding guilds on my server instead of 50 on a high pop server, but so what? 40 out of those 50 guilds are going to all raid in house anyways and I'll never end up grouping with them anyways.
---
It's so much nicer being on a lower pop server imo. And if it ever gets real bad on my server, I'm sure Blizzard will eventually offer paid transfers and I'll just hop over to a more populated one. For my money, I'm going to stick with a lower pop server and never look back.
---
Nigerian princes are getting creative.
---
That happened a couple of days ago to me with an alliance warrior . Since I'm in a PVE server and could not kill him, I had to /spit him.

Wtf is that ui

Idk I was leveling yesterday in ungoro on Golemagg (high pop server) and there were devilsaurs nobody were killing . 3 ALIVE at same time. I have skinning but I was only 52 level. 40g just walking freely in the jungle.
---
Any long queues for Pagel?
---
Spell batching and nothing else.
---
well i know what im doing as soon as i log on today
---
I just log out inside the instance for 8 mins or so and then log back in and I am at the entrance. The I exit, reset and go back inside.
---
As a decently geared lock, druids are still the class I hesitate to start shit with if I know I have to be somewhere I  the next 10 minutes.
---
The rules of your group seemed pretty established to me.
---
Join your realm's discord server. Ask taming it for money. For example "you spawn echeyeke, I tame it and I'll buy your 100g priced ice cold milk from neutral AH"
---
Shaman is an offensive support class and has a hybrid resto/ele spec that can deal a ton of burst while pumping out heals. I would second warlock and maybe throw mage on there.
---
RETAIL IS GONE
---
I haven't got my rogue to 60 yet, but this is what I remember from the old days:  
---
Combat rogues get extra 5% hit through talents and 50% off hand white damage increase. This is huge considering that every missed hit could be a critical hit / apply poison / apply extra sword proc (sword spec). Sinister strike does damage based on your main hand's damage per swing, meaning slower main hand = more sinister strike damage. Daggers in general are a lot faster hitting than swords or maces, making your sinister strike hurt less.   
---
Now imagine being a dagger pve solo leveling rogue, where you dont have the extra 5% hit, 50% off hand damage, extra swings on sword spec, and gimped Sinister strike damage. Instead you get a strong ambush opener and ability to backstab mobs only when and if they run away in fear.   
---
Im surprised everyone's so cool about leveling as dagger rogue because on paper, really, it should suck. Unless, as some one pointed out, you're farming only mobs with low armor, where your ambush opener will compensate for the lacklustre toolkit available to you - its not worth it.
---

Send me a video of your guild doing this, because you‚Äôre the worlds second fastest 40 man Molten Core clear ever.

Surely a guild of your competitiveness records a video of something as serious as a world second fastest clear. (Including vanilla, private servers and classic)

&gt;‚ÄúSo, you sent me an email... to tell me... you can‚Äôt send email?‚Äù
---
I did exactly this - didn't help. It was really blowing my mind.
---
Usually its only level 60's in raids, but every guild has their own rules. We usually do that everyone in the class can roll for setpieces, but you can only win once untill everyone of your class won something (so are you gonna roll on that shitty bracer and win it, or save your roll for the good stuff \^\^)
---
Sure it works or you put ".."
---
just don't use that skill too much, bro. really bad for mental health in the long run.
---
!remind me 7 hours
---
Cannot imagine how cozy can this be while it is raining... Nice job!
---
But you can take out your weapon and it doesn't break on attack so you can stun/slap horde with a fish.
---
It does seem to happen with the first character I log into when I first start/run the game. After that first character I can log out and switch to others and it doesn't happen to the others, just that first guy.
---
Sounds fine. Priority on 60s because anything lower should probably be out, y'know, leveling to 60.
---
You can use them in RP. But just dropping a random /bow when everyone is obviously out of character is equivalent to running up to someone and using /lick.
---
Sure it's a emote but it doesn't necessarily mean you or the other guy are in character. So it's hardly roleplaying. 
---
Most RPers will use /e to make custom emotes rather than use the default ones the game offers, unless it's something very simple like a quick nod that doesn't need any detail or the like. I've never seen /bow used in RP, usually they'll do "/e bows his head, "thank you friend", before turning to mount his horse." Or something like that.
---
Whats confusing about this?
---
I had a buddy who used to do this on a warlock back in....BC? Maybe wrath. Same spot in IF. Folks would tip him. It was a great time.
---
Cata
---
Never understood how someone would want to play as a dwarf...
---
There is one but I think it's impossible to attain. The difference between the attacker's weapon skill and the target's defense skill determines the chance to hit, crit, get parried, blocked and dodged. This is why tanks get defense in tbc/wotlk when it was reworked to become uncrittable, and you might also know that defenses increases your chance to parry, dodge, block and increases the chance that attacks miss you. It's the same the other way around. The parry and block chance won't matter much since you're attacking in the bosses' backs, but you gain hit, crit, and get dodged less. That's enough for weapon skill to be worth way more than any other stat.
---
I don't know the exact stats so I won't be able to help you there. About hit, I think dual wielding has an atrocious chance to hit, it must be something like 30% chance to miss, at least for your offhand, but your yellows have 5% chance to miss and idk about your main hand.
---
I can guess luck bringer in here, but no idea what the first part is.
---
Exactly
---
Male troll immediately followed by female undead
---
The strongest 1v1 class in the game.
---
Just one in the middle would be fine, same as Felwood.
---
I would bet money that the OPs character is female, and in this guys mind that /bow was the start of something that would have ended in the upstairs floor of the goldshire inn.
---
I consider myself a rational person, I know why people choose swords... but damn I just love daggers. :)
---
Daggers all the way.
---
Hot garbage
---
I bet you are someone who was actually able to log into the game. My guild jumped ship because the queues at primetime for people getting home from work was unplayable.
---
Blizzare?
---
&gt; Because now you are spending time leveling up/loyalty up on two pets?
---
The horror! You spend enough time at each level to level up all 3 of your pets if you want, and the loyalty is trivial. I'm not sure why you even thought this was a valid argument. And besides that, since having an owl instead of a carrion bird only increases your kill speed by 2-3% when you're alone it's going to be less than a 1% difference in dungeon clear speed between having an owl or carrion bird.
---
&gt;And we are comparing pets, not hunter stats. I'm not comparing owl to your hunters overall damage, I'm comparing it directly to carrion.
---
Which is kind of nonsense. What matters is your overall damage output. Your pet doing 7% more damage doesn't mean you kill things 7% faster.
---
&gt;And there is a huge gap between rank 1 and rank 2 and rank 3 of screech(16 levels between each one, then 8 levels for rank 3-&gt;4), so holding agro is harder without that extra dps. You can try to micro taunt and autocast screech on 2-3 targets, but growl has an 8 second cooldown. Its harder with a carrion bird to control agro.
---
I'm really not sure what makes you think a carrion bird's screech doesn't work as well as an owl's. The threat from the damage is tiny since it only deals that damage to the main target, the aoe threat is entirely from the AP reduction which is identical between both. Again, the vast majority of your pet's threat comes from growl and screech's AP reduction, not from the actual damage your pet is dealing.
---
&gt;And the whole point of screech is to group pull AND hold agro while leveling to speed things up. Your DPS doesn't matter if you pull agro on 1-2 of the mobs, and can't ranged attack.
---
This is actually entirely, 100% wrong. It's actually *ideal* for you to pull a mob off your pet. Then you can continue ranged attacking the mobs on your pet while weaving in melee hits on the target that you have aggro on. You want to talk about killing mobs as quickly as possible? That's how you do it.
---
&gt;And that extra armor generates exactly 0% threat, while also -7% dps is generating less threat, and then your dps talents for your pet are generating -7% dps less threat
---
Why are you trying to act like the gap is somehow bigger than 7% because of talents? It's not, it's a flat 7% and the talents don't change that. Once again, that means you're only putting out 2-3% more damage overall with the exact same talents.
---
I had no idea John Leguizamo sang that song.
---
Coming across a little entitled there. 
---
Why not just roll on a PVE ream to begin with? If it‚Äôs such a big deal for you to continue playing.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôd buy the epic mount as soon as I could afford it.  Even if I wasn‚Äôt 60 yet.  It will prevent me from buying stupid shit in the AH.
---
I use ElvUI and it has options for showing some pretty detailed information about my target's buffs/debuffs. However, ElvUI is a full UI replacement so it's probably not what you are looking for.
---
Wow that's amazing!
---
The best style is braided pubes
---
Honestly, I'd recommend giving Bloodsail Buccaneers (RP-PvE) a try.  There are some guilds that are more into RP, but for the majority of the population RP is secondary to gameplay, so don't let the 'RP' part scare you away.   During the initial couple weeks when most realms had large queues, a lot of people rolled on BB to get in game quicker.  Some of them left, but a lot found that it's a good server and stayed.  Folks on both faction sides seem to be generally good-natured.  
---
The economy doesn't seem to be 'ruined'.  There aren't nearly as many rush-to-60 type guilds/players as it seems there are on other servers (though this could just be observer bias since I'm going off 2nd-hand info regarding other servers).  We still have 2 layers but no queue, so there are plenty of folks around.  Based on old census data, it looks like BB is around 60/40 alliance/horde.
---
You're
---
BWL will be a bit more challenging.  MC was always a snoozefest.  I'm hoping they don't drag the phases out too long.
---
Haha yeah, I agree. I used to have Blood fury there but healers didn't like me popping it all the time so i shoveled it away to 5 (to prevent the habit).
---
This setup really isn't all that good for others. I've played WoW since mid-TBC and my go to interrupt/CC button has always been G for some reason. I had kidney shot on Shift+G at first but i ended up using it without caring or not thinking about CP for it, so i moved it down with the other finishers.
---
Same with F - It's usually mobility/CCbreak related spells, in this case it's Sprint and Evasion.
---
Once i get back from work I'll post a screenshot on the layout of my bars etc if you or anyone else is looking for inspiration hehe.
---
Just buy a dreamweave circlet at 45, it's much better anyways.
---
Those shoulders are just part of every cloth player's starter pack. Not much better for awhile.
---
Related PSA: No it isn't dumbass. Be correct about mail or GTFO.
---
I use and recommend Puggle for finding groups. It parses any chat you are in for group requests and adds them to a really handy screen. You can easily see what dungeons people are looking for, along with the message they posted. You can easily whisper them and /who them from this screen too. 
---
On top of all this, it keeps track of who you‚Äôve grouped with before and let‚Äôs you rate them and add a comment to them so you know in the future if you had a good or bad experience with them.
---
True, but it doesn‚Äôt feel significant when your 20 or 30 total spell damage at low level gets spread over 6 mobs. More mana and health feels like the way to go until level cap.
---
I think a larger shadow to this is that a lot of folks know that warlocks can be really strong in pvp outside of even using health potions.
---
These are all attempts to try and balance the 1v1 scene. I honestly don't know how i feel about this but then again it would be hilarious to see 75% of duelist rolling warlocks.
---
Mom says i'm special.
---
frost novaed and no blind or vanish. feelsbadman
---
Yeah what an absolutely depraved way to live. Despicable really.
---
shimmering flats. mob density is high so you will get a ton of kills. Get there thru 1k needles
---
You can't see buffs on enemies. There's a mage spells that can display enemy buffs (Detect Magic), but apart from that you'll have to guess based on visuals and casts. It's just a vanilla thing.
---
TBH nothing compares to The Barrens (at least Horde-side). For the level range though you can go to Silverpine and then into Stonetalon/Ashenvale/Hillsbrad.
---
Because otherwise they can just handout the 50000 $ to an SL warlock and skip the tedious tournament.
---
I can find formulas but I'm not really interested with them. I have some idea how I want my character to be, so I'm using stamina, armour, block and avoidance as my main priority. And in doubt I'll use better looking item.
---
Wait, are you telling me the final tier in game will drop gear that exceeds all than previous tiers in power level?
---
:thinking:
---
Ok thanks! That‚Äôs what i figured.
---
It‚Äôs the Great Value brand Winnie ‚ÄúWeenie the Poe‚Äù
---
Reminder! 12 hours
---
I transferred to benediction when it was low. Now it's a kick ass server
---
I lold
---
So I should be punished for making the decision to roll on a pvp server? I made my decision and now that it's imbalanced for the horde I should be the one to remedy the situation? 
---
If it was vice versa and the Ally far outnumbered the horde I would not have transfered.
---
Did it get fixed ? It was reported to work at some point.
---
Onyxia scale cloak on as many people in the raid as possible
---
I'm not sure what you mean by "strictly holy". As priests, we usually never get our last 2 big abilities because of how marginal and terrible waste they are (Spirit of Redemption and Lightwell).
---
The normal holy build for min/max is to go down holy get 5 points in spiritual guidance and healing. Then go down disc until you get divine spirit.
---
Hoped that answered your question!
---
&gt; Is there any benefit if you're mainly fighting mobs at/below your level?
---
Yes.  Not as much as against higher level mobs (at least talking about melee/dual wield).
---
I don't get behind that. If it's part of the class, it's not unfair or anything. It's part of the class's strengths.
---
It's akin to saying you want to ban totems because only shamans can have those, or paladin's bubble because they become invulnerable while still hitting you.
---
That's not unfair, just part of the class.
---
I leveled from 45ish to 60 as holy so I could easily heal dungeons. Id really recommend getting wand damage and spirit tap thought so questing isn't miserably slow.
---
You actually still see it exactly like OP has shown here with them blocked.
---
A lot of times it boils down to Who You Know. Heck, most of the time it comes down to this! Not saying people can't work their way up in companies, but especially in medium-sized operations or smaller, it boils down to who you know beforehand or the people you've befriended in your time there. Even if you're a stand-out employee, you're unlikely to climb the ladder if you haven't gotten in good with the Right People.
---
I didn't get my job (accounting, soon to be supervisor for the dept) because I'm tech savvy (I know more than most people but it's not like I'm IT), or because I'm particularly good at math (I'm not), because I'm amazing on a 10-key (I had never used one before starting here), or due to experience in the field (never worked in construction/aggregates before and couldn't have told you the difference between 3/4 clean stone and medium rip rap). I got my job because the company is a family company. My MIL is my boss (until she retires in a few months, putting me in charge).
---
When I applied, there were over 70 other applicants. I know how I got this job. It wasn't 'cause I was more qualified. In my defense, I do my best, work hard, and am good at leading teams and delegating tasks, so I've gotten really good at the job. But nobody, not even my mother-in-law, could have known that about me. (She'd met me like, three times when she got me this job.)
---
I haven't been with toxic players yet. I even have my wife healing.  Shes never played any mmo and I havent played WoW in years. We were slow and wiped once or twice. Nobody said anything and they stuck around for the whole instance. Im sure there are the toxic players, but not as bad as live WoW.
---
Just a quick correction the WF weapon buff on an enhance shaman is 466 extra ap.
---
Still stuck in class paralysis. So my current thoughts are about shadow priests.
---
As far as end game is concerned... Does playing shadow afford me many options outside of PvP? Do I simply have to respec to be an effective raid participant if a guild doesn't want me in shadow?
---
Do they reign supreme throughout all the phases or is there a hard fall off after like bwl?
---
Imagine if there was some kind of print screen button on your computer that you could somehow press to take a screen shot :0
---
Does summoning not work inside Dire Maul (all people already inside the instance)? I tried in DM:E and DM:N and the summoned party was not able to accept it either time. Is that intended or a bug?
---
So your theory is that these Alliance moved based on rumors and not their own experiences of leveling on Skeram? That seems far-fetched to me but even if true it doesn't change the fact that the options of those players were dictated by Blizzard. Those players didn't create the situation they were just reacting as they thought best. They weren't trying to screw over the server just like you (or some other Horde) weren't trying to do so when you ganked that Ally just once but it was their eighth time while trying to finish the same quest so they logged off in frustration and never came back. 
---
Blizzard did a shitty job launching Classic. They are to blame and not the people picking between shitty options.
---
Someone needs to reset the instance while other players are inside but logged off.
---
If you are going to solo it, ask someone to invite your and your 2nd character so you can reset it by yourself.
---
fucking carebears
---
just because you don't understand it yet :D
---
Dude your replies are SO FUCKING lackluster. Nobody can offer a suggestion other than A FUCKING BACKSTORY AND SERVER. WHAT THE FUCK KIND IF BULLSHIT. DUDE, YOU ARE ACTING LIKE A FKIN TROLL. I ALSO ALREADY KNOW HOW TO JOIN A SERVER YOU FKIN TROLL. IBVIOUSLY I NEED TO JOIN A SERVER. OBVIOUSLY. EVERYTHING YOU SAID WAS LITERALLY ALREADY KNOWN. I FUCKING SAID IT ALL IN THE INTIAL FUCKING POST YOU FUCKING IDIOT! YOU LITERALLY TYPED ALL THAT OUT JUST SO THAT YOU CAN SUGGEST I FIND A GUILD WHEN MY PURPOSE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF THIS ORIGINAL POST WAS TO FIND A FUCKING GUILD. HOLY SHIT DUDE. EVEN THE COMMENT RIGHT BEFORE YOUR LAST COMMENT WAS MEANT TO FULFILL THE SAME THING(I think).
---
In the World of Warcraft Diary there's a part where he mentions that they had performance issues with players on the ground and flight paths over head in certain areas, so they strategically routed the flight paths to avoid areas where it was causing performance issues.  I wonder how many of the long winding paths are scenic routes v.s. the performance considerations.
---
Yet its not the case for Molten Core or Blackwing Lair. So the game before Naxxramas was designed poorly because best gear didnt come from one place?
---
As a side note ressing at a spirit healer can still be beneficial (levelling 1-10) as it‚Äôs a fast trip back to town. And no rez sickness!
---
Nope.  Before Naxx your best gear is from quests, world drops, dungeons and raids.  After Naxx your best gear remains to be from quests, world drops, dungeons and raids. Since Naxx is simply just another raid.  It doesn't exist outside of this progression cycle.
---
That‚Äôs an odd way to spell Everquest
---
Op is talking to advertising bot...
---
no u
---
They all share a cooldown, so unless the duel lasts over 2 minutes, they can only use one.
---
If you're only going to Rend you can probably tank it at 58/59 assuming you've been collecting prot gear out of BRD/LBRS. Mob packs after Rend are a lot harder. As DPS You can go in whenever they'll take you.
---
unless they have world trades blocked.
---
No, I Dont Know is the Hunter
---
I think it‚Äôs the best major city. I don‚Äôt have too many major gripes about locations for things and the layout makes it easy to get to anywhere from anywhere compared to other cities. 
---
Visually I love Stormwind, but the way canals break up pathing and where things are located can be infuriating. Same with Thunderbluff.
---
I pretty much just hate all of the other ones. Except Undercity because I never go there enough to even have an opinion.
---
2 things:  
---
1st scroll out further and you wouldve seen the mage coming  
---
2nd use a switchmakro to get that fucking sword in you mainhand so sinister strike gets its full value and you can keymacro the switch back for backstab/ambush
---
If i make regular macro lets say . 
---
/cast Heroic strike I see some ppl set (rank 5) is this needed? or will he use highest rank? 
---
BR
---
He wanted his RP to (d)evolve into eRP
---
There entire guild layer changed last night in BRM to avoid a 50+ PvP battle and I‚Äôve had my share of issues with individuals in dungeons.  &lt;Washed Up&gt; is a bunch of try-hard retailers who don‚Äôt give a fuck about the community.
---
No they are not but the suggestion of Silverpine is when combined with others mentioned.
---
Oh boy, 40+ is like a whole new world for you both. 20 is like super slow and boring and shitty. You are in for a treat.
---
Also says UC is the Ruins of *Lodaeron*, I don't think this guide is as accurate as you think.
---
If you are not against using addons, I \*highly\* recommend that you get Necrosis.  Necrosis is a warlock-specific addon that provides a lot of quality of life improvements for locks, including an audio 'shadow trance' message whenever shadow trance pops, as well as a moveable popup icon.  It also identifies when mobs are immune to banish or fear and gives you a new ui element that automatically provides buttons for your curses, pets, health/soulstones, and situational spells (e.g, unending breath, detect invis, demon aromr) and updates the ranks of spells associated with those buttons automatically.
---
since there isn't any paladin in horde, a priest is the closest thing you have to a paladin
---
Hoard the minion tokens, start turning them in at Revered.
---
Wasn't in the same with pservers? I remember selling lesser invis pots to a hunter, who was buying them "in case of FD resists in DM".
---
They are arguably thee best 1v1 PvP class in this phase. They have insane burst and utility.
---
Warlock is much harder but still feasible.
---
Imagine assuming I've played wow for 15 years and I'm not just someone who has spent some time reading class guides and knowing what quests I have.
---
Any information if there will be cross language transfers? Started on an english server because one friend of mine played on it. He quit after a couple of days and I would prefere going to a german server now because communication is much easier for me ofc
---
The item icons are share across multiple items. Making 15914 icons (plus abilities) would be kind of tiresome and not really that important. The hat is cool though.
---
It depends what you want to do; you don't sound that enthusiastic about healing, due to their non-healing performance. So here's some options for you...
---
* For open-world DPS, Smite Priest is probably the best (whilst still being a healer for dungeons / raids), without sacrificing much in the way of healing, as you just grab a few talents as you progress the Holy tree anyway.
---
* The Ele / Resto Shaman hybrid (30/0/21) can heal pretty well as long as you're smart, and absolutely blows people up in PvP with Spell Damage gear. Later raid tiers you *might* get pressured into respeccing for Mana Tide totem though, which is deep Resto. 
---
* For Druid, you got the HotW build in Cat or Tank flavours. Out the two, the Tank one is preferred for raids. Whilst the Cat is better for WPvP. Like with the Shaman hybrid, you have to be extra smart as you're sacrificing some healing efficiency. You have practically no downtime however, due to gaining mana whilst in forms. 
---
* Paladin has the most issues though. You'd pretty much never die, but you kill incredibly slow. There is a bit of a Shockadin build for some PvP burst, but historically wasn't as much of a thing (if for no other reason than being the best PvP healer). However this usually means you lack some highly desired things in raids (mostly Blessing of Kings, etc). But this could be no issue if you find a raid team where you cover the Improved Wisdom Blessings or something similar. 
---
But if you'd rather not be the healbot / Blessing bot, you could have a harder time finding a spot...
---
* Shadow Priest is perhaps the most desired, but only 1 per raid team for the Shadow Weaving. 
---
* Next is probably a Feral Cat Druid. Though beware; to pull satisfactory numbers you'd need to grind Gnomeregan for Manual Crowd Pummelers as they are BIS forever for Feral Cats but only have 3 charges. To sweeten your value to the raid, you should be fine with doing some healing or tanking when called upon. 
---
Sadly, the other specs aren't as much of a thing. Now you definitely may find a spot as an Enhancement Shaman, or Retribution Paladin, etc. Just be aware that these specs aren't really desired. And would likely be stuck on some unfun duties. Such as Totem Twisting for the Shaman, and/or being the Nightfall wielder. These ones will likely have the lowest priority on gear, too.
---
Poetry? This reminds me of a legendary (read: infamous) haiku poetry contest hosted on the Crushridge US forums. I have included a sample below.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/o6hbrFn.png](https://i.imgur.com/o6hbrFn.png) (NSFW)
---
It will automatically use the highest rank
---
Well in my opinion the Alliance are evil!
---
I feel like that's how a lot of the newer realms that opened are. Its filled with people that play at prime time and couldn't play the game for the first 2-3 weeks because of queues and jumped ship. So dead during the day when no lifes play but packed at night
---
This made me laugh out loud at work and everyone was staring at me. Thank you though i needed that
---
If you look at the itemization in the raid tiers it's clear that 
---
Blizzard slowly iterated on itemization as time went on, and simply got better at it.  Naxxramas is literally the end-game of itemization for classic, it's where they were best at it and made very few pure garbage straight DE loot.
---
Vendorstrike, anyone?
---
Hahahahahaha
---
I'm a little jealous.  I haven't gotten a bubble-hearth yet in classic.  It's a badge of honor.
---
I‚Äôm not sure what class you are, but I‚Äôm a Druid and respecced deep into resto 13/0/38. Makes healing dungeons a breeze. You can‚Äôt really solo farm much, so I just farm dungeons. Scholomance being the best, followed by strat love, the. UD. Though this worked for me since I have a few guild tanks who needed items and money so they always ran with me when I wanted.
---
I had the same problem as alliance. Had people yell at me to buff them with MotW. I‚Äôm a warrior. I know the purple hair and pointy ears makes people think Druid, but I just hit things with sticks and yell a lot.
---
nah i'm good dude
---
Bizzare? **OH SHIT IS THAT A MOTHER FUCKING JOJO REFERENCE?!**
---
Ah okay, is that at 60 with the +ap talents?
---
If you really love her level up a horde and get to the quest
---
Right there with ya brother. Baby dings 9 months soon. It gets better. Just remember these times will pass. It seems tough now but you‚Äôll likely look back fondly on it. Good luck
---
big brains stick with staves
---
Can confirm. 
---
Bonus as ele for Ele MAstery crit spell batch, two shots about 80% of the tim.
---
I wish they did it for low pop realms too I started on bloodsail and would really love to move my main there where all my friends play but I can‚Äôt even pay to transfer which I would gladly do. Idk why they don‚Äôt offer paid transfers would make them some good money
---
Aaah right, They did that. That is fair, i did completely forget that. My chatbox i usually have open also is t configured to show those kinda messages.
---
But even the range of the normal druids further in the instance felt strangely huge.
---
Is that just highway blindness from mainly playing on lvl 60 atm? Kinda HAS to be right?
---
I remember one that made your floppy disc drive rev as fast as it could for as long as the script ran. It. Was. Terrifying.
---
Have you tried it? Because what you said is incorrect. The key you are holding before hitting enter doesn't spam the chat.
---
It doesn't work for any instance in classic.
---
Playing horde on Westfall and it's pretty busy
---
I don‚Äôt know for him but I followed a friend who wanted to play on a PvP realm. Now he doesn‚Äôt play anymore and I just want to get out of this hell.
---
And missing abilities sucks in general. Like poly.
---
In this example the clerk doesnt give you a price and he doesnt tell you how big his supply is.
---
How is it not the clerks fault?
---
Does it drop like loot off mobs? Or is it a book on the ground you click?
---
Your best gear before Naxx is from other places outside raids because raid gear lacks stats like hit and crit. Nearly every item from Naxx has hit and crit + higher stats then anything else.
---
&gt;my brain often doesn't know the appropriate time to question a person's motives 
---
I swing completely in the other direction. I'm so paranoid of being a gullible idiot that I question EVERYTHING ALL THE TIME. I try not to assume the worst right out of the gates, but the entirety of the CIA could show up at my door and I wouldn't answer the door because they're probably lying about who they are. :')
---
Stonks
---
I use a non-functional macro with just a #showtooltip \[item\] line so I can place it on the hotbar, but I don't know how high a quantity that can display (I use it for flash/blinding powder, so generally 2 digits).
---
It was fixed. /sit will still result in a crit, but that crit will not give you any buffs related to being crit.
---
I didn't know dwarfs could ride horses in vanilla.
---
I tend to only really use it on major releases not that often lol as it does leave me feeling rough for a weekend
---
Im level 41 with only 72 gold, bout to try selling portals while im at work lol
---
We still have 2 layers but layers don‚Äôt affect queue, queue depends on the number of players on the server not on each layer.
---
Area 52 is connected to two other realms (effectively merged, but you get to keep your name). So about 2/3 of people appear to be from another realm, while they are on the same realm in all but name.
---
Really wondering about that too.
---
Im 59 and 2 bars away from 60. Currently full-feral.
---
I'm really curious about how much better my healing would be in a real heal-spec. But at the same time, losing my cat- and bear-capabilities is a frightening thought. So maybe the 0-30-21-compromise it is. :o
---
But as I said, I really wanna try 24-0-27 too. Or even go right ahead and get the 8-11-32 PvP-Healer-build. Maybe that one wouldn't be too bad, as I'd still have rage-cost-reduction and feral-charge.
---
Depends on your guild. If you can make sure you're the guy bringing Shadow Weaving, you're good. But they won't need more than one person bringing it.
---
Hunter is fun. It's great for solo farming and some cool gimmick dungeon solo farms too. If you like being top meters and crushing everyone it's probably not the class for you. We do really well at the start of gearing but i'd real tough to stay up there once the raid catches up gear wise.
---
We do have some ways to keep up top with FD trinket swaps and stuff but eventually we will fall off just due to scaling. Pets are also obnoxious trying to keep alive even with the perfect setup. Tier bonuses do help a bit here.
---
We bring really good utility. You will be expected to kite some big encounters (not really hard or anything. I kinda like it to take the pressure off sometimes).
---
All in all it's a really fun class. PVP you really have to work for your kills but you'll stand out if you make it work. Personally, I wish I rolled a rogue though! :P
---
This looks like someone's about to start giving a slideshow presentation.
---
When I had my dog, I used that time to take him for a short walk He loved flight paths!
---
That happens to me too. Not sure why.
---
The quickest way to fix it is to open the macro book and just click on each macro once. Once you click on it once in the 'book' the tooltip loads in correctly.
---
Air traffic regulations, don't want to fly over an active warzone.
---
He called out his own DPS. So either it was bad or he is even more clueless than even he stated. And maybe bad is the wrong word, I should've said oblivious or non-attentive. Every time I've run a dungeon I've read through the quests to make sure I know what I have to get and where. This is even easier if you have questie. So yeah, forgetting to loot a boss is a pretty bad move.
---
Yeah, this is why flying in retail is faster. Point your mount in the direction of the destination and within a few min you will be at your destination.
---
Take a gryphon and that dumbass bird-lion thing will do loopdy loops and shit, taking way longer than it needs to be. I still prefer this to flying mounts, though.
---
lol no they aren't.
---
They wanted fear ward from me in classic.
---
But that's additional work if you're not expecting players to actually play in that area. Far simpler to just route them through the already worked on zone.
---
\#nOcHaNgEs
---
I've spend around 11 golds  in ah buys when I finally could buy my mount at level 43. Half of that to get the mats for the warrior quest to get a nice weapon.
---
Dont forget to loot the water boss when u have the quest.
---
Thats classic, there is no lategame beside grinding or pvp
---
i second Pagel. I never get any ques either
---
A guildmate of mine was giving away the new water for an hour in orgrimmar. People were literally queueing up, while he was getting angry whispers from other mages.
---
Because it worked fairly fine up until stranglethorn, then it all went to hell.
---
Didn't know it was such an impossible task to kill people that ganked you, was never a problem on retail/private servers.
---
Not gonna reroll a character i spent 300 hours on.
---
lol isn‚Äôt that how you are supposed to read it? 200g its cheaper than ah where it would be around 250g
---
Yeah man. I level as arms but the meta slaves are the worst part about classic. I understand minmaxing and I appreciate the theorycrafters that make my favorite guides, but still..
---
I kind of agree. I've been following a leveling guide this time around and in the interest of efficiency I'm just constantly stacking up completed quests and grinding. When I finally get to fly somewhere it's a bit of a relief because I can relax for a few minutes.
---
&gt; I've played WoW since mid-TBC and my go to interrupt/CC button has always been G for some reason
---
Ah well that makes sense. I mained a rogue from Vanilla - Cata and I always used the same set of key bindings that I loved. Everything was perfectly placed
---
Problem is, I have no idea what any of it was. My memory of it completely wiped somehow lol. So now i'm just looking for new ideas haha
---
I will keep this in mind.  I plan to start a new toon tonight and will pick one of the servers that gets recommended here.
---
My plan is to play my current PvP toon during off times and then play my new toon on a PvP server when I can't play my PvP toon.
---
Trying not to sub an account for 1 horde to level but if i must guess i will.
---
I can imagine doing that.
---
Are we going to pretend that he hasn't already killed 100's of mobs to get to level 20 as well as looted dozens, if not hundreds, of quest items?
---
28 levels is likely at least 40+ hours played. It may not seem like much in WoW timelines but remember that‚Äôs the entire game life span for modern AAA games.
---
Where would be a good start to look? I tried finding a druid "mentor" in my server, but no luck so far.
---
Why do people post them on Reddit instead of just /ignoring them? Life is full of mysteries
---
I know the quest can be shared once it has been picked up, so you might be able to do it at 57, but not pick up the quest, maybe?
---
They are so dumb only allow transfers for the faction that is unbalanced via the heavy side
---
They just gave up in WoD where flight paths literally went THROUGH the ground. Those flight paths still weren't fixed ever since I last played the game earlier this year.
---
Or you could make a minor effort  to communicate with other humans and get it done in about 15 minutes with little effort.
---
They probably meant in pvp.  In unorganized pvp, undead racials are generally considered superior, while trolls are better in group settings.
---
Pvp tournaments aren't fair to begin with unless it's class specific.
---
Even without a healthstone warlocks are going to be rough opponents.
---
Brilliant, I'll do just that.
---
There will no longer be any incetive to run any other dungeon or raid after Naxx. Why bother trying to get 1 good weapon from Molten Core when there is 6 better weapons in Naxxramas and one or two will always drop.
---
It does work.
---
Undercity is basically Ironforge unless you're an alchemist and then it's a pain in the ass
---
It's much safer with 8 tanks, but there are other strats.
---
Enjoy having less people to kill on whatever low pop realm you left to.
---
Gold runs where a common thing back than, its a win-win.
---
Glad I decided to drop the french flag for once, I‚Äôm really enjoying interacting with the rosbeefs
---
It still works afaik
---
Totally agree, there was no issue in the first place I just wanted some outside perspective. Seems like anytime you ask an honest question about this game theres alot of hardcore dudes ready to call you a whiney noob.
---
Yeh yeh, the ol' prescriptive vs. descriptive linguistics debate.
---
I know many people nowadays use it as a name for an unfair fight instigated by the party with a strong advantage. Anything from picking off low-health players to lvl 60s one-shotting levelers in STV.
---
I do think that's not exactly how the word "ganking" *should* be used, but I recognize that it is how it's actually used.
---
Thank you, that worked like a charm!
---
The Earthfury ally are all hiding in Booty Bay team ganking horde 20 levels below them.
---
Shoutout to Mazzie on Bloodfang EU for helping me out!
---
Lol he doesn‚Äôt even have a tank or a key.
---
Maybe you didn‚Äôt read article. But that server is not an option for any realm to transfer too
---
Do you think he's a goblin engineer?
---
My favorite go to is:
---
/Moon
---
/Shake
---
Thanks, now i know where I am needed
---
Would help if you described what it is you *do* want.
---
Idk tbh cant imagine myself ever paying for that shit. Used to sell tank runs in wrath for badges but I mean that was because it got you instant ques.
---
It's not that we refuse to understand that druids can tank, it's that we have multiple warriors lining up to tank and they can do the job better for raids.
---
I wanted to believe you, but I couldn't because you can't work 25hours a day. The rest, I could believe!
---
Very efficient use of time!
---
Generally speaking, you should continue playing and find like-minded players to befriend, do dungeons or quests together, and see if someone in the open world that you meet could get you into their guild, if it sounds good to you :). Finding a guild is much easier even just knowing that *one* member, because they can bridge the gap and help you find comfort socialising with people.
---
Casually ‚Äúi have ironfoe in my main hand‚Äù :/
---
"welcome to 60 bitch"
---
We need our own version of /r/cutenoobs where we post all the cute things that noobs do
---
I don't think they'll do anything like this with Classic. If anything they'll try and get people to transfer to Retail as it's already part of the culture there. What I could see though, is some of  those services become a thing -- paid server transfers, etc.
---
That sounds pretty nice to me. I'll admit I haven't tried an RP server before, and I wasn't sure what to expect from one. I'm a very casual smell-the-roses kind of player, and I don't think I'd mesh well with stricter RP stuff. But if it's secondary for most I'll probably be alright! I don't want to break anybody's immersion, hah
---
Thanks for the feedback! I'll consider it \^_\^
---
That's just normal. Most people are probably going to raidlog until phase 2 comes out.
---
 /rasp highly underrated. Makes a farting noise. Highly recfomended. 8.3/10
---
Er... No. That isn't what I was saying. You presented these things as being rare. They were not. It was just a different time where it was a lot easier to avoid knowledge by simply not looking for it, rather than today where you are actively bombarded with it from all sides and there's an expectation of what to expect. That made it very easy for there to be a massive disconnect between those in the know and those who weren't as well as the knowledge being a lot more compartmentalized and spread out, rather than simply being able to google up a class guide and know the ins and outs of the mechanics and everything you need to know within one self-contained source.
---
I did.  You can't do anything about competitors having their friends report you
---
Doesn't work on opposing faction. If it's a manual emote, all they see is something like "so and so making strange gestures."
---
Jesus dude let it go. It‚Äôs not a big deal. Your first post never asked about for a guild. You never specified region or faction or that you‚Äôd change servers. Nobody offered you guild because that isn‚Äôt what you asked. I didn‚Äôt only say to create a back story. I also laid out step by step instructions that would‚Äôve already had you in a guild. 
---
You asked for a guild in this thread and guess what? You got an invite and another asking about region.
---
‚ÄúAs a tank it took me 20 mins to find a group for BRD‚Äù
---
Oh boy... how I wish I found a group so fast. It‚Äôs usually 20 mins for the tank alone, if lucky!
---
Delet dis
---
Because the clerk kept asking how many they were interested in and the customer refused to answer.
---
If by strict holy you mean 31+ points into Holy, you are doing it wrong. Nothing in there is worth that many points. 
---
* Spiritual Guidance &amp; Spiritual Healing: provide insane throughput which is not needed in the current phase. That may change in AQ or Naxx, but most certainly not now.
---
* Redemption is sub par and Lightwell is a waste of a point.
---
* You need to go half way into Discipline anyway to pick up important Talents like Meditation and Inner Focus.
---
=&gt; You need to spend \~14 points in Disc and \~18 in Holy and then you can go from there to what you like. Whatever you do, going "full holy" will make your life miserable since you are missing out on the fun parts of the class and invest in lots of talents that don't do anything for you.
---
Here is an example of a "bare bones" healing build: [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/05023013-0150510303](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/05023013-0150510303)
---
300 is a bit dramatic. 
---
Classic isn‚Äôt for everyone.
---
I've done something similar on a normal PvP. Was in stonetalon by the harpies, 3 of us waiting for our 4th to run to a turn in and come back. I had campfire mats on me so just dropped it, and decided to start telling "scary stories" since October. Passed out the rum I had fished up too lol. Had 3-4 others that were nearby stop and join our campfire to hear the story of mishmash- the orc kidnapped by gnomes and tortured with a shower.
---
I fucking love getting downvoted in a classic sub by people who are apparently playing classic about an opinion that they should not change iconic places in an iconic game. Absolutely stunning to me. Regardless I‚Äôm not going to change my opinion.
---
You can now trade items that you won with others in your group? When did this happen?
---
1. It's not slow to level, it's actually pretty average. Faster than warrior but slower than mage. I believe most of the problem with ret is it starts to fall off in raids with gear.  
---
2. Haven't PvP'd with Pally.  
---
3. Reflected damage basically. Holy Shield, ret aura, shield spike, thorns if you can, consecration, etc. It's not nearly as fast as mage but you can turn around and tank dungeons pretty easily.
---
Ya, but steady dps means opponents can anticipate on it, while windfury comes out of nowhere messing up opponents routine
---
Thanks for taking the time to respond! It‚Äôs appreciated.
---
OK so got a horde who logged on and let me summon it. Thxs to him very much! He messaged me in discord after a few spams of the server discord. Laters taters!
---
I've had the same issue since the last Questie update.
---
How does x realm transfers not based in specific factions solve faction imbalance? Seems it could easily do the opposite. And as to cross realm BG ques-well this ONLY helps the faction that already has the numbers advantage!
---
Old Blanchy DnT/GNP?
---
Cross faction collusion, someone report
---
Warlock also has a class quest
---
Agreed! I really enjoy the horde! I really don't enjoy subjecting myself to most of the people who play them though!
---
Give yourself more credit. Tanking is not actually that hard. Getting the raid to listen to you and not go balls to the wall on dps before you have threat IS difficult lol.
---
druid can no longer farm due to lasher immune to nature, and lasher loot is nerfed, and since a portion of the money made is from living essence but it's 2.5 gold now so rip that.
---
There's also been reports by hunters that tribute runs are much harder now.
---
I love the news tbh, if diremaul were busted the economy would not be in good shape
---
Pretty sure it doesn't work for Warrior or Rogue but the method is:
---
    /cast Frostbolt(Rank 1)
---
Imagine this guy interacting with a woman after he holds the door open.
---
For what asking to tame a pet :P
---
The amount you get is based on the experience it would yield were you still able to get xp. So low level quests give basically nothing.
---
can you still neilyo a death coil in this classic engine?
---
this is the correct reply
---
You get gold for exp, meaning quests that don‚Äôt give any exp aren‚Äôt going to give any gold. The only quests that give 5 gold are the big chains/dungeon quests.
---
Definitely, if anything you are sought after for fortitude and your damage.
---
As if cruel barbs are the best weapon at level 19
---
I‚Äôve set up F1, F2 and F3 to Skull, Cross and moon. There‚Äôs probably a better way but that‚Äôs just what I went with I used to click and assign but that‚Äôs long! 
---
Glad to be of help though man good luck.
---
My only issue is that it doesn't show me mp5 from gear. It either shows all mana regen or 0 in combat :(
---
I use control instead of shift and ripped my shift key out because my palm ended up hitting both and usually messed something up. I also use a mechanical keyboard.
---
You need to get the batch timing right. Basically need to stand up right before the hit so you will still be critted because of batching but are technically already standing and therefore the crit counts as a normal crit while fighting.
---
Pick pocket can‚Äôt be resisted and whatever it is causing vanish to not work properly some times
---
yeah i put in a ticket with gm worse comes to worse ima put in the ah 1 gold cheaper lol
---
Yeah, they only flare up in phase 3 along with periodic fears well. It's the combination that can cause players to be hit by it mostly, being feared over the crack while it flares up.
---
&gt; she‚Äôs probably brilliant
---
I'm not sure if I would assume that, given that she just transferred all her savings to a random account number for basically no reason.
---
&gt; How does x realm transfers not based in specific factions solve faction imbalance?
---
What does that have to do with what I just said?
---
*I am a huntard*
---
*oh look, a shiny item!*
---
*mine mine mine mine mine*
---
it is related with quest's experience reward. ofc low level quest does not give 5g, but some higher lvl quest might
---
Yeah, a few. The worst was when you had a PC with a "front door" that would close so if the CD tray tried to open it'd just hit the door and keep trying to open.
---
Then again, some completely legitimate programs did that too. Ironically..... diablo 2 did that during installation (when you'd have to switch from the play disc to the install disc to the cinematics disc).
---
He's not sure *what* he means, that's how little he cares about it!!
---
He's too busy telling people *'mIgHt As WeLl PoSt ThOuGhTs &amp; PrAyErS'* any time they comment on the topic.  Oh yeah, he also pets his cat *tail to head* cause fuck doing it the other way, he goes *against the grain*!  
---
-90s EXTREME guitar whail outro-
---
PragerU as in the racist education channel?
---
Thats kinda what current retail raiding at the world-first level is. Play perfectly and pray for a try where everything lines up.
---
Why?
---
Warriors, rogues and druids in bear/cat form cannot use lower rank spells. Only man's based classes can, because higher rank spells do more damage and cost more mana, while a warriors abilities always cost the same amount of rage.
---
Have you considered creating a macro to cast a stun then immediately bandage?
---
Lmao I didn't even downvote you mate, just making a joke. Keep on keeping on
---
Heartseeker. Its alliance PvE!! I'm still on Skeram. Lesgo phase2! Im alli btw
---
Currently, I keep strafes where they are and use A and D as my "prime real estate" haha. I do this because I like using F1-F4. Through this post I've noticed that most people do what you said and instead of F keys, use shift for a lot of things. I'm gonna try to switch and see how it goes
---
There's an addon called Move Anything that let's you well move literally anything anywhere on your screen. I beleve you type /move to open its options.
---
Fear ward is literally 4 times more useful than wotf then. Are you dumb?
---
Most quests at level 60 in the higher level zones give around 3-5G upon completion. 
---
I picked a random quest from the game here  [https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=3520/screecher-spirits](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=3520/screecher-spirits)  and you can see the slider bar to change what level you are. You can see at level 60 this quest only gives you 22 Silver 80 Copper. Not sure if this is the best example but it can give you insight.
---
People call cutscenes and NPCs talking in dungeons before bosses RP. Word's lost all its meaning.
---
It's to prevent people from abusing resets at the end of DM: East, I would have thought.
---
I don't understand the point. Everyone who doesn't get item splits the money?
---
Did someone say \[Donnerzorn, Gesegnete Klinge des Windsuchers\]?
---
I need some macro help.
---
Trying to develop a macro for healing wave.
---
Straight press would cast max rank, while holding shift will cast rank 5?
---
No need to do the whole macro, just the modifier part.
---
Thank you!
---
No, this was not a false positive. This was a case of the OP likely paying real money for gold, and that is why Araxom is not saying this was a mistake on Blizz's part, and the ban is upheld.
---
Not on this patch.
---
All you need is 40 ppl attuned. Most guilds can pull that off.
---
afaik for abilities like heroic strike that cost the same for every rank, you can't use the lower ranks. They aren't even in your spell book anymore.
---
I don't need people to be "nice to me" as a tank.. I need gold as I am poor as fuck. Raid geared tank and willing to tank dungeons whole day as long as I can take the drops people don't need.. Instead of hireing me people like to complain that there are not enough tanks -_-
---
It's been like this for as long as classic has been out. It only works in raids though, and it were implemented to prevent people from opening tickets to transfer wrongfully distributed loot etc
---
1: full rank renew is very expensive 
---
2: full rank renew overheals more than any other ability on average 
---
3: renew has a spell power coefficient of 1, so lower ranks scale tremendously well with gear
---
4: priests downrank every other ability besides bubble, which is only used in emergencies so full rank is important there. 
---
It‚Äôs a healing spell. It should be downranked. How about someone give me a reason you shouldn‚Äôt? Since no ones been so kind
---
Problem is, it doesn't show up on your stats. With that buff, I have more melee AP than ranged. My bonus RAP without AotH and Trueshot Aura is less than 200. Melee bonus AP a little under 400. I did not gear for STR as a hunter, I promise you.
---
Could someone explain what is meant by +1 rolls?
---
People running PUGs often say MS &gt; OS +1
---
And he's *still* getting head shots
---
I'm glad someone was farming those eles and selling the charms because I bought them so I could get my whirlwind ax earlier.
---
It's not. It's normal practice in some industries.
---
My friend used to work at a defense contractor. One day, they littered a few USB flash drives around the parking lot. They had some software installed on them so they could track who plugged them in.
---
It's a great way to find out which of your employees is a security risk, and hopefully to educate them before they fall for a real scam.
---
ah yea that's cool too my friend, it's just different
---
the important part is unbinding turn
---
Blizzard just making sure you take time to shower and eat. Unless your a mage
---
in that case it's useless, but still not bad enough to warrant a downvote
---
However, the most recent example I've seen

---
minus 4 for stating it was looted from a Risen Construct. That's just petty beyond belief.
---
Every single starting zone quests will give 5g at level 60, but only after you have completed them all. So don‚Äôt be alarmed if elwynn Forrest doesn‚Äôt give 5g. Just go and complete everything in teldrassil and dun morogh and after you‚Äôve completed everything the final quest will compensate you with all the gold you should have made. 
---
Good luck!
---
I'm just gonna bind cackle to its own button and press it whenever shadow bolt crits.
---
And then spam it when I inevitably pull aggro and become the tank for a exactly 10 seconds. Either the mob dies, or I do.
---
Tag: Humor
---
Sounds about right.
---
I have an addon installed through Twitch called Details! It's a good one, but occasionally a big error pop-up occurs when I click a button like Cannibalise or Bandage. Any ideas why that's happening?
---
I don't want punishment I want to the mechanics to work as intended. Again stop interjecting your feelings onto me.
---
Due procedure? I want the same thing. Everyone instantly hates a bully, you and I are no exceptions. Forums are a place for people to reach out to the dev's, gm's to get things done, it's just another avenue.
---
I can't take action without also breaking the rules. Those people in the game are outside too. Games take a part of life, there is no such thing as "Just a game", they all take time, money, effort from real life and they affect a person irl.
---
It's clear you'r upset over someone on the internet, and there's nothing you can do about it. Just because you don't agree doesn't make you right, or more importantly that you understand the discussion.
---
Someone who expected you to get the weapon at level 34 and use it for a bit before selling it to a vendor.
---
People there are crazy friendly. I know every servers got bad apples but I‚Äôve truly enjoyed 90% of the interactions I‚Äôve had. Within a couple hours questing Echo Isles and no bags drop. Went to Org to see if any fellow starters were leveling their tailoring. Post once in trade, a delightful fellow (Mage goes by Sparklees I believe) is whispers to bring my mats. I had maybe 20-30 pieces of linen. Just gives me 4 silk backpacks. Try to give him tip, he rejects it and just tells me to pass it on when I can. First and interaction in Classic. Fantastic way to set the vibe.
---
Should be, but what the screenshot doesnt tell you is that he is not getting that 200 AP in his ranged stats
---
I grabbed Tailoring and Enchanting when the game launched since I'm a Priest and it seemed logical, but both have been little more than money sinks so far. 
---
I'm level 35 with 205 Tailoring and 185 Enchanting, and I'm thinking of dropping Enchanting for Skinning to make more money in the short term.
---
Should I stick it out or drop one of them for a money making profession?
---
I am super late to this thread, but I'm very happy to see several folks playing something similar to this. I've been building something like this up as I level and am glad to hear it works reasonably well at max level! 
---
Since I'm playing with a small group of old guildies I want something reasonably flexible as we hit 60 since I certainly don't have money to spare for frequent spec changes at the moment!
---
I could, but i don't always need it, and having two keys for the very same action sounds more annoying than anything. I'm basically using 3 bars already.
---
usually 2.89g - 4.90 depending on quest.
---
Idk sometimes I say post PST with offer and people ask how much.
---
If I save you I expect ERP! I didn't just save you for giggles!

I rerroled yesterday from kirtonos to incendius, i can say in here there are more people to play.

Please enlighten us with his name and server
---
It's an immunity. Mob will move on to the next target until it expires, so you better hope tank gets aggro.
---
I suggest you go into the event with something like 40 shards.
---
Also, try enslaving some of the demons, it's a huge help.
---
Same....I really like the darkmoon faire.
---
Is this true though? Priest for BG group for heals not so sure about Spriest. I play a spriest so I hope this true.
---

---
I've had zero issues holding threat even when dps go ham. Talented righteous fury, judge SoR on main target, consecrate, profit. You don't need a taunt when all the mobs stick to you like glue. Until you actually play a paladin tank, it's all speculation or hearsay. I can tell you from experience that switching from warrior to paladin is night and day for aoe tanking. It's just easier and the paladin kit is designed to do this. Warrior tanks have to stance dance to get aoe threat and it's harder for them to hold it. Its not a knock on warriors, it's the way the kits were designed.
---
Seems I misunderstood how this thread works.
---
I know what I like to play, and I like to play it so much that I thought everyone else should know.
---
Heartseeker is not worth it at all, the mats will cost you hundreds on most servers. Barman Shanker is about as good and is much easier to get since you can solo the boss that drops it.
---
Another good OH is Bonescraper from Baron Rivendare, which you will be farming for his cloak anyway, or Alcor's Sunrazor if you can get a cheap one (unlikely).
---
Just nitpicking, sound advice on the whole.
---
Probably, i guess it's just not my thing. I find 40 people to be HUGE already !
---
thanks!

They did something vaguely similar in Overwatch where they put a small circle before each chat message. That makes it very clear that someone has just typed a bunch of spaces to force a newline.

Not referring to you obviously. It was more than one. I‚Äôm just stunned. It happens all the time. I can only chalk it up to retail people in the sub trolling. I could really care less about the actual downvote more so that your opinion gets buried when people troll.

You would be surprisingly just how many people are completely unqualified for the job they have. In my experience it's close to half. If you work in government or education it's probably more like 85%.

You can put additional points in enhanced blessing of Might in Ret tree. melees will love you. Alternative you can skip might and go full prot for better survivability and Blessing of Kings. Or both to be flexible, but you can only apply one bleessing at a time, so maybe BoK is overall better, because everyone profits from Kings.

It's the threat that really matters though - berserking is great. The benefit of 10% more HP on Taurens is that you're less likely to be killed. Bigger effective health = more room for healer error.

Rogues: I've been running a hemo build (since I fucking hate combat swords) that's been doing pretty well for me in solo play, and dungeons, and I took imp sinister strike so I could get away with raiding with it until my gear is good and I'm expected to actually perform and am not broke for respecs.
---
Current build @59 [0-25-25](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/-320055010004014-500243100330121). My question is, which is a better choice for my last point, 5/5 Dual Wield Spec, or 5/5 Sword Spec? I'm leaning towards putting my last point in sword spec.
---
False. I just checked the bid list for resto druid. Head, neck, wrists, waist, both rings and 1 trinktet are not feom naxx. Thats like half the slots. And its not all from aq40 either. It includes LBRS, BWL, AQ and Naxx. Sure you wont need to go MC anymore but thats not a big deal. Not every raid can stay relevant forever. MC is relevant for long enough and actually its forever because of thunderfury
---
Hmm Rogues don't seem to be too popular Alliance side on my server. I personally don't notice too many at least.
---
Funny enough looks like a seahorse.
---
Stop making progress for how long? I'm tracking the quests because I'm actively working on them.

Is there a place I can see how long each flight takes, so that I can plan my bowel movement accordingly?

 Hi tracking, I'm Dad!

2) Maybe Sock wasn't interested in buying only one. Maybe he was interested in buying stacks of that mat, having a different deal if you had more quantity.
---
And, iirc, the damage and the Mana gain are two independent rolls so just because you take crit damage, you don't necessarily get crit mana.
---
Conversely, you can completely resist the damage and still get that sweet, sweet mana.

Seriously. I already ran DM: E, W, and N, but I already forgot where to go because I am directionally challenged. No worries - there's a map that shows you where to go and what path to follow.

I'm in the top dps meters as an aoe farm spec. I dont even have clear casting. I have the resist talents for ZF farms. So many casters that your mana never goes down.  All raids are a joke right now, just play whichever spec you want besides fire. 
---
I also have shatter for world pvp and finishing off aoe groups.
---
The RNG gods are smiling at you.  With laughter it seems.

Approximately:

Crit% total = crit% from gear + (intellect/60)
---
Yep, made sure to do the quest chain for that exact reason.  If people don't want to put in the work to make it easier for others, those same people aren't going to be willing to help them.
---
If you just log out and log back in, you are in the same place.
---
If you log out for more than 5 minutes I believe, your instance will reset and you will be at the start of the instance.
---
If you log out and someone in your party resets the instance, you will go to the start of the instance.
---
If either of the above happens but you have reached the instance reset cap, you will be sent to your hearthstone location.

Hey Guys, 
---
I recently hit 60 on my hunter and while I wait for some of my friends to catch up I want to level an alt. I am currently deciding between priest and warlock. My characters are both level 15 I am just unsure which to level. 
---
Is getting groups as an Spriest at high level as bad as I think it will be? I imagine I can always go holy and role on gear that nobody needs for shadow or make my own groups.  My friends and I primarily PVP but we will do many 60 dungeons as well. I am leaning towards priest due to our healer friend recently quitting the game. 
---
Does anybody have any insight?
---
Yes. And also there's a fitting quote (from I'm not sure who, but I'm sure someone will add that in) that goes "people are promoted to their level of incompetence." meaning that they may have been good at a lower or entry-level position that got them promoted, and they just have no business being in their new role due to stupidity or personality or whatever reason may be.
---
In BC it was split between IF and the new town too. When I started playing MoP that's when I noticed the community was fractured and randomly split up, plus everyone just spent time in their own little hideaway place too.
---
kek
---
This, I was that shadow priest. And I actually kept somewhat up with the damage (except when aoe is needed, you're useless). But after that first guild raid, I switched to healer spec and its much funner to play in raids and I feel like I'm helping more.
---
Also as shadow you go oom so fast in raids you have to panic drink after every mob.
---
&gt; They have insane burst
---
Since when? Their damage is certainly respectable from a pvp standpoint, but nothing about their toolkit provides a large amount of burst. Their damage is almost all from ticking sources and they have no talent to increase spell crits above 150% damage. Spriest power in pvp lies in the fact that SW:P scales so well and that shadowform is almost as good as soul link against melee classes.
---
The path selection leaves a lot to be desired, though. Orgrimmar to Un'goro, for example, will       use like 4 hops through Xroads etc. to Gadgetzan, even though there is a shorter, direct Orgrimmar-&gt;Gadgetzan route it could use instead.
---
Protip fastest way to everlook for horde is to stop in azshara then go to everlook as this will cut over the mountains instead of through felwood for whatever reason.
---
But it's boring

Don't forget that you can run by pressing Right and Left mouse button at the same time so that frees up the movement keys long enough for you to cast the shift+keybind and then go back to WASD.

Bloodsail Buccaneers server &lt;Bloodsail Buccaneers&gt; perfection

In Desolace @ shadowprey village. Theres a guy on the dock asking u to bring like 5 fish to him from these cages at the bottom of water nearby. You can gather more than 5 at a time so you can turn it in multiple times and every time u turn in 5 he pays you 55 Silver. Sorry i forget his exact name and the fishes name but hes the only one on the dock offering this type of turn in so its easy to find.
---
You can easily make 10g/hr doing this and its for your level.
---
Well i dont know exactly and i am not an expert. Sometimes I am grinding mobs to get a drop rate so low and I waste a lot of time that it makes sense to me that It would stop tracking. Only once I saw a quest that didnt dissapear and it was a completed quest. 
---
Maybe It works this way or maybe I am very unlucky
---
Change flair to humor
---
Aren't you inherently part of the problem then? Instead of giving it any chance to balance out you left and worsened the imbalance. I played on a horde underdog server day 1 of vanilla against two of the biggest PVP guilds that existed at the time, DIE and Serenity Now. We made do. Was it frustrating at times? Sure, but that was part of the fun of a pvp server. If you don't want to get ganked, you have an option, roll on a pve server. I'm actually disappointed that I'm not in the underdog faction on our server, I'd rather have the tough odds. The game is not unplayable, that's just silly.
---
As a guild leader I generally try to look for players who are friendly and helpful to others and don't try to start arguments for fun in gchat.  Unfortunately it's hard to just find a full raid team worth of these people by just grouping and slow recruiting.   
---
Large and potentially bloated is kind of a side effect of 40 man content, but megaguilds take it too far imo.
---
To get on task with you're question I would make a list of things you are interested in doing or looking for in game for Classic and then think of how a guild is able to help you do that.
---
For example if you want to make friends that you'll stay friends with for years in and outside of wow (like vanilla was for many people) that will have you asking significantly different questions than if you are looking to clear every raid within 2 weeks of release while also grinding top ranks in PVP.
---
Do not join the aids-infested olympus guild. You will regret it for sure.
---
I would Stay clear of faerlina too.
---
Get to level 38+ depending on class, go to badlands, farm rock elementals. Dont vendor every stone you get, some are valuable, for example solid stone goes for 10s ea on AH, vendors for 1s, also elemental earths 1g ea. Just look up before vendoring ( except grey items ofc)
---
You are a liar. 
---
You absolutely label people, everyone does, good or bad you have a label for them. Saying you don't makes you a liar, and yeah that's a label too. Labels describe things, they aren't good or bad, we put that quality in them, or we make a label to make them good or bad.
---
Reaching out on forums is just another avenue to get something done, that's what it's there for. Your value is not mine or others, your thoughts aren't ours and won't be.
---
I particularly find it interesting how I state there is no cause or rally and the first thing you comment on is racism. It speaks volumes on who you are. 
---
Here comes some labels. You are mostly likely a bigot, uptight, narcissistic, entitled and want to be offended. It tends to upset people like this when they find out nothing they say thing feel or do is important to others.
---
Instead of wanting to fix a problem you try to shout down the person bringing light to it, which just makes you a bad person. I know I'm a bad person btw, I'm very clear on that, that said I try to limit myself and not sink to their level.
---
Can you provide a link? I use twitch and it's not listed as an available mod.
---
"before classic, when was the last time you saw this many people in Org"

Please break down for me where he is implicitly stating that the currently world cities are empty with this statement.

---
I have a question as someone who has been contemplating leaving sulfuras(layered) for earthfury(medium) for over a week now. 
---
I've been logging in to both and comparing results from AH scans(10k vs 20k) and "/who 60 &lt;class&gt;"(only mage at 50 vs all classes) trying to get a feel for things as well as just checking out the crowds in front of the IF AH at different times of the day, keeping in mind that sulfuras is 2x what I see due to layers. I also monitor trade, world and lookingforgroup to see how many groups are out there LFM. 
---
All of the above has me concerned. By all measureable metrics earthfury could be categorized as "dead". If I had to guess I would say a little under half the population in sulfuras (for alliance at least). I've been 60 for a couple of weeks now, so my biggest fear is finding groups to run dungeons due to how few 60s there are and how many of those 60s are in MC half the week with their guild. Also I've been doing PUG MCs and for example there were 3 different ones occurring simultaneously last night along with pug ony. 
---
Have you noticed a problem with sitting around and waiting for groups or finding PUG raids? What role are you? I'm a healer which may actually be the worst class for finding groups due to multiple classes filling the role and groups only taking 1. Have you noticed any other issues due to a much lower population? What are some perks I may not have thought about since I've been weighing the cons and monitoring for those? Thanks for your time in advance. :)
---
People assume everyone has an addon like TSM or Auctioneer to tell you the AH price when you hover over it.
---
I do use the paths that avoid dogs :) There's no possibility with dogs interfering.
---
Pallies are odd ducks. Just whore yourself for all the spell crit and get what plus healing you can after that.crit crit crit.
---
Sometimes I ask the DPS to target packs they want me to pull and it works great.
---
They do when your enemy is mind controlled
---
The classes aren't fairly balanced to begin with lol....  the rules are trying to fix that which means strong classes get restrictions but weak ones don't. Crazy right
---
Oh well what a wonderful world we are part of...
---
I'm staying because I want to transfer to one of two specific servers and not some probably dead nothing server.
---
A lot of them. I always thought of paid subscriptions as a kind of barrier against them but I'm astonished by the amount of annoying kids there is in Classic. Or maybe I'm becoming old and starting to see 18-early 20s people as kids

A haiku isn‚Äôt a first person type of poem. It‚Äôs more of a statement of what is going on, an observation of sorts. The last line typically isn‚Äôt symmetrical to what the rest of the poem is about, it‚Äôs like a random punchline. The subject of Haikus is often nature but that‚Äôs not a necessity. A proper Haiku sounds more like

Right click a target far enough away you don't hit them then drop the target, you'll hold it out. Running with a 2h is prettyfunny looking.

It‚Äôs not. People are programmed to follow direction and rules. And there are a lot of managers that get there though every means other than having high common sense.

Fucking dworfs that are Infront of Brd chased me all the way up to the entrance and when I thought i am safe 3 stoodges come up running shiving me in the ass ...Wth man

No that's one of the vanilla bugs if blizzard really was against it a lot of people would be banned by now.
---
Honestly? You're level 34. Just keep playing, doing quests and selling rewards + all loot you gather along the way and chances are you'll have your 90g by 40 anyway.

Again that's an ad hominem. Reason I use it is because that's exactly what people do all the time when arguing online. Proof is you did it again. Learn about fallacious argument. That will help you.
---
When arguing if you try to make the other person look bad. That's a fallacy if people point that out it probably means you do that a lot.
---
like tbf, this is why its a PvP server, if he doesnt want PvP then he should change server, its that simple really.
---
Super tryhards use ESDF as that gives you another column of keys to use with your pinky :D
---
I said gold is the limiting factor cause you absolutely need consumables in aq and naxx. A melee spends about 500 gold in consumables per night of progression in naxx, a healer spends about 50-100. A casual melee player just cant farm that gold every week but it's reasonable to expect a healer can and i stand by it
---
It probably won‚Äôt matter unless you are in a hardcore PVP guild. The only issue in premade vs premade is that your dots will be dispelled ( Locks have Demo so are the better choice) and you can  also only heal yourself in shadowform.
---
That's actually kind of depressing.
---
Perfect! Could you share?
---
Yes, 3-5g per quest. I saved all of EPL for 60.
---
Yea like that whole Sun exploding and enveloping the earth thing. A problem for another day. Or you know by then it may be the needed solution. You never know.
---
Hh man it's a meme so it happens constantly on my server. tbh though I'm not mad at priests...its their one fun thing they get to do and I can't find it in me to begrudge them that. Let em have their fun...just not on me cause I'm hiding and that's a lot of time lost. They always do it really far from shore so you wont make it back before fatigue kills you.
---
Same I was Horde on Stallag but it was a PVE server for the Horde. Now on Benediction the pop is so even I get all the pvp I want and its amazing getting ganked and starting drama. Makes leveling a fun experience. My friend gave up his lvl 60 and lvl 40 chars on stallag to benediction.
---
Questie makes people dumb 'cause they just look at the mini-map.

I'd like to make a horde alt that uses two handed weapons. 
---
*DPS
---
* Don't want to respec 
---
* I play solo, so not interested too much in raiding (not a min-maxer)
---
* PvE focus
---
I've searched and found most people suggest; Enhancement Shaman, Fury Warrior, and Survival Hunter. 
---
I think that Enhancement Shaman sounds best for me as a solo PvE focused leveling char. Does this sound right or am I overlooking warrior/hunter for 2h weapons.
---
But you could log out to force a stop.
---
Aaaaaaand game is ruined
---
There's actually a shit load of people in Org on retail. One of the only places in the whole world that's populated. Possibly the worst example you could have used haha
---
They didn't want to RP, just skip long queue times?
---
But you don't always have an attackable target on screen. I.e. in a city.
---
Cloak of shadows doesn't give you absolute immunity at all. Your example is terrible.
---
Consider the alternative
---
This happened to me a few days ago. As I was complaining about it (also complaining that I hadn't been recording) to my son behind me, a tauren rezzed me.
---
No, I just didn't feel like arguing with a fool.
---
There  are 17 pieces of gear possible, so it's a matter of everything coming together rather than looking at every individual piece of gear. I guess  the best analogy I can give is it's like music. One note by itself won't  produce a tune, but 17 notes stringed together absolutely can. Likewise, one piece of gear won't make a huge difference but 17 pieces coming together will.
---
I definitely get energy back off of some type of non-hit. Not all of it but a decent chunk of it. That said I don't think there is a talent that refunds if you miss for finishers, nothing worse than missing a CB+Eviscerate.
---
the longer you wait, the less you play, the more you have to pay
---
Is that right?!? Do we have a similar alliance fish fetching quest
---
Is this a good time for a gnome mage? I honestly don't know! The only route I know is Tauren Shaman 1-10 which can be done in less than an hour (I've done 1:07:xx before), but I also know it's the single fastest 1-10 and slows way down compaird to other classes (solo), specially in the 45-55 range.
---
Zandalar doesn‚Äôt have queues even at peak times.
---
If I‚Äôm low on mana and proc clearcasting I might toss in  a blizzard or flamestrike.  Nothing wrong with that.
---
We seem to have a good thing going on Sulfuras so I don't know why they're letting people leave. I'm just hoping that nobody does transfer because why would they? Haven't faced a queue since the first two weeks of release.
---
At 49 it's pretty good yes. And 59 if you consider that a real bracket.
---
He‚Äôs at 8g right now, not a chance he‚Äôs gonna have 90g+ by 40 thru normal play in the next 6 levels.  He was already short before he screwed up with the AH flip.
---
But you are making the assumption that there are alliance dominated PVP servers with room for Hordes. I don‚Äôt think there is.
---
After ZF, yeah warriors should have shields
---
Yea people get crazy with optimizing, but that's just my opinion. I personally like to play different specs and switch it up.
---
Ultimately as almost everything in classic best enjoyed in a group of cool people, and suddenly 1on1 balance is not really important anymore
---
And no 1 helped you? Or is STV dead for you? It's super busy on my server.
---
It's not unusual, some Warriors will tank without a shield even to BRD. That said if the damage was too much he should have sucked it up and put a shield on.
---
I used mumble for years before discord. And discord is vastly superior in every way possible. Mumble is dead
---
My guess is about 15 hours a week of gameplay will be enough to clear naxx at a decent pace (2 weeks after launch or so?). I'm not sure if that's considered hardcore but i work a full time job and manage to play a lot more time than that. Probably cause i don't have kids i guess
---
What level was he? In BRD people should start wearing shield for the most part, the big fire elementals and larger packs in particular. 
---
2h tanking has become a "meta thing" to counter the full-out DPS meta flying around. It's super fun for healers.
---
Exit form, draw weapon, take form. It stays out.
---
He's not going to make anywhere *near* 80g in the 6 levels between 34 and 40. A lot of people struggle to get 90g from 1-40.
---
I just saw the purple and the insane DPS on that bad boy, and wanted to equip it. I just don't know what to expect with the AH when arenas aren't open yet.
---
Especially 2h weapons!
---
warrior tanks should *have* a shield, but that doesn't necessarily mean they should *always be using* a shield.  It all depends on the whole team.  If there are problems with keeping him healed through spikes or whatnot, that would be an ideal time for the warrior to strap on his shield and change tactics a bit.  If the healer is over-leveled for the instance and things are pretty easy, 2 one handers can be viable.  From what I understand, BRD is where difficult can ramp up and tanks that aren't accustomed to use a shield might need to start.
---
noob to classic (played about 16 years ago)...what do you mean add-ons through twitch to keep them updated?  I realize they never updated automatically until curse had a launcher (that was the last time I playted)...what's this twitch update?
---
Look who brat the puns!
---
Started an new character on a new server.  The old server wasn't terrible.  It's probably average population based on the numbers someone put out a month ago.  The new server is night and day difference for PvE.  The AH actually has demand for items.  The /lookingforgroup channel is none stop all day.  
---
I still prefer this older system than the cross realm dungeon finders.  It doesn't mean it's a perfect system.  It only really works when there's a lot of other people playing.
---
Yeah I meant fire prot. That's not so bad. 100g is a decent price.
---
Anyone think it's a good move to go from Bigglesworth to Earthfury? Alliance. I see Earthfury is more balance but has way less population. Should I move while I can? Do you think this will make Bigglesworth more unbalanced?
---
Rogue potions (thistle tea) are and have been banned in every recent tournament, even though rogues actually need tea to beat some classes like priest and warlock, where warlocks don't need stones to beat anything.
---
Thanks, I was literally about to go look for a list of emotes so I can communicate my horrible ideas to the other faction better.
---
Yeah dude I sure wish I was an undead male like you, alliance is so cringe xd
---
I loved that in I think Legion. Such a crutch
---
Ok.  If you're going to argue with me you're going to need to explain to me where I used it as an example of anything.  I said "it's not cloak of shadows".  When did I ever use it as an example?
---
Hunter melee weaving while solo can be a lot of fun. Alternatively, a dynamic pulling method while farming/questing where you fight a mob in melee, your pet fights a mob 8 years away, you auto/multi shot between your melee swings to effectively shoot and melee at full efficiency while chaining point blank multi shots.
---
Hunters can also dungeon/raid perfectly fine with their common PvP specs.

I'm sure prices are definitely going to go up once BGs come out, but people are definitely buying twink gear already. I know personally I'm already almost done scooping up all the BoEs for my 19 priest.

Human Rogue, 2 swords, skilled weapon expertise. Theoretical sword skill 310
---
= how much +hit do I need on items?
---
The addon character stats says I have +9%, which everyone claims is perfect? But I only have +4% on the gear I'm wearing currently. 
---
I'm always not sure if the discussions about hit mean total hit chance or extra hit gained from items.
---
problem?
---
you make it sound like its a bad thing
---
Itt: people complaining that have no idea how op sl warlocks are.
---
Warrior friend and I (paladin) were doing jump runs in DM east. Pretty simple, quick bosses. We got lucky and had it drop on the first boss we killed lol.
---
I agree that it is more difficult to find groups as a rogue (even though I did all the dungeons for all quests), but I never had a problem with leveling. I rather find it surprisingly easy as a solo rogue especially in combat spec with Blade Flurry.
---
It's pretty common to have a DW or even 2H tanks. Yes they take more damage, but they also deal more damage and hold threat much better. It's on them to equip a shield when damage is too much.
---
Definitely sell it, having your mount will increase your leveling speed more than that weapon will.  I'd say never level with any twink weapon (unless you already have a 60 bankrolling, and you dgaf).  Not sure which class nightblade is bis for, though.  I know PoD is bis for wars and shaman, so it won't fetch you 1000s, but you should still make a decent amount on it, 50-100g, maybe?  Enough for a mount, at least.
---
Now this was designed pre-activision
---
Yeah, I think if you don‚Äôt do anything with it for 5 minutes or something it stops tracking. I use Monkey Quest to replace the in-game quest tracker.
---
What class? If you have a natural mobility increase I wouldn‚Äôt stress about having mount as soon as you hit 40 and just keep questing or doing whatever puts you at 60 quickest but if you don‚Äôt Whelps and Elementals are great. SoS Whelps, Arathi Earth/Fire Elementals, and Badlands Earth Elementals. AH your Small Flame Sacs, Elemental Earth, Elemental Fire, and the salt and stone that drop from the Earth Elementals. Try to grind at low pop hours if possible.
---
Well, I had about 20g at that level on my priest, and when I hit 40, I had 30g leftover after purchasing my mount. My professions were skinning and tailoring, and at that point all of my leather was just being vendored. 
---
By the time you hit 37 or 38, quests start giving you 80s or more on completion, and the greens vendor for 1-3g per. Grey weapons you loot sell for 50s-1.5g. Really adds up quick
---
There's usually a guaranteed spot of 1 shadow priest per 4 warlocks in a raid, because the added damage from shadow weaving is more than another warlock's worth of damage.
---
Yes this exactly, the majority of the playerbase clearly prefers to be on the bigger side.  Always has been, always will be.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs kind of funny how people wanted the old talent system back for the customization but then most everyone playing classic is just flowering a leveling guide and picking the talents they are told to. I‚Äôm having much more fun picking the talents I want and experimenting. Sure I may not hit 60 quickly but it‚Äôll be a much more enjoyable journey
---
Could be a very long time, they're peaking at what seems to be 3 times more players than can be held on one layer without queues.
---
Gotcha, so you need to crit in order to increase damage, and if you don't ever crit, then that talent never works.
---
Because Azeroth is actually flat and the FPs are made that way by the government to trick people into thinking Azeroth is round so the war can continue and the rich can stay in power.
---
Ah, good idea.
---
Shame I can't make a shadowform furbolg tho.
---
 NO CHANGES
---
No because blizzard loves horde
---
That should easily get you your mount, but obviously it would be pretty fun to use it as well. It just depends what you value more.
---
You can always farm gold later, there is no need to rush your mount if you want to have fun using the sword.
---
I know this sub is all about no changes, but i wish they had left in the extra emotes from retail.  :(
---
Not being able to facepalm at a friend, or meow on my druid makes me sad.
---
Same thing with aircraft now I think is the idea. Like each area only has a flight connecting to a couple other spots
---
:C
---
yo can't switch from PVE TO PVP anyway.
---
What sort of discussion goes on in the chats there about the faction imbalance?
---
Then just re-roll on to the server you want. No sense in continuing to play on a server you don't want to.
---
That‚Äôs absolutely not true. Raid gear is and has always been better than things outside of raids.
---
Same here. I never noticed that and I made a lot of female chars.
---
Get rekt scrub.
---
You cant kite 5 mobs higher level than you anymore?
---
Bo hoo
---
With clickbait youtube titles, you can.
---
But in all seriousness, it's probably  a bit less.
---
For leveling, I think wand spec is best taken early. So you'd put the first few points into Disc, before going holy.
---
nightblade is nice, but you're going to be replacing it.  If you can figure out how much you could sell it for, look on your AH and see what else you could buy with a portion of that sale price.  You might be able to get a blue or green that isn't a huge drop off damage/stat-wise but only costs you a fraction of what you got for selling it.  Then you get the best of both worlds -- an upgrade and mount money.
---
At level 34 i had around 5g (levelled profession through AH), i could've farmed gold-spots till level 40, but decided to just stick with my normal leveling &amp; dungeons and buy my mount at level 43 instead of 40 (those ZulFarrak Quests give nice gold). Buying your mount first thing at 40 is overrated.
---
let us /introduce ourselves
---
Would it be worth the time investment to mob grind a mage to 60 with a handful of gear quests in between just to minmax gold gained from other quests?
---
You're behind the pack enough that people actually have money now so that's decent advice. Just a couple weeks ago most stuff was selling for so low on the AH it was better to just vendor pretty much everything.
---
&gt; queue depends on the number of players on the server not on each layer.
---
Source?
---
I've got my mount on shift+mousewheel up :D Is that bad?
---
If you're horde  stv is fine
---
If I am alliance looking to escape Herod where should I go?
---
Sure buddy :D
---
By not transferring from imbalanced servers.
---
What's the actual issue?  That we won't run all the raids every week?
---
Also who cares how much power creep there is?  It's the end of classic.
---
No, you cant. Because you need 5 points in hit in order to unlock 50% more offhand weapon damage. In addition, the competing talents are pretty had.
---
So you do all three zones and it only gets you to 15?
---
Dude.  This is not something wrong with the game.  It's entirely the way you used it.  Why are you just walking up in front of elites to pick pocket anyway?  Come up behind them.  All I can do is shake my head...
---
How does a 22 Silver example prove that you can get 3-5G?
---
It's good at keeping threat and has good damage. Dungeon content isn't intended to be too taxing so it's doable with most builds.
---
That's for clearing that up /s
---
We force wiped when we were about 4 minutes in and came back to no mobs spawned but bosses
---
Lfm mc  curve only
---
Nah. Just tell people you don't know where you're going. Someone in the group likely does. I tanked a lbrs yesterday and just said upfront that it had been like a decade since I did it on a pserver so someone else marked targets when they thought it was important to do so and lead the group through all the little skips. 
---
Sometimes you're the leader, and sometimes people just point at a pack of mobs and you try to keep them all attacking you.
---
Pulled the Forest Tracker Epaulets (BoE, lvl 26, 78 armor, 11 Agi, 5 Str) yesterday. A party member told me to hold those until phase 2/3 because they're lvl 29 twink gear and will sell for way more than they sell for now (10-15g). Does this sound accurate? Do we have any idea when p2/3 will drop?
---
Why does this post even exist? If you're not comfortable with sharing your account don't do it. It's YOUR account.
---
Why would anyone even second guess that lol?
---
It‚Äôs a fun one to do too, did it this time and was surprised I didn‚Äôt have to venture into barrens quests
---
Honestly i'd rather have the chat message still pop up so i can report them.
---
Lmao I get that a lot when I play. Some people whisper me asking if I deliver or if I‚Äôm on Uber eats lol.
---
This weap is unferwhelming
---
But it did proc first swing ever in PvP
---
Trolls are the best warriors for threat, if you care about min/maxing. Any race is fine, though.
---
Aa yeah, the big ocean dividing kalimdor
---
Honestly I think I‚Äôll just stick with it, I‚Äôm almost 60 and I hate leveling with a passion. I really wouldn‚Äôt enjoy rerolling now that everything is so fresh in my mind, and I‚Äôm also waiting to see what‚Äôs announced at Blizzcon as I might get back into retail.
---
I don't think we are denying that Blizzard is probably scheming on how to put mtx in Classic. It's personally worrisome when the community tries to help facilitate this by coming up with their own ideas and posting them in this subreddit is all.
---
With having no +hit for shadowbolts, nightfall/shadow trance procs, and crit bonuses, the variance in warlock DPS is just huge.
---
He‚Äôs obviously trolling right?
---
idk I see a lot of posts regarding asshole players
---
 You know you can get the yeti hides from skinning too, so it gos quick if you have skinning
---
I made this today... myself. I'd like to see your source?
---
I do something like this, as do I think many ex-pro/streamer rogues. Some get really wonky but I can't hit ctrl modifiers or alt modifiers to save my life,
---

---
RemindMe! 2 years
---
Ah shit is it that bad?
---
What if I'm recruiting a brand new player 10 months from now?  My only options to "coordinate" with them would be time travel or re-roll...
---
I agree with you and think that people complaining about not coordinating with friends and being unwilling to re-roll two days after release are stupid whiners, but applying that standard to future new players is fraught with problems.
---
noone is gonna object if you tank dungeons at 60 and roll on +heal items since chances are high noone needs those (apart from having a shami or ret dps in the grp), and tanks are always high in demand so for farming your pre bis staying feral is probably a good idea. For raids you will most likely want to spec at least into 0/30/21 as someone in the top comments suggested
---
Its funnythat the people who told me i was gonna be on a dead server, are actually going to be on a dead server because Alliance are leaving.
---
Westfall PVE, we are in need of Mages, Rogues, &amp; Resto Druids  - Tfreeman#1140
---
I'd sell it either way, I think the two options are to either sell it now and get your mount, or hold on to it and sell it later for a larger amount of money. 
---
Right now, I don't think you'd get more than 75-100g for it, but I think in the future it will be worth far more. The real question is whether that 75g now has more worth and/or buying power than 300g (just guessing here) in the future, and I'm unable to answer that question for you. If you want my opinion, I think you should sell it now and use the money to get your mount. The one epic drop I got I sold for only 18g for similar reasons, despite probably being able to get 80g in a few months.
---
Probably cataclysm when org was the main city again. But even in retail now there is a ton just because of cross server players you see
---
No, trolls are the best for threat because of their racial. An orc using axes is the exact same as a troll using any weapon with a +5 wep skill item on.
---
&gt; Poke a mage for water, pat them to say thanks.
---
Only with Gnomes
---
Only for BoPs that you have not equipped. And only tradeable to people that were eligible to loot the item in the first place. (Aka they had to be in raid at least)
---
All sources and videos say large actually. I haven‚Äôt seen one that says powerful.
---
As someone who has very good memories of BC, I've always like Shattrath.
---
That just sounds like sunk cost fallacy though. If you don't like world pvp you're not going to like a pvp server probably. Especially during phase 2.
---
No it wouldn't it was "foolproof"
---
By spacing until you got the new row in chat it would be indistinguishable from an actual whisper, save that a whisper from a friend preceded and hitting r wouldn't give you the "gm" but the friends name

---
This method works on my mage (thanks!), but not my pally. Guess that's another class it doesn't work on. Bummer. Wanted it for mouseover macros for healing.
---
When you say rogue potions are you meaning the ability for a rogue to use a health potion? Because it seemed like you were calling thistle tea a rogue potion since rogues don't have potions.
---
Per quest! But u gotta do them all before blizz compensates you on the back end. So be extremely thorough.
---
Yes I do. The proc is very low. It's just not a very good item.
---
If you are concerned about mana for SP, then I suspect the Mp5 Charstone Dirk is even better. Or lore spinner now from DM
---
gonna get those sweet internet points
---
Whenever I see a post from a horde from Zandalar Tribe, I look for the people I have on my KOS list.
---
"Owo", I know you're out there. I'll kill you again and again until you quit the game, you RNG carried swine ;)
---
How about that adesanya Whittaker fight?
---
Got my WW axe at level 30 as a warrior . Should I respec to arms now or continue with 2H Fury and then switch at 40-45 (when I can get MS and some points in cruelty) ?
---
It's really not that big of a deal. You just have to grab a wep skill item. Even a lot of Orcs will use ACLG and daggers once they are in MC.
---
/r/thathappened
---
A shaman ahead
---
Disarm his ravager axe
---
Time for his walk back
---
I put minor speed to boots on my Warrior alt and didn‚Äôt realize the +armor kit I got from a quest would remove the enchant. Had to spend another 5g getting minor speed back. Lesson learned.
---
One of my Alts name is Bobogooboo.
---
I literally think of the most retarded name possible for any character I make
---
You generally don't gear for 9% as an "off-race" you just have to pick up a wep skill item like Edgemasters.
---
You also have %5 hit from tallents
---
BOOM HEADSHOT
---
If you really want to be efficient, make an alt with better solo capability. Just don't be prot and you should be fine for warrior farming though.
---
Didnt realize you could do this, could literally set up a group to sell raid buffs, with the tribute run buffs. Insane profitability.
---
You only need an updated WoW, copy World of Warcraft folder on USB (no need Bnet) and launch it with "Wow.exe" inside the _classic folder or something

LOL THAT'S YOUR SOLUTION?
---
Are we talking about perception or fear ward? Are we talking about using WotF in a PvE situation or about whether fear ward is better? Are you incapable of higher intelligent thought or are you just unable to read?
---
My kink is someone's kink for kink shaming.
---
Just like killing all those raptors for the gold.  Just keep killing em bro, it's a low drop rate.
---
Maybe if we gave them decent ideas we can avoid wow token 2.0 honestly.
---
I have the opposite problem üòÇ
---
Didn‚Äôt know that specific picture of an undead with a nelf mask would be so nostalgic for me, wow
---
Champagne you hide in your bag to avoid being found out
---
Speaking as a SPrs, if I was trying to min/max I'd be dead with half of time I get Geddon bombed in my 'of Shadow Wrath' gear. Sure SOME item slots is worth it like Bracers where your statted options are so much worse, but for things like Cloak, I have a +20 Shadow one still in bank vs 14 with stats that I stuck with using - is a it of a debate just for QoL (higher mana pool) and survival - this ring fits in to the second example - yes, I'd kill for it while leveling, since that Spirit may as well be +12 for me, BUT it would've been replaced once I got got both Eye of Org AND Cyclopean Band.
---
Ultimately I just want to know what the OP wound up doing.
---
I love it lol
---
Let's also note this "bug" was recreated. It was a bug in Vanilla, and was intentionally preserved in Classic.
---
Do you like PVP?  You could set up some twinks right now and it'd be a GREAT time to have it be cost effective.  Twink items are still very cheap on the AH because BGs won't be out for awhile, and if you have just one friend level 40+ you can easily run the twink through the relevant BGs for level 19 or 29. 
---
Personally I'm a big fan of 49 'twinks' but the gear disparity is not nearly the same at 49 as it is at 19/29.  Basically you just run Sunken Temple / Mara as much as you can and do a few quests to get some top-tier items.  Lots of cheap BOEs as well in this range that are great gear upgrades, plus you have access to either the 31 pt talent or a nice combination of other abilities (Paladins can get consecrate + almost full vengeance in the Ret tree, for example).
---
Would you want QoL changes if they were free?
---
Why is this your issue?
---
dEaD gAeM
---
We also did that
---
I'm pretty certain this isn't true. From my understanding disabling layers does reduce the server capacity. I'm about 90% sure Blizz said the primary reason for layering was to artificially increase the number of people on each server. This is so that when the initial rush of people begins to drop off each server still has a healthy population. This wouldn't make much sense if the server capacity remained the same. I don't have a source on this however. Maybe someone who has it handy can follow up?
---
That said, I suspect reducing two layers to one won't cut the capacity in half, but by a smaller margin. This part is pure speculation however.
---
People who multibox on PvP servers are cowards, more so if they are a paladin so they can bubble hearth.
---
It's definitely this, it takes away a bit of the magic when you see the stark changes in landscapes between zones that's normally out of sight from the ground or hidden behind mists and fogs. The farclip hides the scale of the world too so it seems a lot bigger to the player.
---
your tendies wet by sweat, my friend?
---
Lol idk sorry
---
Isn't he ret?
---
lamo.
---
My memory must be fuzzy then. I seem to distinctly recall people complaining quite bitterly that their top of the range epics were being replaced by quest rewards within a few levels in TBC.
---
Now this is the true Classic experience.
---
He's missing a comma
---
&gt;Want a bag, champ?
---
It‚Äôs a bit harder than sunk cost fallacy for me. I have never enjoyed leveling content, quite the opposite actually, and I‚Äôve been playing since Vanilla. So it‚Äôs a matter of doing pro/cons on whether I hate being ganked 5 times on my way to a dungeon more than sinking 200 hours leveling again.
---
Furbolg form is the ultimate raid challenge on fights without unavoidable AoE. If you can finish the fight in Furbolg form, you have dodged perfectly and have truly become one with the Furbolg, because you can fight normally, but it breaks on damage.
---
Because hit itemization is rare in Vanilla. I dont think we got hit gear until Burning Crusade, as well as +hit gems that were available then. So getting all the extra little bit of hit you can as a rogue (fast attacking class) the higher your dps will be and more often your attacks will land.
---
Is there an addon that tells you flight path times, that would be useful.

Why yes I am new to classic, it‚Äôs only been out for a month.
---
No problem, I came to the sub to look for quelserrar discussion honestly, cus I had trouble finding anyone helpful when I was looking into this topic before DM launch. Everyone just said ‚Äúfarm the gold and buy it‚Äù but I knew there had to be a better way for a poor boi. And there was.
---
Forgot to mention that the other anecdotal evidence I came across is a guy I talked to who got the book to drop off DME trash mobs.

I've laught a lot with this

Well aside from shadow fang, or that other 19 BoE dagger. Yeah, I think they pretty much are. lol From a Classic standpoint.

Read the all thing, I really need to do something with my life

Wait so harder content gets you better gear.... who knew!!  /s

Should work on a paladin, see [here](https://de.classic.wowhead.com/guides/spell-down-ranking-classic).
---
how did you not notice that he gave you herlp? it should have been obvious that he gave you hyelp.
---
How's that even kinda relevant?
---
Auto + HS damage on the lists he was looking at should be adding up to 50-70%. You can even knock a couple percent off the HS damage if you feel like it.
---
I'm guessing according to this
---
https://www.speedrun.com/wowclassic#Level_1-10
---
Man I went to burning steppes last night and got the FP and there‚Äôs a crap ton of quests there
---
Ironforge has all that but more. It's closer to menethil and for quite some time had the only Alliance auction house.
---
Onslaught (horde) are doing the same on skeram. I‚Äôm not sure the alliance guild, but the price of devilsaur has been constant since release
---
Major servers still have this many people in org on retail, during prime time.
---
If you're on that streaming server, then... Yeah
---
My thoughts would be that you can't trade the token for anything, it's just a one time use and you get x respecs, bind on account. 
---
&gt;It adds gold into the economy. At least the subscription tokens in retail do not add gold into the economy.
---
I firmly believe wow tokens increased the rate of inflation since their introduction, and I'm sure it'd do the same to classic. It's *probably* what they're going to do since it's the least work required to make the most money from activision's position (they have already done it and a system for it exists in retail). 
---
And for the folks who do buy them, they *are* just buying gold.
---
Awww blizzards first slot machine mechanic
---
[Here](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/move-anything) you go ;)
---
We‚Äôre outnumbered 2:1 as Alliance.  I haven‚Äôt had too many issues leveling my main and alts yet though.
---
Hell yeah. I just got the 2900 mana water last level and it's a huge difference over the 1900 mana water. I'm always so thirsty!!
---
Earthfury has been an awesome server. Came from Skeram during the first window and it's just gotten better.
---
So, you have a couple of options. First, and this is what I did until SM Cath, is I ran ret and focused on getting improved ret aura. With that, you get plenty of aoe threat (so long as people give you a few seconds to gather aggro). With only ret aura I was able to tank just fine up until that point.
---
At Cath, I respecced to have consecrate and improved righteous fury. The goal here was really to prepare for ZF.
---
When you hit ZF, look for aoe gy runs. Paladin are THE tank for that, and make runs go by absurdly fast.
---
Oh just to make it clear, your main aura is ret and main blessing for other people is salvation. Wisdom or Sanctuary (if you got it) for yourself.
---
Shield spikes are also godly for prot paladin. They get a 30% chance to block 5 times on crit, so if you have a shield spikes you're looking at EVEN MORE aggro (and damage, of course).
---
Prot paladin are also fun because you don't have to worry about sheep/sap/etc. You just run in there and blow things up.
---
Tradeskillmaster (TSM) is an addon that has various functions related to crafting / buying / selling / sniping. What most people refer to in this regard is the sniping module that either refreshes the first page of the auction house looking for new auctions with cheap buyouts or the last page of the auction house with those running out soon and having a really low bid amount. It is insanely fast and will often mean your wrongfully posted auction will be gone before you even had the chance to cancel. 
---
The addon as a whole is meant to help players with large scale crafting / buying / selling operations to make the entire process as seamless as possible while maximizing profit.
---
They're now #6 on warcraftlogs, essentially they meassure raid dps, kill times, deaths etc and the ones with the best results get the highest rankings, because they have faster and cleaner runs that all the other guilds.
---
Not that I know of. I‚Äôve only played a rogue (barely any other class) for 10 years and shadowpanther has always been around.
---
I do this on stalagg too, made 500g on tuesday with dire maul release lol.
---
Healing in instances is fine as enhancement with some intellect gear. Just bring enough water and use lower rank heals when applicable.
---
So you just named 2 weapons better than cruel barb. Shadowfang and Assassins Blade.
---
It doesn't.
---
Queues increased following the server cap reduction, not layering reduction.
---
Remind me what my incentive for scourgestones is? Argent rep? What‚Äôs the end goal there?
---
Where is the campfire?
---
&gt; Heartseeker. Its alliance PvE!
---
Heartseeker is PvP. Windseeker is PvE.
---
It's disappointing because 1.12 MC is pretty heavily nerfed compared to release MC (along with Onyxia and pretty much every dungeon). Some of that is bug fixes and design issues, but quite a few direct nerfs. That combined with better skills, items, and talents in later patches makes it seem stupidly easy when it wasn't originally. 
---
Players are better now, for sure, but there's more to it than that!
---
these transferrs seem way too limited. the server i play on isnt even in the "from" section. and the "to" section is super limited as well. so i cant even use it. my character is still stuck on a dead realm. ive already started releveling on a second one
---
How many rules do these stupid things have haha
---
Could you show me your talents?
---
I'm recently hit 60 and i'm looking to AoE farm ZF but seem to have some troubles with mana (5.5k mana iirc)
---
Thank you so much for transferring off as horde. I mean that sincerely.
---
nah i think i know what im doing ive been hwl before and i have 4000g already farmed thx cya
---
yes, you can line of sight the sacrifce spell by standing close to the doorway for example, its a bit more risky but it should work just fine after a little practice
---
I couldn't count the number of Death Knights I let die because they couldn't be arsed running to a mob and just death gripped it. You taunt it you can deal with it, arsehole.
---
You aren't camped frequently though. Do I get ganked here and there on a daily basis? Yes. Do I actually get camped like 3+ deaths to same person? Could count on 1 hand. It only takes one asshole to camp someone. Less likely to meet them on an alliance heavy server though.
---
Who cares? No one is forcing you to interact with them. If they want to try charging people for their service then that's fine.
---
Speed running is about setting the record for a time. Various speed running categories exist, and if you hold the record it‚Äôs a world record. Ergo this 1-10 levelling is the world record speed for 1-10 probably under All Classes category.
---
Similar to Joana holding the world record fastest 1-60 in vanilla.
---
I would think that the record would have to include a physical DPS with the [Onyxia buff](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=22888/rallying-cry-of-the-dragonslayer). That buff is absolutely broken for a fresh character.
---
Thanks a ton!
---
Okay, so For real last night I was gifted 4 eight slot bags for free as an NE druid lvl 8 from a guy sitting in Dolannar yelling about free bags

---
People will downvote you if they disagree with you or you make them realize their own shortcomings and the only power they have on you is hitting the downvote button and that makes them feel better about themselves, so stop worrying about imaginary internet points that random retards give to you. I always liked the newer origrmar better with the lifts and the zeppelins on top, but I dislike the replacement of the bank and faction leader house in the valley of strength, but that's just like my opinion.
---
The miss rate is a scaling value.  I believe spells have a 9% chance to miss against an equal level player.  Which is why pvp gear typically has less dependence on hit as raid gear.  You'd have to dive into the hit chance formulas for more details.
---
If you are only leveling, grinding, or running 5mans, you can find your hit cap and work from that to your gear.
---
It's a very naive approach that 4% proc chance equals 4% more dmg. It would be kind of accurate, if you were only autoattacking.
---
Yellow hits account for huge amount of your procs, extra attacks give you extra rage, extra crusader uptime etc.
---
Then why does the screenshot say To [Sock]?
---
A better practice for that is to strafe and jump/turn while going to the next mob
---
This is without any help from other chars, aka most common speedrunning rules that all speedrunners use for classic wow. So this is no mail/no trading/no grouping etc. So bassicly same principles as in if a server is fresh (except less players  ofc)
---
You slow af
---
yeah
---
the xp/hr might be slow from BRD, but if you need to grind for HoJ/Gladiator anyways, might as well get your xp from that? Rather than get your xp from quests.
---
They only do this to females that can be identified as such. Unless they are into necro stuff
---
Level as 2h arms. Its more consistent and better in wpvp. Sweeping strikes is also very powerful, it lets you pull 2 mobs at once and cleave them down, not to mention being amazing in dungeons.
---
It increases the spawn range of mobs so a target macro will work from further away. Note that the spyglass is directional (180 degrees infront) so face towards him.
---
For someone without crazy artistic talent, you make me feel more than any other drawings I've ever seen.
---
&gt; STILL ignoring threat generation
---
I‚Äôm done with you son.
---
Nah you could definitely get banned for this back in the day. People would have a program jump periodically so they wouldn't get tagged as AFK. It was a big problem for a while
---
This is 0 help world record, without help from other players and aution house and trading etc.
---
Want to talk me through how to speak to multiple channels at once via Discord?
---
Get mining and run mara
---
Weapon speed is generally an indicator of weapon damage, and Nightblade is so fast that it falls short on weapon damage. I'm comparing these weapons with respect to how hard MS is going to hit in two levels. If the PPM on the effect is similar then that's another plus for Pendulum.
---
I hope he sees this in passing while browsing after a long day of passive-aggressively ' saving ' people and gets second-hand embarrassment of his own embarrassment.
---
Lol that 3.8s later is so true
---
Out of curiosity, what‚Äôs your class and level?
---
Nah, the one i remember made quest objects sparkle.
---
So he forgot to loot one, big woop.
---
Yes people knew BIS.  There were best in slot lists, but they were only for the cutting edge raid tier.  Pre-raid bis wasn't a thing, and people are way over valuing it now.
---
People randomly walk up and /lick my character. Wtf?
---
as a tank, i think it's easier to grind xp in dungeons than solo questing. that means you're likely to run each dungeon upwards of 5 times. so you may need some guidance the first time, but after that you'll remember where to go and it's much smoother
---
Need argent dawn rep to get into Naxx + other benefits.

The guy you gotta kill in DM East is Hydrospawn. Here's a super drawn out explanation if this doesn't do it for ya (from wowhead)
---
&gt;Navigating in Dire Maul (DM):There are 3 sections of DM (North, East and West). Only 2 sections concern this quest, which is North and East. The questgiver is in the North, and the quest item is from the East. You will need a Crescent key to enter the North instance or a rog with max lock picking skill (Engineers, I have already tried blowing the doors up. Didn't work).  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Upon entering DM from Feralas, you just need to follow the corridor till you reach a "T" path (you will notice a huge double wooden door at the T - Only graphics, cannot be opened). To the sides of the door, there are two slip-in entries. Go through both of them and it will bring you into a courtyard with ogres. Hugging the right wall will take into the east instance, left to west and straight across the courtyard is north.  
---
&gt;Aggro range here is very small so its easy to slip past them. Dog patrols exist and they see through invis.  
---
&gt;Step 1: Obtaining a Crescent Key [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=35607](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=35607)This is gotten from the east instance (entering from the courtyard). Immediately entering the instance, you see a non-aggro imp on your left. Speak to him and he will start running. Fight your way in the direction he ran to (right of entering the instance). Speak to him again, and he starts running. It goes on for a couple of times.  
---
&gt;By hugging the right wall and killing everything in the way, enter the 2nd corridor (1st one takes¬† you out of the instance). Go all the way straight down the corridor downstairs and hug the right wall, killing everything in your way. Go upstairs and you should see the imp there again. Talking to him will trigger him to fight. He spawns little imps over time, so focus your dps on him and deal with the non-elite adds after.  
---
&gt;Loot the key.  
---
&gt;Step 2: Where's the questgiver?  
---
&gt;This can be done solo without any means of invis. Upon entering the north instance, there is a group of 3 ogres to your left and 1 wandering ogre infront of you. If you see the 3 ogres, you should also see a ramp down near them. Wait for the wanderer to move away and head down the ramp. Jump off the left side of the ramp to avoid the 2nd group of ogres, and head down another ramp.  
---
&gt;This will bring you to another door that needs the Crescent key. Through that, all the way, takes you to the library. Questgiver is straight ahead of you, 1st bookshelf to your left.  
---
&gt;Step 3: Getting the Hydrospawn Essence.  
---
&gt;Eastern instance, coming from courtyard zone-in, hug the right wall, through the 2nd corridor, 1st right into a hall filled with Satyr demons and plants. Kill your way along the left wall and take the left turn below the ramp. Kill along the left wall again and this will take you to a pool with hydrospawn in it.  
---
&gt;He spawns little water elementals as well, but they despawn when Hydrospawn dies. So focus dps on him again. Immune to cold.  
---
&gt;Step 4: Back to quest giver.  
---
&gt;Sorry if this seems a little long. But I didn't do any DM runs prior to this quest. I'm sure many fellow mages are alike. I hope this gives you more help than you need.
---
More of an issue when you are higher level (aka 60) since these % increases are much more impactful (relatively speaking) than another 10-15 stat/attack power/spell power when we have upwards of 300-400.
---
Regarding hit, going you can't view it as 'only' a 6% or 8% increase you have to view it as going from missing 1 out of 11 attacks (91% hit) to missing 1 out of 100 attacks (99% hit ala hit cap).
---
On my server Grobbulous we have players that do this every day. 
---
My mount was paid for by someone else and 3 of my friends had donations as well. 
---
My entire guilds bags have been made for free from guildies or people advertising literally ‚Äúfree bags‚Äù in city. 
---
And run through a are also common because they‚Äôre usually helping guildies and friends and want to fill slots.
---
Maybe your server just sucks.
---
Cool cool :) Thanks for clearing that up.
---
It's what it's always been. People kept saying there were choices but ultimately there weren't rly. It was either suboptimal to some degree,  niche use, or optimal and everyone followed it. Which isnt rly different from retail now.
---
As much as things change they stay the same.
---
Yeah I think the strongest argument is probably the stats and talents.
---
I remember raiding in vanilla and we used ventrilo and made fun of people who were keyboard turning. I don‚Äôt think we were as bad as you might think. We didn‚Äôt have nearly as much experience, and it is true our networks and computers were worse, so things like just missing a heal because of lag were true and happened a lot, but yeah I think the revamped talents and gear really make the difference to make the content trivial.
---
I remember trying to fight Rag in vanilla and it was impossible to even attempt below 150 fire resistance, you‚Äôd be taking tons of damage. And there was a big Dps check due to submerge and the adds, which is why the fight was so hard, you needed to have enough dps while still maintaining high fire resistance, and this was with bringing 2-3 fire absorb potions.
---
I can‚Äôt figure out how it was so hard back then yet is completely trivial now unless it‚Äôs just that we are way stronger than we were in vanilla.
---
Only way I could see Classic being monetized is if the WoW Token was broken up to where 1 token was valued at \~$0.01 USD. So 1450 Tokens would get you a 30-day sub.
---
Then, you make it so Classic players can buy the tokens for their sub from the Retail supply. But cannot sell them. So, basically, Retail buys the tokens and puts them up for purchase by either other Retail-players and Classic-players.
---
Maybe offer a discount, 1200 tokens for Classic, but you're now locked out of Retail; 1450 still gets you access to both.
---
This way, if you play only Classic and can farm and play "for free" as well.
---
Now, this would require the Gold per Token cost to be reevaluated. Since Retail's gold is suffering from hyperinflation due to the crazy amounts awarded by even just vendoring 'trash' from BFA (think it's up to like 1 gold for a single piece).
---
((If tokens are still going for around 140k, that'd be 96 gold per token if they were broken up into smaller units. That's still a bit high for Classic.))
---
Other than that...**NO!** To monetization.
---
Those sites are the most valuable source of gold inflation metrics in the game. 
---
Launch: 1g = $3
---
Now: 100g = $35
---
Buy twink items and rare items if you have spare gold. Better store of value on a macro scale.
---
Okay, you're saying it doesn't, and I'm saying it does and providing a reason. Think I'll go with the choice that has better rage during combat, better stance dancing, better WW damage, better tanking capability and sweeping strikes over.... Uhh... Not a fat lot?
---
Well according to the leaderboard it's the current WR for mage.. Can check it out at https://www.speedrun.com/wowclassic#Level_1-10
---
Guess I‚Äôve just been unlucky in which guides. I have read.  Pretty heavily downvoted.  So I must be wrong here.
---
I dont know how much the recipe sells for (I got it from a drop somewhere), but getting enchantment of minor beastslaying and selling enchants for the glow is a way to make some money.  I sell minor beastslaying for 60s + tip and get 1 or 2 enchants an hour.  Not super efficient but better then nothing.
---
How was the g/hr lasher farming? Did you ever Mara farm?
---
You can zone in diremaul east, die. Then zone in north to get quest without key.
---
Try to wipe the foam from your mouth, I'm sure they're cookin' up way worse shit than this.
---
Nope, even Failure (RL for Risen) was saying it could be possible ( Risen was top 10 Us at the time)  with the beam doing 230k dmg or the tentacules spawning in the stomach, but he was sure it could be done. Then Blizzard has made the patch C'Thun in the night before Eu reset, that's why Nihilium did the 1st world.
---
at the time C'thun was the Guild devorer, many of them just imploded because of the time it takes (clearing the path) just to come back after tries and tries for month, people would just /quit. 
---
As said below, Ion was the GL for Elitist jerk and has send his theorycraft  to Blizzard, to explain that it was impossible for a full opti raid to down the boss in any way, hence the patch.
---
Because blizzard, or any gaming company, doesn't have loads of data and numbers about their playerbase. Could it be that, there were FAR MORE people at level 60 and chewing through MC then they expected? 
---
Streamers were complaining we needed DM as early as week 2. It didn't come out at week 2.
---
It's called chance on *hit* for a reason.
---
I've been 60 for a couple weeks now, I have my epic mount and my robes of the archmage - the two biggest gold sinks out there currently. So I'm asking myself now, what do I even need gold for any more? There's all sorts of grinding spots I can hit up, but I'm not even sure I want to spend time doing it because I'm not sure why I'd need an excessive amount since there aren't as many gold sinks in Classic as there is retail. I'm not really interesting in leveling enchanting or engineering, two other gold sinks, and don't have any alts at the moment I could transfer over to. So am I missing something here?
---
Nah. I‚Äôve fished for 90 minutes in one spot and got a GM whispering me a math problem. Lol.
---
alliance on Kromcrush here, should I transfer? I haven't really noticed any overcrowding or faction balance issues, but maybe I'm just too low level
---
Btw any mages watching, 100% doable as arc frost! Don‚Äôt waste your gold respeccing
---
Ranking is dependent on your faction's total honor. So the faction imbalance won't make it any easier or harder.
---
horde are always like "where are the allies???" someone is like "they all left" and then, inevitably, they're like "fucking pussies lmao"
---
Every so often when I'm idling in a major city I'll notice a low level run and stop next to me and target me. 5-8 seconds pass which indicates that they're 'mirin so I just open up trade and give them a gold or two. May not seem much but 1 gold below level 10 or even 20 is incredible and if you're smart, you can make a lot more if you invest it.
---
It‚Äôs a number, obviously you have to make it bigger. Jokes aside are you going to raid? Repairs and consumables maybe? And are you ever going to level an alt? It‚Äôd help when you do eventually do that. Just what comes to my mind.
---
I've got some land on the moon that i will sell you....
---
Stop being a pedant. People don't like that.
---
Why? I don‚Äôt care about pvp too much. I don‚Äôt want to get ganked. In retail I can play with the whole region if we are in the same faction. Even more if I play horde. In classic I rather have an option to play with 4k concurrent players than 2k only.
---
Cheaper than AH just means "in trying to sell this immediately, because I don't want to wait for the market naturally"
---
Depends on what "worth it" is considering the longer time investment to grind mobs than to quest.  That being said,  If you're able to fill up a lot of your time from 54 up with dungeon grinding (just live in BRD lol), then yes, you'll have a ton of quests to still do at 60 that now give more gold.
---
Theres tons of people in lfg on earthfury alliance.  I've pugged almost all 60 dungeons in the last week every night successfully.  There was a pug MC this weekend.  To be fair I'm a warrior tank so its easier for me..
---
Hard to Zoom when you're sitting down for storytime huh?
---
We are talking about classic right?
---
We priests do appreciate our mobile canteens.
---
I mean, I did?
---
Best enchants on all gear, preparing twinks to name a few.
---
I only half believe this happens. Level 40 and 13 gold total. No mount in sight anytime soon.
---
&gt; game threat is not an issue for tanks that know what they are doing.
---
Explain. What beats hitting HS and sunder at same time and spamming that with some SS thrown in?
---
I don't know there seems to be tons and tons of war/bear tanks on my server but there is also a crapload of players. Multiply that by how many classes are DPS and also want to do dungeons and I think that's the issue. There are a lot of tanks in my guild that are just plain out sick of running certain dungeons too (I don't blame them). A few said they ran so many strat/scho that they are already exalted with AD and never want to touch them again. Same with some other dungeons.
---
If I were in their shoes i'd prob be the same tbh. Average dps player might run a dungeon a handful of times, get their prebis and not touch it again. Tanks prob run most endgame dungeons dozens upon dozens of times and burnout of them.
---
It was to stop people from choosing between using 2% or even the rare 3% to 'hit/crit/dodge/whatever' items from level 60's raiding when they were level 70 raid gear at 1% of 'x' with more stats.
---
Yeah i got it but i can't seem to add multiple spaces to make it work correctly haha.
---
Did you play at odd hours? Because Kirtonos is fine for Alliance. I have no issues. Do I occasionally get ganked? YES! it is a PvP server FFS...
---
Follow up: Striped Frostsaber or Striped Dawnsaber?
---
Everything I don‚Äôt like is racist
---
&gt;We pay a monthly fee for a game they've already completed 100% and had running live for years. 
---
Probably pays for the team and fees and nothing else, if it even covers that much. 
---
&gt;That's the only monetization they're going to get. 
---
I highly doubt this, they have shareholders - shareholders want money.
---
&gt;I will cancel my sub the second they try to squeeze more out of us.
---
ok
---
Mind if I ask what spec that is? I need to start farming my mount while still being able to heal
---
No, the problem is that Blizzard does not enforce faction balance through hard limits. Players shouldn't have to stick around and play something they don't enjoy while waiting for Blizzard to get their act together. It's not the responsibility to maintain server balance.
---
 "Prebisfilbin" is 12 chars
---
Started as Horde on Heartseeker. Haven't been able to level at all since the great Alliance migration from Herod. Horde is now outnumbered like 6-1 and every FP/quest hub/mob camp is filled with Alliance gank squads now.
---
Fury leveling is a lot faster till 40 where MS outweighs all the dps benefits from Fury.
---
Like in your bag? You could get any number of bag addons. Try Bagnon. It highlights quest items in your bag with a yellow glow I believe.
---
You can show it off if you are wearing it, how's that?
---
"i love the classic wow community, it's so great!" = i got free stuff once.  i'll never pay it forward but i'll get some reddit karma for it
---
Okay champ!
---
Oh, thats true
---
Do you have two Freezing Bands? Because that'll cost ya.
---
Also it's just nice to have a cash pile of 1000+ gold for when new content comes out or you want to buy something nice for a future alt. 
---
That said, you probably don't want to straight up grind gold if you don't enjoy it and evidently don't entirely need it. Continue doing things you enjoy (e.g. 5-man dungeons for BiS gear you might be missing or to help guildies; quests you want to wrap up), and the gold will accumulate as a side-effect.
---
Depends on the time. I soloed tethis but It was at about 6:30am. Significantly less people on at time. After work there are a ton of people on and it's super busy.
---
You can only see this on classic ... &lt;3
---
&gt;World Record
---
WAT
---
Alliance from Kromcrush here. Are the factions unbalanced any? I haven't had any issues so far but maybe I'm not high enough level yet to experience it. Stormwind and Iron Forge always seem bustling
---
That‚Äôs how I feel. I was leveling fury until 31.  So I decided to switch just to test things out and it was such a massive difference I couldn‚Äôt believe it. The game went from hard mode to cassual mode of me killing 2-3 mobs at the same time and breezing through quests.
---
Trying to farm this thing is a pain though. Most groups dont want to do that boss and I've killed him 6 times without a drop.
---
Been using Songbird Blouse as a substitute until it drops
---
Consider the other stat increases on the gear.  +20 agility.  Look at how much your dps changes when you add or remove gear.  20 agility may not even add 1% dps, depending on your other gear.  But you still want that +20 agi because it has followon effects in the raid.
---
Crit is more useful for some classes than others.  A normal crit does 150% damage.  This means that 1% crit roughly translates to +0.5% damage.  However, a lot of classes, Warlocks and Rogues come to mind, have boosts to their crit damage.  This makes that crit do 200% damage or more.  And then that translates to +1% dps or higher.  Crit scales very well.  The better the rest of your gear, the more crit will push your damage.
---
Hit has been discussed already, so dodge is the last one you mentioned (and we'll add block too).  Tanks rely on healers to keep them up but the more avoidance they have, the less damage they take, the longer a healer's mana lasts.  So blocking or dodging a boss attack means a significant gain for the raid.  Adding 1% dodge can really help a tank.  Block % is the most important stat for a tank.  This can push extremely damaging hits, 'crushing blows' off the attack roll for a boss.  You need a specific percentage to reach this point and every 1% is extremely valuable.  Crushing blows can turn a tank into a ghost really quickly, despite constant heals.  Even if there is a 1% chance for back to back crushing blows, you have to decide if that risk (potentially wiping) is worth it.
---
&gt; but then most everyone playing classic is just flowering a leveling guide and picking the talents they are told to.
---
I really dont think this is the case tho.
---
You realize this is classic right? This raid has more blues than epics. Everyone is getting gear here. You are delusional.
---
gear just become stats, and rest of the game becomes just dress up
---
if i see a guy in full warlord i know i should be fucking careful cause he's gonna blast my asshole
---
The alliance on Arcanite Reaper are pretty sweet.
---
Curious if anyone does this. Last census from a month ago showed similar faction balance between the two but earthfury is probably much smaller pop. It feels like bigglesworth is hovering around 55/45 to me.
---
Hahah, I actually just graduated from the Photonics Engineering Technology program in April. I still have a bunch of boys there and some in the program I believe
---
I like the idea of playing feral dps druid a lot. I've leveled to 60 and cleared mc. I still regret it. I'm last priority on all gear, I'm given bear/resto items as priority before offspec rolls. 
---
I'm starting to level a rogue.
---
If you had a 60 Healer and DPS who understand how threat works you could take it at 54, it'd just be difficult. Did my first DM East run with a 55 Tank and 55 Healer and it was easy
---
You're deluded. The OP was asking how much per. The seller wanted to base his price on how much gold the seller has.
---
"How much?"
---
"How much you got"
---
Seller is the douche here. And sorta you, for not reading it before getting into in argument where you are just wrong.
---
Oh yeah.
---
Searing Gorge/Felwood, then un'goro/EPL/blasted lands, then winterspring/burning steppes/WPL
---
I wish that I could
---
Give you more than one upvote
---

---
I can just tell you that I got from around 28 to where I am now at 48 by pure questing, no grinding, and a single SM lib run using Route 1. There was never a time where I fell behind, had to run all over the place for quests or was forced to grind to unlock quests. If the route works for me, then it works for everyone. Plus, if you haven't played in a few days, you'll have a healthy amount of rested exp to boost you further. I also used this to level a tank/healer druid alt and switch back and forth between the two to keep it fresh and coincidentally speed things up with rested exp.
---
Using a route makes leveling a breeze and care free, because I know that I can explore and fuck around and eventually get back on a path if I feel lost. I can only encourage you to give it another try, it's a lot of fun and will be even better at 60.
---
basically everything quest in strat-scholo give 5g per turn in... + wathever the quest reward sells for ( couple weapons in there).
---
it's definately a nice source of gold for fresh 60s.
---
Ok so why do I do helpful things for people that I feel neutral about ( or some that I don't even like ) and feel neutrally bleh about how delighted they are I helped? I definitely get gratification for helping people I know, like my family and wife, but I get nothing and feel nothing from helping strangers. not even a little tiny warmth in my heart. Its literally just to be helpful, not because I want to feel good.
---
Analyze it all you want, but not everything is super cynical like you think, and you saying " that's how it works " only reinforces people thinking they should just be selfish instead, and thats just helping the problem instead.
---
good ol biizzard
---
That would also work but i honestly can't be bothered to make one to gain micro seconds of bandage time that might not even count as a tick lol
---
yeah no clue who tought this was a good idea, maybe kick in shins is needed
---
Underrated comment
---
nah they're just weeding out the morons who shouldn't have been hired in the first place.
---
Does anybody know what quest addon he is using?
---
‚ÄúGo on with your bad self‚Äù (literally the passive petty retort I aspire to daily)
---
&gt;Server Max Capacity = Layer Max Capacity \* Number of Layers. 
---
False.  
---
As a developer with some (basic) cloud knowledgement, I wish that it would be so simple.
---
The game has been out for 15 years. Wtf are you talking about lol?
---
Got a guildie to help me out with the tusks from trolls in STV and final elite, bought the charms and lifeblood from AH (they were mad cheap)
---
sounds like the intended the pun
---
Normal realms. Pagle is crazy ally
---
I have leveled a Hunter from 1-60 questing/grinding only on a PServer, and am lvl 56 in Classic.  I can speak to the Hunter side with some confidence;
---
1. BM is the king of Hunter questing/grinding.  The talents in the BM Tree boost pet damage to about equal to Character damage; and bring so much sustain you almost never spend time drinking/eating. MM is great Character damage output, you just constantly pull aggro and spend half the time kiting &amp; meleeing  vs pewpewing as BM. Highly recommend a pet with Screech (Bat, Owl, Carrion Bird) - Screech is a SMALL AOE ability that does little damage, and applies a AP Debuff.  This makes farming upwards of 4 mobs a cakewalk as your pet tanks everything.  
---
2. Hunters are maximum Chill...especially once you master petattack macro's.  A BM Hunter with decent pet management skills can pull upwards of 4 mobs at a time and just pewpew autoattack all down before your pet needs attention.  If spec'd into Spirit Bond your pet may be at 100% Health before your done looting/skinning the last pack.  Using Bestial Wrath on CD and knowing when/where to Mend Pet, Stun, Trap, Etc. will guarantee fast leveling - depending on mob availability.  
---
3. Not a mage expert, but yes I believe it is annoying from a lvl 30 mage alt perspective. 
---
4. Again not a mage expert, but from experience - yes it can still be fast if you practice high level kiting &amp; mob management skills.  That would allow you to still pull multiple mobs at a time.  
---
5. My biggest struggle with Ammo is simply the fact it takes up a normal bag slot.  Makes farm runs a little shorter if vendoring all greys/whites.  I wouldn't call it a hindrance if you understand some advanced mechanics of the game; namely 
---
   1. Mail an alt/friend dozens of stacks of ammo then click return, and use mailboxes as your ammo bank (useful for zones without arrows or bullets at vendors)
---
   2. In your Combat Log tab of chat, edit so Pet Info is enabled - this shows you when your Feed Pet buff ends.  By doing this, you never waste a single 'tick' of feeding - thus maximizing your food usage.  TIP: Don't send pet into combat until feed buff ends, it will end the buff and you lose out on happiness.  You will pick up enough food items from grinding that you MAY never have to pay for food (Depends on pet type)
---
6. This is not a huge time sync, as almost every leveling zone contains tamable beasts with potential ability upgrades.  It's not always worth the time to walk across a continent so you can get Bite (Rank 3) over Bite (Rank 2).  I typically have wow-pettopia open in a separate window and just scan it for all tamable beasts in whichever zone i'm leveling, and just pick up each new rank as I go.
---
I am torn between mage and warlock. I like the class fantasy of warlock a lot, but really dislike the pet mechanic. I want to be able to solo things at 60 with relative ease (compared to other classes), but want to make sure I am still able to get group invites. I love the idea of mage AOE farming but I understand everyone and their mom is a mage so worry I won't be able to get groups as easily as a warlock.
---
I also have this weird thing where if I hate my warlock pets name (like the voidwalker at 10) I have some pseudo-OCD that makes me reroll to get a new one. Stupid I know. So I'd like to avoid that.
---
Any suggestions?
---
That actually makes sense. But you delay the SS by 5 levels.
---
The color of owl‚Äôs feathers helps them blend into their environment (camouflage).
---
You might end up in Detroit (stonetalon under the map) if your instance fails to be created in one of the examples above that would otherwise put you in the instance.
---
On high volume commodities it‚Äôs a pretty fair term.
---
When I was leveling my enchanting I practically demanded every warrior in stonetalon allow me to put +5 str on their bracers for free. They had no choice.
---
It definitely works for heals. Anything with multiple ranks in your spellbook. Try opening your spellbook and your macro, then shift-clicking the rank you want.
---
You have no benedictions in guild that saddens me as a priest.
---
Our hunters suffer cos it's always an eye and not leaf lol
---
&gt; they are just buying gold
---
From other players who got it through normal means.
---
i got a mage called goldenshower. hope noone reports me :X
---
No you can't kite either.
---
Pet on bottom hunter on spectacular ledge.
---
Pull with pet stay and eyes of beast. 
---
Juggle threat with feign death with both bosses
---
Cross realm bgs happened in Vanilla
---
Not OP, but I can assure you the answer is no. It's very difficult to do real damage to a mob 8-9 levels higher than you, and as a warrior you can't kite and chip away at their health. Plus elementals are immune to bleeds, which makes it even harder. I find soloing a mob 4 levels above me to be a bit risky; 8-9 is basically impossible.
---
The only way to solo farm those at level 30 is to farm the gold to buy them on AH.
---
That's a tough one. I'd have to go with Frostsaber, but I like both of them.
---
There's so much good gear to get in BRD, Dire Maul, etc. that I've personally had a hard time justifying any solo play in this level bracket. I'm basically just running instances to get pre-raid BiS non-stop till 60.
---
Maybe you're a worse player now
---
Or you can install Atlas addon \^\^
---
That was just a feature they added to the game. If you achieved it through an add-on, it would now be very bannable.
---
&gt; That's cool! Do you know the patch? I couldn't see an upload date, but I wonder if this was after the Heroic Nerf. If not, boy were we hot garbage. Granted none of us had Kara gear at the time.
---
It says so under the video.

While I don't remember which patch that was, I do remember my gear - a mix of blues and karazhan gear. 
---
The shield, for example, was https://www.wowhead.com/item=25828/petrified-lichen-guard (as I needed SOMETHING that would damage them and my "dps" was a joke)
---
No, it wasn't after the 30% nerf, that was patch 3.0, which would be released much, much later. At that point, I could have pretty much run the whole fucking place solo, with the exception of caster packs/bosses, against which I had little defense (you could reflect and interrupt some spells, but not all and not often enough).
---
My point wasn't that warriors were supermen back then (although they were, IF PLAYED CORRECTLY); it's that all these "you need(ed) CC" myths are just...myths promoted by terrible healers and terrible tanks.

In a normal (5 people) run, I'd replace some avoidance gear with tps gear and just roflstomp everything, as I wouldn't have to slowly chip mobs to death myself - 3 dps would take care of them.
---
It was the same in vanilla (that warrior was leveled and played in vanilla; it even has a TF from back then). A good warrior wouldn't need CC and wouldn't bother with it, as they'd prefer to run with 3 melee dps for one simple reason: no downtime. 
---
I currently play a mage in "wow classic" and it's annoying AF. Kill one pack, drink. Kill another pack, drink. I'm only getting invited to groups because most tanks are utter shit and the group "needs" CC (and of course, healers don't mind AI and free water). 
---
All I'm saying (and all I was saying with that video, at the time; it was only uploaded as proof) was that you didn't NEED CC at all; it brought nothing to the table, other than making an instance twice as long as it should be (or wose). You could just stomp packs to hell with 3 melee dps (rogue/warriors, as hunters still had to drink back then).
---
I'm leveling a tank now (in classic) and I'll probably just try to get 3 melee groups with a resto shaman for WF.
---
&gt; I dont have a very big window to get agro any more. If i dont pull the dps is already aoeing
---
That's a training issue, them dying makes them wait.
---
I'm guessing they are doing this to remove layering, but i highly doubt many people will leave. Incendius is an awesome server, with the perfect faction balance.
---
Nothing more satisfying than popping an Ally in one hit, especially when they opened up on you at range.
---
Do you think the team that got classic up and running works for free or?
---
I just did this last weekend. Copying from my normal pc (to play via usb on laptop) did not work.
---
I simply re downloaded and installed battle.net app direct to usb drive and used that to install classic. From there you can open BNet and run wow from the drive. I didn't have the best experience but it was playable, and I was on a Surface.
---
Classic Codex
---
You can go kill elements in arathi highlands. They drop charms in a pretty good rate. They sell up to 50 silver a piece on my server. Warriors buy them, they need those charms for their ww axe quests.
---
Herod was good until the guild Hades came.
---
Resto sham question. What is more import healing power or mp5. 
---
This is with the idea that in raid I will mostly be spamming rank 1 chain heal, rank 3 chain heal when things get hairy, and lesser healing wave max rank for quick single target. And then I use downranked healing wave when things are chill.
---
Currently I have mostly mp5 gear (i think im close to 45ish mp5 without healing stream), 5k mana pool unbuffed, and probably around 230ish+ in +healing. I have been told I need to start just going for way more healing power. Since it will make my downrank healing spells heal so much more and ill need to cast less heals.
---
 Any seasoned shams have some good advice on what stat is truely the better priority?
---
Also want to get onyxia mp5 trink and dmw mp5 trink. Then would it be much safer to prio heal pow?
---
I actually misread windseeker! Lmao
---
What if some people‚Äôs way to have fun in the game is min maxing?
---
Yeah my dad got a cold phone call from "Microsoft Support" and got conned into giving them ¬£300 to "clean" his PC.
---
It's easy for us to judge others for falling for scams because we're tech savvy and spend a lot of time in front of a computer. To people who have very primitive knowledge of computers it's an easy scam to fall for.
---
PoE bulk prices are more expensive because the trading system is absolute garbage and it's a pain in the ass to buy large quantities.
---
In WoW, you just install Auctionator and buy all the stuff you need instantly from the AH
---
I thought the same.. apparently it's a very used and abused named
---
in 1v1 they own sure,
---
in BGs it's a lot more complicated.
---
That argument hurts my brain...
---
+this, Everyone‚Äôs super friendly and helpful (when you can actually land a group anyway)
---
I think the best outcome would be to have them stock up on souls and only create healthstones in combat ? Either using a pot or casting to use the stronger HS.
---
I really hope you're right -- I have only 35g at level 35. My son (and quest partner) is playing a warlock, so he'll get his mount right away. I don't want to be walking while he's riding.
---
having more hit is never bad, IIRC with +10 sill the cap on yellow attacks is at 6% hit. so you effectually only need 1% from gear.
---
HOWEVER
---
auto attacks still have a hitcap of 27%, white damage is a massive portion of your overall damage. 
---
9% hit is fine. in phase 1 BIS gear i think you are at 11 or 12%. if you are a non human and only have 305 skills you need 8%.
---
You can also tick a box so any action in game will active a search.
---
As long as your alliance. I hit 60 on westfall horde and had to reroll on a diff server cuz it‚Äôs so fucking dead
---
I had Alliance Needs Purple Lotus on retail for whenever people asked for the Wintergrasp quest.  One day I'm in there sharing with the masses and someone shares back Alliance Needs Roast Raptor.  Still have them both in my log.
---
The person who does the quest still has to hand it in at the library so they‚Äôll want a key or friend anyway
---
Dawnsaber.
---
then in that respect blizzard need to do something, i mean if its not in the T&amp;C then no rules have been broken. Then theyll have to update the T&amp;Cs and then start going after people if things dont change.
---
The /s is strong with this comment.
---
Yes, they are going to -give- me the tank gear that the other two don't need. If they have something better I will get the item. 
---
Are you suggesting that I should be able to roll on DPS gear while receiving 3rd prio on tank gear? Is that deemed acceptable? Asking because I don't clearly know where the boundaries are, it would seem unfair to the DPS I imagine if I was getting this free tank gear on top of competing with them for their loot.
---
I have not asked to roll on DPS gear yet, I'm in a strange limbo-like situation right now with my current guild which is why I'm trying to figure out how to achieve what's best for me.
---
It was exactly like that for me. Started to play on zandalar tribe alli and at lvl10 I had 3 10slot bag amd one 8slot bag and 5 gold. People were generous amd I didnt even begged for it they just run to me in sw and gave it to me lol.
---
&gt; Have you looked into how many new subscribers they got from Classic?
---
I'd definitely be curious to know how many were: new, current but testing, came and went. 
---
&gt;If you think they are having trouble paying for their shitty servers or the pathetic dev team that can't fix bugs that were pointed out extensively during the Beta, you are supremely delusional.
---
Not what I said, not how *profit* works. 
---
&gt;They are rolling in money right now. Even after they fucked up the launch so badly and the server populations are completely whack.
---
Activision is sure, they have *many* avenues of income and no one entity really needs that much profit to keep the others solvent. That's the point of monetization, and why their only currently product that does not have it will probably have it before long. 
---
&gt;You are very out of touch you should probably delete this thread and your comments
---
I have a pretty deep understanding of how general business strategy works, it's kind of surprising how many people are thinking emotionally about this instead of how a massive business entity would - they've demonstrated how they do business time and time again but for some crazy reason folks are always like, "but why blizz?!" like it's some huge surprise they want to make as much profit as possible.
---
it is if you are buying

For now, a lot of rep rewards are worth having depending on your professions.  Also, the fire resist to shoulders is a nice enchant as a melee too.

---
For phase 6 you will need to be at least honored, but the higher the better, for Naxx attunement.
---
Also, depending on your end-game goals, some nice naxx blue catchup gear in phase 6 is cheaper with higher rep:

---
So if you're looking for something to do now, argent dawn is a good rep to work on.  Or like i said any of those other zones are good too :)
---
50-50 from my experience.
---
It's a good realm, easy to find groups, pugs for mc etc.
---
Peace can only be won by an alliance with the brunch babes.
---
Yes, alliance. Legion of Lo Pan. We noticed a Horde Guild re-rolled alliance  too
---
Jack of all trades (minus oomkin range dps). True feral dps requires alot, but resto and feral tank are plenty viable :)
---
Classic is supposed to be Vanilla. It isn't supposed to be the end all be all for video games. When it's time comes I'm sure you will have fun either rerolling or continuing on to BC or Classic+
---
I never got to do two things in vanilla: AQ and Naxx. So the whole point of coming back is in part to do those things. And I don't expect it to last forever.
---
Yes, I would.  I dont like playing horde at all because of their looks.
---
Elemental Master Spec.
---
Try this:
---
/equipslot 16 Main hand weapon
---
/equipslot 17 off hand weapon or shield
---
It hit me for 3.5k in this weeks raid lol
---
Shit doesn't die in any particularly fast speed so I would just buy mats when they were cheap on AH. Also doesn't help that I would just send my friends bags if they needed them and I had the mats.
---
I'd think it's reasonable ot assume a warlock have a healthy stack of soulshard ready.
---
they don't fade upon logging off or anything.
---
k kiddo
---
What a dweeb, but damn it if I'm not envious of his life, getting paid heaps of cash to play video games and act like a tool.
---
Check out melderon on YouTube for the stats, but in p1-3 it's generally considered to max out mp5, because it takes a lot of +healing to make downranking more Mana efficient
---
If you're in SoS and only have 85 herbalism, you're missing out on a lot of potential $.  If you're a healbot, grinding mobs is going to be slower than other classes and as a result non-combat ways of making money will be more advantageous to you (comparatively).  I'd spend a bit of time getting your herbalism up so that you can get the free money associated with picking herbs that are in the zones you'll be grinding in anyway.
---
Having said that, if you're careful, trolls in STV may be a good, level-appropriate option with cloth drops and some AH-able stuff (Green hills pages, greens).
---
It's well balanced. I'm alliance so I can't speak for the Horde side, but it should be similar. Evenings are very active. Easy to find a pug. Tuesdays and Wednesdays there are some MC/Ony pugs going on. Bunch of guilds farming those raids. Offpeak hours there will be some empty zones and farming spots and also some difficulty finding groups. 
---
Overall, feels more like a vanilla server than most. If you want prime time to be popping but off hours are quiet, it's a good choice. If you want to be able to log on at any time and find a group near instantly, stick to heavier pop servers.
---
No official one I believe maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have said that as a statement. But logically since layers are only here to prevent people from being way too many in the same area it‚Äôs safe to assume their role isn‚Äôt to allow even more people at the same time on the server. Blizzard even said they could allow way more people to log in on the servers (which they actually did once to lower the queues), and that has nothing to do with more layers. Layers are just a QoL feature for players.
---
Level 60 version of the story from last night:
---
Saw a group was looking to replace 1 DPS in Strat Live - end of Live side run, doing a Dead side (was late already so a DPS likely had to leave and let them know.)
---
I just made it to UC since my HS has been in Kargath, I did not grab the FP from EPL yet, so I'm having to trek over there with my 60% mount - I take what felt like forever to get there, got dismounted not once, not twice, but four times! So I finally make it into the gates (after getting dismounted again) and see the trash is still up - I went into the wrong ent and they had used the backdoor - FUCK.... the gates are also locked preventing me from leaving so I said, 'okay' i'll die'...
---
While dying, I notice I was no longer taking any Health loss and my TeamSpeak DC's - yup my fucking Internet craps out and takes like 3-5 minutes to get back on again - at this point I was just going to log back in and tell them sorry, since I assumed they've had enough and were thinking I DC'ed to bail on them from being so stupid as to go into wrong gate.
---
I finally log in, got a 'WB' party message and the hunter in the group had even went back to entrance to give me Aspect to speed my walk over to them. At this point they've cleared almost the way up to the  Magistrate Barthilas in the at least 15 mins it took from when I got invited to the group to reaching them. Rest of the run goes great - having 2 Shackles for the Aboms along with the added Vamp healing to help with Baron fight make it a breeze and I walk out of the run with the Baron caster Shadow mace.
---
I like this
---
I think the point he is making is that there is plenty of alternative items to the *best* in slot piece.
---
 For example - My ‚ÄúBIS‚Äù bracers come from UBRS last boss but there is a fantastic alternative from Timmy in Strat love.
---
Dude I rp a beggar which is pretty accurate since I‚Äôm pre lvl20 warrior. A lot of kind and rich souls in Org
---
Yeah same, feel bad for the warriors I think they have a class quest drop there.
---
Yeah, I think that could be a reasonable compromise!
---
Like others have said, even without a healthstone locks are going to be monsters to beat.
---
Yeah a friend that's leveling with me is doing enchanting and making sure everything I have is enchanted as soon as I equip it. So I'll be helping him get his mount
---
Make druid. /wrists until lv 10. Get bear. Never go back to NE zone. NE starter is crap. If it's an alt, get a SW port and lvl elsewhere imo. Hearth back for bear quest and repeat
---
Warriors were not using rend, no fap pots used, and obviously no engineering, and on private servers so no leeway, I didn‚Äôt even see retaliation...
---
Weird. Asmongold had to manually click each strand of hair on his head and pick Not interested.
---
I've mostly left enchanting alone save for disenchants and focused on tailoring to make money. Most people don't give a shit about enchants at lower levels so I know it is pointless at the moment for me.
---
Thinking to move my horde characters from Pagle to Windseeker..any thoughts on that ?
---
Also, since you tried to nova at the end it will keep the mob attacking you, if you did nothing chances are it would‚Äôve evaded and ran back as soon as it got within range.
---
Go the salt flats of 1k needles and kill the turtles east of the raceway until you get tired if it then go back to questing and youl get enough gold
---
We will price it: one hundred billion gold

I‚Äôm pretty sure it says ‚Äú&lt;Name&gt; makes some strange gestures.‚Äù
---
Doesn‚Äôt translate.
---
We had 2 bindings back-to-back in our first 2 MC runs. Unfortunately it was the same half haha.
---
What I don't understand is why potions are not allowed ( and there's a general consensus on this), but engineering consumable are...
---
using a 1g health pot seems far more reasonable than an arcanite bomb / yeti / dragon... or heck, if I was a warrior i'd keep many stack of FAP on me at all time.
---
My entire life, I've been told that a haiku was a strict 5 7 5. What makes you say otherwise?
---
In vanilla it was first come first server and there was no penalty for queue dodging to make sure your premade got matched up with pugs.
---
We don't know at this point how they'll handle that in classic.
---
But what reason did they really have? Go to a server that is going to be Alli dominated? Take a chance at a bad population server?
---
Don't get yourself an STD
---
Yep thats how we play it as well.   It helps that our core is mostly 10+ years vets of our guild, but honestly we've had really good luck with those we've recruited since launch.
---
there are plenty of servers with instant queues that dont have your faction outnumbered like 5:1.
---
Also R14 is server specific so queues have a neutral impact on the ranking grind
---
If you were stronger than the horde in the area then it wouldn't actually matter would it.
---
ice block or blink gets rid of most of that
---
World record, classic wow - jerking off to mailbox ladies: 0h:0m:45s.
---
Where's my fucking trophy?
---
No we are talking about transmog which is not part of classic.
---
1-5 main abilities and then everything else is literally a shift+key, has been like that since I started playing the game. Sprint and evasion are on mouse buttons.
---
Anything to not let players dress up their own characters with their terrible kitschy taste.  Retail has too many anime protagonists, sluts, grim reaper wannabe edgelords, goofy jokemogs etc
---
I'd rather devs set barriers on how people can look that at least has some artistic cohesiveness than the "taste the rainbow" hodgepodge of cringey nonsense you see in retail.
---
Which raid frames addon is that?
---
Yeah seduce and fear are supposed to have diminishing returns, however fear doesn't seem to want to break on the first car no matter what happens so yeah it's weird

---
I got confused because on my server Molten Core Swim Team is an Alliance guild.
---
&gt;A 1% increase to anything really doesn't seem very impactful. 
---
Your not thinking about this correctly.
---
Let's say you have 20% crit then get Blackhand's Breadth, increasing your crit to 22%. It's a 2% increase in crit, but the number of attacks that are critical strikes will increase by 10%;  ((22/20)-1)\*100. A more extreme example is low level warriors who get those first talent points in Cruelty (5 points = +5% Crit). Low level warriors without much gear will likely have around the 5% base crit amount, so those 5 points in cruelty effectively *double* the frequency at which they will crit. That's a 100% increase in the quantity of critical strikes.
---
Let's consider hit. The base raid hit cap is 9% for yellow attacks / 2H / spells (correct me if I'm wrong on any of these). You will miss 9/100 attacks. Say you get +5% hit with gear. You're now missing 4/100 attacks. Going from 9 to 4 misses means you are *missing 55.6% fewer times*, which is huge.
---
You need to be thinking in terms of *effective percentage changes*, not just the raw base percentages.
---
Grab the 3 agi +1 to hit bow from DM.
---
Spotted
---
Seal Fate Daggers right now my bars look like this:
---
Base (Stealth)
---
1 - SS (Pickpocket)
---
2 - Backstab (Ambush)
---
3 - Evis (Cheap Shot)
---
4 - Kidney shot (Distract)
---
After that I use basically every other letter on the left side of the keyboard and shift modifiers for other skills, pots, mount, etc.
---
I feel you, took me about a week of doing this to not get it recommended anymore
---
I mean realistically, most guilds will use guild resources (be it cooldowns or discounted mats) to get their TF made for a fellow guild member
---
And most importantly, a rez!
---
Lot easier to find kills
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=13142

This is why you don't carea bout omokk's
---
As an Orc I am very jealous of Ironforge. Undercity and TB are the coolest horde towns but Org is so convenient location wise. TB/UC/IF have the best layouts I think.
---
I agree.
---
Also all warrior had to do to do any of those things is intimidating shout or piercing howl, those weren‚Äôt even used, of course if warrior is not using any skills he will lose...
---
Problem with loot council on more casual guilds is that it *looks* bad.  You use a loot council to min max gear progression not to make things "fair".
---
If you're a casual guild then you're getting all the downside with a slight upside.
---
This doens't quite apply.  Increasing the damage increases the effective damage/mana in the same way if its by a similar %.
---
But do they share them?
---
Is my first fear after seducing counting as the first fear in regards to diminishing returns or is it already at #2 since the target was seduced?
---
Your name is perfect for your reply as I imagine you like macros and sharing them as much as I do.
---
I'm not paying a monthly fee for an addon lol
---
If you're dpsing most of the time and basically a backup tank, it'd make sense.
---
That's basically what I'm doing for my off-tanks. You definitely need to clarify it up with your guild however, to make sure everyone is on the same page.
---
Is it limited to 1 character per account?
---
Roll a human lock. The 4 human starting zones have the best composite story in the game, peaking with duskwood.
---
I did 5 Jed/rend runs looking for the reed yesterday.  It dropped in 4 of them, and I came in second by 1 twice.
---
I think what they are referring to, is something that does not, and will not exist in Classic.
---
Some time After TBC went live, (i don't recall exactly when), blizzard made a change to quests.  If you were max level doing quests that still awarded exp, then that exp was converted to gold.  thus, you were getting more gold than the quest advertised.  
---
IIRC, that is.
---
someone correct me if I'm wrong.....
---
I got mine from Voone. No idea if Urok can drop it.
---
This is what happens when I get sleep paralysis
---
What do you think about adding dual spec? It probably won't happen but it is probably my most missed feature from TBC/Wrath
---
What do people need Rexxar for?
---
This guys stuff that bad lol? Never watched
---
Are there any quest guides/circuits/loops that focus specifically on group questing (e.g. without collection quests that become much harder with more people)?
---
Only around BWL. In MC, it‚Äôs often a mix. After though, it‚Äôs *almost* purely raids.
---
With edgemaster's/race and the heroic  strike bugfeature warriors only need 6% hit to be capped in raids.
---
Im leveling a druid just so i can farm for some gold.  Maybe not the best one for killing shit, but yay herbs.
---
Only thing i dislike about my female undead, emotes are pretty lazy. The dance is so bad!
---
That's not how it works. If you enroll as a tank, but have to DPS on some bosses due to encounter mechanics, you are still tank MS.
---
Haven't had anyone give me stuff, but I've done all of those to an extent.
---
Based on your criteria I have compiled a list of the items I see most fit and adequate as your level progresses, assuming by the time of the request your character is at least level 7:
---
**Below 10**
---
Chest:
---
[Red Linen Vest](https://classicdb.ch/?item=6239) \- Tailoring Item
---
Legs:
---
[Ancestral Woolies](https://classicdb.ch/?item=3291) \- BOE world drop, buy at AH
---
**10-20**
---
Chest: 
---
[Green Woolen Vest](https://classicdb.ch/?item=2582) \- Tailoring Item
---
[Aboriginal Loincloth of Intellect](https://classicdb.ch/?item=14119) \- +2 Int BOE world drop, buy at AH, can look for other enchantments
---
**20-30**
---
[Ritual Tunic of Shadow Wrath](https://classicdb.ch/?item=14133) \- +11 Shadow Spell Damage BOE world drop but it is a twink item so it can be expensive
---
[Sanguine Trousers](https://classicdb.ch/?item=14379) \- BOE world drop, buy at AH, not your best choice but gives a good sidehip view. 24+ item
---
**30-40**

[Dreamweave Vest](https://classicdb.ch/?item=10021) \- Tailoring Item
---
[Black Mageweave Leggings](https://classicdb.ch/?item=9999) \- Tailoring Item
---
Yeah. I'm a holy priest and my friend is fury and he just DW tanks 99% of it in plate.
---
It's really easy.
---
I'm really enjoying Earthfury. The auction house prices feel more swingy compared to Kirtonos, but I'm actually able to sell my herbs and fishing for a meaningful amount of money. Haven't had serious issues finding groups and I'm a more casual player at level 39.
---
By being cheaper than the AH. It literally works out for both of you...
---
well thats a private server databse, so take it with a grain of salt. in this case, its correct though.
---
Just fyi it's not him putting these clips up. He has a personal YT account called Zackrawrr
---
IF has better paths to high end dungeons. Quicker access to the other continent from a simple hop to wetlands, and a shorter route to BRM. Shorter to get to scholo/strat as well.
---
I ran this last night as a 55 priest, with the increased aggro radius that comes with being lower level. I can confirm that it's possible without blink, but it sure gets nerve-wracking.
---
I didn't actually think they were THAT rare to begin with (3-5% can 'feel' rare when you get a bad streak) just limited by how many you chances you get to see it due to the 1 week raid lockout **per char** \- I think we are just noticing it dropping much more because of so many more people pugging MC now and guilds running multiple/split runs this early.
---
Coincidentally enough, just did my first MC in a pug on Monday night before reset and they got the Garr Binding.
---
If you want to fly from splintertree post to the FP in felwood, your path is splintertree to orgrimmar to splintertree to felwood. What the fuck.
---
&gt; What do you mean ‚Äúmage water‚Äù
---
The class that has everything given to them, the class that is loved and blessed by blizzard. Mage just has too many things in his plate, being said that... FUCK MAGES.
---
Addon can't prevent you from moving around the world.
---
4
---
It wasn't in vanilla but ye ol' "reference client" means blizzard isn't fixing this bug.
---
It rocks, lmao.
---
no im just wondering how you'd change faction if they're tied to race
---
PRIEST! PRIEST! PRIEST!
---
Yes but it's harder. You can't go around the outside and just pull lasher's anymore, they added spot packs to block the traditional route. They've also added an elite to each pack, and made them immune to nature damage, so druids can't really do this farm anymore. With the added elites it should still be 2 man-able but you're not gonna pull 50g raw farm anymore.
---
It may be naive, but you yourself say that Thrash Blade proc increases your DPS by about 2.83%. So purely going by the assumption that it increases your autoattack DPS by 4%, and the fact that autoattacks make up about 50% of your DPS, the naive approach is only .83% (that's percentage points, obviously) off.
---
There  are chrome apps to block channels you don't want to see. I like his content though, using it for hazel and tradechat. 
---
Not saying they are objectively bad, Hazel seem sweet but just not into what she makes, tradechat gives me brain tumors with her voice.
---
Yay click bait!
---
I dont know, the same way they do on retail I guess.
---
I didn't say you couldn't either.
---
I didn't say or force anything in either direction, and I as a single person am not capable of stopping everyone from getting there.
---
 Recommend binding your main combo point generating ability to your mouse wheel. Scroll up and down as Sinister Strike. You can set your zoom function to ctrl + scroll.

This goes for all classes. Changed my world... of Warcraft

There's no "K" in Traffic either.

yeah dude you‚Äôre the problem
---
I heard &lt;Washed Up&gt; gave their first binding to a hunter last night in MC. Can anyone confirm?
---
Lol as someone that levelled 54-60 in dungeons you won't even be close to having all your pre bis. If you're really lucky you'll get half your gear done. I managed 5 pieces and 3 of which came from quest rewards lol.
---
Are not the majority of bot accounts really people other than the accounts owner? That is usually what happens. All those spam messages you get to go to gold selling websites are probably hacked accounts. Should you suspend someone for getting hacked?
---
Troll overall has by far the best rage generation, which is very important as a tank. For bosses especially you can pop Beserker getting quick threat allowing your DPS to nuke quicker.
---
Correct. So by all information we have it existed in vanilla in 1.12.
---
Almost bis is plenty to start raiding, the few stats difference between bis and almost bis is not always worth the effort, especially not for dps and healers
---
Almost everyone who 'came back for classic' on my friends list is now playing BFA. Sooooo...
---
Is the server actually active? I'm on bigglesworth atm and am considering moving servers and i really only care about doing PVE content.
---
Exp is converted to gold in classic
---
They still make you do those things while referring to you as the savior of the universe. "Thanks for stopping the Burning Legion, but something has spooked one of the Brutosaurs."
---
Rareeeeeeeeeely bruh
---
Believe me, i'm right. If it can give you an idea, at a point, i had 28 golds at level 40. (after leveling tailor and enchanter). One uldaman run later and 3/4 few quests laters, i'm back at 43 golds.
---
When any grey loot sell for 7/8 silver, some monsters dropping 3/4 of them at each time, and any grey weapon selling at more than one gold, it goes up ridiculously fast.
---
Not what he's asking, he thinks he can hold onto low level quests and hand them in at max level for more gold.
---
You mine/herb/fish and heal strath live for cash.
---
It'll change in price somewhere between -5000% and 5000%.
---
I do the same, makes me feel like a hero even if other aspects of life aren't going my way
---
Everyone sucks here. It's like two 8 year olds trading Lego blocks.
---
I had no problems up there questing myself. Was 20 in a day. Viva la Mexico.
---
If you are not on a full server stay arms and farm satyrs. If your server is full, this is a shit plan and you should go prot and farm dungeons
---
Wrong, that's not how layering works. Queue time is unaffected whether you have 50 or 2 layers.
---
Let's say your dps is 300
---
1% hit or critical is literally just 1% extra damage. To do that equivalent you'd need an extra 3 dps. How much stats does that equate to? Exactly.
---
Am I missing something? Wasn't this already implemented? I know Bigglesworth has had transfers available for a few weeks now, and those were the servers available then.
---
Curious why they aren't allowing any PvP to PvE transfers. We started with a group that absolutely HAD to be on PvP, then they immediately left the rest of the group in the dust and haven't done anything with us since.
---
Actually, you're probably on a mid/high realm. Once you start hitting high it purposefully shunts you with a smaller realm in your group for cross realm. It keeps the numbers pretty static across all the multiple instances of the areas as best they can.
---
I find it funny. Don't know why you recieved so much hate.
---
Thanks for sharing!
---
It depends how good your gold making was prior to DM to determine if it's "worth"
---
Suspended no, locked accounts yes. 
---
I've had an account lock after logging in from different IP's a couple times. Should you worry no, it took all of 30 seconds to clear it. I also logged in from 1 country one day, another the next, then another the next, then changed states a few days later and only had my account locked once if I remember. If you have an authenticator on your account it probably won't happen.
---
no above 305 it just reduces the glancing blow penalty
---
its 35% at 300 and 5% 308+
---
I play on Earthfury and the only time I have trouble finding groups is during the work day. It‚Äôs a great server and I am very happy here.
---
Very likely with 99% of accounts they will just use it as a bot to spam "go to goldsellingwebsite" whispers and channel invites to everyone.
---
I‚Äôll never understand people who roll on PvP servers then whine about being killed. Wtf is this shit even. Gtfo your post is insulting to people who have experienced actual abuse
---
If only they had a way in game for you to stop seeing communication from certain people.
---
well, i don't have any issue for killing things... but i'm a night elf, so it help a lot.
---
Shield, starting with holy fire+shadow word : pain, then starshard, starshard again, wand, done. Take like 15/20 second at worst for any monster, no need to drink or eat at anytime.
---
We dont speak german bro, please translate...
---
Doesn't do anything.
---
About 48-52 towards Horde. Alliance guilds are better, so it balances it out quite well.
---
Awesome guide man! Not sure how much of this I will implement, probs won't do the 5 minutes in the morning till I find a few items I want to buy and corner the market on. I got Auctioneer and just from bidding on 30m auctions and buying out vendor items I went from 3G to 15G in one day. It felt awesome so hopefully the utility of Auctioneer helps me more in finding those markets. I know swiftthistle is a killer seller on my server, it is solid for 30-60S a piece. Making gold from just farming Briarthrons. What tools would you suggest using in Auctioneer to find the best item markets to corner?
---
What macros do you use? I‚Äôm a few levels behind you and I want to start moving toward some.
---
I'm not a warrior and don't know for sure but I'm willing to guess at those 2 in case no one else comes along. 
---
The 1st could be a crit cap issue. You can't remove the chance for a glancing blow on a mob/boss 3 levels above even if you have enough weapon skill to bring a glancing blow's damage up to a normal white hit. If a hit rolls to be a glance it cannot be a crit, so the max crit chance is not 100% as you might expect. In addition to glancing you have to account for dodge and parry/block (if in front of the mob). What it boils down to is something like a cap at 60% crit.
---
For slam, reducing the cast time once it is already less than the swing timer on your 2h weapon doesn't help I suspect. It will give you a bigger window so you don't clip your swing timer, but over all I bet you don't feel the missing .1 sec.
---
Hopefully a fury or melee expert comes along and gives more info.
---
I'm a level 53 Rogue. Almost 54.
---
My guild is about to stand up its 6th raid team. I want to be a part of it as i worry there won't be any more teams after this one (our GM was already hesitant to stand up any after team #5).
---
I don't know precisely when team 6 will begin. **What is the most efficient manner of leveling to rush those last 6-7 levels?** Ideally i want to be 60 before team 6 starts raiding.
---
Good point. Gotta love snare and poly immune!
---
No chance they'll allow people to level in a PVE server and switch to a PVP one lol
---
And Blizzard has surely seen the videos. Asmon has blizzard employees who follow him. They know. They just don't care or it isn't against ToS
---
Protip right here.
---
i did DM east yesterday and didn't see any books on the ground--where should i look?
---
I feel it's pretty even. I just don't want people to leave our server and have it drop drastically in player base
---
Is there a crit cap for hunters? Using extended character stats add on. Was at 16.5 percent crit. Added gear with 1 percent and it only shows me at 16.99 percent crit.
---
&gt; but it sure gets nerve-wracking.
---
*profouse sweating*
---
Eqrtfgxcvzs are the most used abilities for me because I can reach them easily since I move with wad, a and d are strafe ofc. After that I use those with shift in the bar above and in the third bar above I use the numbers 12345 plus shift 12345 for abilities with long cds like sprint and dodge, as I find the numbers to be more difficult to use. Also I use the mouse wheel up/down/middle click for abilities like silence where you need to be fast. (the camera movement is ctrl + wheel). For my lock, because I need extra keybinds i use the alt modifier for pet abilities like alt + e for sacrifice and the wheel up is used for pet attack and wheel down for pet follow wheel middle click for stay etc.
---
Find this a lot more impressive
---
Could switch to Fury Prot 0/31/20 if you haven't. If you want to tank and get tanking gear it sounds like you either need to work a deal out with your tanks/guild to let you sub in for more bosses.
---
Honestly it seems naive that they're willing to throw everything to two people. If you're not happy find another guild in need of tanking.
---
Again, highly depends on the guild; but if you literally never are given the option to tank because the guild always runs with two tanks at higher priority, then you are actively asking for him to get disenfranchised.
---
My understanding isn't that he's "DPS on some bosses", but rather "DPS on every raid because there are already two tanks above you".
---
Anytime we get a guild group for dragons we take the theramore boat. Tradition
---
That is the first I've heard of that. Do you have a source on it?
---
Yeah but sometimes there are not enough listings and you have to spam in town. Larval Acid on a small server is a good example, goes for around 8g each but since there's only a couple up at a time, someone would be willing to pay some 10g each if they just have the 8 they need all at once and save them an hour of spamming or checking AH.
---
PoE isn't totally unique in the way this happens. It's not just the lack of good trading system, it's also the fact that everything is so granular in that game. Someone crafting with fossils needs a shit loads, but only people who delve a lot actually have more than one or two to sell. If PoE did have an auction house that still had fees or limitations, it could still see people marking up bulk. It's a combination of buyers needing a lot or certain items at once, a lack of items on the market, and people valuing their time more than whatever that markup is. Worth mentioning that valuing time isn't simply in the time it literally takes to conduct a transaction, but also any time you spend waiting for more things to be listed on the auction house.
---
Obviously something like Silk Cloth won't have a mark up for bulk, just like trading in Chaos Orbs won't, but something rarer like Larval Acid or Arcanite Bars can in the same way Fossils do.
---
Here I am on Mankrik without a mount and no one to save me.  Reddit made me think there was a good samaritan just around every corner on the road in STV.  :(

This is fake news bears can‚Äôt talk

&gt;k kiddo
---
I find it odd that you typed that from your mother's basement
---
If I could delete your comment I would
---
I'm in the same boat but level 52 about halfway to 53. I finished Felwood and most of Ungoro, too low to do Winterspring/Plaguelands. This is the first time I've felt severely underleveled for the zones I've completed, and I think it has to do with skipping certain things because too many people were in the same area.
---
You don't do it to the other faction, you do it to your own because 1/100 times you'll get an angry whisper telling you not to steal their gold.
---
What about prioritizing queues for people on the low population faction on high population servers. This would continue to encourage movement for server population balance, while retaining the low population faction.
---
Maybe because it's my first post on reddit ever lol anyhow thank you too
---
Everyone has a different definition of griefing though.
---
At the start alliance had the same choice. Nothing was set in stone
---
That guy just wanted to sell it, so he set it lower for a quick flip. Always about supply and demand.
---
Fair point but sometimes you just wanna get closer without pulling it if you need to bandage or what not
---
Farm HoJ.
---
Ok was just curious if there was any source or if it was just your personal experience
---
&gt; In that case one faction can have a ton of unused level 1s bringing its numbers up even if they actually usually have less players online than the opposing one.
---
This is so trivial to account for that is not even worth mentioning. Restrictions would be based on daily active user numbers, not the number of characters on each side. Even if it was based on toons, you'd leave out all level 1-10 characters to account for day 1 tourists and bank alts...
---
I'm not very fond of this type of editing. Make it clean and in uncut sequences without the angsty scream-o. I stopped watching about 10 seconds in, since everything took the attention away from any potential showcase in skill.
---
literally all of it was used mate. That's one of the best warriors out there. It's like you watched for 5 seconds didn't see warrior use abilities and then left.
---
No retailation because it's a 30min cd. No faps because it was potless duels.
---
That's too simple as you would have had to be at 99% to start.
---
I quest with my wife so things are for the most part relatively easy but when we get big pulls or something doesn't go right it's so fun the coordination and oh-shit buttons you have to pull out to not wipe.
---
Yeah that's pretty pathetic.
---
I just hate people who like don't think at all. Like hunters! Like dudes and dudetts.... stop taking my fucking rogue swords. I get it... you can use melee but your not fucking meleeing every fucking attack. And if you are delete your character &amp; make a warrior or rogue because you are clearly not playing hunter anyways. 
---
I don't really have much for like ranged obviously as rogue. There are BiS crossbow/bow whatever for rogues but obviously I am not going to roll on that over a freaken hunter. But.... starting to rethink this logic as getting fucked over consistently by huntards lately has made me despise the class lol
---
I do the gold thing all the time, if someone‚Äôs looking for their mount still I‚Äôll throw em like 5-10 gold
---
Top right of the vid there are 3 buttons. Click on that
---
Yeah I stopped trying on my mage and started selling all the enchanting components instead.
---
Kind of a related question, I am a lvl 53 priest and I plan to be a full time healer at 60. I‚Äôm shadow now for leveling but have been healing dungeons up to this point all the same.
---
My question: does it make sense to respec to Holy now in mid 50s and just farm BRD and other high level dungeons?
---
What is that range addon he is using, is it a WeakAura?
---
 &gt; I wish everyone was just on the same page and would commit to their server the first go around.
---
The problem with this is the server would still be massively imbalanced. Like I've said it was around 65% horde before any transfers were offered. That is not healthy.
---
It's ultimately blizzards fault for having no system to alleviate the problem. I wouldn't complain at all if balance was like 45-55, I completely expect that. Anything worse is a snowball of shit. 
---
At 65%+ horde, alliance are discouraged because it's more likely the problem gets worse and worse as time goes on.
---
Like I said I don't blame horde for not moving. It is just hypocritical to blame alliance for a problem that horde are responsible for.
---
wowpop.appspot.com
---
The data is super fucking inaccurate though because the add-on was broken and only recently got "fixed".
---
lmfao
---
Pug if you know you're not going to have another alternative that week.
---
Because, and this did happen to me, a garbage pug I was on only managed to kill the first boss = locked. And poof, that was it.
---
Level 12 is not too late to reroll lol. My level 51 Undead Warrior tho....üòì
---
No, I'm asking you if you're horde or Alli on incendius
---
Ganking people half your level? You really outplayed them
---
I swear to god I read this as "just playing the devilsaurs advocate here but"
---
Yes exactly.
---
Check herb prices on your server and go back and level that up.  Swiftthistle goes fairly well on mine, and once you get to things like goldthorn and blindweed its a gold mine.
---
I dont get the joke
---
Profession: cringe master
---
Well, the first route is split into regions and level ranges, so just by reading the headings you may get an idea. Otherwise there's maps that show the general level ranges of zones.
---
What I did when I started using a route midway was pick the zone one level below my current one in the route and start there, ignoring all the quests I had already done. After 2-3 levels all quests in the route were new to me and I could follow the route and all the quest chains approximately while still doing my own exploring, leveling professions, making trips here and there to do class quests and so on.
---
I mean; you can just add it up I guess? Ar least the numbers are visible is what I mean
---
How do you reset a Dire Maul Lasher farm? Do you need to use another party member and have them reset when you log out?
---
This route was just made to hit 10 asap. I saw that Paladin was the fastest class, so i praticed it for a bit to get the fastest time possible to 10. I normally always play horde, so no reason for me to route outside of level 10 as alliance.
---
Can confirm. I am a part of this
---
I figure /frown is basically a "Hey, that's racist!". I am a proud Tauren, I won't be /moo'd at by a non-mooer.
---
Thanks man! Think I'm leaning toward be super useful and make some money. Herbalism/Alchemy was my first thought, as well, so there's some validation there. Was also considering skinning/leatherworking as well.
---
I use shield, holy fire, plague, pain, and then wands. I agree you hardly have to drink with this, just takes forever to kill something compared to mages which can just aoe farm mobs for mats.
---
Is there any resist chance related talents you aren't taking?
---
Minimum resist chance should be 1%.
---
I'm not a fan of him, and I definitely do not like how he acts. But I gotta give credit where credit is due, the dude isn't an idiot. He knows that drama fuels his fanbase, and he seems to know how to cause that without ruining his reputation (well his reputation with his fans anyways)
---
I am also envious :(
---
I have an portable SSD with a copy of WoW on, I haven't tried it without already having battle net installed but I presume it's as easy as setting the installation path of battlenet to the hard drive and then downloading wow to it.
---
My current setup - I have battlenet installed on a laptop then plug the SSD in, on battlenet it says locate wow/already installed, just click on that, set it to the external SSD and away I go. (Also transfer accords the WTF folders so I keep my interface the same on both platforms)
---
Not sure a memory stick would be fast enough though? The download for classic wow is also tiny so not hard to download it everytime to be honest!
---
Engineering and alchemy, you get the best prof for pvp and you can make money without ever leaving a main city
---
Unrestricted faction transfers. Get ready boys, chances are your faction imbalance is going to get way worse.
---
A few guilds I've seen on my server &lt;sapped girls cant say no&gt; 
---
&lt;razorfen downsyndrome&gt;
---
Yes it is up to me, but I am not too familiar with the WoW raiding culture/etiquette so I wanted to get a feel for it by asking all of you. From what you've told me it seems that it should be fine for me to be able to roll for the position that I am filling in for while receiving the 3rd prio on tank gear (essentially the scraps that the tanks don't need). 
---
I will talk to my guild leader about it and we'll see how it goes.
---
/oom
---
They even added one just for balance druids
---
AR is dead, Earthfury has some potential though

### [Godot \~ The Fragrance of Dark Coffee](https://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/Godot_~_The_Fragrance_of_Dark_Coffee)
---
It‚Äôs communication, simple and easy with a single typed word. /wave is a lot easier to type than saying, ‚ÄúHello there, Human!‚Äù
---
But yeah, experienced RPers on RP servers would probably say something more like /e (to make a custom emote) ‚ÄúValasterian makes eye contact with the passing human before getting the measure of him, his equipment, and his level of threat. After a moment he shouts, ‚ÄúHail, friend. What‚Äôs your business?‚Äù He then rests his hand on the hilt of his sword, wary of possible danger.‚Äù
---
Because RP is just interactive storytelling, and reading a book where it says ‚ÄúValrendis greets you with a hearty hello!‚Äù just isn‚Äôt as interesting.
---
Christopher's revenge. Do you think he saw it coming or it just cut to black?
---
I didn't see the 65% number, I saw closer to 55-60%. I'd rather have it stay like that than what it's turned into but it's too late to go back so whatever. I don't expect a solution outside of just paid transfers to wherever you want to go.
---
Potion healing counts as a spell healing effect, so yes, it is capable of critting.

Not affected by anything else, IIRC

---
This is like watching a 30 year old brag about beating up every kid in the local middle school, why would someone even make this let alone post it?
---
Why would they be offering transfers off of Mankrik? 
---
I mean it seems Horde heavy but it‚Äôs PVE so I don‚Äôt really care. I haven‚Äôt had a queue since maybe day 2 or so.
---
This is beautiful, the editing is phenomenal and the footage is beyond legendary.
---
How many he has in stock is a totally reasonable question if you're trying to buy in bulk, vs if the guy has only 2x of whatever mats he needs. Bulk purchases can change the price drastically depending on the item.
---
The game hasn't been out for a while. You can definitely make another 60!
---
If you keep regretting it you may as well act on it now.
---
This is great advice
---
Enchanting/Engineering.
---
Enchanting because even if you don't want to be bothered with it you can DE anything and sell the mats. Zero effort. If you do choose to level it there are a lot of profitable enchants even at the mid-levels and outside raiding/rep grinds. Plus it's a nice perk to enchant your upgrades on the spot.
---
Engineering because it is hands-down the most powerful profession for PvE and PvP. It costs a lot to level and it's not really a moneymaker, but the explosives, trinkets, and toys make it a solid choice for any class. Oh and you can make repair bots, ammo, and scopes for your raid group I guess.
---
It's 2:1 in favor of horde but I enjoy it. BRM can be a little rough sometimes though.
---
Faction change was never a thing in vanilla, it came in wrath, the only feature that would be blizzlike vanilla would be server transfers.
---
Blizz has stated the same thing.
---
Record for longest fap ?
---
Loot council done improperly will cause issues. Even with DKP there are issues, people feel entitled to loot.
---
LC should consist of 3-5 council, and 1-2 random members each week. These members cannot put them selves up for loot, but are still eligible, they are there to be the voice of the members and potentially bring in info the council is overlooking. You place a rule on who an come in like minimum 3 raids before you can come in. 
---
Not everyone feels entitled, I love seeing the others get loot especially those struggling, if it makes them happy itll be a much better time, I just have no tolerance with whiney people wanting everything.
---
B A L D
---
Its not a secret anymore :) BRB while I make a T H I C C Female Tauren and dance naked in Org
---
just turned in a grey lvl 22 quest at lvl 29 and it gave me around 1k exp .. I also didnt know that this was a thing
---
And sometimes you just gotta fear as a last resort and pray that it doesn't cause more problems than it solves.
---
But hell having a group of competent people is like the best feeling next to having a group where nobody complains about a wipe or they even laugh it off.
---
Dude you shouldn't have a loot council.  Loot council is for hardcore guilds that know what they're doing not for guilds running pugs asking reddit which loot system to use.
---
Unrelated, but in a game called Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, your characters‚Äô dodge stats would work against you when you tried to heal them. I quit trying to heal my ninjas cuz they would just effing dodge it ( Õ°‡≤†  ñÃØ Õ°‡≤†)
---
Oh he was aware. He didn‚Äôt release his spirit. He knew the ghost of Christopher got his revenge.
---
I don't know where else to contact about this, but does this calculate DPS correctly for items like "of the frozen wrath"?
---
For example, if I swap to one of these items, it seems to calculate effective DPS on the gear sheet correctly, but not DPS on the FrontPage sheet (e.g. if I switch to magister's head piece from green lens of frozen wrath the DPS on the frontpage drops significantly, which doesn't make sense. all things are otherwise set correctly as far as I can tell [frostbolt, frost school, etc])
---
Thanks for your efforts. this is really helpful!
---
Damn, almost got excited.
---
Wanna transfer from Flamelash to Skullflame,  after finding out alot of my RL mates that returned to the game, play on that server.
---
Really wish they would allow the paid transfer option, would make the game alot more enjoyable.
---
Just gonna have to wait and see, hopefully one day.

He lives like an animal. Pictures of his room are disgusting. He must not notice the smell of all the stale, rotting food and drinks all over the desk. Wish I were kidding. I can only imagine how he smells if he lives in such filth.

Asmon is the wrong person to be envious of. Im envious of shroud, because he gets paid an assload to stream and he can be as quiet as he wants. Asmongold has to talk non-stop. If asmon stopped talking as much as he does than there would really be no appeal because hes not that good at wow.
---
Normally I would agree with the majority here and tell you to ignore people who are spamming recruitment macros in chat.  
---
However, this is unique time in the game. Many players are tied up in massive streamer guilds that function more like big LFG chats then a real guild. Meanwhile the traditional guilds are struggling to find players willing to put in the time and effort and patience to be part of a real raid team.  
---
I know for a fact that many of the guilds recruiting in chat are just regular guys looking to fill out a 40 man roster. Probably better off there than is OlympusIVIi
---
How is this a problem lol
---
Now that you point that out, maybe we're only seeing part of this story. Maybe the rogue ganked first, kept questing, and the mage came back full of noobie rage and figured that was his opportunity for revenge.
---
Wow. Did you remove and repost cause you got rightly criticised?
---
Ah, gotcha. Now I see it for videos on the side bar.
---
Anyone got one for a shared button for Retaliation and Shield Wall?
---
Can't get mine to work for some reason

Yes, is slow cause there's like a million channels with his videos

Please explain to me how you reach 50% base crit. Fully buffed it's hard to reach more than 30-35% crit chance right now.
---
He's bald(ing).
---
Haven‚Äôt been on yet. Will try when I get in. Thank you
---
I personally passed on it.... but I can see the logic on rolling for it. Although I always thought it had int on it? But googling it cuz I didn't know the item from memory it doesn't show intel? 
---
So... now idk wtf I was thinking lol. If it has int on it I just pass as it more druid/hunter. But if not I can see getting it as rogue. Idk.... If I saw druid roll on it I probably pass just because I am very continuous of others. You kinda sound like a huntard if you were playing hunter lol.... but obviously that head not bad for rogue so I can't really say that. 
---
LOST FUCKING DAL RENDS MH TO STUPID HUNTARD LAST NIGHT
---
Dead.... I hate the game sometimes haha. First time I see it drop in like 20 runs and a fucking shitty ass player hunter gets it.
---
not sure about the bear form tho
---
still no.  Today each layer is \~3k, 2-3 layers give 6-9k cap (not the actual cap of the servers, but the cap they enforce). When layering is removed, max cap will be 1 layer=3k.
---
P2 brings queues.
---
Lol downvote me all you want, people. It ain't that hard if you play right.
---
Old Sicilian thing.  Means you gonna sleep wit the dinos.
---
This has been the worst trade deal in the history of trade deals, maybe ever.
---
So you are a guild leader then? That makes your advice carry that much more weight. I feel much more comfortable about coming forward about this issue. You've lifted a weight off my chest. Any other advice or tips   that you could give me?  To restate again, my goals is to get as much tanking experience as possible, even if its just as a third. It seems that being main/2nd tank is a very difficult position to get ahold of and I understand that. Is there any way for me to work towards these positions in the future?
---
Nice!  I never got someone sharing one back.
---
I thought for sure this was meant to lead me on and look for the player tag until I realized I was the actual ‚Äúidiot‚Äù

Oh he was aware. He didn‚Äôt auto release. I even got to eat him before he took his walk back.

You can't get sued for playing them ... It's okay to admit.
---
You should be fine as Arms but may run into some issues in the 58+ dungeons. I stayed arms until 60, then went Prot, but I was not exclusively dungeon grinding.
---
But if you plan on dungeon grinding, why not just go Prot?
---
Hahahaha
---
Love the condescending tone from the guild leader. He's not even listening.
---
The places I mentioned above are constant respawns that should be easy enough. It‚Äôs not going to be like starting you are going to have to search around but you don‚Äôt have to leave that area. 
---
For 110-150 go to durnholde keep in hillsbrad then the places I mentioned. 
---
It will take time but it is easy if you go to each of those places
---
It was because I didn't have a flare
---
If you don't watch any Asmongold videos, the problem is solved
---
Yup same as, it's like fucking herpies. 
---
Also just out of curiosity... WHO THE FUCK ACTUALLY WATCHES THIS GUY REACT TO VIDEOS OF OTHER PEOPLE PLAYING THIS GAME, WHAT IS THIS STREAMCEPTION OR SOMETHING.
---
There is no in-game calendar in Classic, at least not on the default UI.
---
Raid lockouts will show under your Raid tab under Raid Info if you've completed the raid that week, but if you haven't done it yet that week you can't see when it resets.
---
There‚Äôs one on Pagle as well
---
This is so true 
---
I watch Tim the tat man and asmon still pops up
---
I'm about to complete the Mage's Wand quest. I'm set up for arcane/frost. Do I choose the Icefury or the Nether Force Wand?
---
I think people who bank twink gear are not gonna make as much as they think because the market already knows what's coming, so a lot of people sit on them and will flood the market come phase 3. Adding to that inflation makes them get more later on but also get less for that money...
---
So how do I become a moron that makes money off my videos?
---
Was three pulls in to ZF the other day and no one called me daddy. Had to leave that group and go back to the desert.
---
It will only get worse if you really feel this way.
---
What have you been doing with your money??
---
I set up a special emote bar with bartender add on, and just made macros for my favorites. 
---
Not exactly what you mean but it works.
---
If collection quests are harder with more people then you're doing something wrong.
---
Conversely this type of thing is one of the main reasons I rolled on an RPPvP server.
---
The issue you face is you are more than likely going to be asked to go resto if you raid. You might not be, some guilds don‚Äôt care as much, but it‚Äôs what happens most of the time
---
I played on westfall for a bit and 2 people on deprecate occasions gave me 1g before I was level 20. They said they had mains and know it‚Äôs tough to start with no money
---
Add-ons in retail are much more developed than classic add-ons though, as classic actually reverted the API as well. It's simply not possibly to do some of the things we do/did in vanilla.
---
This isn't very important though. I think we agree. I simply think it's because we've played it before, and gotten older. Same reason Christmas is t AS exciting anymore.
---
yeah, just stay fetal dude
---
Probably answered 50 different ways in the comments, but it should always be said. 
---
Communication is key
---
If you don't know the instance, let the group know, ask if someone does know the directions.   Have them mark a skull on what groups to pull, then you can pull. 
---
Barring that - pull up an instance guide on a second monitor.
---

---
Salty whores I mean horde
---
but even then the prices aren't standardized, it all has to do with when you scanned the AH, I have some STUPID AH prices for grey items in my database because some noob/scammer listed a grey "broken blade" or whatever for 5g at some point. 
---
Point is, even pricing mods aren't reliable enough that they should not just pot the price they want.
---
???
---
So far I¬¥ve been having a lot of luck in the Mirage Raceway server. It has a constant very high population during the time that I play, and at the same time I have zero waiting queue time. Maybe I just stroke gold and found the PVE server that I exactly needed
---
Mainspec only round robin?
---
You‚Äôre bad
---
I've yet to visit Orgrimmar. I really should though. I secretly regret rolling alliance since shaman is my favorite class.
---
I've seen the dreamgrove in legion, trust me, these guys are always bears.
---
Reminds me of Somethingawf.
---
So getting ganked in Arathi now translates to every FP/Quest hub/mob camp being camped by gankers now? You're exaggerating admit it
---
What if I dont want a specific price, what if I would like to hear a few offers for this sweet BOE epic im selling to see what I can get actually get for it ?
---
Lol he did
---
I've had a surprisingly easy time finding raid spots as a hunter. I think that most guilds have a bit of trouble finding 2-4 competant hunters with reasonable pre raid gear that actually want to raid. You just have to spend some time getting the gear and learning your rotation and playstyle.
---
And once you get into a raid as a hunter it's the dream. Hunters are a fun DPS class to play, have tons of ways to optimize your damage and min max, and are needed for utility within MC like tranq shots, kiting, and some pulls to keep things interesting and varied. To top it all off, your weapon is a 50% drop from MC and it will carry you all the way to kel'thuzad (the BWL crossbow is the only minor upgrade along the way and not super necessary), there are usually only 2-3 other hunters in the raid which makes gear competition twice as easy as most if not all other DPS classes, and the tier 1 gear that you easily acquire is good in PVP and PVE up until Naxx and doesnt really require any contested MC drops like rings to shine. Your pve spec is also pretty good in PvP and you can raid in a very good pvp spec if your guild isnt super tryhard. Looking around at the other classes right now I can't think of anyone that has it as good as the hunters do when it comes to raiding.
---
Escape?
---
Eh. As long as it's not a fucking oomkin rolling.
---
every server sinc 2006, and every pserver I played allways had a  &lt;sapped girls cant say no&gt;
---
I recently made a gnome warlock on grobbulus after not really enjoying horde side on thunderfury. I‚Äôm not even 20 yet and the sense of community is night and day. I‚Äôve had people give me help, sometimes randomly. Somebody gave me minor beastslaying for free to make my sicc new ember stone staff look extra glowy. 
---
I just love this server. Everyone is the best. This is why I wanted to play classic.

If I get on for more than 30mins I get a can you come tank whisper...why is there such a tank shortage
---
The *Cumtown* recipe for success!
---
dumb part is people pop all this stuff and now come in with DM buffs from tribute runs (which is fine don't get me wrong) but then like... pretend their increased damage makes them better. I get people want to measure dps but so many ways to fuck with it in MC and just other raids I don't think its 100% worth just looking at peoples damage placements.
---
Especially when it leads to people going into fights too early and pulling aggro or keep hitting the stupid fucking core hounds that are dead and accidentally pulling another group of mobs or some other dumb shit.  
---
I will admit I need to step it up in the rogue dps department. But one thing I am good at is following directions and not wiping raid groups. I would rather we kill the boss &amp; stay alive whole fight to keep dpsing than put us into a shitty spot because I "needed to get that dps up" and do a mechanic wrong.
---
Like for Golemagg our raid leader said melee leave to lose stacks when you have 5. So everytime when I get to 5 I leave range to drop stacks and range dps. Well.... some of our top dpsers had 7... which they lived and whatever but its like fuck man if the fight was harder or something gets fucked that can fuck your healers mana. So yea you look after fight and my dps lower than others.... but its because I fucking listen to the damn raid leader &amp; do the mechanics.... Kinda annoying lol. Which is why I don't really look at meters anymore until after fights and more just focus on doing mechanics correctly.
---
We git it so that every class has a officer and they build the "council" and decided for every item (like the 1h sword from onyxia for example) which class will get it next.(sth like rogue&gt;rogue&gt;warr&gt;rogue)
---
And the rogues then decide how they want to distribute it if it Drops.They can Roll or they can discuss someone Who will get it etc
---
There's one on Thalnos too
---
A lot of these comments haven‚Äôt been helpful because they are only addressing what to do in full guild runs. 
---
Let‚Äôs address the partial pug situation first:
---
Your best best is a MS&gt;OS +1 system, but with some modifications. What this typically means is once you get a piece of gear (usually not BOE‚Äôs), you are considered +1 and can‚Äôt roll again on loot until everyone else who wants the item is +1 as well.
---
Here is the problem with that: if you are 1 of 5 rogues, or 1 of 8 mages, and you get a piece of gear off Lucifron for example, you‚Äôre basically done on loot for the night. If it‚Äôs a PUG, they have no incentive to stay and will likely just leave after their first piece. Filling over and over again takes time and drags everything out.
---
We run that system with the stipulation that getting gear puts you at +1, killing the next boss removes that +1 and you are eligible for loot again after that boss. You could take it a step further and say that +1 goes away after a boss actually drops loot that they are eligible for, as sometimes the next boss doesn‚Äôt drop anything for them anyway and you could kinda game the system. 
---
We supply our own tanks, so we loot council that gear. Any role that has a PUG in that role operates under the +1 system. All non-tier boes, patterns, materials, and legendaries are typically reserved by the guild leading the run. 99% of the time PUGS expect and understand this.
---
Now, regarding your full time loot system:
---
You and other officers need to really educate yourself on loot and communicate with full transparency what that process look like if you want to run loot council. You don‚Äôt necessarily have to plan out every drop ahead of time, but communicate early and often and then stick to what you communicated. When in doubt, be selfless and pass on gear. This is not the time for you to reward yourself for being an officer, it‚Äôs time to invest in your guild and earn their trust.
---
If you can‚Äôt do that or you just have a guild that isn‚Äôt receptive to loot council, either implement a permanent roll system (like the MS&gt;OS +1), or DKP system. I recommend at minimum a partial loot council for tanks and big ticket items (bindings) regardless of what system you choose.
---
Hope this helps.
---
So theres only 3 of us in guild that can douse the runes in MC.  Because of that i'd like to make this as efficient as possible.
---
Current plan is to hopefully have a warlock and a couple other low lvl alts to summon us to Azshara, then have the locks in raid summon us back to MC....three times each....
---
Can we actually do it in advance, or is it true that the runes only stay doused for a couple hours?
---
Icefury. 
---
Arcane Missiles isn‚Äôt a great spell. Arcane explosion doesn‚Äôt get much benefit from spell power. 
---
Frost bolt is a great spell and gets a huge bonus from spell power.
---
How is Noggenfogger on the list? I rarely have queues.
---
Bind stealth homie!!
---
I would say that it's free for you, when you buy something on auc for vendor price
---
Yea dude, some people are just shitty. But they cannot flourish in WoW, nobody wants to play with such assholes except other assholes and playing with assholes just ain't no fun.
---
There is! It‚Äôs in interface options I believe
---
Edit: interface&gt;social&gt; auto block channel
---
If you're using rockbiter in pvp....lol
---
BRM is full of mind control
---
There is an option in social I believe that says block all chat invites. Fixed this spam for me.
---
*‚ÄùAnd the other half?‚Äù ~ James Bond*
---
As a fellow mage ill have to agree. We are fucking morons!
---
That's untrue. I believe heartseeker is an alliance heavy PvP realm that was a destination for free transfers off skeram. Horde could have transfered there and helped balance two realms.
---
Have you considered taking even a brief look in the options of the game before asking reddit?
---
I farmed BRD from 54 to 58. You can get a lot of good gear in there, including a couple pieces that are bis until phase 5
---
Telling the story about how Blizzard gave up Freedom for cash from China, and to unsubscribe?
---
&gt;I expected WAY more warlocks in classic than there are, it's surprised me how few rolled the best PvP class considering how many are playing Classic for PvP (and to boot, considering how many players rolled mage... the class which warlocks absolutely shit on).
---
Probably due to PVP not being a thing yet (as in no honor system, and no BG's). Everyone wanted to raid and to do the PVE content so they rolled the trendy OP classes for PVE. Once the BG's start people will roll or spec into the more PVP friendly classes/specs.
---
Hmm, are you primarily questing or doing instances?
---
My group was talking about how to deal with rolling on class books when this mage says. "You're even gonna roll on my mage water book." Then after I explain that it doesnt work like that and he insists "are you kidding me, it's a drop dude."
---
Cue 45 seconds later after he clearly googled it and leaves the party mid pull, go fuck yourself. His name was literally like watermage.
---
Stunting the Horde's growth. Truly the Lord's work.
---
Hey! Does anyone know how many phases devilsaur set will be BIS for fury warriors? It's not really that clear on the BIS lists and I would really like to know before I spend 90% of my gold on it. Btw I play a nelf, so hit is very important.
---
You respec at 30.

Its a parody from a movie. Don't recall which one though...

---
I kited a ?? druid from the middle of Duskwood into STV last night.  He finally got me because I took some fall damage from the SHORTEST DROP EVER and came out of stealth right after I vanished.  He was so bad I was able to use sprint twice (3.5 min CD) while he was trying to kill me.

Got requests from a guy for 6 hours straight. I send a message to him, report and move on. After 6 hours you think they would catch it. There is an option to block them in the interface section. Chat channel invites i believe.
---
A human fury warrior that picks up Deathbringer is pretty much doomed to need Edgemaster's, aren't they?
---
These devs think of everything.
---
Instants use weapon damage, which is fixed and higher for slower weapons (given same DPS.)  
---
14 AP gives 1 DPS, which is 4 damage on a 4.0 speed weapon and 2 damage on a 2.0 speed weapon. This used to carry over to instant attacks like sinister strike, but now instead 14 AP will give 3.3 damage to your instant regardless of weapon speed.
---
Dude this is literally a picture of that happening lol
---
I want more BOOMCHICKENS. I love the weird dps coming into raid.
---
Well that makes sense. I've never really been a gamer other than wow and haven't played retail since WOTLK, so I'm not really familiar with twitch/streamer culture.
---
Leveling tailoring is what paid my mount tho, made a ton of money with it :o
---
Enchanting on the other end... sounds very expensive
---
It's really not bad at all if it's your alt. Just buy a good weapon every now and then.
---
Try to find any spell or attack power bonus that will increase your actual damage by more than 1%, its always much less that that. 1% increase in dps for a single line of stat on one item is very good.
---
Yes, but a small handful of those level 60s are alts from current raiders. So some people will be on multiple raid teams across 2 characters. I'm in what is probably the largest Horde guild on Faerlina, which very well might be the most populated server. 
---
&gt;Any chance some of them will run you through dungeons? BRD until 55 and then LBRS until 58ish?
---
Possibly, although most of them are currently focusing on spammimg DM. I think i can get some people together, though. Essentially you're saying spamming dungeons is the best xp/hour, right?
---
It should even out at about 350.
---
Un'goro has people immediately checking view distance settings.

I set the world record for walking around my coffee table this morning.  Nobody in the world has walked around my coffee table faster than I have.

you can absolutely single target level and quest as fire. it‚Äôs a different playstyle and you‚Äôre more susceptible to dying if you pull too many mobs, but it‚Äôs still possible to level as fire if you so wish.
---
Thank you. I usually shift-click to track quests I'm working on, but I've never paid attention to whether a currently tracking quest was one I shift-clicked or if it started on its own.

its not in the game atm

This was before free transfers. I'm sure it's not dead accurate, but if you want to pretend the sever was balanced before free transfers, go ahead, it's not realistic though.

Nah, 22G for a Purple while leveling is a great thing for him to show off.
---
No-one here does. I got fucking downvoted for explaining how to turn off the new questie DBM thing because I said "i just looked in the settings and it was there"
---
Rolled Horde on a new server, at 33 with 130g.  I just went to wetlands and farmed whelps for a few levels. found tiny crimson whelp amd a few boe twink items.  Boom, money.
---
Not leader, but MTing for my guild and in charge of loot along with a couple others. We don't really have loot prio as far as tanking gear goes; we prefer to gear our regular and undergeared players first, because as it stands, I don't need anything but threat to properly main tank MC.
---
Getting tanking experience as a third tank is sketchy, because as of now, very few fights require more than 2 tanks. Maybe Garr and Golemagg if your tanks are undergeared, but everything else can be very easily done with 2.
---
I don't know how your guild works, but getting a promotion over another tank is exceptional, so I wouldn't bet too much on that.
---
1. Ss 
---
2. Backstab 
---
3. Gouge
---
4. Evis 
---
5. Stealth 
---
And lots more
---
As a mage I just stay a few yards behind the tank, wherever they're headed. :-)
---
But I've been in pug groups &amp; dungeons where the tank really knew their stuff, some where the healer knew the way, a couple where the dps had the 'mental map', even a few where no one had a clue and we just explored together.
---
The key thing was we stuck together, and we stuck to our roles.
---
To be honest, I quite prefer the explore mode. 
---
I know it's a 15yr old game, and the optimal pathing has been calculated to death, but I'm on an RP-PVP server, so try and get a little light rp banter going, which is hard to do when you're chain pulling. As long as someone in your group isn't speed-running world first (Spoiler - that was weeks ago), you should be fine, if they're an idiot, kick them, everyone wants a tank.
---
The struggle is real.
---
In an office setting, picking out the PC gamers can be easy - just look at how they keep their hands on their keyboard/mouse.  Doesn't mean that WoW is necessarily their poison, but still leaves some wiggle room to initiate conversation.
---
No, to all of this.
---
Good advice, as literally everyone not playing wow (6.999 billion people) will also say they don't.
---
You're a gentleman and a scholar
---
I hated jerks like you back in Vanilla!
---
(Just kidding, keep healing me so I can keep tapping! &lt;3 )
---
Eh grenades didn‚Äôt deserve them anyway. The reasoning they had vs the roll was far too good of an argument.
---
For a mage it's not worth it, I think there's a viable arguement that a warrior could quest and outpace farming if they don't have professions. But... Quests end at some point.
---
He's not good at the game, that's how. He has been funded/carried by his stream watchers for years.

Just FYI no leash on Shandris Feathermoon ! GO GO GO !
---
The issue with tauren extra health is that if you're getting that low you're healers are fing up and thats an issue. Troll beats both orc and tauren. Overall it doesn't matter unless you're pushing top tier raid content and every 1% matters.

It's ElvUI debuff and aura bars. You can add custom filters to show specific types of debuffs or just your own.

I envied this kind of lifestyle until there was an AMA on the dota subreddit from a popular youtuber/streamer who basically said being forced to live an exaggerated, over stereotyped version of himself left him feeling soulless and hating his work and the games he had loved. Guy ended up deleting his entire youtube channel and stream because of it, and gave up the steady income to go back to school or something.
---
Then why would he repost it if he got criticized?
---
I made a female character back in EverQuest and got a lot of creepy emotes and tells, and once even rape threats. I've never seen anything even close to that in wow, awkward flirting is as bad as it's ever got
---
Is that you, Flurry23?
---
I've seen this said a lot. But actually, the female undead dance is a real goth girl dance common in the 90s. If I remember correctly, it's called "floor sweeper" or something like that. Although I can't right now find the dance on YouTube -- YT thinks "goth girl dance" is industrial dance -- I've seen the goth dance, and it is perfect for undead females.
---
Edit: And now YouTube is feeding me all these damn goth/industrial dance videos in my suggested feed. I only searched for a reference! I don't actually want to watch the damn things!

---
Alliance are fucking weird
---
It's a PVP thing, and as you know how they (we) are - very elite. With that said, walking backwards is slower than strafing/going forward. You don't want to make it easier for your opponent to connect.
---
On another note, say a hunter got aggro and instead of slowing the mob and strafing away he slowly backpedals to try to get the required range to shoot. It looks stupid.
---
If a tank wants to backpedal to position the boss, fine.
---
If you want to do it, fine.
---
It is just not the optimal way of controlling your character.
---
At least if you wanna troll, be creative about it.
---
Clearly not what he was saying. Nobody is arguing that asmongold makes a fuck ton of money lol
---
Because it has been a long time since you had to travel to learn it in specific places. If I remember correct, it was Cata that trivialised the process of learning first aid? Please excuse me if I'm mistaken.

I figured it out. Put your pet on stay where you want them to run back to. Then send your pet in, get aggro, then click the passive button for your pet, and he'll run back to the stay spot.
---
Fun thing, last time I bought a Blizzad Card to cash in for game time, the cashier after handing me the card bids farewell with a "for the Allience" and a cute wink ... I was 100% (good) shocked that the pretty girl at the register not only played WOW but also said that outloud
---
It's secretly a slam, they hate tall people.
---
I never like to use 3rd party anything for something i can control and do myself, twitch app though, i make an exception.
---
Yep, not nearly as much but they still do. I turned in a random item drop in Barrens to Camp Taurajo last week and still got 150xp (at level 45)
---
no idea
---
I didnt do the thing he did with camping in the same id
---
I never checked if it despawns
---
It should drop another 30-40%.
---
'Fool me once..' - you're the fool at this point if you're expecting anything different from Asmon's guild. Being a raiding guild is secondary to being a streamer guild. He will do whatever gives his stream the most entertainment. Expect not to get loot, randomly kicked, demoted, whatever else. That's what you sign up for.
---
Wasn't there an addon to make the combat text 'pop out' like you saw back in the old pvp videos? If I google for these kind of addons I only get scrolling combat text ones that are not what I am looking for.
---
I mean the damage numbers that pop out and then float/fade off.
---
..was this on Thalnos? B/c there's a guild with the exact same name &lt;Molten Core Swim Team&gt; on there.
---
Make a murloq sound and see if they reply
---
You can't really do LC with a half pug my man.
---
You need 40 committed people for LC to work
---
My guild is a top parsing guild on my server (incendius) and we are  DKP
---
It's just MC, other than the maintank, the loot people get isn't going to drastically change the outcome of the run -- mc is already very easy.
---
Distribute loot evenly right now, make everyone happy, find your core 40.
---
When bwl comes, that's the time to start distributing based on performance.
---
Imo, until you get 40 of your own members, you do an MS&gt;OS roll **or** (and I wish I would see more of this in classic) a soft res style run
---
I miss soft res pugs from northdale so much, you go in knowing you have at minimum a decent shot to get the piece you want if it drops.
---
The forums for your server or server discord if you have one.
---
I haven't heard much complaint from Heartseeker at all. I remember a poster 2 weeks back inviting Horde to come fight the onslaught but nothing since then. There newest thread on the topic on the [realm subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/Heartseeker/) is over 2 weeks old and it's fairly positive from the Horde perspective with only one comment to absolutely stay away.
---
The Alliance who jumped didn't know what the server would end up being. They chose the evil they didn't know. Horde stayed on Skeram. I don't think most WoW players are stupid. People mostly made the right choice. Most players would be far happier on the dominant side if their server has a faction imbalance.

I don't get why you are criticizing Alliance for making the same choice as yourself. You could have gone to Heartseeker and been in the minority. 
---
I don't see the point in blaming *any* of the victims. Blizzard didn't care that so many more PvPers would want to roll Horde enough to think about how to encourage better world pvp fights. Phase 2 is going to be a nightmare. I expect them to add BGs by the 2nd week. At least in the dominant faction they can just ignore all the packs of their more hardcore brethren camping the FPs and go slay dragons.
---
People using questie without reading any of the quest text haha
---
Instead of lazily ignoring them, why don't you attempt to make a difference and report them for cheating &gt; gold selling (in the description) ?
---
Retail kids downvoting because they call thistle tea a rogue potion :(
---
Booty Bay has dickheads.
---
Yeah, I think its more beneficial to just get to 60 ASAP. Get 60, get your epic mount and then start thinking about pre bis. Pre bis isn't even that important. You want to confirm your role in a guild as most guilds are just looking for bodies to get into MC.
---
This was like two weeks ago when in the low 40s. You can go ahead and roll another warrior and test it for yourself. Good day sir.
---
Why does youtube love asmongold so much, fuck that.
---
Make sure you downloaded the correct version for whichever edition of WoW you're playing, and put it into the correct add-on file as well.  I accidentally downloaded a Retail version of something and dropped it in my Classic add-on folder -- ended up frustrated/confused same as you are right now haha
---
Still over 1300 on my server
---
strange, I thought 2H arms was superior in every which way. This is getting stranger by the second
---
Well mages aoe grinding are not the norm compared to any other class. Don‚Äôt compare to that, no one can match it if done properly.
---
Priests are middle of the road for speed. What we lack in kill time is made up for in never having to stop to recover.
---
There‚Äôs a weekly looking for players post that includes guilds and they‚Äôll post their server time raid schedule. Also trade or /lookingforgroup often people spamming guilds

Darkshore: "How do I get to SW? Plz I'm new."

Followed by like 5 different ppl trying to give directions at once. Sometimes not very accurate or optimal pathing though.

so u remember everything u done and maybe didnt even do it, in a game 15 years ago? Dude u are just a hater.
---
Agree!

I have a few questions about Shamans and gearing. Last night we were raiding MC and had 3 shamans. I was resto and we had an ele and an enhancement. It was MS&gt;OS rolling for loot rules. Earthfury hands, shoulders and belt dropped as well as manastorm leggings (+14MP5 cloth). The raid allowed the Enhanc to roll on all the earthfury, and the elemental shaman rolled on all 3 pieces+legs. I was resto and won shoulders thankfully but after looking into the other shaman's specs I don't think they should have been allowed to roll on any of them because I would consider them OS. The only exception is the earth fury gloves for the ele because it has +dmg. I realize that elemental shamans need MP5 but still think that it's an OS roll for the pants at that point since there is no damage and several other options that are just better... 
---
What are your thoughts on this? Since there's only 1 set for T1 is it considered OS for Ele/Enh? First time playing Shaman and would like some perspective if anyone can help! Thanks.
---
As long as he says no homo
---
I didn't, but it was worth mentioning. I don't think you can click it away, it's a debuff.
---
He was dotting up the poor sucker in front of me. He didn't see it coming, and truthfully, neither did I...
---
I'm harboring the idea of starting an orc warrior alt named Taurenshaman since release ^^
---
I'm looking for a shaman addon that will display a circle on my minimap at the point I dropped a totem showing the range.
---
Does one exist for classic? I just want to see the radius of my totems on my minimap so I know if a party member is out of range.
---
Alliance?
---
NANI?
---
Dwarf is easily the best Alliance race
---
Its very fun to play a hunter, love the whole idea that you gotta tame your own pet, tame different pets to upgrade its skills, reminds me of pokemon. I lvled my hunter all the way to 50 but decided to take a break to lvl up my rogue to lvl 45
---
I‚Äôm power leveling my tailoring and enchanting and all I do is chill in Goldshire giving wands, bags, and enchantments to lowbies
---
I agree with all these points made. End game dungeons as a tank has been miserable. You are expected to babysit DPS who couldn‚Äôt give 2 shits about mechanics. It‚Äôs a double standard of knowing the entire dungeon while the other people bask in ignorance and blame everyone but themselves. PuGs multiply this factor of misery by rolling on anything and everything depleting a class that has no farm ability of what little gold there is to gain. I usually lose gold on dungeon runs with consumable/repair cost, as well as gear since some people have the audacity to roll ‚Äúoff spec‚Äù tank gear when they are there as a DPS. It‚Äôs hard to justify joining an LFG group when you have a stable guild that at least attempts to have a modicum of decency.
---
&gt; Shadow Priests, Warlocks
---
Unless you're undead, in which case you win for free
---
did you take the screenshot? seems like you‚Äôre the asshole in this scenario.
---
&gt; but even then the prices aren't standardized, it all has to do with when you scanned the AH
---
not with TSM it doesn't.
---
A round of /golfclaps for notwaffle
---
What happened to Swifty? I knew that name for years before even hearing about Asmongold
---
A common mistake I see is enchanters de'ing everything instead of looking at the potential de value vs vendor value.  Lower level mats are cheap right now so often it's better to vendor the item and buy the mats instead of de'ing the item for the mats.  Plenty of different addons will help you figure out approx de value of an item based on AH price and potential de result.
---
Desolace has ''LF REXXAR'' ''WHERE IS REXXAR'' ''ANYONE SEEN REXXAR?''
---
This, I just want this shit out of my inventory and if you offer more than vendor price it's yours
---
Firemaw is one of first realms who pop goes to high / full. So its very popular realm.
---
I mean I pay the sub to play world of Warcraft: classic
---
**Not** World of Asmoncraft
---
The game is so enjoyable by itself I really don't get why so many people feel the need to be in asmon's server in his guild etc like playing the game oneself is probably more fun than trying to play it vicariously through asmongold lmao 
---
I'm glad I avoided streamer server even though all my friends rolled faerlina
---
They all quit by now anyway while im chillin with Azuresong Mageblade and T2 pants cuz I'm in a DKP guild for MC
---
Never would happen if it was a streamer guild or even an LC with a bunch of buddies
---
What's the class that is the most in-demand at the moment, and will be treated the best by everybody else? (other than tanking warriors)
---
Falling for this is 100% ur own fault at this point, unless ur like 5 years old.
---
its bad on both sides, im horde and its pve basically really boring. "incentives" wont change that.
---
Here's another one! (Also, seriously? Are you really invested in this enough that you need to leave 10+ comments on this thread?)
---
xD
---
It still increases attack speed in form
---
The good players use strafe and/or backpedal depending on the situation.  Once you get good enough you learn when its optimal to use one or the other.  That being said, removing backpedal as a key binding means you lose that option, and are playing handicapped.
---
bro when every second you spend is just living a persona and nobody ever sees the "non troll" you, that is **exactly** who you are.
---
Asmon sucks.
---
Vdead Cmines it's silent duuh
---
Druids can res :)
---
Yeah...
---
Me neither. I thought I was going to be outside. Anyway,hearth stone was available again.
---
You would have significant issues.
---
You're best off doing a 0/30/21 or 1/29/21 build, to be feral tank/dps/resto hybrid to be able to do every role, but you won't be able to do spellcasting DPS, just catform feral DPS.
---
Yeah, I have read about that being a thing. My guild is pretty laid back. I doubt they would ask me to do that. I also am a relatively new player. (Played vanilla back in the day. I actually had a character up to level 85 I think.) I've never been on a raid and I don't plan on going to one in the near future. For now I will just enjoy the grind and see what happens later.
---
I actually find killing princess way more annoying and honestly harder than King. With how princess works on classic vs Private, she is kinda a nightmare to fucking deal with. To be fair i didnt give her the 10 hours of practice i gave Dire Maul. But Princess fucking sucks. Her AOE requires constant pet micro managment, her fucking Thrash that seems to save itself so that one time you mess up she targets your pet and hits him 6 times in one swing. I dk, maybe if i went and practiced it more id be fine. But... i enjoy DM.
---
I wasn‚Äôt haven‚Äôt any issue with killing mobs 2-3 levels higher than me, took about 30 seconds per mob, and I was always at full hp/mana by the time I tagged the next mob.
---
Any routes you‚Äôd suggest for getting herb up?
---
Desolace: Has anyone seen Rexxar? Zone
---
Obviously.. that's why I am asking somebody who has did it's perspective.
---
Specifically somebody who has made a similar transition.
---
I wouldn't know.  I've never made it through the first two minutes of an Asmongold video before turning it off.
---
Yep
---
The sad thing is people join these groups. The only GDKP that makes sense to me in vanilla is if it stays within guild for like tank flasks and other items that benefit the raid. 
---
We would auction of ony bags and people would bid decently high. The people that raid logged didn't need big bags anyways.
---
I'm more curious how he manages to avoid all areas where you could learn about this information and then still knew this information. Sounds like he has a friend or friends who DO watch twitch or keep up with WoW news who then told him.
---
As much as Asmon can be a volatile subject, he‚Äôs leaps and bounds better than McConnell. A shame McConnell even exists because he plays off Asmon (often as a *very* shitty and *very* half-assed attempt as a foil). He like an annoying hype man.
---
Dm is deadmines, dme dmn and dmw are what dire maul is called cause it's not 2005 and people do separate wings now
---
Mage teleport's are a fabulous quality of life improvement. Makes jumping between continents for quests a breeze which is fantastic for leveling.
---
Any horde from Windseeker on here?
---
In classic SW doesn't have a harbor. The boat goes to Wetlands instead.
---
Does screech hold aggro against a multi?
---
There is not a single show I miss more than PurePwnage. "jeremy shouldnt you eat something? I got food in the game kyle."
---
Any idea how long that would be? Ish?
---
oily are vendor price on my server (Full/Queue)
---
Should be tagged horror, not humor.
---
Myzrael is solid, time zone pst, hasn't had queues since the first week. It is very active still for low and mid-level folks but I see a lot of 60s doing endgame dungeons and guilds recruiting for raiding if that is your goal. So far, douchebaggery has been minimal but your mileage may vary.
---
When I rerolled I picked up skinning/ herbalism and just bought the stuff I wanted as I organically levelled first aid.  I‚Äôm not swimming in money but heavy leather sells for good cash and it‚Äôs free realestate. 
---
Herbs IS also worth cash at least the 220+ ones.
---
So instead of leveling a profession I just get gold. 
---
Gold that I can convert to gear /bags or mount.
---
Battlegroups solve a few things.
---
- Lowbie queues: When you have 2 people in the 20-29 bracket wanting WSG, they could be waiting hours for a match on their server.  If you have 2 people on each of the 10 servers, you have a game.
---
- Unbalanced queues: Certain servers have fewer horde or alliance.  Queuing as the underdog faction is advantageous as you'll have plenty of alliance to match against.  It sucks for the bigger faction.  If you have 100 alliance and 70 horde, you have 30 players waiting for the next batch of horde to come along.  The worse the disparity, the longer each queue takes.  And this makes honor farming painful if not impossible when each queue for a match is 30 minutes+
---
- Less roflstomping: I don't think WoW has a matchmaking feature.  As in, rank 14s play against 14s and rank 1s play against rank 1s.  Or at least, it isn't very strict.  The bigger your audience, the spread of skill has a lower impact.  You won't see a rank 14 often as a rank 1 due to the sheer volume of lower players.  Whereas, on your own server, if one faction is able to utterly dominate everyone, like APES, any random BG you queue for has a high chance of facing those players.
---
- Faster games: Games like Alterac tend to be more personal than a match against 40 strangers.  There would be more focus on killing players than the objectives to settle scores.
---
- Lower occurrence of win trading.  Fairly easy to have a relation with the other faction on your own server.  With server only queues, you can win trade really easily.  When you have 10+ realms on each battlegroup, it's substantially harder to randomly message a premade and trade wins as you'll have little guarantee of being matched again that day.
---
We don't know what they will do for Classic.  However, battlegroups were live before TBC.
---
Pretty much
---
have you tried it?
---
Exactly, you still need to move your finger to the alt key and press it.  It literally only saves microseconds
---
Fear the power of the Cobus! 
---
My guild‚Äôs off-tank in vanilla was ‚ÄúStinkwallet‚Äù.
---
does it teleport you really fast when it crits?
---
Are you going to explain how streamers are a net negative, or are you just gonna make a statement, then continue on as if you proved it to be true?
---
Leatrix Plus includes wide quest log.  It's in the Interface menu.
---
Interesting, I've read up and down that it's bis (against bosses) for races without weaponskill bonuses but, as far as dual wielding goes, you're better off with devilsaur or other good gear because of a huge diminishing return effect after +5. Is that not the case?
---
I'm a fan of snow music and really enjoy zones like Dun Morogh and Winterspring. For me, the song perfectly fits the extremes of your journey - starting off wide-eyed and becoming a true 60.
---
/moon has good potential
---
Level 37 Arms warrior. What's better to level with...
---
**Ravager** or the **Bonebiter**.
---
I've been trying to use Sweeping Strike + Whirl Wind  (or Cleave). I think the Ravager Proc would be nice, but if it's like a 3% chance it's probably not worth it .
---
I have both, but just wondering if the Ravager proc gives leveling a little more edge?
---
Also what's the Proc chance on Ravager ?
---
That's not a fix, because it does not address the fact that you have more players playing horde on pvp, or more playing alliance on pve.
---
You wont force more than a handful of people to swap factions.
---
Also it's terrible for the purposes of guilds and friends.  Imagine being locked out of rolling with your friends?
---
Oh but they do, but obviously the most prominent guy who has a lot of money will get most of the hate. The reasons he's hated are mostly based on jealousy. "Oh he's taking free gold, I hope he gets cancer for ruining Classic". It's hilarious. I guarantee almost everyone would do all of that shit IF THEY COULD.
---
Also, you comparing what Chris Brown did to what Asmongold does is hilarious (rather comparing defending Chris versus defending Asmongold). Exaggeration never wins you an argument.
---
If your guild is well geared and killing things quickly you go oom less, also I can't speak to what consumes they are using.
---
To answer your questions, yes and yes.
---
&gt; Essentially you're saying spamming dungeons is the best xp/hour, right?
---
Yes. If you can get a party of guildmates to help you slam out a bunch back to back I think that's the fastest route to 60. You'll also pick up some raiding gear along the way.
---
&gt; Nothing with the legs, no body movement (except for a static wiggle), no changes in the dance
---
Yeah, that's pretty much goth girl dancing. I hear it's hard to move with a corset, 50 yards of black fabric, and 5 pounds of makeup.
---
How do I know anything about goth girl dancing? I used to be a goth gir... no. Back during Vanilla, I learned about that dance, and kind of became slightly fascinated by the whole goth culture (as a late 30s man looking in from the outside). My fascination lasted about 2 weeks, but I still remember what I learned.
---
Remember the blue post saying WoD was going to evolve over the months and be full of content?
---
I don't watch asmon, not my type of stream. But I've seen and heard mcconnell in the pvp montages or other youtube videos and it's like yeah that dude needs to go. I like your description of him though, it's pretty fitting.
---
The answers here are ridiculous... this is not complicated.
---
There is a hit cap in the game of 9% against lvl 63 mobs, bosses count as level 63 mobs. You need 9% hit chance to never miss against a boss - 16% with spells.
---
So the player who has 8% hit chance instead of 9% will see a potentially noteworthy dps loss if they miss an important attack.
---
On a side note, if your race gives you +5 to a weapon skill the cap is instead 6% due to various factors including the removal of a hidden modifier.
---
Where is this?
---
My troll character Finndetrollio needs a home
---
Just FYI, for those interested in transferring to Azuresong:
---
There is much more Alliance than Horde, I'd say 3 to 1 maybe 2.5 to 1.
---
On Horde side (Where i'm at, in game character name Steven), there's only a few guilds currently doing Molten Core farming right now.
---
If you transfer here as Horde independently, keep in mind you may not get into a guild that has Molten Core on farm right away and you may be interested in a guild either in the leveling/gearing process or is about to raid Molten Core. Horde side is a bit slower on the curve due to less "hardcore" people.
---
MS gear is whatever is BiS for them.
---
Healing pieces and mp5 clearly aren't.
---
Wetlands has low level Night Elves being eaten by Crocolisks.
---
Great server, close to, if not 50-50 Horde-Alliance. Always populated, one of the few remaining that are layered (high pop) + no que times. I recently made an alt to level with my RL buddies as he started late and we're lvl 26 rn and theres tons of people just started / making alts. It's been a blast, both within the skirmishes as we lvl and grouping with other like-minded players. Overall great server, would recommend 10/10. Hope to see you around!
---
They go too far.
---
Its a huge deal. What.
---
First of all edgemaster‚Äôs are insanely expensive and wep skill is the only stat they offer. So youre essentially paying 300 or whatever gold and also effectively losing an itemslot.
---
Either that or you have to get into raid content or use a crappy dagger that are again wasting an effective itemslot worth of stats. 
---
And put it this way, any item with 3% hit would be automatic BiS. Youre getting that without even needing the itemslot. 
---
Thats not a big deal?
---
Dire Maul is a LV 55-60 dungeon depending on the part, so you'll have to level a bit more. :)
---
Rank 6 is the highest you can learn from the trainers.

You could probably do stuff like BRD with non-geared 60s without issue, but you wouldn't generate enough threat against 60s in blues, because of both not having the talent to generate more threat, and all of your abilities being both weaker and costing more rage.
---
I played a druid from day 1 in Vanilla, raiding as far as AQ40. I played every spec, and Moonkin is by far the most limiting. It can be fun in PVP, but it's very one-note.
---
That could work too. I tend to think of druid tank as superior for Ony/MC/BWL because they don't have to sacrifice as much armor to get +fire resistance (because they start with leather. no need to downgrade form plate to leather, which is a massive jump), and because bear form allows for higher mitigation early in the first few raids. Both these benefits become less important as raids progress, but early on I think they allow druid to shine as OT
---
I think he means with the backstab crit talent being 30%.
---
Where all these Mailbox Dancers at? Not seen a single one in Org! :p
---
It isn't "per 4". Only one shadow priest period, and only if you have enough warlocks. Shadow weaving is a boss debuff, so one SPriest provides to the entire raid.
---
God that was always bugged. I have vivid memories of that bugging out in STV 13is years ago.
---
\\\*flashbacks to 40 fucking times on Lady Vashj because too many people were too fucking stupid to make the goddamn macro, even when it was announced in Vent, party chat, raid chat, guild chat, guild message of the day, plastered all over Thottbot and WoWhead, and displayed prominently in blogs and on webpages posted by every raiding guild site ever\*
---
Ive literally never seen a que on bigglesworth for the past month or longer, i dont understand why they're allowing moving off it
---
Yep, all good points.
---
I do hope they implement BGroups at the onset of battlegrounds, but I guess we will have to wait and see.
---
Cannibalize is a no mana heal to keep you up, it‚Äôs absolutely wonderful while soloing. 
---
Devouring plague is strong for solo play too. Dot your enemy up for damage and heal yourself. 
---
And dwarves May have fear ward but undead have will of the forsaken and oh baby is that strong! Again it‚Äôs better for solo play because you can cast it while you are feared. 
---
Overall undead have the stronger tools, but ultimately it‚Äôs up to what you feel is more captivating as a fantasy and is fun to play. That is more important than anything else and will keep you motivated.
---
Good info, mate!
---
I started out in vanilla, and I really loved dual spec when it came out.  Everyone did.  I heard literally no complaints when it was first announced.  I played a mage and loved having a frost spec for pvp and fire spec for raids
---
For some reason a guy in my friend group joined Fairbanks, West server, and we're central. Think I'm gonna persuade everyone to move with me from Fairbanks to Earthfury. A lot of the high pop servers have the option to move to Earthfury so I bet the population is about to increase a good amount on this server for both factions.

Rank 1 sw:pain to fish for blackout my dude

Thanks for the good feedback. It seems like a lot of replies got the idea that I am not aware of how a LootCouncil works or am not educated enough on classes/items to operate one. It is quite the opposite... I have led raids and used LootCouncil before all the way from WotLK to Legion. So I am no stranger to it. 
---
In Vanilla my guild was large and we used dkp and never had to PUG. So that was my main concern I wanted feedback on.
---
I‚Äôm was making an example, but that was probably a bad one to pick. I‚Äôm sure you see what I‚Äôm getting at though.
---
Dont leave Benediction. Its fairly balanced

"mind your own damn business idiot loser"
---
Wait, people can see when they‚Äôre ignored? Oh fuck.
---
Yeah he went over that. He said the persona was fine in the videos, because they werent persistent and doing it for a bit every week was fine. It was the streams that "forced him" as people came to the streams expecting the persona in the video, and were disappointed when he was just an average dude. Eventually he hammed it up alittle bit and it spiked his popularity so he just kept doing it. He said youtube wasnt ever going to give him the revenue he needed to do it full time so streaming became a necessity to both provide the cash flow and spread his brand. Eventually just realized he hated the games and hated pandering to what ended up being mostly kids and teenagers and said screw it. A big part of it was his accent, as he had a distinct icelandic one or something that he had to ham up to appease his viewers. Said it made him feel like a disgrace because he was basically living up to a racist stereotype of who he was.
---
"i'm an idiot that willingly goes into a pvp zone instead of staying safe in barrens till 25"
---
that's **your own** problem?
---
No one judged you. I made a joke reply to your lame reply. But whatever makes you feel better. 
---
Good job coming up with your own comment though.
---
Most people didn't have top of the line epics, they were running a mix of MC/BWL epics. Same thing happened in wrath, I wore t6/sunwell gear most of the way through Naxx25.
---
Yeah I do like these type of quests too, mindlessly farming mobs and not worrying about drop rate is good xp and you can also find BoE drops and other valuable loot sometimes. I was doing that quest in Hinterlands looking for the damn tool box and went into the cave with the slimes because my questie said it was in there (it wasn‚Äôt), killed a few slimes to look around and one of them dropped Cassandra‚Äôs Grace which sold for 150g on the AH.
---
I just ran DM E once and the mage in my group shared the quest with me and we both completed it. Just find someone who already has the quest!
---
Woah I'm 57 are you sure about this?
---
Going to try after work
---
Just gonna echo the rest: if you have to debate about a loot council being good for your guild, then it isn't. Loot council  is for guilds with very definitive plans and very experienced leadership that know exactly how everything will impact the. 
---
Just roll for things. If you  have a main tank that you know will never leave, then you can reserve key items for them, but otherwise just roll it.
---
Except virtually nobody knew about it in real vanilla while it has become widespread knowledge here. This inherently changes the game *more* than if they fix it. Blizzard has already shown a willingness to change "correct" things because they impact the game too much. But they leave stupid shit in like this and the absurdly large spell batching window. They are terribly inconsistent with their decisions on keeping/changing/fixing things. It's a joke.
---
The important thing is that you are playing a race you enjoy looking at. Don‚Äôt worry about min maxing racials if you hate the way your character looks then you won‚Äôt make it to 60

Wait a second... did you really just figure out that you do more damage by attacking from behind?  This has been **WELL KNOWN** since the game originally launched. 
---
Additionally (what you haven‚Äôt taken into account) is that when a boss parties an attack, their swing timer comes much more quickly. This ‚ÄúParry Haste‚Äù means your tank will take much more damage if DPS attacks from the front.
---
If you're only going to be farming dungeons, then it will be more beneficial to run it as a holy priest.
---
Only person I've ever seen change sinister strike from 2 to 1.

A smaller guild currently, but not really "new" considering most people have played since Vanilla. I guess it is new in the sense it is a brand new guild of Classic players, not a retail guild that rerolled to Classic.
---
If you have edgies axe is very strong, if not then swords beat it by a fair amount

I don't even watch the dude, and even then he defiles/pollutes my recommended list. Granted, it's not been as bad ever since I stopped watching Bellular's videos.
---
Intellect, shock isn't that great. Get blessing of kings. I put all the points into holy, get the 5% crit rate, and move onto kings.
---
I gave away my 10 slot bags when I upgraded. But other than like 2 times an alliance helped me, a horde, probably just because I was higher level, it is not the common experience.
---
People are inherently selfish
---
As someone who actually played in 2004-2008ish, no, stop lying. No one spammed trade chat with ‚ÄúLFG strat first orb res.‚Äù Not once.
---
Yeah some people think buying bulk = cheaper than AH. Really frustrating. 
---
Bulk price = less than the average price per unit you‚Äôd spend for the same amount of units on AH.
---
First off, all the '9 levels are always the most rough because you're missing out on the next rank of growl. Growl is the biggest threat generator for cats, so that's a pretty significant downside. Rank 6 is 320 threat vs. rank 7 415; so it's almost 1/3 more threat.
---
With cats with bite/claw, you need to set claw to manual and just use it to threat dump. If you aren't using growl right on CD, you're gonna be pulling threat. Also, I'm assuming you're still BM spec? Because if you aren't BM, then there's basically no point to BT as a leveling pet.
---
I'm a rogue and I got messaged asking to heal a dungeon. I was like "Uh, I'm a rogue." Night elf too, not a gnome. Maybe they thought I was a druid.

I appreciate your angle, but it was awfully presumptuous of the way in which I live my life.

Youtubes algorithm is just really dumb.

I watched a couple videos on how to unclog a drain ~6 months ago and I still get randomly recommenced plumbing videos.

You dont turn off claw, you turn off bite. That's just my experience though.

Yes you can but you have to do a run around,   you have to purchase this :  [https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/world-of-warcraft-game-time](https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/world-of-warcraft-game-time)

it will give you a code and then you input that code in your blizzard account as if you bought a time card at the store
---
Anecdotal af. My friends aren't playing retail. Lol
---
Server transfers were a thing (heavily gated by time and somewhat what you could take with you, but they were a thing). Faction transfers were not a thing and would IMO break classic in many ways.
---
And what do you do in the event that the interested party genuinely has no idea what the item is worth?

What clickbait lmao, all of those videos are made by his fans so it's their clickbait. Someone living like a man child makes you *HATE* them? Damn, sounds like you're a pretty hateful person who needs to start caring about more important things. 
---
As for the drama, people usually attack him (because it gets them attention/views as they're smaller streamers) and then he responds so if anything, they stir up the drama and he responds. Why ignore people who shit talk you?
---
Your whole comment is pretty stupid.
---
My son.
---
Oh my phone auto corrected me. Happy mistake üòù

Same... lol
---
If you weren't in the guild you wouldn't be tanking so wouldn't get a chance to roll cause you wouldn't be there. Darn.
---
Reading [this](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/wowclassic), I don't believe you have to buy BfA. You may need to provide a CC and sign up for a subscription for your first month though. See my other response for instructions on buying additional game time without a sub.
---
Been healing 5/10 man's fine, even did 7/10 MC as 0/30/21 HotW Druid. It's pretty fun. I'm gonna enjoy it while it lasts because I'll probably switch to either full feral or full resto for BWL, depending on what our guild needs.
---
"Obstained"
---
Spelling, like pvp, is obviously not your forte.
---
Sweeping stikes plus cleave or WW combo extremely well and can sometimes take them to 20% with just that first attack. 
---
The cleave hits both, which proc‚Äôs the sweeping strike twice. So they both take a double hit, then you WW and it does it a second time.

Daily Questions Megathread if you don't want to google

Looking for an addon
---
I have seen a few Screenshot of characters that had the stats displayed similar to retail with crit % , hit % and such. What addons allows me to see this ?
---
I think it‚Äôs fairly active. I‚Äôve been there since it opened and it was definitely slow for a while but it‚Äôs seems great now.
---
The runes stay doused.
---
I did this during my first pug, since we only had 2 dousers.  Summons at azshara island, summons in front of mc, and then summons inside MC to the rune.
---
Can't tell you how much I enjoy C2C Josh! The interview series with Mark Jacobs was PHENOMENAL by the way, it made me want to play Camelot Unchained and give it a real shot once it comes out.
---
Did I just figure this out? No, but I just quantified by how much of an increase you can expect.
---
It's one thing to tell someone "Attack from behind, you do more damage" then to tell someone, "When you are attacking from behind you will gain 20% increase in damage".
---
It also can put things into perspective for people who are comparing 1% DPS differences in items who are trying to maximize DPS. How much their actual gameplay may matter over negligible differences in items.
---
Similar to your claim that we all know, attacking from the front will increase damage output onto the tank. Wouldn't that be neat if someone quantified the damage %?
---
Yeah, my guild, which decided to try to kill rag with 25 people and a level 56 healer will be doing loot council, ill just run away.
---
Do I upvote because I can‚Äôt stand him or I ignore this post?
---
Lol the innocence in the comment "want me to call someone?". Actually hilarious.
---
Loot council works in one scenario: when your guild has a solid and stable raid core and substitutes who are raid minded and already understand who gets what priorities and why. Any attempt to make loot council fit in a different scenario will cause headaches.
---
A casual guild that has to pug to fill 40 slots should be doing a very simple and drama free type of loot distribution. Something like free rolls for main spec with maybe some kind of limit to how many drops you can get is straightforward enough that nothing can be confused as collusion or corruption.
---
Yahweh
---
The only problem with an ‚Äúeverybody gets loot‚Äù style of thing in pugs is that once people get loot they are much more likely to bail on the group once they win a roll
---
Why the fuck would you turn off bite? It does more damage per focus than claw, so it's already flat better, but it has a CD. Claw with no CD means it is always going to be dumping focus faster than you generate it, so you'll never cast growl on CD because your pet is constantly focus starved.
---
Claw should always be on manual if growl is on auto. Claw is just for focus dumping, that's it.
---
The world is a big place and I'm sure there are lots of people who agree with you, but personally the Mark Jacobs segment has been one of my absolute favorites in a very long time.
---
Bitch I don‚Äôt have a time machine!

I am jealous of shroud because of his skill, I am jealous of doc because he created this hilarious character, I am jealous of soda for streaming for so long and making that commitment and his passion for vanilla but Asmogold confuses the crap out of me, I don't get why he is so popular.
---
God I hate that. Stop advertising your stupid [Linen Cloth]. No one gives a shit if it's cheaper in trade chat. Just post it and leave. Same goes for all the blues and purples that get spammed day in and day out. It's so irritating.

Literally my only concern with a guild is how bad the general guild chat is, because if i just constantly see stupid topics or bad advice my resolve to not tell people theyre idiots erodes at exponential rates.

TL;DR : if youre elitist join elitist, if youre playing for fun join casual, if youre an asshole make pugs (like me, and have your own fun guild for rl friends)

Or *puts up Item X on AH for 300g buyout* (real value ~100) - relogs to other character:

I thought I was on a big nostalgia binge with classic wow. This really took me back so much, i watched like 4 episodes!
---
Extended Character Stats is one.
---
Maybe you should have posted this on blizzard forums then?
---
fuck off with this "versatility tax", it's actually more like "we gimp everything you have, but you can fill any role poorly". This bres, innervate, and offtanking capabilities can not compensate for lack of dps, defensive cooldowns and no reliable CC.
---
Blizzard may not classify it as such but many players consider it as abusing game mechanics in an unintended way. It's also pretty carebear for a guild on a PvP server.
---
I would prioritize the healer just due to the set bonuses. The gear itself doesn't make any sense for Enh, not sure about Ele.
---
Not a warrior expert by any means, but this is the (very general) reason many specs don't max out certain abilities in their trees. 
---
For a different example, it's not uncommon for a BM hunter to take 1/5 Improved Aspect of the Hawk. 1/5 in this talent gives you 1% chance when AotH is active to get 30% increased attack speed for 12s. Sounds awesome, right? Yeah, it is. But the second point gives you a 2% chance for (the same effect) to happen. Up to 5%, which is a pretty low number. The difference between 1% and 5% is, in this case, almost negligible. It's very RNG; you either get lucky or you don't. So you'll find people who see it and take all five points in it, and those who, you know, *don't*. Those who don't generally know why they're doing so.
---
Sure, this isn't the same as crit cap but it factors in that small window of RNG, where the small chance for a glancing blow is considered in the same way that a BM hunter might say, 'is it worth five whole points when I could use 4 of those in another talent?'
---
Are you alliance on heartseeker by chance?
---
If you are pugging even a single alot it should be /roll 1 piece per until all of x class get a piece. My guild currently does loot council, but in a way that we have spreadsheets created to keep track and make sure that loot distribution is very even with no bias. We also keep most of this information public for the guild to view(transparency). We have an officer meeting once every few weeks to update and adjust loot priority. Only a handful of items are specifically set to go to players that we believe are committed long term(sometimes officers, sometimes not). This is primarily rings from MC and one handed swords, as we have been very unlucky with those drops.
---
Yeah fuck washed up. I have only had terrible interactions with people from that guild
---
Well easy googable questions..
---
What i dont understand is how its ok to bitch over anything but 99% of posts that are funny end up being removed for being "low effort"

This rule is beyond retarded and now im a part of the problem, the crying reddit bitch complaining about everything. Might just leave this sub if theres no fun but only bitching and posts about the same shit that wasnt even interesting at the first time. (500x dont talk to my son, the quiver originals etc.)

How do you kite something so far? I thought mobs would always drop aggro after a certain distance and run back.

if they somehow resist the stun, you just wasted your bandage. i don't think this is a good idea.

Was in a random group killing an elite mob for a quest. Someone was like "I know where X is, follow me...."

Anyone else feel like faction imbalance is a serious issue that needs to be fixed before it gets out of hand? I‚Äôm currently on Skeram Alliance. Alliance is insanely outnumbered on Skeram. Free server transfers have made things significantly worse with entire guilds opting to move to other servers. I remember servers in retail having something like 95 - 5 splits on some servers, which is ridiculous. If something isn‚Äôt done soon, I‚Äôm afraid we‚Äôre heading in that direction. Faction imbalance ruins the classic experience on both sides. On one side, you‚Äôre being constantly killed and outnumbered while having a crappy server economy. On the other side, you won‚Äôt be able to find players to kill in the open world, thus eliminating any world PVP fun. It‚Äôs a major loss for both sides, and I‚Äôm really hoping something is done to fix it.
---
On what? Are you training everything as soon as it's available? Buying gear off the AH? Giving it away to random people?
---
Thank you for letting me know about this addon, I will download when I get home from work.
---
Best way to prevent queue dodging is to actually try to balance the server faction populations.
---
How does this affect you in any way
---
I used to do a reversal of that, place an item for 100g on the AH, relog to another character, "WTB \[item\] 150g, pm me". Fooled some of my market enemies like that.
---
Hmm I don't see a typo. Maybe I am a retard... dosent change the fact that assmongold is a complete nob
---
He looks like the poster child for outcomes of fetal alcohol syndrome.
---
personally, i don‚Äôt mind, while i agree that it is, in a sense, ‚Äúcheap‚Äù maybe in battlegrounds it‚Äôs not active(whenever they come). i don‚Äôt use it while i note the disadvantage. Like I said it seems cheap though
---
I understand but clearly OP is not a fan of warriors. Which is very much possible. In that case I think a Rogue is a good alternative. Since it is very different from a Mage. I don‚Äôt like Warriors that much myself. But that does not make them bad.
---
You're clearly so much more mature, kid.

---
There was a healer on Skeram yesterday afternoon who couldn't get a tank for an hour and ended up paying a higher level 2 gold to pull them through Deadmines. There doesn't seem to be much point in leveling Ally there at this point. 
---
If I were in an elite guild I would be looking for ways to help get as many of the toons in the 40s and 50s get to max level as possible before Phase 2. Because after that the only way to replace members will be to cannibalize other guilds.
---
Depends on whether you have quests in BRD(it's a great chance to work on the ony) and get some gear at the same time.
---
Yeah. As someone who has been on earthfury from the beginning, I‚Äôm interested to see all the new transfers. We‚Äôve had a pretty balance and fun server so far.
---
This is where the #nochanges argument gets interesting...
---
Because while the addon certainly didn't exist back in Vanilla, based on my understanding, it *could* have existed, as the game state right now is more or less identical to 1.12 (please correct me if I am wrong).
---
So the #nochanges move would appear to be letting it stay, but I completely understand why people want it killed.  I have no dog in this fight, playing on a PVE server, but I am interested to see how the #nochanges crowd approaches this.
---
Rather than have all 40 people /roll for an item the raid leader does /roll 1-40.
---
Then whatever number it is the raid leader gives to that person in the raid corresponding to raid frames.
---
This sounds sooo fucking fun! Maybe I can convince some of my friends to do it lol
---
One on rattlegore aswell
---
just imagine the type of person who wants to be a janitor for free
---
Depends on faction (especially if on a pvp server).  Unfortunately, you'll need to spend a little time in lower level zones in order to get from 85 to \~150.  Summarizing from [https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/herbalism-profession-classic-wow](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/herbalism-profession-classic-wow) :
---
If alliance, it looks like Darkshore --&gt; Ashenvale --&gt; Stonetalon would work (After which SoS would be available)
---
If horde, it looks like barrens --&gt; stonetalon would work.  
---
Also, during the time you can skill up off stranglekelp (should be orange for you right now b/c it requires 85 herbalism), there is a ton of it off almost all coasts, so casting levitate and running along the coast should help you skill up pretty quick.
---
\&gt;rogues with good daggers
---
Not really just that, a properly specced subtlety rogue that at least knows what they're doing should be able to kill a mage almost every time. They have enough escapes and resets that when combined with their insane burst damage at the start destroys relatively small health pools.
---
On top of that, people forget there's a difference between dueling viability and world pvp. A warrior should basically never be able to kill a mage. But in world pvp they can blow a mage up with a little luck. If you get ganked by a warrior who snuck up on you, all it takes is a lucky crit (which isn't exactly rare) with the charge -&gt; auto attack -&gt; mortal strike/bloodthirst to have a mage dead within that single swing time.
---
Not in classic. As long as you attack it every once in a while you can kite something until indefinitely. Or at least until it dies.
---
Love the downvotes for saying ret is bad. I'm a rogue in 90% blues and I have a parse above the #1 ret in every single fight this tier. They're useless. It's sad, but they are. Go holy already and contribute to your raid. 
---
#nochanges
---
&gt;How the fuck are you so broke?
---
He's buying everyone bags!
---
It's never too late to roll an alt on an rp server! :D
---
It did exist in vanilla, and all it does is parse the combat log like DPS and threat meters. Nothing to see here.
---
You are making stuff up. Have you done the mathematics for arms and fury while leveling to figure out that fury is 'mathematically better'? No you have not. On pservers fury was better pre 40 because you could proc Enrage and Bloodcraze by sitting in combat which is not possible in classic. That is why arms is better on classic.
---
Thats a shitty mechanic... Why would someone dodge a heal?
---
I hate being on a low populated server because I can no longer play how I want to play. Need fire resist pots for MC? Not enough on AH? Guess I have to go farm mats instead of leveling my alt or running that dungeon for gear. Better hope that 1 guildie with  the pattern learned is online to make em. Oh my guild decided to stop raiding? Well, shit. The only other guild that raids, I can't make their raid times. Do I start from scratch, or just quit?
---
You should definitely do it, it's gonna be a shitshow, but you should do it just for the memes.
---
Deleted your main comment eh?  Couldn't even be man enough to stand by your own shitty words.  What a champ.  I read through your history by the way.  Try some more positivity.

How is somebody showing up within your radar in the combat log?? It shows people flying over you on flight paths, nothing shows up in my combat log, yet they show up on Spy, despite me not being able to actually see them.
---
Also, Spy did not exist in vanilla, so you'd be wrong there.
---
Asking a related question in a reddit = people doing heavy lifting for you?  lol
---
Great community.
---
Raid leader rolls that and gives it to the raid member of the number rolled. 1-40 for 40 man raid.
---
I killed a mage that jumped next to me and started trying to grind the same limited mob as I was. When he didn‚Äôt iceblock out of dots and fear I felt horrible for bullying someone that new to the game
---
Myzrael, the tank population is not great and though I wish it were otherwise, I don't blame folks for not wanting to play their tank spec. 
---
It is a thankless job and no matter the class, not fun to level for the most part.
---
Back in the day, main tanks and healers were the first ones to burnout before anyone else. When they started off-speccing or wanting to bring alts people would give them shit, or they would feel guilty for wanting to play something less stressful after getting the main geared.
---
I try to be encouraging to tanks in pugs unless they are dicks. Not every pull has to be perfect and try not to punk them out of gear. It rarely works but gots to try.
---
Because those stats can have huge consequences, and because the goal is to stack a bunch of those stats, not just 1 piece.
---
If you're the tank, and you miss with a big ability, and the mob you're trying to aggro rips through half the raid?   You'll wish you had that improved hit.
---
And if you're a fire mage trying to keep that rolling ignite going, then crits are everything.
---
In other words, a character who never misses, and crits 10-15% more often is going to be a hell of a lot stronger than a character who just has slightly more stats in other areas.
---
Had a bunch of rugged because I took skinning while leveling, bought super cheap warbear leather off AH for 10g, found someone to make it, tipped 5g and this was at level 54ish. Still wearing it and probably will be for a long time.
---
Which is why i turned my upvote of this post into a downvote. not going to feed the troll, and even posting critical posts feeds a troll
---
If  my alt mage was level 60 and in your guild, I'd leave the guild and roll with you in the pug as well if that makes any difference.  It doesn't matter what class you are screwing over in your own guild, they would be better off with a random roll.
---
Post says Blizzard opened up free transfers, even though many servers desperately need to keep what population they have (of a specific faction).
---
He could still pull with starfire+moon fire for a nice aggro boost.
---
Haven't been on Reddit in a while and you made a terrible point so I wanted to respond too it.
---
 There's nothing commie about the fact that you have issues stringing together a cogent point. Prolly one of the most bizarre attempts at an attack I've seen in a while. Having a dent in your skull can lead to that I suppose.
---
Beautiful moir√© effect thanks for sharing
---
I prefer nugenergy addon though it ticks the same shows your energy and you can put it anywhere on the screen
---
you're not really making a good case for someone considering playing there
---
Wow. So imagine if Blizzard only lets half as many play at once.
---
You're welcome, it's absolutely crazy good. It has a KoS feature too, to make a pop-up + loud ring when a Kill-on-sight target is scanned, and it tracks your kill/death ratio against everyone you meet, and documents where you fought.
---
By the way, I'm not trying to keep the addon hidden, I think either everybody should have it or nobody should have it, but I'd prefer nobody.
---
Dude that‚Äôs very manipulative. Don‚Äôt fall for shit like that.

Why do you think using a dagger is wasting an item slot?

You also don't need to use edgemasters. You can use the helmet for axes or the belt for daggers.

Correct. With the honored rep 10% discount you need 90g.

I feel you on that, man. It was a really tough decision to xfer, my guild decided to up and do it in the span of like 2 hours. My retail server, Spinebreaker was also super horde dominated so I was mostly used to it, albeit to a lesser degree.
---
I really considered staying, even after most of my guild had transferred, but like I said above, I actually am glad I did.

I figure with consumables you should always greed. If something like that drops it's hard to distinguish who needs it and who it just trying to steal it. In a sense it's a greed roll because you are being greedy and not wanting to spend 40g in the AH, whereas with armour or a weapon you can see who needs what and it's stuff you generally can't buy
---
You realize you can focus on that after getting your mount? I guess it‚Äôs too late for what I‚Äôm saying to matter, but professions aren‚Äôt important until late game. Especially enchanting.
---
Kind of shitty they didn't just explain and ask you to reroll it if that's how the felt (unless I'm missing part of the story) but nah, I wouldn't say roll on expensive mats just because you claim to be making stuff with them. That's just me personally, I can see people being annoyed because it's not BOP.
---
I‚Äôm new to WoW with classic, so can I want to ask: my main is a 2h fury warrior. I thought I might try to get Sulthraze because it seems cool. But are you saying with what we know now, that‚Äôs not worth it?
---
cool to see an Azuresong post around here. 
---
If you want to know what the end raiding guilds for Alliance on the server are like then here you go. 
---
Dream Team - Doing Guild only runs (not sure past that, but I do know they are doing well last I heard) 
---
Light Bringers - doing colab runs. last I checked they need healers to start doing solo guild runs
---
Reconstructed - doing colab runs. starting solo guild runs now
---
Bladerunners - Utter shit show of a guild and Magee is a lunatic. They gkicked a bunch of the guild, and couldn't clear the first boss in MC after they tried to do a solo guild run. They were the "Lets make the biggest guild on the server and have all the bad players in one place" for leveling. very few werent bad. 
---
Fate - newly formed from the good players (and good people in general) from the people that left Bladerunners. 
---
Currently don't know or cant think of anyone else raiding at the moment.

Hunter. 
---
Most people who levelled them didnt do it with the intention to raid; a lot are farming alts for priest / paladin mains. 
---
While you enjoyed your mage in the dungeons where your utilities could be utilized, in raid you will be stuck spamming frostbolt and then spamming more frostbolt. AoE pack? Throw in a blizzard then its BACK TO FROSTBOLT. For hunter, because your dps is perceived as less-than (even though hunter is top dps until naxx, ssshhh) you will be tasked with weird off-tasks where you will get to utilize more of your classes potential. A good hunter can prove themselves in a raid and 39 other people will remember your name. 
---
You top dps on your mage and you'll just be the biggest blue bar in a sea of blue bars.

You're looking at this in WoW terms. EVE scams aren't tricking someone into selling you something for more than it's worth. EVE scams are spending 5 years being a noteable and reliable player or Corp doing business and offering services to the entire player base and then one day disappearing with trillions of dollars that isn't yours. An EVE scam is getting into an opposing Corp undercover and spending years gaining their trust and privileges before crushing them completely. That is the reality of EVE online. That is why the players play.
---
You aren't in the wrong since you needed the item and weren't gonna sell it.
---
Although to avoid drama because people who play this game are crazy dramatic, I would just let the group know why you're needing. Upgrade's an upgrade regardless of how much it sells on the AH.
---
lol the server is doing fine huntard... it has been High pop every night and even touches full at peak hours... now we are getting even more people? fuck off with the dumb "doom and gloom" comments about dead servers.
---
I usually only socialize with my guildmates who are all awesome, or my one IRL friend who plays with me. Even the Alliance people I've bumped into have been cool. Two night elves actually helped me complete a "protect the NPC" quest.

Not OP, but as Horde on Skeram: ONSLAUGHT is an ultra-toxic guild, and they run the Devilsaur game. I haven't had a ton of interaction with other guilds to see this as more widespread than that one, but so far I've had devilsaur leather ninja-skinned out from under me and Weldon Barov (who takes at least 30 minutes to spawn) ninja tagged. 
---
To elaborate on the Barov thing - we had 3 people waiting for roughly 30 minutes, uncontested, when an ONSLAUGHT guy rolls up, asks how many we had. I say we have 3, and we've been waiting 30 minutes. I try to invite him, but he has 3 as well. I say, "Are you going to try to ninja the tag?" and he replies, "u r gay." 
---
Weldon spawns, he gets the tag, then proceeds to fuck up kiting him because his mage buddies are incompetent, so Weldon resets. This time I get the tag, and the warrior spends the next couple minutes trying to taunt and bug the mob out.
---
This is a quote from their website:
---
&gt;Hyper focus on min/max performance and high tempo play.   
---
ONSLAUGHT transcends platitudes of ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù and ‚Äúelite‚Äù and is a tier above. 
---
I know it's silly to play warcraft and call someone else a nerd but... yikes.
---
I'm. Fury/prot so I haven't been able to stance dance without losing rage for ages :'( I gain rage faster tho so it's not a huge deal.
---
See my post above, I just pray I dont get grouped with pathetic people like you
---
But he sounds like he enjoys talking a lot, so I'm still envious of him. I'm envious of extroverts in general.
---
Yeah most guides say that seal fate builds arent as good as combat until you get very geared.
---
I dont think anyone on this subreddit says this or even close to this. Just because the odd acts of kindness gets posted on here doesn't mean your expected to get the same treatment especially when people act like twats.
---
I have had 2 negative experiences on Classic since launch and its because ingame im not a total dickhead and I actually try to help people whilst im either on my main or my alt because if your kind to people they are kind back to you its pretty simple.
---
Warlocks have relatively few cooldown-gated abilities so you could hide most of your abilities as long as they're keybound.
---
Also I forgot what it's called but do you have that one that changes the frame/gloss of action bars? Bartender without that looks pretty dopey.
---
Bleameaux isn't shit, it's just that I'm an EST player so all the week night raids start way too late for me, so I have to get it all in on the weekend.  Would like to play with people in my own timezone.

And yeah vigor is almost useless in pve.  That basically a pvp talent where you shut people down and let your energy bar fully refill, and helps with the  opener.

Your link is showing viewer hours, not hours streamed. And I‚Äôd be surprised if he‚Äôs only made 2 mill from streaming. Each subscriber is at least $2.50 in his pocket (probably more like $3). I‚Äôm not sure how many subscribers he has now, but I know it used to be at least 30k. That‚Äôs 30,000 x $3 every month. That‚Äôs not even including donations, which could easily reach $500 each time he streams. Big streamers are multi-millionaires. Pretty crazy

Did any of my suggestions work?

I transferred from Herod to Earthfury about 3 weeks ago. I play on Horde side. I am very happy with my guild‚Äôs decision to transfer. The pros and cons are below; 
---
1. The factions are balanced. The latest census showed 47% alliance and 53% horde. While the data is outdated, the balance of power is still even. About half the time alliance are out numbered outside BRM or DM. And half the time alliance has control. 
---
2. Balanced factions means better pvp. On Herod, I rarely had alliance attack me. And I rarely attacked alliance. Horde dominated most areas. Pvp was not fun. On Earthfury, I am often attacked and don‚Äôt feel bad when I attack. 
---
3. You get to know the community. Earthfury is a medium population server. This is a pro for me, but a con for some. It feels like my high pop vanilla server where people got to know each other. On Herod, everyone felt anonymous due to the crazy number of people. World pvp, questing, and grinding are all better.
---
4. Earthfury slows down dramatically late at night. It is not like Herod where LFG is active at 4 a.m. in the morning. Most people who transferred here likely did so as they play during prime hours when Herod (and other full servers) had queues. Groups can be found late at night or early in the morning, but it takes effort (and groups for sub-60 content is harder during these hours as well). 
---
5. Earthfury could suffer from a large exodus of players from Classic WoW. It has a great population today, but if people quit Classic in droves, that could change. 
---
The pros outweigh the cons for me. I can do quests and grind in the open world. The pvp is awesome. The sense of community is much stronger than in Herod. The biggest con for a Earthfury is that it slows down at night. But so did high pop vanilla servers. If you want a vanilla like experience, Earthfury is closer to it than mega servers like Herod. No layering. Lots of players, but not insane numbers. Open world content is viable as all zones aren‚Äôt super crowded. I personally love it. With that said, Earthfury is more vulnerable to exodus of players from Classic WoW than Herod. Herod could afford to lose 80% of its players and still be healthy. Earthfury cannot afford to lose even half. But if we speculate on what ifs, we could also worry about what will happen to Herod when layering ends. Things could get better or worse for both servers.

The transmute itself is useless. You can hold onto it for later when people have more disposable gold and will pay a bit to have this if it isn't flooding you AH for cheap. Or try to sell it now for 20-50g?

https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0tLx00VoZZxtcoxaV
---
I mean I watched this and it seemed like the right decision to me.
---
You had a fury warrior and a Dagger rogue who both wanted it.
---
Then you had a sword rogue who also rolled.
---
The sword rogue had never brought up ever intending to play daggers, didn't even have an offhand dagger and passed on the BIS dagger gloves.  If he was intending to play daggers he would have at the very least had an offhand dagger.
---
Then the fury warrior who rolled the 2nd highest agreed to pass it to the dagger rogue.
---
Also the loot master can basically do anything they want with the loot according to Blizzard.  It isn't ninja looting at all and if his guild members had a problem with it they would leave the guild.
---
Yah man a lot of subreddit/forum mods are on power trips.

I have a problem with stance dance, I have bound to the scroll wheel and when I spam the scroll wheel to change the stance my spell bar flickers between battle and defense stance, is there a way to fix this? I tried /stopcasting and /cancelaura and it did nothing
---
Everyone needs PBD, it's like a chest, sack of jewels, or crusader orbs. IMO if everyone else greeds it, you should have as well. If you waited until you were the last to roll, it was 100% a ninja from my point of view. If you were the first person to roll, I would say it would be obvious enough for everyone to need it. Either way you should have asked the group.
---
When is the dueling tournament?
---
Non BoP items, especially high end ones and ones used for professions, are generally considered Greed items.   
---
What you did is no different than an enchanter rolling need on everything because they can make enchants from the items. 
---
Sorry,  you were in the wrong.
---
This is wrong on so many levels.
---
Food for thought if a pally dies they cannot reroll so delete your character if it's a pally.

Not as of yet, I have tried everything you said, I have disabled all addons and made sure WoW was the only thing launched on my computer, still think it‚Äôs an issue with my ISP communicating with the servers.
---
No?
---
Queue dodging is attempting to get pugs against your premade.  This isn't to get more matches.  It's to get easier matches.  Balanced server populations won't solve this.  Battlegrounds on a single server will lend itself towards queue dodging or win trading 1000% more than a battlegroup.
---
You apparently didnt watch the summer beta dueling tournaments
---
Eh you can see it fine. Might agree with you if this was posted 10-15 years ago but phone cameras are more than capable rn
---
I'll chip in on the horde side. I know of two guilds and I apologize if any others are starting raiding I just haven't been keeping up.

Forged - Killed Onyxia and are currently doing Molten Core. Should get Ragnaros this week.

Toxic (I'm in) - Killing Onyxia starting on Saturday and currently doing Molten core. 8/10 and can and going for Ragnaros kill tonight.

No, emoting is just another form of communication.  Audience participation theater is RP and includes emotes.

No, no they don't and never had.
---
Raid bosses have 14% parry chance.
---
I am not far from that area. Trust me, you will not level your cooking there.
---
No need to rush it man. It‚Äôs the all about the journey, not the destination. Taking it slow myself. Been playing since launch and finally got to the coveted level 6 on my rogue. Pickpocketing never felt THIS good üòé

In fact i didn't launch all Hurricane exactly at the same moment, i had to alt tab, so you will see damage from other toon will start as soon as the first hurricane stop
---
Since that is the third time I screen cap of that....odds are ok-ish...
---
I got bonebiter, only 2 options around this level is bonebiter and ravager. Get someone to carry you through the SM Cath to complete the quest and you can get it earlier.
---
There‚Äôs a earthfury Reddit so maybe try there before you jump ship.
---
As some others have said here your first raid will likely be molten core and it's perfect cause you need like 6+ tanks for many fights with lots of adds. When I first started I was like 5th or 6th in line (based on gear), which means your add gets killed early in the fight and I didn't have to stay alive that long. Meanwhile the guys with better gear had to stay on their feet and control the mob much longer. But after many weeks of raiding and gearing up I did "make it" to MT slot eventually. Be warned Tanking something like Onyxia for the first time is quite a rush, especially if it's like the first successful kill for the group.
---
Yup, that‚Äôs good too. Not sure why I got the vote down, but w/e
---
I‚Äôm going to. Just curious what other‚Äôs experiences has been like.
---
I am gabagool. The real gabagool on sulfuras.
---
40-48 (Gatorbite) is a pretty big dry spell for axes unfortunately, WW Axe is a side (maybe even down)grade to Ravager.  I can tell you from personal experience, I crawled through these levels as an enhance shaman because of it.
---
This sub sucks because of people like you, actually.
---
Seems like we have a ton of warriors. Do warriors refuse to tank?
---
I don‚Äôt get it every day but if I‚Äôm sitting near a dungeon or in a major city for a long tine someone inevitably just asks.
---
And people I‚Äôve tanked with before also ask. Generally speaking it‚Äôs like if people don‚Äôt have a totally horrible dungeon experience with you, the tank gets added to the Rolodex.
---
Thanks for the info. My friends and I are trying to decide if its worth moving from Fairbanks. It's a high pop realm. Economy seems strong but the horde drastically outnumber the alliance. Makes world pvp less fun like you mentioned.
---
I am going to go out and say that at least 5% of wow is a niceguy(in the bad way).

I'm on stalagg.  Same problem.   All the alliance left.   I'm trying to figure out the best server to make my alliance alt on.  Cant leave stalagg cause friends.
---
Ah the Adriana killing was brutally marvelous
---
&gt; Is the constant drinking as Mage annoying?
---
Yes but if you are aoeing the satisfaction of killing 10 mobs at once makes up for it.
---
&gt; Is Mage leveling fast if you don't AOE?
---
I would say it's pretty good, but not top tier. Blink and portals will save you a lot of time. You have a lot of escape and cc so you should rarely die.
---
Best Feralis: Grinded our three levels on the harpies up top alone.  I spent a ton of time in this zone.
---
Worst Tanaris just because all I saw was general trade spam recruiting ZF cleave groups.
---
I'm sorry that's been your experience. Not all Hunters are like that. I always give a melee weapon to a melee before I take it. I also passed on h o j last night for a warrior even though I'm missing a trinket
---
Well, I'd say it's a bug then. Well done!
---
Never noticed this tree! Thanks for that screenshot but who did this?
---
I hope everyone changes now! Thanks bro!
---
I am a 60 priest, specced shadow, and have healed all dungeons and raids just fine. I'm probabaly not going holy or disc until bwl
---
The only real diff imo is slightly longer cast times but it really doesnt matter
---
Make this a series and post to YouTube. Might as well get that side coin.
---
&gt; factoring in stats the Arena ring
---
Stats are almost as good on Underworld. Unless you want that +4 strength for some reason.
---
[Does this help](https://youtu.be/Krs1oiydrbI)
---
I‚Äôm considering switching but i‚Äôm not sure. I‚Äôm currently ally on herod and even though it‚Äôs supposedly populated, it still takes me quite a while to find groups for mara and zf. Also there is a ton of horde compared to alliance.
---
You can, but you don't have to. The dbmarket updates are pretty frequent now, and are just fine for the purpose of a mouseover indication of value.
---
You're trusting an addon to be 100% accurate... try taking off ALL your mp5 gear and go and and cast something repeatedly so you are under the 5 sec rule, see what the addon tells you and compare that to your actual mana regen happening.
---
Yeah people that don't have 90g saved at 40 just aren't using the auction house well enough. I made about 60g from 35-40 just auctioning leather from leveling in STV, could have made more if I didn't use all my cloth for tailoring too. It's easy to put random greens and blues you find up for double their vendor price too.
---
"In vanilla WoW server population is everything"
---
vanilla server max online pop: about 3k
---
Blizz: Today a medium server's max pop is several times that of vanilla servers.
---
So, you're saying every server in 2004 were dead?
---
Better economy? if you buy yes, because there's so much of everything there, but if you're selling, your shit is worth half.
---
More wPvP? so I'll get ganked more by a group of 5 or a ??, that doesn't sound like fun.
---
You know that ninja your last group? well the server is so big that you'll never find him or make it so the server blacklists him.
---
Qs? well the servers with Qs are layered, so when they take that out, we back to 3 hours Q
---
Yeah when you used words like forced people instantly think "no, a hand didn't shoot out of your monitor and make your mouth move to say those words".
---
The success and failure both leverage you into being what works. I get that.
---
Even the +1 is enough to make people bail at the first sign of a wipe/trouble
---
I knew there was another one, but couldn't remember if it was Stalagg or Skeram. Sulfuras moved there too, but plenty of Horde moved with Alliance from that one.
---
I am hoping they release it in late November. Gives times for casuals to get to 60. Gives me time to get my alt to 60 (49 currently). And opens up the honor system before Christmas.
---
Personally, I am more excited about phase 3 than phase 2. But I don‚Äôt want the phases rushed. I want a slow release that I can enjoy playing and not a rushed one where I feel like I need to always work on my main. I had every class but warlock to 60 in vanilla (reason I am a lock main now). I could do this because of how spaced out content was. Once MC was on farm I had months to level alts with light raiding. Once BWL was on farm, again I could focus on alts and even take alts to raids. And once Naxx was on farm, again, I could focus on alts. And the spaced releases meant it was much easier to spend a few months in a pvp spec focusing on pvp while doing your 1-2 nights of raiding of content on farm. 
---
And I may do the same and level multiple alts in Classic. If they release BWL and the honor system before I have a chance to get some alts up, I will just end up feeling rushed. 
---
With that said, I understand that many are different from me and want a quick release. And I won‚Äôt mind it either if they add BGs quickly. But If they do that, I really hope they have a sizable gap for the last few phases.
---
Sometimes just happy to have a tank. Yesterday was my first time tanking brd. Have not been there since vanilla and in rarely ever. We got so lost we ended up clearing the whole thing by accident and doing the jailbreak quest for two people. I wanted to get the smelt dark iron but it seems you gotta do the chalice before you kill the council
---
Classicdb is based on private server data, and wowhead is bad. We just have to get used to documentation being kind of shaky for the next good while.
---
It might work, but Regrowth isn't that great yet and can probably move those points elsewhere. Standard Moonglow is much better.
---
They need to open faction specific transfers for realms in order to balance this issue but it seems they'd rather be willfully ignorant to the situation.  My server isnt bad, it's about 60H:40A but that discrepancy will continue to grow and it'll get worse if they open transfers.
---
Myself and 5 level 60 friends went from Faerlina to Arcanite Reaper earlier this week and we're absolutely loving it.
---
The community feels absolutely amazing and Horde/Alliance frequently pay each other visits in the others' main cities during non raid days.
---
Very glad we made the switch.
---
This post is the embodiment of ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt have anything good to say, say it on the Internet.‚Äù
---
So can potions, see the front page post about someone's health pot critting.
---
I play horde so I cant tell you for sure but it seems like Alliance has just as many people
---
doing /details should work, it won't show in the addon interface. Usually it has a popup on fresh installs or characters though. You may have installed the wrong one as well.

Someone kited Teremus from Blasted Lands through STV to Booty Bay last night on Blaumeux. Great fun was had by all.
---
Shaman was a grind 30-45. Once ele gets rolling it‚Äôs very fun. Lots of drinking though.
---
I agree but on another note I see these post at least twice a day as well. So you fall inline with it well.
---
Bruh we have all done this
---
Not really necessary as 17 minute run is less than 5 runs per hour. Killing mobs in your way of bosses increases the average gold per mob killed. 
---
Think of it from this perspective: you are still killing mobs at the same pace, but now you are substituting in boss enemies for vendor items more frequently.
---
Do you never readjust your zoom?
---
Now get yourself Broken Tooth you n00b!
---
Someone else already said this, but take it to the daily questions megathreads. It's why they are there.
---
This. Anyone who says different is just salty about the addon or doesnt understand how it works.
---
Weird.
---
I'm not that surprised honestly. The days of Everquest were a much different time, and the internet was still a frontier. There were a lot fewer people on it then, and a lot of them were *weird*.
---
Awesome man, good shit. I've probably taken a class with them because I remember our 2 programs shared a COMM class, I'm in my final year
---
Yeah I've slowly began to realize that they are far less reliable than I thought they were.
---
One on incendius Two Rogues One Chalice. So many unoriginal guild names.
---
The only current realm transfers are from high pop to low pop servers.
---
The only other thing that has been said by an employee is that they are attempting to never allow paid realm transfers.
---
With how launch went and how many people got messed up (and how much profit they could make) I can see them reversing that decision but nothing has been said about it that I am aware of.
---
Is there anything with cool long term value or just the shitty wands/masks
---
That was first implemented in tbc, so no it will not be a thing.
---
Idk lol it is kinda weird. I would assume a big dinosaur but there are none that big.
---
Big mouth bass or small mouth bass? Big mouth bass are actually an easier catch
---
I‚Äôm still running around on foot at 45 because I made the mistake of combining all available gold on my 35 alt and 40 main to buy my main a mount, and then my 35 (now 45) alt became my main a week later.
---
Dude sees me running around in Tanaris and whispers ‚Äúno mount?‚Äù I reply with my above sob story and he empathizes with me. We chat for a few more minutes about the difficulties of gold making, how expensive skills are, etc. and he wishes me well.
---
About 30 min. later I‚Äôm fighting a string of 4 mobs on top of a treasure chest and this random asshole ninjas the chest. After I finish the last mob I take a closer look at the player and its that  same dude that I was speaking with earlier.
---
Those are my player experiences...
---
You forgot the pointless complaints that don't offer anything substantial or constructive.
---
Bags turn for a decent profit when you factor in mat costs. Making stuff like chests or shoulders is normally too expensive to profit from.
---
On my server the horde wouldn‚Äôt have let that happen. Idk who you‚Äôre paying off but I‚Äôd love to get in on that haha
---
Food for thought! Might allow me to add another layer into the macro.
---
Although the candy doesn't last forever, it's better than anything else avail. atm
---
What weapon are you using? SoC is great with a slow weapon but you need to make sure your weapon is good. Having one of the top weapons for your level should be your #1 priority and will help with damage more than changing specs will since your main damage comes from auto attacks. What level are you and what weapon do you have?
---
I'd argue he'd do even better than the early days. Twitch these days is people just watching video's of other people's drama.
---
Honestly, if you have the gear...kind of.
---
Reality is DPS doesn't wait for you to get aggro, so your job would be to taunt off the healer and that's it.  
---
yeah my thought was to use regrowth on myself to proc Nature's grace before attacking a mob or something, but not sure if it would work or not.  This is going to be an alt so i may never know lol.
---
Beavers.
---
Giant ones.
---
This is the most efficient way.  A fast five cap it outrageously fast.
---
Washed up is garbage. Always crushed in wpvp on a horde dominated server. It doesn‚Äôt surprise me that these guys were pinching pennies on a 20min run to the mount boss lol. See you in BRM or Crater. Colluding scumbags
---
You are so brave to make such a post!
---
Yeah, people didn't want Paladin tanks 15 years ago in vanilla, either.
---
I like how he says "go on with your bad self" and obviously has no idea what that phrase means.
---
Still not sure you read my post. 
---
Anyway, that‚Äôs on you to manage that as a raid leader. Most people that run the +1 system have you locked out of loot for the entire raid once you get something. The system I‚Äôm recommending is much more lenient.
---
Na I know most hunters I have interacted with know their shit and are good. Just lately been having some bad experiences with them. But honestly its just... every class going to have that. Just sucks when a class who needs say a sword way less and they win a really damn good sword over a class who needs it a lot more.
---
I seem to remember a 16 slot pumpkin bag.  Is that in classic?
---
This joke has been made numerous times. Thus, repost.

---
The majority of your damage is going to be from backstabs and it doesn't build combo points easily so your combo points are going to be used keeping slice and dice up.  Improving sinister strike damage or improved eviscerate damage is useless since you won't be using either much at all.  The 20% bump in ambush and backstab damage is excellent though.
---
Tldr: Be undead.
---
I'm not a tank yet and I wouldn't mind it..
---
As a 30 year old I have absolutely no idea why people watch people play video games. Even as a kid I hated when it wasnt my turn and I'd have to watch. What else I dont understand is why people give him money when they can watch for free? What's the deal with that.
---
Even when I watch YouTube videos. If the video creator has to constantly show his or her face while they are doing a tutorial video I close it. I wish everyone on the internet wasnt trying to be famous
---
Also this guys face infuriates me for some reason
---
I‚Äôm like MeatSanta...  
---
I hold onto any animal meat I find and then when I come across a hunter, I open trade, give them meat for free and /Y ‚ÄúNice to MEAT you!‚Äù the run away
---
hahaha look at this cope, incredible
---
Its not that necessary to follow a best in slot guide to the "t." Ony or MC aren't a gear check, minus maybe Rag.
---
during retail I only ever played a paladin or warrior. decided to roll warrior since im horde for classic. i realized im not 16 years old w infinite time on my hands anymore so after the WW Axe quest, i randomly switched to shaman
---
holy shit its so much fun. all the coolness of a big axe swing but w heals, wolf travel, extra hearthstone, water walking and breathing, and reincarnate!
---
and that sweet sweet windfury!
---
I watched a YouTube guide they didn‚Äôt mention it but not sure tbh
---
&gt; generally people know the general prices for items. 
---
I would politely disagree. The goblins who pay attention to that do, the regular people go, "Oh damn, rugged leather is 15s each now? Guess that's just what normal is now." And then they buy, because they only need 8 of it for the specific quest/item they care about in that moment. 
---
The people who track prices and buy in bulk to craft or flip are exceptions, not the norm. In the example we're talking about, bulk sellers are typically happy to sell at &lt;AH prices because they can move product quickly - this is how Sam's Club and Costco operate. More sales at a smaller per-item price results in an acceptable profit. 
---
Really it all comes down to the buyer and seller's motivations - if the seller wants to get rid of the item for any profit, they'll sell. If they know they can get more and aren't in a hurry, they'll hold. 
---
I feel like I'm just babbling about r/woweconmy stuff in general at this point, we probably are on the same page here.
---
The add on is only using the API blizzard allows, nothing more nothing less.
---
Level fucking 6? Jesus man, slow down. Are you a fucking hardcore nolifer or what? I'm only recently level 2 myself, playing a priest but I don't like the fantasy of damaging abilities because I'm a healer (only tryhards use smite), so I just allow my character to tag a mob once and then wait for someone else to kill it for me. I refuse to group though because people are assholes.
---
My first raiding guild was a bit "special" during TBC. I don't know how, but we managed to get our Hand of Ad'al titles before atunements were removed. There was only ever one Vashj kill and one Kaelthas kill. We had a guy who would literally die to the first fire wave on Archimonde, every time. Pretty sure that guild broke up specifically because we couldn't clear Archi due to that dude constantly wiping us, and the ensuing drama of eventually raid/gkicking him for the constant sabotage. Before Archimonde, he was a repeat offender with the Lady Vashj macro.
---
Nice, just saving it?
---
Why shouldnt I roll if its an upgrade? It's need before greed, and if it's an upgrade you need it right?
---
I dont see the problem, is the one who needs it the most supposed to be the one rolling need?
---
ok cool. Kind of unrelated but wanted to ask - I'm level 32 and just got sweeping strikes and a good blue 2H axe from Gnomer. Should I now prioritize Cruelty, Two handed weapon spec, or axe spec? I currently have 2/5 cruelty and none in the others.
---
Haven't noticed it happening even once.
---
Can't confirm.
---
the irony here is killing me
---
https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/28230
---
Darkshore: every alliance flightpath on Kalimdor will take you through Auberdine.  No exceptions.
---
yes of course, it should become easier even, it all depends on wether or not he resists your earthshock mutliple times (if it happens the fight can drag on a while, but you shouldnt be at risk of dying doing the shown tactic).
---
and if you are geared enough i would suggest doing the tank and spank method, its much faster but requires much better gear.
---
Did you have a limit to loot per person or was it just a MS &gt; OS Need system for every piece? 
---
My main concern right now is the lack of incentive for a PUG to stay in the raid after they win a piece of gear.
---
the irony here is killing me also
---
Can you please use night Mode?
---
Get ready to use same weapon for a long, long time. 
---
If you dont alreadu have one, install a damage meter and turn OFF auto reset. Hang like that for a day or two to be able to collect respetable amount of data. 
---
Than check the proc rate. 
---
I did this with my quest reward sword from duskwood, found out it had amazing %10 proc rate. This ended up being so good , it was outperforming weapons that have %30 more dps on them while questing.
---
I mean it isn‚Äôt. There‚Äôs literally just kargoz and he‚Äôs not even that big.
---
None from quests. You'll have to go outside axes to find one in a dungeon. Uldaman has Stoneslayer and The Rockpounder.
---
Darn I thought so.

---
Well that looks terrible but I'm on mobile
---
Same here. Took quite a while to tell YT I'm not interested in low effort crap like that.
---
I seriously don't understand how people are so broke. It's great not having to pay for a mount as a Warlock, but regardless of that I'm still level 45 with 187g to my name. I buy my gear off of the AH constantly, including the BoE epic ring Underworld Band. Even bought the Mooncloth Bag recipe for 75g. It's like people actively avoid any way to make money in this game.
---
No. I remember keeping my combat log open so I can catch nearby stealths. This really is no different.
---
We are also working adults that have limited time. But with that limited time we would like to play effectively and efficiently. Hoping we can find a good guild to progress with
---
Hey guys, I have 4g 20s 69c!
---
That is true. I don‚Äôt know how I didn‚Äôt think about this. You‚Äôre correct, not a good idea.
---
I think it's funny and I fully support it. I think this die hard emphasis on "u HaVe To GeT BiS!!" is cringey and silly and utterly pointless for everyone but a few players who want to theorycraft to the extreme. Just move on with your life. Go get something else. There's plenty of gear in the game. Griefing is an integral part of the game.
---
That's cool too! :)
---
Yeah I'm pretty new to hunter and I figure I can get more mileage by just baking the preferred skill into a macro. The only one I'm using right now is a start pet attack on hunters mark cast.
---
What I dont want is to plan to use screech once I have 3 or 4 mobs and have it be on cooldown when I actually want it to be used.
---
This man said druids dont do damage lol.
---
That exists. Called CEPGP.
---
The hero we need but don't deserve
---
whats the command? i am not having any luck
---
u/Biggus_TM is a power hungry, anti-social retard noob bully.
---
Typical for WoW really. He must be a GM.
---
how do tanks deal with aoe addict mages?
---
Horde
---
We had runs yesterday where we only got 1 or even 0 rare items in the chest. Only killed the king.
---
Can you do the math on how much %hit translates to AP? I feel like BiS list priories too much % hit when allot can be traded out for agi+AP. Rogues specifically. They get 5% hit talent. Also how much hit % can be translated from the human racial of + 5 swords?
---
Honestly, I love balance but I would never level up as balance. Feral is just too good and efficient. Moonglow totally works at 60 for solo and raiding though.
---
It might be the strike thatbreaks your shield?
---
Classic Zebb...
---
This is pretty standard I think. You can swap the improved overpower for anything else to your taste. I like the crits personally. 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/0230502135201
---
From here I went axe spec just because they seem most common. But I was pretty unsure myself.
---
I think you like salt
---
I refuse to watch him based on the stupid pic he has of himself with his mouth open in shock on every fucking clip.
---
They get +5% intellect as a racial bonus.
---
Nice, me too.
---
In behalf of everyone. Thank you for such a generous deed! You never know who is saving up for their first mount or new piece gear! It saves so much money!
---
I really wouldn't call pvp subjective, as just because there's an opinion on what works, doesnt mean it works. All gear is objective in WoW.
---
While other classes get geared on their expense and farm the fuck out of mobs, making it harder for warriors to level or get to any farming spots.
---
&gt;First of all, so are the LFG addons that keep getting shut down.
---
You mean the ones that arent shut down.
---
It's the pinnacle of raiding in vanilla, it's supposed to obsolete everything
---
It's a big problem on my server. People don't tank because they are scared of it.  Theres no need to be scared.  Its hard, yes.  Its rewarding, yes.  Just do your prep work and give it a go.  Hell, for the first long bit of leveling you can tank with whatever talents and gear you want as long as its mail / plate or a bear.  
---
Anyways, I know you dont need this.  I just wanted to put it out there.
---
Linje 3 much ?
---
Carbonite did it as well.
---
To OP:
---
&gt; For anybody not familiar with Spy, it is an addon that essentially scans everything within your vision range (even if they're behind you or hiding any other place where you actually cannot see them). 
---
No it doesn't.  You can literally read the source code and see what it does.  That's what LUA files are; source code.  It checks the combat log, mouseover, and target.  It also gets data from other people that use the addon, so if someone else had targeted/moused over/combat logged your flying druid, you would know about it.
---
&gt; This is a somewhat notorious addon that has been banned on many private servers for being more or less cheating, yet it's still up &amp; working in classic.
---
No one cares what pservers do.
---
Hamstring kiting barely works, whereas it was extremely effective on pservers. It's not totally useless but it's also not very helpful. Simply having a smart gear progression and keeping most of your quests green along with doing dungeons will make leveling a breeze.
---
Try logging into retail and see if your char is still there.
---
but sometimes people just want to get rid of it (me) and dont really have any price, higher is better. if i say 3 to 10g, people will go for 3 ofc, but if you come with what you can pay, i might accept it right away. 
---
p.s. i do not do like this guy tho, i explain and most likely get an offer i accept
---
The people who got ninjaed decided to play with Asmon. They can decided for themselfs if they want to continue doing so.
---
Absolutly no reason to change classic because of that dimwit.
---
So no.
---
It works the same in Final Fantasy Tactics with spell effects. If your character has too low of a Faith stat (how much they believe in magic), spell effects such as physical and magic barriers and haste spells can miss them. The real kick in the dick is when a dead party member doesn't get revived by your revive spell and then fades away the next turn.
---
I know. That‚Äôs why the guides recommend them.
---
Can someone explain raid lockouts. I guess Molten Core resets every Tuesday and Onyxia resets every 5 days depending on when you kill her? Is that right?
---
Huh?
---
So does that make it a trash talent to spend points in?
---
Hm. Maybe I'll post in forum to see if I can get blue posts if no one else can confirm.
---
I notice it mostly when spamming Mind Flay while PW:S is up, I'll get pushback maybe once every 20 mobs or so. Not too often but often enough to be annoying.
---
EDIT: I'll also try and get a screencast if I can of it happening
---
Guy on alliance on my server named VeatySwagina.   
---
I am on horde and foudn myself running next to him and proceeded to lick and sniff him until we parted ways
---
I'm expecting it to be pretty bad when I get to that point but I'm still a few levels away from knowing exactly how bad.
---
An old man, turned ninety eight. He won the lottery and died the next day.
---
I've not heard good things about Windseeker pop but that could be dated info.
---
I would consider the same if the situation is better but I've got a guild to run and there's no reason to expect them to transfer.
---
I'd like to know that for European servers. I'm happy with my server but I'm fairly sure it's Alliance heavy (I'm Alliance) and I'd like to know just *how* different the ratio is.
---
I'm on Mankrik too.  Had 3 or 4 invites on Day 1, and none since.
---
Yeah the placenta for the FP in desolace is pretty aids. The biggest problem with tanaris is when you are on the opposite side of the zone and you get ganked or die the run from GY is insane.
---
Not sure if it‚Äôs a pally ability in classic but Light of the Martyr has killed me quite a few times as a holy pally 
---
‚ÄúA quick 20k healing before holy shock is up‚Äù
---
‚ÄúOh it crit for 80k and killed me, sweet‚Äù
---
Too many druids are leveling with the expectation that they will get to dps. Unless you happen to join a guild of people you know its probably not happening. I honestly got lucky and proved to a group of officers (unknowingly) that I could perform well and they allow me to raid as feral. But the other 4 druids are resto with one that off tanks if needed.
---
I've seen BOE drops in every MC run within the first 4 bosses, so far.
---
Edit: We had 2 nightslayer belts and 2 cenarion belts drop just inbetween garr and the guy before him, once.
---
It's terrible if you're taking holy talents (more int, better healing). I was asked to tank with these talents around BFD level and I hated it. I hit like a wet noodle and couldn't hold aggro easily, not off of healers using mind blast and dps not waiting a few seconds for ticks of Consecration.
---
Anyway, I'm leveling my paladin as holy but I'm leveling almost entirely through dungeon groups. A lot of ret paladins are getting Consecration and then heading into the ret tree to help their damage (or grabbing it after they get SoC), but the issue with using it is that warrior tanks struggle with aoe threat at lower levels and you're basically tanking if you bust out with Consecration too early.
---
So uh, yes. Going holy will slow down your solo leveling. Consecration is negligible when it comes to single target DPS, especially at low levels. (Save that mana for healing yourself.)
---
that's more of a localization issue from them interacting with people who don't have the Chinese locale active on their pc I think
---
There are very fast USB drives in it there. I can read write at around 160 MB a sec
---
summoners war [cringe] ... again, not my proudest gaming phase. the game they were sponsored to stream was something else though, 'Dungeon Hunter Champions' IIRC
---
&gt; What an original and genius idea, gee why didn't we think of that sooner! Absolute morons.
---
Yea but have you actually tried it though? This is like saying you disapprove of something the government did then when asked to join a protest you just say "nah the other side has more people ima just chill at home." You didn't even try so you have no bearing on whether it's a successful idea or not. 
---
&gt;In the meantime, I'm fine with skipping devilsaur gear, going with alternate best in slot and being slightly suboptimal if it means keeping my gold out of the pockets of these losers.
---
Great you've reached another of many solutions.
---
If its red its dead mentality. Some take it more serious then others
---
You guys accepting new people for raiding?
---
That's not common at all wtf. Sure they would mark the shit up like nuts and expect you to slash the price quite a bit, but most would at least start with a price.
---
I give free shit to ppl I enjoyed playing and talking with. Same goes for lots of ppl I met on classic.
---
&gt;so if someone else had targeted/moused over/combat logged your flying druid, you would know about it.
---
But nobody is. As you can tell by the spy addon, I'm the only one there.
---
&gt;No one cares what pservers do.
---
You're not the sharpest tool, huh? ‚ô•
---
And then you made it all about yourself.
---
....that quest log, though.
---
*I'll be in my bunk*
---
Mine is very very bad.   Stalagg.
---
So by your logic you would roll on something with +spell damage and +spell bit if it was a 1 stam upgrade to your piece of gear that was only Stan on it before? That‚Äôs fucked up dude.
---
Yes, in a world where it's routine to hire mass murder, sniffing some dust of some kind for sure should be outlawed!  Especially in a pirate town...?
---
people are so desperate for tanks you can pretty much do anything and be fine. I always ask since everyone is "new" there hasnt been any rage yet.
---
I mean I'll take free bags over everything else.
---
This is America, we 5 7 5 here.
---
But do you really want to hurt me?
---
As someone who gets poly  morphed by mages half my level consistently I don't believe you
---
I know the answer, but I am not going to tell you because you never getting the answer is funny, as well as the useless replies. So I‚Äôll give you anouther useless reply. ‚ÄúI had the same question once, but I fixed it.‚Äù
---
Feral is the way to go for leveling your druid, and most of the feral talents benefit both cat and bear. When they don't it's better to focus on cat talents for better solo dps, and your dungeon tanking will be fine. You also should have no problem healing dungeons if you want as long as you keep a set of int/spirit gear.
---
ah ok. I have 2/2 overpower and improved charge already, instead of 2H weapon spec. I guess I'll continue my next 5 pts in 2H spec then. Thanks. Either way, I'll have to respec at 40 anyways if I want MS
---
For that use case, I recommend holy/reckoning.  
---
Here's a starting point: [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sE0uzgoZVGdIczx](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sE0uzgoZVGdIczx)  
---
As long as you have illumination and divine favor plus a set with +healing, you're pretty much good to go for raid healing.
---
would you be ok with me being an undead but transmog my race in to a gnome? or is teh silhouette sacred?
---
No, there will be no damage done to me, and will happen even if the shield has just been activated
---
I've actually had that happen lol!
---
You'll be rage capped if you're crit capped so spamming HS isn't a problem. Plus, on some servers it's not that easy to get ony buffs :P
---
Well for starters you arent gonna use a level 33 leather helmet with no other stats as a tank. And if youre using one of the other two items you mentioned, neither of which even resemble a tanking item, what happens when you get like a purple tank item for that slot? Just sacrifice 3% hit? 
---
Thats why theyre a wasted item slot.
---
And I suspect he gets killed way more than 400 times/day on most of the servers.
---
Command? Just talk to an inn keeper and there should be an option.
---
I'm sharp enough to read the source code and prove you wrong.
---
I don‚Äôt know, I saw it here all the time on here and it made me wanna help out my fellow Ally friends. Got on for an hour yesterday planning to farm leather but a fresh 40 dwarf warrior in IF who I guess is new to WoW asked where to train mount training. I said I‚Äôd take him there with my aspect of the pack. On the way he said he was gonna just buy the training since he didn‚Äôt have enough for the mount, I decided to just give him the other 12 gold he needed... then I decided to grief a shitty warlock in Astranar who was probably farming felcloth because they ignored me after I whispered them about a LW recipe I needed from the mobs they were killing, so I decided to be a hunter and instant mark all the mobs she was trying to kill and farm myself instead taking all her mobs. We are all good and bad sometimes lmao.
---
Well nuking a lock is easy but damn. You destroyed that mage aswell? Hats off.
---
I know its doable with engi but its like flipping coins.

Well, this one catches people who don't stealth or do anything. Catches anybody in your vision range.

It's literally the easiest class in the game to play and nobody would want to watch it truly...

Its not that interesting to watch others quest/grind

It's not a problem to begin with

if you already have a fair price in mind just name those, why the silly psychology game.

The term you're looking for is "Fail Upwards".

---
That's probably about fair for that level. You'll most likely only have 3-5g at that level. Make sure to check a guide to see what spells you can skip for your class though or hold off leveling. Buying all skills wastes gold.  When you hit 30, gold really ramps up. SM is a money maker too.

I downvoted this purely because you use a phone to screen shot.
---
I'm less concerned about ratio than total horde population. That's what matters on pve. Where are you getting your numbers? The only source I could find showed a **very** low horde population on Windseeker - fewer than 100 @ 60.
---
As far as I know there's no limit on transfers while they're offering them.
---
edit: for reference, here are the most "recent" sources I could find on the site being used since the census addon allegedly was fixed : [pagle](https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?minLevel=40&amp;realm=4385_Pagle) [windseeker](https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?minLevel=40&amp;realm=4727_Windseeker) [characters 40-60]
---
I should have used the qualifier to say as soon as you have 4 warlocks.
---
Stop training all your talents. You start to get a lot more gold as you get closer to 40. Save as much of it as you can. Vendor greens instead of DEing them.
---
You won't be right at 90g, but you'll be a lot closer than you think. Someone will loan you 10g so you can get your mount and then you'll be able to pay them back within a day if you grind quests.
---
People always exaggerate this shit. They get upset about seeing some bullshit census addon population counts, then they get killed by some horde and get more upset. Then when they think about it, it isnt really as bad as they thought it was in the heat of the moment so they the exaggerations begin. 
---
They claim to get camp by 2-3 horde for extended periods of time, then it's impossible to get into blackrock mountain, and then they start with ridiculous claims about population ratios. It's not the best on Kirtonos alliance, but these people are making is sound far worse than it will ever be.

Common saying: "Having gold for your mount at 40 isn't hard"
---
Realistic saying: "Having gold for your mount at 40 isn't hard if you get lucky with vendor drops and green/blue boe drops that people will actually pay for, and you also boringly farm certain areas for with good vendor trash for 4-5 levels in your 30s."    
---
I skinned/herbed and didn't buy unnecessary skills and still didn't get my mount until 43, and that's as a druid who barely bought any food or drink and didn't spend any money items.
---
gd you babies really need to go away
---
If you have that kind of cash, at that level, after buying those items on the AH, even without having to buy a mount, you are waaay richer than average. What exactly are you doing to make that kind of money?
---
&gt;neither of which even resemble a tanking item
---
Ah yeah, forgot. Gotta get that 440 def cap right? Big strong tonks.
---
I've been checking out Earthfury as well. Everyone mentioning working adult and "dadserver" in regards to Earthfury has me interested.  I noted the low number of items on AH, and also the decline in Trade/LFG activity at night. Even so, I'm thinking I may transfer. The guild posts I've seen on the forums and discord are more appealing to me than anything I've seen lately on my current server.
---
I level in restoration spec.. people are frequently looking for healers for instances, and just someone to help with random elite quests around the map and I join the groups..
---
Otherwise questing alone is kind of hard for me hahaha
---
The thing is, there are ***so many more players*** on these servers than even the most populated servers had back in vanilla. (we are excluding private servers because they were a different environment)
---
Because of this, there are many more nice players, and just as many more toxic players. What you choose to focus on is going to be what you see more of. Also, if you were part of the first wave of level 60s, you got shafted in with many of the hardcore players that also have a larger portion of the toxic players. 
---
The more casual players are slowly making their way up now, and a lot of them are super friendly, and outgoing, and just willing to give to others.
---
Oh yeah, definitely. You could keybind screech to something very specific and use it as if it's one of your abilities (and keep it 'off' all other times) if you wanted to, too. (I think default pet bar bindings are awkward.)
---
Here's what I do, if it helps!
---
I put Claw (or Bite or whatever) with arcane shot, which may not be ideal in every situation, but it lets me press the button when AS is on cooldown and my cat will still use the ability if he has the focus to. I tend to spam that on runners in dungeons to quickly kill them. Sometimes Arcane Shot can pull aggro off my pet out in the world too, and I think having both the pet and I use an ability in the same small time frame can help prevent that from happening because he generates threat from Claw before my AS hits the enemy.)
---
My start pet attack macro is baked into AutoShot and here's why: you should always start attacking with auto-shot (as you would do when kiting) because otherwise you 'miss out' on that attack. If you start with arcane shot, you then have to wait for the shot timer to fill before your character will autoshot. If you start with Autoshot and then hit Arcane Shot after the first arrow fires, you've gotten in the 'extra' hit. It's not always a big deal but it can make a difference out in the world for sure.
---
(If I don't want to actually start autoshotting--for example, if I want my pet to pull for me--then I jump around while I press it, because you can't auto-shot while moving.)
---
The reason I don't bake it into Hunter's Mark is because I use Hunter's Mark to help guide people to kill the proper mob if nobody's marking in a dungeon, or to help a tank 'see' what pack to kill next if they're new. Definitely don't want my pet running in then! It also lasts a couple of minutes so I like to 'pre' mark, wait for tank to get aggro, and then immediately start attacking (it doesn't matter that I start shooting before my pet gets there, especially in dungeons).
---
Hopefully this made sense, I'm typing it up at work in between interruptions lol.
---
I named my mage 'beetjedorst' translates to 'little thirsty' cause I knew I will drink a lot!
---
absolutely LOVED having to reset a 40 minute battle in FFT because one of my carefully crafted/long time ally/known him since he was a squire in Dorter Trade City characters refuses to accept a raise. White mage misses 3 times, goes OOM. dead character crystallizes, instant reset even if you win the battle, not worth losing the guy

I've always wondered, does /em or /me show up to members of the other faction? If so couldn't you just do things like '/me says, "blah blah" ' to communicate with them?

I could never watch his videos based on his face alone. Neurotypical people do not make faces like that at video games

All the rest of my spells are going off when they should, as in I don't notice any latency drops, but I'll keep an eye to see if it spikes
---
It‚Äôs analogous to Un nerfed demo shout. I can use it to pull aggro of my tank in dungeons when he‚Äôs about to die, since it‚Äôs an instant cast focus dump with no CD

While I agree with mostly all of this post the order in which people should be geared generally leans towards gearing healers after the top dps classes aka warrior/rogue/mage. Should be MT &gt; OT &gt; dps &gt; healers. Content in the first 3 phases are so trivial you can easily heal it without pre BiS gear let alone even being level 60.
---
Mostly fishing. Buying the recipe for Mooncloth Bags was an investment but I knew it would quickly pay itself off. Recently I snagged a few of the Runecloth bag recipes from the vendor and was able to AH them for 50-60g each.

I‚Äôm on benediction and this is the case as well, except as a horde player. Constant 2/3/4v1s because that‚Äôs just how pvp servers are. People don‚Äôt really attack in fair fights, they‚Äôd rather just quest/not gank you while you‚Äôre fighting a mob (and then after someone spares you/you spare someone you‚Äôre not gonna attack them surely, unless someone else on your faction lays into them...)
---
That being said, the faction imbalance on skeram seemed pretty nuts. But as a warrior, getting camped from 30-40 seemed pretty standard in the open world
---
I started on Kromcrush as soon as it opened and it said PVP on the realm list. Maybe you mean on blizzards announcement?
---
While true since he was wielding a rune blade, no death knights in classic tho so I guess you really couldn't recreate the scene very well in classic yet
---
Isn't it one in 4000?
---
edit: 1/(3%\*5%\*16%) = 4166
---
it ramps up a lot in the late thirties, i had less than than 5g to my name like until like lvl 35-40 where i was able to shoot up to 90g
---
hey!
---
It‚Äôs not but it‚Äôs a really balanced server with a slight horde majority.
---
This is a pretty stupid take. Asmon is entertaining because of his personality, Shroud is entertaining because he is a god. They are both amazing at two different things why should you not be envious over Asmon just because he cant pvp in a video game, the man literally has the dream job of all gamers.
---
It's $15...however, if you really want, most times you can ask a GM to give you some time on your account and they will do it.
---
I can‚Äôt in good conscience upvote a post where you took a picture with your phone.
---
And posting it to a forum doesn't? Not sure where you're going with this
---
I'm pretty sure the horde would have killed him regardless
---
and more if you have herbalism.
---
Thunder Bluff is smaller and thus faster to get to vendors/etc than every other city.
---
Lol fuck that 1 item per raid until everyone has something noise. So potentially a person can raid for weeks without getting a chance at a second loot piece of their class is stacked?  No thanks.
---
Maybe not as bursty as you'd like but spriest literally just has three damage buttons and one is a dot.
---
Which forum do you moderate?
---
Ofc not.
---
Just flag yourself in the open world. It‚Äôs about the same experience anyway
---
I've always just done /me whenever I wanted to do something outside of the standard couple of emotes. Good to know there are a bunch with sounds and movement though.
---
Interesting that there are three variations of Congratulations but no /grats
---
unless you are in a employee market like I am in washington. My wife named her price and she makes more than her peers who have been there forever. You get bigger raises jumping ship right now than you go progressing up the ladder. of average I been seeing people get 20-30% raise increases by going to another job doing the same thing.
---
What's required for proper heal predictions in a raid? I know for example Luna Unit Frames have them for me when I heal. Do all the healers need to use the same unit frames for proper heal prediction or do they just need something other than the standard raid frames?
---
I have auctioneer also and when I first got it, it was a bit confusing but it‚Äôs so useful once I spent a few minutes learning it. Go to the tab called Appraiser and throw an item into the box at top left, click on the default market value in the drop down list and click the refresh button at bottom, that will give you market prices and automatically set the price of your item at the median level of market value, almost guaranteed to sell, and make you a profit. You can also set your own price if you think it will sell higher. Then set the stack size you want to sell by, it defaults to stacks of 20 (or full stacks), click on List Item, and boom you‚Äôre done. It lists all of that item in your bags with one click. 
---
Perfect for skinners or herbalists who have over 100 of something in their bags to sell. 
---
You can get more fancy with it if you want but that‚Äôs the usefulness I‚Äôve found with it and I like it a lot.
---
No restriction. If they pug had hot dice, they made out like kings. We‚Äôd usually only be pugging less than 5 people total in a 25 man raid
---
Addon fucking sucks, fix the game blizzard.
---
I'm not your friend, pal.
---
Lol so glad you won. Fuck a cat druid. When my HoJ dropped, I rolled against a rogue and enhancement shaman. The shammie rage quit when he lost. Like that would be a total waste on enhancement shaman vs warrior or rogue.
---
&gt; They were not only OK with it, they even went out of their way into other outlets to fiercely defend them from criticism,

This explains basically every problem in the US today. Very little of the corruption in either business or politics is hidden, people just lie to themselves about how bad it is

You broke the cardinal rule of retaining your sanity: don't watch Asmongold

I'm touching hunter for the first time, and the loyalty system makes me want to pull my hair out.  Do I want my pet on level or not?! If it takes too long to ding, they drop loyalty level from not gaining xp, so I have to juggle them and I hate it
---
The private server folks deserve all the recognition they get, they've literally been perfecting their methods for years. 
---
Doesn't asmondgold have like 8 different guilds all maxed out? I heard one of them got taken over by a troll. I don't mind the smaller streamers or others, but asmondgold in particular is just annoying to me.
---
Reddit literally despises Asmongold it's funny. If you enjoy this game he is basically living your dream. Sorry but you just can't argue about being a millionaire playing World of Warcraft.

this is shit advice. It's good gear... I mean lmfao. Yea you don't need it. But if you have the funds no reason not to.

I mean it depends on your mc groups but its not guarntee loot in MC. Small amount of loot.... lots of players.... could be waiting awhile.

Rofl thats not even the point. You misconstruing my argument by using one bullshit exaggerated example gets you nowhere.

A wasted itemslot at any stage of progression is significant. Theres a pretty big difference between 440 defense cap and wearing fuckin leather with no stats bud. Youre in fairy land

Silithus is known as the ass end of the world.  Farthest away from everything.
---
&gt;Essentially you should have weapon expertise, and then maybe one other weapon skill item. Anything more and the gains are incredibly minor.
---
I am curious if it would be better to go 1/2 weapon expertise with one +dagger piece which should put you around 308
---
Is this copy pasta or real. Either way, oof.
---
Nah I work at a great place.  There is a difference when you're trying to be courteous of your fellow colleagues.  I also see the Rattus Asmongoldus fan base didn't like that comment.
---
&gt; In this case, the healer only invests heals on you, and should only cast big heals when you start falling down and regenerate otherwise. If they're a shit healer, however, they'll invest multiple small expensive heals into you to keep you permanently topped off like it's retail.
---
Not entirely valid.
---
On my Paladin at 39 with the amount of +healing I have, Rank 1 Flash of Light is about 1.4x more Mana efficient than the latest rank of Holy Light. In any situation where I'm going to likely have to heal again within 10 maybe even 15 seconds, spamming FoL (alternating between Rank 1/Latest Rank depending on incoming damage) is better than waiting on big Holy Lights and trying to regen between. Also, not relying on the Regen makes it less punishing to do things like stun and judge justice/light/wisdom.
---
It's not even an argument, it's you saying the spy addon needs to be banned and it's me saying blizzard wont. You're the one taking it personal because you aren't getting your way
---
Why are there so many level 37 multi boxers?
---
I've seen at least 4 cases of a mob of warriors or mages running around at level 37 in noob zones.
---
Yep, I use that one every time a skull level Ally attacks me.
---
I hate him because I think he's an asshole. I've tuned into his streams several times and without fail he acts like a dickhead and has people give him items.
---
I have no problems with people who play video games for a living. I don't have any problems with Shroud, Summit, and a bunch of other people who get paid to play video games, because they're not massive dicks to everyone.
---
That's like saying you're not greedy because you didn't pick up a penny on the ground that you saw from across the parking lot. He has enough from streaming that he doesn't care enough to spend hours picking up literal pennies from YouTube. 
---
YouTube videos don't make shit compared to the time/effort required for them. Twitch is 99% of his income.
---
I don't really know how else you'd explain such a gross imbalance towards to Horde on that particular server.

How has no one said Duskwood has Mor'Ladim... cmon guys

Only if they're in front of you. This addon will catch people flying 100 yds above you, that you have zero vision of.

Realistically a mix of good dungeon gear with a couple MC epics is what a lot of people entering BWL will be wearing.
---
My corruption, immolate, siphon and felpup. That shield will eat the corruption, sure. The other two + pet go through, and your health pool is a lot smaller than mine. Not to mention that I have a soulstone, a health stone, a life drain, a spellstone, can instant fear you, shadowburn you, don't care in the slightest about that frost CC shizzle.
---
It's a pretty one sided matchup

I farmed UD strat ramstein 35 times over the course of 5 days for crest of retribution and anger/golem around 50 for HoJ/Nagle over the same time period. Never even saw any of the 3 drop in that time.
---
Day 6 i get all three of em in the first runs of the day for each, help the guild with a second anger/golem and nagle drops again. 
---
50 runs without seeing it then 2 in a row. Went through stages of the legs dropping 8 times in a row.
---
Those are potentially anomalies and maybe just lucky situations but ive noticed patterns throughout my classic experience. I really think youre onto something and id be super interested in more data on this.

I was just killing some mobs in moonsbrook, some 56 rogue came and traded me bunch of grey items then asked if i wanted to tag along in deadmines (he was getting greens for enchanting). He said i could take anything i needed too. I was level 15 at the time, it was nice. After we were done some 60 hunter was asking in chat if anyone wanted a free boost. He got 4 people and went in.

You are an idiot, and the perfect example of why we shouldn't all go into a mad panic every time one guy shows up here and starts spouting off how something is ruining the world.  You have no idea what you are talking about, yet here you are insisting you are right.
---
1. I have Spy.
---
2. You have Spy.
---
3. We are on the same faction.

4. We are in the same zone.

5. Druid flies above me, and I mouse over him.

6. Your Spy receives information from my Spy about the druid.

Is there spellcleave meta in scholo or Strath?

---
Thanks a lot, I'll check that out!
---
more spirit than intellect really, but yeah.. i havent even bought any feral skills.. I always level this way anyway, so its kinda the norm..
---
This actually happened on Rattlegore-PvP, not an RP realm
---
Can confirm, 27 rend kills and I‚Äôve never seen the mainhand but I‚Äôve seen the offhand drops 3x
---
wait thats gay
---
What server? I have lent many people money for mounts. Got paid back every time. After lvl 40-45 the money comes much easier so I don't mind jumpstarting people to get there.
---
Nice.
---
When I finally killed him, there was a 60 rogue who would stealth, wait until you engaged, then gank my party of 4 and kill us all. It took 3 tries, but we eventually managed to kill both the rogue and tethis with a bit of help from another group.
---
&gt;So, you are literally arguing that when you steal shit, it becomes your private property, eh?
---
..no. Nothing's been stolen. They're using their own servers. Are you like 5 or something? You thought they were servers that were literally robbed from Blizzard, and then used to host private servers. That's actually hilarious &amp; cute.
---
People post phone screenshots because it‚Äôs easier and faster than logging into reddit on the computer. I tried it once and Reddit on the computer is aids to the eyes.
---
What a cute lie.
---
Lol right? Wtf is this server transfer. US east pvp to latin america??
---
If someone is 100yrds away from me i have nothing to worry about.
---
Also you can turn the camera to see around you.
---
I regularly bow to people after I've saved or helpe them. It's like bowing at the end of a performance.
---
Yeah... just put it on your main action bar in the same spot with the same hotkey...
---
For me, when I'm in battle stance, Retaliate is Ctrl+D
---
Then D-stance, it's in the same spot on the action bar, also at Ctrl+D.
---
You don't need macros or anything for this.
---
Don't worry there's still those of out there doing the lords work and killing every grey enemy we encounter.
---
I'm not the person to talk to. Both guilds are not "short on people" meaning "if you're raid ready, you are so in", but recruitment I'm certain is almost always going to be a thing.
---
Your probobly gonna end up doing alot of mob grinding anyway just for XP, just throw on your favorite form of passive entertainment turn your brain off amd go ham.
---
So what you're saying is... I should kick off the conversation with "I see you have assumed the position, let me show you mine".
---
I tried this a few hours ago, didn't work. I could report players in LFG and world chat but not those.
---
It‚Äôs a meme. These people are living the meme.
---
It doesn't sound like either of you are cut out for a real MMO.  Have you tried retail?  You don't have to put in real effort there - might be a better pace for you both.
---
Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy the game. Just like, every other video game sub has so much more substance. 
---
I'm really enjoying feeling like the world is huge again.
---
HOW MANY LEGOS DO YOU HAVE
---
Right. I roll orc for a reason. But the average dude will be fine, and a decently skilled player can make any race/class combination work well
---
Please, point me to the part in the addon source where it does a visual scan.  Like I said, it doesn't have to be in _your_ combat log, so a screenshot of that is meaningless.
---
Edit: The addon detects enemies on target and mouseover too, so someone else in your zone probably moused over him.
---
Ah, well if its something you are use to then have at it. I'm actually in process of leveling my 2nd druid. Currently 32 and going feral all the way haha. It's going to be my pvp druid.
---
Warriors have the highest *sustained* dps in the game. They are notably bad at cold opening (such as in duel settings) which is why they are considered dead last in 1v1 ability.
---
A SL warlock can mostly just stand around with void sac bubble on them and wait for the warrior to fall over and die. You'll notice that the dueling tournament rules allow for warrior to start the game off with a free charge because they basically have no chance otherwise.
---
I lucked out and had a 60 rogue give me 40g towards my mount. Said he gave to me it to me since we were both dagger rogues.
---
BRD is almost always camped BY alliance anytime I go there.
---
I completely disagree with this approach. I mean, don't train talents you won't use, but the idea that you wouldn't upgrade core spells/talents is ridiculous to me. Nerfing yourself for 5-10 levels just for a mount seems pointless.
---
No, PvP server
---
I rolled on Deviate Delight, and honestly some of the most fun I've had playing is just sitting around a fire in Ironforge telling stories, chatting, and whatnot.
---
Dreadmist server? Got the same message todayüò¨
---
I've put about three epics on the AH since release as bid-only.
---
Each time, I get whispers trying to low ball my auction, despite it obviously having higher bids on it.
---
I don't understand it either.
---
"I'll give you 200g right now for it." (Auction is currently at 225g.)
---
If I had to guess, these are children who don't have enough gold, who think they can ask me for it instead.
---
Nobody cares. Start a new character to play with your friend.
---
Yhea that one.
---
I just found him annoying af the 2 times i watched it.
---
Anyway that game wanst that bad and i felt all the time that spending money or not wouldnt make a difference apart from crystals. Those odds are ficking horrible
---
Yeah brilliant would be the last word I would use to describe someone who would do that. Slow seems a bit more apt.
---
Worlds first?
---
For a PvE server it's preferable to have a 90%+ faction imbalance. And even on PvP servers players could prefer imbalance one way or another. 
---
Now in BfA they tried to fix the issue of server imbalance with the introduction of Warmode, but it turns out there is an intently unbalanced interest in PvP between the factions which starts a snowball effect that inevitably results in even more imbalance. 
---
The only real fix would be to get rid of faction and realm restrictions.
---
Please go away, no one wants your terrible ideas here.
---
Alliance on Herod isnt even that bad lmao

On my quest for the dal‚Äôrends mainhand, I have killed jed and rend 27 times.  I‚Äôve seen the reed TWICE and the mainhand ZERO times.

&gt; Why would anyone take that transfer?

To get away from queue times like they‚Äôve done in the past.

Heck a lot of horde are talking about leaving Herod because asmon rolled an alt here.

Lol that lock is bad. Didn‚Äôt open with a fear = easy mode to get to him.

Yes, but people typically play normally, and not by spinning their mouse 24/7. Also, the spy addon catches people hiding or on the other side of walls, inside of houses etc, people you cannot see at all.

Jesus, nobody has given you an answer yet? It's not supposed to be there so you need to open a GM trouble ticket in the help menu then tell them you still have realm names in chat.

unless your faction is fucked that is.
---
no reason not to xfer if you were alliance on say skeram
---
It's something like mid +50s to +80 something

Stands for "what the hell does iirc means?"
---
Honest question, and my opinion is this is getting out of hand.
---
Yep, been like that for 15 years.
---
I thought that smorc guild was over there? Maybe I‚Äôm mistaken.  
---
Too many streamers to keep up with the fanbases tbh.
---
It does not, shows up as strange gestures
---
Repetitive, over-emoted, and completely unskilled at the game. Imagine a 4 year old incessantly gibbering away. Just hours upon hours of this:  
---
They can't kill me they can't kill me they can't kill me I'm unkillable and they can't kill me because I can't be killed because they can't kill me because I'm unkillable because I can't be killed. They can't kill me they can't kill me they can't kill me I'm unkillable and they can't kill me because I can't be killed because they can't kill me because I'm unkillable because I can't be killed.
---
\\\*dies\*  
---
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT? They killed me? Guys. I died. They killed me guys. I'm dead, guys. I'm dead because they killed me. They killed me and I died and now I'm dead. I'm dead and no longer alive. I died guys. Guys. I'm dead. I'm dead, guys. I got killed.

And the whole time his stupid, ugly face is plastered on everything and he's making those retarded hyper-exaggerated faces.
---
If you watch his Orgrimmar raid video, the first 10 minutes of it are just permutations of "heals on me."
---
I guess for a motivated raid. If my raids go too long I get cranky ;)

Okay... Which zone was this quest in? You know... For research purposes.
---
The problem with the internet is language isnt strictly text based; body language and tone matter.

I've definitely read comments that I thought were sarcastic, and they werent.

Nope, happened on a PvP server

32 as well.. haha...
---
I gotta just grind out dungeons I think.. Im pretty sure thats the way to go.. Just keep grinding gnomergon and scarlet monastery..
---
Never said witchblade was bad, those mp5 ones are. There‚Äôs an equivalent, which is the unholy scepter from baron rivendare which has been out for two months.
---
I found a speedrun of Legend of Zelda video and that was fascinating. There‚Äôs apparently an entire community around speedrunning that one game. The record is a bit over 28 minutes.

Who's combat log are they in?! They're afking on flight paths, they literally cannot do anything.

LOL nice work!

I got a short ban for my guild Come Honor Face at the start of TBC. Oh well

I love how he abandons each comment thread when he gets proven wrong.

They found a way to get it back up and running recently. New version of it available

i didn't say or imply any of that lmao what

Jump onto the tram,  hit some dwarf quests; it's still a grind but some variations will help.

Haha make sure to go feral and get the movement speed increase for cat form. Get car form and stay in that. I believe you only have claw and RIP right now so just spam claw. 
---
You don't get a stealth opener till 32 so just stealth up and use a shred for now. It will get slower till you hit 32 but then you get access to ferocious bite and ravage.
---
Put on as much strength/stam and agil gear as possible.
---
Try not to shift too much since its mana intensive, atleast until you get furor and a wolfshead helm.
---
Aww, lame. I'm all for being clever and flipping auctions for profit, but I think being deliberately deceitful is kind of weak.
---
Understatement of all time
---
It's done on purpose to a certain extent, because unlike retail, questing alone is not sufficient xp gain to level properly. So those gather x from mob quests are really there to help you grind extra xp.
---
STV should really be done in 3 parts - low 30's, mid-30's, and low 40's - so you could certainly get a start there until you feel outlevelled.
---
I'm also interested to hear how your friends are handling this as well.
---
So cringy.
---
That and people don‚Äôt even try to haggle. Trying to sell something a little more than it‚Äôs worth and instead of counter offering they just go, ‚Äúoh that‚Äôs too much sorry‚Äù smh
---
Fair warning, it might be too close to Camp M, also, it is the back door into DM-E.  It doesn't see a ton of traffic, but you may see a few people coming and going that accidentally ruin your fun.
---
I hope you are playing dumb, because if not, wow.
---
Grinding mobs has ways been what classic levelling is about, quests simply serve to give you direction and are just there as a distraction. If that's a problem for you or your levelling partner then you just need to accept the game isn't for you as there's no way to circumvent that you are grinding mobs to level.
---
As you're duo levelling, a way to keep it more interesting is to kill more enemies at once, and if there are none around for your quest just pull enemies that you don't even need.
---

There is already such feature on the main page. You can switch between eu and us realms.
---
It's been a pretty even split on my realm, some ppl are rather generous, some want gold for 6 slot bags
---
You have no idea whether they're AFK. They can swap out equipment, some of that could end up in the combat log (buffs/debuffs). Or, look at my edit. Someone else mousing over him is enough.

&gt;Murlocs should stay true to vanilla, and as such only have the options of warrior and shaman

There are mage murlocs that use frostbolt, and even oracles use holy magic.

I'm Horde lvling in STV and I just wave at at Alliance a lot of the time. Seems to throw people off.

Unbreakable Warlord Shaman was one of my mentors growing up and inspired me to make this.

I‚Äôm positive that there are Murlocs that are ‚Äúhunters‚Äù and they have a crab pet. Go to westfall. Stopped reading when I came to this inaccuracy.
---
Yeah tf
---
On my server deviate fish are 15-20 silver each(after cooking them). I ran a circuit between the pools in the barrens and got 20-30g an hour. Not great for a lvl 60 but for levels 20-40 its pretty good.
---
I haven't tanked Rag yet, but I don't think I've ever held aggro after a knockback, unless I'm against a walk. If I have a lot of air time, the target is usually hitting someone else by the time I land. It sucks, and I wonder if it's some Classic mechanic.
---
&gt;can we please ban phone "screenshots"
---
Oh mylanta why do you care SO MUCH
---
Auction house add-ons make people incredibly stupid. People let the add-on tell them the price of rare items instead of actually thinking critically about what the item should be worth. The add-ons only tell you what items are listed for, not what people are willing to pay for them. 
---
I've been trying to buy an Energy Cloak for 2 weeks now, but the prices that people are listing them for is really unreasonable. It's a level 34 Cloak that gives 10 spirit with a 1hr cooldown that's basically like a weak mana potion. It's been listed over and over by the same people for 12-18g, and they never sell, but when I message these people directly with an offer, they always quote the data from the add-ons. 
---
It's clearly not worth that amount. First of all, who are you going to find in the mid 30s that has enough disposable cash to pay a ~15 gold premium over a green cloak with the same stats, just for a relatively weak cooldown ability. But the add-on tells them it's worth that, because the same idiots keep listing it at that price without it ever selling, so to the idiot it looks like the price is stable at that amount.
---
The days Stitches in StormWind... fun times
---
So, you're China
---
They mean cheaper for themselves since there is no AH fee, lol.
---
Imagine making a guild just to spell Murloc wrong
---
Way better that some random PUG gets 3 pieces and is never seen again right?  
---
Also, you don't understand the rules I laid out - 1 item PER RAID, so next week you are free to roll on anything again.
---
Ok sure but you kind of changed from your original argument. My argument is there are many weapons in the game better than the one mentioned in OP (including Witchblade). You came in to defend the antithesis which is that the epic dagger mentioned in OP is good - when it's not.
---
Questing will always be faster but since you are healing I guess you could join those weird cleave groups haha
---
Elemental is definitely faster at 40+.
---
Your right and wrong in my experience. I agree you have to penny pinch to make mount by 40, but depending on your play style it‚Äôs very easy to make almost that every level or two after that just with casual questing and grinding, the quest and mob rewards (specifically ah and grey/green weapons) go up significantly.
---
Just my experience anyway
---
Don't have that feeling. It's a more chill server for sure but there's a lot of people in capital cities and it's pretty easy to find a group for anything at peak times.
---
Judging by the LFG channel most are busy running Maraudon and BRD with plenty of high level dungeons as well. DM is ofcourse very popular right now.
---
I'm level 43 and there's plenty of action around me at all times everywhere I go. As for starting zones I really have little idea but everytime I fly through Elwynn or Dun Morogh there seems to be some general chat going.
---
Only worried about very long term for the server. I know back in vanilla RPPVP was pretty big at the beginning and went medium quite fast and stayed there.
---
the only thing i don't like about that statement is it implies that a roll for crit is done after the attack is determined to hit which is not true. but  the phrase ends up being kinda correct anyway. 
---
a d100 is rolled to figure out what type of attack lands.  lets assume someone with no +hit and 30% crit and 300 wpn skill and dual wielding
---
1-40  glancing blows
---
41-69 miss
---
70-75.5 dodge
---
75.51-100 crit
---
that shows you only actually crit with white attacks 24.5% of the time even though you have 30% crit.  boosting your hit rating would end up allowing you to take advantage of your full crit chance in this case being extremely valuable. 
---
so its a true statement just not in the way most people think
---
Wait you can get the quest mob even if they tag it first?
---
Yeah right. I stopped buying spells at level 35 so I could buy my mount. Had a lot of people die in dungeons because of my weaker healing spells
---
Wife went to the library in DM north at 59.  Could NOT start the quest.  There is a silver exclamation mark there at 58.
---
He'll need gold for more than mount.
---
This is how I picture all alliance. Always fighting below their weight class, and congratulating themselves afterwards.
---
If you need different NamePlates, definitely check out NeatPlates. It's got a lot of skins out of the box and is very straight forward - I like the 'Quatre' preset a lot.
---
There are a lot of UI WeakAuras. 'Huds' are really common which is usually all your class specific cooldowns/resources/health/swingtimer/etc in a small package that you can park somewhere on your screen.
---
You just copy the text (WeakAuras are just a huge batch of text) and paste it into the WeakAura 'Import' field. When you have WeakAuras open, it will show all your weakauras on screen (even if they'd be currently hidden) and you can then resize/move them.
---
 [https://wago.io/classic-weakauras](https://wago.io/classic-weakauras) 
---
There's a site for browsing WeakAuras. Sorting by 'Views' will give you the most popular ones.
---
Because it's a pvp server and horde have better racials for pvp. With the transfers opening up the imbalance has been getting worse because alliance players leave and horde stay.
---
FYI it ports you to stormwind because that's where your hearth is located.
---
Don't waste your time, my wife could not start this as a 59 ally mage.
---
Dr Disrespect is an entertainer that plays an asshole. Asmongold is just an asshole. He might entertain people by being an asshole, but that is not the same thing.
---
Not straying at all, it procs like crazy and is much more beneficial than the two mp5 items you listed.
---
There's a difference between playing MMORPG and being a basement dweller who has nothing else to do.
---
You can call other players losers / nerds / whatever you want.
---
There's clearly a ton of players with too much time on their hands and/or toxic people who are super sad in real life.  For the most part I let them go because it's all they have, in their sad pathetic life.  At this point, it's been proven true.
---
that guy who wrote " u r gay" feeds his ego because he's unfulfilled in his real life.
---
&gt;Been leveling my warrior in Furry
---
Shave him
---
Elemental is only slightly faster than enhancement. The time you save on killing mobs is spent drinking tea/juice/milk/water.
---
So for solo leveling don't bother, unless you have a mage that will give you 6-8 stacks of water every play session.
---
For dungeons, elemental is better because you can off-spec heal and chain lightning spam when the group aoes. 
---
Either way shamans are welcome just because of totems, even if their dps is mediocre in most scenarios.
---
MS&gt; OS, 1 tier piece and 1 non-tier piece limit per raid. If its a guild run, guild normally gets mats and recipes with RL rolling 1-40 on random greens and giving it to that number raider. Sometimes one off scenarios come up, guildie 1 in class A has received 6 pieces in 3 runs and another guildie 2 in class A has received 0. Whisper guildie 1 before next run and ask if he minds if the next piece goes to guildie 2. Most people will be fine with that. However, never alter the rules on the spot. That is the quickest way to lose multiple guild members
---
EDIT: Loot council only works if you are a hardcore guild and have dedicated guild members. It's extremely difficult to replace guild members at 60 so you want to keep everyone you can.
---
2 available server moves OFF OF kromcrush? what? Im CONSTANTLY looking for groups.. blizzard is fucking retarded..

How is a level 59 wearing helm of might? Am I missing something here?

I had an under-level feral druid heal my SM armory with no clothes on and it only went nominally slower than with a real healer.
---
*Epic monks chanting*
---
That‚Äôs it! Thanks
---
you have no reason to, barrens is perfectly capable of giving you everything you need to hit 25 comfortably
---
the alliance are FORCED to redridge. without going there we would have to travel to 2 other far away zones and miss out on the 2 primary dungeon quests for the level 18 ish range. furthermore doing so would only get us to around level 19 which would STILL force us into a pvp zone after already gimping us
---
so yes i make perfect sense. go play an alliance character to level 25 if for some reason you think i'm lying to you
---
The prices for most fish on my server (Pagle) is trash. You can get a little gold for Grilled Squid and Nighfin. I've been seeing stacks of Nightfin going for about 5 gold, and stacks of squid for a couple gold.
---
Please.  Murloc.  No I.
---
I figures as much but thank you for confirming.
---
You can click on the 3 dots and "I'm not interested in this channel". Still had to blacklist like 4 or 5 channels this way.
---
What are the must have addons for:
---
- paladin blessings tracking

- exp per hour tracking
---
- bis armor and gear tracking

Many are worth MUCH more as vendor trash than the shards are worth, too.
---
Fairbanks is pretty perfect. Leave it the fuck alone Blizz.
---
It was an option for Skeram too so it got slammed with alliance refugees
---
Bet you get that a lot
---
naw ur wrong
---
It would be far too strong to give murlocs access to a third or fourth class though. Gotta stick to just two.
---
Not even /dance??

Why are you so dumb?

&gt; It's a druid who flew past me on a flight path (I know, **because I targeted her and the portrait was blue).**

Best: Barrens. Lots of quests, no ganking, very large with multiple areas for the kill quests so you weren't competing for mobs often. Also Barrens chat is always entertaining.
---
Worst: Hillsbrad. Fucking hell, I'd often log in already dead from a 60 hunter one shotting me when I loaded in. Anything involving the farm was like pulling teeth, there's so many tryhard AoE mages there (I am a mage too, but man there's no way you're leveling even remotely quick when you're competing against 15-20 other mages there for pulls, not to mention the constant ganking). To do the quests there I had to log in at 4am to get my stupid peasant kills and I still got camped. The Yeti cave is just hell no. The yetis suck, they're frost resistant, and there's almost always a 60 opposite faction ganking at any given time. The quests aren't even grouped nicely, you have to go to the farm, then back to Tarren Mill, back to the farm, back to Tarren Mill, back to the fucking farm, back again to Tarren Mill, etc. You can't just have all the Battle of Hillsbrad quests at once and get it all done in one nice teeth pulling trip to the goddamn farm.
---
Edit: Just want to add, fuck the farm
---
I'm in Discord with people I know.  Why would I turn them off in favor of listening to some random dude, who apparently can't eat his cold pop tarts quietly by the way, tell me how I should be tanking my 83rd BRD run?
---
Just drop your HoJ already!
---
Textures too textureus?

My favorite unique guild name is "Steady Balding" and we didn't even get to use it. My friend named our guild after a dumb meme and now there's only 3 of us left out of the 8 that started.
---

From time to time I cut through Hillsbrad to see if low 30s wars need help killing Cyclonian. Sending a 31 war into the world with a lvl 40 equiv weapon is always a good feeling.
---
World of Walking.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôve been a main tank since vanilla, and I‚Äôve known these guys just as long. We stopped playing together for years and I went and did cutting edge mythic raiding and they just kinda dicked around and pvped. I can mark things all I want, they just attack whatever they feel like. It‚Äôs one of those situations where if I really dont like it, I just shouldn‚Äôt play with them
---
i dont even need a carry but getting a BFD group seems pretty hard :C seems like everyone is busy on their mains

Is the classic.wow-head guide on BIS gear for mages a good source, or are there better ones out there? I noticed it seems to focus exclusively on Frost mages, but I do like that it always has a pre-raid BIS list across all Phases. As raiding drops are weekly RNG it's nice to have a list of options I can acquire outside of raiding.
---
I did this run on one server and never aggroed a croc. I though "wow this is so much easier than I remember. I must've been really stupid as a kid". Then I did the run again on another server and died 10+ times...
---
You get a bunch of warriors or mages and gather up the whole dungeon and aoe and repeat. Really retarded in my opinion but it does have faster xp/hr compared to questing if done right.
---
Too bad you don‚Äôt have glaives
---
I wouldn‚Äôt consider joining an MC pug that had a loot council system as you described. Why? Every guild player who can will roll on every item just so a guild player gets it. The winner of the roll should get the item if they pass, the number 2 roll player gets it. This limits how much collusion a guild can do to ensure an item stays in the guild. Loot council is a bad idea if you have any PUGs. 
---
Loot council is more work than you think. Who are part of the council? Do the members change each week? Is the council bound by any guidelines (can the council give a thunderfury to a hunter or a dagger to a sword rogue)? And loot council can slow down your clears if the process is not expedient. Plus you can get a lot of drama if a few of your players get preferential loot. 
---
A main spec roll system with off spec if no main spec wants it is best for guild run pug raids. When you run it wholly in house, a EP/GP, DKP, or Suicide Kings system are all better than loot council for most guilds (unless you are too world caliber where loot council is appropriate). A touch of loot council for main tank gear may be acceptable.
---
I've noticed something similar on my warlock with the shield from sacrificing void walker. Sometimes I can channel aoe/bandage/etc
---
Sometimes I can't. Quite strange
---
Healing was not really a thing in Disgaea anyway and certainly not by the point you were using ninjas.
---
Neither Blacksmithing or Leatherworking are particularly good moneymakers, so whichever one you drop won't be directly supported by the remaining profession. The top moneymaking professions are probably Enchanting and Alchemy, I'd go with Alchemy as the more profitable if that's your goal.
---
Here‚Äôs how it works: RNG plus hundreds of thousands of samples occurring every minute from which you pick a few that are coincidentally similar
---
They're not hers.. but they're REAL!
---
Black Mageweave of course.
---
The option is to roll a bear, lol.
---
&gt; but it is a cast and so resets your swing timer.
---
Can you expand on this? I've used just about every other skill, a "cast" as you've called it, and not had my swing timer reset. Rend, shouts, thunderclap, etc
---
Wait. Do you mean cast, as in it has a cast-bar? Does any cast-bar skill reset your weapon timer?
---
Dude thank you so much I would never have known about this.
---
At work is the perfect place to watch Office Space!
---
This is a grinding game. Don't focus on the quest items, just grind the mobs you need for a half hour and you probably are done, and if not you get to kill some more. Quests are a cheap way to distract you from the grind. Don't do every single quest you come across. The majority of quests are not as effective as just grinding nonstop, it just helps to break up the monotony. The vast majority of exp earned is from killing things, even if you are questing. Stop focusing on getting quest items faster and focus on killing more things faster.
---
Nice reply! I see being asked to back up your BS has you running away like a coward. Im guess you play horde as well?

scroll down is ss, scroll up is snd

Beefy melee. Looks like you‚Äôre going dwarf male warrior my friend. What type of end game experience are you looking for? High aggression? Sit back and wait? Will help me with further recommendations.
---
My biggest piece of advice: invest in fishing. Not only will it help you level cooking which is great, but a lot of pet types eat fish.
---
Oh no I meant something about the event happening right now. I don't see any evidence that we even have the event except for OP's screenshot.
---
I'm a mage but you are severly underestimating the time I spend drinking.  Sure I get free Mana drinks but sometimes I have to use two drinks to top off. 
---
Soooo much time drinking.
---
And..... also increases your damage mitigation and threat generation? I see a lot of people complaining about tanks that die or cant keep threat
---
I understand your situation, and so do you. Problematic stuff.
---
A video of one shooting some low lvl players how original. Be more impressed if they where equal lvl.
---
Do you just stroll into a dungeon group gathering everything in sight until someone says something though? Common courtesy is to at least ask if anyone else is herbalist as well and work out looting from there.
---
This mage was clearly just an asshole, but I would be kinda upset if someone in my group was just casually scooping up every herb they came across without asking if anyone else was eligible to grab them.
---
I feel the same way as you. Although I am not lvl 60 yet, I do feel that Kirtonos is fine. Are there better servers? Sure. Does it seem to have more Horde than Aliiance? Sometimes yes it does. Is Kirtonos so bad that as Alliance you can't do anything? Not from my experience.
---
I didn't think this was gonna happen, my favorite novelty time!
---
I agree the in game community is great. 
---
The majority of people here are or at least think they are the top players of the progressive scene. They shoot down anything that is not an optimal build saying it‚Äôs worthless. 
---
Simple fact is unless you are going for a timed clear no content right now needs an optimal group dynamic.
---
I want to know if it's possible to level as a boomkin Druid. I am totally fine with drinking after a pull or something (I do it as a fire mage too), and I would like to heal as well in dungeons. I tried to level as a feral Druid, but I found the play style boring (I much prefer ranged). If I were to roll boomkin, should I be using leather gear only, or snatching some cloth pieces here and there for the int/spirit?
---
Happy to hear that Skeram Horde are in agreement on the issue
---
I miss /ruffle was my favorite BM.
---
Just so you know...Impale prot isn‚Äôt worth speccing into unless you‚Äôre above ~20% base crit. There‚Äôs ~4.8% crit suppression against bosses due to their level and increased dodge/parry chance which pushes some of your crit off the attack table. It ends up being a 1-3% difference in overall damage output, which is hard to justify over getting imp taunt and associated nifty tools. 11/5/35 (deep prot) is usually preferred at this time with shitty gear. 
---
Also, fury prot is completely a waste at this content tier, as it requires more gear than we currently have access to for flurry uptime and rage generation to surpass deep prot for tps. It works fine, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but it‚Äôs not really any better for raid tanking. If you haven‚Äôt played warrior without tactical mastery, I‚Äôm warning you it feels like shit to play. 
---
On the flip side, fury prot is def better if you‚Äôre still farming in open world content, but for that you‚Äôre better off as arms pvp (31/20) spec anyway. And arms is kinda better for dungeon tanking as well. 
---
Tldr: play whatever spec you want, but furyprot and impale prot both need more specific and better gear than you likely have/have access to at this time. Deep prot is better if you‚Äôre raid tanking; arms pvp is better for open world and dungeon tanking
---
35 is the important level to get max professions for the 3 and 4 day CD's.
---
Maybe they are just leveling to twink at 39?
---
No. At best, the quest NPCs for that quest are racist. And in a world at war where factions are race limited, all of this makes sense.
---
\&gt;  *they don't watch their healer's mana*

I'm just reading this now cause I just heard of this whole concept but yeah dude what the fuck.. What is with these people? I'm only level 32 or so in classic right now, but all I do is heal.. I do instances all the time.. Deadmines I've gone through like 5 or 6 times, Gnomergon like 3 times now, Stockades a couple times, Scarlet Monastery... These tanks.. ALWAYS THE TANKS.... I'm sitting there at less than 100 mana, just clicked to sit down and drink, and they're already pulling a whole group.. and part of the group is missing health still.. Every god damn time.. It's ridiculous..
---
You‚Äôll have boars, bears, and troggs!
---
BECAUSE it's 2019. it's easier to post from your phone.
---
Even if youre hoarding for a mount, you still have expenses. You might not be dropping 300 gold on a boe epic but youre still paying repair bills, regeants, consumables, professions etc.
---
Right now, seems to be 2h+, lock I bought it from said it just stays till instance reset.
---
For mostly PVP you‚Äôll most likely not enjoy moonkin as their kit leaves a lot to be desired. Druid is really only need in BGs for flag carrying, but random queues you‚Äôll be ok.
---
idk but im glad he didnt cause imagining two businessmen approaching another on the street, having this exact dialgue, and then walking away with a strut is comedy gold.
---
in my head this played out like a monty python sketch

Can you get the tribute buffs while in a raid group?
---
Horde need to be purged before they can reach my level
---
Just horde, plox-n-tankx.
---
Ive leveled from 29 to 38 in just SM.
---
I‚Äôm still only sitting at ~40g, most of my greens don‚Äôt sell for more than 10-15s over vendor, and the only BoE I‚Äôve won is Scarlet Chest, which won‚Äôt sell even after 10/15/20g undercutting.
---
Also leaves quests for level 60 to make gold
---
I'm a rogue (44 atm) and love it, cant wait for 60. Rogue dps is crazy good in raids and really fun in pvp. Only downside is competition for gear and unless you're in a raiding guild it may be a bit harder to get into raids since you dont really bring much to the party other than your dmg and rogue spots get filled quick. 
---
I plan on doing both pve and pvp at 60 and I'm not worried about it. I love being a stealthy assassin
---
Block them when they pop up?
---
I love tanking but most these dungens are new to me.  I just ask or we find out together where good pulls are.  Sometimes that doesn't work out.
---
Prebis guides are all Frost because no one is going to be doing PvE as fire when MC and BWL have fire immune enemies. 
---
Icy veins is nice because it gives multiple options (2nd best, 3rd best) so you can keep an eye out.
---
In general all of these guides are hastily put together to have been first published and get all the traffic from google... they are good for rough guides but not a substitute for learning your stat priorities.
---
Automation is coming to WoW
---
Trolls are probably the best race for tanking, berserk is great. Good choice üòÉ
---
Then every race currently in classic is too op. Your logic is full of holes just like your suggestion.
---
I just looted a nice dagger and a blue ring that seems amazing in stonetalon and ashenvale respectively. However prices seems very low at the ah atm. When can I expect the prices for twink equip to go up? Should I wait?
---
Edit: [Thunderbrow ring](https://classicdb.ch/?item=13097)
---
i was extremely charitable in the beginning. Giving away greens if they were upgrades to someone, bags and my time to help them.
---
And really all it did was get me broke unable to afford skills, or be broke after mandatory skills payed for
---
Real MVP here guys
---
Even if they are popular it's still a nice little chuckle when you come across someone of the opposite faction with a similar name. It's not just two popular guild names, it's two similar popular guild names. I've also never seen either of these.
---
Hmm.. Maybe... shit does drop thats nice so that actually might be more my style.. I'm used to grinding
---
Yes, as in it has a cast bar.
---
That's what I'm saying. You have to understand the context.
---
Even in your example 1000 DPS is not 1000 DPS from auto attacks.
---
This is against TOS anyway. It‚Äôs that simple.
---
It's kind of hilarious that you're being a snob and actually wrong even about the econ 101 shit. 
---
Worth is subjective, value is objective. 
---
You have this totally backwards. Stop being a dick.
---
I think it depends on the server, everyone is always listing fish as a great AH item but on the server I play on it goes for barely over vendor prices.
---
It‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs just not nearly what he used to. I was just saying that asmon is far more popular
---
It removes all aspects of situational awareness, you just stare at a list
---
I soloed King Kukkla as a Hunter a few levels below him. There is a huge tree there that you can just run around with Aspect.
---
Under appreciated comment. *clap
---
It definitely was, our guild considered that mode/boss the "final encounter" of Ulda.
---
no offense but it took you this long to realize?
---
Everyone talking about hit gear makes me feel like I made a mistake in rolling gnome warrior.
---
I mainly did it for fun, I always thought the little guys tanking in plate armor was hilarious. I wasn't even sure at the time if I would stick around and reach 60.
---
I just dinged 59 last night, and would really like to raid tank, but am unsure how best to gear myself for such a thing.
---
Looking at [sixtyupgrades.com](https://sixtyupgrades.com), the only pre-raid plate hit gear that I can find brings me to 4%. These items are Battleborn Ambraces from Rend, Satyr's Bow from DM, Brigam Girdle from BRS, and the Blackstone Ring from Mara.
---
Do I have any other options? Am I going to have to get some Edgemasters in order to make up?
---
I'd really hate to swap to DPS. I've been leveling by tanking dungeons since Death Mines, and all the DPS pieces that I've picked up are sub-par. My tanking gear up until now is somewhat decent, and starting over on PrBis for DPS would be a nightmare.
---
This is a link to my current gear as it is.
---
[https://sixtyupgrades.com/set/3UXRBbLderDX2TKE4Uo5Hk](https://sixtyupgrades.com/set/3UXRBbLderDX2TKE4Uo5Hk)
---
You don't need group for that.
---
It didn't work properly on pservers
---
Tanking strat live and reserving 1st orb is a minimum of 25g per hour. Mages and hunters can generally farm about 50g per hour. Considering the 240 hours invested to level:
---
Solving 25X = 50(X - 240) tells us that you would break even at 480 hours (20 days /played) of purely gold farming. So if you need to farm 12,000 gold (not including the passive gold you get from just playing the game and looting), then it is worth it to level a farming alt. The overwhelming majority of players will not be spending 20 days /played farming gold, so it is not worth it for the overwhelming majority of players to level an alt purely to farm gold with.
---
My friend is in a guild who has that rule but they distribute the boe's after the raid, if u leave u lose ur chance to roll on it, and they reset all the rolls at either majordomo or ragnaros. Keeps all the pugs around until the end each time since even if they win a piece there is always a chance they win another if they stay to the end.
---
Same spot unless instance resets, in which case you zone in wherever you initially zoned into the dungeon.  You will only drop to the HS location if you try to log in and you exceed the lockout limit, but if you are trying to zone in from the portal it will just say you have hit the limit and wont let you enter.
---
oooh doubling down on cringe interesting strategy
---
No, not really. It would weird me out if i tanked for randoms and they called me Daddy.
---
If you stand next to me I'll /moan at you
---
Autodownvoted for being whiny about phone pics.
---
Also breaking bulk. Both value adds.
---
For melee classes I've found that macroing /startattack to everything is really nice for swapping targets without having to click.
---
One thing I would definitely suggest doing is setting up macros for your stances and setting those to a bind where you can easily reach without affecting your movement. I have mine set to my 3 side buttons on my mouse. 
---
Another helpful one is to put Hamstring onto your charge and intercept macros. Since you can't use Charge at close range or Hamstring at long range, it makes it intuitive to keep hitting the button as you charge/intercept in. 
---
Some people swear by macroing all their stance specific abilities to swap to the correct stance. I think this is a bit of a crutch, and that it's really not that tough to just bind the stance swaps and be smart about where everything is. For example, you can only use Revenge in Defensive, Whirlwind in Berserker, and Overpower in Battle, so all three of those abilities are bound to 3 in their respective stance bar. 
---
As for skills to buy for Arms leveling, make sure you keep up to date on Charge, Battle Shout, and Sunder Armor. For Rend, you want to keep up to date until 40. After that, you will primarily be using Whirlwind (lv 36) and Mortal Strike (31 pt Arms talent), and Rend is completely dropped from your rotation. Other than that, I think I mostly just grabbed the first level of skills and skipped them until I had more money, as they give very minor damage increases and mostly scale off of weapon damage.
---
One final piece of advice, use Sunder Armor instead of Heroic Strike as a rage dump while leveling. This may seem odd as HS has instant damage and SA is more of a passive effect, but HS eats your next white swing making its cost quite a bit higher than on the sheet.
---
*My Seal of Command*
---
*It is my favorite thing*
---
*Paladin-Windfury*
---
This has to be staged 100%
---
This is true. Did all brd other day and our priest was leader
---
I never give gold but I do give bags/low level gear when I come across them.
---
I'm still struggling to save gold for my mount. I'm still 48g short.
---
P3 if ever, which is at the very least 4 months from now. Twink items are a long bet though depending on your server pop, and gold inflation.
---
Thanks appreciate the offer but I dont want to risk not being able to pay it back for a loooong time :) honestly im hoping i can get 70 or 80 soon to give my lvling buddy as hea always lagging behind on foot while im running cheetah at 40%
---
I would do hillsbrad, nothing wrong with people a little over the level for the zone. As long as the quests/mobs aren't gray, just go clear it and it'll be quick and easy. You'll thank yourself later when you start your next zone a little bit higher level.
---
So does Alliance have their version of Barrens chat anywhere?
---
Are you Oceanic? It seems that Retail gets this event starting Oct. 18th and while I haven't heard anything from Blizz about Classic getting it, I wouldn't put it past them to just turn it on without any prior notice.
---
I'm wondering if OCE servers get it now since it's already the 18th for them, while the rest of us get it tomorrow?
---
Dropping skinning for blacksmith or engineering won't make you any money unless you get one of your server's first Lionheart Helm recipes.
---
Selling what you gather might be your best bet. Especially if you go for Devilsaurs or Arcane Crystals.
---
Alchemy would be good if you had herbalism.
---
As a member of Mankirk Horde, transfers off are idiotic. We could use more players on both sides, certainly not less. 
---
Are Blizzard trying to kill classic?
---
It's a case by case basis and this addon clearly hurts world pvp. There's no reason to use the terrain or look around you when you have a 24/7 radar on your screen.

---
grizzly and washed up collusion. great stuff.
---
It sounds like we agree, Asmon should have done this correctly, and because he didn't this happened. We can't fault one raider because he wanted a Rag weapon when the rules were "roll"...
---
Wait... are you on fairbanks? You gave my rogue that ench in stonetalon I think! Its not Agi but that bracer lasted me a long time.
---
You can get about 2 and a half stacks of Nightfin an hour, if fishing after midnight.  I was averaging 8 nightfin per 10 minute lure.  12g/hr for fishing isn't much for a 60 but at 35, that's a really good rate and levels your fishing at the same time.
---
I ruined a guys day doing that but he kept earthshocking all the buzzards in badlands so I had to get in his head.
---
You got me!! 
---
Wait... Is AR a Role Play server, because I can't stomach nekkid gnomes.  OMG you almost had me!  You trickster!!
---
Ele is way, way better. Just get a buncha basic int gear to get your Mana pool up, then you'll bee able to kill 4+ mobs without drinking. You kill speed should average 10-15 seconds depending on crits. 
---
Yes, you will need water, but you  need it anyways. Your hearth should be in Kargath, there's almost always mages  there selling water and ports.
---
Second this.
---
When does the event begin?
---
What? The video starts 10-15 seconds from where you enter after resetting with an alt?
---
Technically it‚Äôs PVP, however, I only get ganked maybe once a day so it‚Äôs more fun than boring PVE. I have no clue why you would play PVE if there was an option like Heartseeker.
---
in actual vanilla, there was a guy i'd see zipping around org all the time. never ran a pug with him but i always got a chuckle while AH'ing if I saw *EmperazizzlePalpatrizzle* zoom past. ,aybe it was just palpatrizzle, it was a long time ago.
---
A few things.
---
Sustained DPS is literally the answer to SL tanking, particularly when combined with an interrupt rotation and a sunder or two. Remember, you cant peel a fury warrior with fear.
---
Fury chews through bubbles far more efficiently than arms (multiple quick swings, 50-70% of fury dps is autoattacks, extremely fast rage gen once its down)
---
Warlock HP evaporates once a fury warrior lands that first crit and starts to flurry off - even the stam stackers.
---
And finally, a warlock denying charge is pretty meaningless. The warr will bloodrage intercept - you denied 15 whole rage. This isn't the mage matchup where intercept has to be kept for punishing blink, once a warrior is on a lock hes on it till one of them dies. Coil doesn't make you run far.
---
I fought a lot of SL tank locks in vanilla and while it was the hardest lock fight, the ones who thought standing there saccing voids and stuttering drain was enough were never a challenge.
---
Same boat. Mining has been pretty good money while leveling but skinning has been atrocious. Skins are going for vendor prices on AH and are worth less than grey loot of the beasts. I wish there was a better way to level mining/herbing together and automatically cycle through the tracking for each.
---
Noobs, just feign death!   (/s)
---
Because they are annoying to look at? "Just don't look at it them." How am I supposed to magically know what an image is without seeing it first?
---
Only this comment. Nothing else.
---
Level 60 rogue here.
---
Run around Ironforge. Stand on bridge. Have people ask me to open lockboxes. Have people randomly open trade expecting me to just open it without so much as a hello. Run around Ironforge more. Go to BRD and steal from dwarves. Go to UBRS. My sword doesn't drop. Die inside a little more. Go to auction house and look up Krol Blades. Get depressed at how much people want for it. Look at my Thrash Blade and contemplate getting a dagger.
---
I'm a Warrior (37) and I have friends that are 44 (pally) and 45 (priest). They both want me to level quicker so I can raid/dungeon with them.
---
Is there a way they can like "power level" me? Like not join a party, but just follow me around while I pull large mobs of creeps and just heal me?
---
Yeah but murlocs get full swim speed AND can breathe underwater. You gotta limit them somehow, they're already the most chad race.
---
Came here to say paladins were 80s. Perfect.

I liked it, though I will also get downvoted

Postal recepticle: Bedazzled!
---
Idiotic....or ***GENIUS***?
---
I mean, seriously - bring your whole guild over.  We've got room for you.
---
We have a flood of people leveling fishing and cooking because they know how much boost they give.  So it's also less of a demand on the AH because people are doing it themselves.

Niceguy white knighting m'lady lmao

Who trains all of them?? There‚Äôs a ton of niche or useless stuff packed in there.

Lvl 60 tank here. Hadn‚Äôt done any of the dungeons before. Literally just said ‚Äúfirst time here, you‚Äôll have to guide me through‚Äù. This was met with a ‚Äúsure‚Äù or with no one batting an eye and following me wherever I went.

Games been out for 14 years man.

I highly doubt someone brand new would even appreciate what you wrote.

I did enjoy your comment, coming up on IF I did exactly that.

Yup and /u/exlqt's site just got hugged to death

WHERE IS MI MAMA

Is that when battlegrounds will be introduced?

Find a site where player statistics have been gathered. More mages, worse realm. More trolls, better realm.

I've heard there are some girls that will actually play wow WITH YOU.

Disgusting, a gnome mage!

Zebb, I don't think that's PC, buddy
---
Silk, I assume? 
---
Yeah, it's really dumb for him to expect to go from 37s to 39s. So you want to gain an extra 5% profit and cost me 66% of my end? "It's just 2 silver." Good luck with that.
---
That's how we reset dungeons in original WoW.
---
Yeah, I haven't noticed any pushback other than Rain of Fire and Hellfire. Bandages get cancelled sometimes. I probably have a much smaller sample than you though since my sacrifice-and-then-AOE moments are far between. If I remember I will try to test it out a little tonight.
---
The problem is that some of those people go out of their way to insist everyone play the game the same way as them
---
Obviously not everyone does so, but it‚Äôs pretty tiring to keep getting asked why you aren‚Äôt 3-ticking every skill or care about ‚Äúnon meta‚Äù items

I went looking for kites on her, but it looked like she didn't get her awesome moonfire aoe until Catacylsm's rework.

Duskwood has you running in literal circles around the zone.

I found it oddly...efficient.

You get 4 quests, do a lap around the zone, turn in, get 4 more quests, do another lap....
---
Uhm.. if you are ally just buy the Big Iron Fishing Pole of ah ( +20 fishing) and if you are horde just get extreme angler pole (+25 fishing) so horde or ally it's more or less the same ^^,
---
Doing fine work there, Keep it up!
---
Seen a few people with horde/alliance tattoos.
---
I avoid them at all costs.
---
The comment or above me is not very helpful. 
---
I‚Äôm currently leveling a warrior, and it is slow and grindy. If you‚Äôre leveling alone you will have to do one mob at a time and eat between pulls. Dungeons are easy, you can tank in arms or fury with a 2h so getting into a group won‚Äôt be a problem. You will almost likely be topping dps meters as well. Although it challenging, it‚Äôs a lot of fun. 
---
Rogue has many more evasive abilities and there is less downtime. The play style is very different from warrior. I haven‚Äôt played rogue in classic but friends are leveling them and it doesn‚Äôt seem as grindy as it is with a warrior. 
---
I can‚Äôt speak much for end game as I am only level 50 on my warrior. Hope it helps a bit with your decision!
---
I got to level 60 in 10 days while doing extremely inefficient quests and farming Broken Tooth + Tidal Charm, someone actually trying can do it much faster. Mages AoEing and spellcleaving, even faster.
---
If he's in it for the long run he'll need more gold. Orbs aren't 100% either. Rested alts makes it faster too.
---
Yes, since weapon speed is only adjusted in a later patch in BWL.
---
I had a guy once block me rather than tell me "nm no thanks". He told me he wanted the item i was selling. i told him okay ill meet you by the south elevator in Thunder Bluff. He replied "okay". 
---
Ten mins later i send him a message just to see if he was still coming and i get a "This player is ignoring you". 
---
Its like just tell me you are no longer interested. I'll understand and reply np and go about my day lol.
---
It's cool, not all ideas were accepted in their time. By naxx, I'm sure public opinion will have slowly shifted towards murloc love.
---
So, my experience is limited, but I leveled a Druid for a wee bit while it wasn‚Äôt super optimal.  I remember it being very frustrating.  I used cloth and leather, but was drinking after every pull.
---
I heard something about downranking Starfire for more optimal mana/damage, but a more experienced player can say more.  Just my 2 cents!
---
It's possible for it to either be shared to a lower level, or the mage I got it from got it from a different mage that had done it.
---
afk in org and say no to all the pugs who want me to tank their dungeons
---
I feel personally attacked.
---
I-I mean, I'm not ganking lowbies with a WF Nagle fishing pole...I swear. Must have been some other Tauren.
---
If you aren't pickpocketing your %t for 76 silver, are you even trying?

(Sometimes you get someone who falls for it and they follow you around hitting trade to get you to return it)

I named mine "Sumeragi" after the alcoholic tactician from 00 Gundam.
---
Go to Darkshore, you can hit 20 from the whole place if you go there at 13ish and it's not as monotonous as Westfall
---
Yeah its important to note that i have no experience as a fury warrior and that any and all macros they use are beyond me. These are only the ones i use as a arms or prot warrior
---
Hearthing for milk and repairs. Don't know if I'm coming back.

can you please elaborate so i can do it better for the next video?

---
I raid 2/31/18 for 3% hit buff I really like it what most bis/60s I think are playing atm but be in mind you‚Äôre cap is 9% hit
---
This is pretty much how I leveled ench too. If it was orange or yellow and I had the mats you'd get it for free.
---
Mage gave me water? Have a free ench.
---
Help me with a quest? Have a free ench. 
---
Someone is afk in a dungeon? Free enchants for everyone not afk.
---
Actually I really like the pop size on AR, you can all stay where you are. Yeah, The economy might be a bit weak, and selling shit sucks sometimes. 
---
That said, if your horde transfer away, I need more people to farm for honor next phase.
---
The problem is the add-on is really harmful to world pvp. There's no point of using the terrain or any need for situational awareness when you have a radar on your screen 24/7. I understand why people want it to be a thing but why roll on a pvp server if that's your attitude?
---
A lot of them are geared out
---
They should have stopped at Roy Rogers
---
Saving up for devilsaur gear when I get 60
---
Indeed. Plus there are a lot of quests there that lead to BB.
---
Not only was it on the top 25 it was like startlingly high, like top 7 or something like that.
---
Better start researching for a new video card boi.
---
More for me, I think changing locations and moving on to lower level quests helps because you'll still get full exp for the quest, the mobs are easier to hack through (solo or grouped) and you get a change of scenery.
---
Shields are a lifesaver. Wearing one nearly doubles your armor and with so much of your damage coming from spells and totems, dropping down to 1h doesn't hurt your output as much as it would a warrior.
---
Worst: Stone talon mountains.
---
Best: Un‚ÄôGoro Crater
---
No it‚Äôs a big daddy PvP server
---
yes you are right, 3 manning is probably the best option unless you have crazy gear
---
I actually had an undead rogue that helped me with the BFD part of my level 20 paladin quest.  Other horde were ganking but he just helped me kill elite mobs I was trying to solo.
---
I was amazed.
---
But why is it that he gets attacked for it? He has regulated his viewers. He can‚Äôt control all of them, and the ones who go out and act retarded are the ones he denounces. He shouldn‚Äôt be responsible for his followers who go against even what he says.  This happens a lot in other communities, and even happens in more major factions, like in politics.
---
Obviously Asmongold is worthy of some criticism, but I feel most of the community criticizes him for the wrong things, and start circlejerking each other just to share their opinion that they dislike him, therefore he is a bad person.

mainly I fish wreckages in tanaris, turn all of the bolts of cloth into bags and sell them on the AH. Whenever Mooncloth is off CD I'll make a Mooncloth bag (~4g to buy two felcloth, turn to mooncloth, make a bag, profit 20g). I sell the leather and usually vendor the greens from the wreckages. Snagging the Runecloth Bag recipe from Qia in Winterspring is also about 50g profit but the vendor is camped super hard.

Level 60 Warrior.
---
I made lots of friends while I leveled up, since, being a warrior, I can't do anything by myself. So I Jump on and whisper my buddies whats on our agenda tonight. Live strath, Dire Maul, help guildies with attunements. Maybe grab a few peeps and farm Eko's. When no one else is on, I can go mine RTV or Dual box with my wife's priest and run ZF for pretty decent gph.
---
Lvl 60 hunter. Log in, afk in org. Think wow I'm bored, head over to mara to farm gold. 10 mins in, wow this is really boring. Log off and go level my alt.
---
Edit: Not saying hunter is a bad class. Just don't expect 10 whispers an hour from people asking you to run their dungeon, like a warrior or something.

/cast [@mouseover,exists,nodead][] Dispel

The second empty [] makes the spell behave like a normal skill, as condition brackets are evaluated from left to right.  So if the mouseover exists and isnt dead, it'll mouseover, otherwise it'll default cast.

You can extrapolate this to other skills as well.  You can also use help/harm in place of exists if you want to limit the spell use against friendly or enemy targets.

Faction change came in WoD

Twink items will go up in price when people focus on twinking, and a lot of people will still be focusing on their mains, as people still have BiS lists to complete. I'd exepect Phase 3 to be the "Twink" phase, or just prior to it, because battlegrounds will be released, and that is the easiest way to PvP meaningfully as a twink. 
---
So, in a few months, sell it if you want maximum value.
---
I find it so strange that Classic WoW's primary audience is like 30+ years old but the impression I get from so many people is that they were too nervous to attempt their first load of laundry until just 6 months ago for fear of messing up, and even when they did it, they didn't search for instructions themselves, instead they had mom come over and show them for the first load.

Very interesting threat the BiS list shows the bow being better... not sure what gives there. Thanks for the tip!
---
Ah... yeah on the horde side it does, OP is alliance though and it's usually several runs through the first part of BRD to do that part of the quest chain.  Horde still has other quests in BRD though.

As a horde priest who has spent the last day chillin in Darnassus, you‚Äôre not kidding ha.   I can just hang out and avoid aggroing guards, not an Allie in sight

A while back got ganked (ambush 1 shot) on the redridge bridge by a skull undead rogue with a similar name. Was not even the least surprised lol
---
Use thrash blade+vanquishers sword until 58ish, then replace vanq with mirah's song.
---
Don't use the dalrends at all until you have both. Thrash blade and mirah's are both individually better than a single dalrends.

Are you dual wield? Shamans do much better with a slow 2 hander! Staves usually have the highest dps/low and top end base damage/ slow swing speeds! Getting wind fury procs on a 2 hander is a lot of damage
---
 Edit: found out enhance doesn‚Äôt get DW
---
I am not in a high-end raiding guild or anything, but I have found the DPS from DS/Ruin to be very good.
---
Glad it helped someone :)  
---
The amount of forums I had to go through that had the issue 'SOLVED!' and left with no solution was enough to drive me mad.
---
The community is definitely ‚Äúmodernized‚Äù when you get to 40 and above. This game is quickly becoming a retail community with classic gameplay, especially at 60.

Healer solo play in Classic is non-existent. You just can't be heal speced and kill mobs quickly. It's pretty terrible.
---
From the run, he got 2 greens vendoring for ~4g, the run has 2x Gromsblood and 2x Dreamfoil nodes guaranteed, potentially +1 Gromsblood and 2 Ghost Mushrooms. He also got a Felcloth, a stack of runecloth, a gold or two in pure silver and some vendorables
---
Groms/Dreamfoil are ~60s/ea averaging 4 of each, Ghost Mushroom ~1g, Felcloth ~4g, Runecloth stack ~1.2g + ~2g +~2g vendorables
---
14-15g/run or 70g hr.
---
Probably how he calculated it.
---
Flamelash - Alliance guild
---
I linked him the source callback registration and function and to the COMBAT_LOG_EVENT docs proving its the combat log already. If that doesn't show him then nothing will.
---
I'll be taking a 57/58 to tribute later today, gear is bad, but group should be able to carry him, will be on voice comms and group is aware of low level, will post results later. 
---
I was able to get him a tarnished elven ring, plate bracer and mail chest from a tribute chest thanks to guildies, a stockade pauldron for next to nothing and those tanking plate gloves (stone something) hopefully it helps mitigate damage slightly. 
---
The OP could be 60 by now too haha
---
It's just some Javascript code with set intervals that infinitely loop
---
Once you get hit/crit no. 
---
Where you're fighting higher level stuff it can be better. You get more hits which means more rage/threat and less mobs running around once you miss and DPS starts hitting. 
---
Dungeons aren't made to be DPS/tank/heal checks. You're fine doing either build.
---
You haven't lived life until you done a line of dream dust off a gnome hooker's ass.
---
wars are more 80s rock - guns n roses, led zep, ac/dc
---
Huh. People were entirely peaceful when I quested in Shimmering Flats. I killed one guy and then felt bad, because he barely fought back and there was no attempt at retaliation, no other pvp, nothing. People just wanted to kill some turtles.
---
I had a random level 60 run past me in feralas, save me from some bears and give me 40g for my mount. I'd say it's pretty accurate.
---
good bis lists show the alternative top 2 items if theres stuff that's similar in power

---
I got for 50g, message the sellers and they'll usually be happy to help if you're not reselling and there's multiple listings up, the listing fee kills it.
---
The fact that we are so beaten down and pathetic as a community that we are looking at ways we could give Blizzard more money is sad.
---
We should have an attitude about this.  OP doesn't have any self respect.
---
That would be best if you can afford the respec later.
---
/cheer will audibly say "For the Horde" as Horde, but doesn't say it in chat, though I don't know if its always that line or a bunch of randoms.  
---
I also don't know if its the same for Alliance scum.
---
I should have just rolled alliance then.  But the friends wanted horde.  I think stalagg is more like 70 30 but no way to know I guess.
---
But finding alliance in the wild is like finding a unicorn.  Contrasted to when I was leveling, was getting pissed about huge parties of alliance and everyone horde was like just layer hop.
---
I might have to go to a pve server, as much as i love outdoor pvp there is nothing fun about a 4v1 or a dungeon entrance being camped non stop
---
It's obviously DM.
---
That does not work, because if you have no mouseover there is no behavior in that macro to follow.
---
If you want to test, add a first line #showtooltip, and make sure the icon is the default red question mark.  And then test by wiggling your mouse over and off of mouseover targets.  The spell icon should only show up when you have a mouseover, and this tells you that the macro doesn't recognize a behavior for non-mouseover.
---
This is what you want to use, for the behavior you want:
---
You can replace exists with help/harm to restrict by enemies or allies.  The second [] is an empty condition and makes the spell behave like normal if the first [] block fails (in this case, if you have no mouseover, it'll default cast).
---
gotcha forgot they are completely different attunements
---
Or just use "you", that way everyone nearby thinks you directed the emote at them :p
---
As a dude with a 41 main, yes please.
---
Classic and deal with it in many different ways. I'm not sure if this is actually an issue or not but you seem to be trying to make it into a really big one.
---
Lizard to just re-release the expansions that's always an answer he could also go the classic plus fruit and create new raids for you to do and tune them wherever they want.
---
I think people tend to forget the blizzard is Blizzard and they only game so they could still do whatever the fuck they want. It's not going to be a problem because they are going to think of a solution.
---
I played a Shadow Priest since classic launch.  It's really fun in groups and leveling, and works really well if you have a partner to level with.  But you have zero Area of Effect spells, and you'll be constantly running oom very quickly.
---
In raids most guilds only take one (if any) for the Shadow Weaving buff.  Raid bosses have 16 debuff limit, and they often won't want you putting a dot up on the target taking up one of those spots.  Your Mind Blast has extremely high threat, and can also be problematic (though not always) on fights like Onyxia.  
---
Your damage is also not on par with Rogues, Warriors or Mages, or even Warlocks.  To keep up with the damage you can do you'll have to chug mana pots every two minutes.

No dual wield in classic for shammys, that BC sadly
---
That scene was so chilling...after he passed the exit, she knew what was going down
---
Can someone explain to me why 1000g+ should go to the tank. its a BoE item that dropped for the group. you could for example sell it and buy devilsaur and enchant all your gear. seems to me its just 1000gold any member of the group can use?
---
People get mad over some weird things in this game. I was clearing a camp on my paladin. Chest spawned about halfway through clearing a 7 mob camp. Some dude runs up, clicks the chest, aggros the 3 remaining mobs, runs away and dies somewhere. Meanwhile I see him trying to ninja the chest so I take it while he's aggroed the mobs, and then peel a mob off him. He got mad at me for ninja looting his chest.
---
I dont think shamans can dual wield in classic
---
Yeah, totally. I‚Äôve yet to respec yet too, should be okay.
---
As a fellow altholic, I understand where you‚Äôre coming from. Just waiting for the day I play a class enough to say ‚Äúthis is home‚Äù lol.
---
Enhancement shaman are underwhelming*
---
I‚Äôm an alliance transfer from Skeram to Heartseeker during the last transfer. I‚Äôm lvl 60 now and me and a buddy got ganked last night by five horde in an open world cave. Horde you are free to gank all you want on Heartseeker and we won‚Äôt complain at all but welcome the challenge. The cool part is that we don‚Äôt attack first cause we know you are outnumbered, coming from a server where we know what is is like to be outnumbered. Just reroll horde there and don‚Äôt look back!
---
There is no dual wield in vanilla. It‚Äôs 2 hand or MH + shield/offhand statstick
---
May have been a rude way to say it, but he's not wrong. If you are complaining about the grind at level 11, you aren't going to enjoy this game.
---
A few of our tanks are Fury prot now, and I will say, they do alot more DPS than the full prot ones, so there is that added benefit.
---
Yeah, I'm on Atiesh and I feel like we're too **under**populated. The posts I've seen here on the sub about how the world feels alive and there's so many people around and competing for mobs and I'm just over here like, hey, this spawn rate and mob distribution is way too much for one person questing in the area. Someone come over here and thin the herd ~~for~~with me!
---
I‚Äôm not sure I understand this one. You get them to buy it and then ignore them when they want to sell it to you?
---
I targetted her off of spy, holy crap you're dumb
---
get Gag Classic and you can add music and sound clips too it ;)
---
I detest STV. It's like a mall at Christmas. I went to Kalmador and did a lot of "go find xxxx" quests and opened up a bunch of zones and got FP's. Got to Shimmering Flats, which have a lot of BB lead ins. About 36 in Desolace now but I have lots of places to go if I get bored.
---
Don't neglect getting the Ashara FP. Just trust me on this.
---
Ah shit that's ezpz. Haha I didn't even think to just inspect it!

And beer.  I've actually coded between spawns as well... While drinking...

Drop skinning unless you have devilsaur farm down pat.  Pick up herbs.
---
You can't ban this addon since it just scans your combat log. I don't use it since it feels cheap.
---
Until he teleports to you...
---
Not playing mage so I will get requests to tank dungeons, rather I think it's a good change in playstyle from hunter. That and lots of opportunities to farm gold/run low lvl friends through dungeons.
---
Part of the quest requires Elementium Bars. The ore and the smelting skill for them both come out of BWL.
---
They're meh in dungeons too but I mean people so dungeons in greens so do what you like.
---
I think its even more silly than that. You don't need pre-raid BIS to clear MC. Even a half decent guild can clear MC with a mix match of leveling greens and blues. 
---
People are applying retail mythic raiding mindsets to content that was never created to be even remotely as demanding gear wise.
---
Awesome! This is great!
---
I give away my bags as I upgrade to larger ones.  I just go find a low level in a city with no guild and just open trade lol

If I'm remembering correctly, I'm pretty sure you could sell the stuff out of the chest in Molten Core right? Why would this chest be any different?

Looking for suggestion on an alt.  My main goal is to have something desirable/helpful for PVE but I expect I'd *mostly* use it for PVP.  Main is a warlock and I'm hoping to press to 60 in the next week or so and get started on an alt.
---
My considerations:
---
* **Druid** 
---
   * I'd 100% go HOTW spec.  Flexibility looks really helpful for PVE side to help guildies do runs and stuff as either tank or healer but PVP on it looks iffy to me.   Not sure I have the awareness to capitalize on the vast toolkit that druid has so I expect it'd be lackluster in my hands on that front.  Lack of normal rez on PVE side sucks.  If TBC were ever announced I'd probably switch to this as my main.
---
* **Shaman** 
---
   * Probably level enhance to spice up my caster life but at 60 I expect I'd go 30/0/21 most likely.  Ele shaman looks like a ton of fun and healing could be a fun way to be useful for filling raid or dungeon gaps as needed and is something I can't do on lock. 
---
* **Warrior** 
---
   * Currently have one level 23 already so wouldn't be starting from scratch which is a bonus.  They look like hella fun in PVP of course and the ability to tank my way to 60 and at 60 is useful the whole time, though I suspect I'd stay arms full time even at 60.  I used to love tanking in TBC and Wrath because I could control the pace but I've never played a warrior.  Only class I'm considering with absolutely no mobility boost which was bad enough the first time around, lol. 
---
* **Hunter** 
---
   * PVP looks like a ton of fun, particularly wPVP.  I'm used to having a pet but having one that actually feels like it is helping would be a nice change for leveling.  Also it'd be a great extra farming toon.  Only blow to this one is that it doesn't offer much in the way of extra utility since it's another DPS only class like my lock.
---
lol just park a character at level 40 and panhandle for gold in cities - send all proceeds to your main
---
Gatorbite is way worse than both weapons from the last boss of Ulda, and the hammer from Princess.
---
The only reason to take it over those 3 is if you have some moral objection to using anything but an axe.
---
Sorry Sir!
---
That‚Äôs just like, your opinion, man.
---
Overly reactionary people who get angry at something at the drop of a hat are assholes? Who knew?
---
Alliance, dwarf. I started off as Disc and I just felt like I wasn't killing anything fast. Just went shadow at 30, but I feel like I kill stuff faster.
---
Level 59 and below players in MC lmao.. go run BRD or something
---
NPC smells so bad even the mailbox is trying to run
---
Yea the reason is that it only solves the problem on the current server and creates one on the destination server.
---
If a server is 75/25 for one faction and you only open up transfers for the higher pop faction, guess what the new server is? 100-0.
---
The problem is not a server problem, it's a faction problem. More people play horde on pvp servers than play alliance (and vice versa for pve servers). The racials and shaman/paladin disparity greatly influence this and there is no way to fix it in vanilla/classic.
---
edit - best solution IMO is to allow free faction transfers on a server while that server has a great imbalance. I'm not convinced many would take that option though. Still pretty certain these server transfers have everything to do with removing the last layers than anything else. They don't seem concerned with faction imbalances.

Plus you can just post the image with your phone which is a lot easier.

Report for politics
---
I do almost this. 1-5, Q, E, R, F, V, C, X, and 2nd panel is the same + shift. Mount is on mouse button 5. I usually do 1 for initiation ability (charge, taunt), 2 is nuke ability on cd (Mortal, Bloodthurst, Mind Flay, etc.), 3 for instants (OP, WW, SWP), 4 spammable (Sunder) or just some usual rotation ability, 5 aoe, Q movement ability (like blink) or spammable, E for CC, F for interrupt, R for big damage (Execute), C for escapes (Sprint, fear bomb), V for damage cooldowns, X for big cooldowns (Shied wall). Racial is on Shift-V, shoot on shift-Q. Shift-E for grenades or bandages. 
---
I play this way since 2010-ish. Muscle memory has developed, so I don't memorise abilities really.
---
well shit
---
I mean, you're too dumb to know what the print screen key does, so maybe the Chinese gold seller thinks you'll be stupid enough to RMT.
---
I love to drink and drive (my toon). It‚Äôs nice when tanking a dungeon. If the healers drinking, so am I.
---
Boo no more politics

idk farm the carrion birds I guess?

I thought they already put you into attack mode?  Or was that a latter retail addition?
---
All this fun community and love shit stops around level 34ish, and its back to being a dick to everyone you pass, just like retail.
---
Dungeons are always good, lots of drops and some things start selling for close to 1g~ at your level.
---
Quest/Quest Rewards at this point can provide some decent gold, make sure to install the VendorPrice addon so if there's ever a set of rewards that you don't want, you can always choose the one that vendors for the most.
---
Professions are great, Mining/Herbalism/Skinning can all be used to increase your income  
---
STV is fantastic for killing things like gorillas and they commonly drop grey items worth 10s+, they can be skinned for bonus loot  
---
Other than that, just find an area with humanoids about 2~ levels below you and get to farming.
---
Glad I'm not the one taking crazy pills, I figured it was pretty straight forward lol.

Can someone explain why the moonkin in MC last night chain casted moon fire is that really their rotation?
---
Stalagg or i think skeram are the worst, they are skewed very, very heavily to horde.  I think Herod might get worse with all these transfers though.
---
I would recommend, changing some of the dialectics you have surrounding gear. Gear is gear. Some pieces are better for tanking, some pieces better for dps. Lets take "Truestrike Shoulders" from first boss of UBRS, 2% vhsnce to hit as well as +24 attack power. They're leather, so that immediately suggests "not for tanks". Well, as a tank, you must trust your healer will be able to keep you alive, so if you have that trust, you will be able to forego some mitigation stats in favor of stats that increase your threat generation and damage output.  Additionally, the faster a mob dies, the less damage you will take over all. 1 mob that hits for 250 every 2 seconds and dying in 20 seconds dishes out 2500 damage over the course of its life. A mob that deals 230 every 2 seconds and dies in 30 seconds dishes out 3450 damage over the course of its life. 
---
I hope that illustrates the importance of looking at these stats and items objectively... a strong offense is a good defense!
---
Mailbox looks like a junior staff officer that deployed and never left the fob so had all day write himself awards...
---
The issue is starting attack when you don‚Äôt have the rage/energy to use the skill
---
This must not even be a comprehensive list - it doesn't have a /talk.
---
Someone hit me with that the other day when I was ganking him - "Hordeguy wants to talk it over with you" - I was shocked. In 15 years I've never seen that one.

If you have no one selected it instead says "You talk to yourself, because no one else seems interested."

rage pooling is good. 
---
i don‚Äôt know if thunderclap is worthwhile? i sometimes do: charge, sweeping strikes, whirlwind, def stance, etc
---
or maybe: charge, sweeping strikes, def stance, cleave, etc
---
OP: in many cases you can‚Äôt charge because there are multiple groups of monsters close to each other, who will all aggro on you if you charge. In that case you should pull one group by shooting them with your bow. So then it is even more important to have pooled some rage like this guy says. I think that most of the time you have to pull this way, so charging is the exception rather than the rule.
---
Is there a reason Moss Agate price is through the roof at the moment? going for 8G a piece on my sever....
---
I always ask someone to guide/gps me when it is my first time tanking a dungeon. Also doesn‚Äôt hurt to say it before you start the dungeon so people can let you know about how to pull/ any special mechanics that you need to know
---
You can jump in the water and stay on the side of the boat. This way you will stick to it when it starts to move and you also get tranferred just like you would standin in the boat. Saved me from many ganks and you should try it!:)
---
Scream "FOR THE ALLIANCE!".
---
Neither faction can help themselves with a response.
---
Note: You cannot say "FOR THE HORDE!" because any alliance will immediately assume they're gonna get 5v1'd IRL if they counter.

the tanks are already geared and/or have no reason to pug, especially in this environment handling a quel-serrar drop would be insanity.
---
60 tanks could also be levelling an alt capable of easily farming gold at this stage and are in raid-logging mode
---
you are gonna be stuck with the alt undergeared tanks, or the geared tanks who just like grinding and are on more often than not. however the grinders are going to do shit like reserve the rich nodes
---
I'm sorry, Daddy
---
Great for mightfish? Its not worth jack tho?

yea pretty much, just fight through it because it's easier to make gold at the much higher levels

I don't know the realms well enough to know the answer, but is it possible to transfer from a pve realm to a PvP or a rppvp realm? Or will my character be doomed to a normal server forever?
---
I felr the same with the mighty "MORTAL STRIKE", and it was just an expensive ability thst barely hit more than an autoattack.
---
They could attempt this but people are not robots. The majority of the player base has a strong attraction to one faction or another for a variety of reasons. I specifically picked horde for classic before any other decision was made because I played alliance in vanilla and I wanted to do the opposite. If horde was simply disabled at creation I'm not sure what I would have done.

5% crit chance is worth a lot less than a weapon that has 10% higher base damage.

I did some of the BB quests from Shimmering Flats, just to have a taste of STV. But I am not going to fight over tigers like seagulls over a french fry. After a while I go back to Kalmador and do some stuff there, which on my server is pretty quiet. Plus a lot of the quests there seem designed to return to later, like much of the Theramore stuff

Unless it‚Äôs to a percent where it can be easily proc‚Äôd and clip the previous buff that would definitely lead to less over all dps unless the other talent option is so incredibly close that the minor chance to clip is a bigger detriment than just taking the other talent.

I‚Äôd grind out some caves in arathi highland for a little bit, auctioning every ore, vendoring all whites, and auctioning the greens. Probably make 10g in an hour or 2.
---
Because the Ashenvale one is the closest to a major city, vs. going alllll the way to silithus just to avoid a 1-2 min horsey ride
---
Every single "farming spot" is listed across hundreds of guides already.
---
Telling people "ohh don't talk about that so that people don't know about it" is pointless. The game is 15 years old. Every single farming spot is known and documented in tons of guides that are a google search away.
---
My troll mage doesn't know how to feel about this comment.
---
I do and it's wrong 99% of the time. Just because some idiot has something on the AH for 200g doesn't mean it's worth that
---
Yeah that‚Äôs not what was in his initial comment lmfao. So funny all the kiddos jump on the bandwagon. Initial comment was 1 item per class until everyone gets a piece of loot which insinuates that if each mage(for example) doesn‚Äôt get an item that raid then the next raid the mages who did get items cant roll until the other mages get at least one piece. So the wording was fucked to begin with. Keep up.
---
It is based off weapon damage, so of course it's going to be underwhelming at 40.  As you get a better weapon it becomes more viable mana wise, can proc flurry/wf and gives the increased nature damage which synergizes well with imp LS / improved shocks.
---
Theres definitely no denying that 40-48 as enhancement is painful and ele outperforms it easily.  Not having a good weapon is what cripples the build for this period of time.  Once you get into Mara though, there's some great drops and specifically weapons that make you hit like a truck again.
---
They cost 20s to even throw out. 
---
But fine by me, no skin off my back. Enjoy the run:)
---
To list something on the auction houses, you pay a listing fee. The faction AHs also take 5% of the final sale price. The listing fee is based on the item's vendor value and never changes.
---
When you take inflation into account, the list fees become less relevant over time. I was talking about the fixed listing fees, and not the AH's 5% cut.
---
4% is fine to start tanking/OT in MC. You'll eventually get Might Gauntlets, Onyxia neck, mail bracers from Domo chest &amp; band of accuria from rag. 
---
Have you done the Hinterlands Elite quest for the 1% green hit trinket? Also, the blue mail boots from Scholo has 1% hit on them https://classic.wowhead.com/item=14616/bloodmail-boots
---
I think I abandon more quests than I complete. Bring a goblin some spider eggs? Welp, that quest is terrifying and impossible...
---
Dwarven priests man, 90% of them want to gank....
---
Then find a different mage. Hes not offering services, people are randomly asking. Entitled shits everywhere
---
I've been getting some crit healthstones recently and I have no idea if thats how its supposed to work, but its pretty great
---
Set a DND message with the price and just ignore anyone unless they agree to your TOS lol
---
I'm a thrifty goblin. dont need to anymore.
---
A level 40 warrior whispered me (41 priest) asking if I could spare anything for his mount that he was 5g short. I had 8g left after just buying my mount and was like f it, here is 5g. Enjoy.
---
I didn't even bother with STV. Alterac is where it's at!
---
Not being the top 1% doesn't mean you were casual. Almost nobody played like this. Even some of the better guilds weren't fully optimized to today's average standards, so idk what game u guys played back then. Are we really going to sit here and say people were the same, yet at the same time the old records are shattered effortlessly?
---
yeah I know I was saying that sarcastically/tongue-in-cheek
---
going from 1-40 isn't exactly easy, I don't know who in their right mind would spend that much time leveling a character for such a dumb purpose
---
Not all servers can transfer. even if you are listed there you can only transfer one way... so Pagel can transfer to Azuresong or one of the others, but not the other way.
---
There is a 1% hit trinket from hinterlands elite troll quest you could use that too
---
But then we don't get that sweet 12 added DPS from the rogue with his bow that he's never used
---
That server is dead
---
Stormstrike is meant for ‚Äúburst‚Äù damage. It‚Äôs amazing when you actually get a WF proc off, and you get a little boost to your earth shock if you‚Äôre trying to finish someone off. But usually you get almost nothing from it while costing a decent amount of mana.
---
I sent someone an offer through mail, time to see if they accepted.
---
edit: Nope guess not
---
Your race ultimately doesn't matter unless you're in a super hardcore min/maxing guild.
---
It's also not a big deal that you don't get your hit cap, obviously you will focus in getting as close to 9% as possible, but you can still tank just fine without it. 
---
DM Tribute gives a ring with 15 agi and 1% hit, which could easily replace Nagelring. Agi is great because it's armor, crit and dodge as well. If you have enough money, you could get a Lionheart helm for an extra 2% hit and crit. That gives you 7% hit. Lucifron will give you T1 gloves for an extra % and Onyxia head quest for the 1% hit/1%crit neck and you're capped.
---
E : Should have clarified that you should focus on threat generation more than you should on capping your defense stat. Decent healers should have no trouble healing you through MC regardless of your defense skill level.
---
Well then why are you bitching if you are gonna tank? Step up to the plate then. 
---
My dungeon groups can cleave, but if they felt ENtITLED to cleaving and bitching about aggro? Leave in a heartbeat. Don‚Äôt have time to put up with entitled little shits when I am trying to enjoy myself.
---
On my server, the tank‚Äôs word is law. And I know I can get away with whatever I want but to me it‚Äôs about the common courtesy. I‚Äôm only telling people stuff is reserved because I feel like it‚Äôs better than ignoring them outright when they whisper me. (Which is ironic because I‚Äôve got more /ignores being straight up with people than otherwise) I‚Äôll still take people who roll against me for bis, it‚Äôs not like I never do. But when you‚Äôre several days into farming for a specific item, only to watch countless others get the item instead of you, your patience wears thin. Hell I‚Äôve lost a bis 2H to a resto specced shaman before. But outside of that, if you wanna hit another couple bosses that I don‚Äôt need, no problem. At the end of the day it‚Äôs about more than me, and I know that.
---
Horde only iirc.
---
Deviate delights is 55/45 ally I believe
---
No they have prices lol. Just high ones.
---
put on a bunch at 2g a piece, why not try and see what happens eh.
---
Yes, this has happened to me several times, ALWAYS on mind flay. I supported multiple bug reports and I haven't seen any update/blue post concerning this though.
---
The two things I notice are;
---
1. When shield is up, I can receive spell pushback while actively casting mind flay (I have not been able to recreate this with any other spell as of yet and it is EXTREMELY inconsistent)
---
2. Wanding gets some kind of latency delay, even with a shield. I am waiting between 1-3 seconds for my wand to "charge back up" and shoot, entirely missing a wand animation and damage. This isn't constant, but I've definitely encountered it several times, as recently as last night in a dungeon. I'll shoot 10 times fine, then I have a SOLID 2-3 second break between my next animation (and my addon shows it going past the 1.4s timer) and a proper "shoot" with received damage. Its not a resist, but I literally lose the animation and the damage before it "resets" back to normal.
---
We're far away enough to not that happen
---
Are you a warrior....?
---
1. It's not off the combat log, as my screen shot proves. I've already responded to like 10 comments identical to that one, so it's funny you thought that when I didn't respond to #11 (and wasn't on reddit in general, which you could've seen if you clicked my profile), you assumed that I was dodging. Big brain time.
---
2. Ok? I don't know what LFG addon that is, I'm sure there are multiple. I'm talking specifically about an LFG addon that Blizzard themselves said they were shutting down.
---
Dustwallow Marsh has the "automatic dismount" bridge that fell into the creek.
---
Hillsbrad Foothills has the greatest number of auto-run Alliance.
---
And you can't throw a rock in The Hinterlands without hitting a wolf.
---
&gt; like they‚Äôve done in the past.
---
Has there ever been a one faction only transfer? TIL
---
I know this tool already exists in some other places, but I enjoyed making it and comparing it to real life logs.  I also found it to be useful for me personally to exist in Excel.
---
It is verified for healing touch and rejuvenation but I am still struggling a bit with the exact +healing coefficients for regrowth, so my calculation there is close but unconfirmed.
---
Feel free to download, copy, share, and especially let me know if any errors are found!
---
Not sure how you can tell that lol, but it's fine. I'm planning to respec at 40 for shadowform. Decided to go with extra survivability with improved shield and fortitude until then. Unfortunately after that I kinda don't have anywhere good to put talent points until I respec lol
---
This guy knows what is up.
---
I want to transfer from Blaumeux and Incendius to Earthfury. I should have been more clear. These are on the list of available transfer realms.
---
Gnome jelly bellies is the best thing here.
---
Did you know it doesn‚Äôt take 10 healers to keep 1 tank up lmao.
---
If you‚Äôre dying instantly all your gear is broke.
---
My favorite guild name from vanilla was "hotshot laserguns pew pew" I really wanted to join that guild but they didn't invite anyone
---
Ew, you play a gnome?
---
i guess its nice to give a pug 1000g. The thing is, I buy the bis pieces so if they drop with you guys logic I can't roll on them. needing on rare 3g items to DE is a diffrent scenario wouldn't you agree?
---
Haha! That‚Äôs the best way to do it.
---
I play the game the way I want. And when people expect things from me I dont do it because I have pride. If I dont want to make water and food and your going to complain about it.... I'm fucking glad I didn't make you shit.
---
And warlocks don't give me a hearthstone every instance. /s
---
Also you sound like a warrior who . . . doesn't use mana.
---
If it's that big a deal, never run with a mage who doesn't give you water. Leave the group and form a new one.
---
I'm leveling four at a time. Can't even bank correctly.
---
triple it's actual price obviously
---
Exactly! Once you get inside the instance portal the whole run should take less than 10 minutes if you only use 1 invis pot.
---
You never loot your corpses, when you‚Äôre sittin there in combat
---
There‚Äôll be time enough for lootin, when the rollins done
---
Westfall is PVE and most of the horde problem exists on PVP servers. As a member of the horde on Westfall though, I would not hate if they allowed horde from pvp servers to transfer here. But I am generally against transfers and I'm not very happy they even allowed them this early (let alone the ones before). Transfers have historically caused more problems than good every time they are put into this game - I was hoping they would hold out until p3 but it's clear this is the solution they have to getting rid of the last layers.
---
No you can't. What happened to me was I used the horn, he spawned, and the hunter stole the kill. My horn disappeared and I got no credit. I had to abandon the quest and go get it again from XR
---
Blauneux is the most balanced server lol
---
Sometimes things spike in prices because of people buying them out, last week Fused Wiring was 50s-2g on my server, two days ago they were selling for 8g+.
---
I checked this morning and they were down to about 2g~ again, but it seems like some people buy out massive amounts of items and just resell them at a massive markup knowing that desperate people will buy from them if they're the only ones with the supply. 
---
Try check again later because Moss Agates really shouldn't be going for more than like 40s.
---
im sure there are people who didnt know what rppvp meant on launch and wanna leave
---
They give the water to everybody except you? I feel like you're leaving something out
---
Why waste the mats?
---
That's okay, I have other reasons for transferring off Blaumeux.
---
Nah he just means kill it so the hunter cant tame it
---
If it wouldn‚Äôt cause a gigantic shitstorm, I would support consolidating realms.
---

Try [this](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25114-modui.html).

Shit dude, my bad. I didn‚Äôt realize it was your first time on the internet.
---
That was an example of an exaggeration. When I said immediately, I meant in a very expedited manner. It does not literally happen instantly. 
---
Let me know if I need to explain any more words for you.
---
Knowing reddit, a lot of those posts are probably fake karma grabs.
---
I swear they designed both Desolace and STV to maximize the "I can't fucking WAIT to get my god damn mount!" desire.
---
Except I *do* have an idea - I have played PvP games for the last two decades.  This is no different from any other large scale open ended PvP where you have to rustle together more manpower than the other side.
---
Sandbox and survival games have this kind of conflict on the regular.  If it's against the ToS, the company(in this case Blizz) will deal with it, if it's not then it's just a part of the emergent gameplay.  
---
Losing a resource war to a more populous and better organized group in an online pvp game should not be a gigantic shock to anyone.
---
A nice Night Elf gave me an 8 slot bag and a parrot.
---
It's almost like 1000g and 2g aren't comparable. There is no doubt that what you did was nice. In fact, it was so nice, that you essentially gave the tank 200g, as did the other 3 party members.
---
Definitely not 70+ g/hr, clickbait title
---
As BM your sole purpose is sustain/soloing, so taking talents to make your pet stronger (until certain gear levels, I imagine) are generally preferred. If you‚Äôre going dps you‚Äôll just spec MM in which case you‚Äôll probably take 5/5 in that talent.
---
Yea but it's not like the game doesn't exist before 60. In fact...there is an entire world to explore, why rush if you're having fun?
---
It's not a race and the mentality of *NEED TO GET 60 ZOMG ENDGAME ENDGAME* is how we got the instant lvl shitshow known as Retail.
---
Literally the last day I played on Retail... what do you even mean
---
5 damage on a speed 1.7 dagger is equivalent to 14*5/1.7=41 attack power. i guess that‚Äôs 40% crusader uptime, ignoring the heals. I don‚Äôt recall the crusader uptime? I think it‚Äôs close enough to 40% for a rogue that you can reasonably go with your personal preference there?
---
Why you need conjured water/food as a warrior in Dungeons?
---
I'm also curious what people are charging for crusader? I charge 50 gold about a week ago and everything seemed fine but now it seems like people are expecting to have it done for 5 gold. I just doesn't seem right to me
---
1. Would you care to point out in the source code it detects things without the combat logs.
---
2. That was classicLFG, which they never said they were going to shut down. You are referring to https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classiclfg-addon/263761/10?u=nukecrater-illidan which does not say they will shut down the add on.
---
Well, There's about 11 hours left to decide.  I think transfers close tonight.
---
Bring it up in your guild's discord and see if you can get them to come over.  Spam in LFG/Trade as well.  
---
Even if you bring over 300-1000 players, that's a lot.
---
I mentioned to a guildie that I was 50 gold short to be able to buy my mount right when I hit 40 (I'd used most of my gold to train LW 300 and tribal LW so I could make our two rogues devilsaur gear, it was coordinated)... She just sent it to me and said "enjoy your mount! :)"
---
game's good with friends.
---
Would be good to hear.  Dont want to mess up second choice like we did first. 
---
Wish blizzard could force all the alliance to return
---
That's his joke...
---
I love how many retards are falling for this
---
Truly a scourge for the living
---
As a mage it's one key..I mean jesus christ lol this is really about pride for you?
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/censusplusclassic
---
It‚Äôs like 7 minutes on an epic mount  both ways not including flying there and back. Just bad.
---
How do you know? ho right because you read the quests...
---
I'm just assuming it's a shitpost poking fun at people who act like they're entitled to other peoples' spells.
---
I had no issues leveling to 60 as full resto. I never had to grind and it took 14 days of played time. As full resto I have tanked everything outside of MC and Ony. Slow leveling as resto is a myth from vanilla from when you had to grind a few levels to hit 60.
---
I always stop, hit em with a /sigh, and wait for my death. It seems to take the fun out of ganking for some people if they don't get at least a struggle out of you. You just sit there lamely waiting for your death. Or maybe they get embarrassed that you survive long enough to stand there and /sigh and /tap while they attempt to kill you. Either way it seems to help on my warrior.
---
Hit compounds with other stats, crit compounds with other stats, etc.  That‚Äôs my point.
---
Also why I specifically said at the end ‚Äúeach stat contributes more DPS the more of each *other* stat that you have.‚Äù
---
can u answer me sweetie?
---
All of my characters share names with NPCs from EPL.
---
haven't gotten this....but i get a lot of invites to gold channels
---
I assume core leather gloves just for the stats? I can't imagine that's better than devilsaur set.
---
Then at least make it funny?
---
Yeah I mean it just was kinda pointless
---
at 45 thrash blade is better than bloodrazor. the dmg is basically equal but a much better proc.  the bleed from bloodrazor is awful as its 30 seconds and will break gouge and blind if you need to use it.
---
I had someone go out of their way to carry my lvl 30 Warrior through the entire Whirlwind Axe quest line, and they even gave me a few gold afterwards. 
---
There are some super nice people out there.

---
It's a sign they are going to significantly lower server caps. 
---
As in, right now it looks like they are running 2 layers of 4500 players each. If they dropped a layer and just made 4.5K the server cap then that would be a problem for a lot of realms that haven't seen a queue in a long time. 
---
We don't know what their plan is but it would explain why this is happening.
---
trash mh gut oh would be fine
---
Up and down the west coast of STV should have lots of pools. Firefin is really easy to farm in coastal Hillsbrad. Get ~3 stacks/hr.
---
&gt; Who's combat log are they in?!
---
Another user using Spy.  You have no idea what this addon actually does even though it's been explained to you a dozen times.
---
I‚Äôm definitely lacking in the pet area so that would be awesome. I‚Äôve never made a macro before so I really appreciate it.
---
I‚Äôve considered an ‚Äúoh shit, someone‚Äôs trying to gank me‚Äù one that would hit them with seduction/fear and all the dots.
---
You're mad.
---
These are great!
---
How do the bounties work?
---
Yeah, Eve Online had a similar scam.
---
You would set up a buy order using the margin order(which lets you set up an order to buy for more than you have, with the idea that you wouldn't have to keep relisting), then you remove the money from that character so they only ever are able to buy 1 of the item before they go in to a margin call.(order gets removed, character is penalized and has to pay back money for what he bought...but he never bought much to begin with)
---
this is cool
---
Immortal mobs in blasted lands.
---
Servant of ?????
---
Surprised no one has mentioned it yet, hunters are the easiest class to level weapons.
---
Spam rank 1 serpent sting for ranged weapons, or rank 1 wing clip for melee. You can do it on GCD, it costs very little mana, and it massively increases your attack speed.
---
Yep I'm level 29 on my first ever playthrough and fucking stoked about it. It's been a 5 week journey and I love every single level up.  It just takes time and j waste a lot of time figuring things out. I'm sure my alt will be easier to level but right now I'm just feeling out the game.
---
The elite devilsaurs that aren't always noticed until they're right on top of you.
---
What are you going to report? Hey blizzard I though this guy was an idiot and i could make easy gold off him but he tricked me !
---
Already have it since level 37..  
---
I also caught the [rarest owl](http://prntscr.com/pkrvfw) just because I like rare stuff, even if it doesn't look different than any other white owl :D
---
It's a sign they are going to significantly lower server caps.

/LFG Tank looking for group 
---
*30 whispers*
---
Good points all around, I'm definitely thinking of being more tank/healer and less dps.  Hoping to meet the bar for raid healing while still being a viable off tank / dungeon tank.  Though later on maybe I'll discover that cat dps has more of a chance to be useful than healer.
---
I think druids probably benefited the most from the BC dual spec system because of our flexibility.  :/
---
What‚Äôd they do wrong?
---
AH mat based fish, vendor food based fish (unless leveling cooking).
---
There are 3 spawns in DME for musty tomes in the large bottom courtyard area right? If not where? The one consistent one I've seen mentioned is the one by the roots on the east side but sometimes two on the west side as well?
---
What's the rate that you've personally seen actually spawning? 
---
I've seen a few videos notably https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RBsS1znR4 which has 2 spawns, one across the gap on the upper courtyard and one by Leth as well as the end.
---
Okay let me lay out the train of thought for you and where your disconnect seems to be then.
---
1. I'm pretty sure OP was asking, now deleted for some reason, something along the lines of how should he distribute loot because they are doing MC but will have PuG's etc. Mostly asking if he should LC it.
---
2. The comment you originally misunderstood stated a way to make it work for OP, a system that he thought could work ideally in that situation. Again with PuG's in mind.
---
3. You come in and completely ignore that #1 exists and decide that things are "hella" uncool if you don't get loot for 4 weeks in your hypothetical situation you just made up.
---
4. Everyone tells you to read better.
---
No
---
I've got a question; I'm fairly new to jump runs but was under the impression you don't kill the three plant packs around Alzzin, however the last few times I tried, all of them were pulled the moment the imps came out. Do you clear the plants or is there something I'm doing wrong? 
---
Atm we just clear the trash before taking out Alzzin.
---
You momster
---
Why wouldn‚Äôt you just play on a PvE server then?  Most of those are dramatically tilted in favor of alliance.
---
I tagged along on a stockades run that a guy was getting boosted through by a level 60 mage.
---
It was cut short due to a power cut on my street but when everything came back on I logged on, saw the mage was still on and explained what happened.
---
He then proceeded to find me, and trade me over 30g and four runecloth bags.
---
I still have no idea why. But it‚Äôs by far the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me in this game.
---
It sounds like some sort of peasantry.
---
Seal fate isn't nearly as good as it seems until you have REALLY good gear(Naxx). It's just not worth losing everything else you have to sacrifice for it.
---
None of those are level 50 dungeons. Scholo and strath I would say be 58 if not 60. Brd you can do a little earlier around 52 I think. Lbrs and Ubrs ide say 56-60. I‚Äôm not a tank though so I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs nuances I‚Äôm missing.
---
I usually just go by this list, keeping in mind that if your full party is on the lower end of the range you may not beat the final bosses of the dungeon https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Instances_by_level
---
got the same problems as you. ping is green or yellow for me and everything else  like browsing, youtube, etc. (except [battle.net](https://battle.net)) works fine tho.  
---
today its unplayable.. the only thing working is the chat ingame, cant even close the game without killing it in task manager
---
Why is it that people just don't use the screenshot button anymore?!
---
Pretty sure cross faction collusion is bannable. Don't know if anyone actually does get banned for it but I'm pretty sure it is against the rules.
---
If you know what you are doing as a guild you never have people die on shazz lol.
---
OP to Sock: HOW MUCH (meaning how much is the item)
---
Sock to OP: how many you got (meaning how much gold do you have)
---
OP to Sock: how much do you pay for one (meaning how much for one item)
---
Sock to OP: HOW MUCH YOU GOT (meaning how much gold do you have in caps)
---
OP to Sock: PER CRYSTAL (meaning how much for one crystal)
---
Sock to OP: cya (meaning bye)
---
OP to Sock: LATER (meaning cya later)
---
Sock was the seller, OP is the buyer.
---
Don't even get me started on the auto-attack with wands. I don't have the addon that you're talking about so I don't know exactly how bad it is, but there are times when I can't toggle off the wand and am forced into an additional shot unless I am actively moving because of the latency. I'm sure it was some shoddy code cuz I remember this back in Vanilla and "No Changes Even If It Was a Detriment to the Game"‚Ñ¢ 
---
Not trying to say it's a bad thing to have no changes, just hopefully they take the time and address these smaller gameplay changes other than just use the excuse to not touch the spaghetti code from 2005.
---
Anyway, that was a tangent.
---
I'm more or less curious to see if this is a native bug to Classic, or if this was happening in Vanilla. Could explain why they haven't responded if it was happening in Vanilla.
---
Heavy seconded
---
I love seeing little gnome rogues trying to stealth past me. I usually follow them and wave. Female gnome rogues with their little pew noises when they attack. /melt
---
The other friendly player gave away the players location that we watch in the video, to the enemy so that the enemy players could skin the Devilsaur without contest.
---
Old school Chris Metzen I think?
---
Beg in org unfortunately is the fastest way.
---
Yeah, I hear that. I originally leveled my alt to 35 to unlock artisan crafting skill on it and never intended to main it, but we had too many of my previous main and not enough of my alt so I switched.
---
I would love to raid but I don't even know if it's possible.
---
I'm kinda dreading end game b/c there's no way I'm staying up till 12:00 AM to get some purple gear.
---
Trolls are not diverse.
---
Male - long tusk - green or white mohawk.
---
Female - all this.
---
It used to be a thing, it's really not anymore because every weeb and his mom plays a female character
---
My guess how he knew is that the spell you have keybinded to V unlocks in the discipline tree, most people get this talent very late or after respeccing at 60 so you having it early hints at a discipline leveling spec
---
Thick sells well since there's plenty of fairly cheap items you can make with it that are good. And, depending on price, a good way to make AFK gold crafting with intent to vendor. (Its worth more profit than rugged and much easier to farm.)
---
Heavy on my server isn't worth the losses taken by the AH.
---
Deviate Delight has a camp fire going in the same spot in Org damn near every night.
---
Haha np I just discovered one of these for the first time yesterday. Didn't know they existed. Thought I found myself a secret little gold farming trick, but I'm on a high pop server so I usually can't find a node except during extreme off hours.
---
I never find these little secrets so I was hoping I wouldnt see them discussed that much yet :)

The servers vary A LOT. I'm Ally on Zandalar Tribe and Horde on Flamelash. ZT is a fucking lovely place, I find people to be really generous with their time and goods. Flamelash has a lot more bad eggs, lot of people who just ignore you, but naturally a good few cool players too. Got 1 free mageweave bag there.

Both best and worst has been Hillsbrad, funnily enough.

 I love the constant feeling of danger around each corner just as much as I hate seeing level 40+ peeps camping in the fields.
---
I've also loved that I have actually had to converse and work with other people to do a good portion of the quests.
---
Generally it's a great time even with its chaos. Playing a Warrior in that mess is a ballroom blitz of pain and bandages. 10/10 would definitely quest there again.
---
Are you me? Also got main to 44 and started alt.  Hunter is now 21.
---
Mix it with the relish!
---
Are you using Corruption for Nightfall procs? Without Corruption I don't know how I can compete with our Curse of Elements buffed mages.
---
That's not even what we're talking about. You said his numbers don't make sense. I showed you that they do. This has nothing to do with who cares about what. It's trivial, yes, but the point I was making literally has nothing to fucking do with what you've changed your point to.
---
Yeah this just isn‚Äôt true, lol.  My guild cleared MC in two hours this week, didn‚Äôt get the buff because we literally couldn‚Äôt have even if we wanted to in the three hours before our raid, because the NPCs are bugged.
---
He said a lot of tanks make friends and don‚Äôt need to pug, not that there are a lot of tanks
---
Find a mid range elite for your pet to tank.  Once he grabs aggro just have your pet stand there.  Put serpent sting rank 1 on your bar and spam it.  You'll miss the first 150 shots, but you can hit as fast as the global cooldown and you will never run out of mana.    
---
Remember to put your top rank serpent sting back on your action bar.  I didn't and then I ran ZF and hit every mob up with dots that did 20 damage total.  I didn't realize my mistake for 2 more days.
---
Earthfury is supposedly pretty balanced. I'm thinking of rolling Ally there. If you come as Horde we can balance each other out. (After you gank me relentlessly in Phase 2 while you are ranking and I'm leveling, that is.)
---
Yeah, every boss in MC is a joke.

Hey that‚Äôs actually a good idea! An ‚Äúoh shit‚Äù button! Do you level with your succubus?

God dam biizzard.

Yes you are. If you feel like your gimping yourself by not having escape artist or dwarf skin, choosing another class will just make that worse.

If you want a rogue for PvP shennangins ans you‚Äôre min maxxing you‚Äôre the wrong faction. You‚Äôre going to have to deal with 30% of players being orcs anyways. Furthermore you‚Äôre not an orc or undead yourself.

Go night elf rogue. Use a FAP potion when you open on an ice mage or something and go to town.

Rogue u just pickpocket all day and play by urself tbh lol

It teleports you twice the distance between your position and your hearth. You will likely end up in some ocean.

Should be good through all wings. I‚Äôd make sure the rest of your group is in the later part of the 30s for Cath, just to make it easier for you.
---
&gt; 99.9% of your charges while leveling will be used against a mob, which you do not need to hamstring
---
So wrong.  Hamstring kiting can result in 50% dmg reduction against a lot of fast attack mobs.  You should be using a weapon swing timer and only going into melee range when it resets assuming you're using a 2her.
---
Log on mage in IF, 5 whispers for water, someone wants a port to darnassus, go aoe farm Dm north and east until I hit instance cap... log on warrior alt and get spammed to tank pls.

Nope
---
The boss dies really fast in general. You‚Äôre adding a lot more effort for minimal reward
---
Honestly not meaning to imply you did anything wrong.  schmaltz is right that it is all out there if people look for it, but a lot of people won‚Äôt, and it‚Äôs really just about not drawing so much attention to it that everyone decides to check it out at once.  
---
It‚Äôs similar to real fishing - there is a ton of info online about what works and what doesn‚Äôt, but a professional fishing guide who has a strategy and spot that works for them is not going to broadcast it to all the other fishing guides in the area because if 50 people show up on the same stretch of river, the experience is going to be degraded for everyone.  It is just fundamentally different than fishing open water, continually respawning pools, or farming gold in instances.

Kill alliance anywhere cause fuck the alliance. Free time? See ya in duskwood!!

Leveling was slow till 30, and then got buttery smooth after 40, so hope is in the air!

A lvl 60 on Bloodsail was giving runs through DM for free. Each run took like 15m. I leveled from 17 to 18 in like half an hour and got smites Might Hammer and Cleefs cloak.

A couple days ago I was running strat for a necklace drop when [Archivist Cape](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13386/archivist-cape) of shadow wrath dropped. That cape isn't going very far, I can tell you that much, but I doubt my RNG will get much better in coming weeks.

Finish the quests in Ararhi Highlands. All the stuff in Stormgarde gives about 5g total and the greys vendor for about 50-75s each. 
---
Get a group to clear it in about an hour. I just did this yesterday and made 22g total (after AH a few items cloth, ore, greens, etc) as a mage.
---
It‚Äôs the same as paladin and not a lot of people get it. 
---
Sure most of your damage is melee/auto attacks... but your weapon takes care of most of that. The other 25-40% is spell damage (SoR, totem, shocks, Conc) so do both. 
---
The amount of damage you get from the measly leveling strength is almost equal to the spellpower effect. 
---
And never neglect spirit as king for leveling.
---
I didn't realize this is your first time ever doing Shazz and you lack the brain capacity to understand you don't need every single healer in your raid healing 1 person.
---
That's my bad, shit dude. Let me know if you'd ever like to learn how to play the game.

Thankyou mate that was super helpful! What would we do without you.

People in this thread apparently dont understand your point or what power creep is "well duh it's the next raid so it is gonna be better"
---
Of course the next content us better but Nax is waay  better. To the point where the game is almost broken for those that have full Bis gear 
---
I dont think there is anything you could do though other than hope for TBC or a sever reset
---
What is someone trying to prove by playing a balance druid? They suck.  Sure you can make them suck less, but they still suck.
---
I think the Bag was TBC, but I'm not certain.
---
Right now I'm doing dots and then switching to beast, you're saying stay cat while grinding?
---
To me it seems like if you are following the leveling curve and where there are the most people that cloth type is likely at the lowest it will ever be due to the over supply and AH competition. As more people reach 60 there will be less people acquiring linen/wool/silk etc and I would think those prices will go up over time.
---
Yeah no those statistics are from 10 days after the first server transfer opened, good try though.
---
Transfers opened September 4th, that is a census from September 14th
---
Have a nice walk bud
---
If you can transfer to a server that is dominated by your faction you can enjoy the PvE lifestyle with rare PvP interactions. Though if you have any empathy it will be hard to gank the other faction since they will be the ones who can't get anywhere in Azeroth.

There is no effort involved really

When Outside of the instance, the frames work great.

But, when I go inside the instance, it switches to only show the 1st group! I'm in UBRS right now, and only 1 group is showing, and it's now mine. How do I show all of them?

BRD probably around 56-57 for the whole thing, earlier if you only tackle the first half of it.

LBRS similar. Everything else I'd wait for 58. UBRS most likely sketchy to tank at 58, depending on gear.

It'S jUsT oNe SpeLl!!1! I don't get why people feel so entitled to other people's keys, time, and mana. It's one cast several times and then time to drink to recover the mana. At 60 making lv 45 bottles a stack at a time, sure, it's just a few casts and chug a bit while trading. At lv 50 making 2 at a time, a whole mana bar gives less than a full stack, so it takes a minute+/person.  Even the newly released crystal water is 10 at a time for 585 mana, so 4‚Äì5 stacks for a full mana bar, with at least a full drink to recover the mana.
---
That said, this post is clearly trolling, and I expect poking fun at people who act entitled to mage water.
---
Then why does it give you an error message when you try to reset and people are inside?
---
Yeah I mean you don't have to give it to them, it's not like rolling on it makes you a bad person. But its need before greed, not need before greed unless the item is worth &gt;100g
---
So if you don't want to respect need before greed then you shouldn't expect anyone else to either. They are different gold amounts but there's also different drop rates. You maybe only have to do another 5 runs to get that BoP to drop again, so it's still comparable

After you get relentless strikes there's a trade off between using it quicker or using later and I don't think there's a perfect answer it will be situational. 60% of the time your 1 -2 point finisher is free in combat points and 20-40% of the time you get your energy back. I think what you're doing it mostly correct and very similar if not the same as how I play my 53 combat rogue.
---
Fairbanks does. Also its pretty big on OCE.
---
Not forever but the free transfers are only between the same types of realms. You won't get to a PvP realm for free. But before too long they will offer paid transfers and you can pay ten bucks extra or something to move your character to a PvP realm.
---

If you ask a seller to offer, it is implied that they should start at the floor because they should expect you to try to negotiate more regardless.

That will deal more DPS than mages [edit:] as long as your raid has a shadow priest. The downside is it is boring af and you will constantly pull aggro from bad tanks.

---
Majority rules don't work in mental institutions.
---
let's dial back the sarcasm a bit from both of us and bring that back to a discussion, ok? ;)
---
first and foremost, **technically** you're right.  
---
but you forget that we're speaking in the context of melee weapons with a procc vs a melee weapon with your main stats.  
---
primarily, the benefit of melee weaving depends on how fast/slow your melee weapon is and your transition speed between melee and ranged distance. if you manage to grab every white swing, then a proc becomes competitive, but in reality you won't be able to take more than 50% (time required for aimed, multi, running in for raptor strike and backing off), which reduces the value of the procc by at least that particular melee downtime.  
---
on the other hand, when you pick a melee weapon that's a stat stick, all your ranged attacks benefit from the stats and to a lesser degree (agi = 1 mAP) the melee attacks.  
---
the exact difference has to be simulated, but in a rough estimate a proc weapon is quite a bit inferior to a stat stick weapon.
---
Me too.  I have Questie on showing me all quests, including low level ones.  I practically finish off zones before I leave‚Ä¶
---
Your download bandwidth (in 2019) is largely irrelevant to connection speed (ping). This could be a number of different things, but you haven't given anyone enough information here.
---
Is your ping on the server high? Do you play via WiFi? Do you share a connection? Do you live in a densely populated urban center? Is your ISP shit?
---
The above is where you would start.
---
Maybe it's not trying to prove anything but just find the spec fun?
---
Googling it would have saved you hours of your free time.
---
Wasn't the general consensus that this really only worked well on private servers, and didn't work as well in Classic?
---
Hijacking this to show people what an absolute ass this guy is, check his post-history as well. Alot of people calling him out.

Train is an emote due to MMO history rather than they randomly got voice actor recordings with a train sound in it.
---
It comes from EQ when mobs followed you till you zoned out. You could be in a dungeon or any zone for that matter where someone has messed up and in order to survive runs out of the dungeon training dozens and dozens of mobs behind them.
---
In this case (and possibly how they thought it would be used in a macro in wow) you would constantly spam TRAIN INC ZONE as once you zoned all the mobs would walk (not run) back to their spawns and *anyone* in aggro distance along *any* part of the path would be set on by all these mobs.
---
We don't have the same behavior in WoW but there are still trains. They just don't go as far and it is easier to avoid them by not entering combat. No one really got into the necessary habit of spamming this emote with a shouted warning - there's not the same level of need.

---
Shadowmeld has a passive increase to your stealth level at all times, not just when you toggle the ability. It can also be used strategically in pvp: vanish -&gt; eat food (breaking vanish) -&gt; toggle shadowmeld as one example. You just basically got a full heal and the enemy likely has no idea where you are.
---
PVE wise, if you get edgemasters then you are not missing anything that you'd have as a human other than one less slot for other stats and the rep gain passive. Consider that no other rogue race has the sword skill, and they do just fine in pve. 
---
To top it all off, you look freaking amazing in rogue gear, the weapons are huge, ranged animation is top tier, you get an awesome mount, and you do goddamn flips.
---
Pick the race u like dude. I'm not claiming it's better than the other races, because objectively it isnt, but it's not as bad as some make it out to be. Plus you will stand out as "that night elf rogue " and not one of the million humans.
---
I‚Äôm not sure if people either forgot that in vanilla you can heal or tank dungeons in a offspec easily.. I remember when people were starting to level up so many warriors were asking what talent points they should put into prot for dungeons.. me and other veteran/experienced players would quickly tell them reconsider otherwise leveling while take longer. Same with healers. It‚Äôs nice to see new people playing though and being able to help them out.
---
Fun fact: 44 is the halfway point in time invested to reach 60:)
---
If you search this sub you will find polls on this. There is a personality test you can take that people have used to link to class type. There was also an episode of countdown to classic podcast that a psych major broke down each class by personality type. Pretty generalized and subjective, but still a good listen.

This is me right now. Can‚Äôt join raid cause the spots are full in my guild. Then my guildies want me to tank dungeons for them after they cleared MC. I‚Äôm getting to the point where I might start my own MC pugs with others in similar situations. I wish there were more 10 man or 15 mans cause I thrive in those, and it‚Äôs easy to find people for them. But the loot isn‚Äôt as good so there is only so much of UBRS that I can do.

If you were level 70 that might actually be a plausible story.
---
&gt; I never meant to say Ravager is a relevant melee weapon
---
then, excuse me. i totally got it the wrong way. have a nice day, kind stranger on the internet!
---
Wait in stealth untill a horde players summons it. Tag it and either kill the horde if they fight you or just tame it after you tagged it. I did this on a nelf hunter solo. shadowmeld op op.
---
Neat. Do whatever you want. But don‚Äôt pretend that‚Äôs the necessary way to do the boss.

Imagine being this upset you never thought that maybe your MT didn't need a raid full of healers.

ok then

Nope.

I doubt it's going to in classic wow if they are following the same timeline they did in vanilla. The first Hallow's End event was in 2005 which was a year later.

Live your dwarven dreams! It sounds like a great idea. Since you like professions and want to level casually, I think dwarf warrior smith would be a great choice and fulfill class fantasy really well. Be careful with smithing though, it can be a gold sink if you dont farm all your mats (which is a time sink, but worth it if that's what you're into). Warrior isnt that bad, just take it slow and do some research on efficient leveling (ie. Use sunders instead of heroic strike pre-30).
---
I've just ran BRD and had Golem Skull Helm drop, I play a warrior and plan on tanking at 60, the other warrior in the group was tanking, we both need on the helm, and I win, and afterwards get flamed for rolling on it, as I weren't currently tanking, am I in the wrong here?

Ugh...of course nobody bothers to explain how the game works. At least [this guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dj20b7/why_is_1_crithit_so_impactful_and_why_does/f41xh8l/) included a link. So, I upvoted him.
---
TL/DR: You always get your + hit up until the cap. You don't always get your + crit. 
---
Kids these days play their D&amp;D and assume a two-roll system: roll the d20 to see if it hit, and roll however damage dice you roll if you landed your hit.
---
However, this is an internet game, so to be more efficient with bandwith, WoW uses a one-roll system for every attack. Whatever you rolled on that determines the result of your attack. 
---
Imagine a probability spinner with uneven possibilities, [like this.](https://isenseproject.org/media/80/807763d3e84e8875f7b456463b8f023b/spinner.jpg)
---
Specifically, note that each zone is contiguous...it may be big or it may be small, but it's all one lump block; increasing the probablity of  something makes that block bigger.
---
In WoW, the one roll system has priority, as follows:
---
* Miss
---
* Dodge
---
* Parry
---
* Glancing (vs. higher level mobs only)
---
* Critical
---
* Ordinary hit
---
Miss is first, and will always have space on the spinner unless you have enough +hit% to counteract it. +hit% makes the "Miss" space on the spinner outright disappear for every piece you have until the "cap", which is just where there isn't any "miss" left on the spinner to make go away.
---
Conversely, hit is on the bottom of the table. Effectively, you add up your total chances of all the outcomes above, and what's left under 100% is your basic hits. 
---
Let's take a pretty basic DW fury warrior hitting a raid boss at 60, and we'll say he's got a 15% chance to crit from stats and items, and no +hit%:
---
* Miss	24.6%
---
* Dodge	5.6%
---
* Block	5.6%
---
* Parry	5.6%
---
* Glancing	40.0%
---
* Crit	15.0%
---
* Hit         3.6%
---
Now, our warrior is bad because he's hitting the boss from the front, but he's doing so to make a point.
---
There's a lot of thing hindering this warrior; the dual wielding is making the miss chance go sky-high, and the unavoidable fact that the raid boss is 3 levels higher puts a 40% rock on his chest in the form of glancing blows.
---
What's worse, if various circumstances arise to raise the total chances to over 100%, and there's no ordinary hit space left on the spinner, *crit is next to go*. So, if we gave our warrior from above a hilarious +50% to crit...he'd get precisely 3.6% of that buff, and the rest just disappears into the ether. There's no space left on the spinner, so he can't benefit from it.
---
Curiously, he could benefit from it *if he could clear other space from the spinner*. He could clear the dodge and parry chances by standing behind the target, and he can bring +hit% to clear the massive miss chance his dual wielding saddles him with. All of this would make space on the spinner for the rest of the crit chance this buff would entitle him to.
---
TL/DR: Hit % is great because you always get it, and it's capped by its base chances. Crit % is capped by your other stats, and you may not always get it.
---
And as an aside, weapon skill does nothing for these percentages, but having a higher weapon skill prevents you from losing as much damage from glancing blows than you normally would. Since glancing blows are common, it's significant.
---
Yeah for a guild with such a memey name they really aren't very sociable.
---
I know it's not even close to same, but I had a 36 lvl character and ended up switching to a pve realm, it was 100% worth it.
---
Bro it‚Äôs very obvious you‚Äôre the only one upset here. The LMAO over and over again is a big yikes from me.
---
I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre really good at Classic killing the SUPER difficult bosses in MC. That make you feel better and important?
---
Like 36% with points into beast mastery.
---
Tanking is more fun if it's a full cleave group.
---
It's actually so mind numbingly boring as tank dps or healer, to actually cc everything and dps 1 mob at a time. It's slower, and dumbs down the rotation for every class.
---
Like if you want to pull that methodically, most competent players could probably handle multi-boxing 3 of the characters no problem.
---
If most people don‚Äôt have those items, then why are they necessary? I‚Äôll give you a hint: they aren‚Äôt. BG‚Äôs could be released tomorrow and nothing would be wrong with that. Unless you consider peoples fun an issue.
---
exactly right
---
Yes need  herbalism though to match zf
---
I'm not even talking about the troll post really. I've seen a few serious posts on this topic. I get people acting entitled and being annoying about it but I just feel like it's so much easier to make it. You avoid pissing them off, getting pissed off because they're pissed, and just looking for another group all together. I try to avoid conflict lol if giving him some water will shut him up and allow us to continue, I'm all about it.
---
Bring back the barbershop!
---
That face says it all. Kinky grandpa all the way
---
From what I have heard it was bannable in vanilla but now we follow the retail rules where it is no longer against tos
---
Hunter: R1 Wing Clip/Serpent Sting
---
Warrior: Rend spam a skeleton
---
Paladin: Alt-tab 
---
Rogue: Slice and dice
---
Yep exactly that, it's good fun healing dungeons and not even being bottom of dps simultaneously too! (low level ones anyway)
---
if you have the right group dungeon grinding can definitely be faster, you don't even have to be cleaving like this guy says, just a competent group that knows how to move fast and smart
---
So my question is pretty simple.  Is terrain exploiting to avoid guard aggro in winterspring actually against the rules?  Almost every day I have someone do it to me.  I always report, but sometimes 20+ minutes go by without action.  
---
There's literally nothing I can do about it.  If they wanted to kill me and deal with guard aggro, I'd be fine with it.  But they don't.
---
That's not how it works in the US. The seller virtually always lists a "list price". Usually it's higher than it should be, in case someone actually buys it at that price. Then, if the property doesn't sell immediately, the seller will re-list it with lower prices.
---
Obviously once people are making offers on the property it's more like an auction, and sometimes places sell for more than the list price, although that's frankly kinda regional (not terribly common here in Chicago).
---
mmm gratz ? not really that impressive of a "challenge"  it just makes you having more travel time... a mount doesnt make the leveling easier or harder, just cuts down a bit on the time .
---
then factor in the fact that you are a hunter.  You have aspect of the cheetah which is half the speed of a mount itself and you get that at level 20. so the time you saved with cheetah from level 20 to 40 is probably close to the time you lost not having a mount from 40 to 60.
---
But gratz on 60 nonetheless.
---
I see what you‚Äôre saying. That just not what he said, like, at all.
---
Mods can we please ban this guy?
---
Yo howdo you lock the Netflix window as the top one?  YouTube as well, do you need google chrome?
---
Also, if anyone can help nail down this regrowth calc, let me know! How far does it end up off for you?
---
Must've misremembered then, my bad
---
You selling them raw form or alc side of things?
---
People who bitch aboht getting groups are idiots...
---
Here's my 1 step guide to getting groups even if you dont fit meta OR are hella underleveled for the dungeon
---
Step 1. Make your own fucking group.
---
....
---
Blizz confirmed events would start from the beginning, specifically mentioning Hallow‚Äôs Eve.
---
Never said that. Just said that its extra dmg.
---
some context to this fight... they tried ganking me and I got away, came back and it looked like they were fixing to set me up or something I dunno. Probably killed them while they were scheming in chat.
---
Yeah this is actually the main reason they decided to ban healing potions/healthstones in the big dueling tournament that starts today. Just randomly having a chance to heal you for your entire health bar doesn't really have much of a place in a tournament with this much money on the line. They are allowing the felwood consumable Whipper Root Tubers instead as they can't crit.
---
I actually saw a scholo run a couple days ago being advertised with witchblade and stylus on reserve. Good luck getting casters with both their BiS pieces from that boss out of the picture.
---
Do you mean Starfire? Because their rotation is just Starfire lol.
---
Very odd
---
I don't.
---
I disagree, playing the game with ‚Äúshittier‚Äù graphics to what people will refer them to gives the game a more nostalgic feeling.
---
Edit: Id rather see a picture like this than a damn picture of a monitor.
---
Oddly specific, but accurate.
---
I did skim some Twitch streams and saw players on the Korean server with the Halloween food debuff so I think we'll get it tomorrow.
---
All transfers from PvE realms are to other PvE realms. And the same with the PvP realms.
---
Honestly, why would that even be the case in WoW? Like, what's the point of a volume discount? You're not spending much time opening the trade window with people anyways.
---
Anyways, there are lots of places that do that in the real world, and they almost always list the actual price at various quantities. Browse Digikey for example.
---
Honestly I'd rather die than level again without BGs to maintain my sanity
---
Daggers are higher dps in phase 1 anyways go for it!
---
No I‚Äôm 2h fury spec. Works very well coupled with windfury.
---
Not sure, guess I caught them off guard, I had just go away from a botched gank attempt while I was questing.  Stalked them for awhile until it felt right to attack.
---
You'll be so much better off going for a moonglow build for both dps and healing. 
---
Regrowth in the first few phases is too mana inefficient and you'll go oom really quickly.
---
I rarely use regrowth in raids apart from a down ranked regrowth on a tank every so often.
---
Once you reach aq40/naxx, regrowth can really shine.
---
it gets re-explained in every phone screenshot thread. a lot of people have a reddit app that makes it really easy to post phone pictures. that's great if you have an app on your computer that uploads even easier but most people don't need that or care enough to warrant changing their process.
---
this is all me playing devil's advocate btw. all my screenshots would be posted via print screen - i just understand where they're coming from because i'm not a pedant who cares about the quality of a screenshot i'm gonna look at for 2 seconds, that still gets the message across just as well as print screen.
---
tl;dr: who gives a fuck. you guys get riled up over frivolous shit.
---
What did you ninja?
---
Raiding as boomkin is pretty terrible, sure it‚Äôs fun but once you run out of mana you are stuck doing melee with no ranged weapon. Most MC boss fights are heavy anti melee too.
---
Reign of the boomkins starts in TBC, with most other off specs.
---
seduce soulfire wins most duels
---
10/10 you had me going
---
Thanks for taking the time to make the vid, it's going to be helpful when I hit 60 for sure!
---
I‚Äôm 2h fury spec, but the same law probably applies.
---

lol he‚Äôs banning everyone in chat
---
People are dumb lol
---
Take my updoot! Level 29 and holding until I got enough time for 30, heres to 60 in 2020 for me!
---
Lolwut? The exact opposite is true. Shamans are a pain in the ass to level, probably the worst hybrid for levelling, but Resto shamans are extremely good at endgame.  Both other specs suck in endgame (at least till ZG/AQ40) but enhance has a niche as a Nightfall autoattacker/totem twister
---
You could try to find a guild with a more suitable raid schedule for you.
---
I don‚Äôt get it
---
True. I guess on my server it's not like that I mean there are a lot of people farming it but most the time it's just a bunch of random guilds lol. 
---
I have been trying to and have made some gold off of it but it's getting hard there's just so many 60s farming it. My server still has like 2 or 3 layers but once it's down to one I am for sure out of business. Trying to fund my epic mount through it but doubt I will get to 900. I am at 500 right now though so at least I made some off of it. 
---
I just wish I could buy the skins and then sell the hands/legs for a decent profit but obviously that doesn't really work since people just buy the mats and then pay a small tip to get them made. 
---
Would totally been worth making a hunter and hitting 60 asap or mage or w/e and farming the shit out of them before everyone was 60. But every week it gets harder &amp; harder now especially on servers with guilds actually trying to monopolize it
---
I‚Äôm sticking with my guns here. I can find a fault with every single non subscription real money purchase in retail.
---
Classic has 0 and it‚Äôs been great.
---
Run Stocks if you 40+
---
There's a sneaky way to get on top the ruins above BFD too! You start and darkshore, do some mountain climing and jump onto the ruins in the mountains north of BFD. Slowfall onto the ruins above BFD from the mountains above and screw with the locals!
---
When I have a good spellcleave group tho I remember why mage is one of the best classes. But a bad mage just stands out a bit lol
---
60 warlock here.  
---
I log on and do my chores,  
---
Farming 2x felcloth for my mooncloth cooldown  
---
Spam Dire Maul north and make money on dogruns with skinning  
---
Otherwise I try my luck in winterspring on the lvl 60 elite demons (eye of shadow).  
---
Need to farm up more gold for my epic mount  
---
On raiddays I spend most of my day making soul shards, buying consumables and going over the warlock loot and council out the loot.  
---
Otherwise I spend my day doing dungeons or guild officer stuff.
---
It's particularly stupid for MC because Druids decurse, which is a huge mechanic in several fights, they bring Innervate, they bring BR and if you're HotW specced you can max rank Healing Touch at instant speed for that "OH SHIT" moment. 
---
Not to mention that competence is always more important than the class you're playing. Yea, you might be a priest and that's great, but if you're dispelling the Baron mana burn debuff from warriors and rogues, or you're a shaman ass pulling packs with your totems, your class doesn't mean shit.
---
Dire Maul was tuned for higher levels in vanilla than post-Cata, it‚Äôs an end game dungeon in Classic
---
Me too lmao. I love when they get super mad and tight with you like HOW DARE YU OFFER A LOW PRICE! Check the auction house it‚Äôs going for blah blah... then I say no sorry that‚Äôs the listed price not the sold and they usually shutup
---
dmwsbtiaatt
---
Oh. Sorry, I don't know. I've been running 2 monitors for close to a decade now, so no idea how single-monitor users fare with this. Hopefully one of them can chime in with a solution for you.
---
Shadow would only be interested going into another tree after 40 due to needing to get shadow form at 40 or latest 45 if you don‚Äôt want to respec after getting wand spec, as for holy leveling spec you could be completely right as I haven‚Äôt leveled holy, was just answering the guy on why the other person knew he was disc
---
congrats!
---
Love this idea, I actually avoided those quests because they were elite and alliance were running through that area hard at the time, but yea that could be a nice cleanup!
---
Because it‚Äôs already boring as shit to heal. Why bore half your raid team for no reason? Do you sit your melee on golemagg too because he burns the melee?
---
As the not so enthusiastic owner of a 2012 15‚Äù MacBook Pro retina, I feel this pain.  Most expensive paperweight I was ever suckered into buying.
---
Well I mean, I want them to kill me.  I want as many deaths as possible in combat log, to make it more obvious.  I keep an alt up there more for the shared ah more than the vendor, so it's annoying when I can't use it.
---
Nekkid Tauren?
---
I remember it was the other way around tho
---
Usually this lands me at my hearth location.
---
I get that almost every login as well. Majority of my macros are just modifiers to determine what spell to cast. I find that mashing ctrl, shift and alt sorts out most of them. Others have conditions like whether I'm targeting a friendly or enemy, those ones normally get sorted once I target an enemy
---
Not sure if trolling but you can‚Äôt skill up like that.
---
If the Warlock has their Felhunter out that is a nice advantage with Spell Lock
---
stands for, doesn't matter we shouldn't be talking in abbreviations all the time
---
It‚Äôs a weird mix, soo if you don‚Äôt go healer as priest at like 56 for those ends game dungeons (scholo, strat, UBRS) you will waste a lot of time waiting to pug a group or find a group since most groups need that tank or healer as their last spot. If you just convert to healer and run these dungeons to get geared for raiding, you will hit 60 pretty quick and amass a good portion of your pre bis. Then you can raid and get great gear (especially benediction/anathema) once you have the staff and possibly some other bop loot from raids no one else needs on a particular run that can be used for great shadow gear you can switch back and have a great shadow set lined up. You are sort of forced in to this anyway since anathema is one of your best weapons for awhile as shadow and you can‚Äôt complete that quest for it without being holy spec.
---
Cats do great DPS, they just require a super punishing and weird play style.
---
That is not the way lmao
---
Stick to themselves for the most part. Oh well still friends with my group but can get help easier.
---
As an undead shadow priest, I shit on warlocks on the regular. Devouring plague and wotf are very strong tools in a 1v1, and spriest can generally hold their own vs most classes provided they have mana
---
Still works well for me, you just don't go through the mob but just inside melee range then back out again.
---
Fuckin Len üòÇ loved That guy, he's a beauty for sure
---
Well you are wrong
---
Everything about MC is boring. This doesn‚Äôt make it any better.
---
I was gonna get that guy, but I got, got instead!
---
If it has a PvP solution, Blizzard doesn't consider it a problem.  You can take advantage of the spot the same as them.  When a mage was frostbolting my warlock from there, I healthstoned, walked right on top of him, and feared him.  He ran out into the room where the guards agroed and killed him.  Eventually some friendly players started dealing with him for me so I could get my Qia patterns in peace.
---
Try asking in general for some help defending if you're low level, or postpone the Qia stuff until you're high enough level/gear to defend yourself.
---
I actually posted something very similar a couple weeks ago (Tank rolled on a DPS helm and won it), the consensus was you roll for the role you are playing in the dungeon.  So if you're DPSing, you roll on DPS gear only.  If you want to roll for a different spec make it known to the group beforehand.
---
So long answer short: Yes you were in the wrong IMO.
---
It must be nice to have options like that. As a rogue a lot of my slots with greens in them literally only have one pre raid upgrade so I'm stuck with a green until I get pre raid bis.
---
Also basically every dungeon except Ubrs only has a single item I need, so it takes forever to get anything.
---
I'm level 21 and have smites hammer, gonna get the quest hammer today
---
If the guards aggro on to the person but can't path to them and evade bug out, that's called "safe spotting" and reportable. 
---
If they just stand where the guards won't notice because guard AI is garbage in classic that's allowed.
---
Nice dodge on the first part of my comment into a separate issue. Now it‚Äôs about wpvp? Okay bud
---
Most people don't go Shadow until early 40's (43ish I think) since before that a Disc/Holy hybrid with 5 in Spirit Tap is faster. Once you switch to Shadow you can get Inner Focus again by like 51 anyway.
---
Everyone loves the idea of world PvP, and you'll have cool moments from time to time. But in reality it mostly boils down to simply just ganking/griefing from the dominant faction.
---
On a warm summer‚Äôs eve,
---
In a tunnel bound for Felwood,
---
I met up with the Warrior,
---
We were both too tired to sleep.
---
So we took turns a-stabbin‚Äô 
---
Every furbolg in that tunnel,
---
The bloodlust overtook us,
---
And he began to speak.
---
He said, ‚ÄúSon, I‚Äôve got this far,
---
On a warrior playing solo,
---
By knowing where to farm
---
And which skills you need to buy,
---
So if you don‚Äôt mind me sayin‚Äô
---
I can see you‚Äôre out of totems,
---
For a heavy runecloth bandage,
---
I‚Äôll give you some advice.
---
So I handed him one bandage,
---
And he patched himself up quickly,
---
Then he charged around the corner,
---
Til he was out of line of sight,
---
So I rounded that there corner,
---
As he slammed that furbolg senseless.
---
He said, ‚Äúif you‚Äôre gonna play the game, boy,
---
You gotta learn to play it right.
---
You gotta know when to totem,
---
Wind fury totem,
---
Know when to Healing Wave,
---
Know when to run,
---
You never count your silver,
---
When you‚Äôre out here farming furbolgs,
---
There‚Äôll be time enough for countin,
---
When the grinding‚Äôs done.‚Äù
---
Yep this is my primary motivation for hitting 60 before P2. I also just never reached 60 and being at 47 I feel pretty close and I'm very excited.
---
Yeah but i wanted to try and find it on my own haga. 
---
Finally gave up and asked haha.
---
Most people don‚Äôt know how to tell if an item has been bidded on
---
You can just buy the new trinket from Dire Maul off the AH for 80-100g. It's quite a bit better for hunters.
---
I wanted to start Classic WoW but can't figure out which server to start on. I'm on US East and wanted a PvP one but to also actually make friends, any recommendations?
---
I would honestly say priest for the sole reason that it's easier to play.
---
Yes warlocks are gods at pvp and duels but only in the right hands with a skilled player.
---
Priests have fewer dps skills and the ability to heal. Lock has a lot more spells as well as managing your pet
---
A semi competent priest will face roll over anyone, a  semi competent lock will have a tough time.
---
You love asmon? Why? This is no surprise why is this even news, he‚Äôs creating drama for his stream
---
More people have recommended that shadow is faster once you get rank 3 mind flay, either way it is all really personal preference and I‚Äôll take your word about the disc holy hybrid. Either way this talent is a very good one none the less :)
---
Awesome I'll give it a try! Tyvm!
---
A guy was trying to sell edgemasters last night, I asked how much and he just said "real cheap". Finally someone got him to give a price point of 500g. There were 2 on AH for under a 450g buyout. People are actually stupid.
---
=D
---
For anybody who doesn't know, GRIZZLY has cheated and exploited at every opportunity on every private server they've ever played on. Cross faction communication is minor compared to other things they've done. I was genuinely happy hearing that they weren't on my server.
---
source?
---
That‚Äôs why u mark things high so the lowballs come in not so low
---
Unkillable Mobs close to the Dark Portal.
---
If you get this upset about people doing shit that doesn‚Äôt effect you in a game, you may want to stop playing and get in touch with a therapist
---
Undead vs warlock is obvi an outlier tho with the UD racial
---
I just think you posted this to jerk yourself off.
---
Trade chat
---
These people in the comments are toxic af. they can‚Äôt just help then move along
---
Being the leader of the group generally means you have to organize things and make sure that everything is taken care of, it's usually a little bit of extra work and some people don't enjoy being in that position.
---
I'm a bit like that, I almost never create a group, but I'm always happy to join one and contribute in any way I can.
---
You‚Äôd be surprised how many will find a summon if a 60 offers to run you through. ZF/Mara are also options.
---
Daggers aren't fun imo, they interfere with my adhd
---
Reading comprehension fail.  "They" is referring to enhancement shaman.
---
I went with LunaUnitFrames because it has a lot of stuff built into it.  An energy/mana ticker, druidbar, etc.  And it looks nice and is totally customizable.  I just wish it was on curse, but the author does regular updates and takes suggestions through github.

Hey gabagool ova‚Äô here!
---
You downvoted me. I shall hunt you down! &gt;:(
---
what?
---
They get it at 20. Unless there is a joke here I don't get.
---
Try Earthfury
---
Awesome, decent mob grinding? (I find that part of the game fun)
---
Defiasbandit is pretty famous. She already got muted in the Deviate Delight discord for ganking horde. Don‚Äôt ask me how the two are in any way related but the discord‚Äôs admin seems to think they are.
---
Why do you need to do that? You can just right click your own portrait and do it there without a party.
---
Sounds like you guys are not having fun
---
only need 90 :)
---
I think you should have at least mentioned at the outset you would be rolling on tank gear. More typically people tank while leveling to get groups and then switch to dps at 60 than the opposite, so it was probably unexpected.
---
Same. 1/29/21 and I'm popped to tank, heal, or DPS an instance as soon as I login. I rarely have any time to farm unless it's off hours or everyone's already full.
---
Uh no
---
Why bring up ele and not resto then? Writing coherence fail
---
Yea. My fear is server slowly dying, and transfering is not so much an option( if ever an option again) when you have ties.
---
Making an alliance bc A) I've never seen that side of the game before.  B) insurance policy C) maybe have some fun pvp while leveling on a more balanced/alive server
---
NOPE
---
Lul wut no, people make level 20 warlocks just so they can summon themselves all over the map.
---
Gnomes are assholes in general, I've never come across one that wouldn't decide to start a fight.
---
Do you play ally on grobb?
---
Shadow Priest absolutely destroys melee classes and isn't all that hard to play, but they lose to warlocks in an even 1v1. Warlocks have much closer matchups against rogues and warriors but have the advantage in every 1v1 matchup. They also require a fair bit more micro than priests.
---
You made it to 44?  Before making one alt?  If you're an altoholic what am I?  I have 13 classic characters all of which are 37 or below.
---
My guess is it's not translated. Probably shows the same. I'm sure you could switch the language and test it.
---
Cross faction collusion is not against the rules.
---
I was always pissed at comment who always say they have the item drop on their first kill, but guess what happened to me when I was there hehe. First kill drop! Now I get this kind of posts.
---
Troll train is the best emote in the game.  Change my mind.
---
I was gonna speak up then I realised I'm a druid who listens to that "Low-Fo hip hop, beats to study and relax to" livestream on YouTube.
---
Except you sell things pretty fast when you say that because a lot of people don't even check. Really.
---
There's a guild on my server called &lt;Clappin Gnome Cheeks&gt;... It's probably been flagged by now.
---
Do what you feel but I don't think that will make a difference. The first action taken will be a warning
---
Can confirm it is currently live on Arugal, one of the OCE servers.
---
1990 was 29 years ago grandpa
---
Nobody's targeting random flying level 30s. It happens even when I'm literally alone in the zone.
---
So no, wrong again.
---
For leveling? I honestly think it‚Äôs one of the few where you can‚Äôt just autoattack and constantly need to be aware of what‚Äôs happening.
---
Male troll here, can confirm.  It‚Äôs the only macro I have bound.
---

Stop you'll make me cry
---
I don't particularly like using mouseover macros for healing/support spells. I'll abide and do it for raids since all other solutions are unwieldy, but for 10-15m groups like in bgs, is there a way to cycle through people in different groups with the same button I use to select party members?
---
I use 1-5 for it currently, so the thing I want is for one tap of the 1 key to be the first person in group one, two taps for the first person in group 2, three taps for the first person in group three. Same logic for 2-5, ofc. Any way to do that?
---
You're the only one confused here and your inability to accept that you misunderstood is sad to watch.  Bye

Lightning bolt - Chain Lightning - Earth shock combo?
---
Using a throwaway account because Grizzly is the kind of guild that likes to harass you outside of the game :).
---
Like OP showed in the video, there has been a major problem with GRIZZLY and un'goro ever since the second week of classic.
---
GRIZZLY is basically a dual faction guild colluding to get 100% of the market for devilsaur, black lotus etc..
---
Me and my friends contacted Blizzard over this issue about a month ago and Blizzard told us to gather as much evidences as we can and that they will also investigate.
---
So for the 3 days after the GM contacted us for evidences we had hours of videos of that guild constantly switching layers to gank  us whenever we were challenging GRIZZLY for devilsaurs. We had a video of them basically doing the same for the Horde side ( GRIZZLY members  changing layers to clear the Horde contesting  Washed up guild members devilsaurs )
---
We had some of the GRIZZLY members asking us to leave Un'goro or the guild members of Washed up would be coming, and they did!
---
We had threatening messages about being blacklisted from all hardcore guilds, PVP, pugs etc..
---
After 2 weeks of sending all the evidences, the guild was still doing the exact same thing and we all decided to transfer to another realm to follow our group of friends tired of the queues.
---
Also note that there was a post about this on the blizz forum with discord convo of the 2 guilds but it got removed IIRC.
---
Alrighty then!
---
A fool and his money...
---
This is barrens for horse till lv40 lol
---
Western US here, unfortunately not live on Blaumeux :\[  You had me excited you rascal!  
---
Expects treat, gets tricked.
---
That‚Äôs why u don‚Äôt use dbm. Just because it exists isn‚Äôt an excuse.
---
Cool, thanks for that. I could swear that at laest for east, I was told there are some more (for example for Alzzin, or in lvl0 near Old Ironbark). But that's why I was hoping to find more info. That was already helpful though, thanks!
---
With DM:E jump runs a team of 3 can kill 4 bosses and get a chance at 3 dusty tomes in under 15 minutes per run.
---
I can see the price of all the trinkets (inc Forors) continuing to fall over the next week
---
That‚Äôs so sad.  Weeks of my troll train running up to people wasted.
---
At this point in the game, Bears are generally stronger tanks than Warriors in all content. Warriors will overtake them in BWL in terms of survivability but Bears remain legit throughout all of classic.
---
/shy does though
---
60 people doesn't seem that unreasonable, if they are saving 200g, that's still quite a bit
---
Nope. Attack power is melee attack power. Ranged attack power is exactly that. A bit of a poor choice in wording on blizzard's part, I know, but it is what it is.
---
You are really close! Keep in mind you've kind of hit a slump in the leveling process.
---
 It starts to get quite grindy from here on in but just keep questing until you can jump into BRD or higher to run for prebis - then don't even think about xp and you'll hit 60 in no time
---
Intellect scrolls. Any you find save them. Intellect = increased rate at which you level up weapon skills.
---
In a day or two?
---
The elite quests are more difficult, but are generally more rewarding.
---
Plus the Stormgarde quest chain has great Lore (horde side) if you‚Äôre into that.
---
It‚Äôs more about the difference in times. In vanilla the game was more about having fun. I never remember seeing a BiS list. In classic the game is all about efficiency and checking shit off a list. It‚Äôs not a job, it‚Äôs a game.
---
TIL
---
Oh yhea lol
---
1. Staying alive and doing 10% more dps &gt; staying alive and not doing 10% more dps. Not sure why you even bring this up, do you think people who dont mix max are better at staying alive or something?
---
2. Doesnt matter if it can be done, why burden your raid when you can put in some effort and come prepared with better gear. Also better gear usually means more health, which means less dying on bosses and trash.
---
3. If 30 dps are doing 10% more damage in your raid, thats pretty significant
---
I just want them to ban those retarded phone picture posts.
---
Eh... the priest got a full length fear on you and all they did was run towards you?? And never even put a dot on you, the hunter ran away until almost dead, and an unstealthed rogue.
---
You didn't even put on crippling poison even though you just applied poisons for the fight.
---
You never had more than 1 person attack you and most of the time never had 1 person attacking you.
---
speciesism
---
the extra threat only helps because DPS these days don't wait for the tank to build initial aggro (i.e. at least 1 sunder per mob, if not 2). 2H gives you initial burst threat which caters to impatient players who want to rush the instance. 
---
1H+shield is actually the way to go. 2H is only acceptable if you and the healer are overgeared/overleveled.
---
No clue what this is, it shows me this pic when I use showtooltip on attack
---
I never played Eve but that sounds like a bug that should be fixed. You shouldn't be able to set up a bit with money you don't have, or if you have, you shouldn't be able to transfer the money away until after you cancel the buy. ?
---
It's Tarren Mill - pls stop perpetuating this
---
Sort of. A lot of feral talents affect both Cat and Bear form and a few affect just cat/just bear. 
---
So you won‚Äôt be a great tank/dps if your species more towards one or the other, but will be reasonably powerful as a cat when specced more for bear and vice versa.
---
Just level, you'll save more time than stopping to farm just to buy a mount. 10G comes pretty fast on its own.
---
They're two different sentences with and without the comma. It's not really a matter of preference or whatever you seem to be implying.
---
Yeah GRIZZLY at one point was banning people that tried to sell Devilsaur in world chat.  Kinda disappointed that I rolled on Stalagg now that my friends quit.
---
This guy AHs ^
---
check out Frostadamus‚Äôs stream on twitch, i know he has some !commands for it. i was watching earlier but don‚Äôt remember the commands off the top of my head
---
I am a warlock
---
My sustain isn't *that* good
---
But fear is funny
---
pandaren became a thing, so...
---
Yep! I've actually not been questing too much, but grinding mobs and dungeons is too slow now. I just dinged 47 last night and I'll be going to Searing Gorge tonight. Hoping to do every quest in that zone to reach 48 tonight.
---
BRD as a rogue would be acceptable at what level?
---
I never said anything about collusion.
---
..just sitting in a tree bro..
---
get your gutterspeak out my mouth. :)
---
Picture in picture google chrome addon has been my best friend during the leveling process
---
I have bad RSI. I find hunters to be pretty easy when grinding and not really doing some more intensive stuff like  PVP or a dungeon.  Yea, you can go faster with more apm, but you can also just chill and auto and weave in extra hits.  In terms of RSI, the gym helps.  Lifting, resistance bands.  I had a doctor tell me years ago to just make my arms stronger and it helps a lot.  Also get an Anker vertical mouse for like 10$ they are good.  A handshack posture is better for me when using a mouse.
---
Azshara has fish tho
---
Tanking as a pally instance wise is great; particularly since most of your tanking gear is nested in an undead heavy instance.  I hear leveling isn't so great, but you never have downtime from a corpse run either.
---
Druids - haven't tried them, but the ones in Guild say "LOL" a lot, so I guess they gotta be fun.  I've grouped with a few, and seen some raiding.  They're a versatile class.  You can DPS, Off Tank, and Off-Heal within the same pull.
---
Shadow Priests Melt stuff, and do pretty amazing DPS while they are at it.
---
My personal favorite for cross faction: /sniff
---
Well the shouldn't brand it as true to lore when they were in a horde town and got killed by horde, what a shocking tale who would have imagined such a thing happening. I wonder if I went to a horde city on my Alliance character if I might happen to get killed there too.
---
No you didn't. I just looked at all your comments in this thread. You in no what what-so-ever link to or discuss the addon's source.
---
Haha! Thanks. I have some things going on this week but I‚Äôll be back and hit him up. 
---
I hate to admit it, don‚Äôt tell him! I had so much adulting that I haven‚Äôt watched the last several seasons of Always Sunny. 
---
I do think, however, that any person worth their salt can admit they are a little bit Frank Reynolds. 
---
As soon as I finish Goliath I think I need to go

---
I main a prot paladin in BFA. I've barely played her, and am like 320 ilvl. I rounded up like 15 mobs for a WQ and my wife asked me to do something. I was like, fuck it, I'll be fine and went afk. Came back a few minutes later and was at like 85% health. On retail, tank life is good life :)
---
I like how op is getting downvoted by people who didn't test it lol
---
Not sure on your server‚Äôs economy but those sell easy on Ashkhandi for 260+g decent pre raid gun
---
If you're alliance, killing the constantly respawning rats in the deeprun tram.
---
Elemental has three major problems:  
---
- Mana consumption. It's very hard to sustain their dps long-term.  
---
- Nature Damage. Curse of Elements, Shadow Weaving and Winter's Chill are significant buffs to the most common forms of damage in a raid. Not only are most MC mobs resistant to Nature, but Shaman don't receive any sort of Nature 'spell penetration'.  
---
- Itemization. There are Frost/Fire/Shadow pieces everywhere. There are Elixirs for those types of damage. For Nature, there are very few pieces and otherwise Shaman have to content themselves with generic spell damage.
---
If you remove those factors from consideration, Elemental Shaman are one of the highest dps specs in the game - largely due to the tremendous scaling on Lighting Bolt/Chain Lightning.
---
Yeesh.
---
50/50. It either happens or it doesn't.
---
It being easy is one of the main draws?
---
Sure, maybe that makes sense in a dueling scenario. But in world pvp, you basically get a free cast if the person is distracted and doesn't really see you. You might as well cast your highest rank frostbolt.
---
Wasn‚Äôt a bot, I sent an invite to them and they replied with a ? And then they grouped up when I get sending them an invite.
---
And if u read what I had already put, I was cooking dinner and asked my wife to take a screenshot.

But hey I appreciate there are some pretty toxic muppets on reddit happy to abuse any, the irony I had someone complain about the same thing in the area 30 mins later and I was able to let him know what to do after learning from Reddit.

If u want to just come and troll, try going over to r/roastme put a picture of yourself and enjoy!

Does wow classic have a free trail for friends?
---
I have a 53 shaman I was thinking about transferring to Earthfury

Not really, it's only real use at rank one is to apply the healing debuff.
---
Level 60 DPS Warrior.
---
Top the DPS charts all day
---
Top the threat meters all day
---
I'm basically the MT for most my dungeons.
---
It happens
---
You can stay in all blue, current level, swords from level 15-60 through only quests. It's a big reason why it's so much better/easier.
---
Did you make it clear you're running the dungeon for tank gear? Otherwise it just looks like a warrior DPS took a tank item.
---
PreBIS items are relevant at 60 so you would be double dipping if you're taking DPS gear and tank gear in the same run and should probably clear that with the group first.
---
Found the guy who doesn't realize that incorrect punctuation can change the entire meaning of a sentence.
---
I can still heal dungeons as disc at low levels, and I have the wand specialization talent that makes solo questing faster, so I don‚Äôt really level that much slower than any other priest when I‚Äôm just sitting in deadmines/scarlet monastery throwing heals.
---
But what if I'm a one-man apocalypse?
---
It mostly highlights a couple things:
---
1. MOST people find killing lowbies boring as shit. MOST people find killing people in their 50's who just want to get 60 and are going to focus more on getting out of a fight then fighting boring as shit. Unfortunately without honor that is the only pvp that is really around. There isn't any incentive to pvp.
---
2. A lot of players have already explored heavily, and while getting to places is fun, you can only run into walls for so long, and many people already hit most the cool places while leveling.
---
3. There is basically only 1 raid available (ony doesn't really count). Which means the only end game content to run is a handful of instances.
---
4. LF1M Tank for "Insert instance here"
---
It will get better when Phase 2 hits. There will be people interested in engaging in PvP and leaving the cities/instances, to get those sweet pvp loots.
---
It will get better when later phases hit and battle grounds come back so players can go there and there are more raid instances, which will push people to farm consumables.
---
Right now their is limited motivation to go out in the world. Most of the "neat" quests to discover and go back and do are already done while leveling as well. Things like turning into a furbolg or noggenfogger.
---
So most people who are 60 are working on other alts. Their professions are leveled. It is just waiting for content.
---
I was under the impression the crossbows from either Strath or LBRS was preferred over that.
---
Suck it :D
---
Druids are better tanks than Warriors at this stage of the game.
---
zug zug
---
That's why they're good in pvp lol
---
You have to front a certain amount of money for the buy order, it doesn't come without some loss.(the loss just isn't as much as the other guy possibly lost - it can backfire if people fill what was available of the order and never bought your overpriced goods - the only way the scammer benefits is if they are able to get someone to buy their specific sell order). 
---
It works as intended, Eve is famous for players being able to use mechanics in less than scrupulous ways.  Most of the people are there due to stories of heists/cons/betrayals.
---
Wonder how many of you that are crying never played vanilla wow.
---
You‚Äôre full of shit and I bet you have no videos to back up your tall claims. That‚Äôs Lame AF. Go finish leveling to 60.
---
Pickpocket isn't really about gold making, it's about never having to go back and level lock picking. Pickpocket sucks for gold making at all levels.

Could you please teach me the ways of a Ret Paladin?

I just pushed through and tried to group when I could, but I just don‚Äôt have enough time to play anymore. Got to 48 and the grind for each level just takes up too much time at this point to justify my 30-60 minutes a day
---
Lost my motivation right after i hit 60. Doing maybe 2 dungeons now per week. Also got like 6 alts but only one is past 15 lvl.
---
Feared to the heck realm
---
Yea but that person flying above you could have a buff or debuff, who says that person doesn‚Äôt have fort, mark of the wild, a paladin buff? I have poisons on my weapons at all times. You sound extremely misinformed and hard headed to not understand after numerous people prove you wrong. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt see it in my combat log‚Äù is your only excuse which has no weight to it. Look at the actual full combat log. And no I don‚Äôt want to see your screenshot that you posted because it doesn‚Äôt prove anything.
---
I've heard guilds were doing multiple hours worth of tribute runs all for a 30 min MC run. Lol, madness.
---
What alliance healing class is the most impactful? Additionally what is the most technically demanding class for raiding? I just like feeling important, but who is the most fun?
---
Arcanefrost is more dps on a raid environment and other mages can apply winters chill. However this spec gimps you pvpwise.
---
Both specs are fine for PVE
---
Lmao this right here, what‚Äôs the fucking point of hitting 60 and not enjoying it? I guess we‚Äôre all waiting for new content at this point
---
well most people have "fear" because of "imaginations"
---
60 lock. 
---
- Log on and see if there is a guild mage on and nearby to get water from. If not, buy water/food from a nearby mage for 1 gold. 
---
- Get in voice comms and jump into our main lobby channel. Talk to guildmates and see if anyone wants to run anything. 
---
- Run a guild group for a dungeon (sometimes ones I don‚Äôt need but at other times what I need) based on what a group wants. Luckily a fair number of our DPS warriors and healing/tanking/DPS druids can also tank. So tanks aren‚Äôt in short supply for guild groups. 
---
- Run pug groups after my guildmates sleep. They are east coast. I am west coast. And I stay up late. Pug groups are much harder to find as most people want tanks. So I usually farm mobs or do profession stuff on my main or alt while waiting. 
---
- Two to three nights a week, I work on my alt shaman with a group of 4 others who generally play the chars at the same time. 
---
- Frequently get asked to help with summons when I am in a zone. I usually agree unless I am in a rush to get somewhere. And more than once I have received no thanks for helping with summons. But most say thanks. 
---
- When I join a dungeon group, I am the summoner. I need to be there early. Many often just don‚Äôt head to the instance when I am in the group. This works ok usually. But sometimes only 2 people end up in the dungeon despite my reminding people we need three. 
---
- in groups, I often feel like a lesser mage. I was a mage main in vanilla. I miss making water/food for free. I miss teleports. I miss more viable AOE (lock AOE is fine, but mages have much more control when AOEing). 
---
- I live for the moments someone decides to engage me in 1v1 pvp. Warlocks are beasts. Sure I am not pvp spec‚Äôd, but my SM/Ruin build is still a very solid pvp build and locks are well beasts. With that said, more often than not, people don‚Äôt engage me 1v1.
---
Overall the classic experience is fun. I play less at 60 as I have less things to do than when I was leveling. I play my 49 alt less than my main as I only play it when others are also playing. I may make a third alt to level up, but for now I am just raiding one night a week, running my alt about twice a week, and doing 1-2 dungeons on my main about 2-3 nights a week. The other 1-2 nights are off nights when I do something other than WoW.
---
wait, binary spells and non-binary? how do I find out which is which? shadow bolt for example
---
This. Make your own database.

Thanks for the reply! I have been questing in new areas which is a fun experience for sure but I play on a pvp server and am constantly getting ganked by 3+ horde at a time. Currently not in a guild with my warrior and most of my friends are all playing on different realms because at launch the que times were brutal so everyone was being impatient and f\*cked off and did their own thing lol. I will continue to try and push through though because classic is really the only game I enjoy at the moment!

---
I "Go Blue!" 
---
Performers understand that you have to leave the crowd wanting more. Psychologically when you don't get as much of something you like you tend to like it more. I use that to motivate myself when I find leveling a chore. I restrict myself to only leveling with rested XP. When the bar is blue, grind away! But when it turns purple I finish up and head back to the inn even if I am having fun. Then instead of dreading logging onto a character I am eager to do so because I quit before I was ready to the last time.
---
You have alts so this sounds like it might be a good strategy for you too.
---
Just pick any server that does not have a queue during peak hours. You can't really go wrong.
---
Making my first warrior tonight! What are some must have add ons?
---
So a guy asked you for help, and because you don't like that people of his class reserve orbs to tank a dungeon they wouldn't otherwise need to go to for anything, you got really upset. 
---
Like, that specific guy didn't ask to reserve orbs, but his class does sometimes. 
---
Yeah man, you definitely handled it appropriately...
---
Oh I‚Äôm sorry! I‚Äôm Oceania it‚Äôs Friday here already

Could be my fuzzy memory but I recall doing premade AVs and we could get it down to 6-8 minutes for a win sometimes.

God both are awesome choices. The pally can wreck in PvP since you essentially need to be killed 3 times. I give them them the slight edge, but the variety of a druid is sooo appealing. Flip a coin!
---
Under the assumption that the prices are dictated by actual human needs and not just for internet lulz.
---
What addon do you all use to know what items D/E into? I know TSM has a "disenchant value" but also some items can DE into either like dust which is cheap or sometimes Essences/Shards which are far more valuable.

Ok, so if I wear no buffs and fly over somebody, there's no way I'll show up on my friend's spy, right? I'll test it tomorrow and we'll see who's right once and for all :)
---
I'm going slow boil on leveling. My first and main character, a warrior, is a day 1 character (well, day 4, had to remake on a new server thanks to queues) but still only just got level 40.
---
I like leveling easily enough that I can enjoy quests and take time to do professions and side crap, but man it makes me antsy to see my guild doing MC raids and DM Tribute runs.

I play horde on kromcrush. It's EST. I like it here.

Unless youre looking to muzz mate step the fuck back.

i‚Äôm referring to the situation where you actually make a deal for the item and then reneg. if it‚Äôs just an ad in trade chat then it‚Äôs fine.
---
A couple nights ago an alliance mage attacked me while I was questing, killing some mobs. Mage is pretty bad and an easy kill. He comes back two more times attacking me, I kill him both times. Fourth time he shows up with a level 60 and they one shot me. Even though he was the instigator every time, I know damn well he went and cried in chat just like that.
---
I rerolled from Mage to Paladin back in the day at 46. Started an alt never looked back. It was almost BC launch before I capped the Mage. Classic isn‚Äôt going anywhere. Take your time.

I‚Äôve been maining that Paladin now for 14 years.

Personally, I've done about 20 DME jump runs (checked courtyard, zervin and allzin spawns), and I've only seen ONE dusty tome on the ground (near allzin). That one Dusty Tome had a Forors in it though, so I'm not complaining!

---
If desperate you can hide in the corner where is throne is, the balcony side, and avoid the breath so technically only the MT needs it
---
Shadowpriest is absolute garbage PVE wise, even lower than tanks. Its all aggro and no dps to justify it.
---
Its a solo/PVP spec. It can heal 5mans just fine
---
Agreed. Lots of people are running LBRS first bosses. You could tank it and look for the rare spawn ogre near the ogre boss that drops https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13285/the-blackrock-slicer#comments as I think it parses only a few DPS lower than Arc Reaper.
---
Arcanite is so, so expensive right now as everyone needs it.
---
That trinket is so weird man.  Like I get it‚Äôs good for the +healing but it gives you literally 300 mana back over 10 seconds on a 15 min CD.
---
No doesnt work. It shows an error message and if you walk in its not reset. Literally happened to me multiple times already
---
Ive recently hit 60 and switched to balance.  
---
Ive been trying to prove to people that balance can somewhat dps. My dps seems to be on par with a mage with a few pieces of MC gear, at least on King Gordok but I still struggle to get into groups due to the stigma

I mean.. you're right it's not a big deal but I'm really failing to understand how pulling out your phone, opening your camera, taking a picture, and posting it through an App could ever be faster or easier than Print Screen then Ctrl V.

As a troll, definitely not. It‚Äôs pretty good pre-raid for dwarves tho. You‚Äôll want to go to Strat UD and pick yourself up a Carapace Spine Crossbow. The great thing is: Peacemaker and Cape of the Black Baron drop there as well
---
Alternatively, LBRS has Blackcrow, which is also fantastic if you‚Äôre not hit capped elsewhere. 
---
Personally, I farmed both so I can switch out hit where I need to as I wait for my leaf to drop.

Some form of smite priest with wand spec / spirit tap is best for leveling until mid 40s when you can respec to grab Shadowform

I can‚Äôt believe you would let something so minor trigger you so hard. I‚Äôm thinking your anger management is probably more of an issue than this guy asking for help with something.
---
Equip the shield first and see if that works
---
Hold on, I recognize that name, are you the rogue who rolled against the mage for the Inventor's Focal Sword and won?
---
If so, it's funny that you're getting annoyed on behalf of mages in response to what seems to me to be an obvious joke.
---
I like a rogue in my group, one less person to compete with for gear drops
---
Thanks for the tips! I raised pretty heavy when I was 13 but I was healing and never had to talk to anybody. just sat back with vent muted and pushed keys. It‚Äôll be a new experience this weekend actually being the guy guiding everybody.
---
If I get ganked once in a week there's too many of the opposite faction
---
You meant to say "level 60 fury warrior" ;)
---
Raided*
---
They should make spoof loading screens
---
I imagine a bunch of hipster gamers coming up with those guild names. They wear it like it's the new edgy cool trend. Gotta be different but instead they become like the rest.
---
Adding to what everyone else said of, it depends. You can always compare the xp from the avg mob from a q and ask yourself if you could have killed X number of extra mobs for the same xp faster than you did to complete and turn in the q
---
If everyone goes in and bursts him no. Its literally a sub 20 second fight.
---
Stop spreading false information. I've been doing this since launch. Figured I would post this info because I was running SM gy on my alt and nobody knew about it. It sure does show an error message. But it works. Trash and bosses, everything resets, just as everyone was outside the dungeon. I don't know how to prove it, other than you should probably test this again, before spreading false information.
---
Can you explain further what you did? Because it's pretty simple, leader just needs to be outside the dungeon.
---
And if you‚Äôre right congratulations, I‚Äôll admit I don‚Äôt fully understand what goes on behind the scenes with the API. It could pull data saying you‚Äôre in range of the person so you are able to  load on their client so information is still getting sent to them either way. All in all you‚Äôre just ignorant on how this add on pulls data
---
Exactly!! I have been doing that for the last week or so I make sure every time I log off I hearth back home or I just go to the nearest inn. I've actually not logged on to certain characters for days just to get as much rested bonus I can. I've always been an Alliance player since vanilla but I recently made a toon on horde for a different experience just when my Ally guys are resting.
---
We have that guild on Fairbanks. They horde too.
---
Not surprised a warrior holds this opinion.
---
The unfortunate reality is, it isn't "sometimes" we're talking like 80% of the time orbs are reserved. To make it worse, now a days its getting to be more than just the initial orb.
---
If people want to do "I don't need anything therefore I deserve to reserve loot" I think that the warrior owes me money because I don't need to kill the dragon he needs.
---
oh I see.
---
well then carry on good sir.
---
 [Neat!](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2tdbig/tifu_by_enraging_the_parents_of_my_girlfriend_by/) The pinnacle of humor, feigning ignorance.
---
I‚Äôd say paladins are the most impactful, all healer output is fine and the difference comes down to buffs which paladins just excel at. Paladins make threat management for the group so much better, and multiple paladins just increase the total buffs for everybody with Kings and wisdom and might (if no warriors), plus devo aura, ret aura, and resistance auras. Druids cant rez which gives problems in 5mans which I personally always have a problem with.
---
Totally agree and with late game raiding picking up, you will have to run mc bwl and ZG all in one week and the time spent there means less time farming but more consumables used so your money is tight once again
---
You monster
---
Yeah, I like having sex instead.
---
;)
---
You must be an easy kill then, because I mouseover everyone that flies past me.  Everyone.  Your refusal to admit you are wrong when everyone here is telling you you are wrong, and proving it, is disgusting.  Get off the internet, kid.
---
When is corehound belt pattern available ?
---
Doesn't hold true to this day. Most guilds allow memespecs as their roster allows. It's very rare for guild to enforce the typical specs as MC and Ony are very easy to clear. If your guild tries to force you, just switch now.
---
Nothing screams beef like a Tauren warrior. In a world where you want things big, watching a Tauren with an axe bigger than an orc on his mount feels satisfying to say the least.
---
Also Tauren swinging a 2h looks like they choppin a whole forest
---
People will complain about anything wont they?
---
I wish we could live in a world that was not so quid-pro-quo. However greedy tanks have altered the entire paradigm in which we interact with one another.
---
If it's your first time raid leading AND you're the MT, that's a lot of weight on one person.
---
I'd talk with the other officers and see if you can get 1 or 2 other people to be raid lead assists with you, to help explain things and call things out during fights. Hunters are great for this because they generally don't have too much to worry about, and they sit back with a good view of the battlefield, and can use their hunter's mark as an on-demand target icon.
---
The MT's got enough to worry about to be calling stuff out mid-fight, so that'd help a lot.
---
Too late? Most arent even 60 yet lol
---
I started losing motivation on my main at 53, not because of the class or any troubles playing but I noticed how much more active the pvp servers in my region are and regret following a friend in rolling pve.
---
Now my issue is looking at rerolling on pvp, got a rogue to 20 and a hunter and druid to the teens but can't decide what to play and keep swapping around, i loved rogue in vanilla but it's slower to level and groups are always "full on rogues"
---
I want to know too
---
Try creating your own groups! Plenty of people lost in a sea of "DPS LFG", why not take some initiative and create the groups? Works for me better than hoping to get a lucky whisper
---
People don‚Äôt care about convenience. We care about quality.
---
I mean confront is a strong word. I think I may have chosen the wrong way to describe the situation in my initial frustration.
---
I had that name for a while, it got old during dungeons when voicecomm was introduced during BC? 
---
"hey idiot go sap" 
---
:/
---
&gt; Why was this a bad play?
---
clearly bcs he died, also the mage used frost nova first, for all we know the rogue could still have a vanish. mage should have frost bolt from far away but not far enough that he could blink nova to finish the rogue.
---
Pvp. I knew a disc priest who ran a guild called FiveCap. They‚Äôd destroy a ratio basin with him leading. Not sure his build or gear but this was months before TBC. He had like 9k hp!
---
So you make already boring content even more boring because... why? Bad players? Lazy? No balls? All of the above?
---
If y‚Äôall can‚Äôt handle melee taking a bit of damage, y‚Äôall are gonna have a hell of a time in any raids after MC.
---
Murlocs are never alone. They get bonuses for every party member/class.
---
I see no tears, only words..
---
there absolutely are low pop servers, and just because the population cap has been increased doesn't mean that many people are playing
---
You only get 4 blues if you repair the trap which is expensive and using the ogre suit, which is less expensive, but a pain to remake every run since it's unique. This massively cuts into your profit.
---
And you are perfectly in your rights to ask him for money to help. Just as he can say no. 
---
Just like you can not join a group with an orb reserved. Just know that if you want a group where an orb isn't reserved then expect to run it without a tank. Cause we don't need shit out of there so there's no other reason to pug it.
---
It's cool just wanted to set the numbers straight
---
Good point. The other guy who was going to do it ended up having to work, and our Guild Lead asked me to do it. I‚Äôll talk with a few of them to get them to cover down on some. Thanks!!
---
Oh look someone from washed up weighing in LMAO
---
Same here. It's hard for me not to find a group to run dungeons. I've had to set aside some nights where I just don't do any runs so I can farm.
---
The reason it stuffed up is because it was using the data for the old DM bow: +7 agi, 1% hit.
---
Since it is using ‚Äúout of patch cycle‚Äù data, it remains PCB.
---
"pulling out your phone, opening your camera, taking a picture" is like 1 second. my phone is always next to me and i swipe to the side to open my camera. also, cropping the image via print screen would require another program wouldn't it? also, they would have to alt+tab out of the game; if they were in a hostile area, they prob wouldn't want to risk dying either. not to mention if they intend to post it later, you lose that screenshot by copying anything else to your clipboard.
---
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt hesitate to speak out loud and repeat‚Äù
---
Facts.
---
i main a warlock, love playing them
---
That is even further away for org/UC, doesn't have an immediate FP either, and is right by an alliance camp; how is it better than the ashenvale one?
---
Warlocks are great for dungeons if that's your thing. Decent aoe and lots of utility.
---
Seeing other rogues keybinds makes me question our sanity .. grats on the epic!!

What's stopping you? Go and have fun my destructive, voidwrecking friend. Huzzah!
---
&gt; My issue with this has always been: If they hate deforestation so much, how can they be okay with the Orcs and Undead.
---
Because honestly? The Blizzard writing staff won't make anyone a primary actor in any WoW story who's not Human, Orc, or Sylvanas/Nathanos.  Tauren, Night Elves, Dwarves, Gnomes, Trolls, they're basically all secondary actors for all eternity who just go along with whatever their masters are doing.
---
Guys, i have a 60 level mage. I'm doing pretty fine with it. Now i'm rolling a tank warrior as second character. I'm tanking my first dungeons (rfc,wc) but they re not going well. I'm level 20 arms warrior but having tons of problems. Aoe pulls in dungeons are never under my control, which happens quite often. Even on single targets, i'm having aggro and rage problems. Should i swtich to prot spec? Are these problems temporary? Any tips? i really need help...
---
Welp, don't join Westfall.  There's enough Alliance scum on there already!
---
Idk dude at the very least the math with ele shows they‚Äôre probably the most viable ‚Äòun viable‚Äô raiding spec. Current day shows mana isn‚Äôt a problem anymore due to consumables so work hard and u won‚Äôt beat top dps due to debuffs, but you‚Äôre there when thunder fury becomes part of the raid...·ï¶( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)·ï§ 
---
Go and stop being a Debbie downer, play a little more with consumables and do some math for the sake of your dps. Play with courage, or casual hardcore elitists will bring u down to the point you‚Äôd be better off rerolling.
---
Oh and stop rolling off spec. I can‚Äôt tell u how hard it is to get tanks and healers to trust that I won‚Äôt roll on their shit. Hybrids giving me a bad name.
---
Nowhere have you quoted or linked to the source code.
---
What about for warlock? Same?
---
populations are already declining, the decline will get steeper
---
The keys you use for turning are the default ones I assume? If so, I'd recommend swapping those from turning (default) to strafe, and then get used to using right click and mouse movement to swing camera around. Once you get used to this, you'll have far better control of your character in both movement and skill usage. If you're using your left hand to turn, it means you cannot simultaneously activate a skill with that left hand. That means you break it down into two motions, the key turn, then let off and hit key for skill, which basically doubles the time it takes you to do anything.
---
Edit: forgot to add that swapping the key bindings like I suggested will open up Q and E, both of which I bind to skills on my bars. I use ElvUI to manage my bars, but bartender will work if you just want customizable bars without the full UI overhaul. I use 1-5, then shift modified 1-5, Q-E-R-F-V, and then the shift modified versions of those same letter keys to achieve 20 buttons I can hit all with only my left hand. Oh, I also bind mouse button 5 to something (mouse 4 I leave default as my auto run) and mouse scroll click as something else. Hope this helps!
---
I'm just kinda pissed that they rushed to 60, then they started moaning that there's nothing to do. Now we got Dire Maul early and that's fine but in a couple of weeks they will start moaning again. Hopefully BG's will sate their need to rush till cows come home.
---
That proves my point though. That's a hilarious story for everyone not involved.
---
Did you really just say no balls? Yikes 
---
Holy shit, you need to take a break. Classic is a joke in terms of difficulty. Not as big of a joke as you, but a joke nonetheless.

It's true that Tony never had the making of a varsity athlete.

If you're watching something on YouTube, you can double right click and select "Picture in picture'. Netflix also has that option I'm pretty sure.

Sunder Armor and using revenge and shield slam on cooldown are basically the options. For larger pulls battle shout and demo shout generate some threat. Don't bother with heroic strike except as a dump.
---
There are two easy solutions to this question that you could not bother to reach 75 characters for, so the bot wouldn't remove your post.

Do you play tank? If so, do you intrinsically enjoy tanking?
---
Kirtonos!, we need more alliance lol
---
it's called creating a new character
---
failed trial
---
This isn't true. If they are in an area where guards would normally attack them but for the spot that they are in, it is against the rules and reportable and blizzard will issue warnings or other punishment
---
You sound like me except I‚Äôm gonna make a pug so it‚Äôs going to be a lot more frustrating but without 20 mans to use as a platform to build a raid team we will work with what we can get. The only thing I can say is don‚Äôt second guess yourself on loot give yourself the might first cause it will help your raid out a ton.
---
Yea it so few quests they could have built on it alot more
---
&gt;  Idk why they don‚Äôt offer paid transfers would make them some good money
---
because this sub would cry about it
---
If you think innervate is better used on an oomkin rather than a mage that can do double the dps that's on you, lol. The numbers and spreadsheets have been available for years, it's just a fact that boomkins aren't great or optimal, you can have fun, that's about it.
---
Also innervating the healers is the best thing to do so you don't wipe, but you work on your oomkin dps lol.
---
Can't tell if troll or serious so I am going to disable replies from the mental gymnastics.

Not hamstring kiting, but hamstringing the creature near 20%, so he's still part of the aoe.

That's why guilds have already started doing split MCs don't need 40 to clear it

I have noticed a significant increase is costs almost entirely across the board, per say.  I believe you're right about mount money frugality, but /u/ExiledToTerminus makes very valid points, as well.
---
However, the servers are still new enough to considered going through "fresh server" fluctuations.  And there is also now markets that will open up soon when phase 2 and 3 hit.
---
I dunno about an addon that does it, but it's all based on item type, level, and quality
---
You can refer to [this guide](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/enchanting-classic-wow-1-300#how-to-disenchant-gear-for-enchanting-reagents) (scroll down to "How to Disenchant Gear for Enchanting Reagents" if that link doesnt take you to that part of the page) to see level ranges for the different types of disenchanting mats.
---
Green-quality weapons have a higher chance of dropping their level range's essences, but can also drop dust. They also rarely drop shards.
---
Green-quality armor has a higher chance of dropping their level range's dust, but can also drop weapons. They also rarely drop shards.
---
Blue-quality items drop shards, or, rarely, crystals.
---
Purple-quality items drop crystals.
---
Ha this gave me a chuckle
---
60 Orc rogue here.
---
Log on, head from UC to GG. Listen to the cries of lowbies as the jungles take them. Go gank 3-5 low 50‚Äôs camping my baby hordes at Nesingwary.
---
Hearth back, guild telling me to keep farming gear. Fly to Thorium Point because I shouldn‚Äôt have hearthed. Kill some lowbies that get the jump as soon as I land.
---
Join a BRM dungeon, get nothing. Hang around BRM and distract autorunners off chain into lava, gank the 2v1 thinking they can kill my warrior brother.
---
Ask in guild if anyone needs anything.
---
They request things I cannot grant, gank a small gnome as depression sets in.
---
‚ÄúWhat is the meaning of life?‚Äù I ask, watching the gnome skitter to safety. I don‚Äôt chase, big Orc don‚Äôt need cardio.

Return to Durotar walking backwards, buy a pick. Begin mining copper ore while preparing for a long life of work work.
---
Pretty sure its called gathermate2 - I cant get the addon data dump to work to show me the spots for all the nodes though - if anyone has any tips? its great for tagging the nodes Ive found on my map though.
---
They are probably a little dickish, but honestly, there's a daily question megathread you can take advantage of.  I usually try to answer a bunch of stuff during my work downtime.
---
Your simple question shouldn't really take up an entire post.
---
A+++++++
---
As a healer, THANK YOU. It's appreciated when mages preempt, and it's even more amazing when there's 2 or more stacks. As you pointed out... sometimes just taking a quick sip between pulls can shave a decent amount of time off runs. Really makes things smooth when you can drink without thinking.
---
I've checked and the addon is totally wrong it's not even slightly accurate...
---
this is a pretty typical scam in runescape and other games with an in-person market. go to a populated world, have two people not within the same screen, have one try to buy for x and one selling for like half of x, even though it's still massively overpriced.
---
Anything that shows swing timers.
---
I mean if its a warrior tank whose been handed everything hes ever had on a silver platter I'd be pissed too.
---
Exactly.
---
Never saw anyone reserve orbs. Im a Rogue. I dont know if thats a troll post, but if not, youre a assholw.
---
Silk Bags on my server are going for 25s per. Probably due to all the SM farming. 
---
Check out silk prices on your server, I bet you can find mats/bags for cheaper than you think
---
As much as that shit is annoying, there's also a daily question megathread for a good reason.
---
Yeah i just cant even bring myself to play that without a full-chemist in my party.  Too risky otherwise
---
You literally said it yourself that he didn‚Äôt specifically ask for anything but yourself to help. The only greedy one here is your whiny ass expecting compensation just because some guy asked for help and didn‚Äôt think to give you a shiny fucking trophy as a reward.
---
No joke - I literally paid for a good chunk of my mount by farming boars outside of Org for boat meat and selling them. Drop rate is like 90%, people need it for leveling up cooking, and it usually sells at a decent price. For a few days I was the Boar-Meat king of Whitemane.
---
Playing the auction house is much easier than you think.
---
Phase 3, according to wowhead.
---
This is extremely accurate. I've done ubrs at least a dozen times and the exact same loot drops off the first 2 bosses every time. I've seen the sword once and lost the roll to a rogue in my guild with way better gear than me who does 100 dps less than me.
---
how old are you lol just tell him "naw im busy sry"
---
As much as I love Druid, I can‚Äôt find a group to heal for all my life. My heal set at this point is extremely good but I‚Äôve tanked all but 2 dungeons at 60.
---
I guess I can‚Äôt complain, I can make instant groups and tell the healer I‚Äôll need to roll healing gear as well, but tanking has started wearing on me. I want to chill out and heal some people
---
I have a 60 lock, and lvling a alt rouge, and loving it.

[Imagine having to read the only comment to your submission before the entire post removed.](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dj8u86/hide_realm_names_in_chat/)

Yeah, we‚Äôve got 31 people signed up and ‚Äòpugging‚Äô 9, (the pugs are a guild we‚Äôre trying to get to fold into ours). We waited for the core of the guild to get 60 instead of running like 20 people and pugging 20 and calling it ‚Äòour raid‚Äô. 
---
We‚Äôre better off for it I feel like, and I was looking forward to just tanking and letting my in-game buddy raid lead, but he has to work and our GM asked me if I could since i‚Äôm (humbly) pretty well respected in the guild. 
---
I hope your raid goes well brotha!!!
---
Kill the basilisks outside of crystalvein mine in STV. Was getting around 7-8 gold and hour.
---
I dont think so. I get 4 blues, 2 off boss 2 in chest. I have done 6 runs and only had one run give 1 blue in the chest. I believe the bosses simply have to be alive, they dont have the have been trapped and distracted with the suit.
---
Realm names shouldn't show up in chat, so can you elaborate or show an example of what you mean?

Mankrik horde here as well - I agree . Need more ppl to get that economy going great

Pick up fishing as well and then fish the pools in STV for those chest things which contain mats for other professions then sell those on the AH.

Yep get the carapace. It‚Äôs free and it‚Äôs better.

You can only transfer to servers that Blizzard has authorized, you are not able to choose beyond that.

The idea is that they move players from servers with high/full populations to lower ones to balance them out better.

This is so weird to me. Most ‚ÄúRuns‚Äù are just boss chains Warrior tanks need. You literally have to have something everyone needs or you need guildies to help.

The OP is the one trying to sell if im not mistaken. "how much do you pay per crystal"  while the other guy is asking "how many do you have"
---
Is it your first time here? Because you clearly don't understand how reddits voting system works and impacts your ability to post.
---
I probably wouldn't go through the trouble unless you happen to get super lucky and get both swords during your normal playthrough. These are just weapons for levelling up. Bonereavers edge, obsidian edge, spinal reaper, blackblade of shahram, arcaninte reaper, and dreadforge retaliator are the primary BiS/pre-BiS available right now  
---
With the Ice Barbed Spear not being out for a while, that isnt even a part of the equation for the current levelling process. Around the same range where you can get Sulthraze, diabolic skewer drops in ZF (shadowpriest sezziz), theres the rockpounder/stoneslayer from Uldaman (archaedes), the gator bite axe (rotgrip) and the scepter from the princess. 
---
At level 30 you can get your Whirlwind axe which will get you all the way up until ZF unless you manage to snag the Ravager from SM armory. I'm level 45 and I still havent swapped out my WW axe.
---
I feel like you overreacted to a simple request.

I will counter I never found it to get grindy in the leveling process. I‚Äôm 58.5 now and have done three different partial BRD runs and Sunken Temole once and I feel like holy crap where‚Äôd the levels go. I‚Äôve done a bunch of Felwood and Un‚Äôgoro but nothing of the plaguelands.
---
I think you are severely overstating your supposed "intrinsic" motivation to tank. If I actually enjoyed a certain aspect of the game, I would do it for free, no contingencies.
---
As far as playing with your guild is concerned. That's fine, but we all know that the type of person to reserve orbs is running a get-rich-quick scheme usually even at the cost of his guildies. Maybe you'd play with your guild members, but do you think its out of the realm of possibility that others would PuG for cash instead of playing with their guild?
---
Now the question is, how did it get to this point? The answer is simple, tanks are greedy.
---
As a Warrior Tank who only needs shoulders to have per-raid BiS.
---
I log in. Check on my guildies. See if anyone needs a run. If someone does I make a group and we run dungeons. Most of our guild hasn‚Äôt hit 60 yet but they are all over 40 now for the most part. 
---
If no one needs my help I either work on professions or rep hydraxian/Thorium/IF For MC runes/dark iron crafting/ I‚Äôm human and I want a Ram for my epic mount. 
---
I have been leveling a paladin Alt when I only have a short time to play. He is 21 with his quest mace now.

Swing Timer! https://github.com/EinBaum/SP_SwingTimer
---
&gt;Hey guys, I am currently a 35 warrior, I'd like to start doing some sm armory runs for mainly the helm upgrade. How long (roughly) do these armory runs take ?
---
Depends on your composition and method of clearing. You can do it in like 1/2hr-45mins with a good group of AoE, otherwise it can be about 45mins-1.5hrs if you clear each pack individually. 
---
The times will obviously vary if you have higher/lower levels, wipe or take breaks etc. 
---
&gt;Also how long do the gy and library take as I may need to get the key.
---
Both are about an hour for standard runs, you don't need to do the GY at all to get the key. The key is just a lootable item from a chest after the final boss of the library.
---
I think it's the weird middle ground of frostbrand and windfury. Not physical, but still based on weapon damage. Pseudo-random proc based on weapon speed, rather than flat chance.
---
He can mouse move for everything. Feels weird on WoW to me but that‚Äôs how my son does it.
---
At least xroads is central.
---
I don't think so.
---
They can, but having a slower oh than mh is always awkward.
---
DB is very much a mh weapon unless you have two (at which point its a pocket 2her)
---
Weapon speed advantages:
---
Slow/fast: Smooth rage gen from oh, big ww and op hits. My preference.
---
Slow/slow: 2h-like rage gen (clunky), big burst, flurry applies to 4 swings if same speed.
---
Fast/fast: Incredibly smooth rage gen, same effect on flurry, no burst.
---
Fast/slow: essentially slow/fast except your wws and ops suck. Not recommended.
---
What a bad ass. Damn dude, we‚Äôre all so impressed. You‚Äôre so cool.
---
I agree with you 100%, which is why I think nobody should have it, because they can avoid engagements with me thanks to the addon.
---
i'm pretty sure the Sopranos know how to use the print screen button or the sniping tool
---
is ZF still the farming spot for a mage at 60? Damn
---
Do you feel you are qualified to suggest medical care to me over the internet based on a single reddit post?
---
If you plan on only dungeon grinding as a healer then yes.
---
Grats! Oo will the other priest be upset when I win the roll on this ü§≠
---
Is that Sid Haig?
---
So is transferring servers not allowed normally?
---
I'm glad I'm not in your guild buddy!
---
Westfall is PvE...
---
A bit sad it's the same options as earlier. Got a 60  paladin on Gehennas,  but all my RL friends on that server quit. Started leveling a Hunter on flamelash together with another friend. Was kinda hoping I could move my pala there. Out of these destination realms which one should I choose? A bit tired of the stress the queues on Gehennas bring. Are you on Judgement, Bloodfang, Earthshaker or Dragonfang? What's great about your server?
---
Benediction!
---
Shadow priest is THE easiest class to play well in pvp. Very few skills in shadow form and the same tactic vs every class. 
---
Warlocks are very strong but have a higher skill cap. Lots of skills to choose from in different situations 
---
Both are extremely powerful.
---
TB is the best for a bank/AH alt.  UC is probably the worst.  Org is in the middle, its nice that you can alt tab to an alt account and autorun between the mailbox and the leftmost AH npc.
---
Try grinding basilisks in shimmering flats. There is a basilisk camp in the south near the pass to Tanaris. A lot of basilisks with a fairly fast respawn. If you are deep arms build, charge in, pull 2 mobs at time, use sweeping strike following berserker rage (extra juicy rage)  use whirlwind&gt;cleave till his death. It's like 10g /hr for pure vendor grays, they can drop greens and if you have skinning, vendor the medium and hard leather for extra profit. I did this on lvl 38 till 40, got enough gold for mount and spells (I started with 20g on my pockets)
---
Good luck fellow Warrior :)
---
I just wanna be a fast cat and sometimes a bear. Just lemme run.
---
Sounds like a fun talk to have! The only class I have really seen a distinct personality type with is priests, and even then it‚Äôs about 40% of priests that hit that button to me
---
As a druid (feral tank/dps) I basically have no issues getting into groups.  No issues really getting loot (very very few leather guys out there), have a full healing set in the bank besides rings/trinket.  Get random whispers after midnight server "Are you resto, if so wanna do X dungeon"?  or "Are you tank, if so wanna do x dungeon".  In MC, basically have no shot at gear since druid tier is healing so its offspec, leather gear is rogue otherwise.  Only got a shot at leather fire resist gear honestly lol.
---
Mana tide totem is a resto shams bread and butter .
---
Sure
---
Do not level in Prot. A lot of your threat comes from damage and switching to prot will tank your damage while not giving you enough in return. Prot is much better at 60 when you might need the additional defense or you have enough damage to be able to keep threat up
---
Make sure your DPS are giving you a sec to build threat (I wait for a sunder or two if I'm gonna dump some substantial DPS)
---
I'd check out the Fight Club Discord, it's the Warrior Discord and they'll be able to give more targeted advice
---
Yea. My goal is to get to 40 and buy mount. After that I dunno. Currently 38 so one could say that I ain‚Äôt rushing hehe. But I need that mount. I am extremely tired of running, almost to the point that I am burned out on wow. It feels so pointless to run around
---
That area is part of winterspring in classic.
---
Likewise ‚ô•
---
You still have to hover over the target in the raid panel to heal them right? I'd rather just use mouseover macros in that case because I get to use my normal binds for everything that way. Was never a fan of the click-to-heal addons since I keybind everything.
---
I just want to be able to more quickly select targets with my 1-5 binds because that's faster target acquisition than moving my cursor over someone's frame, for me at least.
---
Herod
---
There's some theory crafting going around right now on a moonkin DPS spec that "might" out perform starfire spam in the first two phases. It has something to do with getting a melee weapon that is very fast and spaming moonfire in between hits. 
---
I dont know much about it or even if its appropriate for raids, just that some of the balance theory crafters were looking into it. So it may have been that.
---
*RRRRAAAAAAAGE!*
---
/log out
---
You can heal the raid fine. You just cant heal main tanks
---
I refuse to believe this is a serious post.
---
Enjoy Classic for what it is, but maybe look at it as a stepping stone to them re releasing TBC or WoTLK. This is how I view it, there are a lot of improvements made in TBC.
---
How in the possible world do you prove colluding, in an actual meaningful way like with "legal" weight.
---
Is helping someone on the other faction kill a mob or with a quest colluding?
---
Is deciding not to engage someone at any point colluding? How do you prove that just because I killed player A, then player B walked by, that I was "colluding" with player B?
---
What if I have a vendetta? What if you were a piece of shit to me at some point, I happen to stealth over you as you're hiding from 5 Alliance, and unstealth to give you away. Is that colluding? 
---
None of this shit is provable without like days/weeks of observation, which no one is going to waste time, especially not Blizzard's already spread ultra-thin GM staff.
---
Otherwise, it's all circumstantial.
---
Yes, this is pretty egregious but the rogue comes back with "He was stole a quest mob from me when we were leveling and I just happened to stealth over him and give him away" or "he just stole a Devilsaur skin from me". Yea, 99% bullshit, not disprovable though.

MC is easy.  You stroll in there with a couple of prebis items and all 60s and you set.  Getting in later just means more loot for you.

Its a better solution then venting on people in mmos and reddit. Again nothing shameful about it and I would suggest it to many people.

What makes you think I "resent" a class of people? Does suggesting that I think we should not do things so quid-pro-quo mean that I harbor resentment towards tanks? What a black and white world you must live in.
---
My favorite wasnt in Org but in Kargath. Our guild was getting ready for an MC run and my boomkin buddy jumps on top of the mailbox and starts dancing. I forgot how hilarious their dance is.
---
off the bat, it sounds like a bit of a gear problem.
---
there really isn't any need for prot spec until high 50s 
---
I usually: Charge --&gt; Thunderclap --&gt; Sunder --&gt; switch target --&gt; sunder etc.
---
I usually add the bleed as well...uh can't recall the name.
---
you should also feel comfortable switching into defensive stance to taunt a mob too. the arms tree has a skill which retains 25 rage when you switch stances so it's really useful.
---
also, if you have a mage (sheep -  humanoids) or a hunter (freezing trap) or even a rogue (sap), mark the mobs and get them to CC one of them. Not all mobs will be able to be cc'd but it doesn't hurt to get them used to cc'ing. it's not required but if you are having issues, that should help a bit. 
---
if they don't want to, feel free to drop group because you'll find another.
---
Log on "Tank this dungeon", Leave a dungeon "Tank this dungeon" say I want to go farm a bit "But hey tank this dungeon"

I played arms warrior in TBC with a slam build in raids. Pretty fun and was good dps. Not sure if it‚Äôs viable in classic?
---
at 48 I think the ones in the south are better.
---
I actually forgot about that. I guess whatever works for them.
---
A guildie warlock said he was doing a quest for it
---
I'd say both library and armory are 40-60 minutes... Graveyard is really short I'd say it can be done in 15-30 minutes. Just my average experience when I was lvl 35 Priest with many different groups.
---
World PvP is the purpose of being 60
---
I did, but then I came back as stated in my post.
---
Unemployment doesn't just last forever
---
Sword of Zeal was on the AH for 350g, I was like nah it‚Äôs not worth that I‚Äôll offer 250g. Someone bought it at 350 :(...
---
Yeah totally agree; I play a druid tank and recently did a RFK pug where the hunter party leader was in doubt if a druid could tank RFK. Probably heard on YouTube that druid tanks suck so now only plays with warriors?
---
If your healers are undergeared or your raid is low on healers, all you'd be doing is trading a bit of damage for the life of your melee.  If that's the case you are better off waiting for execute.
---
It's a good idea, but my guild is short 6 healers, so for us it doesn't make a lot of sense.
---
More confused by the cast bars.  You found an add on that shows the enemy cast bar?  Or is this retail?
---
The MT should never raid lead or be loot master, the raid leader should never be loot master. End of story

While I get that mods don‚Äôt always do things perfectly, comments and attitudes like this are why I no longer do community admin or moderation.
---
Used to be a game and forum admin for a massive gaming community, spent hundreds of hours working to make it an enjoyable place for everyone... you would not believe how many people there are out there who want to destroy everything they can just because they can, or because they have absolutely no consideration of anybody but themselves.. simply viewing such places as there for their own enjoyment only regardless of how it hurts others.
---
And the thanks you get is... well nothing. You‚Äôre constantly insulted, accused of power tripping, always on trial, and heaven fucking help you if you actually made a mistake. Then on top of that your average edgy forum poster loves to comment about how the mods are all sad little nerds with nothing else to cling to, while having *no idea* just how bad things tend to get without an active moderation team and how important the ‚Äústupid‚Äù rules actually are.
---
But such is the internet... as I said, there‚Äôs a reason I don‚Äôt do it any more.

IMO PVP Rankings need a rework, the only people getting rank 14 are account sharing for weeks at a time.

Thanks for your insight, dude! was looking more for fight breakdowns and guides along w/ some tips to make this work. but, any and all commentary on the subject is worthwhile l!
---
Please show me where did I mention end-game raids. You can play however you want, but if you only willing to DPS as a hybrid while doing leveling Dungeons, I'd rather not have you in my group.
---
I have herbalism. Do you just stay along the edges? The middle seems like a deathtrap

Dude the scares I had with Diremaul pats in the past couple hours is real, praying that they won't aggro while I try to dodge 3 treant pats at once is exhilarating
---
&gt; It is based off weapon damage, so of course it's going to be underwhelming at 40.
---
Explain how that even makes sense.  There are both fast and slow weapons at 40, so any argument you could make using a level 60 weapon could be made with a level 40 weapon.
---
A lot of people expect it for free. I will leave group if they dont tip something, dont care what. But it takes time to make and meet up. I don't know why people expect that for nothing.

Edit: For clarity, I was specifically commenting on when you get random whispers or invites in cities or out grinding/farming. I never expect a tip when grouping for a raid or dungeon.

This is my real account, fuck Grizzly.

The Dark Leather Handwraps go for about 1.25g on my server. Those mats cost around 80s. Much less if you save your spider silk
---
I came back to for classic, I am seriously considering going to retail. I just want to run all the top level dungeons though, I loved all that stuff when I used to level it cata.
---
Heh, I'm on Westfall. Ours is &lt;Your Mothers a Horde&gt;
---
That's the case for every mage, every spec. What type of mage just autoattacks??
---
I haven't been able to use Details in a long time either. It was working for the first week or so of classic, but then it stopped. Every time I try to use it I get the message "Details failed to load, reload ui and try again" in my chat, but when I reload it says the same thing.
---
I've uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times, including downloading different versions. Also tried different sources (Twitch App, wowinterface, Curse). Not sure what to do to make it work.
---
Same with Hinterlands.
---
How much better is an azuresong mageblade compared to a staff of dominance? Currently would be wearing a 20 spell power offhand with the blade, so its 20 spellpower or 25int 9stam. 
---
For a mage, arcane spec at the moment
---
Not everyone has plenty of time when they‚Äôre gaming. When people join a party for a dungeon they should be quick to get there. I‚Äôm usually tanking and I‚Äôll typically advertise that people need to be close before joining. Everyone decides to fucking run errands when they join a group for some reason
---
Disgaea 2 and on stopped heal dodges.
---
1160 mana. It does not scale.

I hope that one day you're the final boss
---
To be honest, the biggest piece of misinformation is that main tanks need to be defence-capped, so they can avoid crit/crush. They don't. With decent gear there really aren't any bosses who are going to one-shot you, and healers can pump out so much healing that it doesn't really matter. [Skarmtank](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5xSfo5nMGSmv00sGpRN7SQ) has a great series of guides and videos on tanking, and as a bear he's tanked every fight in vanilla, including all of Naxx. 
---
Now, as to feral viability. Druid tanks aren't worse than Warrior tanks because we can't get defence capped. We're worse because we don't have access to the cooldowns Warriors have. Some raid fights are much, much easier if you can pop Shield-Wall, or berserker rage to become fear immune. Druids don't have any of that. 
---
What we *do* have is insane threat. Maul has an absolutely bonkers threat modifier on it, and due to the way Dire Bear Form works, our threat gear doubles as mitigation gear. Probably no warrior would dream of main tanking wearing Devilsaur leather, but we can and do. To equal our threat output, warriors have to take off their mitigation gear and put on threat gear, which makes them more squishy. 
---
What this all adds up to is that Druids typically aren't the main tank for raids. We can main-tank some fights really well, especially threat fights or resist fights. Threat fights because we put out so much threat without sacrificing mitigation, and resist fights because we can put on resist gear without sacrificing mitigation, because most of our mitigation comes from Dire Bear Form's massive armour modifier boost. There's also special mention for Jin'do the Hexxer in Zul'Gurrub, who is typically a very difficult fight because of his ability to hex the main tank. However, since we're immune to that, we make the encounter trivial. But overall however, most guilds will stick with a Warrior for MT duty. 
---
Where we really excel is off-tanking. Many raid fights, not to mention the majority of trash, require off-tanks, and a tank-spec druid does this role superbly. Not only does our exceptional threat mean that the mobs typically won't peel, disrupting the raid, but crucially we're not another warrior soaking up gear. Warriors are extremely popular in raids due to their insane damage output and exceptional tanking abilities, but gearing them all up is a nightmare. Having an off-tank who only soaks up gear no-one else wants, or whose best gear is typically quest rewards and dungeon loot, means the warriors in the guild get geared that much faster.
---
I was looking for this!!! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
You want to know what it‚Äôs entitlement like this that make the good warriors hate everyone but their pocket healer. Seriously everyone bitching about loot, group comp to limit loot competition etc drives me absolutely nuts. Wanna know what‚Äôs fun imagine being a 60 warrior in 85% pbis  where you can‚Äôt farm in the open world effectively and most dungeons don‚Äôt give you an upgrade. Your either running for the chance at drops to feed the gold stack that dwindles. While your doing that your expected to carry children that make your life miserable yeh sorry not sorry dps run good tanks off. The ones reserving an orc honestly could probably just not tank but they figure you get your pbis they get a little gold infusion that can be used up after several wipes.

rogue kills other tiger while the new one is stunned then mage attacks. Rogue vanished, some of the very little aggro that was put on the tiger is lost or Mage's ae hit tiger for more damage than the rogue did to it, pulling aggro. tiger doesnt care about rogue any more, mage doesnt cc tiger, tiger focuses mage and rogue isnt technically its enemy anymore. win win
---
Ultimately its just a comparison of each racial and the significance of their benefits, as well as the implications. 10% stam is effectively just a 10% security net. Outside of that just more healing requirement. No effect on threat, mitigation, or anything else tanking related. Much less significant than 3% hit and an itemslot that could otherwise be dedicated toward other stats including potential set bonuses, etc.
---
Mulgore : "Where is Arra'chea ?" "Have you seen Arra'chea ?"
---
Now, maybe. Back in the day, alts weren't as much of a thing because it was just too time consuming to do it.
---
Did you account for the downrank nerf to +healing
---
Build up more aggro first. Paladins are the generally masters of keeping aggro once they've got it, but if you're being out-leveled by your DPS you may need more time to get more aggro, to let more ticks of Concecration go through.
---
If they're your friends, you should have no problem getting them to hold their dicks in their pants for a few extra seconds, unlike PUGs who will probably kick you for the mere suggestion of less DPS.  
---
It'll get a fair bit easier once you've caught up to levels in them and got more ranks in Consecration, and access to Holy Shield as well. Unfortunately, your goal is to simply make sure you don't lose aggro at all (because you have, as you've noted, no taunt.) If you have a Mage, get him to help kite that mob. Frost Nova, and slows.
---
&gt;No where
---
English?

Not yet, you‚Äôll pick it up from your class trainer.

Skeram is far from dead.  We'll have a few rank 14s alli side.  We have more competitive pvprs on alli than horde.

The only bans I've heard of were those traveling between continents. If you're worried use an authentication to eliminate it.
---
Shaman goes out of mana really quick so raiding without a deep Restoration build to access Mana Tide Totem is a bit annoying in phase 1 raids when you are still missing a bunch of epic gear from bosses, but since Mana Tide Totem doesn't scale with your maximum mana it becomes a weak totem later into the game so you aren't missing much by skipping it.
---
I am currently playing with a deep Restoration build but once phase 2 or 3 launches I'll respec to elemental but still play as a healer in raids.
---
Yeah and it only ever got worse when meeting stones let you summon. Suddenly 4 party members all decided they‚Äôd just wait for a summon.
---
Friend plays a lock and we have the same issue... it‚Äôs nice when you can get summoned but when you join a group, start heading over right away.
---
Or in my case yesterday j was looking for Essenz of water and some dude whispered me with a price 6 gold above AH price. He then told me that it's normal that it's more expensive and it's probably my age because I'm not 'getting it'

Using an autocorrect to deflect from answering doesn‚Äôt help your argument. I think you should reread your comments if you think a single spelling mistake is an issue.

So for the 3rd time - where did you link to source which handles visual area scans? I really can‚Äôt tell if you don‚Äôt realize you‚Äôre wrong or if you‚Äôre just unable to ever admit being wrong.

Lol :D

Wow what an intense virgin, we didnt even have those specs or this mentality back then.

I literally worked hard everyday to verify the classic experience is being followed

Im lvl 1 and I just got my first bar of exp, my plan is to really explore the world and build connections. Please read my 4000 page essay on etiquette in low level dungeons
---
What has everyone's play time been to reach level 60?
---
Also all of the /roll pictures taken on phones
---
Not everyone only wants to play the spec with absolute maximum dps.
---
This spreadsheet should be including both the below level 20 spell rank penalty and the under 3 second cast time penalty for +healing, it is in column R. I'm probably going to update the sheet to be more clear about the intermediate calculation formula on that cell, especially if I do other classes.
---
As the sheet is now, I skipped some of the intermediate calcs and just stole known good hpower coefficients for the sake of time.
---
I wouldn't actually bank too much on twink items going up that much. People _know_ for a fact that twinking is coming. They're going to be buying now, picking up anything listed for cheap. I'd actually reckon that supply is going to out-do demand by the time Phase 3 lands.

Hey
---
The Furbolg Challenge
---
I like it. That's a new game to play in the game.
---
there's a lot of safe space close to pillars/trees/random things, my route was probably not optimal but i farmed 7 packs of lashers per instance then reset, and yes i do use an alt or ask friends to reset.
---
It's happened, quite a bit actually, but from what I've seen it was always people traveling between continents. Though it's been stated if you use an authenticator or authenticator app you won't be banned.
---
No worries!  I rejoice your news from the future, Happy Hallow's End!
---
The answer to this question determines if endgame is even worth playing.
---
don't agree on that :)
---
Hmmm so it sounds like I should stick with speed only. Are you walking pretty closely in front of mobs that are a higher level than you? Or when?
---
Yeah ally experience at 60 ain't bad there, and come phase 2 we'll actually be able to rank.
---
Hi, I have a question about warrior's sunder armor. Does sunder armor proc weapon proc? (Such as Axe of the Deep Wood), does sunder armor proc Hand of Justice / Sword Specialization / Windfury totem? (So gaining 1 extra attack). I have tested it myself and couldn't see any proc, yet maybe my sample size is too small. Does anyone know the answer? Thanks.
---
Nothing to see here. Just a troll.
---
At least pick a topic people will get upset about like hong kong. 3/10
---
It's in my OP, check the screen shot. Combat log API failed to scan the druid, yet she still showed up on Spy.
---
Never realized how thick dwarves legs are..
---
I just started one after hitting 60 on my main to play with my dad who‚Äôs not on that often, I just didn‚Äôt think about alts until then really. 
---
Play how you want but for me when finding a group for 60 isn‚Äôt working out I‚Äôll hop onto my alt and when something in LFG chat pops up I switch back over. Also, if you have limited play time and just want to mess around alts I think are great for that. Dungeons at 60 seem to have a much longer time commitment.
---
Why would they cry about it? I‚Äôm sure there are lots of people who would rather transfer their main than start from scratch again
---
That‚Äôs been me before. I‚Äôll join the group but after I‚Äôve been sitting outside the instance for 40 minutes and everyone is ‚Äújust heading over‚Äù still, I will 100% bail for another group.
---
When you get invited, start heading over. You can‚Äôt always be the one who arrives last and things start 10 seconds later.
---
I charge 10g for crusader and 15g for spellpower.  They're not terribly rare on my server
---
My only experience with them was Nost. They got server first MC/Ony, trolled, talked unreal amounts of shit, then collapsed before BWL came out.
---
That's how Boss Ross would emote, to let everyone know they were noticed.
---
Where's the top-right one from?
---
Oh I did let them know, I can see why they're upset though. The PBD in our realm shot up over 400% in price
---
I'm in the Dustwallow Marsh Yacht Club
---
If you dont have auctionator, hold LShift and right click and item to split it.
---
I am the same level as you man im 31/0/19 atm for ele mastery, (Which is so fun with 1shotting certain people) but once 60 go respec so you can get Nature swiftness. Shamans are in raids for just their Totems and raid wide healing. Nothing special. and Deep resto is really not all that great.
---
Beauty to the 30/0/21 is the fact you can DPS in Bg's and heal in PVE...  its great since you don't need to respec all the time :)
---
Holy smokes these quests aren‚Äôt added until phase 4? Wow.
---
This afternoon, I was on an Uldaman run with a 2H war tank. He thought he was invincible because the healer was good and I sometimes healed too (enh sham).
---
Passed a certain point, the trash mobs hit like a truck and our "nice" tank said "the DMG OMG"... Yeah... OMG...
---
Even though the mage and I strongly implied the sword and board tanking, our warrior maintained his idea, even on the boss. The healer cried tears of blood in the end.
---
It's not fun for a healer to have to drink after each and every pack because the tank doesn't understand that, after a certain point in an instance, he can't tank with a 2H.
---
Edit : and the best part in all this is that he couldn't maintain aggro, the healer had to tank repeatedly.
---
Then go roll warrior go see how easily the game hands a bad warrior everything.
---
There's a coefficient associated with downranking itself.
---
Down ranking itself, is a nerf. At level 60, Rank 8 of Healing Touch and below, suffers from this nerf
---
The math is: (MIN(1,(sLvL - 11)/cLvL)) * +healing
---
sLvL = Spell Level
---
cLvL = Caster Level
---
I do this often in 5 mans as a prot warrior.
---
That was less "dream dust" and more like "blue crystal shards" but we'll allow it.
---
Incendius is a great server and although I believe horde are favored on it I have personally never felt overwhelmed by the amount of horde in any given zone.. always alliance in /yell distance to come help out
---
I just love that I remember people arguing about it 15 years back and it still continues! I was also undead on Firetree, mage, a dirty pugger
---
Are twinks a thing yet? I keep reading mixed things on this sub about it. It's a few phases till we actually have PvP BGs right? Further is exp cap possible? I know the exp lock was a much later feature...
---
AB is not fast if you can‚Äôt 5 cap, 3-2 takes for-ever.
---
This is all very true. I was in several groups every day around the vendor because it's what you do.  An invite comes in and you join the group so the others can see who is getting patterns and when... so as not to waste time pressing buttons.
---
Which doesnt change the fact that you refuse to answer anyone
---
Too early to say.  Generic response is depends on your server economy.  They are BiS so they‚Äôll be worth a fair amount.  I would hold onto them until P3 and see how many hit the AH then and base it off that.
---
once ran strath and the healer was in thunderbluff, went to ratchet, took boat from ratchet to booty bay then flew to EPL.   Everyone else was at the instance already, took about 35 minutes to wait for healer, with the BB -&gt; EPL flight taking ~20 minutes of that.
---
the other dude is actually right tho
---
Yes I do.
---
Paladins effectively get mana back from crits and mp5 rather than spirit as they don‚Äôt have a talent that allows mana to Regen in combat in the same way as priests do for example
---

A follow up question, does anyone have suggestions for good tanking weapons around my level? I feel like I really need an upgrade.
---
As a warlock who somehow pulls aggro as bottom DPS, please no.  I have on niche, let me keep it!
---
Sulfuras has been pretty nice so far and a lot of funny dudes I‚Äôve met.
---
r/niceguys
---
That's the Cata version. Darkwhisper Gorge doesn't look like that in Classic
---
That screenshot is from Cata, the architecture is from the Twilight's Hammer areas.
---
Spirit has an effect of natural regen, which doesn't happen for five seconds after cast. Better to pump Int and +heal. Int for the Mana pool and to get more crit heals which give 100% mp for the spell returned to you with talent.
---
^^ My favorite comment so far
---
DM has class specific quests that you get from looting a rare book. The chain rewards class specific trinkets. Details on the wow head dungeon guide. The quest item is lvl 54.
---
It honestly just looks like ElvUi with maybe different raid frames?
---
Feral druid must be the least appreciated spec for raiding.

All trolling aside ‚Äúthat‚Äôs classic‚Äù
---
And also you won't hit too much natural regen because you'll be spamming flash of light all the time. Sorry I forgot that. Better to have mp5 because you'll get that regen casting or not.
---
Pallies get mana back by crits so sprit is the last thing you gear for. Int, crit,   &amp;  +healing are priorities.
---
I leveled guns on trash in raids during vanilla

I only made it through like 3 bosses before they realized it and kicked me though

Slow and steady. Make sure people are aware of where adds are to not butt pull. Pull packs to you instead of running to them. Ready checks are your friend. Basically anything to avoid a wipe that could otherwise have been avoided. And keep comms clear of random chit chat.
---
God damm this is spot on. 
---
&gt; make them their portal. its somewhere I dont need to go
---
Fucking always. Why is that?!
---
Ah - I never went there in Classic. I got close years ago but the ice giants kind of scared me off... it's been a long time since.
---
Holy shit how is Funny Junk not dead yet.
---
Thank you!!
---
I have answered every question. There's been 145 comments made, most of the questions for me I've already answered in a different comment. It's like you're hoping I'm going to answer the same question again, but this time mess up or something. Not going to happen. I'm right and I've proven it - sorry.
---
But if you go too hard you cross the threshold where people don't know if it's sarcasm or not. Diminishing returns and whatnot. It's a delicate balance.
---
But in this case, where a comma changes the meaning of a sentence, you're simply wrong in your original comment.  He punctuates when it's necessary.
---
Also.. don't be a rogue.
---
You know that each subreddit is moderated by different people from those communities and are both volunteers and have nothing to do with each other or Reddit as a company right?
---
8-10 days is average for people who focused on leveling and didn't spend a lot of time messing around. Its hard to go a lot faster unless you are on the front end of the leveling curve on a new server AND/OR experienced with the 1-60 leveling experience.
---
It's a matter of lots of people not using proper punctuation in game. People type shit out quickly, so a missed comma isn't exactly rare.
---
Wow. You have some personal work to do, that much is obvious.
---
Wish you the best, have a nice day, I'm going to see myself out of this conversation.
---
If you pull it up and CTRL + U the full source is there.

Feel free to DM me a pastebin or something with changes you make and I'll check them out and push them live if they're good :)
---
"WAHH WAHH JUST LET ME PLAY WITH A GIMPED SPEC WAHH"
---
Okay. Have fun taking 20 days /played to hit 60.
---
The reason that you don't want spirit as a paladin is because all your spells (except holy shock) are casts and spirit does not work when casting. Paladins favor Mp5 for this reason (Mana per 5 Seconds). Additionally, there are talents for other healers that allow 15% of their mana regeneration from spirit to still work while they cast, paladins have no such talent.
---
There is something to be said about spirit while leveling though. Maybe you find that you really don't need all that extra healing, in which case the spirit will reduce downtime. +28 spirit is quite a lot and maybe you'll find yourself in a dungeon group that is easy to heal, but often waiting on you to drink. That spirit would reduce the time you spend drinking.
---
tl;dr: The +healing is better, but every item has it's place.
---
Are you using a start attack macro? Stormstrike doesn't automatically start your auto attack. If you use a macro for it, you'll swing twice, giving you a decent chance to WF and esplode someone.
---
Rogue si for sure metal/good 90s grunge
---
Someone with much more knowledge on this will need to elaborate, but I believe it runs some kind of /who command and collects the data into a specific file.
---
Then you upload the file to the site and it begins to aggregate it.

---
how much gold per hour is this?
---
Oh nice. Thx :)
---
Yes, full prot (I play the basic bitch Impale/Shield Slam build). I have a shitload of gear, and I spam Cleave/WW on multi-target packs. I also snipe mobs with Execute. I can do like 300-400 DPS on pulls, especially if I get enough time for aggro so the mobs stick to me and keep feeding me rage. My ST DPS in Defensive Stance is only like 150-200 depending on procs (I have HoJ/Ironfoe). I also did over 400 DPS on Golemagg (single target) this week.

&gt; Listing fees come out of your cash on hand and are paid whether the item sells or not
---
What? This is blatantly false, the deposit comes back to you if the item sells. It shows this in the mail the AH sends you.
---
lmao you perfectly described my dungeon experience
---
Yees because slam resets your swing timer. Allowing you to speed up attacks why swing -&gt; slam -&gt; swing relatively fast
---
Those pants are killing your outfit but you look pretty cool
---
I remember questing in Un'Goro and receiving 28 whispers within an hour of people wanting food and/or drinks. No tips and not responding quick enough would result in snarky comments. After that, declaring I required payment, no one suddenly wanted it anymore. At 60, people are way less stingy about it.
---
This, but unironically. I wish the horde was more of an "evil" faction. That was a huge draw for me to start playing, but turns out they just look like bad guys.
---
Every game ever has you be the righteous morally correct benevolent character, would be pretty sick to play a straight up bloodthirsty faction that doesn't give a shit about anything else other than taking land and resources for themselves.
---
Ah, another savvy gentlemen wearing the ripped ogre loincloth. I approve.
---
Wait, you talking dungeon groups? Do you leave if they don't tip you for mage water in dungeons?
---
If that's the case, I should start charging mages for heals and shields lol.
---
Oh god must be on my side! I've made 800g in 2 days worth of farming!
---
You kidding? I'm keeping you in my group because I needs my soulstone. The fuck if I'm running from the graveyard because the mage pulled a pat while aoeing.
---
lol wait you mean the dumpster fire of a company named blizzard right now? The company who is banning people who choose to use their freedom of speech to support an important cause? Fuck out of here with this stupid ass comment.
---
Jelqgirth from pagle alliance here, what‚Äôs your toons name?
---
those 5 hours was only that day, ive been farming brd since i hit 60 like 1 month Ago so combined its probably close to 150 runs by now
---
Absolutely not. If in a group I make water/food for everyone and certainly dont expect a tip. I mean getting invites by randoms or whispers from randoms in cities, out farming, etc. If I have to find you and make the water because you asked, I am happy to, but that cost me money in some form by taking that time so at least tip something.
---
Wait until you try out Aimed Shot, windfury shadows in comparison.
---
I see, it seems like if I use hamstring, then I can get proc (cause hamstring did tiny amount of damage, yet sunder did 0). Maybe it requires damages to make those proc to work.
---
This is some retail-scrub level meme
---
It's definitely reputation. He probably has the dwarf discount but not the human discount.
---
He's a tard. What he's talking about is basically irrelevant until you hit 60.
---
There's a feature where when duel wielding, your offhand won't miss when heroic strike is queued up. So some people abuse this and queue up HS then cancel before it goes off. This makes your offhand weapon land more hits.
---
Again, we've already gone over this. The combat log you see in your chat originates from the COMBAT_LOG_EVENT. But that's still not the entire combat log. The entire combat log comes from COMBAT_LOG_EVENT_UNFILTERED. You do not ever see the full, unfiltered combat log in your chat unless you have an addon which listens for and parses the COMBAT_LOG_EVENT_UNFILTERED event into a chat channel.
---
Do you not understand that? I linked you to the API docs which specifically states this and also commented about it to bring your attention to it.
---
Yeah deserves to be removed. Use the daily questions thread or go toggle and type the question in followed by the word reddit.
---
Am I missing something? Why would they not fly to Org and take the Org to UC zeppelin?
---
what a gronk lol
---
You can whisper him. He's in your faction.
---
Hearth to booty bay, cast water walking and start running north up the coast fishing. If I see some one else doing the same, if they‚Äôre going southbound ignore them. If they‚Äôre northbound, run a 100 yards up so I can clear all the fishing spots before them. Continue all the way to gromgol then fly back to booty. Repeat.
---
I don‚Äôt interfere with other people fishing in the same area (fishing in their pool or whatever) but I will change my strategy so that they end up just following a short distance behind me and find no pool unfished. 
---
Bonus: if they whisper me talking shit, I fish the pools down until I feel they have one more cast in them and then leave it for them to find. Always funny to watch.
---
But by then you're mounted
---
Yes, that would be roughly what I'm talking about.
---
What‚Äôs that one, I wanna see if I fit.
---
Start an alt on a PvP server and if your friends get near your warrior do some dungeons together. No reason you can't play both.
---
You are perfectly justified in telling me everything that you did. The fact of the matter is that whether it is me or someone else you will not be able to walk up and buy this pattern at any point in phase 1 or for most of phase 2. You can hate the farmers all you want but they exist because of the problem that is Qia. 
---
You can say the same of any limited supply. People cry to managers when entire families camp out at Best Buy for the new console and  buy 6 of them to flip on eBay. The market exists for a reason. If the pattern were unlimited like mooncloth you wouldn't be here and neither would I.
---
For the record, the amount of time you have spent trying to get the pattern would have been better spent fishing up essences of water in azshara, farming robe of the archmage solo in lbrs, killing elementals in silithus, or popping into brd for some quick elemental fire. You could have had 40g in half an hour, bought the pattern, and been done with it.
---
PALS FOR LIFE is a popular guild on my server
---
It wouldn't be really hard for ppl to make groups and kill mafia how hated they are.The thing is when alliance guy is tagging you ,you cant skin and you cant interupt your faction thats colluding for them to skin.This is why its unfair
---
I've found the middle ground.
---
I named myself Faucet.
---
I tell them if they want water they need to turn me on.
---
:( Nobody complies.
---
thats... not how any of that works. WP
---
Is there a way to know what are the √≠tems in high demand? Like knowing wich ones has been bought in the last 72 hours?
---
The Cataclysm version of Mt Hyjal.
---
Dont know what addons you have, but have you tried turning them off one at a time to see if it could be one of those.
---
There is a way. If someone else spots you or targets you then you'll be added to their list and then shared with your friend. Go out somewhere under a flight path where people aren't at, stand still for a while, and visually watch the flight path. You'll see some will show up on spy and some wont. If you're by a zone border then they'll show up because Spy also watches for the ZONE_CHANGE_EVENT [as seen here.](https://github.com/welpenhund/Spy/blob/master/Spy.lua#L1278)
---
Can you transfer bank alts?
---
You best be at least heading there as soon as you can. Had a player raging at me for kicking him because he took 15 minutes to start heading over. We were already at the final boss by the time he got there off his flight path.
---
Haha nice. I'm the same with lockpicking.. I don't charge. People will tip where they can and I'm grateful when they do, but if you can't afford it I'm not that bothered.
---
What's amusing is all those angry mages don't understand that a huge number of those people lining up would have been paying anyway out of gratitude.
---
Not in the same way. They actually don't have a normal res in the way Priests/Shamans/Paladins do, they *only* have battle res in classic - so if you need to res more than one person before it comes off cooldown, they're outta luck and will have to run back.
---
No it's not
---
Priests pray to the light
---
But Shamans know the true god
---
Praise RNGeezus
---
I believe you are correct.
---
For sure I‚Äôll try it out when I get on thanks
---
You‚Äôre right. We raid Friday and I‚Äôm using a fist weapon and I thought getting Quel‚ÄôSerrar before raiding is more important. Sorry guys.
---
Yeah could be a good shout. My only concern is that the friends that will probably stay are 45+ now, so it‚Äôs me catching up to them as opposed to me waiting for them üò©
---
"Where's the repair guy"
---
If you get a higher end enchantment like Crusader, Spellpower, Healing or Greater Stats then you will literally be swimming in money.
---
One of the enchanters on my server has a monopoly on the +Spellpower and charges 80-100g to enchant it if you bring the mats. They're very commonly hit up and basically make more money than any farmer just being mostly AFK near a bank.
---
For enchanters that don't have crazy rare recipes, you will find that tons of other enchanters basically give away the buffs for free (or close to it).
---
Got that guild on alliance pagle üòÇüòÇ

60 Protection warrior here. When I log in, I usually get a couple requests to tank dungeons. It‚Äôs nice to be able to get into dungeons so quickly, but once you‚Äôve acquired your prebis gear, there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a reason to continue tanking dungeons other than to make money. Speaking of making money, the only advice wealthier prof tanks have given me is to advertise tanking services (which I haven‚Äôt been able to do because of the flak I‚Äôve seen them get). 
---
I went alchemy/herb, so if I‚Äôm not tanking, I‚Äôm making pots like oil of immolation to help with aoe threat. I use the opportunity when tanking dungeons to ask if any of my party members‚Äô guilds have an open spot for a tank. I‚Äôve enjoyed tanking dungeons to level, but it‚Äôs commonly known that there are few slots open for tanks in raids. So, I‚Äôve been spending the time tanking dungeons to acquire prebis gear for fury so I can secure a raiding spot as a DPS. I suppose once I do this, I‚Äôll bring myself to finally charge for tanking since I won‚Äôt be needing on loot, and I know there‚Äôs a need for tanking higher level dungeons. I‚Äôll use the money to buy enchants and consumables for raid nights! It‚Äôs fun. I‚Äôm glad I rolled warrior. It‚Äôs been rewarding as everyone said it was.

Make a new character on a PvP server. 33 is about 1/4-1/3rd of the way through the leveling process, it could be worse. The sooner you reroll the better, and with the knowledge you've gained on your warrior you can easily hit 33 again in no time.

Plot twist, you are Horde
---
In actuality:
---
~5 minutes to get 3 DPS and a healer.
---
1 hour of looking for a tank with no success. 1 DPS leaves, spot fills instantly. Spend another 0.5 hours looking for tank. Warrior joins the LF1M Tank group, then says "sorry I only DPS" when asked if they're a tank. Kick. LF Tank again. Put together a 20g bribe. Tank joins group after 15 more minutes. Tank is in group for 10 minutes, then says "sorry, GF aggro" and drops group after everyone's already flying to Feralas.
---
But do we really need all dps doing the absolute maximum? Vanilla wasn't designed with dps meters in mind. People were clearing raids just fine before they suddenly realized some people were doing shit dps.
---
I would never play on a PvE server for the reasons you have described, the PvP aspect of WoW is really the only 'challenging' aspect in the game and what makes leveling an actual challenge. 
---
That being said, if your friends are playing on a PvE server and have no intention of rerolling, you have to ask yourself a simple question. Do you have more fun playing with your friends, or do you have more fun killing every red name that walks by?
---

Need some advice on healing.
---
I'm a holy priest nearing level 60. From the beginning I've been using flash heal to heal my party but I've learned that's not efficent for raids and my mana pool, althiough It's never been an issue so far.
---
I've heard that using Heal (Rank 3) is the best spell to use unless the tank is taking heavy damage. Is this true? If so, what spells and ranks should I really be using to make the most of my mana pool.
---
The amount of people who don‚Äôt know that portals cost mages money is insane, and thing we are just trying to take whatever we can. 
---
My usual price for a higher lvl is 1g if it‚Äôs like a lvl 20 or something trying to get somewhere I‚Äôll be nice and just charge them the vendor cost for the portal rune but anyone who complains 5g take it or leave it haha
---
\#NoChanges
---
Well the API in my screen shot says different, and that one is from the actual game so yeah.
---
You don‚Äôt really need to watch where you are as fire, and you‚Äôre never that close to death. It‚Äôs not auto attack but it‚Äôs spamming fireball.  Frost aoe requires you to react much more quickly than most specs and classes.
---
Oh yeah that's a bummer. Sounds like your friends won't be ones to quit? I'd play a good solo PVPer on another server while keep leveling your warrior (spam dungeon tanking?) To play with friends. That is if you want to... All depends on schedules. No point basing decisions around someone you only play with an hour a week.

Jeez. How many posts are you gonna make in a week? Stop this contentless nonsense. This is not Facebook

The part about holy shock not being a spell that interrupts your natural manareg is wrong.

Casting per se doesnt interrupt your manareg, spending mana does -&gt; Holy shock will interrupt the reg

Druids are worse than Warriors in every aspect of tanking. I don't know if there are any bosses where Druid outperforms Warrior.
---
Let's assume you are Horde because Alliance doesn't have an inn or flight path in STV unless you venture all the way south to Booty Bay.
---
&gt; Well the API in my screen shot says different
---
Jesus fucking christ. There is no API on your screen. An API is the code made available to addons to make use of. How are you going to act so sure about this when given proof that you don't even understand the basics of?
---
This happened to me the first time around and my friends all ended up quitting before ever getting close to cap and left me stranded on a pve server. This time around I told my irl friends what server I would be on if they wanted to play with me. I‚Äôm the only one out of 5 to be 60 with the next highest person at 39. Some people ended up not even coming to the server because it was pvp and that‚Äôs fine by me. I knew going in I would play more than any of them and I wanted to do things right this time around.
---
No!! I‚Äôm sorry haha I meant the guy in OP‚Äôs post. Just like the ones you describe. Sorry for the misunderstanding friend!
---
Lol our guild is Always Sunny in Azeroth
---
I was always pvp, this time a friend convinced me to go pve.
---
I was in the same situation as 3rd tank in guild.  I switched to a 9/31/11 fury/prot build. My mitigation is as good as heavy prot build but threat is worse.  I have tanked everything in MC (inc rag OT) with no issue - key is to never tank the focus target so you have more time to build threat. When I don‚Äôt need to tank in raids I am competitive with other melee dps (but I‚Äôve got a lot of dps pre-raid bis gear)
---
Overall it‚Äôs worse for 5 man dungeons (I have to swap in crit gear to hold agro), but allows me to be useful in all fights in raids.
---
You can also go 0/31/20 for imp threat if you are willing to give up tact mastery
---
And two Soul Stones for eyes
---
I totally agree with the edit; this is a 1000% better than a photo of a monitor. :)
---
Almost 11 days for me i level mining and blacksmith as well as√≠ a ret pala till 50 then Holy the last 10 levels
---
I don't mind, but **counter my offer**. If you want me to go first as a buyer I'm going to lowball you... please come back with a new offer instead of "NO THX" and ignoring me.  
---
Always see the same people spamming trade for the same shit hours later as well.
---
My name is cakes :) no one ever wants my cakes..except for warriors. Everyone only wants me for my god damn liter cola.
---
Its THE Winterforge Clan
---
Ok?
---
I went back to PSO on the Wii for now and it's pretty chill.
---
I've got a 44 disc priest.. questing is slow as balls.. instances though are dope cuz you can do them a couple levels early.  Don't need to be same level to land heals!
---
Auctioneer has it, along with percentages of each mat dropping.
---
Cool? Lmao
---
On my server, rattlegore, we have a guidname 'SpaceJam on VHS', I think that's the best guild name I've ever seen.
---
I have raided with them. They seemed really nice.
---
HOW ARRRRR YA!?
---
Thank you for the info. I appreciate these posts.
---
Dwarfs are always ganking..and they suck ass lol
---
Warrior should be able to find groups, always a lack of tanks!
---
28-34 or so was awful for me, lack of quests to do. I grinded a couple levels out and then have had a lot of fun since then.
---
I really recommend the add-on questi so you can see all available quests, help you know what zone to go to. I got it around level 35 and wondered wth I didn't before.
---
Turns out you might be a Druid. You still get all the fun of tanking dungeons, but you‚Äôre less gear dependent, more mobile, and get to be a caster/rogue/healer when leveling.
---
There is no API on your screen.
---
Okay. Have a look in the bottom left corner, what do you see? Is that a combat log Api? Oh, maybe don't bee so quick to judge next time and actually look at the evidence.
---
Yes, 3 of the top 4 guilds on Skeram are Alliance. Still, well over 50% of the alliance players transferred. Even guilds that originally didn't want to leave ended up leaving due to specific Horde guilds griefing.
---
you mean horrible picture taken of their screen with an 2014 mobile phone in a dark room?
---
Just hit 50 on the Mage. Does anyone have any tips for acquiring BIS or gear through 50-60 that can save me some time? I am on Arugal so hoping there are plenty of BRD groups. Also I am an enchanter and have managed to save up quite a lot of mats - Once I am 300 is it worth dropping money on a big enchant to earn some gold?
---
And with that, a mighty cheer went up from the heroes of Azeroth. They had banished the awful world tree forever, because it was haunted. Now let's all celebrate with a cool glass of moonberry juice.
---
What's wrong with that? As long as you're enjoying the game that's what matters. I'm at 300 fishing and cooking and haven't hit level 50 yet, I like doing that stuff. I've already spent nearly 5 hours opening those damn shellfish traps for my strong iron fishing pole

edit: I play a paladin and don't know anything about priests. In fact I avoided a priest because too complicated. I'm a simple man.
---
&gt;Am I missing something?
---
A username, apparently.
---
I was mostly referring to my fav PHATBOYE from OW.
---
Priests are better healers than Druids, but Druids are fine. Every raid is going to want at least one, anyway. But Druid HOTs don't stack, and they get a good portion of their healing through HOTs, so raids will always want more priests than Druids.
---
Warriors outperform Druids in every way when it comes to tanking. Druids are only even viable in raids as either bear or cat form by tediously farming MCP. I can't recommend Druid as a tank at all. I actually quit my druid and switched to Warrior full time.
---
That isn't possible. That druid showed up on somebodys combat log (NOT THE FUCKING COMBAT CHAT LOG THERE'S MORE BEHIND THE SCENES THIS IS SIMPLE TO UNDERSTAND OMG). It's literally the only way. You can read the source code to prove it to yourself. Plus there aren't many spots in flight where you're completely untargetable or invisible. Plus - I know for a fact they weren't out of range like you claim since you could still target them.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/05-22505100032-5
---
This is what I recommend to everyone playing priest 1-40 wand spec first, then spirit tap, then start going holy. This build makes your smite stronger while also improving your healing considerably. 
---
You also have some pretty good flexibility in that the only time you actually choose between improving your healing or damage first occurs at 34, which is right when you have the option be in the thick of your SM farm. If you're doing a ton of SM get the reduced healing, if you find yourself questing and soloing get the increased smite damage.
---
Shadow really isn't great before shadow form (and arguably you don't even want that until level 45 so you can keep wand spec).
---
You have that completely backwards. Frost has ice barrier and can literally stand there casting frostbolt without interruption. They have multiple frost novas and a shorter CD and basically don't have to think about their position at all, positioning is easy for them. 
---
Fire mages don't have any barrier. They have to be aware of their position and enemy's position 100% of the time or they die. 
---
Sorry dude, you obviously have only ever been a frost mage and have no idea what you're talking about.
---
WASH YER BACK
---
I'm a warlock so I'm not hurting for gold. Think I'll stash em
---
it seems that "sorry GF/wife aggroed me" replaced "sorry moms called dinner"
---
Routing is not about having an inn or FP, but yes I am horde and wasn't thinking about alliance.  That said, they get most of the same quests out of nessing camp, I just dont know where they'd get the troll quests.
---
How dare you not post something about how kind and giving this community is! That‚Äôs what this place is for... right?
---
How alive is smolderweb? A lot of people running content? I plan on going alliance if that matters.
---
you can pvp on a pve server, enable pvp but then other side must also attack you first or have theirs enabled. This might happen more often once honour system is introduced.
---
The Black Lordus
---
It's the entrance to darkwhisper gorge in southern winterspring, that picture isnt from cata.
---
I feel like this is a glimpse into my future.  11 Rend kills and counting, no Valor shoulders.  But hey, if I do 2 or 3 runs a day every day I'll get them eventually... right???
---
THEY still do do this all the time, anytime you see someone that isnt in grizzly trying to sell anything related to devilasuar, they get banned in world.
---
No.  But ideally theyd bring something that makes them desirable

---
Syndicate- Alliance
---
This is why I'm either quitting or rerolling from Kirtonos Alliance. Too many rogues and too little people or they only want mages.
---
Do this but don‚Äôt go protection, stay arms, melee cleave groups
---
Every. Single. Time. And god forbid they start heading to DM when you have 4 people... no, no, they wait until the 5th person joins and then start the trek. If I was a Warlock I would just stand outside DM making gold giving summons all day.
---
I wanted to clear the pats when I spawned him. After a similar amount of corpses I realized that they instantly respawn.
---
Ok fine you're right.
---
Why do you feel the need to constantly call me dumb, a fuckin potato etc? How difficult is it to hold a civil discussion? Have you noticed that I never name called you? Be nice to people.
---
Reroll. You're behind anyway and you sound like you enjoy pvp more. Maybe make some new friends along the way.
---
I've done the thing where you try to control a market segment by buying out any cheap competition or the entire category.  
---
It's generally not cheap and carries some risk.  In this case the risk is that Moss Agates aren't hard to farm, so eventually somebody is going to notice the prices and start doing it faster or more prolifically than you can buy them out.
---
There isn‚Äôt a right answer for everyone and only a right answer for you. 
---
If value playing with friends. I play with the same community across multiple games. I only play Classic WoW because my friends also play it. With that said, a PvE server would be a deal breaker for me in any game.
---
I raid to pvp. I PvE to pvp. I don‚Äôt play PvE MMOs for the PvE. And when I do, I usually quit after several months (e.g. FF14). If my community of gamers rolled on a PvE server, I would have played another game with them and just not played WoW. Why? I enjoy playing with friends and I also enjoy pvp. Not doing either is a deal breaker for me. 
---
But the right answer for me and the right answer for you may be different. How important is a pvp server for you? How important is playing with friends to you? And how likely is it that your friends won‚Äôt quit before you? All these matter. And we all know which of our friends are more likely to quit than others. 
---
Make the right decision for you and stop worrying about what others will do. There isn‚Äôt a right decision here that applies to everyone.
---
I had a similar spec to you when I was leveling.  I went into the shadow tree until I got 3/5 shadow resist against mobs and 2/2 swp and then just went as far into disc with mana reduction/mp5 talents.
---
Haha what a loser of a comment this is. Yikers
---
Yeah I've been playing with the "Classic" preset the whole time. The graphics still hold up well imo.
---
RNGesus bless thee. Get your shoulders!
---
Is the horseman in the SM GY?
---
So you‚Äôre playing WoW on a Nintendo DS
---
The book price will almost certainly go down in value, 70g is quite expensive because the demand right now is massive while the supply has only had like 2~ days to build. 
---
Unless you desperately need it, I'd suggest wait a few weeks and then buy it, and who knows you might even get HoJ while waiting for it. 
---
That being said, the FR is nice for a trinket and if you are a melee in MC it's going to be very helpful, but you can always just smash Greater Fire Protection potions and stack fire resist gear on other slots. 
---
If you really want it and don't want to shell out the gold, you can always try stealth runs to the tomes... I vaguely recall they used to work.
---
Smolderweb Whitemane or Blaumeux which is the better realm?
---
A lot of times I get a better price than expected by just asking people to make an offer, yes I am selling the item but you WANT the item. I got all the time in the world.
---
No problem! Thanks for the reply :)
---
Could a 59 war in arms/fury spec (31/19/0) with 4.1k hp unbuffed tank DM if they slap on a decent shield and 1hander?
---
Better feeling is when you clap someone trynna yoink it
---
I've ninjad lotuses and had ninja attempts on my lotus
---
I always feel scum after I ninja , but doggy dog world
---
Better feeling is def defending a node you found first
---
Besides the swing timers, there are many macros that are so valuable, they might as well be required. /start attack on most of your skills is good to have. Stance dancing macros are useful. Taunt macros, etc.
---
I joined a group yesterday, making it a 5 man party so I‚Äôm thinking everyone is going to head to dire maul and we can get started.  I always give 10-15 minutes for travel.   20 minutes goes by and the priest and his friend are still in east plaguelands.  
---
He goes ‚Äúguys it‚Äôs gonna be 30 minutes we have to do this completely unrelated quest‚Äù
---
Wtf?  What is with people who think making your party member should wait that long is okay.  
---
I whispered the warrior who was already at dm with me and we instantly got into a group and ran DM north tribute runs.
---
I don't know I just did it as I was going. If a profession was seriously lacking I spent a bit of time on AH. stuff was really cheap at the beginning because the AH was flooded with the mats.
---
Level 60 Rogue:
---
* Farming
---
  * Respec after raid night and sit in BRD doin pickpocket / solo kills for a few hours. Average-ish gold farm but it's all I got.
---
  * Sit in the auction house for 30 minutes and make more money.
---
* Raiding
---
  * Go daggers partly because it's fun, but also because I will never ever see a single sword given to a rogue before more than half the warriors have theirs.
---
  * Spec into Combat Daggers. Wish I could go seal fate, but know that the dps isn't going to be adequate until at least BWL.
---
  * Wish I didn't die so much in baron's room.
---
  * Wish these warriors didn't outperform me with less gear.
---
  * Wonder if I suck.
---
  * Wonder what the fuck Blizzard was thinking.
---
  * Accept that this is just how things are in Classic.
---
* Sight Seeing
---
  * If I see a clothy under level 45, I ambush them. If they live, I move on.
---
  * They don't usually live. (I got me a perds early on :D)
---
  * If bored with nothing to do, hang out in booty bay.
---
  * Sit in unguarded areas or wait on guard patrols.
---
  * No guards, low level horde?
---
  * ***Kill Them***
---
* Grouping
---
  * I want to group and farm pre-bis items. All of my items have incredibly low drop chance and are highly competitive.
---
  * Know that joining groups is both highly unlikely, as well as a very risky gamble.
---
  * Start directly whispering mages, warlocks, and priests. Sometimes I lie about having X role in the group with the intentions of finding them later.
---
  * Invite multiple people all at the same time to give the illusion that the group existed before they were invited.
---
  * Try to never accept random rogues or warrior dps to any group I form.
---
  * Never join groups that I know have these people already unless I know that they will keep coming after they get the item we're competing for.
---
  * Whisper warriors and occasionally druids if they want to tank. Deep down I wish I could say "X on res" or "Do you still need X?", but know that I must take whatever I can get at all costs.
---
  * The tank is not wearing what I need. He ***will*** roll on it.
---
  * The item doesn't drop so there was no point to it all anyways.
---
  * *Rinse and repeat*
---
Well done dude, that is indeed a cool set to have!
---
So Grob can't transfer to DD? That sucks.
---
Okay then. Hope you and your bad guild get your mess together and learn to be mildly decent.
---
If you haven't gotten resolved yet, it might be related to a parental controls issue- that's how the character shop button to show up on my account. 
---
If you don't have access to the parental controls or parental controls account then you just needs to send a support ticket to Blizz w/ attached pic of ID for them to remove all parental controls.
---
Lol fucking loser
---
Good...good...let the hate flow through you
---
\&gt;didn't land on GM Island
---
totally fake
---
I log in.  I create a group for UBRS.  We kill Rend Blackhand.  Dal‚Äôrends mainhand doesn‚Äôt drop.  I finish out the dungeon.  I create another group.  This is all I have done for the past 3 weeks.
---
There really isn't enough content at 60 in the game right now. We need pvp!!
---
YES PLEASE. It's hard to sell fish on the AH right now, please fucking buy it!
---
wow my math was really off there lol. So, it doesn't seem like too bad of a penalty then.
---
Ice barrier AND Mana shield exhibit this behavior sometimes. The only fix I have found is to reapply the shield. It seems the shield behavior works (dmg to shield is applied before dmg to players health) but the spell casting interruption occasionally bugs. We are talking roughly 5% of the time
---
I never made a claim that the alliance pop on Earthfury is larger than Skeram, I claimed they were comparable. Anecdotally, it definitely feels that way to me in terms of LFG, guilds, pug raids, "eye test" etc. The only thing that is noticeably different is the number of auctions in the AH. Last scan i did on Skeram was 20k auctions, and my last Earthfury scan had 14k. If you were basing your population purely on Auction data, that would say Earthfury Alliance is sitting at around 70% of Alliance population of Skeram, which I would consider "comparable"
---
I have my hearth set to feather moon stronghold as alliance because it‚Äôs so fast.  Not only that but if I am looking to do a dungeon I will head there as I look for a group.
---
Everyone should be doing this.
---
i ran that place so many times on my vanilla paladin that he has a runeblade.
---
idk man i see vaginas in those knees. they have clits n everything
---
Do they have chicken?
---
OP said he only has "a few addons" so that doesn't seem necessary
---
Wondering if I can jump on the back of this to ask a question regarding tanking SM.
---
My warrior just hit 30.
---
What level should I be before attempting to tank each wing?
---
Currently due to the retail base, you can‚Äôt some update broke the ability for addons to do this on the retail client.
---
My post wasn't about that.   It's about how many keypresses your keyboard will allow you to input simultaneously.  Your individual experience may not be repeatable on poorer hardware that allows fewer simultaneous keypresses
---
20-30g. I've had a few runs where I've gotten a bunch of star rubies that really bring the amount of gold you make up.
---
Deviant Delight is rp pvp and alliance favored
---
Probably enchanting, even level 1 enchanting just to disenchant the blues you can farm from Mara and sell the mats...obviously will depend how much those shards go for on your server but worth looking into
---
There were moments that I did get outnumbered personally 10 to 1, especially in the Shimmering Flats. Nowhere did I say the server population is 10 to 1, only my personal experiences were being vastly outnumbered to this degree.
---
Why do you want to leave Everlook?
---
It can work fine. Many guilds and raids have made it work.
---
Tfw you get the double Healthstone + potion crit /r/2healthbars (or 3 if you are a lock)
---
late to the party but letting you know lures are also helpful even if you're in a place you're properly skilled for. You might fish up chests every now and then, and you can fail getting them without a lure. Not always, but those aren't worth losing because they can be a great way to make gold as they drop bolts of cloth(which cloth depends on the level of chest), random items, health and mana pots, and a few other things. It's always better to have a lure just in case
---
Well at least you weren't a dick about it.
---
Oh wait.....
---
LF1M DM - just need tank and g2g
---
Shaman right now I'm doing the quest for Hydraxian waterlords, Ony attunment and farm some dungeons for items meanwhile.
---
Right now I have my hearthstone in Kargath. So when I logged in, my guild invited me for an UBRS run, ported to Kargath, did UBRS. Then ported back to Kargath with Ancestral Spirit, paid a mage for a port to UC, gave that gnome my quest, ported back to Kargath with Hearthstone, paid a mage to port me to OG.
---
Aside from questing I'm currently mainly standing in Dire Maul and try to find DM West groups because all my good shit drops there.
---
&gt; I targetted her off of spy, holy crap you're dumb
---
&gt; Turns out you didn't read the source code, who would've thought?!
---
&gt; Are you like 5 or something?
---
&gt; This may be the definition of projection my dude.
---
&gt; A quick google could save you the embarrassment
---
&gt; You're not the sharpest tool, huh?
---
You went for hours telling people they were wrong while ignoring the proof that you were in fact wrong the entire time. You lied about pointing out in source that the addon visually scans. For a long time. Those quotes are from you to other people - I treat dicks like they treat others. You're inability to process comments, your ability to double down so far, and your incapacity to event accept that others might be right is infuriating. Go read my original replies. I was nice and went out of my way to provide actual proof in code.
---
Hardest part of playing a warlock is walking to every dungeon. The second hardest part is convincing two of your party members to come help summon.
---
Arrrrrgh press, WINDOWS KEY + SHIFT + S , OMFG! oki.. sorry this is the 102835th time I saw a a pic of a montior on reddit, I just snapped : (
---
In wrath I wanted to farm valor as a vanity set on my DK. I killed baron 94 times before the legs dropped.
---
I got the mount twice in that time.....
---
same question I had
---
Damn, your graphics look so much better than mine.
---
Thanks man, I think I get it, so:
---
If an item gives 10 spell damage, then all my spells (arcane, fire, love etc) will get an additional 10 x (spell coefficient of the specific spell).
---
If an item gives 10 frost damage, then all my FROST spells will get 10 damage, regardless of the specific frost spell's coefficient?
---
For others, I found this reddit post about spell coefficients:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/95abc8/list_of_spellcoefficients_1121/
---
It does not need to be a raid.
---
Lol yeah boomkin does fine in dungeon fights like you mentioned but in MC/raids you're using innervate on yourself instead of a healer and chugging Mana  pots on top of that just to not go oom and TRY to stay competitive with mages/locks
---
For folks using luna unit frames, how do you get enemy buffs to show on the target frame? Friendly shows fine.
---
It has the same playstyle...but with worse numbers and less fun cooldowns to use. You can do whatever you want, hell I played hemo daggers back in vanilla pre normalization because I didn't know shit.
---
If i remember correctly hit cap is 9% however with 305 weapon skill you only need 6%.
---
I think.
---
Not that I disagree with your over all point but are there actually dead classic servers now? 
---
I don't think I've noticed any but now that I don't log to realm select I never look.
---
Don‚Äôt use global lfg if you can‚Äôt wait for travel time. Ez.
---
It would‚Äôve taken less time to google it
---
I don't think many people understand how threat works. I was healing and pulling threat off a dual wielding fury warrior who was trying to tank last night 10 seconds into pulls by casting abolish poison on somebody - as my first spell of the pull. If you don't apply any threat on a mob then you have zero threat on a mob, and if anybody interacts with you at all then they pull agro, lol.
---
I didn't complain, and we made the run work. But the guy was complaining that threat is broken until level 55 for some reason. I don't think he understood how threat worked at all. Seems like a lot of people could benefit from learning about that particular mechanic. The current mindset of a lot of people is 'threat is broken, this sucks, why is everybody pulling threat off me, I hate tanking' instead of 'how does threat work? what am I doing wrong?'
---
Yea... no
---
The real problem is people upvoting that shit. It's not the OPs fault their content sucks, but it's absolutely the community's fault that shit makes the front page
---
Yeah leave room for meme's, stupid ass pictures of people on their mounts, and someone getting gold in their mailbox that they probably staged with their alt just to get karma...because fuck actual gameplay related discussion...right?
---
Prot warrior.
---
Spend the 10g I made running dungeons on repairs from said dungeon.
---
Nurture my hatred of everyone else because the dps started pulling and got angry when they died.
---
Thirsty players sliding into my dms all day, for dungeons I dont need, but say in LookingForGroup where the tanks at tho when I decline.
---
Get murdered by opposite factions mages when going to dungeons.
---
Cry that for some reason the warlocks wont stop their dots for onyxia for phase 3 thus wiping us multiple times because I cant out threat them and ony is taunt immune.
---
Crying that my helmet prebis looks like an old bucket with holes crudely cut out with a screwdriver.
---
Get my loot practically uncontested and guildies crying on discord that they havnt had raid loot in 3 weeks (feelsgoodman).
---
Tanking is just a constant swing between the emotions of feeling like the king, and also hating everyone, everything, and yourself.
---
That's how I meant it but I realize the phrasing was off. Sjould have said "dps scoring lower on meters than the tank?"
---
I just needed a title for the shitty meme I made while waiting far a devilsaur to spawn
---
He's an actual janitor and gets paid for it. He's one of the good guys. Rat duty isn't fun

Then change the fucking minimum...
---
Krol blade/mirah's is slightly better than thrash/mirah, and double dalrends is better than either of those combos.
---
Nothing like dots fears and chasing!
---
Yes that is what happens.  but your comment made it click for me.
---
I just changed the order of the equips so the shield is done first and it works :)
---
I dunno. Tony didn't trust that cookie shit.
---
So why even go the other specs? Seems like shadow priest until raids and Respec at that point is the way to go
---
Kromcrush all day, switched from Herod on launch day and it‚Äôs been completely worth it definitely seems 50/50
---
I don't think you know what lying is. I thought the combat log api in the game was unfiltered if you checked the boxes, being wrong=/=lying.
---
So I guess we're 1-1. I didn't know that thing, you didn't know what lying meant. Now we both taught each other something :)
---
I think the lvl 30s just think the lvl 60s are huge fucking no-lifer nerds.
---
As a priest I log on, check the AH. Look whats up in the chat and if I am in the mood to run a dungeon without my mates, I do so. Otherwise I change my gear, head to dm East and try to farm those little camps there, die&gt;reset do it again until I have enough and maybe log out or get a dungeon group.
---
Kinda a small sample size, but I always enjoyed these posts on the OSRS sub. Thanks!
---
I'd like to imagine they are a bunch of asmongoloids, but i feel your pain both this sub and the r/wow sub have some serious gatekeeper neckbeards as mods.
---
I do this too but because of DKP system you are kinda shoehorned into hoarding everything until mageblade/necklace/trinket drops.
---
"Classic won't have the toxic communities that BFA has!"
---
30 DPS doing more DPS is yet only 10% total more DPS.   It's debatable if it's significant.  
---
My point was in priorities.  Players often prioritize gear over knowing mechanics and I'm saying it's typically foolish.
---
Obviously having both is ideal but in the real world you have to prioritize which attributes you want, especially from PUGS, as you never get both across all recruits.
---
Yo what unit frame addon is that??
---
nobody has given an answer because it's not a fucking problem that happens to default chat. He's using an addon that shows the realm names, we don't know which one so how are we supposed to tell him how to hide something that he has done to the chat himself. 
---
That's why google doesn't have an answer, because he's asking the wrong question. he needs to google how to remove it on whatever addon he's using to add it in the first place lol
---
You want an add-on the plays the game for you?
---
None of my friends are playing BFA odd.
---
I play on Sulfuras too. Lotta guilds clearing MC and Ony. Horde heavily outnumbers alliance.
---
When I'm on my pally I can't help listen to some Holy Diver!
---
There are like 2 dedicated tank slots in a raid.
---
Many warriors won't tank because they know they'll just dps in the end.
---
&gt; I wish there was a better way to level mining/herbing together and automatically cycle through the tracking for each.
---
Boy have I got [an addon for you](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/classic-tracking-cycler).

Disclaimer: Haven't used this one in Classic yet - sounds like setup might be a little tricky.

This can also Proc hand of justice, and that can re-proc the others.

I play on Golemagg and Ashbringer and for some reason Ashbringer feels like 10x bigger server.
---
Should I switch from Whitemane as Alliance?
---
As some one who is new to healing, how am I supposed to use this and what am I supposed to take away from this? I've just read and been told as general rule of thumb to use 4,7 and 10 HT. 
---
Altho with +491 healing even r3 HT feels quite strong.

Always those damn women.

When you're out of quests, start farming gear on dungeons that way you're killing two birds with one stone rather than pointlessly grinding mobs which can be a slog

That's where the frustration came from! If you just clicked the links I gave you hours ago you would've known what the API is from the get go. Instead you doubled down. That's why I kept commenting. That's why that other dude kept laughing when you ghosted comment chains. If you act like this, posting something with 'proof' but being unwilling to entertain any other possibility or even looking at their links and while so matter-of-factly telling others they're wrong, you're gonna frustrate people.
---
I do apologize for calling you names though. One time before I ever learned to code or anything I had an image saved on my computer and gave my friend, across the internet, the local path to the file: c:/users/dot/images/something.jpg thinking he could access it since I saw that path in the browser's url bar. Everyone has different levels of knowledge about different things.
---
Then you‚Äôre playing with pretty bad mages tbh. The best logged balance Druids would be considered mediocre to plain bad if they were mages with the same dps. You do bring the aura and brez which is something worth noting though.
---
Honestly, I‚Äôd say spell crit -&gt; +heals -&gt; int -&gt; mp5.  Not an expert.

20 minutes maybe. It‚Äôs quick if you know what you‚Äôre doing.

I say that when selling devilsaur pieces, but people expect me to sell for charity prices. The legs alone cost ~140g to make and sell for 160 on ah. People hit me up wanting to but for 100g then get angry when I try to sell for 5g less than ah.

Which factions do you have on both servers?

The newer servers they launched are completely dead because most people have already found homes and don't want to reroll on to newer servers, they're even offering free transfers to the realms that badly need population increase

So why try and say it was like this in classic?

I think i'll level an alt w/ mining before switching to eng. i know i could do so now but i'd rather be self-sufficient than rely on AH
---
Villains who twirl their mustaches are easy to spot.  Those who clothe themselves in good deeds are well camouflaged.

---
Not to mention OP doesn't even realize the realms don't show by default, and it's an addon he's using that has created this problem in the first place. He needs to sort out his addon use if they're doing things to the UI and he doesn't even realize it's an addon doing it
---
So to answer your question OP. Disable all your addons. Boom, fixed your problem
---
Yes. You can tank up until raids without a single point in prot
---
Does that look like spit to you?
---
Fuck it!
---
But herbalism levelling goes much quicker than mining. You only loot the node once and you loot everything. 
---
Also, herbs are found all over the place rather than just in the hilly/mountain regions

As suspected OP is playing this on a potato.

This sub is basically facebook at this point, full of shitty fucking memes getting spammed and upvoted every day. The worst part is i knew it was coming as soon as the game released. Or some fucking mount post hurrs i got 40 and a mount, some fucking sob story to make the title massive and get people spamming that fucking upvote button because they need validation. 
---
At least let us filter out the memes and stuff, that would fix it completely.

Deadmines will always be VC

I'm trying to get BoE rare/epics in every slot with maximum spirit possible. I'm pretty sure I'm the only person in the game that's doing that. But just because I'm the only person on the server who is desperately trying to buy the item doesn't mean I'm going to pay the price that they're asking for it. FYI, I finally found it listed on the AH for 5g and snatched it immediately. Thanks, Mr. Reasonable.

---
Not really though. On this specific sub yea you're probably right, but on all the frequently used subs there are power moderators that mods all those subs. Usually the top 20 mods of each sub also mod 500 other subs. Honestly I wouldn't be surprised if this sub even has a few power mods because these mods try to mod any sub they can get their slimy hands on
---
It's one of the biggest reasons reddit has gone downhill. it only takes a couple bad power mods to over moderate subs and ruin the content of them
---
The worst part is when it's a warrior saying this.
---
Quite frankly, everything except Warrior can be easily replaced if you view it that way.
---
Luckily, the game isn't hard enough for it to matter. Resto druids get into raids and groups ez.

Auctioneer has an option to post stack size and amount of stacks.

You do NOT need FR for vael as dps. Healers are unable to go oom they can do a fuck ton of hps, help them with a fire pot and you are good to go. Firemaw should be a joke from what we know pservers.
---
I get trades as a mage and get insulted when I throw up a ? Not knowing that they want instantly without even a whisper. Like are you paying me for water, for a port, for being pretty?

it always was. But devilsaurs weren't really this contested or valuable so you didn't really have this kind of shit happen.

As a hunter on westfall. 
---
It's pretty fucking awful, for whatever reason this server is oddly elitist. I've been denied groups for 5 mans because "Hunter isn't a meta dps"
---
Raiding is also pretty much impossible due to said reason as well.
---
So most of my day is spent leveling my warrior so I can actually play the fucking game and not just be an AFK in IF and be denied bot.

Skinning. Vendor all leather now, to build gold towards 40, or continue doing what I'm doing and crafting leatherworking gear, while selling mats no longer worthwhile to me? Currently 240-ish skinning and 150-ish leatherworking. Something like heavy quivers sell pretty decently on the ah, allowing more profit than the mats themselves.

Pretty sure shadow priest is one of the hardest matchups for mage

This will look and act like your regular rend ability. Except it forces your auto attack to start, which the regular ability doesn't do. (hashtag) means use the hashtag symbol, I would put the symbol here, but reddit auto formats it to be bold and I don't know how to correct that.

I hit Shimmering Flats at 30, and that got me through a couple of levels, which made STV a more realistic option.  Then I bounced between STV, Arathi, and Hillsbrad.  [Here's a map](https://i.redd.it/pkpbvgez5jp31.png) I found helpful.
---
Hillsbrad starts in the low 20s, but tops out in the high 30s.
---
Some of us don't really have a choice. I got unlucky and picked a seemingly elitist server and made the even bigger mistake of playing hunter on it.
---
At 60 all hunters can do on Westfall is beg to be taken to shit only be to denied because "hunters arent meta dps"

Yeah but it's better than going to the bank constantly. It's to reduce downtime, worth the cost.

Alliance gets a good amount of quests out of Rebel Camp in the very northern edge of the zone, right next to the bridge to Duskwood.

It definitely requires a lot more running than on the Horde side.

*fades to black*
---
If you are only 53, and the highest in your guild. You are not in a raiding guild, jump ship and find a guild that aligns with your interest. At this point its no real loss, you haven't forged friendships, they haven't funneled any time/gear into you. It should be a clean break, no sense in wasting your time.
---
just to quickly add to this, if you do roll a tank I would suggest rolling a druid, that way if your friends bail and don't keep playing you can solo level really easily!
---
Be good.
---
Yes people use the proc in pvp and pve with a rank one dot in case there  running away or something and trying to escape. A few points thrown in there is great but maxing it isn‚Äôt recommend unless you pvp.

yea unless you need the cloth i'd say just questing is the better route, because you're also killing stuff while you're doing quests

Ok, we got the "coke in a wow quest" screenshot quota met for this week.

At least he would be wanted as a mage. No one wants hunters for literally any content because of things like warcraft-logs or icy-veins

Lets him be. Atleast somewhere he can pretend to be important.

Ha Ha wow is that a drugs joke in World of Warcraft I see? :-)

Idk, I like the challenge (if you can call it that) of parsing sarcasm in text. It‚Äôs not as hard as people make it out to be, though I acknowledge it would be much much much harder if English was not your first language. I personally think /s, ‚Äúthank you kind stranger for the ____‚Äù, etc to be incredibly annoying. Just say what you‚Äôre saying and stop worrying about downvote insulation or award humblebrags or whatever.
---
thank you for the explanation, ill keep that in mind for the next video.
---
no because you'r not using your affli spells at all in raids
---
it's still pretty early, on my server there are only a handful of guilds that are regularly raiding as most of the population are still levelling - I'd keep trying different guilds until you find the sweet spot - your main concern (at least in what you've said above) is a lack of a playing group or guild, you need to find one, not re-roll
---
Shazzrah?
---
? Rag's been down for weeks dude. Scarab's just another guild to do it.
---
Honestly, Skullsplitter Crossbow is just as good (arguably better in some situations because it's slower) and costs like 15g instead of 250...
---
That's kind of nice...
---
Which side do you have on ZT? I'm on Alliance there and sure Ironforge has a decent amount of people but compared to 3 weeks ago there's much less people now. Stormwind and Darnassus almost feel like ghost towns unless there's a guild event going on.

I'm afraid to turn on WeakAuras for two reasons:

Ahh my bad, I didn't notice it was just Affliction spells.

I've never got to the end game, and always played on private servers as warrior or hunter.
---
In classic, I started a warrior (lvl 15 now) and i'm not really convinced about the mechanics of it (never played vainilla, always wotlk and further).
---
I want to roll a hunter or a rogue.
---
Any recs? Stay with my orc warrior 'til I learn the game content? Maybe Hunter bc the easy lvling?
---
Ty guys! Pardon my english, im from Argentina!

Wow that sucks I find groups in minutes just ask in /g and bam

I'm sorry, can you show me where? If you could give me some sort of explanation I'd be much more understanding, I'm not really seeing the comment you're referring to.
---
Honestly, all of that is besides the point that I think it's really sad that you get your panties twisted up over the quality of pictures on a public forum. Don't you have more important shit going on in your life?

I just started doing this recently - and it does work!

Frost damage gear still goes through spell coefficients. It‚Äôs strictly worse to have 30 frost damage, compared to 30 spl dmg/ spl power.
---
Its not a screenshot of winterspring.
---
To my knowledge dwarf holy priests are the best possible healer class. Best numbers, as well as the fear ward which is extremely helpful in certain raids. But Paladins are pretty awesome too and have a ton of utility

I remember before classic, some friends and I got bored and played a pserver to try the older stuff again. One of my friends decided to invite this other guy so we could get a full 5 man going to do dungeons without randos, and trade profession items like bags and pots. Went on about how he's a pretty good raider, and how he probably knows the game better than us. He shows up, and we get him levelled to about 15 on his paladin, and the first time he goes off on his own, he pulls like 4 or 5 mobs and gets torn to shreds before complaining about how bullshit that is and going back to WoD, leaving us having wasted our time to get him up to speed, along a bunch of bags and gear. Didn't even get back on to give the BoE stuff he was too low to equip back, not that we really needed it. This wasn't even a vanilla server either, it was WotLK. He got his ass handed to him by the Tomber Supply ghouls in WotLK. After he left, I started laughing my ass off at how bad at the game he was, both gameplay wise, and on a social level.
---
I would recommend making LW gear and sending it to an alt with enchanting, disenchant the gear and sell the enchanting mats on the AH - I did this for my main but with tailoring and I made a bunch of gold
---
Just install Adibags.

9% hit is needed to reach the hit cap, so 9% combined with your natural hit from weapon skill and the like is needed to be able to always hit raid level bosses

Then worked on them to get what I wanted with photoshop and transformed the final image to .tga file.

Weak auras lets you upload those files to wow (guide on youtube) and I just worked arround with SUF and Weak Auras till I liked the result.

I also have a rage bar done with weak auras to fit the energy slot in the image and the levels also are positioned using text from weak auras.
---
I'm not sure if you have any experience codding but I found a lot of "how do I do that" googling the stuff I wanted to appear
---
Ranged have a chance to resist/miss and melee attacks have a chance to miss, parry, glance etc l. Hit percentage lowers the occurrence of these kinds of dps reducing effects. Hit cap refers to the point at which getting more hit % begins to give less benefit per point or you can no longer be resisted

darn, beat me to it

Bro do it up. Warriors rogues and mages are the top DPS. You may have to wear leather but you will own
---
You're best off just doing whatever it is you have been doing. A lot of people don't even get their mounts right at level 40 unless they get really lucky with a world drop, so you are a bit ahead of the curve tbh. I didn't grab my mount until 46, lol. Keep up the good work!
---
For sure, but the statement that 'most servers are pretty dead' is entirely untrue.

I'm fine with arms prot, something like 31/5/15, I guess 31/4/15 till I ding 60

You're an idiot sir. Thanks
---
I mean bottom left is outland
---
Edit: its not I get it
---
This is probably going to come out as a rant, but so be it.
---
I agree that people's fundamental understanding of threat is wrong in the community, which is really strange if you ask me. 
---
I remember when I was raiding in TBC, my guild would literally wait until bosses had 95-98% HP from just the tank's damage and no dps. Why tf did we do this? To let the fucking noob warrior gain aggro/threat. I really still do this in any boss encounter. I let tank build aggro before I even think about casting a spell/Frostbolt.
---
It certain things that I really can't wrap my head around, like:
---
1) Not letting tanks build aggro. 
---
2) If you see your healer has even 1 fucking mob on them, you either have to pull aggro off them, CC the mob or worst case scenario kill the mob because aggro won't pull off. 
---
3) Doing AoE on a single target (Yes, I'm talking to my fellow Mages, you are making us look bad, REALLY BAD)
---
4) Doing AoE abilities like cleave and blizzard on CC'd targets, be it polymorph, hibernate, sap, ect. 
---
I've been in tons of groups that the DPS is in perfect sight of the healer getting wailed on by a mob, and they just keep attacking either the boss or whatever. Then the healer has to decide who is more important to heal, himself or the tank, and can easily cause a wipe. 
---
It puzzles me how some of these small things are just completely forgotten from the game. I also have a six sense of when I'm getting close to pulling aggro, and will only pull aggro/threat knowingly, so I will tell tank something along the lines of "I'm going hard this encounter and will pull aggro, on X boss, or on certain big pulls, just to burn it down as fast as humanly possible. There are times, I tell the group, dont worry about said adds when they spawn. I will take care of them, and I do that to make my healer and tank lives easier. 
---
In many situations, I see our tank go in, our heal put on a HoT or just a rank 1 heal, pulls half of the trash mobs, and I just Cone of Cold pull aggro, and run them back to tank, and once they are almost on top of tank, Frost Nova. 
---
I feel like it is common sense, but I understand the argument that common sense isn't common anymore.
---
Oh, that's literally me.
---
Got a question for my fellow fury warriors out there. Got really lucky and got Ironfoe + Hand of Justice, when do you think Ironfoe is actually replaceable as a main hand? Tried to look it up on the web but can't really find the actual potential DPS anywhere and now am struggling to decide if any of the main hands from this phase are actually worth it . . (from Ony/MC). Thanks for the feedback!

I‚Äôve been leveling Holy since SM, and it‚Äôs fine. I managed to get almost all of the scarlet set and the 2H axe running SM over and over - even as the healer. You‚Äôll have your holy gear for dungeons and +str etc for solo. Stick to green mobs/ quests if solo and keep doing dungeons and grouping up whenever possible and you‚Äôll be good.
---
That looks like blasted lands not outland.
---
One server i play on i have to leave the lfg channel because it's just endless groups endless raid pugs endless everything, the other server has barely anything happening.
---
Ah nethergarde keep , my bad

that's Blasted Lands
---
Awww I was so hyped for HH q.q well perhaps they'll add him throughout the years :D
---
Are you wanting the flying mount?
---
Healer here, outside of guild finding consistent groups in /lookingforgroup takes longer than running the actual dungeon.
---
Yeah, had the same issue. For some reason, there is a weird default option to only show your group in a raid. I think it was Layouts =&gt; Editor =&gt; Display all Groups that I needed to set for it to work properly.
---
Generally it‚Äôs too late for a rare recipe enchant to be worth the cost considering many will have it or have connections with a guild enchanter. You would have to do a significant amount of trade chat spamming to pay off those expensive enchant recipes if you do manage to do it
---
No shit.. I've been playing since og vanilla.. and the other night I walked into brill and saw almost 50 people running around.. I've never seen brill soo packed before! Blows my mind how busy classic is

Yeah, BC added some cool stuff.

How did you get the brawler's harness, isn't it horde only item?

Haha, those eyes... looks like an unhinged maniac, he‚Äôll run off with all your riches ;)

Care? No. Get this salty about it? Yes.

---
Which I think is fine, because I, like most people, don't get paid to post things on Reddit, and I, like most people, don't think my time is inherently more important than other people's, so they should take extra time to post things so I don't have to spend any extra time digesting it.

---
Seconding Adibags
---
absolutely insane moneymaking method
---
Well at least Classic **has** Communities, so there's that...
---
It is in the screenshot, it‚Äôs the third line under the item link.
---
I think you‚Äôre misunderstanding the post.  Sock said WTB in chat (my assumption) and the OP is trying to ask what he‚Äôll pay for one.
---
One potential money maker people forget about with enchanting is farming small radiant shards from lower level dungeons. Doesn‚Äôt require buying an expensive pattern and trade chat spamming  and gives a nice chunk of gold per hour. Also you can consider if you are going to run a lot of late game dungeons that DEing drops will typically give greater income than censoring.
---
Deviant Delight!
---
It took me a couple days to get used to AdiBags, coming from always using a single bag addon like Bagnon, but since using it, I love it so much more and can‚Äôt switch back.
---
Done it , also did DM N
---
I really thought this was going a direction, and im glad it didnt go that way. This was solid.
---
 Ahk I understand, thanks.
---
It is because all the other healer trinkets are like not existent. Though now with DM there are other healer trinkets we need. Namely, Mindtap talisman.
---
I always read fury as furry. Furry warriors would be the best. But I suppose those are druids. Anyways, back to your wow.
---
Edgemasters are mail
---
The vast majority of what is seen in the screenshot is in the zone Hyjal. The screenshot might have been taken on the very edge of Winterspring but the entire point is that it's a cata zone and cata assets. That is literally the joke.
---
Ah yes, let‚Äôs remove the only post about the actual game to make room for more shitty memes and people getting their basic mount.

Does feign death reset your threat?
