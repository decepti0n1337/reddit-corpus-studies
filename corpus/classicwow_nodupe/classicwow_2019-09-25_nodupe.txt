Ok, ok, granted, but still gotta make the macro... 
---

---
Click new, type in a name, pick an icon, type the macro, put it on your bar, potentially bind a new key. With clique, you can have something functionally identical in like 4 button presses. We will assume it's a simple macro and you know the command(s) you need off the top of your head and don't have to google it.

Within a few minutes of hitting 60 I was asked for money.
---
Itd be cool if at like level 55 theres a quest to res her and reunite mankirk with his wife.
---
I hate to break it to you but you have to make a new main
---
I’m the one in the video not the guy you are replying to
---
I think you'd like it. It's a pretty great game for someone with fresh eyes and has shit-tons of content to offer. 
---
But anything not Classic is just a distraction from Classic. Instead come be my friend on Sulfuras, Horde.
---
Should I just avoid Desolace? I went there yesterday at level 33 and it feels like I got about 4 quests done in 4 hours with all the running over distances. It's doing my head in. 
---
I've been told that at 33 I could go to Arathi and then STV for a better/quicker leveling experience? I haven't been to either yet. I am a rogue with great gear for my level, but still don't mind if I'm killing stuff a couple levels below (faster for solo rogues).
---
works, but doesnt show my health and info :(
---
Weird.  For me forsaken will nearly always attempt a gank (&gt;75% of the time), orcs are a coin flip, trolls and tauren probably less than 25% of the time. This has held consistent from pretty much vanilla launch.
---
I'd always use "banco" and "punkte" to be cool.
---
Another commenter elaborated on your general rule of thumb regarding suffixes and it is very helpful. Thank you! Also is enchanting alt even worth it for making money or meh?
---
Reread my original post. Where is there entitlement.
---
Again, irony. The very first person to respond to you inferred you would fall into the category or "shut up" i.e you wouldn't be one of the people flaming people for asking help therefore this doesn't apply to you. 
---
You've been so contrary throughout that you've now tried to find a leg to stand on by trying to make this about you and people "demanding" your help. 
---
Let me simplify because you obviously battle:
---
If you carry on with your life and don't abuse anyone. This doesn't apply to you.
---
If you are vocal in chat with whingers but aid when people ask for help in a genuine situation as listed above. This doesn't apply to you.
---
If you flame people at every point even when they need help and then proceed to sit on your high horse and do absolutely fuck all. THIS APPLIES TO YOU.
---
I'm not entirely sure how you started by flat out stating this was fictitious and didn't exist to then implying my own post is about expectations... But we're definitely done here.
---
Died at the end of the fight due to pour positionning where I got melee bumped into an Hammer Bump and died way up in the sky. Stayed like that for the end of raid screenshot. Proud of us as a full PUG :D
---
Igan's mother thinks he's extraordinary
---
He is looking for more, so he has a group just missing a tank from what I see.  Are you a tank?  If so, are you a lower level tank for zf?  Asking him to make a group when he is looking for 1 more is kind of weird.  You want him to drop the other 3 and start a group with you?  I don't get it.
---
Is it a strict upgrade for your current role? Need.
---
Is it a strict upgrade for a role you are not currently filling, and not an upgrade for anybody else in any way? Need.
---
Is it a strict upgrade for a role you are not currently filling, and it is an upgrade for another party member in a role they are not currently filling? Need.
---
All other scenarios: greed.
---
Not possible for an addon since choosing spells is protected.
---
And then you dive deep into the abyss that is the interracial, interfaction romance novels.
---
I have to agree. I actually had the most fun in BC, because the specs were just good enough to all be roughly competitive, while the game was just unpolished enough to retain most of the PUG mechanisms that made vanilla highly social. Plus Karazhan was an amazing entry level raid. (I enjoyed it far more than the 10/25 mechanic introduced in WotLK).
---
+1 for threat plates. Makes tanking just a little bit easier. Particularly to know what is/what isn’t hitting you!
---
A mistake
---
I stuck with enhancement and found the sustain much better.  The trick was actually not using stormstrike unless I REALLY needed the extra burst.    
---
My rotation is pull with lightning bolt, flame shock, auto attack, refresh flame shock when it goes down, use earth shock when needed on a caster.    
---
I usually place str and mana stream totems, and try to pull to them so I don't have to place them again.  This way I only drink after maybe 5-6 mobs.
---
I suggest running away from home
---
Watching the orc with the music from techno viking in the background is amazing
---
Yeah! Mash it on the Hemorrhage key instead. That way you can mash more often.
---
Just don't use a macro, the regular spell casts the highest rank possible and using a macro breaks this.
---
i am DEFINITELY ganked more on my gnome than my human but i thought it had more to do with the fact that people were more willing to gank a warrior than a paladin.
---
Fallen Hero of the Horde questline. Deapite the name it's available to both factions. Start from the titular ghost orc on the border of Swamp of Sorrows and Blasted Lands. You won't see an exclamation point above his head if you start at 60 but it's a long chain that quickly ramps up to mid 50s and above. At the end you get some okay resistance gear and a 16 slot bag and tons of gold from experience conversion. If you manage to do it pre-60 the chain is worth a good 100k xp too.
---
its called Shadowed unit frames
---
I wasn’t corpse camped once later on I tried to 1v1 you but then a 59 horde Mage appeared from nowhere per usual :/
---
The guy you are replying to isn’t me man and I have no hard feelings about it lol
---
I did the same thing with my names. They are all the same except I rotate a and e, and r,n,m. So at a glance, you don't even tell a difference.
---
Not only that but the sign post is off center from the tiles too
---
Tell them “what-evahhh!!! I do what I wannt” in Cartmans voice
---
They won’t... 
---
They’ll be processing the fact you’re playing a female toon
---
Yes
---
What did you do? Used the raid frames settings?
---
Health and mana on your portrait is enabled and configured via `Interface - Display - Status Text`
---
If the healer is asked to heal despite being feral, he shouldn't be giving up claims to the loot he wants.
---
If there's an issue, group needs to find a healer that is perma spec'd resto.(gl with that, priests will generally be rolling on lock/mage stuff, shammies/druids on mage/priest/rogue stuff, pallies on warrior/priest stuff, etc).
---
There are several key indicators guides, give one a quick 5-10 minute perusal and it will drastically improve your efficiency.
---
It's easier to just adjust I find. It's much easier for me as a DPS to simply press fewer buttons than expect the tank to magically gain Method level abilities simply because I asked. I always laugh at the rationale behind those random players who just demand you play better. It's like fuck, might as well ask me to do a backflip while you're at it since apparently the only limiting factor to my abilities is simply due to nobody ever requesting me to do it.
---
20 to 30 I was pretty much in two zones the entire time Wetlands and Duskwood and there are two dungeons Stockades and gnomerion.
---
30 to 40 has been a struggle for me.
---
I spent way to long trying to do quests in hillsbrad and Stranglethorn and just got ganked repeatedly I wasted so much time in those zones
---
Need if need. Any other reasoning is bullshit, as is getting mad about it
---
Collusion, people screwing other people over, people passing big upgrades to hoard DKP, to name a few. It's a bad and dated system, especially for a game whose BiS and loot priority lists have been figured out for over a decade.
---
My thought on this problem would be to have some other character functionality reward. Or just flat out gold reward. Add this reward to all 40 man raid bosses so folks will still go run MC, BWL, AQ40 and Naxx. They could give more buff rewards like ony head that make other raids easier. Basically the idea is increasing the content and the level slowly, without making the old stuff obsolete. TBC expansion was the worst because everything you worked so hard for become utterly worthless instantly. Then they forced you to break up with your friends with smaller raids, and the grind that would seperate no life's from employed people. Also cross server transfers. 
---
Another thought would be have +1 lvl increasing with each new 40 man raid that comes out. After Naxx.. same talent tree, instead of a normal talent point maybe you get like a little bonus to an existing talent. But most importantly, you only get EXP from killing raid bosses. No open world grind.
---
A normal lvl 60 player would still be able to win in a fight but just a little advantage, just to keep things moving upward.
---
When you're scraping up as much gold as you can to get a mount, a few 50s-1g DE mats or vendor prices add up.
---
&gt; I don't understand why you compare something that is possible to recreate
---
I mean, the whole thread is about how spell-batching isn't working correctly.  =o
---
43-48 is lightning fast with ZF graveyard runs. 
---
Of course this subreddit absolutely despises people leveling through dungeons (because you have to play the game the way they want you to), but yeah. If you hate those levels that much I recommend you just blast through them.
---
I switched to SM/Ruin at 60 and I actually really miss dark pact in dungeons. Honestly more useful than Ruin in 5man content. 
---
The noise though...god the noise.
---
-Being a water vending machine in raids, having to sit there and make 20+ stacks of water and spend 5 minutes handing them out to every caster
---
-Tons of other mages, so tons of competition for gear, especially tier sets
---
that's about it
---
and  yes i alt tab while spamming frostbolts and drinking to watch youtube lmao
---
What i'm saying is if your taking anything and using gold as a justification why not roll on the gear aswell?
---
So what's the purpose of him being in the raid?
---
So is it impossible to transfer items from Horde/Alliance on pve servers using the neutral AH now? I remember that being a thing the one time I played on a pve server.
---
I started a rogue, got to level 22 and decided I should make a tank because the world needs tanks.  Got to level 34 on my tank before I burned out on warrior leveling.  So I bought 4 rune cloth bags, and sent them and 21g to my rogue.  Now my rogue is sitting pretty with big ol' bags and a fat stack of gold for a level 22.  And now that I know the dark side of leveling (warrior) I can breeze through the game knowing how good I have it as a rogue.
---
My warlock buddy from the before time offered that his trick was to try and keep his hp/mana equalized ( as far as efficient group progression through dungeons )  
---
Much better than tapping yourself dead after a big pull and looking to the drinking healer for assistance.
---
That's what she said.
---
I'd say wetlands and duskwood but horde didn't really have those options :O. Hillsbrad and STV are super hit or miss depending on the server hours and how many people want to fuck around and gank you. Desolace became my place of choice for a lot of level grinding in 30-40 as well as central STV away from nessingway camp
---
ask a tailor to make you a robe.  sont matter as much until you hit 60.  what server you on?
---
That's true. Point stands though.

"we believe the nature of ClassicLFG is incompatible with our social design for Classic. Thus, in an upcoming patch (in the weeks following launch), we will be adding restrictions to the Classic add-on API that will significantly limit this add-on and others like it."
---
" if a streamlined group-finding system was something we considered compatible with Classic, we would have kept the modern Premade Group Finder tool rather than choosing to remove it from the Classic client." 
---
yes, not banned.. But they are pretty active at not having a LFG/dungeon finder addon be avaliable for classic.
---
Why does not being level 60 mean you're not committed? Classic is an RPG, not a theme park like retail, right? Being level 60 isn't all there is to the game.
---
I’d highly recommend a Corsair Scimitar. Best mouse I’ve ever bought.

Yeah, tried all that.

&gt; If you flame people at every point even when they need help and then proceed to sit on your high horse and do absolutely fuck all. THIS APPLIES TO YOU.
---
No it doesn't, lol. I'm in the "vocal in chat with whingers but still don't give a fuck about you because it's not my job to help whingers."
---
This is my point. You seem to not understand there's a camp of people that is annoyed when people complain about PvP happening on a PvP server, but also don't care to help out some rando complainer.
---
THIS CAMP IS THE MOST POPULAR CAMP. There's nothing objectively wrong with this camp. 
---
No one should have their head bitten off when asking for help. 
---
People should be reminded that they voluntarily chose a PvP server. 
---
People should realize they aren't entitled to my help.
---
The **VAST MAJORITY** of people responding in the fashion you outlined in your post are people that are doing so in response to complainers. I mean, you may have experienced one or two instances where people were told to stfu when they simply asked for help, but they are so few and far between that this thread does not need to exist.
---
How did you take such a high screen shot?
---
Those classes tend to not attack first. Its rogues who will gank most.
---
Stoneweaver Leggings from Uldaman

I still get people yelling at me to just "demo shout everything"...

Yep.  And he didnt like it at all

Thanks brother.

It worked but to go into no form.

I just redid the macro to change to actionbarform. Recasting shadowform just takes u in and out

Awesome progress. I'm juggling a handful, not near as elegant as this.

We don't know, and we don't know.

Based on wowwiki and wowhead it looks like he was added in MoP and not classic so I don't think there is any chance he will be in phase 2.
---
why do you have experience taping 9 inch dildos to things?
---
I don't even play a rogue and hate melee classes in general but I say it belongs to the guy who can actually open it.  If you want locked chests roll a rogue or get engineering so you can make seaforium charges.
---
Outfitter works though.
---
Sounds like the beginning of a joke
---
Atlas is what you're after
---
Nope
---
As a warrior who leveled up with a shaman and always tanked dungeons with a 2H, i had to spe def to tank MC.  
---
Let me say that the Defense specialisation is the worst fucking thing outside of raid, i feel useless in dungeon or  even UBRS, and i can't farm shit.
---
I've seen this comment before, but never if they had submitted a bug report for it.  You should consider doing that.
---
The login screen that you see for about 1 second? Since we use blizzard loader to login?
---
That's what the tank I play with is resorting to. I'm on a rogue and we have a feral druid as well, we're a bit ahead on levels compared to the rest of our group so we just insta kill the skull while he builds aggro on the rest.
---
Now you're protected against Brain Hacker's -25 int proc

I think he means having plainsrunning as a 3 second cast button, much like worgen have now.

I can express the amount of laughing on my end.

The login screen where you choose your server, and then choose your character on that server have the same music. And that's the one I'm talking about

If you dont want him to get upset about people telling him to shutup.

Ill side with the guy asking for  help in pvp in a pvp server before i side with a bitter cunt like you who just complains about people wanting help..

I can just picture him furiously typing his name on the race to reserve names. Only to come back launch day to "..."
---
1.2k
---
1258
---
You know those are the same length, right?
---
It's a bit more homogenous. Everyone has an interrupt, everyone has some form of sustain, which evens out the odds somewhat.
---
Counters are much harder in classic. The PvP trinket is much harder to come by, has a much longer CD and doesn't dispel all CC, only 3 types, different for each class. Paladin fighting a priest? Unless the RNG is on your side and you wreck the sucker in one stun, you'll just go OOM while the priest /rofls. Unless you're Holy and then the battle will last forever. Or until the priest remembers they have Mana Burn. Shamans on the other hand have a very short CD interrupt in ES. Druids don't have any. Unless they talent into Feral Charge, which means they have to run away from the target and shift into a bear to pull it off.
---
Lots of stuff like this. WoW has been following the "bring the player not the class" philosophy starting with TBC, so a lot of abilities got simplified and homogenized. Which at least somewhat evened out the odds between different classes in PvP. In Classic, if you meet your counter, you'll get countered and countered hard.
---
Did this get vandalized somehow? because I only see four recipes.
---
That's honestly why I'm starting to dislike both subreddits. You have r/wow which is Retail Good, Classic Sucks (although before classic release it was vice versa) and r/ClassicWoW which is Classic Good, Retail Sucks. I want a healthy middle for players like me who play both and enjoy both. I hate the sentiment of "one over the other" which I seem to see everywhere.
---
The only real pvp situation where an extra attack is superior is when you should be focusing the healer anyway.
---
Honestly, I encourage you to try macespec for a while - it makes PvP vs things like holy paladins or resto shamans far easier. I used swords and maces *a lot* back in the day (axes were the least used spec I ran) and though I always preferred the fun factor of sword procs, mace procs won a whole lot more fights.
---
    /castsequence reset=6 Chain Lightning, Lightning Bolt, Lightning Bolt, Lightning Bolt

This will cast chain lightning then lightning bolts and reset to chain lightning when its off cooldown.

I am a lvl 46 warlock. Where should I go quest? I've done hinterlands (except elite quests) and STV is just too packed to get anything done. I feel like I've run out of quests in Feralas/Dustwallow/etc.
---
great reply thanks
---
Yeah it's good up untill 60. DP won't scale with spellpower or shadow damage talents like lifetap does. So you'll have to do 4-5 DP casts instead of one lifetap.
---
Mankrik
---
oh this sounds really interesting I Will definitely be doing this, thank you :)
---
There's no such thing
---
You need the atlas addon.
---
Lol
---
1) You clearly edited your post because that's not what it said.
---
2) It's not a hard game.  Healing through Blood Fury is easy.  I did it all the time and never complained.
---
Since we're on the topic, I just want to say that the elite quests in Hinterlands were an absolute joy.
---
It took about three hours to complete because it was so busy but it remained steady all throughout. There were at least 5-6 groups of horde as well as another 5-6 groups of alliance in the area. It was absolute madness but I had so much fun just being there and running through that place like you would a dungeon along with the occasional PVP when everyone ran into each other.
---
Not to mention, the rewards in those quests are pretty great.
---
Best you can do is the add-on atlas
---
It's time for the people of the horde to take down Big Scarlet so that all may have access to the library in tirisfal glades
---
Van Cleef, boss of Deadmines. 
---
I played Horde in vanilla so all this stupidity around the abbrev. is baffling. You usually designate what wing of Diremaul you are running so it would be apparent which is being referenced. Worst case shift-click whoever is LFG and their lvl will tell you.
---
Level with green quests, fighting green mobs.  Instant poison I is pretty cheap.  The vials get expensive on the later stuff.  If you fight things that run away, really really consider using crippling poison.
---
His point is that twilight zone did it as well and is likely the most popular version of the story.
---
His subtle point is that you're an ass for starting your comment with "Nope!". That serves no purpose other than to put someone down.
---
I was doing about 90dps in brd arena at level 52 with zero points in cat talents(I was expecting to tank), using powershifting. if I'd had imp shred and blood frenzy, that probably would have gone up quite a bit.
---
not saying cat DPS is great, but you'd definitely pull decent dps an instance that's on or 1 to 2 levels above you

Only use instant poison and crippling. It’s helpful. I’m a 5p rogue. Used those poisons all the time since I could. Got a mount at 40 and have plenty of gold now. So you will be fine to use them a lot.

haha, vendor spec, you made my day

I just meant overall. Linen is about the same price across most servers so I figure it translates to most items.

Why are so many people on this subreddit such unrependent douchebags?

Correct. Now what were people buying it for generally?
---
Using 'pala' instead of pally or pal irritates me in ways I can't put into words.
---
Hey... I got that same breaking news message!
---
Don’t think it can be done without an addon.  Atlas is the standard and most used.  You’ll need the addon itself then the Classic map pack, 2 separate downloads.
---
Am I the only one who just whispered “lok’tar” and started dying of laughter
---
you sound like mad trash. like i said. i was 34. winning against a 38 shaman. then got gangraped by a 41 rogue. i mean... there are no 1v1s , im just getting gangbanged everytime. how the fck should i win the fight you dumbass?
---
How about the tiles literally warping in front of the AH?
---
Right but you could put a price to Shadowfang, Butcher, Argent Custodian, etc. I figured it would be the same here, where it had a general price it floated around in vanilla.
---
Just hit 50s wondering where to go and I think I'll do what you're doing!
---
gtfo.
---
I think they buy it for tanking, though I wouldn't cry if it dropped for my Shaman.
---
I'm 54 now. My last 3 levels my guide has gotten me to 50% and told me to farm furbolgs at the bottom of felwood. I'm losing my sanity
---
When I was leveling I’d go for higher levels for the lulz. I promise you, lulz were had. 
---
Also kill all warlocks and priests bc fuck em. Lol
---
You probably cannot get the weapons, but you can make up for that a bit with PvE drops. The armor is obtainable, but wont affect you very much.
---
The Average and Decently Strong
---
...
---
Normaligan the Unspectacular!!!
---
And before they get all the BiS shit that allows them to do that, they tank in prot to save their healer some sanity. Stop giving advice based on the top 1% of the community. You can tank as Arms while leveling, but you should swap to prot for endgame
---
I love you.
---
I'd like Proc tracker. Ironfoe, HoJ, sword spec. People say use scrolling combat text but it's not something I want. Can't even find a weak aura for it. Just something that gives a sweet indicator that it's proced would be amaze balls
---
Would also like to know.
---
It's where you make your lightsaber.
---
It's so insanely good
---
Blizzard does file checks which would likely replace any changes you make. I know changing a music file, if possible, is minor but I wouldn’t risk it myself. They don’t like that kinda stuff. Just click your realm faster I guess if it bothers you that much lol.
---
Personally, my 40s went by a lot faster than I expected.
---
This is interesting to me because 60% of my ganks have been from Druids. Followed by Paladins then priests.
---
Tauren Shaman on Kromkrush
---
Because I want to add it to my collection of known recipes. Adding a recipe that I find and win is more exciting than adding a recipe that I buy off the AH. (Also, adding a recipe I earn through reputation is more exciting than buying it off the AH, because even though I pay gold for it, I had to go through the steps of earning it).
---
Engineering is not that expensive. Level mining with it and you can drop mining later for something else. 
---
Engi is super fun and will boost your dps a lot also. 
---
Otherwise just do LW imo
---
The greed icon is literally a stack of gold
---
I know classic is knew for many many people but I also ran into this problem.  The group I joined had no idea there were multiple sections of SM.  It does seem kinda fun to get to experience the entire game again from a fresh perspective.

These videos are a tanks nightmare.

YouTube is a goldmine for Wow. That's where I go for any advice, which lately has been for warlock as well.

Are they alive (moving) or dead? Because I'm not sure which one would be creepier.

You could always pickup leatherworking, but you’d have to backtrack if you sold all your low level leather. You could keep the boes and go chanting on your rogue and save leather for an alt if you plan on making one that wears leather.

This is why all rogues are KoS. Nobody makes a rogue with good intentions on a pvp server.

I think you are doing something wrong or using a quest log addon that is doing something wrong.  Literally never happens.
---
You should go try. ;)
---
I got 25g for mine back in the day.
---
It was a let down because it was my first boe epic and I was hoping for a big payday.
---
Not in my case. I called out the racists with some really obscene language. Also just generally saying obscene stuff.
---
In SM you're better off tanking with a 2h. Especially in library. Mara is the first instance I expect my tanks to have a shield... Or a lot of fur.
---
&gt; racist shit
---
r/holup
---
I really don't understand why that system is in classic. Just put people on ignore and move on

Guess how many Druid tanks you see at 60? Right, the same amount of shaman tanks. Your point is null.
---
We are all Bluto.
---
It is known.
---
Confirmation bias. If anything you're factually incorrect seeing as horde outnumber alliance on nearly every pvp server by around 60% to 40%. Logic would tell us that it's likely the horde ganging up on the alliance more often simply because they have the numbers and those possible situations would happen more often for horde.
---
Feel free to fire back some incoherent message about how two alliance killed you 15 years ago and you still haven't moved on.
---
I always use poisons. Whenever I use them I try to use the charges before they run out or grind mobs until I get my money back at least
---
You'd be better off adding another sunder or hamstring to slow it down and save the taunt.
---
No, I was calling out other people in chat who were spamming racist shit. The red pills decided to report me for calling talking shit to them.
---
PEDANTIC REPLY*
---
If you can show a flaw in that logic you have a Nobel prize in Economics waiting for you.
---
The financial world we live in literally functions based on understanding of this simple concept alone
---
This is like if Tom Haverford from Parks and Rec were an Orc.
---
NO REPORT TO JAGAEX, GIB KARMA NAO
---
No love for hunters here?   We have literally ZERO downtime, can solo elites, get a companion to talk to ( yeah we talk to our pets ).
---
Oh yeah and don't forget.  We have less storage room and get to NEED everything in dungeons.
---
2h tanking while leveling is really the way to go though. Leveling warriors suffer hugely from a lack of rage.
---
2h allows better and more consistent rage generation, along with more damage. Which means less aggro pulled by dps, mobs die quicker, healer is healing the tank rather than the whole party due to less raggedy pulls, as well as helping dps down packs.
---
The decreased mitigation is not much of a downside when stacked up against these benefits.
---
Open the what?
---
And that chest would stay locked 100% if the rogue wasn't there.
---
click and keyboard turn or gtfo
---
You're right, I absolutely don't understand this.
---
Why does certain needless rules make it more exiting when others don't?
---
Yeah I don’t blame your brother either. You have to be close to borderline masochist to getting the owl early on as Horde. And it sucks to because you don’t see the owl come back until later on around level 50￼.
---
I know all that is from sm but what’s that hood?
---
Since no one else is gonna say it I’ll say it. Ding,
---
38 is a new rank in Drain Life. At 30 is when it outpaces most wands in damage, but at 38 is when Drain Life really presents itself as the superior option.
---
The biggest bamboozle was the leveling guides before launch telling you to level enchanting to LEVEL 70 to be able to greater magic wand for level 13. I am so glad I did not do that on my caster. By the time you can train enchanting you are level 10 then you are already past lesser magic wand if not close to it. Then there is no way you can level enchanting to 70 by level 13 in order to craft greater magic wand. You have to waste so many greens to do that, valuable vendor income wasted. Then all that is for naut when you run BFD and gravestone scepter doubles that wands dps seven levels later.
---
Or just dont have queue times
---
As someone who plays on a “dad server” (Deviate Delight) this is my new favorite phrase.
---
That's pretty accurate to how the game was so, at least it's authentic
---
Well good then.  That's not cool.  Back in the day, all I remember were Chuck Norris jokes and people just being annoying, but never racist shit.
---
I hate and love this.
---
Holy shit we found a live one boys.
---
Two words.  Scarlett Monastery
---
That's two strikes, but only if you prefer to do the deeps.
---
Yes I am, but PvP I can deal with; Hillsbrad was fun, even if it was a shitfight of alliance half the time.
---
That’s what happens when you jump off a boat. Their container gets changed.
---
Great advice except op is not tanking so pretty useless.
---
haha
---
Just do what I did and have a look around kijiji for a decent used PC or laptop. People treat them as disposable these days.
---
Oh man!! The only thing worse than 1 warlock is 2 warlocks!! Combine that with a tank that insists on using the SM 2h and whirlwind for days and all of a sudden you’re using 100 nectar in a single ZF run!
---
I don't see any reference to spell-batching. The existence of a queue for events doesn't imply that this situation is being handled in batches.
---
Wow we have extremely similar names.
---
can confirm.. so common for some reason.. oof..!
---
And why the fuck cant we get a special bag for rogue shits?  Fuck ass game.  Lol aMmO poUCHeS
---
Yeah 2 hours is quite fast, and you'd need to play very efficiently. It's been taking me about 3-5 hours.
---
Except ranged dps is better then all meele Simone’s butt hurt about 3 mage groups.
---
"typical alliance though" lmao.
---
I'm sorry, did all of the Fortnite players come over to horde??
---
Green skin girls mang, it's why I started horde.
---
The economy community does this too, undercut by more than 1 copper and just let the rage pour in.
---
Because this entire subreddit is filled with people who blame everyone but themselves for their inability to get groups for shit, so they see the tiniest thing that might prevent them from getting access to 1 group in particular and they think that's the sole reason they can't get in to groups.
---
It happened with gear score, it happened with ilvl, it happened with r.oi and the new trend is blaming comps.
---
43 min if you want a full clear. Less if you're a healer. Pref more if you're a tank. I healed a 41 up until the last boss, who is 47.
---
Aoe groups don't run a tank. I love how these "aoe groups" just think they can run into a five man with no plan, no voice coms, and no coordination and come out with a win. These poor mages are gonna have a bad time.
---
I plan to go SM+Ruin and never respecc because it's a good allrounder. I mean you can drain tank with that specc aswell. It's mainly just dark pact missing. Think I'll manage fine.
---
Two different add ons
---
Because the pvp playstyle is more about control than pure damage and most people think it's going to be all vurtne clips forget to play proper shepherd simulator and get crit like the soft ass dress wearing faiiry they are. This goes double if you roll an alliance mage, congratulations you played yourself prepare for life as shaman's doormat.
---
Ironforge is already in the ground tho.
---
I'm not arguing with you about which is the source. However, you can absolutely make something as a call back to a remake or reimagining of a source and not to the actual source. For instance, if you particularly like Heath's joker, you can make direct references to that rather than the original character. I do agree that if it's ambiguous, like with OP, you should credit the true source.
---
Your comment was abrasive, which I assume is why the other guy made the comment he did. It makes you come across as if you think you are better than others. Judging by your other comment in this thread, it seems like he was right.
---
I'm glad you brought up the source; it's nice to see the old sci fi getting more light.
---
How about this: I spend my $15 a month to play the game how I want, and you spend your $15 a month to play the game how you want.
---
Telling me that I have to play the game your way because you think mine is "annoying" isn't the most convincing argument.
---
OP is not tanking, he's dps arms is his question.  After the tank pulls he should charge and blood rage.  Don't do heroics as they take away rage generation while also costing rage.  Have tactical mastery and anger management for sure.
---
Leveling as a priest has been so fun. I like healing the people I see dying to 3 mobs they pulled by accident.
---
Thx
---
Just be undead and eat everything you kill 👍
---
Have you tried tanaris yet?
---
Seriously. I forgot about all the drinking. But I loved the fast gameplay then and love it now.
---
Ya at 34 I switch from VW/Dots to succ/drain and it definitely took a while to adjust how I play
---
Ugh. You can keep it.
---
&gt;No. The role you come to the instance with is need roll. 
---
I don't know how true this is, because I've seen tank pallies roll on cloth +heal/+dmg gear and feral druids roll on +heal gear and no one ever bats an eye.
---
Sometimes they ask if it's cool that they roll on a certain item, but I've honestly never seen anyone raise a complaint about rolling need for an item that they can use, but aren't currently specced (or came to the instance with) for it.
---
&gt; You greed roll for gear that doesn't suit your current role ESPECIALLY if the set is literally designed for a different class and said class is present and wants it. 
---
Greed seems pretty obvious to me, it's just items you plan on selling/vendoring and have no intention of using personally. In this case the druid did plan to use the item.  
---
The set itself isn't designed specifically for rogues otherwise they would have added a class restriction like they have with T1+ sets, druids can gain benefits from those set pieces just as well as rogues for the most part. 
---
&gt;If no one else can use it then ask to need roll. 
---
It's always polite to ask, but I think OP was asking for the general etiquette. In this scenario because the druid was rolling on an item that they planned to use, that would be an upgrade to their previous gear and they gained 100% of the benefits from (e.g. no class-specific boosts), then it's more than fair game imo.
---
&gt;They most certainly did not both have valid claims and its pretty messed up the rogue had to pay a druid to not roll on his class set.
---
The rogue didn't have to, the rogue just didn't want to risk losing it on a roll because the rogue wanted it much more. The druid was planning on rolling for it until he saw how much more the rogue wanted it.
---
Right on. My first pvp zone (after leaving the safety of your faction's zone) I was ready for ganks all day. I got attacked at least 3 times by Gnome and Dwarf players, but each time I just stood still and /waved (they were way higher, what am I gonna do vs Boss level players?) and oddly enough, they saw that and just decided, nah, you're good and would /wave back and leave. Like, just a little poke of damage and then take off when realizing I'm not trying to start shit.
---
Every single fucking Human has run after me on foot the moment they even spot me, like a damn dog chasing a tennis ball, and they're usually with a friend, and there's usually a hunter/lock involved in the duo.
---
/spit
---
Well that's exactly the thing. Pick pocketing should subtract from the kill loot, but doesn't, 🤔
---
Shit, the lowest dps did more than that in SFK.
---
"DUNGEON"
---
How can you refuse such an impeccable sales pitch?
---
Anyone tried going to the island off Tanaris yet?
---
Seriously find a group who is willing to run with you a few times.
---
My dungeon group has three people who want it. We will run it until three of us have it, it's not actually relevant who wins the rolls as we aren't stopping until we all have it.
---
It takes some time to find good people but you save *so much* with smooth runs and helpful friends.
---
Spoken like a true player without 50% of the opposing faction being immune to fear and charm
---
Woo ping is jacked
---
Thinking of rolling on a PVE server for a break as I’m not enjoying the grind on the PVP server.
---
Always been interested in Classics Hunter so am going with that. Pretty interested in doing the trek from Durotar to Teldrassil to get an Owl. Would they be detrimental to instance groups with the Screech ability that reduces enemy AP? I’d hate to pull threat off the tank in an AoE situation.
---
Other thoughts were using an Owl when our solo and a Wind Serpent for any dungeon requirements?
---
I've been playing a mage lately, it's crazy how many people don't understand not to AoE when there's a polyd mob right next to them.
---
It's weird because while I can't speak for other servers, there are plenty of groups going on for content that don't demand spellcleave/aim for a certain specific comp. 3 Mage groups are a thing because they work very well for brute force leveling, but plenty of people go for normal groups where they're happy to find any DPS.
---
That's awesome! 🥰
---
Probably calling it cannibalism based on being Humanoids. :P
---
Bah id say elitists maybe? We already knew classic was cookie cutter much end game but it just seems some people want you to play their way like it was the first time you played tonre experience exactly the same community, but no it can't be and we are all better then we were back then also so ye it isnt hard anymore
---
To me, a full run is baelgar, arena, angerforge, golem, bar, incendius, coffer, flamelash, 7d, boss before emp, and emp. It's actually not as time consuming as it looks if you keep a good pace and don't wipe.
---
Very much this. As long as I'm not out numbered, of if they get the jump on me I usually come out a head as BM Hunter. Pet intimidate+ concussion shot +beastwrath while dpsing and if you can get a frost trap down too even better.
---
Let’s take a step back and look at what’s going on.  We’re seeing more posts complaining about mages ranting to AOE run dungeons.  
---
If this was “fun” to the majority of players then we would see posts about how great AOE/Cleave runs are. But we have the opposite. Which means it is only fun to a small group of players.  
---
Let people play the way they want.  But it takes more than one player to do AOE/Cleave runs.  
---
If people complain, then let them complain. Just find your AOE/Cleave group instead.  
---
Personally, I want to see more posts of successful AOE/Cleave runs instead.
---
Sorry, I mean buying something. Selling has a 1hr timer, you can see it in the AH api
---
Group up for quests (3+ in party ideally, but for you just having one other DPS is a benefit). Can usually find people at quest areas who are happy to have a warrior charging every mob so they have no down time either. 
---
Otherwise, as a solo warrior, you should be doing green quests/mobs.
---
It would have to be done through your mouse software program. I have a logitech g502
---
You should have run in and grabbed aggro, he was trying to do you a favor and save 5+ minutes.
---
You're a scrub for letting him die and wiping the group
---
Vw bubble is really nice for getting off that first fear if you're ganked and gives you a bit more survivability when out numbered.. Combine with a health stone or pot, you'll win most battles with good gear and skill
---
If the system was abused to the degree you are saying, blizzard would take action to either change it, or dole out punishment for exploiting to offending parties. I’m not so concerned about this as you have no idea what the report system is actually doing on the back end. You were probably silenced for good reason, and if not, resolve it with blizzard. Don’t come here looking for sympathy or to fear monger.
---
Seriously, are you trolling or just simple?
---
I’m level 38 and about 40g short for my mount, where should I grind that will have the best payout? I’m also a skinner. Thanks!!
---
&gt; What perks do you get from 315 engineering instead of 300
---
None.
---
Whats a shadowmeld vanish?
---
Yea, as you can see by your downvotes I was getting at that most people aren't close to 60 yet.  Those of you there are the minority of the playerbase.
---
You, unfortunately, have a larger voice since you have 12 hours a day to post online.
---
And. By pushing them to release content sooner you are trying to rush the rest of us.  Roll an alt. Take a break.  Don't ruin it for the rest of us.  Please.
---
There's no need for Phase 2 yet classic is literally not even a month old yet.  August 26 release date it's September 24. Lol
---
I never said anything was viable, just pointed out your fallacy in saying OP wasn’t talking about leveling.
---
Eh no shame in that. Was questing in SVT and 10 Ally 60s were camping nessingwarys expedition. Grabbed some rogue buddies and went and blocked the bridge in redridge mountains till they had to leave and come deal with us. Then went and turned in quests ;).
---
Is it true that you get BfA when you level a character to 60? I saw the blue post that got deleted, but that's it and would like confirmation.
---
I once invited someone to group and he goes “fuck off” and ignores me
---
Get off the road, quick!
---
Yeah bad tanks like to put the blame on DPS.
---
He took our mana1!
---
Buy a guild tabard
---
There are no flight paths in Silverpine for Alliance. That flight path NPC you see belongs to the Horde and will attack you.  Hope this answers your question.
---
One quick question, as a max level hunter, if I wanted to also get a wolf, should I tame 1-30lvl wolf and level him up?
---
where is the ghost seeing trinket from
---
Ayeeee why the downvote haha. Few too many locks dot me and run that’s why :p
---
Hahahaha
---
Is Lady Maye's Pendant better than Tooth of Gnarr?
---
I never said anything is viable.
---
I was pointing out the fallacy in saying OP is talking about PvP and not leveling.
---
He can do anything he likes with my ass.
---
You're right, it's not grid I'm using. It's Z-Perl Unit Frames
---
Definitely submit a bug report. It’s supposed to give you a debuff that lowers armor (or stamina, I don’t remember which) and turn you green as you say. I was planning on farming an oozeling myself for this very reason, good to know it’s not working as intended before I do.
---
This isn't strictly game related, but can anyone recommend me a decent, cheap keyboard? My current board is on its 4th replacement (thankfully they're all free replacements or I wouldn't have bothered) and it consistently develops keys that either don't work on half of the presses or input 2-3 times on one press.
---
Soo myyy chhat tyypiing coomes ooutt likke tthis.
---
I don't need any special bells and lights, just something under $50 that is super reliable.
---
Contrast that to a single target frost mage... I'm paranoid about more than one mob if I'm not completely full or life and mana.
---
Nice
---
Yeah I group up for quests but even then sometimes the quests take a while and I feel bad just dropping out in the middle of the quest. Basically just looking for some easy exp when the wife agro is roaming nearby.
---
Basilisks in southern shimmering flats or turtles. SM arm is also good.
---
I think you're too low for Arathi, maybe 1k Needles?
---
Grinding green mobs (mobs 2-4 levels below your level) is best for a warrior. You'll find that level range in Southern Barrens, Stonetalon Mountains, Ashenvale, and Hillsbrad.
---
~that's wheeen you make, an, alt~

 [https://classicdb.ch/?quest=5384](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=5384)

Uh.. no u.

Playing rogue at the moment, can confirm I gank quite a lot.
---
I am also on the campaign to get people to use Print Screen.  One of my pet peeves.  It takes longer to take a cell phone pic and upload it the it does to upload an actual screenshot.  I don't get it.

Its called cleanUI.
---
Any tips on getting better DPS in 20+ dungeons as a Warlock?
---
I really fall behind the curve unless there are 3+ mobs with no crowd control (dot them all) or a boss (dots again).
---
I know I bring utility in the way of SS/healthstones/summoning, but my DPS is lower than my Druid in cat form.
---
I love soloing with this alt but so far dungeons have been a drag.
---
Find yourself a decent guild with a couple of active warlocks and state your case for running shadow, not every guild is worried about min/max and the increased shadow damage will help the locks out. 
---
And dont tell them how you can still proc the shadow damage bonus as a healer ;)
---
&gt;Do not tap randomly during fights 
---
Unfortunately, that's how we work. We have plenty of ways of restoring our own HP. Resource management is our game.
---
If your lock is tapping below 50%, they're a moron, and if you're healing them above 50%, you're a moron. With exceptions of course, but it's really that simple.
---
&gt;Tel me as much bullshit as you want but doing a dungeon and having the tank with 45% healing taken and 40% the Warlock is not acceptable xd
---
That really depends. You know that there are situations where if the tank is getting all the heals they need and you have excess mana, noone else is pulling aggro, etc, that we should be focusing on maxing our DPS. It's efficient.
---
It actually makes training engineering a lot easier/cheaper due to how the +15 skill mechanic works.
---
my alt lock is only 27 but the vw has done me solid so far only looses agro if im having him tank multiple guys or standing there spamming fireballs
---
i need to go grab the bus tho just been lazy
---
I'm a gnome and Ive never been the aggressor, but I just got to STV, and after getting run over a few times I'm coming for you
---
Wouldn't call it useless. It forces out WoTF, so after 42+ you can death coil + fear almost immediately afterwards.
---
In the early stages of the game you can or could shadowmeld in combat so it’s like an extra vanish. I know they changed it I just dunno when they will or if they already did. And the + engineering just helps you level it up quicker but it’s not substantial
---
Guys, I got a bad feeling about Suicider...
---
No it doesnt. I never use reddit on pc
---
Tbh as a healer if locks are going ham with life tap I’ll leave em at like 30% for the majority of encounters and renew/bubble if need be.
---
Drain tank bruh
---
Desolace is terrible if you dont know the quests. I used classic wow live and got the good quests done quickly for 1.5 levels, went there at 33. The other two zones mentioned are ok but will run out of quests fast and STV is crowded. Try to do some SM if you can, it really helps fill in the gaps.
---
That probably only a minority will make use of.
---
I laughed so fucking hard at this. Thank you.
---
Google but I've gotten good exp/vendor loot from ratpors in Arathi or however you spell it.  And skinning gets me thicc leather that sells for 1g a stack.
---
When the ratpors are cleared I do the ogre camp for cloth which also sells well.
---
You're a newb

hmmmm
---
Get on the level of my sister. She walks with arrow keys and turns with them and she clicks with a touchpad. She plays on my laptop whenever she plays. I have a Razer Ouroboros and an XXL Razer Control Mousepad.
---
something I'm curious about is, how hard is it to find tanks at lvl 60? I've read a lot of speculation that because warriors are hard to lvl and many prefer to just dps that there'll be a thinning of warriors at endgame; I've also read that druids are pretty rare as well, and so by extension this would mean a shortage of tanks. 
---
So for those who've reached endgame how has it been?
---
http://i.imgur.com/OBibtiv.gif

i bet all of them are female
---
Exactly.
---
I reported this bug a while ago and have heard nothing. Glad someone else was able to replicate it. The bug can also be triggered by moving forward right as the eye is summoned. It seems the spell will cast and cancel simultaneously leaving the eye gone and your character stuck. Logging out and back on fixes character.
---
Same. Hit 60 just over 2 weeks ago and spent 12 hours trying to find a group for 6 types of dungeons (Scholo, BRD Arena runs, Princess Run, UBRS, LBRS, and Strath Live). Only found 3 groups in 12 hours. Kinda demotivated me and I haven't played since.
---
The frickin dungeon, you dolt. You don't know what a dungeon is? DUNGEON. Seriously. It's a dungeon.
---
It doesn't vanish.  It's an out of combat only hide with a 10 second cooldown.
---
45 minutes to an hour is typical iirc
---
seems likely more than 10k people play the game then
---
No way it should take 2 hours unless your group sucks and wipes a bunch.
---
Sounds like you had it coming. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also if it was actually this easy, then it would be abused and we would hear about it. Until then I can't give a single fuck.
---
This post was worth it for this line: " For the love of Christ, Yahweh, Muhammad, Vishnu, L Ron Hubbard, NEVER FUCKING PULL MOBS." Hahahaha!
---
1 freaking lvl away from this.. cannot wait. thank god

Gz
---
I knew I was on the classicwow sub and yet I still expected this.
---
He needs that extra mana and regen for all his shots and mending
---
Thanks for the info!! One question 
---
The phases mean there rolling out all of the vanilla content periodically? 
---
And even if it’s a year that’s fine by me I have a bunch of nostalgia playing a Nightelf and  I work full time with  school so I’m just playing at my leisure
---
nice
---
Yep I healed a melee cleave group today. 4 Warriors and 1 Shaman. Every single Warrior had the same looks.
---
Yeah, with zero tank stats at all, it's not something I would have rolled on if I were playing a warrior and anyone else in the group needed it. This particular case isn't too bad as there's better pre-raid drops out there for paladins. However, if, say, you happened to be horde with a shaman in party and went for [Gizlock's Hypertech Buckler](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17718/gizlocks-hypertech-buckler), you'd be crushed for it, as that's their pre-raid BiS. Something like [Crest of Supremacy](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10835/crest-of-supremacy) is more of a toss-up.
---
I don't expect players to have perfect knowledge of pre-raid items, but I do think they should still be careful in cases like this. When in doubt, ask the party.
---
If with a shaman just ofhand cuz windfury will override it
---
People aren't worried Heartseeker isn't populated. People are worried because it's MASSIVELY Alliance favored now.
---
You can’t even tell that it’s there
---
Even then, they take it seriously when you post someone's name in a screenshot and say "They can't be trusted" it's seen as witch hunting.
---
Well I got here too soon... anyways I always thought it was the other way around. I’ll wait for the experts to show up.
---
Burned out by spending less time farming a dungeon? 
---
What?
---
I did hover over it in the screenshot  :(
---
Ask the mage for food/water, don't expect the mage to hand out food.
---
Now you drag them all over server General chat. Smash those reputations.
---
daahh boooo
---
Auto equipping when mounted only works 50% of the time with no discernable pattern. If you try to swap sets in combat it will darken out a slot in your character screen and you can't change the item in that slot or use the add-on at all until you restart wow (reload ui doesn't fix it). This also happens randomly when using the add-on.
---
This
---
"Especially a mage"
---
I mean what do you mean by that ? Mages have it pretty easy finding groups.
---
Meanwhile in World chat.. they have no dignity camping Horde with LVL 60 Ally player in STV where everyone is around 35-45... I have this KOS addon specially for these people who kill lowbies and thinks they are pro
---
Honestly it's just because they dont understand that in the warlocks case, dumping the tank for dps actually increases their survivability.  Its counter intuitive to a new lock player. Just let them when you can.
---
just saying, if you find yourself knees deep in 6 mobs with a VW shield, 3s left on rain of fire and no mana, at that point you might be better off life tapping just to keep the burn up rather than going oom and sitting like a duck while they take your shield down.
---
His name is Robert Paulson
---
And yet you didn’t post a pic of what you’re accusing him of doing.
---
...like in retail?
---
if you're going bear, you're not taking imo shred or blood frenzy, and those are both pretty important for cat dps
---
No, [originally](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Shadowmeld) it wasn't able to be used in combat.  That was a WotLK change.
---
Faster is still faster.  Making the group isn't a problem... the problem still lies in getting tank and healer, mainly the tank.  Mages and warlocks are easy to pick up so passing on a hunter or rogue causes 0 time difference.  This wouldn't be as much of an issue if the aoe grinding spots weren't heavily contested in the world but they are so the mages aoe in a safe environment.  The tank and healer get brought along for the xp ride and all are happy.  Everyone except the rogue or hunter that don't want to make their own group and just want someone to say "lf1m generic dps".  Ignore the spell cleave groups and it doesn't affect people not doing it.  Play how you want.
---
Well if it doesn’t work I can allways dps. I should clarify it’s as an offtank so picking up lose adds and taking the heat of healers. Tbh we have about 12 warriors ranging from 50-60 at the momment so plenty of tanks. Just letting op know he doesn’t have to be in an elitist guild. There’s plenty of guild that would accommodate everyone.
---
I want those unit frames and the energy meter.

Shut up and take my money!! :D
---
5 levels is plenty of time to get mount money. Stop training at trainer now. Stay away from AH unless its only to sell. Dont buy anything. Get good water from mages, trade something useful if you have a prof. I give pots, u could trade some armour patches. And grind grind grind. I wouldn't be too worried now though till youre about to ding 39. You get 0 xp from sfk so you wont level and the higher you are the faster you will get through the dungeon and have more likelihood of killing the bosses.
---
Gl!
---
lulw mages only decurse on most fights, while warriors and rouges fill the dps meters
---
Yes this is such a weird phenomenon.
---
Reminds me of when you get to a save point in a game like dark souls and you’re like, “fuck I could just stay here and not have any more struggles”.
---
buy it, find a female, /kneel, trade ring
---
Check the facebook page of sayonara sales, sometimes ppl do have cheap parts.  
---
Also check Mercari for used stuff.   
---
If you buy new, a 17000Yen Deskmini A300, 3200G for 10 000, SSD for &lt;5000 and 8gb cheap ram for 5000ish.  
---
If you want to compare price go to [kakaku.com](https://kakaku.com)  
---
But a laptop for 30000 is not gonna be easy to find, unless 5+ years old
---
These people must never of got past MC and BWL.
---
My experience on arugal (server big enough to still have queues during peak hours) has been quite bad. Typically you can fill a group within a few minutes, however the tank may not show up for 10+ minutes and the group will fall apart unless people are patient
---
Will of the Forsaken is better in PvP than berserking. Troll is the optimal PvE race.
---
Always use poisons. Yeah, they cost a bit of money but you'll kill stuff faster and more reliably thus earning the money back and then some.
---
If you find a gryphon master there you can absolutely use it.  If you see a bat handler, you may want reevaluate your surroundings.
---
Mate you're a warrior. Offer to tank for lib/arms/gy, 90% you're going to be the preferred dude.
---
I'm a rogue and running dungeons have been one of my biggest money earner. I can't imagine how much more you'd earn as a much sought after class.
---
This is neither a complete sentence, nor spelled correctly.
---
I'm not sure what you're even trying to say here.
---
Because this subreddit have constructed some weird fetishzation of "how to play the game properly" where you have to level slowly, read all the quests, only run each dungeon once, only create groups where you have the trinity of 1 tank, 1 healer, and 3 dps, only engage one group of adds at a time, CC is 100% needed, etc, etc, and just keep circlejerking this over and over til it become undeniably true and holy in their mind.   
---
And everyone who breaks their sacred view of the game are zoomers, stream kids, retail players, and so on.  
---
Personally I play this game to level fast and get lots of loot, and if I had rolled a mage I would 100% have spellcleaved my way to 60 if it meant I leveled three times as fast, and sure looks more fun.
---
And this sub always have something to irrationally complain about anyway, first layering, then streamers, then skeletons, now spellcleave. I wonder what's up next.
---
Holy shit! Blast from the past

How does one know if they're on a dead server?  Deviate Delight apparently has low population and the faction imbalance is bad and supposedly growing worse.  Did I screw myself by coming here?  Should I cut my losses now and leave, since I just started on Friday?  Are there any nearly balanced 50-50 PvP servers that don't have significant queues, but still aren't "dead"?
---
What happens if you cast Eye again once it ends?
---
Warrior is actually the most played class in Classic, according to available data. Druids are the least played.
---
However, most of these Warriors intend on being DPS Fury specced Warriors.
---
There is a shortage of tanks at all levels of the game.
---
It's pretty obvious that Blizzard is lying about mob leeway.
---
Someone actually looked at the original code from 1.12 client and the string that handles leeway actually has a check to make sure BOTH 'actors' are players and not NPCs.
---
The current implementation of leeway existed for PvP.  It did not however exist for mobs, that is why there was that glitch that allowed people to kite mobs forever with back-peddle turning.
---
Blizzard is simply lying about mobs having leeway because they are unwilling, or unable to fix it without there being other bugs added as well.
---
It's actually what I'm doing rn ahaha!!! I told healers to stay away!
---
You know you're getting one of these when Alterac Valley comes out right?
---
Ah yes, the bright yellow shoulders. For when you want to be extra stealthy.
---
BANG AND THE DUNE IS GON!
---
PVP without PVP trinkets is great IMO.
---
Most of the people who clamored to 'want vanilla' actually wanted TBC.
---
It still has all the camaraderie and difficulty that everyone wanted, and it actually much more QoL and balanced without being all of the WotLK stuff people have grown to despise. 
---
It's a constant comment in all 3 different server guilds Im in as of late.

I farmed there for like 5 levels at least and didn't get anything 😅
---
What healer are you playing?
---
The AS boost from berserking. Especially since, of all classes, warrior is going to be the most likely to be able to pop zerking at a health percentage that allows the maximum benefit.
---
On Herod, theres been a dude called uncleduck camping the thousand needle fp for 2 days straight almost. Level 60 rogue. Sometimes I'll get someone from world chat to come help out and kill him and loses to every single other 60, but then waits 20 mins, and goes back to killing everything and everyone. What kind of super autism is this.
---
Nice congrats! Also what UI is that and does that bottom right option for stones etc come with it?
---
nice xp, im 58 and this would be great boost
---
I've seen a lot of burnout in my guild from trying to get to 40 and have the mount, including myself. I took a few days off after hitting 40.
---
You're right, and [this is exactly how it should be](https://extrafabulouscomics.com/comic/200/).
---
First thing I bought from the AH after farming for 5 hours and not seeing one. At 3g buyout (had been 25+ previously) that seemed like a much better deal.
---
Apparently people have caught on though, prices are soaring once more.
---
You should join our guild on Rattlegore! We do alot of dungeon runs! Pm me
---
Agreed, just dont spam the chat asking for help every minute.  
---
Just ignore those people, chances are that they are toxic in every aspect of the game.
---
Start telling em 15s (seconds) from now on.. hahahaha

Goblin is better. But every pro levels gnomish, learns and creates the useful shit then unlearns it to learn goblin. And then you stick with goblin.

Can it be equipped?

My friend who is a Warrior working on the Summoning quest to get his axe got killed by the final lvl 40 mob, no way in hell he has to get the mats again right? We spent all day doing this, so how is he supposed to summon it now?
---
What is the general consensus when it comes to locked chests then? If only the rogue can open it then, why should the rest of the party be allowed to roll for it?
---
One thing i've found that helps is to save your enrage ability until you are out of combat and your rage start depleting. Enrage puts you in combat so you can keep your rage stacked long enough for healers to drink.
---
Based on people who write leveling guides recording their time to 60 across many run 44 is approximately half way to 60 in terms of time. 52 is about two thirds and 58 is 90%. 1-20 is about 10%.
---
Can we get some kine of megathread for all of the whiny tanks and healers to vent?
---
It's like half the sub right now.
---
This on Grobbulus?  Because this exact thing happened on Grob a few hours ago.  A group of about 5 alliance or so thought they would just claim the hunter camp.  The Alliance did hold t for a while, but eventually the Horde got fed up and ran and took it.  Then the Horde corpse camped the alliance.
---
I got ya. That’s just what I read on one of the class/race discussion pages. I haven’t leveled my rogue at all yet. And I’m vanilla I was human to help me with rogue vs rogue fights with perception.
---
Die Bahnhöf ist im Kartoffel
---
As a healer seems this like a bit of a little dick move, to ruin rep, over a bad group, I'm going to go out on a limb and guess this was just a pug group for a non 60 dungeon?
---
Straight up atlas, atlas loot is separate.
---

---
What they don’t understand is that some people have leveled to 60 dozens or more times on prservers so they aren’t “ruining” a thing. Also, in my case I leveled from about 25-60 almost entirely through dungeons as a prot warrior back in the day because I didn’t understand the respec system. Many people didn’t and I knew of so many healers and tanks who leveled the same way. 
---
The other big thing is that they don’t understand how the mentality of gaming has change immensely over the years, and part of what makes classic timeless is that it has the ability to still have something for people 15 years later who are totally different people. Back then I was 14 or 15 and had an adventure and couldn’t believe it when I finally got to sixty. Nowadays I’m an experienced wow player through multiple expansions and my interests have shifted to performance based and getting better. I’m essentially a totally different person, but I can enjoy the same game because there are so many ways to play it. Hell, part of the reason I think I like it is because I remember being a young kid and looking at that Tauren main tank warrior in a full set in orgrimmar and thinking he was a badass lol. Now I get to live out a childhood badass fantasy I didn’t have the ability do now that I certainly can today. 
---
I’ve made tons of awesome friends and memories from both ways of playing. It’s just different. 
---
If people want to be upset by that that is okay, but honestly *they* are the ones who don’t get classic. The fact that we can play the game so differently and for such different reasons of enjoyment is a large reason classics design philosophy is better than the point A to point B progression systems you have in retail. The “you must grind mobs solo to 60 for the true classic experience” types are just the ultimate purity spiral from some of the more over zealous “no changes” types imo.
---
The real hardcore way to do it is thus: Go gnomish, craft all the BOP trinkets and gadgets. Drop the profession, relearn it and go Goblin. The gnomish stuff just requires Eng skill rank to use, not specifically Gnomish.
---
yeah that sounds like bullshit.
---
When ppl stop being rude af to healers and tanks is when the posts will stop
---
If I may suggest: I have no idea where you live but if you can get a hold of a Dell Optiplex 790 or newer, you should be fine. 4th gen Intel CPUs have good enough integrated graphics to run WoW classic. However, it wouldn't be expensive to drop in say, a GT 1030 for a GPU. (So long as it fits in the case). I currently have an Optiplex 790 with an i5-2400 and a GTX 1060 3gb and it is honestly overkill for classic (200+ FPS on classic settings, 100~ FPS on max settings). However, I haven't played retail so I could not say definitively that my computer could run it well. I don't have the recommended specs for either games memorized but those would be specs to shoot for even if you're trying to play at medium settings on retail. My situation is nearly identical to yours, I run basic Office applications and surf the web in addition to wow classic. This is to say that my performance needs are fairly low. If you can find an old office computer that meets the recommended specs for Retail, I say go for it. Again, drop in a lower tier GPU or even a used mid tier GPU and you should be golden. Again, system requirements are your best guide to the actual functionality of the game on your computer. My .02$. Good luck!

You forgot about running like Naruto.
---
Post in game names 😜
---
That still nukes XP unless you do like 60% of the damage to the mob.

I got asked last night in a dungeon if was ever going to drink haha. Just let me kill myself slowly and then toss a heal on me after you panic thinking I have aggro.

You must be lucky on the druid front.

As a druid I gank any alliance I see fighting a mob unless I think they can take me.  Most of the time I linger for a few mins while they pull a couple mobs without healing.  I normally kill them within 10 seconds.
---
Agree
---
Neat, you shared your battlenet tag, brb reporting you for sharing confidential emails as prohibited by the ToS and outing yourself in an easily identifiable way.
---
JK I don't care enough to do that lol but be careful man, this is the kinda thing they don't give warnings for, they full on ban/delete your entire bnet account, not just your WoW access. Just an fyi

Have you seen the videos of the raids at all and saw the meters? If you did youd know you're full of it.

Gnomish has uniques that goblins can't get. Like battle chicken and deathray.
---
Goblin doesn't have anything unique worth mentioning. But they can craft some boe stuff that sells well.
---
Tanks and priests should not have problem finding groups to do dungeons with, and that's a moneymaker right there.
---
I've even been vendoring greens from dungeonsi can't sell and have made quite a bit of gold. As a rogue.
---
Imagine the amount of dungeons you can run as a sought after class lol.
---
Good bot
---
This reminds me of Lyft/Uber ........
---
This doesn't account for burst damage though. Fast heals cost more mana.
---
Hard to ignore cleave groups when that is 75% of what is being spammed in the chat. Like I said, effecting my experience. I just want to get into the dungeon and heal, I don't care what the group comp is because it is really easy content. In fact, I would say it is more interesting to get different comps going.
---
Dragonscale is Mail. Rogue it aint.
---
You're hearing about it right now. It can and has been abused in retail.
---
Link
---
/moo
---
Would have been useful before everyone already knew about it? Good effort though.
---
It's much more than slightly longer, if you're fighting 4 mobs at a time rather than 12-40 the entire dungeon. it takes about twice as long, if not a little longer. I.e you aren't doing Cath in under 18 mins clearing it normally but 6 mins AoE clears are a thing. 
---
But ye, spamming arcane in a group that plans to kill shit 1 at a time is pointless unless you threat manage it by mixing in ST because all that causes is a huge strain on the healer and a stressed out tank. It's DPM is still higher than frostbolts though when there's more than 1 target, so worth sprinkling in if you aren't going to wind up wanding or tanking as a result.
---
Can you answer this, /u/MrBlackMaze? Please.
---
&gt;Why should they get an equal chance if they're not even a dps spec and are on a healing spec?
---
Because they will be using it and gaining an upgrade over their previous gear, just like the rogue will be. Plus, people swap specs all the time, and sometimes getting a better piece of equipment is reason enough for someone to swap specs. 
---
I've had so many pallies/druids/shamans roll on +healing cloth gear and no one is really bothered by it (Even if not specced for healing). I don't see why druids rolling on DPS items is so different. 
---
&gt;That's weak af
---
I think it's intended, otherwise Blizzard would have put class restrictions on the T0 sets like they have on T1/T2.
---
dude how would you know youre a rogue.
---
We use 4 mages and 1 priest its the most optimal  comp for aoe farming. We dont need locks past 40 when we get ice barrier.
---
I pull myself as a frost mage.
---
If you send regular mail to an alt and click return it also comes back instantly.
---
It tried to see if I could add more items to a message before hitting return but unfortunately no.
---
only went to Desolace for my mage quest eventually, went from mid thirties to 41 by jupming between STV, Alterac/Hillsbrad, Arathi, Dustwallow, and finally Badlands.

Man I must be doing it wrong. I got my feral Druid to 42 and I had to stop. It’s so so so slow to kill things. Sure your survival skills are great, but it evens out when it takes so long to kill anything.

---
I’m leveling my warrior with a rogue and we almost never have any downtime unless we pull too much at once.
---
Depending on level, class and professions couldn´t you even make much more then 25 gold in 5 hours ? yesterday i earned around 12+ gold by farming mithril for around 2 hours ( without riding though ). I imagine at higher level 2 hours of faraming would have yielded me even more money. Has to hurt when the price drops so hard after farming 5 hours, that opportunity cost is crazy high.
---
It would be like a bigger BG.
---
And the winner of this guild vs guild BG would be the best guild in the server and get some rewards or a title.
---
I played another game like this it didnt have factions but had a massive war to determine best guild.
---
Guilds would make alliances and become enemys just to fight to win the guild battle.
---
It pretty much worked like faction vs faction but instead guild vs guild.
---
Honestly i love this system because its so fun when guilds have alliances and full out wars and drama . Guild will switch alliances and betray other guilds to win.
---
I really don't get this "warrior is horrible to level" thing... is it because my gf plays a healer, so I never need to worry about my lifebar?

It's reddit, since when do people need to know me for me to post a random comment? That's very silly. If people wish to answer my question they can. If they wish to insult me then they may do so.

---
LEEEEEERRRRROOOYYYYY    JJJEEENNKINS!!!
---
try restarting your pc i had this issue and i restarted and its fine now
---
it absolutely is
---
That will never happen; there are rude people in all roles and that isn't going to change anytime soon.
---
You just have to deal with it when it happens and move on.
---
No reason to be petty about it and run to Reddit for back pats.
---
&gt;For the casual player, you simply cannot get enough done in the space of two hours, and two hours is a long play session for a casual player. 
---
This is just your opinion being purported as fact, based on your personal opinion of what a 'casual' player would view as having having gotten "something done".
---
Two hours of levelling is just that, 2 hours of levelling. That's plenty progress right there.
---
If you go to endgame, 2 hours would be enough to clear a dungeon for pre-bis farming, or enough to farm plenty for your next raid.
---
&gt;why you can level to endgame in retail far faster than you can level to 40 in classic
---
Actually, no. People seem to overestimate how long classic levelling takes in a world where you can stick on guidelime and be routed around an optimal path, or join a dungeon and speed run through it.
---
1-120 in retail isn't as fast as you probably think. Intentionally so, because it makes people buy boosts. In fact, it was only recently that people were complaining about how slow it was to level, and they reduced XP required; but it's still not THAT quick.
---
Similarly, just because someone is casual that doesn't mean they can never arrange a longer play session. It just means that typically they do not. 
---
&gt;Yes, you can just log on and faff about for an hour. But casual gamers want to see results for their time just as much as hardcore players do. And classic doesn't provide anything for that.
---
Again, this is just based on your personal opinion of what would be "results".
---
&gt;A casual player won't get to 60; he is theoretically capable of doing so, because getting to 60 is easy, but he drop the game long before he gets there; because at a casual gamer's time commitment retail would have two more expansions out before he'd hit 60.
---
This isn't 2005. It doesn't take THAT long to get to 60 these days. 
---
Now, I'd say plenty of people will get bored (casual or not) and quit around the 50-60 bracket but that's a different matter entirely.
---
Also, and most importantly in all honesty, unlike retail your progress especially in regards to gear etc does not get reset every time a new content patch/tier comes out.  If you're casual and you are farming your pre bis and you eventually manage to get your gear from mc or whatever you aren't going to simply lose it in a month when its invalidated by the next tier. Certainly not to the same extent as on retail.
---
Anyhow, to me, whether something is casual friendly usually relates to the level of time required, how frequently their time spent is going to be invalidated, and difficulty of content.
---
Classic does not have difficult content. It does not frequently invalidate progress, and although the overall time investment is quite high, it does not have a short time frame in which you must spend that time in order to be relevant.
---
For example, if you were casual but wanted to mythic raid in wow you would HAVE to spend a lot of time in a very short window because if you geared up over a longer period for example, you would be invalidated by the next tier/raid/boss nerfs before even getting to experience what you were playing for.
---
You can replace mythic raid with anything of a similar nature, do not get hung up on that part it is just an easy to reference example.
---
In classic if you want to see MC and beat ragnaros, you aren't limited to needing to rush for 60 and gear up to fight said boss in a short timeframe like you would on retail.
---
Transferred off of a highly Horde populated server to join a more balanced server. Regret that decision now. Really wish they would allow the census app again.

Alliance or horde pvp on kromkrush? Is it competitive? I’d rather play the underdog.

---
2H tanking is for AoE tanking, it's not about the rage it's about the whirlwind
---
That's the ony attunement questline.
---
Especially considering most of your threat generation doesn't do damage.
---
There's a decent number of quests between Darnassus / Felwood / Ungoro, so I would plan on doing something like felwood -&gt; un'goro -&gt; felwood -&gt; un'goro or starting with un'goro instead.  That's if you want to do the linken quest you can keep it *mostly* efficient by doing it that way.
---
I’ve ganked a many Horde because of your first post. I don’t hold grudges really, but sometimes I fear that someone I’ve taken out has me on their list. One thing I must say, those Horde I’ve 1v1’d would need a friend to take me out.
---
What!!! You are nuts man! I love level 1-30 as alliance. I feel that’s the best zone work the game has. Westfall, duskwood, all the starting zones, redridge. Man, there isn’t a zone I don’t like up till 30.
---
thank you!
---
I am sorry but your interpretation of this rule is wrong. This post will be removed shortly by a moderator because you included his name primarily and also added the "is not to be trusted" part. That is against reddit website rules.
---
her did a second run! What hard understand that??
---
From what I’m reading it still works in combat and can be macroed to go directly into stealth, but I can’t confirm at this time.
---
Hello! I'm new to levelling a priest, and doing so with a warrior, and most guides say to take spirit tap but most of the time the warrior gets the kill so it never procs. What is a good spec for a Priest levelling with another class? or a good alternative to spirit tap until I get to level 40?
---
Not every class gets invited for ZF gy runs, or if they do they aren't actually that fast.
---
If you are alliance, go join Earthfury. The AH ratio here is ridiculously ally favored.
---
Nice.
---
Thank you very much for this guide
---
As a arms warrior tank, ive had my fair share of DPS pulling new mobs intentionally while the healer is drinking. In this case I often will pull out my 2H, switch to battle stance and let them tank it. 
---
If you are pulling, then you are tanking!

---
Like is anyone on it?  I guess.
---
Tested, if you fully summon the eye and then hit escape to despawn it, you are free to move once again!
---
Congrats. At least you can farm this rare easily.
---
I would argue it's even playable solo.  Just painful...
---
'Layer abuse' was only a problem when it let you reset instances while still being inside them. Changing layers in the outside world is perfectly fine.
---
Its slightly horde favored, but very slightly.
---
Then how was I supposed to help defend Stormwind from Horde?
---
Damn what a barbarian

Really hope he sees this man, you deserve some of that good dick
---
It only took me about an hour and a half to get from 0 mining to 125 for iron as a thirty five or so. Grab tons of copper ore from a starting zone (I was in durotar), smelt it all, buy tin ore from the ah, smelt it all, smell all those bars into bronze and you should be at like 110-115. From there it's just mining tin nodes and hoping for silver nodes to appear. If you're lucky and they do, silver smelting also gives skillups.
---
Not today
---
Then everyone are retards!
---
I thought it might.  My idea was that it was stuck in a state where it thought you were controlling the eye still, and getting a new eye might help reset it.
---
I like using the felhunter. Slightly lower dps than the succubus but still pretty good. Lots of utility if you run into caster mobs.  Stealth detection is nice too. Magic dispel for use on myself in a pinch. 
---
Succubus is good too but in general I prefer the felhunter utility.

Alright, thank you for the wisdom bomb.

i played all evening tonight thinking i couldn't reinstall and add some addons, i was wrong thankfully!

When it first happened, I had assumed I’d be free to move once the allotted amount of time had passed for the eye to despawn, but nope.

You may be asking why I don't just become a dirty clicker.. And I don't have a good reason for you.
---
Just a boujee ass ring. I can't afford it so I can't really answer these questions lol
---
I was on my way to Swamps of Sorrow on my Warlock, when suddenly a wild Stitches crossed my path. There was a bunch of low level Alliance running around like headless chickens, so I've put on my big draintanking britches and deleted him, then went on my way. 
---
If this was an anime, then it'd be like if the villain built up over the entire season was about to engage the heroes, only for a future villain to appear outta nowhere and kick the first villain's ass to falunt his superiority, lol.
---
Then i spent half an hour trying to go throigh Deadwind Canyon, horsehopping because these fucking vultures kept aggroing and killing me :(.
---
I brought mine out for the chicken escort quests.
---
Ferda!
---
Great job advertising for them
---
Idk. As an emo mage, I first was jealous of mages and their AOE ability.  
---
Then I see them in dungeons and they are soending 50% of the time drinking their free water.
---
Drinks arent that expensive in the grand scheme.
---
I guess maybe theyre fun if you like to AFK a lot while you drink.
---
I did the same thing, i was the priest as you are. I learned to time mind blast for last hits to get spirit tap, or communicate with your buddy to let your SwP finish the job. It isnt being selfish, it will legit half your guy's down time and save you a TON of money on water
---
This place is so cool, as well as dazzling to the eyes. I started playing during late Burning Crusade and when I got here in Un'Goro Crater, I thought this cave, the crystals, and the manual were one of the most fascinating and immersive things I'd yet come across. It made me want to level more slowly so I could enjoy it longer!
---
Just tried that to no avail. Thought it had worked at first, but then when I tried to buff, it shot up to ~1000ms then finally settled around 400ms after a while. I don't know what it could be since Retail servers are fine, I even when into combat on them to make sure, but Classic keeps me at a high latency.
---
Considered it before starting, but I am studying Korean full time and it’s a great way for us to practice korean while making korean friends in the country (and helping them with their English). Also 2ms ping is p. Sweet!!
---
The escort is the worst part for me. The dungeon is already plenty long, but watching that tauren walking at a snail-pace makes you feel like you are wasting your time. At least the xp was alright and I used the quest-staff for 11 levels.
---
What zone is this...sorry noob player here
---
The funniest!!!
---
Most level 60 Mages on my server are hot garbage and do all the negative things described above.
---
You wouldn't be able to tell, that's how balanced it feels.
---
F\*\*\*, hmm can you quickly uninstall/reinstall?
---
i know its a pain but id try it
---
yea it's actually awful but blizzard dgaf
---
I've tanked in every expansion except for BFA and I've developed a healthy hatred for hunters based solely on those who could not turn growl off
---
does this also fix vanish?
---
You can’t use it in combat. Its useless for a rogue
---
You are not supposed to redact their name. You're supposed to reveal their name and drag their reputation.
---
Arramis*
---
That’s exactly what I did and now I’m lvl like 45 and got 90g. I got my mount at around 41
---
And if they don't, then what?
---
Best solution: don’t use world chat. It’s been trashed in plenty of servers now. Use trade chat or the NOC-vendor style addon.
---
You're a tank so soloing is rough.  I vote SM lib.  Just do it over and over theres always geoups looking dor a tank and as a tank you can just keep your own going--just get new healers/dps as they drop every couole of runs.
---
Good money just from looting the trash.
---
I have atlas installed but still no map when in dungeon. Where did you get your download from for a good version?
---
His name is bluto
---
What server?
---
Gnome or go home
---
This bring the power hungry hungry hippo out from the mud
---
In dungeons yes. In raids healers love that to pointlessly pad the meters.
---
Kotor fan myself .
---
He will get almost no exp from mobs, in dungeons or otherwise.
---
No idea, no real way to tell.
---
The difference is when a DPS is bad they're easily replaced. It really sucks having a shitty tank because everyone knows it's a huge hassle to find an actual good one.
---
I can only assume people that do this have a mental disability.  He didn’t even get them to 35 so he could use the arcanite transmute/mooncloth craft cooldowns for passive income...
---
Have auto turning addon
---
Bind key to interact
---
Alt z
---
Interact with npc
---
I'm in a similar position--- probably going to end up doing a custom PC build that fits system requirements in the same budget with amazon/ebay parts, but Aliexpress has the same things too and should be fine with Japanese shipping as long as you're willing to wait a couple weeks
---
Don't research anything lol.  You'll lose the magic.
---
Just load up the game and play.  You'll have a blast and learn the game organically 
---
By using guides you are taking away from the games experience

Twitch App and CurseForge (same company now) miles better than wowinterface.
---
Twitch App has MANY more addons.  Almost all authors host on CurseForge.  Some host on wowinteface, but certainly not all.  Very, very few host on wowinterface only.  If you want an addon, it's going to be on CurseForge.
---
Authors usually update to CurseForge first and foremost.
---
Twitch App is reliable regarding addon versions.  wowinterface minion often gets confused and downloads wrong version.  Always loads of complaints about that.  It's because authors use CurseForge more so CurseForge versions are going to be the most accurate.
---
CurseForge rewards authors with real money which encourages authors to create and update.  wowinterface doesn't give authors anything.
---
If you're not using an ad blocker, Wowinterface website adverts are way over the top.  Some of them are massive and annoying.  Very little thought for user experience.  CurseForge ads are much easier to ignore.
---
Wowinterface, if you make a suggestion as many people have they always say good idea, we'll look into that, watch this space... but they never do anything about it.  you ask about it 2 years later and the answer's always the same 'sorry got sidetracked, moved onto something else'.
---
Spriest is not a meme spec. Running one is optimal. However the gear is worth more on other casters. To ignore your spriest completely is a real dick move though.
---
The first three dropped in a row. I thought it was a bug at first. Realistically I just used all of my RNG luck on this one quest, and nothing will go my way again
---
/gquit
---
Its kinda annoying when healers spam heal then complain or say “I’m not healing you for your mana”.
---
It’s like, throw me a renew every fight or two that’s all I need? I’m usually not pulling aggro so it’s okay for me to be at half health... that’s just what I’m used to.
---
After reading the title I though I clicked the wrong subreddit....
---
They took all the good shit out of Nogginfogger so there aren't as many transforms as there were.
---
Just SMOrc. I never notice it, there’s like 36,000 horde players lol.
---
Most played, but maybe not most popular at 60. Newbies will default to warrior and just stop after a while when it gets tough.
---
I'm an enchanter. If I was a loot pirate wouldn't I agree with you? I look at enchanting as an investment. I get tons of mats from greeding blues and greens in dungeons, and tons from quests. I buy some others to push me through some levels if I fall behind. And I subsequently get no complaints when I charge a bit for higher level enchants.
---
As a warlock I’m constantly killing myself.
---
It's standing there because of the water, it is "hitched" to the hitching post behind the water bowl.
---
It's awesome, you're just bad.
---
Amazing that you haven't been ganked by druids! Absolute cowards, the lot of em - burst you out of stealth when you're fighting mobs, then run away faster than you when it doesn't go their way.
---
Isn't there a quest for a raptor in Ungro Crater? You have to feed a baby raptor or get his teeth... it has been a long time.
---
Not be shitty at playing prot?
---
It is easier and way more forgiving at lower levels. Not even trying to learn will handicap you later if you have never ranked Vanilla...
---
Except the subs failed to reach BfA release levels. So... meh. And that's at launch. They will have dropped since.
---
What does drain tanking mean, and what does that rotation look like at lvl 38?
---
It’s so nice while leveling.
---
I believe there is a Level range? like 10 levels or something like that?
---
This is not true, and it is super easy to test it. I face aggroed something on my war and used rank 2 battle shout with my druid friend in the party. After one rank 1 rejuv with him standing in melee range he pulled aggro. I face pulled another of the same thing, used battle shout twice (no one clicked off their buffs). Friend pulled aggro after exactly two rank 1 rejuvs.
---
Tested a few times, always consistent. Never hit anything with melee, always entered combat with the same amount of rage, always made sure rejuv did no overhealing.
---
This is consistent with what threat meters show as well, with every cast of battle shout adding exactly the same threat to the mob, regardless of first use or subsequent uses. Does the same threat every cast while in combat as long as it is hitting the same number of people.
---
Yeah once you get to Iron and Mithril bars you start making like 4-5g/stack. Everybody needs Mithril right now.
---
No it's different.
---
The boss to kill though.
---
So, it is just worth it to abandon the efforts and change servers now while I'm only a few days in?  So I don't get stuck for a long ride to disappointment?  Either way, thank you for the quick replies and input.
---
Anyone from Kromkrush have any input?  I was also looking at Incendius too.
---
Everquest has been doing it for a decade now, with massive success.
---
Diabetes took her foot too!
---
World chat is not a Blizzard moderated channel and is simply put just like the gold seller spam chat invites.
---
Neither one is better than the other. 
---
Gnome is better against mages. Dwarf is better against other rogues and hunters. 
---
You just gotta pick one and stick with it
---
This UI pains my eyes
---
This game has sound?
---
I agree.  As melee I never ever want to be able to land an attack, please listen to this guy.
---
Clearly wants to do sm
---
To the UBRS door? On pservers you could target him from the entrance portal.
---
Yet more proof that automated reporting is a crap feature.
---
I guess I can try that. I'm done playuing for the night, so I dont have to worry about geting back on for a while.
---
I really dont get why they cant just run to the spot lol
---
I have both but still leveling so I haven't devllved too deeply into that.  I plan on looking further into things despite that predetermined bis/specs
---
Are there cooking recipes that give you mana back instead of HP? I'm level 39 and have my cooking leveled, looking for a way to make my own drink instead of buying. Thanks!
---
If I remember correctly it binds to the wearer after equip hence why it can be used as a wedding ring in roleplay or actualy WoW marriages and has no real appearance i used to think it did like a glitter on your hand or something but it doesnt.
---
&gt;undead first place
---
And noone was surprised.
---
Wasn't sure so i played it safe, please forgive my sin :(
---
Just having a nice drink while watching someone getting mauled.. Nice.
---
As many characters as you want.
---
You roll with the succubus for most pet damage. You put talents into improved drain life and fel concentration to maximize health gain and decrease knockback while channeling. You still pick up nightfall since it can proc off of drain life too. So basically you CoA, Corruption and Siphon life a target and then drain life since you’ll have all the aggro at that point. You can fit in a shadow bolt from nightfall as well
---
wow, what an amazing macro.

Is it your opinion that you only take main spec healers, or is it an actual fact that you only take main spec healers?

Theirs fell off.

I am currently at 29 with my mage and god I hate it.... aoe farming is meh and questing is even more meh...
---
I don’t heal face tank groups unless I have mage water or the group supplies the ridiculous amount of water this tanking takes.  It’s not hard, but I’m not footing the bill solo for the group.
---
The only thing that annoys me about this, is I used to love the badly worded adverts. That sounds like someone who natively speaks English has written it. I want 15 year old ads...
---
Turtle scales, AFTER your tribal quests, is going at a great rate. You could sell them after getting pre req for tribals.
---
I love stories like this. Glad you’re enjoying the game so much, man. Thanks for keeping us alive!
---
It does work.
---
You just let the dumb ones succumb to natural selection and force them to watch you and the tank duo every pull for 10 minutes until they learn.

He said renew

Go gnomish, make everything, then respec goblin. Enjoy the best of both.

I just typed out a sales pitch for selling enchants to upgrade high enough to use fiery, I put it 1 time in world and I put it in trade. Just thought it was funny that the dude banned me within minutes while he was in a MC run
---
That's not what an opinion is
---
How exactly do you know these numbers? I mean how much of it is just speculation vs actual numbers?
---
Hey asurin, next time im in dire need for some gametime (im often in money troubles) i will defiantly hit you up :,)
---
I'm shadow spec, I heal better then just about every holy spec I've met.
---
The person matters, spec means like 5% during dungeons, it's so pointless to spec into healing while leveling lol.
---
I also drink 3 times during a dungeon. LOL
---
If I saw quests were getting too clogged, I just aoe grinded
---
Yeah you right mages need help in pvp
---
OMEGALUL
---
Youre never going to hit enough agi to rage starve. You also generate more rage on crits. If youre leveling with deep wounds its a huge difference

let us kno

Always balanced...sounds like retail is knicking at the door.

Are you alliance? Perhaps it's different for you.

When I play human alliance, I always get the feeling all of them/us are secretly serial killers. There's something off about the whole bunch.

---
This is a mechanical keyboard, so it is really reliable, but a bit loud if you do not like the sound. I‘d advice checking those kind of keyboards out in a store first if you are not familiar with them.
---
Hit 60 on my first char and want to start planning my next. Want to try out a leveling guide. Classic wow live or Joana? Don’t mind paying for the later if it’s better.

Pitter patter lets get at ‘er.

No one was biting in trade so i put it once in world and got banned within minutes

Healers: If you're healing locks you're doing it wrong.
---
Locks: If you're pulling aggro, you're doing it wrong.
---
Good thing you don't have to do any of that!  Spooker is level 8 and already at 75 enchanting.  You can just buy a wand from him!
---
Spooker Brand wands, we take the time so you don't have to grind!
---
Yea your right man I’m beating myself up about it.
---
It’s because they don’t understand a lock.
---
Like, I lifetap to get my mana. Then I spend it on dots and then lifesteal my life back.
---
It’s actually annoying sometimes when I get healed as I’m life siphoning. It makes me feel inefficient..... when someone heals me to full after my dot rotation.... I tent to life tap then lifesteal because then I can lifetap my health gain back and get my lifesteal mana back....
---
The 5am solo grind is beautiful with limited contention for mobs. Guessing this man has a young family— when you gotta wake up early while everyone’s asleep for your only shot at playing. *trips over x toy in the dark and wakes everyone up*
---
Depends on what you are after. If you are wanting to make gold roll skinning with mining, if you want to actually have fun roll engineering. Alchemy can be useful, but as a rogue level 60 cooking you can make green tea and that will be in the same CD as alchemy pots. That's just my opinion after leveling those professions. I'm currently using mining and skinning till I get my mounts then dropping mining and rolling engineering
---
If you don't understand how to use it, well that's a you thing.  Get good.  Or don't, I don't care.
---
Inclined to agree with you. It’s fairly easy for me to block players whispering me racist remarks in broken English, it’s a little harder to fight against something automated.
---
It's most likely because they are playing on a different language client. I play on the TW server with an English client and I literally guess names of shit ALL DAY and it works exactly half the time.
---
Why can't people just retitle these as "I am unemployed and a virgin." It gets to the point quicker.
---
From what I hear they make mad money by aoe farming.
---
Oh absolutely. I started trying to get it in my 30’s when 25g was just not happening. I’m 50 now and was about to try for it again when I checked the AH first to see if it would be better to just go grind some pirates or something... massive no brainer seeing it at 3 gold, that’s like 20 minutes of pirates.
---
Anytime anyone rolls a 69 I type "69 &gt; 100" and if I win that roll I honor my word and give them the loot.
---
Fact: Nobody fucking cares about your dungeon comp
---
Well its one thing to artificially recreate spell batching, its another to completely redo their CS systems
---
How do you check time played
---
Ok
---
I'm not sure on specifics. Basically if the mobs are grey for you, he gets less exp. The bigger the gap, the less exp he gets. With you at 44, and him at 8, your best option would be to start an alt that you play only with him; level up together.
---
I can't see him getting close enough for you to be able to play properly together until you are both at 60.
---
Yes, the stats are nice, but they arent specifically tied to the content you can do because your abilities dont scale off of weapon damage.
---
Love the screenshot
---
Just abandon the quest and then pick it back up from the troll again ^_^

I literally said “demo shout spam” did nothing not demo shout itself which is what someone misinterpreted if you carefully read my original post. 
---
Also I now can see my thought was incorrect. Thanks for clarifying how this works for me. I now know demo shout spam does have a use.
---
Basic rotation at lvl 40 with dark pact looks like this:
---
Turn lash of pain off auto cast, you’ll want the mana on pet for dark pact
---
Send pet attack - Queue up a Lash of Pain (helps succ have initial aggro for first few dot ticks - CoA - Siphon Life - Corruption - 1 Life Tap - Drain Life 2 to 3 times until mob dead - Dark Pact back to full mana while engaging next mob. You can be Dark Pacting while sending pet to attack the next mob which starts the sequence over again.
---
At level 38, prior to getting Dark Pact, just keep Lash on auto cast and use dots - life tap - drain life once - wand. You wanna turn it off at 40 though and only use it once for aggro so that your pet has mana to Dark Pact after the kill. You will never eat or drink again unless you pull multiple mobs.
---
I'm a druid. I want to be dps. Every dungeon group gets sick of waiting and makes me tank. I feel bad for sucking but they ask for it.
---
i just prefer the short form. I’m not talking strictly on number of characters.
---
Sorry, felt the urge to clarify my little knowledge on several classes
---
In his defense, sometimes that amount of time simply isn't enough to generate enough rage for a sunder. Unless if you have Bloodrage available sometimes (and you dont have tactical mastery to stance dance charge in) then generating rage on pull is going to require a few swings. Plus given the fact Taunt can miss, be resisted, etc It boils down to being patient with the tank.
---
Which faction?
---
That's fine, if you create the group you can choose whoever you want.
---
Everyone has certain preferences for instances and groups, knowing what works and wanting a group that fits well so that the run is as smooth as possible is a smart move.
---
You'll just find that gathering a group of 5 can be a bit tougher.
---
As someone walks across the grave, and you'd wish the sun would shine
---
Howd you spend 7 hours in duskwood? I mean it makes sense if you grinded mobs between missions but you definitely would of got a ton of gold from doing that off vendor junk and rewards.
---
&gt;It's a really simple system, you don't have to complicate it.
---
If by simple, you mean it is an easily exploitable system where you will get ninja'd literally every time anything of any value drops, sure.
---
I've been tanking successfully as a paladin with 11/5/0 (holy/prot/ret) as my spec currently. No issues, haven't even had a single death in any of my runs. Spec doesn't matter until at least 40, and even then the difference is negligible.
---
Thanks 🙂 It's a combination of different addons and kinda "work in progress". So to answer your question I need to know what you're looking at.
---
Time efficiency but not earning potential. If u sell when full you make the same amount as you would with full runecloth bags.. Just less efficiently.
---
That would be due to the neckbeard owning the channel as it is technically a private channel and not a Blizzard moderated one.
---
The Undead also just have Varimathras just chilling in Undercity with them. I think it’s hilarious seeing him there just casually handing out quests for you.
---
as long as we remove spell leeway along with it I'm all for it. It's completely unnecessary mechanic that only serves to confuse players
---
Good thing I'm using it then and not you.
---
Exactly father of a 2yr old and 10wk old
---
there's a sagefish recipe that gives hp and mana and also mp5
---
Haha well its the same as offspec for me, like if a Priest who is in the group as healer rolls on shadow dmg gear when i as warlock is in the group as dps and actually need the item, then im gonna roll on healing gear..
---
So it seems people are mad he took items and gold, whatever 🤷🏼‍♂️ if people wanna be “upset” that’s on them I honestly don’t care it dosent effect me or my server, and it seems like the classic case of “streamer man bad” seems like streamer privilege (which is inevitable )  really pisses people off lol
---
Die kartoffel habe eine Autobahn
---
Dude I hate warlocks at lower levels. Not only do they expect me to heal them when they life tap but then they bring no water. I’d rather bring a mage.
---
I never heard of spell leeway, but if it's like melee leeway, then yeah.
---
imagine thinking the more upvotes you have the more effort your post has
---
Look at the sig like folks. Don’t feed the trolls. 
---
Only the Orcs. Seriously. My greenboi needs money.
---
Greater Sage fish and sage fish delight are the only I know cuz lvl 39 twink bracket bis well fed buff
---
Yea definitely needs to go in the Raid addons only category
---
Warning people of toxic situations isn’t being childish, if you saw people walking on a path and you knew there was a poisonous snake you wouldn’t earn them?
---
Holy hell, tell me I don’t feel your pain. 2 year old and 1 month old here LOL.
---
It's like melee leeway.. but for spells duh :D makes thingsl ike CoC and nova larger when both targets are moving.
---
Alliance druids are assholes
---
Swamp of Sorrow would be grey at level 46, the area is for level 35.
---
Badlands is on the green to grey area as well, but most places the mobs are at least over level 40.
---
Tanaris and Feralas should be great. Besides that, grab all the quests for Maraudin and Zul‘Farak and run these, that should easily get you to level 50 for the next batch of zones (Felwood, Burning steppes, Un‘Goro, Western Plaguelands, Azshara, Blasted Lands)
---
I experienced the same issue and tried all of the same fixes you talked about. In the end I discovered that my mouse was occasionally double clicking (apparently a common fault in many mice, something to do with the switches) and that was causing the problem. Got a new mouse and the problem disappeared.

I got my Razer Chroma Ornata off eBay for mad cheap!

---
Does anyone have info on a macro that works?
---
&gt; You get to do what you prefer
---
I spec shadow because I have odd hours that I can't always be in a group with friends and on a PvP server that means you need to be able to defend yourself...I will roll holy at Max level when I don't have to worry so much about being ganked solo.
---
I hope that one day i will be that level 60 carrying a level 30 warrior to his whirlwind axe, i bought liferoot and all the charms for 7 gold from the AH ( i had 30 gold at level 30 ) and then farmed the tusks for 2 - 3 hours in STV. I then went to UC and asked in trade chat, and only 2 minutes in a level 60 warrior answered my call.
---
He did not talk much and for whatever reason he did not take the flight path to Tarren Mill. That badass swam through the lake, rode through alterac and, as we were at the troll,  proceded to help me kill the alliance warrior i have been fighting with while farming tusks ( that human finsihed the quest in the same time as it seems ) and then simply rode off again after killing the elemental. 
---
I hope that in the future, i will be able to heed the call of a fellow warrior in need and give him the weapon he deserves.
---
I didn't play in vanilla, so I'm not sure if this is an intended mechanic outside of the spell batching.
---
But as a mage that aoe grinds, it's infuriating that mobs sometimes runs all the way through my blizzard before getting hit and slowed.
---
&gt; I’m looking for advice on how to proceed because at this time all I can do is sit and wait.
---
I'd demand an explanation in a support ticket, along with compensation in the form of subscription days equal to the time chat banned if the reason really is some automated bs. Worst-case, you get no answer and no compensation.
---
Beyond that, if you also want to burn bridges and really go drastic, can request a charge-back from however you paid for subscription stating the automated reporting, but that'll likely end up with a full-on account ban. I have no particular loyalty to a guild or anything with WoW and would do this if it came down to it, but could easily see how that might not be ideal for most people.
---
Alternatively, sitting and waiting is the safest, lowest-effort choice.
---
How would it not be?
---
&gt;Doesn't take long with a mount to skill both
---
Yeah I had an epic mount in WoW Vanilla and swapped between herb/mining at least twice.
---
It's incredibly easy to raise it by that point, you literally walk through massive mob filled caves/mountains and pick/mine whatever you want. 
---
I don't know if you can do it in a day, but it's certainly fast enough that you won't regret dropping one.
---
It had to happen eventually. The endless war just wasn't making any sense anymore. If anything them doing this is, is making me look forward to trying whatever the next expansion is going to be.
---
Sounds like you want to place a Blizzard support ticket.
---
lol... Yes i have a 60 rogue.. i also have a 51 mage ? :/:/:/ 
---
Slow your roll its a subreddit not sm gy
---
Dude Wtf did I just watch.
---
Why is goblin better?
---
You really only posted this to start drama but I get it.
---
i know i am a piece of shit sorry to have bothered you
---
Good dungeon spam speed is perfectly viable for leveling.
---
The real problem is all the streamers did it for the entirety of their leveling process and all the veiwer-sheep thought they were doing it for *absolute speed* and not because the obvious 'if they walk outside they'll get perma-camped because they're all on PvP servers.'
---
You are seriously bitching about not getting more free stuff. So if I can only make 2 at time at should conjure like 30 times? Fucking choosing beggars.
---
Yep they sure aren’t. Weapon damage has zero impact on druids, it’s all in the stats. Not sure why I’m being corrected on something I didn’t say from others. I was simply saying that weapon upgrades can make as big of an impact as any other piece of gear.
---
SMOrc!
---
Heal is cheat!
---
BRD is annoying on retail because you cant tell which wing you are in when you use the dungeon finder because they all throw you in at the start.
---
and if you queue for a specific wing, people will just do prison and then complain about lack of credit for finishing.
---
You're not any richer than you would be with all 6 slotters. You just have to head back more often. Gold per level/xp should be the same.
---
I play an undead lock. My golden rule is that i do not initiate but will always finish. If you just leveling away or fishing or whatever. I will walk up, great you with a hello and be on my way.
---
Some of this stuff really upsets me.  They changed item stats to help a lot of classes, but others get left in the dust until later phases because items weren't introduced until later.
---
So, when. You get all the mats for Cyclonian, you turn them into the questgiver and pick up a new quest called The Summoning. If you abandon The Summoning, you can pick it back up and then it'll be like he never even failed
---
One of his best tbh. The ballad of the Alamo (not on the album) is my favorite song of his
---
Do you actually think people are jealous that you're doing low level carries for less gold per hour than you can make running at-level dungeons?
---
you can reset instance until jed is there with a targetting macro though iirc
---
Where do I go at 48, just did the blasted lands kill quest about 1/3 if the way through the level now
---
He’s most likely referring to Challe's Home For Little Tykes, where a female Troll NPC “cares” for living children and babies of all races. 
---
Ignore the cages filled with bones and rotting meat behind her hut, and remember not to scream too loudly, the babies are sleeping...
---
This. Was always a pain getting dungeon groups but one you can do sm/zf, the groups tend to stick around longer.
---
No I wouldn't earn them, yes I would warn them. But being called names is way different than a possible threat of death. Also he wasn't being a child he was being a dick. The guy's in his group were childish, and assholes by the sound of it.
---
Any update on when Phase 2 will happen?
---
If you have 0 int gear stay enhance for a bit. I fully switched at 40 into a full set of cloth/leather Intel/spirit gear and it's still a nightmare drinking every few pulls, but you can kill things by the time it gets to you generally.
---
It 100% works, but it takes a few minutes to catch him on the pat path.  They may have changed his starting position in the pat.
---
Make a /target Jed macro, walk to the top of the ramp and a tiny bit in, and wait around 3-4 minutes.
---
Is 200 a significant amount of Mana to literally anyone where you can mount up?
---
Absolutely not.
---
I`m actually amazed at how little you people must think before saying things like this
---
Did you boot his ass?
---
Good bot.
---
That rogue sucks if he can’t solo and elite his level. Like really sucks.
---
In the open world where you could drink for 2 ticks to get your Mana up to full before mounting? 
---
It's literally of no consequence whatsoever.
---
My take on it would be herbalism isn't really designed to make massive bank. Alchemy is the proffesion you use along side it to make the money. Sell your transmute, and sell stacks of pots. And don't be afraid to buy up some idiots who keeps undercutting you. Try and corner the market in one or two type of pots, and you'll make decent gold.
---
I’m appealing it. However it can just happen again. Also can happen to any guild officers recruiting. I started recruiting openly recruiting yesterday, took only a couple hours for me to get muted. So if anyone else in my guild recruits the probability of this happening to them too is high
---
YTA
---
Oops wrong sub.
---
But yeah, I would 100% of the time roll need on a recipe that char could learn.
---
BS doesn't generate rage
---
Words aren't poisonous you retarded fuck
---
You peasants dont auto renew? Probably have had xbox live since 2008 either.
---
Hugh, jealousy rages. Did you just use a normal screen cap for that or was there an addon you use?
---
Thanks mate! Snapped it on my way to Uldaman ;)
---
If I may ask, are you playing on Golemagg?
---
I second this statement
---
Lol how would you use it effectively on a rogue? I don’t get your comment to OP.
---
Thanks for your reply, I’m loving rediscovering the same sense of wonder I felt a decade a half a ago. The trepidation is just part of the experience and I’m anxious but gagging for finding a guild and hitting up the Stockades. :)
---
if you WW while fury tanking, you're doing it wrong
---
Whispers: DUNGEON!!
---
Did you report those people who whipered you? You can get them banned
---
&gt;Tauren last place
---
&gt;no Druid ganks 
---
And no one was surprised.
---
There are a whole lot of hidden/unused places like this one, its a really cool part of pre-cata wow
---
I'd see about if Blizz would be looking into it as they do have records of who is abusing the report system and it could result in bans for those players.
---
&gt; still tank for dungeons with a sword and board
---
hell, tanking with a 2h is a better way until quite a bit into the game
---
That’s a horrifyingly accurate description.
---
&gt;You can't just roll need on everything (two specs) because you can use it.
---
Leveled to 60 in Vanilla and Classic as a mage. I've done about a dozen level 60~ instances in Classic (At least a hundred more in Vanilla). 
---
Constantly have shamans/paladins/druids rolling on +dmg cloth gear despite being ench/holy/feral etc. No one ever had an issue with this, nor have I seen anyone complain about it other than general saltiness. It is common for the paladin/druid/shaman to ask or to mention it's for a different spec, but I can honestly say I've never seen anyone shoot them down and say "No" because of it. 
---
If you are going to use an item (and no vendoring/selling for gold doesn't count as 'using' it), then you need it. I really think it's as simple as that.
---
Sure it sucked losing BiS cloth +damage boots to a prot paladin, but he was going to use it the same as I was so I can't really complain.
---
yeah, i want transmogs too, and dungeon finder
---
and dual spec
---
Tanks get aggro a lot easier when the braindead fucks are dead.
---
Oh yes, every time. My favorite one so far was “Your guild is English? Here’s English for you: F*** you”
---
Not the guy you replied to, but lock alt at 18 atm. Not really sure I'm speccing anywhere close to right. What would that spec look like?
---
shuffle a deck of cards in my asshole.... i just hit 19
---
what sound?
---
It's true that there are loads of bad tanks. Sometimes I'm one of them.
---
But there are a lot bad healers too. I get pw:s a second after engaging all the time. Or sometimes renew, which is not as bad, but still less than optimal for a LOS pull.
---
I explain to people that it is terrible efficiency, that it interferes with my threat generation, that it generates threat on *every* mob.
---
I often offer the following advice if the priest seems at all receptive to advice: line up your biggest heal that takes 3-4 seconds, if needed interrupt it and immediately start recasting, try to time it so it lands on the tank when he is at half health, immediately hit fade after the heal lands, then cast renew on the tank, then assess the state of the fight.
---
I’ve had no issues with questing, we even made different races and did all the barrens quests together, we got like a 10 bar xp difference because he was logging out at the inns. Tbh it sounds like it’s just not your thing which is fine, hope you find something fun!
---
of course :D
---
Eastern Badlands
---
Probably the point if the post.

Feral isn’t the bottom 2 worst dps.

---
Sus here, checking into your wholesome reddit post. Didn't anticipate seeing this in the classicwow subreddit!
---
Keep the spirit alive any way you can, see ya at 60 someday!
---
Great now fix vanish.
---
Lol that’s awesome man!
---
I really want them to add the Make a Wish Tauren NPC. Mulgore feels somehow lesser without him. 
---
"Have you seen my dog" :(
---
Gotta remember all the people that rushed to 60 have basically nothing to do. There aren't that many of them despite what people think, good groups and raids are hard to get in to and most of them aren't just stomping through MC etc.
---
For most people they rushed to the end and have very little to do now that they're there. It'll get better in a few months.
---
This upsets me as a hunter. Lol
---
Of course he sleeps all day! That's what you do!  
---
The issue is that he also sleeps all night, when the rest of us are working.
---
until the pet dies and you can haul ass with 5 other mobs on you to the healer so you can taunt it off him, yeah, no, thanks
---
eh its cloth repairs.
---
Stitches and Duskwood used to be terrifying to me.
---
Get into the habit of not even shielding the tank at all. It's less mana efficient than your normal heals so should only be used in an emergency when you don't have the time to cast something
---
look what happens if you buff him int
---
Think about it. That guy must be behind that service and promoting it himself here. Also who doesn't use adblocker these days? I use it on my desktop and mobile. All in all seems way too suspect. Allready reported since account sharing isn't allowed and it's an ad for it.
---
Druid tanked most of it 😅
---
This was the norm in Vanilla.  And yeah in order for the Rogue to have non Rogues not roll on gear he paid him.  Therefore my previous statement (the Rogue had to pay a druid to not roll on his class set) is perfectly accurate.  The terms of him getting his own class' set item was to pay gold.  That's messed up and greedy of the druid.
---
Ok i should of mentioned in the post, i have gone through all the obvious ways to fix this and nothing has helped. Ive bugged a pre quest for succubus somehow
---
&gt; Leatrix Plus
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/leatrix-plus-classic
---
\+13 melee AP +1 crit +80 hp vs. +26 AP +80 hp +1 crit for a warrior/paladin/shaman.  
---
If that hunter got, for instance, the level 40 green "Ancient Crown of the Monkey" he would get +24 ranged attack +12 melee AP, +120 hp, and about .25% of a crit -  
---
I would think that would be obvious to hunters, but times never change.
---
 Cheers mate, greatly appreciated!
---
1- 5 or 6
---
2- 8
---
3- LW/Skinning would be the best for someone new
---
Get a job and youll find on your free time your never bored, because you aint get free time fuck you i wanna be uneployed i hate this adulting bullshit
---
Would be cool to have a shit list add-on that you could log names in and receive notifications when that player is in your zone
---
They're actually a ton of fun to play, you're just asking the wrong group of respondents.
---
Yeah, it's totally unacceptable when someone needs and wins an upgrade for them when I wanted that item.
---
What's the best money-making class?
---
What should my rotation be as a 24 warrior, when I just want to grind and kill quest mobs. I'm going Arms 2h.
---
Charge in, battle shout (if not up), rend, sunder armor (2-3 times) and the auto attack?
---
But that doesn't really matter... no money is being generated, only transferred, so there really isn't any way to "break" a bounty system. If one person is willing to pay their gold to another for a confirmed kill, then that's their prerogative. Who cares how you do it?
---
Most likely it wouldn't be largely popular or generally profitable because of how little death means in WoW. At best you are paying money to interrupt someone's ganking for 5 minutes.
---
Im going to grind dungs like i have been since ive had to quest in contested zones
---
Haha so salty kid.
---
Would not mind this tbh!
---
I’d say go solo till 60. Few dungeons here and there don’t hurt but it’s just inconsistent and your stuck in a healing spec. It’s nice starting the big boy dungeons and not being the crutch and actually pulling your weight and more.
---
I’d have him grab first aid too. Rogues are pretty good levelers as long as you don’t bite off more than you can chew. But if you do you can always vanish out. I also read combat is one of the best leveling specs. The damage output is usually so high you won’t get drained just taking down one mob, and I heard they are decent at fighting mobs a little higher level than they are due to damage.
---
^ as one of the “15 year keep classic classic” people, there is a difference between changing the game and fixing/removing things/adding small things that make sense given the fact it’s 2019, not 2005, improve the experience without changing it.
---
Examples already in game would be exiting flight path at next stop (don’t remember when this was added to retail, but misclicking your destination used to really suck and I’d assume it was only like this because it was A. Overlooked or B. Technical limitations. Raid Style party frames is another big example, the OG character portraits locked to left hand side weren’t great and everyone had to download an addon to see raid groups. It makes sense to add them to classic.
---
In 2005 most of us had latency issues while pulling 20 FPS because no one owned a “gaming computer” outside the most devoted PC gamers.  So it would make sense to remove a feature added purely to compensate for this (both spell and melee if they did do it, as a rogue I wouldn’t mind keeping it haha)
---
False. “legitimately hacking” is harder than its ever been, unless your target is hilariously undefended. You pretty much need inside information, and a fancy linux dostro is not going to be your silver bullet
---
That's where I leveled for a while. I'm on herod and its really hard to find mobs to kill. Basically  want random non quest mobs.
---
&gt;If one person is willing to pay their gold to another for a confirmed kill, then that's their prerogative. Who cares how you do it?
---
Because it's would become prominent and people will stop using it resulting in a dead system that the devs spent time on. 
---
Why would you place a bounty on someone knowing that they'll get together with someone to split your bounty and you'll be paying the nerd you hate?
---
OOF
---
i am hyped mainly in the health of my server thunderfury
---
Have you actually checked each NPC? The quest is level 20 so it will no longer show up for you over their head.
---
Gan'rul Bloodeye should have the quest "Devourer of Souls", but if he does not then you abandoned the quest in the middle of the chain somewhere.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=1507/devourer-of-souls
---
[The heat map problem.](https://xkcd.com/1138/)
---
Because you can put coa+corruption on 1 target that the voidwalker is focusing, while he's tanking a second mob(for when pulls get hairy) while you fear+dot 1 mob and dot+wand another mob.
---
I really really wanted to make the drain lock work, but as a level 30 Warlock I gotta say having the voidwalker do all the above, plus being able to sac him has given me better results than constantly having my healthbar dip to half with imp or succubus and having stressful pulls anytime more than 1 mob gets involved.
---
  
---
There's so many questing locations that have camps of enemies, enemies in a cave, or enemies in a fort, that I found just keeping the voidwalker out worked best for me. Also I don't think I kill slow, I am almost never out of combat because I mouse over and petattack the next mob when my VW main enemy is at half.
---
Though I will be trying the drain spec again when I get drain life rank 5, by then I should have more spell power to really leverage the heals
---
Lol, same... even if you like your job, it still gets so monotonous.
---
People just love blues and cant go without me personally i go for whats best in stats but im also not a noob
---
Interest yerr in a pint?
---
Mine does that with the left click. Not a big enough deal to make me replace it, but I like to swing the camera around to make sure I know what's happening around me and i randomly untarget.
---
Just walk to ubrs door, target, reset. His pat always starts at the same spot and in pservers it was closer to entrance. In classic you have to walk up
---
Wailing Caverns was fun ONCE. Once I realized how long it'd take to make a deviate scale belt I noped on reruns.
---
My weekend have been 16hour seshs i just wanna play wow haha
---
Ima nice warlock, I ask.
---
Luckily I haven't had that issue but when I group with folks in dungeons it is usually guildies, friends, or folks I was questing with prior in zones.  Pugging in general usually seems like aids.
---
Are you really assuming people only play one toon?
---
Thanks for such a detailed response. I was considering getting a normal old one, and then potentially fiddling - but don't want to mess anything up and then have a computer to try and fix! Aha
---
But yeah, I imagine the old office computers can run it well enough for me to get my fix and escape in to it every now and then! I'm also looking on Amazon, and it seems they have a 'renewed' section of sales, which is basically just refurbished computers. There's a pretty decent on on there for like £180 which isn't far off what I'd be looking at, and it seems to run games fine enough! As long as I can download the clients, and at least have Classic, and attempt BfA. I'd be happy! aha
---
Great video, even better then Blue dress (?) Which is also good :D
---
I thought only white people are racist lol
---
Mage or hunter.
---
Bounces back to the original sender.
---
Well he wouldn't want to make a ruckus and wake up anyone sleeping.
---
I wish I could upvote this 1000000x
---
Shadowmeld in classic does make stealth class' stealth stronger aka NE rogues and druids have slightly better stealth than other rogues or Tauren druids. It is also an out of combat stealth ability any NE can use. A strange racial.
---
As a healer I don't mind life tapping locks just eat some fucken food if I am drinking all you are doing is wasteing everyones time if I need to heal to full before the pull
---
Mine have been around 10hrs during the weekend.  The addiction has really set in for me.
---
Oh
---
Faction swap wasn't in classic so it won't happen!
---
Me not that kind of Orc.
---
It isn’t BoE. There’s literally a picture of it showing it’s equip/ stats
---
Shied every other pull as its usually most expensive spell. Make sure  to casr shield after casting mindblast as you regen while casting and the 5second rule starts only afterer you finish a casr. Then throw shadow word pain and mind flay one or twice. Then wand.
---
And then the priest and warrior clapped
---
*Laughs in warlock*
---
100% hahaha
---
I've heard of this happening to a few ppl, try submitting a bug report
---
..dino..droppings, droppings..?
---
Was totally just scrolling and thought it was some reimagined oblivion portal for a second. Great work though.
---
thats not his name tho
---
Those healers just need to stop healing us when they are going to drink.  It just delays everything.  Especially when I tap to 1:1 mana/hp, so that I can drink and eat and recover twice as fast.
---
Like, just stop healing me if I'm going to sit and eat anyway.
---
And also people forget how we as warlocks have to purchase grimoires as well as spells, which is partly why we get a free mount.
---
Had a Paladin Need on Defias Armor. I won though. Weirdly haven't met these infamous hunters except a skin stealer in the open world.
---
Stoneform is 3 min CD and escape artist is 1 min. It's still a hard decision though lol.
---
Yikes....
---
Damn, time to start doing this on a wipe.
---
It's a NE thing
---
That's what i'm saying, I don't think it would be used very often because of futility and uncertainty of it. Personally, what I would spend to have someone killed is probably not an amount that a bounty hunter would consider worth the time. 
---
A system for it would be simple though, a board that creates quests where you input the name of the target, deposit the amount of money and someone can take the quest. The computer tracks a kill of the specific target and notifies the contractor that the deed is done.
---
That warlock is an idiot.
---
I get hunter, but why mage?
---
True, always best to tell your tank you disagree with the markings though. It's easier on the healer and the group overall to all have the same plan. Yeah some tanks will think they are 200IQ, impeccable, and disagree with you. I always tell my group if I'm tanking and not too familiar with the mobs in the dungeon, but I've been on the other side of it and I know tank ego is a real problem sometimes
---
Hunter specific question here.  Everyone says use a slow bow / gun. This is said so you clip your Aim-shot less and it hit harder. What if your not going marks build at all. No aim-shot, Are you better with a fast bow so you can proc Aspect of hawk and take greater advantage of your ranged AP?
---
Out and about right now, will do asap. You have to enable out of date addons and manually turn it on. It functions great
---
Imagine all the plebs nowadays who never watched Pure Pwnage.
---
I try, but then healers heal me anyway.  Same deal when I bandage.
---
As Tauren I do a lot of waving, so not too surprised by these results.
---
Oh awesome. Thanks
---
yeah they are.
---
I generally wait to see if someone rolls need without asking, then ill roll need too to try to stop them
---
Or Turk. It’s “panter” in Turkish. Might explain that English.
---
I have four.  Play them all.
---
That's what sucks, they dont wanna help. That's the issue
---
Got it. I'll try to level a Priest with him so it might make things easier on the "5 or 6" score.
---
And by 8 on dungeon... any idea what level he will start to do some damage on dungeons?
---
Mostly questing in various 48+ zones
---
I mean, that's just video games. You're gonna have to play everything to see what fits best for you. Mages are OP for certain things, but most classes have their fun things. If you don't enjoy long corpse runs from experimental soloing 😆 then you probably won't get bored of Mage.
---
Questing as Alliance on a PvP server was the first mistake. Theyre radically outnumbered
---
Please make the game a better place and report this as a bug
---
Im at 16
---
Do some devilsaurs
---
I wish I could. I tried to make a Korean account to buy a mount that I had and lost (annual pass thing). No luck. I could pay a lot less for melon if I had a Korean Id lol. 
---
I’m married to a Korean but he’s there and I’m in the states. Loooong story.
---
Yeah I tell them to either not heal me until I'm near 0 or that I'll life tap and do a nibble like when I'm solo questing. Or I'll just life drain in battle until I'm comfy
---
Any proof of that? The wowhead faction ratio still has it showing damn near exactly 50:50 alliance/horde
---
So posting this here so you can see what keybinds I have set up: https://i.imgur.com/d9gUY8d.jpg
---
1-5, ZCVBRTY in bottom bar, Alt 1-5, Shift 1-5, F1-5, QEFGX, Shift E/Q, Alt E/Q and of course `
---
I have smaller hands so reaching for 6-0 is difficult, and I use mouse to look left/right. I have AD as strafe left/right, and S to move backwards (I'm a tank, need to be able to walk straight backwards on fights like ony without exposing my back)
---
Hopefully it gives you some ideas!
---
Were realm transfers a thing in classic?
---
I rolled on a US realm and I have better ping on the oceanic servers (since i live in aus, kind of a no-brainer but in retail oceanic servers sucked for me - like a decade ago).
---
I have chars on oceanic servers but my main is on a us one. My ping is around 210ms so i've been told that that's ok, but my ping on the oceanic servers is around 10ms.
---
&gt; This was the norm in Vanilla
---
Seems to be the norm in Classic from what I've experienced. Granted it's only been about a dozen Scholo/Strat/BRS runs, but it's been pretty consistently agreed that this behavior is acceptable. 
---
&gt; And yeah in order for the Rogue to have non Rogues not roll on gear he paid him.
---
The druid was planning on "Need"ing the item like the rogue did, but the Rogue was objecting quite a bit because he came to the instance for that item and really wanting it, despite knowing the druid would roll on it, as it was an obvious upgrade for the druid too. The druid did want the item, but he likely didn't want the Rogue to be too upset since the Rogue had specifically gone to the instance for that while the Druid just had it drop and noticed it was an improvement. 
---
I've had similar experiences with the same class, I had another mage pay me not to roll on Magister's boots (not knowing they dropped off a certain boss) so I don't think it's an inter-class specific issue. It's just that when someone wants something really badly, they're willing to pay for it. At the time I didn't need the Magister's boots that much (only a few +upgrades), while the other mage wanted to get a 6/8 piece set bonus and was willing to pay so I didn't roll.
---
In the end I decided to take some gold not to roll on it, but that doesn't mean I didn't have a right to roll need on it when I had planned to use it. The other mage didn't need to pay me to obtain the item, but he wanted to in order to ensure he got it. 
---
&gt;Therefore my previous statement (the Rogue had to pay a druid to not roll on his class set) is perfectly accurate. 
---
In this scenario he didn't *have* to pay him as you imply. He simply took the payment option because it was guaranteed (he would have still had to roll), and he saw how much more it meant to the Rogue. 
---
At this point I go to dungeons for certain items, if something dropped that I really wanted, someone *could* potentially pay me not to roll, but that doesn't mean they *have* to pay that. It could also have happened the other way around, the druid could have paid the Rogue not to roll on his own set items. 
---
&gt;The terms of him getting his own class' set item was to pay gold. That's messed up and greedy of the druid.
---
The terms of him getting a piece of armor was the same as anyone else that could use it, he just didn't want to *risk* a roll.
---
Regardless it seems you're missing the point of the argument, the Rogue had expected the Druid to roll on it and considered it valid. The reason the Rogue paid the druid is because the Rogue didn't want to take the risk of potentially losing it, and people have done this before without the aforementioned Druid/Rogue scenario taking place.
---
Is it in game? Wowhead said it was added in 1.13?
---
If a recipe for your profession drops and you don't know it, you roll need. It's that simple. They were right.
---
Art of War is a great book. Shame you didn’t quote it and instead just said “something something”. Maybe I’m just a huge book nerd though. 
---
Informative post though. Hopefully people understand the struggles of the prot Warrior.
---
Nah did that in vanilla
---
Cannibalize
---
No :c
---
Like I said, it's either to make money, or use with leather working. To level engineering, you'd have to buy bars, which are more generally more expensive than skins. I'd suggest mining/engineering and being self sufficient.
---
I’d love a succumbs but as alliance it’s almost impossible to get a group for shadow fang sadly
---
Log it or fuck off with your nonsense, I dont know how you stupidly see the data thrown right in your face showing 300-350dps literally being world record shaman dps on most MC boss fights and think "ill prove I do that".
---
You are hilarious.
---
as a warlock who continues to remind mages that food is more useful to us than water, thank you ❤️
---
Raging berserkers helm is pretty amazing for hunters even though they get 0 rap from it. 1% crit is huge. People need to get over it.
---
Every Nordic I have encountered is this dumb.
---
Sincerely, someone the Nordics keep mistaking for a Dane. The nerve.
---
Lol. Proves my point.
---
Fox is my theme, except for my rogue. CottonEyeJoe... Where did he come from, where did he go?
---
You should have kited stitches away and saved the gnome. No honor
---
Both of these replies put together was my exact thought process
---
Lmao this is too good
---
Eh. Knock him if you want, but keeping your raid composed when shit goes sideways is a good thing.
---
Rogue is a pretty good starter class, very simple/organic playstyle when combat spec’d, they’re also everywhere and don’t bring *a whole lot* of utility to a group compared to other classes, I would never say they’re “essential”... but they’re solid DPS (especially single target boss DPS), and they do offer sap, lock boxes and can generally control their aggro well. 
---
I main a mage, he brings food/water/buffs/crowd control/AoE... and you’re 30-40 yards from melee range so healers barely need to heal me... rogues take and deal quite a bit of damage.  I alt a rogue, he’s a lot of fun but not as “relaxing” to play in groups, lot of sinister strike spam and watching cool downs as compared to mage. 
---
They do level pretty easily, but you’ll need to buy or source food... luckily you only have to worry about the health bar.
---
Yes you can but Jed patrols around the area, which takes some time to target him. It's much faster too get up there and use the target macro.
---
No this is Patrick!
---
I've heard a mixed bag regarding joana.
---
I personally use Questie along with classic wow live - if you have 2 monitors, it's a cinch. Although, I've only started using classic wow live on an alt and it's only lv. 7 so idk if it's actually good yet.
---
Questie is awesome though.
---
Am I missing a joke or something?
---
IT IS I  BLUTOSMASH AND I WOULD SMASH THE STUFFIN OUT YOU FO THIS REF
---
Ughhhhh I hate being healed when I'm healing myself. Why do they waste their mana on me
---
"If I need HP, I'll take it from the boss"
---
You can make your own sapper charges and refill bomb trinket
---
Thanks!
---
Amen, brother. Been saying this since launch day.
---
You also forgot "don't shield the tank" and "make sure no one is OOM before rushing to the next fight" and "hunters turn off Growl" and "hunter dismiss your pet before jumping" and "probably dont fear that inside the instance"
---
-	This has been in the game for 15 years.
---
-	There’s way better shit in Retail **right now.**
---
I’m not saying this because Classic Bad Retail Good or anything like that, I’m saying it because this is a shitpost.
---
Damn I had my mount and got all my priority skills leveled up
---
Shoulders in general just look better on Orcs as well. My troll is wearing the big bad Paul drone right now and they don’t look nearly as big or bad as when an orc is wearing them
---
I'm at least partially convinced that some some subset of the #NoChanges crowd would like Blizzard to mandate that all players must play the game the same way they remember from 15 years ago.
---
It's good, but not amazing.  A level 40 green helm is arguable as good, if not better.  Whereas if you compare the RBH to plate gear, you don't find as many good comparisons.
---
That being said, I would 100% expect a hunter to roll on all the mail from Herod.
---
You did a great job of being uselessly negative thanks
---
I mean a hunter can make use of it so
---
Old Blanchy represent!
---
Interesting, yeah was always frustrating when having to place AoE spells as my hand would never be on the mouse
---
Yea it's a cat wo it should be able to
---
I hate mining. It's more efficient to do mara runs than running after nodes anyway.
---
Hey just curious once you hit level 40 and get Mortal Strike should I still be using Sunder Armor in my rotation?
---
That post was made almost 2 weeks ago and does not self-update. Sadly, the API broke the census, but like 10 days ago this was the balance:
---
https://wowpop.appspot.com/realms/heartseeker
---
Since then more transfers opened and the population has skewed heavily to Alliance.
---
What do you suggest as respect at 60 for raid/PvP?
---
Very not impress
---
You sound like you know what your doing then. Crack on with it.
---
Plays on PVP server, doesn't PVP...
---
I’m actually afraid to tank because of people not knowing how tanking works in classic.
---
ZF gy cleave till 52
---
BRD questing/BiS hunting till 57
---
Tomorrow begins Strat BiS hunting cuz I finished BRD tonight.
---
Hit things a lot.
---
1. 2h with rockbiter 
---
2. 1h and shield with WF.
---
A faster weapon uses more WF procs. And a 2 hander procs left while often overkilling a mob.
---
Every horde gets a epic wolfy, no need to rep grind for one.
---
I played a very strange arcane/fire build in early BC. I was a scorch spammer. In raids that’s all I did pretty much. No other mage had to worry about applying the scorch debuff and I got to just run around spamming. It was fun!! 
---
I love scorch. But I’m playing pure frost in classic and will through BWL. Fire immunity sucks.
---
Alternative you can look into an MMO mouse with buttons by your thumb.
---
Searing whelps and Earth elementals in Badlands get mount in 2 days
---
Theres always 5 mages spamming portal services at Kargath
---
How is it so far on Herod? Might join you.
---
Fuck yes! #makeclassicawarzone 
---
I'm horde, but Alliance on Skullflame literally never attacks without provocation. I've charged into a group of similar level alliance 1v3 and they scatter. I don't get it
---
as a mage i usually try to freeze just the mobs hitting the healer and then grab aggro if possible and kite the slowed mobs back to the tank
---
Even as a warrior? And what level are those mobs
---
What if we told you that Classic+ is The Burning Crusade?
---
They have to support a reason for why they are reporting you, and the language filters scan to see the language.
---
They will not detect anything for just speaking English so you have nothing to worry about.
---
It's a problem that solves itself
---
Seems like druids would only help this situation...
---
Oo okay thanks for the heads up!
---
The undead laugh was perfect for this as well. 10/10
---
Linen loses money, wool breaks even, but Silk and beyond vendors for more as bandages than raw cloth.
---
Well all my knowledge is from reading and looking at videos. This is something I'm not sure about that's why I'm asking others what they think. 
---
Imo another gathering profession won't be for me.
---
That's what i'm planning to do after 60
---
Ah yes, if I play on a PVP server, I must constantly PVP the other faction. Doesn't matter if I'm trying to level up or quest, I must attack them if I see them. It's not like they are going to bring back up to camp my body for the next 30 min.
---
I've had nothing but positive and fun experiences for the most part (I really try to create a friendly vibe when grouping with peeps) which is why this was so wild to me.... Like.... The rogue died only once (and was the only one who died the entire run) cuz the tank couldn't hold aggro but they frickin let me have it like I was some sort of murderer lol
---
He aint wrong though.
---
You even censor your own name on the picture and are quite happy to name and shame.
---
Disgusting.
---
Damn I posted a semi hidden area and didn't get nearly the upvotes. This must've been way more hidden!
---
I'm 52 and already finished Felwood, Ungoro only has like 3 quests for me, same for Azshara and Searing Gorge quests are all lvl 48-49, i'm about to go to Winterspring even though all the mobs are 56-57, is there a better option out there? Also, can i run BRD at this level or would it be too hard?
---
I wish there was a resource somewhere for reflect damage gear.
---
Id rather be in a good group thanks for offer tho
---
It's only useful for paladins to grind with, warriors get better. I bought mine for 200g a few days ago, was going for 450 a few days before that
---
They. Have. Hogger.
---
Blood rage overpower, intimidation shout and walk behind them to land pretty much gauranteed hit, overpowet again. EZ
---
SM arm solo? If so, any class requirements?
---
Thanks, loved Outfitter back in the day
---
Google “classic warrior hamstring method”
---
Basically, charge in, auto attack, hamstring, strafe run away, auto attack, rend, etc rinse repeat.
---
Allows you to trade hits 1 for 1 with mobs. There should be informative videos out there if you google it, hope this helps!
---
this brought on rumors of player housing
---
As a paladin, toss light on the warlock its fast to throw them 1 heal to refill the health bar than to have them drink.
---
As a healer, I just say I'm channeling my healing into damage.
---
If you want to play classic, switch the classic in the dropdown menu above "Launch game".
---
Classic is only around 5gb
---
Do that shit on a PvP server and you will get booted by some raid guilds.  Nothing more infuriating than trying to discreetly summon your raid, knowing that some other guild out there has been beefing with you, and the locks have some dumbass macro informing everyone in /say range that they are summoning someone...
---
just brd and lbrs till 60
---
you want a bunch of rare shit from brd whatever you are playing at 60
---
Classic.
---
Realm transfers were a thing in late Vanilla, Blizzard has said that they'll make realm transfers available but they dont know when.
---
Bit rough for hiting stuff, but searching gorge isn't terrible, there's a good amount of quests there mainly chains.
---
khadgar, anduin lothar and jaina proudmoore have joined the chat
---
I think he may be onto something. Only someone with a tiny dick would blot out their own name and not the other guys.
---
idk about that, I haven't checked but apparently this question was asked about 5 days ago and someone replied saying that they could only transfer 1 character.
---
Short answer? 
---
No, and no.
---
I haven't played since Cata but really want to play! Can someone help me with a decent rig or 2 that could play Classic? 
---
Ideally, I would get 2 computers so my GF who had never played, can play with me! Thank you!
---
I haven't checked/verified but apparently this question was asked about 5 days ago and someone replied saying that they could only transfer 1 character.
---
I PVP because I like PVPing.  If my primary goal was to quest I'd be on a PVE server.  It's very uncommon for me to not fight someone when I see them.  But you're not me, so you do you.
---
I've always wondered this, too!
---
The Oceanic servers back in the day were hosted in the US and just labeled as Oceanic so all the Aussies would be on the same servers to play together which is why they used to suck back then but I'm pretty sure they are hosted in Australia nowadays and have been for a couple of years now.  
---
As for paid server transfers I've not heard Blizzard say anything about this and I suspect they will never make this an option because its part of the "classic experience".  
---
Server Community is a huge part of what makes classic great and because everyone is stuck with one another we all eventually start to recognize one another and we build reputations as good/bad players in our community, they don't want us to be able to act like total asshats then transfer to a new server once we build a bad reputation.
---
Undead start at Neutral with all other Horde factions. Tauren, Orcs, and Trolls all start Friendly to one another. Plus he probably got a ton of Orgrimmar rep from questing in the Barrens, Ashenvale, etc.
---
Blame all the bad locks for this.
---
Sure, if they suck. You can purge/dispel the void walker sacrifice shield and you can purge/dispel soul link off of the pet. After that you’re a lock with a useless pet that does less DPS than other specs.
---
big oof thanks for sharing this
---
Best bet would be affliction spec and the felhound for the pet, best pvp setup imo
---
I agree, I play priest and I don’t really mind when warlocks sacrifice their health for mana. I like to think of it as 1 of my heals worth of my mana = all of their mana back
---
Go for something you can use then. Leather working.
---
Wait is that what happened to the census site?
---
Red is dead
---
You’ll be competitive immediately as long as your weapons are up to date.
---
Dwarf. If you spec pvp with imp sprint and with the improved vanish CD, prep. You have plenty of snare and slow breaks.
---
I will, when I reopen the shop.  I'm currently leveling to 10 and building up stock.
---
😂
---
Dude must've been in your group earlier, they appear to feel personally attacked.
---
Western Plaguelands perhaps?
---
Imp imp 3/3 is actually the best
---
Nice.. one tip though stay way behind the group for those mobs that silence. Wailing Guardsmen I think? Especially in the Commanders room. If the group all just wades in there you're liable to be chain silenced until everyone wipes. Suggest to your tank he pull mobs and tank them just outside the room at the top of the steps.
---
Yeah but don't you face constant pressure to respec to healer?
---
Searing gorge and burning steppes are both 50 zones for quests. And yeah you're find for the start of BRD. Mobs start at 50, a group of 52s who are good can do up to the bar no issue. Also there are lots of quests for it for good xp. Get the key, kill a singular 52 elite fire elemental, kill some dark iron dwarves, whatever.
---
Curious how the one mage could solo it - did they wait for you to have substantial threat and not pull off of you? Single mages AOE utility is a bit more limited in that they can’t really kite forever without taking some dings. Two mages who alternate on the root, however, is pretty unstoppable
---
I am jealous of how much gold you have.
---
I fail at having gold.
---
Wait that item is a "farm" item? I just ran to Desolace today because a fishing guide told me to go there and loot the traps until I got one. Assumed it just happened fairly easily.. it didn't list it as a grind or anything. I got it on my 3rd trap opening.
---
From experience, warriors and rogues have a lot of rotations on hand, depending on talent build.
---
Ofc sword rogues are more braindead than daggers, but even so it's better than icebolt ad infinitum.
---
Ok thanks
---
thanks for the heads up ill be sure to spread the word
---
Like one of those Orange County Chopper memes
---
Should I be jumping in and out of stances? I read somewhere that people prefer going into defense stance.
---
Depends what your switching for
---
They were used only to start new servers up (and reduce player numbers on some servers).
---
So if you're asking if you'll get the option to transfer from US realm to OCE one, nobody knows if blizz will come out with them later where you can choose your destination, but it seems unlikely at best.
---
Also coming into Westfall as alliance. Them thar harvesters being immune to fear -AND- drain life. Fun. ._.
---
https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/warrior-weapons-guide  
---
At the moment just go with what you have, once you hit level 30 see if you can find some guildies help you do your warrior quest to get the Whirlwind Axe, this will serve you extremely well for a very long time.
---
This is one of my favorite parts about always playing tanks and heals. All my vanilla characters were one or the other, and now I've recreated my warrior tank in classic. You dont' have to put up with anything. If the group acts like asses, you just move to another and they get to wait 30 minutes or more fighting every other group for a tank.
---
I'm leveling destroy and pvping as destro. It's sick
---
https://sixtyupgrades.com/
---
Try this, I believe they have options available for sub 60 players. Level 30 I believe warriors can get their whirlwind axe!
---
Compared to the server I am on this looks great!
---
Playing on Transcendence germany and well its great but I didnt saw that many people in IF since bc or wotlk.... maybe it gets better with layering gone.
---
That's a terrible idea.   Just FYI
---
Thanks for the replies. I was gonna do that but just wondering if there is a good alternative. Thanks again!
---
I did a few RFC runs and way outlevelled the quests I had. Should I abandon those quests, or do I need them to get future quests? I'm level 18 and the quests are for level 7-10s.
---
I’m still only level 11 but that sounds interesting.  Could you list the talents here so others can see them too?
---
I'd be happy if my mooncloth sold for 21 gold. :|
---
I love it, so much easier to stand out.  Tanks still love Mages for Poly, and healers still love them for the water.
---
But.... why?
---
Go to youtube and search for "Spooned by ORC". You are welcome.
---
Me and this gnome mage were having a good time leveling together.  And by that I mean, I was just following him around and skinning his mobs.  It was a hoot, we shared congenial emotes and bows.  Then 3 of my compatriots came rolling up and corpse camped him.  I told them, hey could you not, he was a good gnome.  They spit on me and said "Fuc u" which really brought me back to that Vanilla experience.
---
This.  Also I'm all about max dps, the quicker the boss dies the quicker I can stop healing.
---
If tossing the warlocks a rejuv/regrowth get us higher DPS then I'm about it.
---
All I ask is a macro with a pm or something to when there about to do it.  Much easier to plan out heals when I know dmg is coming.
---
"no consumables!"
---
- everyone too lazy to farm consumables
---
Ba dum tss
---
EPL + WPL are ready for you, some good quests and some really long ones to keep you busy.
---
Check out Blasted lands for a few quests, maybe even Searing Gorge. 
---
Good luck!
---
Ah sorry didn't see the bit about Japan. I'm sure they have a similar app if kijiji isn't a thing there. A decent grasp of pc knowledge helps here. And make sure you fire the machine up and test it... especially keyboard for laptops.. open up notepad and check every single key.
---
So, I'm not saying you need to change this, because people should play however they want. 
---
However, if you came to me asking what to improve, the number one thing I would say is that mouse turning is far, far, superior to keyboard turning, and is an absolute must for any sort of PvP. There are things you quite simply cannot do with keyboard turning (e.g. turning, jumping spells on a target behind you) that you can with mouse turning.
---
It isn't...but if you are pugging, you need to lay down the rules. Tell them that they need to wait...dps are a dime a dozen, if in a run they keep pulling mobs off of you (early on in the pull not when the mob is at less than 25% health), just leave.
---
Also, you should be in a guild and be doing guild runs. Sure, pug some dungeons, but being in a guild run will really let you know if it's you/your gear/your spec or the dps-ers.
---
As long as your guildees aren't dicks.
---
What is this? are you suggesting a change? how dare you.
---
Probably the only 60 in my group last night that threw a fit after we refused to wait 30 minutes so we could reset for a 6th time.
---
&gt; We're talking about roughly two years from now. If someone hasn't hit 60 in two years then they're not very committed to the game and that would mean they shouldn't have a say in the development path, right?
---
Maybe you didn't mean to imply it, but the way you have been talking about pre-60 players gives the impression you don't think that they should be included on the road map for new content.
---
I met a Chinese guy who called blizzard stormwind
---
lvl 40 Orc Warrior, what weapons should i be gunning for in the 40-50 range? I'd rather stay with 2h arms but can go fury too if it's the best move
---
Reading this thread makes me realize how incredibly lucky I was to get every drop I needed after 4 runs as s hunter. First run I got 3 items (including ring, was the only one to need) , even after greeding the agi leather boots as a 51 Rouge asked me in the beginning for that since it was the only item he needed.
---
lol auto attack botter to death. Report this guy
---
Thank you!!! I apparently had parental controls activated from many years back. I have my free transfer!
---
Don't doorstoppers usually Go on the other side of the door to keep it from hitting the wall and damaging it?
---
Damn. Nice!
---
No one said he was calling them out, it could have been as simple as him saying in general shout to lookout for them cause they treat healers poorly. I’ll leave you with some advice since you generally seem upset with what the op did, don’t be an asshole and 99.999999% of the time people won’t think you’re an asshole.
---
Thank you. Definitely doing this as a level 58.
---
This is my experience too
---
1.13 is Classic.
---
It really doesn’t matter if you quest, grind mobs or dungeon. Just do one/more of those things AKA playing the game. You won’t get much good from anything but you’ll get a bit from all of it.
---
If you get some greens to sell, that’s the biggest boost you’ll get. Your chance of getting a green is about the same from quest reward, mob drop or (5 man) dungeon group.
---
Dungeons are pretty good if you have a solid group and do a bunch of runs in quick succession, otherwise it might be shit if you’re just standing around LFG/M.
---
TLDR: do something that isn’t standing around wanting gold.
---
If you are doing a lot of mara runs might as well pick up mining or herbalism and get the nodes during your run
---
Por ques no los dos?
---
I have checked each npc. Thats very plausible i could of picked it up started it then abandoned. I might try follow the quest manually
---
I think there is already an add-on like that but it is something I'm trying to write as a fun side project.
---
Thank you so much. This is incredible, I was really regretting making a gnome just because of the mount sound.
---
Ayyy dude thanks a bunch! :D was a huge upgrade! Hopefully i can get you back at some point :P
---
Is it though? I really like leveling with succubus but maybe I should wrap back to imp for a bit. Dps is a little higher right?
---
Mages are he new huntards, change my mood nd.
---
Same here, Undead are the worst, then Orcs. I think I've only fought a single Troll with my current character, he was a hunter though.
---
oh for sure but how are players going to fix the balance issues? blizzard has to figure that out and i think their radio silence makes it clear that they are uninterested
---
my guild is staying on skeram as far as i know and i've made a lot of faction friends i wouldn't want to lose, but i definitely don't begrudge anyone leaving so that they can be the one camping the chain for once
---
I can't imagine being a dev and having to deal with the guilt of making gnomes a playable race.
---
I think he's saying it'd be most efficient to let him cannibalise tap and then get healed so his cannibalise isn't wasted
---
thats just gold though.
---
As a tank myself I have to agree. Either OP didn't advertise his group properly, or else he folds under pressure easily.
---
Hell yeah! My guild is on a slow start and were just leveling still, but grats man! GL on future raids!
---
You're weird, but also correct. Anybody who thinks vanilla was "buttery smooth" needs to peel back the rose-tinted glasses.
---
Warlock is just insane while leveling on a drain tank build. Your health and mana pools, your pet's mana pool and your healer's mana pool are all resources you can use to damage your enemies, heal yourself and replenish your mana. You can tap your hp into mana at a profit, you use your mana to kill while healing yourself, and your pet is pooling up resources for you while you're casting. You have to really push it with chain pulling and taking on multiple mobs to ever run out of gas.
---
I don’t pug as not the tank anymore for this reason.
---
If it’s quicker then I’d get it
---
Well, it was taken at the entrance of ashen vale, looking back into Darkshore
---
Wait what am I missing here?
---
bottom 4, sorry.
---
Ive had a tank get mad at me because my "bear was growling". He kept telling me to turn off growl even though i did at the very beginning of the dungeon. His reasoning was that he could hear my bear actually growling, so i must have it on.
---
I think about spellcleave specifically ( at least from my standpoint ) it just feels a bit unbalanced and unfair. I am playing a warrior and don´t missunderstand ; I love it. But seeing how mages are able to cc me for an eternity, how they are able to kill 6 quest mobs i need without breaking a sweat ( which also makes them great for leveling and gold grinding ) and having great mobility on utility is still frustating at times. 
---
Now i don´t hate mages, i took the warrior right ? I knew that i am going to die everytime i see a mage, but still it is simply human to be frustated, even if you acknowledge, that is 100% for fault. I think that for a lot of people spellcleave is simply the cherry on top of that frustation, people are already a bit fed up of how good mages are, and now those mages also start "discriminating" people based on their classes, so that "the already op class can be more even more op." 
---
Humans simply don´t like the feeling of being inferior and left out. And in the case of the mages this is the case. An extreme example : A Retribution Paladin is always going to feel worse then a mage, and he his inv request will mostly surely be ignored if contested by a mage. And maybe he knew that this will happen as he picked the class, but over the time frustation still stacks and he simply has to say it out loud. This then create a toxic environment. 
---
But can you blame the mages for optimizing their in game time ? Surely not. So is the paladin then to blame ? From his perspective he is also just playing the way he wishes, dare you go to him and tell him ; "But the class you picked is useless ! You knew this, you are fault ?" At the end of the day it is a problem deeply rooted within the class design of vanilla really, but you can´t change classic ofc.
---
I'm well versed in playing as prot, its just less effective while leveling and less fun for me.
---
&gt; For casters
---
Excluding paladins. Thanks, Blizz. :C
---
I don't like this place - VW.
---
They probably saw that you were high level and thought they could just do whatever they felt like, unfortunately. "We have a high-level tank, we can just go all out, it's fine he can handle it!"
---
/r/TechnicallyTheTruth
---
I always salute the npc after i hand in that quest, dont see myself as being sentimental but it always gets me.
---
No I mean grow them from the loot farms.
---
Because the lvl 60 that joined last my very first run last night, I've done 3 half runs now, asked if we could do arena resets. I didn't answer because I couldn't remember what that was. One guy said sure. Another said he wants to kill as many bosses as possible. I then said me too and the lvl 60 started throwing a fit. I gave in because I just didn't have alot of time to game. We did 5 runs in half an hour and he bitched when we all said no we're not sitting around for another thirty minutes so we can reset. And I kicked him. 
---
Today I started a group and in LFG channel I said we are clearing as many bosses as possible and got asked to do golem lord resets. I kicked him on the spot. That's the point I'm trying to make.
---
I think he might be right. Only an true Alpha needs someone else to  2v1 on some lone guy. Only a beta will do a 1v1.
---
So, what you're saying is that your opinion is the only correct one?
---
You really will be fine as any class with him, the faster you guys can kill stuff, the better. Paladin would be good if you are going alli, me and a pally were soloing elite packs of 3 that were same or 1 level higher.
---
As long as he keeps up with weapons, he will be doing fantastic damage single target.
---
1. This is a screenshot from my buddies comp, not mine, my shit is default.
---
2. see above, I play a gnome /shrug
---
3. Most likely!
---
Yeah m8, TBC then WOLTK then MOP, WOD and so on till we do a full circle and WoW Classic 2.0 is released in 2035
---
Damn dude.  Here is a virtual hug to make you feel better (although I'm sure wielding that axe was award enough).
---
Lmaooooooo I literally just ran a dungeon were I pulled aggro on a basilisk after throwing heals onto a dps who kept taking aggro off the the tank. After the pull someone is complaining that "healer pulled aggro and booked it." I was literally stunned by the basilisk and could not run away even if i wanted to. Also, I wouldn't have taken aggro if the dps chilled and let the tank generate enough aggro to hold the mob. 
---
Like? Bye find yourself a new healer then, I don't have time for this.
---
You could invite me. I like normal dps and cc! :)
---
I don’t, usually only 10+ so I’m not a subject expert with 9s but I these suggestions could be applied to most any.
---
i went priest all the way'
---
There was a douchebag who did this on one of the pservers, I think Light's Hope? He haunted Red Ridge pretty much 14 hours per day. I have no idea what happened to him in high school, but he took it out on 14-18 alliance characters for almost a year.
---
No I'm just trying to share my perspective so the retailers can understand their flawed desire for new content that has led to modern wow as we know it
---
You are obviously not a rage addict
---
Reality is far more surprising than you think. It's humour, it might be adolescent and ridiculous but that was the  intended context.  
---
Sally Anne whom I responded too decided to be a miser, so a trolling is in order. Apparently much of reddit is full of neckbearded fedorites incapable of deciphering what sarcasm is.
---
There was a rogue addon back in classic that played Jackie Chan clips every time you crit.
---
Wotlk is the limit imo. Even then wotlk is shit compared to the holy duo

Technically that'd break rule 3, but not sure if that's actually enforced here or not.

Remaking expansions will literally lead to retail as we know it

why does this bitch even need MORE crystals

Perfect thank you!

I don’t know why but this made me laugh so damn hard

Honestly the 2 worriors fighting for agro ended with me in cat form for most of it

As a healer, I consider lock dps my dps.

As a gnome I agree. When I played horde back teh day I found them very tasty

Cheers, I'll try it tonight.

I do that ***all*** the time.

Awesome, me too!  If I can ever get past level 31, I'll see you there.

TIL. I thought for sure the EXP rewards were tied to relative difficulty.
---
Better question : How do I take a screenshot?
---
Why don't you translate it to OP's language then, genius?
---
To each their own. I prefer to clear the dungeon. It's easy experience. Yea, questing can give better XP but when you factor in the number of people who are also trying to complete the same quests, waiting for respawns, travel time and PVP the efficiency drops. Also take into consideration what spec people are leveling with. Questing as a feral druid is MUCH faster than leveling as a holy paladin or protection warrior. Depending on the situation, clearing dungeons is much more efficient for XP.
---
So you posted it to reddit to get another 25 people to go “hurr durrr if yous roll on a pvp server you must attack everyone non stop. You is smol dik” you really think there are different people on here?

Oof

By far one of the best ventrillo trollings i hope its a trend that continues into discord
---
I've only seen scarlet leggings drop after 10 runs :( still just trying to get my ravager :(
---
look i dont agree but i can understand where you're coming from... i guess just stick to your guns man and make sure everyones on the same page before kicking off the run
---
When phase 2 comes out, it wont matter if you want to 1v1 or not, groups of 5 or even entire raids will be formed and this 1v1 wont even be a thing. Might as well get used to it now and gank, especially if youre on a pvp server.
---
Good times, horde side
---
Personally I would use WeakAuras2 to track something like this but that addon has an extremely steep learning curve if you've never used it before.

You might have an easier time with something like TellMeWhen to track this

And warriors/rogues get a bunch of food. They can eat while the rest of us are drinking.

Everyone gets free food and everyone with mana gets free drinks.

It's not padding the meters when most trash packs in raids cleave.. If you hp drops you're getting healed.
---
Put some shoes on ya hippie.
---
Never thought about hitting critters to get a little rage before a pull. I’m sure it’s not viable in all situations, but it’s a cool suggestion nonetheless. Thanks for that!

"The unsent letter" The item that start the quest drops from VanCleef

I had a lock using fire-by-death (forgot name) and not understanding why he kept dying or that I was healing tank instead of him. Whole group basically told him he needs to learn to control aggro and not get your health down to 5hp before stopping

I would like an addon that plays the drowning countdown music from Sonic the Hedgehog when the breath meter gets low enough. Bonus points if it also adds the drowning sound effect when your character dies from drowning damage.

download TSM and keep track of what greens have a higher disenchant value than vendor value, for these items disenchant them and put the mats up on the auction house, do not enchant anything until you get your mount!  
---
For tailoring keep an eye out for items where the craftable cost is less than the market value - right now dreamweave gloves and robes net a 1g profit from this. buying linen cloth for less than 28c means you can create linen bags and vendor them for a profit, look up things like this. You can also hangout in a city and make tailoring items for tips.
---
Additionally a lot of people don't have a vendor price addon installed leading to a lot of people auctioning items for less than the vendor price, you can buy these and straight up vendor or disenchant and post the mats for significant profit
---
I had 50g at lvl 38 and managed to get to 97g by the time I was 40 by doing this and spamming SM, good luck!

i'm lvl 31 with only 14 gold....

u mean you don't like spamming SM? I literally stayed in SM from 28-43 just doing aoe runs as a mage.

There is a classic ignore and spam filter addon that I’ve been using that gets you most of the way there . It’s got rules for filtering certain messages by pattern and I think by channel as well and a list you can see and add notes too, but not the specific feature you are talking about which is “ignore this person for x minutes”. One workaround might be to ignore the person via the app and add a note next to their name that says something like “TEMPORARY” and then I ignore them next time you open the app
---
Alright - have a nice night.
---
I thought maybe you were being sarcastic since I assumed there would be plenty of guides available regarding best items for AOE threat gen when dungeon farming but I had a quick look at honestly couldn't find any directly addressing best in slot AOE threat items. There are some youtube videos but I despise video guides.
---
I wish I could help ya but I've never tanked in Vanilla. The little I've picked up from friends who tank is that [Skullflame Shield](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=1168/skullflame-shield#comments) almost single handily solves any AOE threat issues you might have, suppose to be really insane. The dynamite bombs you can make with Engineering also help a lot from what I've been told. I'd imagine if a piece has reflected damage on it and you don't sacrifice stamina/armour/hit chance by equipping it then it's probably worth considering if you feel you need more AOE threat.
---
Can't imagine you would want to go all out with reflecting gear though, I'd say you want just enough to let the DPS cleave away without losing threat. It's great generating a tonne of threat but if you just end up with you dying because you traded too much survivability then it kinda defeats the point I suppose. If you managed to get your hands on Skullflame combined with a bag full of engineering bombs and maybe some of that food that makes you breathe an aoe cone of fire then you would probably be an AOE threat powerhouse without looking much further. Take a pally/lock/druid for the reflect auras and sit back and laugh at the mages with their pathetic threat.
---
Hmm an annoying streamer that a ton of people hate who has tens of thousands of views has had himself chat banned a couple of times in RETAIL BTW.
---
To me that says there's no real chat ban issues at all.
---
This makes sense.  
---
If a Boe epic drops, literally everyone can get a Boe epic from it. Sell on AH and buy of AH again. Everyone needs, this is completely fair.
---
All cats do the same damage exactly. A 10 dps cat with 2s as will hit for 20. A 1s as cat will hit for 10. That's it.
---
Warrior. Quested from 50-55, then went prot and have been doing BRD and LBRS. Specced back to arms at 59 to finish a few quest chains for specific loot, hit 60. Then I’ll spec back to prot and be running. dungeons for a long time.
---
It's because you don't have a graphics card
---
In terms of dps, they are normalized within the pet types. The attack speed difference matters for caster pushback
---
It'll be easy. 
---
Warriors are the top dps class. Most high performing raid guilds are mostly warriors. Half of the entire raid is sometimes only warriors.
---
Launch through Steam to use the overlay.
---
Imagine release day. .. everyone jammed into that one crappy zone.
---
For what it’s worth it is more efficient for me to lifetap and then sit to eat bread. I imagine that’s not what you are talking about though.
---
Okay. So your first run you were inexperienced and caved. Next run you advertised to prevent that happening again.
---
Who cares if you get whispers from people asking you to do something else. Don't cave to the demands of random people. You owe them nothing. You are a tank. You can literally pick what you want to do.
---
So to sum up: you were not experienced. Now you are. So there's no longer a problem.
---
Flying and a separate world hub killed wow. If you want abandoned zones in classic go for it
---
Seeing this after healing a couple SM runs with 3 locks in the party is giving me PTSD
---
&gt;If you're so paranoid about getting ninja looted that you just stoop to doing it yourself
---
It isn't ninja looting when everyone has a fair chance at the loot.
---
Honestly thats going to depend on a huge amount of outlying factors like what server you are on, what times you're able to raid, how much experience you have raiding, how long it takes you to reach 60 and gear up, how many other DPS warriors are on your server etc. etc.  
---
Fury Warriors are top tier DPS in PvE so you SHOULD have a lot easier of a time compared to playing any other class
---
Using a Razer mouse?
---
51 is the best for ungoro. Can get all the quests and the mobs are max orange!
---
&gt;  big brain repair spare
---
I love it.
---
Only pet family affects dps.
---
For example cats do more dps than boars. Attack speed affects mostly in pvp where faster attacks cause more pushback when target is casting spells.
---
I legitimately saw someone arguing on the official forums that spell batching was not only a good thing for the game but crucial for his enjoyment and that he wouldn't play classic if it didn't have it. Don't underestimate fanatical purism.

I posted this above for someone else

Another alternative for your problem specifically is splitting your LFG geoip chat into its own chat window. After I took it out of General I find the amount of spam in General to be much more manageable

Well if you're giving the warlock mana of course he's gonna use it.

No, if you make a stop just to vendor you have an opportunity cost.

What addons are you using for the map?
---
Hellfire does a lot of damage though. Recently did a guild Mara run with 2 level 60s (they wanted the key so they could solo farm), one priest, one hunter. I did more dps than the hunter when going full hellfire mode.
---
I'm a newb. What do you mean about jumping off a ledge? Does succubus stop you from taking fall damage? Also, should i be leaving on soothing kiss all the time?
---
Two pieces of advice with mice:. Dont buy white ones, they discolor easily and look trashy, and dont go for one with a lot of buttons such as the G600 if you are averse to gross shit.  The amount of human goop that makes its way into all the nooks and crannies over time js downright horrifying, and trying to open it up to clean is what broke my last one.

I just have a Turtle Beach 300 now, simple, durable, easy to clean.

Don’t spend money, farm literally anything on quests. I’m level 34 warrior and have 120g and I did 0 auction house and 0 professions. I just vendored junk and items that were not best in slot

Is soloing same-level dungeon mobs a reasonable source of exp/money?
---
I'm a level 36 hunter. For example, I can pretty easily solo mobs inside scarlet monastery. Not tried a boss yet, idk if it's possible. But I'm asking how this compares to regular questing/grinding, exp and money wise?
---
The purpose of layering is to reduce the amount of people chasing the same limited goals. If I ask for an invite to change layers because my quest mobs are being Aoe farmed, would defeat the purpose of I got banned for it.
---

---
The pet DPS is the same across all pets. 
---
However a faster attack speed is preferred because more attacks = more chances for a crit, which procs Frenzy in the BM tree. It’s Frenzy that increases DPS. 
---
A faster attack speed also interferes with casting. Longer time to cast = less casts done = less damage done to your pet (or you).
---
Any pet that has a focus dump like Claw is also preferred for the above reasons as these add more hits on top of white pet damage. 
---
HOWEVER sometimes a fast attack speed can be a detriment - for example attacking a mob that gives damage to your pet on every hit will cause much bigger damage than it would to a pet that hits less often but for bigger damage. 
---
The Ghost Saber is arguably the prettiest unique pet in the game. Keep it if you like it ❤️
---
When you jump off a wall or something, if your pet doesn't have a direct path around, it will often try to run around and find a viable path down. With other pets, that don't have invisibility like the Succubus, it will aggro other mobs and bring them to you. This is especially relevant in some dungeons which have shortcuts involving jumping down walls, like in Blackrock (Spires I think) and in maraudon, for example.
---
Delve into those wailing caverns before they become a ragefire chasm.
---
&gt;I knew somebody was going to say this. 
---
Of course someone is going to say that when you're vague. Ironically, that's indicative of your lacking LFG leadership skills. You are too vague. I assumed "not a lot of time" was a lot less than 2½ hours.
---
What about pets critical attacking? Don't pet with higher AS have a higher chance of critical attacking more often than ones with slower AS?
---
I love the art style! MORE MORE MORE
---
Not in vanilla.
---
Drain tanking isn’t really viable until the 30s. That is when drain life jumps up in damage and you can get the necessary talents. At your level, dots+wand will kill mobs faster and result in more health/mana at the end of a fight than drain tanking will. 
---
At your level, you want to be going affliction. Imp Corruption, imp drain soul, 3/5 suppression, then imp life tap. 
---
Personally, I did that, then went for imp COA and amplify curse, until I was mid 20s. I respected to get imp corruption and the void walker talents in the demonology tree. At that level, the void walker can actually hold aggro from dot + wand. When I got to 32 i respecced again to go for drain tanking. 
---
If you don’t want to respec at all and just go for drain tanking, then go 3/5 suppression, 5/5 imp corruption, 2/2 imp drain soul, 2/2 imp life tap, 5/5 imp drain life, 5/5 fel concentration, 2/2 nightfall, 1/1 siphon life, 5/5 shadow mastery, then 1/1 dark pact. Afterwards you can either go demo to get more mana from your pet, or go destruction to have stronger nightfall procs
---
Why do you regret it? Is the horde population low?
---
It’s a fucking big upgrade for a hunter. Slightly less than for a warrior but who gives a fuck it’s an upgrade and you are leveling.
---
Prob my health. I hate being squishy and not being able to take much damage. Granite I could get more stamina but I just feel like a mashed Potato
---
Sorry let me give a more full answer
---
Sometimes in a run, between pulls I will lifetap 1-4 extra times before cannabilizing myself back to 90%+. Even in that case, a lot of healers will start reactively healing me after seeing my health bar decreasing. 
---
In effect they waste their Mana healing me since I was going to be topped off anyways. Almost never a big deal but a little pet peeve that adds some inefficiency. I try to mention it to my healers since not every warlock will be undead and humanoid corpses aren't always options.
---
what server
---
Quick tip, unlike actual vanilla, locks in classic can't kill themselves with life tap anymore, it just says "fizzled" when near enough to zero. I also hate when I drain myself to near zero, and then the healer heals me full by doing like 5 heals at once and then I still need to life tap some more and then they try to bring me back to full. Like, I'm okay at 70% even 50% health, especially when we're resting. Just heal me enough to not die immediately and I'll succ the rest haha
---
Default WoW soundtrack.
---
Oh for sure, enrage between packs is a staple. That and hitting every rat and snake I can lay a paw on. 
---
Still, there are some situations where you're left with nothing but the 10 rage from furor to start a pull with. I do my best to avoid those, and like plowing ahead with 60-70 rage if possible so I can start swiping like ham to stay ahead of the AoE mad DPS.
---
I dunno whether Exhaustion was changed later on, but I did swim there with my druid in WOTLK.
---
I like to lifetap back to about 50% Mana and then eat and drink to save time. Or lifetap to 80-90% Mana then bandage.
---
Cant you just spam high damage abilities or shadowbolt if the healer is topping you off?
---
Are you seriously kidding me. I told you three times now that the first time I messed up. The second time I said in the looking for group channel that we are killing as many bosses as possible and I invited someone and they said can we do golem Lord runs and I kicked him. Is your brain so tiny that you cannot comprehend that. My point is if someone says in looking for group channel what they are doing do not join the group and say let's do this. Now four times

---
Why are you on a pvp server than?
---
There is a r/Rattlegore community I believe.
---
Also, death to the Alliance if and when I see you. :D
---
Some locks tap themselves low AND pull aggro, then you have to ress them which takes a lot of mana. Waste of time for everyone.
---
Hell, I used to main a lock for years, now I dont even want to invite random locks.
---
I really don't understand why so many people are bothered how others play the game. If someone "rushed" to 60 how does that affect your gameplay? The beauty of Classic is nothing is ruined, you can still play however you wish to.
---
Classic isn't solo game so best is to find people who share your views and way of doing things. I've met plenty of people I don't agree with so I avoid grouping with them. It's that simple.
---
Others enjoy min maxing, others love taking their time, some enjoy doing every single quest. I talked to someone who had made 500g before reaching lvl 40 and that's how he enjoyed playing. None of these are wrong. I wish people would stop being bitter how others decide to spend their time.
---
Sorry 😐
---
Well you can certainly become part of a guild that does it. A lot of guilds will try.
---
No you arent
---
Uhh, you rolled on a PVP server and your faction member needed help. Not about alpha or beta shit, think it's more about helping out someone in need.
---
&gt; My point is if you don't kill the bosses for loot now, you'll be back at 60.
---
And time-wise, it is a lot more efficient to get max xp now then come back later at 60 and faceroll it.
---
Lots to improve on this writeup in my opinion.
---
You can learn a lot more from joining the Classic WoW discord where people who've done the research and used math can actually guide you to all the information you need on playing Warrior in classic.

Ah okay lol. So I’m assuming that’s a mage due to the robes? And lately mages are disliked and tanks are super desired. Pretty good! I like it. And thanks for clarifying.
---
i do this sometimes, it's almost always because the healer is bad at mana conservation or the dps is shit and fights go on and on and on
---
Valid. It's a good one.
---
My personal favorite hidden area is the single tauren-style hut sitting in the northwest part of the Stonetalon Mountains. It has a cooking pot, a few trees and some ancient elven ruins, and a beautiful view of the sky.

Edema Ruh is excited to share our story with you. We are an online gaming community that formed in 2015 on the Nostalrius private server. Even after it was shut down we continued playing on various private and retail servers. While we love playing games together, from our inception, we hoped to create something special. Like the people from whom our name is derived, we strive to promote deep community and excellence as our ideals. And for the first time ever, we wanted to provide a glimpse into the beauty of our journey so far!

There's no guards in thorium point so alliance can freely kill you, Kargath is a safe spot to chill while you form your group.
---
&gt;  It's not like they are going to bring back up to camp my body for the next 30 min.
---
Right, I see your problem.  You rolled on a PVP server.  What you should have done was cause that above scenario to happen, then get a bunch of your guys, and soon you have a whole fucking war.
---
The speedrun strat
---
ahahaha
---
I remember during WOTLK I once rode together with a friend through the entirety of Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms, during the Fire Festival.
---
A guy Duelrolled me for 20g last night, I won and he didn't pay up. Watch out for these dudes.
---
And my point is that I have never had that happen to me. I have never had someone join my group and ask to do something else.
---
And if it happened, I would just kick. There are plenty of other dps or healers to choose from. It's literally a nonissue you're getting so worked up over.
---
lol yeah some ppl dont really think bout that tbh
---
Igan’s doing his best, and that’s okay
---
I don't think Blizzard really knows at this point. Releasing BC would be the easiest and most obvious thing to do. 
---
I don't really see Classic + being a real thing as Blizzard cares about the lore. And adding in a bunch of stuff between Classic and BC is just going to mess up the lore or you are going to get a bunch of lore insignificant stuff that isn't very cool.
---
Loot the mobs
---
This is gold, thanks had a good laugh.
---
I think only addon that alters map is questie
---
here is a list of ones i have  https://imgur.com/vRD38Xs
---
There are two addons I've seen that do this.  VanosKoS and Spy. I enjoy Spy more.  It won't tell you if they are in your zone but when they are closer to you.  When you put someone in your kos list you can add notes to why you hate them and even keeps a win loss record of your fights.
---
Catseye Ultra-Goggles.  Get them, because I might see you first.
---
Has to have some sort of mental illness.
---
well sometimes theyre added in extra. like i had one along time ago for warlocks that did that but its main focus was something else if i remember correctly. i deleted that shit as fast as i could lol
---
i pulled loads of them every time when i was doing zf in traditional groups and it seemed way faster than when i did it while waiting at top
---
For professions if you do skinning you can get devilsaur for profit and to make your devilsaur set
---
Why dont you just change your rotation when you are being healed to more lifetapping and shadowbolts?
---
Look. Im not saying you all are the issue. But quite certainly, you all fucking are.  
---
I was trying to be nice. I spam lifetap until my life and mana are equally low. Then I sit down to drink and eat.  
---
Before I sit down to eat, the healer has already filled my health up. So I wasted my money on food I cant use. So, I stopped eating.  
---
Mages also hand me 4 stacks of water and 1 and a quarter stacks of food. So I cant even keep eating, as I run out of food constantly.  
---
I have first aid on 300. Using one bandage heals me up to 85%. So I spam lifetap until my life is depleted, so I can fully heal with bandages and cannibalism.  
---
Before my health is at 30% OUT OF FIGHT, my Health is full. So I wasted one of my heavy rune bandages for nothing. Now my cannibalism is on CD, for nothing. Because you thought healing me is a good idea. No its not and we warlocks dont eant fucking 100% life most of the time.  
---
80% of the time we actually want to drain our opponents, get nightfall proccs out of it and do more damage, while healing ourselves and helping the healer out.  
---
STOP HEALING EVERY SMALL CRATCH. YOU ARE RUINING IT FOR YOURSELF.
---
You've barely started the chain. Go back to the Fallen Hero and he'll give you the continuation.
---
I always wonder whether it is my class or me that my UI looks the way it is. Half my UI is filled with UI elements. 20 totem already take up a good amount of space.
---
Awwww!
---
So you're either a shit mage or all you do is raiding.
---
Yea, id just add unless pet has full mana dont lash of pain anymore on new mobs since it interrupts her 5 second rule mana regeneration.
---
You can afford to be an enchanter and get that +8% boot speed
---
Its in game. Did it last night
---
Undead mage here.  
---
Hi.
---
I thought that too for the longest time but apparently the color is just an indicator for how hard the quest will be relative to what level you are.
---
So a good group for you is 4 people that only do what you want instead of a full run? Got it.
---
I'd rather be surrounded by good party members, thanks for the offer tho.
---
I have come across more toxic players and noob tanks than noob/idiot hunters. I've had people literally scour our guild /who list and try to get one of our members gkicked because they lost a roll on an item. Really hilarious stuff when you hear what led up to their decisions.
---
He was almost giving up on the Rogue. I've told him "get to level 10, learn dual wield and I'll buy two nice swords, then you can quit the Rogue if you want".
---
Hope it helps to make him keep going haha (I believe he went to sleep, its 01:00 here, so I think he will keep leveling tomorrow)
---
GlobalIgnore? I couldn't find any "ignore for X minutes" within that addon.
---
This is the correct answer.
---
5th actually of ten. 
---
It’s right in the middle.
---
At 55 now and I have winterspring, eastern plaugelands, and sithilus + random guild runs. Seems okayish?
---
So true lol! Had a pally buff me BoW so i would tap less lmao
---
Please never fix this typo.
---
not sure, i was using it since release day :)
---
Reduce, reuse, recycle.
---
A blue plate helmet with lots of int stat
---
I know paladins did it to have a ranged pull
---
STOP
---
I’m a noob so that’s probably why I’ve been using the walker. It’s more conservative. Gonna experiment with the succubus though.
---
&gt;Unless You're trashing items to make room you don't lose money.
---
.... Yeah?
---
That is literally exactly what you'd be doing with 6 slotters.
---
It is quicker because the healers mana is spend less. We have cannibalize, first aid, siphon life, drain life. You are quite literally wasting your mana most of the time if you heal a lock.  
---
Do you know what healers I love most?  
---
Those that give me renew and let me do whatever I want.
---
Im leveling as Ret, 31 atm, but want to go aoe as soon as it is viable for me.
---
From what I've read, a combination of Holy and Protection serves best, cuz u can stack reflect dmg with blessing of protection and ret aura, and holy shield as well.

Whats your opinion on that vs Ret/Holy in terms of aoe effectiveness? I have a warlock I level with exclusively so the fire shield is extra reflect and the hellfire/rain of fire really helps out the aoe, so as tempting as going Ret with the extra single target dps sounds (im dreading giving up the run speed and fat 2h procs lol) im thinkin with the warlock stacking reflect might be best. Thoughts?
---
It's good to pull with but ya you should replace it quickly.
---
Yup its general option outside of your profile setting if i am not wrong
---
They tried this on our server too (Flamelash EU), by the time we got there though, thrall and all the others (NPCs)had already wied the floor with them.
---
Is life drain good dps compared to stuff you could be casting instead?
---
Hmm I can go Paladin if he decided to roll ally (he still undecided between Undead and Human/Dwarf. I'm letting him decide, but if he end up playing on Ally, do you recommend my Pally to go more tank/healer/retri? (I've never played as Pally)
---
Well Gromgol is a good chunk better. It connects you directly to the capitals on both continents and to Booty Bay. 
---
I can get anywhere in the world in about 15 minutes.

Easy. Quest related message. Check quest addons. You only have Questguru. Its questguru
---
Send to me please as well!! Am going to main warlock and disc priest in classic and I have no idea what I'm doing when it comes to lock
---
Need a warrior named potatosmash
---
You are rare. I get 4 stacks of water and 1 stack and a quarterstack of food most of the time.
---
yeah this feels about right, there arnt alot of quests or dungeons to do so it can get very repetitive.
---
Solution: Implement player housing. New raids award chairs and flowerpots. But instead of traditional housing that encourages people to hide from the world, it can be something creative like ships that can be used to travel to new lands in the South Seas, which was their original idea for the first expac, btw. Or make housing portable and placeable in certain places in the open world, kind of like the leaked "Create House" spell in alpha (layering solves a lot of potential issues here.) I know these are kind of kooky ideas, but it's fun to imagine alternate paths.
---
Damn. But ok, deal.
---
On my Server there is a mage constantly in Kargath.
---
Same id like to have fiddle with it. Curious as to what you do after you get dark pact
---
Yup, you're right. Scrolled down to see the follow-up post.
---
Scatter/intimidation was my absolute favorite PvP spec
---
I don't understand. Is life drain better dps than shadow bolts?
---
Good.
---
Mgla - Age of Excuse
---
You're right, I mistyped. Meant threat.
---
Better safe than sorry. I mained a holy pally from Vanilla through Legion. When allergy season came around I would have these sneezing fits with like 6+ sneezes. Ever so often I would miss a heal and the tank would die, sometimes resulting in a wipe. It was a big thing in my guild and people would constantly remind me to take my allergy meds. 
---
My point is, even with the most seasoned players, things happen out of your control.
---
Follow the mushrooms
---
Can't wait to stockpile snowballs when AV is out.
---
I hate when I bandage myself up and some priest thinks its cool to heal me to 100%.  
---
No dude. You literally wasted 2 cloth that dropped, by simply making my bandage irrelevant.
---
Here’s a whole post on it: [Dive’s drain tanking guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ccxosl/dives_drain_tanking_guide_for_warlock_leveling_in/)
---
I see. Dragonscale set over devilsaur for hunter? If i go elemental LW, I can still get everything (use/equip) I could've made from other specs right?
---
I'd rather have an addon that plays a celebration sound when my evic doesn't miss.
---
having 8 30s instead of at least 1 60

Not sure how comprehensive this is but i think its pretty good.
---
&gt;2 - low/mid lvl dungeons your single target damage is fine, you can blade flurry every 2min to keep up with cleaving classes but outside of BF you're going to be tunneling 1 mob at a time. The thing is its not just the damage that makes a rogue valuable, you can save your group from countless wipes by using your whole kit all of the time - using stuns to help your healer catch up, gouging mobs that are running at your healer due to healing aggro, distracting patrolling packs to allow your group to reposition etc etc. This stuff is still super useful in raids/end dungs, if not moreso.
---
I've told him that. I don't think he will manage to do it on the first few levels, but its something else (apart from DPSing) to learn and master (its one of the things that Rogue is one of my favourite classes on retail)
---
&gt;3 - skin/lw is fine, if its your guys first time playing wow though maybe just go skin/mining to keep it simple, sell the ores for gold or hoard to level engineering at some point.
---
Not my first time, but it is his. Would you say Skining/Mining would be better than? I believe LW/Skinning can payoff later on, and its somewhat cool to craft your own gear.
---
50 mobs hitting you for 50dmg each is gonna kill you just as easily as an elite hitting you for a few hundred a hit 
---
unless you are capabable of aoeing that shit down you just wiped the group
---
this is what i ended up having to do. i hit 40 in cath (did 32-40 in 2 daysbecause i REALLY wanted ice barrier), ended up doing a few more lvls there to get some gold to train skills after the mount drained me. then left at about 44 and went too tanaris to quest.... then ran out of quests by 46 went to searing gorge and tried my hand at that...ran out of 'easy' quests.
---
eventually i ended up in a full run ZF group too finish those quests then i started to do GY spams. helps im a mage.
---
i could of solo aoe farmed, but its just not consistent enough.

OP, how did you get the runecloth?  It took me an hour to farm 60 cloth from mobs and it’s going for 1g 40s a stack on my server.  That’s thousands of gold I don’t have to spend...
---
I used to play a grindfest where using mana caused you’re magic level to go up, so full mana was a huge no-no. Now I’m playing a lock and have to catch myself from doing this.
---
I'm keeping my belt in the bank. never selling it.
---
I have all those addons too and haven't had any issues, have you tried making sure all your addons are up to date?
---
&gt;World PvP is where Rogue's shine, they are built to assassinate other characters that are unwary and it really shows when you can basically murder people and disappear before their friends even know what happened.
---
Haha. Thats the point I believe I've sold him on playing Rogue (not sure if that the correct expression in english). And playing with him as Priest (I've taken Alchemy/Herb) I think we can do some damage on PvP.
---
Tauren can only ride the faction Wolves and Kodo except for the super rare drops that aren't even in the game yet
---
I got lucky tonight pulling an Enchant Gloves - Riding Skill formula out of a 175 lockbox. On my server these are listed on the AH for between 275g-300g. What should I do with this? I'm a level 47 mage. Is it better to sell now before more are put onto the market or should I hold? If i sell now what is the best thing for me to do with the cash?
---
Explain him the downtime and tell him to learn first aid. He quite literally never needs any heal.
---
As a healer I’ve been getting the real classic experience of no one knowing what they’re doing. It’s great
---
All fixed by communicating
---
Sorry about your life
---
I’m running tailoring/enchanting but there is a good chance I drop enchanting once I don’t need to worry about money as much.
---
Westworld reference?
---
The problem is, being at 100% hp while not having 100% mana means you're missing half your regen as a warlock
---
Amen drood bro. Humanoid classes are for casuals anyway
---
nothing its just manner thats all. If they dont they you can flag then as a ninja looter on the server.
---
My 3 Warriors, 1 Shaman, and a Priest laugh at your puny comp.
---
Potatofury
---
So there is a very good way to circumvent this... Just kick the huntard. Like srsly, hunters add no single important role to a dungeon group. There is no need to keep a hunter around if he fucks you over.
---
Ooh that's a good one too.
---
Bartender
---
Berserker rage before charge. That way after the blood rage you can count on having enough rage for whirlwind
---
people were censusing (is that a word? lol) without wowhead's help anyway. On all the official realm discords they had census info before wowhead posted anything
---
“Out of town”would work to keep the rhyme. Can you quickly just record the whole thing in wow theme please thanks
---
Oh yeah, fair enough. Still interesting unexpected history.
---
I mean, they're policing people who stand on top of buildings, even though they're just exploring and not hurting anybody.
---
Blizzard is pretty on top of things.
---
Fair enough.
---
In at least three separate comment threads you're complaining about this.
---
I don't blame you with being frustrated with finding groups, but maybe find a better guild.
---

Were you getting the leader of the pack buff though?

Wait are you on Benediction??

Model replacements is against the ToS; use at your own risk.  Yes, even replacements for simple cosmetic purposes.

This brings back memories from Ghostlands.

Blizz must really have wanted to give us a taste of the terror with Knucklerot and Luzran.
---
try downloading the latest version of bartender, maybe.
---
Modifying skins is against the ToS.

I've easily sold 30 stacks of silk made into bandages to the vendor by now.

Most of them are in BG's, and use MM. None of them show how to level with a pvp spec.
---
This weekend is twitchcon
---
What quest addon is that?
---
Press tab
---
First time I've ran across it. Community has been great until lately. Guess the the rae to gear up is making everyone crazy
---
This dude VoiVid has an interesting spec that goes 7/33/11 that he runs with void walker. The whole thing is based around letting VW1 take damage through soul link, sacrificing it, then almost immediately having another VW up to continue to take more damage through soul link (and being able to sac this one too if necessary).  For alliance, it’s weaker against shaman, but there are a lot fewer shaman than undead. 
---
Full disclosure, haven’t actually tried it yet and the drain tanking w/ suck is probably better leveling (I’m on horde side), but I’m for sure going to respec and try it out at level 60. He talks about it in [this video starting at 2:00 in. ](https://youtu.be/RjMgi8dAXtw)
---
But alliance
---
This.
---
Good to know. I already give him the plantains because my character is an omnivore and I find it takes up less bagspace when we share the food. As a Hunter I don't get hit a lot, so I don't need to heal as often.
---
As a warrior most of my abilities are macros that either start or end with /startattack
---
At some point your shadowbolt just destroys everything.  
---
I can crit for 2.5k with shadowbolts. There is no way a wand is ever going to outdps that.  
---
A wand is good for leveling on your own or in lower level dungeons to not pull aggo.  
---
Later on its a statstick.
---
Druid should be potatomedley

That's not UI bro. Addons are for UI modifications not graphics.

Om sure some additional windows unit frames etc... but lets just agree that all these things are part of the interface. Not the graphics.

Also go back to retail, thanks.
---
And here dear watchers, can you see the actual population of Nost without bots.

---
Bite 6, Claw 6, Pet level 41, I'm level 42. I've got all my abilities from the pet trainer that are important, and I've trained every useful spell (Skipped things like Track Demons, Track Undead, Distracting shot)   
---
I really hate how many comments here are assuming I'm brand new, I spent hours on google trying to find a leveling guide that wasn't Beast Mastery before coming here. I wish I didn't have to come here, but here I am :(
---
I personally find 40-44 to be a slog. Most zones have really weird questing patterns where you run more than you actually do stuff so you sit at like 15k exp per hour during questing. Cath is the only dungeon viable to still level in and even this is not giving you a lot anymore. And on 44 you can finally get into ZF.
---
Are you making sure to sit and eat for 10 or 15 seconds. Can’t remember
---
Could you tell me how you know this please? I don't mean to sound rude.
---
Alliance waiting for horde outside yeti cave
---
&gt;3) it's up to your friend I guess, if he likes the idea of gathering mats go skin/mine, if he wants make things throw LW in there (: we both know he'll have fun regardless right?
---
Well, its Classic!
---
Make a /startattack macro
---
Spy Classic does this, every time it detects an enemy player it will pull you to your current zone.
---
My apologies everyone, seems this was a troll.
---
I am deleting this post.
---
&gt; This post is about "in my opinion" classic being a grind and retail having no grind. 
---
No you didn't talk about grind you talked about it being harder and it doesn't matter if its your oppinion or not its still false.
---
&gt; All I did was say the elements you think is harder in retail don't exists in classic. 
---
And still you said retail as it is, would be easier. If I would follow that logic i could also say you are not allowed to talk about dungeon finder in retail nor are you allowed to argue about heirlooms because those things are not in classic also every gear trader should not be taken in consideration because they aren't in classic either.
---
You just picked out the things like heirloom which aren't in classic and say those make retail easier but on the other side you say m+ is not allowed as arguement because its not in classic ...
---
See how dumb that comparison is ?
---
Get 50 more enchanting
---
What’s the quest addon at the top?
---
well thats cause u can actually tank and you arent human scum... but if u suck at tanking and or comunicating or make a own group u come here am cry
---
Yes. Lotta people fail to mention that.
---
However it's *really* only notable to worry about that for over 2.0as, which only a few random specific pets have.
---
Start wow and deactivate the intel graphics card in device manager
---
Will give it a try tomorrow, also how do I make sure the add-on I downloaded using twitch client is for classic, as far as I know twitch interface identify retail and classic as same WOW
---
Lol, you unironically believe their reference client is accurate. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
Why did you grind the centaur rep? I just did the quests in Desolace until there were singular quests sending me to the other end of the zone, then I left the zone again.
---
I've been in Guilds of people speaking all kinds of languages, for some reason Afrikaans is probably the one I have most come across. I can't believe people really give a damn.
---
If people post in chat about fighting Alliance or getting ganked I will come try to fight as long as I'm not directly in the middle of something. I'm glad people like you say stuff, helps me find fun pvp :)
---
Dw i’m a tank - no issue finding groups. Enchanting is lvl’d purely through disenchanting materials - so the jump your making is completely retarded. Maybe if you took herbs from the dungeon from alchemy which would make sense to me anyway.
---
Mages hate him too.. I hate how often I have to drink up. :-(
---
Ok this is cool but why is he on top of his cabin lol
---
Easy
---
1. Get enchanting to 300
---
2. Farm crusader enchantment
---
Some people may say getting handouts is cheating. I think it’s all apart of the community aspect. Obviously he saw some good in you too.
---
It’s not well fed though. Look at your buffs. 1 should be mp5
---
55-60 you spend in dungeons farming pre raid bis.
---
Level 42 mage atm, speced into a frost aoe grind build. What are the best places to AoE grind? I'm currently doing those 36/37 murlocs in dustwallow marsh. I assume it's too early to farm southseas?
---
Im horde if that makes a difference
---
I can't make it work. Do I still need to click the bobber and press whatever button I have to recast fishing? And which ones are the sound ones?
---
Is that guild from Terenas H EU?
---
LET ME CORRECT YOU.
---
Oh, I was wrong too...
---
Happens to the best of us.
---
There's a difference between crying, bitching, and asking for some help because you literally cannot play the game. Sometimes you just want to vent, sometimes people are being whiny b******. Learn to tell the difference
---
The bottom 4 dps are significantly worse than the top 4.
---
Plus Mages have some nasty AOEs, right? haha
---
I believe he will decide tomorrow, but I'll try to make him go at least up to level 15.
---
On a sidenote, I haven't decided a main yet but the character I'm playing most is my Priest and thinking to try a Mage for an alt. haha
---
I'll bend over backwards for my tank, but pre-60 I can count on one hand the number who actually used taunt, or a shield, or BOTH.
---
Not sure, but I imagine changing the 0 to a 1 would be the solution.
---
Yes but if the idea is that a good tank is frustrated at dumb dps wouldn’t it be funnier to have the dps getting all the likes while the tank is ignored?
---
Combat swords is only better if solo or if you can't get behind the mob. If someone else can hold aggro, combat isn't even close to daggers, ambush and backstab are way too good.
---
https://youtu.be/kLyXin7jpqM?t=1243
---
Ya. I shoulda mentioned I was talking about lower lvls. I know shadowbolt does more later
---
Wrong
---
well the later the game (level or charprogression) the more loot drama of any kind there are alot of nice people who play but with the way the game is designed loot wise even nice people get greedy for loot or start drama thats just part of the game
---
You can always turn Screech off autocast if it causes trouble in groups. 
---
I wouldn't recommend having a dungeon-only pet while leveling. With two pets you'd need to spend the 5 gold to unlock your second stable slot for learning new abilities, and that's pricey at low  levels. And depending how much questing/dungeons you do, one pet may fall behind in level.
---
plz tell lol
---
&gt; human warrior
---
&gt; I like PvP a lot 
---
🤔
---
This. The racial ability for Orcs is actually bad for tanking and Taurens are neither not bad and not good. Very mediocre.
---
Ohhhh spicy hunter here.
---
It's not about aggro, it's about being able to tank two enemies with CoA while you focus the third, and then giving you the bubble when you accidentally pull the fourth.
---
What a steal!
---
The default Win10 installs (Home and Pro both) hog tons of resources. Either downgrade to Win7, or install LTSC/LTSB edition of Win10 then use some of the custom userscripts out there to disable all of the bloatware crap. Also make sure you clean all the dust out of your laptop, open it up and make sure there aren't clumps of dust or anything. Depending on how long you've had it, can also apply new thermal paste to the CPU.
---
Molten core is easy enough such that pugs will clear it soonish.
---
Healers can't kill other players, LIES!
---
Getting gold instead of exp at level 60 is a thing now..  
---
I'm just gonna grind to 60 and find out, for science
---
Jaguars in Swamp of Sorrows. Can do the dreaming/adolescent whelps there too and basilisks.
---
I'd say it's more they don't know which buttons to press. 
---
I am constantly telling shaman's to not use earth shock  (except as an interrupt) and rock biter because they generate high threat. Telling people to melee from behind so the mob can't parry them. I've seen several hunters running around with Strength gear instead of agility. 
---
How many of them realize that in battle and berserker stance you generate threat with an 80% modifier? And it's a 130% modifier in defensive? That revenge costs 5 rage and you can spam it every 5 seconds as long as you dodge/block/parry and if you have a shield you will, and it generates the best threat-per-rage of your skills? Some of them might know about sunder armor, but how many are just spamming heroic strike and expecting it to work because it says it generates threat? Sure you are "tanking" with a 2h, but they are only tanking by virtue of DPS and not making use of what makes a warrior a good tank.
---
I wouldn’t mind this either tbh. Locks have a lot of “oh shit” buttons we can press and 30% isn’t as bad for us as any other class
---
No. It isn't. It's terrible DPS and a waste of mana. It's just a bad spell in general. I even see some locks use it in PvP, which is even worse.
---
Dat bonus nice tho
---
Am I crazy or does Dark Pact give like, no mana?  Mine does 150 MP at level 40 and my mana pool is already over 2k. Can’t imagine how useless this is going to be in 10 levels :(.
---
No theres not a difference. It's all bitching about pvp on a pvp server. Organize a pvp group but dont get pissy when nobody wants to join
---
Why because I voiced my opinion on a public forum about disliking blanket statements? If anyone actually takes "red its dead" seriously, I avoid them like the plague, I don't want to play with spastic kids who attack in sight and have no tactical thought whatsoever. That's why I dislike the saying so much. And I spoke up because I hear fucking 10x a day, its goddamn annoying, you sound like a parrot who cant think on their feet when you say that. 
---
Also I'll take whatever i want as seriously as I want, thank you. Cinnamon toast crunch is the best cereal and I'll hear no arguments on that.
---
It’s good for pala tank if you’re not an engineer.. and if your a pala tank and not an engineer.. well.. oof
---
You can go compare aoe farming videos from classic (Faxmonkey in particular) and see that he goes way closer to the mobs than is possible in Classic without getting hit.
---
lol no you don't. I soloed it using only self buffs. Not hard at all.
---
Dr. Phil clips on YouTube. My class lectures.
---
Is it’s only about disenchanting tailoring items you might as well level your Bank alt to 5 and have him disenchant them. Instead pick up a gathering profession to make gold.
---
Way back in the day there was a thing where you could share damage with your pet 50/50 - is that dark pact?
---
I actually had “AC” gear and melee weapons with procs, used the earth pet (whatever it’s called - the tank with root) and leveled as a melee/dot/drain character. Wasn’t the most efficient thing but fuck it was fun.
---
Yeah, warlock that sits at 100% of green mana while not at 100% of blue mana is wasting his resources. You have so many abilities that give you free heals and also your natural regeneration.
---
As a druid tank, I have done it once or twice on accident because I got caught up in the rythm and forgot to look at my healer's mana. Thankfully, Innervate exists for these mistakes.
---
If you haven't you should definitely checkout  [http://warcraftlesstraveled.com/](http://warcraftlesstraveled.com/)  for heaps of out of the way places before Cata.

Win
---
Don't you need Wolf Riding to be able to ride it? So a Tauren, Troll or Undead still needs to be exalted to be able to actually buy the training.
---
Audioslave. Many memories of Chris Cornell all over Azeroth.
---
It is confirmed that the cooler your pet looks, the more damage it does
---
Quick question, does the mount cost 900g? Someone told me the best part of this grind is that you don't have to pay full price for an epic mount.
---
While I guess brutal is subjective, 1-60 on wow only got me 6 fishing levels on old school runescape
---
And running through the gauntlet of death from horde can’t be pleasant.
---
Come join me on Kirtonos. Horde. I need friends. Chamdar is my name.
---
32!? I just hit 32!
---
I've been waiting so long for this day..
---
Best place to farm gold? Lvl 37 and only 33 gold I heard farming jaguars are efficient but not sure what’s best. Thanks
---
The culprit is Spy Classic. I accidently replied this to Laurikens instead of you. Everytime an enemy gets close to you the add-on forces you to look at your own zone, I think to prepare you for possible pvp. I don't think there's an option to disable that feature so all you can do is turn Spy Classic off temporarily if you're gonna be looking at the map for a while.

*Nothing?* I wore his chestplate until level 40!

I loved healing on my druid in vanilla/BC. Just turn into a tree, MotW everyone, HoTs the tank, throw in a healing touch every now and then, and if shit goes south, use tranquility. Oh and of course, innervate
---
The people who successfully run aoe cleave groups don't have anything to whine about because they knew that classic has shit balance and they picked the classes that were good.

That Radeon is more powerful than the intel 620 integrated graphics, so you need to ensure the game is loading with that, think you can force it in the Radeon software.

It's a pretty good reason to tell everyone you know "These guys behave like children, so don't group with them"
---
look at that chad strut
---
Absolutely false. Example: as a retail player, I never even knew where Thunder Bluff was or how to get there. In retail I just took the portal to get there. In Classic, TIL (literally just today) that TB is right next to the Barrens. I learned this because I actually had to walk there. I was, and am, mind blown. For some reason I thought it was on another world or something.
---
(Also, I'm a very middle-aged man. I don't get starry-eyed about anything anymore.)
---
Causing you to have more time to do dps , causing our group to do it more efficient. as i can rest while you do dps and tank takes dmg , but i cant heal if you and tank are resting or "Taking maximum advantage of your regen" xd
---
It's like that one dude from the Lego movie "SPACESHIP"
---
My guess is the ToDoChecklister
---
This makes me so happy seeing this. This is what classic is about. Bringing back the vanilla sense of community.
---
Will not add up to 12 gold though. Nobody trashes items. Just low selling trash.
---
Passive aggressive? It's more like no matter your opinion on anything, you'll get torn apart and told you're wrong by anyone on wow or Reddit.
---
Craft the Robe then unlearn Tailoring. That's what I will do, most likely
---
Low iq

And the exact same thing happens in end game vanilla dungeons when people cba explaining things, so I'm not sure what your point was beyond "some people dont want to teach and are kinda dicks".

United alas!

I started as a warrior and a mage, had it planned for years. Wasn’t feeling the mage around level 20, started a hunter and fell in love. Now my warrior and hunter are both 37.
---
To be fair if you overpull that void sac is extremely useful.
---
You would think so, but I cannot get that to work.
---
A lot of warrior "tanks" dont use sunders
---
He walked up to me and asked if I wanted page 27 and I respectfully told him "no thanks". He opened up trade and gave it to me anyway and then went back to shouting. 
---
Strange fella.
---
Jaguars are really good at 36-39, then there's gorillas and basilisks in STv at like 39-42 if you haven't gotten the mount money by then.
---
you can just layer hop to avoid
---
Honestly look how much elemental fire is going for on your realm, on mine its 4.5-5g each and they can drop from lvl 39+ fire elementals, such as those in arathi highlands.
---
A mage initiating combat on a warrior is the least fair fight you'll have in this game.
---
What item?
---
Could be ur firewall settings. This happened to me before.
---
No it's fine as is
---
It’s a quest isn’t it? You have to get one lot to hate you to do the quest
---
Maces was only good in TBC. Esp bc of the BS mace.
---
Most recently and the thing that prompted this is the Ring from Princess in Mara. It was just me and the enhanced shaman. He died to the first round of farts. I rolled 94 he rolled 98. Salty fr
---
I use totemtimer.
---
It's simple. I wave.. you wave. If dont see no emote back, sorry to say.. 
---
That said, I never thought I'd see someone else from Skeram on this sub. This is my main server on retail  painfully dominated by allaiance to the point Org ends up with like 28 people late at night. If that.
---
What are you talking about, nobody does that because engi is super cheap to level off the AH
---
The Rogue failed to manage his threat and then failed to Vanish to save himself.  His death is entirely his fault and I'd have told him that.
---
As a healer, I try to keep track of people's CDs so that I know who can't save themselves.  For example, if the Mage had already Iceblocked recently but the Rogue hadn't used Vanish, I'd prioritize the Mage over the Rogue (behind the tank and myself obviously).
---
While occasionally pulling aggro is just a fact of Classic (if the Tank's RNG causes all his abilities to miss), but its the responsibility of the DPS to be ready for that with their own life-saving abilities.
---
I did similar and even Ashenvale on its own had far more players online than there were in total at 60.
---
Dont invite them? As a warrior you can choose.
---
still no official ban wave for dungeon layering exploit abusers
---
Nice! I’m a 54 Hunter names Ashrynn soon to be 60 this week!
---
Hey, at least you're being honest with yourself and seem to be satirically bitching
---
[I found that too](https://imgur.com/a/qg7H5yF)!
---
Thats pre bis for half the classes lol
---
Its not about THAT someone rushed to 60, its about HOW they rushed to 60 because this can snowball into a certain meta since people now get a hold of how he did it and want to mimic it.
---
So lets say someone found out you can farm level 1 boars all the way to 60, lets say its the best xp per hour and there is no penalty if you do it in a group.
---
People will start searching for boar groups, people will start telling you "dude no one is doing dungeons, better get a boar group man", the people who want to quest there and have to do the kill 30 boar quest and the get 50 boar meat quest cant do it because a bunch of 5 man groups are killing every single one of them and so on... soon its considered the only most efficient way to level and a majority of people will bent the game towards "1-60 you have to grind boars, nobody will do other shit since its less efficient".
---
Guilds who wanna start raiding are going to mock their members "guys stop running dungeons, farm boars to get 60 fast gogo"...
---
Nobody here cares if you enjoy grinding boars, nobody cares if you do it all day and have success with it. But, once you set this meta and more and more people start doing this it will impact other people and once and at this point its no longer about "I just do my stuff I enjoy the most, why are people bothered how I play the game?".
---
I bring it up again, see the 10 man raid SM cleave xp grinds. 3 groups of friends or guilds are doing this? NOBODY CARES.
---
1 day later, you werent able to find a normal group anymore because everybody ONLY LFM for 10man raid cleave. Certain classes get pretty much ignored entirely because "meta is mages warlocks priests, nobody will take a rogue or hunter into a cleavegroup" and here I hope you see how it impacts other people.
---
The point is its not about people dont like how you play the game, it about people advertising a playstyle to the crowd followed by a lot of copycats starting to play exactly like that as well until its considered "the only way to play".
---
This is the same why people cried about the LFG Addon, because if it would have gone live, at some point to find a dungeon it would have been considered the only way to search for groups and people who would try to use the chat for it would be isolated from the community.
---
If your way of playing is pulling a level 63 elite dragon and kite him somehow over to the main city to have the guards kill him and this is how you farm xp - as you said its the beauty of classic, do whatever you like however if you set a meta you should be able to take negative responses if people arent happy that they now have to kite dragons to stormwind all day to level because everything else is considered "not efficient".
---
&gt;  it just feels a bit unbalanced and unfair.
---
The whole point of classic is to be unbalanced and unfair.
---
I mean the group your describing sounds like everyone picks a different target in a different group and does there own thing and expects to live. If every dps kills skull then it basically gets deleted while the tank gets aggro on the remaining mobs. 
---
The alternative is waiting for the tank to get some threat on all and I guess frost bolting each mob once so you don’t risk making the healer have to change targets.
---
.
---
Ad a Human mage, I agree. I only went alliance because Im on a horde heavy server and I wanna play against the odds.
---
I joined a full group as dps. It’s my own fault but still.
---
Yes. Yes they did. I've seen some bandwagon streamers picking up WoW for the very first time and all their Fortnite crowd was spamming chat how they're gonna download it and go Horde too. No wonder there's so much more Horde than Alliance.
---
Do-wa Diddy, Diddy dum Diddy do
---
i got one on the first ever whelp i killed. i was like "how cool would it be if i got the whelping now?" and boom i got it.
---
that must've been all the luck i had though, because the black drake heart hasn't dropped for me in like 10 hours of killing whelps..
---
Dude dont complain, you got dinner *and* a show
---
You only adopted RNG from our WF totems. We were born with it, sculpted by it.
---
The dance broseph, the dance.
---
To be fair imp is also an insane mana battery, but the real thing I find incredibly impressive has been that how similar classic is to vanilla, yet how differently people play it.
---
95% of locks are running around with succubus, crazy guild chat about fury/prot DW end raid game, feral dps/tank with Plummers. 
---
I think private servers have educated and enhanced our understanding of so much that we are all groundhog daying to perfection.  Imagine what we'll know phase 6+
---
Yeah but enhance is no bueno
---
Just buy a run at 60 for like 20g. Saves you time and stress and is cheap for a BiS item. 
---
Wait until you start farming for savage gladiator chain and HoJ, that’s when the real fun starts.
---
Where were you earlier today before my Darn to SW run???
---
The only lower level enchants that really sell are the +gathering to gloves and minor speed to boots.
---
I spent 6 hours farming for crusader before it dropped a little over a week ago. I have made over 250g in tips since. If there is one enchant you could have, crusader is the one.
---
I never really cared enough to speak up about this but I tend to agree.
---
I just don't join those groups, it's not just about being selfish for one item. 
---
Everyone knows the selfishness surrounding loot is baked in to specific personality types. It's common sense, so its not worth doing a full run with at least one person who in reality has the potential to be selfish about all the loot that drops.
---
It's more or less like that.
---
Or a Libram or set bonus that gives Paladin %mana on healing received. Throw in some defense, block, and spell power and you have a viable Prot Paladin tank.
---
That is why I said almost, one green every hour isn't doing much for leveling that proff.
---
/hug
---
plate mail
---
If you’re going to spend the 300g now, then sell it now. If you’re going to save for your epic mount, stash it to sell when you’re 60. There will be many more enchanters who want it than copies around.
---
It's Kcolraw if anyone remembers me. Proud of this thread 😭👌💕
---
I’m curious how you couldnt find any answers? Googling classic warrior dual wield would have answered everything lol
---
How much rested XP can you store? Like, how often should I log into my alt and play on him to get the best use of rested XP?
---
then ytf r u running w/ randoms? I'd advise to roll need on all BoE epics - it was done in classic at least w/ the groups I ran with (and they were pugs). With rares - if you know that it's going to sell for a lot, then need it. as someone else would probably know that and do the same.
---
If it's a BoE, you can always trade it to the group member that will equip it.
---
That said, declare what the rules are at the start of the run.
---
We had brain cage drop in my BRD/LBRS (forget which side) and the guy who won the roll tried to sell it to us for 5g without takers
---
I feel like it's worth more to a shaman than a paladin.  I told the guy to try neutral AH
---
Have you looked through your spell book? It is under protection, Else check your class traner in a big city
---
Righteous orbs have dropped to 16-17g on firemaw
---
No problem
---
Is the improved drain life really worth it? Doesn't seem like much for 5 points
---
Because its a mac? You know windows apps dont run on mac right?
---
A friend of mine wrote a 2 line lua addon that gets rid of thr alt z and screen captured messaged, interested?
---
I thought as much. it's not a biggie as my latency isn't that bad.
---
I got all the tusks first, which took me a few hours, and then decided I needed to abandon some quests from my quest log to get some more quests at stv after I finished, and guess which quest I abandoned? The damn warrior quest.. so not only did I have to get those tusks alllll over again, I had to run back to arathi and get the quest again and come back and do it. Oh man I'm dumb. Congrats on the axe though!
---
Yeah prot just has bloodrage and shield bash
---
That was to you lol
---
&gt;how many people like playing holy paladin? And not because they're pigeonholed into the only good paladin spec, but just because they like it. Probably a lot, it's pretty popular.
---
How many spec Ret even though it's so under-tuned it's a joke, simply because they don't want to be a heal bot? Enough to show that there is significant interest in currently non-viable/suboptimal/off-meta specs.
---
The fact that they don't line up is interesting. But what's also interesting is that left and right side are different sizes. One side is a smaller resolution.
---
it's subjective, that's the thing. you need to establish with your group what is reasonable. easier to do this in broad terms, eg "all roll need on boe blue/epics, sound good?" or you could specify more or differently depending on your concern. 
---
even something that is generally accepted or "standard" is never going to be guaranteed 100%.
---
I hate you, but I *do* respect your honesty.
---
A lot of people greed out of habit even when they know someone will be needing an item.
---
Some items that drop are more worth it to sell to a vendor than DE. Or some people don’t want to sell or use the enchanting mats and would rather a quick sell to the vendor.
---
I’ve been in plenty of runs, and no enchanter has stepped up to take, DE loot, and pass it back out. Likely more common in full guild runs
---
ps: can you guys login to [battle.net](https://battle.net)? It seems to not be connecting for me
---
Fuck that dungeon
---
Just like gnome
---
100% agree on that. I constantly tell dps if they pull aggro, run to the tank. Im right next to the tank all day for that reason.  Once i interrupt a caster and start dpsing them i doubt the tank could pull aggro off anyways but its better than getting weird shit shot at you lol.
---
Make sure to visit the trainers in the capital cities. If you're returning to the first towns(goldshire, brill, Raven hill, etc) they have a level cap of skills they can train.
---
I might agree on a PvE server but even then, that just doesn't feel comfortable. Bandages having a 1min CD ensures that I don't have to put myself in free kill position for tightly packed mobs or other players.
---
it's called stance dancing coz that's a sexy name ;)
---
I think for l33t deeps, you would go from Battle stance to beserker stance and then back to battle when overpower procs. So:
---
- Battle stance
---
- Charge
---
- Rend
---
- Battle shout (if you don't have the talent points in the talent that retains rage when you change stances, use up all your rage before you change stances)
---
- Beserker stance
---
- Battle shout
---
- Slam
---
- Auto attack until OP procs
---
- OP
---
ad infinitum
---
Has anyone got a FD/Trap macro? I can't seem to find one that's working anywhere. Thanks!
---
I was in org and theres nothing
---
Ofc its a horde in Hillsbrad, fuck me if an alliance could walk peacefuly there...
---
This so much.
---
 On which lvl can you start that one
---
1.5 levels worth so 10 days in an inn.
---
After playing wow on and off since vanilla I have probably upwards of a hundred wc runs under my belt and I still get lost in there every. single. time.

I fucking hate this dungeon.

---
mints have "V" on them?
---
This takes no account for non-crit builds like drain tanking/affliction warlocks, though. If you're running one of those, I'd recommend checking out Dive's Drain Tanking guide (Google it).
---
Have 10x people looking for him and at least one will probably get him on the first reset; so it's like 4-5 mins total which isn't awful.
---
TankBuddy and Outfitter
---
Smooth Jazz playlist, Babymetal, animal crossing night sounds am 1 hour
---
1.5 levels max rested
---
So to be optimally efficient, I should play my alt every 10 days for one and a half levels?
---
But dude, Blizzard said it !
---
I am totally fine with that mentality. And prefer it tbh.
---
I can't give up my us realm char but I won't be levelling any others on that realm. 
---
I could just leave him be, but it's a war with WW and I ain't gonna level up another one XD
---
Have you done your defensive stance quest at level 10?
---
You rolled on a pvp server. It doesn’t matter what you consider fun, it matters that there is a rule set and camping lowbies, while boring and pointless, is perfectly allowed. Roll on a pve server if you don’t want to deal with this.
---
I use ClassicCodex as a “guide” to level. It does not give you any direct path, just marks where quests are available for you to attempt.
---
I was perfectly fine with 14 10 10 10 until level 44 or so, never full inventory even when looting everything
---
I've been thinking about priest too. Before classic came out, so many people talked about how they aren't good levelers out doing quests. But every time I see one out killing stuff, they are doing great. Pulling two things at a time sometimes.
---
No, wheres that? 
---
Probably the issue thanks
---
There is you need to look harder in spell book or make sure you scroll all the way down on trainer
---
Sound's like my kind of healer.  As a Warlock, I don't want to be healed unless I'm being wailed on or you have mana to spare.  If I'm not being attacked, I can manage my own health.
---
Lfg addon, text was cute in the begginning, now its just a bad system.
---
Im gonna assume from the nick this is from EU.
---
UGA ME GO DUNG GONG ME GO SM YOU FOLLO ME UGA
---
afaik, SA is only used in dungeons for threat.
---
i think the dmg component is useless and most mobs die before it's really beneficial if you are out in the world.
---
I only use SA if I'm bored as i have never seen it in a rotation levelling guide
---
I've got one, it's a handy way to avoid other warriors. 
---
Saves me dealing with your incompetence and your arrogance.
---
Also find an arch friend for free action pots do you can see the fear in the mage’s eyes when the frostbolt doesn’t slow you
---
its a massive upgrade especially if you're a warrior
---
I watched most of that, and the way energy is working now is definitely different than how it worked in that video. Never once did I see him lose an energy point, which is happening to me on average once a fight. He also never seemed to gain more than 1 energy point per fight. Where I have some fights I gain 3 to 4 energy.
---
So informative, thank you!
---
Honest question how did they get through your authenticator without access to one of your devices?
---
So what Macro are you guys using for FD/Trap?
---
Wynning!
---
yes, on wowpop it is stated:
---
 Currently we have **8,051,987 characters** in the database (seen in last two weeks: 4,171,536) 
---
plz note that this are chars and not accounts
---
Modifying game files is usually a bad idea
---
\&gt; People loved the Blood elves as Horde because they looked like Alliance
---
\&gt;Dont fix what's not broken
---
That's precisely the problem. It went from Alliance vs. Horde to Alliance vs. Blood Elves.
---
He pulls mana from his own health and also drains it from his healer! Learn his secrets!
---
Oh, that's because it's
---
Wait
---
People like you are while retail WoW’s fun sound like you’re shooting wet paper at your target with a straw.
---
Lok'tar !
---
It's very weird to me people say there is ONLY spellcleave dungeon groups because this is not what I experienced. Sure, there are many of those but I see so many guild advertisements where they promote "taking your time" and I had no trouble finding normal dungeon groups who wanted to just finish the quests. Even in SM and ZF.
---
I guess it's different if people only want to spam dungeons to level? Don't know, I completely ignored the "10man meta".
---
Also this doesn't happen at all at lvl 60, at least I've seen no such behavior of not finding groups because you're not the "right" class. 
---
Agree with the removal of LFG addon though... That's a way of playing we don't need!
---
Are you implying that I'm lying? My gold/items were gone, and my character was silenced. I'm not sure how my character got silenced, but that's what happened.
---
In Zul'Farrak they don't even have a floor, it's just sand. I don't like sand.
---
Yup its called pornhub now
---
I tried that, those guards dont give any rep
---
45, but you really need to about 55 to do most of it. Closer to 60 to finish. Or just get carried
---
I farmed all the whelp pets back in Vanilla, it took weeks to get them all.  I'm both super jealous and really happy you got them.
---
its a mana spring totem icon, not the food icon.
---
Yeah gotta keep the fights short, side note though, I generally got zero use out of my voidwalker as by 30 or 40 I could wand and out threat him with dots up.
---
I don't have proof, but I believe they had him tuned for warlock tanking *before* they shortened our dot's total span, while leaving damage the same.  This drastically increased our dps, and of course was just a low bullet on the change log (hey we just made your class viable, gonna bury this change though) side effects weren't good for leveling without ending up tanking though, so probably best to just use succubus and dream of 2.0's felguard.  That was a perfect pet.
---
First time playing a horde character for me, but I’ve mostly been ganked high level gnome mages. Everyone else around my level has been peaceful. But I also just wave at everyone who’s questing
---
I used to fly around farming the cattail herbs for fuckin hours. Really an awesome zone
---
Relax dude. People can like different things. I don't like the new gun sounds either but the old ones are also loud as fuck and annoying. 
---
All I want to do is reduce the volume by 50% and keep the same gun sound.
---
My guildies and I left Skeram for Earthfury in round 1 of the transfers and haven’t looked back.
---
On the one hand I commend you for refusing to give up on the server, but on the other hand I (and most people) am simply not willing to waste so much of the free time I have getting ganked and corpse dragging just to complete a quest.
---
It’s a real shame what’s happened to Skeram. I actually was against the guild transferring at first, but I now realize it was the right thing to do. We’re all much happier on Earthfury. The server ratio is pretty even and its population is growing every day. I recommend you transfer while you still can. Skeram is a lost cause.
---
They could....or they could just do what they're doing with retail because Classic people might hate the idea of buying expansions and diving up the community.
---
I'm a mage. I follow raid icons. I make sure sheep stay sheeped until ready. I rolled a mage like 13 years so maybe I just understand the game. DPS are just as vital as tanks. I think new people are either playing for the first time or have come BoA. I've seen bad tanks and dps. Even healers who suck. It's not a class thing. It's people who forgot how to play or learning for the first time.
---
See you in badlands
---
If goes both ways though.  If you aren't attacking skull, life's pretty hard for the tank.  Especially pallys who don't really haveaway to get aggro back.
---
I meant Q and E not A and E! Fat fingers.
---
Does an int buff (say, Arcane Intellect) make any difference to how fast you'll level up in professions - say, alchemy, or fishing? I've heard it makes a difference for learning weapon skills for melee users, so just wondering if I should keep it up on myself even when I'm fishing in a safe place or something/

OoT music. Ocarina of Time 100% speedruns on Twitch. A bunch of new people are learning the category right now so it's a very interesting time with many streamers practicing and improving daily.

---
The good side of random dungeon finder and easy dungeons is that you can be grouped with an idiot, or a 9 year old kid, or someone brand new to the game, and it usually doesn't ruin the dungeon run. Nobody talks anyway, and tanks never lose agro.
---
But when those same people try classic dungeons, bad times are ahead. There's not as much room for error.
---
Now I wouldn't suggest that they don't play, unless they are an asshole. I'm not going to gatekeep classic from a nice person messing up. But hopefully they learn.
---
What realm were you on
---
any loot that would benefit a rogue would benefit you except for melee weapons where you just want stats as a hunter
---
but if you dont enjoy instances, dont do them. i do them because i like meeting new people and i personally feel that the game is meant to be played in groups. i only did dungeons for leveling around 50+ because questing became a bit too dangerous for my warrior on a pvp server. 
---
prior to that, i did most dungeons once and a few multiple times if there was a specific weapon i wanted since a weapon upgrade was a huge improvement in my ability to quest. as a hunter, you will likely always be able to quest easily so just do what you enjoy
---

FD makes it potential more sophisticated though, in particular in AoE situations once you get explosive trap.
---
Just delete it and reinstall
---
This sounds fantastic.  My parents weren't very involved in my interests as a kid.  But I remember renting a NES from Blockbuster and my mom and I playing Legend of Zelda and drawing up maps on graft paper.  One of my happiest moments in childhood.  
---
Unfortunately, I fell into alcoholism and she has had nothing to do with me for the past couple of years although I'm in recovery.  No matter the hard times, I still cherish those moments. I hope I can recreate some of those awesome gaming moments with my daughter as she's coming of age.
---
Well, it is one GCD for what essentially amounts to 18 mp/5 (At lvl 60 with improved life tap).
---
If you are willing to be responsible for the warlock mana regen and have the spare mana to do it your way works fine.
---
However in my experience a lot of healers struggle with mana anyways, and I'd rather not put more strain on their mana pool than I have to.
---
You can stable your pet and tame another one without abandoning your plainstider. 
---
As far as dps, for leveling you can use whatever you want really, but look up how to train new abilities for your pet as they grow in level (like bite, claw, etc). Boars, turtles, and gorillas are good for tanking.
---
\*cringe\*
---
Yes usually it works out, but if the rogue ends up paying the druid not to roll you can tell the situation sucks pretty hard for him. I think the group should have respected the rogues "no please.".
---
But then again that is my opinion, you and others might have a different one.

I fucked yo my talents esrly on and went full frost but respec recently geared toward pvp and aoe

You surely mean pregananant
---
So by your logic nobody wants to play ugly horde.

So it went from 90/10 Alliance horde ratio, to closer to a 60/40 or 50/50 split

I got mine at level 43 or so.  Decided to borrow my gold to my priest friend since I have 36% movement speed already.

Let me give it to you straight. BS isn’t that good for most players. In fact it’s usually a totally wasted profession. Alch will pretty much always be good for a warrior if you have herb. If you have mining, go engineering.

Just keep doing it until you found one you enjoy. I have a 44 mage. 30 Rogue. And 22 warrior

Depends on the player. Some people are truly dedicated to that enhance PvP grind. You can’t just pass on Savage if it drops because you might never see it again. 
---
I fully support a warrior reserving it from a shaman though. It’s up to the Shaman to find the right group to get it.
---
Rogues have a skill called  distract. It turns the tatgets in the soe range to face the center of the spell. The enemy was auto walking in a straight line. The rogue made  him turn tiwards the horde town, leading him straight to the guards.
---
Make one of everything... 😂
---
I’ve basically never reached endgame in retail or classic. I always reroll. I have like 17 characters in retail over the years. Highest level is mid 60’s. 
---
Honestly just do whatever is fun for ya. Whatever you enjoy the most. 
---
I’m going for 60 here. Looking forward to trying end game out with raids and everything. Can’t wait to reroll as a mage tho I’ve been dying to. Just hit 48 today as prot warrior
---
Quick update: Daggers can be trained in either Org or Undercity so you’re in luck!
---
People usually have a main character but some are altoholics who are always switching. If you want to do endgame stuff you have to put in time on one toon and rogue isn't a bad pick for a new player. 
---
A good way to explore other classes is to get a few up to level 5 and park them in the inn outside their starting area where they can stack up to 10 days of rested xp which equals a level and a half of getting double xp for killing mobs. When you log in every day and play your main for however long also take an alt and try them out. They will level these toons up with less effort and if you find yourself playing on one after the bar turns back to purple then maybe you have found your new main.
---
Happens to a lot of us, said to myself one toon, one toon! Hit 51 on my shaman, and now have a level 10 human warrior.
---
I spend too much time healer warlocks. If you’re trying to convert my mana into yours via heals, then slow down.
---
Should I feel bad for ganking gray-level players in STV? As soon as I'm about to attack someone, I feel pangs of scumminess. I can't bring myself to start a fight with someone unless they started something first.
---
My Locks luckily Tao only in pulls. So its fine for me to heal them .
---
This. If he needs it, he can roll for it.
---
I would've guessed a milk drink from Starbucks.
---
Yea, I have a problem re rolling as well. No advice I can give you. I honestly just yell at myself and just say I’m wasting valuable time every time I do it.
---
^What ^guild ^is ^that
---
I’ve re-rolled a few times because of my friends moving to alliance. I want to play horde though. I don’t know what to do...
---
Not maybe. it's dooky tier but you're right. Sorry OP.
---
Expodisted queues for lower pop factions, yes. Server caps and limits for pops. No.
---
Hard to beat that amount of gold/hr right now in phase 1. In terms of AOE farming anyway.
---
Anything in the outdoor world isn't reliable right now, especially if you're on a high pop server.
---
I am lvl 49 now and leveled with a strider without any problems. Damage is fine and it can tank elites. 
---
If you want to keep your strider, level with it, because stable slots are expensive (except the 1st one) and get additional pets later.
---
It's about half the dps of Shadow Bolt for affliction warlocks. Once you start picking some destruction talents (Bane, Ruin etc.) Shadow Bolt really outpaces it. Shadow Bolt also scales better with spell damage.
---
The sun glaring screenshots are getting out of hand :p
---
This one is pretty cool tho!
---
honest question, do you just have obs or something always ready for moments like this, or do you record all your gameplay?
---
https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/eu.battle.net.html
---
Indeed. If the caster self buffs somehow it’s also a rather good tank. Can off tank a caster while I deal with something else. It seems npcs really hate when their buffs are removed.

I asked him how far he was to his epic mount. So didnt want me to pickpocket his gold. (Yes, I'm a Rogue, Candyskull).
---
This is my favorite part. Now just take that twisted nether, and just beat the devil out of it.
---
I think the current weapon combo is better over illusionary rod, the stat loss is small compared to the +damage gain.
---
Normally +spell damage items are better than just +stat items, however, obviously if you're talking about an item with only +2 spell damage vs an item with +30 int you know which you are choosing.
---
As a general rule of thumb when lvling base it on the level of the item.
---
I.e. your boots, they're what? Level 28ish? I'd be looking at replacing them if I had e.g. lvl 40 boots even if those lvl 40 boots were just pure stats providing the stats were high enough.
---
Put your own group together with no other warriors or shaman.
---
Simple:
---
When you JUST kill something and loot it, you're leaving behind enough money for its family to bury it. When you pickpocket it, you're saying you don't care. And thus I pickpocket everything I and everyone around me kills, because I don't care if they leave the body there to rot and be feasted upon by scavengers, to become a home for maggots and to bloat and eventually split open, to become a vector for disease that brings undue suffering upon its tribe, it along with the countless other festering bodies of its tribesmen, friends and family alike, left seeping crimson on the dusty floor in the wake of gathering 60 quillboar tusks.
---
Fortunately, this was a guildie, rarely do this with randoms :)
---
Warriors get rage from being hit and it's an important part of getting rage in prot. The shield absorbs the damage meaning the warrior does not get the rage from the hit. This means they have less rage to use of threat generators.
---
But...ww axe is a warrior class quest reward. How did you not get it \*eventually\*?
---
Nice to know, thanks for the info!
---
You could play the game just fine without any text though. Oddly the game could also work through text only, if there was interface for that and a command to move to coordinates.
---
I know on Horde side Earthfury there is a guild that raids 11am-3 or 4pm on Fridays and Saturdays.
---
&lt;Loot Goblins&gt; is the name I believe.
---
Ah, interesting. So one could decide to tame until you find the "perfect" animal.
---
very..mature.
---
Go ahead and reread that
---
I think spell power is a lot better than stats for a warlock due to life tap and pet tanks.  Maybe some people disagree, but I would just stack as much spell power gear as possible.  Your pet and fear will protect you from getting hit by NPCs, and the damage will help you kill stuff faster.
---
GON WITH THE DUNE
---
Here's an example:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/033050213520105001-05-502301103
---
There are some points that can move around. But the point is to get full 31 arms including Mortal Strike, along with 5 crit from Fury and 15 high value points for tanking in the start of protection.
---
You can do better for pure PvP (31 arms / 20 fury).
---
You can do better for pure PvE DPS (full fury builds).
---
You can do better for pure main tanking (full prot build).
---
But 31/5/15 just is super versatile and makes you very good at a lot of things in one spec. It's also the best role-swap build (tank/DPS) for raids - and every raid needs a couple of those.
---
Not sure about your items but there is an add on called extended character stats that pops up when you open your character screen to give yourself a better idea of the difference
---
I believe anything which says "Attack Power" without specifying whether it is "Melee" or "Ranged" gives both.
---
I couldn’t get out fast enough frankly. Awful place
---
&gt;You can stable your pet and tame another one without abandoning your plainstider.
---
Alright, that is very good! So he can always be on our side (far far away in a warm and comfy stable).
---
Try reading it again but slower this time.
---
Love the health bar style. What addon?
---
Engineering took me 100g to level to 260 on whitemane. I dropped skinning and picked it up. I still have mats up the wazoo left and bombs and whatnot.
---
I'm in a similar situation and I was following this guide: [Dive's Drain Tanking Guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qdUs229_XvkR1NCeTrJkybL5BDXGIh7q/view)
---
Ohhhh I get it now! I imagined shield like some kind of extra HP.
---
Good old times
---
Trolls have this issue with a lot of doors on a raptor. We lanky.
---
Good mobs to grind for a level 33 horde rogue (solo) ?
---
Raiding as arms is even better than fury if you don’t have good gear.  Should be fine.
---
Hi, /u/SalamiKitten

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d8z9jp/which_mobs_do_you_personally_find_the_mostleast/). 
---
they require more effort than other classes to keep up.
---
yes it got buffed to the value it was nerfed back in 2004 which was after the nefarion fix.
---
therefore it won't work and engineering / ungorocrystals / holywater / oil of immolation / dragonbreath chilli is your goto spell for large aoe packs
---
I'm leveling a Druid at the moment, and I'm not quite understanding why they're considered some of the quickest levelers. My current rotation at level 15 is:
---
Wrath 2x &gt; Moonfire &gt; Moonfire 2nd mob &gt; Bear form &gt; Enrage &gt; maul spam till dead
---
Is there a better rotation I should be doing? I feel like my leveling speed is significantly slower than my hunter, and that I need to take moments to heal and worry about making sure I have enough mana to shift to bear after my spell rotation frontload.
---
&gt; Savage Gladiator chest until patch 1.11 (so phase 6) gave +20 defense instead of the 2% crit.
---
Not entirely correct, it did have its stats changed over the course of vanilla though:
---
Originally 13 stam, +20 defense, +2% crit:
---
http://web.archive.org/web/20050420175118/http://wow.allakhazam.com:80/db/item.html?witem=11726
---
Later, the +def was replaced with str/agi:
---
http://web.archive.org/web/20060508233655/http://wow.allakhazam.com:80/db/item.html?witem=11726
---
I agree that it definitely changes the usefulness of the item, though maybe some people would still wear it as 2% crit is pretty nice.
---
Meanwhile I just decided the appearance of my priest.
---
I’m a level 16 elf Rogue. I currently use a Blade of Cunning Dagger (9-18 dam, 6.7 DPS) and can’t decide between dual wielding a Jambiya Dagger (7-13 dmg, 7.1 DPS) or Scimitar Sword (14-26 dmg, 8.7 DPS). I eventually want to do Sword Spec but since I’m low level which would be the better option? I have 78 silver, the Jambiya costs 23 and the Scimitar costs 38.
---
I did that for a long time, and I'm sure that's what burnt out my HD.
---
It must be high if nobody wants to play ugly horde
---
I think the drop chance is only 15% if the boss spawns. Cutting that in half is pretty significant. Looks like he thinks he can get arena runs with better odds.
---
this makes me annoyed i didnt roll a gnome warrior. level 38 druid atm :/ it might be my first alt. they look so cool.
---
Those arn't rookie numbers.
---
This is the best advice out there in general for this game.  Having a group of friends in a guild you can rely on and know for fun is great.
---
But these are srs bsns PvPers who need WotF to perform. 
---
Even when classic pvp is actually more of a competition against your own faction than the other faction.
---
Dpsing, sure, but tanking raids within the protection talents?
---
You coulda had Potatogun.
---
That may work with guild raids, but not with pug dungeons
---
At this point I'm convinced some warriors wake up in cold sweats because every one of their group doesn't consist of 4× cloth and themselves.
---
I used to make money selling minor beastslaying.  It's the cheapest enchant to make your weapons glow.
---
Also the mount speed to gloves is big seller.
---
Thank you guys. Till this point ive Not enough Hit to play fury or either weapons! :)
---
&gt; 3 huge pulls later he nearly died went off his face and party leader threatened to kick me.
---
I would have just left myself at that point. If the party lead doesnt understand the situation, fuck all of em. Reading the horror stories of mindless pugs makes me kinda happy. Testing out multiboxing, where i am the party lead, healer, tank and the mage. 
---
:)
---
I salute you, sir.
---
Looks like a very cozy place to spend time :)
---
Nugenergy classic, ZPerl, weapon swing timer, bartender 4
---
Succy and drain life
---
It's still not the same quest, even if you're horde. Blackhands breadth is from drakkis command q, starts with letter from wyrmthalak. Ony pre-q gives you the neck which acts as key.
---
Wait, really?
---
I'm currently only pickpocketing almost 20c from mobs (level 18 mobs), but do dungeon mobs (at higher levels obviously) really drop so much in their pickpocket loot?
---
Hunter leveling is just super op, especially in the low levels. Druid is just ok in comparison though it is one of the faster leveling classes.
---
When you have mana problems you need to frontload less spells, also try not pulling two mobs at once and don't switch out of bear unless you want to heal anyway. At 20 you get cat form which makes fights a bit quicker but you will have to wait until the mid 20s for all relevant cat skills.
---
The benefits of being a druid are fast movement speed which you don't have yet (get feline swiftness talent asap) and not having to drink while grinding mobs which is something hunters do better.
---
There are different pet families that can use a special ability: cats bite and can get a dash/sprint, owls/birds have screech and wolves have a howl that increases partymembers damage.
---
Pets dont auto-learn these, for example "screech rank 2" u need to tame a certain lvl bird, play with it for a bit and thn u can teach it to ur own bird.
---
Shaman isn’t bad
---
probably just lucky/unlucky crits when you're recording damage?  
---
1 agility is worth about 2.5 attack power (1 agi gives you 2 ranged AP and a % to crit).
---
btw hunters can’t roll on dal rends because it’s just a stat stick(I’m rolling on blackcrow btw it’s my bis).
---
I need it too!
---
Meanwhile I bound Shadowbolt to my mouse wheel and top DPS meters in dungeons by scrolling.
---
Succ and Imp. You've reached the point where you need to kill things quicker.
---
Wowhead says 4% on the big ones and 2% on the small ones.
---
I'm at 39 on my lock and still using VW effectively. Assuming you've fully upgraded your torment at the demon trainer, just try giving the VW 2 or 3 hits before you cast your first spell. Rotation matters a bit, don't immolate first you'll just grab aggro straight away. I use CoA then corruption then immolate (you can throw siphon life in here before the immolate if you like. Then just wand them down, you'll probably grab aggro towards the end by which point it won't matter.
---
Yes, would love ideas on paly tanking. I really enjoy tanking dungeons on a paladin. Everything I've read says it doesn't work great for raids. Best case, dps has to hold back too much.
---
Got to 45 on Skeram:Alliance before getting too annoyed with faction imbalance and made a horde on Faerlina. Since server xfers are still open, how's Alliance quality of life on Heartseeker? 
---
Thinking about xfering over and going back to my alliance character since I only have one friend on Faerlina and it's not really worth the huge evening queues but I can't stay on Skeram
---
I did Strath with a duel wield 0/31/20 tank it was easy to heal
---
I was in a similar group last night, shaman and mage were constantly pulling aggro. I kindly asked them to watch out and if they see me at 50% mana that im saving that for tank. Shaman even accused me of not healing him between pulls and i told him that we are not fighting that he can eat food. Anyway we finished the dungeon, it was a bit harder for me but mage really did start to be more carefull for whoch im thankfull to him and tank was okay i guess but man we healers get all the blame.
---
“Still, I hope you guys don't lose hope and there's stuff we excel at.”
---
There is, it’s called healing.
---
Do you have him cast torment? Have you upgraded the rank of torment?
---

So happy i Rerolled on a PVE server. Unplayable in STV
---
Higher level animals have higher level abilities you can train your main pet.
---
Every now and then I have to stable my cat and tame a couple of other animals to get new claw and bite levels.
---
They're fast because of cat form. Balance is actually well known for being generally crappy so the first 20 levels just gotta grin and suffer it
---
What fapper said below you, priests are one of the smoothest leveling experiences ever. You can literally go holy dps and heal dungeons almost to end game no problem. Shadow only shines once you get shadowform.... And even then holy dps is competing with it.
---
I can recommend this one - been using it as well (i switched to succy at level 20 and never looked at vw again as it was a lot faster - at least for me). Just make sure you invest in your wand as it is a major part of your dps until you swap to drain life in your 30s.
---
Between this quest chain and the one that starts from the ghost outside scholo I have made almost 100g as a 60 and I haven't even finished the final part of the bag quest. Can't recommend these quest chains enough.
---
This is especially effective if your hearth is set to Stormwind/Org
---
I use  
---
/stopattack  
---
/cast Freezing Trap  
---
/cast [combat] Feign Death  
---
/petstay [@pettarget, harm]  
---
/petpassive [@pettarget, harm]  
---
You have to spam it though.
---
No it doesn't bind. It would say on the item if it did.
---
The day I had to respect was painful
---
I've had ir before a few times. The only thing tbat worked was a new mouse.
---
Does a single Greater Heal not completely heal the Warlock to full? How would it drain your entire manabar?
---
I completely get why you hold the opinion about warlocks that tap during pulls (they suck) but I assume you're exaggerating about OOM'ing to heal the Lock.
---
The game is all about having fun. If you have fun by rerolling and trying to find that one combo that’ll make it to max lvl. Go for it! I just recently rerolled after putting 5 days played into a mage. Loving my enhance shammy atm
---
Then in Wrath you again use one button with a macro:
---
/castsequence reset = 5 Arcane Blast, Arcane Blast, Arcane Blast, Arcane Blast, Arcane Barrage
---
How do you drain life successfully? There's so much push back from mobs hitting you.
---
I'm not sure if this is recorded damage or purely a calculation. I'm not sure if it's from an add on but when I hover over power it has a breakdown of the ranged attack power and the DPS, I guess the DPS projection might account for crit chance too.
---
 **Perl Classic Unit Frames** i think !
---
How did you get into CoT back in vanilla?  I remember dying at the entrance and rezzing on the other side.  It was so cool to wonder what that place was going to be based on how it looked in vanilla.
---
This is basicly my character screen but the mage is 32 and everyone is 1
---
Did you end up respecing to ele or did you stay some type of enhancement? Either way glad you're finding something that works, just curious.
---
THHUUUUEEEEMMMPPP!!!!
---
I maxed a frost from vanilla to work. I rolled fire and I love it.
---
Maybe just now and maybe on high pop servers.  But previously (in vanilla ) mining and engineering went hand in hand.
---
&gt;You can fit in a shadow bolt from nightfall as well
---
Just a note - it reduces the cast time only, so it still costs a lot of mana and i hardly use it unless the mob is nearly dead so i wonder if it was worth taking.
---
Ah, just tried that rotation, it does keep aggro up a bit more than before, thank you!
---
I healed RFD with 3 warlocks today, AMA.
---
Who needs taunt when you have an AoE that can pull the entire mob pack on pull without having to generate rage.
---
That’s how it worked in vanilla.
---
People definitely do. And it’s definitely not cheap to level off the AH. At least not on whitemane.. 
---
Can’t imagine leveling from 1-240+ by buying everything off the AH.
---
Are you 6?
---
I didn't mean to imply there wasn't, of course there is.  Every spec sees play on retail because there are always people who enjoy it.  Ret is super popular even, and the suggestion is great for those people.  It's just not as great for a sizable chunk of other people, and that could be really problematic.
---
That's why % of /played is the best metric..
---
3440x1440 and 30/10 affliction/demo  .
---
Honestly it depends on your spec. But voidwalker is always a solid choice. Tanks while you dwindle away at them. It’s not the QUICKEST but it’s the most effective and consistent in all scenarios
---
Join the alliance my friend. We don't have those scum shamans :P
---
did someone say patreon?
---
for BRD in particular:
---
charge in so that you gain rage. if you start a fight without charge, make sure you have bloodrage at least to generate something to work with. 
---
lay a sunder or two down on your first target. after that, tab and hit another target with sunder/shield block/revenge (revenge if it's up which it usually is). tab and hit the third target. be ready to taunt the first target at this point as the 2 sunders were probably not enough to keep aggro if dps is focusing it. after you taunt, tab right back to the other mobs and lay some threat on them - after your taunt wears off the first mob should be dead or close to it.
---
if a rogue pulls threat, dont freak out about getting the mob off him right away - they can live for awhile with a mob hitting them and can always pop evasion if needed. 
---
try to position yourself in such a way that you can quickly see if a healer or caster pulls aggro so you can taunt (or mocking blow if taunt is down) right away. 
---
demo shout and thunder clap once if your healer is having trouble keeping up with the damage you're taking; otherwise, they're minimal threat and it's better to lay down some revenge/shield bash early on and you can demo shout later. 
---
even as fury, you shouldn't have issues with threat for groups of 4 or less. you'll always lose aggro on mobs from time to time; dps doesnt wait and/or most people have never tanked and dont understand that it can be a bit difficult, especially for newer players. speccing prot is helpful but not necessary; i would say, though, that going prot is the correct decision if you plan on solo tanking ubrs or anything higher
---
if you're doing all of that and still having issues, you may be underleveled/undergeared and those things can both be fixed. 
---
as to the feeling of constantly running around chasing mobs, that is somewhat normal in pre-60 dungeons but should mostly be avoidable by doing the above. do not spend the entire fight chasing mobs; you wont build rage and youll just make it worse. if you're doing this a lot, just tell your group upfront to run any mob they pull aggro on to you so you can taunt it (experienced players will just do that out of habit)
---
tanking is not easy and requires a lot of experimentation and practice. the first time tanking a dungeon is always difficult, too, because you don't know the mobs or pulls. but the good news is there are only a handful of dungeons left for you to experience and you will definitely improve the most in tanking from 50-60. 
---
i played a dps class in vanilla before tanking in classic and it has been a wild ride and i definitely miss being able to turn my brain off and just backstab repeatedly at times. but it's also a ton of fun smacking drakk around or tanking core hounds/molten giants/MC bosses and it all feels worth it in the end
---
Pretty sure LunaUnitFrames does this.  You'll get a bunch of other stuff from it too.
---
Different podcasts. My go to are the pff podcast, jre, jos budden podcast and any other nfl related podcasts.
---
Not quite, each type of animal has the same stats based on their level, so all cats will have 10% damage and 2% health for example, but bears will have 10% health and 2% damage. 
---
So you'd pick a bear for tanking and more of your damage would come from your arrows, but you could fight maybe another mob with ease, whereas cats and raptors do more damage but have less health.
---
Yeah, all the spells are upgraded and he is using them everytime.
---
I remember this as well but i think currently the vendor price for most loot are actually higher than most disenchant shards atm
---
yes

bob ross reference
---
I've found that as long as DPS let the pally build threat, there are no problems and you cannot peel off the pally.
---
That's exactly what they posted, though. Free boost + BFA. They deleted the post though, so we can probably forget about that.
---
Jesus, I'm waiting on a new computer to start Classic and hope to be be leveling Ally on a PvP server in Phase 2. This is giving me flashbacks. At least on K3 they had to travel back from Org after the BG.
---
Yea that's your fault bud. live and learn
---
First thing to remember is that we are fantastic Off tanks and AOE tanks due to our crazy AOE threat. 
---
We are super average Main Tanks due to us inherently taking more damage and lacking defensive cooldowns. Our single target threat can be very good, but your raid has to wait till the first consecrate is done, because you need to use judgement of crusader for long fights. It really does ramp up. 
---
Ideal situation is to have your ret pally judge crusader for you, and you to immediate judge right at the start after him. This way u ramp up the threat super fast. 
---
Holy shield is a very weird talent to be honest. It does make us slightly better at single target threat and survivability but it's really not what we excel at. 
---
Also, Argent Defender Shield is your best friend for AOE tanking.
---
Your current setup is solid. Don’t focus too much on min/maxing until above 50. Then you can work on what you really need to get the most out of your class later on. Especially as a warlock you don’t need to worry about that :)
---
it doesn't matter if you lower the settings, if you want to reduce temps you also need to cap the framerate
---
We're all playing a 15 year old game with no changes.

Eh, I think it's OK when the context is clear. If you're questing on the same mobs for instance, or if you post in lfg for something I'm making a party to.
---
Generally if you post publicly lfg or wts/b I feel like it's OK to cold invite you.

So if the current plainstrider has no abilities at all, he won't learn any new ones by just leveling uo, but only if we tame higher level animals later?

 It seems that if you would normally clip an auto shot, the game "queues" your spell until your auto shot goes off, but I can't confirm it.
---
I got my level 40 mount with skinning and cooking and grinding stranglethorn tigress for exp.  I turned all the tiger meat into jungle stew and vendored them for 60s a stack, over 3x the vendor price for tiger meat. It wasn't cool or flashy but it got the job done.  If you don't have skinning it won't be worth it.
---
I *wish*. There are rogues opening boxes for *free* because they consider a skill up to be their payment. Ain't no way I'm getting paid for that favor (but then I suppose a skill up is still worth the effort).
---
Oh I completely forgot about them, and those bugs that spawn a mini bug every second or so. As a clothie you die in a matter of seconds and without CC you can't finish any cast because of pushback
---
I can only imagine the “oh shit” moment he must have felt when he blinked into death
---
lol what a shame
---
he should straight up do more if he just casts frost bolt.
---
Healers pulling healing aggro is on the healers too. The worst thing a healer can do is panic and throw an early heal. If adds come you need to not heal right away. If I have to throw an early heal I always hit fade as the heal is landing. if a healer is pulling healing aggro 1/2 through the fight it's on the tank but usually that's not what is happening when healers pull healing aggro it's at the start or when another group is accidentally pulled.
---
im waiting for p2 because when wpvp and bgs come out, people will be making and gearing twinks, so im holding out until then as i hope they will sell for a lot more due to the increase in demand
---
Agreed, specially with all the competition on iron. I'm already seeing mithril nodes and I am nowhere near close to mining them because I've barely found any iron.
---
&gt;Honestly though, retail is a movie in witch you have to hold w for it to play.
---
I disagree. Retail is, mechanically, more difficult and requires more effort than Classic.
---
Classic is more rewarding and requires more time though.
---
Aka Skillherald
---
A lot of people are using the "drain tank" way.
---
Just search for "drain tank" on YouTube and you will find a guide.
---
Thats why we also have hellfire :P
---
I don’t bother healing locks
---
Genetics
---
I hate murlocs. Especially the casters.
---
On my warrior I like to run up to mages and say "make brain good" and other stupid sounding things until they give me intellect then I talk normal.
---
I prefer to grind caster mobs. They are faster to kill.
---
Really? Even if i do it like 10 times?
---
Once Im 60 and DS/Ruin, sure. But im not quite there yet (56)  and even when I hit 60 I plan on being SM/Ruin for a while. Its better for dungeons, barely worse for raids (by around 4.7%), and is a bit better out in the open world for PvP, especially since Im going to make some minor tweaks for curse of exhaustion.
---
And while you tanking you can summon another void, if you are demonologist
---
Druids are not bad. 
---
Healing druids are great in raids, although they're not super demanded for 5 man content due to lacking a spam rez. 
---
Tanking druids are pretty good, requiring some pricy items to really take off as tanks. The big problem being they are usually best as an offtank, and for all the work/money being put in most players aren't satisfied with only ever playing second fiddle.
---
Feral damage druids... they can work. They underperform without an activateable from gnomeragon, which takes 3-4 hours of farming per week to get enough for raiding. A lot of people don't like the idea of all that extra work being put in just to hit the damage level of a rogue who puts in mediocre effort while being equally geared.
---
It's best if we pretend boomkins don't exist.
---
~
---
Will you regret it? If you're set on tanking, druid can work for you but might be frustrating. If you're set on dps, feral is often unsatisfying due to the extra work it needs to be on par with other classes.
---
I would only say go for it if you're happy with the idea of trying the other specs but falling back to healing if you don't like the extra work they end up needing. This is not about pvp, druid pvp is a different beast that you should read guides on since im not familiar with it.
---
What exactly is spell batching? I looked it up but can only find links about Bliz implementing it. Nothing on the actual mechanic or what it does
---
I dont know how people expect you to tank when the whole party opens up half a second into your forst swing.
---
The difference between losing agro and not is 5 seconds, please just give me 5 seco ds then you can go ham.
---
Just did an hour (timed) at Level 39 at the Jaguars.  Killed 99 Jaguars.  Dropped 29 Greys /1 Green/1 Blue.  Got 77 Heavy Leather / 21 Tough Leather / 1 Heavy Hide.  Vendor price was 4 gold, 82 silver.  And it's only that high because of skinning.  You can make maybe 1-2 extra gold an hour by selling skins on the AH.
---
This still seems to be correct.
---
I put it on the healer without asking, only for healthstone i offer in chat - mostly im not asked even then.
---
Fucking priests needing on Reed, when they have better trinkets from Dire Maul in phase 2, whereas Mages are likely to be wearing the Reed well into phase 4...
---
Even though I have 2/2 nightfall, I rarely use it in general rotation because it is a big mana sink. Unless it's the last mob I need... I mainly reserve it for dungeons where shadowbolt it my main source of dps when I don't need to worry about taking dmg/regenning hp. Sometimes it has saved my ass though when I've had a nightfall proc, been so low on hp so death coil, tap, then nightfall in quick succession to kill off the mob. Those situations are always fun 😋
---
Has been elaborated extensively. You can use all relevant gnomish items as goblin engineer.
---
I see, the additional mana bars are getting jealous of the primary one again.
---
Healing is cheating
---
During the next phase that will count as a dishonorable kill and you'll lose honor. Keep that in mind!
---
it was actually decent enough that you didn‘t notice any problems, except if you wanted to get really nitpicky.
---
Hodor was the extreme case were I noticed a small problem, but with a bit of dialect, it works perfectly.
---
Doesnt mean you should do it.
---
Can only enter a given amount of instances per hour. Had multiple mages on multiple runs get locked out fishing for jed
---
I did this exact thing last night. She had to double check she had heard me correctly.
---
Please don't remind me of the egg quest in southern barrens. That quest is the stuff of nightmares.
---
I don’t heal locks if they have no aggro on them.
---
No, you don’t need every bit of that macro. But I’d keep the pet stuff
---
thats pretty smart!
---
Which Druid build is best for fast solo levelling?
---
Conor oberst and slipknot depending on mood. Lo fi stream when I’m not sure
---
Fuckin cavetrolls
---
Where do you fit in the macro where you cackle maniacally in /say?
---
Great, thanks!!
---
Haha, never though about the name showing up there. Was so focused on looking for "add friend"
---
&gt; As far as I know, with "Group Loot" enabled, quest items are a separate drop for everyone. So it shouldn't take longer than usual, but you can definitely kill mobs faster in a group.
---
You're wrong. If you have group loot, then the person whose turn it is to loot the mob gets the quest item. If they don't have the quest or have all the quest items, *then* it becomes FFA for the quest item... If they loot the mob. If they don't you're SOL and don't get the quest item.
---
Yeh but I don't pay attention sometimes so I don't use hellfire so much lol
---
Acer Predator x34?
---
I feel the same. And for that reason I seldom attack unless provoked, or to defend a fellow player.
---
Yes. It is probably meant like "0,7% of the Mobs that dropped something, also dropped this"
---
That would make sense.
---
Oh boy, just what I needed!
---
RemindMe! 8 Hours
---
It can really help when you aggro more then 1 mob. They will hit void for forever as he has lots of armor and health.
---
Battlegrounds are going to be cross realm, confirmed by devs months ago.
---
Any of the dozens of hunters that spend all day selling runs for people to get their bus ring...
---
As a mage who has never joined an aoe group (level 49 atm), I assume there would be plenty who don't want to cheese to 60. Just doing quests and dungeons once as usual, I'm not trying to skip out on all the classic experiences like apparently a lot are.
---
I’m doing skinning and tailoring. Will drop skinning for engineering when I have some money, but I intend to do mainly pvp. 
---
1 of my bank alts can disenchant my BoE’s
---
Druids are amazing questers and pretty hard to lock down a kill on in world pvp as they have some of the best mobility, a stealth, a way to heal and multiple forms of damage. You just have to know how to use em!
---
Build the high spirit gear you have -&gt; charge -&gt; battle shout -&gt; sunder armor x4-x5 -&gt; the enemy proably would be at 20%-25% - If you have high rage -&gt; finish with heroic strike. If not finish it with AA.
---
If the enemy is the same lvl as you, you would probably be at 65%-70% health, if its below 70%-80%.
---
Count at five and see how your health pool increase without need to eat.
---
Proceed to another  mob.
---
Note: Try this one mob per one mob, two mobs are a waist of time if you want to kick fast and not need to eat nor recovert with bandage
---
Oh really? I'd love a source for that. And a source for *anybody* getting banned for PvPing on roof tops. Literally every alliance have PvP'd on Orgrimmar rooftops. I've spent like 200 hours throughout tbc/wrath PvPing in the Ironforge safe spot.
---
Using shadowbolts for leveling sounds horrible mana wise. The strength of drain tanking is having precisely 0 seconds of downtime between pulls, never drinking/eating. SBs destroy mana super quickly, so I'm curious how you manage to do that without having to sit down for 10+s between pulls.
---
He does, but the laptop is probably being stupid and using the integrated one, had a Lenovo that used to do that and it was super annoying
---
(I’m in no way affiliated.)
---
Nothing dropped? I thought all mobs dropped something. :/
---
Pouty child angry cause orange man bad.
---
Was the TUF stun longer at some point? The way I remember it the proc was on DR with another one of your stuns and thus only really functioned as a random interrupt.
---
Some people just astound me. I was healing RFK the other day and there was a messy pull - no one's fault, just a bad pat timing and a runaway mob pulled the boss. I was spam healing the tank and spending extra mana only on fade and shielding myself so I could get the casts out. 
---
We didn't wipe but I ended with 0 mana and the tank had double digit hp, and our rogue was dead on the floor. I'd watched his hp slowly tick down but knew I just couldn't spare the time or mana to help. I sat to drink, apologized unprompted for not being able to save him, then started rezzing. He immediately blasted me for not giving him heals and started insulting me despite the rest of the group defending me, and then left like 10 seconds later. 
---
I put up a generic LFM message in chat, feeling a bit stunned, but then amused when the tank put his own LFM notice in the channel, including a public callout of the rogue with his name and everything. Good groups will usually have your back if one or two dps get pissy, and they're not that hard to replace in the end. ;)
---
Druids in pvp can either be the easiest targets or some of the hardest classes to kill depending on the users knowledge and skill level.
---
Both are sides of the same coin. Usually horde players are more interested in PvP and alliance players are more interested in PvE, but both sides gank when they have an unfair advantage
---
This is the guide that opened my eyes to drain tanking, incredibly well made with lots of pretty pictures to look at: [Dive's Drain Tanking Guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qdUs229_XvkR1NCeTrJkybL5BDXGIh7q/view) (NOTE: This links to a google drive pdf - I highly doubt it's malicious but hey, you should always check these things before clicking random links). Here is the reddit post from the author of the guide: [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ccxosl/dives\_drain\_tanking\_guide\_for\_warlock\_leveling\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ccxosl/dives_drain_tanking_guide_for_warlock_leveling_in/)
---
Hope that helps!
---
As an enchanter I used to ask at the start of dungeons but at this point shards are selling for less then a good amount of the drops vendor for and I'm not gonna ask after every drop since noone seems to understand how loot works with an enchanter. It's supposed to be pass if you don't need it, I'll greed, and if someone needs it they need. Now it seems everyone just rolls greed instantly.
---
Animations and damage numbers don't always align perfectly when it comes to auto attacks and instant spells.
---
I see it a lot with my shocks. The abilities go off fine, but when you see the damage numbers might be a bit wonky, and often the animations get thrown off.
---
It is an elvui issue, happened to me. I found selecting the bottom item first solved the problem. (Maybe the other way around?). Anyway I stopped using it cuz I didn’t like the look
---
60 lock here. I have yet to not top the meters in a 5man. Currently specced SM/Ruin.
---
What you can get away with is very dependent on your tank, whether you have blessing of salvation, and how stable your healer's mana is. Ideally you want to shove corruption on all of the mobs, agony on ones that will be alive for a long while, and start spamming shadowbolts at the priority target. Shadowburn whenever a mob is about to die if you have it. Toss up siphon life and immolate on bosses that won't die instantly. Try not to stay at full health so your regen isn't wasted and the healer has the option to toss a life-tappable heal on you if he has excess mana. You may need to tone things down based on the aggro situation, but you can survive okay-ish against a single elite with healthstone and life drain.
---
As far as curses go, Amplified Agony &gt; Doom (assuming the target lasts 1 minute) &gt; Agony. Use curse of recklessness on mobs that are low on health and could potentially run away to aggro another pack.
---
If your healer doesn't have mana to spare and you aren't getting breaks to drink/eat, you may need to substitute shadowbolt for life drain since shadowbolt is extremely inefficient. If you're leveling as dark pact (which you should), that helps alleviate mana concerns a fair bit by letting you effectively drink on the move.
---
AoE is pretty dangerous if you don't have a mage around. Once you pull aggro there's not much you can do. Try to only do it when necessary if you are the only AoE class, and know that you may sacrifice yourself to make it happen. Give the tank a fair while to build aggro if possible. If there IS a mage around, let him AoE first so that he pulls the threat. He has better tools to survive it than you do.
---
If you know that you'll need heavy AoE for a pull you can summon and sac a voidwalker, but that's not realistic to do all the time. Generally you barely have time to bandage, let alone spend half your mana bar and 10 seconds summoning a voidwalker.
---
Once you get ruin you'll start getting some pretty big and nasty shadowbolt crits that also increase the damage of further shadowbolts. This pulls a ton of threat so you need to use your own judgement to decide whether it's better to hold back a bit, or to go as hard as possible to kill the mob before it can rip you apart.
---
Typically I use the imp for dungeons and rarely have him attack. The buff is pretty nice. Succubus can offer some more damage (and CC if your group is having a particularly tough time), but she will often eat shit and need to be resummoned thanks to AoE/cleave, especially in level 60 dungeons. If you're specced for dark pact, make sure your imp isn't firebolting and your succubus has her autocast skills disabled so that they actually have mana for you to take.
---
Necrosis does a lot of the things you want wrt mods, but I've found the classic version to be a bit buggy. I just made my own stuff with TellMeWhen.
---
On it now, no issues for me

Most EU Realms at least have way too many players on them to even consider removing the layering at this point. Even with layering ON it is ridiculous.
---
Makes me wish the enchanting system went so far as to allow you to create your own epics or rares ( at highly inflated reagent amounts, and utilizing the most rare &amp; pain-in-The-ass mats, of course ). 
---
Even then tho, gonna be a no from me dawg.
---
Quick counter-point, in classic, there isn't a whole lot of interacting with the environment you can do while shapeshifted. Aside from herb/skin.
---
So I spend a good chunk of my time in my actual character model.

Wow so it’s always recording kinda crazy

dishonorable kill are only on low level npc townsfolk like questgivers (not sure about vendors/innkeepers)

For the most part yes they are accurate. It definitely isn't 100% accurate 100% of the time but in my experience it has been pretty damn accurate.

Even better with an unlocked mouse wheel. Spin it up, go take a dump, top dps

Sigh. I guess I'm the only rogue main with morality then.
---
Hi i am new to tanking and recently started tanking in dungeons.
---
Do you have some resources or links about tanking as a warrior?
---
I wanna know how I can max my threat and which abilities are best for my level to use my limited rage on.
---
Any resources I can read / watch to get a further understanding of tanking in the lower levels, would be highly appreciated.
---
For me I didn't really use shadowbolt too often until around 40-50, and then it became really nice for finishing enemies or quickly burning one mob down while your pet tanks another, etc. I noticed that it would generally do about the same damage as a full drain life cast, but you don't risk it being interrupted and IIRC, it's only a bit more mana than drain life is. Not playing atm tho so I'm not totally sure.
---
Also, nightfall is amazing solely for the moments when you triple proc in a dungeon and fly up the damage meters. So satisfying.

BoE epic that sells for hundreds of gold that all players need, it's really not suprising in any way.

Caps lock is something that happens, especially if they look at the keyboard while writing. Definitely a possibility

Remember, you don't have to buy every skill that pops up man. Only buy what you are actually gunna use for now. Save all the fun/gimmick skills for when you're comfortable with your gold. Icy veins even has a handy recommended skill train list!

I'm alliance on this server and me and my guild had a good laugh at all the bads transferring off because of pvp. Sure their new servers might have a better balance between factions, but its still super low pop which would make things 20 times harder to do, horde or no horde.
---
Ah, that makes sense
---
Bingo!
---
I mean yeah... A leveling guide is going to be geared 100% towards fast leveling while a PvP guide is going to be geared 100% toward strictly PvP.
---
What I'm saying is if you're still progressing through levels and planning to get 60, spec however you want on the way there. Yes some will be faster. Yes some will help you kill players easier. But it's not absolutely crucial to be on-spec for primarily leveling. People level in off specs all the time depending on how they want to get to 60.
---
Demonology for leveling a lock
---
I can't imagine that is more profitable then just grinding mobs. 4g per run max on a run that takes 30 mins to an hour. But hey if you have fun doing it that's what counts
---
if you are not a good lock you fall behind massively.  
---
the class has the potential to be top dps in 5mans if played right.

As an ele shaman, the worst mobs are
---
A. Anything that resists or is immune to nature damage. Which is basically any earth elemental.
---
B. There's an enemy in WPL called fetid zombie that has an aura that repeatedly interrupts spellcasting  within melee range, making it impossible to cast any spell with a cast time while it's smacking you. Most mobs I deal with, I basically just lightning bolt them down, throwing in a chain lightning whenever I get a clearcasting proc or elemental mastery, and meleeing them down if they're like sub-10% health, for mana reasons. But these guys force you to either super slowly melee them down or spend mana super inefficiently on shocks to bring them down.
---
At the very least he should grab 5 points in parry, 5 points in tactical mastery, and one point in anger management for tanking.  The last two I'd use no matter what I'm doing as a warrior.
---
Should not matter, I'm running it on an i3 6100 with hd530 and I get 60-70 fps with 1080p windowed full screen, but everything else is set to minimum
---
Yeah no really, you sound like both a kiddo and a cringy neckbeard rn. Idk if you are those things, you just seem to be.
---
Stick the alt in an inn for a few days and then getting to level 5 should be really easy with rested XP. Tbh it’s really quick without rested XP.
---
I don't bitch at my healer for my stupidity, so do I get a pass? Lol but yeh I guess it would be hard to see if I'm doing my tap and life drain rotation. But I usually just say don't worry about me until you don't see my health going back up on its own, cuz then I'm in trouble if that's happening mid battle. It can be hard to Guage a lock though (especially a good one vs bad one) so I don't bitch at my healers.
---
I just want a button on the mailbox interface that will open all my successful AH mail (which is just money) without taking items or money from any other mail.
---
I didn't play a warrior during Vanilla. Just check a guide or ask in general chat. There's usually some people who can give advice.
---
Just roll need because you can't make the others not roll need. People are still in "I NEED MONEY FOR MOUNT" mode and will prolly throw etiquette to the wayside from greed alone. 
---
Also, the +5 gun skill isn't -that- valuable considering how ranged attacks work. It would prolly be worth taking the quest reward and hoping some ignorant shlub doesn't realize there's a weapon just as good one dungeon away.

I think you can do it with an alt if you manage to get it in a group with your main, you'd still need a guildie to invite that alt but only once per session and they don't really have to wait. I'm not 100% sure though if you can make your offline alt party leader while it is offline, if not then it wouldn't work
---
&gt; This isn't a PvP server. It's a PvE server for the horde and a death trap for the alliance.
---
There's a vast difference between a close-to-balanced server and something like Skeram. You may as well ask why Horde on Skeram picked PvP when there's hardly anyone to fight.
---
There is a difference between being ganked (and ganking) every now and then and being ganked and camped non-stop. That is not fun PVP and why people move.

More than two mobs ? Hellfire.

About to get killed? Hellfire.

Want to look cool ? Hellfire with a party hat.

But I always consult the healers in dungeons if they're cool with that.
---
It takes a really dedicated tank to play prot Paladin. So far I've ran dungeons with a few and it was about 50-50 when it came to "done a good job and we ran without problems" and "I hope we can clear this dungeon to the end before someone rage quits because this tank is fucking clueless".
---
The lack of a range pull hurts more than the lack of taunt, especialy when the tank is hell bent on pulling by himself and won't allow anyone else to to a LOS pull.
---
I hear prat can do this
---
a lock that uses drain life in 5 man is instant kick material.  
---
those are the lock that deal less dps than wanding priests.
---
heal your locks and enjoy your fast run.  
---
a hot or a small heal is enough. its not a big deal and the payoff is huge. don't be idiots.
---
As a long-term rogue main I wholeheartedly agree with this and I wish people would scale up their expectations on rogues, goodguy rogues do exist!
---
Haven’t really had any “worst parts of leveling” while following Joana’s to lvl 54 so far.  Fucking LOVE the game!
---
I did uld yday with a 44 healer, 42 war tank, 42 rogue, 43 mage. I’m a rogue at 41. Mage and priest handled the final boss ads alone and we did the last spurt of elite mobs with the warrior in shield wall all focusing the boss. If you want to play easy mode and steam roll everything you can go to uld with a group that could be doing ZF.
---
Then I probably mixed that memory up and he just PVP'd me lol
---
This but unironically from so many people when you use Lay on Hands in PvP.

At level 28 you have rank 3 Heal, which heals around 600 hp, which is probably *most* of a Warlocks bar.

If by dps specced you mean you're not keeping your heal spells up to date to save gold, then yeah that's fair.
---
A shadow priest is fully capable of healing 5 mans fyi, there's almost no reason to play Holy whilst levelling.

I have a lot more success (read: quicker) finding any class for a specific role by doing this. I'm not rude about it usually "Hey man, any chance you would be interested in tanking/healing/running 'XYZ'?"    
---
If they don't wanna run they say "no thanks" and I respond with "No worries have a good one!" and in some cases just don't reply. I don't get butthurt by it, I'm just expediting the speed at which we find what we're after and get the run happening.
---
Don’t let this guy fool you, I was the rogue in his group and he became a total douche when we wiped on VC. The run was fine until the end when the hunter ran out of bullets which was a dumb move on his part, I know, but this guy rage quit after 2 wipes, when in reality it could have been that fact that he was only level 17 and couldn’t generate enough aggro on level 21 mobs. He also looted a chest without rolling so there’s that.
---
Regardless, to rage quit after 2 close wipes and wasting everyone’s time is a dick move.
---
Personally I really love the idea of Classic branching off into it's own thing, sort of like what Ultimate Marvel was to the main Marvel universe. That being said, such a thing is highly improbable as best, as not only would it probably take more resources than it's worth, it would also serve as competition for retail WoW. Not to mention that an expansion for Classic would be a hard sell for consumers and sort of defeats the purpose of Classic. That being said, I would love to eat my words a couple years down the line.
---
TL;DR: I absolutely love the idea in theory, but I don't think it's as great in practice.
---
Are chat channels affected by instances? For example, if you are looking at trade -city chat, would you only see the chat on your instance or all of them? The reason I'm asking is because Earthfury's Trade-city and LFG channels have had a combined 5 messages in the last 10 minutes and it seems to be completely dead.
---
Side question, I don't really understand how instances work tbh. If someone is farming mobs could you somehow join another instance that he isn't in? If this is against the rules then nvm.
---
I thought it was delay bc whitemane is west and i'm east, this lag at vendor is intended?
---
Well, obviously life tap is the primary option until you get dark pact. between Life tap, bandages, healthstones, and drain/siphon health. I can kill things ALMOST without losing any resources, so i probably drink/eat every 15-20 mobs.
---
Wow the new Shrek 5 looks kind of good
---
He ty for ur in depth reply, so u also only killed the graves and the beetles without the bosses and the other mobs at the entrance? Also how long did 1 run take you on average?
---
True story: Was doing SM Cath the other day and we were waiting on our lock to arrive he was coming from SW so I asked him if he could pick me up some water on the way and I’d pay him back.
---
So he’s taking like.. forever and then he says “there’s not really much here” 
---
“???” I reply
---
“Like no one is really selling any atm”
---
I realise he’s in the auction house searching for water..
---
“Oh nah man just from an innkeeper”
---
“Oh. Like.. any innkeeper?”
---
“Yep.”
---
 “I’m sorry I’ve never had to buy or use water before”
---

yep, I see the same, only multishot is clipping auto-shot.
---
No issues here :)
---
As a priest without holy nova, the one that spawns all those small adds really fucked me over a few times.
---
In most cases my VW and afflictions have already drained mobs down to below half before they target me at that point it's just a matter of casting a shadow bolt or finishing them off with a good wand. 
---
But you're right. The DPS is abysmal, it's a good damage sponge only for a short while.
---
What is the name of the xptracker addon? Couldn't find it by googling.
---
I'm trying auctionator and I like it. Seems pretty lightweight but really helps doing basic buying and selling - you can sort by price per item, putting something for sale will suggest you post it at a 5% undercut of the cheapest price per item, you can sell things as 'x number of y sized stacks'. Simple stuff that the app can later do.
---
that's racist
---
The "only" thing they changed to a great extent was keeping aggro, and frankly I don't cry a tear for it.
---
I'd much rather tanking be about proper focus, active mitigation, cooldown usage, positioning and encounter knowledge, rather than "am I doing enough damage compared to the dps?".
---
Does this remind anyone else of Spyro?
---
Priests are great levelers.  Not on par with hunters or locks, imo, but I have at least as smooth of an experience leveling my priest as I do leveling my druid.
---
wowhead and icy veins both have bis lists (including pre-bis and every phase)

2 minutes in this video to see what I'm talking about https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDEUxTGJX-4

makes sense because of all the nintendo themed shit (marion and luigon and linken and the gorillas drop barrels)

There is a danger that DPS pull that every time they fuck up, tho.
---
Oh so that’s why Un’goro was empty
---
As someone who has been a dedicated tank since pretty much... well, ever. Launch. Good old days, whatever you may call it.
---
It's been a bit tough to explain. So many people straight up tell me I am absolute shit for not wanting folks to AoE right off the bat or pull for me. Not had many of these players, but I've had some.
---
Had a Mage the other day that kept typing zzzzz in chat, yawning at me and whatnot. Told me I should head back to retail for not pulling the entire room worth of enemies. Healer and Paladin in the party are people I'm on discord with, and we just laughed it off and tried to calm him/her down and explain things. Mage storms off and starts mass pulling and AoE spamming as much and as hard as he/she could, before wiping, leaving the group and /w me with a "You should try playing something easier :) you're really bad as warrior"
---
What version of wow do you have? I managed to get into other regions for the battle net app but cant log into wow (version 1.13.2 31882)

Love the WoW classic community. Actually really nice people.
---
How is IF overpowered?
---
Basically just dark pact and life tap. So right now, I'd say your best bet is to just engage with enough mana/health so that you can keep a balance between them - If you're at near-full health, then life tap and drain health to regain what was used. For the most part I think wanding is still best for you, so I'd just use drain health to sustain when needed and wand/dots as your main damage source. The guide linked in this post will do a much better job at explaining it than I could lol: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ccxosl/dives_drain_tanking_guide_for_warlock_leveling_in/ For the most part though, you'll just be

I thought this was common knowledge with people who actually played pre-bc. WoW from back then can run on a toaster. All these posts asking if their 16gb ram, intel i7-9700k, nvidia 1080ti builds are good enough have really baffled me. After the 579th one I became quite annoyed.

Phone glass is cracked, digitizer is not working perfectly , didnt spellcheck last night
---
No. But it's a pretty scummy thing to do, and you deserve to be camped by a 60 (or 60s) if you push it too far.
---
Wow. Really nice to see this now when my friend hit 60 yesterday :D
---
It's the single most important leveling/solo pve spell for locks because it's all about resource efficiency. It's far from "a bad spell in general". Of course it's bad against players, because they won't just sit there and take it. Of course it's bad in dungeons, because efficiency doesn't matter when you have a healer and don't have to worry about aggro, just spam SBs. Can't do that in leveling though,
---
You can camp them until they quit if you want, the question is why would you.
---
I know it's a joke but aimed shot and arcane shot share a cooldown
---
Yes it is very clear that is the case, thanks for letting us know
---
&gt; No need to worry if you jump off a ledge ? 
---
What am I missing here?
---
classicthreatmeter does this too, changes nameplate color depending on threat.
---
Druid is such a fun class to play. Enjoy =]
---
I don't have anything to compare it to, but it feels like there are a LOT of times where my heal will finish casting when my buddy is just barely alive, a full two seconds will go by, my mana is gone, the heal never appears, and then he dies. Feels bad man.
---
5 Bud Level
---
Well no. It's not. 
---
If you run with a ret Paladin you are doing something wrong... At least when that Paladin is actually specced into ret when you run it.
---
I'd take a heal Paladin that rolls on ret gear. 
---
But I don't take ret Paladins eww
---
I'm a healer, feels unnecessary
---
I'm holding out until the 15th anniversary before I make any assumptions

I'm giving you the gift of speed you ungrateful sonofa..! So what if everyone is dazed constantly whilst in combat!
---
That moment when you realize that Alliance needs 3-4 raid groups to kill 1 faction leader 😂
---
While Horde only needs 1 raid group 😎
---
You can do boss and entire room with 3 mages and lock too.
---
Pull the room, put vw on boss and pull boss back from the ads so the mages aoe doesn’t bit boss and take aggro from vw.
---
Kill all the ads, then kill the boss.
---
Spirit all the way baby. But seriously, its all about spirit while leveling. But i would go from wc quest staff to zf staff:)
---
I did not know that, unfortunately I stopped playing during legion and have not returned to retail. If I do though, I will check that out. Thank you!
---
Great tutorial! What type of gear am I need as a lock to pull this off? Like all bus or can a decent blue set do it
---
It isn't that bad, tho. Most dungeon bosses in Classic are quite straight forward and you can always open a dungeon map in the browser. I do that every time I lead a dungeon group.
---
Hard depends on server daytime and weekday 
---
But if one side has WAY more that’s a good sign they have more players 
---
But no where near accurate in any scenario
---
&gt;Tanking is the hardest role in the game
---
Yes and no. It's the most involved role in dungeons, with the most immediate feedback/results. Healing and dps can have their own moments to shine, it's just that in the majority of runs they don't get the opportunity to do so. If things go smoothly, healers and dps can just auto-pilot through the dungeon, while the tank always has to pay attention.
---
In raids there is (at least in WoW today) a much greater importance on proper group-/spot-healing and dps meeting damage-requirements. There aren't many fights that are actually "difficult" to tank. Often it just boils down to getting enough tries under your belt. So even a very involved boss like Socrethar in HFC can become easy and boring if you're already used to handling the robot.
---
Ofc it does
---
Yeah same, I just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something before dark pact haha
---
I do tend to engage in some good ol' pvp vs the alliance, make sure to wave at me next time! ;&gt;
---
well for non healing classes then :)

This is art

I'm fairly sure it's because a bunch of guides/videos give that build as the optimal leveling build for some reason

I've seen people do this naked so as long as you are a variation of SM/RUIN, you should be fine.
---
Seems like you're describing the shift that occurred after TBC. I agree: that was good. DPS shouldn't have to worry about pulling threat from a target which a tank is actively fighting. 
---
Check out my responses to other comments if you'd like to see my complaints with post-MoP tank design.
---
Well I already do that, possibly to a better extent even, I was more just wondering if I was missing something before dark pact but I'm not 8)
---
This 100% took me a while to twig once that what the lock was doing every pull I thought he was taking damage as he was standing up with the tank 😑
---
Did it as a fresh 60, it’s easy as long as you know how to manage distance

Going to Dustwallow Marsh at lvl 26 was worth it..

Had a ZF run with the tank who was lv.44 and barely held on aggro since his taunt kept missing. Not sure if it was his first ZF run but he kept charging blindly in to group of 3 or more mobs; even when we only had 4 people since 1 player dc'ed. We almost wiped and the rogue said need more DPS.
---
So I said that I had to hold off my DPS to not aggro mobs since our tank could not generate enough threat. And to my surprise, the rogue said I should not hold off because healer can heal me. FYI, I am a mage.
---
I could leave at that time, but I decided to finish the run then simply ignore that fking rogue.
---
That extremely inaccurate. Daily I add 25-75 auctions. Many add no auction.
---
It's a hint of population, a week or so in earthshaker had 2k auctions and now almost 10k so more players used the second and third FCT but numbers is impossible

To be fair, shadow tap (I can't remember ability names, shadow tap is the one that taps your health for mana right?) and then for your next fight, after applying DoTs, use drain life to add another 'DoT' whilst also replenishing health.
---
this is what most of the "pvpers" don't understand.  
---
you can trashtalk the underdog faction all you want. fact is you are playing PvP on easy mode, void of any challenge.  
---
you aren't good at the game. you are... just more.
---
let the other faction recover or face long term issues.  
---
you are only harming yourself in the long run.
---
Since you will probably be a PVPer as a sp you should go with engineering
---
I’m not sure if you ever experienced life on a PvP realm as the woefully outnumbered faction, but I wouldn’t wish it on anyone.
---
I engage in world PvP frequently and love it. Always have. But what was happening on Skeram was not PvP, it was genocide. I literally could not quest in STV; Horde constantly camped the Nesingwary expedition (usually 10-15 people, a couple of them 40+) and it wasn’t even possible to turn in or accept new quests from them.
---
I got camped in a cave in Hillsbrad for about 45 minutes by about 20 Horde before giving up on the quest there. My rez timer was so long I had to spirit rez and leave the zone entirely.
---
A guildie was attempting to make his way from Booty Bay up to northern STV and was camped by a group of 5 Horde players the entire way. He logged in that morning to get a couple things done before work, and had to just log off because of an entire group of Horde camping him.
---
Any time I found myself questing in a contested zone I would be swarmed by Horde players. They never fight you 1v1, they always wait until your health and/or mana are low, or until you engage a mob, and if you do manage to nearly kill one of them, they run while another Horde comes along to finish you off.
---
Anywhere that is a focal point for both factions becomes a dead zone for the minority faction. Scarlet Monastery was a massive shitshow, Horde would stand outside and kill any Alliance who came near, and camp you all the way into the dungeon. Blackfathom Deeps was just as awful, though less popular as a dungeon so less discussed. Ashenvale was impossible to quest in as well; Astranaar was basically Splintertree 2.0. Wetlands was constantly overflowing with high-level Horde traveling to Badlands and beyond, and level 20-30 players questing in the zone would find themselves helplessly trampled by mounted droves of enemy players. Stromgarde was an absolute shitshow and took me and my friend about 2-3 hours to complete. I never got beyond these zones while still on Skeram, but from what I’ve heard, zones such as Tanaris, the Plaguelands and Searing Gorge are essentially impossible to quest in as well. Blackrock Mountain is the site of constant Horde camping, and the only safety is to corpse drag into the dungeon.
---
And Honorable Kills don’t even exist yet. There’s no reward for killing opposing faction players. I’m not saying PvP shouldn’t be happening; all I’m saying is, what I’ve described above is simply *not* a fun experience. To be on the receiving end of it is just frustrating and miserable, and it can completely ruin your gaming experience.
---
On Earthfury, conversely, almost none of the above happens. Of course PvP still takes place (I spent 30 minutes last night on my 49 hunter killing a 42 priest and 42 warrior ganking lowbies in the Wetlands, for instance). But it’s two-sided. Horde hits us, and we can hit back. It’s not a massacre - both sides can strike just as hard at the other. A couple days ago in Maraudon a 5-man Horde group tried to gank my group. We killed every single one of them without losing a single one of us, while fighting a pair of elites. It was a blast, and we all had a good laugh. They tried later to mess with us and we killed the mage while the rest of the group got away. Fun times. 
---
That sort of 5v5 action where both sides have a relatively equal chance of success is what world PvP is all about. Sometimes you’re on the winning side, sometimes not. But at least you stood a chance. At least you had some say in your fate. On Skeram, Alliance have no say. It’s downright awful.
---
If you don’t believe me, go make an Alliance toon there, level up to ~30ish, and start questing somewhere like, say, STV. Good luck.
---
Thank you very much!
---
I'm saving your post to check out the strategy when I get back from work. Is drain tanking possible at level 35?
---
Horde skeram lol
---
This is why you level your bank alt to 5. With level 1 Enchanting you can disenchant everything in Classic. Though that will cost you the gold from selling the items obviously and you don't get any good enchants at that low level. If you can use them a level 5 toon can also get Blacksmithing and make coarse sharpening/weight stones.
---
/krisseykun Did you know there's an island south of Tanaris that's only reachable if you are doing the AQ opening quest chain. You will get a masssive swim speed boost, so you can reach it before fatigue kills you.
---
dont know for channels, but for the layering :   
---
there is around 5-10 layer per server depending on how much people are logged on, when you log you are put in a layer where you can only see people that are inside your layer and there is an instance of each mob / ressource / item of the map on each layer.
---
when someone invite you to his group after like 3-5 seconds you move to his layer if it's not the same than your own (there is a limitation of a swap every 15 min at the moment)
---
This layering have been announced by blizzard moderators as temporary and only until Phase 2
---
Espacially when you are horde arms dps is viable because of wf totem
---
That’s an annoyingly funny way to say “tank lfg wc”. Barrens chat never disappoints.
---
Oh god, I can't count how many times I've had impatient dps run ahead of me (tank) to pull mobs because I was waiting for the oom healer to drink.
---
To all priests: you can shield a paladin tank unlike the other 2 tanks.

---
Got a patch of a few minutes this morning, anyone that know what's new ?
---
To be honest with you, we could have done this with one aswell but we overestimated their fighting spirit. The horde didnt put up much of a fight. I saw low lvls defending while 60s just watched the slaugter. Thats "lok'tar ogar" I guess :)
---
You’re using it wrong. It doesn’t tank, it cc’s one of the 3 mobs you should be pulling.
---
Life tap is what it's called. Tapping is good, but using SBs on more than one mob will leave you pretty close to oom, so to get to near full mana you'd have to tap all of your life away, at which point you'd need to drain for quite a while to get back up, which would leave you near oom again, and so on.
---
You can save posts you know :)
---
I haven't played retail in years but it seems like it would be cool to add each race as a reputation faction that you can declare war on or make friends with. Maybe make some items that require rep and anti rep with other races.
---
I'm having problems as well, bnet won't update.
---
Succubus and Draintank build is definitely the best way to level. 
---
Leveling with Voidwalker without trying to pull aggro slows down time to kill quite dramatically.
---
The sacrifice is very strong
---
Half of this couldn’t be more wrong to the point that I’m not going to dissect it too much. Don’t follow this. Go to the fight club discord and read the FAQs for leveling. Here’s just a few examples of awful advice:
---
* Refers to thunderclap as if it’s ever good. No, you should never try to “keep thunderclap up,” I don’t care what level the mob is. Don’t use it. Just don’t. It has terrible rage efficiency. If you need to kill a difficult elite or higher-leveled mob, rend and kite with hamstring. Even if you’re tanking a dungeon, don’t use it. The threat it generates is terrible. 
---
* Mentions white hit cap. White hit cap isn’t something you should be thinking about. Don’t take hit past the yellow cap. Doing so is inefficient. 
---
* Uses dual-wielding’s level 20 requirement to justify arms. YES, go arms, but dual-wielding’s level requirement is completely irrelevant. You NEVER want to dual wield while you are leveling. The hit penalty is too costly. 
---
* Sleeps on sunder armor. Sunder armor spam (to specific thresholds of remaining health, as covered by the FAQs I mention above) is literally the best possible tactic after the pull until you have whirlwind. Even then, there’s a period of time where it rises back to top priority again after training a specific rank. 
---
* Mentions using rend after the opener. Never use rend unless the mob is going to live through the full 15 seconds. 
---
* Fails to mention pooling rage. A fundamental part of the solo warrior’s leveling flow is pooling rage on a single target pull and then dumping rage on a multi-target pull. 
---
* Mentions *icyveins* without vomiting. Do not under any circumstances use builds from icy veins. It is complete trash. Wowhead is a *bit* better, but still not ideal. 
---
* Recommends execute as a finisher. Don’t execute while you are leveling. Just don’t. That rage is 100x better pooled for the next pull. 
---
* claims that the single target rotation (in which, as I mentioned, you should be **pooling rage** for the next pull) involves changing stances. No. You do not change to defensive stance and force yourself to blow your pooled rage in order to charge or open on the next pull. 
---
I’m tired. Go to the Fight Club discord and read the FAQs. 
---
(Side note: If you have a question, check the pins. If you still have a question, search. Someone is going to (justifiably) ignore you or respond rudely if you ask a question—about something like leveling rotations, builds, weapon progression, hit cap/weapon skill, or fury-prot tanking—that clearly indicates you haven’t looked for the answer yourself. This happens daily and people tend to react pretty strongly to it.)
---
No, e.g. jujus don't work like that.
---
I want to level fast instead of making friendships that may not last as they quit the game or whatever.
---
I need gold, so should need on all BoPs too, as I can vendor them for 2-3g and finally buy my bis boe?
---
What is the gold value threshold, above which everyone needs and who sets it?
---
Warrior checking in here. 
---
I want to tank at 60 (55+ maybe) and am looking for some resources. As I have been leveling (currently 40) I’ve been tanking some. Seem to have fine success tanking with a 2H (threat wise, switch to 1H plus shield on high damage mobs once I have threat) but struggle with 1H tanking (holding threat) in dungeons. 
---
I feel like I’m doing something wrong and am looking to improve. Are there any warrior tanking resources out there that look at this? I have watching a lot of skarms videos and I’m not looking for BiS list or talent trees, more of a clear breakdown of which abilities generate the most threat and how to hold it. 
---
Thanks I’m advance!
---
Damn, dont remember that all but thanks for the info!
---
Do you hate any of them the most or is your hate spread evenly among them?
---
The chance can be slightly lower because only kills the drop loot are used in the statistic.
---
Keep in mind that it can take a long time to a 0.7% drop, you need 300-400 kills have a 90-95% chance of the item dropping once. You could have 20 people kill each killing 400 mobs and there would be one of them not getting the item, sometimes you are that person.

It's my favourite also, my IGN is shaiapouf, wish i got Pitou lol.

Shielding works perfect before a pull. Yes retribution aura doesn't tick but we still have consecrate.

You do realize that content for multiple sized raids are already a thing right? Also, tune down the asshole tone, thanks

Nobody in the history of WoW have been banned for PvPing on a roof mate, there has probably been over 20 million unique players over the years and none of them have been banned. Nearly all of them have PvPd on roofs. You're dumb as shit if you legit thought you could get banned for PvPing 😂 "Every single player had a stroke of luck and slipped through!!"
---
Also, I've seen both of those screen shots. Neither of them even mention banning, or even temporary suspension. And both of them are in Gadgetzan, where you have to wall-jump to get up. You can literally just walk up the Orgrimmar roof - no wall jumping required. They added stealthing troll guards on top of the roofs in 2006.
---
It's not rouge

Yep, that's my rotation! ^^
---
gotta take it out for a spin in PvP as well
---
so why is there addons to see the amount of exp given depending on your level and the quest level ?
---
Besides that i need faster solution. I’m only 41 lvl and have just honored rep to all factions.
---
I used to be merciful but time has hardened me, now all alliance must die.

Found the guy who thinks dual wield tanking is a meme because asmongold does a real hack-job imitation of it

Shit damage and it takes forever, smooth sure. But not as fast as anyone else
---
Just an FYI on the final part of the quest, you don't have to help Taelen at all, except for the group of 5 elites that will patrol to him. At the end when he fights some named guy, you can either stand up on the hill and watch things go down, or you can help but you will die. When you die, DON'T RELEASE. The event looks like it's over but it isnt. Just whatever you do, don't be me.... don't release. You have to do the whole stupid quest over if you do, when it could have completed when you were dead. After it completes, release and run back to your body &amp; you turn it in right there.
---
I encourage everyone to group up for this quest. Taelen RP walks and fights literally everything. He can only be escorted by one group every 15 or so minutes. Don't be that guy that just takes the quest solo, and then dies to the group of 5 elites as soon as you get beyond the gates. Group up,  it helps you and the people around you.
---
I had one guy try to ninja the escort from my group, after we asked if he wanted an invite several times. When he failed, we suddenly got spammed whispered for an invite, which we did anyway, but it was too late. He claimed he wasn't trying to steal it, but said that he should have and will next time. Don't be that guy.
---
Good luck on this quest,  it's definitely worth it!
---
We welcome you alliance players on dragonfang alli side.

I can confirm you can reach it without the speed boost, you just have to die a couple times lmao. I haven't tried it yet in classic but I did manage to do it back during WotLK
---
Although 10k gold right now is about 8k Rl. I think someone’s just fuckin around
---
I get your point if it's a kind of even situation. On the other hand, i was jumped by a four level higher mage while killing spiders in searing gorge yesterday. I'm not complaining about it being unfair, but it was a bit frustrating seeing a druid riding right through me without throwing a heal or doing anything to help.
---
Not worthwhile anymore due to melee leeway. This unfortunately didn’t make it over from private servers.

I am lvl 38 with 224 alchemy.

Transmute: Arcanite is 275, I don't think I can reach that without spending more gold than I hope to earn with Transmute :o

This has been my best experience with tanks in spell aoe groups! Also looking toward brd arena runs, it’s still useful to have a tank of the group wants boss fights

Shamans supposedly becoming paladins has always ruined the beauty of this idea for me.

FAILED ATTEMPT
---
I only got to max level in Cata - before cata I never got far because I got bored leveling.   Classic now has been a lot of fun - and I think it has a lot to do with the pacing and difficulty of quests.
---
"Collect 12 Raptor feathers"
---
The roller coaster starts here - seems simple but then you don't get your first feather until your fourth or fifth kill.  You get a feeling like you're going to be stuck here all day.  Then you get 3 in a row and you're on top of the world - you fall into a pattern - pull kill repeat maybe drink - you learn how many abilities you can use on the Raptors and sustain mana for the next one.  One bad pull happens and you're fighting for your life against three at once but you pull through with some cooldowns and a HP pot you looted earlier and suddenly you're at 11/12 feathers - you feel actually accomplished as you pluck the last feather from the corpse and open up your quest log to find the next adventure.
---
It’s not PvP and I don’t understand why people do it.
---
Whenever I find myself in a situation in the world where I’m surrounded by fellow Alliance and the Horde next to us are completely outnumbered, we leave them alone. There’s just no point, the outcome is already determined.
---
Now of course, when Phase 2 hits this will likely change, but for now there’s a relative truce.
---
What’s interesting is that on Earthfury (where I transferred from a Skeram) I’ve done quests in areas like the Hinterlands that take me to the coast where it’s almost completely Horde-dominated and they leave me alone. I think because they know there’s a relative truce on the server because everyone came here to be able to have a breather and just play the game. This will change soon, but for now I think it’s somewhat necessary and healthy even on a PvP server.
---
That being said, in certain situations I’ll still break said truce, and I have (and Horde have also done so to me) on several occasions. It’s still a PvP server after all.
---
I agree, if you see my rule 1, and 3 referencing back to rule 1. Then that's a situation where it's okay to interfere :)
---
Either my luck has run out completely, or my luck is up and I should try to get the green one and the crimson one aswell.

This. Their toolkit, as it stands on retail, could never work within Classic. They would need to be watered down to the point that they may not give the already established "DH feel". If a new class MUST be added, it would need to be something completely new. 
---
I really don't think it's necessary though. While everyone claims "classic is easy", there aren't that many players out there that have truly mastered their class to the point where they're flawless.
---
Altarac Mountains not Arathi Highlands! Sorry everyone!
---
What a stupid comment. Has nothing to do with whatever you have in your little mind

Basically im confused are attack power and ranged attack power different? Am I just giving myself a melee boost by going Attack Power over Agility? Do I only want Ranged Attack Power?

Such dedication in role play. 10/10.

Big nope right there.

Honestly most efficient is probably even. Usually I’ll tap to 1/2 &amp; 1/2 then use both at once for 1/2 the downtime. Definitely appreciate a mage giving out food though, usually there just used to water spam.
---
60's don't get HK's from low levels, you'll only see a slight increase in pvp with ppl your level, plus, there will be less people in leveling zones. Wouldn't worry too much about leveling in ph2.

he is wrong.

Not really man. For one I just off heal anyways and just kind of hybrid dps heal.

It’s classic man that’s kinda the wonderful thing, you can play how you want :)

Now for raids at 60? Yeah rn I’ll roll healer most likely but eventually even ret pallys will be goin into MC lol

Bookmarking this for when I hit 60. Thanks!

From the article I just read agility is the way to go. 1 agi = 2 ranged attack power for hunters and 1 melee attack power for hunters as well as a small percentage of crit icy veins sais 53 agility is 1 percent crit. It also said that agility unlike attack power will scale with buffs like Kings so when buffed if your agility specced you’ll have much more ranged attack power. They said spec dependent atk power could be viable but agility should always be the go to. Any items that sais attack power and doesn’t specify ranged or melee will automatically add that attack power to both. But from what I’m reading I’d stick with agility pieces of at all possible. They also have a stat breakdown on the website.

You see this same mentality in fotm rerolls. You see this same mentality in maining top teirs in fighting games. You see this mentality  everywhere in vodeo games theese days. A lot of the time because one guy said so. By all means play spell cleave if youre having fun. People just need to understand that stacking three mages isnt the only viable way to play. The conflation of optimal and viable is the issue I take. Not anything else.
---
Youre right my b.
---
In a raid you should be using consumables to keep you from ever running out of Mana between demonic runes and Mana potions it's extremely difficult to go oom if playing correctly imo. That being said I still take the stats over 2 sp.

Aquatic form is only as fast as walking on land. Doubt it would be fast enough

When I was a kid I first got WoW but couldn't play for a few weeks due to dial-up internet. I would sit at the computer and watch the login screen for hours just imagining the land that existed in those hills behind the portal.

Please tell me the conversion rate is 1 xp = 1 gold.

Dude I'm not supporting layering. I want it gone too. The thing is layering was a requirement to have a smooth launch. All you're doing here is attacking people trying to educate you you fucking mongoloid. Lol you are trash. And have a small pp

Realm transfers only escalate A-H ratios on both realms. If you offer transfer from Horde-dominated realm to Alliance-dominated realm, Horde players will not proceed with the transfer. People rather queue to paradise than gain easy access to hell. 
---
Bad ratios bring out the worst aspects of world PvP and I find it surprising that Blizzard never got around solving this key problem in sophisticated manner. Having an Overwatch game 5 vs 6 is unthinkable and they engineer elaborate solutions against leavers, replacing quickplay players etc, yet A-H imbalance they just give up on and say it can't be fixed. 
---
This is technically #nochange so don't count on Blizzard even wanting to do anything about it. Personally I rolled RP realm this time around.
---
Let's add dynamic respawning to classic.. you're a fucking lunatic retard.
---
Please explain why they would lie. Explain to me why they would add leeway if it's not in the reference client. What do they gain ?
---
Did it 5 times yesterday :D first time I released, second time he died to patrol then I died once. On e it bugged and father didnt come.
---
5th try I completed it but I couldnt choose reward because UI bugged so I had to restart game. Thanks god I was able to complete it. I would go insane doing it 6th time.
---
Noo I know, I'm glad people are willing to do that. I just couldn't lol.
---
same as before tbh.
---
Really depends on your preference. If X is best but you loathe X then it's not going to be the best for you.
---
imo, you should just mix it all up: Quest, grind mobs whilst questing, grind specific mobs for loot/gold, grind dungeons.
---
Specifically, if you have a good guild group, dungeons would probably be the best
---
He needs 2 dps and 1 healer. He is looking for 3 more ppl, it is not only a tank.

I find it important to be able to heal yourself or even others with bandages to save mana.

Yo Triiviium, mind sharing what Cpu and gpu you have ?

Personally I like to set the void on one mob, dot it up, then dot and fear another.

At least it’s a screenshot and not a phone picture.

Wow, Imverysmall is my guildmate!
---
Does this make you spawn outside the instance?
---
More people saying "I only play spell cleave because its the fastest." Quickly turning into "anyone running a group other than spell cleave is a fucking idiot and ill put them on ignore"
---
You are close enough to start thinking more about your gear. If you are looking for certain drops from the arena runs then you should do them even if you don't get much xp because you'll need them anyways. 
---
Are you planning on getting Argent Dawn rep for the shoulder enchants at least? If so get the trinket and you can farm scourgestones (don't turn in until revered) and get rep out in the Plaguelands until you get honored. Don't do the quests until revered  either.
---
It is, isn't it? Imagine, even a lower spec device like Nintendo Switch is doing it.
---
Well.. I'd assume ranged attack power affects ranged attacks more than attack power right? Even if attack power affects ranged, which it does.

Some people like Pineapple on Pizza, some don't, and some want to tell the others that they are wrong.
---
It doesn't matter which one you are, let's just move on from the circlejerk aight?
---
Wrong. Super wrong.  
---
    
---
Attack Power on gear applies to both melee and ranged. There are a couple weird interactions with consumables and other buffs where they only apply melee attack power despite not specifying melee.  
---
Hunters get 2 RAP (Ranged Attack Power) per agility, as well as 1 melee attack power and some melee and ranged crit, as well as a little dodge/armor. At 60 you gain 1% crit per \~53 agility.  
---
You do the math u/ogctoastyhorse
---
What I mean is. Compared to MC, BWL is massively harder and AQ40 is a sudden ramp up in difficulty once again. So sure, you can lay down Ragnaros with a random group of green blue people. Good luck progressing through AQ40 without gearing and playing the specc meta though.
---
OK sure dude, I won't give you any free heals because it spends my precious mana. You're right.
---
Every single one thats around lvl 50+ since the xp from questrewards is converted into gold. Questing through the entirety of wpl and epl after hitting 60 gave me about 300-400 gold total in roughly 2-3 days of occasionally questing when I wasnt currently in a dungeon, I wouldnt have gotten my epic mount yet if it wasnt for that as almost all other ways of farming for gold right now seem extremely inefficient.
---
In fact I would recommend everyone to only do their last levels starting at around 50 in dungeonfarms, even if you arent an aoe class and it might be a little slower, just because questing after 60 is a really good way of making money (and you're gonna have to run those dungeons a shitton anyway later).
---
Dark Iron dwarves in Gnomer.
---
Can confirm. Friend does this for money. Sets it to master loot and the money is only paid when the ring drops. Then its traded for the gold. Safe way to get it.
---
As a druid when i see that i usually use Entangling roots on them with faerie fire debuff and sit with some popcorn. :P

Who the hell uses num lock these days?
---
Eh, you can't enforce rules onto others. Sometimes you get into PvP and it will be a 1v1; be happy at that. Sometimes it won't be just a 1v1; be happy at that, too. 
---
My personal 'code' as it were, is if the guy on my side is in danger of losing, I'll help. If they're winning, I won't. Nobody likes a corpse run.
---
Right, got it. I’ll get the addon then. Thanks!
---
For layering, i doubt it.
---
e.g. in city chat, ask for an invite and if the person is in another layer, you - or them - get matched to the same one.
---
If chat channels were affected, then you would all be on the same layer.
---
Not sure what you mean by instances...if you are in a group, you will be matched/moved to be in the same layer.
---
Why wouldnt it be? 
---
And why would they create more work for themselves by adding leeway if it didnt exist on the reference client?
---
Time is money, friend!
---
&gt; due to us inherently taking more damage and lacking defensive cooldowns
---
That means they are the worst tank, not "super average"
---
13 years ago when I played Vanilla I never managed to get a char to 60. Highest I got was a priest to 54 however kept finding different classes I wanted to try around 40-50 which back then wasn't an issue. I rolled a Rogue on Classic with the 1 goal of getting to 60 and play end game. I am 42 with my mount and haven't even thought about re rolling.
---
Don't be the 14 year old me!
---
We're so getting Kara.
---
It was for a little kid, but he wasn't related to the devs.
---
The whole damn classic that blizz released is broken. it's like playing classic lite version of what classic actually was. Really disappointed that a private server can get it more right than a billion dollar company can.
---
Honor is for mudhut-dwelling losers, victory for the Alliance is all that matters.
---
Ony and mc attunements are definitely doable I would say. Depending on profession farming timbermaw rep in Winterspring could be efficient. 16 slot bag quest chain from fallen hero/blasted lands.
---
I just set HS to Karg 1 day before MC raid. Rest of the week it's Grom'gol
---
Umm, that is hilarious because Bullcosby is in my guild lol
---
Sulfuras server?
---
&gt; Not enough mages have leveled
---
I think we're playing a different game.
---
You're correct about that, druids do have a lot of tricks up our sleeves. I mainly get ranked by rogues. For awhile I was having issues with them. Now that I have feral faerie fire I immediately toss FF on the rogue. Once I do that they take off. They're a pain to run down and rather just let him be and continue questing or whatever I was doing.
---
I wish they didn't take off. I really do want to fight you. When a rogue catches me off guard while I'm fighting mobs I lose a lot. But I want to fight you! Haven't really had the opportunity to see if I can take on a rogue while I'm not fighting like 3 mobs on me.
---
What is the conversion rate?
---
This is news to me!
---
Mate, what part of 'SCARLET MONASTERY' did you not get?   
---
Mr. Panter is obviously doing Scarlet Monastery whether you like it or not...
---
As a healer, having first aid is important to keep mana regen at full capacity between fights. Instead of popping hots, a quick bandage will keep your group moving.
---
Does gnomish cloaking device drop mob aggro like vanish in classic? Does any engineer know that has used it? Does it work in combat?
---
I am on Gandling too, any estimate on the ratio? I was thinking about transferring to a more balanced server,
---
I also forgot to mention, I'm tailoring and enchanting
---
Broke4lyfeee
---
If u block it still goes off.
---
Level 1-45 is the same amount of XP as 45-60.
---
Why would they create more work for themselves by adding leeway if it didnt exist on the reference client?
---
Expect the PvP situation to get a lot worse for the minority faction in Phase 2 when the honor system comes out but not the BGs so the only way to rank up will be farming honor through world PVP.
---
Idk why everyone’s knocking the voidwalker. If you get jumped, a voidwalker sac that basically doubles your health and gives you knockback protection is the ultimate life saver.
---
My guild transfered from Firemaw to Earthshaker a few days ago. Balance feels rly good, maybe slightly horde favored. Pugging can be a bit slow, due to the lower pop tho. AH is a bit empty when it comes to World boe's too
---
Yeah. I feel like the shoulder and helm collectively are 90% drop. Ive only ever seen ravager twice and never the pants.
---
How do you see his exact hp? I always get a green bar and can never see if I am able to kill an alliance or not due to it q:
---
Not an expert for mages but talent wise it looks like the stuff I would do aswell
---
Depends what you’re going for. Seems like a decent build for “I want to heal, but can spot-dps if needed”
---
Mostly vanish. Otherwise evasion and it's just a sap pull and the tank picks em up.
---
My main is currently a level 45 hunter, max professions, mount, Broken Tooth tamed...and I'm considering rerolling. I do enjoy hunter, but the more I think about it, the more I want to play a melee character. Further to the point, I find myself yearning to play Shaman (my original vanilla toon, and one of my favorite classes in retail). So i decided I'd start up a Shaman alt..problem is I play alliance on a pvp server with my hunter..so I'll have to reroll on a different server, at level 1, with no gold/bags/anything. This damn game...lol
---
Yes this! as someone who doesn't have access to a working CC with subscription, and i buy gametime, i would love to see this on the classic tab.
---
tbh, i hate pvp, i still rolled on a pvp server
---
if you are on a pvp server, there's no reason to feel scummy since the person should have known to expect that.
---
If you spent 12 hours in a row killing the same person...sure, feel scummy. If it's a one-off, t-bag the bastard and carry-on.
---
Between those 2 extremes...vary your feeling of scumminess as necessary i spose
---
If u compare single target vs the other two tanks then probably yes. But remember there's other mechanics too at play. Paladins can work on Nefarian because they won't ever be put into berserker stance.
---
I think people have disproven this in the comments of the tweet. Have no idea why you’d lie about being banned though...
---
Yeah, at 28 I have 205 first aid almost got Mageweave Bandage but not Mageweave to make use of...
---
Hi friend, me also as well too thanks much love xoxo
---
If you're not playing in ultrawide, what's even the point? Omen X35 here.
---
I mean I don't think he's wrong in the sense that no dungeon absolutely 100% requires sap. But yes generally CC is a good thing and makes life easier when used in dungeons.
---
Also got my first epic drop Taran Icebreaker in Un'Goro, 14 years ago.
---
Meanwhile I payed 10k runecloth to *not* have to use the epic wolf lol
---
I had this lock in my UBRS group last night who told the mage that he had plenty of water. I as a healer did not see him drink even once during the dungeon. :|
---
I lost out on Illusionary Rod after my guildie rolled a 3 against my 1 lmao
---
Start with a pally tank if you want. And yes tank rotation is a weak spot we have.
---
i'm sure there are better ways, but when I hit 40 earlier today and needed some extra gold I went to desolace and swam around opening up the shellfish traps by Shadowprey dock. Collecting the shellfish can get you some decent money for relatively little work (5 shellfish for 55s from the quest "fish in a bucket"), and if you're lucky you might even get some big iron fishing rods which are going for around 1g on my server! Now it helps that I'm a druid so I can breath underwater for free... but it shouldn't be too bad regardless. You can do it!
---
Addons. Duh. Numbers is not implemented in game, and the addons also needs to do a bit of guesswork until enough kills has been had.
---
Haha brilliant! Welcome to the server! 
---
I’m not actually northern Eu, and neither is my guild (we’re predominantly Welsh and Irish). If you’re alliance and would like an up and coming friendly guild, drop me a DM :D
---
/wave
---
And a good /pat if theyre a gnome or dorf.
---
That's why I stopped disenchanting Items at about level 30. You usually are better off vendoring the items and buying mats from the AH.
---
Farm Scarlet Monastery, you can move from Graveyard to Library to Armory to Cathedral as you get higher level, can easily get to 40 just doing that.
---
I thought I was going insane. You cheap shot, your HP drops, a hit registers on scrolling combat text, but doesn't show up in the combat log. I couldn't figure out what the hell was happening.
---
The most sound solution sounds like you should stay Alliance; play with your friends. Then when they're offline, you can scratch that Horde each with a different server! :D
---
Y c lot words wen few word do tric
---
What the hell would you be doing the quests for if not? It's how it's always been in every bloody MMO that has ever existed.
---
DUNEGON
---
But leeway applies both ways, so in my opinion shouldn't it still be worthwhile when pooling rage at the tail end of a fight?
---
Azeroth Auto Pilot
---
Do you have 3-5 hours to devout to grinding out a gathering profession? That's probably what it would take to get you to 150-200. So whether that means it's to much of an investment to switch is really up to you. But as a fellow tailor enchanter I can tell you your not gonna make any money on enchanting for a very long time.
---
The conversion rate is 1 exp to 6 copper.  
---
1.000 exp becomes 60 silver  
---
10.000 exp becomes 6 gold
---
I recommend saving all of Western and Eastern Plaguelands until you hit 60; lots of quests for gold and you're also close to two of the instances people want to farm from 58-60 for gear.
---
Perhaps you should, you know, FINISH the questline?
---
But do blocks happen with a bubble?
---
But worgen he could do?
---
You make 10g an hour farming Basilisks if you're at a low pop server and/or doing it at odd times. Or 5-10g an hour just farming SM if you fancy that more (As a group).
---
There are many ways to farm gold. Its all up for debate
---
can you show me a spec that I can use for this drain tanking build? i found dive's guide but I just want the spec tree
---
Half our pre raid bis comes from BRD, which you can start farming at level 50 depending on your group. You also need BRD for the attunement quests to Molten Core (quest starts in Blackrock Mountain from the guy near BRD entrance, Lothos Riftwalker) and Onyxia's Lair (if you're alliance, the quest starts in Burning Steppes with Dragonkin menace and has you going into BRD several times).
---
The other half of our pre raid bis is split out over LBRS (doable at \~55), UBRS (10 man raid, doable at \~58, needed for Ony attunement), Scholomance and Strat both sides.
---
If you've done the attunement quest, you can also start raiding Molten Core at 55. I can't speak for everyone but we did it with 34 people last weekend and even had some non-60 guildies with us. Any warm body is better than an empty spot, really.
---
As for the actual items, I like using [sixtyupgrades.com](https://sixtyupgrades.com) rather than a static bis list because a) it also shows you runner ups and how much worse they are objectively (good for hard to obtain items like the Briarwood Reed or Freezing Band) and b) you can feed it your own stat weights, obtained through a sim tool of your choice (I use a spreadsheet, Frostbolt dps is really easy to sim). It also shows you which boss in which dungeon each particular item drops from once you've selected a bis set.
---
Sure works untill like ZF
---
After that this wont work and dungeon mobs start to hit hard
---
did you just post to brag about how a no lifer you are? i'm confused. this is subreddit content?
---
There's so many bad 2h tanks out now that people talk about it so much. When you get a good one it's great, but when you get a bad one it's terrible.
---
after i got to 60 i sometimes go to STV and ask if anyone want someone murdered for 1 gold, i get a surprisingly large amount of whispers, dont really make much money of it but its fun
---
I'm just sad that the mana returned is so pathetic, 150 mana per gcd is fucking awful (level 50 atm).
---
Theres absolutely no reason for dps to hold back their dps because the tank is using a shield, warrior tanks with shields are easily capable of keeping threath on up to 2-3 mobs (depending on their skill and spec) just as well. If one of the dps is really doing so crazy much dmg that hes gonna pull aggro off the tanks main target, then he is going to do that anyway irrelevant of wether the tank is using a 2h. 
---
And if the tank is actually specced prot he will do just as much if not more TPS with a shield than an arms/fury specced warrior is doing when tanking with a 2h or dual wielding, because they just dont have the gear yet to actually pull that off. If a warrior had close to full prebis dps gear and would tank with that or similar gear for the best possible tps instead of mitigation, he would take more than twice the dmg of a prot-specced plate-wearing warrior.
---
I didn't blacklist them for a loot dispute I blacklisted them because 6 of them kept fucking with me and whispering me and harrassing me and when I contacted a guild officer they told me I can just ignore them cause they won't do anything about it. So now I won't party with any member of that guild, so that's 1 less tank they can play with and my whole guild also won't party with them so that's another 60 players that won't party with anyone in their guild. This is classic, reputation matters.
---
U sound like a boomer that clicks to cast spells. Good on them for not being stuck with you.
---
I am lvl 41 with 47 gold.
---
Not making it either
---
I really wish I played EQ.  My uncle wouldn’t let me play on his account and I understand why (now).  10 year old me was so disappointed.
---
how come?
---
I'm interested in maining a warlock but I've heard the class's weakest ability is low mobility, are their engineering items that can make up for that? That boost movement speed?
---
I heard this comment.
---
Nope.
---
Sure, you can start moving in a productive direction as a mob is about to die, but there’s no reason to spend rage on hamstring to do so. The mob is going to hit you 1-2 times as you hamstring and run out of its range anyways. Save the rage.
---
Hahahaha 🤣
---
 "Orc sees you camping in the forest and she's like owo what's this?" 
---
Literally pulled that straight from the description.
---
Mine too
---
it's not me.
---
You mean the five hour version, since somebody will undoubtedly fuck up at the Guzzler
---
You don't get extra gold from quests at max level in classic. You just waste xp
---
50-60 is pretty great, yeah. Before that I feel there's a constant struggle of "oh dear, all quests in this area are suddenly orange to red, guess I'll move on", which slowly stops being a thing during the last 10 levels, simply by virtue of, well, there not being that many levels above you anymore.
---
Did you only white DPS / wand phase 1?
---
someone in my guild
---
When people are given the option to transfer, they will transfer to servers that benefit themselves.  People don't want balanced PvP, they want a massacre.
---
Notice how in after years of allowing transfers, servers are basically either 90% horde or alliance.  Now everything is cross-realmed and phased so it doesn't matter anymore.  But classic no longer has that fix and will see the same pattern eventually.
---
The grass is always greener... 
---
I have the same problem. Literally going to make a Warlock in a moment. 
---
For me, I get annoyed with something about the class, or if I don't, it's not very viable (how I want to run it). And unlike retail, I'm really interested in raiding, which causes problems.
---
Perhaps.  I relaunched and it was fine, so I'm thinking given I'd queued originally it was some buggy thing my end.
---
Everyone should level first aid it will make a difference. You don't have to level it right now it's easy to level at 60 and really not that expensive but you should do it eventually. I would do it asap tho because you will out skill cloth types and at that point you can use em to make bandages
---
And if you add any dedicated GPU to that (seriously, any), you can easily bump your FPS to 60 on low.
---
Raiding is another topic, you may even need a better CPU there (since handling 40 player characters in one small place needs a bit of speed to handle timely)
---
Sad
---
I’m on this server aswell do you by chance know the faction ratio?
---
Nah. 5 mans are way easy. If you’re kicking someone for using drain life in a five man then I don’t what to tell you.
---
Go buy a lotto ticket!
---
whats the point of vw when you tank everything yourself?
---
If you have skinning or cooking the Steeljaw Snappers along the shore of Tanaris are 42-43 so a good mob for you to grind.
---
Find a humanoid spawn you can grind for a LVL or two. Should max be 2 levels below you. Beasts are great too but I find humanoids to go down quicker and the cloth drops are pretty neat
---
This kind of grind can be really boring so find some good music or watch a movie while doing it  :)
---
The definition of griefing isn't something that's against the rules. Griefing just means annoying or trolling other players. It's a blanket term that can be applied in many ways.
---
im in the same exact boat, rogue main that always alt'd mage or something else. got my rouge from 1-42, made a mage 1-20 then decided to try lock for the first time in my life and now i have a 22 lock, 20 mage, and 42 rogue.. help! i want world pvp dominance, flashy plays, and being able to 1v2 1v3 outplay which class is for me
---
Thanks! The quests in those areas must be worthy a hefty chunk of XP each.
---
You convinced me to buy silk bags now
---
Wow. 100% Those two items are supposed to play off of each other. Gotta be.
---
1) I follow a similar rule, but I go by the zone levels, not by 3 levels. If it's a 20 to 30 zone, they're 22 and I'm 28, I'll kill them. Why? Because they knew the dangers of the zone when they set foot in it.
---
2) If I'm out and about pvping, I'll kill someone twice. Once because I like to scrap, and twice to prove the first kill wasn't a fluke. After that I've proved my point and I'll leave them alone unless they start attacking me.
---
3) To your main point, I'll definitely interfere in  1 v 1's, because I don't know who started it. I don't know if it's a new gank, old gank, bad blood, whatever. I just see MY faction vs OTHER faction, and I want to make sure MY faction wins.
---
That said, if I'm in the distance and I see a clear duel start, I'll wait to see how it's going. If my faction is going to win, I'll let them handle it on their own. If they're going to lose, I like to let the opposing faction player get to the point that they've proved they'll win, and then I kill them. In other words, the results of the duel are known to both parties, but I make sure my faction player, my ally, doesn't have his questing interrupted. Because if my allies can't depend on me to be there when they're about to die, what's the point in even having factions?

Yep Goblin Engineers can make Rocket Boots

couldnt anyone with knowledge just steal this addon and update it? guess the original author wouldnt mind since he abandoned it years ago... 
---
Man I wish I had knowledge of LUA stuff.
---
&gt;There are a lot of bad druids.
---
I'm one of them, but I'm learning. Getting better at tanking every dungeon and am pretty good at healing right now. 
---
PvP is okay. I die sometimes by going oom because of a lot of shapeshifting. I still need to learn a lot. But it's my favorite class. You can basically do everything. Though you're not the best at anything, you're also not the worst at anything. But I'm also not trying to be the best at dps or anything. I'm just trying to beat my fellow druids by doing the best I can.
---
Nah. 5 mans are way easy. If you’re kicking someone for using drain life in a five man then I don’t what to tell ya.
---
What did you just call me?
---
As a rogue, I bought mine from a lvl 60 priest who boosted it. Before that I did 10 Princess runs where on the last try I lost the roll 95 against 95 so I decided that it is time to get that damn ring and 25g I paid was worth every penny.
---
I know my brother has it out to sacrifice, then again we duo level and I keep aggro on a very gankfiesta-style server, Gehennas. Maybe it changes once we pass 50,dpnt expect it as he is deep affliction
---
Until the guild is created the guild name is not registered. Whoever gets the number of signatures with the name first gets it.
---
Recently did my exalted grind to get a raptor instead of a wolf as my epic mount. 
---
If you're a class that can farm devilsaurs that was by far the best way to make money solo (getting real crowded the last couple of days). I had some 120g-130g hours at devilsaurs, even higher if you value the devilsaur leathers at what they're worth after I made them into gauntlets or leggings. 
---
Add to that that I got some semi-passive money from buying mats and making devilsaur gear when I couldn't farm it myself (like when going to dungeons etc). 
---
The "hardest" part was getting all the runecloth lol. 
---
I had like 1100g when I started buying the runecloth, and when I finally had hit exalted I had over 1300g despite buying 700g worth of runecloth along the way.
---
At least it's not druids rolling on DPS or tanking gear. That's a major yikes.
---
STV RFD then ZF
---
Oh boy! Wait until you hear what she says in the new cinematic!
---
Confirmed. I used twitch for it too and works perfectly.

---
1 agi is indeed 2 ranged attack power, so the 10 agi equals to 20 ranged attack power (and 10 melee attack power)
---
The 30 attack power item gives 30 attack power both to range and melee.
---
However 10 agi also gives 20 armor I think and increased chance to dodge, which shouldn't be relevant tho until you start PvPing.
---
Agi also increases crit chance, 53 agility is 1% crit at lvl 60. On earlier levels you need less agi per % crit, I couldn't find any info on the exact number tho.
---
Anyway, the blue piece with 30 attack power is superior in this case.
---
Even if there is meta, it really doesn't affect what you want to do because there is always like minded people you can do stuff with.
---
Sus of Incendius?
---
If so, I've seen you around. Super nice gesture!!
---
my guildies does it for free, they call themself the STV Police
---
Imp for dungeons. Void for soloing. Suc for drain tanking builds or when CC is needed. Felhunter PvP or when dispel/counter spell is needed.
---
&gt;completely stop you from playing and there is nothing you can do about it
---
While it would be inconvenient, there are some things you can do:
---
\- Organize help from zone chat, guild, friends or whatever world pvp chat your server may or may not have. It could turn into a mass battle!
---
\- Res at spirit healer and switch to a different zone. You always have at least 3 options for any given level range, so just move somewhere else.
---
I'm not firm to speak on Blizzard's policy regarding griefing, but I would assume that camping lower level players still falls under "normal hazards on a PvP server".
---
Change the login screen music D: HERESY!!!!
---
There is a botton on your keyboard. I says "print screen", push it down. The picture will be in your wow folder 😁

Our eternal slumber was interrupted and we're fucking annoyed about it.

For real... just re-fear, healthstone, bandage and take that mob down.

Save yourself 10% durability and soulstone cooldown.

I'm using an addon called Real Mob Health. :)

Here's to hoping they fix split pulling too.  
---
The aoe threat to every non-combatant bystander shouldn't exist in the world.
---
&gt;I dont really have the time to try and fit into groups as a dps, but as a tank I can make my own, thenever I want, it makes the game much more enjoyable for me.
---
What makes druids also a lot of fun is that I see LFM and can fit into whatever group. You need tank? BEAR TANK! You need a dps? CAT DPS! You need a healer? HOTS and HEALING TOUCH ALL THE WAY!
---
Druids issue is tanking raid bosses specifically as you have no reliable way to avoid crushing blows as well as critical strikes, at which point you turn into a fat healing sponge. 
---
Their upside is threat gen as mentioned, and they can deck themselves in resistance gear without losing out as much as a warrior would in most cases
---
If you want an indepth explanation, check out my comment I did when I finished my exalted grind

---
I gotta say, I haven't really had a level that wasn't fun until I got concussive shot at 6 or 8, and each level has been more fun than the preceding one thus far.
---
Generally, I like higher levels much more because having more tools makes questing more fun in general. 
---
I'm two levels from getting a fantastic 3.1 speed crossbow and Aimed Shot, so time really flies now.

Almost all of my kills have been by nightelf Druids

You’re not a clicker.
---
Your a mage so farming all of the essences shouldn't be that difficult. I farmed 12 essence of fires as a warlock in about 6 hours and it will be much faster for mages, air is even faster with dampen magic aoe farming. If you are going to buy all the mats it will be expensive as fuck so don't do that.
---
If you are planning on grinding Argent Dawn rep for the shoulder enchants don't do those quests until you are Revered. Instead get a trinket and equip it and grind Scourge in the Plaguelands because you can rep up just from that until you are Honored. Don't turn in the scourgestones until later either.
---
Deep feral, some balance and 5 points in Resto for Furor or Improved MotW.

I enjoyed kotor's stories but I really wish they would make another Star Wars MMO that's a bit more MMO based rather than story bassed.

We had some guy in group who said his flightmaster in Orgrimmar was killed so he couldnt get to us. When he got in group and changed layer flightmaster came back. I think layering was the issue why you didnt see many hordes..

It's a feature with Geforece Experience.

I have mine set to capture the last 30 seconds when I hit the keyboard shortcut.
---
You assume i can do math. Thats a lot of variables but thanks for the info
---
You can cast some spells on the move, but in raids your main spells are hard cast meaning you are a turret caster. This means your movement affects your dps and some boss fights require a lot of movement. Good players know where to stand and when to move to maximize their dps.
---
Bloodfang is awesome, faction balance feels extremely equal. Most people are not 60 yet though, so you might have to wait a bit longer for 60 dungeon groups than on your old server.
---
Moved from gehennas 3 days ago and loving it. That server was just too huge for my taste, bloodfang feels more like real vanilla with a big, but not oversized community.
---
Yes?
---
Hmm.  Not sure if it's placebo then but when I've tried face tanking mobs it's been a lot less efficient HP wise than dropping a hamstring when they're on about 50% and then kiting towards the next mob.  Can usually pool around 50 rage for the next mob this way so I dunno if I'm just playing wrong.
---
Dude, I'm in EU, playing on EU server, and you live in East Bay Area judging by your comments.
---
This is disappointing.
---
I love fair duels and I can get plenty of them just outside IF. It's the general chaos and unfairness of wpvp that allows for the odd situations and cool plays.
---
Not trying to change your mind though; why should what you think be relevant to anyone else? You have a code. Fine, live by it. And let everyone else play the game the way they enjoy it.
---
same. still down here.
---
And for that you need a rock solid healer raiding core to be able to dip to 30% premeditated without dying.
---
iI wish that you never play on onesided realm.
---
Found [this site](https://macrohub.io/macros) while reading through comments on another post earlier today and have found it quite helpful. It isn't the most extensive list but it has quite a few useful macros on it, sorted by class, and just by reading through them has definitely helped me better understand some more of the nuances of macro writing. I'm hardly a pro, but I'm better now than I was yesterday thanks to this!
---
Thanks, there's a lot of nuances I never knew about even back during vanilla.
---
Thank you for the heads up.
---
oof so tough to choose lol. As far as i know this seems correct but i hear both sides
---
I imagine they can't strike at the nobles anymore so in their delusion they do the only thing that can "harm them" in the long run.
---
I'm certain this is a reference to the Donkey Kong Country 3 disco caves. 
---
Un'goro is basically a giant tribute to Nintendo and this cave is probably no exception.
---
Locks, we need to support our healers! Eat or drink whenever you're not slowing down the party! If you're tapping in a fight and you know your healer is taxed, USE A BANDAGE! Lifetap is an amazing tool about 75% of the time. Don't let the other 25% turn the entire utility into an annoyance that your group would rather just not deal with.
---
Considering the current amount of people who intend to stay Ret after 60, I’d sell it ASAP before they realize their spec is absolutely useless at 60 and reroll/quit.
---
What mod do you use to track your dot timers on the bottom like that?
---
&gt; I would say u have to find that class/race/faction that u just feel good with
---
It's easy for non altoholics to say this, but the reality for us is that we feel good with a class for a while, then a different one feels good, and a different one and so on.

I have more than enough good buttons on my keyboard around WASD plus shift, alt, ctrl modifiers. I use my mouse for mobility. One side button for auto run, one side button for mount, middle button for quick mobility like travel form or ghost wolf.
---
Immolate is also good to cast first because it deals some upfront damage that can help tag mobs if you're in a crowded area
---
This is really great to know. It’s been a long time since I’ve had to farm a dungeon just for an item without xp.
---
Lol I actually play horde-side on Skeram and I've noticed how bad it is for alliance. Didn't realize people were starting to leave because of it though. Feelsbadman.
---
Sweet farm bro!
---
So I'm a 52 Priest, just respecced shadow, kinda deep shadow. Up to 60 I wanna heal in dungs and solo shit with shadow. Will I still be able to heal?
---
And how will it be when I hit 60? My main focus is gonna be PvP when that content comes out, but I still wanna heal dungs and raids. Will I have to respecc like everyday, or is there a "hybrid-spec?"
---
I've definitely run into plenty of shadow immune or extremely shadow resistant mobs. Golem-type enemies are immune to drain/siphon life and drain soul. You also can't put curses on the 7 in BRD. And we both get fucked by the magic immune skeletons in scholo and the chromatic dragonkin in UBRS.
---
It's really hard to keep aggro on everything as a leveling warrior, especially if you arent specced into prot talents.  
---
Keep in mind you have 3 different taunts, the regular taunt that you use while tanking, Mocking Blow which you need to change into Battle Stance to use aswell as Challenging Shout which is an AoE taunt.  
---
The #1 thing which will help you the most in being able to keep agro on everything is putting raid markers on the mobs before you pull them to signal to the DPS which order they should kill them in, most people will recognize that Skull should be killed first, and X should be the 2nd target to kill.  
---
If you mark the mobs before each pull and your DPS actually follows the kill order its much easier to keep threat.
---
I've been listening to the mayan factor, warflower. For 4 months straight.
---
Nice to have a hunter weigh in. What lvl are you?
---
Dungeon damage at low to mid level just depends on the gear you have at the time

Single target I reckon you should be topping the dps

I'm 48 rn and well geared due to my ah addictions and my dps is a great deal higher than my mates that I play with

The Dwarf priest reached full enlightenment and ascended to Nirvana
---
bro I like your build but why don't you go further into demonology for a better VW or better Succubus? Getting master summoner would allow you to sac and quickly get out another VW or succ. wouldn't that be better for PvP?
---
I was wondering if you could make a build that's better suited for wpvp as you level from 20 to 60.
---
not really, since you can then abuse the layers to farm rares and their loot tables.
---
Should come back automatically after a few days
---
I was just thinking I'm not sure AD rep rewards are in game yet. 
---
But yeah, something to ponder. When you get past level 50 it's time to start working on your path to end game gear. A lot of stuff you can get started on before you get to 60.
---
same here, rushed tailoring to 255 so it doesn’t require mageweave anymore, then capped first aid only using like 40 runecloths. It’s more efficient this way.
---
Why wait to be lvl 60

If you are willing to invest even more time, yes. But the more something becomes meta the less likely it is to find likeminded people.
---
A meta is always embraced by a majority, or else it would not be a meta. 
---
Idk about you but I dont feel like looking more than 1 hour for a group for a dungeon just because I dont wanna follow the meta.
---
Cell reception is considerably different over sea then land.

30 days it is

Exacly! Thats why people link the petopia website, it shows what tameable creatures carry an ability (that you can transfer to your other pets) and what petfamilies can carry certain abilities. So in case of the Tallstrider (bad base-stats, but your choice) ur SO has, petopia says it can learn: Bite, Cower, Growl and Dash. If you click on Bite you can see what mobs carry the different ranks of bite so u can tame them and transfer it to your pet.
---
Usually the most popular pets are cats (fast attackspeed is good in pvp to interrupt casters, most damage output), for raiding you switch to wolf (for howl ability, or the serpent for range attacks if the boss does aoe-damage and kills ur pet) AND for solo/leveling people prefer birds/owls (tanky and good melee aoe abilities).
---
Usually u can judge the hunter by the pet and know what kind of player u're dealing with! If they tame 'brokentooth' at 37 (Rare spawn cat, highest attackspeed ingame together with a lvl 60 Bat) you know you got a tryhard min-maxxer! If they carry a Turtle, Tallstrider or Crocodile you shouldnt expect much damage.
---
This said, if she really really want a Tallstrider, atleast get 'Strider Clutchmother', a lvl 20 rare one with a unique look!
---
Worst thing about this and other city raids are the layering. you only attacking one layer players and leaders. Its cool and all but you dont really even see all people who are defending. like some other post said about SW att that most of alliance who was at SW didnt even know that there is attack. Layering sucks :/
---
Kill quests are generelly regarded as good quests. Since if you are not questing you are most likely grinding. So why not take along the bonus xp of kill quests?
---
&gt; Picking a tank for visuals over racials is pretty casual.

Mabey in high end pve content ret is not so great (still viable but not great) but in pvp its actually realy good.

Dude. Seriously make them al alchemist and get transmute going. You will be so rich.
---
They are as mind numbingly easy as retail normal dungeons. You dont need any cc and you can pull half the instance on accident and still be fine. The only big diffrence is, that the downtimes after a pull are longer in classic
---
I was actually wondering if I don't plan to minmax my warrior much, if Destiny or Brain Hacker are okayish for 2H fury. Anyone know or have personal experience?
---
So the chinese gold farmer stereotype exists for a reason, who would’ve thought! Glad you got it sorted though.
---
A) Its a PVP server, they knew what they were signing up for since no one is forced to do world PVP in this game.
---
B) Its more than possible they’d do the same to you in the reverse scenario - how many times have you been ganked by higher level/multiple players?
---
I think what people fail to realise is world pvp isn’t about fair, honourable duels where both combatants start off on equal ground - that’s what arena is for. But rather it’s about scummy,  cheap surprise attacks, mind controlling players off boats, fear/sapping them to steal the chest or resource they were just about to loot/harvest or simply killing every player you see in your trajectory in revenge for the the scars and PTSD you bear from being repeatedly ganked in the Yeti cave.
---
I’d think you were a bit sad if you spent hours corpse camping the same low level gnome who clearly stands no chance, but besides that anything goes. Empathy is for PVE servers homie, but hey if you only take a defensive approach to world pvp (ie only attack when attacked, or helping someone being ganked) then that’s your prerogative too. Just don’t be surprised if other enemy players don’t reciprocate that sentiment.

I'm alliance on Thalnos which was [Ally 37% vs 63% Horde according to the last wowhead census](https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community#click-here-to-see-all-us-data). If the percentages don't impress you: that's *twenty two thousand* extra horde players! (out of a 82678 total population).
---
It's very frustrating. Sure, horde get ganked too, but for every gank they get, I get eight. I don't mind being outnumbered, maybe 45% vs 55%, but that Thalnos shit is too extreme to bear.
---
I stoped playing altogether until I find a more balanced server.

Any exp reward you would get is turned into gold at 60, epl and wpl quests give 4-6g each
---
Just to clear this up. Succubus is good for leveling  but, Say you need to solo something,you would use vw and use your dots to bounce the target back and forth.So if your like me and doing quests 2 or 3 levels over my level. The suc would do ok but would die rather quickly if the mobs level is too high.  Also if you have more than one mob attacking.  The suc would be overwhelmed pretty quickly. with the vw random mobs can be kept off you while you fear juggle your main target and you can slowly pull mobs off the vw.
---
You have easy zepp access to Org, cause UC takes ages to enter if you don't get there via portal or flight.
---
Well that is if it wasn't a buggy mess. Perhaps half of the time it does nothing for me, especially if I move or turn the camera before activating it. Feign + trap also doesn't work for me, not even with macros.
---
I’m a new warrior tank, are there any tips of AoE threat? Because I know the demo/battle shout methods don’t work, do I just tab-cycle sunder armour/revenge while taunting anything that breaks from the pack?
---
I don’t want to straight up blame high/AoE dps if i’m missing something.
---
Do some Uldaman or RFD and you're good to go.
---
Ranged Attack Power is basically just a type of Attack Power.  It's on some items in order to stipulate they are for meant Hunters.
---
AoE threat with bombs without it costing mana, which is one of the reasons a paladin tank doesn't work anyway.
---
Yes, but how does Storm Strike increase your healing?
---
Ill explain it to you ingame.   
---
Razorgore EU, 29.09. 3am before the Gnomeregan entrance (the actual entrance, not the dungeon).
---
I first rolled need 1 on a dagger with strength on my arms warrior. My friend rogue said lol and greed.
---
You’re trading 0,2 crit chance for 10 Ap. It’s a tough call. I’d say theyre equally good, leaning towards the 30 attack power-ones.
---
Attack power versus crit varies depending on your own gear. Crit becomes better the better attack power you have in overall since it just amplifies what you already have by double.
---
100% crit and zero damage is still zero damage.
---
Hunters should always value crit high since they have mortal shots-talent. But this early on, attack power boost is more reliable.
---
Reroll
---
To be honest I was one of the advocates of spell batching for its important role in PvP (which was still relevant long aftet Vanilla btw, as you can still see Hydra use it in his WotLK PvP videos with the SW:D trick). 
---
Nobody could have foreseen that it would be so broken on Classic, considering that PServers with 100x times less ressources than Blizzard managed to implement it successfully without any issues regarding, be it, Feign Death. Now I don’t really know what I should think of it, as the downsides are obvious. Even buying food by stacks has a delay on Classic ...
---
\*brain struggles to comprehend the person\*
---
use the item restoration webpage.
---
So has a KOS list feature, it's pretty nice. You can even set the reason for it, like if someone camped you, or they were killing quests NPCs, spitters, a whole bunch of categories. It's cool because you can better know what kind of vengeance you're bringing and maybe find the kind of person you have a bloodlust for but don't remember the exact culprits.
---
&gt; Still, I hope you guys don't lose hope and there's stuff we excel at.
---
Like, healing and buffing?
---
I never thought about it but WoW has a very convenient way of despawning corpses. If it were realistic, undertaker would be the #1 profession in wow.
---
you'll get it back in 29 days.
---
gg, you must register a new blizzard account and pay another month fee. /s
---
Id also like to apologize for uploading the original instead of the one i cropped for posting. Thanks everyone for weighing in
---
Bloodfang was one of the medium realms from the above list when I was checking last night. Very tempted to move here.
---
The only issue is the Debuff slot limit.  
---
Due to this its not feasible to apply Mortal Strike on Bosses, because any other debuff is better.  
---
in MC and for Ony this wont cause issues.....
---
Starting from BWL, Arms is not in favour anymore, because you will lack DPS, for some bosses.  
---
Then its best to have your +8%/+9% hit gear ,and Dual wield gear ready and respec to Fury
---
This is the only thing I hate about the phased release schedule, no reason this shouldn't be in the game now is there?
---
1. Tank mobs
---
2. ???
---
3. Profit
---
Lol, our guild is almost all NEs as that where they started recruiting from. It's actually really amusing.
---
Can't you just talk to the guy again?  Or was that a later change?
---
Dude why so agressive?
---
Pretty sure that one was just bugged. My group would pull 1 grub, then a dozen more would aggro from all around the area.
---
or run scholo/strat until you have enough rep for the blue one. (not sure if white trinket is needed)
---
The proper way for a warlock to tap in a dung is to use food not water.      Tap to zero then eat.     Let them know this.  If they aren't doing it it's wasting time
---
i am still missing 14 gold and i just hit lvl 42. shouldn't have bought so many skill upgrades lately. :(
---
you can just talk to the guy and ask for another one.
---
Arms tanking Raids is not possible btw.  
---
Atleast not without gear.. , so let a Prot warrior do this job for you :D
---
Nope, just Dutch
---
My problem is that some of those warriors think they can keep doing that forever and ever and ever. At least that’s my experience.
---
One of the easiest things to do back then - it was a simple jump on some sort of pillar.
---
He means rare to see in the wild. I personally rarely see them compared to the other mounts
---
In Retail yes, we’re in Mirage Raceway on classic
---
&gt; \#treason**gate**
---
Literally.
---
Uh yes it is..
---
Kinky demon sex, read "Everybody loves large chests" for details.
---
Personally I don't touch any quests in PL until 60. Just farm rep and dungeons until you can't get rep from grinding. Then do quests and turn-ins.
---
Tradeskillmaster does this and is the most useful addon i use. Automatik ah scans - defining groups of items to auto send to different characters and simple stuff like tracking which chat has how much of an item
---
I also havent healed since WotLK (also healer pala) and was thinking on healing on my also 21 priest haha.
---
I had the same luck 2 weeks ago, was farming them for like 2 levels and then i lootet finally one of them and like 10mins later the same whelp(same spawn position) dropped another one. Got me 25g and one for me.
---
My god I never knew that ! It makes sense... I'll do that know  !
---
To be fair, it's not the horde players fault, it's blizzard's.
---
Seems like a reasonable and heartfelt response. Sucks you got scammed though
---
Arcane Shot barely scales at all, so should always be taking Aimed Shot.
---
Okie ty. I think this is the most straightforward and rational answer im going to get. God knows it wont be long before im swapping it for another dilemma
---
Wiping because you tried to rush takes longer than pulling efficiently, also healer has to use all of its mana pots to keep the dps alive and the tank has to pay double or triple the repair costs. These things almost never happen in non-rush groups.
---
I actually DID notice RELATIVELY newer games having a new rule of despawning corpses. Back when I played the original doom games (some of the very first video games I ever played, not including my MSX games), the corpses NEVER despawned, so playing video games where they did was actually disappointing.
---
I'm only at level 27 and been ganked just three times. All in HB foothills. 1 mage, 1 pally and 1 rogue.
---
As a warrior, the mage was impossible to kill. They just kite you round and round till you dead. The pally had me when I was almost dead and was level ? so not much of a chance there either. The rogue was 4 levels above me, but Rogue against Warrior is not really a fair matchup for him, so I won that one.
---
it really is. blizzard's customer service used to be great and always helped and understood the situation to the best of their ability, but it seems the newer GMs can barely type coherent english let alone mediate problems. it's sad and makes me feel embarassed for once thinking they were the peak of customer service.
---
You can't just bring salt with you on a PvP server. You're gonna have a bad time.
---
That said, I do have a second account I log onto to talk with the other faction after world PvP, see how the other person is doing, sharing pointers and insights for future encounters. I've rarely met someone like this orc.
---
I was taking for first time ever in DM, and before instance i said that, i havent played tank before. group was very nice and said its no prob. Ended up doing pretty fast run where we didnt had any "huntard" only problem was that pally proc hited so hard it often got aggro over me, but wasnt that big of a deal. I still tank time per time and always say that im new to tanking before going in. People get it and it have always been good expirence. People do know how tanking works, there is just some retail "lets go go go go" guys who dont understand that classic is slower thankfully haveny met any of them yet.
---
Just make sure let others know in the world chat who this person is, what he did, and to be wary of him. I’d post it once a day a few times and he reputation will suffer.
---
Wasn't just that. Tank damage and threat got a massive boost, aoe threat moves like swipe and thunder clap were much stronger. It was almost impossible to lose agro on a pack.
---
A working version of TheoryCraft.
---
This is how I feel about deadmines but im hired this time around. Thinking of an ally alt just to be able to run it easily
---
That's.. weird, though. Usually Blizz refunds you when you get scammed. Did they change their policies?
---
Personally, I’d rather stay on the mob and get a few more swings in for rage and eat/bandage. HP is easy to recover. Rage is precious. This guy’s complaint that food is too expensive to eat freely is a total meme. *Time* is the most expensive resource, particularly while leveling.
---
Bud Level 5
---
Specs really aren't that important for dungeons while leveling, ret paladins can heal, arms warriors can tank etc. without too much of a struggle while leveling
---
Same here !
---
Capital raids were completely inconsequential in vanilla. Not only due to lack of benefits/detriments for killing/losing a faction leader, but because pvp'ing in such a laggy environment is neither enjoyable nor in any way indicative of any side's superiority. At least downing the server was somewhat amusing. 
---
But now, with introduction of layering, its not even the whole population of enemy faction being affected. Rolling over disorganized resistance and couple of NPCs with 3-4 (why not 6-7?) raid groups, that affects only 1 layer is a very questionable achievement. I mean good for you for having fun, but you sound awfully proud and smug about something so trivial. Wait for AV to arrive and see how you'll fare with equal numbers  on an actual battlefield.
---
&gt;When people are given the option to transfer, they will transfer to servers that benefit themselves. Most people don't want balanced PvP, they want a massacre in their favor - A server where they can do whatever they want and not have consequences.
---
I mean, being on the more populated faction is more than just winning world pvp by default. It means you have more options for groups and guilds, probably better economy, etc. 
---
And beyond that, pvp isn't even "fair" to begin with. It's fun but I couldn't imagine getting an ego because I think I'm a beast at WoW pvp, especially in vanilla.
---
I am a resto shaman and i have the chest. Was running BRD with a druid tank and 3 mages... dont think ive had it equiped more than maybe 15 seconds. :P
---
dis gud. me thank.
---
6 stam + 5 int + 10 RAP (and 20 melee AP) vs. \~0.2-0.3% crit, tiny armor and dodge.  
---
Doesn't seem like much of a contest to me D:
---
DUNE GON !
---
Same here broh, true broelf druid representing ya
---
Okey , you want me to tell you that you should tap when you feel like even if you mess with the mana usage that you healer , the peace of the dungeon or just bc fuck it. do it , fucking do it.
---
I was making a reference which no one understood it seems.
---
Yea it seems to be atleast very close to that. We won’t kill her till Monday so I’ll have to agonizingly wait to make my bow :(
---
harsh but true
---
Was not meant to post as an achievement or anything. I  just wanted to share an experience I had playing classic, as I thought this thread was about classic? Sorry if I mislead you to belive otherwise.
---
I through arena runs were for the one pre raid bis for Hunter that drop in brd
---
Im a prot warrior so im useless in pvp a naked mage killed me in a duel using engi stuff i just thought it was really funny considering om full pre raid bis with some items from raids. I do not however think its unfair use what you need to use to win
---
Pre-bis for RET paladins? :D Heh, thats a good one. 
---
Wait, you serious?
---
Out of curiosity did you have a hunter in your group?
---
This is Classic Threat Meter. Doesn't work for me, so I don't recommend it.
---
I use Details! Damage Meter that comes with the Tiny Threat addon, works marvels for me.
---
Any mob which reduces my hit chance or disarms me. Seriously, this is pure pain as a melee.
---
We did it on both layers that were up.
---
So you think 70g was good investment im broke af rnow 🤣
---
It was so funny, when I was playing a gnome warrior and replaced all shouts and charges with macros with a lot of yelling, e.g. "FOR DA GNOMEREGAN" or ''WAAGH" or "AGHAGHAHGH".
---
Most of the groups were hating me so much, but at the same moment they were too lazy to find another tank (there were not much at the moment), so everybody had to witness my beautiful roleplay.
---
Why hate? Just ignore them if they tap to death and do not eat so what?
---
nothing tilts me more than boomer groups who los pull one at a time
---
Lol wyrmthalak the 1% horde
---
I literally just use slice and dice and rupture totally off topic but yeah, it defiantly misses a shit ton. I only use it will its going to kill the mob
---
For me, using stuff that is equipped on you (and inspectable, like trinkets) is fine, but using consumables that sit in your bags (like grenades or potions) is not fine, unless it was said before.
---
Took me a few sec to reslize that the warrior in fact wasn’t a bird
---
Think you would have gotten full exp if you weren't in the same group.
---
While I don’t personally go out for players that are grey on me, I do understand that if you’re in a PvP server, everything is fair game. It’s not called ‘PvP but with a bushido,’ it’s just PvP.
---
King Bangalash offers a unique opportunity for hunters prior to ~60.
---
This happened to one of our members yesterday aswell, the exact same thing died in the air lolz.. #nochanges
---
Tier 0.5 because it's fucking good feeling when you're finished. But it's not like until phase 4 or something.
---
I remember in the tiny pond in the entrance to thunder bluff, there was a drowned tauren called Icantswim.
---
In the Goldshire inn's fireplace, there was a dead  gnome called Firewood.
---
yes, go grind for a few levels. I had a few problems at this level too.  I got in groups for SM to just xp grind. Was fast and in a good group you can level to 44 and 45 in a few hours.  
---
I like to slightly over level a zone, as I am an ele/resto shammy.  Running instances is fast xp. 
---
Tanaris and Ferelas at 45 are great to start. Lots of quests and ZF so easy to level from here. I jump between both these zones right now. I'm level 47, and my aim will be to finish in Tanaris &amp; Ferelas while still running ZF, and once I hit 50, head to the Hinterlands.
---
Against trash in dungeons if I dot up multiple targets and switch to shadow bolt main target?
---
Or just shadow bolt things down.   Where do rain of fire and hellfire fit in for you?
---
Why do you have 6 bank alts?
---
I was looking for the "dinner and a movie" comment I knew I'd find.
---
It's not that black and white. You'll probably never understand so just keep going afk and I'll keep ganking any easy pickings that don't fight back.
---
Hi, /u/cavespro

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d90i4x/both_dal_rends_dropped_same_guy_won/). 
---
Weird changes when? I've been seeing videos on how to farm Mara since a week after release. Has anything changed since? [Here's somebody killing all 3 bosses at the same time.](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/485781453
---
)
---
First time playing wow and a warrior that guide helped me a lot! 
---
However there are a lot of questions, maybe someone here can give me a helping hand. 
---
1) Do I sunder everything? I was under the impression that animals don´t have armor, so I only sunder stuff which I believe has armor. Or do we sunder everything?
---
2) Is the damage dealt from bloodrage % dmg, or fixed dmg? I was always worried that the health loss would increase my downtimes. If its only a fixed amount it should get better the more hp I have I think. 
---
3) I did hear from other warriors that I should not use heroic strike since it would replace just my auto attack, but isn´t it better to get the additional dmg on auto attack and have a yellow hit instead of white hit? 
---
4) how important is armor? so if I find a very good cloth armor with perfect stats should I value heavy armor with less optimal stats over it cause of armor?
---
5) Warriors don´t regen life in combat (spirit power) right? so is the out of combat regen % based? so the more HP I have the more I regen? or will the natural hp regen later be neglectable?
---

---
I see where you are coming from but honestly.
---
When I see someone die to a Horde scum - I will jump in and help them.
---
If they then tell me not to help or that they were having a 1v1 I let them be. Otherwise I will happily help kill that Horde scum in order to let my fellow ally Level in peace. Even if he started it.
---
There is no honor in open world pvp I have made that experience myself too many times.
---
As soon as you start letting People have their 1v1 it's like no one ever is gonna let you have a 1v1 yourself. From there on I would always fight at least 2v1 because that how the  game goes for me xD
---
I’m hoping that Phase 2 doesn’t last very long. It’ll get old real quick if you’re on the lower pop faction. Leveling through the final zones will be near impossible because you’ll be an HK for max level players.
---
In which category would you place yourself as a player? I’m curious to hear your reasons for disliking LC. The better the guild, the better the players....the better LC is.
---
Around 60% horde on Gandling
---
You've gotta kill \~80 elite mobs so better done in a group. Treat this as an aboveground dungeon.
---
&gt;Usually u can judge the hunter by the pet and know what kind of player u're dealing with! If they tame 'brokentooth' at 37 (Rare spawn cat, highest attackspeed ingame together with a lvl 60 Bat) you know you got a tryhard min-maxxer! If they carry a Turtle, Tallstrider or Crocodile you shouldnt expect much damage.
---
So will people hate us, if we join a dungeon group and we "only" have a tallstrider? :D
---
&gt; This said, if she really really want a Tallstrider, atleast get 'Strider Clutchmother', a lvl 20 rare one with a unique look! 
---
Easier said than done. She already developed a personal relationship to that individual tallstrider :D
---
Wait, some people really believe you can waste rolls? It's not predefined.
---
Also because combat has 5% hit built into it, and +5 weapon skill.
---
I trade -&gt; 1 agi = 2 attackpower
---
If the benefit is equal, I'd take the agi piece. In your picture, the blue piece is much better
---
Can you elaborate  to why it's not fine? It's how they made their character. They might have chosen Alchemy / Herbalism  just to have more pots to use when they want, without  having to spend too much  gold or time on it. And because they build a character differently than you, does it mean they're not allowed to use it?
---
If that is the case, what do you think about bis-created items from professions? Same case there, using professions to gain advantage.
---
At the end of the day, the majority of the pack isn't at 60 yet and the people who are already 60 are sitting around with pre raid best in slot, waiting for 2 raids and farming rep/money.
---
Phase 2 wont be out for another few months most likely so you have ample time to level a character, get to 60 and geared for phase two and pvp.
---
I got to 60 in 7 days on my druid which is on Gehennas but due to friends rolling horde on Shazzrah, the queue times in the evening and the fact that I don't really like my druid , I've rerolled on their server.
---
Currently sitting at lvl23 and I'm enjoying it so much more than my druid.  
---
Play about, try different classes and then decide your main, you have so much time.
---
What did u even do in 6 days played lvl 40
---
This is one of the main reasons I can't w8 for my beloved TBC. Holy shit it's gonna be so epic
---
Just levelup one char to L60, then you can do whatever you want with alts. Fun of multiboxing, you can levelup 4-5 different classes at once. Slowly, because im doing professions on all of em, so while i skin, the other 4 just stand there.
---
qeuats wasfdafs
---
Like... Did you even try Google or reddit search? :3
---
I mean I'd get it if it was just invented yesterday but this shit has been around for years. There is guides for this.
---
25s, nice!
---
I'm lock main and always start a dungeon by informing the healer that I tap a lot. And that all I need is the odd renew. Warlocks are self sufficient. Tap, tap, tap and drain when needing a top up. If played correctly, we don't require healing. If played badly, well....
---
As a Warlock it feels unnatural to be above 30% hp for me at any time.
---
Wow alliance are a bunch of racists.
---
Having someone help you when you're about to die, or being able to stand up against two or more enemies is just as exhilarating. Even having that victory grasped from your hand just make a you all the more determined for the next battle. That element of not knowing what could happen is what keeps PvP exciting. What you're suggesting would dilute the experience massively.
---
If you want to simply 1v1 people, feel free to step outside a city and duel people.
---
Try not to be disheartened by the min-maxers. If you're talking endgame: 
---
- If you want to be hyper competitive in pvp you'll have to put in the time to get good.
---
A good druid in pvp is scary thing to most classes (apart from maybe warlocks or priests).
---
But in pve you'll always be welcomed to raids as resto (With less competition for loot).
---
Feral is 100% best for leveling though!
---
You got to 30 ?  
---
Nice !
---
I got to alts ...
---
I think it's so sweet with all these stories of families playing together.
---
The cut at the neutral auction house is 10% or is it 15%?
---
Not contesting your ability here, but I don't see this playing out in priest's favor. If I was a hunter I wouldn't send in the pet to be leeched, I'd just apply Viper Sting from range until the priest is oom.
---
&gt;  you take aggro away from the tank, and by doing so, make the enemy much  more likely to attack not only you, but other party members, especially  healer. 
---
I'd add; And if you're a hunter who has to be healed due to pulling mobs the tank was supposed to pull; DON'T YOU FUCKING DARE TO FD!
---
sincerely
---
The healers
---
Meh, I recently 'helped' an alliance priest out while questing in ashenvale. The poor bugger was surrounded by some of those elementals (like 5 or 6) so he would have died either way. I earth shocked him to accelerate the process a little bit and save him some time...
---
Can you tell me if the pickpocket money is from the same "loot table" from when you loot after a mob dies?
---
I might be oldschool but potions dont belong in duels. Engie things is ok i feel since every does it. But if someone uses a free action potions og limit invo pot i will instantly /forfeit. Is it really ok if i use posion cleansing pots dueling a rogue? Diminishing his whole class, i dont think thats cool. In world pvp everything goes obviously, but a duel is ment to be fair isnt it. My 2 cents atleast.
---
Also solves the aggro problem. 😏
---
Woah, thanks!
---
Seems like Dragonfang is the way to go.
---
Most annoying mobs here we go:
---
1) Gnoll camps in Westfall and Wetlands. 6 happy gnolls sitting around a campfire, all aggroing at once with additional 1-2 patrolling around and between different camps. A reasonable notch up from the neutral mobs in starting area, I mean they player has to learn how to CC, right?
---
2) Murloc camps anywhere. Lengthy stick building complexes along beaches with slim, stealthy beings that are impossible to see against the shade of sand without hammering tab trying to make of your surroundings. It will not make sense. All you hear is "MRG-MRGLRG!" and you try to see just how many tiny beings slightly turned to face you and perhaps will proceed to throw a spear at you every 3 seconds. The math here is simple: you move closer, you move further, you get even more MRGLRLG.
---
3) Any mob that will run up a 89 degree mountainside with your damage-over-time effects and proceed to die completely out of reach with your world epic loot sparkling away until they disappear unlooted.
---
4) One more in the jungle. You probably cranked vegetation settings all the way to 11 like me, this is a beautiful game, right? Bushes and treeleaves will push and sprout everywhere on your screen even if you could have sworn you already HS'd to Orgrimmar. Try visiting the oasis regions around Crossroads or Stranglethorn vale. Now try positioning the camera so that you can observe anything but green unimportant stuff. I'll wait while you run back to corpse having run into dozen mobs that were crouching among foliage.
---
5) Gnomeregan. My memories of this place are very fuzzy. And that makes me one of the lucky ones.
---
6) Underwater ships. Remember when Blizzard taught you how agro radius works in 3D? In the safe haven of Northshire, did you learn to analyze different types of in-game geometry for their Line-of-Sight qualities and whether NPC's can cast Wrath spells through walls? Have you memorized ship layouts and developed a good sense of how long you can fight underwater and when to start swimming to surface? You. Will. Learn.
---
Dear Blizzard, never ever take this away from World of Warcraft.
---
Champion thanks for the link will look into it asap, been teying to get a full run of brd but its tough with all the xp groups
---
Ah well, maybe I'm just the odd one here then. I get more sadistic enjoyment when I see their toon stop in their tracks and I know they just alt-tabbed. It's like a dog turning it's belly.
---
Good talk, you do you.
---
Almost every single game capture runs backwards so you don’t have to preemptively start recording you just capture after the interesting thing happens and the previous 15mins or so are saved.
---
I have the same problem 😂
---
I started as Shaman and lvled up it to 36 and then i felt bored and started Mage and lvled to 33 and then i felt bored and 2 days ago i started hunter, already 18 and will see how long i can play as a hunter
---
Alright my dude, no time to talk to angry people ! Bye bye
---
As best I can tell, XP to gold conversion is only availabe for one time quests. I've turned in some Scourcestones with the Argent Dawn which, according to wowhead, gives the same XP as Feathers for Nafien but didn't receive any monetary reward at level 60. Hope that helps.
---
I am also on Noggenfogger and I know what you mean, but I have too many ally friends there to move. I am very soon level sixty and i hope the inbalance will be somewhat less of an issue. BG-queued are gonna be instant for us in P3 so I guess thats a plus.
---
Thanks! That seems bearable but dunno if I will jump ship hm. I could go to Dragonfang which is more 50-50 ish.
---
Just asked because yesterday i helped a dude who got ganked on the chicken quest gank other people on the chicken quest and we want on a rampage in tanaris after. Sounded familiar. :p
---
By disconnecting the router
---
Truth, Deadly Poison is more damage then instance poison in the long fight, However it takes up 1 of 8/16 debuff slots. So you will always be using instant poison. Unless your horde, you don't poison your mainhand when there is a shaman around, because of windfury totem, cant have both. The rest are more pvp related. Sometimes Ill use crippling poison if mobs run.
---
Faction based queues is not the solution. Keep in mind that behind the faction there is a suscribed player that has the same rights as any other. You cant "block" anyone from playing just for the choosen faction.
---
Transfers are another thing, and maybe the solution. You don't force anyone to leave the server, but offer the option to highest populated faction until balance. Sounds fair to me.
---
Another option could be to offer some kind of incentive in character creation. Less populated faction can have... I don't know... maybe "rested" experience bonus until XX level or something in the line, not just to promove the char creatin, but to keep leveling it until faction balance. Blizzard is good at this, surely something would occur to him.
---
I don't like sand. It's so *sandy*. But you, Padme, you are **not** sandy. And that's why I love you.
---
Those are the people that were too lazy to level their profs.
---
For mediocrity, sure
---
you can never know how many layers there are. devs have stated multiple times that they dont want to say that for multiple or reasons. 
---
All im saying that city raids in phase 2 will be more fun.
---
He loves PvP when he wins only, otherwise it's unfair pvp !
---
You're talking rubbish you can blatantly see the difference between various mechanisms.  Using mailbox and shop are painfully sluggish, while combat is mostly flawless.  With &lt;50ms it still takes a second or more for shop items to make it to my inventory, that is not normal
---
:(
---
Nightfall procs now off healing wave?
---
Yes as a melee this is literally the worst ever. I should level my throwing just to be able to finish them off when they do that when they have 5% health left.
---
I don't know .... I never wiped in UBRS and I solo healed it for multiple runs. 
---
You need 1-2 tanks, 1-2 healers and the rest dps. Everyone should be 58+. You make a macro and split up the raid so that people can use the macro "/target Jed Runewatcher" and go stand in the first corner to the left when you enter LBRS and spam the macro until someone find him. Then you go in and kill everything, run out and reset ....
---
At no point did I say it shouldn't be allowed. Just because I- and many others- don't like it, doesn't mean I don't accept it as part of the game. I don't see anything wrong with complaining about something out of frustration, as long as people aren't asking Blizzard to remove PvP from PvP servers.
---
This.  Buying like 5 stacks of ammo makes the game respond as though you just asked it to compute the mass of the galaxy
---
As an elemental shaman, oozes
---
aoe farming will still work.
---
just not at peak times - and even then it would just depends on the location.
---
Didn't expect to find this old belarusian political meme here.
---
Shield bash ftw
---
If my mouse had four buttons I would, sadly I only have a meager 2 LOL
---
Just push a lil harder. Like blackmailing raidleaders irl to get into raid
---
Hopefully sometime January, but that time I might be just at 60 lol.
---
If you are a human and you've been doing some quests, there's very little if anything to gain by having more Stormwind rep.
---
To clarify and confirm what everyone else has said: this is impossible. Classic does not provide spell IDs in the combat log. This data was not made available until patch 2.4.0. Spell IDs are necessary to determine the correct rank of a spell known only by name. Without the ability to determine a spell’s rank, it is impossible to determine the threat it generates. 
---
Thus, this is an impossible request. 
---
I should add: the two combat logs we have for classic are excellent. With the exception of two known issues (both of which are currently being worked on), the numbers are completely accurate to what we know about threat. Anyone who says otherwise has no idea what they are talking about.
---
I'm enjoying the game, I'm don't rush! I do a lot of wpvp and I'm actually skinning 225.
---
I'm not really efficient in my questing though, I play a kinda from a day to day after work.. you know to relax.
---
Also, I'm rediscovering the game that I left years ago.
---
Explore the world, find yourself a place where the mobs are green for you, it is not heavily contested by other aoe mages, it doesn't have a quest linked to it so you won't encounter much pvp/ hate from friendly players trying to get a quest done, the mobs don't have ranged attacks/ snares and if/when you find such a place don't post it around online or you will quickly find there will be competition.
---
Luckiest man in the world right there having both drop and winning both
---
Well... We can't tell you much but to not invite noobs? I mean if you make the Groups yourself and you take noobs. 
---
Then it's your own fault?
---
Otherwise just try to stick along a guild run that is looking for 1-2 more people
---
Split into 4 segments, Graveyard and Library are open. But to get into Armory and Cathedral you need to run Library to obtain a key from a chest behind last boss. All entrances are accessable from the same hall 2 open and 2 locked behind doors (hence the key needed).
---
Yes, and yet ANOTHER reason why horde has advantage in pvp. Allys need to relie on a priest while horde can just purge it with the overpower shaman ability. qq
---
And he wins them both, wow someone’s lucky
---
Imp needs mana to hit, succubus doesnt. If you want to drain tank you should rush to Dark Pact, and you cant drain imps mana (more often than not, its going to be empty)
---
Getting exalted allows you to use that factions mount, other then that nothing really
---
Don't underestimate the absence of life in ambushing rogues. Less crowded location are usually less lucrative.
---
Hybrid class with double hybrid support built. Why doing one thing bad, if you're able to do two things bad?
---
Maybe a tracker for lockboxes like there is for herbs and mining in the game naturally. Its a pain in the a** when you are trying to evade monsters that are higher level and also increase your lockpicking skill. I looked for one but haven't seen any add-on for that purpose.
---
&gt; Was not meant to post as an achievement or anything.
---
^
---
&gt; To be honest with you, we could have done this with one aswell but we overestimated their fighting spirit. The horde didnt put up much of a fight. I saw low lvls defending while 60s just watched the slaugter. Thats "lok'tar ogar" I guess :)
---
I guess your earlier rep didn't age well lol
---
Drip, Gay, Blasted     Fairbanks
---
I've seen same people spam the same LFG message for hours, one case DAYS. Me and my friends laughed about it how he'd probably be 60 already if he'd just quested that time instead. In fact people who reached 60 first on our server did it by purely questing. 
---
Finding normal dungeon groups was rarely hard. Depends also what level range it was and how many people were similar levels. 
---
That's my experience. I really don't relate to people caring how others decide to level.
---
nah, keep playing with your friends.  
---
just don't complain about the lack of world pvp down the line.
---
I don't use 1-0, I use q-y and a-g, usually my setup with alt variations, sinister on Q
---
Is this about Enclave on Grobbulus?
---
This is easily done with a weakaura with minimal knowledge of lua, should you be interested in a fun learning exercise. Alternatively, try wago.io, as something like this may exist.
---
Most likely because people are buying it right up to that point.
---
AtlasLoot doesn't have maps. You need to use Atlas itself, it have separate button.
---
I hope so.
---
Where them keybinds at
---
Looking into building it when you have the eye
---
it is the horde players fault lol
---
don't blame this on the big bad man. players decide how they treat each other and where they go.
---
Shut the fuck up snitch ass
---
It would be fun to see the statistics for all flightmasters and what they make each day.
---
afaik leeway only works when running. like in video, mob slowed = not running = no extended melee range.
---
that's kinda fucked up tbh
---
I usually just let them tap away, and once they are at around 25% I throw in a big efficient heal to top them off, cost if not too high and if you time it along with a big heal on the tank you can get back to wanding and get that spirit to do its thing. I prefer that than having to stop after every 2 mob pull because the mage thought it would be smart to chain blizzard on 2 mobs and run oom after 6 seconds...
---
Dont understand why they didnt introduce a faction lock system like certain private servers did
---
Hey. I have an i7 9700k overclocked at 5ghz and an rtx 2070.
---
1. Put on a ~~dress~~ robe and pretend to be a priest
---
2. Maybe nobody will notice.
---
Killing Thermaplugg doesn't magically fix the problems Gnomeregan has, but it is a start.
---
Wasn't this basically a bug that was on private servers, not in vanilla?
---
If you check old vanilla clips everyone is stopping dps when she is about to land. 1 random dude heals and gets aggro.
---
I got the fishing pole here just a few mins ago... trying to farm another to sell.  Currently going for around 15g on the AH!
---
Seeing one player winning both of them I can only assume he was a hunter.
---
I feel you man. I'm also leveling arms and trying to tank along the way.
---
The obvious rotation with a shield should be Revenge (shield block helps proc) -&gt; sunder  -&gt; Heroic Strike (if you have plenty of rage)
---
I think the thing that has helped me the most is rage management. Ideally I like to chain pull as much as possible, as long as my healer has mana. Often I will even stop hitting the last mob of a pull at 30%, knowing that the dps will finish it before it kills anyone. Then I get a nice head start on the next 1-2 mobs. Also little keys like using Bloodrage to keep myself in combat longer, or hitting critters help me from being rage-starved between pulls.
---
another tip drop your curse and corruption then life tap to replace the mana, (another global cooldown) then start your immolate, even this slight slowing of dps can let the void get off his second taunt rotation.
---
To my knowledge, there has yet to be a module for dungeon maps released yet.
---
I don't get mad at warlocks life tapping but I do get mad when they are full health with everyone else in the party hurt and my prayer of healing is all over heal -- then they life tap after
---
You can make like 3 items that's about it lol.
---
No this is Patrick
---
From the dungeon rewards you mention I assume you're alliance?
---
Because if you go to WC, that one has great upgrades for hunters. There's a bow (Venomstrike) and the Druids of the fang set is decent for hunters as well.
---
Alright that's good to know. What about end game?
---
My alt is a pally who I'm loking forward to tanking with, I think people concern themselves with min-maxing too much.
---
My friend is LW and he can make BiS for level 60s at 300, idk how many or what. But it helps him a lot with hearing himself and getting him gold
---
Level 46 lock here still using the blueberry. I typically have one mob dotted and feared while dotting and wanding a mob on my vw. Is this less efficient than drain tanking + succ?
---
Up to you.
---
Though people shouldn't play on a PVP server and expect opposite faction players to not gank em.
---
I didn’t work in vanilla, but now I do! That’s not how I worked in vanilla!
---
Can you source a working example? I have not been successful.
---
Meanwhile, I bought my mount at 38 just in case I would be tempted to spend it on something else.
---
Fairbanks hasn't reached that point yet but brd can take a very long time to get in to due to horde  guilds camping the entrance. They've been there for 2 weeks now and no one on alliance can do anything due to lack of numbers. Prolly gonna re roll in a bit since arcanite reaper doesn't look appealing to me
---
The Scarlet Crusade are no joke, when the scourge ravaged Lordearon, they survived intact. Sure, they are zealous dickheads, but they are *strong*.

That's why I'm with the other guy. It doesn't bother me at all, I just give a renew every now and then. But fucking eat or drink, while I'm drinking anyway.
---
I'm guessing one of the talents is Martyrdom in disc but what's the other one?
---
&gt; Now that im level 40 what is the fastest way to level?
---
Same as before - doing quests in same locations.  
---
Quests give you gold, items and bonus experience on top of mindlessly killing mobs. 40 is Badlands and bottom of Desolace or Arati.
---
Looool that’s amazing 😂

Come to Incendius! Alliance is popping.

Been boosting my lowbe friends in DM on my 60 druid. What ever greens They dont need am i donating to the first low level i can find in westfall :)
---
shhhhhhsh... don't make this place more famous!
---
They probably work better with a bubble because of the well-known last hit bug with PW:S
---
This changes everything.
---
Try checking the AH for pieces you haven't replaced in a while, you might find a good deal. And don't just look for the monkey, some good pieces have set names.
---
When a dps dies, it’s usually their fault. 
---
People don’t like being blamed.
---
Immature people point the finger at somebody else when they are at fault.
---
Is there accurate information for which fish are caught where? In particular, I'm looking for the area with the least diversity of fish that includes Winter Squid, because that would theoretically be the fastest way to catch it. [This page](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Fishing_locations) is relatively accurate but not entirely - it suggests that Bay of Storms is the best place for my goal but theres a lot of catch there that isn't listed on that page.

Nice to see my realm is close to 50/50. Ashbringer EU.

Fair enough, I just did it to get mount money and to get LW mats, didn't expect to get even one Whelpling, but now if I did it I could easily get 24k xp/ hr which isn't bad.
---
I've been doing 2h fury since I have low hit. What hit % do I need to go with dual wielding?
---
Yeah just browse World chat until you see a LFM ad and whisper the guy, best way to learn the route is to tag along as dps or healer. If you are tank (like me) I usually ask a DPS to tag for me or mark the mob I should pull next.
---
You mean 40g each? xd
---
Where in this reply did I imply it was an achievement? All I said was that we thought it would be harder more or less.
---

I heard this is where to wait for juicy details? It’s pretty comfy here, I’m going to sit by the hearth and wait to see what happens.

The salesman in me keeps telling they might continue their viability denial in form of PvP, imagining it's only their gear that's the issue.

There is an "entrance hall" in the monastery from which the different parts can be reached. The Graveyard can be done entirely on its own, but iirc, you would have to do (small) parts of the earlier dungeons to get to the next. You do not have to do Mograine and Whitemane (Cathedral) to get to Herod (Armory) or Doan (Library), only some trash.
---
It is not uncommon to do the last three parts together, though. I remember the Graveyard as separate, also because the required level is lower (iirc).
---
They should have left undead actually flagged as undead like they were in beta. They complained that spells that targeted undead could hit them - why yes, that's the trade-off. Shackle undead and paladin nukes are the price for being immune to fear, charm, and being able to breathe underwater.
---
the hit % doesnt apply to spells though
---
I can see that but I'm charging, popping SS, hitting MS and then stance dancing to zerker after popping enrage to whirlwind/cleave which seems to work OK for me (eating/bandaging after that).  Difference in play styles I guess!  Feels sort of excessive to pool above 50/60 since rage above 25 is going to be lost to stance dancing anyway.
---
Doesn't succ die from tanking mobs?
---
There is only one true option for Classic grind and it is Bal-Sagoth.
---
You dont even use hunters mark and sting, you basically just auto attack and multi shot. Aimed shot if specced

Silithids... and the spiders in duskwood.

I'm 6 levels higher than them, and yet they still manage to OH SO CONVINIENTLY STROLL CLOSER TO ME AND THEIR AGGRO RANGE IS MASSIVE, SERIOUSLY WHOEVER CREATED THESE THINGS, AND THEIR DEBUFF, I HOPE YOU STEP ON A LEGO PIECE!
---
But apart from that, I'm okay with most things :)
---
&gt; BRD Emperor Lava run wasn't created in classic.
---
It wasn't? I'm pretty sure I recall doing exactly that, aswell as taking the route when going for the Black Anvil of course.
---
Lifehack:  you have a pet that takes the hit
---
Already in your title lol, more like 'destroy' a layer not 'horde dominated server'.
---
Had 15 golds at level 34, I could afford my mount when I dinged 40. No worries
---
I would love for you to log on to Heartseeker at any time of the day, especially at night, and tell me that it's low pop, or "dead". 
---
I'm laughing at you now, lol!
---
Thanks for the advice
---
Ever heard about Vurtne? You can have a whole utilitybelt of trinkets that you switch during combat-breaks, making you a whole lot more unpredictable to the enemy (PvP).
---
I don't like mobs that stun, disarm, enrage, run away and slow you.
---
I like caster mobs, mobs with low armor and mobs that shoot/throw at you.
---
Hunter gearing is very straight-forward: press Need on everything and that's all you have to worry about. You'll automatically receive the item if you have remembered to vendor all the other junk gear from your inventory so you have space for it.
---
Soloing as a priest:
---
0. Immune to shadow damage
---
1. Anything with an interrupt or silence
---
2. Higher than average health for their level
---
3. Trappers - annoying being stuck for 5 seconds when the fight ends
---
4. Runners
---
In that order, tbf I really don't have many complaints - I reckon shadow priests have it pretty easy.
---
Damm autocorrect! Gearing*
---
Because no one respects it. Its an uninteresting way of gaining an advantage that adds no depth to the game. Its just "Whoops, I guess I have a bunch more health now. I guess that makes me good." That's *boring*.
---
I will straight up /concede a duel the second someone pots and won't duel them again. Or I might even beat them in spite of it then mention the pot in /s if I really have good control of the duel.
---
The difference with grenades is that there's so much additional strategy and complexity that they add to the duel that they make things more interesting and, ultimately, more fun. They're the polar opposite of health potions in this regard. Personally, I think utility potions like swiftness and free action potions *should* be allowed in duels because they *are* interesting. But this would be an expensive habit.
---
CAW DEATH TO THE MUDMEN CAW
---
Druids get more rage by hitting mobs than warriors do, so it's less bad for druids, but still not good. So save the shield for emergencies :)
---
Farmed at 60 around hordes for 2 hours in aquatic form, pissing them off immensely. 
---
Then I found out it goes for 5g on AH.
---
Still, pissing off the hordes was worth it.
---
Cured rugged hide is a 3 day CD you can sell from 20-50g depending on how many other LW are skilled enough on your server. There's usually more Leatherworkers than Alchemists and Mooncloth is needed for longer periods of time, so these proffesion CD's are generally more valuable. However 20g passively every 3 days is very nice.
---
If you can produce and sell devilsaur set and hide of the wild you can make decent cash selling end game items also. I belive these are Tribal Leatherworking patterns.
---
But you'll have to decide which spezializaton you prefer at 250, I would check out a LW guide for this.
---
I mean, you could be more specific in your query.
---
Yeah boi. Literally rerolled 3 times.
---
No it hasnt. Not even WoW had it from the start, it was added during the Classic period.
---
Coming from a warlock, it should basically be a rule that locks get no heals from lifetap drain unless they get agro (in which case, why are you lifetapping if you have agro?), i get that being oom is pretty boring but you're essentially just stealing mana from the healer if you expect the healer to recover your health for you.
---
Personally, i never lifetap in combat and even when out of combat i always eat after lifetap, i think everyone should generally be doing the same, but that's a preferred world, not a realistic one.
---
Life saver right here as a 36 warlock trying to figure shit out
---
Maybe you should be pulling faster then. A mage who is still drinking ain’t going to throw out a blizzard the instant you pull.
---
Both druids and warriors have the same issue with power word: shield. Absorbed damage = no rage.
---
Well, as i stated above, i experienced it myself. Back in vanilla and what a surprise, it hasn't changed in classic. The massive circle jerk you are talking about only supports my experiences. I feel sorry for you and for every good hunter out there (my best WoW friend since vanilla is a hunter main by the way). Same goes for rogues, i main a rogue ever since and i also got a lot of flag just for being a rogue. I know and accept there are a lot of shit scumbag noob rogues, who cares? No need for me to get upset about. Instead i think i have all rights to get upset about hunters for needing on Felstriker and therefor i can feel everyone who had similar experiences.
---
People need to stop defending this shit no matter which class pulls such crap.
---
As a healer I run aoe groups and regular groups every single day.  Gaming subreddits just love to bitch.
---
I know this is a vanilla sub, but using the dark portal for the tbc expansion was absolutely amazing, both in a mechanical way as well as lorewise. Going through it felt truly awesome, and all that without a lame cinematic.
---
The dark portal always has a special place in my heart
---
I do this too and end up hating myself and the game for it.  
---
Why do all the classes have to be so interesting while no class just  clicks with me.
---
I heard that place was the place for squids as well. I have yet to try it myself.
---
People are overexagerating the mana issue, i only drink once or twice per dungeon, not NEARLY every pull.
---
tOxiC mEtA
---
Looks good, will try it out later - thanks.
---
3 kills without sinew, 3 hunters
---
Congrats man! Keep having fun!
---
Then the tank shouldn’t give the dps time to reg. The healer sits down to drink? Pull the next group. You’ll have all the time in the world to generate threat.
---
You spelled DUNEGON wrong
---
The guy you're responding to made a typo, he meant HEALING himself. The guy's a Tauren, so naturally when he takes damage he applies leather patches to wherever the skin's gone.
---
You sure they arent just looking for a new group after the old one finished? A decent spellcleave group can clear any wing of SM in 10-15 minutes max.
---
The questline that gets you [Dawn's Gambit](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12368/dawns-gambit) for Scholo, it's pretty fun! Turns the whole Vectus' room of students to one-shotable skeletons, heh.
---
Even the rest of the questline is pretty fun, you get to freeze and collect eggs in UBRS, always makes people ask you what the hell is going on :) Starts with [this quest](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=4726/brooding-essence)
---
Me not that kind of orc
---
You never get gear because there is ten mages every MC

Item count can give you rough insight on balance, after all it's just the ratio that's important. But establishing a fixed integer coefficient between item count and player count is positively absurd idea.

Badum bump
---
Just want to add that Engineering is most likely  the best option for PVE. Grenades for AOE damage in dungeons and some raid situations and there are some gadgets that have their use in PVE as well (Gnomish Battle Chicken for example)
---
wow! if lakeshire-eu would be a pvp... xD
---
Yup. That bug is random
---
One problem with tanking is that Egineering costs so damn much and is a PITA to level. You can't demand from every warrior to pick up Engineering, have enough bombs for AoE threat every pull and then get several stacks of Immolation oil from an alchemist alt. Not everyone has THAT much time on their hands.
---
Ah, okey. Im not sure we will do much city raids when the honor system is implemented. Alot of dishonorable kills unfortunately.
---
"Inventory is full"
---
Getting faster to 60 means you'll start making gold faster. I would just level asap and not try to save quests.
---
Sup this was prob me.  Atleast we finished the instance in like 6 min though.

What changes? I have no issues farming all 3 on my spriest

Ok ty :)

O no the laundry room floor is messed up. What will the neighbors think.

What's the horde population there? I am looking to roll a new horde tank on a healthy pop realm
---
I mean do as you wish mate it's vanilla and that's the great thing about old talents! But you sound like you have a good niche thing going on, don't change it if it works for you ay. I prefer ret tree just for added holy dmg for threat, but yeah like i said before it kinda relies a bit more heavily on your healers.
---
Kromcrush best server
---
I've found out I'm too polite man, healer was giving me shit for never lifetapping because he was having an easy time. It just feels like stealing healers mana.
---
Or dual wielding! If my character can only carry one weapon, then so should you!
---
And face me when you attack me! It's not fair to hit me from behind!
---
I'm playing WoWC on a bus with Surface Pro 5 over LTE and it runs beautifully. What I don't love is having to use touchpad though.
---
Suggest they get a grip . As you have access to Reddit and there a far more explicit things on here than in the game
---
There is a post on front page with all servers and the faction balance. :)
---
I'm not sure I understand the locking chat thing your talking about but its disapointing to see a lack of action.
---
Have you ignored these players? Or does it go beyond chat?
---
The think is that this is only true if all people rush to 60. Largest playerbase dont. 
---
The largest part of people wanna enjoy the road to 60, do pvp along the way, fish, explore and just fuck around. they want to expirience classis wow like in old days ir expirience it for first time.
---
You can't cast Innervate in bear form. And if you go out of form while holding threat - you\`re dead.
---
Horde heavily outnumber the alliance
---
the happiest rogue of all :D
---
On Gehennas yesterday we vigorously held the horde outside the pirate fortress in Tanaris for two hours. We were mayhaps 15 ally players at most in three grps, killing every horde that entered on sight, forcing them to grind on the few pirates around the tents outside the fortress. But when I finally finished farming my bloody 20 hats and tried to leave the area.... oh god were they thirsty for revenge and my blood.
---
Ok fuck. Glad im doing it right
---
I’m struggling to find it for some reason. Can you help me out please? :)
---
We should be bad to have played that much and only being 40 haha
---
Probably panicked when they had to release so many new servers and people were actually sticking with their characters
---
You have 1% chance to roll a 100, that's good for every roll whatever the preceding roll was.
---
Why would you relax when you hit 60 nows your biggest time to go wild :D
---
&gt;5 Level Bud
---
Level 5 Bud
---
I read the wowhead comments too. There is a classic player that reported it drops aggro and functions like vanish in classic.
---
I guess not all tanks check their healer's mana bars then :-)
---
It says it right there: "Suggestion: Vendor this item". Right?
---
I get crap loads of runecloth from the devil dudes at the top of felwood that drop the felcloth
---
QuestGuru Sound! i had the same problem!
---
I'd say felwood, you got wolves and bears over there (a bit diseased but should be skinnable, right?)
---
You could try western plaguelands, kind of the same fauna, but a bit higher level.
---
Lower tanaris might be nice, scorpids and hyenas and basilisks.
---
TIL sus is short for suspect. Did you know it means pig in Latin?
---
You have the makings for a mean party there, fren.
---
You can always go 31/0/20 or something like that, it's absolutely fine for tanking too. Maybe not any more for Naxx or AQ (at some point you _need_ shield slam for threat management iirc), but up to and including BWL you'll be fine.
---
Seal twist sor/sow? 
---
Also for non-engineers can use magic candles farmed from kobold geomancers in elwynn, linken's boomerang (3 min cooldown), and the off-hand from the morbent gel quest(30 sec equip cooldown)

I think the 7 defence 4 str and 100 armor does give more value than 6ap. But no sane person would compete against rogues/warriors for 6ap and super low drop rate.
---
Such a relief !
---
Disagree, Tanaris and Feralas are great zones.
---
Zul Farrak also helps.
---
30-35 was a slog for me, had no idea where to go, luckily I found Desolace

Just spam Swipe. Maul sucks anyways.
---
So whats my option, respeccing all the time? I cba leveling up another character just for PvP
---
have a group who dont care about rank do the civilian killing

Earthshaker is hands down your best choice. Way more tryhards on the server, bloodfang is full of casuals hardly any 60s there. Balance is almost 50-50.
---
 You must obtain a certain player level to train the next rank

Threat Plates (Classic) has been really nice for me. Let's me know if I have aggro on the mobs, let's me know if I am about to lose it. Even shows the debuffs above the enemies health plate.

Also on Ash, really does feel horde favored when im out questing.

You should probably visit a weapon trainer. Apparently, you don't know how to hold a sword.
---
Whey would you do orange quests as a warrior?
---
could of would of should of
---
Easy fix: communicate with your healers beforehand.
---
"I'll eat between pulls. Don't worry about topping me off."
---
"I have bandages. Don't worry about me out of combat."
---
Things like that will go a long way, a lot further than crying because a healer assumed you were like many others who don't try to be self-sufficient and just rely on heals.
---
DPS would rather install a DPS Meter and try to top it. If they installed a threat meter, they would just try to max it, too.
---
Kind of a salty comment, but I also feel like it would end up being true.
---
Wasn't even that way in wow at first.  I remember being really excited about it when they implemented it.
---
What rank dark pact are we talking about here? Hitting your GCD twice to have mana for a single spell isn't broken at all. I'm lvl 53 with rank 2 dark pact and it's up to 200 mana per cast, which is a bit better but still not a replacement for a lifetap that'll get you a spell or 3. 
---
That said, I play Succubus 100%, with dark pact, but it's OK, not amazing, imho.
---
He states exactly how he kills them in 10 seconds. When they pull multiple mobs while low on health, after waiting several minutes because he's afraid to attack them when he has a chance of losing. In that sort of situation a wand could kill someone in 10 seconds.
---
I've rerolled 50 times during vanilla. Highest char was level 50 after 2 years. Its normal to be undecided. 
---
What I do is watch a ton of pvp movies and pick a class that looks strong and cool to play.
---
Its for a friend
---
Is melee dps used much at 60 in pve? I played a rogue in vanilla and remember getting into dungeon groups however I had the benefit of being able to unlock things for a little utility. Also it was 15 years ago and I can't remember details about how hard it was to find groups.
---
I'm currently level 50 so not been in end game dungeons but all I see in lfg is "LFM ranged dps" etc etc. I'm playing a druid and if I'm tanking I prefer a full melee group as there's less downtime drinking and they benefit from my crit buff but just wondering if that's viable at 60?
---
You know what to do.
---
As someone who works in aircraft, definitely seems like some of the engineers who design shit are no bigger than 2 foot tall and can squeeze anywhere and everywhere
---
What are the most important pet passives for PvP after Frost and Shadow resistance?
---
Ah yes. The one guy with the super weird equip and build who comes along every raid because he is best friends with the RL.
---
So much wrong information based on your feelings.
---
There is a 16 debuff limit in classic so warlocks can't use corruption and use shadowbolt which has a cast time. Shadowburn is an instant spell direct damage spell that could be cast on the move, but it takes a shard. The Imp's firebolt is also direct damage.
---
Good professions for a gnome mage, currently running tailoring with nothing else.
---
Since my addon never scanned the AH for this item, it doesn't recognize it having any competition or any value, when in fact these go for 40g bids on the AH atm in my realm and there's never more than 2 or 3 up at a time. It's a 0.16% drop mate non-combat pet, they'll probably go for even more later on.
---
what list? wowhead has it as bis 2H if hit is capped.
---
Reroll alliance on skeram pussy
---
Unless you knocked out a good chunk of those quests getting to 60.  In which case you'll only have relatively challenging quests left.  It's still worth doing, but more for targeted gear than gold really, because a lot of them are from the 60 instances you'll be running anyway.
---
How does the hunter pet windserpents ranged attack work? Does the pretty also melee? How does it work with intimidation? Can you do ranged intimidations?
---
3-4 full raid groups is a completely unfeasable amount of combatants.  I don't think anybody could really have defended against that.  I bet it was fun as shit, though.
---
This is so fucking lofty and the worst justification of playing like an idiot I constantly hear about using the noobberry. First, you can kill 3 mobs with Succubus. Between Fear, Seduction, the healing you are receiving from Drain Life/Siphon Life, etc.  
---
Second, even if the VW was better for this, you will never, ever encounter packs of this magnitude with a frequency high enough to justify using it ALL THE TIME. If it is true, you can just as easily summon it only for those situations. The truth, though, is that 90% of the time, you are only going to be able to do one mob at a time based off of availability. 
---
I am really not envious of people killing mob after mob with VW. How fucking slow. You realize that your only downtime with the big Succ is bandaging once ever 4 mobs, right? 
---
For reference, I have a 60 Lock on Horde and a 33 Lock on Alliance, both with very good leveling speeds and I hardly, if ever, use my VW.
---
Facts idk what I was thinking.
---
Reroll alliance on skeram then pussy

You can't really tell sever ratio, that census SS isn't relliable.

If you're the one tanking, you should be laying down the law on that shit.
---
I really struggle with this as well. At the moment I have a 33 paladin, 23 hunter 20 mage..
---
And I keep wanting to roll warrior or rogue..
---
Or or or.. I find it difficult to keep going especially because the earlier levels are easy and a lot gets done. The higher you get the more of a painful grind it is and progress is a lot slower (brains reward system not fired as much)
---
But one thing that is helping me is setting goals. For example I want my mount. I'm 33 so damn close to 40 I'm not stopping now I really wanna get it. Perhaps a similar goal could help u
---
&gt;7 defence
---
Is really low value as a hunter cant even block. 4 str only gives melee AP so literally valueles... 
---
so its basicly 6 AP vs. 100 armor... As a dps you always choose AP here (look at warriors in elather).
---
The thing is you can't waste it since it probably wouldn't be a 100 if you waited. Like I said random numbers in programs are generated from the time, they're not defined in advance.
---
I could understand the feeling of spending your luck when you get a result from throwing a physical dice because you feel like you have some form of control over it from the position of the dice in your hand and the way you throw it.
---
For /roll though, you have the same chance of rolling 100 - 100 - 100 - 100 as rolling 100 - 12 - 45 - 23
---
like them girls?

Nice video dude!

Me and my friends who have all played since pretty much launch or tbc ish, are having a ton of fun with two of our newer friends finally trying WoW Classic. They began around late WotLK/Cata or later. They are having a lot of fun, though, but also find a lot of things frustrating.

"Dude, WHY AM NOT FUCKING SHOOTING?! SHOOOOOOOTTT-- Oh. No ammo."

"I legit need powder for Blind? Are you serious?"

"How am I missing all these attacks? Is my character retarded?"

It's a thing of beauty. Haven't had this much fun in a long time. Thank you, Blizzard. For giving me and my mates the game we loved and adored for years back.

No i just think that people talk up reputation to much. Sure to some degree you can be famous or infamous but overall people will forget

I wonder why both big Aus PvP servers are horde biased. Hm.

&gt; BRD key quest
---
On this note, I'd recommend getting the save the princess chain done early, so you can actually be eligible for the loot from her before doing too many runs.
---
Also if you're extra masochistic (or just need lbrs a lot for something specific), get started on the seal of ascension quest.  You'll be very valuable to your guild if you can unlock ubrs.
---
Basically as a Paladin you need to have 2 gears: PVE/Raid Healgear (most of the stuff will be cloth/no shield etc.), while PVP Healgear will be mostly Plate (or Mail).  
---
Cheers
---
N.. No..
---
Every night man, every night.
---
You could get enchanting. Lots of tye greens you make to level tailoring are worth more when disenchanted.
---
Wtf are you on about? Players are rolling on pvp servers because they want to pvp lol. It's 100% Blizzard's fault for giving both sides the option to transfer.
---
I started doing BRD runs to collect my pre- bis gear on my Priest at level 58. It took me roughly 10 hours getting a level from 58 to 60. And even though that I've been living inside BRD for 2 entire levels, there are still some pre- bis items that I have yet to see drop.
---
My advice would therefore be to grind dungeons in your mid 55's, in order to secure that gear as early as possible :-) At level 60, it can easily feel like a chore doing the same dungeon over, and over again .. 
---
GL!
---
Yeah I just saw both, my guild is letting me raid as ret and I’ve said that I will defer all loot to any other class that would use it better than me. Maybe they’ll hook me up with a 2H because no other classes use them for a while.
---
Thanks for this link. I've been wondering how to find the file path for other things in game that I don't like hearing (the bow pullback sound is really annoying to me for some reason).

It cannot be used for determining absolute numbers of players. But it can tell something about the alliance/horde ratio. You would have to compare number of items between the AH's, preferably over a longer period of time.
---
You're basically draining mana from your healers every time you tap unless you're bandaging.

This is a really nicely laid out and formatted guide, and gives you your Pre-Raid and Raid BiS for each phase.
---
&gt; there is no leveling while being okay at pvp guide
---
No unfortunately, that's because pvp and pve are two very different play styles that require different skills.
---
It doesn't mean though that, while leveling, you can't have an okey build that can do for both, you just have to come up with a mix that can work for you and not just copy one or the other.
---
What alliance guilds left? I’ve only heard of one that has left so far.
---
Just normal that undead mages and gnome mages are the most aggressive ones among mage class. They probably already picket their race for pvp issues.
---
That guild nameplate.
---
While Arcanite Reaper is definitely BiS pre-raid throughout Classic, there are already several upgrades in Molten Core. These will last you until Phase 3, when BWL is added. The first option in Molten Core, while unlikely, is significantly better. Namely, this is the legendary [Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17182/sulfuras-hand-of-ragnaros). A more likely replacement will be [Bonereaver's Edge](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17076/bonereavers-edge). When Phase 3 hits, you will be able to replace the other weapons (except Sulfuras!) with [The Untamed Blade](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19334/the-untamed-blade) from BWL.
---
Any epics weapons are finally replaced by [Dark Edge of Insanity](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=21134/dark-edge-of-insanity) in Phase 5 (AQ40), and Sulfuras will finally be replaced by [Corrupted Ashbringer](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=22691/corrupted-ashbringer) in Phase 6 (Naxx).
---
Yes, silver from quest rewards begins to increase also

Ohh he forgot to mention. The game he is playing in the picture is actually Classic WoW. 
---
He is currently fishing in the Picture. You may not notice - he is using a bag addon called Bagnon. Thats probably why you didn't realize
---
at 280 you can make runecloth bandages so you reached the ultimate goal
---
Bro use an energy ticker and just press 1 or whatever is most comfortable to you, when it's up. No need to spam if no adrenaline rush
---
I think I found my issue, part of where my fishing bobber would land was outside of Bay of Storms. Once I was thoroughly in the area I was still getting stuff that the link i posted said wouldn't be there but it was much better. majority was Darkcraw Lobster, Large Raw Mightfish, Winter Squid and Stonescale Eel. A few clams and Spotted Yellowtail but infrequent.
---
I was the only rogue who wanted daggers in my vanilla raid guild and we didn't have a single one drop until we progressed halfway through AQ40. No gutgore rippers, no perds, no dragonfang blades. That lobotimizer/felstriker combo and I spent a long, long, long time together.
---
Oh, sure. You can eat a ghost, but I can't even exorcise or skin a spirit kodo.
---
Spirits are undead!

"Nope, it's a beast."

I'll skin it then!
---
"Lol nope, it's a ghost."

&gt; Haven't really had the opportunity to see if I can take on a rogue while I'm not fighting like 3 mobs on me.

It will be easy for you, trust me.

My guild wants to give me Sulfuras, it’s just on me to farm the gold for it. It’s going to be a legendary grind.

I'm lvl 25 and I have 15s. I think you should be able to your mount at 40.

I'm not the guy in the video dude, but alright I don't want to jump to conclusions then.

Isn't everything a hunter weapon though?
---
Lol this gives me some good perspective on things. I’ve never raided in vanilla.
---
Does anyone is interested in Timbermaw tailoring items (int/mp5 gear)? Also are there any other pattern-rep-gated sought after tailoring items aside of Thorium pants and Cenarion Circle nature resistance gear? Cloack of warding? CC Herb bags?
---
Which basilisks?
---
Your missing some key information, to pull threat in melee range you must exceed the target by 10% and to pull threat from range you must do it by 30%. So pulling aggro while not lowering the tanks threat requires the tank to gain more aggro to get the mob back (almost the same thing). Also if you do move the mob to the healers putting them in range and they were close before it will switch to them. So yes moving a mob closer to the healer is and issue, this goes for healers that step up and AOE also. Now taunt solves like all the problems here which is why you probably came to these conclusions in the first place but taunt isn't always up and knowing how the system actually works can be helpful.
---
What serie is it?
---
That is interesting, I wonder why it doesn't work like this with char names.
---
Yeah potions and elixirs in duels are absolutely ridiculous . If the community starts rampantly using them then it's just going to be a thing where everyone does and it all just wastes a bunch of money. IMO you should not be wasting consumables during duels. Because if I happen to beat you because I had a potion , your going to go buy one for the next duel and it becomes an endless cycle where no advantages change except we both wasted our money. I'm sure this is why nobody ever used consumables before because people realized it was pointless.
---
Christ guys, think ahead more then 5 minutes at a time will you?
---
Haha so true..
---
Weird situation. In general we get annoyed by bots that make misplaced messages, but this bot is made with such a good intention, we can't really complain.
---
blaumeux legit 50/50
---
For caster mobs just throw on curse of tounges. It's alot better having the mob trying to cast at you with - 50% speed then spell locking it it. Which means the mob will start to melee you
---
That's fair. I guess I would probably play Retail just for Arenas. But not feeling tempted at the moment. I think retail rotations can get a bit repetitive in PVE (although admittedly not as repetitive as casting Shadow Bolt or Frost Bolt 50 times in a row)
---
Totally agree, what's the point of a "duel", if you are about to win fair and square and without warning I pop elixiers, worlddrop root items, heals and all that kinda stuff to turn the tables, when the opponent hasn't agreed on using them?
---
Appreciating it here before some mod deletes it
---
I have my main (resto shammy), which I want to get to level 60 in the next two weeks (currently 47). But once I get there, and when I'm not running instances or raids....then its alt time!!! I love playing different classes. 
---
In vanilla, before tBC, I had my hunter main, then had a shammy, Priest, warrior, druid and rogue. Once Tbc came out, I made a Pally.   The only class I've never played was a warlock. 
---
I loved jumping between classes and playing my alts when they had loads of rested xp. Was easy and fast to level them that way, and I didnt get bored playing 1 class again after leveling my main.
---
your fault ... you were thinking of the SM dungeon whereas these folks go into the SM dunegon which, as we know, does not have 4 wings
---
&gt;What if the tank isn't as geared
---
Warrior tank threat doesn't scale with gear, pretty much. No matter what you wear - sunder armor for a lvl 60 warrior is always going to do 260 threat and revenge does 315. Bear is much better in that regard, cause they get threat multiplier on their attacks, instead of fixed added value.
---
What? You always use hunters mark, then sting. Mobs die hella quick and you never have to drink. Occasionally multi shot if youre capped on mana.
---
Jumping on this same train.
---
Yeah when I play mage i usually give the lock both mana and water so if they are sensible they life tap some and eat+drin kat the same time to get a super fast regen.
---
What is the best class if i dont want to respec between PvE and PvP?
---
Can you quote me where in the original post I said anything about it being harder. 
---
I think you're misunderstanding what I'm saying. 
---
I implied that classic takes more work than retail. And in my opinion a better game. 
---
To which you jumped with M+ and ranked PvP was "harder in retail" to which there is no comparison.
---
We can take away M+, heirloom gear... Whatever. You cannot deny that 1-60 is easier in retail in every aspect. And that's all I'm saying.

I'd say that's the definition of skill to be able to use your character to the fullest and also manage to use the world and environment to your advantage.

tbh it just feels like when kids when they play and someone is better and they go like "Yeah but you can do that which no one else of us can, so now we won't allow it".

Again, I can't proof it, but I'm convinced the odds of getting a 100 - 100 - 100 - 100 are enormously less than getting a 100 - (any number below 70) - (any number below 70) - (any number below 70), since rolls above 70 usually win stuff. Can a statistician help me out, pls? I feel like this is the same problem as when someone says winning the lottery is a 50% chance, since you either win or you don't.
---
What? It's basic 6th grade maths, it's always gonna be 1% chance 
---
Just because a high number has value to you doesnt make it less likely to appear

Roll a D100 twice and it's gonna be 1% to hit 100 both times

the only info I can find says that there's high/medium/low prio debuffs.

I could never skill mining in classic, hitting the nodes 2-5 times is so tedious. There's something really satisfying about mining a large Thorium node, though, even if it takes half a minute.
---
You could count base material prices, possible fees and \~120g from transmute prices. Usually you can find it like 10-15% under what doing all the transmutes etc would cost individually.
---
Correct.

Ok well ur still not gonna reroll Alliance on Skeram hypocrite
---
Yes, the money you get increase significantly the closer you get to 40.
---
At 40 it's also a lot easier to farm gold in case you're missing some, as soon as I dinged 40 I was missing 5 gold, I farmed it in less than half an hour.
---
If you've not seen the census data, horde tends to almost always outnumber alliance on pvp servers.  There are a few with survey results currently suggesting an only minor horde advantage, but as with any self reporting, take that with a grain of salt.  If you insist on rolling alliance and pvp, just do some serious research before picking a server, because it really will be difficult to do almost anything end game related if you end up on one with a big horde advantage.
---
Time for a fun little anecdote.  I was originally on Mal'Ganis US for vanilla.  For most of the lifespan of vanilla, it was hugely horde dominated.  Eventually, around the time Nax started, a couple legit alliance guilds saw it as a challenge, and decided to migrate to our server to see if they could even it out.  And, they kind of did...  Let's just say, as an average player, and not a real serious hardcore with pvp or pve, I found myself trying to just avoid them whenever possible.  Most of the alliance population still wasn't much of a threat, but you always had to make sure it wasn't people from one of those serious guilds.  So although I've always been horde, I've kind of seen both sides.
---
Set up the group yourself. look for shamans, rogues and warriors. Any healer will do. With 4 good dps you can melt most packs in 40 second so damage taken individually isn't very high.
---
Healer does have to be good and may need to drink a few times but the dps doesn't so overall run time is good.
---
Because the ‘muh \#nOcHaNGeZ’-crowd got their way.
---
M U R L O C K S
---
The dps increase from ruin is so small until you acually get alot of hit and crit. Assume you have 15% crit, talents included. Ruin gives 33% more dmg on ur crits. = 5% dps increase
---
The only other class on Ally side that would realistically use a 2h in raiding would be the 2h fury spec for warriors. 2h fury is only really popular in the early raids/phases because people have less +hit gear making their dual weild autos miss a lot more. As a Ret Pally you'll likely have a monopoly on any 2h that drops if there's no other Ret pally.
---
Haha
---
Depends how serious they are about loot as 2Handers to to warriors for ranking in PvP usually, given try is just as bad in PvP as it is in PvE
---
&gt; Most people don't want balanced PvP, they want a massacre in their favor
---
No? Most people want it to be balanced buddy.

Great placement and straight line between mailbox and AH, which means i can do AH stuff easily with remote desktop from my smartphone.

Yeah, in case you dont know MC is on a weekly reset.. So 20 weeks raiding for an upgrade is nearly half a year

That would involve some level of social interaction and so would be against the spirit of the “challenge”?

Any Joy with this a resolution on this? I have the same problem, completed all the Mithril Order quests, got the trinket and the plans but don’t have the original Armorsmith Quest and none of the NPCs in Ironforge have a quest for me. I opened a ticket 2 days a go no response yet.

OK everyone, there seems to be some confusion here. I'm pretty sure OP is saying that he had BfA selected to check his game time and accidentally clicked play without changing back to Classic. He knows its the same time for both games, but wants to see it without selecting retail.

Havn't played Shaman myself, but 2H Enhancement seems super fun, It's not the best and kind of niche, but very very fun from what Ive seen/heard
---
I feel like that is just Horde culture.
---
Hunters can use the Dal'Rend Set.
---
 for all non-germans thats is not just jibberish
---
Streamer payo is levling an alliance alt on that server. Might help ya abit.
---
Ravager took my guild around 20 runs. Shoulders galore.
---
Yeah you gotta get into it.
---
Generally i advice all fellow alliance players on noggenfogger to stay.
---
Those datas should never be released since all it causes is that the pop difference gets even worse.
---
Now its unbalanced, yes blackrock is horde dominant but just stay and aid your faction..
---
Now its around 40/60. With all going because of the census it will end up at 20/80.
---
Yeah, it's AT least 10k gold
---
I really love Vanilla mounts. I love my kodo more than anything. In retail everyone is flying with discoball on steroids. Classic feels more modest.
---
I agree, that defeats the purpose. 
---
Unless you are on an empty server and that's gonna be fun for a few days at most.
---
I'm a depressed, lonely individual who hates his job and feels abandoned. I also suffer from chronic re-roll syndrome. Looking for a class to ruin people's day and/or make  it better, depending on my mood.
---
&gt; I offtanked on shaman by default up until RFD with little issue. I still wouldn't subject a random party to the bullshit that is the lack of aoe threat. And TBH, the dungeons before RFD are able to be easily small pulled, which is what makes this half viable.
---
To solve aoe threat you need to get Hand of Edward the odd and a few reflectitve pieces of gear ex: Skullflame Shield. Happy to answer any question im a Shaman Raid Tank.
---
Ah a fellow man of culture. The OSRS grind is wild compared to WoW.
---
If the addon gets unlocked again, an indicator for the current average level on each server per faction would be cool!
---
&gt;  How can a 250 enchanter with a few higher end enchants such as running  speed , demon slaying, and riding speed, compete with the 300 enchanters  that have all of that plus more? 
---
with lower prices
---
Unironically became my goal the second I saw this post. Poor as shit right now but I won't always be!
---
Really?  I'd say it's the alliance's fault for not being able to pose a threat worth respecting.

Mage, warlock, warrior, priest.  
---
I like big numbers and solo pvp.  
---
Warlock's big number/pvp spec is more of a gimmick (seduce+soul fire), and the dot/wand/drain sl life shtick becomes became boring really, really fast. I got a warlock to 27 and then tried forcing myself to play it, but I ended up just watching videos on youtube or doing work around the house to avoid playing it...  
---
Warriors do big numbers, but they are incredibly frustrating playing solo.. cc magnet, getting kited, using faps is mandatory to stand a chance against mages and hunters, stance dancing feels clunky...  
---
Priests are cool visually but shadow is a 1v1 one trick pony, basically useless for anything other than that, and gameplay isn't that enticing either (dots, shield, wand, warlock deja vu). They are also pigeonholed into healing for other content.   
---
Mages are overpopulated. I can't think of other cons.  
---
Have considered hunter, but I don't like relying on pet AI and having to deal with a deadzone.  
---
Playing Alliance so unfortunately Shaman isn't an option ( even though I feel like I'd like it more than Mage)  
---
Paladins lack damage and aren't on my top solo pvp list. Druids lack big numbers, and shapeshifting is a clunky mechanic. I also can't stand playing a rogue, hate stealth, hate rogues, hate rogue players.  
---
Guess it's a pick your poison type of deal, and the least deterring con seems to be the mage's overpopulation
---
Can you show me one of your posts please, I'd like to know what a high effort post is. Do I have to make fan art? Do I have to post a deep thought provoking argument? Here's one : you're kind of a dick. Why? Discuss...
---
Just be a gnome warrior
---
&gt; I'm so glad I'm alliance and I don't have to deal with shamans thinking their roles are viable. Lmao sorry horde players, you chose this life.
---
You are confusing the term viable and optimal.
---
38 is when it outpaces
---
Keep doing that and you will be able to afford it no problem.
---
How abt as hunter
---
Fury aint really a thing b4 aq40 gear
---
&gt; I was in a group with a shaman tank last night, he did extremely well. He had no problem holding aggro at all even against multiple targets. In 3 full runs of SM he lost aggro maybe 2 times at the most. And on top of that he did almost the exact same DPS as my hunter. Yes they have to stop and drink but so does the healer usually. Stopping for about 10 seconds to drink isn’t really a problem IMO.
---
If done properly the drinking time is actually 5 seconds.
---
I leveled in a lot of SP gear and I'm fairly certain it scales with SP, just not well compared to life tap. The reason it's bad at 60 isn't because the talent is bad but that Ruin (100% crit bonus) is practically mandatory and requires 21 points in destruction.
---
I'm looking for a vanilla pvp video. It was an elem shaman, tauren female. I believe she was using the ZG shield.
---
Any link ?
---
It's a separate ability iirc. It costs focus and is spammable. Intimidation is a separate spell with its own range requirement.
---
I played with a Badpriest on Herod. Any chance this is the same guy?
---
Classic Threat Meter needs other people to have it for it to work
---
That's why you tank with drain life. Gotta give that enemy all kinds of succ.
---
Ouch. How likely am I to get Benediction as one of the 4 holy priests in the guild? Is the drop rate abysmally low or?
---
Leave then. If faction balance isn't close 50 everything is gonna go bad real quick. Drop the server if you are alliance. And if you are horde please enjoy playing without alliance.
---
Look up Dive’s Drain Tanking Guide
---
warlock. huge variety in the class, many different specs, lots of different abilities to use so you won't get bored. can ruin peoples day by fearing them with 3 dots into groups of mobs whilst running alongside them doing /train. can also make people's day by summoning them all to a dungeon, summoning a random whisper to a city on the other side of azeroth, or giving the healer a soul stone so your whole group can revive inside the instance without a 10 min run.
---
An add on that screams at me when I need to re-equip argent down trinket in strat/scholo
---
&gt;So satisfying
---
I can see this even more so when you have a mage in your group :D
---
Eat mon
---
Priest or Rogue then. MC people off boats or buff people if you're feeling generous. Rogues are the ultimate class to fuck with people.
---
I worded it incorrectly, I meant that in a  vacuum there's gonna be same chance on 2 seperate rolls to get the same number. 
---
Gamblers fallacy, the dice has no memory etc
---
Yep
---
2.5 is the magic number 2.5 agi for every 1 ap. So if an item has 10 agi and one has 25 attack power, they both will give you the same attack in the end. Go with stone princess here, it's what my hunter wears.
---
Trust me, it gets worse
---
Seems like there's almost always 5-20 horde outside any of the high level instances
---
Hunter BIS lists are complete cancer. I posted yesterday about BIS lists but not many people agreed with me. Yeah this is a funny troll, but seriously, people look at these lists and think that its all correct.
---
If you're a hunter and you roll need on Hand of Justice over a melee DPS because "its BIS" then I'm sorry but you are complete trash.
---
Haha, seems like our servers are just parallell universes.
---
If you want to ruin people's days just play a rogue. Distract off ledges, ambush while they're at low hp/fighting mobs, be a general asshole.  
---
Otherwise, play a priest and mind control people off ledges, but this has a lower success rate than rogues.
---
Dual wield without any +hit gear? You love missing 90% of your attacks?
---
rogue's never make anyone's day better other than their own though.
---
Do you have to be 60 for that?
---
Lakad Matataaaaaag
---
LFM CAPS
---
As someone new to the game, how do you drain tank? I assume you need the talent that stops damage from interrupting drain life and maxed out drain life talent?
---
Mages might be overpopulated but I think when it comes to 60 there will be a big difference between the ones that really know Mage and the ones that just rolled it to try and do big numbers. Personally I started with Mage and then went to Priest and am having a lot of fun.
---
I’m actually about pull the trigger and buy one off the AH as it was stated in some BIS rogue guides that it’s the best stat item over the blackcrow (from LBRS +3 agi +1% hit) but still can’t make up my mind. What do you guys think? Which one should I go for? And if possible can anybody tell me how much hit do I need?
---
I’ve never seen this happen in the way you’re describing, always is people saying it beforehand in their LFG message or (worst case scenario) as soon as the person enters the party.  The latter is definitely annoying, but could very well occur by honest mistake.
---
So, you want people to level as Holy? Sadistic prick.
---
His name is Bluto Paulson
---
it’s medium at peak times as is Bloodfang, don’t kid your self Earthshaker has too many 60s already raiding and organized guilds from Gehennas. Bloodfang is a casual playground, how many of them will they stick around?
---
Come to Grobbulus, friend.  I rerolled from Thalnos and couldn't be happier. One of the best Horde/Alliance ratios out of all the realms and warm, inviting community. World pvp has been excellent.
---
there are some gobling on the upperside of the barrens, that when they are about to die they don't just move away trying to avoid death\\call for help, no, they run like usain bolt in his prime.
---
People are stupid because they didn’t hit 60 in this particular Videogame. Imagine thinking this unironically
---
I can’t fucking stand the succubus sounds in general, the whip crack just hurts my ears

I think you can just go to strahan in ratchet to pick up the wl quests, the trainers only send you in his direction
---
I'm not sure if the succ Q is from strahan, if not try undercity, that's where I got mine (but I'm undead wl)
---
Warlock sm/ruin is decent (not great) for both pve and pvp.  
---
Shamans are not great but still faster than warriors and paladins. They get some flavorful spells that makes leveling a bit more interesting (windfury and chain lightning being the top 2 coolest abilities you'll learn)
---
Yeah but he said and/or :P. Priest to be helpful and a troll, Rogues just to be a troll.
---
I watch one of the APES streamers from time to time.  Funny especially when he's leveling alts.  He'll just charge random skull horde.  Some will make him explode.  Some will just start messing with him.  One time I watched one follow him around killing quest enemies he tagged.

Damn I'm gonna try that, but don't think I can part with mouse wheel click for autowalk
---
Did you rethink what you thought on that?
---
Yea, you're totally right about that. And we have the element of surprise aswell so we have alot of advantage. We had some People dc, other than that it was pretty smooth :)
---
Honestly, The best way to approach those servers is literally to have alliance reroll/quit away from that server to more balanced ones. Some PvP servers have 0 chance at recovery.
---
But yes, Once the honor system is released and the people "expect" world PvP these people are going to whine like crazy. And it's gonna be their own fault.

You mean BFD?

While the first 2 parts are defiently worth, the rest of the aprts involve ALOT of travel and they are all elite quests..

While i can wholeheartedly recomend the Qline for just having done it (the ending is pretty cool). I dont think its very exp efficient.

You should add a /petfollow to this to avoid any fuckery
---
It has happened to me 5 times thus far. 4 of which were in SM. All 4 I quit the group and hearthed home(as the healer). I don't put up with that bullshit, you don't get someone to make it all the way to a dungeon then tell them that they can't roll on an item they want. I made it clear before the run that I wanted mograine's might and would roll on it, if that was a problem don't take me. Twice, they ML the fight to make sure I couldn't roll on it and I hearthed mid fight after making sure that's what they were doing.

Saving for later. Thanks!

Well as a lvl 60 horde on Gandling from my experience so far i can say that at level 60 there are slightly more alliance than horde players but at lower levels horde are more. I know it is too general but that's how it feels so far.
---
This is heartwarming , I’m happy for you brother!
---
So you say you need it for your greed and want a person, that would equip it instantly sell it if you won it? That just sounds greedy.
---
Stop being a fucking baby
---
i meant that these kind of guilds preserve the realms health longterm, but it’s your call anyway
---
No its not, fury needs ap gear, 2hand crit is way more than double dmg with all the rage you get. Kungen was also mentioning this a few days ago
---
The drop rate for main hand seems way lower than off hand. Did 21 runs so far seen 3 off hands and no main hands yet
---
Good hunters carry a set of 1h'd dual wields (Dalrend Set) for melee and slow 2h stat stick and swap in and out as needed. Hunters can also make use of HoJ. Who are you people to dictate what a player can equip their Hunter with/need on. Most of you just sound salty.
---
Listen dude. Just reroll if ur a real man u dont need friends or all that /played back. You just need to roll Alliance and singlehandedly take down the Horde on Skeram so we can all sleep at night
---
Went over my head, too, then, sorry. I didn't down vote you, though.

Lvl 40

And 7 lvl 5. I mostly use them as my storage system. For now at least...
---
Ele---what? Gambler Addict Enhancement or get out 😤
---
PvP mage is pretty fun, but again - Frostbolt is kind of essential to land, you arent going to kill someone with only your instants, and fireballs are kind of only used as a R1 ability to keep rogues from Vanishing for too long.
---
If you don't care about min-maxing it's decent, 2h fury/slam/arms is basically based on what 2hander you can get your hands on. It's mostly a way to improve your guilds overall DPS without having 5-10 warriors/rogue fight for the same weapons drops each tier.
---
2h is very competitive for horde due to windfury.
---
Death by "Num *".
---
Rogue combat swords is pretty good. It’s a decent PvP class especially in a group setting, it’s probably the best rogue spec for fighting other melee classes like warriors especially if you take riptose, and doesn’t require you to be behind the person. Granted it’s probably not quite as strong as seal fate daggers, Hemo, or ambush spec, but I played this class in vanilla and really thrived, especially once my gear got good.
---
Well same can be said about enhancement shammies, you just don't take them.
---
It depends, really. There are a ton of different factions with great rep rewards that all have different ways of earning rep, not all of them necessarily have quests for you to do. Some require you to kill certain mobs, or farm certain items which you can then turn in. Your best bet would probably be to look up a reputation guide on wowhead to see just what factions there are and what rewards they offer. It's just too much information to put in one comment :) [This](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/wow-classic-neutral-faction-and-reputation-overview) should have all the info you need!
---
Good old *my face to your fists style*
---
Hate most: shadowdamage immunity.
---
Love most: dryads for that death sound.
---
the problem I have is most mages down rank their water, think we wont notice, so we end up drinking expensive shit as to not make a scene.
---
Also you can earn some gold on it. On most servers you can buy silk cloth for less than 2s
---
Then make bandages and vendor them (vendor price of silk cloth turned into bandage is 2s)
---
As a warlock, I would have such an easy time if I had a spammable, strong slow that isn‘t locked deep in the affliction tree wasting five points
---
&gt;Alot of that comes from prehotting
---
And Swipe. Warrior AoE taking would be much easier if Sunder armor was hitting 3 targets at once.
---
I just stop healing a lock that lifetaps during combat in dungeons after they get aggro on a pull.
---
If you can't manage your aggro, you can't manage your lifetap, and I won't manage someone like that.
---
It saddens me deeply that I have one toon and he is only Level 29. Curse you adult life!
---
Which one are you sticking with? I finally decided to stick with Warrior, let's see how long that self-promise holds tho
---
During the Herod fight in SM armory, sometimes 4 extra mobs will run into the boss room and cause us to wipe. We always make sure the door is closed but that doesn’t seem to stop these extra adds. This happens every few runs or so and nobody I’ve talked to is able to explain it. Is there a mechanic we are missing or is this just a bug?
---
Not only that, most of the classes do not have their key abilities and talents to speed up levelling as well. As a warlock, I dinged 40 yesterday, and with mount+dark pact things really speed up. Instead of 5 hours per level, it will probably take 2-3 hours.
---
Lmao yall sound like refugees
---
I think it is a couple of things. The pet basically forgetting how to attack a target once it moves is one of the biggest issues, in my opinion.
---
Im just getting started. Obviously i leveled my main to 60 first, did some instance grind with it. 
---
Started 5 man multiboxing last week, still trying to figure out how to do it properly and setting it up. 17 warr, 16 priest, 2x 16 mages and 16 warlock coming up nicely tho. Did RFC (-2 levels to current), it was fine. Now that i have arcane explosion on mages, it makes more sense to kill multiple mobs.
---
When i was in STV i cooked a lot and gave some to classes that have a hard time leveling and no healing.  
---
Gave a guy 20 food, he thanked me they run straight to the npc ... i asked him if he sold the meat i gave him "Yeah lol, it was worth 60 silver" ... never again ...
---
**Now we can finally play the game!**
---
It is normal for Classic do you not get that?
---
It used to be like that and they tried recreate it. The game doesn't become better because things run smoother. The game becomes better because you have more challenges to overcome and things take their time and are sometimes a bit annoying :p
---
That is simply how the humand psychology works. You feel more rewarded if it was annoying and take their time. 
---
I mean afterall that is the game we asked for. With the least changes possible. I'm happy the way it is tbh. I know it used to be like that and I got it.
---
If everything was perfect smooth I could go Play on a private Server where frontstabbing was also a thing
---
It's also compatible with all GPU's instead of just Nvidia.
---
Horrible idea, half the people will take any gold from there group for there own good and not honk twice about it that’s why they Need on everything that’s in there profession and what not. Now we got to tally up all the dis enchants throughout the whole dungeon just to make sure some random doesn’t take one for himself unfairly? Not to mention groups getting disbanded or someone having to leave early just messes up that idea even more. 
---
80% chance Enchanter gets more/all loot.
---
Whoooosh
---
Depends on the class. Anyting above 40 is easier than the rest for warlock and mage. Perhaps some other classes as well.
---
locks can steal their pets mana

Where do you get first aid over 150. I have silk bandage but where from there?
---
Actually Prot pally ironically is the most entertaining.
---
Nooooo not sock aids. What leatherworker or tailor can make for us to prevent it protect us by from the Sock Aids?
---
for melee*
---
alright then.
---
&gt;the longest player stun in the game
---
Not 100% correct. Dark Iron Pulverizer (blue craftable hammer) can proc a 8sec(!) stun. It\`s a proc, and very low chance - but it still exists.
---
Everyone knows horde needs 3 times the numbers to "dominate"
---
Bot the absolute worst but the naga in Arathi near Faldirs Cove are annoying as shit. They drowned me multiple times while searching the ships and getting gems with their damn nets.

Onyxia was also downed by a pug raid of 24 people

You can endlessly apply SL to the pet again and you most likley only sacrifice VW to put out your felhunter against a shaman.

SL locks are banned in 1v1 tourney's for a reason.

Thanks.

Please tell me he was a troll shaman?
---
My first time playing WoW and my friends all told me to save my money and make sure I had my mount straight away. Spent 40 levels picking up everything and only buying minimal frost spells for my mage. Literally hit 90g about 2/3 of the way through 39.
---
This one is actually extremely likely. 50% chance for the eye to drop from the domo chest.
---
Do you know the meaning of the word dominated?
---
There's a server meme on Argent Dawn where people have started role playing doors. [Taken from 8-Brit's comment on r/wow a month ago:](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/cvgwr1/just_another_day_at_argent_dawn_eu_rp_taken_to/ey4sjqe/)
---
&gt; A few years ago an edgy gang guild tried to claim they owned a bar in Stormwind. This usually never gets taken seriously as it's a public RP spot and therefore you can't stop people coming on as normal.
---
&gt; They decided they were going to do something about it. Their solution? Recruit some poor new roleplayer on the server and tell him to roleplay as a door. Having him stand in front of the empty doorway (WoW should really steal XIVs doors tbh) and block people from entering.
---
&gt; It initially worked, as people prefer to stay in character and not cause a fuss. Then the server at wide caught on and they were mocked from Icecrown to Pandaria. Orgrimmar to, well, Stormwind.
---
&gt; Pretty soon people started rolling door character alts, setting up RP add-on profiles ranging from simply being called 'a door' all the way to extremely intricate history pages depicting how the door was made and it's "life story" up to now. The majority of these would block both entrances to the bar the guild claimed to own. So you'd have about fifteen people now roleplaying everything from normal human doors to pandaren doors to gnomish doors and so on, trying to block these guys from their own hangout.
---
&gt; They even followed the guild briefly to their new hangout, where they quickly decided to abandon their own door idea, mostly after we started following them well away from any walls or doorways. They'd turn a corner and see dozens of "door" characters littering the pavement. Amidst this we had people remark on the top notch security at each bar in question, or how their owners seemed to import the finest doors from across the world.
---
&gt; That and we had some people emote extensively and in great detail whenever someone interacted with one of the doors (dunking on the guy that just walked to one side). Or just "/y creaks" as a play on the "/y gunshot" meme from Stormwind. Someone yelled back out of character "ARE PEOPLE ROLEPLAYING DOORS NOW WHAT THE FUCK".
---
&gt; Eventually it died down, mostly because the guild stopped doing their absurd little idea and we didn't see any need to continue. But to this day you'll occasionally find someone dedicated to roleplaying as a door...
---
are you 11 years old?

HATERS HEAL HIM!
---
Downrank what? Consec is more mana-efficient at higher ranks.
---
The wowhead census is pretty wildly inaccurate, it lists kromcrush as 52-48 horde favoured and my scans (2 accounts) running simultaneously started around 60-40 horde favoured and are now more leaning 65-35.
---
Make a cast macro and it’s done. 
---
Just don’t define the spell rank and it will always use the highest rank.
---
My favorite death sound is still female undead
---
Level 33 Warrior as my main
---
Level 21 Priest that I level with my best friend's warrior
---
Level 18 Rogue that I level only to do leather working, because I like professions
---
I know, it could be way worse, but I just don't have the time to play that I used to.

What does Ret Paladin have beside SoC and JoC?

But they are OFFENDED!!! That means they have moral superiority and the offenders MUST BE PUNISHED

---
So you are saying that Gnomes contribute the same as other for just being Gnomes while the other have to have something special aswell to contribute?
---
I know the history of hunter bis melee weapons. It's usually 2 1 handers with 1% crit and 20-36 attack power or smth. If you go ranged only, that is
---
During your rotation, there's a 2.5-2.8 second break between your second to last autoshot and your last autoshot before aimed. During this, you can go into melee and hit him hard once. I'll want to try this out really, maybe get 1 wing clip and 1 melee hit. For horde chars, you can proc windfury. Allies might better just use raptor strike.
---
What I'm saying is, we hunters should try to use a big 2 hander instead, even if we might lose 1 % crit (thinking eye of nerub vs kingsfall/hatchet of sundered bone. 
---
For now, still, that polearm is better than this dual wield setup. I'd not really take these swords over a melee, like, never. You need both of them to even use them, not just 1..

---
Nah it's definitely "I made a forsaken character, and we're supposed to be assholes." How many people honestly even today pay attention to what race you're "supposed to pick" especially among all the people just back to the game after a long hiatus.
---
No problem. Thanks for the list! I’ll check the list out again tonight and get me some new recipes.
---
You will always start to hate a class when you play it for too long.
---
I love warlock(51). But i started to hate the rotation even tho i used to love it. So i made a break and started to lvl a rogue(21).
---
The most important thing imo is to know if youre the type of player to rush 60 with one class or if you rather lvl 2 or 3 chars together. I for example am the 2-3 chars lvler. Slowly but steady i will reach 60 like this and never lose fun.
---
I'd be very surprised if that was accurate. I feel like I meet equal numbers of horde and ally on Gandling.
---
Let me guess 58 Hunter on his first run.
---
I prefer equal amounts of food and water and use a macro for eating both, way faster than just doing one.
---
inb4 no shoes zug zugging about red is dead XD
---
its easy to be a pvp god when half of the alliance is afraid of anything thats not a yellow mob and the horde have better pvp racials
---
LOL, I had exactly this situation yesteday... I bought a guild tabard.
---
I fixed this problem. Also on Dreadmist EU
---
If you're on plusnet. I had to switch to a static IP. This can be done on the website for a £5 charge. But this 100% fixed it. I was getting it very frequently. 5 days so far no issue.
---
Imagine being mad at the Horde for PvPing on a pvp server instead of being mad at the migrating cowards care-bears who used the server transfers designed to avoid queue times to move because they were tired of dying lol
---
He should’ve let you play tbh. I would let my nephew play on my account if he wanted to. Just make a new char if afraid of kids ruining the account. Even if kids do, worth the price of letting younglings in the family have some fun with the game you like.
---
First time I got into a rpg game was when I got to play D2 on my cousins pimped out account. Thnx cos.

I'm a paladin on a PVE server. Two people in my dungeon group had their PVP flag on and were not getting my Devotion aura. Is this a bug? (we were inside the dungeon instance)
---
Not sure what your level is, but in the beginning you don't really have a lot of options. Bloodthirst has a cooldown and charge (if you have the talent to keep the rage) doesn't provide that much. You basically have to hope for a few seconds of time to get enough rage before mobs start peeling from you.
---
Of all the warlocks we've run with (a lot. Pretty much one every group) I can count on one hand the number that don't just tap their life away then all out nuke or hellfire the moment a pull happens and never eats/drinks/cannibises/bandages. Most don't even seem to use a healthstone. 
---
If you want smooth dungeon runs/spam you play around the bad players. As healer and tank it's a bit like babysitting for all the mages and warlocks who leveled through spell cleave and never learned their class.
---
Don't blame the healer, tell them in chat you don't need topping off and will manage your own life or something. Communication goes a long way!
---
Yeah thats what I thought. I'm feral druid and can't see getting into many dungeons as dps tbh
---
No rogues make other rogues days aswell.
---
Generally, engineering items are allowed, but using pots can be a dick move, and people won't be happy.
---
It’s already in classic.
---
Wait, drain life gets better than wands after level 38?
---
Yup, do 2-3 farming sessions in STV or Arathi (tigers and turtle if u wanna level cooking) and youll be fine.
---
love druid tanks ! and this is just one reason out of many
---
Not in BfA, Unending Breath was too OP so it was removed
---
Mana
---
*laughs but still rage starved*
---
What's the rough surprise? You're gonna sulk?
---
As a rogue, any mob that sticks a 30 second damage tick poison on me about a second before it dies. I don't have any easy way of removing it so I have to sit and wait for it to pass before I can get back into stealth.
---
As a holy paladin. I find it easiest to heal a Druid. Only because most warriors/paladins are not Prot yet. High dps classes are always ripping threat from non prot warriors and paladins.
---
Spoiler: It doesn't
---
Wait, since when did FF14 have an RP mode?
---
Classic case of gambler's fallacy  - https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_fallacy
---
Each roll is independent from each other, the odds of rolling 100 is the same for each /roll you do, 1%. Because there is a 99% of not rolling a 100 the perception is that you waste your 100 roll because chances are far greater to roll less than 100 than it is to roll 100.
---
It is also false to believe that one will roll high because he has had numerous low rolls. Or that one runs out of RNG for a couple of months because 2 lucky events happened in a short period of time.
---
I’m not sure what you are bragging about. Killing him 1v3?
---
Succ while solo, imp (occasionally felhunter) in groups.
---
Did you accept that you would do it, despite them never offering compensation?
---
Can someone ELI5 layering?
---
Judging by the characters I'm pretty sure you are in my guild
---
Woa, didnt realise runecloth bandages were that powerful! Any idea how much you spent getting from 100-300? I know you can farm cloth through just general questing, but I might splash out and fast track into the 200’s.
---
im so confused
---
They'd probably die way faster than you cast a healing spell anyway, while running around like a chicken, dazed.
---
Sticking with? That's not how this game is played 😎
---
Yes, the grey mist in Darkshore is unbearable. Quested there, it felt like I played an horror game. Going into Ashenvale I was like "Dang! It actually looks okay without it."
---
Playing wow is interacting with other humans
---
For talents you dont need winters chill and 3/3 blizzard is imo better
---
My husband is a druid and I'm a warlock. It's great.
---
Imo don't worry too much about the professions yet.
---
Try reddit
---
You join and suspiciously one of the dps Mages is already dead....Hmmmm
---
/me cries in druid.
---
Also, I forgot any mob that has a pummel/interrupt ability, especially Shield Bash (8 sec interrupt). Pretty bad for a warlock spamming a highly buffed Shadowbolt
---
You need to learn the portal spell for each city by traveling there and buying it from the trainer first. Then you can just go and buy runes which will allow you to cast the spells. Some locations also have higher level reqs needed to learn the spells than others
---
I had this happen today. 
---
 I was chopping down raptors with my quiver
---
I was getting some shit last night...it eventually worked. Don't know if related or not 🤷
---
I hate to be that guy but it u wanna quickly travel to Un'Goro and you have a retail character, talk to Blingotron and select the dialogue option for "Let's Party" hell send u to Un'Goro and give u a dope costume!
---
Save money by farming the mats. That’s what vanilla is about man. It’s an endless grind. Enjoy the grind!
---
no one cares
---
Ony can be 4 manned.
---
Didn't ask him to kick anyone just asked the guy to believe, and believe he did. 
---
(it was for ZF so it's not like the guy who got kicked wont find another group)
---
39 warrior (stuck in “dont level without me” purgatory)

---
Just go on your own adventure this time. Roll on a populated server, join a guild, make new friends.
---
I know I have retail friends on like 10 different servers, we still shoot the shit on discord but I’m not going to let their enjoyment of classic hamper mine.
---
LET’S AGGRO! LET’S AGGRO! CAN’T USE LIFE TAP ANYMOOORE!
---
i always sit down to eat/drink when needed but then i still get healed to full ^^
---
Depends on the group. If you have a bunch of dps that don't know what they do, have to try and hit mobs 4+ levels above them and can't interrupt healing mobs even if the cast takes 5 seconds, your pulls will take ages, the healers mana will run low on every other pull and it will be a horrible experience all around.
---
If you get a group with competent players, just let that focus target go at half health, it will die before doing any serious damage. The caster mobs over there will get sheeped or interrupted and pulled in and if someone gets aggro who can't take it will get saved by one of the many abilities your group has to deal with those situations. Your job as tank will be pretty boring and the healer might chime in wanding or whacking stuff to death, but it will be a fast and easy run.
---
Because, and this is just an observation... the main focus of layering isn't just thinning out the servers playerbase but also making sure that there is not a pvp clusterfuck... i've changed layers  a couple of times now intentionally (not on login or something i mean) and i've noticed there are horde and alliance layers.
---
Nah just the color.
---
Kek
---
Four mobs spawn in the hallway just before Herod once you engage the fight, and despawn once you finish it. If a shaman leaves a totem out in the hallway it will pull these mobs and they will run into the room, and in most cases screw up the fight resulting in a wipe. Make sure your shaman moves their totems into the actual boss room to not have this happen, at least that has fixed it for me the few times it has happened.
---
Wow, and I thought I was no lifing with my 55 mage....  This some next lvl shiz......
---
Level 20 Alliance rogue.
---
* Are poisons always used? They have limited amounts of charges and applying them to your weapon takes time, so i'm wondering if there are cases when other temporary weapon buffs are better
---
* Is dagger build viable for leveling? Frontstabbing doesn't work, so it's just ambush and gouge+backstab, but i'm not sure if it's worth it. I find combat/swords a bit dull
---
What is the priest doing there? Just get a 4th warrior and let the shaman heal!
---
Are there any quest axes for warriors that are close to the lvl 30 warrior quest weapon on the horde side? Getting the charms is impossible on the overcrowded servers, and I didn't hear good things about the Herod axe drop rate...so I'm a bit scared I will be stuck with my Razorfen axe forever.
---
i agree and did that until they started targeting others with bullshit silence mass reports that blizzard doesnt care to fix because 'uhhh a lot of people reported you' like yea thats my fuckin point
---
Sad post. Youre sad. Why you happy you won a 3x1?
---
It doesnt sell on horde either. Had it up for 2.5g on ah for several days now. At this point ive lost money on it. Should have DEd or vendored it long ago.. Tho i might just mimic your trick and make it someone elses problem.
---
I'm not sure if it's intentional that it's not working in an instance, but as far as open world content is concerned I believe it's intended to prevent non flagged players from buffing and healing pvp players
---
Or you just use Auto shot and Multi shot (aimed) instead of mark/sting and have Zero downtime and also kill enemies quicker. I am not wasting gcd on sting if the enemy isnt even alive for 15 seconds. If you are Opening with Auto attack and aimed shot you dont even have much time left for casting Serpent sting.
---
Never had Problem with downtime or pet aggro (Maybe 1 in 10 Mobs because I lucky crit 2 shots in a row, in which case the mob is down to 1/3 Health anyways)
---
I thought I was doing ok having two level 28s
---
What if You are a mage, does that makes it xp efficient?
---
I assume you're playing as alliance due to your flair, the problem is with shaman totems as i explained in my response to the original comment.
---
Arcane resistance to resist poly
---
Thats why you vendor it until then. Gives good money
---
That was my thought as a healer as well. If it's not the same DPS then I'd rather use my mana to allow them to do more damage and then drink with me after the fight. Otherwise it sounds like a kind of a lazy method. Like if a melee was just auto-attacking.
---
In a raid, however, I probably wouldn't have the mana to spare.
---
Don't level as anything other than drain tank.
---
as a horde i just called it Gnome. Spamming "LFM Gnome" worked
---
Those are my weekend mornings. Usually it's 9pm bed,  4am wake. Love it.
---
this has to be a troll post right? how can someone be so far up his own ass? did your mom drop you to often??
---
Black crow isn't even good for hunters, what are you on my dude
---
Burnt out at level 20?
---
I just walked around and smacked random shit on stream. By the time you're done doing any of the things you'll easily be 60. Couple Dungeon runs hunting gear etc.   
---
50-60 is the best grind.
---
Sounds like burn out to me. Either save your pennies or find a fresh group of people to play with. Personally I play WoW mostly as an independent escape. I group with folks but my enjoyment of the game is also my own adventure, something retail WoW is tuned to over classic.
---
Thanks! I'll take a look at the guide you linked.
---
I'm having trouble too, EU.
---
So then it's a huge DPS loss if the healer doesn't keep the warlock up. Doesn't sound like a good warlock then.
---
Blue is better
---
best fucking zone in the game  
---
can't change my mind  
---
every single toon of mine pre-cata leveled there
---
And then you get too much gear and dual wield so you can actually get rage lul
---
Why do you feel the need to bullshit people? They are statistically more difficult from the simple fact you don't have 5 people in full heirlooms with trinkets running DM in 10 minutes at level 15.
---
Do you think you're a badass for saying the dungeons are "mind numbingly easy"? 
---
I've got news for ya bud, raids are gonna be the same for you. Might as well pack it up and head back to that benthic roulette.
---
The burn out wasn’t from the game it was because the guild I made collapsed then I rerolled on a new server and the guild I had then joined collapsed
---
I made a priest, got him to 32, got bored, made a rogue, got him to 31, and during that time leveled my priest to 34, then I got on a bit of a roll with the priest and hit 40 last night, and in that time I also made a warrior that's level 12. Haven't touched the rogue in a bit, so he has a full level of rested going. 
---
If my wife ever decides she wants to play instead of just watch, I'll be rolling a shaman or a hunter to play with her.
---
Yeah, it definitely helps when you're getting XP but either way you'll be in for some classic grindy grinds with nothing but bone dust to show.
---
I started on Razorgore as a shaman (my first ever horde char) with some friends, I ended up getting to 12-13 even with 3 hour queues. I realised I made a mistake and was super burnt out, didnt enjoy the class and my faction. Switched to alliance, decided to play a warrior as it was my first character. Now I am around 50 and been enjoying the game immensely. Current play time is about 6 days in about 20-25 days. I recommend playing a class you enjoy and switching faction/server if necessary.
---
I once met a human priest in Westfall who had the night elf texture Bug in his face.
---
I still make up at night, haunted by this monstrosity
---
Nice. I thought we were 1.12 and the silithus stuff was 1.13 which isn't in game currently and assumed some other stuff isn't either. I guess I have the numbers mixed up. Working on the quest now.
---
Alliance or horde?
---
damn son i'll for sure be doing that
---
Uldaman and rfd
---
From last census (maybe it was EU only tho) it was almost perfectly even overall.
---
Btw Alliance tends to outnumber Horde on PvE servers, while Horde tends to outnumber Ally on PvP servers.
---
The auto report is a system I always hated. But I give it zero chance that blizz will fix it.
---
its pretty good..and protects your brain
---
I believe this is indeed a problem with having PvP enabled. Have had it happen with my Battle Shout not applying to a party member due to him not being PvP flagged. I play on a PvP server, but as Tirisfal Glades is not a contested zone, you're not automatically flagged. The other four of us had been in PvP combat outside Scarlet Monastery and were therefore flagged.
---
;)
---
It seems you may haven't recovered yet from burnout or maybe you're still sad/disappointed for what happened to you.
---
In this case only time can heal your "wounds".
---
Don't push yourself, get a longer break and come back when you feel you're missing the game a lot.
---
Obligatory keybind comment number#1
---
Stob bitching towards the ones who freely boosted you, tank.
---
I've finished questing there last night. I was with a friend and we took like four sessions of many hours to end all the quests from the Gnome and the Elf camping on Webwinder path, sending you last in the Charred Vale. Hordes were hard on ours lvl 23 asses but the final reward was worth all of it. We were feeling pretty proud, being sent to meet Tyrande after all of this.
---
That’s what I was thinking, so far I have played warrior and shaman and they haven’t really been that fun for me so I think I’ll just think about what I want to play
---
Doing quests in the starter area until you reach the first town will net you 5 levels within 30 minutes played. 
---
I feel like running to an inn at L1 to get rested xp and then having to return to the starting area to kill the L1 mobs (L6 around the area of the first in it's a bit high for a L1 character) is counterintuitive and will probably take more time overall.
---
healing, blessings, auras?
---
Thank you. Submission Turned On Permanently.
---
He asked me clearly for a portal, I said sure mate, went to the vendor to pick up some more runes, and he asked the cost of the rune, I said 18 silver, he comes up to me and trades me exactly 18 silver.  
---
This happens close to never, but to see it happens actually fucking  pisses me off.   
---
Asking for someones services, it should be common sense to give something back for a service.
---
int gives a little mana and a tiny tiny bit of crit
---
always +spell/shadow dmg
---
My limited info from census confirm this. Timing of Phase 2 will be crucial, if majority of Horde players will be still in thier 40ies, when it hits, it can scew ratio in Alliance favor. Otherwise it gets pretty even, or in Horde favor. In any way, phase 2 will be gloriuos.
---
The trinket does much more for melee than hunters, and isn't really BiS.
---
Blight it! All the way to Bashal’Aran!
---
yeah, gotta agree with you, as a healer, there is nothing worse than having to heal 3 targets instead of 1 tank.  AOE damage cannot be avoided, thats fine....Its easy enough if the tank marks mobs, so everyone knows the kill order....but DPS who refuse to wait till the tank has aggro are bad for the party.  Healers will go oom fast, even when using mana pots and mp5 food!
---
you only use imp shield block lvl 1, it only increases the duration at lvl 2 or 3
---
One of the things that remember on vanilla was a 57 mage with barons undead mount. He ran that one time and got it. Some people are just born lucky
---
We basically live in a real life Barrens so it's more familiar.
---
Goblins exist, and i trust them more.
---
Wait, I saw exactly that on here about a week ago
---
I dunno. If I'm dueling, generally, it's because I want to see how I'd fare against a specific class of the opposing faction...so I'd use anything I had to kill them. If there are no terms set pre-duel I'd assume anything goes?
---
Dal'rend is a valid complaint since it's a terrible option, but Hand of Justice, there's literally no DPS alternatives unless you're Horde.
---
Ah yes, but how do you pronounce it? Feralas, Feralas or Feralas?
---
I love the RP macros. I also use the soulstone icon for mine!
---
41 Warlock, 42 hunter, 26 mage.
---
HOJ only gives a hunter +20 AP. The main attraction of the item is useless for a hunter. 
---
To need this item for +20 AP when you will never make use of the melee bonus is a shitty thing go do. 
---
Like I said, your only reason for wanting to roll need is because "it's Bis"
---
1) you don't actually know this. You just seen it on a list, probably the same list that says Dal Rends are BIS for hunter 
---
2) blackhands breadth is so much better 
---
Do your own research instead of being a stupid sheep who can only write 3 lettwrs, which are "b" "i" and "s"
---
Hell yeah brother! I’m a few bars from 58. Making my final push this week. Wish me luck haha
---
Google "warrior leveling spec wow classic" and just follow a guide. This will save you time and money.
---
I play a feral druid, I'm not the best tank, but definitely not the worst either. Had a ZF run the other day with two dps warriors in the group, one asked to offtank so they could have rage, so we marked their target. Could've gone really well, except people weren't really following the marks (even after being asked to prio), and I was rage starved most pulls. It still went okay - we got all the bosses first try, and only wiped on a trash pull were one too many groups added (paladin healer DIed &lt;3). 
---
Maraudon is up next. And yet, I've been hiding in Feralas for two days now...
---
Same thing happened to me. was leveling a priest with a friend, just got to lvl 40 and got my mount. my friend told me he felt burnt out and was gonna play other games for a few days.
---
Fine ill just start an alt and wait for him. Had a itch to play a warrior so i did that. Got to lvl 12 and lost all drive to play.
---
Until a few days later i logged in my warrior to see if i had mail, only to see that crossroad was being raided by a lvl 60 and the ground was covered in corpses. Got on my priest and tried my best to kill him, thats when i realised i enjoyed my priest so much more, playing daily since then
---
Tldr; be careful with alts, they can burn you out
---
No videos sorry. My usual route was just run straight ahead into the large room with all the demon dog patrols. Once all 4 patrols are dealt with just work your way around the left side of the big room to avoid the extra trash pulls that lead to The Interrogator's jail area.
---
There is a shortcut you can take but it is possible to aggro and wipe if ou are bringing people around level 51-52. Use the shadowforge key to open the 2 gates on the left as you enter the instnace, along with the door that leads to the bridge mechanism. You can go up the ramp there, clear the 2 fire elemental patrols, and then run up to the uppper ring of arena area. The mobs up there are hostile though, so you gotta hug the left side as you move up, and jump down into the arena, thus skipping all the trash. You will run into instance reset timer doing this very quickly though.
---
It's ok, I don't care for these internet points anyways. Anyone who sees this message is free to downvote me. Heck I dare you.
---
After spending alot of time on priv serves this go around I'm taking my time. I'm only lvl 35 now I only get to play once ever few days but when u am playing there nights I dont even gain any xp. I'm just going around fishing,helping low lvl friends with quests or just hanging around. It's honestly the most fun I've had in a long time just sorta chilling out and taking it slow
---
Keep in mind this post is very outdated by now though and new numbers cannot be mined due to blizzard breaking the census add on
---
Not in vanilla, u cant rename pet
---
Chivalary has a point though. Travel and assembling is a big time consumer
---
As a fellow warlock i love the UI! which one is it ?
---
Well played Sir, well played indeed
---
Lady Onyxia Prestor has to do something with it.
---
&gt; Engie things is ok 
---
There is a word for such thing, "hypocrisy"
---
The problem is because there are multiple layers, the market is flooded with resources that wouldn't normally be an easily accessible. Things should balance out when layering is removed and the market normalises.
---
Dont bother too much with expensive patterns while levelling. In a few levels you will get a new and better one. If you can get your hands on some rare patterns for sime reasonable silvers, check if there is a marked for it. Personally I've only made the Robe of Power for my Mage. Other than that I've been sparingly using the cloth. Bags can turn a few silvers every now and then.
---
Ambush is viable for levelling, but you need a macro to equip a sword when sinister striking, otherwise it's very inefficient.
---
castsequence no longer works if I'm not mistaken :D
---
Actually probability is more complicated than that
---
I took the same picture and showed my friend today. I don't remember that place looking so good back in vanilla.
---
Personally that is why my alt druid is remaining unguilded but my main warlock is almost 60 and we start MC this week.
---
Note: current guild my warlock is in was a guild of folks that did some dungeons with me while I was in a different guild at the time.  When that other guild collapsed I was taken with wide arms from this one so there's hope.
---
This would have crashed the server in Vanilla.
---
I sometimes feel like this. I have targets to reach, and when I hit them, I kinda stand around and lose focus. So I log out and go do something else. Cycling, gym, play with the kids, go for a walk.....anything. Then when I do come back in a day or so, I'm dying to play again. I'm only upto level 47, with a long way to go...prob at least 2-3 more weeks before I am 60.
---
Corpsemaker drops in RFK which is really solid up until you get Ravager. The droprate isn't amazing, I believe I saw about 4 drops in some 20-25 runs. If you're doing melee cleave in SM Armory from 36 to 40 you should have it by 40. If not I'd recommend staying in Armory until you get it as most groups see it as an absolute requirement to get invited to SM Cathedral/Zul'Farrak melee cleave groups. For Corpsemaker you might be best off looking for specific Corpsemaker farm groups until you get it, limiting downtime. Also drops Tusken Helm which is quite solid until you get Raging Berserker's helm from Herod.
---
Sarcasm.
---
Not in vanilla unfortunately, rename scrolls were introduced in TBC (inscription).
---
You dont have to be a guild leader, just saying.
---
But the only reason he hadn't learned it yet is because he's too greedy to buy it.
---
Even without wow I would do this for at least a year and be set for life.  Only issue is I think I would like it too much and never come back.
---
Thank you! I am 260 alchemy, so I will make some and try. 🙂
---
I’m still sad they removed texture clipping by mounting. This is one of the only easter eggs we have left to access.
---
All of these occurrences have happened with a shaman in the group. We clear all the trash so this may explain it. Thank you for the response.
---
There really aren't. DKs are extremely easy to avoid.
---
But there's only enough points to go 120, 120, 60 or 120, 90, 90. Should I stick to 120 Frost and Shadow or should I sacrifice 30 resistance in one of them to get 30 more in Arcane?
---
Yeah not having some sucks. Single target works well and I've got a lot of utility but yeah been if I was tanking I'd choose a warr or rogue over a feral dps.
---
That said I ran a full 5man druid group in ZF the other day and it was brilliant lol zero downtime with interesting the healer, off tank and off heal all over the place, mobs melted too
---
I am enjoying benediction. High pop on evenings, but no queues.
---
There was a dagger and some boots that weren't terrible but other than that I don't know
---
Whats a better trinket for hunter then? Of course its better for melee but it is bis for hunters as well.
---
This is objectively not true, try again.
---
It's just stronger than us, we like those hp bars all filled up.
---
Usually they don't have massive glowing heroin rocks in their hideout though.
---
I guess this kind of fits here.  
---
I play regularly with 2 friends groups;   
---
1st group consists of lvl 30 -  Warlock (Demon), Mage (Frost) &amp; Shaman (Me).  
---
2nd group consists of lvl 20+ Priest (Shadow), Warrior (Arms) &amp; Druid (Me).  
---
My question is what spec should I go with my characters?  
---
&amp; should I swap my Druid and Shaman on the groups (i.e. level my Druid like a boss to join the 30 group and run Spell Cleave SM like the pros?) Then leave my Shammy whilst the others level up to join him?!  
---
My thoughts are that I could go Resto on my Shammy &amp; Spell cleave but out questing with Lock/Mage this seems like a waste of time and I don't want to keep re-specing,,,  
---
I actually prefer Enhance play-style so the Feral Druid Tank joining the Lock/Mage actually seems to make more sense to me?!  
---
And I don't think I'd be waiting long for the Priest/War to make it to 30...   
---
Your thoughts and advise please, I don't want to put a bunch of time into leveling when a re-spec/gear grind will suffice.  
---
Thanks in advance!
---
Ik it was a dream I had but it was more than I could handle
---
inscription came with wrath of the lich king...
---
If you dont want to rely on friends hunter is a really good class for soloing harder content. And in my opinion the best class for world pvp. You can snipe your victims and flee really easy when the odds arent in your favor.
---
rounded up thats 28k to 18k thats not 2:1 lol
---
I see you are also a man of stick wars culture.
---
Can confirm. Druids aiming to level via feral can benefit both bear (Tank) AND cat (DPS) forms at once via one talent tree. I have heard however that bear tanks are not the best, but I tanked RFC with my druid and didn't have the hardest time (I have little experience tanking, so any difficulties are primarily PEBCAK).
---
doubt it, you have to go on an island in azshara multiple times to talk to the npc, thats a long trip for either faction
---
i’d advise you to set tailoring aside if you have it and focus on first aid first. That being said, you should be farming some cloths from grinding humanoids, spamming SMs helped a lot for me. I don’t think i spent more than 25gold in total for first aid, and since i’m warlock and i get a free mount that wasn’t a problem at all for me. I also have tailoring at 255 so i guess i could have done it even easier and spent even less if i completely disregarded tailoring but i wanted to rush the shadoweave set.
---
Do you normally have a lot of validation issues?
---
Is it a bug for frost nova to sometimes break early for seemingly no reason? It’s not common but I’ve seen it happen a few times. In every case I did not damage them and the mobs did not have dots on them. If it makes any difference this has happened when sometimes freezing 1 mob or multiple. I also only use rank 1 frost nova to save mana as all ranks root for the same 8 seconds.
---
Thank you! I start with something very similar for cost-profit analysis but gave up due the time it took.
---
Bembel einpacken bitte
---
As a human warrior with 0/31/21 (fury+prot, no imp slam) build, how much worse is using a 2H instead of onehanders for DPS?
---
Yesterday I got Demonshear which is one of the best pre-raid 2Hs afaik.
---
I have decent 1H's too. Lord General's Sword with Mirah's Song. 
---
Should I respec into Improved Slam maybe?
---
Dunno if this still pings everyone in the thread, but if anyone has the full updated Alliance guide, PM link please and thanks!
---
Last time I checked, it was like 400 60ies on ally side, to less then 300 on Horde, so right now is ally dominated server. But dont worry, it will change. Lots of pvp Horde veterans are in 40-50 now and they will bring war to your door. Nontheless, Phase 2 will be glorious!
---
Ran BRD earlier today, rogue in the group tries to pickpocket and he ends up failing and pulls 4 mobs,  note this was happening while I already had 4 elites and 2 dogs on me tanking. So the rogue, instead of vanishing, runs to us and now we have 10 targets to kill, I immediately aoe taunt and demo shout and start tab spamming sunders and revenge. But this rogue decides before letting me get full aggro, he Bladefurys and Adrenaline rush and ends up dying. We manage to kill all the targets, without deaths, except the rogue. But get this, while this rogue was dead he says “Tank, theres no reason why I should be peeling and offtanking, I’m going to need you to start tab targeting...” I couldn’t believe what I just heard, so after I told the party I didn’t want to carry the rogue(they were all in the same guild) and I just hearthed out.
---
I wouldn't recommend trying to guild lead if you're not playing that much. Unless you can get some really active officers that can lead the guild in your absence.
---
SavedInstances so people stop getting locked out....
---
Corpsemaker is my current weapon, I already did a few runs into the armory, but never saw it so far - so I'm getting a bit anxious about alternatives since it apparently rarely drops and there's usually at least one additional person who wants it. Seems like I should be happy to have the corpsemaker at least though... 
---
   
---
So I take it these are the only options and otherwise it's corpsemaker until Maraudon?
---
haha omg!!!! I have 1 character at the moment, at level 47, and a bank alt level 5 for DEing crap. THats it. I love alts though. In vanilla I had about 6 level 60's before tBC came out....3 I never played a day past 60, just enjoyed the levelling. 
---
My main is a shammy, and I plan to get a hunter, and a druid to 60 next.
---
This made me laugh, thank's stranger
---
“Send in the undead guards. The auctioneers finally snapped over the Mithril market inflation and their doing the weeping angel thing.” - Orc Guard Captain
---
...which sounds like a "nope, nothing else".
---
dont know the exact rate but dungeon quests at level 60 usually net around 4-5 g (which includes the original reward) + the item(s) of course
---
Yeah, my bad.
---
Isn't AV out in phase 3?
---
Thanks mate. I’m a warlock with tailoring also. Level 25 so haven’t yet ventured into SM but I should be there soon(ish). Free mount feelsgoodman
---
I tried to restart router/pc none of that worked, i flushed dns neither helped..how did you manage to fix it?
---
That might be the problem then, just remind you shaman to move their totems and you should be good.
---
Then also loot frost oil, limited invis pot, stealth detection pots, greater stonescale pot, moongoose, arcane elixir, grind elixir of brute force if you are up to it ;) and more. Alchemy has the advantage of being very diversified.
---
Nice!
---
I think he was added during bc because they gave his parents the first Phoenix mount and people were pissed Because it was a world first.
---
You best learn to live with your mistake
---
"well would you rather trust a goblin?"
---
Funny, but we have very fast (and cheap) internet here in Russia
---
how did you collab to form this raid?
---
For princess runs? doubtful
---
if you are just farming for the chest you dont even need a tank, 2 dps and a healer is good enough for it
---
I tried to farm for the rod for an hour, didn't get it. As alliance I tried my luck selling the lobsters in a neutral AH, couldn't get them to sell for 1s each.
---
Get lionheart 12 bars instead imo.
---
Interesting read, thanks for that link. This is gonna be a hard one for me, as this completely twists my previous understanding. It does make sense though, it clicked for me after reading it multiple times. 
---
This is actually relaxing because now I know I have absolutely no way to influence what I get in my next roll, it's completely up to RNG.
---
I assure most people want 60-40 or even 70-30. Sure no one wants a 90-10 because then there would be no one to gank.
---
Oh, shit, you can't? Some hunters have some very... Courageous names, then.
---
Its about getting screwed over by someone and then screwing someone else over I think lol
---
Buy hey if you wanna play with honor rules
---
more power to you! 
---
I think it’s pretty exciting having a 1v1 and not knowing if an approaching player by the other faction is gonna crush you or just let the best man win
---
I legitimately thought that's how it's done. That's what I've been doing. Greed things I can't use, or even pass, and need things that fit me...
---
30 rock maybe?
---
Yeah you guys are kinda screwed there, but that said, with the quest reward being like 50s or something, those lobsters should be worth more than that, people just aren't finding them on that AH for whatever reason.
---
Hehe, I guess you are right. I mean, it is one of the reasons creating a hunter to have one own personal pet.
---
Even outside of the cities?
---
who ordered up an extra large can of whoop ass?
---
Yes, but obviously not with current gear.
---
Many people have said this already, but the main problem here is that the healers often don't understand warlocks. I say "Don't sweat my health too much." in every dungeon, I'm thinking of putting it in a macro. 
---
That being said, there for sure are some retarded mofos who tap to 10% eventhough the healer is oom.
---
lmao, that guy is a genius.
---
Well the stones are not clickable so it hasn't, no
---
You can but only **once** after taming.
---
Do we actually have any idea when that actually is though? Could be another 4 months before OP even gets the chance to start grinding for the wolf mount they want.
---
Lol I would trade him some stuff just to check if I can withdraw them later
---
prob. ELvUI-Classic google it :)
---
Levelling blacksmithing is very expensive for 2 main reasons: you need a shitload of iron, mithril and thorium.
---
The items you make to level don't sell well / at all. Think white items (Steel plate helm, ugh), or blacksmithing-only items (Mithril Spurs). 
---
Can't add info about skinning, although I know a lot of people have it so the prices are probably lowered by that.
---
It's ElvUI (customized to my preference). And Details! for damage/threat. :)
---
I have got that 4 times in row
---
He probably had a meter and asked for it everytime he saw himself on top of the list
---
I love double gathering! Only money in, never out. 
---
This week the price for leather and bars really sky rocketed on AH.
---
yeah i think so, thanks anyway
---
Commenting to save
---
It pretty much is in any zone/Census app was broken prior to this post by about 10~ days.
---
According to wowhead it has a 15% drop rate. If you're able to do all your runs with the same group you should all have it in 26-27 runs assuming that you're running with 4 damage dealers that need it. If not then you just need to pray that you get lucky, run with corpsemaker until Maraudon or perhaps look into getting WW axe once you get closer to 40 making it soloable.
---
Go back to retail pls. There are no melee hunters in classic.
---
This happens constantly to me. Weirdly I also get the “Can’t do that while moving” warning, evening when I’m clearly stopped. And the “This item is already in use” when it clearly isn’t.
---
That just me or some weird Classic lag/internal cooldown?
---
He has nothing in his hands, 2 easy
---
i just want to build a house, so 1 month is enoth for me
---
but im pretty sure WoW is not allowed, but i would not mind that, i would watch One Piece again, it has 14 day runtime now, with sleep the month would nearly be over
---
I actually like growl enabled if the pull is a large group. It's a good off-tank in classic.
---
Most importantly, fucking tell the tank you want to do that. Don't assume he's ok with it.
---
ElvUI (at least, that's what is says in the corner)
---
hypnotic blade is really good, especially if you get a good offhand. (you can get [Orb of Dar'Orahil](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=15108/orb-of-darorahil) from a warlock quest. The next weapon you get is either [Witchblade](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13964/witchblade) from scholo (notice the fairly small difference from hypnotic blade) or [Inventors focal sword](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17719/inventors-focal-sword) from Maraudon. (not that good for leveling)
---
I started this at 50 because of the mp/hp 5 trinket. I should go.back and finish now that im 55
---
L oh fucking L 
---
For what it's worth i had a guild mass report me for claiming my irl buddy was a ninja in Gchat. Very weird situation where the GM just went off on a Temper tantrum and never let the situation get fixed.
---
Reading between the lines here. You are enhancement shaman so you want the Blackstone Ring. You opted to heal for their group but you consider enhancement your "main spec"? You add a rogue to ignore because they wanted to prevent a healer from rolling need on melee ring that's preraid-BiS for multiple actual melee DPS classes?
---
yeah, I'm aware of that too. So, Ret Paladins' dmg is shit. lol!
---
ITT: No one finding this post humorous
---
Well than go with 2x bonescraper = 60ap = 10more than dalrend set bonus and you can still go with your 1h enchant
---
I believe his point was people are hypocrites about what they'll roll on and not roll on.
---
He's saying you get melees saying "Hunters can't roll on Dal'Rend because they're a ranged class but I'm still going to insist on rolling on Blackcrow even though I'm a melee class."
---
A lot of mobs are immune to fire not only in BRD, but MC too, that’s why almost all Maher are frost atm. Or, at least a big reason :p
---
Fire will not really work in molten core and blackwing lair. From AQ forworth its a good spec.
---
If your focus is on pve and raiding frost is what you should aim for.
---
It's a hard question to answer.
---
It will objectively slow down your time to 60, but if that's not important to you then, sure why not?
---
Do we know if bgs will be xrealm or server specific? Because the uneven servers are so fucked if its server specific.
---
Can we still go to old outlands via deadmines? Or beneath SW?
---
Playing classic is such a nice change of pace from retail.
---
Which addon in the one that shows levels in the quest log?
---
only to find out they were on an other layer?
---
Correct!
---
Yes, BS is extremely expensive. To give you an idea, BS 270-300 costs about 670 thorium bars. I don't know about other servers, but on my server thorium bars can go for up to 70s each, which makes it about 470g just for the thorium for those levels. 
---
Skinning and mining are both profitable at high levels. Rugged leather is a decent income boost and if you can get devilsaur leather that's worth a lot.
---
They are part of the big group of things that have ruined WoW. Some more, some less so - but none of these things like gearscore have made the game any better
---
Thanks for your answer, I think i'll wait a little bit then.
---
Lore-wise, are there non-human forsaken?
---
as horde? maybe. As ally? most likely not. 
---
That is if you can even solo all the elite Qs to begin with.
---
Bonus points: taunt got resisted and tank has no rage to take back aggro.
---
While the healer and tank are struggling it really builds animosity towards the dps, who think "i'm #1 dps this run is going great"
---
http://isboxer.com/multiboxing-world-of-warcraft - im sure i have a refereral link to it somewhere too. Just gives me and anyone that uses it bit more sub time.
---
Regardless of how many classes you do, its easiest if you have 1 melee and x ranged. Or well you could do like 4 warriors and 1 healer setup, but managing melees can be pain in the ass.
---
With ranged you dont really have to think about positioning that much and chars mostly are facing the correct way anyways. Im playing from the warrior, so hes in front by default. Additionally you want to have addons like EMA (https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/ema-classic) and GSE (https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/gse-gnome-sequencer-enhanced-advanced-macros).
---
If you have 4 subs, any tank class (guessing pala might be best in aoe threat if you are alliance), priest and 2 mages would do most dps. With 5 accounts i wanted to have warlock for summons, buffs from the imp, soulstone the healer and healthstone for tank.
---
Other tactic might be just having 4 same classes. Super simple to setup, you just loose the possibility to play different classes if you want to. Depends if you just want loads of summon chars, crafters or multiple classes to play what you want every day.
---
4 same classes can blow up anything. Atm i can pull 6 normal mobs and nuke them with 2 mages while trying to somewhat tank some of them. Dont have aoe on my warlock yet, so it will just get easier later on. And thats with no proper setups on heals, i just have a simple heal macro that puts renew on tank and after that heals him with low rank small heal.
---
If other chars take damage, i have healtpots and healthstones setup on everyone in the team in one button, so while bit wasteful, i can top off the team with that. Still getting the hang of it, my isboxer setup is super basic. Need to add stuff to it when i get more levels. Now its just spam 3 buttons for tank rotation, dps and healing. i got rotational frost novas and sheeps for the mages, but thats about it.
---
Who the heck is that guy? I wonder what's in his head
---
Except a mage i guess.
---
Wardrobe....
---
He should be happy the person ganking him chose to apologize.
---
It is actually from the attunement quest on horde though.
---
There is new gear in new expansions in GW2, they just give different combinations of stats that didn't exist before.
---
i use VW on units i don't have the HP to tank and i use Succ on mobs i know i can stand afew hits from.
---
Looked even better in SWG
---
Hey mate, sorry for the delayed response, have been meaning to get back to you for a while now.  Just wanted to say that I'm sorry you were disappointed with the call.  I appreciate what you're saying with the platform that Countdown is, but I just also feel it's also important to hear from a variety of angles on all issues.
---
This wasn't a call advocating cheating, and it wasn't seeking to foster an anti-vanilla community that breaks the rules. There's a call coming this week that argues some of the opposing points, which will hopefully have some points raised that you want to hear.  Again, apologies if this call let you down due to the views expressed.
---
People at level 30 don't have silk bags? They are like 20-25 silver per bag. Worthwhile investment and vendor price is 20 silver

Join a pack instead of leading one. It lets you see and do the same content without all the hassle and drama.
---
I did not know that agi ench was not in. Both the case if agi enchant dalrend set also have a 1% increase in crit chance that is valued higher then ap
---
It’s a game and a good one at that but I will never understand the thought that if you don’t log in everyday you are doing something wrong. 
---
Play when you feel like playing and when you don’t, well then don’t.
---
This is where my warrior was when I got my first migraine!
---
They pont pass blackcrow to you because of hitcaps importance. So why would you return the favor?
---
Im going to be a living meme on my hunter in pugs.
---
Well i saw a rogue winn bindings of the windseeker on pubg. where are in guilds it always goes to tanks, in pubgs rogues dps warriors have a chance to get this legendary weapon. If other half wouldve dropped, it wouldve gone to the same rogue.
---
This is naming your pet.
---
You cannot **re**name your pet.
---
Of the three (Warlock, Druid, Mage) Mage is the only one with significant downtime.
---
Druid's main advantage over Warlock is that it gets an easier time with dungeons due being able to fill any gap the the party might need. That's not insignificant, even if it's not critical.
---
I love everything about this; how dedicated he is, his outfit, the fitting name...  
---
It took me way longer to realise what was going on than I care to admit.
---
Details! seems to be good. It's a dps meter with a threat addon.
---
I use monkeyquest https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24930-MonkeyQuestClassicDaMaGepyedition.html
---
Personally I wouldn’t but I don’t really care if someone does.
---
I’m not wasting my money to dunk on some kid that dueled me while waiting for the boat. If they want to use their iron grenade, heavy silk bandage, and FAP to best me then by all means go ahead.
---
I would not have had the patience to keep replying to this person, who cant seem to follow a logical train of thought, so kudos to you.  At least it must be somewhat satisfying to see his replies to you all getting downvoted.

As an alchemist, why do i have transmute mithril to truesilver when truesilver is cheaper (by a lot) on the AH? What am I missing here? Is there something obvious I'm not getting?

Doesn't it drop a pretty good mail chest piece ?

This is the kind of comedic dedication Azeroth needs

You're right. This is what I meant - spelling error.
---
&gt; raped again and again by waves and waves of ganking horde parties
---
or maybe if you just stopped doing THAT it would be a move in the right direction.  
---
albeit, rerolling alliance is a very good way to create a more even playing field again.
---
or you could continue complaining about the faction imbalance while the migrating alliance are having a great time on another realm. thats an option too.
---
Agreed. Down votes just means someone didn't like what you wrote, and that's ok. Some people take them far too seriously.
---
years
---
And that’s the luxury you get when your faction dominates the server. Just sucks when you thought the server was more balanced before you joined it, so you put a bunch of work into that char for a server that’s now unplayable. You can see why that sucks if you like world PvP but don’t get to do it, right?
---
Blackhands Breadth is way better than this trash.
---
what server? 
---
im on gehennas@eu, the most op server in the world. 
---
and by op i mean Over Populated
---
With hes friend Gimly.
---
If I dual wield a 13.5 and a 10.5 dps sword is that more dps than a 19.0 dps 2 hander?
---
I can't seem to find a guide that tells me how to work out how to compare 2x1 hand vs 1x2hand. Does one exist?
---
Heh I like the way you think.
---
I've just done a check on the AH yesterday night on Mirage Raceway (PVE) horde side. There were about 21k entries.
---
Gonna check the ally side as well, but I expect to see around 40k or more.
---
I've succesfully played on private servers with no more than 400 players online during peak raiding hours.
---
If, during our peak hours, we get at least 2k players (total), I'll be happy.
---
That's also a big one I forgot to even consider!
---
My favorite is when you LoS pull a group and everyone opens on a different target before you've even touched them. Retail ruined dungeon groups in a lot of ways. People need to focus the tanks target, use CC and not drop aoe on elite packs.
---
Main warlock lvl 40, alts 10..23.
---
Ahh fuck. I totally did. It was a long day
---
I’m curious to see if mages can still blink through dm entrance
---
Yeah I was surprised too. It's really nice on Ash. I wish it will stay like that forever.
---
Threat meter add on. I use tiny threat.
---
That's true, still very marginal.
---
I can't get past the naming the gearset. I'll play with it later. Sounds promising.
---
To answer your question! Yes u Can do fire while only doing 5 Mans.
---
But ubrs and Lbrs and brd all have fire elementals which are immune to fire so dont remove frosbolt from bar.
---
Most 50-60 Dungeons like scholo and strat and upcomming DM is more than fine as fire maybe even more effektive. 
---
Last words u Will have to Remember that most bis items come from ubrs brd and lbrs
---
It's baffling to me how people don't get this and that this "discussion" shows up in every other thread. The *only* reasonable thing to do when a valuable boe drops is all need. Giving that item to someone is equivalent to giving them that amount of gold. Why shouldn't everyone have a chance at that gold?
---
Welcome to level 40. Where it’s much more efficient to move into Elemental. Ahead of going Resto at 60.
---
5wands
---
5spirit tap

rest holy
---
its good mate
---
50 priest on mograine aswell. Promised myself that I wouldn't muck around with alts to much untill I'm 60. So I have a lvl 7 shaman which I play with Mrs that's it
---
You replace hoj in a couple of months when p2 comes out, warriors never replace it + its a mandatory warrior item with an extremely low drop rate.  
---
If you take a hoj from a warrior he will have to do another 50-100 runs just to have a chance to roll on it, all just so you can have a negligible dps upgrade for a couple of months.  
---
Its the ultimate asshole move, it would be like a warrior rolling on Ashjre'thul because it has some AP.
---
Leveling your first "real" character without a gathering profession is a one-way street to poverty town.  There's nothing wrong with it at all, don't get me wrong, but gathering professions can be a very basic stream of income if needed.  I've probably got 30g worth of herbs sitting in my bags that I could sell if I needed to.  I'm hanging onto them so I can craft potions/elixirs later and sell them and make more money.  Tailoring is a unique profession because it doesnt require a gathering profession - which means you spend extra time farming materials from drops.
---
I'm actually surprised, they didn't remove pickpocketing in retail by now.
---
I don't know about that. I encounter a lot of Alliance players when I quest.
---
Well this is what happens when the world cries to open a lot more servers.
---
what he said.
---
Indeed, so many people here sounds like they belong in the single player genre
---
Imagine saying boomer and meaning it.
---
I... should have known there's an addon for this.
---
Thank you!
---
When I hit 40 in my sham I realised that going ele mastery with enhance and some nature dmg was better then full enhance, you do lose flurry but you have insane reliable burst as elemental.
---
All my memories gather round her
---
That depends on your playstyle and of course the profession itself. With enchanting OP also chose the by far most expensive profession. My shami main is doing herbalism/alchemy and since I only have to buy the empty vials I am already starting to make profit selling early-midgame potions in the AH at lvl28. It's not an insine profit but I make between 5-12s per stack depending on the potion. Like I said, it's not making me crazy rich right now but definitely helps in getting the gold for a mount at level 40. Also potions are insanely good in classic, forgot about it myself!
---
So it all depends on the choice of profession you picked up. One of the guys I'm playing with also has enchantment and he pretty much doesn't give af like you recommended for the time being. Another one had tailoring and we were all so glad he dropped a bunch of bags for all of us early on.
---
hand of justice is melee only tho
---
The server copies itself completely so an area ( like an auction house) doesn’t pile up and lag. They did this at release so quest mobs wouldn’t be packed. It was good at the beginning but should have been removed a long time ago
---
Basically the server copies itselfs and moves players to that layer so it isn’t packed
---
I think the point is "if you're going to use the term 'stat-stick' then it applies both ways" which, imo, is fair.
---
I wouldn't (and haven't, though I've been in runs where they've dropped) rolled on any Dal'Rend if there's melees in the group that need it. I'd expect the same thing in return for ranged weapons, though I've had shiiiiiit luck on Blackcrow. It just won't drop.
---
It works if you log out and someone in your party resets the instance. If you are locked due to entering to many instances you get ported to your HS location when you log back in. (also this does not set your HS on a cd)
---
You have two options.  You can use add on threat meters, but from what I understand, everyone in the party has to be using the same meter for it to work.
---
Second option, and what I’ve gone with is trial and error.  Did I pull threat?  Use less next time, wait longer.  A dungeon run has so many pulls, you have lots of chances to see what works.  And every tank is different, so what was okay with the last tank might be pulling threat with this tank, or if your not pulling threat, up your damage until you do once, and now you have some idea of your new threshold.
---
Crits can also make a huge difference, both yours and the tanks.  If the tank crits, you probably won’t know, but if your crit pulls the agro and the same spell without crit doesn’t, wait on that spell for another second or two on the next pull.
---
It’s a sad fact that the majority of gamers are beyond bad and because of MMOs like retail they don’t even know it. 
---
This would be an issue in other games if leveling dungeons were not piss ass easy. If games quit hand holding we might get some decent gamers.
---
They aren't just going to retread BC and WotLK. Classic+ will be what they do. OSRS is a perfect example to work from.
---
Pay 20g to an lock or hunter
---
You're the one sending emotionally stunted messages to other people in a game and then posting images of it online.
---
&gt; as long as DPS let the pally build threat
---
lol
---
Best best is for you to train a new pet.
---
You should be able to heal stocks at 23 I was doing it easy as a holy Paladin and I've never played wow before now either :)
---
&gt;Mage, warlock, warrior, priest.
---
Warlock has the smoothest leveling of all those classes by far. Priest/Mage need to drink constantly and warrior leveling is hell.
---
Utility wise Mages/Locks have the most and best for PVP/PVE of all those classes.
---
Priests arent a 1v1 one trick pony, they are really good in BG's.
---
Paladins are really good in PvP.
---
Pretty sure it's in feralas.
---
&gt; Put all of those people on ignore and move on with your life.
---
The problem is that this doesn't solve the issue of abusing the mass report system. You can ignore half their guild, but if they see you out in the world and mass report you because you tagged a rare away from them, then you're still going to be fucked.
---
Ignore lists do not solve the problem of systematic mass reporting and false flags at all.
---

Backpedalling means you crushed a noob x)
---
FAP is nice and all until you get turned into a sheep, mage iceblocks, uses invis, or a swifty potion with blink to lose you. Fucked up still and got hamstrung? Be a gnome.
---
Threat /damage meters! Also letting the tank get a sunder in before you go HAM with dots should help. Not sure if lock meta uses downranking but that’s also a possibility on trash.
---
DPS is the same
---
Faster is marginally better but not enough to make a difference really. Likely, they’ll need to attack 1 time less at most during a fight thanks to less overkill. Frenzy will also be slightly worse and Crits will be less efficient (again, overkill). Not a big deal at all though, we’re talking a mere MAYBE one hit a fight, so no more than a second.
---
Some men just like to watch the world burn.

The maps themselves are a separate download.

Why would you write ten blocks of text if all of it could be packed into a single whine?

It's funny that you mention smashing 42s with your 49 in the same post that you praise fights where both sides have "equal chances of success".

I'm nothing more than sure that, if the sides on your old server were swapped around, would have been a happy part of it. You're whining because you weren't, not because you judge the behavior.
---
If you _really_ have much money pay a healer to back you up.
---
Pay for busting warr quests at 20 and 30
---
Get a good weapon, weapon is everything.
---
If you only go enchanting for disenchanting you should just make a level 5 disenchant character. Only drawback is that you can't disenchant BoP loot.
---
When I first did this quest I was puzzled where she could be and at the time I was new to MMOs and everything so I paid zero attention to chat (not reading and certainly not writing something) ... so I went on to do other quests ...
---
... did not take very long until I accidentally stumpled upon her so I completely missed the entire fuzz about her :(
---
What else would you use the zone chat for other then being social? Warning fell undead of alliance hotspots is amazing to see ,i try to help out if im near the area or i need a break from grinding.
---
Drain Mana 
---
/s
---
Yes, for the purposes of rage, Druids are effectively swinging a 2 handed weapon.
---
This is how i play classic. A lone wolf, forever unguilded on my own journey. Yes i still group and make friends a long the  way but its not a necessity.
---
Good luck fighting a mage, priest or lock with sword spec at lvl 60.
---
Druid... not sure why anyone hasn't mentioned this. They have the stealth/ambush capabilities which enable you to gank whenever you want... and then on the flip side they can heal/tank/buff which you can use to save/help people whenever you want.
---
"dps warrior no good, go be tank!" /s
---
na they just trade it too you in small quantities with multiple accounts
---
Cut the sum out entirely, and my wife. Hell, I'd even pay for _one_ evening where I can play without sbeing interrupted.
---
WRONG. Have you played this game you are commenting on?
---
As you said there, sap and ice block wears of at the same time (almost) and you can just fast stealth and cheapshot since you're on top of each other =) Or gauge and reset the fight if flare is still up.
---
Level 28 priest lol, didnt last very long!
---
When Rogues and Warriors stop rolling need on black crow, I won’t roll need on these.
---
it can proc Windfury tho..
---
Efficient things to do around 58-60? So far:
---
* 16 slot bag quest in Blasted Lands
---
* MC and Onyxia pre-q, or up to UBRS quest for Ony atleast
---
* Farm the bis pieces in BRD
---
* Mark of Fordring questchain
---
Well, the only arena in WoW is Gurubashi and STV. And you can use anything there  =)
---
It was one guild spread across multiple a la Olympus on faerlina.
---
Was a french canadian community of 3000 or so that transferred off
---
female vendors it, buys mount
---
Big true, just want to understand what this has to do with me seeking validation
---
Good gear and first aid
---
Good 2h weapons. It's the biggest deal by far! Especially at around L25 and around L45.
---
And people want TBC servers.. Horde/Alliance ratio has always been Hell back in TBC, even worse on private servers, imagine tbc being released by blizz..
---
Gotta say i'm happy to tank even if it becomes quite the piano solo part on my druid when i have to swipe into a pool of 15 mobs and tabbing to be sure everyone gets a fair share of whoopass.
---
Funnily enough, some of the best tanks I've encountered during leveling were paladins. They seem to hold aggro much better than other classes (+ they have the very underused Blessing of Salvation) because they can just Righteous Fury + Consecrate right away. I tank as druid and I feel miserable all the time: dps don't want to wait for mobs to hit me, and rage generation is poor as it is, so I constantly find myself running around to pick up lost enemies that are chasing mages and shadow priests.
---
On my alt I heal, and not having to constantly save mages who aggro the world is a relief. Cheers to paladin tanks.
---
I'm using Questie and it has it.
---
Weapons + high first aid
---
Grinding a warrior is easier than doing quests and I don't think the time invested is higher at all
---
I'm a warrior, but I played mage as well. I had a friend who mained it, and he said one thing that stood out to me.
---
"I leveled up like a total badass. I did damage like a total badass. I made the big golds... for this? So that I can cast one FUCKING FROSTBOLT EVERY MINUTE AND MAKE FOOD AND WATER FOR UNGRATEFUL SHITHEADS? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!"
---
He shifted to PvP instead, and I dont blame him. Mages are super cool to me, but i dont exactly envy them for the whole "be Frost or get lost".
---
I feel your pain man. I've played tank previously but currently play feral dps.
---
Now as a rule, I always wait about 5 seconds or so on pulls for the tank to build a bit of threat... 
---
Yesterday, I had a group in where the other 2 dps and healer complained at me for 'slacking' because I didn't instantly dive in after the warrior pulled. 
---
I tried explaining that threat in classic is a group effort, but they just laughed and called me a noob :) Fun times. Its frustrating but sometimes you just have to bite your tongue and push on through.
---
So I guess that you're constantly drunk and speak with your mouth full of food then. Doing that will make people think that you're a Dane.
---
Blizz still keeps D2 online services up.  Afaik their policy is they stop updates but the servers just always stay up
---
Old Outland was removed pre BC so I’m pretty sure it wouldn’t be there in classic.
---
Posts like this are why many people are hesitant to invite hunters. Don't be scum.
---
fucking wrecked lmao
---
pala tanks are so funny. Like a 4yo. But after playing a bit the pala tank get on my nerves and still think he can beat me...
---
Guys if you want to use your class right - just heal. Your heal is incredible. But at tanking Warrior and Ferals are still better. If you got a raid leader with an understanding of the classes you will never get a raid spot.
---
Nah melee is the easiest to get one off. Between frost nova and all of the slows, it’s easy to get consistent frost bolts off.
---
Yeah, that's one trinket.. What's the other?
---
Is there a decent spot to grind monsters for xp as a level 50 warrior? Searing gorge questing is killing me with how contested quest objectives are.
---
Wow
---
I guess the main reason the majority doesn't want any changes is that we don't want the game to slowly devolve to be retail-like.
---
aint nobody got time for that
---
So vanilla. Not classic?
---
I should be able with level 38, but the problem is that I've never seen a single one of these mobs alive :D. There's always some group of 5 players around making sure everything is dead there, I'd rather level with a suboptimal weapon than contending for mobs for hours there.
---
Thanks for the input though! I'll keep my hopes up in the armory...
---
The Horde will pay
---
With low level blood.
---
I play a Rogue, im pretty much gonna do the opposite of your rules 95% of the time.
---
Much screenshot
---
Yes you can play fire in the 50+ dungeons.  The biggest problem is mana efficiency early on.  Frost is way less mana hungry than fire, yet as frost you can empty your pool very fast.  If you go fire you are going to drink even more which is a lot of downtime between pulls.  Just know that alot of groups are going to resent you drinking after every 3 mobs and making the already long dungeons even longer.  Fire starts coming online with alot of crit and in the beginning we just don’t have the gear to sustain.
---
Honestly the only time I hear anything about NoChange now is when someone complains about the NoChange people.
---
Seems like you were setting unrealistic goals for yourself.
---
I can relate: I was going to hit 60 on opening week but I became violently ill on launch day of all times.
---
Try jumping back in with more lax goals and not sweating the small stuff. You'll still get to raid and all that fun shit.
---
OSRS is bad fan fiction. No thanks.
---
Is it possible that *you* just have no idea how the addon works and assume it cant do certain things because you're accustomed to using macros for those things? Im somewhat familiar with what macros can be used for and I'm 99% sure that most of the things you've listed here are possible with clique within a handful of button presses. 
---
Modifier keys? Check.
---
Downcast spells? Check.
---
Multiple spells per button that cast based on targeting context (ally target, enemy target, frame mouseover, globally available)? Check.
---
Clean action bars? Check. (Seriously, you could be an effective healer without any heals on your bars at all.)
---
I use some macros (useful stopcasts, for instance) but I'm legitimately curious what kind of complex casting macros are available that clique can't handle.
---
Afaik, macros, by design, cant use conditional information to make decisions, which is what I would really want them to do. For instance, a macro that judges target hp and automatically selects which rank of heal is appropriate based on that information.
---
Game changer honestly for mmorpg Gaming
---
I just got my 2nd toon to 30 and I wanna start a 3rd now... this is so hard.

I had the same problem.  I’m in a gear drought, so kinda interested in this for some mid level range goals, but I can’t seem to make it work.  I’m on mobile, though, so perhaps that’s part of the function issue?
---
Boooo, ret's have rights!
---
Ahh ok CD's for Arcanite go for 5G on my Server and Earth for 50 Silver.
---
Good old melee priest.
---
Pacemaker also has 1% crit
---
What you need to do:
---
Group up. focus on pvp and be aware of danger.
---
If you get dedicated players that are aware of the dangers, you will destroy hordies. Why? Cuz most of them wont pvp as much as you, and they will just run around happy, not expecting ganks. Make your side about quality, and take down the masses.
---
I find most of pug dps to be like npc’s who attack whatever is close to them. I have found a very successful strategy of applying dps catnip to get things under control aka marking stuff as skull 
---
ME SEE SKULL ME HIT
---
Most of them still exist. Just gotta get creative. Exploring has always been my primary objective in the game. One of my main goals right now is to discover something that has yet to be discovered.
---
I kinda bunred out on my shaman after 12days/played. And my friend giving up on the game because I was faster than him. I took a day off and thought about making an alt since I like the game. Then as I was watching the bald man stream seeing this Sulfuras hand of ragnaros being forged recandled my love for my shaman. I'm playing hardcore again. You just need a simple spark to motivate yourself.
---
I could only get behind Classic+ if they made all the meme specs viable raid-wise. As it stands, I doubt I will do any raiding since no one wants a Shadow Priest, Prot Paladins just can't tank raids, and no shaman on Alliance (not that Enhancement is very good either)
---
I wonder if the irony hit him right after he said "You just want attention".
---
I dojn't care about the class you ultimately choose, but please seek help. It might feel like it at first, but there really is no shame in looking for help and taking care of yourself. Mental Health really, really is no joke.
---
Anyone who doesn't pronounce it Feralas is actually just uncultured and should be rightly judged as a pleb.
---
It also despawns if you start moving the eye to early (before the camera switches to the eye) I haven't gotten stuck though.
---
Trying to get my brother and friend who I mainly play with to transfer from skeram. It's honestly bullshit. I know it's a PvP server. That's why I joined. But it's getting to the point where it will just be hard to play PvE and PvP due to imbalance. Eventually there won't be enough alliance to group up with to over take horde squads. Not enough high levels anyways.
---
Well too bad there is only one of u. 
---
1 u seem to quick to blame
---
2 I never said I don't make mistakes but I say even when I do everything right.

Under level 38 talented VW. Over level 38 succubus (it's a mana tank at level 40 and is doing 28% of my damage).

Because I'd have to read it first

And why would sexual harassment not work on the internet? It doesn't need a physical component to be present...

Ohh they probably buy them on mine as well. But at most for 2 Silver per Silk. And when I can sell Silk for 2 Silver per Silk to a merchant, I rather do this.
---
i don't give a single flying fuck about some alternative server for a crappy f2p game, i wanted to play vanilla wow and i will play vanilla wow with #NoChanges, if the want to make shitty moves they can do it in 3 years when the content is dry and the game is dead
---
Incorrect, the 20AP applies both to melee and ranged.
---
PEW....PEW PEW.....pew...pew pew pew....
---
Use the attack power. Here's why:
---
10 agi is 20 ranged ap and 10 melee ap and like .2% crit
---
30 ap is, 30 ranged and melee ap.
---
As a hunter, you might want to stay at 8 yards from your target to hit it with the bow. At some point in your rotation, you get a 2.5-3s window waiting for autoshot. Here, you can quickly go melee, hit with a raptor strike, go back. This works nicely with windfury, since you might get 2 melee swings.
---
This attack power buffs your melee hits as well. It's only up to you to make sure your 2 handed weapon is skill capped.
---
Also, reading some forums, there is a crit soft cap of 25%, which means, after this number, you might not want to invest into crit anymore, but go for agi or ap (assuming hit cap is first prio). The cap might be 28% against bosses, since they reduce your chance to crit by 3% (this is true).
---
I hope this makes sense for you. You won't be able to melee on every boss, but it will give a nice dps bonus on some of them, inflating your internet schlong when you see yourself on the damage meters (if it's relevant to you).
---
Have fun!
---
I'll proboly get downvoted again(?), but you guys asked what is 'accepted', and potions are and never were accepted in friendly duels. So noone will duel you again after,  unless you tell before you start the duel.
---
Druid question: When should I pick up Nature's Grasp? I don't plan on PVPing much, but I am on a PVP server. Currently level 25, went straight for Sharpened Claws 3/3. Not sure if this point should go into Blood Frenzy, Feral Charge, or Nature's Grasp.
---
I passed on Feral Charge, I don't know if I need to pick that up either. I figure I might be able to wait a bit.
---
Also all these guides tell me to grab Furor early, but I feel like by the time I stealth and get behind an enemy I'm at full energy, even without it.
---
Any talent tips?
---
well, im a not a pro but i know few things
---
off hand deals only 50% dmg if you dont have any talents
---
and dual wielding has 19% hit chance penalty
---
so quick maths
---
13.5 x0.76 gives us 10.26 dps
---
10.5 x 0.76 x 0.5 gives us 3.99 dps
---
19 x 0.95 gives us 18.05 dps
---
ofc there is additonal hit chance based on the weapon spec level which i cant and wont calculate
---
furthermore most skills are cast with main hand so 2h should also net you better skill dps
---
hope it helps a little
---
Judging by the performance I've gotten in those really big raids, this might as well be a video... 1 FPS :(
---
Yeah so hyped back than and then they fok that hard..:/
---
As long as it stays Popular. They've planned to release The Vanilla Raids and Content in 6 Phases, and we are currently in Phase One. Popular estimates (and i believe somebody said it somewhere) puts the length of each Phase at 2-3 Months. So it's a Year before all the Vanilla Content is even out
---
Think you'll survive without +20 AP buddy.
---
Did the 6 quests in that area yesterday. Got like 35k so from turn ins (not counting the 120+ mobs killed),  several excellent gear pieces,  a ST quest for more stuff and a pile of gold. You can also get ZF mallet along the way
---
Super worth
---
Absolutely correct.  Anyone intelligent looking at how much math has been done these past 15 years declaring the horde superior absolutely would have locked faction balance. Pretty permanently scuffed as is,  glad  we're getting a "pUrE vAnIlLa ExPeRiEnCe"
---
Same here. All Light/Medium/even Heavy Leathers and Light/Medium Hides are posting below vendor price (WHY THO) on my server.
---
Could you take a higher resolution picture so I can have this as a wallpaper ?
---
Or it's because putting them on ignore doesn't actually stop them from mass reporting people with false flags.
---
But you know...offended...
---
Nothing more to see here then.
---
Such a feat.. gz
---
It really irks me that rhe horde gets a much better fishing pole for no good reason 😤
---
Did my first WC as a 23 priest the other night coming from a similar situation but with less previous experience. I also put it off for some nights due to nerves but finally decided to go for it. Had a great time and no major issues, great group as well. Good story, keep it up! :)
---
It is ineffective before level 38..40. After this, start buying shadoweave and other +shadow damage items. I have +86 shadow damage and the difference is huge. Cannot even imagine what kind of mistake I have to do to get killed. Usually doing 3-4 mobs of my level at the same time and when finished: bandage + dark pact to full in few seconds.
---
So you selected him to see if there was some kind of reaction? To see if he's autorunning?
---
He can still give details... Witch hunting has to do with names.
---
Do the dungeons with drops, shit, if you can get some offset things too. Bringing a DPS set and a Tanking set for a raid guild is such a big boom. Regardless of what your main spec is, guilds will often cover a respec for when key roles aren’t there.
---
Lol you say waste gcd on sting like you’re spamming abilities nonstop. HM, pet attacks, then auto/sting, mob dies. Spamming multishot drains mana. Literally every resource says HM/SS is more efficient/better for leveling. 
---
And for leveling, BM is a lot better than marksman so you aren’t even using aimed. In fact BM is better in pvp and raiding too.
---
I am only asking this because I made this mistake in Vanilla: have you been to demon trainer to level his abilities?
---
The Deadwind Maulers I've been farming in Deadwind Pass have a knockup that seems to have no range limitation and no cooldown, and they seem to revel in waiting until I'm .002 seconds from finishing my Frostbolt cast to bounce me and continue punching me in the face.
---
How is it to be level 61 while everybody else is stuck at 60? 
---
On a more useful level, 2h fury without slam is quite competitive on horde, and not very good on alliance. WF totem really makes or breaks this spec (you spam hamstring on all GCDs that are not Bloodthirst/WW to proc WF). 
---
2h fury with slam is again stronger on Horde, but can work out on Alliance. If you want to play 2h, you have to get imp. slam and play the proper rotation. If you get the Sword from Ragnaraos, it's probably your best spec overall, before I would assume DW wins single target but it's not going to be a day-and-night situation. Play whatever spec you like more, and if you have a much better weapon for one of the specs then that one will be superior. Demonshear is very slow, which is good for 2h slam fury and should make it a very good pre-raiding sword.
---
While the other comments with regards to experience and better knowledge of BIS items is a factor, the main reason UBRS is easier is because in the later vanilla patches UBRS was changed from a 15-man instance to a 10-man instance, with the mobs rebalanced to reflect that (less mob health, lower mob damage output). Since classic runs based on the 1.12 patch we don't actually have access to the "original" UBRS.
---
There’s a gap near the top of the entrance
---
Comments like this is why I come to this sub.
---
Also, main hand damage (damage, not dps) is counted for skills so you typically want the slower wep in mh.
---
Wait, what?
---
The logs are 2h fury. Still fury.
---
Btw do you get to keep dawn's gambit after doing the quest? I've been abandoning and picking up the quest again to get a new Dawn's gambit. I'm not turning it in before I get my necklace.
---
Your lack of belief makes it no less true.
---
Look, you sir have no idea what it is to be a new player. I had zero reasons to go to TB at low levels. Hell, I had zero reasons to go anywhere at low levels. I stayed in the same two zones all the way up till my early 30s. I only had to explore anywhere ONCE and that was due to me making myself run there--I wanted to experience more of the world before i hit 60. Which was about 3 weeks before Classic launched, BTW.
---
That four pull in the last hallway, right after the shortcut ... oh my fucking gawd!!
---
I has the rallying cry if the dragonslayer buff on my hunter and the 140 AP didn’t affect my ranged damage, only melee.
---
numbers are looking a bit better for gehennas now, more like 45/55 if [wowpop](http://wowpop.appspot.com/) is accurate...
---
That's reassuring. Was worried that this is an experimental thing for nostalgia.   
---
Also, I'm completely new to WoW and I've been playing for about 2.5 weeks. Level 27 now I keep seeing level 60s everywhere. How long have these servers been live? I feel like I'm leveling super slow. I'm also doing alchemy on the side of course, herb gathering takes a while + dungeons aren't quick pugs and all. 
---
How are peeps flying through the levels there are so many level 40s - 60s. What things can I do to improve my leveling speed? I'm on Warlock (27) + dabbling with Druid(14). Just checking Druid out.
---
60 hunter
---
37 rogue
---
20 warlock
---
16 warrior
---
10 priest
---
10 paladin
---
10 druid
---
10 mage
---
I got the hunter to 60 before starting any alts, then I got all the alts3to 10, made sure they all had 12 slot bags and some gear from AH. Now I just play whatever I fancy when logging in. Leveling this time around is frustrating though as I'm no longer in front of the leveling herd, I'd be much further on my rogue if I didnt keep rage quitting because a lot of quests are just flooded with players.
---
As much as I loved slayer and what not, there is something super rewarding about it, WoW grinding is fun when there is decisions to be made about pulls and finding a spot with decent gold and XP that aren’t inhabited
---
You can just talk to the NPC and get another one after completing the quest so yeah don't bother!
---
Sorry, I call bullshit.
---
Sure, a cat or wolf would do a bit more damage, but I still have enough damage to compete with other DPS in a dungeon.
---
And no-one really cared what pet I brought. Often enough I got compliments for my pink strider. Many players like it just because it's different.
---
The general rule usually is no consumables other than food/drink and no abilities with 10+ min cooldowns.
---
That's very real and thought-provoking.
---
Pretty much feral ass, epmhasis on the "e".
---
!ripdevil
---
I love that you compare having to look out for a few beefy bois to getting sapped and assblasted the moment you step outside of literally any settlements,  yep you've sure seen both sides alright lmao
---
Fuck! Shouldve written this
---
Okay we can go in circles all day.
---
I guess I don't know what you mean about everyone having a fair chair at loot, but it you roll Need on something that you are going to sell and someone else rolled Need to use the item, and you win, you ninja looted.
---
If you think everyone having a 20% chance at getting the item means its not ninja looting, you're dense, that just means everyone who rolled Need so they can sell tried to ninja loot.
---
It defeats the whole purpose of the loot system. If everyone in the group abuses it, it doesn't fix the problem.
---
If no one in your group cares, then whatever man, carry on, but that doesn't mean it's not against the entire purpose of the Need/Greed system.
---
Soooo.
---
Ofcourse we want that. It would be awesome to see that.
---
Not in this Version though - that is supposed to be unchanged. This is what we have asked for for many years now and now that we get it there is plenty of People coming and asking for changes to the game.
---
Go and ask Blizzard to make a Classic WoW that has changes pls - don't ask them to Change current classic wow. We want to Play it the way it is. 
---
Thats what I tell People who ask Classic wow to be changed - not saying that you are asking for it - you just generally ask why People are so #nochanges.
---
We wanted the game this way asked for it for a Long time and finally got it. Let us have it.
---
For you I think /r/classicwowplus could be very interesting :) Give it a shot - there is plenty of discussions on this Topic :)
---
prefer "T"
---
Old Outland was removed from vanilla so I doubt it made it to classic.
---
I know that a lot of mithril is used in engineering which is a very popular profession. That could be the reason for the price being higher

Do what you want dude, it's a game and the point is to have fun. If you aren't having fun with the class you're playing, try a new one.

Reddit content upvotes is based on timing and your ability to make an enticing title. There’s been a bunch of analytics done about this.
---
those actually are hunter bis weapons :P
---
I’ve been following the icy veins classic druid guide. So far the only talents outside of feral tree is furor. I don’t think that guide has you go into balance until you get your final point in feral. I’m also on a pvp server level 40.

Ah okay. Intimidation is on successful normal attack I think. Thanks for the info

I have never said that isn't the case?

When I was about (30 holy pally) a (30 ret pally) wanted to duel me. I had no clue what to do because I’m basically a mana battery with auto attack at this point, so he starts swinging and I throw my righteous judgement down. He gets me to half health and I started flashing myself to full health, easily out doing his dps and only barely breaking into my mana. I hit him with another judgement and a stun, healed again, then finished him off.
---
He got pissed saying paladins don’t heal during duels. Well, he might as well have dueled a lvl 5 if he wanted no heals because it’s one of the few things I had in my belt at the time. 
---
Even in world pvp my plan is typically get someone on me and outheal their dps while my boys down them.
---
No, thank you. I like my pink strider and I don't have any issues with leveling speed, group finding or questing.
---
I will get a white cat in winter spring soon enough (1.2 attack speed). Until then I will level my vanity pet.
---
You're wrong. Even as a tank, it takes be sometimes 30 min to find an SM group while spamming world and lookingforgroup on faerlina.
---
So should fury warriors not roll on leather gear because it's stealing from rogues?
---
Well I tell you a thing. After RS removed wildy the game tanked hard. The reason why OSRS server came was because of the PvP. And look at OSRS now, all about that PvM and playing on four accounts, QoL the hell out of that game. 
---
Go back to OSRS if you want to change classic.
---
Peacemaker
---
I'd rate it between 390g and.. 999 or something.
---
No changes enjoy
---
Its a joke
---
Or hunters.
---
There is a massive nostalgia-hype for "pure" Classic. It's been slowly dying since more people hit 60 and found out there's not much endgame content.
---
The 3-month mark should give a rough estimate on how many people will stick with Classic. I've already seen my server at "High" less and less. It was "Full" after launch, but now it never gets to "High" except on weekend afternoons.
---
The tooltip on Intimidation specifies "next melee attack". 
---
Lightning Breath is ranged, but windserpents have a melee auto-attack just like all other pets.
---
This will most likely prompt enough screaming to merit change,  black rock dungeons are still most of the end game p2 and they will 100% take 17 rezzes for ally on most servers to reach
---
The only mistake is going to the alliance
---
enjoy not getting invited to any of these dungeons lmao
---
Haha my only goal in classic is to gank, corpse camp, troll and piss people off as much i can lol. I'm not complaining at all lol. I was laughing at your stupidity for thinking it's the hordes fault if server balance is fucked and not blizzard's fault.
---
Dw is almost always inferior to 2h while leveling. As others have pointed out you get a massive chance to miss while dual weilding. Also with a slow 2hander, assuming you're a warrior, you can do things like hamstring the mob and kite them in between your weapon swings, taking less damage.
---
Lastly, your instant attacks like overpower, ww, and ms get a lot more benefit if used with a slow 2h vs a weak hitting 1h.
---
It's a slippery slope. So best bet is to not. I would mind say a barber shop, or other small cosmetic added things that dont affect game play.
---
\#NoChanges is only a thing for the existing Vanilla content (e.g. the phases). Past that I think a very good chunk of people are all for changes in the form of new content.
---
Noble but very hard goal.
---
Specifically terrain-type features are near guaranteed to be all discovered given that anyone can run a pserver and explore as GM.
---
NPCs will be your best bet imo as those arent copied 1 to 1 on pservers like terrain is.
---
Imagine being mad at the ppl being outnumbered 3 to 1 instead of all the winning team joiners that cry now because they don't get to camp other players which weren't a challenge to begin with because they were so fucking outnumbered.
---
Yea. Good job horde players on not balancing their own realms. At the end of the day the only people balancing pvp servers are players. And horde players on one sided realms are the people to blame.

that doesnt make it not a melee item
---
Yeah the collusion would be unreal. As of now when I get into a group of guildies it normally means smooth sailing. With loot trading I'd be terrified thay they're going to ninja all of the gear.
---
&gt;When should I pick up Nature's Grasp?   
---
Mmm, in 43+? After you finish Feral tree and took Furor 5/5
---
Can someone recommend to me a simple and user friendly auction house addon? The one's I have tried seem to be a tad bit complicated for me.
---
also this
---
hi, again i cannot comment on warrior talents, no clue at all
---
doesn't work until p3 bwl. in p1 and p2 rokdellar is too fast of a weapon to do that. in bwl crossbow speed with 3.4 seconds (3.2ish after quiver AS modifier get applied) in addition to good 2h weapons that give pure AP, is when this becomes viable.
---
with rokdellar 2.9 AS (2.6 after quiver modifier) you will be delaying an auto shot if you go in melee for a hit.
---
in p1 dal rend are bis for hunters too. i know it sucks when rogues and warriors need them too. in p2 hunters can go for the 2h in Dire maul.
---
There is a ton of trash with mechanics that screw paladins over. MC trash alone has: aggro-resets, mana burn, Silence, buff-purge (goodbye, Righteous Fury). Not to mention that kill-times are longer, so you are definitely OOM after every pull. If something adds you better how your warriors can pick it up.
---
Fairbanks is REALLY bad too.  I'm a 60 lock but made an alt.  My alt is 40 now and I literally see 4-5 horde for every 1 alliance.
---
And warrior tanks rolling need on mask of the unforgiven
---
Go to other 50+ location.  
---
Feralas, Tanaris or Hinterlands
---
...I don't know if you noticed, but my flair is alliance-paladin. I'm playing as alliance and always have for the last 15 years. And I still don't believe this isn't the horde players fault. 
---
This is a mechanic problem, and should be addressed sooner or later before most servers turn into PvE and we're all are stuck queueing Faerlina. It seems Blizzard will have none of it, that's why they limited the /who command and basically shutdown the wowhead census. Some suggest implementing faction queues. That's only a thing Blizzard can do.
---
For the most part I’m #NoChanges, but I would love to see Blizzard actively tweak class balances. It simply doesn’t make sense to me why we would continue to only have 1 viable spec for the Majority of classes, seems like poor game design to me. and I’m fully aware that they kinda had no idea what they were doing 15 years ago, but there isn’t a reason not to begin tweaking balance now, especially considering we’re looking at essentially a stand alone xpac
---
Show me plate itemized like the fury bis list.  
---
Peacekeeper and dual wield hatchets are within a tenth of a percent or arguably better than dalrends for hunty bois but based nerds wanna roll on all the loot so reeeeeeeee
---
I'm a fuckin priest so I don't even care I just realize hunters gonna hunt
---
Your not on Ten Storms by any chance are you? If so I may have been your healer haha amazing how similar this was to my 2nd ST Group last night
---
IIRC, you put `{heart}` (i.e. one of the raid marks) into the chat line.
---
dude xD le meymeys xdddd
---
A few seconds of more incoming damage doesn't negate the massive, inherent disadvantages Paladins have.
---
If you pickpocket, the mob will still drop it’s normal drop.
---
After 39 I respected to full affli and switched to imp. 3-4 dots, fear and drain soul once it breaks for imp drain soul mana regen. Not the most popular way to go but has worked fine for me into 50's. Or if fear keeps pulling adds, I just pull from max range and run away while throwing dots over my shoulder. Mobs dont catch up till 50% or lower and can easily be wanded down after that with minimal damage to you. IMO imp is better because while fear kiting, if a melee based pet goes out of with the feared mob, it might reset or pet might pull threat from close by red mobs that otherwise wouldnt be pulled since imp is ranged. That's my 2 cp anyway.
---
Hm yes well this seems worthy of investigation. Blizz probably won’t touch it with a 10 foot stick unless you all keep reporting.
---
It gets better later on though. A lot of experienced mages buy drinks for their own use. I know the struggle and hook them up with higher tier water too ;)
---
Auctionator, probably
---
The one from warcraft 3
---
Keep fighting the good fight!
---
Once all phases are out and the content completely cleared to its fullest, maybe we'll think about eventually trusting blizzard with the idea of classic+. But most of us would rather have TBC because we don't trust them with changing the game.
---
The only things bear druids aren't good tanking is non-physical damage.  Otherwise they're pretty boss.
---

---
27 warrior here. Was planing to tank at 60, but might go DD based on what would be easier to find a raid with. I chose herbalism and skinning as my professions. My plan was to sell all the skin I collect while leveling for gold income then drop skinning for alchemy closer to 60lvl.
---
1) Is mining + blacksmith better for warrior? As far as I know BS is expensive to level while the only item that can be crafted and be useful at high levels is Lionheart Helm. With alchemy I can do transmutes for that helm and create potions for myself. What would provide more income?
---
2) Is cooking + fishing profitable on mid levels? I need a way to start getting gold for my mount.
---
Had not thought about this aspect. Thank you!
---
Probably a lack of mana will be a big problem while half of equip is green.
---
All &gt; Mages /thread
---
This happens with gnomish cloaking device as well, getting me killed and putting it on an hour Cooldown. Please don’t forget about it, and please upvote for visibility!
---
If they added transmog I'd quit
---
Oh yea I forgot classic has mickey mouse itemization
---
I had the same bug on my orc hunter. I'd attack with my bow then hit cleave when the npc would approach and for some reason I'd be attacking with my quiver.
---
Horde rogues don't poison mh if they can get windfury. Otherwise you can use weapon stones if the mobs are immune to poison like some in mc are.
---
Honestly, horde just have a much better setup overall with the zepp system connected to major cities and much more direct flightpaths :(
---
One of the most annoying things about Murlocs is the ones that swim near the shoreline. They pathing and distance are difficult to judge, and they are some of the most frequent "adds".
---
Don't train all skills. only the necessary ones
---
Yep, I should do that, just to get it going again; when it finally died  down 6 or 7 minutes ago.
---
We have a RP guy on Lucifron-Germany who takes care of all the passengers using the ship to UC-OG. Hes called "Bootsführer" and his guild is called something with zeppelins.
---
He even has a timer to warn every1 like 5secs before the ship starts moving.
---
Its just hilarious. I always buy my ticket for 1 copper ( his price ). Last time i gave him 2 Tel Abim Bananas so he can snack something during his hard and honest work. THANKS FOR KEEPING US SAFE BOOTSFÜHRER ! 
---
I love this community :D
---
I recommend checking him out even if you dont speak german. Interact with him to make his day.
---
P.S. Germany didnt get a RP server. I feel bad for him
---
&gt; LF Tank BRD. Tank loot reserved 
---
Sweet jesus, even if I was bored out of my skull, had full pre-BiS and *literally* nothing better to do for hours, I still wouldn't tank for a party like that. Just out of principle.
---
Peacemaker polarm is the best alternative to DalRends. Peacemaker has better offensive stats and is easier to obtain, and only hunters will be rolling on it. Peacemaker is from strat undead Magistrate boss.
---
You dont have to put 31 Points in BM to to play BM. Going for Aimed in marksmen and rest in BM is pretty common. 
---
Serpent Sting at Level 42 Costs 25 less mana than a Multi shot that adds 80 Damage to your auto attack Damage. That single shot is already doing more Damage than SS over the Course of 15 seconds. 90% of the enemies dont even live Long enough to get 15 seconds of Damage from SS.
---
Using MS once or if you are unlucky twice in a fight is not draining mana.
---
Like I said when Fighting elite enemies I am on your side with HM+SS but on normal enemies its not worth it imho. But each their own. I am happy if you Show me some Sources that I can look into
---
Your mistake was consistently biting your tongue. Whether or nor you are the group leader, the tank is essentially the dungeon leader. If you know how to do the dungeon better than the team is doing, keeping quiet adds just as much to the downfall of the party.
---
This!! I did exactly that as well, and I've regretted it since. My only alt now is a bank alt.
---
Oh, it autocompletes eventually, this fallback existed back in the day as well.
---
I have 5.5 year old gaming computer, runs wow classic with everything maxed out, I have netflix running in another window and it's 70+ FPS.
---
That was a comparesion to 2 1h axe setup. Dalrend set is in fact the best 1h setup you can use on Hunter preraid. That is why its on the bis preraid list. I am not debating who deserve it more. The argument that something is replaced later. Aint gonna Work either what if i never go raiding. Then it my bis for 1 hand ever. It is in par or Better in some situation as the polarm. But it still a option for the best in slot preraid.
---
I'm 55 Ally on Noggen and it's gotten better. The 40 range was probably the most imbalanced bracket I felt, STV was a shitfest but I went to Desolace instead which was better.
---
Everything has armour, and the sunders might get dodged which triggers overpower.
---
Yeah I kinda appreciate everyone running around looking ridiculous. You recognize certain gear which is cool.
---
I think the success of private vanilla servers is a testament to the fact that people love and are willing to play the game as it was for years after it was originally released.
---
As for the idea of sticking to private servers if you don't want changes, i actually don't think that's a bad idea save for the fact that blizz likely won't allow many to survive now that there is an official release. Even prior to the release they had shut some down.
---
If people are gonna be entitled pricks that think their BiS is more important than anyone elses BiS, then I don't care. Don't want to run dungeons with them anyway
---
Im not sure if id go for a year, also if it were like a subscription service i might do 1 month on 2 off lmao.
---
Did you miss the 42s were ganking lowbies
---
I really feel like the issue is the rampant mana problems and not the taunt lmao, but I have only tanked up to SFK on a Paladin, so what do I know?
---
It's pre-raid BiS, only thing better is Dwarven Hand Cannon &amp; that's +-300g.
---
I know this is confirmation bias but it does feel like that on the alliance side. Nobody helps eachother and just runs away whereas the horde seem like a more cohesive unit which I definitely notice whenever I play on a horde alt.
---
Well, in final fantasy 14 you can arrange a time to have a wedding ceremony as well.
---
You can /who race/class combinations which helps see beyond the 50 cap in some cases.
---
You need way more than 180 60s to form dungeon groups, because most of them aren't going to run dungeons - they already have everything, or run it in guild groups, etc. And on top of that, far less than 1/5th of the players can/want to tank.
---
Did you mark the mobs?
---
Why didn't you use a shield at the final boss, which is guaranteed to smork? 
---
I've forgotten how entitled tanks used to be lol
---
&gt;There’s not much endgame content yet, because of the phases.
---
The only new content coming is BGs, Dire Maul and the remaining raids. If you're not interested in PvP there's no on-the-fly endgame content, outside of creating an alt and doing it all over again.
---
&gt;And why are people like you always finding reasons to discredit classic? It’s super popular and thousands upon thousands of players are having fun!
---
"It's (supposedly) popular, therefore it is beyond criticism!" I don't think I have to point out what a bad argument that is.
---
Dalrend is not bis without agility enchants. Those wont be available til P3.
---
Peacemaker is better.
---
Do you realize census doesn't work anymore due to Blizzard's limitation on the /who command?
---
I mained a hunter in Vanilla, and earned my epic mount money by doing the hunter epic bow quest for hunters that couldn't do it.  I know what I'm doing goddammit!
---
The popular thing on this sub at the moment seems to be hating on other players and acting like your shit don't stink and you are God's gift to the game.
---
It's quite intolerable and childish and petty.  Think I. About done with this sub for a while. Seems like all the kids run here to have a cry before going back to the game.
---
If you want to reach 60 in 3 months the vw is definately a good tank
---
I don't mind topping them up when they lifetap in the middle of a pull. What's is annoying is when they lifetap back up to half mana and still keep wanding. What did I heal you for!?
---
Lol @ the salty guy downvoting because he doesn’t have HoJ yet hahahaha
---
In the deadmines? I visited it in Cata so that can’t be right. It did require a trinket and a DC macro though.
---
It however is not strictly better as the +15 agi enchant to weapons is available making Dalrend set BiS for hunters. It is a great alternative and easier to get though.
---
So, being able to do content in a game is not making a game better? You genuinely believe this? What's the point in having the content then?
---
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha hypocrisy straight over your head.
---
Double sac is pretty nice for someone trying to gank.
---
I'm thinking of bouncing off my pvp server (Thunderfury-alliance). I knew what I was signing up for, and things went about as you'd expect for a while. Then horde started becoming way more imbalanced and just questing or running around the world was becoming more difficult.
---
This past weekend the problem got MUCH worse. I couldn't quest in any contested zone, and even in alliance dominated zones (duskwood) there were roving parties of horde taking out anyone they'd find. There are no fair fights. It's either a sizable group of them, or a high level fanning everything in sight (sometimes in a group).
---
I'm not having fun. I'm having difficulty progressing. I have to group with multiple people to have a chance of doing ANYTHING, and even then we could have 7 fucking horde parachute in out of nowhere to camp us. But I'm at 4 days played on my character and don't want to abandon that.
---
I've got a free realm transfer to use. If I leave, what PVE server would be a good one to jump to? I want to get stuff done, and work on my professions, and get to raiding. As of now I spend my days mostly crazy frustrated.
---
Wow I remember saying they need to make shitty unfinished specs viable and the no changes morons obliterating it,  glad people are starting to wise up
---

---
Gold buying is bad, mmkay. Don't do gold buying, mmkay.
---
Some people are trying really hard to optimize and get to 60 fast. A lot of those people have been playing on private servers for years, so they know exactly what to do. You don't need to rush, though, there's no actual hurry.
---
Sorry to be off topic but what addon is giving you the quest ! On the minimap? Does it also show where they can be handed in?
---
I'm really enjoying not being just told where to go on the map so I wouldn't want a 'your objective is here' feature but gathers/quest markers etc all being the same little yellow dot makes me sad :(
---
It's even more hilarious, fury is better at tanking 5 mans than arms or even prot most of the time. So not only are they refusing to do something, they're refusing to do it as tbh.. the easiest spec to do it as.
---
The right to respec to a right spec.
---
A BoP on sale? What?
---
Until the mage gets mobs with ranged attacks, sure.
---
Saving for later
---
I know right! Bfd was the first dungeon I ever ran and the first one I found.
---
Hey what's at the bottom of these stairs...ooo look, a cave. OMG THEYRE ELITES IM FUCKED!!!
---
Server was like 45% alliance and 55% horde before transfers opened. Maybe you should have tried a pve server.
---
yup finally someone who get it. my brother plays a rogue and he literally get flamed if he dares to /w a mage for inv to a dungeon because he can't aoe and hit the xp/hour numbers they want.
---
i play a warlock and never join any group that only play spellcleave or did that raiding dungeons exploit.
---
Also for the short sighted people who can't see further in the future on how this can impact the game, we have a 16% mage population which keeps increasing.
---
This reminds me of the days when lfg was added and people started saying why are you hating on me because i like using this tool of convenience, if you don't like it, don't use it. Mages are the classic equivalent of convenience.
---
Classic raids are not that hard. most are around normal difficulty raids in modern wow and AQ 40 and Nax are around heroic level, its the leveling that is brutal. so a class that can bypass all that difficulty and level up faster equates to a convenience that would have been nerfed if these were the vanilla days. But because of the no changes they can't touch it.
---
This is the correct solution,  but there's so much reeeeeeeeeee still about MUH VANILUH
---
I guarantee everyone who says this doesn't go out of their way to try and kill every member of the opposing faction they see.
---
Not really.. pacemaker is objectively better and you get it in less than ten runs while Dalrends could take you 300.
---
Same! Me and my gf are now playing on a PVE RP server and it's a lot more peaceful not having to look out for groups of hordes chasing you around haha
---
As a warrior, this. So much this. Especially if you aggro 2 of them and they chain net you. 20 seconds of just staring awkwardly at them while they throw spears or shoot you.
---
Also anything that disarms. Basically the entirety of SM Armory are disarmers and runners, it's nightmare fuel as a war tank.
---
??? +15 agi weapon enchant from Timbermaw rep. Guildie is in process of farming the rep
---
I'm ashamed this took me more than a minute to figure out...
---
Keep crying and keep getting ganked. Gd cata plebs.
---
Actually, no one said that.
---
But.... there is isn’t there from timbermaw?
---
I downvoted you, I play a night elf hunter on Skeram.
---
Yes, but it's better to tell your group before you start running the dungeon that you are not leveling as holy so you'll 'need' on good dps gear (just don't need on cloth and leather) so people don't go mad at you. Usually people understand that. As a 27 warrior who tanks instances in arms spec there has never been any trouble when I needed on 2h weapons so far.
---
I really doubt it's the people that hit 60 that stopped playing but I'm sure enough of the hype has worn off that people don't just agree to wait up to 8 hours in queue to be able to play.
---
If it was in the den it's understandable, especially as a sub-10 hunter.  If other people are in that place killing you can often get entire areas respawning all at once on top of you.  Can be certain death for most classes let alone pet-less hunters
---
It isn’t a mode, but a tag you can set on yourself in-game like AFK or DND. None of the servers are labeled as RP servers, and you can find RP on any server if you look hard enough, but there certain servers with an RP reputation.
---
Yeah sorry my bad. fixed
---
Outstanding move.
---
Yes, during leveling dungeons that should be the default, nobody expects a warrior to level as tank or a pally to level as heal, everyone should understand that they need DPS gear. Once you approach max level and pre-BiS drops start to appear, I would announce your intention to roll on certain gear before the run though.
---
Theres a lot of red flags in this post. I'm just gonna back away slowly.
---
Not being scum when they are considered pre raid bis...only thing i would say would be scummy is needing on hand of justice over a rogue or warrior as a hunter.
---
Simple. But effective.
---
I suppose that makes sense and it's healthy that you can actually get to do something that you enjoy. Everyone needs space to do their own thing otherwise we go mental.
---
No!

Wait a minute. Peacemaker is available right now? I thought those are the catch up items that will be added later on....
---
“I think it’s happening” you’re hilarious 
---
Yeah no shit ofc it’s happening 
---
Since week one 
---
I also highly doubt farming medium leather is worth much ? Then again idk all the farming methods anyway I’ll just be winging it and then at level 40 manage somehow with fishing
---
Thank Thrall.
---
I see, thank you!
---
Agreed. You can do whatever you want.
---
Bit of an AITA question - not really played since retail TBC, and this is my first time on a pvp server. 
---
Last night in the caves before BFD our undead warrior (we're 4 pals and recruited one dps from our guild) charged a lower level gnome priest and proceeded to get his ass handed to him - it was glorious. 
---
We did nothing to help - I actually cheered on the priest while some of my buds cheered on the warrior. He died and we ressed him - he ragequit the group, raged in guild chat, turns out he's the alt of someone 'important' and we basically were told the only reason they didn't kick us is because they were 'nice'.  
---
Is it really expected to 5v1 any low level running around? Blew my mind.
---
You can do "content" without all that junk.
---
I would not roll need if someone running with their role needs it.
---
Lesson learned: Don't stick your dick into crazy.
---
Seriously, if my girl wouldn't respect my hobbies she wouldn't be my gf. I don't really connect with all the stuff she likes, either. Having to slip away to pursue your favored form of recreation is insane.
---
I'd compare it to healthstones and those don't get passed out very often in my experience
---
Aha the 100% expected Devil's advocate.
---
Yes. There are stipulations (I'm sure I said that?). The Warlock has to Life Tap strategically. And shouldn't expect heals after he taps himself to oblivion between pulls.
---
Life Tap is, however, baked into the class. The class does not work without it.
---
that list is updated and shows devilsaur eye, haha.
---
updated my ass.
---
Yep, that’s right
---
This has to be a troll.
---
I enjoy leveling with vw because I can do 2 mobs at once and leave the fight having lost maybe 10-20% of my resources while having killed 2 mobs. It's also great for recovery for multi aggro, and the massive shield for sacrifice is great for winning pvp fights.
---
And what limitation is that? Census queues up /who commands if you’re talking about the CD and is getting well over 10k people in the results.
---
Most of the time its not really a problem. If the warlock lifetap once every few shadowbolts I have mana to spare for a few heals. Keeps the group moving faster.
---
Unless the tank is dramatically undergeared or we pull extra groups I can just sit down and drink while the tank set up the next pull and drag the mobs to los so no real downtime.
---
That's why you always check for that pat in that room.
---
All I see is perfect kiting. No damage taken
---
Even later the 2 +15 agi enchants outweigh a single 25 agi enchant if youre min maxing. However overall peacemaker is vastly easier to get and a great alternative
---
HAHA. 
---
I legit laughed out loud.
---
wait what? not even internet at home ... your poor kids!
---
Fuck your stupid ass idea of communication. just gtfo if this SOMEHOW triggered you bitch
---
Me too!
---
We're all in agreement classic had some nice qol right? Multi week quest lines that unlock shit like instant alt mail? Dual spec? Tie it back to chrome dome or something cause we're saying fuck it at that point
---
I mean maybe he has ally acc and pmed using that.
---
I usually specify that I'll be needing on dps gear if I want. Think it'd be cheeky to need on caster gear \*and\* that lovely 2h weapon that might drop!
---
No you're sick! Thank you.
---
The scorpions in the salt flats put a 3 minute poison on you that ticks for 10 damage every 3 seconds. After I got my 6 vials I never fought another one. 3 minutes without bandaging was annoying enough I couldn't imagine not being able to stealth.
---
Strahan is for felhunter
---
Please never do this. If warlocks tap to 1 health I refuse to heal them. It's the most annoying thing you can imagine. Just tap once between shadowbolts. Anything else is poor play.
---
KUI
---
Two people from my guild quit, despite clearing MC. Part of the reason is how piss easy endgame content is. People from my friend-list, who I leveled and farmed gear with, haven't come online in days &amp; more.

---
You act like the p2 problem will be worse on heartseeker opposed to stalagg.  You can't be real.
---
Would it be scummy for a warrior or rogue to roll need on Blackcrow with a hunter in the group?
---
You’re correct. Just checked my old notes. Looks like I accessed it in 2015.
---
In retail I was on a 500k alliance vs 50k horde server. My horde guild existed primarily as an emotional support group. Couldn't even sit at a world flight path for 1 minute without getting killed. I would create alts on various potential balanced servers because that server was infuriating.

Or you could spend a little more ore and make greens that an alt can d/e. It's a trade-off.

im saying that his ingame name shouldnt be offlimits.  thats not part of his protected personally identifiable information.

Wish I had mana in real life.
---
What race do you play? If you are human, you basically don't need them that much, since you already have +5  swords as racial (and orcs have +5 on axes).
---
it depends what your Main focus is:
---
PvP: Orc
---
PvE: Troll
---
being a big boi: Tauren
---
You have some serious reading comprehension issues
---
Indeed.
---
Why would they whine? Most people will just wait for phase 3, BGs are going to be CR.
---
I don't understand why people are so shocked. If you know you're easily getting sucked into something it's best to get rid of it. Everybody would understand this post if it were about alcohol or drugs and not gaming. Besides, Smartphones are extremely harmful indeed, especially to children. 
---
I think its a dangerous move. Don't let it get out of hand.

Modern mount system was 1.12.1 but we have it in phase 1.

Shoo.

If you stand in cleave as a WL then I think that is a yikes.

This made me laugh quite a lot.
---
You're being downvoted for taking a cynical approach, but there's nothing incorrect.
---
So it's two different loot tables?
---
i'm night elf:-) Thanks for your insight!

lmfao come on there is no way this is real

get divorced dude. If my wife tried this shit I'd be gone in a second. wtf

This is nice, but probably not anywhere nearly as slow as my potato.

This Intel Atom chip (2015) uses around 2W of power typically, where desktops mostly have a peak wattage of around 45W. If you see how smoothly wow runs on this while opening the netflix homepage takes about 1 minute to complete. Just shows the amount of optimization that went into making Vanilla wow.
---
Seems like first class douchebaggery to kick someone out and replace with same class, I would leave such group as well.
---
Just say whatever you got to say in a civil manner without fucking my ideas u disrespectful cunt look what you made me say
---
Why do you need an addon. It's literally 
---
1.) Against hard mobs: Garrote - Slice and Dice - 5x SS - Evis
---
2.) Against easy mobs: Remove Slice and Dice
---
3.) Against boss mobs: Add in Blade Flurry and Adrenalin Rush after Slice and Dice. Get another 1 combo point Slice and Dice after Evis and repeat.
---
Usally all mobs are dead before you get 5 cp again for another Evis.
---
There's also the opposite where I tap down and as soon as I use first aid the healer stands up to heal.
---
Why only lvl 9? I would level a couple to 10 first if you're on the fence about any. I think almost every class gets a lot of new abilities at 10 that change the playstyle a lot.
---
How to solve this puzzle the correct way: Get the fuck out!
---
I tried an old trick to get up to Ironforge Airport, but it didnt seem to work. I was pretty sad was looking forward to running around up there as very confused people flew overhead like in the old days.
---
\+15 agility is phase 3. it's not available yet.
---
Group already had a druid in ^ this kind soul opened his heart and his mind, inviting me to join the group because he believed in me when no one else would.
---
On the flip side the queues for BGs will be awful if the battle group are even slightly imbalanced.
---
Thanks
---
Thanks man!
---
I can do it all by myself, no rogue needed :D
---
Have you looked into just buying the charms? I think I spent 4g total to get all 24 charms. was definitely worth it at the time, the boost to your damage is pretty huge even from corpsemaker. 
---
As for Ravager your best bet is probably going to be to tank it yourself and put the group together so you're the only one rolling on the axe. there's plenty of cloth/leather wearers that are looking to do armory. Herods entire drop table is a warriors wet dream so you're going to want to run it multiple times anyway.
---
warlock can pvp with sm/ruin I think
---
tho later u may want to go ds ruin and that means sacrificing ur pet ..
---
Druids have the hotw spec for all purposes
---
LOL, was getting ganked by mage and rogue last night. Killed the mage because I am a Ret-Pally and he thought that he could just freeze me LOL. low on mana, rogue still on me. 
---
Low health, Lay on Hands. Immediately the rogue started shouting: G O TO RE TAIL
---
Cant get more salty than that
---
It's nice seeing those big crits pop-up and then hearing the fast *snik-snik-snik.*
---
I really hope they just open up server transfers. A lot of people are re-rolling or just giving up on super one sided servers. I know Kirtonos is like 68% Horde. Giving out server or even one time faction transfers to people would probably help them play with their friends/balance servers.
---
Does Wf not apply to offhand? Never played rogue so I’m not familiar with this.
---
With paid transfers you can go where you want except from PVE to PVP on vanilla, but it seems really weird to me that they enabled it without announcing it since many people are asking for it.
---
It's possible the "buy" option is there for the future but not active yet, and to use the free transfer you have to choose based on blue posts on the official forums.
---
In any case, if you reroll on PVE, don't throw away you char, we will get paid transfers sooner or later.
---
Use swords as human. +5 sword skill is a huge dps boost
---
Elvui
---
Even then, it's still really niche because there are very, very few packs in dungeons that NEED to be range pulled. You can just use iron grenades instead of wasting a trinket slot.
---
Wtf i was singing this to myself earlier for the first time in months, 10/10 meme
---
Dragonforce. So much Dragonforce
---
no shaman...your account is worth nothing...
---
Get em.
---
Druid or rogue for stealth ganking
---
Are liberated death knights not basically the same thing?
---
There are multiple quests, yes.
---
My advice would be to do the one given by the Orgrimmar trainer, it's much faster.
---
Warriors.
---
They are maint tanks. Usually guilds will fully gear their main tank before they funnel loot to their other tanks. Thats why it is "Warriors especially"
---
There was a MC clear within the first week. First reset. So they didn't miss a single clear.
---
There is People that already have 2 bindings and would be able to craft Thunderfury if they didn'T have to wait... All possible
---
 i felt like capturing a hilarious moment in Classic and yall are qualifyng my fun
---
The RFK axe is best in slot for wars and pallys until you can get ravager or your whirlwind axe (you should just rush this at 34 or whatever because it's stupid op). You can also go do Gnomergan and try to get the 2h axe from last boss. It's level 32 and a bit better than RFK axe but honestly I'd just stick with what you got until ravager, a random boe blue drop, or WW axe.
---
Real PvP is using your advantage. Not making up make believe rules that might end you.
---
This is amazing!
---
Gives me a oldschool DND or like a diablo vibe.
---
Whichever one is the "updated for classic" one from willitclassic
---
I have a hunter and I don't plan on even rolling on these when they drop. Reason is, their status as BiS is actually marginal over other options AND it's not worth it/fair to rob melee classes who actually need them as primary damage dealers. Imagine a BoP BiS hunter gun/bow with a really low drop rate always being rolled need by all melee just because it had .4% more crit or whatever.  
---
Not even including that the thought of grinding for the second one as a hunter sounds absolutely nauseating.
---
For a L25ish it doesn't matter too much. For an upgrade to WWA you ideally want something slow that hits hars cause you'll be using mortal strike a lot.
---
This gnome killed me several times when I was low life...
---
Says the guy whu runs around disguised as a spirit dog.
---
I'm ITT sounds good move along
---
So just to be clear, you don't want to run dungeons with yourself either since you are showing yourself to be that same entitled prick you mentioned?
---
Had a hunter in our guild ask to swap in for someone after we cleared to the last boss so he could get a quest......luhhhhh no.
---
I wasn't sure what blizz did with the game, just wanted to test it out. They could have made it a bit more demanding on the low end spec, they did change things after all. But I'm happy that level 1 (slider in graphics menu) settings are literally potato settings.
---
Same, on Incendius last night alliance were trying to block horde from getting inside.. revenge for SM haha
---
This\^ He wouldn't be asking if he was at the bottom
---
It has literally everything to do with seeking validation. That's all it is, from chat conversation all the way to the reddit post.
---
Aren't Bone Slicing Hatchets still better? At the very least, easier to obtain.
---
Raising weapon skill from 300 to 305 is huge, due to the decrease in glancing blows.
---
Going from 305 to 310 also decreases glancing, but not by nearly as much.
---
So if you can reach 305 without Edgemaster's, you don't need them. Races with weapon specific bonuses can often get it that way (e.g. dwarf + axe).
---
6 across 2 realms and 3 factions:

---
Succ is def the best pet for leveling in combination with dark pact.  
---
It doesn't do as much *burst* damage as a 3/3 imp but the damage is much more sustainable.  
---
She doesn't (have to) use any mana, so you can drain all her mana to yourself.
---
Also it is very usefull when people are trying to gank you. Seduce and all.
---
I don’t think so, no. You can always look up the quest online and will be able to see the quests that follow it as well as their eventual rewards. I’d imagine the Succ. quest could be picked up by a warlock trainer in UC or Org but they’re likely two different quests as quests like that are usually only provided by one person. Hope this helps.
---
Tauren, you take up the most server space in recognition of how awesome you are.
---
\+15 agi comes out in phase 3. it's not available yet.
---
It's personal preference.
---
Orcs are probably "better", with blood fury and stun resist. Tauren are still good with war stomp. 
---
It's splitting hairs, though.
---
Idk for sure but I could Image changes from Private servers. On most private servers Princess used to cast her aoe like every 5 seconds, she does it less frequently on here and needs to be triggered to do so ( by having something in meele range to her)
---
I'm a dwarf priest called badhealer and had to double take this, thought it was me for a second xD
---
That's really good to hear, I don't think I'd be heading towards any hardcore end-game raids but we'll see how things develop. 
---
So I'd be ok levelling as feral and healing in dungeons (if I had to) in feral spec still? You can only have one spec at a time can't you, in Classic? No switching between multiple specs?
---
Then there's nothing you can get that will even remotely come close to the power of Edgemaster's until C'Thun.
---
tier1 isnt that great for tanking
---
they wear maybe a few pieces and thats more for tps
---
It was my bad for not giving enough context but your sense of not having the full story is absolutely right. At the same time I appreciate your gentle approach too. 
---
The thing we are seeing these days is more like a phenomenon when given mage starts booming the explosions right after they made the first step towards the mobs. They might not start their fight alone this way but in instances and in party out in the world they absolutely do. They keep on doing the same shit while navigating among mobs too. Or just start raining Blizzard in Scarlet while 3 mobs are beside each other. 
---
While latter in this context can also prove efficient, former looks almost like they macroed running forward with arc expl spam. This type of person that many of us are seeing and are trying to describe are using their aoe spells without even understanding game mechanics like leeway or pathfinding and repeatedly fail miserably. Carelessly disregard marks, not understanding why we might want to focus down one mob sooner than another. 
---
Another comment I am reading here is how terrible it feels being associated as a former mage with these clowns. I can't express enough how much I agree even if I'm not playing a mage this time around. With this level of ignorance they absolutely deserve that fifty dkp minus and the leader of that kind. Patience, discipline is not how these clowns are running around and while they might boost the most dps out indeed they are not as a valuable asset to a team compared to someone else who can sheep moon and focus cross after skull. It's that simple.
---
And also "make sure your gear is repaired" before joining.
---
Yeah, I had to clear the camp twice to get it.
---
Lol well that's a stupid mentality. How is that fair to pallies that are almost always forced to heal even if we are ret? So according to you we don't get to roll on upgrades because we took one for the team to heal? If anything it should be the opposite.
---
no one else thinking
---
“gonna take my horse to the gold coast roads,
---
gonna riiiiiide til i cant no more”
---
no one?
---
will see myself out....
---
He just used up every ounce of good RNG he had left. He's going to lose every single roll for the next 5 months or so.
---
Okay, but that doesn’t mean that classes aren’t completely unbalanced. Even outside of raiding, how many elemental shamans do you see? I never raided in Vanilla, but I do look forward to raiding in Classic. I’ve raided with a group of IRL friends through several expansions, and post Wrath, have, yes, rushed to the end game because it is really the only part of the game that’s any fun in retail, as the leveling is honestly pretty monotonous and boring(not that end game isn’t, just a little more fleshed out). My complaint is that there are dead specs in the game period, not that raiding needs to be the reason the game is changed. Class balance will add more variety to the world, period. I’m sorry raiders have hurt you’re feelings, but that alone isn’t a reason not to have good class, and spec, balance.
---
I've never seen a successful guide without an active GM
---
I've only seen warriors and druids with a few pieces of t 1, neither surprises me.
---
Fitting guild name
---
&gt;Go ahead and whine about "omg we are so outnumbered" 
---
And
---
&gt;when it comes down to it you still gotta learn to throw down in even fights.
---
Being outnumbered and outleveled isn't something you can fight against and expect to win. Just this morning level 60 horde groups were killing everyone in Menthril Harbor, even NPCs.
---
You expect a bunch of 20-30s to fight that and win?
---
That's true, I think 9 because that's just where my playtime that session ended haha.
---
sword to 60
---
then daggers so u dont have batshit insane competition for swords
---
I figure the guy loses nothing though, right? No repair costs and we res him right afterwards ^_^
---
I remember seeing a level 57 warrior with Ironfoe as well.
---
Wolf! Spirit furrie
---
There are actually entire raiding guilds already?
---
Samest
---
Obv yes. Was just joking on the bandwagon for funzies
---
Why did you skip the fp in 1n?
---
33 Shaman  
---
31 Rogue  
---
18 Warlock  
---
5 Mage
---
The asshole group leader seemingly kicked the druid from their group to invite OP because OP was guilt trippin the party  leader.
---
Do you consider tag/flair abuse funny? Because this is how those tools lose their purpose.
---
Fishing is a good source of cash if you fish for trunks or alchemy ingredients. Not so much for cooking
---
Regular quests give gold at a much larger amount. Most repeatable turn ins are rep only. At least most have been for the ones I’ve done  thus far.
---
Regular quests do have a conversion of course to gold.
---
Class balance is one of the major reasons that wow retail went down the path it has.  It is almost impossible to drive balance without impacting every other game system and interaction.  Budding pve Ret would be game breaking for pvp ret, so now you need nerfs or to buff other classes, or resilience or whatever other game changing thing to fix that.  It’s a spiral.  Lack of balance is what makes the game what it is, it has flavor, it’s imperfect like the real world, you can’t have it all and choices matter.  If you want balanced classes with multiple viable specs go to retail.
---
How so? Each roll is independent.
---
But still w/Un'Goro and Feralas so close why the fudge do I still have to fly to around my ass to get to my elbow? Thats more the problem w/WoW Classic/Vanilla FP's.
---
My favourite thing to do when people are like “anybody doing this quest?” In general is to just respond in general “no”
---
&gt; If you pull 1 on 1 there is no reason for VW, just succy + drain tank which will be faster then with VW and you will never have to stop for eating/drinking.
---
I don't get this tbh. Just from my experience Drain Life will not outheal mob damage. So you will slowly deteriorate on life and still have to eat after some time. Not to mention that you need 31 talent points for Dark Pact and you'll have to drink before that; or that the guide says to not drain life before your 30s, which means you will lose hp on every single mob.
---
Would love to see a guide or video on it. I've tried holy and ret so far and I'm level 50, wanting to try protection as well soon.
---
Did this with two demon rings, flew my ass to xRoads and gifted them away to anyone without a ring on!
---
Good advice overall but as a tank i have one big "NO" to say to one bit:
---
 *Swap targets immediately. It's as simple as this. If you accidentally  take the aggro away from the Tank, just start beating the shit of  something else.* 
---
Do NOT do this. Last thing you want is to aggro multiple targets. A tank can easily handle 1 mob getting away from them with taunt. A good tank will actually use this to their advantage and let a dps aggro the first kill target, since it allows them to spend all their rage on other mobs, then taunt the kill target, thereby inheriting the threat the dps who aggroed has built up.
---
If you switch to another target when you aggro a mob, you only risk taking aggro on another while the tank's taunt is on cooldown.
---
Nope, should be icy:
---
https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/classic-hunter-leveling-guide
---
Was these number not from private servers and completely off?
---
Remember seeing somewhere that each +1 point of skill rating is like 0.1x something hit in classic
---
Imo focus on leveling first and worry about gold later.
---
The WoW equivalent of card skimming a cash machine! Nice try though.
---
Yeah that is probably right.
---
A lot of People don't even think about that though and just write they want changes made. 
---
So I tell them that they are not to Play with the current Version :P
---
I'm happy to have changes. Hey I'll admit that it would probably be a much better game with certain changes. But I do also want to Play the broken old Version :P
---
Nahh but you are right. Most People just don't think about phrasing their sentences so I know they don't want to take away and just add.
---
Still I would remain with "let us have our 3 years" because otherwise it is too likely that the broken current Version will just die out due to not enough Players :D
---
Are they seriously gonna to release the honor system with no BGs? That is going to be completely fucked for servers with major faction imbalances. And there's a lot of those.
---
Never stick your dick in crazy.
---
This was exactly my point as well but OP doesn't want to listen.
---
nothing to see here
---
Honor system with no BG is going to suck for anyone leveling up.
---
So bring up your alts quickly.
---
All that stuff (terrain etc) is client-side though. You can literally run the classic client with a 'fake' server that doesnt respond with all the NPCs and stuff (so they'll be missing) in the world but the terrain will be there as it's all in your gamefiles.
---
I think this alliance scum hunter nailed it, great advice 👍🏼
---
Anyone knows dropchances of blue sinew? Besides azuregos ofc. Wowhead and dbclassic all very different.
---
It's different for DPS and Tanks. If your level is too far below the mobs, you miss a lot --&gt; no damage/no thread.
---
As a healer you heal your group, they don't resist your heals.
---
550g? I find that hard to believe
---
Four?? Get the MMO mouse for crying out loud. I have 12, and I use every one of them PLUSS the keyboard with everything on shift + alt in addition. HURR DURR only 2 buttons in WoW, those people tho. No i'm not saying you are one of them, just venting those guys out.
---
HK: Private HK: Private HK: Private HK: Private HK: Private I miss those days.
---
Addon updating question:
---
I quit playing (retail) in cataclysm, and since then when I've been playing off and on I never bothered with addons.  Now I'm running addons for classic, and they're broken because they're out of date.  I vaguely remember an update tool that would keep your addons current without you having to go and manually update everything.  What is it called these days?  How can a lazy troglodyte like myself keep my addons current with as little effort as possible?
---
There are plenty of players who aren't looking for 1:1 duels out in the world, and being attacked while you stand their and watch them get killed is a funny honor. I think unless you know the 2 are actually enjoying their 1:1, the honorable thing to do is defend your faction.
---
Have you done all the ULDA quest? Theres also some quest in Desolace you can probably do if you havent yet.
---
Yeah it's like phase 2 or 3
---
druid doesn't start to feel fully rewarding until you get cat form (think of the 30% move speed pal) for questing, and for tanking its not really satisfying until after 30 ish. Its a weird class that you have to spend quite a bit of time in to get a full feeling kit because of how wide their kit's range is. I can't say how playing resto or balance would go, idk. I've massively enjoyed being a bear though
---
What warrior rolls on leather?
---
Also, with a 2h you can echant 9int which is the current bis hunter raiding enchant.
---
I can't agree. A bad DPS will get removed and replaced, a bad tank can get by almost forever for the pure fact he is a tank, people will be hesitant to call him out because they don't want to wait for another tank. This will lead to the bad tank never getting better and in fact probably getting worse and 100% getting an ego.
---
Hence why this reddit is absolutely filled to the brim with tanks whining while also sucking themselves off.
---
T H I C C
---
how can you not have so many flight points, no wonder your flight paths are bad, you are missing nearly half.
---
better get the addon handynotes\_NPC
---
Just want to clear something up: So a person can use the item on the spot(main spec, clear upgrade) is equal to someone that can't use it and will place it on the AH?
---
Where's the line? Everyone needs gold, and eventually gear is going to be replaced and be vendered. So that means that everything is greed?
---
I believe its released in phase 4, which to me makes no sense. Its the level 51 class quest.
---
Is Rotgrip really worth it though? He seems to take the longest to kill and has the shitties value loot?
---
Hahahahahaha
---
The question is; is big wreckless DPS a bad thing?
---
I'm a tank and I do get those DPSers who make my life hard but is it a bad thing? In the end by the time the monster reaches them it just dies. We never have down times, we never wipe and the killing is fast. It's not like we're playing EverQuest.
---
Can confirm. I was on my level 20 shaman and considered hopping my main, but nah. Gotta get that xp!
---
I don't watch the guy I just wanted to join in at how defensive you were getting over your opinion being poorly recieved
---
It isnt available til p3. Even with the rep the vendor doesnt have it yet.
---
And the moral of the story is you can be correct and totally wrong for no reason.
---
True
---
Classic+ baby
---
Each roll is not independent, reason why probability class is so hard, a lot of other things that affect same outcome from happening twice in a row, and getting that outcome previously is 1 of them, not saying it’s impossible but the probability by definition drops
---
For PvE min-maxing, it is definitely Troll. Partially because when min-maxed, Shaman are healers. While Tauren and Orc don't offer much for PvE. Though I'd say Tauren is more useful for PvE, as the benefits of Orc favour Enhancement. Which again, when min-maxed, is a terrible choice for endgame PvE.
---
&gt;typical alliance, don't know how to pvp without ganging up.
---
pppffffffffffahahahaha
---
That's layering for you.
---
You know all that means is Horde are coming back with 12 raid groups for 9 hours, right?
---
Im really surprised at how easy the dungeons were (are) as indeed, tanks are not allowed to get aggro, there is no CC and in most cases - at least the lower dungeons as im only just 40 - we seem to survive most of the time ... that way they never learn, we need more deaths!!

Drunken Parrot was originally founded back in 2007 on the Stormrage server. We played the crap out of BC, WOLK, and Cataclysm ‘till most of us moved on to different games, and different life pursuits. A small core group of RL frainds have returned for classic, and we’re looking to fill our ranks with other awesome weirdo’s to share this experience with. We’re mostly middle aged with families/jobs/responsibilities and varying levels of general dysfunction (but in a fun way!). We don’t take this game (or much of anything, really) too seriously, we take our time, we level our fishing, we /dance and /cheer, we don’t much care about efficiencies or leveling guides, we make a lot of corpse runs, we level alts, we play solo, we play in groups, we make bad jokes, we make good jokes, we quote dumb movies, we are silly, we crack wise and act a fool. We are Drunken Parrot.

Had the gold by the time I hit 60....
---
Then I spent it on warden staff, sash of mercy, and devilsaur.
---
Oh well, back to farming gold.  I'll eventually get some decent BOE drops.
---
Anyone have a weakaura that can tell me if my warlock pet is targeting or attacking something? Been trying to repurpose hunter WAs but my results have been mediocre. Would be much appreciated
---
I'm a healer so I was hoping 52/53 I might be able to sneak into one but most people seem to be looking for 54/55 at least. Maybe people are getting picky since there's more higher levels around?
---
Saving for later!
---
It is. I have it on my hunter. Many items in 5mans that shouldnt be out yet, are out.
---
Ultrawide master race! Cheers brother!
---
&gt;Except the feeling that you’ve got his back yeah. 
---
I had his back, he was buffed, &amp; ressed within seconds of his loss. 
---
&gt;intending to be a dick by cheering on the guy he’s fighting
---
Was just a bit of a laugh tbh. We picked sides and just cheered etc.
---
Nope. I have been in STV, Hillsbrad, outside SM, PVP City.
---
Awesome! 
---
After Leeway and Spellbatching I was wondering when Blizzard will finally bring back the Server downtimes. Great to see they finally got around to it :)
---
I just hope they don't give out those pesty "1 Day Sub compensations" for this like they used to. That was the only annoying part... /s
---
Enhancement is a garbage spec based on RNG, so naturally they'd be pretty adept to depending on RNG for success.
---
You’re right, but honestly, posts like this are only making people leave faster
---
Q,Z,E,F,C,R,X and V
---
ALT+ and SHIFT+ of the same.
---
I use the void still, usually I can throw up my main 3 dots then start wanding. Eventually Ill get aggro when the mob is less than 30% and they usually die after hitting me once or twice.
---
PvP zones I use suc or felhunter just incase some filthy allie decide to group up and gank.
---
Maybe I wouldn’t have been quite so annoyed if the shaman wasn’t dead literally 90% of the fight lol
---
Someone please pick the mage up already!
---
They are arguably better.  
---
Peacemaker has 1% to crit and 56 AP. Even with the +25 agil enchant that's 1.47% crit and 106 AP.  
---
Dual BSH with +15 agil enchant on each gives a total of 56 agil, which is 1.06% crit and 112 AP. Plus 10 stam. Plus 1.17% more dodge.
---
How? Old game old stuff.
---
Does any hit above the 8% (or 9% if &lt;305 weapon skill) make a difference for hunter ranged damage? If not then the effectiveness of Warmonger really depends on the rest of your gear.
---
Druid is also the worst pre 20 class in the game
---
Thanks for the tips! It is a new laptop, so the thermal paste should be good. It is really rare to pass 78C temperature. About the Windows, I didn't know it could f-up the performance. I will try to set Radeon as default first.
---
Is the bobbing head next to life bars an add on as well? 
---
Sorry to add onto this "which add on is xxx" train. :P
---
Plz. Someone.
---
Youll be fineee, if you are really serious just keep a set of int gear on hand for healing dungeons. Thats it. Switch to your agi gear to tank/dps/lvl. Honestly I get whispers to tank/heal dungeons all the time, you will be desired haha.
---
Dude, divide the data so that it works per capita. You get ganked by orcs and undead more beacuse there are WAY more of those races than any other. And yeah, get bigger numbers
---
No, these numbers are from classic (well the beta of it), the difference in weapon skill benfits from pservers to classic is (in broad terms) that on classic the first 5 points is much much more valuable than on pservers, the next 2 (or 3 don't quite remember) is about the same and everything after that is worse.
---
Well I don't expect anything from you considering your reading comprehension level.
---
I've looked into the settings but couldn't find it : is there a way to show party member's hb in their HP bar? Right now I only see mine and it's annoying since I'm a healer...
---
Earlier on (maybe day 3 after launch) I was trying to find a group for WC as a warrior tank and I got invited to one with 3 DPS warriors and a priest.
---
The party leader was upset with me leaving. People are cray.
---
I use q e r f, 1 2 3 4 5. And then shift varients of all of those. Place your spells however you please. my main rotation MB, sw:p and mf and all on main numbers, heals on shift numbers. And other stuff like shields and shadow form, Dispels all on the letters
---
off the top of my head I use
---
Q, E, Shift+E, Shift+D, X, C, Shift+C, Shift+X, F, 1, 2, 3, then 2 extra mouse buttons and middle click mouse. Make sure you have A and D set to strafe and not turn.
---
F.
---
What's the max level differential to do Character Towing? Is it worth? (Lvl45 power lvling a lvl8)
---
Im obviously not being serious in game, I thought it was funny and wanted to share it so I posted it on here? You need to chill out snowflake, at the same time though reading these comments is making my day they're hilarious 😂
---
Yeah but you have the same range so you just need to learn what this "huge range" is and stay slightly outside of that and it works fine.
---
I've no idea at all, but my guess would be animation canceling to cast everything in the macro faster
---
Just make macros to do it
---
Has nth to do with retail doe
---
I know somewhat how clique works or at least how it used to work and it can run quite similarly as macros but each individual rule/bind must be set on its own in a huge list of binds you've already set. What drove me crazy was setting it up again if I had to reinstall the addon, install it on my other computer or if I wanted to switch my bindings. It wasn't a small task because I had to reconsidere a number of already existing binds. Eventually I switched to macros because they can do them all in one place without needing to bind them anywhere. If I need to switch things later, my setup won't crash and those macros are always with me.
---
They can do all the things you listed and some more simultaneously without need to activate two or more binds separately. Cast sequence and stance/form changes. There's no such thing as existing health pool detection or some other smart heal type of things. Only a few addon were able to do such thing and in my opinion reducing desiosion making takes a lot away from game. I want to do multiple things the same time and I want be fully in control.
---
Now THIS is pod racing!
---
I can't wait to see the begrudging response of "..no.." just to make their argument consistent.
---
Druids are bad. At least compared to the good classes/specs.
---
In some fantasy bubble-reality where just being able to get a job done counts as “good”, sure druids are fine.
---
it wasn't until I read your post that I realised why there is anything of interest in the picture
---
Yeah that’s my deal too.  Good for all purposes.
---
A body pull is when you (or your pet) get too close to a mob and it attacks. This is why it pays to be aware of what's around the tank, if e.g. your pet is lower level than the tank, or will pull if it runs further out than the tank has gone.
---
I don't usually use an owl so I might have missed something, but screech looks pretty beneficial. I've definitely been partied with another hunter using screech without issues.
---
Your pet should be on passive mode in instances, so that it can't attack without your direct input. I have attack bound to shift-mousewheel up to send it in, and shifr-mousewheel down bound to follow ro recall it. This quickly becomes very automatic, and a quick recall will save your party in many situations.
---
You just target the new mob and scroll your mousewheel to send the pet in. Then you can resume your last target
---
Any xp that dings you to 60 is exact :-)
---
I think a big issue with classic+ content is that even when people want some changes, not everyone can agree on it. Something new introduced could make 1 crowd very happy while alienating a different crowd.
---
For example, I'd love to see more content added that can hash out a lot of the unfinished zones. This could bring more quest, dungeons and possibly raids. However, I don't want any more linear progression as the gear gap between phase 1 and phase 6 is already huge. I'd rather see new gear that still falls someone in between that adds more horizontal progression which can open up more build options and even make meme specs viable. The last thing I wanna see is more leveling, catch-up mechanics/gear, or new content making old content obsolete. 
---
But on the other hand, I know a lot of players who would prefer to endlessly chase the carrot on the stick and just keep adding in harder content and gear with higher numbers.
---
Ohh well hate to be the bearer of bad News but this has been out since the first day of classic. 
---
Advertised on YouTube as well. Hell they even "sell" Thunderfury on that Website... it's crazy really
---
In the multiple BRD runs and farm sessions I've done it does seem like the Horde control the entrance *more often* but I've been ganked a fair number of times by Alliance holding it.
---
Similar for the BRS entrance.
---
If they fancy, that would do!
---
So in short, you say it's better to spend all mana before lifetapping, and then make sure I'm at 100% mana before next fight. Seems reasonable to be honest.
---
YOU SEE IVAN,
---
WHEN HOLD SWOORD LIKE ME,
---
YOU SHALL NEVER HIT THE INACCURATE
---
BECAUSE THE FEAR OF SLICING FINGERS!
---
not to say i would, but having someone on your account it would be so obvious to my Battle.net friends....That would be too shameful for me to do.
---
&gt;Honor system with no BG is going to suck for anyone leveling up.
---
&gt;So bring up your mains quickly.
---
*fixed.
---
Now this is some quality content.
---
Nah she doesn’t use reddit. She is a good healer though. Not entirely sure why I got down voted either, but that’s reddit I guess
---
Here's something weird that happened to me a few days ago. I was doing a ZF run and in the middle of the pyramid event I got a message that my game time has run out then promptly got disconnected.
---
I have the automatic renewal, so I could log back in immediately, but I shouldn't get booted out in those few seconds their server takes to renew my sub.
---
OP must be jealous of the Mage's skill.
---
I’m unfortunately hyper aware of this lol they flex their rng on me quite a bit.
---
Grats! Awesome your guild showed up
---
Is that you Eric cartman?
---
So you can't communicate things with your healer or ask the mage for more food than he gave you? It's not that hard!
---
EHG is like BiS game practically
---
Yeah, that's how it worked. The only "blacklist" power that existed was among the guilds clearing the content people wanted to see at a reasonable pace. And even then, you could be a dick because as long as you kept the drama out of raid/guild chat and pulled your weight they often weren't terribly concerned with your behavior outside the guild.
---
As someone who views PvE as a thing that you only do to get better at PvP...I can't wait. I'm already plotting out zones I plan on blockading / running quest interference...and I'm only lvl 35 ;)
---
classic.wowhead.com
---
Check for your class and BiS gear.
---
BiS is the optimal gear for each slot for your class that prioritizes the most important stats for what you will be doing with it, hence Best in Slot.
---
By no means is this necessary for raiding outside of a hardcore guild, there are always alternative pieces of gear that are easier to obtain that are similar, but it is a good guideline and ultimately what you want to grind for
---
I'm thinking i might hit 60 a year in, not everyone is into leveling asap. I'm savoring this like i've never savored a game before, so many like myself don't want it to change while we are enjoying it.
---
There is so much to do outside hard fast leveling, we don't run out of stuff to do is the nutshell, so we wont be screaming for new content and or changes.
---
We are quite happy, ecstatic in fact to have a community driven mmorpg to play again, and having the goal posts change in any way is simply not on our radar, and we all know what destroyed retail, changes!
---
Changes to appease the qq players, so because classic is the hottest game retail players think the need to be here too, but they should stay in the bed they made, not come here and start the qq disaster all over again.
---
The only thing better is Carapace Spine Crossbow, but yeah. DHC is not worth buying unless you have terrible luck with your weapon drops.
---
Yes but like wowhead is saying the eternal crown is the best BiS for Mage’s yet there’s nothing on it
---
That's exactly what I'm saying. What's so difficult to understand?
---
&gt; They rather think that I was banned for having a second b.net account under the same name and using them together.
---
What? You can have as much battle.net accounts as you desire. I have 5 all together from my old multi boxing days (before I realized I can use multiple wow accounts in one bnet account :3)
---
&gt; Did the Multiboxing software ISBoxer cause this ban?
---
While Blizzard has not (and never will) confirm ISBoxer can be used, I don't know anyone who was banned for using it. It's key stroke distribution, not any automated play/botting software. Also, usually, users of third party software are banned in waves, not just right after using it.
---
It is most likely because you shared your account, which is a violation to the TOS.
---
I mean people used to do that in VANILLA, it's not a WoW Classic invention.
---
Brain Hacker, Braincage, makes perfect sense. Wow
---
Don't overheal. There's always a temptation to keep all players max health at all times but it doesn't have to be the case. Also be aware if the tank pulls multiple mobs and may need intense healing for a while. I also recommend keeping different rank healing spells on your cast bar because you don't always need to use your max rank spell (also saves mana).
---
Hope that's helpful!
---
It's the second best pre-raid weapon. That's like saying Krol Blade or Mirah's Song isn't good for melees.
---
We're dealing with anime body pillow types here. Just the thought of someone else growing up and getting their life in order gives them chills
---
Heya all! Having a hard time choosing a main for classic so far. I have a Warlock, Mage, Hunter, Shaman, Rogue.. so far. I have all those classes ranging from about 16-28, with my Rogue being the lowest.
---
I work 50ish hours a week so I won't be raiding any time soon, but won't matter too much because my 'main' goal will be pvp/5mans for the most part, I prefer light PvE but am more PvP centric. I would like to casually raid on Sat nights when I get a chance down the line.
---
I usually prefer mobile bursty classes that are 'tricky'. I enjoy being able to pull off skill shots and 1vX. I played Engineer and Dagger/Dagger Ele on GW2. Marksman/Nightstalker on Rift. ESO I played a Stam Sorc. For the most part I like having tools in any situation that will allow me to use my creativity as a tool instead of sheer damage. I like a lot of versatility and being able to approach a situation from a variety of ways. I know classic is very much rock/paper/scissors, but I never got to 60 back when I played, so I would like some opinions or suggestions if you have em, thanks! (Also, something that does well against getting ganked in open world would be awesome!)
---
The amount of elation and salt in one picture is a level we though unreachable till now.
---
It was great! Thank you!
---
Why would I do all that when I can just dismiss and call? Does it really matter at all or is this some sort of WoW dick measuring contest?
---
I have guild slaves for sappers and I use gnomish rocket boots
---
It's against ToS in general, however you are allowed to share with family members who are minors. In this case they both are.
---
Night Elf Warrior? They do have some slick attack animations...
---
Faction lock can not really do anything about unbalance created due to people transfering. I dont know what was the initial cause but you can not start randomly delete people characters just because many of the other factions players decideed to go, and that created faction unblanace issues.
---
30 Rock, so far so good at episode 12 now
---
Because of their racials, swords are best for human rogues. You can still go dagger, but sword is top
---
Swords are best in PvE and Daggers are best in PvP, so if you switch to swords, your DPS should increase
---
I am currently a level 35 Dwarf rogue and i'm leveling combat swords. I have no issues questing alone, but in PvP it's a little rough
---
I'd personally recommend staying with your current build. Daggers are more fun, especially with the PvP aspect of it. Plus, you won't have to fight for dagger upgrades in dungeons like you will with swords
---
Sure, though you can expect to have mana issues, and your totems won't be as useful.
---
"Poor AFK player" - continues to sit &amp; drink!
---
Cow reporting in!
---
I might be wrong, as I last read a class changes in the BFA beta. But there all classes got their raid buffs back which were removed in Legion (at least some), only warlock didn‘t get Dark Intent back but instead got their last buff taken away
---
The other guy who tries to stop them is clearly the tank.
---
Swear i was in a group with (a) Sus two days ago on Anathema
---
Go ahead and try that. I'm not suggesting that you need on Bop.
---
You can pretend Bop and BOE items are mechanically the same and that a 3g vendor is just the same as a 300g Bop, but you still end up looking silly
---
I think having 2 accounts is the least likely reason for the ban. And I think the most likely reason is if your account was played at home and in Russia at the same time.
---
I agree that those who enjoy retail more are naturally going to have cleared more mythic raids/keys. 
---
However...
---
&gt; Conclusion: classic is easier   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;  Thus they enjoy it more since they manage to do things, which they cannot in retail 
---
This doesn't make sense. I don't think those players cannot do things in retail because classic is, as you said, easier. It probably stems from the fact that they just don't like retail. To me, it's overstimulating and homogenized. Yes, high mythic keys are challenging and I like their addition to the game, but I don't like how it has pushed players to become valued only for their gear scores. Also, why would I want to push for high mythics if I don't like what the game has become? Do I have the ability to do it? Possibly, but I don't even care enough to try. 
---
&gt; Slow =/= hard 
---
And in Classic, simple =/= easy. Is Classic a more simple game than Retail? For the most part, yes. However, let's just look at leveling: how many times do you die while leveling in retail? How many times in Classic? The whole leveling process is much more engaging. Your position matters. Your resources matter. Pull too many mobs? Dead. Oom? Dead. Overconfident and not healing yourself? Dead (after missing and getting resisted 8 times in a row on a mob that is 1 hit from death!).
---
&gt; Grind =/= hard
---
I have yet to see someone claiming classic is harder because of the grind. In fact, people always bring up how Classic has so much grind, yet I fail to see how it is more of a grind than retail. Yes, it takes longer to get to max level, but I don't need to farm AP. I don't need to farm Pathfinder so that I can move efficiently in the world. I don't need to do dailies/WQ.
---
Conclusion: If we are comparing Mythics to Classic, yes, Classic is easier. But being able to do more endgame content (since there is no scaling difficulty) is not the reason the Classic fans enjoy Classic more.
---
I so badly want to transfer from biggles to heartseeker, but they don't allow transfers there :(
---
First aid is a pretty big need. I don't know how many times a gouge + bandage or blind + bandage has saved me.
---
Green trinket from hinterlands.. guard captains mark or something. 20 atp and 1% hit I believe?  Could be wrong. This and black hands would be even better yeah? Just asking for personal knowledge growth.  Ty
---
Horde get basically better everything in Classic. Better travel between continents. Better flight paths. Better dungeon options in their zones (so you don't have to worry about getting camped while trying to form up for a dungeon). Better racial abilities.
---
Pretty much the only thing Horde don't flat out win is the shaman versus paladin split. Paladins are way better PvE picks than Shaman and literally the best PvP healer in the game. The only edge Shaman has is WF totem for melee cleave groups and just that in general, enhance is a bit better than ret.
---
Why has this not been gilded yet?
---
Good. We have a lot of survivability in a group. As long as we are not tanking, we will regenerate our own health over the course of a fight - just to rinse and repeat the life tapping to the next fight.
---
ClassicAuraDurations
---
There's a legit mod reply about multiboxing is not against TOS. If you've banned because of logging in Russia and then Canada, I feel bad for that. Sometimes I forget my VPN open, without noticing any lag, might take people's account into risk.
---
That's 100% your gear. 
---
Gear can more than double your health pool as a mage. Starting at 40, Ice Barrier vastly expands your health pool as well. You can utilize it 3 times even in a short, 15-second PvP.
---
If you can find a group then spellcleave will be easier and quicker. If you're on a popular realm or have any competition at AoE spots then it begin to be not worth it. AoE farming was more for the people that got ahead of the curve. Plus people are going to want to fuck with you (I know because I have fucked with AoE ally mages).
---
Dominos I believe
---
Plus it doesn't hurt if you're an extremely under played class like druid.
---
The Horde aren't superior though. Paladins are a massive advantage. I think the Horde just has a bit more mass appeal. There are a lot of people in top tier guilds who say that they'd rather play Horde, but their guild went Alliance because of Paladins.
---
Really? The tooltip says something about 'poisons up to level 25'. I'd always just kinda figured that enemies over level 25 would do poisons you couldn't cure - is that not the case?
---
God I would marry a druid tank that healed a bit once in a while, while I was getting mana or if a lock just decided to go 1hp without eating or drinking for a dungeon :(
---
Okey ty!
---
WHAT 9000?
---
In the end it's really what you enjoy playing most. If you're on an active pvp server, drain tanking is often noted as being more effecient, but otherwise it's really just how you want to play. Personally, I loved the excitement that drain tanking brought, you always had to think on your toes and be balancing life/mana efficiently so you can chain pull. Plus I did crazy damage in dungeons and essentially never ran out of mana with dark pact, which was nice. I'm *really* missing dark pact now that I hit 60 and switched to sm/ruin, it was so useful.
---
If you change movement keys to ESDF you get more keys to bound but if you have small hands you might not reach shift ctrl alt as easily.
---
To answer more about what you asked, I usually have spells which are used reactively primarly on A G and C, the most used spells are on W R. Mouse buttons are stance keys, like shadowform or hunter aspect swaps. 234 are potions. Silence and other interruptions mouse scroll
---
You only hit it once for the skill. Most of the stuff up until Mithril is pretty trash anyway.
---
How tf you get 1k gold by the time you hit 60??
---
Ive busted my ass collecting and selling everything, playing the AH and still have like 300g  at 60.. Are you all mad luckers with boe's or what? I havent got a single epic or nice boe to sell..
---
400 iq moves right here
---
Not more than getting say a 40 then a 50 specifically
---
Yes they all stack. Skarm has a video somewhere about a crazy AoE warrior tanking build he put together using thorns damage items.
---
Hunter pet really doesn't have any AI. You either let it attack or you call it back. Knowing how to control your pet is essential if you want to be a good hunter.
---
Can you correct my understanding? 
---
 * Clicking it once should cast Arcane Power, triggering the GCD. Then stopcast is used which doesn't do anything since Aracane Power is instant cast. Then Fire Ruby, PoM, and Pyro all fail because of GCD. 
---
* Clicking it again would try to cast Arcane Power but fail because it is on cooldown, not triggering the GCD. It would then successfully cast Fire Ruby. 
---
* The next click would successfully cast PoM.
---
* The next click would successfully cast Pyro.
---
* A total of 4 clicks would be needed because of the GCD, but stopcasting would be redundant in every part of this macro except for the beginning to stop spells casted before this macro started.
---
- of the frozwn wrath, yeah..
---
Man, this sub has turned into a resentful circlejerk
---
As a holy pally? Mana pots are absolutely invaluable in dungeons, it's your "Oh Shit" button, as there's literally nothing you can do but hope people don't die while you drink if you go OOM.
---
I'm running BRD atm and it's on and off. More horde than allies yes but nowhere near SM. SM is in hordes backyard so it's always been like that even on alliance dominated servers. I also had no problems questing in arathi, Desolace, searing gorge etc. Badlands and STV were shitshows.
---
Owning a painting doesn't give one the right to choose who created it.
---
Make. Yourself. Happy.
---
One of the bankers is fake
---
Right now the market is flooded with materials.  The only thing to do is to play the long game and buy up stuff that's selling for MUCH cheaper than it will be in phase 2 when layering is removed.  I've had some luck selling gromsblood, but nothing from fishing or cooking has been remotely worth selling at AH prices yet.
---
Look for a hunter dueling guide online. It will probably assume you are 60 and have certain spec. But it will give you some concrete strategies against the different classes
---
I farmed these for like 3 hours, then I noticed they were going for 30g early on so I sold it to pay for my mount. Went back and farmed it some more and got another one for myself. It‘s a bit of a struggle for alliance players but that made it sell for 30 gold.
---
Please teach me how. Still cant set it up
---
the margins on bags is so low with all these people levelling tailoring that it's not worth it putting them up for auction - I just vendor them.
---
faerlina
---
Plus power in terms of political pull etc rather than literal strength. Like duh a regular human can be a lynchpin in the entire plan, not everyone has to be sekrit mage demon gods?
---
I'm so glad I rolled on Grobbulus day 1. 51% Alliance 49% Horde split and a really nice friendly community.
---
There’s always one....sigh
---
When an item says &lt;random enchantment&gt; that means that when it drops it can have a big variety of stats on it. If the Eternal crown drops with +40-41 Frost spell damage then it is bis for frost mages.
---
Yeah it took me a good 5 minutes to realise what I was meant to be looking at lmao

---
You can tell by the name you're dealing with a classy individual.
---
Except nobody gives a shit if the dps leaves.
---
it doesnt
---
private servers do have changes tho, they have pre-1.7 itemization and honor system is out on release.
---
Really that depends on the dungeon and how the DPS is geared and leveled. I've been in some dungeons where DPS pulls aggro and is just getting absolutely wrecked, totally wiping out my mana if I bother to heal them. I don't mind a regrowth/rejuv but if I have to spam my heals on DPS I'm not even going to bother.
---
Fury/prot with dual wield is way better dps and threat, both if our raids maintanks does it.
---
Would not advice for mediocre guilds though.
---
Horde filth
---
As a mage, the most annoying is mobs with spell interrupts. Enemies with really high attack speed are also annoying.
---
Enemy casters are the least annoying because I can usually kill them before they get more than one or two spells off, and I can always counterspell if need be.
---
if you farm a 3% drop rate item for 20 attack power then there is something wrong with you, just wait for class quests and get some good trinkets from that 
---
or just eat agility potions every time you do anything for much better return on time invested/return
---
The Mankrik's Wife meme is just as old as the others listed!
---
You don't start out fury tanking. You start prot and when the guild is geared you use DW so warriors can go even more ham.
---
While those are done for threat, they aren't done "because" like BF sometimes is.
---
It aint vanilla without hunters named legolas
---
Thank you! In vanilla I did Thunderbluff Exalted on my troll hunter by mainly - iirc - handing stuff during the AQ contribution phase. 
---
It's nice with info on how to do it in the current phase, so thank you very much! - now do I want a 'saber or a mecha-chocobo on my Dwarf?
---
Nope on the BOE's.  I had one epic, it was the level 46 shammy item that sells for 15g.
---
I just farmed high yield mobs while leveling as well as gathering proffs.  Put stuff on AH.  
---
It is a boring way to level, but I played creepy stories on youtube while leveling.  That kept me awake and focused.
---
I just hit level 22 last night
---
As someone else said don't keep everyone topped all the time. The best way to heal is to allow the tank to drop to 40% or so (or whatever is safe) and then heal him up with your most efficient healing spell, usually your largest heal. Obviously if one cast takes him to 80% or something don't cast another to overheal. After this, try not to cast again for as long as possible to take advantage of the 5 second rule, which allows your mana to start regenerating after 5 seconds of not casting. Your job is not to keep everyone at full hp, it is to prevent people dying, and spend as little time drinking as possible in order to allow the dungeon to flow smoothly.
---
So heal up, then wand/attack until you have to heal again. Obviously if you feel you can spare the mana you can throw a damage spell out once in a while Too. The main skill is managing your mana over the course of a dungeon.
---
+15 agi isn't coming to phase 3

There's no report from Belgium in the blue posts responds yet, it might help if you follow the link and report it :)

I wondered about the dungeon group that 4 people had need on that.
---
Then I remembered this is a 10 player dungeon.
---
I'm having 'Nam-like flashbacks to this
---
you farm the zombies solo?
---
Part of the charm is the preparation. There's nothing wrong with using *every* profession to your benefit. Cooking to get Well Fed. First Aid for Heavy Runecloth bandages and curing poisons.
---
Engineering for every trick in the book. Other professions for BoP items, such as Blacksmithing and a fear-resistance trinket.
---
I mean have you played the game and tried finding a group for dungeons? Even non-AoE groups with one mage have these idiots running amok, its not a circle jerk its an actual meme-able thing happening just like huntards in 2004, these people here the class is amazing discover AoE spellcleave and then when they’re at at-level dungeons with normal pulls all they still do is AoE spellcleave instead of their one most effective job: frostbolt spam, it fucks up aggro for everyone, the tank loses aggro cause of blizzard, 3 mobs are running towards mage, mob im attacking is now attacking me so healer has to heal me and mage and tank now instead of just tank, so they run out of mana faster, its literally the most frustrating situation and it happens with 90% of mages I’ve encountered and they also happen to be the most populous DPS in classic. 
---
Its not a circle jerk, if you’re spell cleaving in a non blizzard spam group you’re screwing up aggro and damage for the whole group.

If you read the post you'd know he's found the time to unwind without neglecting his family. Or are you suggesting she should be fine looking after 2 soon to be 3 kids by herself while he's locked in a room moving pixels on screen?
---
While true, overall that's a fairly small nitpick
---
Try asking a GM, maybe you're lucky :)
---
Ah okay, just forget all other trees for now? I already have points spread across :P
---
For me personally no, its a damage increase for them as well.
---
If its better and you are with a PUG its always worth rolling need.

I don't think Blizz will release phase 2 until the vast majority of players hit 60.

&gt;and it wasn't seeking to foster an anti-vanilla community that breaks the rules. There's a call coming this week that argues some of the opposing points, which will hopefully have some points raised that you want to hear.  Again, apologies if this call let you down due to the views expressed.

How do u strafe?

Or ya know I am not an asshole and understand ranged weapons are melees stat sticks.

its hard to do good dps with fire when the mobs are immune or resistant to fire damage.

That's your view, i'm in a massive guild where well over 250 players are on at any given time and about 80% of them are in their 20's, and yes we have many 60's too, who are far from bored? A small sub set of players are always going to rush to cap and scream done i'm bored, they are like the way they play obtrusive, and far from any majority.
---
Classic is here becasue blizz was losing millions of players to private servers with #nochanges, for many, many, many, many years so i doubt a 3 month mark will be any telling story here.
---
Like any mmorpg's they lose players after launch, and layersing was going to savethe day for that, and how layering was going to be gone within a couple weeks once everyone went cool "nostalgia man" and went back to retail, but wtf? there seems to be no end to layering for the foreseeable future.
---
This game is way beyond nastalgia, it's here to stay, and here to play, for those whom love classic #nochanges, its just blizz servery underestimated the core player base and once again proved to us all that they really don';t understand their player base. I mean wow have they ever lost touch.
---
I don't know enough rogue math to quantify the difference in dps, but if it's an upgrade, roll need. Marginal or massive, doesn't matter.
---
I think your account being accessed on a daily basis in both Russia and Canada will trigger an automated system. A human may not have ever looked at this. That is what the appeals are for.

For alliance, absolutely do the Nathanos Blightcaller questline.  It starts in the SW throne room.  It gives a roughly 63 dps wand and ends with a pretty tough boss fight against Nathanos himself.  So nice to actually kill him and I am very happy he won't be coming back at all.
---
Always roll need if the gear you are getting is strictly better than what you are currently using, and you plan to equip it right away.
---
some people seem to not like druids but I love inviting them with one exception:  unless I have someone else in my group capable of rezzing, I prefer them not to be the healer.  If i have a shaman dps or something though that can do the rez part or i'm just confident in my group, then i'll totally grab a druid healer.
---
*THE GREATER GOOD*
---
I don't play Shaman but I do have Shamans in my guild healing up to ~55 (BRD) as Enh with some healer gear on.
---
You're making shaman tanks look so good. Keep it up.
---
Isn't Alienware completely overpriced just because of the brand name? I just looked up 34' inch monitors and Alienware is like 3-4x more than a really good basic brand monitor.
---
The only reason to go fury tanking dual-wield is so your dps can go ham. If you don’t have any dps chasing you in threat or holding back their dps, there’s no benefit to it.
---
I ran through Hinterlands on my Ally character yesterday and only got killed once. People here are exaggerating how bad it is. Not saying it isn’t bad, but you just have to play smart. If you’re getting corpse camped move to a different zone, if the quest mobs are all dead go do a different quest, etc.
---
Westfall - PvE, east coast.  We were in that second batch of servers created between the first announced and launch.  I think we're in that sweet spot of highly populated but not so high as to have queues.  If you're looking for an Alliance guild then PM me.
---
A lot of people get their thrash blade at 47. You can accept the quest at 45, though
---
I’m glad I’m not the only one. I would have hit 60 3 times by now but I keep rerolling,
---
I’ve finally settled on a Druid as my main and a shadow priest as my alt and I think I’m finally satisfied? And this is after going through holy priest, warlock, Paladin,  AND hunter - rolling some of them more than once.

OP is cringe as hell and I'm glad he got THOROUGHLY called out.
---
I'm curious, does the winning party win anything from this or it's just for the fun of it? Like, any loot from big dudes like thrall? Or when the honor system is implemented, any honor/dishonor points from this?
---
Two thoughts. No one forced you to play on a PvP server and no one made y'all burn through a six months to a year of content in a couple of weeks.
---

---
You have two ways to damage as rogue.
---
You have white damage (autoattack) and yellow damage (abilities). White damage will benefit directly from your offhand, meaning more dps on offhand weapon = more damage per offhand hit.
---
Yellow damage only benefits from main hand weapon (which is why its often recommended to have a slow mainhand, and a fast offhand).
---
The stats apply to all.
---
If its an upgrade, roll need. If you want to sell, roll greed. If its a bigger upgrade for someone else, its up to you to decide if you want to roll need or not.
---
Can you please stop attacking and assuming, we're not in an argument about this. No this was on the OG vanilla and we even had tournaments for it.
---
"Just play afk or mute if you dont feel like making water right now."
---
No one will pay 1 silver per water.
---
Still doesn't prevent a random group of heroes to go in there and kill everyone.
---
No, you're not suggesting that I need on BoP. I'm just saying that your logic can be used to extrapolate in that direction, is therefore a slippery slope, and is therefore faulty.
---
Can't say for totem, but for Windfury weapon it does. And then each hit of windfury weapon can also glance.
---
Did you even read what he wrote? The image is total fabrication and of the cringiest kind where he set up every detail.
---
unless you have lots of +healing gear, always use your biggest heal (most mana efficient) **without** overhealing.  ideally you want to wait as long as possible between heals so you can stand around get mana regeneration going.  periodic big heals is better for this as opposed to constant little heals.
---
having said that, don't be afraid to bust out your quick heals if the situation calls for it, e.g. multiple people taking damage, and/or someone is going down really fast.
---
don't neglect your own health.  your life &gt; tank's life &gt; DPS lives.  
---
bring plenty of water, especially if you're doing multiple runs and no mage is in the group.
---
I still dont agree that it is important in pvp. The randomness of when the batches line up just make it a crap shoot inncertain situations. The people I saw wanting it back were people maining rogues who liked that they could run at a mage, spam gouge, and every now and then they get a lucky gouge on a blink. Ive never once seen a person use this to their advantage in a rrliable way, and I played a lot on original vanilla and on private servers.
---
you will only need the 5g skill for lv 43+ mobs. So not worth it at the moment.

Nope, not too many bankers. Just go ahead and open the new bank window and "trade" your valuable mats and items. You can even trad- err I mean deposit gold as well.

I don't play on an RP server and get made fun of for it sometimes. Nothing makes me happier than the idea of others carrying this on.
---
Had a 60 Undead rogue help my group with the kill, he was super nice about it and waited for us all to arrive and then tried to tank the 2 adds.
---
Also had a Tauren druid in SoS come emote at me and lead me to where a quest mob just spawned he knew I was waiting for.
---
Most of the time, I get ganked on sight. But those 2 guys, they are heroes.

How about you not give them even more free advertising
---
Everything has an armor value you can reduce. Even clothies. Always do at least a couple sunders.
---
Bloodrage is fixed damage and its a negligable amount. One tick of health regen out of combat will replace it.
---
At low levels you dont have a whole ton of abilities. Heroic strike is worth using until you have a better ability to use instead. At higher levels use heroic strike if you have too much rage. Thats defined in the guide there.
---
Armor is super important. Having all armor of the same type... not so much. While levelling its ok to mix some leather with your mail up till level 30 or so. At 30 youre gonna get class quests that will get you decent mail for several gear slots and after that is scarlet monastery... youll be all mail in no time until you unlock plate at 40 ... and then 40 to 45 youll be all plate.
---
Spirit is for out of combat regen only. Theres a stat guide on wowhead that will tell you the rate

Charge and intercept dont share a cooldown. Charge makes rage. Intercept costs rage. Intercept can be used in combat though.
---
Wrong. It was already 65%+ Horde when transfers opened.
---
I lived it dude. It sucked. The game was unplayable in many key regions. The imbalance made it miserable.
---
Yea then sorry my bad. hunters who need on dal rend are jerks
---
They'd have to change/remove the attunement quest though -- I don't think we'd be going to all those BC dungeons if it was Classic+...
---
Well im happy for i am mage and find groups easy. Fuck me if i was any other dps though. Have fun finding teams.
---
I've opened an appeal. The message I got from Blizzard via email states:  *Our team issued this suspension only after a careful review of relevant evidence. Our support staff will not overturn this penalty and may not respond to appeals.*
---
How much of the AoE damage he did was warrior-specific? Paladin can stack the sme thorn effects and get even better threat. What pala can't do is survive through it. Why? Because paladins don't have access to the same tanking gear warriors have - warrior tier sets are tank sets, while paladin tier sets are all healing gear
---
I'll level 3 mages bank alts to lvl 20 just because of this post.

He starts at 9. He's not stealing anything from anyone. Just going in early while wife and kids are still asleep. You obviously don't have kids or you'd understand choosing video games over spending time with your kids makes you a shitty person
---
I fucking would.. dude its a tip, and still way cheaper than the vender, id offer him 50S for 2 stacks or some shit
---
I would move the shaman to the priest/warrior group so you can make use of windfury totem and you can stick with enhance while your priest friend heals and your warrior friend tanks.
---
If you leave them in current groups though, I'd say go feral on druid and tank so your warrior buddy can dps if he wants to and let the priest heal and on your shaman i'd still stay enhance but carry an int set if you can for healing dungeons as needed.  if you go caster on shaman you'll be fighting your two clothy friends for gear too much.
---
I'm currently leveling a warlock and a shaman, struggling to settle on which one to play as my main! Warlock has lots of little details like soul shards, soul stone, healthstones, minion management (though they can pretty much run on auto-pilot if you can't be bothered) though combat can feel a little slow to me sometimes as it takes a few seconds for DoTs to fire up.
---
Shaman, I'm having a great time macro'ing all the totems and have survived a few fights I thought I had definitely lost through the use of a quick heal thrown in whilst running back and dropping the slowing totem.
---
For me it comes down to this - like cloth armor and ranged combat? Go warlock. Want a melee fighter, or a mix of melee with some ranged ability and a bit of healing thrown into the mix? Go shammy. I'd recommend playing both at least to level 10 or 15 to get a basic feel for gameplay style, however personally I'm leaning towards shaman
---
Horde players laughing now. Wait til they have 1hr+ BG queues
---
Well you being silenced is automated
---
Where did he say it wasnt staged? He is still telling the truth.
---
Yeah fully agree. When I said have it’s place, meant in the wider PVP discussion, not just 1v1
---
Yesterday I rolled need for the hypnotic blade ( 26,8 dps, 1.4 speed, 8int, 3 spirit, +9 healing) 
---
My previous offhand was swinetusk shank (23,0 dps, 6 stamina, 4 spirit)
---
Now I’m feeling guilty of a crime. Maybe I shouldn’t have rolled need. The priest was very disappointed. Is this clearly a healer/caster dagger? 
---
How should I judge these situations?
---
It is investment and it will pay off.
---
Weapon speed in off hand is more important.
---
Ashbringer!! I'm horde its a very good 50/50 server,  Nice small queues in the evenings / weekends, so population is nice and full
---
The issue is that HoJ is a massive upgrade for melee, while only a marginal difference for hunters. Hunters should pass on HoJ unless no on else needs it.
---
Just like I would pass on a ranged weapon if a hunter needed it, even if it's an upgrade or a BIS item for me.
---
I shouldn't have to say this, it should just be common sense.
---
It's completely normal to pay for water if you're not in a guild/group with that player. It takes some time and they absolutely don't have to do it for you plus it's still cheaper than vendor. Sure some are super kind and will give it for free but I wouldn't blacklist someone for having price tag on their time.
---
Can verify. My entire guild rerolled (after I hit 50 on my 2 weeks vacation :( ) to Kromcrush and honestly, it was one of the best decisions I've made. We're having 10x more fun now and the WPVP is a blast. 
---
This game is more painful than fun when layers are so overpopulated and you're constantly surrounded by 3:1 enemy players.
---
fuck man.    
---
I think I'll just roll an alt if it gets too bad.
---
I'd love to see this in action! :D
---
I honestly prefer going to bed early with her and getting up earlier. That's just me though.

I wouldn't call trolls inherently malevolent. Remember they are the ORIGINAL inhabitants of Azeroth, and the ones who single handedly held the minions of the old gods at Bay and actually shattered their empire to the point where they were forced to scatter and form into three different insectoid species. 
---
Many tribes of trolls are hostile to the races of Azeroth because they see them as usurpers and Invaders of lands that were traditionally ruled by trolls. This doesn't excuse their xenophobic and hostile behaviour, but I wouldn't describe them as inherently evil/malevolent like say, The Lich King.

---
Yeah, the crypts have always been there.
---
Im open to TBC but it needs to have certain things changed to fit the better things vanilla had going for it
---
1) No flying mounts. Ever.
---
2) Removing high level players from Azeroth makes Azeroth feel more empty. Find a way to improve this problem.
---
3) No welfare epics
---
4) Do not raise the cap to 70 otherwise 60 endgame content becomes useless
---
If they can't implement these changes then I don't want TBC added.
---
Wallmart pet*
---
At First I tried the Voidwalker, but it cannot hold aggro most of the time due to warlocks generating a ton of threat with almost any ability
---
In the mid 30s I respeced into drain tanking and loved it immediately, especially when hitting lvl 40 and learning Dark pact. It's so much better than VW and so much easier to use than imping
---
#Succ Squad
---
Those enchants are not in the game yet and wont be for potentially months. It makes zero sense to use them now as "bis" when you don't have the enchants, especially since they actually are bis for other classes.
---
My only issue with it is getting a group together at the time I play that will finish off the dungeon. I've been in and out of there on my priest between the levels of 18 and 24, and not once gotten a group who would finished it. **I want my damned staff** before the content is pointless to run otherwise!
---
No, I'm not suggesting that. For a real obvious reason.
---
Needing on a BoP to sell that someone else can equip, there's a loser. Nobody would ever gear up if everyone always needed on everything.
---
Needing on BoE's, there's no loser. It's worth *exactly* the same to everyone else. Everyone gets a 1/5 shot to something they all need. The winner can even decide to gift it away, or sell at lower cost. In this situation, *everyone* is a winner, because they all got a chance, and no losers.
---
It's a simple concept really
---
Yeah I guess your right tbh. If the dps isn't pulling aggro off me then a guess there's no benefit to it other than having 1 member do better dps (me). 
---
Question but since I prefer the playstyle (it's obviously much faster) ... Would I be a detriment going fury early on compared to prot?
---
WITNESS ME, BROTHERS!
---
Lowkey Westworld reference?
---
I plan to, it's a fun build.
---
I tank with a 2H Ret / Holy spec (13 Ret the rest holy). Seal of Command does insane dmg to the point where I am nearly out performing the DPS. Consecration for AoE and you need to keep your grp focused on one target / spread your attacks to hold aggro. Toss Righteous Fury on you and Blessing of Sanctuary on DPS and you're good. 
---
I've considered a shield but I'd rather have the extra dmg, SoC does best with 2H as well (SoR is pitiful in comparison, one hit from SoC does more dmg than 6 SoR) and since Holy Dmg is my bread and butter for holding threat I figure this is the way to go
---
Obviously, DalRend is not the answer!
---
BLUTOSMASH SMASH SMASH
---
Are you *trying* to make my point?
---
What is the whole 'Equivalency Point' thing all about? Can you explain what that is and how we're supposed to use that?
---
Not everyone has the same opinion, and you're being an ass about it saying your opinion is the only right one and everyone else in an idiot. 
---
I think if it is an upgrade, then anyone who it is an upgrade for should be able to roll for it without getting flamed because "I USE THEM MORE!". But I wont whine when someone "who doesn't get the full use of the item" wins an item over my roll. 
---
If you want only specific players to roll for items you should only run dungeons with your guild or whatever, people that have the same idea from the get-go, instead of assuming your way is the right and only way to do things.
---
Which doesn't come out till phase 3, by which point any Hunter worth a shit will have better/be aiming to take BiS from other classes in BWL so now we've come full circle.
---
greens with +frost damage if you're real lazy.
---
The downside of DoT damage is that it has to ramp up, which isn't going to happen on most dungeon trash. Also if a mob dies with dots on it then you've wasted mana. I stick with Shadow Bolt and maybe Corruption for dungeons.
---
Not cash money at all
---
Valid point!
---
It's the purest humor. I found [this picture](https://i.redd.it/83p2l95emnq01.jpg)while scrolling reddit on a sleepless night. I god damn howled, the gutteral mouth farts I produced should not be heard by anyone. No context what so ever, just Aragorn grinning like "hhhhey bby u want the royal experience".
---
Please don’t learn anything from Asmongold, he is for slapstick entertainment only.
---
I love it
---
I wonder how you are *supposed* to tank that upcoming room. You always pull them to that corridor, but then ranged people are there where this guy was, and someone always gets booted down to whelps. As a tank I'm tanking the packs my back against corridor's walls but should everyone else be back against walls too? I'm not entirely sure if those units do the charge knockback always or just when someone steals aggro.
---
What's BiS mean? I've been trying to understand for a few weeks now and can't seem to find the answer to the acronym :(
---
I could see them finally making it a raid if classic+ was ever a thing
---
you can only buy the wolf atm at mount vendor
---
Do you find movies cringey? What about skits? Speeches? All of these are set up, it doesn't make them inherently bad, less acceptable or less entertaining.
---
I’m trying to tell you its not a circle jerk and if you arent seeing all of these AoE spamming mages then you probably are one lol.
---
I don't. Because the no changes people, who want the game exactly as it was, would obviously know that FD into trap was certainly a thing back in the day. It you legit saw anyone mention "no changes" in their comment and then say that this wasn't a bug in that same comment, they were trolling.
---
Hillsbrad is very pvp active imo. Basically a constant fight for the yeti cave control.
---
Thousand needles is very horde oriented in my experience and made it “easier.”
---
I did both, depending on my mood.
---
Mount+ the skill Costs 100g. As a ork you can only buy wolves (I think in OG)
---
If you are honored with the orcs Mount+skill costs 10g less
---
I leave tips. When something is mandatory its no longer a tip, its a fee.
---
*camp taurajo, thousand needles, take me home, on the gold road*
---
How are Paladin at leveling? What spec should I level as? I want to heal eventually can I do holy to level? Also, are they able to farm mobs at 60?
---
I don't have any data to compete with your numbers, but as a Kromcrush Horde player I definitely see what seems like an even number of enemies to friendlies almost everywhere. It feels super even.
---
Depends on time of day too it feels like. Around 8-10 I start seeing Allies outnumbering Horde everywhere. Again just my experience, I don't have any data to back it.
---
How do they fare at the moment? I take it both are doing well? 
---
What kinda gear are they running as well? Pure dps hit/crit or a mix of dps and defensive pieces?
---
Which mobs?
---
Meets every definition of a circlejerk. But ok.
---
Yeah in wpvp cloth isn't much of an option. I used rank 1 flash of light as my last resort.
---
Well to be totally honest with you. Just get what you can and is feasible. Don't go out of your way too much for this stuff. Craft what is craftable, buy what is buyable and get from dungeons what you can be asked to get :D
---
The first MC clear in the first week was made up of a lot of 60's in Greens and not very much pre-BIS they even had a lot of People that weren't even 60.
---
BIS is nice to have - but it is in no way shape or form necessary to do Ony or MC. You will be totally fine. 
---
Just check what your pre-bis advises you to get and if you can't be asked to do certain dungeons for a Piece. Just buy something off the AH that aims for similar stats but is a Little worst.
---
All this pre-BIS is bad for the game - you don't Need it and the more People that get it - the more People will ask for it in order to get invited...
---
Just get what you can - get enchantments and bufffood. That Shows you know what you are doing and are dedicated. That should be worth way more than stupid pre-BIS
---
Druid for that 24 second sprint.
---
Yeah, charms are more ~2g per charm (I think 24 gold for 8 stacks) on my server at the moment, I'd be paying 70+ gold for them in total. Groups are farming it 24/7 to make profit from it. It's pretty insane right now.
---
And yeah, Armory seems pretty neat for warriors, no wonder people keep looking for tanks for the library and for healers in the armory ;).
---
That’s the one I used to use on the loch Modan side right?
---
How can you remember a lvl57 riding a mount that requires lvl60?
---
Bigglesworth is a good time, depending on what you're into. Alliance act like honorless thugs, so it's very satisfying to KOS, or be the bigger person when the mood strikes you.
---
Green whelpling is worth more. I sold mine for &gt; 2k back in the days.
---
Well yeah, it has caster stats. It CAN be an upgrade for you, but you're clearly not the intended wielder of it. I'd have given casters priority.
---
Zerker rage is how warriors generate rage off being hit. If youre trying to do burst damage youll hit it. Demo wont break you out of stealth. Tc isnt super expensive. And unless youre backing off too far in stealth to re engage ill hit with it.
---
I literally had thee same chest/ shoulders/ hat / knife and offhand on my priest and I thought the exact same thing.
---
&gt; But I wont whine when 
---
Yes you will. Just not here, on forums, where things arent dropping.
---
you're not that good at math aren't you mate?
---
Is 7 days a boost?
---
That's about(maybe more) than what it took me to reach 60 on my own.
---
It definitely would yes. you just aren't geared enough. Relax a bit and give it a couple weeks, you get tank gear really fast as MT.
---
I know some people level them to 5 to get enchanting.  Mine is level 1.
---
Going in to work early is dishonest?
---
Well I mean the man's got a point. This is like a screenshot of Eyes Wide Shut, but cast exclusively with neck beards.
---
I mean I am not. I stated I watched Skarms video which peaked my interest. Just stated Asmongold is the only person I've seen currently doing it on live servers and it worked. 
---
Hence the post for more information regarding it ....

Fair point! It just gets confusing when I was hearing skarm explain block values and defensive rating and showing how those numbers don't matter "as" much. But i was finding it difficult to determine if that was just at all ... or when higher levels of gear came into play. 
---
It's just a super cool concept but I am wanting to learn everything I can about it before I ding 55ish and start going for pre-raid BiS.
---
Never had an issue with any game ever with plusnet. Very strange and took forever to narrow down the issue. I'm 99% sure it will fix it for you too. I tried everything, this is the thing that did it. Let me know.

How to be tall gnome:

1. Get wizard hat

2.???

"Taking BIS from other classes"  
---
Oh grow up its a game. Just like warriors/rogues take ranged weapons for stat sticks. NEED roll exists for a reason and everyone abuses it not just hunters. Feel bad for any mage/warlock who loses a chest/helmet to a holy paladin as well or just like to bitch about hunters?
---
It's an RP Guild.
---
On an RP Server.
---
It was for fun. Lol
---
Loving druid and have no intentions of switching mains (for the time being), but I can tell I will get bored of (1) not seeing my gear due to shapeshifting (2) not having a lot of gear to get excited for (like the whirlwind axe for warriors).
---
I’m thinking my next character will be a warrior, rogue, or hunter. I know druid versatility is a unique part of the class, but which of these three classes has the most versatile/varied toolkit (disregarding dungeon/raid roles)?
---
warstomp? chain lightning takes longer to cast than the duration of the stun.
---
Who raped your ass?
---
Perhaps, but I also think you are misunderstanding what I'm saying. I'm not saying that I'm a victim of silencing or cancel culture itself, because obviously I'm not, I'm saying that because of silencing and cancel culture people tend to ignore people more frequently now than 15 years ago...

Here you go again, my dude. :)
---
I passed it to my wife, so now it's up to her
---
Sounds perfect. Couln't find it though. You know what it was named?
---
Just keep healing or at least +int gear to equip when you are going to dungeon and you should be fine in any spec
---
Why not just....tank?  That's half of your class?  It's literally the best class in the game to do so, so why not just put your tank hat on every now and then?   
---
Smh...

He says his wife doesn’t notice a difference which means he’s not telling her why he’s going to work early.
---
This is probably fake anyways.
---
I get paying for ports. They actually cost a reagent.
---
Pressing 1 button, then drag and dropping the water from your bag to me cost zero. In fact it might be a nice break from standing around doing nothing at all.
---
Haha we had a PUG rogue try to pickpocket the boss in Grim Guzzler, fail, wipe us, and then tell our group we needed to "focus up." It has become a meme in our guild now.
---
I believe they will wait a while for phase 2, but will bring in phase 3 fairly quickly.
---
That or release a BG soon after phase 2 launches.  
---
The amount of complaints they are going to get soon after phase 2 launch will drive it.
---
No need to "farm" skinning. Once you get to level 41, you will have your mount + 5g for the skill. The level 42-43 mobs you kill will be fine to advance skinning to 300 then. Just wait for now. After you get your mount, get skinning, then start farming beast monsters.
---
Your primary stats are agility, strength and stamina, you basically don’t get anything from hypnotic blade stat wise, except dps from dagger itself. Priest will benefit from every stat on it, it would be viable to roll for it, if there no casters in party, or healers have better/same version of this weapon. 
---
Since it’s a low level dungeon and easily farmed I think it’s not a big deal, but generally pressing need on int weapons as melee is frowned upon. Be careful with what you will roll in future, especially at high level dungeons, because there are a lot of 1 handers for casters and needing it you can get reputation of ninja looter.
---
Why not just....tank?  That's half of your class?  It's literally the best class in the game to do so, so why not just put your tank hat on every now and then?
---
Holy Pally here. Just got to lvl 40 and got holy shock. What talents should I grab in the ret tree to finish leveling?
---
There's absolutely nothing wrong with aoeing in a non spell cleave group. That's the reason you bring a mage, they do crazy good aoe damage. The issue is mages aoeing .25 seconds after pull.
---
My old lady hits the sack around 8:30 PM and doesn't give two shits what I do before going to bed around 11:30. As long as I play Alliance, like any decent human being does, she is happy. Can you imagine being married to a horde sympathizer? Now THAT is when you talk about divorce.
---
Use something like TSM to see what would be profitable to craft or keep a spreadsheet with the formulas for the recipes and the value of the end product and see if you can make money. If the mats are easy to farm then do that but if you can buy them cheap go that route.
---
Dude... just... dude I mean... she must be really good in bed
---
Even now there are advantages to do fury for onyxia as threat is a big issue there. In MC i wouldnt Bother until the gear is a lot better across the board
---
It actually bugged for my group and we didn’t have to fight any of the adds. They showed up and then despawned.

Can I have some mana buns plz?

It's longer than 30.

I'm on Ashbringer...perfectly balanced..

You're stupid if you think a grown man locked in his room playing video games while kids are downstairs wondering where daddy is is normal. But don't let me convince you to grow up. To each his own I guess

4% drop and a 10% drop.  This should happen once in every 250 kills.  There are 380k subs to this subreddit.  If each of them killed this guy once this would happen to 1000 of us.
---
At that point you may as well have the succubus out with lash of pain not set to auto cast. Her autos hurt, and you can manually cast a last if she's ever full so you don't waste mana.
---
Crap I just found a streamer on that server and was going to use it as background noise while I got actual work done.
---
Now I'm going to keep alt-tabbing to make sure he isn't using a zeppelin ...
---
Tbh this question seems important enough to be worth its own thread.
---
I haven't sold a single boe (I have a bunch waiting to sell) and have 365g at 55 by only using the AH to sell runecloth bags. No idea how you're only at 300 at 60. Do you buy every skill and constantly upgrade gear with full 16 slot bags?
---
That's pretty common, though. Druids have very little competition so they get geared quick.
---
If the Hunter knows how to play, he should be able to round up some harpies and dump them on the shaman with FD to make sure he can't do it.
---
I was this person, I was also 8 so that's my excuse
---
Yesterday I finally managed to get 90g and went to buy my riding skill and raptor et Sen'jin. 
---
As a priest I figured the fastest way by far was fly to Ratchet and levitate on the water until I reach Sen'jin. While on the way, I saw an AFK level 36 gnome hidden near the beach where those low level trolls and orcs farm crabs. I MC'd him and put him slightly below the water level and watched him drown. I feel like this dude had no business here, and since he's a gnome, he was probably just here to kill those innocent lowbies trying to level up. 
---
I felt like I did my duty as a member of the Horde, protecting our children. Also, one low level pries questing on this beach was AMAZED by the coolness of Shadow Form. I explained to him what it was since he seemed to be new to the game and I'm pretty sure I gave him a new goal! 
---
Also, raptor mount with shadow form is simply awesome. Really happy with my choice :D
---
Thank you OP
---
Type your title into google. You wouldn’t have to give description of your warrior and save some time.
---
They are both 2 seconds no?
---
While that is a very rude thing maybe the person had a horrible day and was not in the mood for interaction. It happens, nothing to sweat about in my opinion.
---
There was definitely a ban wave for that. Several posts of ppl getting banned popped up last week.
---
The problem is that he has to hide that behavior (in other words, lie) from his wife or she will probably be very mad. That's not healthy.
---
If you go onto wowhead and look at the classic warlock leveling guide they have the build there
---
Where is the other kid that fears the pack causing complete chaos
---
Just report his name as inappropriate... if you're gonna have a name like that, probably best not to be a douche.
---
&gt; most people hit 60 by now
---
Well that's flatly untrue. Plenty have sure, but most certainly not "most."
---
I read this and don't know what it was about?  Mage likes to AOE and a tank is bad?
---
As a mage, I really try not to do this. Try. Sometimes mildly successful.
---
Thats close to what happened to me, killed like 50 and dropped 1 essence then i killed like 10 more and got 3 more essences. Sold them instantly in AH for 16g each.
---
Oh thanks I didn’t think I’d be a person to ask the important questions
---
I tanked ST last night as a 50/51 warrior. I comment on similar threads, but I'm more of an old-school tank.
---
&gt; Charge in, Bloodrage, 2x Sunder Armor, lost aggro, can't get rage.
---
Try this: 
---
Charge in &gt; Berserker Stance &gt; Berserker Rage &gt; Defensive Stance &gt; Bloodrage
---
Berserker Rage has only a 30 second CD (good for every pull) and gives you more rage when taking hits. It requires stance dancing, but that's not a big deal (you're rage starved anyway).
---
Also, it's not a big deal at all to be taunting a lot. Often on pulls I'll mark a Skull, charge in at it, but then focus on sundering the other mobs. Taunt Skull when aggro gets pulled, and now your threat is raised to the same of the DPS that pulled. Except now you have rage from multiple things hitting you and a head start on the other mobs.
---
Also one thing that helps: Add a WeakAura for when you get incapacitated that says something in chat when it happens. This is especially useful in Zul'Farrak (mobs that hex / petrify), but I added one for Eranikus. If the party is aware you're asleep for X seconds, they can understand and react better than if they think you just temporarily lost threat.
---
&gt; "It's fine" I think to myself "run is working so far and noone is dying."
---
This is basically what you just have to accept. It's an MMO, so we have to accept some social challenges.
---
If you're the only one being ticked off about it, then your easiest solution is to choose not to let it bother you. This is what I've done. If you can't do that, then I guess don't tank. You're not going to have a fun experience trying to find DPS that will sit on their hands to make you more comfortable.
---
Tank will/should be rotating targets at the start of the pull to establish quick aggro on everything. There is no guarantee that what he is targeting at this exact moment is where most of the threats going to go. Skull your pulls.
---
I am mostly wanting some figures and experiences as to why it either is or isn't viable. 
---
For me to say something simply IS or ISNT viable isn't good enough. I know Asmon did it and I am well aware he takes highly geared people into raids. This is why I've made this post and not decided to go head first into it before asking "why" and "how".
---
It's like shaft or sack.
---
Back during Vanilla, I played a BG one time, just to see what it was like. I forever more had "Scout" appended to my name. It annoyed the Hell out of me.
---
You must be a bad mage to feel personally attacked.
---
yo
---
Heck, I'd take it even like that. If I told my wife I'd be gone for six months and come back with £3,000,000? She'd encourage me and even throw me into the house.
---
Being apart for six months to be set for life isn't that big a deal tbh.
---
It's a trap. This is a warrior's bag where all water is vendored.
---
water or no heal for u
---
Arms is better for tanking, not as good as prof obviously but you can tank arms usually.
---
Generally I don’t use immolate to save some mana
---
This isn't a good look for either of you, honestly.
---
Why should he have taken you and not the other druid? Were you born with a brain deficiency?
---
I believe most speed levelers do 2h fury until 40. Then you respec into arms and get mortal strike. Since you only have 5 levels to 40, I probably wouldn't drop the gold on 2 respecs
---
&gt; No flying mounts. Ever.
---
There's a number of areas that REQUIRE flying mounts (Tempest keep for example, 4 dungeons locked behind flying). Not to mention various high level areas for dailies, again require flying.
---
&gt; Removing high level players from Azeroth makes Azeroth feel more empty. Find a way to improve this problem.
---
High levels will always migrate to the new feeding grounds. Even happens in late stages of vanilla, when AQ opens most players are in AQ for the majority of their playtime, or in areas where there are high priority herbs just farming. The rest of the game feels empty as people are just passing through instead of playing through.
---
If TBC is launched, Azeroth WILL feel empty, minus hanging out in SW auctioning.
---
&gt; No welfare epics
---
From memory there wasn't really welfare epics. Even heroic epics were locked behind well, heroics which weren't a joke. Quite a few (such as Shattered Halls) required a strong group to make it through efficiently.
---
&gt; Do not raise the cap to 70 otherwise 60 endgame content becomes useless
---
The problem without raising level cap, is we are faced with the current issue. Spec diversity is terrible. Oh you play X class? Enjoy your 1 possibly a 2nd choice in role, but 99% chance you are the first. People get bored of not having a choice or identity in the game. 
---
And all other content becomes useless, once the next tier is released.
---
Why bother farming MC, when AQ20/40 is out? You get sub-par gear. Even when BWL is out, most guilds aren't going to go back to MC, except for alts or bindings/eyes.
---
That's not going to happen on Stalagg. It's going to be level 60 horde running around in packs sniping any alliance that will give you an HK.
---
The faction balance doesn't exist in a way to allow battles like that to happen.
---
Anything's possible, you just need a guild that isn't a bunch of tryhards.
---
A guild decked out in greens, half of them below 60, cleared MC within a week. It really doesn't matter in the long run.
---
It's quite something to behold! Beautiful zone
---
I think "function as an adult" is subjective in a situation like this.
---
Absolutely. I get up at 4am and play until 5.30, get ready for work and play some more in the evening. Best thing about early gaming are the empty areas with lots of uncontested herbs and being fully wake when you arrive at work.
---
Huge pet peeve when people spam 2-4 messages in a row of LFG.  See it all the time in Tanaris now.  Like, what are you hoping to accomplish that one message won't handle?  Shoot one message every few minutes (for people transitioning the zone to catch), and it yields the exact same result.  It's usually cleave groups too which causes my eye to twitch.
---
This is what I'd do.  It's a good compromise.
---
What role do you enjoy filling. That's the question, not what others prefer but what you have fun doing.
---
I was questing in the same area as a Lock who kept banishing my mobs because I was taking them from him apparently. Nice guy.
---
I played orc arms warrior in 2007-2012 exclusively, now after all these years I came back and made another orc warrior, despite always wanted to try a caster class like dot warlock and elemental shaman. My main reasoning was that warriors are one of the best overall classes for pvp in classic, and actually were viable pve damage dealers, or so I heard. Because when ever since wotlk warriors felt weak compared to retropallys and deathknights in pvp and were only considered tanks in raids for some reason. Looking at my low polygon orc warrior right now and asking myself, am I making a mistake?
---
rank 1
---
Well then, you got your answer after all.
---
That's going to be pretty damn expensive haha
---
I guess black mouth oil.
---
He tried, got resisted
---
I'm personally attacked now? You guys really are reaching.
---
I went 5/5 Benediction, 5/5 Parry and Seal of Command first. Parry is great because every time you parry it resets your swing timer meaning you attack again immediately. Seal of Command is your biggest damage ability as a Paladin. It must've been a pain to level without it so far unless you were dungeon grinding the entire time.
---
you're still 6 levels ahead of me! and i joined launch night to a server with no queue!
---
I can't actually answer your question, but "sentinel" armor is what the guards in Org wear.  And walking around randomly /saluting people is also a great way to smile while killing some time.
---
Read the stickies, fam
---
Lol. You seriously fucking think that don't you.  Fucking delusional.  You'd no  rather have a partner at home "available" than forced to GO SIT AT WORK OFF THE CLOCK just because you don't approve of their hobby? You're just as fuckin bad if not just delusional.
---
Mages and Warlocks:
---
* Main differences between them?
---
* Strenghts and Weaknesses?
---
* Leveling and Endgame?
---
Well, I am glad that I level by questing and not AoE grind. It seems not only boring, but troublesome aswell now.
---
Neither. The Hillsbrad quests in Southshore are too high for you and there aren’t really any quests for you in Thousand Needles. At 28 you should be finishing off zones like Duskwood, Wetlands and Ashenvale.
---
I just use Luna (apparantly healcomm included) and decursive
---
50 - 52: a mixture between Tanaris, Felwood and Aszhara.  
---
52 - 53 1/2: Un'Goro Crater
---
53 1/2 - 56 (current level): Grinding mobs in Aszhara (feldudes and belfs) for xp and gold 
---
My plan from 56 - 57 is to grind more and do dungeons. 
---
57 - 60 is gonna be a mixture between WPL - EPL - Winterspring - Grinding and Dungeon. 
---
But I dont mind grinding tho, just putting on a show or podcast for an evening while I mindless slay mobs.
---
Forty Firth
---
LMAO YOU HAD A CAMERA GUY FROM ANOTHER ANGLE TOO?
---
Wowww you really went all out for your BIG moment!
---
Yeah. But sometimes I have to resize the game in windowed mode, which really screws the ElvUI. I've switched to bartender, works fine when I resize the window to 1500px heigh or 500px heigh.
---
Yeah if your destination is further than 24 seconds in travel form, it’s better to mount up.
---
Yes, you have to be exalted and train Raptor Riding.
---
That's so great! lol
---
This is a great idea. I wish I had an interesting story to tell ;P
---
Well, some oldschool runescape 99’s can take 12-24 hours while others, such as runecrafting can take 3-6 months or sometimes a year depending on if you get tunnel vision easily. Lol
---
By saying they are similar, I mainly was talking about the nostalgic reference of guildies or clanmates being there at the time of leveling. Its a beautiful thing.
---
Hahaha, sweet. Must have been pretty annoying to deal with.
---
Its either that, or not being able to quest at all we have to choose from.
---
Even with layering some zones are too contested.
---
Mongolian throat singing.
---
I think druids bigger advantage is 20/30% move speed way before level 40. As of right now I think Warlocks have an easier time grouping according to LFG and trade spamming for locks and mages
---
It means that 2 evenly skilled players are doing the same job, the one with engineering will do it much better than the other.
---
Even better for endgame - [https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=5282/the-restless-souls](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=5282/the-restless-souls)
---
Accept the quest and get yourself a Ghostbusters gun. Never complete or abandon the quest. Now you have a ranged pull that's not a consumable and isn't on a CD.
---
Prices go up because people are leveling up and have more gold
---
To some people, money is such a non-issue that things like this don't matter in any possible way. Buying an alienware 34 inch monitor for these people is the equivalent of spending 20s to get a stack of mage water.
---
I’m level 22 now and working on my succubus quest now. Used the VW from 10-20 but he’s been retired. I kill so much faster with the imp and always end up with aggro off the VW anyway. Sac saved my butt a few times but it’s not worth it to have it out when I can just Soul stone myself
---
Dude he even had a camera guy taking a screenshot from a second angle. For hitting level 60.  
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/l6gDXOr](https://imgur.com/a/l6gDXOr) 
---
This guy is an overlord of cringe and self-importance.
---
yea he ran in, demo shouted but they weren't having it
---
That's actually a very good rogue weapon, so don't dwell on it too much.  Just be careful when the 2.7 speed healing mace drops in cath.  People will be slightly more upset about that one.  Apart from those two, there really aren't many places where healing weapons are ideal for a rogue of that level.
---
Lmao must have been on the receiving end too many times. 
---
Throw this guy some blood pressure medication  cause damn.
---
Don't hesitate to ask your party if you can roll on healer gear if you see all greed/pass on it. Even if it's mail, leather or even cloth.
---
Didn't that ideology of Ghostcrawler's start with WotLK though? Iirc in TBC they just spent their time bringing classes up so that they were actually playable (boomkins, rets, enhancement) and weren't excluded from groups for their specs.
---
Race changes weren't in Vanilla so will likely never be in Classic. You can get a wolf mount if you reach exalted rep with Orgrimmar.
---
Skarm was also wearing naxx gear and probably has more hours on a warrior than he can count. I really wouldn't recommend trying something out just because your favorite streamer/a private server warrior main did it and said its good.
---
No one buys anything.  This has got to be the most frugal the wow economy has ever been.
---
My same question
---
It is Naga Edge now, thanks.
---
This is way better than the 20 quiver threads I see every day Haha
---
Thanks for the quick reply.
---
Damn son. That's hefty
---
Pretty clear you didn't read the post since there are multiple things mentioned and they've happened to all of us (unless you're only level 1).
---
It’s an RPPVP server please make an RP compliant name and don’t grief RPers on your own faction if you come over.
---
My job is to AOE and do as much DPS as possible to ensure the swift demise of my enemies. Tanks job is to hold aggro.
---
Whoa, thanks for this
---
There is no raptor riding, only exalted and pay 800g for the mount.
---
&gt; I believe they will wait a while for phase 2, but will bring in phase 3 fairly quickly.
---
Depends on what you consider quickly. I dont see any phase being shorter than 3 months.   
---
&gt; That or release a BG soon after phase 2 launches.   
---
No way. They wont alter the release schedule at this point only because people complain about getting killed. Also many want consider BGs the death of open world pvp and dont want this phase to end
---
I shelved my tank I was leveling to go back to my priest. I have zero problems with letting people kiss the ground if they can't learn how to actually manage threat.
---
I actually took that on my very first character. 
---
I really thought survival was primarily melee...
---
Savage strikes too...
---
Ugh.
---
It took me embarrassingly long to figure out survival hunter was truly meant to be played.
---
For me it dropped on the second run. I didn't get it though another Warrior did
---
Do tanks not carry ammo / throwing weapons for pulling ?
---
That's even more cringy. Imagine asking someone else to stand at a different angle and take another shot, like it's even more important you get the perfect angle for your big day. In a video game.
---
Likely the same amount of time for a melee stat to hit 99.
---
All healing classes can heal pre-60 content just fine simply by keeping a +int/+healing set in their bank for dungeons.
---
&gt; s there any way to do a race change in ATM?
---
And nothing stops you from traveling to tame whatever pet you want.
---
He askd if you were implying, not saying
---
Bruh you goy me weak rn &gt;.&lt;
---
Still have around 30-40gold on my banks, and alot of items/reagents/gear etc. Im around 500+ now so. Before i started play again, i started, since announcement, to read and watch stuff how to make gold while leveling etc. its not that hard, its just very slow.
---
bloodsail buccaneers has all the cool shit
---
the other day there was an entire caravan group that came to xroads and sold anything a lowbie could ever need
---
it was awesome
---
This is one of the best expansions for warriors. Amazing at tanking, dps, and pvp.
---
If you want to play a caster rather than a healer make sure your character does not have a heal button.
---
"haha I said it was fake and it wasn't better find something else to try and make fun of"
---
thanks man, hope you have a great day!
---
For me leveling has been slow. I don't like questing on my warrior even though I know it is possible. Basically I only do dungeons with pick up groups and only venture out to quest if I am in between dungeon levels.
---
I am confident that with the amount of hours I have played that if I was playing a warlock/hunter/mage/druid that I would be well ahead of level 32.
---
That said, you can level a warrior much faster then I have, you just need to be efficient and spend more time questing then I have.
---
Faction based queues could provide blizzard a unique opportunity to balance servers when phase 2 hits and layering is removed
---
Use scroll button.
---
Briarwood Need
---
Prot is best for while actually tanking. But you should probably go arms or fury for solo content. 
---
You're not going to be able to hold air aggro over mages that are 4 levels higher than you.
---
That was very bad and you should feel bad for doing it.
---
I'm quite happy that my server seems to be relatively peaceful. I see a lot of allies standing around in SM just minding their business.
---
Faded Photograph
---
Snoo Snoo
---
Definitely. Try to level up alch with creating things you'd use
---
Would not recommend leveling dungeons as prot but that's me. It can be done. Also you can not really keep all that threat off them you basically pull what you can off and tank bosses. I leveled as fury till 40 and then arms now. Have had zero issues tanking.
---
I'm sure he fucking did you buffoon.  What makes fishing hiking or skiing any better? You trying to dictate the manner someone spends what time they have after they've done their day makes you a fucking idiot, case closed.
---
Rolling a low level character just makes you an easier kill, honour rewards or not. It's going to be war out there.
---
Yes :D
---
„yOu wAS GEtTiNg hEAls“
---
This whole setup is "cool guy." He asked people to pose in a staged shot he orchestrated to show off hitting level 60.
---
He even told someone to take a shot from another angle:
---
I don't see how anyone isn't cringing at this self-important self-masturbation.
---
Because they’re huntards for a reason.
---
The whole "hurr durr classic has a better community" thing bugs me. People aren't nice because of classic and people aren't idiots because of retail you get both on either version of the game but people like to put labels on things.
---
Its way more balanced than wow pvp has been in the history before BFA. You've zero knowledge if you think otherwise, and probably haven't been past the 1500 bracket.
---
I don't ever join groups with reserved loot even if it's an item I don't care about. It's a massive red flag for the quality of the group and I don't want to encourage the behaviour.
---
Because someone who returns after 9 months sitting on DKP they earned from clearing MC taking loot off of core raiders in AQ40 causes tension.
---
A system i liked was EDKP where the E meant effective and your total was multiplied by your attendance % over 3 months.
---
I did 1000 Needles until about 29. Then headed over to hilsbrad. I was over level for most of the hilsbrad quest which made it easy. There were a lot of people grouping for the elite quests and I got some good BoE gear. You’re also close to SM for some early runs. 29 to 32 went really quick.
---
&gt; we won't miss you.
---
LOL. Enjoy your new 90% horde PvE server.
---
What addon do you use to blacklist people?
---
Poor guy, doesn't even have any friends or folks in a guild who care enough about him to celebrate something, or even take screenshots and share them as a group. 
---
It's all good, Rayken. People care about you.
---
It's just tryhard and selfish, this game is about working together and when luck comes your way, it comes your way. Instead of trying to dictate and pull all the strings to get what you want as fast as possible. That's just my opinion, and I know a lot of people disagree. But reserving stinks to me.
---
I swap from shield to 2hd if the dungeon is too easy (overleveled), or if there are extremely aggressive aoe mages.
---
It does no good having a shield when the mage eats all the agro and fails to cc.
---
Are you implying that blizzard intends for there to be a large imbalance or are you just deliberately missing his point to troll?
---
just don't 
---
get your mount at 43 or 46, no one will care and you will save time, your actual most valuable resource
---
You run over and over until the healer/caster do not need, then it's your turn. This is how I did it.
---
Just be a mad lad and run a demo/destro imp build.
---
Less effective than affliction, but alot more fun than DOT &gt; DOT &gt; DOT &gt; Wand
---
Cant get them all unfortunately :)
---
He's right?
---
If there are 100 people on the server, 40 are alliance and 60 horde.  What is 50% of 40?  Add that number to 40.
---
I’m a mage so I’ll pretty much drink anything if I’m OOM. Even my own urine sometimes.
---
I've never seen it---but my whirlwind axe quest saved me from having to deal with it.
---
You don't even have the most BASIC of reading comprehension, dude. 
---
Faked as in, it's set up. Not naturally leveling to 60. Planned.

Hope you have a (large) group and aren't planning on doing that solo, otherwise you're going to gank the wrong nerd who calls over his entire neckbeard guild to camp you until you log off out of frustration.

400 person guild, lvl 50 Hunter, med-high population server. Never had the kind of issues that are mentioned above. Not saying they didn't happen. Just saying that some pretty poor luck.

---
Seems pretty boring if you don't at least ask the question. Gather the information and make your own judgement on it is what I would say. 
---
Hence me trying to gather some additional information from people on this post before I make a decision 😁
---
This may be an idea. Incentivice faction transfer for horde players. I dunno, give horde who are on Skeram and change their faction to alliance a free 60 mount or something. Until the charts are more balanced.
---
I want you to spell it out so the world can point and laugh. You think neglecting your children to play video games is valid?
---
You sure you didn't mean to reply one message layer above?
---
I don't believe the Library of Classic wow reddit is a good place to gather accurate information. Everything you've seen in pserver players videos is infinitely more knowledge than anyone here has.
---
On Stalagg there’s some horde shaman multliboxing and causing hell in tanaris. 
---
Love seeing him run around with the goon squad
---
yea the LA and BR servers open last week and people are moving over there, im a lvl 60 horde mage and i keep seeing more nad more ally it looks like things are comming together on balance
---
Put the sword with the highest top end damage in mainhand and keep a faster sword in offhand. That’d be ideal. 
---
Emphasis on swords.
---
Just a small pointer, as i made the same mistake the first time around.
---
It's "/cast Pick Pocket" with a space in between
---
Unless his job is playing WoW, he's not going to work early. He's leaving home early to go play WoW.
---
Oh cool. I thought it was 20 seconds.  4 extra seconds is actually really nice
---
Lol bet
---
How would you know what you miss on other layers? 
---
One layer might have a orgy outside bank, and you could be standing in the middle of it, clueless.
---
I'm really confused why you're so hung up on it being staged. No shit, dude! Of course it's staged! Why the fuck would A) his guild be there, B) all be kneeling, if they didn't know he was about to hit 60? The entire premise of your raging makes no sense at all. If you think it's lame, that's fair, but just say that instead of implying that OP is somehow being deceitful.
---
You should've hit me with "Who hurt you?" 
---
That's a classic one.
---
Maybe we are a bit isolated from the imbalance because we are casually playing and only low 30s, but a group of 4 close friends and i went around destroying horde and questing in STV the other night, even those that were skull level to us, and it was a blast. We are all gnome / dwarf which made it hilarious to watch. It took a group of 10 level 40+ horde to finally bring us down. So of you play with a group and not solo the ganking isn’t really a factor and if anything makes the poor ratio more fun due to endless opponents.
---
Lately no. I downloaded the big ones like questie a while ago. That's a great point though, didn't think of that.
---
Brilliant, hadn't thought of that!
---
Well, the lack of undead hunters in Classic would.
---
Yea, if you were in a crowded room with these commenters you wouldn’t be listening to them anyways.
---
If I’m focusing on a Druid with a combo of resto and feral, what specs should I be focusing on? I was thinking stamina, intellect, spirit?
---
Considering there is no set release schedule of the phases and they specifically said they want to remain flexible, you are just plain wrong.
---
Gotta love these Roundabout / To Be Continued memes
---
The most efficient way is to continue playing tank and pick up gear as you go.
---
Be warned thou: especially more casual players will not like it that you roll need on healing items. If you don't want drama, discuss that with the healer in your group before. Then you will still have drama, because casuals are filthy sh!ts and sore losers and then you end up doing what we all do:
---
Roll need all the time when you need an item. You are as much a part of this party as all the others. Nobody "deserves" the loot more than others. If you need an item and plan on wearing it, then roll need. If you don't need it, roll greed or pass. It's that simple.
---
I agree but hey i can just switch layers to escape right
---
From a couple of weeks back when I was questing in Stonetalon, I was delighted to find that one of the first platforming behind the world spots I found over a decade ago still exists. Cata removed all of this and by extension, the excitement of exploring. Looking forward to seeing if Hyjal is just the way I left it. [Album link](https://imgur.com/a/HTC8xgq)
---
For leveling i went feral until feline swiftness/feral charge, furor, feral again till maxed, and didnt pick up NG until I was taking points in the balance tree. 
---
Furor is good for low level tanking because you can bearshift to get some quick rage, and you can start dps powershifting pretty early on in dungeons (albeit less often and to less effect). 
---
NG is a great getaway tool, and being that it's at the top of the tree you can dip for it whenever you please. I waited because I find that druids have an easy enough time escaping as it is, but its up to you.
---
Feral charge is an extremely useful tool for pvp, I would get it asap.
---
&gt; I do this by using the average heal amount as name for the above mentioned macro.
---
That’s really clever. I’ve been using the same macro for all standard heals with alt and ctrl controlling downranking.
---
I’m rerolling warrior. For some reason I really want to play undead just for the style and animations. I’m worried I’m going to regret not picking Orc. I plan on mainly playing fury in raids and arms in pvp with occasional tanking 5 mans/off tanking in raids. I understand how huge weapon skill is in classic, but how often would you really use axes as fury/arms. There’s also the stun resist for PvP. How much would this really matter? Clearly I’m a pretty casual player but I do plan on raiding, like I did in vanilla. It will just take me 6 months to get there.
---
I have Youtube or movies/films playing on one monitor most of the time.
---
BC release week sucked ass. It was basically a queue simulator.
---
Yes and no, I never got mega far into Mage and only really just started Priest. Sure Mages have some great pros but Priests are a pretty good solo class too.
---
Gear alts.
---
I'm leveling up my hunter now and I never understoood why they were listed as BiS over peacemaker. No way I'm farming those things. I'd rather use a 2h anyway.
---
warlock is fun, dot dot fear dot dot fear, dot dot, oh shit mob 1 is coming back, fear again wand dot dot, fear again, soul drain, and boom you have 3 corpses in front of you or in a random part of the zone due to fear.
---
Why bother with critical thinking if you don't know the people, amirite?!!! 
---
If all you care about is you that's your choice, go right ahead. I'd rather use my brain and think about the situation at hand because I'd hope other people would do the same and even if they don't at least I know I'm not ignorant in it. Multiple people have pointed out that the potential "upgrade" is miniscule for a hunter but enormous for someone else. You do you.
---
No, you're right, the BiS lists on Wowhead say it and they're 100% wrong. As you said, the reason they're listed as BiS is due to the +15 Agi to 1hers... an enchant that's not in the game until P3.
---
So yes, when P3 launches, they'll be pre-raid BiS. Until then, Peacemaker is the actual pre-raid BiS Weapon for Hunters.
---
so my +20 stam cloth lvl 28 hat was prob worth putting in the auction house.  Maybe it was +8 - idk.
---
Me too :)
---
You're actually rolling a little higher than you should in this subset! Nice one!
---
We're not that clever...
---
Due to friends wanting to start again on a new server, I’ve had to reroll.
---
I levelled serveral 60s in vanilla, one on a private server and now once again in new classic.
---
This time I honestly just want to use a guide, this is for alliance, either classicwow.live, zygors guide or jonana, which one is typically best for alliance? And is it a problem using this guide if I’m already level 17?
---
Can you tell me where you started getting out of bounds at? Love exploring these areas
---
I just cracked 30 and I’m thinking this for 30-40. Is it better to xp grind mobs, run dungeons, or just quest ?
---
The top comment foresaw this guy.
---
I’m literally out of keybinds with four actions bars completely taken up by abilities I need access to.
---
You are more of a burden to your party when behaving like this than you are while playing a non meta spec tbh.
---
I use mine practically on cooldown, and thanks to it I've saved sooooo much money on food and water.
---
It will be in account settings. Addons or whatever plusnet calls it. You basically click the blue writing to add static ip, confirm and that's it. Restart router and you're done.
---
And yet I've spent an hour or two fighting over limited spawns for certain quests numerous times in classic. (looking at you, shaman quest in feralas)
---
Thanks for the reply’s everyone!
---
I sure am. I fucking love 1.12.1 to death but it will unfortunately get stale eventually. And I know that TBC will fuck the game up completly so I am not really keen on that route.
---
And if Blizzard could get a decent team together to work on vanilla-like content similar to OSRS that would be my preferred route.
---
A lot of people say they have no trust in the WoW devs (which I understand) but I think one of the biggest issues is that retail is suppose to appeal to "everyone" which is why it has 20 difficulties on all content. If they just removed that constraint and just let vanilla be a slower and more hardcore of the game I am sure the devs could do some good work.
---
Typical lbrs pack is 4-7 mobs. Aoe will always out damage frostbolts spam in this scenario. There is 0 reason not to aoe, you just gotta give the tank a few seconds.
---
Woooot what is that Website / addon and where douth thy get one?
---
You sound like a Rogue at heart. And you won't have to worry about being the gankee, you'll be the ganker.
---
Healbot or VuhDo are my go to, i like the combination of on click, and modifiers that both allow for.
---
Luckily my lowly level 9 warlock has a chance then.
---
&gt; it's exactly 50-50 in both EU and NA
---
There are over 10,000 more Alliance players than Horde in NA as of the latest update and the deficit was even greater in the first release of the data. At no point has Horde outnumbered Alliance in Classic. Period. Experiences are purely anecdotal based on realm choice, but Alliance has the larger playerbase. These are just facts.
---
I have quick buttons on my mouse for stance dancing, I prefer the manual control right now but might start working in macros soon
---
Anyone know of a good Onebag addon that works well with the Scrap addon?
---
You can activate the raid style for the party UI. There you can set what HP you want to display. None, percentage, current and missing.
---
I personally like missing as it allows me to go for the most efficient heal without overhealing.
---
Don't worry about "rotation".  You'll find in classic that dispelling, debuffs, and interrupts are really important in groups.  Example, AOEing mob will wreck a group fast, so a rogue stun locking them til they die helps a lot, and he should be focused on keeping that target from casting.  Warlocks have their curses, which is the bread and butter.  Increase cast times, make auto attacks weaker (great for duel wielding mobs), assortment of pets for off tanking, CC, stam buff, felhunter for messing up caster mobs...  It's situational, always, especially when you run into mobs that are immune to fire, frost, shadow, etc.  The one size fits all mentality might work in some cases like grinding simple mobs for quests, but in groups, things change really quick.  Warlocks are an excellent addition to a group.
---
It's legendarily cringeworthy to stage a shot like that and then post it like it's something special, a big deal, or worth showing to anyone. That's all. The act of leveling up in a 15 year old game, in the most cliche of places, with guildies kneeling is like, so uncreative and boring it's hard to believe this is posted or upvoted.
---
&gt; Tirion fordring questline for prebis melee/tank/healer
---
&gt; 
---
Just did the escort part last night when i found out the ring is pre-raid BIS for priests.  Ended up being stupid easy.  I had the quest to get the painting done for a few days and just had been too lazy to walk back to him to turn it in.  Once i found out about the next quest i did that, walked down to the Hag, and then did the escort.  
---
It was super easy, just stand back and DONT CANCEL YOUR DISGUISE.  Let the Highlord kill everything.  He'll survive.
---
Once you get to the tower make sure to stand back so the priest doesnt agro to you.  The dude will die, just keep waiting.  Tirion will come in and annihilate them, you can turn in the quest, and congrats on a ring with something like +40 healing on it.
---
Oh yeah, if you have the darrowshire quest up there....dont try to loot the libram.  it'll knock you out of your disguise.  Thankfully at 60 i was able to run away (woo PW:S and Scream), but i had to go back later and get another disguise.
---
What does internet have to do with school?
---
In my book getting wasted on a fishing trip &gt; video games
---
Yup one of the best quest chains to do when you get into the 50's.  Gives XP/bag/gear.
---
Yes if you rerolled, but you can go to the undead starting zone and tame a wolf if you so desire.
---
I'm level 43 priest. Until now, I haven't grouped with a warlock that does decent overall damage. Most of the time it's right around the same as the tank. I don't really want to group with them until 60 because most of these warlocks are getting carried.
---
Not even close and that mentality is going to get you kicked from a lot of higher end content groups lol.
---
Yup its Elvuix it days so at the bottom of the chat box! :p
---
Low effort meme
---
The people playing 20 hours took 4-5 days at launch....
---
My job is DPS (damage per second). I was doing my job of doing as much damage as possible. The tanks job is to hold aggro and he couldn't do his job.
---
But to be fair dal’rand’s weapons have always been a set of joke weapons since the hearty days of vanilla. They are a cool set and all but before phase 3 your better of arms spec with a good two hander.
---
I played a druid all through vanilla, I'm just messing around
---
You are just saying that private servers are even more no changes than classic is
---
While right now its good for me. I realise overtime mages will be hated to the point noone will want them when i see arcane explosions and blizzards being cast on two mobs. Want can you do. I just wanted to play mage.
---
What was your process for getting there? I would love to go myself!
---
Those kids are already in a rough spot. No internet in the house in 2019? Sure they’ll be fine for a few years but once it starts coming to actual school time they’re going to fall behind because of their Amish harpy of a mother. 
---
Having to go to work four hours early every day to unwind and be able to enjoy a hobby isn’t healthy. You can be a great parent and have Internet and hobbies, women who seem to think otherwise and barr their boyfriends/husbands from playing are fucking batshit insane.
---
Used visme.co 
---
First time using it. So this was created using the free version. You can pay and get premium features also :)
---
This is a prime example of what not to do in the World of Warcraft. 
---
By this i mean respond like OP did back to this player.
---
What do I do as a hunter vs frost mages if I dont have scattershot? Im max level now and they are still pissing me off.
---
Melee opponents you can at least FD-&gt;freezetrap or use your melee slow ability (dont know its english name) but mages... as soon as they frostnova you and your pet you are guaranteed dead. Seriously, fuck every one of you mages
---
Pro tip: When looking for a tank for a dungeon you can avoid all the bad tanks by distracting them with a troll thread on reddit
---
In general I agree with r/FirstAccountCreated, but in this case I'd say go for it if you're rolling against a Warrior or another Paladin, since they also have the option to change rolls for an easy invite. In any case make it clear from the beginning that you're going to be rolling on.
---
It's because a lot of people thought (incorrectly) that the +15 Agi to 1hers Enchant would be in the game. With that enchant, Dal'rends is 100% better. The problem is... that enchant won't be in the game until P3.
---
All these BiS lists incorrectly slapped it on there and said Dal'Rends is better. So now every Hunter in the world points to it and says, "But it's my BiS!"
---
Everyone talking in absolutes such as "X IS better for Y" is a good who is blindly following one meta belief or another.
---
Play what you want.
---
Personally, I love my Tauren, that AoE stun is amazing and has saved my ass, as well as that of my entire dungeon party many times plus the extra 1ish yard of melee reach that they have can give you a slight advantage against CC, roots, and stuns. Plus, extra health.
---
/Moo
---
Oh, I think I know the place actually.
---
These discussions always end up like political debates. Whatever your view on the subject, no one is going to change your mind.
---
In PvP druids are not like other classes where you have a big fight and then a couple seconds later one of you is dead at the others feet.
---
Instead Druids are like Herpes. The show up out of nowhere and mess up your day.  Then go away, just when you think it's over they show up again, and wear you down some more, this repeats until you die.
---
If you haven't heard the remix on General Sam's youtube channel you're missing out.
---
I fancied the idea of aoe farm when was thinking about what is going to be my main, but I am on RU PvP server so AoE grind was not really way to go(and I was quite right about that). I took single target shatter build and it saved my ass so many times in world PvP, that I never regret that I can't actually AoE grind.  
---
I was sure that I made right choice when I heard about Horde ganking AoE grind spots on purpose.
---
Can someone explain me the difference between "+x healing spells" and "+x healing power"?
---
Yeah, it'd probably be more correct this way, as TBC didn't have the "every healer can dispel magic and res" and "every tank has at least 2 defensive CDs".
---
And it really took off in Cata when mages got heroism, druids got an interrupt, BM hunters got all of the buffs possible etc.
---
Mostly true. As much as I love doting entire fields of baddies, there's no way we can compete with mage pulls. uNlEsS yOu UsE tHe SuCcUbUs!!!11
---
Shaman... that is all
---
So what you're actually saying is "there's something really wrong with your DPS if any fight lasts more than 3 minutes if you're not in one of the highest ranking guilds who only focus on speed clearing".
---
Hahaha 10 gold. Might be worth 1k:)
---
A good way to flex in vanilla wow was to deck out your bank alt with the fanciest gear possible.
---
You knew someone was rich when you saw their bank had a fiery weapon enchant and DM enchants on their helm and legs.
---
The locks that do this have terrible damage output. It's a waste of time.
---
Ok.nope
---
It's astonishing behavior, it tickles my brain trying to comprehend the necessary mental components required to form this line of thinking. Or in better terms "i aint even mad bruv", I feel like it should upset me, but it's just so damned mystifying. 
---
I'm still writing here, hoping I'll stumble upon a description apt enough to explain the absolutely bewildered mental state I have been locked into from reading that chat. But mainly I'm just killing time between schooly stuff. Sorry to anyone who wasted 20 seconds of their life reading my post.
---
I guess "nani the fuck" is a good contender.
---
you tried
---
The tos didn't change since vanilla, so you're free to do it. There is absolutly no restrictions, same rules apply if you play one char or ten. Just one little change in classic from vanilla that impact boxers : no /follow on battleground.
---
Sounds like a bad mage that doesnt understand how warrior tanks work in classic. This isn't retail, a warrior tank will struggle to hold aggro on multiple mobs.
---
Depends on who you ask.
---
Deep ret appears to be the general consensus, but I'm currently prot+aoe and plodding along just fine at level 37.
---
It’s not bad if they know how to heal, makes it move quicker
---
That’s smart
---
Prat
---
1) Engage.
---
2) No one is allowed to DPS until consecrate stops.
---
 things with Agi or attack power is hybrid gear, i dont consider it caster gear.  My helm has 12 agi 18 intel and 18 spirit, yet said i shouldnt have rolled and let the druid or shaman take it....
---
Thanks for giving me something to do for 20 secs, slow day at work. Man the classic community is the best!
---
Hahah. Everytime im in a dungeon group i tell healer not to heal me unless my hp is below 50%.
---
Where are they going to go? Then the new server will be 100% horde.
---
fee fee
---
If you think Google is a hidden gem, I have bad news for ya.
---
there is heavy horde bias in classic, get used to it
---
At 44, ZF is really good experience.  I'd start by finding all the quests and doing all the pre-reqs, then spam ZF for a couple levels.  If you clear the zombies near the witch doctor, it's really good XP and very easy pulls (2-6 melee mobs, who dont hit particularly hard).
---
Once you hit 48-49, you can do the same with Maraudon.  Another instance with a lot of quests, though spam running it isnt as advantageous exp wise.  It's okay but not great like ZF who has a lot of mobs close together for cleave pulls.
---
Why are you trying to project your issues on me? I'm not the one claiming to wipe the floor with Alliance on my server. I'm not the one coming up with excuses. I merely pointed out that both the initial post and the comments that you've left afterwards were absolutely childish, and can only be explained by prolonged exposure to not-so-successful PvP. How exactly is that supposed to make me the one being bullied? Show me your impressive mental gymnastics, please.
---
Are you sure? No one else seems to have that functionality. https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d8rbrn/this_guy_loves_pvp/f1c766s/
---
Pretty easy concept to open X many servers one faction only to one specific server. After the population is balanced then close the transfers. Repeat.
---
It was such a stupid thing to do and Wowhead is to blame entirely. Many people so "45/55" and "40/60" and decided it was imbalanced and bailed at the first chance.
---
Wowhead literally created a self-fulfilling prophecy. I'm 100 sure it's why Blizzard broke the API for the CensusAddon. It was killing servers.
---
He just hit 60 as in, it happened last night, not that it just happened serendipitously.
---
Unreal how so many people are getting hung up on a word when they don't understand the definitions of it.
---
It's kinda amazing to me how easy it is to troll when you say you're a mage and poke at very obvious things.
---
It is BIS for alliance.  Mainly because there are no other trinkets and 20 ap is 20 ap.
---
Horde its not BIS. The horde hinterland elites are better.
---
*Hurley intensifies*
---
Once in a while the tables turn, especially if you have a group that you roll with. As others have said when the numbers are balanced the horde tend to be pretty polite. Also the closer you get to endgame the more polite the horde get because you become a more and more credible threat.
---
Where it goes to hell is when there is a swarm of horde in the area. Sometimes they let you be, but usually one of dives in on you, and when their allies see PeeVeePee happening they go in the "help their friend". This phenomenon happens on alliance as well, but for every 1 situation where there is an alliance swarm, you'll probably run into 5-6 horde swarms.
---
So really what you are doing now leveling as a group is the right way to go. Typically horde don't engage groups  while leveling because they just want to continue farming instead of shutting down a zone to PvP against a threat that can actually fight back.
---
"I hit 60" is a lot different than "I chose a deliberate moment to level up."
---
There was a screenshot a week or two ago where someone hit 60 while dead from a quest in Molten Core. That is worth posting and that's truly a "hit" 60 moment. This is a "I waited to hit 60" moment.
---
But yeah, irony!
---
Just bad name since the main names used don't really interact.
---
Good to hear) barrens, here i come again
---
no, he means 400
---
But the run took 5 min longer! /s
---
Not gonna lie you had me going for a minute, I was getting a little pissed.
---
Never drink and make submission titles, kids.
---
I'm telling you, this is required to find the Ashenbringer.
---
Here's the thing tho, Blackcrow isn't your BiS. [Carapace Spine Crossbow
---
](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18738/carapace-spine-crossbow) is better on top of being easier to get. The only thing Blackcrow is better for is spell capping your tranq shots, but since that isn't even close to as important as it was on some over-tuned private servers it's hardly worth going for the extra hit since you're already above hitcap in your pre-bis sans Blackcrow.
---
Is it really that bad? I play as horde on TF and I get ganked left and right at tarren mill at lvl 30
---
If your guild farms SM, do that since Blizzard increased the party XP so it yields more XP/hr than leveling. If you’re typically solo, look up job grinding guides to stock up on cash for your mount while you make the final stretch to it. Good luck.
---
ZF. Make sure to grab all the quests. I'm in a similar situation. 
---
Also, have you done anything in the Hinterlands? I don't know about Alliance, but the Horde hub there has a lot of really good quests for 46ish characters. I picked up a bunch of quests from it last night and spent 4-5 hours just finishing the quests. Pretty much every mob you come across is a quest mob. It was really good exp.
---
Jesus Christ, no.
---
Do you even know what you are talking about? I guess not, because obviously you have no flipping clue how uneconomic this would have been.
---
Layering will be gone come phase 2. I rather have to invite my friend to a group than fight for a questmob with even more people than I have to right now.
---
Prot+aoe was what I was asking for, you need BoSanctuary for it to be viable right?
---
Only BIS for alliance. Horde has a better one
---
They might not be, we are just talking item enchants.
---
&gt;Parents can spend their free time doing whatever they want as long as their child is taken care of.
---
Very well put. I'm just pointing out that raising three kids might lend very little to no free time and expecting your partner to fill in for both of you so you can play video games is shitty
---
I've only recently been experiencing this kind of gameplay from dps to be honest. Back in SM I was having an easy time keeping aggro on basically anything (except vs mage blizzard). I hope this gets better at max level when I will also spec into protection.
---
Thorw X cross in there too. 
---
Skull is kill.
---
Cross is next.
---
Moon is last / cc'd.
---
no one NEEDS to do anything, just like you don't NEED to comment
---
ironic isn't it
---
I've done it once or twice. It eases you into the day quite well. Then the day goes quicker/better.
---
You think a billion dollar company "doesn't get used"? It is probably just in your network or agegroup :)
---
It’s closer to 3:2 which means 50% mor horde than alliance.
---
You should post this to /r/dataisbeautiful as they'd appreciate this.
---
BGs are cross realm.
---
WPvP &gt; BGs
---
It's a RP server dude, why are you hating on how people have fun?
---
Top 4 yes if in PvP 
---
Last point: depends on your guild. You can search a casual guild that don’t care. Early raids are super easy anyway
---
/thread
---
I was in same boat as you, I tried boars, bears, and leopards and I think bear has served me best so far (lvl 20)
---
Hitting a level, any level, is usually used to denote spontaneously hitting a level.
---
Do it, you'll have a blast
---
I haven't tried it myself but there's been a few videos on grinding ZF zombies for 40-50G per hour from people. Haven't tried it myself but it looks promising.
---

---
even easier than getting another is simply to ask the party leader to make it a raid for a second, and then use it while in raid. It won't complete the quest :)
---
I am leveling a druid and find myself tanking a lot, and trying to learn what I can. How can you enter stealth and wait to rez the healer if you are still in combat?
---
JEALOUS MUCH?
---
The only reason you don't see these names in other games is because they were taken at the beginning.
---
"myd1x1erect" just isn't as good.
---
Can also be worked around (model replacement was absolutely an exploit in vanilla)
---
Bear/boar for solo pve 
---
Pvp and dungeons i would go kitty cat.
---
I cleared STV (hunter) for about 4-5 levels up to 45, then went to Swamp of Sorrows for another couple of levels. Hit Hinterlands at 47, done the elite quests there in Jinth’alor, got the mallet item for Zul’Farrak questline. Did ZF a couple of times but didn’t really enjoy the instance so I actually went to Badlands at 48 and farmed the nethergarde mobs in the mine just at the entrance from Swamp of Sorrows.... hunted those bad boys for two straight levels. The cave was basically empty of other players, mobs drop loads of mageweave and tons of silver, easy to kill too. Hit 51 last night and found my way to Ungoro crater which seems like a really awesome little zone. Lots of quests which can all me farmed simultaneously just from running around the zone, that’s where I’m up to now. I’ll probably finish UG then head to the Plaguelands and quest/farm up until 56/57, maybe hit ST for a few runs, then try gearing in BRD.  It’s my first time playing WoW so the “grind” doesn’t seem too bad to me, especially as I’m an old school Tibia player. Only those who played Tibia know what grind truly means.
---
Yo I just realized if the meme template itself is WoW related the mods can’t delete it for “low effort”. We just need to make a list of WoW templates
---
To add on to this the threat generated is affected by defensive stance modifiers. So if you’re prot spec with the threat talent it’s literally 48~% more threat
---
Prices were (still are) seriously supressed at launch because nobody has money.  Now, a month later with players at 60 and farming endgame content, there is more gold available.  It's not due to gold sellers, it's because there is more gold being generated from the game by players.  I farmed 50g from doing shellfish turnins in desolace.  That's 50g that previously did not exist in the economy that I created.  As time goes on, the prices of decent blue items will go up on AH.  I saw someone selling the green tower (epic level 36 sheild) for 20g.  I almost bought it just because I know it'll double in price in a month.  This is not because of gold buying, but because players are creating gold by farming.  
---
Also - a hearty "hell no" to the introduction of gold tokens in classic.  It's hilarious that you're complaining about prices, and then suggesting something that would absolutely nuke the economy in the same post.
---
I miss the BGs!
---
Technically bannable but they don't really care. I've visited almost all of the 'hidden' places such as old ironforge, gm box, gm island etc on retail and the only ban I've ever gotten was for swearing in a global chat
---
As a hunter I get OPs situation because it happens to me a lot too, I’m a 14 year vet in wow not a noob huntard....but I also get that most of these same people haven’t played vanilla or even anything before cata or mists...but realistically there’s not a Shit tonof hunter gear in dungeons...
---
Noggenfogger EU is rapidly approaching 70/30 horde/alliance split.
---
Rerolling as we speak.
---
That's for pve though. Pvp paladins are good, yeah, but it doesnt outweigh axe spec, stun resistance, undead racial, etc. What does the alliance have? Fear ward? Perception? No flight paths anywhere?
---
Paladins can tank leveling dungeons just fine and they are the best tanks for AoE farming undead endgame 5 mans.
---
That's it.
---
If you have hopes and aspirations of raid tanking, you need to be a warrior or *maybe* a bear druid because if a guild brings anything non-warrior, it's going to be that.
---
If you just want to be able to tank while leveling, run great endgame farms as a tank, and heal/buff in raids - Paladin is the class for you.
---
it's like playing a shooting game and not shooting the enemy...
---
it's a game...
---
if you don't like it switch servers, pretty simple solution.
---
No idea, time to start looking!
---
If you're horde, supplement with the shellfish repeatable quest in Desolace starting in your mid 30's.
---
bad jokes aside, my FD/trap macro hasn't failed me yet. with a /petpassive and a little patience before leaving combat, i've been able to get the trap off 100% of the time. 
---
There is another bug people are talking about with FD that it delays your next autoshot though which I have noticed :(
---
I'd drop tailoring after you get the robe tbh, I feel like you can passively make money with skinning overtime for little to no effort. Hell idk what you need leather for in the later phases but worst worst case the market dies and you vendor the skins
---
Wait you can skin Ony ?! Ouch it must really suck having 40 stinking adventurers raid your lair only to have them kill you, chop your head off AND skin you in the process..
---
Fun fact, in Sholazar there's an island in the middle of a lake with a hatch in the ground with that reads 5, 9, 16, 17, 24, 43
---
Yes, this is exactly the kind of reputation you want to avoid as a tank but you will definitely get if you start to tell these kind of dps that they have to play their part in threat management.
---
Nah, just an edgemasters and a freezing band, just the usual.
---
I have ran into this issue too, while I was leveling my hunter. People were looking for DPS for ZF or Maraudon and kept posting "LF DPS". Later on they changed it to: "LF DPS - NO HUNTER". Happened on Kromcrush Alliance.
---
BIG BRAIN TIME
---
I named my hunter Needmoreammo
---
Felt appropriate
---
My age group is early 20s so you’re not wrong, I don’t remember the last time I’ve heard someone outside my parents talk about Facebook lol.
---
Kang? Oo it was really one the few  epic BOE which you could get only when the planet align, long ago, seen it once and kept it on my warrior, never again for 13 yrs\^\^
---
Ha ha ha
---
Hey man, as a clothy, you're alright in my books :) and always remember, if you need it, need it.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't the fleeing mobs aggro new mobs anyway, with or without the boar?
---
If you’re not making money on skinning, I think the answer is a no brainer.
---
So use the rank just below and make a stack a cast.  Not like the mage cares if he gives the top shelf hydration to a random r?  It cost you seconds to summ some water while you are waiting minutes for people to arrive.  You can choose to help your faction and the community or choose not too.  Both leave a mark
---
So, this is... BankerSarus?
---
I do this in retail. My bank alt is a level 5 human monk (rolling between bank and AH is great) named Willifer. He's got the tux, diamond tipped cane, 2 of those rings that shine on your hand, the monocle, and the top hat (which is ridiculously expensive but some idiot gave to me for 1,000g back in MoP. Doesn't mean much now with how ridiculously easy it is to get gold though.
---
How dare you not play horde?
---
Is it really slightly Alliance-favored? That’s awesome.
---
I thought about rerolling there but all my friends and guildies are on another server and we’re pretty content there. But if I were to reroll, Grobbulus is my first choice for sure.
---
Do Hunters have mana in Classic?
---
Please teach me your ways - how do I key bind such things?
---
Shamans can solo any slowable elite with earthbind totem + searing/fire shock kiting.
---
Best in Slut
---
well i said eorst thing abput city raiding not layering but i do agree, fuck layering
---
I was in the same boat. When I first started playing towards the very end of Vanilla and into BC, I played dwarves and night elves. All my friends went Alliance, so that’s just what I knew. I played on/off up until BFA always as alliance. 
---
When classic dropped, I decided to go undead. It’s been great so far and I’m happy with my choice. I had never really played horde besides a few random alts that never got past level 15-20. The transportation and access to dungeons is nice. I think horde has a slight pvp advantage with some racials as well which is nice.
---
Any Ret paladin worth his salt knows that weapon is crap.
---
Its nice to see the ret hate is still alive 15years later.  Yes, I'm rolling on your leather/plate/mail dps gear :D
---
I am horde on Gandling. Basing on toons I saw in mixed zones (Gadgeztan, stv etc) the server doesnt look horde dominated, at all. Depending on zones and day time, ally outnumbered us heavily. The last census I saw horde was roughly 60% but I tend to not trust numbers with no standard deviation attached. How is your impression while levelling?
---
Never seen a dual loot from deviate hides in WC.
---
Two things: staves tend to have pretty high dps for their level (see Crescent Staff) and spirit is pretty important for a leveling warrior that doesn't want to eat after literally every single kill. Main stat? Ehh, not really. Important? Absolutely. Spirit is very useful for almost all classes while leveling, warlocks and arguably hunters being an exception.
---
I do tell them and the usual consesus is: "Its a habit." And they continue healing me. Heck!! I had a druid who told me he hates warlocks. I replied: "Dude. Stop healing me. You are literally wasting my money, by wasting my bandages." and he put me on ignore.
---
LOK'TARSMR
---
What an old ass meme. I forgot all about that, 5 years ago.
---
I fished nodes on the coast of Tanaris to fund my mount, took me a day or so. The mithril boxes from wreckage nodes drop bolts of cloth, leather, and green items that sell decently enough in the AH. I also sold any stonescale eel I got in the AH and used the oily blackmouth to make free action  potions that also sold really well.
---
The only thing that could make it better is if you could sync the music up to where he gets hit at the start of "wrecking ball"   
---
Honestly hilarious either way, thanks for the morning laugh
---
Still I get downvoted lol. Probably some stupid rogue or salty tank.
---
saw a guy selling ganking protection services to lower level players.
---
I would go hunter. Both rogues and hunters are great in PVP, both with their own strengths. 
---
Mainly because this is an alt---and leveling a rogue is not the most fun thing in the world. Like you said, you can autoshotbot your way to 60 with a huntard---there's a reason theyre one of the strongest leveling classes.
---
How have your experiences been on an RP-PVP server? I've been thinking of checking one out. I don't RP, but I feel like maybe the general attitude of the server better suits my interests.
---
I have heard that it is only accurate if everyone in the party has it.
---
No, he was a child at the time of Classic. Lore-wise it's only been like 8 years from vanilla to BFA.
---
Pretty sure threat meters in classic only work if the person you're tracking is also using the addon. That said, I've been having trouble with them myself. It's more of a level 60 issue, so I'd say go to your raiding party about it.
---
At this point you dont even get a gz in my guild from reaching 60, most of us were 60 like 3 weeks ago..
---
Is there any way to have the ! appear above quest givers heads again after I abandon a quest? I have no idea when I'm accepting a quest that it's 6 levels above me, and an elite quest, until after I've accepted it, and now I have no room for level appropriate quests. If I abandon the quest, the ! no longer shows above the NPCs head so it's hard to re-accept it later.
---
Only works if everyone has it. The game isnt designed to have threat meters work like they do in retail.
---
Enhancement Shaman only want one thing, dual wield.
---
This is where it became clear this is a troll
---
This add-on requires everyone in your group to have it also to work properly.
---
True, if I wanted to ruin someone's day, I would not attempt it on a meaningless message board where people share screenshots.
---
shut up stop defending blizzard
---
you think we can get hold of the alliance version&gt;?
---
Do warrior skill upgrades increase the amount of threat generated beyond just the extra damage?
---
I saw it three times in 7 runs? I saw it very first run, and another warrior got it, then I got it on my fourth run, and then the last run of SM Arm it dropped again and there was no one that needed it so I think it went to a Paladin, who I'm sure vendored it for the gold.
---
That no longer works thou because at the moment there is an overabundance of low and midlevel materials of all kinds (except ores maybe depending on server and population).
---
Lmao you're so sad xD
---
Maybe once the honor system gets released you'll feel like you're working towards something with pvp. Personally I'm not sad, I never liked Battlegrounds.
---
Only thing he responded to is the one calling him out
---
&gt; I'm going to trust a multi billion dollar company and their marketing team
---
Good point, multi-billion dollar companies are infallible and they've never been wrong about anything.
---
Blizzard was clearly correct when they said we don't want Classic WoW.  
---
They were also correct when they only planned 11 servers for North America. We know they were correct because there are now ~40 servers and 40 is the same number as 11.
---
What phase is the debuff limit being removed?
---
Its way easier to gwt skinning back up to 300
---
Weekly reminder to **not play mages**. That is all. 
---
Ok as a real response though, anecdotally I'm seeing a surprising need for Hunters/Locks/Rogues on my server (Pvp server too, which is nuts to be lacking those classes), as well as a lack of shaman.
---
Those first three classes are all fairly fun to play, proficient out in the world, and are generally pretty strong in world pvp as well.
---
At level 49 I was barely able to kill the priest and warrior. It wasn’t easy my dude. In fact the warrior did kill me once after I got the priest. But since they were on rez timers and they killed me right next to the GY I popped up and finished off the warrior lol
---
I wrote all that because people like you don’t get it. Servers like Skeram are legitimately unplayable as Alliance. Leveling up wasn’t fun, it was a constant chore of paranoia because Horde surrounded you 24/7. Many were passive and didn’t bother me, but if one of them decided to be aggressive it was all over, they would all descend upon me at once. And it was never the other way around.
---
Like I told the other guy, go make an Alliance character on Skeram, level to 30 and go try to quest in STV. I think you’ll catch on quick.
---
Roleplaying sex-games at night for low life losers. They will gladly pay gold for you to, you know. MY friend made a char named humantoilet and cashed in 45 g for 2 hours.. He is still quite embarresed and refuse to talk about it. But hey, a mount is a mount :)
---
At the end of the day, the weapon skills wont matter---im pretty sure they arent even considered in PVP. 
---
As far as stun resist though, yes--you'll regret not having orc if you're focusing on pvp. For PvE though, the class selection is much more flavor than anything else---nothing is going to push you over the edge. Troll gives you more threat, orc gives you more weapon, and tauren gives you more health. None of those things will make or break you.
---

---
you’re welcome
---
Sorry but this is wrong, I'm except for items like a head or paw of a mob items are solo drop, like collect 15 red belts from -blank- will all be solo drops.
---
What's the scam?
---
He's not really wrong for leveling. In dungeons though that's just dumb. I seek out some spirit gear on my hunter because it reduces down time and saves money having to buy drinks. I think currently (level 46) i have a 4/1 agi/spirit ratio.
---
I'd shoot that bitch in the face.. they have internet in prison right?
---
I played undead in warcarft III. Easy choice.
---
Oh my god... am I glad I don’t know you in real life xD your family Must be proud.
---
My assumptions are not right or wrong because of one person. I generalise a lot - I didn’t research your case specifically :P
---
In General my assumptions still stand and are probably right :)
---
Also I will stop answering now because obviously you are just a big piece of turd that nobody really needs in his life :p
---
You kill two targets at a time, one is getting bursted down with shadowbolts.. thats literally the opposite of slow :')  
---
Your fucking raid will be thankfully if you spam shadowbolts instead of dotting up the boss. You only want to fully dot up onyxia in phase 2.
---
My freind swapped late 30's
---
It's not the case all the time. It depends, some poisons high level mobs use are still low level things. I'm still curing stuff with my greater antidote that cures up to 35 in my 40s. Also some lines of rogue poisons are lower than they seem. Crippling poison is a level 20 poison and rogues use it into the 40s..
---
I feel that. I signed up because I had a couple friends who were playing that I haven't seen in game since I started. Kind of mirrors my experience with retail wow over a decade ago when everyone told me I had to start playing and then they quit a week later, haha. A lonely road indeed.
---
My brother always goes for the Hinterlands when reaching 47/48 it's a really nice questing location and when you're up for it you can do the quest for the ZF hammer if I'm not mistaken!
---
I'm using [ShadowedUnitFrames](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/shadowed-unit-frames/files/2779395) but Grid2 is my favorite choice for raid healing.
---
I was so confused until I remembered actually using bobbers, iron fishing pole and STV competition gear.
---
Right behind you!!
---
Which will be a complete clusterfuck if they're wrong about attrition rates.
---
Due to lack of necessary API in classic, CTM only works properly if it's installed on every party member's end. Other mistakes are possible, too, since it's interpreting combat logs to calculate threat, but I wouldn't know in detail about those.
---
Shamans are pink.
---
It cannot read threat of members in classic if they are not using the addon.
---
Savory deviate delight is selling for 19s per stack on my server lol.
---
This has been a hot topic recently with the layering explotation. General consensus is that if it was permitted in Vanilla, you're probably alright... sometimes. lol
---
Two words: Desolace shellfish.
---
This is more of a spelling test than a quiz
---
Yeah, RP servers are a bit slower, I think. Definitely didn't get there quick!
---
Why do people post things like this? Is OP completely self unaware of how big of a douche they are too?
---
whoa really. I mean I still get remorseless attacks and crit chance from assassination, but for dagger build in my mind I gotta have hemo, improv ambush. Also having preparation and improved sap helps. I still go really far into combat also getting blade flurry (planning on going at least 21/23 for combat/sub and then rest into assassination).
---
Priests are.
---
That would be too obvious
---
Didn't occur to me to look there. Thank you :)
---
why 1-9? I doubt your fingers are long enough to reach 7-9 without leaving WASD
---
How do you even pvp without feral charge :D
---
There's a main hand (that or unique) axe in BRD that drops with random enhancements + 10 attack power called the Ribsplitter. If you can get it with just agility, that's 11 agility and 10 attack power, making it just slightly better than bone slicing hatchet. It's BoE, so keep an eye on the AH.
---
Also if you're an alliance hunter, keep in mind you'll have kings during raids making this axe pairing even closer to the dal'rends combo. 
---
The Dal Rends combo is effectively ~8 attack power better (after converting all the stats to effective attack power). I played a ton of hunter on private servers...please don't roll need on dal rends vs rogues/warriors. That 8 attack power upgrade for hunters is miniscule vs what Dal Rends brings to rogues and warriors.
---
didn't think about this. Not sure if i've ever played an MMO from launch, I doubt the guy named playwifmyballs has much of a long term inverstment.
---
Mousewheel click is for stand. :)
---
jerk! lol
---
Which realms? There are no pvp servers that are massively alliance favored. Even if there were, blizzard is not going to let people transfer to another full realm.
---
Not all guilds want to purposefully stunt gear progression for some weird elitist circlejerk.
---
Bless you
---
No, which is why most people put off buying higher ranks of prot abilities
---
Warlocks seem much more involved (in a good way). If you want to aoe your way to glory than go for the frost mage--but leveling with a pet is one of the biggest advantage you can get. Not to mention fearing, you can juggle 3 or 4 mobs pretty easily.
---
Right now frost mages are rocking the DPS meters in any 'endgame' content--but that will change over time. Warlocks are by no mean slouches, and really come into their own.
---
Loot drops are based on the quest. Some drops will drop for everyone, others for only the current looter. If current looter doesn't have the quest or complted the quest then after they loot it's a free for all for others.
---
I believe when he said " the game's design was that not every class was good for every raid " 
---
what he really meant was 
---
 "the game's design was that not every SPEC was good for every raid"
---
 but hey, that's just me using my common sense. 
---
I'll let you do your typical redditor 'jump on your throat at the slightest mistake and make underhanded accusatory comments that do nothing to drive the discussion forwards and only serve as a way to make myself feel superior'. 
---
Whoops... did I just say that out loud? ah well....
---
What have they been wrong about aside from number of users?
---
SMASH
---
Basically tab sunder/revenge. Don't use heroic strike. But usually you will lose aggro because the mage starts aoeing once you have 1 sunder on 1/5 mobs.
---
we have FD, if the hunter cant FD when he pulls aggro then hes a bad player. And when something run and pulls things you say bad luck a runner pulled it, if the runner has a pet on it then lets burn the hunter for being bad.   
---
BUT I would argue that 99% of the time my pet will stop the runner from pulling more but noone says thanks for the pet finishing off a mob that other neglected to keep their DPS up. They just blame the hunter.  
---
I would argue for every one bad hunter theres 5 tanks that dont know how to tank
---
Yes I'm very liberal with my ignore.  With the larger server populations I'm using it as a stupid filter...
---
308-310 doesn’t decrease glancing at all according to what is the accepted theorycrafting.
---
Worst PSA ever........
---
It's not a matter of critical thinking lol. Doing whats best for you in a PuG is doing what is best for your guild. The upgrade is minuscule for hunter over some other item. It could be an amazing upgrade for a hunter over what they currently have. It should be based on what they are currently using. Also many people have stated once the agility enchant is released this a far greater upgrade over other items.
---
I didn't "make" anyone do anything, lol
---
Have you ever been on an RP server? People tend to opt to get into character for things. Our Guild has over 300 people, some folks nearby came over when I advertised the buff, and proceeded to do this. It's quite literally what happened.
---
I'm not talking about ranking grind, I just want to go hit some people that want to be hit :D
---
Ok sure, but then calculate the time it would take to get the money to get the bones required for 500-600k per hour all the way to 99.  This goes for most lucrative ways to get to 99 in rs.  It either requires exorbitant amount of money or long quest lines which can all take a lot of time in itself.
---
Shoulda needed one. Whoever won it got the other.
---
We called this quest super chain in vanilla. I remember doing it with a group of 5 of us in a night, took a few hours...
---
The bank wasn't meant for you
---
I would argue that 99% of the time my pet will stop the runner from pulling more but noone says thanks for the pet finishing off a mob that other neglected to keep their DPS up. They just blame the hunter.
---
It's kinda hilarious because it's not even right in retail. Like if you go ham immediately as a well geared DPS in a +15 of course you get aggro from everything and die. You don't need to wait as long, but the principle of "if DPS dies it's their fault" is still the same.
---
I think we're the only RP server in classic.  All the others are also PvP servers.  Without worry of the other faction ruining plans, we're able to act out more ideas.
---
In general I would agree. But everything that priest did was moronic. So I'm very tempted to assume he was just that big of an idiot.
---
I guess anyone can twist text right?
---
No they start the pull rather than let me, by the time I've even got close they have already entered combat, I don't enter combat until  I either take damage or use an ability.
---
Healers can use this to their advantage, for instance I will go generate some aggro on the next pack, while they sit and drink.
---
their mana regen is way lower than the imps. i tried it. its not even close.
---
holy shit...
---
I prefer to imagine it was spank. Mmmm.
---
its elvui, but you have to configure a lot, i can export my profile if you would like
---
I had a hard time, did a warrior to 40 on alliance, then a horde priest and just got 51 last night. 
---
I enjoy horde, definitely going to main there, but would totally roll an alt on alliance.
---
Wish I could've done this dungeon and SFK as Alliance, but finding a group and getting there seems impossible. 
---
Really disappointed in the Classic dungeon location bias, but at least I got the Duskwood epicness!
---
Starting at mid 30s, basilisk in southern shimmering.
---
Mid 40s, the wyvern type creatures in felwood.
---
Mid 50s, bats in plagueland.
---
I mixed in other mobs as well, one I don't want to say currently, but it isn't exactly unknown for farming.  The bats have been the surprising consistent farm.  Probably due to all serious farmers killing elementals currently.  This have left them untouched.
---
Tweaking classes is the absolute last thing I want to see. Attempting to balance the classes has gone on for 15 years and is the driving factor to retail being what retail is today with all classes feeling pretty much the same with different animations.
---
Dude how the hell do I get them?  My add-on shows there are quests there but I never see the NPCs in game.  It's just an empty burned down shack.  I'm level 39 currently and still don't see them.
---
This. Bone slicing Hatchets x2 gives more crit and more ap than Dal'rends.
---
Because that close to bis item is available to everyone, if you don't have it it's because you choose to not have it.
---
We're not talking about a warrior who did 500 ubrs/arena runs and didn't get rends/glad chest. We're talking about someone who wouldn't go to the auction house and press "buy" on 2 items, that clearly shows they value gold over gear progression, so why would you not put people in the back of the line when they probably aren't going to enchant it? and there are people who show they're willing to put in the bit of gold it takes to help the guild?
---
It’s always from the perspective of looking forward on the ship.
---
Actually, my 0.01% upgrade is worth much more to me, since improving improving some random person by 10% won't have any effect on me.
---
I should probably clarify I think Cruelty early on is far more valuable than Improved Rend and should be your first 5 points whether you level as Arms or Fury.  I do think Piercing Howl is worthwhile early on, especially with how difficult it is to take on multiple mobs as a low level Warrior.  So really maybe putting your first 11 points in Fury and going Arms from that point on makes sense too.

Best way for a hunter to fight Frost mages is to allocate frost resistance to your pet, this way they have a good chance of resisting the freeze. Don't quote me on this, but I believe there are some potions that removes snare effects, that would get you out of the freeze.

Leveling a mage without AoE farming. Sure, its slower and less gold per hour and whatnot. Same with dungeons. Give me a traditional run with CC over AoE/Spellcleave whatever you call it now.
---
I don't care. This is how Vanilla was for me and how I enjoy it. It's not a race.
---
just read others comments and you can see its like 50-50 hate and indifference...... but 50% hate is a lot without and love
---
The only exception would be “streamers” because their work also equals their hobby. Majority of video gamers are not superheroes working 9-5 and maintaining an active and social lifestyle while downing MC in less than two weeks of release. 
---
Stop lying to yourself.
---
&gt; The things you say and the misinformation you spread has consequences
---
The same to you. I played over 8 hours a day on average since launch and things were never as bad as last weekend, after the second round of free transfers opened.
---
I never stated the 20/80 figure was fact.
---
As for the 3k+ coalition who moved, the guilds moved, but not everyone followed suit. Even the day we decided to move our guild, we were in the talks to merge with the remnants of 2 other guilds, after we all had lost most of our members to people who transfered.
---
ie.: Let's say 2k of that 3k French Canadian horde coalition left, then I'm pretty sure at least 5k Alliance also left, so the balance is just as bad (and probably worse) than it was before, considering it's active people who left, while the data posted on WoWHead 10 days ago included a lot of inactive people.
---
In the end, if you think my single comment on the matter, on a reddit post with ~100 upvotes will make a significant impact on the Stalagg server balance, you're delusional and a much worse fearmonger than you claim me to be...
---
Chill dude. At 44 you are still far in front of the curve. Dont get sucked into the vacuum of reddit and discord or guild chat. These dont represent the over all population in the slightest. Most players are much lower level.
---
I definitely like the idea of warlocks tagging beside healers to help show them taking aggro unless there's silencing mobs naturally.
---
Sadly no warlock I've played with has thought of that. You guys give me hope I might meet one someday.
---
Real talk, I regret rolling my warrior as an Orc because I know I’m always going to be expected to use axes almost exclusively. There are a lot of cool warrior weapons in the game that id love to get but I know a lot of people are going to respond harshly to that

Imo 10-30 is the worst as you are very much so sitting in your theme park ride throughout. After 30 the game really opens up and turns more into a sandbox where you level in multiple zones at once and move all over the world, especially when you get your mount at 40.
---
I had 300 at 52...then was like hmm now is a good time to buy a bunch of runcloth to turn in so at 60 I can ride epic raptor!!! Nope just down 100g and nowhere close to exalted
---
This whole comment section is so sad.  I thought some were playing along, but they all seem so earnest.
---
The best PvP gear isn't a side grade until BWL, and even then some pieces are still good into AQ40
---
Im using ElvUI and I can do that. So its definitely possible.
---
Auction House sniping. Its only for the patient. Some people are foolish enough to list items with a buyout price and a 1 copper opening bid. Bid 2 copper, wait, win the item, profit. It happens more often with cloth than you might expect...
---
if I'm sitting at 100% mana as a priest and wanding because the tank does his job right, I'd prefer to toss a heal on the warlock to let him keep doing his best dps, than him life leeching at a slow rate.
---
I still cannot decide on druid or rogue.  I switch between the two so much I'm really getting nowhere.  I have no plans to raid, I don't have a lot of time to play, I'm mainly solo or with a friend when I'm on.  I love to 1v1, and play BG's so I'm looking for a class that is easy to gear.  Druid pvp seems really fun and hard to master and I never really played a druid in all of my years of WoW but there is a lot of negativity or caution around playing one as they don't do a lot of damage.  The Rogue is just a "go to" class for my style, has good DPS and CC but the heavy reliance on cool downs is a turn off.
---
Cortana and the Xbox service I have already deleted from my system. Cleaned all because I've read it could be a problem indeed. And ran malware detection programs and every other program possible.

tl;dr:
---
mage baby gets mad he had to press more than 1 key
---
There's other things, like mounts. I was a server first raider in Vanilla/TBC and I PVPed because I wanted that raptor mount. Got it eventually.
---
Tuxedo or bust.
---
The other guy is my friend and we decided to share the gold we make from AH :)
---
Nobody knows.  I'm sure Blizzard will give us a decent notice, though.
---
It doesnt even matter if it does or not.
---
Within a grp you get an xp bonus. 2 mobs killed from 2 people will give around 1.3 times the xp you'd get from one mob solo.
---
Well, last reset we disenchanted 3 pieces of druid t1 set, couldn't get a single druid for the raid
---
The horde have no honor and will attempt to gank wherever they have numbers advantage.
---
Another commenters is saying you need to help him fight the pack of 5 elites right outside the gate or he will die.. I am wondering who to believe lol
---
As someone in the mid 50's now where the shield armor is almost required, I miss the *shit* out of 2-h face rolling scarlet monastery as a 'tank.'
---
My rotation was Battle Stance &gt; charge &gt; sweeping strikes &gt; berserker &gt; both the rage skills &gt; whirlwind &gt; defensive stance &gt; Cleave. It was glorious. Windfury would proc, I was dealing 50% of the dungeon damage. The healer would barely get a single spell off before the 3/4 mobs were just dead from melee cleave.
---
farming is essentialy boring lol, not much else you can do to make money
---
So I don’t see how you cannot make money on skinning even if you are to vendor low level skins because the AH isn’t viable. You should be able to make money.
---
Okay. I will tell you a huge secret.  
---
At lvl 52 I stopped running dungeons alltogether and went to Azshara.  
---
There, I dont use any of my demons.  
---
I used enslave demons on the Hellcaller demons and used them as pet.  
---
They do massive damage, that helps them maintaim aggro versus ALL YOUR DOTS.  
---
So while your hellcaller is spamming fireball and tanks your main target, you go this to a 2nd target:  
---
Shadowbolt into immolate (so both commect at the same time.)  
---
You run away and use all your dots and fear.  
---
You literally kill that enemy while its feared.  
---
When your hellcaller is at 5% health, you dismiss him and deathcoil him.  
---
This way you can grind easily to lvl 60 and farm felcloth and demonic runes (which you need for robe of the void).  
---
On top of that you get runecloth on mass and elixir of the mungoose recipe.  
---
Trust me.. I see tons of warlocks not utilizing all of their spells. Shadowball is perfect as you need it, you dont need to spam it. One shadowball is enough for your opponents to be absolutely weakened for your dots.
---
Lvl 30 for the tuxedo flex ofcourse
---
Vendors for alot.  Though I did mix in some AH mobs.  Elementals and demons specifically.  The problem with them is they are heavily camped, even in off hours.
---
60/40 = 1.5 = 150% = 50% more.
---
Exactly, unless time is an issue I never heal myself in raids with spells when I can just as easily use a heavy runcloth bandage.  Saves precious mana in the long run.
---
You complain about quest mobs in your post, but that problem will only get worse once they remove layering. Your other two complaints can easily be fixed by being invited to a group.
---
Seems like you made this post just to vent, not to fuel discussion.
---
Currently 59, trying to figure out when I should drop herbs for Alchemy.  I certainly want to stockpile as much as I can for now.
---
&gt;It annoys me so much when I join a group needing a tank and there's a warrior who apparently refuses to tank already there
---
Feel that as a healer, then the shadow priest rolls on healing gear cause he will heal at some point, like how about right now and gear youself while healing?
---
I always feel bad when I don't notice dots on a mob and I tag it before they kick in. Try and look first if I see a lock around, but sometimes you just gotta gun it. Always ask in char for groups but despite there being 20 people around killing the same shit I rarely get a response.

CensusPlusClassic addon
---
I have offended them beyond redemption
---
Is it decent at 60? I play on Gehennas and I haven't been particularly ganked, but every single time I've been attacked it was either someone who vastly outleveled me or 3-4 people vs me. I just logged in from the Gadgetzan inn and there were 3 alliance, including me, and about 15 horde.
---
I'm not having a hard time, most horde ignore me (I guess people don't really wanna attack a warlock because even if you win you could die after or walk away with 10% hp) but still, I'm level 51 and I've never had a fair pvp fight.
---
I always ask a hunter if they're going to roll on 'insert strength mail here'. You would be shocked at how many times I get a 'yes' back---obviously I dont invite them. Stereotypes exist for a reason, not saying theyre always right---but some people just dont know what the hell their doing. And youd be a fool not to think those people dont flock to the easiest class to play in the game.
---
Rattlegore seems to be horde dominated. Every where I go there are overlevel horde packs doing nothing but ganking alliance lowbies. Chasing us down on mounts, hunter tracking us so we don't get away, blockading instances. 
---
Census data says they only have a few thousand more than us, maybe there is just a disproportionate amount of scum on horde? Hard to say.
---
# Fuck I love Classic. Gz!
---
My progression as a rogue:
---
Weapons: 1-19 random whites and greens. 19-33ish cruel barb. Sometime past 30, get some sort of green temporary weapons to replace cruel barb, or Gnomer weapons (I got electrocutioner's leg and toxic revenger from Gnomer... both higher DPS, but pretty weak). 38ish sword of serenity (SM quest reward) and vanquishers blade (RFD quest reward). 45ish get hand of antu-sul for mainhand from ZF, offhand vanquishers blade.  As I approach 50 I'll go for thrash blade and a sunken temple dagger with 35 DPS. 
---
Cruel barb, vanquisher's sword, sword of serenity, and hand of antu sul have been awesome and game changers so far. Every other weapon is just OK.
---
Armor: mostly quest rewards, random drops, a couple of dungeon pieces. Deadmines cape lasted a long time. Triprunner dungarees from Gnomer quest last really long time. Tunic of Westfall at like level 15 lasted me forever (seriously, up until ZF when I got a new leather chest, though that's likely too long).
---
My experience getting armor has been OK. I remember wearing a red defias mask for a long time and not having actual shoudlers with stats for even longer. Lol
---
I know that salt. It's even tougher when you are successfully clearing the trash with these messy teams. DPS don't learn if they keep wining with full boar damage. Honestly I sometimes wish the healer just let the DPS die when they pull agro off me. 
---
I know that's kinda spiteful but a team  that actually works together  as a team is so much more fun and efficient.
---
The items and clues around the inn give the quests. There is no npcs. For example you can click the shield in the wall or footprints in the ground.
---
We had omen in vanilla which everyone had as threat was important. Did omen work because we all had it or would it have worked anyway due to some vanilla reason?
---
Ah, thrown off by the "my upgrade..." part.
---
I don’t think you’ll hear a complaint from me but in the midst of combat I know it gets frustrating when not in the circumstance you outlined. Agreed.
---
Private servers dont have more changes than classic. Not intentionally that is. True no changes would be old AV. Till 1.12 rolls out and then change to 1.12 AV. Thats how vanilla was. And no changes means exactly that. Starting at 1.12 id a change
---
I always walk past higher levels minding my own buisness. But at the last second I shoot a wand shot and instandly blink to the side of the road and hide behind a tree.
---
Sometimes they just keep on walking.
---
Sometimes they turn around to look if they see me.
---
Sometimes they will search for me and kill me.
---
Its always worth to shoot a wand shot at passing higher levels.
---
yeah a few minutes after posting it spawned, weird that it doesnt just say out of stock
---
Anytime people post census data like that, just know its 2 weeks old. Why does 2 weeks matter? The first subs are about to expire so we wont have updated census numbers after 1 month
---
You're allowed to be wrong. Shamans are not better in PvE than Paladins. Period.
---
Huh weird group of 5 just killed deadmire and everyone looted his tooth.
---
I've been listening to the Pretty Lights remix off this song on repeat as I fish. It's been absolutely fantastic.
---
There are millions of people paying $15/month to play a game that was already developed and runs on a potato. How dense do you have to be to think that's not "financially viable"?
---
Private servers proved there's long-term demand when they continued to grow for multiple years despite having the deck stacked against them.
---
And do you really think Blizzard was right about the number of players when they created 11 NA servers but ended up with 40? *Really*???
---
Was this a hunter ... needing on a mace!?
---
I was told by different sources that Blizzard blocked the census add-on, so the data can no longer be updated, not 100% sure if that's the case, as I didn't use the add-on and don't know on what site the data was compiled. Care to share a link to it, if you have one?
---
Lol, 90% of the times I see someone ask about the unit frames (or ui addon in general) it’s elvui
---
I use it, too and just love it. It looks really great and has so many features integrated. Even out of the box, it’s already pretty great, imo.
---
That might be due to the fact that they dont want to compete for gear.  The paradigm has shifted a ton regarding which classes should be able to need which types of armor.  Now that BiS lists are plentiful, and it is well accepted that warriors/hunters/shaman can and should be able to roll on mail and leather gear, there is a lot more competition.  It is likely that a hunter, rogue, warrior, and shaman could all be running a dungeon for the same piece of armor.  People simply don't want the competition.  It's only business.  
---
If you want to see how the paradigm has shifted, go look at https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11726/savage-gladiator-chain .   The comments from 2006 are all saying stuff like "this is definitely a hunter/shaman peice, not for warrior."  Now that piece is well accepted to be BiS for hunters, warriors, and enh shaman.  Back in the day, you'd probalby be Gkicked for needing that as a warrior since it's not plate.  like 80% of DPS warrior preraid BiS is rogue gear.  You'd have been laughed out of the raid if you'd have come strolling into MC like that in 2006.
---
It’s called Prat
---
I got rolled on boy alliance in my 30-40s A LOT. now most transferred. It does happen both sides
---
I refuse to use it only when it is a burden to the healer and not enough gain of the group in general, if for some reason i dump all my mana, and wanding isn't doing enough, maybe i'll life tap, but it depends on the situation.
---
As with what you've said, on the other side of the same coin i could say life tapping and more DPS also means more chance that agro is pulled from tank, and that the healer will have more targets to heal not only if the lock gets agro from too much DPS, but also because of the life tap itself, if you're ooming in literally every fight you should look at how you utilize your spells or your gear attributes.
---
You can change yourself and your approach, or you can wait for the community to change around you. That choice is yours.
---
I heal more often than not, and have been healing for a long time. I'm watching health bars, mob AOE and stunnable casts usually. Keeping up with what abilities other classes are using outside of CC is very, very low on the priority list.
---
Regardless, good luck to you. You might be in for a long wait.
---
Why are you here?
---
Lmao the truth
---
I just save my WTF folder every day
---
aimed shot, multi shot, arcane shot, serpent sting. All take mana to cast. I good hunter is only 40% auto attack rest is from casting.... Im not saying grab items with +spell damage. But if an item has agi and intel or spirit its def a  plus.  A spamming hunter will run out of mana every other fight.
---
Dude....taking 2 hours out of your adult life as a parent is perfectly acceptable. I don’t know a dad that haven’t gone on a fishing trip, or has watched a game by himself. Dedicating your life to only work and kids in unhealthy for everyone involved.
---
This is the answer I was looking for. Thank you sir!
---
long time.  skeram horde will either have to reroll elsewhere, try to help alliance with donations one way or another, or get fucked for a while.
---
Battle of Darrowshire questline. As a bear druid this gives you the BiS ring all game. Also it's really cool.
---
Realistically any pet will get you to level cap without much fuss. It comes down to asthetics and personal play style. 
---
Personally I like owls, cats, or wolves.
---
so that means you dont actually have 4k worth of items and you are over pricing it all..
---
Most people aren't going to tell people their spots if it's not well known.

Because having all of the gear go to a small set of people is somehow beneficial to your guild as a whole...? 
---
If your guild is so amazing and you give a shit so badly why do you have people who don't have all the pre-bis already? You want to be part of the elite, but you aren't, never will be, and you cry on the forums about how other people are "wrong" providing none of your flawed logic as a counter-point. 
---
I honestly feel bad for your guild having to put up with you.
---
Sweet, thanks for the tip!
---
I ran into a horde mage in Wetlands AoE farming a group of gnolls I needed for a quest so I killed him. Poor guy was probably just trying to think outside the box and find a good spot to farm but those babies are for my quests.
---
In orgrimmar there is a repeatable quest that gives rep for runecloth stacks.
---
I tried this, did fury to 40, and i dont believe its a good choice for anyone that wants to do anything other than power farm. Having anger management and being able to swap stances is so huge. Being able to swap to def stance and shield bash a cast is huge, but not possible without anger managment. Being able to swap to zerker and intercept away when you make too big of a pull or when someone engages you in pvp is too good to pass up. Im totally confused how this became the general consuses to use fury. It really kills the warrior experience without anger management.
---
Yeah I def envy some of these people.. must be nice!

The coast along the upper left of the map (where Dalaran is) only has Greater Sagefish schools and wreckage pools on this patch.

---
My personal idea for Classic+ involves all these unused pre-Cata zones being added in semi-frequent major content patches (instead of the expansion model). I know a lot of them got Cataclysm versions but I'd like to see places like old Hyjal crawling with demons, Grim Batol as a stronghold of the Red Dragonflight, Gilneas in the early days of the worgen curse before civil war took over the city, Quel'thalas before the Blood Elves reclaimed most of it along with an entirely Scourge-overrun Silvermoon (cool raid opportunity)...
---
Lots of things in BFA are not in Vanilla, such as nameplate view distance. Why would they add leeway but deploy a hotfix for nameplates ? iT's In BfA aS i'Ve ToLd YoU !
---
You really deserve more slaps on your face, that'd shut this stupid mouth. Or pehaps you received too many slaps, that's why you can't build any logic.
---
Why would a shaman not twist on a 30-40 second boss fight?  Bosses are already dying that fast and the time is only going lower.
---
Exactly. People saw a "skew" in one direction and took it as fact. Those were NOT individual players but characters. One person could have 10 bank alts that got scanned where as others have no alts.
---
Wowhead did not clarify this or make it known. It dumped data on people and presented it as a census. People saw this and reacted poorly by re-rolling or transferring based off numbers that were provided with zero context.
---
Blizzard 100% should have controlled factions better but Wowhead fucked the situation even harder.

Have you watched StormX? He is a good example of PVP without moonkin form. But I have equally seen videos of people pvping with moonkin form.

You may be limiting your options if you take moonkin as it means you are unable to get Natures swiftness in the resto tree. But I'm sure against average players you will be fine with moonkin form. If you're planning to be the best of the best at pvp though then you may want to go for NS. And get engineering while you're at it. ;)
---
I reckon there are fewer people playing WoW now than back then.
---
That's a win-win to me.
---
Thanks, hmm it doesn't seem to be bad tbh. Although if layering really gets turned off that could change things drastically.
---
Hunter might be an option.
---
You can do well with just auto-shot and everyone loves pets.
---
questing is boring when you are taking an hour to do a fucking quest because of the amount of people also doing the fucking quest. ... Sorry.
---
Take a group where 3 dps and tank all need the weps? That's basically setting yourself up for frustration and anger. Plus guessing a lot of other gear goes to waste.
---
That is absolutely the Hunter being bad. A mob that flees does not pull the next group until he rallies and comes back. The hunter should be shooting that guy so he does before he rallies. He should NOT have a pet on that guy. The tank/rogue/pally. .or anyone else doing melee should ALSO not be on that guy, it's up to ranged to kill him.
---
Not everyone wants to be the villain.
---
for pve ye, but for everything else, questing, pvp flightpaths, dungeon entrances, 60 quest items. horde are superior.
---
There are 2 types of groups with reserves: 1) Bads who are too impatient to wait for their time to win an item 2) Goods who have literally no other reason to do a dungeon besides the thing they're reserving
---
You can usually tell by language which is which. You wanna run stuff with #2 if you can.
---
If you aren't 60 by phase 2 you never will be since by 48 or something you start giving honor to lvl 60s that'll jump you every time they see you since you are so rare and they need that honor for the pvp gear
---
I keep feeling like I have 90 levels to go but nah I'm halfway
---
Wait... are you a mage?
---
Because that would make the warrior trading &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; food even better haha
---
Wait what? If you start to win, we flee.
---
&gt;Dont let min maxers ruin your experience.
---
Think that's what I needed to hear. I used to be one of those people but now I just don't have the same desire to be bleeding edge.
---
Thank you.
---
Good job handling it well, I would have freaked out ha! I am only a lvl 16 Warrior so I am not prepared for my first attack!
---
These censuses always say that Kromcrush is about 50/50 but any alliance player who has left the alliance zones could tell you it's at least 65% horde 
---
The census shit isn't accurate
---
I transferred to Earthfury from Thalnos and I highly recommend it.
---
You’re confusing collection quests with bounty quests.  Collection quests will only drop for one party member unless they loot the enemy and don’t pick the item up, or loot the enemy but don’t have the quest while you do.
---
Bounty quests usually involve “go kill this named mob and bring back his head/tail/tooth/penis”.   In those cases, everyone will be able to loot the quest item.  
---
There are VERY few collection items that were accidentally marked as bounty items, the only one coming to mind being for Flute of Xavaric in felwood, where you have to collect 5 felbind samples, but each drop can be picked up by each party member.  E’kos also will drop for every party member.  Past that, no, grouping up doesn’t get everyone their quest items faster.
---
Yeah Sulfuras LOL!
---
&gt;Even outside of raiding, how many elemental shamans do you see?
---
A lot, because they are top tier in pvp
---
It’s not just work. A lot of people want to spend time with friends, on relationships, at the gym, cooking, etc.
---
&gt;then hes a bad player
---
That's exactly it. Hunter is stupid easy to level so lots of people play hunter. And most of them are bad. Can you seriously fault groups for not wanting to gamble on whether the hunter is decent or not?
---
Nice! I need to take some time off to head down to the Smash tourneys.. havent seen those guys since release lol
---
Stop shielding warrior tanks*
---
Also, a bubble at a critical moment can be the difference between a wipe and landing a heal in time
---
We had to run it a lot. We saw everything plenty of times, except the epic from princess. And, of course, the ring, which we saw exactly four times.
---
Looking forward to doing the exact same with all the various bosses that drop bits of bis for three different classes!
---
It is so gd good. Makes fights vs casters a lot better, and i have plenty of tools to get away from melee as it is (especially with engineering). 
---
Honestly, I might stick with it for now. Survival is fun, and entrapment is great in pvp, but that extra interrupt is huge. Plus the extra pet damage is great at a time where nobody has good gear
---
They delete characters under level 10? I don't think I've ever had one deleted by them and I was unsubscribed for years
---
I dont think one class is more important than the other, or if one is as important than the other. I think as long as people play their role in the raid, everyone is good. It's not a hard concept to grasp. In my opinion in a perfect world the healer shouldnt even have to heal dps(with exception of different mechanics that may or may not hit dps with aoe)
---
I’m 42 Druid on fairbanks and it’s atrocious 
---
I went to gadgestzan yesterday might as well have been a horde city
---
In the end man it really doesn't matter, just play what you like the look of the most.
---
Source? Because there was only one census done before transfers opened and it showed 55% horde.
---
Nice.. I need to take some time off to head down to the Smash tournys. I haven't seen those guys since release haha
---
Well you can always start to ask people for a bit of gold in Ironforge heh  
---
It's better than running till 55lvl
---
Exactly druids don't loose, they just leave.
---
what is the bag called?
---
I was thinking how many alts I would need to have to just only level with rested xp all the way through.
---
You generate a stupid amount of rage if you have 2 1handers. Being able to fully spam your abilities.
---
This is hilarious but really what is that person doing? Are they afk the whole time? Do they just wait for someone to react and wait there? I am amused and intrigued lol.
---
Runny thing is that at the start of BfA they reduced the threat on tanks for it to matter more again. I think they reduced it by 900%. Didnt change anything. Just imagine the huge number by which they increased threat on tanks since vanilla. Considering that even lowering the threat by 900% its still virtually impossible to lose aggro
---
Sometimes I just dont have the mental capacity to make the pulls and lead and just want to chill. Usually those are dungeons I just want xp in though.
---
I dont understand asmr. Id rather work than listen to asmr tbh.
---
I sneaked an edit in there, not sure if you replied before I did, but check out the WoWHead Druid leveling guide, if you haven't.
---
Also, keep in mind that as an hybrid class, you might end up having to heal, once in a while, so it's a good idea to keep a INT+SPI set around in case you need it.
---
You don't need to spec into Resto to heal instances, either, although as a new player you might find it difficult to manage your mana in instances with little to no experience healing.
---
 [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/485901441](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/485901441)  yw, first saurfang starts at about 30min
---
Haha thanks! I think I was lucky that the rouge wasn't so quick to react though.
---
He literally would for a 49 though, so quit the semantics game, will you. His point is loud and clear, and you come off as a jackass.
---
Oh that's exciting! When does the halloween one start? It's already fall!
---
You can bind them directly without dragging the spell into your bar.

-&gt; hotkeys -&gt; scroll only little down to "Special action key" 1-x (one is the most left one always)

Goes for druid shapeshift, warrior stances, pally auras, rogue stealth, shadowpriest

Comparable to healbot?
---
See my edit and https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/hunter-dps-pve-spec-builds-talents . No im not hit capped at 9% im at 3% ATM
---
cause you've seen my bank
---
My death at the jump was completely inconsequential to the group as the dungeon was already fully cleared, sorry you didn't get that
---
Oh well then it’s a different story I guess 
---
Where does peacemaker drop btw ?
---
I'm imagining an RP guild that operates in competition to the WoW Bank.
---
IE:  You deposit GOLD, that you can withdrawal later.
---
The bank may "invest" that gold, just like real life banks do with your deposits.  IE:  They may buy/sell on the AH if and when they spy an opportunity in the "market".
---
The trick being the bank needs to be organized enough to produce the deposits when a withdrawal is requested.
---
This would most likely devolve into a pyramid scheme, with amazing results on an RP server.  IE:  [Bank-runs in Stormwind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOzMdEwYmDU).
---
I don't have the time to edit this clip, overlaying WoW references over the appropriate bits.  Someone else take up this noble cause.
---
Some people don't like to think about the future. But it's better to plan ahead and not use it then, need something at a moments notice.
---
Only, if the Mob rallies. .you can shoot the mob with ranged even if it's standing in the middle of another pack without pulling that pack if it is still fleeing.
---
If a melee chases it (including pet), then the melee will aggro the next pack.
---
This is why any ranged (Hunter/mage/lock) should immediately switch focus to guy's that are fleeing.
---
So was the ability to pay so you didn’t get XP in PVP. 🙂
---
Hunter loot
---
I made a new priest on bfa to play with my daughter who just started. At level three I was killing groups of level 5s and 6s just by running around carrying shadow word pain. Mana never dropped under 95%...
---
I remember doing this back in the days, getting into all the places we weren't supposed to be. Exploring was so much fun back then! Getting into the emerald dream was a highlight.
---
Scarlet monastery AOE farm (lock, priest, 3x mage)
---
You sir, are a definition of a slave.
---
I play with my wife at my side talking and having conversations like adults, asking how was her day and stuff..
---
Then I get to work late because I was playing all night and my boss know, and he is chill, he knows that I deliver more than anyone here even getting late.
---
Unleash yourself dude, it's not worth living like this crap ffs.
---
I hope you’re just over exaggerating to get a point across. Not sure who would ever put a person on ignore just because they aren’t as good as you expect them to be.  Maybe be a bit patient and try to help them learn or just don’t group with them again.
---
I’m speaking from my personal experience and trying to rationalize why certain people won’t group with you. I’ve never once seen anyone say “I don’t group with hunters.” Move on and don’t group with them because that’s ridiculous?
---
That kinda was my point on melee weaving. It shouldn’t be used often and most hunters don’t even know how to properly do it. Prioritizing int because you think you need more mana for melee weaving is counterintuitive though.
---
When I was on RPPvP the overall experience was amazing. When I went to a high pop server with streamers, it was a basket of Dic\*\*s.
---
I don't blame; probably wants to play that sweet autoattacker class! :P
---
Why is it that we need a ton of comments that are basically the equivalent of old crotchety men like "Well....back in MY day".
---
It's a new way to play the game.  No, it's not a race, but if this game is supposed to be played however you'd like, that courtesy extends to the people trying new stuff.
---
Nope. The easiest choise in my life
---
It looks like it could be a scene from Dune.
---
I've had no issue with solo so far, in 1v1 I hardly ever lose even if they get the jump on me. Between my heals and over 12 buffs at any given time (Im an alchemist) Im hard to kill. I enjoy hunting for herbs so I always have tons. 
---
Even if Im losing I stun them then pop a speed pot. and book it, with Pursuit of Justice (+8% movement speed) I always get away. If I'm being camped worse case Ontario I res Nd bubble hearth as any pally should haha. If that fails I just go outside and smoke a bowl, if they are still camping then Ill just go play my RP alt :)
---
I'm also in a guild of 150 or so that is pretty active with PvP and dominating zones so there is alwayz the option to call in backup / a raid (we raid hillsbrad and STV every weekend). Hopefully horde do the same and we can all have a good scrap!
---
Probably 30-40
---
No this is a group of mages together, we mount up and run to the graves, jump on the little sink thing and the mobs reset to the entrance, then we clear the GY, we also clear the scarabs room as that nets a decent gold amount too.
---
Warriors get by far the most benefit from spirit during leveling, so if the staff is actually slow and has a high damage range, then they should absolutely roll on it.
---
I’d say if you have enough to buy your mount at 40 wait all the way until 60
---
Or you never had a real relationship and always fell in love with crazy controlling women.
---
I NEVER had a girl that would find my 3hrs per day gaming bad, not when I am working, bringing more money than she is and taking care of the house.
---
Fuck pussyslaves. You are a man, be in control (of your life of course).
---
DPS don't use T1, so the tanks take all the pieces.
---
If someone could amass an army to snipe that Asmon turd and his 12year old army , then I’d be impressed! Was nice watching him get owned in Org
---
It’s just i’ve never been deep back to the beginning. I played wow briefly in 2010, and just started again recently.
---
Yeah you need a pretty absurd amount of it, like 7k cloth at least depending on the city.
---
In fairness this doesnt only apply to Hunters.. I had a War roll need and win for the crossbow in LBRS.  I have seen Wars roll on Rogue loot, Pallies on cloth, Shammies on leather and cloth etc.
---
Oh, the various ways WOW causes us to be abandoned! Guess I’m going to have to group with randos for RFC.
---
Exactly, we decide to leave because you don’t deserve our interest. Not because we feel threatened in any way. That never happens obviously /whistle
---
Sites that held census data from the census plus addons before blizz broke them. It doesn't really matter, as a slight imbalance always cascades into a larger one.
---
You’re asking for a lot of information that could all be found in a few google searches. I’d recommend doing the work yourself rather than asking someone to do it for you, you will learn a lot more
---
I went ahead and made the build I will be starting with at 60. 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#coZViohthtI0iboh
---
This build will give you some great PvP talents while also not hindering your ability to do damage in raids. Early on the hit chance is way more important than damage. You should not be stepping into a raid with less than the hit cap as a hunter. This is because you never want Tranq Shot to miss if it misses and there is not another Hunter then the entire raid can wipe. This build does not match any of the ones on Icy Veins since it is a PvP, PvE hybrid. You can take one point out of wing clip and put it into Aspect of the Hawk if you want to. None of those builds include Deterrence, which is definitely a big oversight. Deterrence is very good in PvP and also has many uses in PvE for example the suppression chamber in BWL where you could be needed to tank a mob or two and without Deterrence you will struggle greatly. For one point it doesn’t make any sense not to grab it. I hope this helps you out in your adventures. Let me know if you have any questions about the talents I chose.
---
Where's the trick?
---
I can't understand why people play with such ugly UIs
---
If doing that puts extra burden on your partner you're a shitty person. Otherwise have at it
---
6 out 10 is not the bottom 4.
---
7th, 8th, 9th and 10th are the bottom 4.
---
Lv60s, what do you like better for gold making / general use?  I'm currently Lv33 and I'm Mining/Skinning, once I hit 60 I plan to drop Skinning for Engineering but I'm wondering if I should drop Mining for Herbalism instead.
---
Once Dire Maul gets released I plan to 2-man farm East so I'll have access to Thorium Veins, but I think Herbalism will still be more generally useful and has better money making potential?
---
&gt;I'm going to trust a multi billion dollar company and their marketing team 
---
That has to be one of the most embarrassing things I've ever read on this website.
---
“Go out there and being me crystals even though this cave I never leave is fucking full of them”
---
You are the definition of entitled. Doesnt matter if hes standing around, he doesnt owe you anything. I hope your guild recognizes your character and takes your blacklists with a grain of salt, because otherwise it's going to fill up fast.
---
Now, i remember, his dad was having a werewolf issue, right?
---
I am dropping this actually, I will be going Herb/alch flasks and stuff or miner/engi for pvp.
---
So a class question should i play warlock with VW or sucubiss? For leveling seen alot of people say sucubis and whats the talent tree for that?
---
You should be alright with top level green imo. I remember running mc back in the day with basic stuff and we all still made it.  Although the elixir of fire resistance was mass produced by our guild.
---
I mean I have a family and a wife and I never even got near your level of "molding" yourself to your precious wife.
---
Seriously dog, that's insane.
---
False
---
Screech. It works like Demoralizing Shout/Road, but it has no cooldown and only costs 20 focus. Carrion birds also get +5% armor which is significantly better than the +4% health that Gorillas get, along with the attack power reduction from Screech making enemies deal significantly less damage.
---
You put them on ignore because they put you on ignore...is this some sort of balancing ritual?
---
Same here but I can still get a lot of playtime in (no kids though)
---
4 hrs a day during the week and 8ish each on the weekend. Still plenty of time to do other things
---
That's exactly why.  There's like 15 kill and find item quests with absurdly good rewards. 
---
Go look up the alliance quest in hinterlands.  Look around hinterlands.  Then go to blasted lands.  Then run ZF.  Then back to blasted lands.  Then back to hinterlands.  for green item rewards.
---
So a class question should i play warlock with VW or sucubis? For leveling seen alot of people say sucubis and whats the talent tree for that? Warrior arms or fury for leveling
---
No kicks, no gouges, no kidney shots, no blinds. That rogue was a piece of cake. 
---
Fairy fire should be the first thing you put on a rogue. We are helpless against it. 
---
Still, good work with the root-and-wrath!
---
&gt; the BRD farm doesnt work like it did on Private servers.
---
The BRD farm for the open area right after you enter hasn't worked on private servers for years, however you can use th shadowforge key to get into the big bridge mechanism room and pull a pretty easily farmable pack there.
---
Yes.
---
This is the rave cave.
---
Honestly I mainly quested as a mage until 42 when I could go to lost rigger cove in Tanaris. Very easy to get 10+ mob pulls there, its insane. In a few days I leveled to 47 with the odd ZF run mixed in
---
1. Not sure, I'm new to WoW also. 
---
2. There are tons of different ways, grinding mobs, gathering/crafting professions, rare BoE drops, pets, all sorts of stuff. It really just comes down to what you want to do. 
---
3. It's not clear. Everything right now is speculation. I personally want Classic+, but there's no evidence to support one over the other right now. 
---
4. Yep. Not entirely sure how rare they are, but my friends (who have both played since Vanilla, although never at a hardcore level) said they've never seen one drop from a regular mob before. I had a BoE epic sword drop from a regular wolf outside Tanaris last week though, so it's definitely possible. Not sure about add-ons that would show this, but Classic Wowhead normally lists any drops that are available from a mob. I'm not sure if BoE world drops are included in that list. If you're wanting an add-on for dungeon/raid loot, that also lists BoE's available from trash mobs in dungeons, then I'd recommend Atlas Loot.
---
Magically enhanced by the latent powers of Karazhan, of course
---
Theoretically , but realistically every time you roll  a 2 , the chances of you getting another 2 decrease every time you roll one, there are equations for it
---
Past this into chat
---
Agree. This is retail. What you do in early raids has 0 impact on later raids. It's all just reset after all. I can't wait to do dailies in phase 3 on my alts to catch up.
---
Yes, there are some similarities. It's funny to hear the Belgians say the same words but actually pronouncing them.
---
lol the whole time i thought this was an elaborate “fuck Karen” joke
---
I have a full set of caster gear for healing as a shaman while leveling.
---
Healing a dungeon and I'm using my entire mana pool with mana spring totem down keeping the 'tank' alive per pull.
---
"I can normally 2h tank this with no defensive stance easily"
---
"Well, I'm literally using full healing gear with stacked spirit and am running out of mana every pull, I don't think the problem starts with me"
---
Essentially zero overhealing.
---
Ahh, it’s just i’ve never been deep back to the original. Thank you
---
Tldr: i just pulled agro from you. You mad tank boi?
---
I mean why would she be pissed I remind her everyday how much I appreciate her , ask her how her day is , play around with her and I pay all the bills even doe she working she has a lot of financial freedom , I think it’s a win win for both of us , before we started going on I let her know what type of guy I am and if that didn’t interest then it’s ok I wasn’t gone change
---
Eh, don't charge and follow it up with 2 sunders. Easy way to rage-starve yourself.
---
Use Shield Block and it procs Revenge 100% of the time when you're hit. That's 15 Rage total, and it's more Threat/per/Rage than Sunder. If you have a Shield Spike it gets even easier to keep groups on you. For single Targets keep Revenge as your mainstay, with Sunder as just a Rage dump if you have excess and Revenge is on cooldown.
---
Stuff like this makes me sad.  I'm not even 60 yet and people walking around with gear like this.
---
Saw another priest who already had his bene.  Something inside me died.
---
Why didn't the rogue interrupt your entangling root cast.
---
It's about scale here. If you have say 200 warriors running Emperor daily, and 100 of those are below 60, then the probability that someone will get an Ironfoe when the droprate is 1% is not that low.
---
Can someone explain this other post to me?

Graves, beetles and we kill Witch Doctor Zum'rah, Hydromancer and the boss in the cave.

We can get about 4-5 runs per hour depending on if we get any nova resists or bad pulls.
---
For the love of Azeroth please use kick. I haven't had a single rogue kick one spellcast in any of my groups up to 51 so far. If there's a caster you should just be glued to it and not let it cast anything. This seems to be a really foreign concept to rogues now.

He was having a werewolf issue, right?
---
Lmfao dude, are you still pretending stamina is good for levelling? Its total dogshit compared to str/spirit, your entire post just shows how clueless you are about everything.
---
Yeah I guess in the end it all comes down to time management, there are some days I can sit and play for an extended period of time but I just seem to have way too many other things that get in the way of that happening most of the time
---
What server was this?
---
If it's your first time playing, I might recommend a PVE realm. This will allow you to maximize your playtime without dealing with random deaths at the amusement of other players.
---
As for the money, look at the bright side: $15/month is far cheaper than a single night out with friends.
---
Are you just vendoring all the Leather?
---
This. I hit 60 this morning, but I was 58 almost two weeks ago.  I did 58-60 solely on soloing devilsaurs.
---
60 mage here, lvl 45 water is indeed 20 for one click, which is fine for most people.  Once you get the lvl 55 water it's two clicks.  The reason they don't buy from a vendor is because it's much more expensive and most mages don't mind a click here or there to help someone out.  I constantly give away free water and never ask for a tip, but most insist anyway.
---
Would probably polarize the Horde-Alliance ratio even further.
---
Imagine being an alliance player finding out your faction on your server is actually 1:2. You switch/reroll to a server, which is more balanced, leaving the one you came from in an even worse state than it already was. At least, that's how the doomsday scenario plays out in my head.
---
The second baddest warlock in all of Azeroth
---
The point I was making was that a rogue or warrior should probably be getting these, but if you have a hunter along then that means it probably won't end up happening if they roll on it too and that should've been factored into his probability calculation. I wasn't suggesting that a hunter should or it belongs to them, but I guess I can see how you'd interpret it that way even if I think the hunter loot meme is so big that it should be fairly obvious. Either way, none of this matters and I hope you have a wonderful day in Azeroth today.
---
Modern engine makes a big difference :D
---
He's just checking if the blade is straight or if he should grind it a bit more.
---
I love classic but have no faith in Activision-Blizzard.  Not at all surprised they fucked that one up lmao.
---
I don't know. I have mining on an alliance character, and often find myself chasing people to the nodes. On my horde with skinning, I'm following people all over skinning the open world kills. Crossroads especially with all those hooves and beaks and stuff. I pick up a bunch of leather.
---
Leather doesn't sell for much, true, but I think I might be making up for it in bulk. Hard to say though.
---
It is very time consuming though.
---
Me and my friends used to play “water or vodka”.  Or so I believe... can’t remember the details.
---
This is shockingly accurate math.  Well done!
---
&gt; If each of us killed this guy once, both would drop for over 1000 of us.
---
1,520 of us on average.
---
It’s not that awful if you spec into single target fire then respec at 22 for frost
---
Looking at my main, about 9.5h per day since release. (The vast majority during the first two weeks where we played 17h/day). I still have stuff to do, but I've also started trying out my alt class.
---
Ahh, this will affect suicide rates in game, what have you done!
---
Didn't even need to expand the thumbnail on this one.
---
&gt; Only thing that isn't from ElvUI is the damage/threat meter :)
---
Now that i start to remember the story, i think his  dad was having a werewolf issue
---
Oh yeah. Don't tank prior to consecration. It's pretty bad hahaha
---
This only works if EVERYONE in their group loots or at minimum 'checks' their bodies for loot. This become an issue when groups spread out and bodies dont get looted. I personally try to switch it to Free for All if this is the case.
---
PvE:
---
Eventually raiding will be the only thing left that allows progress in PvE. In raids, 99% of paladins heal. So if you want to play a healer, you're good.
---
PvP:
---
Ret is an allright "solo" PvP spec, while the holy/prot hybrid build (24/27 or so) is one of the very best PvP team support/healing builds in the game.
---
Cater to retards like yourself, obviously.
---
There's a guy on Mankrik named Aytis in the guild &lt;Air Traffic Control&gt; that periodically gives weather information and notices to airmen in general chat

That's awesome. For me I always leveled in Westfall.
---
Just an FYI tanks are constantly changing targets. If your tank isn't marking targets then this may be your best bet, but if he is then you need to be attacking the one he marked to kill first, not necessarily his current target.
---
Nice one mate
---
What’s batching

Impossible, your story had a Pally ergo you can't be a troll.

Use the blood shards you can acquire from the quilboar just north of camp taurajo to purchase a thorns buff from the caged quilboar in the same town before going egg hunting.

 The tiny bugs only have 1 hp and will die everytime just from hitting you once.
---
Yeh, i can definitely see that happening. I can imaging when i get to 50s with higher drain life rank more hp and sp i probably wont need dark pact. The thing is that we are already deep in aff, I honestly dont know at this point where i can put that one point that’s better than dark pact. Any other talent i have access to right now are pretty useless.
---
Psycho wife comfirmed
---
Thank you!!!
---
I play classic but didn’t read the footnote on the chart that explains rogues were double submitted.
---
Average warlock dps is 338.32. Warlocks are 5th.
---
Average feral dps is 338.12. Ferals are 6th. 
---
You said they were 2nd worst. They are not.
---
You said there was a huge gap between top 5 and the bottom 4. There is a gap of exactly .2 dps. On average parses.
---
So. You know. Keep talking shit I guess. It’s clearly all you’re capable of.
---
First 11 points need to go into consecration. 
---
If u wanna hold aggro AOE without cons, u need retribution aura and for all melees to focus on your target. Even then, it's a crap shoot.
---
If you have points in Sword Spec I would try to prioritize having two swords. The extra swings from your off hand sword will definitely surpass the more dps that a hypnotic blade would bring.
---
But would you play with someone who have no idea about dungeons, dont know what a tank does (other than it being a warrior? Right) still have to look up DPS because that's mentioned a lot in the chat. I play a tauren druid but I dont really no if that makes me a healer. I have learned that i can become different things. But at lvl 16 i dont know if i can be used as a healer. Also it seems like a bad idea to have a really clueless healer on your team

That's good to hear, thanks!
---
With a carrion bird you basically don't need to be careful at all with pulls. Sure, your cat can take hits from two mobs for awhile and be fine, but it'll be hard pushed to do it repeatedly like I do with my bird, especially since healing it will likely pull aggro from one which won't happen if you're using screech.
---
&gt;My cat can handle 2+ mobs on it's own, and I can kite/trap a third, body tank a 4th, and worst case I can FD and reset.
---
Or, you can just have a bird take aggro from them all and keep it with Screech.
---
&gt;The AoE and reduced damage is nice but I'd rather have the clear speed on the 90%+ of other pulls, personally.
---
Being able to multishot multiple mobs being tanked by your pet without pulling aggro will give a faster clear speed, as well as being able to use Aimed Shot with little regard to threat once you get it.
---
&gt;You're losing focus to screech that could be dumped onto claw/bite/growl, while taking a lower DPS and attack speed pet; which isn't an insignificant reduction in threat gen and clear speeds for a benefit that I just find minor IMO.
---
Screech still does damage, and since growl has a cooldown you're not really dumping threat into it. I just leave screech and growl on autocast and it uses growl when available and dumps focus into screech when it isn't. Also, a cat's threat generation is going to outpace a carrion bird using screech since it does almost as much damage while also giving threat for the AP reduction effect. Oh, and Screech costing less focus than claw and therefore being used significantly more often makes up for the attack speed reduction when considering the Frenzy talent, which is the only thing that pet attack speed matters for in pve.
---
Not for everyone one mate
---
Yeah it is essential. Seems though we’ve become a bit too invested in a shitpost.
---
My favorite spots fit these categories:
---
1. Find an area less-traveled (an area that is not a common shortcut, and/or out of sight of the main road)
---
2. With beasts or skinnable humanoids (i.e. yetis) that are not part of any quest
---
3. That have a decent number and respawn time
---
For the mid-30s, my favorite spot is the Jungle Thunderers in STV.  The Mistvale Gorillas (not the elder ones, but the 32-34 ones a bit north) are also a good option.  Most people grind fangs on the elders, and the giblits only drop off the elders, so these lower level gorillas are largely ignored.  Gorilla hairs are a very efficient source of gold, I seemingly never ran out of mobs, and I could skin 'em all.  Plus, I'm getting ready to do Heart of Mokk now, and I have plenty of Gorilla Fangs.
---
Around 40, my preferred spot is in Dustwallow Marsh, on the raptors in the Southwest corner of the map.
---
Raptors and gorillas both tend to have very good vendor drops.
---
Dungeons, dungeons, dungeons. That was my method of getting through those last ten levels back in the day.
---
Scarlet* Monastery
---
Literally every single leveling spec should include 5/5 wand spec 5/5 spirit tap. Beyond that you have flexibility, but there's zero situation where you don't want both of those.
---
Shadow is very mediocre pre-44 when you get rank 4 (5? I'm not looking it up) mind flay. Wand-ing is just better since it doesn't cost mana, does about the same DPS, and lets you regen mana. I recommend going disc for leveling, then at 44 resepccing to shadow form, picking up the first 4 in wand spec and then continuing on with disc until 60. At 60, respec into whatever spec you want to play.
---
The first respecs are cheap, what's the issue?
---
Never knew Blizzard actually allowed it, pretty neat. I guess it makes sense to entice players to pay for 2 subscriptions.
---
#2 is my method. But I never pickpocket any mob unless its swinging at the tank. If a mob goes to caster Ill skip PP and try to corral it to the tank.
---
If you'd look at my flair you would see a little warlock icon ;)
---
But that's beside the point, Onyxia , according to everyones memory and the written sources I can find, should completely clear out her aggro list, which is not currently happening.
---
I don’t really see how it’s two half roles. The paladin toolkit is amazing. Knowing when to smack things and when to back off and heal swap to a sword/shield healing set is key. Going 31 ret / 13 holy/7 prot gives you access to no pushback on heals/consecrate/2 pts in bigger heals from holy and improved bop/freedom in prot . Your pvp and tier gear has int and spell damage/healing. Not denying that a full holy pally makes a better healer. But to each their own. But saying ret is terrible in pvp is just ridiculous in my eyes.
---
Leveling Feral myself.
---
I focus on Agility Strength and Stam leather gear.  Whatever gives me the highest (total bonus to all 3)
---
This lets me tank in dungeons as bear, and solo/duo fine as cat.
---
I also keep an entirely other set of gear that highest Int &gt; Spirit &gt; stam I can get in case I need to heal.
---
I keep that set in my bank and so far I haven't needed it, but I'm ready to pull it out if needed.
---
Get ready to write a ton of in game macros.
---
I'm already at 44 macros at level 35, for just my druid alone.
---
Hunters are under no delusions here in knowing they are last on the list for most melee weapons. Our go-to bis guide says things like “you won’t get this” lol. 
---
Warriors and mages are the most brain dead players in classic by a mile. Enjoy rolling against the 10 other warriors in raids.
---
Definitely see your class trainer, also learn poisons while youre at it, you'll need them if you want to dps adequately
---
Nah bud I just don't gatekeep 15 year old solved games lmao, there's dozens of us
---
Warrior is the hardest class to solo level and you’re right where the questing experience takes a jump in difficulty. Basically this normal and it going to suck for a while but you also should purposely only quest in areas where you’re at least a level higher than the mobs, it’ll make it much easier. If you want to reroll go for it, Hunter is the easiest class.
---
Yeah that's what I'm looking for, any examples in excel?
---
Get all the agi you can and you'll have an easy leveling experience.
---
That's good to hear! I was using those week one and they wouldn't trigger on half the spells I'd see being cast, so maybe I'll give them another shot.
---
I have a mage that I’ve been quest leveling for a while and I’m currently at 39. I decided on a whim to switch to an AOE grind spec ala Jokerd to level faster and potentially get more gold for my mount. I’ve watched a number of videos, read articles etc. and while I can pull 3-4 mobs without an issue I’m averaging about 17k xp/hr. I’m still working on more but every time I get above 4 mobs something resists or I do something wrong so my deaths start piling up and I feel like it’s no longer efficient.
---
For people who track that stuff- if I’m averaging 17-18k xp/hr would it better/more efficient to just switch back to my previous frost spec and just quest for leveling? I didn’t track my xp before so I don’t really have a benchmark for whether or not what I’m doing is better or just a waste of time vs. just leveling normally. Thanks!
---
That's still incredibly misleading to anyone not familiar with the game. Those are only two skills, and the people who've actually used *those* methods for significant amounts of time are probably only a tiny minority of the playerbase. 
---
For most people, 99s can and will take dozens if not hundreds of hours.
---
What's actually in your bank doesn't matter.
---
You're basing your valuation on the perceived realm average price, but you are not on an average realm.
---
Big if true. I’ve assumed that rage can only generate from damage taken. It didn’t seem like damage absorbed would count.
---
Good work.
---
It gets exponentially worse, if you're having trouble at 18 I can't even imagine how you'll feel at 50 lol
---
Eh.  
---
The flipside of that is when there arent many groups, and you actually *want* to heal as shadow, but the group already has a healer so they ask you to DPS.
---
Like...i wanted to heal, but the other guy 'called' it.
---
Bonus points when the other healer is a druid, gets leather, and then also takes the cloth.  
---
Still kinda pissed about that BRD run.  Oh well.  Hit 60 and respec'd holy, guess i dont have to run with that druid again.
---
What on earth are those keybinds? Where do you place your hand on the keyboard?
---
Hmm good point didn't think about that!
---
i left skinning at 225 until i got my mount. i never once couldn't skin something. when i trained it, i got 50 points in a level or two. Wait.
---
Is Necropile in the game? I thought scholomance won't be out untill later phases
---
This, cancel form macros are friend in vanilla. Almost all of druid abilities should have a cancel form macro. It makes you so much quicker and fluid in your actions.
---
i believe you can reload ui to "save" the macros
---
Since the agi enchants aren't out yet Dal'rends isn't even pre-bis for hunters. Peacemaker is.
---
I've seen "stop casting" mentioned, where you basically keep starting heals and cancel at the last second if the target doesn't take damage. Is that a valid technique to healing?
---
That be great! Cuz I couldn't find tiny threat plugin in !Detail. I tried Raid plugin, and it just keeps on saying "Loading Plugin" forever
---
Ty mate
---
It’s ok they sit around a table and talk about their feelings which is much more interesting than the internet.
---
so, in general the voidwalker is not a great tank if you're trying to grind quickly. I generally have been leveling by draintanking.  Because of this, the succubus/felhunter both do significantly more damage. Felhunter is great if you pull 2+ mobs, for off tanking, but succubus probably does the most damage, and the seduce is great when fighting humanoids.
---
For cloth?
---
I'm a level 52 mage and my evocation is starting to suck, as in not filling up my mana pool, just north of half. What gives?

WHY ARE YOU YELLING OH GOD

He proudly proclaimed "I knee for no one!" and it was accepted without question. :)

Dear fellow tanks,
---
&gt;\#showtooltip Shoot Gun  
---
&gt;/tm \[nomod:shift\] 8  
---
&gt;/cast Shoot Gun
---
This will mark whatever target you are LoS pulling with skull, unless you hold down shift while pressing, in which case it just shoots. While can also use this macro mid pull to move skull to the next target, as the target will be in melee range and the shoot gun command will fail. I have it bound to mouse button 4.
---
Your DPS and Healer will thank you, and you will find it a little easier to hold aggro. 
---
Sincerly Yours, fellow tank
---
Not so easy as a hunter, I dont have the time to sit in LFG chat sifting through all the groups that just want spell or melee cleave comps just to find the 1 in 200 group doing a normal regular run
---
There was a LOT of misinformation floating around back in vanilla, Shadowblade was regarded far more highly than it actually deserved, which made it pretty iconic for a lot of people.
---
It's OK because it has the dps of an epic. But that's about it.
---
Are you sure? I always thought it was ([level] / 10) + 5, but I could definitely be wrong here.
---
Anyway, you get the point. Phase two will not make the experience of playing vastly outbumbered any better.
---
Or you can set the tank as your focus target, press the 'assist' button which I believe is F by default and you will automatically target whichever mob he is targetting.
---
If you're playing as a duo, you can level as healing spec while he goes either arms or fury. Warriors are painful to level alone, but with a healer buddy they get like a 500% boost in ... everything! If you're doing that, a shaman could be an option (Windfury!).
---
Explain please
---
Ive been wanting to switch to ele from enh but idk how itll work
---
Xddddddd
---
&gt; Warriors and mages are the most brain dead players in classic by a mile. 
---
You just generalized 30-40% of the entire playerbase, and you expect a rational discussion?
---
He's held aggro well enough going against harder kills without being specced in him for me. Just takes his entire mana bar worth of taunts. I'm hoping to get drain tanking down enough that I feel comfortable with just Succ or going the imp mana battery route.
---
Can rogues open lockboxes via the trade window without actually trading them the lockbox?  I remember this functionality from years ago but a rogue was trying to convince me it wasn't possible.

---
We know.
---
Yeah that’s what I enjoy about levelling a Druid, even if I’m a feral spec we always have the ability to heal if needed. I’m at about 10 macros at level 43 but I definitely need more!
---
It's the only way to be!
---
So I'm a level 28 Shaman, and I've realized I'm poor as fuck considering I only have like 8g. Looking to increase the amount of gold I'm making. I originally took skinning/leatherworking as professions, but I think that so leatherworking hasn't really been worth it, as I have to consume a lot of the mats from skinning to level up leatherworking, and the gear that I'm able to get from leatherworking isn't worth while. Especially considering how cheap items are on the AH.
---
At this point I think I'm just going to sell the leather I skin, but I'm not sure what I should do with leatherworking. Should I keep the profession but just not level it until a much higher level? Should I replace it with another profession? If I went with something like herbalism or mining I would have to go back through newbie zones to level them up which doesn't sound appealing, though if it's worthwhile I might do it. Any recommendations or tips on what I should do are appreciated.
---
Yes the goal is to have fun!  Probably way better in wpvp as well since the Blizz build probably has very few points in shatter, if any.
---
This assumes everyone In the sub is high enough level. I bet the true likelihood of someone in the sub having this happen is much lower than 1 in 40.
---
Not at all
---
I mean do you have a UBRS group for Beast kills? Skinning is limited to that or Devilsaur farming at high levels I think.
---
Yea, we get +5 to our overall fishing skill, and Alliance get Pally buffs in raids.  Talk to me about how hard you got it.
---
Druid tanking is OP in dungeons. Also let’s warriors DPS and not contest gear with a tank so there’s a home for the poor warriors ;P
---
Not like there is much to do at 60 anyways with people steam rolling raids
---
shift+alt+z
---
He's just checking if the blade is straight. Imagine bending it without noticing. That would suck.

Probably want to explore every area +10 your final level so you dont accidentally ding later.

Exactly. This wasn't about "the classic spirit", it's about "the classic economy where noone buys any BOEs on AH".

---
I was thinking the same thing and wondering why I still got invites.
---
It isn't that hard to taunt and revenge hit mobs to keep the aggro. Sounds like you just had shitty players.
---
&gt; and can battle rez or pop innervate when I'm dying or oom
---
From what I understand, they need to pop out of bear form to perform this action?
---
I was playing a Human Rogue on Skeram, it was the worst experience I've ever had playing WoW. My hype for classic is basically dead.
---
I've always played on PvP servers, I just always played Horde. One month of Alliance is enough. The world feels inconvenient as Alliance even without a 70/30 split in favor of Horde.
---
Holy shit some people here are insane. If you claim to work 40 hours a week and also play 6+ hours a day you must be living with mommy. And not showering or making your own meals or buying your own food lol.
---
Hunter is the easiest class to level but the has a high skill ceiling at end game. If he's tempted on playing a Paladin, that would be a much more suitable choice for a new player.
---
Hmmm I don’t seem to have problem tanking as a warrior but I also don’t panic when the mage that aoes 2s in starts. For instance I can hold all the elites in strat aoe pulls while a mage is going ham provided he gives me 3s. You just taunt skull revenge x stun the last one. Back to skull taunt sunder then begin a tab sunder revenge shield bash rotation. Occasionally a rogue may pull aggro but taunt works great for holding that. I don’t pull multiple packs I’d rather not wipe.
---
It's based on your mana regen rate, which scales very poorly as you level compared to your ever increasing mana pool, so that is normal.
---
one option is to have a +spirit set of gear on you that has the most amount of spirit possible, then swap to it when out of combat to evocate. Only helps a little bit though.
---
Same here. Error 51900123. Sucks to be us.
---
That's the joke.
---
No I mean I’m at level 17... hahaha
---
Yup
---
Then make your own group if you don't want to find one.
---
I'm aware, that's why my response to "You need BoSanc for it to be viable" was "eventually".
---
You can tank just fine with consecrate and righteous fury.
---
Great turning that around, I think he knew he fucked up jumping you pretty early on but when the roots landed he was screwed. I love watching people flee for their life after an attempted gank. Such a good feeling, even better if they're like 5 levels higher than you.
---
Is it really that bad? I’m only level 30 on skeram alliance and am about to head into more contested zones. I don’t play with anyone else so I would be open to transfer.
---
Thanks for this! Did you start with a Spriest build from the beginning or did you respec? Just wondering if it’s possible to start with a Spriest build (despite the grind) or if I 100% have to start with something else.

I'm a level 60 hunter and finding groups wasnt bad but I did respec marksman at 40 so I bring the teueshit aura that may have helped me out with finding groups. It was taking me on average 8 hours per level from 50-60.
---
Well maybe it would be a bit better if you didn't contribute to the problem by ganking people while they are leveling. The guy definitely went about this wrong, but you're a douche too.
---
Not quite, Peacemaker is BiS for hunters.
---
I have the same problem
---

I found 45-60 faster than 30-45.  What class are you playing?

---
I'm not able.
---
Nope, not working atm on EU

BC I'd still support as there were changes, yes, but no "devastating" if I may say so, changes. For me WoW started to become "bad" when to much automechanisms were put into place like they started with in Wrath, it's just my opinion however and I'm more than happy that I can play "Vanilla" as Classic again. 
---
Another thing, last night my brother called me because he had this idea that maybe they add more content to the classic but keep it classic. I really liked his idea haha!
---
How would it make zero difference? Why do you think layering was implemented for the launch phase? What is your proposed solution?

I'm lvl 40 at 150 ench. So I definitely plan on doing some tanking endgame (probably at least 5 / 10 man dung) so I wanted to grab enchanting to grab smoking heart of the mountain. I know it only takes 265 and the last bit of levels are definitely the hardest, and also trade chat spamming doesn't interest me. 
---
Any thoughts on if i should keep or switch to other profs? I've been leveling skinning as it's easy and quick so LW could definitely be an option... or just full reset to alch / herb.

&gt;I mean innervate is useful
---
You said it, at least it was useful. Lacerate was a 31 point talent, a DoT that did less damage than a Rank 4 Serpent Sting, something Hunters got at level 26. And you had to be in melee range for it.

It was by far the worst 31 point talent in the game.

---
I play Alliance on Kromcrush. So far I think it feels quite balanced. I had lots of great PvP battles in Ashenvale, which traditionally is horde dominated because 3/4 horde races start near it but only night elves tend to quest there on Alliance. There were a little more horde than alliance but it was not overwhelming and I hardly ever got ganked by high lvl horde, even when by myself.
---
There was a big group of high level horde (lvl40+) that attacked Menethil Harbor a few nights ago and within about 15 minutes a group of Alliance came and wiped them out.
---
I haven't made it to the lvl 30+ zones like STV, Arathi, and Hillsbrad (only lvl 29) myself) but from what I heard both sides are very active in WPvP in those zones and it's not really overly dominated by one or the other.
---
I just get "you have been disconnected" when trying to get into my realm. Firemaw EU.

It's not a problem, you sign up for that when you join a pvp server. If you don't like it, go pve.
---
I found tanking with a 2 hander easier until about BRD, then things started hitting hard enough/coming in packs large enough to where shield felt next to necessary.   Damage goes way down, but healer appreciation goes up.
---
Grats, nice way to ding. The troll looks amazing in Valor shoulders with his flaming red hair!

Oh yeah for sure I'm 42 arms I'm mostly just wondering for end game at 60 lol

---
Framerate is great, just wondering how it'll hold up in 40 man raids, if at all. I could barely run 10 man MOP raids with more than 20 fps.
---
I had a lot of fun in the role during TBC (so not quite true vanilla, but still). I found it best when you had a dedicated DPS buddy - ideally a warrior, but rogues or mages work too - and together you become an unstoppable snowball of death. This takes full advantage of your strong single-target healing, you feel like a clutch savior, your buddy feels like a god, and when the enemy says "You fools, target the healer!" they run face-first into a plate-coated hammer of justice machine.
---
I did this ten years ago. Could you dm me the starting zone for the climb? I forget where to start!
---
Got the same issue on EU at 6:10pm
---
Good choice.  Why do it at 4am when you can do it when everyone gets home from work?
---
It was a knockback. It procced a lot too.
---
I only tested it once and I wasn't the warrior so not sure if there are other ways to gen rage passively mind you.
---
I don't play it but the aggro you get from the HoT's from casting regrowth and rejuv on yourself before every pull is massive for initial threat
---
Hunter
---
Its just that most of the zones have few quests and the quests are so scattered, there aren't really anymore go here kill this many of this quests anymore, its more like go here, take this thing to the other zone, click one thing, travel to another zone, do this other thing then turn it in for half a bar
---
So what... doesn't really have any impact. But glad you had fun :)
---
There are a couple things.
---
First, DM was deadmines before Dire Maul ever came out.  I am willing to bet the servers who used VC for deadmines were launched post Dire Maul patch.
---
Secondly no one would run "Dire Maul", it was always DM East/west/north.  This means if I see DM, I think deadmines.  If I see DM East/West/North, or some variant DME/W/N or tribute runs, I think Dire Maul.
---
Primarily the issue is going to see how old the server was.  I find it hard for people to use DM as Dire Maul if the server came from launch or pre-Dire Maul as DM didn't exist.
---
The Stratholme debate is the fun one though.

You need to do some digging (on my phone at work now but I can look into it more later) but someone found an old GatherMate_Data from prior to Cataclysm. So the files exist to update your gathermate to have all node spawns shown in gathermate.
---
So far, I’ve been using it for a week or two and it hasn’t failed me. It’s great for knowing where to look for random chests.
---
Damn right.
---
Never a pretty encounter for either side.
---
I know VW was bugged on a lot of p servers and they would hold aggro very well. Maybe you came across p server players who assumed this to be accurate? Doubt it but that’s one scenario
---
Just got in.
---
58 mage lvl 29 hunter 26 rogue lvl 5 bank
---
Yesss, similarly I listen to true crime podcasts and YouTube videos while leveling
---
Yeah but the people who do eventually get there aren’t just going to run it once and be done. I think it’s fairly accurate considering that.
---
what do you mean "release pvp"? aren't pvp servers already active?
---
Works again for me!
---
Have wiped multiple times by people spassing out and running around like a chicken with no head aftet they pulled aggro, having the mobs come near me and aoe silence/stun/shieldbash or just plane pulling mobs that do aoe dmg into me when I cany stop healing. Keep those icky mobs away from me please.
---
Some movement speed buffs definitely do stack. Such as Mithril Spurs / Carrot on a Stick / Riding Skill enchant
---
This is amazing!  I'm going to use the JainaLUL on stream and the others on discord, thank you for this &lt;3
---
Love it. The people who said it wasn't bugged can eat those words now too.
---
Run now while ya can. After dusk wood shit goes to hell. I took a vacation to play and I ended up changing my whole life cycle so I could play. I would get more XP uncontested from 4-8 am server then the 6-8 hrs then the rest of the time I played. 
---
When the kids get home from school it gets bad and then it’s worst when all the pissed off adults get home from their job.
---
What?! And use energy that could be used for sinister strike spam?! If it works against a NPC, it should work against a player!
---
Tried 4-5 times and got it. Got same message until it worked.
---
I'd just go arms, forget about prot until level 55 or so.
---
Depends on what spells you use, what talentry you have, and your current spellpower.  
---
Do you have extra crit damage? Do you already have extra crit %? Do you use blizzard (does not crit)? 
---
We need more info.
---
That would be awesome! I only tested it very briefly and wasn't looking to much in depth. Not home to test it again.
---
Ohhh that's really good to know. Thanks!
---
If you need to tell a hunter evertyime he should dismiss his pet the hinter might aswell delete  his character .
---
Do you tell me as a mage when to sheep or when to dps ? No i use my brain.
---
And i have seen idiots pull half of wailing caverns with a pet run
---
Have wiped multiple times by people spassing out and running around like a chicken with no head aftet they pulled aggro, having the mobs come near me and aoe silence/stun/shieldbash or just plane pulling mobs that do aoe dmg into me when I cant stop healing. Keep those icky mobs away from me please.
---
&gt; Even with talents it can't hold aggro for shit.
---
This is only a problem if you go all in on one target. You SHOULD be drain tanking, and your VolksWagen should be tanking a second mob with its own dots. You can even have another mob feared with dots ticking.
---
If you're pulling 2 things at a time you should be able to do several pulls before you eat and drink. 3-4 things at once means you're not draining as much so you'll probably have to eat and drink every pull. More than that is difficult.
---
1.13 Is classic. 1.13 did not exist in vanilla. There is nothing "from" 1.13. 1.13 is classic.
---
I can 10/10 give an accurate name when I’m out of work but “ripped ogre loincloth” is bound to be close.. sadly if you complete the quest you cannot dig for them anymore and can’t acquire it.. but I got 3 just while doing the quest

What about the other 57 minutes?
---
can someone help me understand some enchant procs? If I enchant a slow weapon with lifestealing I heard it procs more often, does this mean it's worth it to use it on a slow weapon too?
---
Congrats! :D
---
If he's able to tank MC then maybe it sort of negate the inherent disadvantages. No one is claiming they are crazy good but saying they are the "worst" of 3 tank classes doesn't say much.
---
How is paladin leveling? 
---
I’m a level 31 mage, never played wow before classic.
---
I mean Plaguelands is the best zones for them since all mobs are weaker to their holy magic...
---
Cookie is the end boss tho
---
As if Blizzard hasn't introduced you to layers, mechanic most profitable to grinders and completely breaking vanilla experience.
---
Fury to 45 then arms. You use a 2 hander for both specs
---
I don't know why nobody has said an owl. Owls are the best pet hands down. I don't care if you're an Orc, run your ass up to Telressil and get an owl, it's worth it.
---
Same. Or DM:N. During Vanilla and BC I never saw VC. Not once. Could have been a server thing, and my server definitely called deadmines DM.
---
The issue is there are two dungeons/instances that can be abbreviated DM. Deadmines and Dire Maul. Older players call it VC.
---
The number of times I've been healed from 70 to full after starting cannibalize is astonishing. I mean, I pretty much only run with my guild so it isn't ever an issue of us wiping, just a waste. We're chain pulling with little downtime so if I wasn't constantly tapping I'd be sitting out every other pull.
---
Happened to me yesterday xD, I even jumped, saw myself land on it, and saw it leave me to wallow in my embarrassment...
---
not relevant to you post but my hunter doesnt seem to enjoy dungeons.  sometimes too cramped forcing me into melee...why is the tank walking the mobs to me breaking my ranged attack?  so far hunter is the hardest class ive played...they say its easy, which it is if your just standing there shooting at a mob your pet has aggro on, but there seems to be alot of ways to screw up.
---
hunters shouldnt melee?  well i say hunters should melee other hunters because they probably no good at it and will get all fd up.
---
This assumes that Bleach is not Sweet Nectar. I for one welcome my bleach drinking brethren... although their numbers seem to be dwindling. 🤔
---
Very true, it's the play style I'm going for and have been practicing as I level. I suppose you only suffer as a druid if you try to win the fight too early and end up running oom. You need to react and mitigate the other players preferred strategy first.
---
Haha, I even read the description and everything before watching. I thought this could be a neat guide with a few tricks to learn.
---
You got me.
---
Focus targets aren't a thing in classic and I'm not aware of an add-on that has the ability to imitate one.
---
Also if you haven’t.. could acquire a deckhands shirt or similar rare shirt off a boss etc
---
Is the last part where you kill 3 elites in blasted lands after weakening them with the weapon you crafted? Im stuck there now :/
---
Funny thing is that shouldn’t even matter since if you’re in a group that is the right level for emp you can just walk past the hostile mobs once the bar goes red.
---
I didn’t realize any of my old friends were playing so I started a lock on launch that I’ve gotten to level 30 so far. Just yesterday I found them. Of course on a new server so I’d have to start all over. I’m so torn because I really don’t know if rerolling on their server is going to be worth it for me. Any suggestions?
---
Anyone who cares this much is probably on the spectrum. Just call it whatever the fuck you want, if you are level 18 nobody on the planet will think you are looking for dire maul
---
I'm a little late to this thread, but found it while searching google for something slightly related.
---
After playing a lot of classic now, I've come to a few conclusions about *SLOW* ranged weapon speeds.
---
Pros
---
* Synergize well will Aimed Shot
---
* Helpful for kiting
---
* Ammo conservation
---
* Big numbers
---
Cons
---
* Slow big crits consistently rip aggro from your pet/tank
---
* Feel sluggish when trying to finish a mob/player off
---
Because of the aggro issue, I find myself ***enjoying*** playing with faster ranged weapons more than slower ones, but I think it comes down to preference. Hopefully this helps!
---
Cookie
---
Thank you! Have a link?
---
The problem isn't 50-60.  It's YOU.  Or, rather, your mindset.  The "fun part of the game" isn't at 60.  If you dislike grinding and repetition, then you are going to hate 60.  Farming the same four-five dungeons over and over trying to gear up, farming your professions, farming reps; I feel like I have spent less time playing now that I'm 60 than I did while leveling.  While leveling, you can see your progress; you feel yourself getting stronger with each level.  Once you hit 60, those benchmarks become fewer and farther between.  But at the same time, those big moments, while being fewer, mean more.  So take it or leave it.
---
But stop thinking that you HAVE to get 60 in order to have fun.  Forcing yourself is just going to make the rest of the game feel like a chore.  There is plenty else to do than grind your way to max level.
---
Thats why i rolled a troll, the laugh is totally worth a stun every once in a while :)
---
Dude roll a tauren. I love seeing a big ass cow lead my party.
---
Having just got a Shaman to 40 and rolling a mage alt for some fun I can tell you 1-20 on a mage is a fucking breeeeeze, just make sure to always have pots/bandages.
---
Been leveling as Holy with Consec since the early 20s, enjoying it far more than Ret.  With the right seal twisting you can easily take 3-4 mobs your level and end with full health and full mana.
---
Ironic shitposting is still shitposting.
---
Have legit had this happen so many times while leveling.    Me and my Rogue friend clearing mobs,   random person charges in and takes the named mob we've been working towards and not only throws us a thanks, but declines the part invite so that we could all get the kill for the quest.   
---
those people get put on ignore.
---
This'll probably get buried at this point but I'm getting a ton of questions about what addons I'm using. 
---
Pretty much everything in the screenshot is ElvUI with the exception of the damage/threat meters which are from Details!
---
Damn since when did this subreddit become everyone’s personal blog?
---
It's hardly PvP when those players have the same chance of beating you as a lvl 1 critter.
---
Dude i played a mage to 70 in original and you and other mages give mages a bad name.
---
Pro life mage tip:
---
-wait for tank to gain aggro and start focusing on one target 
---
-cast a couple R1 frostbolts to stack chill
---
-cast max FB till target is dead or almost dead
---
-if not enuf time for last FB, cast Cone of cold
---
-switch targets after CoC
---
-back to FB max.
---
Rinse and repeat
---
-if at any time tank loses aggro Frost nova them immediately for him cast a FB then CoC of he gets them back.
---
- Fire blast to kill stragglers 
---
You are now a pro frost mage.
---
The End
---
I honestly never saw a rogue or warrior take a ranged upgrade over a hunter until MC with Strikers and I didn’t mind because we got the bow so easily.
---
Yeah, I have Party and guild in one window. /1 and /4 in a second.
---
What's the name of the addon, or is it "classic ignore and spam filter"?
---
My only issue with shaman tanks is how much they have to drink. On a Pserver (So maybe it’s a bit different) I had one that tanked Mara, and it just felt like I’d prefer anything else. Especially once we got to the AOE silence lizards :P
---
Should rogues be using poisons as soon as possible? 
---
I can finish the quests but I also want to be saving money for my mount at 40. I’m currently level 23
---
Why? You are able to drink in combat so you can spam ranged attacks.
---
There's a guild on Herod called Storm whose members run around Un'Goro and try to steal Devilsaur skins from people. And they're proud of it - pretty disgusting people.
---
I mean i would, just not on a Hunter :D
---
It's such an underrated zone. I love the Alliance hub, Feathermoon Stronghold. 
---
Just this big, fuck off Nelf base on it's own island.
---
Also great quest density.
---
Stalagg is very obviously horde sided just judging by the amount of horde players you see regularly, you arent getting the same experience alliance players are getting, though it is hard to feel sympathy for the opposing faction when they have a guild camping the entrance to BRD or a 5 man running through STV killing everyone in sight. They arent the only instances of pvp, but alliance will basically force you out or force you to pvp instead of leveling or whatever.
---
Team up with a DPS and do Princess runs.
---
Well yeah. The consensus is that paladins just can't tank raids. Apparently they're amazing in 10mans though
---
You need to look at what patches the things came put in during original vanilla. Then see what phase that corresponds with. Did the quest release the same patch as dire maul or honor? Then it's phase 2. Did it come out same patch as bwl? Phase 3. You're gonna have to do a little digging to figure it out.
---
Doot
---
Don't get married. It requires you to be a lot less selfish with your times. Kids all the more so. Marriage isn't for everyone.
---
This jus pisses me off lol
---
Never said terrible.
---
Aoe leveling is a lot different than level 60 gold spots. Leveling is much more well documented while gold farming is not so much
---
Cool. I’m brand new I wish I knew about that. I have a lvl 40 account and lvl 20. Wish I could play more. Sucks only being able to get on when there’s also everyone else on at the same time :/
---
It's why I don't see the point of using Siphon Life most if the time. The mobs are dead before half of the spell has ticked off. I pretty much only use it if I'm chain pulling like 4 things at once because I'm farming felcloth and a bunch of satyrs all popped up at the same time.
---
I don't imagine this is working for characters below lvl 60 lol. While there is really good stuff that could be considered BiS from quest rewards while leveling, it's probably meant for maybe 55+ once you can do most dungeons in the game.
---
Weapon damage enchants.  They can be pretty pricey though depending on how much.  If you're using a 2-handed weapons, be sure to get the correct version of the spell.
---
Bring a laptop. Hotels got WiFi and you need hardly any bandwidth. 
---
Least you can do is camp cities and make gold.
---
Cool
---
I'm a new warrior leveling up. I'm at level 22 at the moment. Pretty soon I'll start getting into dungeons more and most likely will be tanking. Here is my question:
---
I'm tanking a dungeon, I'm coming up to a pack of 3-4 mobs. What exactly is my opener and how do I gain and maintain threat on all 3-4 mobs?
---
how is that different from balancing the groups in a class so only you need the item you want?
---
Can you read my original post retard?
---
&gt; played a mage to 70 in original
---
I rest my case.
---
Paladins can do something similar against all the undead in the Plaguelands if you spec and gear for it. Consecration, Holy Shield, a shield spike, ret aura, Holy Wrath and using your blessings and seals appropriately to keep your health and mana up.
---
Sure but then you still need to shift click them to see where they are
---
Fixed now
---
Depends on what you eant to fight
---
There's a few PVP servers that should be balanced or close: 
---
1. Grobbulus - Probably most balanced server because it's OG RP pvp server, these have traditionally been the most balanced throughout wow history.
---
2. Deviate Delight - Basically a lesser populated version of Grobbulus, I think it's even Alliance majority.
---
3. Faerlina - Streamer server and Asmongold has a huge following on Alliance, should be relatively even.
---
4. Heartseeker or the newer low pop servers - I think what happened with these is that a lot of Alliance from the original classic pvp servers like Stalagg and Skeram transferred to Heartseeker or these newer ones because of the massive imbalance, so the balance on these should be even or even Alliance majority.
---
Basically agree, I built Holy down to Consec and finished the talent that buffs my heals, then went down Ret, starting with Bene, but I'm only level 48 right now, so I still have a ways to go.
---
I can speak from experience, FD/trap was buggy as shit during vanilla so don't you people want the true experience?
---
Had it confused with Dire Maul
---
I mean, what are you wanting? Here's some really basic VBA that can do it. Put the currency in A1, Gold in A2, Silver in A3, Copper in A4.
---
`Sub GoldConvert()
---
    Dim Curr As String
---
    Dim Gold, Silver, Copper
---
    Dim Results As Long
---
    Curr = ActiveSheet.Range("A1")
---
    Set Gold = ActiveSheet.Range("B1")
---
    Set Silver = ActiveSheet.Range("C1")
---
    Set Copper = ActiveSheet.Range("D1")
---
    If Curr = "Gold" Then
---
        Results = Gold + (Silver / 100) + (Copper / 10000)
---
    ElseIf Curr = "Silver" Then
---
        Results = (Gold * 100) + Silver + (Copper / 100)
---
    Else
---
        Results = (Gold * 10000) + (Silver * 100) + Copper
---
    End If
---
    Range("E1").Value = Results
---
    Range("F1").Value = Curr
---
        
---
End Sub`
---
thanks for the advice. Can you remember how to start the JinthaAlor quest line?
---
I feel like it goes a step further and the expectation is your help your faction in the world even if you don't know the circumstances of why the fight started. Even if you arrived 10 seconds after a rogue initiated what should be an easy fight for him you help the (scumbag) rogue because that's the whole point of being part of a faction. Different if it's intended to be a 1v1 and you know that beforehand but helping people who may be being ganked is preferable to ignoring them getting potentially slaughtered. That person you helped may remember you in a positive way in the future if they were the one on the receiving end of being ganked.
---
When my pre-bis is gated behind what should be a 10-30 min quest but due to bugs i have spent multiple hours trying yesterday and still don't have it, yes, that fucks with my will to play. Almost every character will be/have been doing this quest which is like 15 years since they made it, if shit is bugged for like half the attempts, yes that makes me want to unsub.
---
This is critical. If you are an edge case (want mail as a 35 shaman/hunter, or off-spec items), make it clear before you start that you want them. This will prevent groups from collapsing mid-way due to rage quits.
---
Are server transfers currently possible or do I need to reroll an entirely new character? I'm Ally on Skeram with a 47 hunter and id really hate to reroll completely..
---
She knows I play in the morning and is fine with it.
---
It wont give you more sword procs if it's faster that doesnt make sense. Only poison procs are more frequent.
---
Weapon damage enchants.  They can be pretty pricey though depending on how much damage you add.  If you're using a 2-handed weapons, be sure to get the correct version of the spell.
---
I think what he means is that a lot of people from back then are now adults. Some of us grew up, and even though we did our fair share of trolling back in the day, now enjoy helping others more.   
---
I know that I used to troll quite a bit, but now I find myself wanting to help people more (as long as they're not horde). I don't feel a sense of satisfaction after trolling like I did as a 15-16 year old, I just feel guilt. lol
---
Sus-Stalagg here, I am so glad the other sus of the world are keeping the classic spirit alive.
---
I met Suss-Stalag as well, and we've kept in touch for 40 levels
---
I’ve been looking for something like this, thanks for sharing
---
I don’t need to read every comment here to justify my opinion and it also doesn’t disprove my personal experience. 
---
Again, keep in mind my previous point regarding generalizations with small population sizes. You can say 40% but that’s like, 30 people on reddit? But I guess you can put me in your 60% statistic of disagreeing with blacklisting certain classes.
---
It seems like every spec is boring for raids tbh. I've heard fury warrior has one of the best, but even then it's still very basic. All the classes are so bare bones and without a lot of the newer proc mechanics you get some pretty boring PvE rotations.
---
Yea, if I’m pulling multiple mobs, it’ll normally tick the majority of its duration, and helps smooth out my health. Otherwise, it’s awful to use while soloing. It’s only good in pvp and fights that will last long enough for it to turn mana positive.
---
Extremely unhealthy amount of sleep you get dude
---
They're not breaking the rules. Git gud.
---
Casters casts a spells, that uses mana to damage mobs..... Please enlighten me on how hunters are not a hybrid melee/caster?
---
60% of a hunters damage (excluding pet) comes from casting spells, just cause they are called "shots" does not mean they don't use mana or take time to cast.
---
r/firstworldproblems
---
Unfortunately it seems like mages control the pace of the group these day. I’m starting to develop a dislike for the class which is unfair as only about 70 percent of them are infuriating
---
Currently sitting at a 53 priest and this is my 4th to level to 60 in the vanilla context. I always start with imp wand spec and move to spirit tap after. Early game wand spec is severely underestimated by most people. By the time you'll start having mana issues you'll be long into shadow. 
---
I personally didnt bother a mage/buy any water until the 40s. Imp wand spec &gt; spirit tap &gt; rest of shadow is so good. I can still farm about 7-10 mobs before I have to drink. MAKE SURE you update your wand whenever possible. There are several wand cheatsheets on reddit and around the internet. DO NOT underestimate your wand.
---
I'll also vouch for Benediction, the populations seem fairly close to 50/50, but you can tell by the World PvP that Horde are more gung-ho about random acts violence. (Alliance players are still aggressive but the horde has more organized kill teams trawling through STV, Hillsbrad, etc.)
---
I like helping out alliance if they're around and nice.  Any way to convey that I want you to tag the target so you get credit?
---
"Only run each dungeon once" I've ran WC at least 30 times for fang gear... never seen the belt drop once.
---
Lady anacandra is worse than hulk hogan at dropping the belt.
---
Why do so many people in this sub use this as Twitter lol
---
I haven't actually, I was offering some commentary on how people like to assume those who are more efficient, luckier, more skilled, all three, whatever the case may be, are *obviously* using exploits ;)
---
Currently levelling a resto shaman (lv19).  I just got the chest and feet pieces of the Fang armor in WC.  Is the set worth completing?
---
Should work. In SM it does
---
Your job is DPS/vendor/CC and managing your own aggro. How many people in this thread have told you that you are wrong in just thinking you can go ham on every pull? Bad mage bad.
---
Doing one thing is never the fastest way unless you find something extremely lucrative.  What has always worked for me was a mix of questing and dungeoning/dungeon quests.  Not only does it ease the monotony, but it actually gets you out in the world, and the community.  People constantly complain that retail killed the community with LFD and LFR, but even in the absence of those systems, people still refuse to interact outside of these short term groups.
---
I started using [Global Ignore List](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/global-ignore-list). Shared ignore list between characters, and it allows you to add notes, tracks how long they've been ignored and has an expiration option (so for example I ignore chat spammers for 3 days but griefers/jerks are forever).
---
Usually just rockbiter or flametounge depending on what you leveled last. Not sure after spirit weapons talent, since wf gets a huge boost from it
---
Do it on your main dps and not the tank tho.  Tank switching targets to keep agro.  If all the dps is on one target they'll usually stick to that target till dead.
---
Druid. Druid because you can fiddle around with healing instances, or bear tank, and itemization is incredibly vast. If you level that alt to 50 and decide you want to heal you can focus on that. If you want to bear tank you can. If you want to kitty dps you can.
---
Questie on it's own does not add levels to the quest log as far as I know. I looked through the options and was never able to find it.
---
Highly recommend Wide Quest Log &amp; Wide Quest Log Levels. The wider quest log lets you see a lot more quests and read the description easier and the sister addon adds the levels. Quest log is way easier to use with them in my opinion.
---
It is how it should be done. It's more efficient mana vs damage to aoe 3 or more mobs as a mage. Why burn through  whole mana pool just single targeting 4 or 5 mobs? When you can aoe them down in 2 or 3 spells. If tank loses aggro mage can just kite em anyways . If you're micro cc'ing trash mobs that is indeed a harder way to play
---
Agreed. I took time off when it first came off, otherwise I'd be in exactly the same position. I can only do about 1.5-2.5 hours a nigh on the nights I play, so it happened in chunks.
---
Just wait until Phase 2 rolls around and we still have layering!
---
I don't see how they can get it done. Even if half the people on these megaservers quit before then that's still 25K people all trying to play together at times. Even if Blizz doubles the Vanilla cap and lets 6,000 in on an unlayered server that's a huge queue the rest have to eat. 2/3 or more of the population would be locked out of playing during prime time. 
---
Just shrugging and offering free transfers off and ignoring that many will just quit instead is a baller move. I just don't see it happening. Blizzard likes to punt.
---
you won internet for today
---
Heal priority:
---
Tank &gt; Yourself &gt; Melee DPS &gt; Ranged DPS &gt; Hunter's Pet &gt; Warlock who uses Life Tap constantly
---
All purpose of it is to show at any lvl but I don't mind
---
Kinda hard to shut them down when many are hosted in countries that don’t follow copyright law.
---
It's just about the same phenomenon, unfortunately. Strong personalities tend to attract people like this, and it's much, much easier to have a strong personality like this if it's a negative one. Because it's much easier to noticably affect people negatively (trolling, being rude/hurtful, taking) than positively (helping, being polite). There are some people out there who have their own cults of personality because of their positive affectation, but it's substantially less common.
---
Alliance really are the good guys. And the Horde could also claim to be good if they weren't allied with the Forsaken.
---
Well, you have a server with tons of players in one faction who are really invested, have tons of friends on the server etc. 
---
Enforcing a faction cap would splinter that group. 
---
So you’d be forcing people to either wait for hours to play every night/not be able to play when they want to, or swap to a different server without their friends. 
---
A coordinated swap is really rough and doesnt work. Like sure, you might get a guild transferring 80-90% of their players, but you’ll have friends in another guild that isn’t swapping that you’re now leaving behind. 
---
So you’re breaking up guilds and friend groups for the sake of faction balance. 
---
Now, if you had this available at the start then it would be fine. 
---
But now, people have hours and hours and hours invested into their characters and hours and hours and hours of developed relationships. And you’d have to throw a lot of that away to balance the factions.
---
I’d make a comparison to retail, where there is cross-realm everything. Cross-realm dungeons and raids and arena. 
---
Cross-realm has been out for a while and I have a ton of people I play regularly with that aren’t on my realm. I often raid with a friend’s guild on another server. I do mythic+ with people on another server. I pug tons of content elsewhere, etc. 
---
Now, many people want server communities back. And there’s a good argument for it. Outside of mythic raiding there isn’t really a server community. 
---
But to take away cross-realm would be to take away more than half of the people that I regularly play the game with. For me, removing it would ruin the game. 
---
It’s sort of like Pandora’s box where once it’s been opened, it can’t be closed. Once a server is released and people build their characters and make friends and form communities, you can’t just come in and break it apart to say ‘it would be better if this didn’t exist.’ 
---
The concept of a faction-capped server is cool, but if they did it it would have to be by opening up a new one and allowing transfers.
---
Depends on the time of day too. 2h weapons in lvl 60 dungeons vendor for 5g and may potentially be worth 2-6g depending on the hour and if you get extra good RNG on the DE. But it’s probably better to vendor most things
---
So this is what a 1v1 fight looks like
---
You dont work every single day of the week, kids and spouse can and should help with house chores and things like that. I'm not saying it's not difficult to find time for other things like games or other hobbies, but it isn't impossible. Days off from work should be easy to get maybe an hour or two in. And by the sounds of OP's post, he does have time to do this stuff, considering he goes to work 3 and a half hours early just to play WoW. I think the big problem here is his wife seems like a control freak. Theres no reason he shouldn't be able to just do that at home
---
it does not
---
Ummmm, yeah I guess?  I'm just making the point that it seems like everyone is frugal.  Even blue BOE's sometimes you can almost argue vendoring them is the fiscally better move because you eliminate the 75s or so you risk everytime you list it on AH and it doesn't sell.  I guess it's just cause it's early on and everyone saving for mount.  Be man, with how rare these items are with a .001% drop rate yet I can barely sell it for what I could make in an hour or two of gold farming.
---
Even with a quest tracker I'm still reading up on quests to figure out what the hell I'm supposed to do :D
---
classic wowhead has a column for the phase in which they think it will drop, and I assume at this point it's pretty nailed down since we should have seen everything that can drop in p1.
---
Yea if it’s selling for a few silver more  then vendor price + AH there’s just no point. Dose making it into bandages make it worth more?
---
Leveling you just stack int and crit. Someone explained it to me like this- you need a ton of spell power to kill the mob with 1 less frostbolt, but if you stack int you have a chance at a crit and you have more mana to cast more frostbolts. When you start getting to 60 there is a point where there is enough gear with spell power that it is feasible to kill mobs with 1 less frost bolt. 
---
For pvp hit&gt;stam=int&gt;crit
---
Leveling= hit&gt;int=crit
---
60 pve= hit&gt;crit&gt;sp&gt;int
---
For myself Cold Blood/Hemo builds have been the most fun for me.
---
That's not true though, if the threat reduction was all that hot shamans would be dropping Tranquil Air Totem over Windfury.
---
I wouldn't say either of them is better because they both fulfill different roles - paladin is better MT healer, shaman is better raid healer. Paladin helps casters more, shaman helps melee more. In PvE they're probs about even.
---
It really depends on a quest, for some reason.
---
Or just don’t mix up gold and silver next time.
---
I know. Shame on all those horde for leveling a character to 60 and hoping to have some fun world PvP experiences.
---
Faction imbalance sucks for everyone.
---
Damn I never realized how salty this community is about aoe mage farming
---
Left last night after getting killed while questing 6 times in an hour. HeartSeeker is the place to be.
---
Parts of it are, but it still uses the original models and textures.
---
Yeah... the classic setting is like setting 3/10 on that slider bar.
---
For pvp for sure.  I don't use them often lvling, but nice to have later for the root(run?)/bandage to keep your mana gen going.
---
What class are you running?
---
A rogue/warrior/pally/shammy/hunter w.e with a fiery enchanted weapon or even just weapons always on curve(ie you meet the min level req) can rush through content quite quickly.  If you're a caster it's tougher, and wands and +spellpower enchants are about as good as it gets.
---
Stick your dick in crazy all you want, just make sure you pull out.
---
I don’t recommend going to ungoro at 51. You’ll have a bad time unless you’re hunter or lock. I went at 54 as a warrior and it was still annoying.
---
Mmm so Deviate Delight is the Chicago version of Grobbulus, is there some way to know how less populated its compared to Grobbulus?
---
No, it'll take more time to get the other set pieces than it would to hit level 24 and get gear from SFK that is better.
---
There's a random patrol of 4 lvl 60 elites that can kill him if they add while he's fighting other stuff. The normal part of the quest he can solo easy.
---
Been a feature of auctioneer for as long as I can remember. Without the botting aspect of course.
---
I'm not digging the 5 points in Imp. Drain Life.  10% extra healing from DL at my level (45) gives me an extra ~5 life per tick, or an extra 25 life per DL.  I'd rather throw all 5 points into Demonic Embrace and have 15% higher stamina on a PvP server, personally.
---
"Being better than someone who is bad does not always make you good" - Faker
---
druids were OP as heck in BC! (maybe not balance unless you did that restokin build for arena)
---
you had me tilted til that last line. Good job sir, you have bested me
---
Good god no. I didn’t go til 54 and it was still a pain.
---
I mean you have to go with a drain life/fel concentration/demo spec. Aside from the respec fee.. you ultimately save gold.
---
Yeah there are improvements, such as actual grass on an otherwise boring texture of grass.
---
Whats "P3"?
---
Mostly want to do world pvp, probably daggers, but thinking of swords also.
---
depends how fast you lvl
---
There is an auction house sniper tab for the tsm addon
---
I'd say it depends on how long it takes you to find those nodes.
---
I might swap out herbs for mining, though. If I can pick up the occasional node, great.
---
I use SUF also, I just set it right below the target frame, not too much different.
---
Do you use swords for that build?
---
I will support this just because I hate rogues in 1v1 as a shaman
---
Dear Warriors. Mana is a thing. Please don't run in like a.. warrior and wait for other people.
---
I'm sure every healer has had a warrior who dared complaining he didn't get healed after running in without waiting for his healer to get mana so he wouldn't die :D  
---
And yes, warriors are used to moving before their rage is gone, but you're in a dungeon. Plenty mobs to get hit from.
---
It's *possible* for him to die, but it's very unlikely.  One of my guildies had him die, but everyone else that did it didn't have to help.  You may want to step in if it's starting to look particularly hairy.
---
can mages solo?
---
Also we have WAY better computers then we did 15 years ago hahah
---
Looks like you’re an alliance Druid. 🤷🏾‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤔
---
Dreadmist EU?
---
Don't flatter yourself.
---
Came to say this. If you make 300m grinding 99 slayer and blow 100+ of it on 99 slayer in 4 hours that’s still 99 fletching in 4 hours. There’s a difference between buyable and non-buyable skills
---
He has two windows, one is with the TinyThreat plugin, other is damage done. With ElvUI if you download addon skins you can do dual embed (probably what is shown here).
---
theyd stop gettin ddos if they just added random dungeon finder. its so awful without one. having to wait for a group is horrible. im unsubbing.
---
Roll pally and bubble out of that shit lmfao
---
I went Horde on Skeram because my friends suggested it. I don’t ever PvP, but this is still disheartening. I didn’t mean to pick the winning side, I just wanted to play Shaman with my friends. I hope people don’t leave, I don’t like that.
---
Looks awesome!
---
Ahh yes the classic "If you don't like it." That's not an argument
---
Are you me? I'm doing this exact same thing.
---
Play both. Alternate between 2 mains
---
Warriors have fine aoe threat if they know how to play. Dps just cant rip off multi shots and w.e while the pull is happening. That doesn't change with druids and pallys lol.
---
We already see people complaining about not enough tanks, I'd recommend encouraging more people to tank, instead of telling them to go DPS.
---
This made me so happy to learn dkc is my favorite game series right now to wow
---
Thats so weird. When I do "crop icons" on, then off, then on again, it has the same look as yours. But then when I turn it off and on again, it goes back to the way I had it. Something is fucky, but it seems to be working haha.
---
Thanks man.
---
Vc, dm is dire maul
---
I mean, you shouldn't be wiping in these low level dungeons anyway, but if you don't SS your healer without having to be asked, then I seriously question your judgement.
---
Like, you realize your saving a lot of your own time too if you wipe, right?
---
Blessing of freedom
---
Which auction addon is that?
---
Awe poor hordling forgot he was alone lol
---
The problem was I am dumb. After you talk to the artisan blacksmith in IF and tell him you want to specialize in armorsmithing he actually spawns a dwarf behind you that doesn’t not actually have a quest but you are able to talk to and he will send you over to the actual armorsmithing trainer over by the anvil. After I read the original chat text with the artisan blacksmithing trainer I realized the name of the dwarf he told me to talk to was not the one I thought I was suppose to be talking to and that’s when I realized that he spawned that other dwarf behind you. Hope this helps and you just missed it like I did.
---
Impervious Giant and Manual Crowd Pummeler are some good threat options
---
Can you not, I already feel bad not for being 60 yet I don't have as much time as I did at Uni!
---
That is the dumbest thing I have seen you say in this thread. Here let me blast EVERY mob with an AoE and if the tank can't hold aggro on them right away then they are bad. Not how it worked in vanilla and it's not how it works in classic.
---
A rogue isn't gonna beat a good feral druid
---
Sounds like the issue is less the ganking, but more that people aren’t coming to your aid and wPVP doesn’t escalate beyond banks?
---
I played Vanilla, sorry bud speaking to the wrong person. And nah, it wasn't like that
---
I think they use the wotlk client but limit content to 60, but this way they can just copy new instances by using old ones from newer expacs. (Like implementing a 60 version of kara)
---
If you set it to max yes, it uses improved foliage density, god rays, water reflections, better shadows and all other sorts of graphical upgrades that retail has. However it still uses the old character models and mostly the old textures. If you set the quality to 3/10 then it should be what classic looked like as this is even called classic setting in the graphic options.
---
I was assuming that Herod had around 22K in the queue at max. I was only using outdated data from the now broken census addons to see that there are PvE realms with twice as many characters and estimating accordingly. 
---
But please do take my figures with a grain of salt. It's only a rough guess. But if it's anywhere close to accurate this is a huge issue for Blizzard.
---
Yes, which is why I caught and killed him. Still not worth the investment.
---
By definition Bernoulli trials are independent...
---
I mean it is a dick move, but I wouldn't cause a fuss over it, I'd just keep fishing cause fishing is chill.
---
Is it only damaging spells?
---
That's most likely where our difference in point of view comes from. It's a bit hard to tell on a second reading of the OP. Could go one way or another. The line where she says "dont go driving off to play games" or whatever is what made me think she isnt allowing him to do what he wants in his free time. Given the fact OP has gotten rid of most modern technology, it really just begs the question of "why?" This really just is a very strange post
---
50-60 is awesome, 40-50 is the crappy part
---
I’m not the biggest fan of 1k needles as a whole. I’ll probably quest there on my shaman just to mix it up but i skipped it on my warrior
---
Hi, /u/asheykalamas

---
"The usual" Fuck off man. Ya two bis items just the usual
---
Nope for me it doesn’t loot, it just picks the lock! maybe it’s a problem of one of your addons or it’s one of my addons that permits Autoloot in that case (ofc i have AL enabled).
---
If you don’t find a good solution: jumping when the Castbar is nearly done stops you from looting (which worked perfectly fine everytime i did it that way, before I found out  „Pick lock“ works fine)
---
Huh
---
Fifteen years ago I could average 4 hours a day playing, all while being on a high school lacrosse team and maintaining a 3.5gpa but now?  Average maybe 25 minutes?  With a job, long commute, wife, kids, and a mortgage?  Just different.  All good.  Either way I'm having fun again!  Now I can sort of figure out how long it'll take to reach 60
---
Do dungeons to 60 starting around 52. The xp is ridiculous.
---
I think you've missed the point.
---
And I don't have any issue with that. They have the ability to get a group instantly so they can choose anything they want. Other people have pointed out though, it's just a different way to go about reserving loot. One has a scummy stigma to it while the other is accepted, but they are both the same thing in the end.
---
The answer is: healer.
---
My friend you are misinformed
---
So i dont get anyone to blame as a DPS.
---
Idk how i feel about this i need a scapegoat to blame for me aoe pulling the entire dungeon.
---
That's why I liked the old battlegroup system to help combat faction imbalance. WPVP is still going to suck but at least you're not sitting in a 3 hour queue to get into a losing AV.
---
Was talking about the extra attack
---
My apologies, I had read it like you were arguing from the other side.  Yes, totallly agree with you.  Everyone who can use as BIS should roll Need if they dont have it already.
---
Griefers and their antethesis the PvP tourists who don't like fighting will leave, I think you are right about that. Hopefully after that there will be enough from each faction left to have actual healthy servers, my worry right now is the transfers are taking all the long term players and guilds from the factions and putting them on separate islands. Hopefully I am wrong.
---
I'll open with Ambush and use a macro to switch back to a mainhand sword after opening.
---
As of now that does not work at all for me. Putting in these command does not change anything.
---
Classic is based on a variation of Legion client, not vanilla, so that’s a huge contributing factor to the way the environment looks.
---
This entire post is pasta and this guy is trolling you.
---
Because of faction imbalance on Kromcrush I had to transfer to Earthfury and am loving the decision to. I could not quest in contested zones on Kromcrush, and when I brought up the problem on forums people would just say "You're on a pvp server/There's no faction imbalance/its one of the more balanaced servers" which was completely false and wrong. 
---
I will get to the final straw of me transferring. On a Wednesday night I was ganked 8 seperate times in 2 hours. Thursday night 10 separate times in 2 hours. Friday started the same way, being ganked every 10-15 minutes by 2-3 horde, but the final straw was I was ganked 3 times in a row by the same two horde, but the final third time I was right beside another alliance player who refused to help me, and the horde just danced around us while killing me. 
---
I initially had the same "I'm going to stick it out screw the horde" mentality, but transferring to Earthfury was the best decision I've made in classic.
---
I wish I had a guild that played. Every one I join is like 5 high rank people and a bunch of low-bies.
---
:sadface:
---
Thanks it worked!
---
4 months is optimistic, probably more like a year. I think people are expectingupdates far too fast, only the most hard core players are even 60 and clearing mc/ony. People are expecting rapid updates and think we will have all phases in like a year. They got to keep people subbing with limited content, no way they launching new phases that fast.
---
And almost useless. Mighty Trolls Blood is about the only use, but I ended up vendoring so much Kingsblood and just ignored it as soon as it became green to gather. Just wasn't worth the time and bag space to hope for a skill up.
---
Lmao it's one month in dude. Very few people were able to no life their way to 60. Your looking at the top 1%. I will say, if your guild is a dedicated raiding guild, dont leave. Put in your time to 60. Get your BIS gear and key for UBRS, and start to request into MC to pick up the gear(say everyone already has the t1 bracers or whatever, you'll get them). Additionally, they should be split farming Ony so that's a free t2 helm right there. You can grind out Waterlord rep by sitting in on those mc runs and that's going to be useful, but mainly, by sticking with your guild for the long haul, this shows that you are invested in them. Invest in your guild and they will invest in you. I never get upset when I lose a roll in MC. I just think to myself, that's one less person I have to roll against :) happened last night with the t1 belt. Ended up getting the bracers because the other priests all won something. So like I said, I invested in my guild by giving them time and effort, and they have started to invest in me. KAPEESH?
---
Can give away free gold to randoms but refuses to go with a spec that’s not absolutely best for his dungeon. Lmao you expect someone good, to be a holy spec before 40/50? 
---
I’ve leveled a shadow priest twice and I literally keep my mana up with the other casters as well. After ZF around lvl 50 it’s def nice to have a more solid healer as it is for ANY OTHER CLASS, but just last night...... I healed for BRD as a holy priest and what a JOKE! Would have been faster if I aoe healed in shadow form. we had a 60 warrior who just refused to take damage and I was stuck wanding/ telling myself I should have stayed shadow cause this is too easy.
---
if you only drink 3 times a dungeon you're lazy. throw some DPS on the mobs. Obviously no one taking damage I'll drink usually every other pull sometimes every 3. But I tell my tank to grab the next pack as i drink to lessen downtime.
---
Just wanted to chime and and make sure you know you don't have to actually "buy" the game.  You can activate an account for the price of 1 month of playtime.  It would be a shame for you to blow 60 bucks for BfA only to find out you could have gotten everything you needed for 30 days of classic for 15 bucks.
---
Dollar per hour, it's one of the cheapest forms of entertainment, and is only beat by things like paying for a library card and reading books from your local library, or going for a scenic walk.  Playing classic costs me about 10 cents per hour of actual play time (your experience will vary widely by how much or how little you play).
---
I was trying to recruit alliance to kill him but couldn't get him and an alliance in close enough range for me to signal
---
I'm still mad they changed whatever they changed so that it won't run on my iMac. Missed the cutoff by 1 year. Why do I need a new computer to play a game that is 15 years old?! 
---
The game came out before my computer did! But I can't play it.
---
After they nerfed it it should be kept up only to keep the attack power debuff on the enemies. Battle shout now provides more initial aoe threat of it hits the entire party.
---
or a wedding dress with the rock lol
---
That's not true anymore, Heartseeker's more populated than Earthfury ( I think ), and Earthfury has several Ony/MC raids running. I know of several guilds that are running MC atm on EF horde and there's plenty of 60s LFG for various dungeons. The population has been growing a ton. It might not be as high but I think people are blowing the low-pop thing out of proportion.
---
Hold shift and click their name!
---
Except Every Man was nerfed fairly quickly when it got bad, but it took until the 7th freaking xpac for Torrent to get nerfed (and it was a HUGE advantage in Legion).
---
The other side of that is that pvp has always been a smaller portion of the community, especially 'serious' pvp.  Pve stuff being broken caused much more of an exodus.
---
Only on some fights and it's no where near 30% of the damage lol
---
No... the probability does NOT change.  The probability of rolling 100 is always 1/100 no matter what you have rolled previously.  Rolling two hundreds in a row is obviously lower than rolling just one hundred, but it has the same probability of any other specific two number sequence.
---
Shaman here.  Really helpful when tanks recognize where my totems are and keeps everything in range.  It's annoying when I have to replace my totems for no other reason than the tank not realizing if he moves 3 feet to the left they'd be in range.  
---
I understand it's also my job to put the totems in the correct position in the first place, but i'm talking about situations where it requires little to no effort to get back in range or when the tank kites the mobs so everything's out of range.
---
It's not stopping anyone from making huge assumptions about the OP. This is the internet! Our own small lens is the only truth!
---
I actually prefer the retail travel form. A majestic stag is more suited to the Northern Nelf forests while a cheetah is perfect for our horde druid brethren on the great savannah plains.
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Zones_by_level
---
This should give you a rough idea of what zones are for what level range too.
---
Heals also factor in armor because that armor mitigated the damage that needed to be healed.  When is PW:S ever more efficient than healing?
---
Mark stuff yourself. Mention in group "kill the skull"
---
This is a normal feature. It’s the heartbeat system. 
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Heartbeat_Resistance
---
I don’t have a link with more information on exactly how it works unfortunately, but basically every few seconds the game does a resistance check and there’s a chance for the cc to break early.
---
The good thing about daggers is your burst. it's useful in pvp, but also in PVE because you can take out that errant wizard/cleric mob. In many pugs the other brain dead DPS is out there attacking non-important targets. 
---
It also makes me feel more active, backstab positioning, and timing the correct ending move (kill, bleed on boss mobs, or stun for runners or stuff that agroed the priest).
---
But do the quest turn ins suffer the same diminishing returns that they do while leveling?  For example, if we are doing lower level quests, are we getting “gray” experience that converts to gold?
---
I speak for all tanks when I say that we hate you and will never run with you in the group. Cheers.

I love these forums as much as I love being with my friends in WoW. They bring back so many memories.  
---
This reminds me of Nefarian P2 in Cata, with the lava and interrupts.
---
By this time, ret paladins had a proper 6-second CD interrupt. I was also a Blood Elf, so had Arcane Torrent.
---
Between communication between me, my BFF (the Rogue), and the enh Shaman (also a good friend), and my multiple backup options, nothing got cast.

I hardly ever use the 5 key, it's too far of a stretch and my finger ends up getting lost 😅

and this site too https://classicwow.live/
---
Correct. Just did this.
---
Seems to be related to AOE on nearby critters, kill the snakes.
---
Thanks for the inspiration :)
---
This has nothing to do with that, I joined a random server with no bias based on friends or anything, and it just happened to be a server that had no queues, but also has a skewed ratio. 
---
It was pre-launch, so how would anyone have any idea what the result would have been?
---
Same boat, alliance has huge guilds and 2x the lv 60's, while our side has a bunch of guilds with lv 45's, and only a small pocket of players actually trying to do UBRS/Tier 1 raids.
---
Ya which is perfect for mob grinding for me. I see similar exp between that and questing in a populated area
---
A fairly old and pretty weak one by modern standards. But it's good enough for classic WoW. :p
---
Yeah that makes a lot of sense. My concerns aren’t related to getting gear per se, but more related to raid utility. I want to tank raid bosses. I guess it just seems difficult to get a tank spot when those guild positions were filled before the game even launched due to being friends/retail guilds.
---
Helps with storage space primarily.
---
You can park a character in your city of choice then have your main character send all the items you want to keep to your bank alt via the mailbox.
---
Mail sits in the mailbox for 30 days, as well, so it's essentially free storage while your bank alt sorts and sells the items it receives.
---
Second comment. Learn to count, idiot.
---
That would be true for a Nightfall hunter. Wich is their guilds duty to gear him firstplace
---
I don't know why...but this video made me REALLY want to play WotLK boomkin again.  Those wraths coming in hot probably did it.
---
YOU don’t need to train mind numbing or deadly poison but instant and crippling are needed and instant will greatly help your dps
---
Or just a mana efficient, consistent dps melee attack without a 20 second CD that'd be wonderful.
---
1. I want to say charge should be your opener but I say that with real caution. You don’t want to charge all the time, because at times it can agro too many mobs. Instead, use charge selectively when you know you have 3-4 mobs isolated. After charge, I will usually proceed with demoralizing shout, sunder armor and overpower if available. When I’ve accumulated lots of rage (40+) I’ll throw in a heroic strike or cleave. Finally, use execute when possible. 
---
2. Always keep battle shout up. It creates lots of threat. Also, make sure you are always in defensive stance as you take less damage and generate more threat 10% more threat. Only switch to battle stance when your specific attack requires it. I would highly recommend setting up macros to include the battle stance change into certain attacks like charge and defensive stance into others. 
---
3. Finally, use taunt. This attack is great because most of the time, it will focus enemies within melee range on me instead of anyone else. But remember, it does nothing if the target is already targeting you. I would recommend building defensive stance into the taunt macro as well.
---
A geared rogue can solo it. I doubt anyone has the gear required at this stage though.
---
A simple solution to this is to not run a tank and to bring 2 locks 2 mages and a shaman and let the dps go ham with the aoe and cc
---
Playing the wrong game dude
---
It's the latter, pretty hyperbolic statement that is purely anecdotal.  Of course everyone has different experiences, but to avoid a class entirely because of whispers makes me suspect they don't enjoy the social aspect of the game as much as the next guy.
---
The Felhunter is really good at fighting spellcasters. He has an interrupt, and an offensive/defensive dispel that you can use to dispel enemy buffs or remove negative ones from yourself.
---
Yeah, it’s pretty efficient. It just feels really slow to me until 40. But maybe it’s cause my gear was okay at best.
---
wtf
---
Come to HS. I left Stalagg as a Horde because of the shitty Horde/Alliance balance and the world PvP is way better here. And in regards to MC (while there are groups doing it/Ony), who cares? It's the first month anyways, no need to get stuck in raid log purgatory already!
---
You shouldn't be auto attacking like melee characters, you can melee auto attack as a mage, warlock or priest but that sure as fuck don't make them a melee character in any form. I can equip swords and daggers as a mage but that doesn't make me a rogue or melee DPS. 
---
Hunters abilities are built around ranged DPS, kiting and control. Melee shouldn't be on the table unless you absolutely have to. 
---
I raided as a hunter in vanilla and never once have I ever heard anyone refer to hunters as "hybrid" classes. Hybrid classes are Paladins, Shaman, Druids, and debatable ones are Warrior and Priest. All hunters do is DPS, that's it.
---
Dire maul
---
No one? All of the pvp servers are horde dominated. What was the point of that infographic? Yeah there are ally heavy servers. They're pve.
---
Hi,  
---
Ele shaman here.  
---
War stomp - 2 seconds  
---
Chain Lightning - 1.5 seconds (we got 1 sec cast time reduction for CL and LB in talents which all ele shamans take).
---
Its 100% a layering issue as the A:H ratio is probably closer to 25:75 post-exodus. There are so much more horde than alliance on Skeram that there are almost certainly layers with just horde running about.
---
Too bad, if it was Herod I'd have gladly hunted him down and killed him.
---
Nice assumption, but I specifically got peacemaker from strat undead so I didnt have to roll against melee dps that need DalRend more.
---

Auction faster

Typical hunter crying about not getting gear when hunters roll on everything including melee weapons so they can have a stat stick they'll never utilize.
---
How is that going to work with quests?
---
Bug? That's no bug. How're you gonna crit a bubble? Look for the thinnest layer on the bubble?! #nochanges #priestmain
---
There is an addon called auctioneer. It is totally worth getting. 
---
It will "appraise" items for you and recommend what you post them for. You literally only have to hit one button "post item". This avoids you having to type in an amount, or selling too low, etc. It really is a god send. try it
---
Bluto saw an opportunity to make friend. Bluto try be nice and not strange. Bluto smash with friend.

Sigh, your using simple probability, but that’s why there are classes and you can even go online and see that is not how world works, I gave you equation already don’t know what else to do...

Ty is there a addon that shows what the item is going for in the AH cause I know somethings are better off vendoring

Troll shadow priest cast shadow word:train. Choo choo motherfucker. -you have been kicked from group-

My life is actually pretty great random internet person. I'm building a giant lego castle that covers my entire table that can be used as a DND board. Also, my kids bring a lot of joy, my wife is my best friend, and work is meaningful and interesting.
---
Disagreeing with someone politically doesn't make them a racist.
---
I like to get a quick nod off before I clock in for the day.
---
Two reasons.
---
1. You mail all your items to the bank alt so that your main can focus their bag space on important things. Super useful when you are not close to a city.
---
2. When you sell items of value or undercut other people, they only harass you on your bank alt so nobody knows your main and you cannot get griefed.
---
Wait until someone's oom?  That's a gank
---
Wait until someone's at 5% health? That's a gank
---
Wait until you have 2 people with you?  That's a gank
---
Someone 20 levels below you?  That's a gank
---
But you are right I don't think this is a gank at all this is just a guy pvpin.
---
Can you only switch if you’re literally in a que? I’m terrified now that I won’t see a que again because all the alliance have now basically left...
---
It’s included in !Details. Just a checkbox somewhere in the options.
---
Speak for yourself
---
Only the jacket. Pants and shirt can be worn at any level.
---
Because you lose control of your character when under MC.
---
Ouch but at the same time, there's no way I'd pass rolling on my BiS even if I was still a level away from equipping it, unless the other person is a guildmate or friend I play with.
---
Rogue! Fiery enchant would be a great idea.
---
None of those enchants you listed are rare.. think about it, it took you a day and half to get it up there, most other enchanters are in the same boat trying to get theirs leveled up as well.
---
Maybe once you hit 265 for Fiery?
---
Also how best to market +2% Shield Blocking when the server is a bit behind in progression?
---
/global is non player owned tho r?  Just use this instead maybe
---
But that's assuming that you have downtime in the first place, which with a hunter you shouldn't have; you're also missing out on fewer frenzy procs from the faster attack speed of the pet, and better pushback on caster creeps. Plus, claw does more damage than screech, not the same; and with screech, bite, and growl all on auto you'll focus deplete. Learning claw on top of those three is wasted TP because you'll never have the focus to be using all 4 effectively.
---
I see the advantage of screech; I just don't think it outweighs the benefits of faster attack, better damage modifiers, and better damage/focus abilities. It's survivability vs. clear speed, and I've never struggled with survivability as a BM hunter with a cat.
---
Skeram was 35% Ally, and Stalagg was 33% Ally, on the same census.
---
DM = Dire Maul
---
dm = Deadmines
---
Just use capitalization! Is this a BIG instance or a little one?
---
Happened to me aswell can pick server but then get disconnected while trying to log in
---
Tank/DPS here, is anyone else developing a bias against Druid healers?  Specifically when there's not a Paladin or Priest in the group, the lack of a casual resurrection has caused a lot of time to be wasted.  I don't care they Feral tank/DPS or even play something as meh as Balance, but having them be the main healer / only res is proving to be a big handicap
---
Congrats on your recovery. Keep on keeping on! My parents were never much into gaming, either, but I remember as teens my siblings and I getting our mom to play Pokemon Stadium minigames with us. :')

Back in 2006 it was Naga Explorer 5 though.

My god man!
---
You gave me an idea on how to get Mages to use spells other than Blizzard.
---
Put a PSA on PornHub, maybe slap a hot Belf mage on it to get attention.
---
I had the same issue, seems like it's just broken. I did find this here the other day though, a one button fishing macro that will equip your rod if not already equipped, apply a lure if not already applied, and cast out the line: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d877u8/i_made_a_true_onebutton_fishing_macro_thought_id/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link
---
Personally I see the biggest benefit in just mailing all of my cloth to them. You get so much of that stuff and it's so useful you don't want to vendor it. Every day I mail like 4 stacks to my bank and he just puts them in his bank. I also mail my gems from mining. Generally they are useless while leveling up BSing but I want them for when I want to craft specific items.
---
Is that boss already out in Classic? Because if so I'll farm him nonstop until I get a Kodo.
---
True, I read melee as combat. Woops
---
I mean I have to spend like, *30* mana and it disappoints my bear. It's kind of a hassle.
---
Mages can solo any mob that can be slowed, so yes.
---
&gt; You make it sound like you don't like the game. 
---
Nope, quite the opposite! That's why I made a point to include: 
---
&gt;At the end of the day Classic WoW is 100% about the grind no matter what  level or stage of the game you're at. **I don't say that as a bad thing  because I personally love it.**  
---
I'm just trying to clarify to OP what the game is actually about to make sure to manage expectations.
---
yea of course, mainly just for the armor and block. Also the added benefit of not having one of your mages leave because "tank isnt even using a shield".
---
Been there done that.
---
Yes, everything everyone posts about a subjective matter is their opinion.
---
Oh fuck dude, a few clicks? Won’t somebody think of the mages
---
https://youtu.be/XQwH0atQZ0Q
---
Can confirm, bought Gloves of Holy Might for 49s instead of 49 gold.
---
I'm totally familiar with the first 4.  Everyone, at least, should be familiar with the first 2.    I've never seen the last 4 used as you've indicated.
---
thanks!
---
I can assure you I have tanked for groups that include DPS warriors charging in immediately (with ravager) and mages that AoE immediately. That is the experience I am speaking from.
---
&gt; And you know as well as I do that without rage/aggro I can't do most of what a tank is supposed to do. Including the things on your list.
---
The top three don't require any rage, and the fourth doesn't need any more than you'd get from hitting the mob. Keeping mobs off the healer can be done with Demo Shout alone, and implicitly means mobs are hitting you. If DPS are tanking them, they also aren't hitting the healer.
---
Would it help if I uploaded a video of this? I'm not a mage in disguise trying to tell you to do the impossible. But I genuinely think you're seeing this as a "right / wrong" "good / bad" kind of thing when tanking for these groups is really more of a "best effort" thing.
---
Even if you made them wait for five seconds (gets you three GCDs), that'll be enough for Berserker Rage and two Sunders. That means when AoE starts, you've made no progress on all mobs other than the two you sundered. And that's if you made them wait five seconds. You've got a little more rage, but you're going to be chasing mobs either way. What you really would want is enough time to get a couple of sunders on each mob, but that's gonna add at least 10-15 seconds to every pull while they're sitting on their hands.
---
I second Uldaman.  If you don't already have stoneslayer it is a pretty great weapon for the level.
---
r/Unexpected lol
---
Thank you again! I'll try to remember that. Is there any chance you'd be willing to screen shot your talent tree and share it with me, even privately? I'm a super casual (and new) player so I'm a little overwhelmed by all of this haha
---
Dark pact build or SM/Ruin until you start raiding. 
---
SM/Ruin or DS/Ruin once you start raiding. 
---
DS/Ruin is the better raid build for all but 1 warlock in your raid. But early on having more than 1 SM/Ruin lock is fine unless you are in a hardcore guild that wants 100% attendance and mix-maxed clear times.
---
I changed over to Kirtonos to level with some friends and I am really regretting it. I had a level 27 Hunter on August 28th and rerolled Hunter again.
---
Aw shucks ;)
---
Isn’t there a diamond tipped staff to add to your pimp
---
I tried last night and it was easier than I thought (or I just got lucky), spent around 30-45min doing laps of the Fire elementals in Un’Goro and got 3 essences and some okay xp.
---
Nah, I'd rather continue
---
Trueeee
---
He did account for that :)
---
" There's a 1 in 25 chance to win both rolls. Higher if someone is passing. This would happen to about 40 of us"
---
I didn't see anything in the settings there
---
It's absolutely consistently doable, I do it all the time. No issues.
---
Probably is.
---
I got MC'd into trash 3 times right outside the BRD instance portal last night. Really cuts how much durability you have left for the run(s). The priest is on my KoS list.
---
Most is any mob that sleeps and switches targets. Next up would be any with a fast recharge stun or a disease that takes AGES to go away.
---
Just want to point out that after 40 gold become easier to make so if you just continue questing and run some dungeons you should have enough in no time.
---
Can't blame Alliance players though. It might not be be fun for Horde to basically end up on a PvE server, but from experience I can tell you it's definitely not fun as Alliance to barely be able to quest or grind because you spend 80% of your time running back to your corpse that is still being camped.
---
I feel like a special snowflake that I already knew all that, or maybe I'm just old as balls....
---
“I tanked with a 2H easily until ZF.”
---
Well then stop complaining about healers that aren’t speced to carry your ass cause you want to be a huge crutch on the whole group cause you can’t equip a shield. Common fucking sense man.
---
See if you can get [this](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/mute-wow-sounds) to work in classic.
---
Good ole nipple sap...
---
need screech growl and dive as skills.
---
claw+screech doesn't work as both have no cooldown
---
I afforded my mount a couple hours after dinging 40.  It was pretty easy. I did have skinning and mining, although my mining isn’t past 80 yet. I don’t necessarily think your professions have to be “money pits” thoughCouple of rules I followed:
---
• Don’t buy skills you don’t need! I’ve probably went to the trainer a handful of times, and even then, I’m not buying all my skills. By level 20 you should know what skills you use the most of. General rule of thumb, levels 20,30,40, etc have the newest skills you can learn. 
---
• I put leveling skills on the “back burner”, unless the materials naturally came to me.
---
• get a plug-in that shows you vendor prices and compare the prices on the Auction House. I made a ton of gold to 40 just by doing this... even if an item was only a silver profit, a profit is a profit and it adds up.
---
• I’m not an enchanting pro but I’d focus on disenchanting items and selling those materials on the AH. Look into a plug-in called “echantrix”? It’ll show you what chance of materials you can make from your green/blue items.
---
• You can utilize making bags and selling on the AH with materials you’ll naturally find while leveling. If you’re savvy enough, you might be able to make a profit by buying stacks of cloth on the AH.
---
Bur
---
I ask DPS for at least 10 seconds before dropping AOE. If you macro a swap to a 2H / berserker stance / ww it really helps. 
---
I also like to set a skull. Between 2 sunders a ww and my shouts hes gonna be close to dead by the time they pull him off me so I can try and spend more time building threat on the rest of the group.
---
I also like to try and move a little faster than my group. Start the next pull while they are still topping off mana. 5 seconds alone with a group of mobs makes a big difference.
---
do some grinding till the population catches up, surely the epic mount is still out of reach, or just cold hard cash
---
I feel this on a spiritual level.
---
Lmao I made a rogue Orc last night named Potatorc
---
So by that logic Heartseeker and Earthfury are both inevitably also going to be shit very soon, since everyone is hitting 60 now and there's going to be a boredom phase before phase 2 where everyone makes PvP alts on the low pop servers to steamroll the server and bias it more than it already is.
---
Again, That is the hunter's role. If he tries and fails, well shit happens.
---
If he's not even doing his role, because there's a fleeing mob and he's busy rapid firing some guy at full health because he wants to win a dps race, then he is bad.
---
If he puts his pet on the fleeing mob, and is just standing still and shooting. He is bad.
---
If he sits and whines that he has too much responsibility while playing a utility class. He is bad.
---
Simply based on your comments in this thread. You are bad. And that likely has more to do with you not getting invited to groups then the fact that you're a hunter.
---
I love when people send lame ass messages like this and then not have the guts to wait for your reply and ignore you first
---
That isn't the water you mages give to people is it???
---
Good luck emulating the actions of 10s of thousands of extra players.  It never was a single group, it was the collective numbers. 
---
And tell that to the 60 rogue who had to get saved by another 60 rogue last night in blasted lands from a 49 mage. 
---
Your make assumptions about skill when the decision to leave is more based on saving time. I like to PvP. No I don’t mind being ganked. No I don’t want to be smacked constantly by different groups of people as they finish the quest in 5 mins and I’m still sitting there hours later. Or leave and try somewhere else to have the same actions repeated. 
---
It’s ok though. It’s pvp server. 
---
But it’s also ok that I left your asses on a horde pve server because blizzard gave me the option to. Just like blizzard gives you guys the right the gank constantly. Have fun ganking the end high alliance guilds who have time and nothing better to do then PvP you. 
---
If you had some discretion and allowed the younglings to level you could have had a flock to kill. Then I wouldn’t had to use the ability to leave at my own discretion, leaving you with a burning pile of shit to pve in.
---
Yeah this is a quality troll post, I loved it cuz I was tilted until the end.
---
Thanks for the guide! I never actually read up on the differences between CQP/CRF/CBR, so it was really informative and helpful.
---
It's more fun to gank when you aren't 100% positive you'll win
---
I got a lei of lilies...
---
sounds like ur a shit gm m8
---
It very well could be, but at least leveling has been much nicer.
---
Hey this is a good meme, but it’s been posted here a looooooot to the point it’s been beaten to death, sorry friend
---
Which target do I banish?
---
Depends on if you want to go daggers or hemo swords/maces. Most builds are centered around cold blood/prep but any world pvp or bg I would get improved sprint as the hardest part about playing a melee is getting snared.
---
Yeah and we also have focused casting and clear casting and other things...my point is as an ele shaman if you are close enough to use warstomp you likely want to make distance rather than sit and cast. And a single stun with the cool down it has isn't better than orc racials. That was the point I was trying to make
---
From my experience on other games.... God you couldn't be more right. Every one of them thinks they're the one good one and hate the rest of them. It's fucking comical.
---
This is how someone gets the clap.
---
Anyone knows any classic-streamer on twitch that is constantly answering noobie questions, does have a decent microphone and has a warm, nice voice to listen too?
---
Like a stream u can just listen without even really watching. :)
---
I wouldn’t call hitting 60 now rushing
---
TBC ruined wow
---
Sulfuras seems horde centric. But it’s close enough I’m happy. About to hit 40 on ally
---
Now this is content
---
Thanks!  Im glad to see there are some decent dungeon drops I can farm while I gather gold for the warden staff.
---
Yeahhh that and heirlooms made twinking not as fun to me anymore.
---
Because tbc sucks
---
How are you wasting time and money for everyone, when you can still complete the content?
---
Yall act like by not getting the best gear possible before the raid, that you are walking in with an empty slot. There is gear close in quality that doesn't cost mountains of gold. Close enough in quality to complete the content. 
---
Or do you mean, because you were geared to the teeth and it took 5 minutes longer, you owe them for it? Ok lets give all 39 people in the raid the 5 silver they lost from those 5 minutes. 
---
You can keep telling yourself all this, but there are plenty, PLENTY of guilds out there willing to just throw themselves at MC regardless of people not going balls to the wall preparing beforehand. And they even will kill most of not all of the bosses!
---
Right....
---
you could not be more wrong. I have found groups for every piece of content i wanted to run. yes there are tons of alliance, but with some more horde it will be a balance high pvp server. Dont stop other people from actually enjoying what they signed up for. Stallagg is doomed.  The ally have left and its a horde pve server. No thanks,
---
Nothing wrong with needing BIS gear if you're switching at 60. I don't see what the problem is.
---
A couple days a go I did a ZF run with a 42 hunter (me), 42 warlock, 43 mage, 43 druid, and a 49 warrior tank.  It was a rough run, we died enough that we had to repair.  If it wasnt for the tank being so much higher, we wouldnt have finished it.
---
Rogues were never in any patch able to reliably kill a druid unless the rogue just severely out geared/lvl them.  It wasn't even a thing at any point.  The druid kit is the pure counter to rogue and always was.  
---
To top that off even further the game is running on the 1.12 patch which is the patch that fixed feral druids leading into 2.0 (TBC).  Which by the way didn't make anything but marginal changes to the feral build moving from 1.12.  all those comments about druids being awesome in TBC, that actually started in 1.12 with Feral, people just didn't begin adopting it until 2.0 as it was misunderstood.
---
This is why your seeing druids as the better tanks for dungeons, raids, etc currently.  They have superior health pools, superior raw mitigation, and vastly superior TPS to warriors, at the cost of no reliable fear break/immune and block parry.  The fear immune matters on some fights, the avoidance only matters if the healers aren't geared.   The big draw of the druid tank is the superior TPS to even a fury tank warrior allowing the big DPS to go balls to the wall, which even a fury warrior cannot achieve 100%.
---
It's nice to see people begining to realize this.
---
Grinding is boring because you just repetitively do the exact same thing: sit in the spot, kill the same mobs, for hours at a time... Sorry.
---
Doh.  I missed that it was for a 10 man.  That Pulls the odds down by 4x.
---
"You wanna know how I can tell you've never smoked crack?"
---
Tell us, friend. Those of us who have never experienced it(thus would not know anything on the subject), and would love to hear more.
---
Game has literally been out 1 month, yes I'd call it rushing
---
God man that sounds like hell. I hate tanks pulling even as a lock, and I try not to pull too much aggro myself and if I do I try to do some crowd control for the tanks to catch up.     I work with my healer and haven't died aside from wipes except once. And I honestly don't even know what happened or why I died so fast so I didn't even blame my healer. I was full health then suddenly dead lol
---
9g market value for vendor trash?  What the fuck.
---
That and you can consistently get junkboxes to keep your lockpicking up to date.
---
Anyone know which action bar addon this is?
---
It's better with a good group that runs it multiple times
---
Fus-Roh-Dah is how i pronounce  it..
---
Yarp happened to me on Kromcrush. Got the Rockpounder outta ULDA, as no one needed it, and my 2h mace skill was at 1. So I went to Hillsbrad and started murdering Naga's. When a few people showed up I out of party started helping them kill them. 
---
A paladin shows up and tries to invite me to group. I decline and start to tell him I'm leveling my weap skill and that I'll help kill out of party when he immediately starts talking bout how I fail at life for farming mobs below my level. He then proceeds to tell me to go back to retail and also that he's let his horde guild know in discord where I am and that they are coming to camp me. I called him a try hard /ignored him and started rounding up as many Naga's as possible and killing them so he couldn't get any kills.
---
After about 5 minutes of doing this I /rude to him and leave as my 2h weap mace skill was high enough to get away from this annoying paladin.
---
It was removed in the beta and then readded before launch.
---
So the Wowhead BiS list for hunters in classic is wrong?
---
That seems overly complicated, you can just base everything in silver, copper can be decimals, and 1 gold is 100 silver.
---
&gt; First, DM was deadmines before Dire Maul ever came out. I am willing to bet the servers who used VC for deadmines were launched post Dire Maul patch.
---
It is in the Official Brady Strategy Guide that was made during the testing phases well before Dire Maul existed.
---
Do people actually struggle as druid vs rogue?
---
Renew and bubble will throw you into combat if the target goes into combat. You should not renew/shield pre-combat if you plan on doing combat drinking. The trick with combat drinking is to hit renew/drink at the same time, since drinking won't be triggered by the GCD, and do it immediately as the heal resolves. By time it puts you back in combat, you're already drinking.
---
You attacked him first so not really ganked attempt
---
Try suggesting it next time you see it's needed! The key to a smooth and fun dungeon run is to have open communication. Some warlocks may just be new or haven't played healer, and didn't even know it was a problem
---
i'm so glad this thread exists, just to not feel alone in how crappy  /script PetAbandon();  doesn't work anymore. i found this thread with the google search, "how to love your warlock after getting a 5#!7y demon name"
---
this "fix" is an example of what makes Classic not vanilla
---
Yeah, although bears are less affected.
---
Just, don't shield any tanks except pallies when going into a fight. Only use it when absolutely necessary.
---
Farming Mara for 40+ gold an hour isn’t such a bad idea compared to umm taking more time leveling... but yea I guess I’ll have to hope/wait long enough or  people to roll my server.
---
Unfortunately that one was added during WotLK.
---
The alt is a rando/bteam/w.e.  Those don't get loot priority, and you don't expect them to show up often.
---
The top dps character is still there 90%+ of the time.  If it's top dps then it already has the gear it needs, and second top dps in the class group getting a better chance at a piece that the top would have wanted on the slim chance something like that drops isn't a big deal - no gear is going wasted.  That's why the officer is doing the dl invites instead of standing in solidarity.
---
I'm specifically talking about vanilla/classic btw, other games have more of a need for upgrading to progress - vanilla/classic content is designed to be beatable by a hodgepodge of classes, specs, and eq ratings.  Everyone being BiS or near it with minmax'd specs trivializes the content.
---
What race are you? My human Mage is also 52 and evocation gets me from zero to 90% with no spirit gear. I've also played a gnome in the past that would get to about 85%.
---
You used to be able to bloodrage poly too (IIRC it was a self-dot at launch)
---
Yeah... I saw a Bene last week and was like "I have 8 days played and I'm not 50 yet and you have that?!" and it made me feel bad until I realized I was having fun AND I was excited to see a player with an item I recognized instantly.
---
Stonks
---
&gt; That said, the other warrior charging in instantly is an issue.
---
It's only an issue if it's threatening a wipe. Otherwise, it's just impromptu offtanking.
---
He's wearing plate. If the healer doesn't want to heal him, let the healer complain. Nobody's going to blame the tank for a DPS warrior charging in immediately and pulling too much aggro.
---
what's your /played?
---
Warriors basically can't use it though. Arms is too tasty compared to Fury at that level.
---
Because you've got Mortal Strike and are starting to put points in cruelty. It's the first time in the game the Warrior stops being crit starved and switching to a mace kinda ruins that.
---
If it's anything like my experience, that kick has a 50% chance of lagging for a second before actually going off.
---
You don't get 20% off, you get 10% off for honored and 10% for rank3 that's all. The 60% is 80g without discount.  [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=2414/pinto-bridle](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=2414/pinto-bridle)
---
If it's relatively minor content like a new quest hub or two every quarter and maybe a new instance every six months--yes, absolutely. Obviously I'm not on the team and don't know the effort involved in doing a full expansion, but we know it took over two years and a dedicated team to bring Classic to a beta state.
---
Among the challenges they would have faced is interfacing the old code which spoke to their old monolithic database schema with their newer partitioned database schema, updating all scripted events to use whatever APIs are available to the new client, and along the way testing every little change against an "original" reference.
---
Blizz has told us that the majority of the challenge in making Classic a reality was getting it working on the new client. They'd run into the exact same scenario with TBC.
---
Adding an NPC here and there with some new quests and occasionally a new zone reusing old textures is something that they can do fairly painlessly with a game design engine without minor touching of backend systems.
---
Again, I don't work for them so I can't speak with certainty, but I definitely believe that Classic-ifying expansions will be a lot harder and involve more technical backend developers who get paid higher salaries.
---
Lol you have absolutely no clue
---
Spoiler alert: He's a human all along.
---
Right It's the next day and I'm w/e about it now, shit was still dumb that was the direction he wanted to escalate that being told no, lol.
---
I guess the first question would be what are you trying to do? Is this for level 60 or sub 60 or what? 
---
That build in your link looks more or less like a pure AoE leveling build to me because it lacks some essential talents like Ice Shards.
---
Definitely had an intervention with my gf last weekend about my time played... The destructive addiction is nice in the moment but don't burn yourself out.
---
No mages are offended, it's widely known there are a lot of bad mages. Even in AoE groups there are mages that just want to blizzard and don't know how to set up a good clump or play off the other party members' toolkits
---
I physically recoiled watching him run to the side of the druid to flank him for backstab, like there's unit collision in PVP
---
1st row: n, b, b,n
---
2nd row:  b, n,b,b
---
3rd row: all bleach
---
No, hunters mark and ff work differently. Mark reveals stealthed targets while ff prevents the stealth from being used at all.
---
It took our group of 5 50+ kills to get that horn, after we all killed 20-30 individually.
---
For one, he was one level below you. Two, the entire point of a rogue is to take the initiative and surprise your opponent. That is literally how you play them in world PVP. If you don't do that, you shouldn't really be playing a rogue at all as they are tuned to be the first to attack or else you are screwed. So no, this was not a gank and a definite miss-use of the term.
---
doesnt shapeshift cancel it?
---
Anywhere in retail.
---
My guess is that they want the average player to be 60 or close to 60 by the time phase 2 hits, so probably at least another 2 months.
---
You had me in the first half, not gonna lie
---
Thought this was going to be a QQ post about being constantly ganked but surprisingly turned out to be a positive post!
---
No one really gives a shit if a whiny healer leaves either.
---
There is no additional discount for revered or exalted. You get 10% for honored and 10% for rank... 3? Pvp. Not 100% sure on which rank it is
---
As I recall that elite is pretty badass.
---
Go to Hillsbrad, there is a path north or Durnholde Keep that leads to the Alliance base there.
---
At 54 you dont have portals?
---
They do because they are beholden to shareholders.  You may not like that they have to prioritize it, but that's the reality of the situation and pretending it's not won't accomplish anything.
---
Through Hillsbrad. Go west through the big stone gate, then north.
---
No it is not.
---
Southshore. Look at the top right hand section of the map and there is a small gap in the mountains. When you run that way you’ll see two level 40 gryphons flying around the opening into the hinterlands.
---
1. Why should the population of a lower faction be stuck having to deal with queues if they don't want to? Wouldn't that simply result in those people quitting, thus increasing the divide between factions?
---
2. Why would you want a new server to basically get forced into only having a single faction populate it? If you only let the higher pop faction from two servers transfer onto a new server, but both of those servers had a horde advantage, it would result in a horde only server until they opened it up for character creation. And at that point why would anyone want to roll alliance on there if it started with exclusively horde players?
---
If you have terrible luck you will delay them a little bit. Everyone will hit 60 eventually though if they put in the time. The other side is areas can shift. Stv on my server has been controlled by the horde for a while. Well ally controls it now and were destroying any horde they saw in  there all day yesterday.
---
where would i look him up? youtube? twitch? mixxer (cuz thats a thing now apparently?)
---
It is for P1 in that particular instance, yes.
---
yeah, as a shadowpriest, can confirm, most people mosey on along when they see me anything above 100% mana cause they know that healthpool regens at a ridiculous rate
---
I had that amount too and had the gold by level 42. Although I had ghost wolf so it didn't matter that much
---
Try Badlands, I think you get sent down from there?
---
Reminds me when I was level 24 and accidentally lost my life savings to some Goblin asshole.
---
Imbued vial: 3g15s
---
Empty vial: 21s
---
Both: Same icon.
---
Me: fucked.
---
That's fine that you do that, but please don't have any delusions that it is faster. Here is the cycle for Succubus: Pet attack, Ignite, CoA, Corruption, Drain Life -&gt; Dead. Mobs die before Corruption wears off, even as you are getting close to 60. And you can do one after another after another after another. You guys seem to forget that Succubus does a LOT of damage. In the 40s she was about 30% of my damage and 50s-60, it was still around 15-20%.
---
what do you use instead?
---
Really glad i'm on Grobbulus. I feel for you people who's servers are completely imbalanced.
---
Luckily it's early in Classic, get to rerolling
---
Dire maul is phase 2. Very soon
---
You're assuming there are no assholes who like to kill lowbies just cause they can.
---
I miss Netscape. Was my browser of choice for years.
---
backhanded him smooth off that ledge!
---
Hunters arena pure dps class. They provide no other role.
---
Hybrids can spec into dps or healing or tanking. Hybrid implies that they provide multiple roles to any given raid group.
---
You are truly helpless. You argue about things of which you have absolutely no knowledge. GTFO
---
I've been in a group with a Warrior who rolled Need on the Carapace Spine Crossbow because the 4 agility on it was an upgrade for him, when there were 2 Hunters in the group using the quest bow from Maraudon.
---
I find that if I aggro 3 mobs, I lose health quicker than my mana regenerates, so after I leave bear form and heal, I don't have enough mana to go back into bear form
---
never would have thought about dive, ill work on getting that asap. also yeah claw is just for dungeons but it seems i can just use screech for them too, just turn off growl.
---
...... So I AoE pull it all..?
---
Add a /startattack in there.
---
Everything I've read so far has stated that I was paying 80g with the discount, which wasn't making any fucking sense in my stupid head. My bad dudes.
---
Hitting 60 in 4 weeks is by definition, not rushing, when people can hit it in 4 days
---
Honestly with all the AoE spam I'm surprised people struggle with the mines. I didn't have volley at the time, but as a hunter I'd just multishot to take care of mines pretty often, or tab target and like 1 or 2 hits would take care of it. The 4 pull is rough but as a ranged class I didn't feel it was that bad on the DPS end (can't speak for tank), and same for downing the bombs in the last boss.
---
As alliance, I now camp the dogshit out of lowbie hordes in quest areas. Gotta help my brethren catch up.
---
I'm not level 54 😉
---
Ever nub needs this.
---
Ah look it’s happy from sons of anarchy
---
Is it the Alliance equivalent of zug zug or kek?
---
LF1M WC healer. Must be healer  spec no matter what! Since I’m a 2 handed idiot that wants to be carried through dungeons without a hard time.
---
I wonder if were going to have day long Alterac.Valley games again
---
He said 2-3 years after everything is released, not after launch.
---
Incorrect. Fear is never used as a cc unless you are straight bad at this game.
---
Diamond is succubus CC, triangle is usually sap because no one runs with druids.
---
Where would one acquire such a guild?
---
Something about the shimmering flats brings out these bad rogue gankers. The other day I was turning in my quests when I got opened on. I’m a warlock so I literally just ran the other way and put CoEx and my other dots on them. This rogue proceeded to just feebly chase after me while slowed. Didn’t sprint, didn’t blind (they were lvl 34),  and just slowly melted helplessly while I kept him at a constant 20-30 yard distance.
---
It does happen a lot. Sometimes I feel it’s faster to touch the screen with my pinkie toe. But that rogue didn’t even try to kick the druid. That’s the part that bothers.
---
They aren't required for BRD.
---
Just grind mobs or go BRD for your prebis.
---
I followed the river up from Hillsbrad.  Then there's a path in front of Scholo that leads up through the mountains into Hinterlands.
---
Pretty much what I did, but I switched my alt to a rogue cause my buddy that joined late wanted to Tauren Warrior.
---
For reference, my main is Tom Selleck(Mage), Michael Caine (Warrior), Anna Paquin(Rogue - Female)
---
Yea so I'm saying if you're looking for speed above all else why not just pay a powerleveler?
---
could you zoom in any closer? jesus you play at horrible angles with no view of the character ganking you and you are way too zoomed in.. jesus that rogue would have to be fucknig terrible
---
It's learned from the trainer.
---
Not actually mad, little tilted that people expect healers to be heal spec. I've had a few tanks get mad at me from 40-55 when I show up in shadow form.
---
Honestly what did you expect? You're coming to reddit to talk about how you have a good life, love your work, your kids and wife, seem to have a very smart way of thinking about how the excess of technology can be detrimental to our lifes. Pretty much about everything that Redditers CAN'T RELATE TO.
---
I just use it specifically to see if vendor patterns are worth buying lol
---
We might get a filtered internet when the kids are a lot older. 
---
The oldest is turning 4 this year. On the contrary they may thank me as adults for not sticking them under a screen as a baby. We have a lot of kids on our street that they play around with.
---
Homework could be done with books as research papers. Believe it or not no one had the internet at home 25 years ago but we may or may not go that route.
---
Asmongold is a real friendly quality fellow. No backlash, super positive attitude and never rages!
---
It depends on your hit. 
---
Blackcrow is BiS if you aren't hit capped. And Carapace is BiS if you are hit capped.
---

---
Yep and it actually made a significant difference.
---
You spend longer at 60 than you do levelling to get there. If you know the role you'll play then there is nothing wrong with needing on the gear you will be using.
---
Check out Skarm’s YouTube videos on offtank tips and fury-prot. There is a huge cache of info about this in his videos.
---
yeah its been a nightmare leveling him, i got my owl (level 7) when i was almost lvl 30 so i been more or less tanking everything and xping slowly to get him up to par, im hoping by lvl like 24 he can start tanking a little bit. i will probably use screech only on dgs thats a solid idea ty. ill work on getting dive when owl is up to snuff.
---
People have been playing private servers for years.
---
But not many of them, a couple thousand on the bigger servers. That's not enough to keep Classic afloat and if it reaches p server numbers, it's getting shut down.
---
I am a mage and i completed a ST the other day and i was the only real aoe there (we had a shaman healer) anyway I did have to drink every third mob pack which the tank had no regard for my mana (which is fine and understandable, hes working g with maintaining rage afterall) and I end up either late to that mob pack or full mana for the next. At the end I was second (by a thin margin) in overall damage done for the dungeon to a very well geared rogue that had no downtime, unlike me. Guess my point is even thow there may be some manageable downtime, aoe still puts out so much dmg it's easier to finish them off from your st users and still be very fast. I think the deciding factor is weather the person understands how their class fits its role within game mechanics. (On a side note I did steal threat on occasion but that tank was a beast and got it back quickly)
---
None of the quoted items you have there prevent e or my guildies from bringing along hunters. We have several in our guild that we take all the time. The only thing that keeps us from pugging them typically is the item distribution. 
---
As I mentioned in another post, a lot of hunters don't follow any rule of consideration with regards to loot. Its just a matter of courtesy that we typically extend to other players. I even have to do it as a healer. If a cloth item drops that is way better overall for a mage in the party than it is for me as a priest in the long run, I will allow that item to go to the player that needs it more. 
---
Those kinds of calculations are easier to do when only a few players  are in the running against one another. It is a bit harder given the versatility of the hunter's toolkit. While SOME hunters (including the very wonderful people in our guild) are very open to the idea that one piece of gear might be overall better and longer lasting for one player than another, other players are not, and will need roll on something just for 2 extra agi when it represents a much more substantive upgrade for someone else. There again, it may just seem like nitpicking, but when you get to UBRS and lose your crossy to a warrior, it makes sense. For you there is only one slot this will really occur on, for other classes it could potentially be many slots. 
---
That is, in my experience, why groups don't like pug hunters. pugs don't have to concern themselves with the betterment of the group, and so in our case, if they aren't a guildie, we typically are suspicious of hunters.
---
Lol, understandable. Personally, I only ever roll on mail items. I only pve for pvp gear, so taking a badass lesther item isnt for me. Has to suck for a rogue nowadays competing with hunters and fury warriors for +hit leather gear
---
Check out https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25202-InFlightClassic.html
---
Your group isn’t meta enough.  Shaman tank, with two warriors as dps, druid (not feral) as ranged dps, and shadow priest healing.
---
After the shaman uses a throwing axe to bring the mobs to him, he watches both warriors charge past him (to two different mobs), while the priest is dotting everything until his mana is gone.  Druid is still drinking.
---
I recommend an RP Server. We're great! We play on Grobbulus :)
---
I'm level 58 and average 1-2 hour a level after 50 not AoE grinding.
---
We did it with 2 tanks instead of having the mage kite because our tanks wanted a challenge the other day. We were reasonably well-geared and downed it, but did have 2 deaths and some oom healers who'd potted/runed.
---
Was kind of fun to do, but once is enough. Let the hunter/mage kite.
---
thanks bro
---
Running WC is really hard at level 50. I would probably need 2 healers atleast.
---
Both MS of course.
---
Did I mention that everyone should need all BoEs?
---
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mnTBsBdrFA&amp;t=90s)

Well if ya don't mind a few clicks, why not go click them from the vendor and save us both some time.
---
Stoneslayer is a sword
---
You have to be exalted with the other faction to get their mount.
---
He's super loud, I would not describe his stream as pleasant to listen to at all. Watching his stream gives me anxiety
---
Last boss if 47, Uldaman technically has 2 parts though. One that is like mid to late 30s and the other half that is early to mid 40s
---
Hehe. World pvp 
---
Good times
---
What's it have to do with a milk cap?
---
Fuck you got me. I am one of those gnome mages
---
How did you scour out these places , and how'd did u get in to them? also where the hell is old ironforge? or is current classic ironforge,that was changed in cata?
---
You would have to be exalted with TB in order to buy a Kodo.
---
I'm guessing the good rogues are all farming gear and waiting for p2, because every rogue that has tried to gank me so far has been bad. They ignore my succubus and open on me, I get a free seduce and it's over.
---
He went to the trouble of having dual fierys at level 31, that's some messed up priorities if he didn't get the skills he unlocked over a level ago.
---
I think he was showing you examples of it being 'expressly authorized by Blizzard'
---
I love these horde PvP anecdotes. "I was mildly inconvenienced once, that's directly comparable to being completely outnumbered at all times in every zone for the perpetuity of the game"
---
I know what it is, it just doesn't support your opinion man. There aren't any ally dominated pvp realms to transfer to. If they opened up new realms to transfer to and gated the transfers to only one faction, that new server would be populated only by that faction. Do you understand what I'm saying?
---
Unless you've got a real chub for doing nothing but healing dungeons from ~13-60, do yourself a favor and level as enhancement. You can heal everything up to (and possibly including, tank gear dependent) BRD at lv 50+ with zero points in resto and a casual healing set you pick up from quest items and dungeon drops nobody else wants.
---
Even elemental pre-40 will be a less miserable experience than dumping all your points into resto, if you don't want to manage two sets of gear.
---
&gt; then aggro goes back to the tank
---
Sometimes. Ive had it happen more than once that a pet goes in, growls and takes aggro--then the hunter moves the pet back or it gets into a position where I cant easily chase. Then the pet dies and it goes straight for the healer generating threat the whole time. Im fine with tanking pets, but leave it in melee if youre going to do it so I can still tab target sunder/revenge it every once in a while.
---
Idk when I was lvl 40 as arms I teamed up with a 42 shadow priest and we killed a 60 shadow priest. Gotta group up to get the advantage back lol
---
Are there free transfers still? I’m not going to re-roll. Heart-seeker was the one I had my eyes on.
---
Look at Jericho.
---
You can only get the mounts from other races if you're exalted by that race, so its gonna take some time
---
PVP weapons are quite strong for quite some time
---
I've added sources to my post. The numbers are likely fairly inaccurate as they're third party estimates, however they're probably good enough for rough estimations :)
---
In re-reading the source I've also just realised I've misread it. It didn't grow to 223% it grew by 223% meaning a factor of 3.23 not 2.23. I've updated accordingly.
---
I control my own life. My time with my kids and wife are important to me. It makes more sense to play in the morning because I can stop when work starts rather than just having the open night... I get really sucked in and I know that about myself so this is a win-win. My wife is my partner, not my dictator. The two X chromosome sub would call me the bad guy if they knew that I encouraged her to get rid of her smartphone with me lol.
---
When you are married both individuals surrender some control. It isn't for everyone.
---
Mark 1 with a diamond have the rouge sap. Mark one with square have the mage sheep it. Mark 1 with moon and have the hunter trap it. 
---
Now you’re tanking 1 target.
---
Take the shortest possible route to max level vending machine
---
You have to have, I think, exalted rep with that races faction to purchase their mount. So you’d have to be exalted with thunderbluff to get a Kodo but you could get one yes.
---
I'm a rogue so I don't get to do that
---
Your icon says Pally, but you are obviously a rogue... none of the rogues I’ve ever played with have known how to kill {skull} then {cross}
---
The condom definitely isn't sap.
---
A soul for a soul.

&gt; Uhh what is your point of reference on that?

https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d92fzi/finally_accumulated_enough_gold_to_buy/f1eoep5/
---
Paladin tanking is a joke with how easy it is, give everyone Blessing of Salvation and just pop consecration on pull and no one will be able to rip threat off you, makes runs fast as fuck when DPS are able to just AOE right off the bat and not worry about pulling threat.
---
I got hacked back in Vanilla before 2 step as well, and it was the best thing  to ever happen to me. They used my characters to farm DM and did not transfer the gold / loot off my character before I gained access back to my account, so I ended up gaining like 200+ gold
---
Sometimes i use star to "kill third"
---
JoJo/WoW maymays bring much joy
---
Oh my goodness, are you saying I've been trolled?
---
I swear this never happens.
---
Yea this gets me every time... if not this it’s a 57 mage who is “bored” and is begging for money lmao!
---
Once I hit level 40 for dark pact, I can 10+ mobs without stopping. And stopping usually just means a bandage while my succubus is aggroing the next mob
---
Nipple? I think we can all agree that it’s condom.
---
I will protect even those I hate, so long as it is right.
---
oof sucks for that person
---
When phase 3 hits, yes you can need on them (I highly encourage it just to spite all the warriors and rogues who rolled need on blackcrow cuz “ITS MY BIS TOO”) but until then, don’t do it because not only is it a highly contested set, there are better weapons than it.
---
Bro, use google.

Green!

Is there a way to log into WoW without launching it from the Battle.net client. At one point I had a WoW account that was separate from my Battle.net login, but I remember merging it. I want to just launch the WoW.exe directly and type username and password instead of loading up the launcher... is it possible now or no?
---
Yeah, the people complaining about constant ganks just don't know how the meta goes to completion/through cycles.
---
They either come in when a gank squad is going on, or high levels are there.  They don't realize that it starts with 1-2 people camping some guy, the camped guy getting a gank squad together for retaliation('because camping is fighting dirty!'), then people who were collateral damage from the gank squad pvp calling in their high level friends('because that side is fighting dirty zerging up!'), then high levels on both sides eventually show up and duke it out, then once it dies down the last high level chills out and decides to act like a raid boss and kills some random dude who then decides to get retaliation on someone he can kill, ('because that side is fighting dirty with high levels!').
---
People are getting killed, trying to fight solo, then complaining or hearthing out.  It's a warzone, which is what makes pvp servers fun.
---
I would not continually swap specs based on weapon alone while leveling.
---
Just. IF can go Arathi real quick, to Alterac real quick, to menethil then to Theramore which is a short flight to Ashenvale. IF is the one true alliance capital, SW only became the capital after portals were added to everything. Long live IF.
---
&gt; It is probably about 60-40 at this point favoring the Horde.
---
&gt; The imbalance is still only slight, but as you can see in this thread, people get sick of true population imbalances.
---
60-40 means 50% more horde, idk if I’d call that slight.
---
and want to pull a few more mobs after that?
---
Tanks please please please buy a ranged weapon. If you want to continue to be a noob. Keep body pulling.
---
100% relate to this. Hardly even left my room during the 1-60 grind. Didn't answer texts, didn't talk to anyone, didn't go to work.
---
Noob question:
---
How could you see him at the beginning when he is in stealth?
---
I thought you have to be many levels above to actually see the rogue like that?
---
dreamstate was so fun, will definitely level a druid if tbc re-releases
---
Never said it always is fallacious, just that it's always a bad argument. And it is.
---
Is it possible to make nested macros? Or something similar? So you could have one that was just the text “%t=lf3m dps &amp; heal wc” and then do like “/lfg %t”
---
Only if you’re not an alchemist ;)
---
Less than 5% of the active playerbase is 60. If you’re there, you rushed and played multiple hours every single day.
---
No other way around it.
---
The difference with warlock pet skills you can skip levels. With class skills you have to eventually buy all the ranks.
---
F
---
The macro can be useful in raids. I would avoid using it in any situation where the tank is tanking more than 1 mob. 
---
I do use a macro like yours. I just don’t click on the tank and directly target the mobs when the tank is holding agro on more than one mob.
---
I'm on Sulfuras which seems to be a balanced server but I always notice way more horde around than alliance in every mixing zone. Just the other day we had a horde raid group roll up on Darkshire to fight, only to disband when we couldn't even rally half of their numbers to fight back. 
---
Another user said that most of the Alliance players are probably in town AFK or in dungeons.
---
The one guy in trade who is always selling travelers backpacks for 25g and spams it every 3 seconds
---
10-15 prob, have work, wife, kids, dog.
---
You should reconsider posting topics with the dicussion tag if this is how you go about it.
---
In EQ the exp bar is not shown unless you open the character panel to keep you from going insane.
---
Because you don’t. Its the same as Rogue. If you level with Survival spec, you will have bad time. Its that simple. You will have better luck with BM spec anyways in low level pvp
---
Phase 4 is a looooong ways away. I would drop tailoring after robes are crafted and pick it back up in P4
---
&gt;If he’s alliance it technically is for a very short time but it isn’t worth being a prick to your melee. 
---
He was horde.
---
A mage with some FR gear can solo all if the fire eles and incendious on the bridge to add some meat into each run. Used to run guildies there to leech FR bracers from him in vanilla
---
Being lvl 59 has no bearing on if someone should or shouldnt roll for it..
---
Because it's an /emergency/ maintenance.
---
No that sounds like a GM having political bias... I would ask for a separate review because National Security is not offencive
---
59 is one lvl away...
---
I think that as consumers (and as developers) we should all understand that games don't last forever. We don't pop in our cartridge of Ocarina of Time 20 years later and continue our journey because we closed that chapter many years ago. 
---
Classic, BFA, and many other games are the same. We should always just enjoy the moments we have in the games we enjoy and not worry about what the future holds for them.
---
The reason why i roll a mage  
---
https://imgur.com/IkLuLQN
---
Problem with that is that free BRD shoulders give you 2%, devilsaur gives an aditional 2%, Jintha'alor trinkes is 1% and Mara ring another 1%. 
---
That's 6% hit chance that you get either without having to rely on any RNG at all or being able to farm it yourself very easily, and your other BiS items like Mask of the Unforgiven, Windreaver Greaves and Slashclaw Bracers all give hit as well. 
---
There shouldn't be any situation where Blackcrow isn't an extremely brief upgrade, at best.
---
Skeram has the same alliance pop as stalagg but with 10k less horde players, feelsstallagman
---
Wisdom of the ages..
---
If the tank dies it's the healers fault
---
If the healer dies, it's the tanks fault.
---
If the dps die, it's their own fault.
---
Lmao. These people make me pissed off. I have two accounts that I roll on one is an ah whore while the other is questing. So essentially I’m playing two account and I mail the other everything while questing to ah. 
---
They are both 40. I have seen 0 boe blues or epics drop. Like none. Tons of greens but no blues. 
---
Makes me so sad.
---
that makes two of us lol
---
It doesn’t even matter in classic my dude.  There aren’t enough abilities to worry about it.
---
Lmfao, "It's a slippery slope to retail" is not socratic reasoning. It's the literal definition of the fallacy.
---
Do not swap specs just to re-spec into different weapons. Figure out which one you want most (human=sword, orc=axe) and stick with that; or if you get a new weapon that is still an upgrade even without the 5% crit then use it anyway without respeccing. That's a ton of gold flushed down the drain on respecs.
---
My special boy
---
Classic wowhead has a list for every class and spec
---
Not the quest, i don't care for grinds, thats what i love.
---
Having my grinds being bugged multiple times though, thats not my kind of game. I find a 10 hour no stopping quest where you just grind the most monotone thing fun, afterall ive played runescape for 10 years by now. But having simple quests being bugged in multiple different ways, that shit makes me want to say fuck it.
---
This is so sad, alexa play despacito
---
At the risk of sounding pedantic, /startattack would actually engage the hunter’s melee attack.
---
The actual line in the macro would be something like /use !Auto Shot, but you are totally correct that this can lead to a lot of “oopsie” pulls. Lol
---
So you lifetap to 1hp drink eat and get to full on both? (I'm lvl 43, you're right hp easily fills but why not double up on regen if its possible)
---
Littering.
---
From what I read, no.
---
Kind of ironic considering Canada has some of the worst people around (French Canadians).
---
There's a pat. If the pat comes, help. As a priest, I mind controlled 1, which was more than enough to turn the tide on its own (though had a shaman with me). If not, help if you feel like it.
---
To be fair, that's the much nicer approach. Doing it just before you transition to the new continent makes them swim those 30s and then wait on the next boat to arrive.
---
If you need to stop between pulls more than a couple of times in a dungeon,  then a lot of people in your group are doing the wrong things.
---
if every encounter was like this i'd instantly re-roll pvp. 1v1, both full hp, 1lvl apart. i fucking wish there'd be a server style with such rulesets. meanwhile i tried to kill a aoe farming mage yesterday by enabling pvp but it didn't deal damage to me. did they change that?
---
I'm guessing you're not playing on one of the servers that's up for transfer? In my experience friends are worth it if you know you'll be playing with them. I only had one friend playing on whitemane and I got to 28 on my shaman before I just couldn't stand the queues, I wasnt able to play almost at all due to my schedule so I decided to transfer. My friend will be rolling an alt with me on arcane reaper. Probably doesn't help much, sorry. At least if you level another lock with your friends it's pretty fast!
---
Ya but it’s funny. Like a kid throwing shit at the substitute teacher but you sit in the back and just watch it happen
---
There's quite a bit in this game that could be updated without drastically changing it for the worse. No changes is a stupid stance to have. This game needs some serious QoL changes that TBC managed to introduce without changing the game for the worse. It could also stand to have some content expansion via things like Heroic dungeons with new mechanics and difficulties. 
---
There's even the possibility of new raids, or even new zones to explore(Hyjal?) to add more content to do.. 
---
Saying no changes is just stupid. I'm all for changes, so long as the integrity of the game stays intact. Everyone else should be too.
---
Must be FUCKIN nice
---
It wont be for a while. My guess is they will announce it at blizzcon and it will be sometime early 2020.
---
Specified that in my edit. My personal philosophy is based on the group I'm with. Guildies? Pass for melee. Pugs? Need roll because its bis for both of us. I don't worry about this whole "who is it more useful for" stuff unless its for the guild.
---
Mage is one of the strongest classes 1-20. And 20-60
---
If it makes you feel better, I rerolled when I was level 43.
---
Yeah you're better off adding the good tanks you've played with to your friends list. I hope you're nicer to them than you are in this thread :p
---
Fear isnt usually a good CC anyway. Good chance to pull other packs with it. So I'd use purple for banish more than fear.
---
It looked like the rogue used some CDs before coming out of stealth
---
Had a rogue try to kill me on my hunter the other day. Saw him coming (thanks Track Hidden), dropped a frost trap and kited him around a bit before he tried to vanish, while still in the frost trap.  Easiest flare I've ever thrown.
---
Ended up getting me later while I was engaged with a couple other mobs.
---
This happened to me on Northdale, a group asked for a replacement rogue to help finish their Jed/rend run. I walk into the instance run straight to rend, killed him and both del tends dropped. Not a single person needed on them and I won both and hearthed out in shock
---
&gt; 3 shaman, 12 mage.  
---
wat
---
Yes, Chopin  Nocturne in B Flat Minor, Op. 9 No. 1: "A Madame Camille Pleyel"
---
Correct, and depending on how long it takes you to get to and from the place where you have to turn in the quest, you may actually lower your xp/hour by doing so.  Some quests, even ones that give good xp, are not worth doing by dint of distance.
---
If you read the OP you'll figure out why.
---
Can someone repost this with the proper labels? Kill this target first should be on every symbol
---
Dude you really are fuckin sense or something, you can’t run a dungeon without a tank but sure as hell can without a hunter.
---
Or does your hybrid class include tanking dungeons in addition to melee and casting?
---
I looted two edgemasters last week and sold them both in under 12 hours. I don’t really understand why, I thought selling them for 20g was pretty expensive. And the strangest thing is the same guy bought both of them. 
---
What a noob there isn’t even stamina on them lul
---
That's not a secret so much as it is glaringly obvious to everyone (except for the weirdos who say you can't get to 60 with questing.) but questing will always bring you more variety than straight grinding, it's a fact, so the point of my post was to poke fun at how dumb it was for him to come out and be like "Well questing is boring... Sorry" as if they just dropped a truth bomb or something. It's preferential at the end of the day.
---
You can vanish with ff on. I had passing by druid put it on me as a joke, I vanished and ambushed him for half his health as a joke still with ff on.
---
Thanks for the clarification!
---
Corporate greed?
---
so whats the better hearth for endgame IF or Menethil
---
It might have been inconsequential to the dungeon group, but it makes you look like a moron.  Which definitely doesn't help your cause.
---
But maybe we're just getting sick of the "dear everybody else, it's all your fault I hate you, sincerely a non-prot specced tank" posts.
---
I did that but with finkles skinner at lvl 57
---
None - AoE the fuck outta this pull
---
&gt;as the costs drop more with each tier
---
Nope, not until BC or WotLK can't remember which. In Vanilla the only discount is at Honored.
---
Its sword and mace, not axe. Thats Orc’s thing
---
That rogue was a complete fucking noob and this isn’t impressive in the slightest.
---
The problem I have is that the statement is often used as A-&gt;B  B-&gt;C therefore A-&gt;Z OMG WHY WOULD YOU WANT Z?!?! YOU ARE THE WORST PERSON EVER!!!
---
Too often it's used when logical discussion would put them on the losing side. As for here, it's mostly fear. Fear that any changes will creep the experience towards what retail is like.

Except that in this case, everyone knows. Every single person knows that x material will sell, so all of the farmers are out there trying to re-layer and farming those mats as fast as they can, so there is a surplus of them. Now you have a situation completeley different from Vanilla at the start. 
---
In Vanilla, this knowledge was not widespread. Mats were high price because of supply and demand, and supply was low largely though ignorance. Now that everyone and their let monkey can Google "BiS" and it tells them exactly how to level up lw to get the plans for devilsaur leather, to farm that shit out easily, well everyone is doing it. So devilsaur leather prices drop because all the farmers (10x more than before *easily*) are trying to undercut each other. So more people can now afford BiS gear just by questing. Less elitism, people don't feel important because they had control of a limited supply, everyone is able to equip better gear and raid sooner. 
---
***THIS WAS UNAVOIDABLE*** Even without layering, people still had information and resources that they didn't posses when playing 14 years ago. More people rushed to farm the "must have" mats. This is literally capitalism at its finest. Supply and demand economies. If you're mad that your old gold mine is no longer worth it, well adapt and change to the new market

Prat has to gather that data from either seeing them in the wild or doing /who.  I used census+ to just massive /who the entire server in sections and populate the level data for Prat.  Though, I think blizzard recently broke the addon so people can't figure out realm populations.
---
Yeah, I would be lying if I said marking Skull makes DPS behave 100% better, but I do think it makes a noticeable difference for most groups.

Or when she's like "I can take it from here" and then shit respawns and dies cause you aren't at the bottom of the walkway yet
---
I though each layer had a different chat, usually when someone is complaining about getting ganked, once i get there, they are there.
---
 2-3 hours a day since launch and you should have a 60 by now. Idk how that's rushing, lol
---
Time is money. What makes your gold more valuable than someone else's time? I'm not even a mage, just perplexed at the audacity of some of the cheapskates around here.

My group freaked the hell out when that happened lol

Spriest is the best 1v1 class in the game.  You will shit on everyone in open world and in duels.   Premades with good communication you may fall behind but spriests are dumb OP 1v1
---
If you're a tank finding a group is easy.
---
I think a lot of these came back for the early cars heroics.
---
Some servers say DING! when they leveled, some say PAWANG! So idk.
---
It's just a pain in the ass.
---
Like yeah, if my neighbor parks in my driveway it's not the end of the world and I can still park somewhere but it's where I park.

Also, what's the point of ruining someones day for some shitty youtube video that's not even going to get 100 views or some internet Karma.

I'd check to ensure you've joined the /General channel. Otherwise Idk
---
What lvl and how are you specced? Im 40s and just got my spell power gear so the VW juggle rotation is not working as i easily pull aggro. Need to switch it up
---
All things being equal, I believe warlock counters spriest 1v1. All things being equal, I think hunters should also counter spriest 1v1 as well.
---
My thoughts exactly, it's already near impossible to quest in STV on  PVE server due to sheer numbers of players. Adding ganking and quest hub camping into it sounds utterly cancerous.
---
Did you download the Classic version of Elvui? Just checking because otherwise it doesn't make much sense for the addon to not show up at all.  
---
Are you putting the right folders as the top level in the add ons folder? iirc you'll need to unzip it, and then take the 2 folders and place them in your add ons folder, though I don't remember the names off the top of my head and can't check. If you have a single folder you're either missing something or you're 1 folder too high in the structure.  
---
You could also try to check load out of date addons in case it shows up on the list but isn't working.
---
If ignorance is bliss, then you must be the happiest man alive:

---
Imagine getting this angry over a plant node that’s spawns all over....
---
It's not going to be in the game until phase 3, months and months away :'(
---
Is there a way for me as a hunter to right click a mob and have it auto ranged attack? I swear there used to be a setting for this but I can’t figure it out
---
None: AOE everything anyways
---
Want to join me and my gf on the rp server? Sounds like you need a break from pvp, bud!
---
There is also nothing in the tos saying you can't complain about someone griefing lower level players on a pvp server
---
I've thought about this.  I do enjoy running dungeons, and goin in as a healer seems good for finding groups quickly.  Would it be doable to heal in low level dungeons with my talents in enhancement?
---
Dude, I’ve tested it on multiple warlock toons that I leveled to 60. imp is the way to go. And you dp between the mobs not during the actual drain tanking  🙄 I dot up one mob fear it dot up the next drain tank it in between I dp to get the mana to keep going. Succubus is stronger if you kill just one mob at the time but then you are doing it wrong anyway.
---
Coworker of mine bought a laptop just to play during a business trip the week it was released, then took the next week off lmao
---
Does this addon highlight or indicate the person is on the list if you encounter them again, or is it just a list to reference?
---
Yeah, and also the Hauted Horseman's Horse but I have to wait for the event to release and the for the ZG phase too but it is what it is what with needing luck.
---
Retail player spotted.
---
Only drinking 3 times a dungeon is not efficient, and you know this. It means the tank isn't pulling enough, or you can be pumping out more damage. Never said you don't know what you're, I said its being lazy, I've done it to, but I tend to get bored so I start casting more damaging abilities or asking the tank to grab that next pack and chain pull. I also use the 5 second rule as much as possible, but sitting at full mana on fights is not fun, and it's fun to beat dps on meters and watch them get all butt hurt.
---
Yeah, I mained a rogue from vanilla through cata and sapped way more stars than nipples.
---
If you're relying on any CC at all, just tell everyone in advance rather than expecting them to follow some "standard" that they may or may not know.
---
I've yet to see any evidence besides a screenshot of a secondhand blizzard email of any instance abusers being punished. But even still there are lots of exploits outside of instances that have neither been patched, nor punished, such as layering to buy vendor patterns with long restock cooldowns, search for high value ore deposits, AOE farm quick xp, search for rare mobs, etc. 
---
There's a mob in Arathi that has something like a 36 hr respawn timer and drops a rare trinket, should you be able to layer hop to find him faster? I don't think so, but there's no evidence that blizzard cares about this kind of thing.
---
woooosh

Streaming is easiest solution here.  Twitch automatically saves your broadcasts for two weeks and you can go into them and clip/edit clips with ease that can then be permanently stored either publicly or privately.  Of course you can accomplish the same thing without twitch,  but it would require a ton of harddrive space, separate video editing/compression software, render time, upload time, etc.  Streaming to twitch and editing the clips from there vastly simplifies the process.
---
Laggy as shit*
---
As a dps I appreciate you and always make sure I give the tank a sec to gain agro. I don’t like to run from the GY. Your dps are idiots! FYI it’s not any better on the Horde side.
---
me and my friend having the same problem on windows 10 (totally different PC setup)
---
Maybe because I did it really early, are you playing alliance or horde?
---
Because its harder for alliance players to get one and horde has access to a better one anyway, so prices might fluctuate wildly from faction/server/time.
---
But for example, flipping a coin is 50/50. Is getting heads twice in a row still 50/50? Or is it 50%x50% = 25%?
---
I remember in probability/statistics that there are many situations where you have to multiply probabilities in situations like this (although I dont remember if it was for these *exact* type of simple situations)
---
Yes it does, I’m a SUF fan myself
---
I currently have 11 days 8 hours on classic. Do the math for me, Im too lazy.
---
Are any other classes that good for AoE farming? Are warlocks just as good or nah?
---
&gt; as a 45 spriest.
---
Yeah, SPs own hunters ...
---
Nah he just popped his racial.
---
I thought you can still blow the powder, but can’t really go into stealth with FF on?
---
If you are aoe pulling, everyone is drinking after the pull anyway.
---
Mages will not spam aoe to kill a mass of mobs and come out with any more than 25% mana.
---
&lt;Willingly Suboptimal&gt; turned in Onyxia's Head last night and&lt;Sharp And Shiny&gt; turned out too. Coming around the corner with our crew and seeing *an entire raiding guild* lined up right there was one of the coolest things I've been a part of on Bloodsail Buckaroos.

Are paladins as gear and group dependant as warriors?

My FFXIV character is on Behemoth, which is the unofficial Brazilian server.  We recruited a guy from another server that was an amazing melee player. His logs were good and he rarely died to stupid stuff. Well, he transfers over and we're sitting in TS3 (this was before discord) and he mentions he's from Brazil. He stopped mid-sentence and says "Wait, there's a Brazilian fee company (guild) recruiting in chat...." and we mention that it's kind of the Brazilian server, thinking he would view this as a positive.  He did not. We were in chat for a few more hours just shooting the shit and he kept saying "WTF, another Brazilian FC..." He transferred back to Excalibur the moment his cooldown period was over.  If there's anything I learned from years of playing MMOs, it's the no one dislikes Brazilians more than fellow Brazilians.
---
Thinking of an enhancement shaman, is the elemental devastation talent any good in vanilla? Since there is no crit gear it doesn't seem very reliable.
---
Rouge*
---
It's a fairly useless question as it's going to vary huge amounts depending on what server you're on.
---
Some servers it might be 40g other servers 400g. My server in particular probably about 200g. 
---
Although it warrants a high price as is BiS for druid tanks nearly forever as far as I'm aware.
---
&gt; I like to be useful.
---
i say mage then. the conjured food/water is invaluable to other classes, and they will appreciate your slows, pulls, and DPS.
---
PvP is fun, it's the only reason I play this game.
---
Had a hunter roll on my tanking weapon because he wanted to dual wield. It didn't even have stats, it only had a proc on hit effect.
---
All the people downvoting this are clearly mountless peasants LVL 40+
---
But that's all out in the open, no deception is taking place, so it can't be a scam.
---
I thought they just broke the add-on not /who?
---
What do you mean it doesn't work? Is this why it was telling me there were 0 people in the badlands yesterday?
---
My wife would argue that me hiding out to play games while the kids are awake and leaving them with her would be a godawful marriage. We expect a lot out of each other but you get out what you put in.
---
Is princess soloable for a mage as well?
---
Remember to kill all rogues. Because someday, they'll deserve it.
---
Ahh, I see. So for single target tanking, Battles Shout is actually your best option aside from Revenge (which is opportunistic and uncontrollable).
---
Oh yeah....
---
I’ll trade him 1c for 1s
---
&gt; sprint (only 50%)
---
Not after lvl 46
---
You're aware that weapon/defense skills are automatically calculated at max skill in pvp right? ;o  
---
I can think of few things as pointless as leveling weapon skills on a twink character xD
---
Just tell people as soon as you get in the group that you are doing this for resto gear and if that is an issue let me know now so I can find a different group. Just be upfront and clear and give them the chance to agree or disagree to your terms.
---
Are you seriously dissing the graphics of a game from 2004?
---
I honestly don't get that shit. If you are organizing a group and want a specific piece, don't invite classes that will want it. Who the fuck wants to do a dungeon where someone has "reserved" their best drop from the dungeon?
---
nevermind it says right there. Elvui
---
Then u get aggro and die in one hit at 30%
---
Why is it so hard for you to accept that some tanks are bad? If you can say every dps player is stupid why can some tanks not be considered bad
---
I am not playing on the job, I can check reddit once in awhile though.
---
Much of wowhead (and icyveins) info ob Classic is wrong. Find some lists from private server forums, or ask a guildie who is familiar with such info. Traditionally retail sources aren’t going to be as intimately familiar with BiS lists in classic.
---
Not even remotely accurate.  I have gonna from SW to IF and seen far more people than this list shows just in each city in off hours.  IF obviously will have a superior presence than SW as well.
---
Honestly, unless your /who bugged, your fabricating these numbers completely.   Not to be rude, but it's just blatantly that untrue and simply logging into any of the factions main city will show this.
---
The only other option I could think that might validate this, is if you got stuck in a tiny layer there.  The server is very healthy and well.
---
I mean, the alternative is that they just don’t invite classes to the group that can use the item. 
---
Like I had a corpsemaker already and was applying to rfk groups. You get a lot more invites when a shaman/warrior knows that they won’t have competition for that big-ticket drop. 
---
I don’t reserve loot, but when I make my groups, you can bet your ass I’m going to heavily prioritize classes that don’t compete with me.

I was on Dragonmaw and there was a guild that had a GM who was a Loot Ninja. They'd attempt to pug MC's but after about three weeks of him always trying to give himself the bindings for TF no one would run a PUG MC run w/him his guild.

Thank layering for this.

Technically, the “bug“ that allowed players to get a higher amount of XP, was fixed.

Not surfing the web at age 3 won't cripple my children anymore than it crippled you. People are pretty smart.

World pvp is fun, but just sitting around in a big group, 2 shotting anyone who comes near you. How is that fun? Seems boring as fuck

This... SO MUCH this...

I'd pay 45 gold for it. On my server its 300g but I think it's just one guy trying to charge that much. Very little tank druids 50+.

Look how the topic is HOT!
---
Doesn't sound like the school for my kids.
---
240g is a fair price you might be able to push that to around 350-400 but it depends on your server and how long you are willing to wait.
---
Pull shit into his farm.
---
AoE farming is only efficient way ahead of the zerg on fresh servers.
---
DM isn't even out, most pserver mage farms dont work (i.e. BRD spectators)..
---
Mages are not some god class in the game that this shit sub makes them out to be. They are B tier til P2, then maybe A, then S tier way in phase 4/5.

I've played long enough that groups are happy to rid themselves of self-important idiots, regardless of role, and that's the truth.
---
Unlike current retail WoW, your character/reputation matters now and reasonable people conduct themselves reasonably. Idiots that spread toxicity are not absolved because of their role/spec.
---
You most likely wouldn't have gotten it sold for 10 g anyway.
---
Like the other commenters mentioned this varies GREATLY from server to server.  
---
400g or so on mine.
---
i have a mage at 60 but ok lol
---
No.
---
I've only ever reported racial slurs. I could care less if someone has a variation of "dick" or "ass" in their name.

But even if they hit all holes-in-one, wouldn't they just tee up from the start again with all that spare time? Is a longer game more golf, or are more, shorter games more golf? 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
---
Almost rolled a priest only bc if mc but I don’t like healing
---
Yeah, It's been 50/50 for me on procs and the proc breaking a CC effect. Sometimes the damage breaks it entirely and sometimes the damage just happens and the CC just goes on without a care, either way the proc is always applied after the CC, and is pretty annoying.
---
That's pretty low xp/hour at 39, especially for aoe grind.  Need to aoe larger packs than 3-4.  If resists are in issue try mobs 1-2 levels below whatever you're fighting now.
---
On my shaman I have a separate rank 1 earth shock mouseover macro. Whether I'm dps or heals, doesn't matter, I'm watching for casters (especially healers) and shocking that from range. The added benefit is they will then run to the group.
---
Wait your flair is confusing me. Is the horde or alliance healthy? Or both?

When my Hunter melees it holds the arrows from it's quiver and smacks the target.

You gotta make sure to destroy the mines the dark iron guys place. They have about 10 second fuse time before doing huge aoe damage. Have a dps dedicated to destroying all of those and focus the dark irons first, you'll be just fine.
---
Yes it's a twink character. Arguably it's still a colossal waste of time, but I just felt compelled :P
---
Aight.
---
I wished I was on an rppvp server, but I'd rather play where my friends are... But I wish I had...
---
AFAIK they're maxed in battlegrounds, but not in world pvp. I might be wrong though... need to test

Or just run w a Uber geared pally tank.  Which is like finding a needle in a haystack...
---
That Spider is Huge. Where does it spawn?
---
“Every N levels?” What does that mean?

So like 15-20 seconds of GCDs? That's all? No biggie right?

Maybe watch some educational videos about finding a healthy middle ground. Your children wont have an easy time growing up without any knowledge of the modern world ...

I want to... take the .. bait. Must resist....
---
Yeah I looked and it appears like a rather lame thing is that scorpids in general use 20 or below poison. I found anti venom slightly misleading as I thought poison used would roughly match the mob level but it appears like poison level matters more for PvP or something.
---
That looks like elvui
---
So your solution is to send high horde pop PVP server players to low horde pop over servers? Why would anyone take that transfer? 
---
Also wow pop info is a week out of date at this point so PVP server imbalance has definitely become worse since the 2nd round of transfers.

Anyone can find montages to justify a play style. I can post multiple links too but it’s pointless. You can easily use frostbolts in PvP as a mage and be perfectly viable and fine.

Layer hopping- classic wow uses a system of "layers" to spread their players out through several different layers so you don't have 20 people on the same quest at once competing for the same mobs. To change layers, ask guildies or friends for an invite to a party in hopes that they're on a different layer than you. Note that it doesn't always work the first invite if they're already on the same layer as you, and that if you do it several times in a row a layer cooldown will be imposed.

Crashing is when instead of layer hopping you choose to compete for the same AoE mobs. In certain cases where the spots are packed crashing is unavoidable but it's considered good etiquette to layer hop or find a different spot than to compete for mobs if there are only enough spawns to support 1 aoe farm because both players would just get bad exp
---
I dont think so
---
I mean ... the voiceover in the game is prob correct ...
---
It is deception. How are you not grasping this? Some one gift wraps something and puts 5g price tag on it to open it up, you would expect something worth some amount of gold. But you only realize you spent 5g and got something worth 5 copper.
---
Nope. I've played every class in the past, know what I like. Rolled priest to 60. Next will be warlock, then warrior. Probably just lvl35 and bg twink alts after that.
---
When I did it I got quest completion credit as soon as he reached the front of the castle he was in.  I didn't have to escort him through the town and I never saw the scene where he dies.  So, it's pretty buggy.
---
You can actually use this on any app, just use the shortcut and tag it as game. If it doesn't work just Google it. Maybe an app of ms store is missing for you.

Why are you crawling through my post history then? The world belongs to the people that reproduce. I'm not going to get pulled into a conversation about the merits of Islam on a thread about gaming though.

You can think whatever you want.

Typical every faction pvpserver player. None are welcome 😾

This so weird I used to be like this but after I hit 40 I just got bored idk why. Now I’m playing retail(haven’t played since cata) and having a bit more fun but idk anymore

Missed the boat twice yesterday

I'd like to change the default toggle keybind from LALT to GRAVE/TILDE. Your addon does a much better job of allowing the user to stay in mouselock and maintain core gameplay functionality such as looting and interacting with npcs. My problem is that I use LALT for keybinds. I play a warlock and have more than myself I need to control.
---
OMG you're on a PVE server and still didn't help him. Very cruel.
---
Yup, this is a horrible fate for both sides. The problem is there's a lot of aggressive Horde players who think "LUL WE WON ALLY SCUM NOOBS" not realizing how much of a detriment it is to their own server and future gameplay.
---
This is why I rerolled to Alliance on Skeram from Horde. It just sucks that Alliance are leaving in droves
---
TSM uses regional values, so it's pulling data from prices of other servers via the desktop client.
---
Depends on how you travel, if you go through woods and clear mobs while traveling it’s really effective to quest/grind.
---
I'm pretty sure this is why blizz added cross-realm grouping and server groups. Low pop servers didnt have enough numbers to keep players playing since they could never find a group. So they decided to group servers and let them play with each other. I just know from vanilla when I played on illidan that high pop servers (despite having a queue to get in at times) would always have people to play with.
---
Not all of them, but some can be done with up to 10 players https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Instances_by_level
---
Close! Just change that 'i' to an 'a' and you've got it. :)
---
IKR people trying to claim horde bias because we are close to SM.  Meanwhile Blackrock Mountain and 90% of endgame is across the street from Stormwind.
---
Beg to disagree. No PvP trinket means I can 1v1 them until things get dangerous as a cat. Powershift to bear and bash. Full heal and back to cat. Faerie fire prevents the fuckers from running away  lol
---
I like the style but the top two graphics are based off different ranges (91-99 and 90-99). Just picking
---
Actually same!   
---
I'm glad that wasn't it though, that wouldn't be nearly as funny in my opinion (but comedy is pretty subjective)
---
Check the chat box
---
Thank you. Very kind.
---
Reminds me of how when MoP came out i made a BE monk, had all abilities macroed to yell attack names when used. Didn't last more than 5 minutes in any dungeon group:(. Like, what's even the point of playing a monk if you're not shouting your attacks!
---
You sound like a very responsible father and husband. Much respect, my man
---
How do you get these numbers to show up on ur character
---
Beep boop
---
You are using overpower instead of revenge while tanking and complaining about losing aggro my dude.
---
&gt; I'd like to change the default toggle keybind from LALT to GRAVE/TILDE
---
It's no possible to do this at the moment, sorry! You can easily change it to another **modifier key** though. Open the file ClassicActionCombat.lua, and on line #236, replace "LALT" with any of the following values: "LSHIFT", "RSHIFT", "LCTRL", "RCTRL", "LALT", "RALT".
---
In this meta its "I'm so happy to finally be done grinding *these* dungeons so I can finally start grinding *those* dungeons lmao.
---
Exactly this. The big boon of having Broken Tooth is have having 1 less talent point in frenzy for PvE. The spell pushback between 1.2 and 1.0 isn't that different once you bring in attacks from the hunter and hunter pets using abilities.
---
Folks that are really concerned with pet dps need to go get Lupos from Duskwood because his attack bypass armor, thanks to being shadow damage.
---
you cant spam it to magically score aggro, but its still effective
---
Especially since he said it happened before he knew it, to me that implies it wasn't planned in advance.  I can't imagine giving my boss hardly any notice that I'm going to be gone for a week straight.
---
Where is the idea coming from that the internet is the only way to learn???
---
It was some kingsblood type AB-Negative lol
---
6\*
---
I feel you man. Those days of getting home from work and thinking "I don't know what to play" are gone, and I can't wait to log in. I took a week off at launch and my guild just cleared 8/10 MC and downed Onyxia for our first raid week. Only reason we aren't 10/10 is due to the rep grind required for last 2 bosses in MC. I'm the main tank, an officer in the guild, I constantly run dungeons to get more and more people full pre raid bis so the raids run smoother, starting to do raid logging again, working on a website, getting out guild charter set up, rules put into place, select class leads, and by this weekend we will have not one group clearing MC, but likely 2. It is all I can think about. I love it.
---
Best area to mobfarm for a lv35 horde hunter? Skinnable mobs would be great.
---
It wasnt so bad when I was 30-40.  
---
But then again I was ahead of the curve by decent amount so might be that.
---
Got mine 2 days ago! Was via fishing and devilsaur gear sales!
---
So now that people are getting to 60, can anyone confirm whether or not you get a free copy of BfA for making it?
---
That's an interesting point, over the years I've come to use ganking as attacking without a reason / without pravocation, IE just to start PvP. 
---
Typically where I don't consider it a gank is if there is a resource (node, quest mob, etc) and you are fighting over it.
---
But you do raise a valid point, I think that was implied to be the original meaning of gank.
---
So Warrior is not to hard to learn (Tank) and gear? Anyway thanks for the reply:)
---
Wow cool info link thanks, BRS it is then.
---
Sap for me, since vanilla as a Rogue has always been star. Shackle was circle and banish/fear was diamond.
---
But that's exactly what I'm saying. You cant just win in cat form. You have to switch to bear and druid forms to get cc and heals off..
---
What addon did you use to track CC like sap?
---
Yes, we are responsible for all the skeletons in the back.
---
Generally speaking everyone rolls for the chest. Lockpicking is just another utility that's brought to the group. Rogues open locks, priests bring fort, mages bring int and food. I'd kick any rogue who thinks they don't need to roll for a chest from my group - or alternatively they don't get any heals, buffs or food because that's the equivalent to thinking that any locked chest is theirs.
---
Lol @ pally tanks
---
I have a couple of partners. I should've clarified that. What about my story is so unbelievable to you? That I have a family? or that I wake up early?
---
No. A rogue stealthed nearby is just that.
---
This I need answered aswell!
---
Warrior gear seems to be the most common drop so far for us.
---
One clear so far and we have 7 pieces of war gear. 5 to mt and 2 to ot.
---
I'm on that quest but nobody runs scholo.  I've yet to see anyone forming a scholo group and I've run all the other 60 dungeons multiple times.
---
Because you can tank perfectly fine as arms in 5 man content and still do good damage when you are questing. 
---
Your first respec is cheap anyway, worst case it will cost you 1g at 60 to go prot, and in the mean time you don’t really loose any tangible tanking ability if you level as arms.
---
As a horde on Thunderfury I find world pvp pretty balanced. There are lots of players on both sides. And a lot of times on our server people don't even fight.
---
*shield and walk up to caster* 
---
You're talking mad shit for somebody within crusading distance!!
---
Idk what you mean
---
Counter Point : I want to hit 60 and just sit outside of Org dueling all day. Endless entertainment, always something different.
---
Doesn’t the linken Quest chain give you linkens boomerang which is extremely useful for Paladin tanks to allow them to ranged pull?
---
Get as much as you can before Phase 2 hits.  The value will collapse after that due to the tribute hammer being basically equal quality to it for druid tanking.  
---
Right now, you should be able to get 200-400 for it, I wouldn't hold my breath after Phase 2 though, it's really hard to say how much people will consider expensive for being a .965% upgrade over the DM hammer when averaged against each other.
---
First big red flag. Rogue was spotted being stealthy for a while before the druid opened up on him.
---
Hm. I didnt notice this bug when I did a gnomer run last week, the mines stayed out for a while before dying and/or exploding.
---
So you’re saying you and the people who leave the server causing it to directly be more unblanced are blameless and the people not choosing to reroll are to blame?
---
You could sell all that shit off and buy WoW tokens for Classic game time
---
He had all the wrong poisons on.
---
The only thing I really enjoyed from that in the end that I would bother with was the goblins.  But that's mostly because from a young age I was a fan of Warhammer Fantasy goblins and similar material(including WC2 goblin tech).
---
^(Did you contact Blizzard?)
---
Damn Noobz nice story mate.
---
Yes. The only difference is I took what you said about a group of people and replaced it with another group of people. The argument there is still yours.
---
Also you dont need fancy macros or anything to assign shapes to targets. It's in the default key bindings, I have these shapes assigned to F1-F10 keys for example.
---
People assumed I could poly anything. The blink bug. Too many mages to gear quickly (10 other mages = no gear for you). 
---
Respec costs for pvp. (Everyone has that). Decursing.
---
I personally don't rly think ranged pull is important , but I guess yes it does.
---
I also had tailoring/enchanting and I had to stop disenchanting greens and quest rewards and started vendoring them. I still didnt get my mount until 44
---
Tyvm!
---
Yeh the rogue is walking past in stealth it us only after the moon fire he attacks
---
For dungeons you could argue that lock is just as useful. Summons and soulstone are both HUGE, and they have a lot of other nice things as well. I think either is a fine choice if you want to be useful as a dps.
---
What about mind control?
---
How did you have mana for this? I remember my old Tauren Druid on a private vanilla server going oom after like... 2 form changes
---
Weren't they when they created vanilla?
---
When leveling in instances If warlocks annoy you.
---
For healers, have me as the lowest priority for heals. Don't really need health if pace in instance is low. A renew every now and then if you have nothing else to spend your mana on is good enough. But be aware what your really doing is giving me more mana.
---
And for warriors just pull already. Don't need mana either.
---
If pace in instance is quick it's because there's mages there as well and then we play another game because there's water involved.
---
So basically just ignore us. And pull already.
---
Proper etiquette is for the rogue to lie, and say they haven't leveled lockpicking. Once the dungeon is clear,   they will go back and collect all the loot for themselves.
---
Personally, I agree with the group rolling, just like a standard chest. The rogue can't get there without party support, so they should get a chance at the loot as well.
---
As an shaman who is pre-40, will I get crap for rolling on the Scarlet Monastery mail armor if I can’t wear it yet?
---
What about rolling on Ravager against a warrior?
---
Off-topic...anyone know what UI mod this person is using?
---
Skull - AOE
---
X - AOE
---
Square - AOE
---
Moon - AOE
---
Triangle - AOE
---
Diamond - AOE
---
Circle - AOE
---
Star - AOE
---
I will not argue that point haha, good luck!
---
This story works better if we have an idea of what faction you are.
---
Sure sure, you do you.
---
That looks correct. Did you drag this button from the macro window to your toolbar, replacing your existing Immolate button?
---
I never stop the group though. I'm drinking as soon as I'm out of combat and the tank can go to the next pull and I'll just get up when he needs healing, is what I mean.
---
I'm doing fine.
---
Where do you get this number from? I've seen people regurgitating it and it feels pulled out of someone's ass to make themselves feel better about lvling slowly, in the wowhead classic census from 11 days ago (the numbers are probably higher now) it was already like 5% lvl 60s on most servers
---
&gt;A crit starved warrior is fated to suffer and all leveling warriors are crit starved.
---
And it's not any better with axe specialization so you may as well do more damage. 
---
&gt;Plus you don't get to assume you'll be DPSing while leveling. Arms is such a better dungeon tank spec it's ridiculous.
---
I don't know why you keep saying this, it doesn't make any sense and nobody is talking about specs. If you aren't tanking AND topping damage in your dungeon, you are doing something wrong.
---
Either Arms or Fury is fine to spec as while leveling. You can easily throw on a shield to tank dungeons as well. 
---
As someone who just leveled a warrior to 60 over the last few weeks.... 
---
I would recommend doing what is most fun for you. Honestly all the guides tell you to use a 2-hander always. I got soooooooo bored of the slow swings, then the occasions when you miss 2+ swings in a row and are just sitting there for a good 7+ seconds doing nothing with little to no rage. Ugh
---
After not receiving a decent 2-hander upgrade for about 10 levels I switched to dual wielding fury. I never looked back. I kill things just as fast if not faster. Seems to be more reliable overall since you are swinging more often. Sure you miss, a lot, but it all evens out. After switching I also was able to chain more mob pulls together and seemed to have a way higher sustain than with 2-handers.
---
In short though: Arms/Fury 2-hander/dual wielding all work well, just do what is most fun for you. Just don't level prot, unless you want to punish yourself.
---
Everyone rolls for it and the rogue should unlock, then let whomever won the roll collect the loot. Much in the same way that mages are usually expected to provide food/water to the party, rogues should be unlocking chests and lock boxes. Its part of their class utility. Saying its theirs by default is bad form. That is like a tank saying he should keep all the boss loot because you couldn't do the dungeon without them.
---
Yeah I did get a little butthurt that there were whole mob groups dying before I could even dmg them, but I didnt complain because the run was going so smoothly. After I got out of my own head, my only fear was annoying the tank when I was absent for a mob group. I grew envious of the no downtime the rogue had, in comparison to myself. I took solace in seeing the overall dungeon damage and I was a close second, however. All in all great run and i hope to play with that tank again.
---
I've always done Star as Sap (I guess yellow class colour = rogue) but otherwise looks about right!
---
Agreed. Bringing a rogue is a perk for the group. It’s unlikely they could get it solo, therefore it goes to the group for a roll.
---
How do I set my battle net forum character to my classic character? I only get my BFA scrubs
---
Server transfers and the size of the population means that reputation  means jack shit.  Since your name is Everquest, I'll assume that you played that game.  Your reputation mattered in that game.  This is nothing remotely close.  People spam the names of ninjas and maybe your guild has a list or something but that's it.  The vast majority of players do not visit the forums nor are they curating their own lists of toxic players that they got from the super legitimate source of /2.
---
You seem pretty salty (Not sure where the self-important idiots thing came from) - why?  **What are these idiot healers demanding that you find so offensive?**
---
Most of the gripes I see from healers are 1) you aren't letting me drink and 2) you are going stupid with aggro and it's tough to heal.
---
1.  This is a game mechanic.  if you do not enjoy mana then complain to Blizzard.
---
2. DPS meters.  In games like EQ, a dps would get yelled at if they constantly pulled aggro from the tank.  In WoW, it's all about the meters.  I \*rarely\* see anyone bitched at for pulling aggro unless they are doing stupid shit like shocking on pull.  If they go nuts as soon as mobs is in camp though?  Tanks are expected to (fruitlessly) get aggro and the healer needs to bring their A game to chain heal the cloth who can't be bothered to properly manage aggro.
---
It's not being self-important to expect that people play the game correctly.
---
My main healers are resto shamans or holy priests. I know them both in real life. They both run out of mana real quick when they spam heal me because it just seems like I take so much damage. I only reduce 38% of physical damage with my armor, so my increased health pool just makes it seem like I'm a more of a heal sponge than tank. I just got frenzied regeneration which should help as well, I just had no defensive buttons before level 36.
---
Why 1 in 25? Assuming 5 rolls in a party of 10?
---
Some people have an odd aversion to wearing "not fitting gear for the class". Even when it would not be noticeable. Had a holy pally in a dung the other day and they decided not to need on cloth bracers of healing with +28 healing on them. I was surprised so I inspected him and saw he had mail bracers of healing with only +18. I asked why he did not need on them and he said. "I don't want to wear cloth. I'd rather only use mail and plate". 
---
I get the general idea but...m8. He was even full holy spec not off-healing.
---
Paladins are very good for PVP. They enable other classes and are the sole reason why Alliance are so good at organized PVP. Plus you wear plate, so the "focus the healer" strategy doesn't work so well on you. 
---
Alliance premades pretty much require a paladin and you can easily find a role in any pug. Your best bet is to follow around a warrior to provide heals, blessing of freedom, dispels, etc. 
---
Paladins and warriors are basically the kings of group PVP. Solo is totally different, though.
---
Starting as Fury is a lot better because you get cruelty and piercing howl.
---
But Arms is *THE* tank spec for leveling. Plus stance dancing is fun.
---
I saw alot of boe's drop few epics nothing that great. I also grinded to level 90 % of the time. If you end up doing dungeons or questing for alot of your XP you won't see anywhere near as many boe's. If you are grinding all your xp that's just dog shit unlucky to 0 boe blues or epics.
---
Your melee
---
This. Never seen nipple and star used on mobs and I have been playing since 2006. Circle and star have always been MT/OT or MT/MH
---
MAGE LFG - SPELLCLEAVE SM CATH
---
i don’t know if that’s possible right now
---
In classic you can fill heal and tank roles even without the proper talent spec. It won't be as good as the specialized thing of course but most of the time enough.
---
yh 10 gold is a overkill and merchants dream , there is like 4+ of that item daily in AH.
---
engineering or alchemy
---
No, its the 25 horde sitting at neutral quest zones griefing far outnumbered alliance players ruining it. World PvP is great and fun, griefing is bullshit and toxic and if you abuse the imbalance you deserve a dead server
---
Unless you get a really good polearm or simply can't get an axe.
---
Why are hit and crit gear so important? To me it seems a 1% increase in chance to hit on a spell or attack are just 1% increases in DPS. Is there something else at play here?
---
But why would you assume a large cod means large value?
---
best in town
---
Yep agreed.  If nothing else it saves a lot of healer mana and makes you less likely to die!
---
That’s what I thought, thanks for confirming :)
---
Jokerd was doing BRD solo AoE farm yesterday if you watch his vod. Although he did need to wait for Ice block to be up so he could stack the mobs on the pull.
---
Lol I'm glad someone said it.
---
You’ll also see druids in a lot of tier gear. Our raid group only had 1 Druid for the first week of raiding, 4 pieces of t1 dropped in MC and t2 head from onyxia. He got them all automatically haha.
---
How would they "check the loot table"
---
I play WoW in Fullscreen Windowed and Windows doesn't recognize it unfortunately
---
Cant figure out how to AOE grind... sigh
---
Im trying to accumulate as much downvotes as possible because people think I was being serious
---
Look, this is true to a point, but on some servers the Horde to Alliance imbalance is causing LEGITIMATE problems that shouldn't be dismissed with "lol you rolled on PvP server and are complaining about PvP."
---
Both sides are going to suffer, the Alliance for being forced off the imbalanced servers, and the Horde when there are no Alliance left for WPvP.
---
I agree through poly being moon, everything else is whatever.
---
Look, I'm gonna stop responding, it seems to me that you've been lucky so far with your groups and I hope for you it stays that way. If berserker rage worked every time for you for example, that's great. It doesn't work when as soon as you pop it there's a blizzard on your mobs or a whirlwind from a warrior or whatever other kind of aoe. That's a fact.
---
4 out of the 6 things you listed earlier require aggro or at least rage. For example, how am I going to position mobs if I don't have aggro? Very simple.
---
I'm aware of demo shout, I'm aware of battle shout. I was at no point worrying about the healer though as literally the second I pulled the other dps pulled aggro and a healer can't out aggro that.
---
Sometimes I didn't even get to pull as the dps did instead. In these situations the only thing that helps is communication, no amount of skill or knowledge of your class can offset a dps doing 250 dps while you do 60. It's that simple.
---
And I realize I'm at fault too in this situation. I didn't to my full abilities try to communicate to the other party members how I would like pulls to go. That is the truth.
---
But I sat through it because it was working out okay for most of the dungeon and I'd just rather avoid a shit storm with 3 \~50lvl dps that at this point have had a lot of dungeon experience where they did the exact same thing. (otherwise they wouldn't be doing it)
---
No he means in the arms tree. Axes while leveling is still better for humans even with their racial.
---
who the hell talks like that, seriously.... 
---
And I bet you're a useless rogue? whats your point? other then proving you're a 12 year old throwing tantrums on a forum.
---
Kudos for seeing the big picture =P  As a tank I appreciate a smooth run no matter WHAT is happening =p  
---
impatience leads to Chaos.  Chaos leads to WIPES.  WIPES lead to *suffering*
---
I snuck onto the STV UC Zepp one time and started throwing people to their deaths
---
I was doing gnome last night with a pally tank.  I'm a rogue and much higher level than the pally.  I let him take him down about 10 percent before I jumped in.  Was nice because I could pickpocket stuff while waiting to unleash a crit ambush.
---
Sure! I'll  PM you!
---
RNGesus.
---
I'm sure he has the original Lion King in VHS
---
I think you pretty much have it there.... misspelling maybe on Berserker?
---
One thing I am interested in with this is how people are being notified Overpower is available while in Berserker Stance... is there an add-on that alerts you?  I know Asmon has something that pops up a big &lt;OVERPOWER&gt; or &lt;REVENGE&gt; message on his screeen - but not sure what add-on that is.
---
I get that. 
---
I do want to level both.
---
I just kind of get worried that it will be difficult to find groups willing to take me as a druid, while I can just slot in to any group as a mage.
---
Completely even 1v1 fight with full HP and people call it a gank ...
---
Also loving the shit talk on the rogue, cause we all start as pro and a mid level player should do everything perfectly.
---
Solid play by the druid though for sure.
---
Huge +1, mages are in demand for early MC clears because they don’t need much gear and bring good dps.  Once people start getting geared they won’t bring as many mages. And there are waaay too many mages currently.
---
As a horde skeram here it's not like we want this, most of us really want a healthy world pvp especially when phase two hits. Blizzard is doing nothing to regulate faction balance and it pisses me off too. Not sure what the solution to this problem is :/
---
Good write up. Essentially you are correct in your thinking.  As a group, you have to do whatever is needed to accomplish the goal. Who cares about dps meters, multiple party wipes is significantly slower. 
---
That being said it sounds like you are arms spec. And you're also not overlevelled. Which means you'll always have trouble with threat if your melee dps classes use any kind of cleaves. TPS as arms is just not all there tbh man. Also what everyone else saying is true. When I tank I don't taunt off of dps like that. When I heal I don't heal dps who pop orc racial and intentially go balls deep at the start of a fight. I let people learn through repair bills if communicating doesn't work. 
---
At any rate, you should feel annoyed but you should also understand the limitations of an arms warrior aoe tanking ability. Which means you have to communicate (something you admitted to not doing) or you are to blame some too. 
---
Good luck in the future!!
---
Feels like an AA meeting in here, but I agree - I’ve also fallen back into the WOW addiction and I’m trying to back away from the game because it’s a noticeable change.
---
Started off at the end of high school / college, years ago - made wow friends, became part of the best alliance raiding guild on our server, cleared nax before tbc, rank 12 pvp, etc. but I was also failing classes, social life suffering, no long term career set out.
---
Decided at the time it wasn’t worth it, ebayed my toon for close to $2 grand, dropped wow cold turkey. Was in withdrawal for a bit, made another account but luckily never got back into it. Didn’t even blink at the new expansions, just read about them briefly but never looked back.
---
Now classic is back, I’m in a much different life now, great job, wife, 2 kids and I decided hey I’ll play casually with some old friends, definitely won’t raid, didn’t want the commitment. 
---
Few weeks in and I find myself rushing to 60 to raid with the guild and to get geared up for pvp. I’ve sunk more hours into this game in 3 weeks than all gaming I’ve done for the last 8 years. I’m working from home and find myself logging in just to finish that one quest or run a quick dungeon.
---
I think there is a way to play this game casually but it comes with the expectation that you won’t be the best, you won’t have the best gear or be the best pvp team on the server. You won’t get world firsts and be swimming in gold. You won’t have randoms coming up and fawning over your gear. I think once you can recognize this then playing wow casually is possible - and hopefully I can get more into this mindset
---
Just wanted to say, I feel your pain.  I cleared lowbers 24 times and killed just the ogre 27 times for gloves and pants.  51 times in total.  I ran lowbers pretty much exclusively from 55 to 60 and then some.
---
After around my 10th full clear, before I had either pieces, I started forming my own groups.  I avoided running with other cloth when possible and verified needed drops with similar classes.  On run 14, the gloves dropped, and there were no other clothies beside my healing priest wife.  I was elated.  Then the elemental shaman that I explicitly verified that he did not need the gloves rolled and won.  When I asked him why he rolled and reiterated that he said he only wanted the robe, he said he thought the group was for scholo.  On the wyvern to BRM.  I coulda shanked that bitch.
---
That's like 1% of players. The vast majority of players aren't 60 yet.
---
Warlock. Great at pvp, useful in raids, great solo leveler, very good for gold farming (solo Mauradon), always appreciated in dungeons for utility as well as good dps. And you don't have to stop to drink every 12 seconds.
---
Bleach is sweet nectar tho

I second this.  There is what seems to be a huge bias that if you are spec'ed arms and tanking while leveling you are doing it wrong. The opposite is more accurate, until about level 51, Arms is much more efficient than Prot.
---
Doors and corners, kid. Doors and corners.
---
&gt;You're saying the only point to BoEs is the gold that they're worth. But they're worth gold because people want them. People want them so that they can use them. If people want to use them, they aren't just gold. They're items that people want to equip.
---
The people that buy expensive boes either have excess gold or are just not very smart. It is almost never a good idea to equip an expensive boe. That is just an objective fact.
---
&gt;You're also assuming that everyone in the group is going to roll need, which assumes that everyone has the same mentality that you have, and that's just also not true.
---
Everyone will roll need because nobody wants to get ninja'd, duh. If you actually greed on a boe epic regardless of your opinion on boe=gold, you are dumb.
---
&gt;If you run in groups where everyone rolls need on everything, then that's fine, carry on. I'm just saying, in general, in pugs, people don't like when you roll need on stuff that you're just gonna sell. It's faulty logic to suggest the BoEs are just gold, and it's faulty logic to roll need on things that should be greed. If you discuss with the group that everyone is gonna roll need and everyone is cool with that, then you've found a group that you fit into well, and the point is moot.
---
Most groups would actually say that someone needing on a boe when everyone else greeded is ninja'ing regardless of if you can use it, and that you should always need to stop them anyways.
---
Worthless without the honor system.  
---
Good practice none the less.
---
I actually think being outnumbered is a blast.  Way more fun to win an occasional 2v4 or 3v5 than the other way around.
---
You really don’t understand the comments lol
---
I'm gonna catch downvotes for this but It's true. 
---
*Axe spec is better even for humans*
---
At least while leveling when you have bad gear and a good weapon.
---
I’m 46 and I know I’m behind from past leveling speeds I did on Pservers,   But to tell you the truth I don’t care.    I’m having to much fun pvping that I forget what a quest is when I see red.
---
Thank you so much for the feedback! :D   
---
I will be looking into getting a better mic sometime within the next month or so. Thank you so much again for your suggestions and feedback! It means so much and helps a lot! :D
---
Anyone know what Blizzards stance on people buying this in order to re-sell on ebay?
---
Relax guys im sure he’ll be fine lol. If gaming is such a serious problem maybe you two shouldnt do it
---
Quested/Dungeon/Grinded in that order. All 3. I'm a warrior as well which is the worst class to level lol.
---
What specialty of leatherworking...
---
My heart always skips a beat when I get a big stam buff on my pvp server. I always think I'm getting ganked.
---
After I realize I've just been buffed I'll look around for someone to thank, but half the time they're already gone.
---
From me to you, thanks.
---
Signed, the mid 20s orc who runs for cover every time he's  given big fortitude.
---
honestly I have been 60 since day 15 after launch, there are more instance runs in the SM- BRD range than ever before.  Only the top 5% of the population is level cap by my estimate.
---
Don't worry about it. Play at your own pace.

"Many programmers didn't even see a computer until they were in their teens or 20s" I'd like to see where this "fact" comes from, as I do not believe it has any validity, as well as if you are referring to the first programmers, ofc they had no prior computing experience and it was literally punching cards not anywhere near the difficulty that we have in today's programming. You are shooting your kids in the foot based on your inability to control your own impulses, that's imo bad parenting.
---
Shadow reach is incredibly useful in PvP. It directly translates into dealing more damage to melee before they close the gap and, against casters, enables you to outrange them with mind blast and SW:P. The improved radius on mindflay can also help deny those trying to close the gap on you
---
you won't be able to complete quests and XP is nerfed.
---
Its no rush to 60. Sit back and enjoy the time you are able to play. You will find plenty of raids when you hit 60. Use the time you are able to play the game to enjoy the game. A MAJORITY of the player base are still not 60 so you are by no means behind.
---
I was thinking of leveling my alt as balance. I'd love your input on your experience leveling up when it comes to mana and time efficiency? How often do you go oom? How often do you melee?
---
* I've played a bit with the talent calculator and I don't think I can justify going 10 points into *Improved Moonfire / Vengeance* over 6 points into *Natural Weapons / Omen of Clarity.* My logic is that you probably end up doing a lot of melee to save mana, and that your spell crit is probably too make full use of *Vengeance* anyway.
---
* My current idea of a leveling build would be to go for *Insect Swarm / Reflection* rather then going deep balance to grab *Moonglow :*  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/410005301--0505031](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/410005301--0505031)
---
There was a warrior on my server who legit would tank dungeons for us without a ranged weapon. We would just pull for him but man it was hilarious.
---
it's a little better than people give it credit for, if you just make sure you always have a blue 2H that's regularly updated. Which isn't too hard since you don't need to buy your first mount.
---
Had a shaman need roll and won Robes of Argual. As a clothie I was sad.
---
I am 35 now and probably won’t run Armory for another level or two, just thinking and planning ahead
---
I play a pally tank and have to explain to mages and fury warriors and  hunters all the time. NOT to AoE till the first consecrate is gone. 
---
One consecrate + ret aura gives me enough threat to hold aggro till the enemies are almost dead. If they start AoE too soon I don't gain threat and it's very likely the healer pulls aggro, or another dps, causing un-needed deaths.
---
These guys let me know by telling me to wait and pointing at the elite through emote.
---
"it was sick"
---
Lmao twitch kiddo
---
I use diamond to mark and keep an eye on pat. Now every warlock is going to start fearing patrol at random. 
---
Jk, my server doesn’t have warlocks.
---
Play it by ear. It's not worth losing the composition of the team for a chest.
---
Im almost 23 and loving it, relax and enjoy the game.
---
Same boat, i picked hunter purely because i love the idea of taming pets, but the stereotypes aren't easy to get rid of and people expect me to be a shithead anyway
---
I mean when we're talking pve your viewpoint is a bit skewed. The rogue is as much of aauto attack bot as the hunter. SS to 5, SnD. Repeat. You rarely have the energy to weave in a second finisher outside of AR/Tea/Renataki , and even if you do get the gear to throw in evis/garrotte that's still just an extra button, taking your rotation to 3 buttons. And while you'll have to pool energy sometimes, most of the time you're just wamming SS as soon as that yellow number shows 40. As a hunter your rotation consist of weaving in your spells in between your swing timers so you don't clip your autos, and if you want to take it to the next level you also weave in raptor strikes in between cooldowns. Håunters have a low skill floor, but their ceiling is as high as most classes. And you're not just relying on your autos and pet in pvp,. You rely on proper kiting, pet management, fd, traps, flare, stings, interrupts, and your special shots. And the occasional melee ability. You have a fighting chance vs most classes without being dominating, but it requires strategy and proper cooldowns. 
---
I'm making it sound like hunter is da bomb, but most classes are complex to play well in pvp. Rogue is no different, you have an arsenal of tools to make sure thta you dictate how the fight plays out, and the control is an amazing feeling if you enjoy the strategy aspect. These two classes in particular are the two that I've always played since vanilla and I love both of them to death. They're the two archetypes I tend to gravitate towards in every game I pick up, and I know that wow is to blame. I decided to go priest this time around, but both my hunter and rogue alt has hit 30 -.-
---
The downside to hunter is that vs equally geared and skilled players, you'll not be competing for a top dps spot in raids later on. You're more so there for utility and consistent ranged dps while the big boys tops the meter.
---
Rogue also bring an alternative farming method in pickpocketing, but hunters have their own little niché. Go look up the old "hunter vs world" videos on YouTube. It was one of my favourite things to do on my hunter in vanilla and TBC when I was burned out on dungeons and raiding.  Eventually it became a thing for the hunters in our raiding group that we'd go and farm a couple of bosses by kiting and bouncing aggro between us while we waited for people to be ready for BWL.
---
So to summarize: there's a lot more to hunter than autos and pet tanking, but both classes are great and have their own unique playstyles in pvp. And clearly asking me to choose is impossible.
---
now give us a video of you doing the algebra please
---
Yeah basically what the other guy said but I'll also say druid is what you make of it. You can get real weird and probably less efficient but have more fun. It's easy to ignore parts of your kit for simplicity when you've been grinding it out for a while but there's always more abilities at hand. Starting a pull on a couple mobs by throing up a couple bleeds and going bear to swipe a few times and then mailing one to death, switching back to cat to finish the other off, etc. I love to open with pounce, do the small car bleed I forget the name of, FF, claw, rip, refresh small bleed. It's not usually faster than claw claw claw claw claw ferocious bite but it's way more fun to see your bleeds melts a target imo
---
thats one long guide
---
You are a mage?
---
What server is worth transferring too? I'm sick of only seeing horde and getting killed if I attempt to progress a quest.
---
Imagine being mad because someone is better LOL
---
And then he's gonna try to flex his gear lol
---
Yeah i have a girlfriend too
---
You have to convert to raid, invite a 6th member, have 5 instanced members logout, 6th member resets once all 5 are offline, then 5 log back in, 6th promotes whoever to leader and drops, and convert back to party if you need quest credits.
---
You can do this with a friend, an alt account, or what I did is logged out and on to a bank alt, told the other 4 to log and count to 30 Mississippi, and I reset for the group once all were offline, then switch back to my main.
---
If a equal geared or level rogue or warrior let's you win in a straight up trade without switching  forms or heals that is their mistake not your skill. A druid just doesnt have the dmg to trade like that. The guy above me mentioned that a druid could just sit in cat form and kill a rogue. That shouldnt happen ever because the druids dmg is so much lower. You should need to heal and switch forms to win that fight. If someone is letting you kill them with out switching form or having to heal they are either really bad or undergeared/leveled
---
Double confirm, guildie snipped Boots of Avoidance for 22 silver. Think the guy meant to put 220g.
---
I quested til SM farm, did that for a bit then quested in Tanaris 41-44
---
After that did ZF til 52
---
BRD Prison an Arena farms til 55
---
Torch Farm til 60
---
Insane speed after hitting ZF.
---
I got feared into the instance after just getting a group. Got stuck in a lamp. Couldnt get out. Hit the unstuck button and it sent me to like darkshore. I told the group I'm sorry but I need a break. Logged off in a rage.
---
Thanks man. Have 225 capped skinning and herb right now. Saving the gold for the 300 cap training until after mount. Saving herbs and cloth for the eventual Alch/Tailor switch. Priest btw.
---
my feralas looks like im trapped in a green fog. yours looks much cleaner....
---
YES, people don't seem to realize how long it takes to make a new group or even wait for a new member to arrive. In that time even with a messy group like mine, you will have progressed a lot further into the dungeon if not straight up cleared it.
---
I do the same exact thing.
---
Thank you! :D  
---
I see your point, makes sense. Should give them their options instead possibly then, but thanks for the feedback! :D
---
Is that a standard???
---
Using fear for CC is a surefire way to get a bunch of adds.
---
Ah gotcha
---
I use judgement's every once in a while https://docs.google.com/document/d/18H0AWJMvQSIrFdZMTRYcYZcWBsjCPZmy9eHygEWMsKU/preview
---
True that.
---
Starcraft and Diablo 2 were huge.
---
Not to mention their other successes.
---
It's not quite as lucrative, but if you are alliance and hit this area to farm for the fishing poles (I ended up with like 12 of them), post the stacks of shellfish on the neutral AH.
---
I bought a few stacks from there for a gold each.
---
Ok well i guess the numbers and stats are just wrong. You can call me ignorant all you want but Im basing my opinion on the best numbers we have from the last census data. Im sorry that doesnt align with your feelings.
---
Post it. See if someone buys it. GG
---
I kind of disagree with your logic. If anyone can reach a locked chest in a dungeon alone it’s a rogue, whereas no other class will ever be able to open that chest. Having said that I think everyone should roll anyway, lockpicking is part of a rogues skill set just like taunt is for a tank and heals are for a priest, so they should provide that service for the rest of the group without demanding something in return
---
**PREGANTE**
---
Nice. Thanks for the hint. I play during off hours usually. I'll try my luck there. Still trying to get that mount.
---
So given that it's generally accepted for classes to roll on gear regardless of the type (like plate-wearers rolling on cloth), that means it's cool for a Rogue to roll on Bows/Guns, or 1H's with Strength?
---
What about Shamans?
---
As an Spriest, I think you'd need to be a bad Spriest to lose to either. Spriest DoTs will outrace Warlock ones, they can dispel Voidwalker shield, and they have much better self-healing with VA. If you're an Alliance Spriest, Fear Ward will protect you from Warlock fear. If you're a Horde Spriest, roll Undead for WotF because people really overvalue Shadowguard.
---
Vs. Hunters, get your DoT(s) on and then don't chase them when they Viper Sting. Move in the opposite direction and start healing. They'll need to retreat to you to be able to keep attacking, at which point you reDoT with a range juke and continue the battle of attrition until you get a Blackout proc, at which point you fear the pet and get Flays and MB onto them. Hunters have no health sustain at all, and their only hope of winning is Viper Sting+40 yards, so if you can counter those at all, you'll be fine.
---
I contend that Spriest has no true counter in 1v1. Warlocks, Hunters, and Mages with superior skill can kill a worse Spriest, but if they're both skilled PvPers without Engineering, then the Spriest should be able to win against everything except maybe a Cold Snap Ice Block, and even then the Mage will die soon after from SWP. And if they *do* both have Engineering, the Priest is going to easily win unless he plays into Shadow Reflector. Enemy Holy Priests or Paladins can fight the Spriest to a stalemate if they keep running out of range of Mana Burn and are smart enough to not spam dispels on Rank 1 SWPs (I've literally never seen one that was smart enough to watch the Spriest's mana bar to figure out when the SWP is Rank 1, but conceptually they exist), but that's a stalemate, not a victory. Rogues can win with a clean chain-CC opener assuming no FAP, LIP, or trinket, but if you ever get out of their stunlock for half a second, they're done in Vanilla (TBC+ is a different story because of CoS, but we're talking about Vanilla atm).
---
dont worry i made a potatogunn now lol
---
You are looking at "builds" wrong with regards to priest leveling.
---
There is no actual build until 40 at least when you fill the whole shadow tree out for shadow form. The only talent points that mean ANYTHING before 40 is 5/5 wand spec (you get that first) and 5/5 spirit tap (you get that immediately after). Pretty much there are no other points you can place that will have any meaningful effect on your leveling. 
---
You get to 5 any way you can, and get the level 5 enchanting wand.  You then wand shit and apply SW:P when you have it before wanding. 
---
At level 13 you get the greater enchanting wand (which will be so OP it hits harder than any caster spell till nearly level 20). Still SW:P and wand shit. Ocassionally open with Smite if it is a mob you need to kill quickly for survivability or to get something dead quick in a multi mob pull. Use MB after if you REALLY need to kill it. When you start getting spirit tap up there you can open with Mind Blast more (its usually more expensive mana wise).
---
At 20 start opening with holy fire unless your mana just isn't going down, then you can Mind Blast instead. Get used to this because that is now how you play till 40. If you choose to go for mind flay, don't bother using it because as others stated the DPS is flat out lower than wanding and it will cause you to not regen mana. You will likely start feeling out if you can afford to cast a few more times to open, but you always should be hitting sw:p on them before they are on you and wanding. 
---
Oh I forgot to mention. After you have spirit tap, try to keep pw:shield up as much as you can. Not only does it keep you alive, but wanding DOES get slowed down by being hit slightly. So it will result in a slight increase in DPS. 
---
At 40 you go all in to shadow (but still get spirit tap, if you want blackout too sacrifice it from improved sw:p or something), then put points back into wand spec as you level. After that whatever the hell you want. Mind flay is valid now but you still want to mostly wand instead. Since you cant holy fire anymore, you instead either pull with mind blast and a few flays, or just flays till it reaches you. Then sw:p as usual and wand. 
---
Also, if you roll a Troll then rejoice because shadowguard is OP as shit. I took blackout after spirit tap because 3 10% chances to stun every mob I fight in addition to the sw:p and possible mind blast is just too good.
---
Tanks at higher levels, when they have all of their abilities, can hold aggro against multiple mobs.
---
But focus fire is done to remove damage from the equation as fast as possible.  That won't be required on every pull, but it makes the runs go faster.  The less damage the party takes, the less healing the healer has to do, and the less they'll need to stop for mana, etc.
---
Focus fire is the best strategy, but sure -- sometimes bad strategies work too, they're just not as good/fast.
---
It might have changed meaning over time, but back in vanilla this was certainly the way we used it. What do people call instances where someone level ~50 kills someone lvl ~30 nowadays?
---
I dont see there anything wrong. Holy Priests are superior to Shamans, not only that Shamans are pretty rare. Mages are really good and you cant have enough of them.
---
Yep, happens with my Polymorph too. It's just random.
---
Posting so I remember to check this later.

Am I the only one who sees that he rolled on 2 different items, won both, but received only 1 item ... twice?

---
It's unfortunate because I like the spell batching in regards to some PvP moments--for instance I knew a hunter was going to try and scatter trap me yesterday so I used my intimidating shout at the same time as he scattered me. Worked perfectly.
---
This sort of thing is so great because it allowed counterplay to some very powerful abilities (gouging a blink for instance) but the bugs their awful implementation brought sucks.
---
I'm also saddened by the fact that we got the 1.12 nerfed version of everything pve and the stupid itemization that allows my healers to have over 500+ healing with no raid gear.
---
The addon [ClassicSpellActivations](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/classicspellactivations) will do what you are describing. It is what I use on my warrior to to easy see when Overpower/Revenge/Execute can be used.
---
When the arms of Azeroth embrace you, there are things you will do to stay in them my friend.
---
After leveling a warrior to 16, a hunter to 27, a rogue to 33, a shaman to 37 and a warlock to 38, I’ve narrowed my classes down to two: my shaman and my warlock. What I cannot decide however, is what to main and what to alt. I plan to be PvP focused, but will have to raid as a means of obtaining the gear necessary to PvP.  Never healed before, but I don’t see myself hating it. 
---
I enjoy both class fantasies for very different reasons. The strong, noble tauren, brimming with shamanistic wisdom, summoning the powers of the elements to lead his people to victory. And the dark, reclusive undead, cackling as his enemies wither around him.
---
I will be leveling with my mage buddy— not worried about gear overlap, more concerned with WPvP synergy, as we love to take 2vX encounters. 
---
I love landing big numbers. Having CC is something I’m very much accustomed to, as I mained rogue for 15 years. 
---
Honestly, just entirely stumped. Which would be a better first 60? Desired throughout all content and capable of mass destruction in PvP.
---
It's just about context.  What does other benefits does the item give?  
---
For the most part, until you hit certain levels %hit is so crucial because if you miss an ability (yellow damage) you're really taking a loss on your effective damage output.
---
Can we stop blaming retail for asshole group members. I agree baseline dungeons in retail are easy, but mythic is quite challenging. I've been playing since just before the AQ events. These players have always been in the game. It's not some phenomena caused by retail.

Your preference. I would honestly keep it for bragging rights. You can always make gold some other way.
---
There are numerous ways to manipulate the algebra. The notion I'm really trying to get across is that critical gets better the more spellpower you have... but it probably never gets good enough to justify taking an otherwise equivalent piece of critical gear over spellpower gear.
---
That's when you move on and get an alt to his level.
---
Just hitting 60 with my main now, multiple friends in 20s and 30s, looking to get an alt up to them soon
---
Or just roll dwarf. No finesse required then.
---
Does this really work?
---
The lore clearly states that orcs and humans just kinda hung out together and exchanged cupcake recipes or whatever while picking wildflowers. 
---
It does suck how the game doesn't even give the option for people to play in a world that doesn't allow this. 
---
Maybe you'll have more fun playing World of Crafts. I hear they just patched in macaroni art

Half the engineers make their money selling their products to the other half of engineers that can’t make any of their product. Certainly gold to be made in engineering if you don’t use everything first.

One of my friends bought his for 280, he said he was messaging people who posted theirs on the AH and talked them down to that price.
---
Hi, Midas!
---
Best for solo content I would say but not best for non-raid content necessarily. Also if I'm raiding and doing other non-raid group content I'm not speccing back and forth to use maces because it's slightly better when I'm solo.
---
I tried every time of tte day weekdays. had no contest 1 single time in foothills. Isnt worth the time to even check in high pop servs

So you have different ranks of Frostbolt on your bar depending on the situation?
---
Wow seeing this brought back memories of Vanilla.
---
It’s cool, thanks for making the post in the first place. :)
---
Yeah you are right I edited it.
---
It is like asking to not be invited!
---
The only true value something has is the value you assign to it by choosing what you want to do with it
---
In my opinion the dungeon finder is fine as long as it doesn't teleport you to the dungeon, but only creates the group.
---
Any suggestions on a good place to farm wool on my alliance hunter, to feed to an alt for tailoring?
---
What so you mean “release pvp”?
---
I like this a lot.
---
Have you been leveling on private servers for the past 5 years?
---
AH but hold on to it for now. You’ll make some nice gold in a couple months
---
Me too. I know I have to improve, but I feel helpless against rogues, as a enh shaman.
---
Change it to Sealform Cub Clubing Club

Hey, my character is named Ninkasi too!
---
If you're getting more quitters than most people I'd focus on what you can do. Ask your tank if don't know what they're signalling to you.
---
It’s easy to plan to be responsible, but I know the needle is going in my arm the instant I get home.  After that, all bets are off.  At least my family will feed the pets.
---
Okay, so I can't use someone else's. Roger. I was curious if a ton of shadow priests could run a dung, just relying on shields and having constant heals from vamp embrace
---
Well, of course it's a technical limitation to keep every corpse around forever, that would just use too many resources over time. But it's also a gameplay decision as it's weird to have multiple corpse of the enemy you are fighting right next to him. Finally it's an artistic decision as it becomes hard to see the game world when everything is cluttered with corpses.
---
Why would you need a twink for WPvP? I figured it was a battleground thing.
---
I rarely pull aggro, and even if I did, I can self-heal almost all incoming damage with drain. And of course I can pop stones/pots. 30% is actually quite a lot
---
DM/Stocks if you’re able to solo them.
---
So what? The no changes squad is obviously wrong on a lot of things, people that roll on pvp servers don't want world pvp to die, it's that simple. Yes a lot of people want a specific faction but a lot of them will intentionally choose a server where they can have a closer to even split, of course some servers will still have uneven balances and some players prefer that but this would majorly Assist in self regulation without any outside enforcement, all we need is a bit of transparency, blizzard still hasn't " hot fixed" the enchant as auras bug they posted about a week ago and lack of transparency has always been an issue of theirs
---
Not sure why people hate speed runs/spellcleave so much. When you need to run the same dungeon 30-40 times it only makes most sense to make it fast and efficient.

I had a tank in live that kept marking the sheep target with a Skull, I corrupted the skull like 10 times throughout, cus my damn brain is so used to it for a kill target.
---
?? Isn't that faxmonkey? That video was made before YouTube existed yo.
---
Instructions unclear, hellfire’d until I died.
---
&gt;nobody is talking about specs
---
If you're talking about weapon types on a mid 40's Warrior, you are talking about specs unless OP is already committed to fury.
---
Frost spec and use blizzard. There's videos on the youtubes.
---
Paladins are dramatically better than shamans in battlegrounds.  I definitely think they outweigh stun resist and WotF.  And axe spec?  Lol.  Even if you think that matters in PvP, alliance have sword spec.
---
Wrap it up.
---
Ashenvale, Stonetalon, or even Silverpine forrest should have stuff.. or there are some higher end ones in southern barrens like the dwarf base.. RFK is at that level with like 4-5 quests and a good amount of XP.   Early stonetalon but Shimmer Flats is more 32 or so with the mobs ranging from 30-34.
---
Gotta pay your respects to the tank
---
You wouldnt happen to have that weapon swap macro on hand would you?
---
Lol “man”
---
It isn't really as much as you would expect, in particular when it comes to world pvp.  Simply because if you have say 2 people fighting 3 people. It is close enough that realistically neither of you are getting anything done, in the same lines 4 people can stop 6 people. A lot of it will depend on the classes and the ability involved. The problem comes when there are enough of an opposing faction that killing someone doesn't truly inhibit the process of whatever you were doing, when classes and abilities no longer particularly matter. Anything more I would say is overwhelming, and I wouldn't say 60-40 is ideal. But it is not completely terrible.

we called it condom. triangle was radioactive vag

No, 1 click macros for abilities that share the same cooldown are not allowed.
---
The way I do it on my warrior is I have a macro for overpower that is on a keybind while in Berserker Stance:
---
\#showtooltip Overpower
---
/cast Battle Stance
---
/cast Overpower
---
Then on the same keybind while in Arms Stance I have the macro:
---
\#showtooltip Whirlwind
---
/cast BerserkerStance
---
/cast Whirlwind
---
You click the same keybind twice and it works for dancing between the two.
---
All whelps drop small flame sacs, the dreaming whelps have 24% drop rate and these black ones 22%, they're the main reason I farmed these, one stack of 5 goes for 3g on my realm so not bad. Got like 8g/ hr at this level which isn't too bad considering the consistent 22.5k xp/hr as well, a good farming spot in general I would say.
---
It's possible in every dungeon , but yes not every healer is competent
---
Since vanilla days DM has always been Deadmines for me. DM North or West or east is Dire Maul. I've never heard of it referred to as VC. Now thats not to say that on other servers Deadmines wasn't referred to as VC.
---
No but you can set an interact with target keybind, and make a macro to buy a selected item
---
More or less
---
Magitards
---
They gotta be good BoEs, there are a LOT of bad and mediocre ones.   
---
Look for ones that have level ranges of like 29 or 39, those usually get sought out by twinks.
---
"Am I a joke to you?" - Warlocks probably
---
damn, I'm brand new to the game, first play through, and I have no idea how you guys level that fast, it blows my mind. I don't have a huge amount of time to play, but I get my hours in, and now that I'm level 30 I feel like it's taking me hours and hours to get a level. Then again I have very little idea what I'm doing and am trying to follow some guides and advice from friends...any advice you can give me to increase my xp/hour?
---
Got optic fiber so absolutly no lag at all and u did that many times without problem
---
I played from vanilla through MoP and Came back for legion and BFA. I constantly forget about other toons abilities. I completely forgot the other day that hunters can trap. Ally hunter totally baited me into a freezing trap.
---
Most of the quests in Hillsbrad unlock post level 30 though.. with some as late as 35 i believe.
---
VW absolutely sucks from ~20-50. It can't hold aggro at all. For the people saying "just wait a few seconds," why? You could literally kill the mob in the amount of time it takes to let the VW tank, not to mention mobs start hitting for more and will kill your VW fairly quickly once you make it to around level 40.
---
IMO Succubus is much better until you hit somewhere like WPL/EPL with high mob density. That's when you switch back to VW and sac him like the sadistic mofo you are.
---
Prevents you from entering stealth.
---
I second this. For the entire life of my warrior on retail, I had the stance buttons bound. For classic, I have a one button macro with modifiers to switch stances and it is much better.
---
I recommend Tribal. It lets you craft the Devilsaur set as well as Hide of the Wild.
---
Dragonscale lets you create mail sets for a number of different roles as well as epics like Chromatic Gauntlets. Each piece will be in less demand but maybe it's the sounder moneymaking choice?
---
Elemental gives mostly resistance gear. Molten Helm is probably going to be in some demand but overall Stormshroud pales in comparison to Devilsaur and the rest is pretty anemic.
---
WoWhead has a [nice blurb](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/leatherworking-classic-wow-1-300#choosing-a-leatherworking-specialty) outlining some of the items.
---
True lol, I just played my mage late at night and raided/dungeon spammed on druid during peak times so if a spot had competition I was usually able to find an empty layer
---
I mean the honor system hang on ill edit it
---
I’m literally LOL. This is great.
---
As you get farther and into SM you’ll see a lot of aoeing from your dps which also means heavy mana usage so it doesn’t really fall under a negative because you everyone has to drink anyways
---
Mage is better overall but its close. Warlock is better at dueling / 1v1ing, and has a higher ceiling once Naxx / Aq40 gear becomes available. Also warlocks more boring in dungeona in my opinion, but thats subjective (youre basically a shadowbolt spam)
---
Hi, I'm a level 34 Warlock, and I'm getting started with world pvp (STV).
---
Howeve it seems pvp for Warlock is just fear locking the enemy and making sure they dtay feared, and it feels kinda cheap, one trick man. 
---
I also noticed some warriors and priest sometimes get immune to fear and they completly wreck me.
---
Is there more options for pvp as a Warlock?
---
Other clases seem to have more options when dealing in pvp, as in slows, escapes and so on.
---
Yeah but he didn’t do that he chose to get a group lol
---
Sometimes I forget to buy  more throwing axes, it's not a big deal.
---
Yes, you probably play a tank and you're upset that other people might think you need to communicate your desires for the group rather than wait for them to ask you what you mean and have everyone assume.
---
Idk, but we better have lots of rouges for stealth.
---
Oh my god finally yes confirmation! The dmg from detonation is going off right when they land and not waiting the 10s. People thought I was insane!
---
My guildmate often gets control of world chat and he's quite trigger happy with the bans. Name also ends with the same letter as in the screenshot.
---
That's awesome. Just what I was looking for. Thank you!
---
Crush those numbers again... did it help?
---
Yeah, pretty much. Can't think of any exceptions to that statement off the top of my head.
---
Once they tweak imp slam to -1s for 2 talents, it is almost right behind fury in terms of dps (though it can be less consistent).
---
Until then its much better than arms for dps, but not quite dw fury.
---
Where it truly shines is aoe trash (for similar reasons arms can do aoe, except the spike is coming from flurry's rage gen more than ss)
---
It can be entertaining in PvP but is inferior to arms there - people get confused when a warrior starts spam casting pain, and there are silly troll plays like sunder to 5 while stacking rage (makes you seem pretty harmless) and then spamming slam (they'll need to be slowed and youll have to stutter step)

I've been thinking about trying to learn the human dance so I can break it out at parties. Of course that would require that I go to a party rather than stay at home playing Classic WoW but we'll cross that bridge when we get there.
---
"Putting every big item like that on ***reserve***"
---
\*Laughs in Hunter\*
---
/roll
---
No... Do you need to do that???
---
I forget tons of stuff about vanilla. Even as a long time player I forget to do things in fights and go “shit if I used this ability I would have been good, honestly forgot I have that ability” Happens to the best of us and that’s why going back to Classic is so much fun right now.
---
NOVA ORDER?
---
Where are your action bars?
---
I stopped pugging them yes - after many dungeons of huntards rolling on items that were not even good for them (such as Scarlet leggings). 
---
The final straw was when one need rolled on Sang'thraze, something that is absolutely horrible for them.
---
6 levels really should still give you the advantage.
---
Only some of Blizzard cares and it's about random shit. My guild was mass reported and had to change its name from "Guano Gang" because apparently poop is not okay... despite thereally being literal bat guano as an item and Go Go Guano as a quest name
---
Any reasonable person would agree. You have to make a lot of sacrifices when you have children, which is one reason I don’t plan on ever having any..
---
Obviously there are things in this post that are extreme by most people’s standards, but expecting one’s spouse not to stay out late every night is not one of them. Leave it to neckbeards to fixate on exactly that, though.
---
... reader, it was not better. No threat on anything besides the one mob he was hitting, so you couldn't pick off adds on the bat and wolf bosses in SFK. Even when he had threat, half the time I'd whack serpent sting on something and watch myself instantly leap to the top of the damage meter.
---
Don't be this guy.
---
That isn’t the point lol
---
I mean I do like the tree branch shoulders but the moose mantle ones are nicer.
---
What makes you think I use Overpower for threat?
---
I just partied with some ~48 people for an elite quest I missed before and I couldn't even shield them because "target too low level" &gt;.&gt;
---
How is his attack speed?
---
Lmfao this is tragic because that name is golden
---
I use skull box and moon as keybinds since 2 cc and kill target is usually best
---
Maybe, maybe not. I'd roll anyway these groups are chaining tons of these dungeons and you're basically exchanging your windfury totem for a shot at loot.
---
Or use a [World Enlarger](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18660/world-enlarger) or [Orb of Deception](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=1973/orb-of-deception)
---
Sounds like they would rather DPS than be a Tank
---
The worst I ever got with that game was playing for literally 18 hours a day. I would wake up at 5ish, log in to check my bank alts and auctions, work on my crafting, log on to my main(s) for solo questing or exploring, then tank a few dungeons. Next thing I know it was 1ish and I hadn't yet eaten breakfast. So I'd plan on wrapping things up and maybe going to the store to get something healthy for a change. Then around 3, I'd be starving so I'd set out to get the quickest food I could, a Burger King right around the corner. I'd get "breakfast"  and since it was so late and I didn't want to have to forage again, I'd get dinner in advance. 
---
Back home to log in and play some peak time pvp with my twink(s), then instance some more, then organize my materials and drops between my alts, plug in several auctions, then prep to go to bed around midnight. Maybe with a shower, time permitting.
---
I'm not playing classic, already dumped too many years of my life into retail and a bunch of private servers. I have a lot of free time right now, and I'm afraid I'd fall into the same patterns.
---
Is that for both Horde and Alliance?
---
Yeah, there's always a cheap laptop from a yard sale and NetZero dialup.
---
Yeah I’m with you, no need for hour long videos when I’ll have this Shame looming over me for the next 10 years
---
I got yelled at by a mage because my friend and I had the audacity to interrupt his xp/hour jerkoff session at sorrow hill, to finish our quest.
---
Like legit telling me to fuck off and roasting me and my pitiful xp rate for having to wand a mob (after holy nova’ing everything else dead, even).
---
Efficiency addiction is real.
---
Please. I got enough rep in AV for the black war raptor in 2 days as a balance druid in TBC.
---
Wheres the symbol for Blizzard followed up with Arcane explosion spam whilst running as far away from the tank as possible?
---
I'm not seeing it here.
---
Im level 57 and just respecced into a classic 15 / 5 / 31 build for tanking. 
---
I tanked LBRS as Arms, then respecced to Prot and ran it again immediately after with a different grroul.  
---
I was in complete disbelief over how easy it was to keep aggro in my second run compared to my first. 
---
Tanking has been so SO stressful while levelling but that last run made the respec fee feel worth it. 
---
Now i cant wait to tank the rest of the way to 60.
---
Swing and a miss. Reread my post: 
---
&gt;If I don't know what we're doing I ask.
---
It's good advice. Initiate the conversation if there's confusion. Not sure why you're getting aggressive over this.
---
Stfu and aoe it you bunch of scrubs
---
Fair enough, my mistake. I think cadaverous would be better (as well as bloodthirst) but that’s neither here nor there.
---
The main point is that there is not progressive itemization for items which are currently in. That’s what the person o was responding to was disagreeing with. Another big example that comes to mind is the changes to bloodmail and deathbone in scholo. Or just the fact that a lot of the later items in strath are out (peacemaker, carapace spine xbow, crimson felt hat) and are prebis.
---
Nah, mage is pretty tough sledding up to 20
---
Not many keyboards even have numpads anymore.
---
1 in 250^2 or 1/62500.  Assuming everyone subbed ran it 10 times, this would happen approximately 6 times.  Pretty rare.
---
Except that it requires the felhunter to be hit, did you forget that part? Its also easily the worst ability that the felhunter has. CS is useful for obvious reasons, paranoia is useful for rogues/druids, devour magic is insanely helpful as a dispel. Tainted blood is trash. felhunter is hardly going to ever be hit and he holds no aggro.
---
&gt;Or do you think anyone should be allowed to vote
---
&gt;Yes.
---
Why exactly should some clueless new player at level 5 have an equal say to the level 60 with 50 days /played? All it'll lead to is retail players with little more than a passing interest in Classic voting for changes that the dedicated Classic community doesn't want.
---
&gt;Considering no one voted for the direction of retail, I can't imagine how you came to that conclusion.
---
People asked for many of the changes retail has seen that many in the Classic community hate. Those people have retail, they don't need to also be able to influence the design of Classic. Not only would it have the potential for them to push through changes that would be hugely negative in the eyes of the dedicated Classic community, it would likely also prevent any additions that appeal to the Classic community but retail-only players don't like the sound of and vote against.
---
Seriously, what's so wrong with making sure that only people with an active interest in Classic would be the ones allowed to vote on any changes?
---
Diamond was always sap!
---
What addon are you using for your heals? I must know!
---
Of course who wouldn’t? But what after TBC? You don’t do TBC+ or Wotlk+ because that’s just too niche and aligning with retail. The correct path in MY opinion is classic+ with community fed pathways and decisions similar to how OSRS does. But that can be tailored X amount of ways
---
Depends on your strat, if it's getting close (1-2 pulls to boss in dungeons) perhaps save especially if your group has been having trouble or perhaps progress. Otherwise yes use all the time.
---
If general leveling, probably safe to use all the time off CD unless you have a quest to specifically assassinate a pack of 3+.
---
In PVP, that's situationally an i win button if used.
---
Make sure you use it just before your next tick at or below 60 energy if you can!
---
Next thing you know and Taunt is a waste of GCD.
---
Read comments before you post. Just saying.
---
to be fair, Joker was so far ahead of people that he had the zones all to himself.
---
AAAh the good ol days where my mage was actually fun to play in a group.
---
Unfortunately I can never log into wow again... there's no going back home!
---
Or you know, assclown, you could just drink water im between fights :-)
---
The only ones that I know are universal are Skull, X, Square, and Moon.
---
No DHKs though. People trying to rank up won't be doing this when honor comes out.
---
Exactly. The true test is how long you can hold the throne room
---
I'll be honest, I've been two-handed dps ranking since I got my we axe, and then Bonebiter Axe, and it was only in Uldaman that I started to have the occasional trouble holding threat, but use of sunder armor did not help. My problem had more to do with how much armor most mobs had (I would sunder up bosses, as they lived long enough to justify it) and that dps would be attacking mobs right as I charged in before I could get my first whirlwind off. A bit of communication and the problems went away.
---
Priest is the second easiest class to get to 60
---
Nobody intends for it to be nice.
---
Why do it solo when you simply don't need to, it's much easier to speedrun with a whole group, you don't die, you don't worry about anything going wrong as you have plenty of backup.
---
We've done 4 stints where we run the dungeon for 6-8 hours in a sitting and we all have enough for our epic mount now.
---
ok yeah then fuck those guys saying that lol
---
LOL
---
Oh right.. just use my gun, got it.
---
*Cries in paladin*
---
As a level 11 warlock should I be purchasing equipment and armor or should I be saving my money and if so what for?
---
Yes, you just need exalted with Stormwind to purchase Horse Riding and a Horse.
---
I will drag strong/elite mobs into blizzard EVERY time I have the chance, honestly. No faction discrimination.
---
Feralas wyverns? Or hippogryphs? Because i can't find any wyverns in feralas.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=3844/its-a-secret-to-everybody
---
That starts it, I think there's 10+ parts. IIRC you had to go at least to  Winterspring during it.
---
Haha I wonder how priests feel with all these mages running around.  I'm sure they have different stat priorities but overlap a ton on good gear while leveling.
---
"Dangit I'm healing you AOE spamming monkeys and every group I need to roll against two mages! "
---
Use a 2 hander in defensive stance instead. The damage boost from berserker stance isn't worth the threat loss, nor the increased dmg taken.
---
You should not be using overpower. It puts revenge on cd. It has a 0.9 threat modifier from battle stance. You don't need more damage in between sunders, you need more threat between sunders. Revenge. Shield block when rage starved for more revenge.
---
Why would you ever fear in a dungeon?
---
As a druid, replace shoot gun with your preferred pulling spell of choice.
---
Still won't actually cast the spell once you're moving targets, as you'll be in (dire) bear form and can't cast that spell.
---
Hehe not for the low lvl horde :)
---
zug zug my man
---
Yes, but you need to get exalted with the faction in question to be able to ride their mounts
---
I just keep Serpent Sting up to waste their vanish :]
---
3 kills, only 1 sinew for us. Multiple hunters every time, at least 1 on leaf quest every time as well.
---
Unfortunately, most of the Timbermaw rep quests will not be available until phase 3
---
&gt; But how do you police someone through a third party program? 
---
They wouldn't police the 3rd party programs like discord.
---
The only way to move money across factions is through the neutral auction house.   All you'd have to do is monitor the players who post totally unreasonable auctions (200g for this [Ruined Leather Scrap]!) and give out warnings/bans for what amounts to illegal smuggling.
---
That alone would pretty much solve a huge majority of the issues with people fulfilling their own contracts to get money.
---
Everyone knows that rogue gear is overpriced. Put "Monkey" or "Agility" on a piece of gear and suddenly its worth 100x what equal level gear is. &lt;/rant&gt;
---
sunder armor is very good effective dps when you're solo because all (or almost all) the damage you do is physical, but in a party that has casters and shit, it falls off really hard. and when there's two mobs or more, spending rage on whirlwind and sweeping strikes is muuuuuuuch better than sunder.
---
Yeah, if you can get us to waste our psychic scream while you're immune and cripple our vampiric embrace with mortal strike there isn't much else for us to do.
---
Just gonna say that open world pvp as a boomie feelsgewdman
---
I would personally be okay with classic+ with tbc, sans the lfg. I know I'm dreaming, but tbc was the last hardcore wow release, so it fits.
---

---
Just life tap one more time I double dare you.
---
in vanilla, rogues kicked my shaman ass almost every time. I assume that still holds true in classic?
---
Grats! I remember being jealous of all the 40+ mages riding around with their red hats when I was grinding SM GY/Lib/Arm.
---
Is there an addon or setting to remove the audio cue telling me I don't have enough rage? It gets old real fast.
---
https://www.patreon.com/valdihr/
---
Yeah, when you pull more than one thing, you dot the first, and in the meantime the second has acquired stacks of tainted blood. Also tainted blood generates threat.
---
Oh, where can you look at the history? Sounds like you need to average out all the prices yourself to find the actual market value? Auctioneer has an algorithm that seems to take into account multiple factors including historical data so that will be more accurate assuming no big price swings. Although even that has been pretty off for a lot of items since the economy is nowhere near stable.
---
the proper way to vw level is to stack spirit. spirit is the best warlock leveling stat by far. you have almost no downtime if you stack properly
---
I like to put Star on patrols. Having them marked is incredibly beneficial.
---
Always thought it would be appropriate if Blizz accumulated your time in there, and ultimate you got some sort of long-duration radiation sickness debuff.
---
Let it go long enough, it turns your character model into an undead.
---
My bank alt has so much shit in the mail just so I can return it to my man faster, it's great!
---
Thanks, I'll get the phase corrected on it.
---
Not my fault lvl 30 quest are there :p
---
hey guys I'm brand new to the game, first play through, and I have no idea how this bank alt thing works, or the banking to begin with. I didn't realize that banking cost money per day until someone told me earlier today and now I'm worried because I literally filled up my bank slots last night thinking that shit was free storage, gonna be broke when I get home probably lol. Anyways if someone could please explain how the bank alt thing works I'd be very appreciative!
---
Does the '2 pieces: [Increases damage done by Nature spells and effects by up to 7.](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=7694) ' buff from the **Embrace of the Viper** set work for the hunter ability **Serpent Sting**? And does it buff the proc on the **Venomstrike** bow?
---
I meant like for higher end raiding or arena. Didn't see much boomies
---
Oh, well I mean, most people will go arms for sweeping strikes, pick up a bunch of mobs and then obliterate them with doubled up whirlwinds and cleaves. Your strategy is good for one mob at a time but you can kill a lot more much more quickly if you utilize whirlwind/cleave/sweeping strikes.
---
I'm like 99% sure you need berserker stance to use whirlwind. Also you know how sweeping strikes interacts with cleave/whirlwind right? It literally just causes all enemies hit to be hit twice for full damage.
---
There's a pretty big difference between offensive and crude imo
---
Game is 15 years old chief. You knew what you were getting in to when you clicked on a PVP server.
---
I like how it was right before TBC dropped (if I'm remembering it correctly). You can spend your honor on the items.
---
Check out wow-professions.com but now that these guides are designed to be used by max level characters with gold to spend. This means they are not necessarily gold efficient, but time efficient instead.
---
Also if no hunter / druid, then triangle=3rd target because 3 corners and square=4th because 4 corners
---
I certainly would.  There are guilds on my server that are way more offensive (looking at you &lt;Medium Wieners&gt;).  I would open a ticket and ask how can our guild name be offensive but your world quest makes the same joke.  I also think there is a seal clubbing reference in the Borean Tundra DEHTA quest line.
---
Tells you more people are killing green dragons than running Deadmines.
---
This is the last straw
---
I always saw sap as circle.
---
Buddy found a crimson whelp and I found an emerald one, both while leveling, we decided to use them in the spirit of vanilla!
---
He meant Berserker Rage, not range
---
If you do some relative groundwork before AV and no life for AV you might make a quick stride to 14.
---
Come on down to Kurinnaxx, best west coast pvp server hands down.
---
Dunno, I have no interest in TBC. It changed the game enough away from classic that I don't think its necessary.
---
Warbro
---
South west, to the right of the ogre camp/tunnel if your are facing it (to the left on map).
---
The brazilians that joined Thalnos are (generally) the ones that don't mingle with english speaking communities.
---
Unless this was when demo-roar spamming worked, amen. They don't know what they're doing. Leave and move on. Most AOE groups aren't like them though.
---
Amd you picked *priest*?!

Have you ever run a low-level dungeon before? Lol

wooosh if for when something goes over someones head. There is an add-on called CleanUI. This is not it. This is just wrong information.
---
Yes, but that's really common advice. I feel like everyone who browses reddit has heard that a dozen times.
---
I soloed them easily on my mage at 55. I am 58 now and it has only gotten easier. It only goes for about 5-7g per devilsaur leather for my server though unfortunately.
---
Before TBC rogue was my favorite class to fight against, followed by hunter. I had lots of tank talents so bear form plus bleeding would win against the best rogues.
---
Against hunters I'd just stay close, and when possible sleep their pet.
---
Got my mount at 40 too, feels good man.
---
big facts
---
Gank? You attacked him...
---
Decisions will be made and people will be pissed off regardless what they do. We go TBC people are pissed we didn’t do classic+ and vice versa. 
---
Everyone can agree on one thing playing classic is whatever LONG term decision is made that it is aligned with the “heart of classic”
---
Hmm, i can't find those settings :(
---
I got rank 12 on my horde alt account. I did not push past 11 on my alliance main, but a lot of that was because I raided a lot in my alliance guild. 
---
I will not be doing a Rank 13-14 grind. I am no longer in college, and my life will be a mess if I tried to play 14+ hours a day like you likely need to for rank 14.
---
I am somewhere between a casual and hardcore gamer. I sometimes am semi-casual. At other times I am semi-hardcore. But my days of hardcore gaming are long over. At least for the next 20-30 years (i.e. until retirement).
---
Ah yes, the national anthem of Dalaran. Exquisite, truly...
---
What do you think wasn't done right?
---
I‘m actually so far behind that I‘m hoping people will have forgotten this when I reach lvl 30~40
---
I've had this same feeling.  Some things feel smooth and perfectly normal.  Other things/times it feels like noticeable delay in me pressing a button and anything actually happening.
---
That's funny I could have sworn it was you crying over people calling this low effort. Idk why you're so defensive over something so unoriginal that probably took 0.2 seconds to make. Maybe it took a lot of effort and thinking for a brain as small as yours to figure out how to take a screenshot but most of us have more than 4 brain cells so idk
---
Perfect slap. Can't get better than that slap. 5/7.
---
Affectionately referred to as Goldshower sometimes.
---
Oh thanks
---
Omg these people just don't understand the grain and reward of pvp lime I bet they came around down baby time legion #nochanges keep it up against changes against this game this our life our existence we need to protect this perfect system if you think it needs changing you just need to quit and go back to retail I think your FREE EPICS are awaiting you like seriously imagine playing that dumb ass game lol #nochanges to perfect godlike game classic
---
Did you try typing something into the search bar?  I don’t think anything shows up until you do that.
---
HAHAHA ya ok
---
I have some questions about helping lower level players:
---
1. Does having a party member who has outleveled a dungeon significantly decrease the xp of the rest of the party?

2. If I party with my brother in the low 10s while I'm lvl 25, does that just hurt his xp gain or help?
---
The loot tables are better in classic than private servers lol
---
Just wait until you get to Uldaman... The rest of the dungeon is a bit of a breeze... then you find out that you cant kill the last boss, and wipe a few times on the massive trash packs on the hallway before it.
---
Fake news - The Horde doesn’t hide from peasants like the Alliance.

RIOT!!
---
Man you are so sad son
---
Yeah I love sweeping strikes! :) thanks for the answer
---
Yeah ik i just wanted to give an idea where for example 40 level players can go and get some gold \^\^ to get their mount. I said its more efficient at level 60 since you take less damage, obvious mistake from my side im i so sorry about that.. c: ty for that and im gonna film a video in that place too. The thing is as Healer im killing high level mobs super slowly : \[
---
Literally unplayable.
---
PlaysTV is decent, also has a built in feature where you can upload clips to their website
---
...an enemy that wants you dead?
---
I leveled as shadow then swapped to holy for easier dungeon spams and now I’m 51 and back at shadow for grinding. If you want an easy time leveling going discipline till 40 is a solid option.
---
Yes to the first, no to the second.
---
While leveling, unless the dps outlevels you, you won't be fighting for threat.
---
As a healer, had a runs of SM Lib that was night and day.
---
* 41 tank w/ Ravager.  We wiped three times due to adds.  I got aggro as a healer and died.  Then the tank died.
---
* 38 tank with board and shield.  No deaths, no aggro issues, smooth as silk.  No CC either.
---
If you 2h tank, recognize your limitations and be ready to swap.  If you are dropping to 20-25% before heals land and your healer isn't attempting to regen or max mana, switch.
---
Give me loot or I'll send you my dickpick? xD
---
This is when I see a 20 second log out countdown because I can’t get into the Inn full of ally and just pray the time goes quickly.
---
Seduce? Do people not know warlocks have cc too?
---
There's efficiency addiction, then there's being a douche canoe. I'd argue he falls under both.
---
My best friend was a High Warlord on our server, and did it alone (unless you count me healbotting him from time to time). He wants to get the PVP rewards, but doesn’t really want to grind the High Warlord part. His explanation was that more or less it was easy to rank up until Warlord, but then they had some weird agreement with the other Warlords to let each person hit High Warlord. 
---
Me and him will probably just pvp at 60 since we won’t have time to raid.
---
I don't know how you do that since it basically requires a talent spec specifically suited for it, with improved blizzard that slows mobs etc. Otherwise you're going to get killed.
---
Thanks A bunch
---
I'm in my early 30s, I don't know anyone that users FaceBook willingly, only if relatives / friends *insist* on using it and then only as little as possible.
---
I haven't touched mine in over 8 years.
---
That's on you then. Not to sound harsh, but if these folks weren't doing what they needed to be doing, and you are telling them what you think will improve the situation, that's 100% on you.
---
Yea there are certain classes that can pull agro a bit quicker than others, and it's great when a skilled player is at the keyboard and recognizes they over agroing, you you are struggling for whatever reason.
---
It's your job to hold agro, and you don't have a magic I win button to do that. You need to communicate.
---
Why are the people who were introduced to WoW via BC, of which there are more than the people who started in vanilla, any less valuable? 
---
Why do you deserve a faithful recreation of vanilla, but they shouldn't get a recreation of their game? E
---
Why is it a labor of love when it's classic but it's pure greed when it's for an era of the game that many people consider the best it ever was? 
---
Why do you think you're more special than BC players?
---
Why would I pay a powerleveler? What possible reason would I need to pay someone $400-800 to get it done in like 21 days when you can just do it yourself... while still enjoying the game. I'm having a hard time understanding why you're so anti-aoe or playing efficiently? Hunters used to be the ones who hit 60 the fastest, why don't they just pay a powerleveler instead of wasting their time with that speed nonsense. Or all my friends who hit 60 already even though they did efficient quest routes - shame on them for playing the game efficiently and having time to grind it!  
---
Why act like you're the only one getting content done and everybody else is just "skipping" it. They are just doing different content than you, it's not against ToS. Paying a powerleveler is.
---
Alliance dont have access to orcs and they do perfectly fine.  
---
You'll be happier playing something you actually enjoy the aesthetic of. Also 5% health and warstomp are both awesome
---
Helmet, shoulder, chest, belt and gloves more like
---
You can think of a stun as damage. At a minimum of 3 seconds of auto attacks from everyone before the fight resumes. Extra hits become really good with super slow weapons. And near useless with fast attacks. As an extra attack could be thought of as everyone being stunned besides you for 1 attack. But you lose out on the energy gain and the ease on damage that helps with the healer.
---
How do you know they identify as she?

Perhaps, by your snarky logic, we should just remove this sub, as it's obviously all old jokes, news, and everything written here has happened before.  Or, perhaps you could kindly just fuck off.

Why hasn't anyone made a Mage called Washingmachine and trade the healer stacks of Bleach when they ask for water. Or have they?
---
How would fixing class balance be *devastating*? 
---
Why the fuck is the false equivalency of viable specs in classic = retail a thing?
---
During BC, which was when marking was really used the most, star was usually sap, but thats because there wasn't much to shackle. Now, coming into Classic with marking available from the get-go, I think it makes sense to have Shackle as Star, since the shackles are golden, and Sap as Circle, because idk why.
---
Has happened my last two excursions into this dungeon.  We’re unable to make it to final boss due to multiple times group getting wiped, ultimately quitting. Very frustrating as we rolled with no issues until Meeting the two groups of dark dwarves on the ramp.

Streamer sucks

I am completely new to this game, currently level 20, but I just wanted to say that your mechanical skills look really impressive. Thats definitely something I should focus more on improving.
---
Elvui and other mods work in classic?
---
That’s a pretty fucking shitty attitude
---
Real pvp games you can attack anyone and you can loot them.
---
Say I drop enchanting for skinning just until I get my mount at 40, can I pick enchanting back up at the level I dropped it or will I have to restart?
---
because out side of raiding (the only place the debuf cap matters) mobs running away is thing and often they stun you and then run away at 1000000 miles an hour. both solo and in dungeons. crippling stops that, also keeps people from running away from you 
---
you only need rank 1 of it till you have gold to spend on higher ranks, and its 100% worth it
---
There's no way to tell the last 2 points.
---
Be weary of anyone who tells you otherwise.
---
It’s absolutely not. It’s using regional values or something, because it is 100% not accurate.
---
Skullflame Shield
---
Cuz its the most efficient
---
Mathematically you have to have spent about 8 hours a day the last 4 weeks to be 60 now, assuming you hit it around 10 days /played which is not bad.
---
No, they will completely kill world pvp.  Why would anyone go out in the world to get honor and possible risk a DK when they can sit in town and queue for BGs all day?
---
That's not cobblestone, that's cracked, dry salty earth.
---
Those are not stairs, those are bleachers around the track.
---
Hmm, ill have to go take a look tonight
---
Addons existed in vanilla.  Barbershops didnt.
---
I like that they're releasing things in a similar schedule to the original release. So many people are rushing to 60 and clearing raids already. That's great if that's what you like but vanilla really doesnt need to be a race. Theres a lotttt of time before bwl, aq, and naxx and there will still be plenty of raid spots available for those who want to clear it all. I look forward to enjoying the gradual content releases at a pace that wont burn me out. Grinding a few honor ranks via world pvp will be fun
---

They're very inactive. I would just use the normal ones.

How long did it take you to figure out how TSM works? I looked at it for a little while and it seemed tough to do anything with, not to mention being built for a well-established economy.
---
Not as much, but it’s a place to market items not easily available to the other faction.
---
Stereotypes exist for a reason.. they weren't brought up out of thin air

It's about staying focused on the xp grind lol. I used a questing mod called guidelime and it helps you to not waste time. I highly recommend it.

---
Hate the blatant Blizzard defending on this sub sometimes.
---
Good ideas seem to attract “durr it’s their game” or my favorite...”no changes”
---
If “no changes” entails dead pvp servers, then perhaps they should make some changes.
---
Feral kitty dps actually is viable, but it requires a lot more effort than what other dps classes will have to put in. The dps rotation is more complex because you will have to time your powershifts with energy ticks to get an instant 80 energy per powershift.
---
Dps druids also rely a lot more on consumables, most notably the Manual Crowd Pummeler. This is a weapon that you can get from Gnomeragon that has an on-use activated ability that increases your attack speed by 50% for 30 seconds which is crazy powerful for a dps druid. The problem is the weapon only has 3 charges, and once those charges are used up it is useless and you will need another one. The more MCPs you have with you going into a raid, the more damage you will do, so it's really up to you how many of these you want to farm each week to push numbers. I think the average is around 10-15 per raid, and you can typically get around 2-3 MCPs per hour running through Gnomeragon (the actual runs themselves will take about 20-30 minutes, but then you will be locked out for an hour), so it's a lot of farming depending on how far you want to go.
---
If you want more information you can check out Shedo's guides on Youtube. He's the best resource for feral cat dps.
---
You are right though in that feral dps druids become much better in TBC. Having more talent points and better itemization for feral dps was a huge help.
---

You have to be exalted to ride it. This would not work or else people wouldn't be grinding/buying 9000 runecloth to get exalted with whichever faction.
---
you're saying that i would go back to axes at 60 but also saying that sword + human racial is better. do you just mean that the 60+ axes are better than the swords, even with considering human sword benefit?
---

---
Doesn't really help since you'd need Exalted to get the riding anyway. Classic uses the pre-1.12 system so each race has a different riding skill. Rams require Ram Riding, Horses require Horse Riding, etc.
---
Perhaps, but this is literally, like, his opinion, man.
---
This shit ain't codified across servers and informal communities, much less across regions. Assign marks on a case per case basis or expect trouble, but I suppose some people do love the feeling of elitist indignation.

It's a lighthearted joke and rarely taken seriously

They had a huge negative stereotype in the early days of League of Legends, basically they were mouth breathers that had their own strange bad meta.

At 60 as a Protection Warrior with aoe type gear (damages mobs when I'm attacked) what is the highest dungeon I can solo farm?
---
Epic
---
I've been thinking about the future of classic since I downloaded it and started playing.  Them adding a level 60 version of Kara would be a great move, IMO.  It's in azeroth, it was the first raid in TBC, and MOST people who played Vanilla, also played TBC and ran Kara.  It's a no-brainer for them to scale it to 60, and patch it in after Naxx.
---
You have to start again at 1.
---
&gt; Seems boring as fuck
---
Some kids get off on that kind of thing.
---
Actually, we are apes

Common taxonomical error
---
Each layer has it’s on general chat out in the world, so the banking one shouldn’t have happened. Trade chat is not layered though.
---
It comes down to preference, really, and what you want out of your rogue.
---
Nelf has higher agility and better stealth.
---
Humans get perception and sword spec.
---
Dwarves get a pseudo cloak of shadows (Stone Form).
---
Gnomes get escape artist which looks great on paper until you realize it had a cast time in vanilla.
---
You will have to restart, and honestly skinning mats are flooded on most server AHs right now. You'll spend a ton in deposits and not make much more back. What class are you? There might be other more lucrative means
---
Holy shit that was some piss poor Rogue play LMAO
---
Same level, 1v1, not waiting for you to be oom or half HP while fighting a mob? That is the fairest world pvp engagement I have ever seen by a huge, huge margin.
---
I really don't see why it is necessary to set specific and strict labels on marks. Just communicate with your group what mark means what, instead of expecting someone to have already memorized what marks sre supposed to mean. It isn't that difficult to just communicate your intentions.
---
Yes. Each account needs it's own sub.
---
Price is relative to your income, but 50€ a month for 24/7 entertainment isn't really all that much. Hell, quite a few people spend more on alcohol in bars in a single night... My gym subscription costs more. A good dinner for two can easily run twice that.  Getting a single new game every month would cost about the same. It's not all that bad when you think about it. Depending on how many accounts you run of course,  but then we're back to relatively to one's income and disposable income.
---
Why does everyone hate on Belle Delephine so much, I dont get it. The joke is funny, but your comments are all negative.

This is literally how its written.

[https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/thats-just-like-your-opinion-man](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/thats-just-like-your-opinion-man)
---
Why would they add a game feature from an expansion to Classic?
---
RIP
---
This is true of many classes. Healers may use lower-ranked heals for mana efficiency when larger ones are less cost-effective and not truly needed. Paladin Tanks may use a max-rank Consecrate to build aggro, but then switch to Rank 1 to maintain aggro longer thanks to the much lower mana cost.
---
It's all about knowing what you want out of the ability. Why pay more mana to Psychic Scream up to 4 targets, when you can pay less and get the 2 that you need? For another example.
---
I agree, but don't think they do. These type of people make up an "opinion" and spread it as fact instead of being open to other possibilities.
---
I always star myself so everyone knows I'm a star.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if it's more or less in the ballpark but that's not exactly a source that would make me comfortable stating it an absolute fact.
---
Find the tank! Oh the condom broke, time to be the tank, *evasion*.
---
Thanks everyone!
---
I believe this was only added to the game in Legion or BfA.  
---
If you drop any of your professions in classic everything is lost and when you pick it back up again you will have to start again completely from scratch at level 1 with none of your recipes unlocked.
---
But then you can’t learn both dash and prowl, right? I guess prowl isn’t universally important but as a NE I wouldn’t go without it.
---
"Area Of Effect" it just means damage (or effects) that target an area vs a single target.
---
It's from a movie, chill..
---
Rage starvation is real too..
---
Hark! The call of the self-righteous healer with the god complex:
---
*"You're not getting healed. You're not getting healed."*
---
He wields power over the very forces of life and death. He decides who shall survive, and what will be left of them. He alone can save the group--or doom them! Stand in awe of his massive influence.
---
Your complaints are more about battlegrounds than the honor system itself. If they never released bgs then no afk farming/etc
---
They're mainly used for transferring items that can't be obtained on a specific faction. So if you're horde and want the chicken feed for the chicken pet, you have to buy it there.
---
im debating using this stoneslayer 44 sword from ulda over ravager
---
That you had no plans of actually giving them something of higher value?
---
Even if you did, what are you fucking EA? This would effectively be a lootbox and good luck finding ANYONE who plays games that thinks they aren't a scam.
---
To quote the tooltip:
---
&gt; Afflicts your target with Shadow energy that causes all  party members to be healed for 20% of any Shadow spell damage \***you\*** deal for 1 min. 
---
Its personal only.
---
Mage. Just going to make a dis alt. I kill anything I see on my way to quests so even just selling to vendors would add up. Do vendors buy leather?
---
Exactly this, not to mention that fact that 9 out of10 dungeons groups are Go go go/AoE/Melee Cleave/No CC/big dick DPS, this problem is compounded further.
---
When you get those types of quests you should be killing stuff along the way. Sure the quest itself might only give you one bar of exp, but the 100 mobs in between will net you like 1/4 of your total xp bar
---
Yup! ElvUI has been supported from nearly Week 1 I believe
---
I suggest to roll hunter, its ez to learn but hard to master due to high pvp skill ceiling.
---
Diamond Seduce. I'm not fearing shit.
---
Really? Where'd you get this from? I thought it was still up in the air classic+ vs re-releasing expansions.
---
It's actually spellhit, not spellcrit. my bad
---
It's pretty nice. I went fury from 10-60. Getting crit means I deal more damage and heal. I have an AOE slow too to kite with. Skipped the Whirlwind Axe because I never used 2-hand. Might be a bit harder now that you're "behind the curve" but tanks are never out of demand.
---
&gt; Im feeling like most rogues are playing this class to cloak and avoid all decent pvps or just to gank low levels.
---
You must have never run into me then.  I attacked a group of four people because I thought I could get one of them for sure.  I didn't.
---
I got three the second time because I timed it better.
---
can you explain why
---
Fear as a CC?!  You’re a madman!  Do a succubus seduce instead.
---
I agree with the above posts of play what you like. But I would like to remark that warrior is one of the slowest classes to level and even at high levels only really shines if the player has a certain minimum degree of skill. 
---
The other remark is level 10 is nothing. You're talking about a handful of wasted hours on a grind to 60 that will take someone new at least 200 hours played. 
---
I'd recommend playing a hunter or warlock instead. The benefit of pets makes the leveling up process so much easier. If you end up loving the game you can always level up a warrior second.
---
No white for priest to indicate shackle. And a priest could fear/shackle. Warlock can fear/seduce. Hunter can trap/pet tank/kite, druid can root/hibernate, etc.
---
Yea I’ve been starting up my stock. Have a few stacks going. Wanted to try and get the arcanite rod though so I can hit 400 skill with baits cause you get like around a 25% catch chance in azshara. I’ll have to see what it’s like with 380 only
---
That's battlegrounds not the honor system. We get a whole holy phase with honor before BGs
---
I (an orc warrior) had a 60 rogue try to gank me at 55 and I resisted both her kidney shots 💪🏼
---
Some might call it best practices but I just make a macro with those basics and adjust to fit group makeup.
---
What is this response even? What point are you trying to make?
---
Tohanda ruins in Thousand Needles, ~24 basilisks all 32-35 with super fast respawn.  Easy to get 2-5gp per hour in the mid 30s, not counting leather.
---
And here I thought my strategy was original... :(
---
Yes it is the classic experience. People who did that then were bad, and you're bad
---
BoPeep and her Tauren "sheep" are found on the RP server a lot. Same sort of idea.
---
that's how most servers did it btw when one side finished.
---
I usually spend so much time doing BGs that I never get around to leveling. It's been sort of a blessing this time around since it kept me focused on dungeons/quests and leveling. Gonna miss them once I hit 60, though. World PvP is fun, but it's often so one sided that it's not that interesting.
---
A) while this sucks, there is an equal chance you may have deserved it, we are only getting a out of context snip-it of the conversation.
---
B) rule 3
---
*roll eyes
---
It's not your fault but if you knew how sharply critical I've been with Blizzard on Starcraft 2, Heroes of the Storm, etc etc you wouldn't have opened with that fanboi comment but you didn't know, so we can let this slide.
---
And oh before I forget, Hearthstone has its share of problems we won't get into here. But as for WoW Classic, it is what it is. We'll play, we'll enjoy it for what it is and we'll all eventually be bored of it and move on. It's just stating the facts.
---
This is sad.
---
6
---
And NOBODY will have the gold to pay for ANYTHING for a few phases at least.
---
People who talk about going skinning to level for extra gold probably planned on vendoring the skins. It is literally just to gather extra vendor trash.
---
&gt; why do you do this?
---
Confirmation bias. Small sample size. Confusing anecdotes with data. Overly broad generalization.
---
There is no difference between horde and alliance players, just people playing a game. A statistical analysis would show a plain old bell curve of some super nice, altruistic players on one side of the hump, some sadistic, mean assholes on the other, with everyone else falling variably somewhere in between according to their circumstances, mood, whatever.
---
Of course, that doesn't really apply to people role playing, which is like another game altogether. For example, I pretty much evenly divide my time between horde and alliance. My personality doesn't magically change depending on which side I'm logged on to. If I was RP'ing, then I'd likely be "in character" and might behave differently.
---
Omg yes somebody said something about, I thought it was clever 😅 thank you 😭😭
---
Dang healer blending in with the Warlock and Mages... not the hunters so much, though.
---
Sometimes I get tunnel vision when soloing and will pull a mob, not realizing there’s someone just off screen casting. I always /sorry at them tho, and either invite them or move far away. The hunter prejudice is real, gotta do my part to balance the perception.
---
Get off the pvp servers. Why do you people do this to yourself? If an Alli walks past me and DOESN'T attack I shake my head and kill them. Take your /wave to the graveyard.
---
It was pulled from their earnings summary.......

I would say gnome, human, dwarf or the other one. These seem like the most viable option for alliance.  Good luck hope this helps.

Imagine being a Warrior
---
I could be wrong but I dont think those are lesser elementals
---
Yeah, but the major arguments regarding Classic and even regarding the hate for retail WoW is that Flying and LFG killed the game. I'd like to comment on which 2 expansions brought those features.
---
The two you want to play again.

---
This is where I've been looking
---
None means attack right?
---
Fiery weapon doesn't do that so far for me and I use sap soloing 25/8
---
Not really in the same way, and the way quests in vanilla are designed you are constantly traveling around the world.
---
Yeah, its not like 60s are always going to be in Stonetalon or other certain areas, but they will be visiting Ashenvale for their tailoring or world bosses/farm or professions.
---
in TBC you just sit AFK in shattrath or you fly around without interacting with the world. And if you want to visit azeroth you just the portals in shattrath, you don't have to interact with a mage. No more spending time playing the game on getting to areas or traversing entire continents.
---
Looked kinda like Shadowed Unit Frames.
---
I use my battle.net email at the login screen, I'm not sure but using your account name might also work.
---
I just dont get it, is it a "power" thing? Feeling good about yourself for destroying a few minutes of someone elses night? I mean how bad of a life must you have to get pleasure out of such petty things? Is it an RP thing, are they RPing assholes?!
---
Can we really expect to have TBC ? i'd buy a lifetime subscription if so. I mean just TBC , not WOTLK and the others.. Did blizzard talk about it or w/e?
---
Oh i see it, I just needed to go to page 2 on wowhead. Cheers.
---
just have to convince her  to join you :p
---
Pretty sure it still is, but its not a Blizzard joke. Its a player RPing as an NPC joke as well as a Sorros reference.
---
Been warbiking for 15 years.
---
When i played Rogue in classic and TBC the Mark of SAP was the star not the circle
---
What do you mean arguably? The Dota mod was the start of the moba genre.
---
Give it a month and ill have an excuse, even.
---
No way in hell im going to feel like doing anything outside once the highs are in the 40s-50s and its dark when i get home.
---
You probably figured it out by now but it does work with Questie, quite well. What you do is ctrl-click (might be right click) on the quest objective on the map and it'll set a waypoint there. You can also set waypoints at non-quest-related locations just by ctrl-clicking (again might be right) on the map. With Questie's new tracker, you can right click on the quest and there's a bunch of options, some of which are integrated with TomTom.
---
Thanks for that calculation, it really shines a light on what's truly a time investment to race to 60. Mage AoE grinding aside.
---
I play almost every minute I’m not at work or doing chores or doing something with my girlfriend. I live with my girlfriend, but she plays quite a bit of over watch and our computers are next to each other so we get to hang out while playing separate games.

You can sell it for as much money as a Feral druid can get hold of.

Personally, if you arent a Feral druid, I'd wait for them to farm up some money, but put the word on the street you have one for sale.

with that attitude, idk about that lol

Was that you? I didn't mean to get aggressive no, but some paladin tried to throw a stun on me (which promptly got resisted and he wandered off). Then i tried to get on the boat to do my quest, was gonna let you guys do the cap first - you were 5 after all - but got attacked, so aoe feared the lot of ya, and then we spent the next 20 minutes with you guys drowning in fears and water lol.
---
Just started in ungoro! Going a bit slow, am a GM so a good bit of work on the side. Plus i can't help myself with doing the long quest chains.
---
well, maybe you should learn to play your class then?
---
Tank gets the orange condom.  Because they are protection.  It also helps everyone to keep LOS of the tank.
---
&gt;How would fixing class balance be devastating?  
---
Because blizz has attempted it for 15 years and its results have been disastrous? Oh, what, you expect *this* time to be different?  
---
Why are you unwilling to go play classic? It has what you want. Im specifically playing classic because classes arent homogenized.
---
HERE IN MY GRARAEGE
---
Anyone who tells you horde doesn't have the best pvp racials in the game is a bald-faced liar. I don't even need to defend that.
---
As for questing: Badlands, STV, Thousand Needles, Feralas, Stonetalon, WPL, Hillsbrad (and Alterac, by extension), and Swamp of Sorrows all have better flight paths, quest hubs, and presumably graveyards for horde than alliance. That's pretty much the entirety of the 30-45 quest experience, in favor of the horde. Dustwallow and Arathi favor alliance, and any other zone outside that with camps from both factions is pretty evenly split. Yeah, I can see how this is a wash.
---
If allies want to get from the Night Elf starting zone to the Human starting zone, they have to take a boat from their capital to their second zone, then take another boat from there to Wetlands, then run through a path surrounded by hostile level 21 enemies across the entire south edge of the zone, then take a short detour through a second zone before running back across the entirety of a third zone just to get to Ironforge so they can run to the back of Ironforge to get on a tram that puts them in the back of Stormwind so they can run across that city to be able to hit the level 5 quests for Humans. If an Undead wants to do the level 5 Orc stuff, they run outside their capital city to a zeppelin and fly it to just outside the Orc capital city. If they want to do the Tauren stuff, they then take a different Zeppelin over to Mulgore. Comparable travel experiences, right?
---
Paladins are pvp healing gods and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Casters technically beat them, but I have my money on a good Paladin outlasting the caster's mana pool before walking away and/or facilitating someone else killing that caster before it can tear the Paladin down. All Shamans can do is pray for an early Windfury proc to get the instagib, except it doesn't work on Paladins, because they're basically immune to anything physical when geared. If I recall correctly, the Shaman's fast heal is less efficient than the Paladin's to boot.
---
All this is to say: That guy is completely right, and anyone saying otherwise is lying.
---
Yeah, talk to the gnome in WPL camp.
---
What is DD?
---
My memories of the pvp system pre-bg are that it favored ranged aoe (notably mages) to almost the exclusion of all others with how how kills were calculated and how pvp worked. Granted that was patch 1.4 so it was before the class revamps that exist in 1.12 and it was also 15 years ago so I could be remembering wrong. Either way I'm curious to see if it works out like that again.
---
When I was running mine regularly I saw 30k total characters with a max of 7k concurrent players.
---
Ill PM you cause I dont want a witch hunt
---
They still dropped the shards needed for that regent run quest. Unless thread is about a totally unrelated quest that might explain why alliance &amp; horde do constant battle in cliffs outside the FP.
---
They don't need to remove layering if they never release phase 2
---
That sounds way to disorganized and whose to say stop at Wotlk... completely subjective.
---
This is wrong.
---
Skull is attack first.
---
X is attack second.
---
All other icons are just cc icons that you tell the ccers to cc.
---
And not putting in a mechanism to balance PvP servers. And then doubling down on that mistake by announcing BGs will be cross server when they do come out (so don't worry about your server imbalance you can still queue) but not actually bringing them out until after they bring out the Honor grind which will make leaving capital cities impossible for the minority faction on PvP servers with huge imbalances.
---
For all you thirsty gamer boys
---
&gt; I'm just saying you'll instantly get a massive meltdown coming from the legions of shitty orc warriors lol.
---
For sure there would be a meltdown no matter what. The whole #NOCHANGES crowd are getting a bit too rowdy. This is classic, not vanilla. There's quite a few things that are different. Rose coloured glasses or not, the game has changed. WE have changed. Time to embrace it.
---
I had this, I just closed battlenet and relogged..No issues.
---
Arent your pre-raid BiS Barbarous Blade, Assasins Edge, or Dawn's Edge though?
---
Accidentally put innervate on the warrior tank.
---
Dude freaked out because it broke his ui.
---
Better than all the mana I would have gotten from it.
---
&gt;Just because I don't want to quit doesn't mean I can't.
---
Duh? That idea applies to literally every addiction case, minor or not. Everyone has the ability to quit something, the challenge of getting over an addiction is how difficult it is to quit. A gaming addiction may be harmless at first, but it can take a very small amount of time to get fired from a job for not showing up. Hell, there are kids who have died due to neglect because their parents had WoW addictions! I would have to classify that as an adverse consequence, but maybe that's just me. 
---
Don't undersell addiction, it can snowball very easily. I was a functioning alcoholic for 2 years before it started affecting my life. But it only took less than 6 months for it to spiral out of control. Cost me a good relationship, and affected me legally. Almost cost me a good job, but I had a very cool and understanding boss who worked with me because I was honest with him. You may not see the consequences of an addiction in the beginning, but I assure you they're there.
---
RIP: Reroll now, mail pet to your new main.
---
no. you don't want protection on your healer or tank. People putting the condom on the healer is why there aren't enough healers in the world!
---
So of the special mounts:
---
* Paladin and Warlock mounts - Are technically spells and don't use any riding skill
---
* Winterspring Frostsaber - requires Tiger Riding, so Exalted with Darnassus
---
* Rare drop mounts/AV mounts/AQ mounts - no skill required
---
Woosh
---
Even thick is pretty ass on my server. We are talking maybe a few silver above the vendor price, you just can't afford much failure on your auctions with that.
---
Now Goldthorn let me tell you that's basically thorny gold.
---
It's like being surprised when someone brings up the zombie apocalypse.
---
This is tuned so incredibly easy compared to the private servers most people are coming from that there is basically no reason at all to make people play approved specs only.
---
The only way to get guaranteed catches there are having 300 fishing skill + Big Iron Fishing Pole + Aquadynamic Fish Attractor
---
How did you afford your mount at 40? What did you do specifically? Where did you go and what activity did you perform? I'm gathering data 🤓
---
You don't know why even though blizzard tells you why so show us the e-mail coward
---
Maybe it was harrasmet of low level people?
---
Yeah just look up brd torch xp runs and in game I ran it the last two days no xp from them
---
This is why they raised the Threat multiplier for tanks in WotLK from 1.3x up to 2x. The vast majority of DPS players are so dumb they couldn't pass The Marshmellow Test.
---
They usually accept my big vagina DPS, so you should try your luck.
---
People like to pretend they can predict market trends, but nobody can. They will go down, then up, then down again, back and forth til the end of time. There is always a need for them, and sometimes all it takes is someone who's rich and impatient to come in and drive prices up again. Nobody can predict that.
---
That’s no moon
---
found the NPC. she has very short hot pants on
---
Fishing you say.  What fish are selling best?
---
I got ganked by ally multiple times last night on Skeram, buck up baby boy
---
I think the price will stay steady in phase 1. Because more people hit 60 the demand AND supply increases. And as more people hit 60 more people will be raiding which will decrease the price of devilsaur.
---
Who hurt you?
---
That’s fair, so probably one of those things where once you start to out scale the content and struggle more with just threat rather than survivability you could switch it out. And then if you’re going back into new or current progression content the warden staff would be the better choice again.
---
I wish I knew the answer I keep making alts to store stuff on
---
Mark the damn targets and this isn't necessary
---
Uhhh the whale tail... I mean green triangle is banish
---
Does this work on all enemy types? Does it do damage?
---
Sounds like you exploited a glitch, got banned for it and now you are trying to underplay what you did
---
- BadDPS 3:16
---
I’m pretty sure they said that layering would be removed come phase 2.  But I don’t have a quote on that
---
Having a flat 5% crit is better than having the chance to proc an additional attack while leveling. Your human racial adds some hit while leveling but you still miss too much for it to make up for that 5% crit. 
---
Also the axes available while leveling are way better
---
I've been trying to hold on to my crimson one to sell later, but I am afraid that I'm going to feel the need to flex soon and just impulse summons it.
---
Technically, it started with Aeon of Strife in StarCraft. Dota was initially more or less just a port of that.
---
Transfer aborted is the message received when the server fails to successfully load you into the zone you’re moving into, when on a flight path this typically means you fall off the gryphon and die :/ it’s a bug from retail that made its way to classic due to backporting the 7.3.5 client to run the game
---
mages are just broken AF all around in terms of being an overloaded class w/ way too many options and strengths
---
I know.  It is also the Perfect imitation of every shithead ever.
---
U chill bro.  sheesh
---
Tauren Dick Heals \[here\]
---
Back when I raised the diamond was the mark of shame that you would get for fucking up.
---
I'm really considering abandoning my PvE server and going to a more populated PvP server. I just looked at the census data for my server and its not great compared to almost all of the PvP servers (I know census data is broken now but it's all I've got to go on.) According to the census data my entire server only has a few dozen people at level 60, less than 100 people at each level from 50+, and this is across both factions. Most characters on the server seem to be in the 20's and then a sharp drop off into the 30s. And this is pretty apparent from playing too. There don't seem to be any large guilds, and no one is doing higher level dungeons. Personally, I've been pushing hard to hit 60 and start doing end game content, and it's looking like that just isn't happening on this server. My progress has come to a stop because at 48 I can't even find dungeon groups.
---
So now I have a decision to make. Do I reroll on a new server and completely start over with a new main? (The thought of releveling a paladin makes me ill.) Do I stay here for now, grind it out to 60 and hope Blizzard offers server transfers in the near future? Or, do I stay and hope that the server I'm on doesn't die if it's not dead already?
---
Gotta love when it happens!
---
For more people saying the same thing as me, go checkout Frost's video about this and sort the comments by 'new'. It's a lot of people saying the drop rates are much lower in classic.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh3fUKhN91Q&amp;t=538s
---
Exactly
---
You both are saying the same thing, he’s just arguing that it’s hypocritical that it works one way but not the reverse.
---
If you were, you would be fighting easy wins.
---
Seems like this has upset a lot of people on this subreddit.
---
1. They signed up for a PvP server so they should have been prepared for the consequences to begin with.
---
2. Alliance players do the same thing. I have clips of them camping out at the graveyard just to kill players taking resurrection sickness and passersby.
---
3. They responded in kind before and after this recording with raid parties of their own as well as the level 60 priest at the end of the video.
---
Fun fact, prior to this recording the fights were mostly at the graveyard as we pushed players all the way back to their flight point. The retaliatory raid that followed managed to push us out so we backed off and did the next best thing.
---
If you can't take the stings don't shake the hive.
---
Yeah I was running some Lib yesterday and I always ask my healer if its alright if I tank with my WW axe. When things get hairy I pull out my shield. I open in server stance but then go to defensive and still throw sunders out with my 2h. The axe allows me to do more damamge but I still take the precautions to keep my threat high

Don't be a fucking tool, you know class balance in TBC was better.

lmfao, if you think those are all copies then I don't know how to help you.

Maybe get your grandson to help you with the computer-ma-jiggy?
---
No XP or very little? It's always been like 10 XP per mob, its just the sheer amount you kill makes it worth it
---
That's fine if you feel that way. Feel free to roll on things in whatever way you see fit. I've personally learned not to expect pugs to be selfless. If someone in the group is cool and I've run with them a couple times, sure I'll pass on it. But no way I'm trusting some random I've never seen before to do "what's right".
---
Yeah. That's skarms server right? Figures! All the feral fans are playing there!
---
You'll see when your kids are a couple of years older and in school. You may be fine living in the stone age at your house, but your kids are in for a shock when they enter the school system at the age of 4 or 5 and they're surrounded by it. Not to mention it will be hard for them to associate with other kids who are talking about their favorite show or character, and your kids have never heard of it because you make them watch VHS movies. It sounds like maybe both of you have self control issues if you can't handle having technology in your home without being able to pay attention to the kids too?
---
The thing is, its an RP server, what element of RP are they trying to get into their game, just being assholes or what?
---
Earth elementals in the Badlands
---
I never kill low level players, it's pointless.  This would be a dumb thing to lie about.
---
Or... Just add more servers.
---
Came to say the same thing. That big heal took like a year to cast... no interrupt, just SS spam.
---
&gt; Dal rends are good for hunters, so why not. 
---
The set is "okay" for hunters, but the individual items are pretty trashy.  Overall, this set is meant much more for a melee class, rather than a ranged one.
---
&gt; Its similar to how warriors have bis gear thats leather, but how people expect them to pass because its leather. But when it comes to passing cloth armor as a non cloth to heal, people turn a blind eye.
---
I've always hated that.  People should stop stealing gear from clothies or leather wearers if they need it, because they can't roll on your plate.   If somebody really wants an item that's not their armor type, they should be rolling need only if everybody else already has it.
---
OBS is extremely user friendly.
---
Fuck off, I’ve got work to do
---
This is the shit you people upvote?
---
Yeah I agree ! what would be classic+ anyway?
---
DD is somewhere between 1/3 and 1/2 of Grobbulus from the last stats I saw. Ive been on the realm for a month and it is actually quite optimal - low competition for quest mobs, low ganking, but still able to easily find groups for every dungeon.
---
The part I'm impressed about is that's dang near my BC markings, minus I used Star for sap instead.
---
&gt; and they're happy being wildly dominant population wise.
---
Thats what I was responding to mainly. I included the person you responded to in my comment because it was relevant.
---
I get what you're saying though, underdog servers are the best. It feels like a survival game instead of an MMO.
---
Is that something easy to do? There are times I'd love a layer change. No idea how to do it though.
---
&gt;star chief.
---
Rogues are dicks and need condomes. And priests are super stars. Easy to remember.
---
Superdata has been known to have bad intelligence, and it's certainly not "pulled" from atvi's earning summary lol. 
---
Again, not saying it's not likely, but that figure is very far from official.
---
/point
---
I get this completely, the only thing that doesn't make sense is the party leader wasn't suspended.  2 other players weren't suspended.  And the gm afterwards said it was for "disruptive behavior".
---
I always look in my bags after some dungeon runs and think "oh i won that"
---
Why does everyone hate the dungeon finder? Personally i like having to run to the instance and not being teleported but i like not having to spam Heal LFG while im trying to quest in the meantime of looking for a group. I can see flying killing the game, takes out almost all exploration and i hate that max levels can just swoop in two hit you swoop out lol, they still do it with mounts but i at least see them coming i guess. Idk, i agree with taking out flying but dungeon finder i like lol
---
THERE ARE NO BARBER SHOPS??!!! I have made a grave mistake...
---
Nice speech man 👌☺️
---
Yeah I actually remember a few people on my server that were just hanging out in org at 60 full t3 no xpak though.
---
I was gonna say a pant stain, but this is also fine
---
it's a culture shock.
---
you have retail player who can spot bad tank and aren't afraid of calling them out... just like bad DPS get called out.
---
but you also have Pserver / returning player who are used to tanks being absolute gods who can't do no wrong... no matter how awfull they are.
---
You are probably on Skeram.
---
Only place to kill mobs efficiently would be dungeons lol.
---
Yep condom goes on the tank star on healer when protection is needed.
---
Did you learn the world tantrum yesterday? Cause you don't know what it means lol.
---
Y u so triggered haha madcauzebad
---
Yeah, activating Cold Blood is just his way of declaring his commitment to pacifism.
---
I’ll be more focused towards the rep since I’ll have better gear than any rank I’ll ever achieve.
---
Try picking the right targets from 30m+ back when they're in a huge pack..
---
My guild on Sulfuras-US Alliance is named "Shaman Trainer." Many times I've been standing somewhere and someone will say out loud "Why does alliance have shaman trainers?" It's wonderful.
---
In vanilla. Got the terms mixed up. Whoopsie!
---
This is the most white-knight bullshit comment I've ever seen.
---
Slut shaming?  Really?
---
&gt;**Slut-shaming** is the practice of criticizing people, especially women and girls, who are perceived to violate expectations of behavior and appearance regarding issues related to sexuality
---
I mean, for fuck's sake, selling your bath water is a violation of more than just people's expectations of behavior and appearance.  It's a violation of human decency.  
---
It's perfectly all right for people to find the fact that she did this offensive, and it doesn't make them slut-shamers for it.  Get off your white shining high horse and take off your gleaming armor.
---
Or.. you know.. people can set up their own marks. I always use star for sap and square for poly, trinagle is hunter trap etc.
---
As long as your raid is aware of what the marks mean its no problem.
---
Hell in some instances you need more than one of a certain cc. Like banish. Just assign players to marks and go
---
The saddest AH
---
Also doing top dps with one spell. I mean, it is what it is. Keep classic unchanged. But no one would let this fly in a normal game.
---
I second this. I could play BC and no other game for the rest of my life.
---
R14 lock osmo nordrasil eu..... never again...war kodo and done. R14 doesnt mean skill just time invested
---
i think the rogue was just bad
---
This is legit... please take this humble updoot. lol
---
People dont make bis lists for pve arms because its a garbage spec. Weapon skill doesnt really matter in PvP.
---
Ugh, are you serious? That's horrible, but sigh at least with the skinning that's some money to the vendor for the thick leather. What's the situation for rugged?
---
I stand by my point. Luckily it has not been an issue.
---
Maybe need to wait for more people to get the gear patterns and for people to be high enough to be in the market for that gear
---
Not a single word in your post was an answer to his question.
---
I would love to agree but one thing I have noticed being in /world and /lfg and /LookingForGroup on a very populated server is that the messages go flying by so quickly, it's hard to read any of them. the ones that pop up same message 3 in a row are actually easier to read before they're gone off my screen. But I think both factors are kinda terrible.
---
I really liked how clean your setup was and it looked like this would be exactly what I was looking for to set up my RP char with.
---
Thanks for the reply and the details, found a lot of inspiration in this 😊
---
I hate that I get this reference.
---
Just being "kill the alliance" or whatever, I guess. It's hard to say.
---
And also why I avoid RP in general.
---
Not trying to be an asshole. But sounds like you rushed your server decision and rushed to 60 without proper planning for raids/guild.. would it not have been more logical to jump around servers and FIND a guild needing a tank? And then roll on that server accordingly- considering you had no Previous guild obligation
---
But it doesn't make him look as good with programming
---
One thing you could do, and it would help ensure you get a core raiding spot, is find one of the better guilds working their way to raid status and help people close the gap to 60 or help them get their pre-raid BiS gear. It's less stress than starting your own guild, but contributing to the health of the guild itself will go a long way in proving yourself to be a guild asset. Granted its kind of a crapshoot which guilds might be on their way that will actually make it, but when you have no other options it's certainly something to work towards.
---
I mean, because selling your bath water is incredibly repulsive?  Is that really that hard to grasp??
---
Then what? You’re still stuck at Wotlk+? Everything you said is null for the fact it’s the path to retail. If blizzard does a + I can guarantee you it’s classic+ and not Wotlk+...
---
Half the stories on here feel fake to me, seems like a lot of karma whoring going on imo
---
We cleared ZF with a full group of level 42's.
---
But this community is full of toxic people whom say you must meet their standards or you won't get invited...
---
nobody knows this, wait for blizzcon
---
Fine i'll click all your links even though my comment was more about how neither of you were using any substance in your back and forth and less about layering. 
---
1. Someone disappeared while chatting. 
---
Who cares. 
---
2. Someone couldn't see an enemy during pvp.
---
Probably just joined the layer and was experiencing a delayed swap. 
---
3. Ogrimmar looks empty
---
Who cares
---
You see where i'm going with this? There are legitimate ways to exploit layers. These examples you're posting are just minor meaningless inconveniences that have 0 lasting impact.
---
If you want simple melee, you can just go rogue. Grab two swords, forget backstab, pack a couple of bandages and offf you go.
---
It's not the easiest, hunter or warlock should speed things up, but it's a step up from warrior.
---
I can take higher level mobs in my 15ish rogue. Look up a guide.
---
Weird, I don't remember posting this. But it describes my wow experience exactly
---
Blasted Lands is a hoot. I'm a Dwarf Priest, and was running along when I noticed I was frost shocked.  
---
Ok, who did that? I turn and see an elemental shammy, and proceed to silence him and go to town. It would have been an easy fight, but a Horde warrior shows up, and proceeds to spam /beg at me. I think to myself... well, the shaman started it, so I'll finish it.  
---
I'm not sure if the warrior thought I was the aggressor or not, but he proceeded to join in and kill me. I was sad. I enjoy 1v1s but they generally don't happen for me.
---
Lol you're wrong just accept it. Leather isn't just for rogues.
---
But the point is this is a bug correct?  Even if OP is correct it's something that should be fixed, not theorycrafted.
---
Unless PW:S did in fact let rage through in vanilla, which I don't believe it ever did but my memory isn't perfect.
---
Makes you wonder where the Horde version of this is~
---
10 days of actual, non-afk /played to 60 is definitely pretty damn bad.  That's an average of 4h per level - only the worst levels (such as late 40s for example) should take that long, maybe.  All other levels, especially the first half or so, should take significantly less.  240 is along the lines of what I might expect if I was questing blind (no guide/addon) and only wowheaded half of them.  And was on a full server.
---
I looted one too but I play rogue so I can’t use pets or it makes my stealth useless lol
---
Christ, just tell me it’s not my guild. 
---
I already have concerns as is.
---
We are stuck with layering anyways. Blizz should sort toons by level so the higher level players are playing together and the mid level players are playing together and the lowbies are playing together.
---
My thoughts exactly
---
Following
---
Marking your tank and healer can provide a lot of help in a good group or be completely useless to a bad group.
---
I thought that might be Cold Blood, but I thought "Nah, no way!".  What we're they planning CS with SS CB? Doesn't matter, he's a rookie. We have all been there before. I remember back in Vanilla I played rogue and had no clue what I was doing.
---
Why? What about mage or poly means moon?
---
Huh, the interface looks a bit different than I remember it...
---
&gt;3 No witch hunts or brigading. Don’t encourage others to harass individuals or organizations either within or beyond this community.
---
Yeah, these are exactly how I've seen them used since vanilla. (Often triangle is banish too)
---
About 8 chances of things being added. I'd say between 3 and 6 things.
---
Hey that's not true. It's somewhere between zero and 100%!
---
Not to revive this dead post, but I had to scour the internet to find **SOME** complaint about these things.  What the fuck is this balance for real? I'm level 7 rogue fighting a level 8 Voodoo Troll and they are **LITERALLY** mathematically unkillable for me at that level lmao.  Like there mana bar is big enough to outsustain me in a fight even when using a health potion.
---
I get this game is technically like old as fuck but DAMN that is some bunk ass, downright sad game design lmao
---
How many people are actually deciding what to play based on what your potential future raid needs? It might take weeks to hit 60 depending on how much you play, people won't wait that long for you.
---
Activating cold blood removes stealth. What you are seeing on the rogue is the debuff from it which lasts like 30 sec to a min after using cold blood.
---
&gt;That's my opinion and I'll play the game as I want. The community and mid-dungeon banter is what I play for. Overall my opinion is that clearing dungeons as fast as possible and optimizing MC and Onyxia raid-comps is pointless. If the top guilds can 20-man Onyxia right now and MC is being one-shot by even A and B-tier guilds on my server.. you most definitely do not need an optimized raid group or pre-bis to clear MC or Onyxia.
---
The reason people want optimized raids is because a raid full of meme specs will take significantly longer to clear faceroll content.
---
Go with the actual loot table drop rates. If someone flips a coin four times with the results of THHH...what are the odds that the next flip is T? We are biased to see patterns and will think the odds of T being the next result is higher than H because randomness doesn't do patterns....even though THTHTH is just as random as HHHHHH we see a pattern but the previous flips have no influence on future flips, they are all independent. 
---
WoW ends up going into the Law of Large Numbers  that describes the result of performing the same experiment a large number of times. Where the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value, and will tend to become closer as more trials are performed. If you have a team member who saw the drop twice doesn't increase the odds that it will drop but that this will even out down the road to the possibility they won't see it again for 50 runs.
---
Herod
---
No blood elves, no eversong woods, if you want to see what areas are in classic, I’d just look at a map of vanilla Azeroth :) 
---
No one knows where blizzard will eventually take classic, but there are many speculations among reddit posts and blizzard forums
---
I did both routes - I found the WPL route to be less deaths since you don’t need to go near UC.
---
Just watch for bears and you’re fine
---

Entitled Warriors. It's BIS for Enhancement too.    
---
On the Horde side, you literally have an entire gear class dedicated to only you. Mail items are made available to both Shaman and Warriors.
---
My bank alt is on the slow grind to 35 on a druid, so I can use her as a Mooncloth slave. (Teleport: Moonglade is the closest Horde moonwell.)
---
It's an exaggeration, but in comparison to getting the Dal Rends combo, it's a much easier farm (especially since you'll have zero competition for it).
---
This almost feels like a shit post. But just incase
---
No official word on whats happening after the 6 phase releases. 
---
The BE starting area isnt in game, everything else from the main world is though (as far as I can tell). Other than Kara...hopefully that will come in time.
---
Wow, I guess if South Park says it's okay to use homophobic slurs then it's totally fine.
---
Well.. Right in the feels... Sorry for your loss man.
---
Didn't wanna ask, but. How you finding leveling with Fire?
---
You are not a slow lvler if you are lvl 50 lol
---
He is 1 level above the rogue and the rogue most likely does not have any points in Master of Deception or Camoflage, so he is easier to detect and slower in stealth. You can tell rogue is specced heavily into assassination tree because he has "Cold Blood" which requires 21 of the 22 points this level 31 rogue had.
---
I shame mark my healer with nipple and give myself star for tanking cuz I'm the star of the group.
---
My sources say 4.5 things. Might be too early to tell, I could see from .25-.75 additional things
---
I just wish blizzard was more direct about what they see as an exploit vs. What they see as fair play, since there doesn't seem to be any consensus. I am very tempted to user layers to help find rare spawns but I personally feel it's against the spirit of the game and possibly the tos so I won't.
---
Haha I can def see the benefit. Maybe I’d suck less if they were marked for me.
---
The best is to do the first transmute your self, sand then just trade it for mats + gold. That way no one can be scammed.
---
Numpad if you got one.
---
Literally I bound the marks to my numberpad and I can mark quickly and easily.
---
Exactly.  These are bound hot keys for me and its just kill kill second cc1 cc2 cc3.
---
I'm not defending the hate but at the same time advertising a guild based on what genital you like to suck is just always going to attract trolls.
---
Maybe he just has a sense of humor?
---
I think he's just RP'ING a goblin. "Time is money, friend".
---
Start your own guild and make it your challenge to host your own pugs until you can fill it with only guildies. Or try to co-host pugs. If you're raid ready you should have your spot as one of the tanks sorted

Druid is super fun in and has a lot of depth in pvp. [https://youtu.be/vCvb8MwvsD4](https://youtu.be/vCvb8MwvsD4) Outplays like these as a "underdog" class/spec make the class so rewarding
---
Star is always healer when I play.
---
I am leveling a Druid this time around (played lock and rogue through BC) and I am slowly learning this. 
---
When I pull 3-4 mobs at a time, I find myself having to switch forms to be able to fight it out. I realize that can definitely help in a pvp fight as well (prolonging the battle and healing as best as I can).
---
i always used &amp; saw sap on triangle and banish diamond
---
Well if someone is fighting around a herb, either ask him or wait a second when he killed the mob, so you know if he wants the herb. His response on the other hand is way over the top, its like the good old day, when the fathers uncles etc worked at blizzard and get you banned \^.\^
---
This is beautiful
---
It seems a bit buggy, too, esp. sensitive to hunter pets (which seem a bit buggy in general). Can't remember how often we've accidentally pulled groups from the lower part and nobody was even close to the ledge..
---
It is still really helpful to easily spot where tank/healer is if you are doing anything difficult in nature.
---
&gt;I myself personally love it but at the same time I know it can be taxing on not speced/inexperienced healers.
---
It isn't. Any healer who isn't literal trash can heal a 4dps/2h tank group all the way to 60 on an offspec.

Selling your bath water isn't "exhibiting sexuality" and it's something that could genuinley make people sick.

If she took a shit in a box and sold it, am I then allowed to be disgusted?  If someone drinks her bath water and gets sick, what then?  When am I allowed to have an opinion on this that doesn't get blanket categorized into a column of something oppressive?

Let me know what the rules are please.

I thought Skeram was an Elder Scrolls game?

---
As a rogue with sap, I wish there was more CC but I guess it’s not really needed in 1.12.
---
I didn't say it was okay, I just said it reminds me and it was a funny episode.
---
Yeah, as Horde on Skeram these posts are being so overdramatic. Sure Horde outnumber Alliance. But there were still tons of Alliance in every zone I was in last night. Some were ganking, some were friendly, but there were still TONS of them. Desolace, STV, Badlands, Ashenvale, Tanaris, etc. So a handful of guilds moved, great. But the whole "lol no alliance left on skeram" thing is stupid.
---
As a priest I often wreck rouges but I avoid shamans.
---
And you cant stay within the context of the comment. Troll is best PvE tank top to bottom of all PvE content, not just the bullshit that you tank like RFC. Every reason ThePrimalShift said is spot on, and Tauren aren’t bad, they just aren’t the best.

Calm down man, it's literally just some pixels

What server are you on?

Nice try blizzard
---
Thanks these are some really good tips!

I guess even if I have dots up on him and he vanishes he could still use a ability before it ticks and drops him out of stealth.

Lots of stuff to work on here 😁

So being a raid MT was never an easy thing in vanilla - it was always well known that tanks were sparse for leveling, but that there was a glut of them at max level.  You only need 1 MT for 40 people.  Most of the people rolling warriors who knew what was up were planning on being melee dps from the start.
---
Ideally, you would have made connections while leveling and gotten in to a guild that had enough people.  That obv didn't happen, so the next step is to go through your list of contacts and see what guilds have 60s - then rather than organizing a guild, organize a cross guild raiding group.  There are plenty of mages/warriors at 60, so dps shouldn't be an issue.  You're MT, so that's no issue.  You just need to make sure there are enough healers and you should be good.  Open up a google sheet to track raid contributions, joint raid group discord channel, etc.  
---
It's going to be herding cats, but you don't need a dedicated guild to form a raiding group.(it just makes it waaaay easier)  Be sure that leaders of each guild know that the first couple of attempts are probably going to be overcoming kinks in the system. 
---
Getting pre raid dps BiS and trying to go as dps is also an option.  You can grab tanking gear after the MT is full, and you'll have your foot in the door to eventually tank.  But keep in mind that the current raiding groups are pretty solid on people and have a long line of people wanting to raid.  But again, you can make use of that long line to make your own group.
---
Anyone having issues with sweeping strikes? I feel like I’ll have two mobs literally on top of one another and my strikes don’t sweep. It feels like it happens over half the time, but I may be inflating that.
---
I've cleared Naxx. Tanks shouldn't even be spending their first globals on sunder as they can do more threat with other abilities. Look at the top level guilds the fury warriors use their first global to apply sunder, not the tank.
---
Just general privacy, polite thing to do. Some people may not wish to have their names on forums outside the game
---
Fucking thank you... "Oh the politically correct crowd ruins something else!" 
---
No, no they didn't. I swear people are addicted to rage and fear of change. King of the Hill made a joke about people being outraged because of the "PC culture" in the 90's.
---
I think in 5 person groups we usually just declare once inside.  Tank would call symbol for main target and second target, and then symbols for  CC.  If you're on a dedicated raid team though, then a chart like this probably is predetermined and understood.
---
Can we stop posting assclowngold videos
---
Basically yeah. You will want Nicker or Retaliator in the 50s, when AV comes out everyone will want Ice Barbed Spear at 51 but that looks to be quite a ways away.
---
Once you're at 60 the usual BIS is Arcanite Reaper but both Blackhand Doomsaw and Demonshear are good too, and there are two epic swords that are rare drops. So you'd use whichever one you get first really.
---
Warlocks do. SS, DOT, Fear, hide. Rinse and repeat.
---
Thank you,  I completely forgot pets have a spellbook to be entirely honest, I am new to hunter as a whole so never even thought to look for an actual spellbook

Agreed. Star is sap.

I love pulling out the bear dance whenever I'm waiting for boats.
---
I get where you're coming from, but retail *literally* came from vanilla. So it's not slippery to say that "this could happen" because history shows it has happened. It's not guaranteed to happen again, or in the exact same way, but it's not a logical fallacy to point out the historically accurate path that the game took from vanilla to retail.
---
New age gamer, you would’ve never survived MW2 Xbox lobby chat. Was a bloodbath of racial slurs and suggestive content

Don't worry Blizzard has said they are delaying phase 2 until they can restore the hotpants.
---
I use to 2 man farm bed as rogue/druid with lava emp runs. It's a myth and doesnt exist.
---
Sorry, it's reserved.
---
Why do you do this shit, Leeroy?
---
I started tanking in WotLK, but now I'm maining druid tank and had a hard time keeping aggro properly. With this comment you just made me a better tank, thank you.
---
Rogues are shit at this game
---
No this game is made by Blizzard
---
I like this saying.
---
Does that mean you only dragged it off the bar, not right clicked it to turn off autocast? If so, then your pet was growling through the dungeon.
---
As a healer, I tend to mark the tank if the melee dps and tank are too similar looking. Gotta be able to easily see who I can let die :p
---
You are right that people on PvP servers should know this is something they will have to deal with, but it doesn't make anyone that does this any less of a toxic asshat.
---
what are you talking about?   thts exactly what happened here
---
Don't listen to the comments in this thread - you did the right thing. Using slurs is absolutely 100% against the ToS and isn't allowed. Report report report ain't nobody got time for bullshit
---
You kinda need to spec Improved Blizzard, it makes a huge difference. +Int gear or +Int/+Stamina gear in all slots also makes a huge difference because it's important to have a big mana pool.
---
Once you have that, you gather up as many melee mobs as possible, by combining body pulling and some wand shooting. I like having at least 30% HP left at this point in case something goes wrong, but it's possible to go lower. Anyway, once they're gathered up, pop Frost Nova, Blink away, then cast Blizzard. 
---
When Blizzard stops channeling you can cast it again if the distance is enough for another full channeling. If you need more distance to the mobs you just run and cast Blizzard again when you've gained enough distance.
---
Theoretically you can get 3x Blizzard in but at this point I like to use Cone of Cold. Then you should have another Frost Nova ready and you can either continue with Blink-&gt;Blizzard or just spam Arcane Explosion if they don't have too much HP left.
---
The main pitfall is mobs resisting your Frost Nova or somehow resisting Blizzard long enough to lose the slow. If this happens you need to GTFO and heal or you will die. Same if you pull a ranged mob, GTFO and heal before reattempting. Also if you run out of mana you likely have to pop a mana pot or you will die.
---
If alliance types Kek does it come across as Lol to horde?
---
Had no idea common lol was “bur” haha
---
Why have fear listed instead of banish? Imo banish is MUCH more useful than fear - rarely (if EVER) should you fear when your objective is to CC, not pull more mobs from your feared target...
---
My former coworker isn't allowed to watch anything above PG or own a TV, because of sin. He's in his 50's!!

&gt;&gt; Many IRL friend groups split up across servers due to the initial launch problems.
---
So is this you?
---
There's plenty of time to reroll on a new server or faction.  It took years for this to get added in Vanilla and it was the beginning of the end of the 'community' aspect of servers.  So I say no thanks.
---
Everything seems right except I've only ever seen Star as Sap and Orange as Shackle. Of course, it depends on the raid for some of them but unless sap isn't possible, my experience is that star is ALWAYS sap
---
I auto downvote these posts now :l
---
Is there a benefit to going a near-even split between fire and frost? There's already a ton of spells to spam if you go either full frost or full fire.
---
To each their own. I like the triangle to be the first kill. It's like a hunter's mark pointing to the mob to be killed....I'm sure I'll get flax for this but oh well lol
---
I've been playing online games for +10 years so it's nothing new to me. A few years ago I would've ignored it. However, it's 2019, the world is changing and I think it's time to let people know that this behaviour isn't ok.
---
Great tribute. Go with honor, Scribler
---
Yeah, I mean, I follow your logic for sure. 
---
I could see a hunter rolling on Dal'rends being frustrating but reasonable the same way I could see a Warrior rolling on the Crossbow being frustrating but reasonable. 
---
Regardless, i wish you luck on your rolls!
---
Locks can beat S priest unless they are undead and open up with fear.. then you’re pretty much going to die if their fear lasts more than 5 sec. only way to win is if you pop your CDs and get a little lucky. Also depends on which pet you have out
---
2 seconds plus regen-ing the mana. Depends on what the mage is doing, don't you think? Sitting on the ground surrounded by dead mobs drinking, clearly about to kill more mobs? A tip would be great if not required.
---
In town standing at the auction house? A tip is nice but not to necessary.
---
What... This is more revealing now
---
My advice? Aim high
---
I sold the warden staff for 100g because of the comments on wowhead. It won’t harm you to post it up for 600/700g then slowly lower it until someone is prepared to buy. Don’t be impulsive/impatient like me :)

First troll the guy was a real jerk.

Second troll: Pick-pocketing Thrall? Come one that's HILARIOUS!

Mage stat priority is +dmg &gt; int &gt; spirit. If you're getting hit as a mage you're doing it wrong.
---
Telling people to redo everything again is a pretty terrible way of making "new" stuff.
---
Yeah. Exactly why OP should have browsed discord and said “hey I’m trying to play xxxx and I expect to be 60 in roughly xxxx weeks” surely there’s a guild that will take you. My guilds not raiding for another month and MAYBE  20!of us are 50+
---
Actually my bank information and CC info has plenty of 23456789s

Faction changes is a terrible idea, server transfers will be implemented when populations stabilize. Give it a minute would ya.
---
I did wonder if this would make reddit. I guess so. Hey all, Horde Valanar here [https://imgur.com/hiIPLPm](https://imgur.com/hiIPLPm)
---
my bank alt had a broom with crusader on it. still have that item on my main character in retail
---
This is kind of my sentiment. I feel like WoW is a great place to get *away* from stressful, controversial conversations. I'm 29, engaged, and have many socio-political opinions - but none of that shit matters when I see a Gnome walking the Gold Road. 99.99% of people I play with will never learn anything personal about me. I'm all for pride and whatnot, but posting your age, gender, or sexual orientation in a forum that doesn't require it *at all* is just asking for abuse. This is the internet.
---
If strictly comparing the two abilities, Tranquil Air totem is 20% threat reduction and group-wide while a paladin can bless salvation (which gives 30% threat reduction) on the whole raid (excluding tanks obv).
---
Since the biggest limiter for dps is usually tank threat, Windfury dropped in the tank’s group is going to be more valuable than 20% threat reduction for one group of dps.
---
Damn you Golemagg for dropping my Mageblade and giving it to me, why would you do this!!! &lt;3
---
15 ish silver for greater magic wand on my server

my record in vanilla so far is beating 2 red levels, ive goy t 3 yellows/greens a few times. Allies on kurinnaxx run like 6 deep so im almost always outnumbered its great for improving my gank game

"You're post"
---
If she doesn't remember these; she's too retail for you, bro.
---
That's pretty selfish and shortsighted. The state of some classes/specs are dogshit and they deserve another look eventually.
---
Thanks my dude!!
---
I agree. However, in a guild with +100 people, where everyone should feel welcome, included, and not be harassed I don't think it's ok to call someone a fag in the way they did.
---
He is! Surgery went very well, thank you for asking :)
---
Befores go before the after... You read right to left or something?
---
It's a condom wrapper ok
---
Classic never had these.
---
Could also be useless in a good group. I can see the benefit, though and would actually like to see it more often.
---
Yeah, and tell them to suck your balls. Parents love it when you talk to them like that.
---
If you're playing against a bad rogue then yes. But a good rogue will keep you stunlocked and pop evasion when you come out of the stun. You can try to kite but they will pop Sprint to keep up with you.  Success against rogues is entirely up to catching them offguard and opening on them
---
Oh shit i was on Stormmrage i didnt know we had such a fucked up balance.
---
How do i make money this way?
---
star is sap idiot
---
Ravager procs + berserker stance means 0 avoidance despite your level and increased damage taken.
---
I don't know if he was in full plate or just mail.  But even base 5% parry, 5% dodge, 5% block gives you a massive reduction in damage taken over none at all.
---
What if I told you I disenchanted it.
---
I've been noticing a few things like that.  I have a female undead and whenever she leans forward while mounted the saddle horn clips through her back.
---
Excuse me it's not a circle,  it's a nipple.
---
Thanks mate, I agree. :)
---
Blizzard shouldnt do a damn thing. Let everyone sort things out themselves. They produced the game.  Now it's up to us to form our communities. People transfering and so own isnt blizzards problem.  Faction imbalance isnt a blizzard problem. Everything is a usee problem. Trying to get blizzard to heard us around and treat us like sheep isnt a solution. If you want more balance. Re roll to a server that fits your needs. If the user would just make some effort they would be somewhat satisfied. Blizzard needs to wait a few months before the open the gates to transfers. ASAP? For what? To satisfy you the user? The people who love this game will play regardless and if they hate their server will just reroll.
---
The boss at the zombie spot drops a staff that gives +21 spell damage.
---
PvP-wise that sounds quite hopelessly useless. Personally I discard most +sp because it's +dmg is so low before you start hitting dungeon blues 54+.
---
Which server has the most UK guilds?
---
I live in Portugal and cant make it home in time to meet the common 6/7pm raid schedule. Maybe the British guilds have a similar timetable than mine?
---
Gotcha, cheers.
---
True, however when an alliance warrior takes the name. Mans got to do, what a mans got to do :)
---
I put a skull on onyxia just so people know to kill her first.
---
Someone’s stupid spam made you almost quit a video game you love? Yikes! Ignore and move on.
---
that's interesting considering wotlk was the shackle undead heaviest expansion
---
When Classic was first announced, there was very little information on the implementation. This sub-reddit and the forums were flooded with many different suggestions on how they wanted it implemented, with varying levels of 'purity' demanded. #nochanges started as a fight against game design changes (personally my thoughts were keep game balance/design the way it was, but transition to the modern UI). Eventually #nochanges became the go to single word response to shout down anybody the purist disagreed with, and kind of came to represent a mix of 'keep vanilla vanilla' and 'easy d-bag detector'.
---
As far as things go now, Blizz is committed to keeping Classic a 'museum piece' in terms of how they are handing maintaining it. The content deployment phases will take \~2 years, so alternate development wouldn't be until after that anyways. Kind of silly to see Classic+ came up before it was even released, and now that people have blown through the first bit of content in a few weeks, some are clamoring for more.
---
Why are you even here then? This place is nothing but stale memes and garbage.
---
"Utopia"? Hardly. My son hates it there. It totally sucks! Don't go there!! My ungrateful wretch of a crotchspawn is a total crybaby and makes terrible decisions!!! Don't follow his lead!!!! The other day I caught him watching a Forknife stream!!!!!
---
At this point I've come to the conclusion English is confusing. I can spell just fine.
---
I use skull for focus and literally any other one except X for cc.
---
I personally never *spam* lifetap in a fight.   I will throw one in between spells occasionally to make sure I'm not wasting regen/renew/siphon/drain but on a typical pull I would mostly only tap twice.
---
If shit has hit the fan and its down to me to burn down some mobs before its a full wipe I will totally sacrifice myself down to nothing to  put out the DPS if it saves anyone,  cloth repairs are cheap..
---
Reads as "I was hoping to cheese my way to lvl 60 but now that it looks like it's harder than expected I cant be asked to play regularly instead.
---
Most comparable to priest I think. It's slow but steady. You shouldn't die, can comfortably stay at full health, and have big cooldowns to help with soloing hard quests. You feel very strong in 2-3 man groups as the hybrid nature of the class really kicks in (dps, healing, tanking and buffing everyone at the same time).
---
While leveling, retribution has comparable single-target dps to pure dps classes in my experience, but you do lack any mechanic to pull more than one mob at a time (like sweeping strikes or blade flurry).
---
It's 'hear hear,' actually!
---
Never seen that number before but if we assume it's true, it doesn't really change the point.  Average anything is always super shitty because it's always packed with masses of people who don't even care.  Generally speaking, putting in a small amount of effort, a small amount of learning, and caring about what you're doing will put you vastly above average.  I'd say that applies to leveling too.
---
Condom
---
I'm not at cap but I usually dont have problems holding threat unless someone ignores the kill order/doesn't wait for cons to tick a couple of times before opening up.
---
This is driven mostly by the populations insistence to only consider raiding and *maybe* PvP when it comes to balance though. There isn't a single spec in vanilla that has no use, it's just that not every spec has a use in a raid. 
---
Class balance in vanilla could definitely be improved (looking at you, mages), but attempting to make every spec raid-viable is a step in the wrong direction for me. And I'm a druid for crying out loud.
---
No idea why they think they can tank in beserker stance.  I can get the desire to whirlwind, a little, but even still, that doesn't mean you should stay in it the entire time.
---
I'm pretty sure the main benefit of layering is to to limit competition for quest spawns which would mean most are near the same level
---
I did both I right clicked then dragged it off out of sight out of mind type thing for me with how I have my UI set up, I just didn't realize, because I am dumb and new to the class, that there was a pet spellbook for me to collect it from later
---
That's just naturally what happens when you're one of the first to get to max level, the rest of the playerbase still has to catch up. A lot more people will be getting to 60 in the next month.
---
Say it louder for the people in the back....

Thanks I tried an add-on that puts them up on top of my screen but that's way too slow for me.  Numpad will make this way easier.  I'm using 123 for my gearsets but I still have the rest probably just gonna use 789.

Relax man, not their fault you speed leveled.

If they never released bg's would anyone gain enough honor to even rank up?

as a rogue priests are prob hardest class for me to kill tbh. I just make pally dump his bubble early and i know ill win, if i miss even one kick/gouge/ks interrupt on a priest heal ill probably lose. fear, slow and dots is a deadly combo
---
I play horde on Fairbanks (PvP).  I would be super disappointed if it was 90%+ Horde.   I join a PvP server because I love the PvP aspect.   Would be super boring if it was that heavily weighted.   Would also suck if it was 90% alliance.   It’s perfect when its 50/50 or at least close to 50/50
---
Curse of Recklessness fear yoyo; ribbed for tank's pleasure.
---
Source? How do you know that's why it was changed?
---
Maybe the area designer said "you know what, I always thought I screwed up that race start girl because fuck how much it would suck goc get literal salt stuck up your vagina from those short shorts. If I could do it again I'd give her pants because it doesn't make sense to have those pants in a salt flat"?
---
Bloody oath
---
I just want to roll a DK already :(
---
The only thing we know right now, is that there are 5 phases, (or patches), that will be added to the game. (We're in the first phase now).   Blizzard has not announced any timeline as to when they will go in.  All we have on a timeline, is best guess.
---
These phases will include additional content...dungeons and raids, primarily, but absolutely nothing that came with any of the expansions.  So, to answer your question, you will never see Blood Elves in Classic.  (keep reading, going to touch on this in another paragraph).  But one can assume that it will also include various bug fixes and improvements to mirror when they were originally patched in, way back when.
---
Now, Blood Elves.  Blood Elves went in when TBC went live.  Blizzard has said absolutely nothing about if they will patch in the expansions to Classic at some later date.  But, they did express interest in an idea on how they could do it, while still keeping Classic, Classic.
---
That idea is, Spinning up new servers that will be classic plus expansion and offer free transfers to them.  If you want Blood Elves, (TBC), you'll transfer your character to the server with TBC patched in.
---
Hope that helps.
---
We should all be so lucky to have your friends.
---
I clearly have bad customers.
---
Use the symbols to mark your PARTY.  
---
The healer will never LOS the tank (and vice versa).
---
The new guy won't get lost.
---
They will see when the tank LOS pulls or needs to stack.
---
Trust.
---
I literally just had the same thing happen to me, i was a lone ally hunter and i saw them doing that quest and looked like they needed a tank, i sacrificed my pet for the good of the quest. They both 
---
/thank me then sat there for 15m for it to respawn, targetted the objective and /point at it. I tag the boss and everyone engages and fights together. 
---
Quite the most wholesum expirience i have had between alliance and horde
---
What? Ask rubes to give you money?
---
Yeah, I know how to do that.

And this is why I call those mobs "Leonidas."

To train your pet the rest of the skills available use the ‘beast training’ ability in your spell book.

provided it doesnt do overwhelming ranged dmg, truedat
---
how much would you need to play this game to have hit 60 and done 41 UBRS runs already?
---
In terms of converting everything to attack power. 
---
In pre raid BIS, 1% crit is worth ~32 AP.
---
Dal Rends is worth 82 AP (1% crit, 50 AP)
---
1x BSH is worth 34 AP (13 AGI = 26 AP + .25% crit)
---
In BRD there's a drop called Ribsplitter than can roll with 11 agility and it always comes with +10 AP. It's either main hand or unique (can't remember), so you can only equip one. It's BoE, so keep an eye out on the AH.
---
Ribsplitter of Agility is worth 38.7 AP (11 AGI = 22 AP + .21% crit + 10 static AP)
---
BSH + Ribsplitter = 72.7 AP which is a 9.2 AP difference vs Dal Rends. They also have the benefit of not relying on a set bonus, so you can get rid of one once you get an upgrade. You also don't have to compete on these items against any other classes.
---
Additionally, if you're Alliance, then you get blessing of kings during raids:
---
Dal Rends remains at a value of 82 AP
---
BSH + Ribsplitter jumps up to 78.7 AP (that's a 3.3 ap difference on a pair of items no one else in the game wants)
---
I say this as a guy that's played his fair share of vanilla hunter--hunters rolling on Dal Rends deserve every bit of shit thrown their way if a warrior or rogue in the group needs them.
---
&gt; SPELLCLEAVE 
---
wtf is spellcleave?
---
He didn’t get the drop, and that luck is worth gold. It’s entitled to think that another player is somehow magically required to help you with quest drops.  If you don’t want to be gouged for quest items when you didn’t win them, you should quest with someone you know. 
---
It’s certainly not polite, but it’s pretty far from “absolutely disgusting behavior.” It’s how vanilla is structured, and that brutalist gameplay is part of vanilla’s appeal.
---
"Here's my opinion. Ah shit people disagree, must be drones". Gj..
---
Not an item - But apparently the death/ghost environment (all grey/white) is based off LOTR, when the developers saw the dead/ghost world they thought they needed to add it into WoW.
---
For certain you will not get any bad rep from this, even within that guys guild.   People like this annoy everyone, his guild is probably already annoyed with him for not wanting to tank.   The only person getting a bad rep is him for being a whiny twat.
---
Depends on your playstyle.  Nature's Grasp is great, but only costs a single point.  If you're not willing to spend the points to go into Balance right now it may be worth putting off and respeccing later.
---
Omen of Clarity, Natural Shapeshifter, and Furor all support rapid shifting.  If you find most of your questing done in Cat Form it's probably worth maxing Feral before going into either of those other trees.
---
If you PvP much then all the Balance talents become more useful, as well as Feral Charge and Nature's Grasp.  It's hard to stick with just one form for PvP.
---
Na, its all just mobs i pickpocketed already.
---
&gt; Addons existed in vanilla
---
Except the VAST majority of the ones people are using didn't exist back then.
---
Arcatraz. Only slightly less bullshit than Shattered Halls
---
Shadowed Unit Frames can be configured to work this way
---
1. Are Mages universally hated yet? I just got level 10 on one for the first time, but have heard plenty of stories on Reddit of Mages not being the most ideal addition to parties.
---
2. What is "Phase 2" exactly?
---
3. Does Tailoring pair nicely with any other skill? Something like LW and Skinning, or Mining and BS.
---
No? I just finished up there. Some quests were even gray for me.
---
“What are you looking for?”
---
Not really.  It's fluctuated, I also got bored the other night and leveled my enchanting skill a bit.
---
I've yet to find anything that sells for a lot on the AH as well.
---
I've also bought all my talents to this point as well, just because, so that's a chunk of gold too. 
---
I'm not worried about gold, tbh. It will come in time.
---
Faction changes would be cancer.
---
To get ww axe?
---
Did you do this with two accounts? Or on a pve server?
---
I focused mainly on doing cash reward quests.
---
Earned about 10g from the shimmering flats quests, between the vendor trash and the quest rewards themselves.
---
Got 10 or so gold from alliance badlands quests
---
And of course theres plenty of these quests in stv
---
Or it could be the self promoting,  a lot of people don't like it. Honestly this is a low effort self promote too. You have np context and are hoping those pissed at blizzard for any reason give you that click.
---
What is the name of the horde quest where you poison the little girl?
---
Amen brother
---
Real. I usually give an assignment to the cc were using and just stick with it. Yesterday sheep was triangle
---
Alt+w here. Simple, easy to remember since it's the walk key and never something I'd bind normally.
---
It's a book you can buy from a dude in the busted out fort in Arathi Highlands. People will put them on the AH for a bump in price, however.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=16084
---
There is a vendor in arathi highlands you purchase it off of. Alternatively its sold on the AH as well albiet inflated
---
It is what it is. Whenever someone throws down one single marker and says nothing, I assume it's who to kill first. Virtually everyone uses skull, but I've seen some strangers in my time.
---
So this the point where we all flex about how much gold we used to have on retail? ;)
---
And you won’t piss off any rogues and warriors
---
Because an item like that isn't in the game.
---
Nah, I've done a lot of sniping. You can set up pretty advanced filters to only ever get deals worth buying. At that point you no longer need to look at what you're buying, it's only about how fast you can buy the item. You can bind the 'buy' button on a keybind. That means all you have to do when an item pops up on the window is click on your second monitor and press your keybind. Takes half a second. No botting required.
---
In general, sure. In actuality, they mean what the MT or raid leader say they mean.
---
Who cares who got the mace lmao,all i see is blind followers of asmon who likes keeping his sheep close,just be quiet bro
---
Until after phase 6, so I'm guessing 2 years before expansions are considered. If at all. They said they would gauge what the community wants at that time.
---
Yeah it's level 30 where you're in and about to get powerful so you commit.
---
go into the elvui config window and down in "Profiles" click "Import Profile" and paste that text
---
**Man Daisy has been shorted**.. really got the short end of the stick. I hope blizzard fixes this shortly!
---
&gt;whynotboth.gif
---
Because I'm not one to knock someone else's hustle.
---
&gt;Hm, by this logic we shouln't get mad at gun companies.  People kill people, amirite?
---
Yes, you are right. Guns would not be sold if people didnt buy them. Why are you arguing against yourself?
---
&gt;Stop telling other people what they can or cannot do based on your personal opinion. 
---
Look back on my original comment. Did I say you couldn't slut-shame? All I gave was an answer for why it was happening here. Because reddit likes slut-shaming. Didnt say you couldn't do it, just that I noticed it happening.
---
&gt;I never said anything about can or can't.  I'm not dictating what she can or can't do - I never have.  I just said I think she's gross.
---
"Its a violation of human decency"
---
It's a layering issue. I see this post everyday.
---
Yeah I use 0, 1-9. 0 is clear, Skull, X, square blahblah. Takes up 8 + 1 for clear.
---
For gearset I usually use F8,9,10 to be honest. Far away so I don't screw it up haha!
---
I am honestly surprised they haven't done this in retail yet.  HMT would have been a perfect opportunity.
---
Not to mention thrown Glaives for Night Elves.....
---
True....i re-wrote that sentance 3 times.  was going to express the phases as 6 total, but 5 left to go...forgot to correct myself
---
I'm not sure where in the heck ground like that is, but I went out and [took a screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/ZBBDX0p.png) of classic Daisy.
---
You put about as much effort into that criticism as your mother did raising you
---
Animal transformation, like werewolves
---
Yeah, anyone who played vanilla and doesnt think there are loads of douches has a bad memory. Anyone who played private servers and doesnt think there are loads od douches is probably one of the douches.
---
It's still expensive to shift. The talent gets you maybe two more. If you don't have any int gear you can get 5 cat or bear shifts without the talent. Maybe 6 or 7 with talent
---
Thanks for the info, and glad I’m not the only one experiencing this. Will see if tweaking router settings helps any.
---
Agreed
---
Yup, the ridiculously long Water totem quest for the weakest totem line. At least you have ghost wolf by then. I get the feeling a different person designed each totem quest. For Air, you go talk to a guy in 1k needles and voila! Done! And the best melee buff in the game (40% run speed, 30% haste) for a freaking HOUR to boot. Just don't get ganked.
---
Isnt ravager more of a side grade wep compared to WW?
---
Blaumeux.
---
rely on the shaman players for tips about efficient keybindings :D
---
Interesting.
---
Voidwalkers are horrendous tanks.
---
Saying a person is an idiot, or a 9 year old kid, or new to the game (which is what I said) is not blaming mythic retail players.
---
Whelps are 39-43 
---
Elementals are 37-40
---
I don’t understand the point of this post, just take a break until more people reach 60?
---
You’re overreacting
---
I should update my guide now that I tried kdenlive. I prefer it over shotcut (it has its own tool for generating proxies). Both are good software, though. Im not sure how kdenlive is on windows either.
---
It would be more impressive if you were doing this as the minority faction.
---
Or like, you just discuss it with your group and come up with your own... since they're just shapes and don't really mean anything.
---
Currently these go for 20-50 gold on AH on my server. Would you say I should invest a shitload in these?
---
ppl hate more the random queue than everything. you just queue and you are in. there's no name attachment.
---
if it's just a lobby (like m+, arenas) it would be fine, even with the teleporting, as you would be able to see everyone's name before joining. but not having the teleporting makes the world more alive, so it's actually better to just be a lobby.
---
Book in dustwallow marsh https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16084/expert-first-aid-under-wraps
---
Not really, no. It's fairly even if they are equal skill wise.
---
"only" block?  With a prot spec you get to 100% block easily by ability and any block cannot crit or crush.  That is a huge damage reduction in a boss fight.
---
&gt;Are Mages universally hated yet? I just got level 10 on one for the first time, but have heard plenty of stories on Reddit of Mages not being the most ideal addition to parties.
---
Don't listen to reddit, I'm a 60 mage and see people looking for mages all the time.
---
Just yesterday I joined a UBRS group that was looking for one more mage just before fighting Drakkish and they were advertising for a while. 
---
&gt;What is "Phase 2" exactly?
---
It's the next wave of content, specifically it will include a new dungeon "Dire Maul" added in Ferelas, Honorable Kills and some other stuff.
---
&gt;Does Tailoring pair nicely with any other skill? Something like LW and Skinning, or Mining and BS.
---
Enchanting/Tailoring is the standard combination, you make clothes, then you buff them to make them better.
---
Be warned that Enchanting is expensive, it might be more practical to get Mining/Skinning/Herbalism and sell all your resources, then just buy the enchantments.
---
Why not, are you shaming labias that look like curtains at the grand opera?
---
You did it alright, trolled me hard. Had this mage this morning kept doing an "aoe pull" would run in and do AE get like 6-10 mobs in a dungeon then run out and the tank would attempt to grab them on the way back out. The tank was like wtf are you doing, but im just gonna watch this shit show. The mage was rageing on me for not healing him enuf when he was getting 2 shot by 6 mobs. Called our group laughable at the end and ripping on me, from the beginning i told him ill heal but im enhanced. Shamans dont have shield so youre gonna get hit before the heal gets off even when you start early. If 6 elites hit a mage once hes dead.
---
Meanwhile the tank is whispering me telling me im doing great and laughing while he watches this irate mage "aoe" pull and get hammered.
---
Dude was such an ass. 
---
Your post was funny, thanks for lightening me up.
---
Hit is still very good after the yellow cap. Since a lot of your damage is from white hits, you gain a lot of damage from hit.
---
Also, your crit is capped by your hit on the hit table. From gear alone, you won't get crit capped, but after using buffs, auras, and world buffs, it's quite common to be crit capped.
---
Awesome!
---
Is it gonna replace the portrait frame entirely? I wanted to keep the default one, just reduce the amount of space the dumb number overlay takes up on my health/mana bars.
---
Try switching to DX 12 and make sure you're drivers are clean installed with DDU
---
Right.  I'm asking why it isn't, when it was one of the defining features of Tauren in every appearance leading up to WoW.
---
I'd rather be a pally than a shaman, by far the single slowest leveling/killing class.  =( I envy my old paladin.
---
Yeah I definitely need it. A speed trinket will always be useful.
---
They missed the point because they thought I was wondering if anyone still played Ocarina or what modern advancement have been made to make it enjoyable again :|... Ocarina was a very small point
---
sentence*
---
I crafted mine so there is not much to say about cost there, but I would drop a good amount of gold for it (20) if you dont have decent gear. It is worth the damage to level faster and thus increasing gold per hour and thus in a way, pays for itself. I also spent 25g on the BIS underworld ring on my server. 
---
If you haven't been doing tailoring then think of it as all the money you spend as not crafting garbage at a loss and remember how much raw gold you are getting from AH sales of cloth.
---
Just wandered in here for the first time today, took me aback! Really pretty area.
---
If orc, id lean toward gatorbite and ride it as long as you can. I lucked out and had a guildie send me “Lord Alexander’s Battle Axe” - but I had picked up the mace off princess prior just in case- even tho I’m orc and axe spec- because the damage increase is too large to ignore. I’ve seen guys run WW into the 50s.. also if you can’t net gatorbite or scepter from Mara. There is the resurgence rod from mara quest which is fat damage, though lacks stats.... ALSO you could maybe try to get draketalon cleaver or whatever from ST, even though it’s a sword
---
Juggling is a huge tool used with VW and world well when fighting any large groups of mobs imo
---
I've been the leader on the opposite side of this. The simple fact is that patience is key. Do the other things that you enjoy but be available for whatever role they may need from you on raid day. 
---
I would spec for DPS and for tanking. Offer to fill either position depending on what they need and let them know you are only a whisper away. 
---
The leaders don't want to exclude people, and when someone has been patient and is dependable I would try my best to find them a spot as soon as possible. At times I would even ask core members that didn't need gear if they would sit one out so this guy could have a chance. 
---
Make yourself available and don't be pushy. It works wonders.
---
&gt; if it means the same thing as a shorter word that is a term used in literally every game with area of effect damage then why make up a new one
---
But like, people are using spellcleave. I just don't understand what the problem is. Why can't people say what they want. You know what they mean. Meaning is not being obfuscated. It just sounds like you want people to adhere to your preferences
---
The idiots will either learn or leave, it will get better in time.
---
https://youtu.be/f7Oy8hpPd_g this video made me want to do it
---
I would love if you could post those for me to steal! Those sound like such high quality of life changes to play Druid.
---
Wait since when did poly put the group into combat?
---
They are the bane of a lot of classes in 1v1/wpvp.
---
Totally logical to pick a mage for that instead of... I dunno druid.
---
Kind of unrelated but back in vanilla on the disc box was a night elf using glaives that I really wanted only to find out they weren't an actual in game item..
---
I'd rather just play the game, instead of watching someone rant and play the game.  I need to just block all streamers... Lol
---
M.j mlm mm9mnk mlm Kimberly 
---
Mum m cNLm
---
it's a 50/50. Two options: it either happens or it doesn't
---
Ok i see. What about the tank keeping all the mobs together? I thought ideally the tank would keep aggro for the monsters
---
Yeah just have to kill a bunch of troll elites but if you group up its super easy.
---
Wait, Blue square isnt marking for tank?  
---
\-Sincerely: A healer main that either has the tank mark himself with blue square or me marking him with blue square and marking myself with diamond.
---
10/10 troll, no way someone can play the game with such a horrible ui
---
So I'm not the only one that gets upset when I'm told to trap star?
---
Druid actually looks hella fun, I think I might try it out! Seems like the perfect class if you are looning to just chill in Azeroth. Right now it feels like I'm playing the game at max difficulty settings.
---
Moon=sheep. Surely we all agree on that at least.
---
Idk why nipple is sap. It requires a rogue to be spec'ed for sapping which doesn't happen often.
---
For legendaries?
---
You're aware legendaries aren't specific to classic?  You can get them in TBC and wrath and cata, too.
---
Big Respect to you man well done !!!
---
Maybe the issue you are having is unskilled warriors. It would work with any old 2h, just not as well. At a certain point it is probably better to go prot ( im guessing somewhere in the 50s) but until. I just tanked a full Mara run last night and was top dps 2h tanking. I also intend to do the same thing with Sunken temple tonight
---
Trap resisted guys sorry.
---
Its not a thing.
---
Possibly have an instance of smokeping running in the background. It may just be random peaks of latency that are being averaged out on the ingame ping meter.
---
so i would just complete a quest again?
---
How naughty
---
Good thinking. I hadn't thought of that and I'll try it out.
---
If you have the 2 sets run some tests man. Inquiring minds want to know.
---
I’ve thought about this for a bit and would love to test it myself but haven’t leveled a rogue yet.
---
Because my point is you weebs need to grow up. 
---
Has nothing to do with changes or no changes — weeb.
---
Foh
---
that’s a cool picture actually
---
i didn't speed level though.  i completed quest lines &amp; zones, only ran each dungeon once or twice while leveling because i leveled as fury and (almost all) groups don't want to take a class that is supposed to be tanking for them.  i did play a lot though, probably an average of 12 hours per day the first few weeks.
---
LMAO
---
When I tank, this is the system I use. CC your class color.
---
I’ll answer 4.  cuz the other guy didn’t. No, it does not.
---
Curious about leveling a pally? 
---
Do you have a second monitor or a tv in the same room? If you do youbare rrady to level a pally... to see if you are up for the challenge look at your wow monitor for 5 seconds then look at your netflix monitor for 20-30... do this all day and you have leveled a paladin without playing a paladin
---
Why not just mark. Im a veteran vanilla player, the original and several private servers. As tank healer and dps with almost every single class. It has been a few years but I still dont remember the priority targets in every single pull in every dungeon, and I doubt 95% or more of the playerbase does.
---
Important debuffs to be on the boss right away is the point. Shield slam is great threat.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/threat-overview-classic-wow#threat-modifier-abilities-and-values-warrior
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Kenco%27s_research_on_threat
---
Conflicing numbers, but Sunder is VERY high threat at max rank, especially when modified by defensive stance, only rivaled by Shield Slam and Revenge (which requires incoming damage being avoided or blocked)
---
weebs must have been dropped as children or something
---
"I have to save these cooldowns for a rainy day!"
---
Well most greed rolls have 5 people competing, meaning you'd expect to win only 20%
---
I think that may have been a Demon Hunter. iirc DHs were considered as a class choice during initial development.
---
&gt; I brought it up because you asked "Are there guilds of any type out there seeing 90% decay already, barring guilds falling apart from natural causes?"
---
You inferred that wPvP guilds are somehow different in terms of character decay, what I meant by "guilds of any type" is actual guilds, be they PvE, PvP, wPvP, RP, etc., i.e., not mass invite spam alt guilds that have no actual purpose, core players, leadership, etc.
---
Also - I'm offering no statistical analysis, only an anecdote from my own guild. No one can do actual statistical analysis of this, because no one but Blizzard has actual numbers.
---
But in terms of hypothesis? I don't think we're going to see a 90% dropoff in players. I think Blizzard guessed wrong. 
---
Anyway - enjoy the pendanticism. I'll continue posting anecdotes meant to inspire and encourage the people who are enjoying this amazing game.
---
They merge it all into 1 later and then disable layering entirely.  This will just mean that during peak times there will likely be a queue if you are on a popular server.
---
Resto Druid/ druid offtank are probably the most common. Druids can be competitive feral dps but it would require a lot of work farming gnomeregan for the 3 use manual crowd pummeler so I don’t think many do it unless they’re really committed to feral.
---
Yeah no problem, easily 1/3 or 1/2 of dungeons have critters in them. Plus white attacks on them always hit hard and often crit giving you tons of rage.
---
\*slaps desk\* Thank you!
---
01001011
---
Yeah exactly.
---
There were several areas left unfinished in the original game world.  Uldum, Karazan, Caverns of Time, Hyjal, Gilneas, the whole east coast of EK past badlands  and north of Dun Morogh.  Grim Batol, etc etc...
---
When people refer to Classic+ they are mostly referring to this.  Keep the level cap at 60, keep the specs and everything the same.  But add a bit of additional endgame content WITHOUT TOTALLY OBSOLETING THE OLD GAME.
---
&gt;Interacting with =/= drinking
---
I used drinking bleach as an example of misusing a product, numb-nutz. Let's use a different example. What do you think the bathwater was sold as, purpose-wise? Was it sold as a topical ointment? Essential oil? I dont think I'm alone in comparing a glass of bathwater to a glass paperweight. No intelligent person would consume or apply the bathwater, because common sense would suggest that it would be hazardous. Just like common sense would dictate that it would be hazardous to smash a glass paperweight and rub it on your skin. Misuse of a product does not make that product unethical, idiot.
---
Besides, I strongly suspect that your distaste for this is based more on a knee-jerk reaction to overt sexuality being rewarded, rather than your concern for public health.
---
But that's just my opinion.
---
I have a few sets, but it’s hard to test because you need to be fighting a 63 boss elite for the numbers to be valid.
---
Condoms, stars, nipples, I have no idea so I’ve just tapped this to my desk and if it’s wrong I’ll be pointing the group in this direction.
---
This title of this post is literally "my rant on blizzard"
---
So there are three possible outcomes
---
1. You are self promoting a video of you ranting on some aspect of the game.
---
2. You are linking to someone else's video and trying to take credit for their content. 
---
3. I missed a humor tag, and this is satire.
---
&gt;&gt;VIA 9GAG.COM
---
So anyone that dislikes the video is a blizzdrone? That's a great cop out.
---
What no I only sheep the 'nipple'. I have one job god dammit I'm gonna do it right.
---
You can't milk those
---
Priests can share with Rogues because there's no overlap in sap vs shackle. If you're asking a pet class to CC three different things, maybe clarify in chat?
---
Square for tanks in grps who are derpy and don't dance well
---
It exists in the first place because melee cleave was popularized first. When groups started using mages and other strong AoE casters people wanted to communicated that it was as fast as the popular melee cleave and so called it "spellcleave".
---
Well in my case the guy got some of his guildies to agree with him in general chat lol. Trying to make me feel shame or something. It just reinforced my choice to avoid their guild.
---
Yeah we do need more gold, you're right Im gonna start charging for healthstones and summons
---
Don't think you know what self promotion means...
---
Golden era is completely subjective and opinionated.
---
Stun lock healers first, then other clothies. Remember to keep enough energy to kick/interrupt casting. If the Mage starts AOEing everything you can hit Blade Flurry and pray they go down. Keep your finger on your Vanish button.
---
Short shorts are literally one of the most popular articles of clothing in hot regions and in summer time. Why would PC police care?
---
Buddy got a Nightblade from ZF, thinking it was gonna make him rich... It's going for like 40g\~ lol.
---
Skull - Attack this target first
---
Cross - Also attack this target ASAP
---
Square - Definitely DOT up and attack this target
---
Moon - Only DOT if it's a cute sheep, if not nuke
---
Star - Starfall on this target, if not druid, simply use highest damage spell
---
Nipple - Don't forget DOTs on this target
---
Star - MAYBE attack this too.
---
How is it abuse it they've clarified they are OK with it? The game is different than original WoW and each layer is roughly equivalent to the size of a server in the vanilla game. If you're stuck waiting for mobs, are you just expected to wait for them if there's a widely publicized and approved mechanic to not have to wait? It's one thing to constantly switch layers to never have to wait but there's a cooldown if you do it several times in succession so I just use it to avoid crashing other people's spots
---
Well as long as your server isn't heavily faction sided one way.
---
Yeah pretty much. Now if we could all just agree that VC is Deadmines were good....
---
BEGONE THOTS! YOU SHALL NOT PASS!
---
there is no zep to mulgore in classic
---
Delete this post plz
---
SM/Ruin is a much more well rounded build for all content. I'd recommend rocking it unless you are purely wanting to perform in raids. Sm/ruin still does fine in raids anyway.
---
Thanks for the replies everyone! I'm definitely dropping my warrior, probably gonna go for a druid or warlock (gonna watch some vids to help me decide). Doing the starting zone again sucks a bit but I guess itll go faster and will be worth it after the first 2hours of playtime.
---
damn son nice form switches. but did he not kick or gouge or anything at all?
---
Or they're just bored of seeing 100 random strangers every single day post a picture of their new mount.
---
We get it.  Everyone can get a mount at 40.
---
Coded it out; aoe spam incoming; thanks for the help...... as a MT-fml! (Y can’t you hold Agro)
---
Nah, tanks tend to have "Protection" in their spec title (unless druid) while healers are the gatorade and viagra that keep the most important member going.
---
Wow, that boring. What about Druid? Been mulling that over too.
---
Announcing you have a vagina in WoW is like an AOE taunt
---
It's weird to me that you're considering taking a shit to be the same as sitting on some water.
---
if you like warlock just stick to warlock, you can [solo maraudon](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/maraudon-gold-farming-classic-wow) make big $
---
I put the big orange circle on me so that the priests can see me better and still forget to heal me.
---
I think his point is that the TBC and WOTLK trajectory has a finite destination and thus a finite lifespan. I would like to see both TBC and WOTLK but the moment they release TBC we know this nostalgia kick is coming to an end sooner or later.
---
Are they the popups with a red close button? If you download Auctioneer it comes with Swatter, which surpresses those errors
---
Skull, x, square, moon, panties, diamond, condom, star
---
Oh, there's a setting that can enable that, no addon required. I forgot the exact spot, something in display or nameplates.
---
Shitty thing to do...
---
Too many ubrs runs. True strike and dalrends will be my fucking demise.
---
Fear/banish.
---
Fearing in dungeons is big dick
---
Not until the third or fourth date, after they've shown you their totem.
---
LOL they let me name a mage BIGDICKAURA on classic.
---
Don't leave him dismissed for more than a few hours while you're logged in or it will run away.
---
Skull, x, and moon are definitely correct, but the rest of the marks are dealer’s choice.
---
Eh don't worry to much. Most of us really don't care as long as you aren't causing wipes. And are more than willing to answer questions if you ask. Preferably before you cause a wipe.
---
Classic is a relatively easy game don't let the hard core players put any fear in you about mistakes just have fun and enjoy journey. Hell the guild I'm in is call the Bebbit Bullies. Do I know what a Bebbit is? Does anyone? But they're pretty chill so I stay with them.
---
The point is about where the line is.  Which is where exactly?
---
Banish?
---
Green Triangle. It’s always been green triangle.
---
Yeah the first fight just made me quit watching
---
Would it take the edge off your sorrow if I made a compilation of pictures of the original model and paired it with sound clips of hentai girls having sex and uploaded it somewhere? :)
---
I mean I get the no changes thing but there are plenty already. Being able to jump off a flight at the nearest FP for example. Some changes simply don't affect game play at all.
---
Did I just hear you correctly, you just said the best troll priest is the best class in PVP and anyone who thinks otherwise is dumb? 
---
Jesus. Christ....
---
Played since release, the symbols mean whatever you want them to mean at any given time.
---
Nah I’m not a sook
---
Why would someone willingly pay a subsciption and not have any fun is beyond me...  
---
Take the free transfer with your guild and gtfo...
---
Probably because it's one if the first places you'll meet the opposing faction outside of STV (and drive by ganks) - thus people haven't really PVPed before getting there
---
It's a joke. Sheesh.
---
Yeah rogues should be second in line for thunderfury at best. Probably third though.
---
The symbols are class colored.  Sheep square, sap star, trap triangle, banish diamond, root circle, shackle moon.
---
Circle
---
Yeah. But what you were good at as a druid was - keeping your dot up, and moving into a spot to heal that was far enough to keep away, but no so far as to lose combat (if your dot ran out).
---
Also, kill the rogue with melee attacks in travel form to really seal the deal. Then tea-bag as bear.
---
As a Shaman who can't buff to say thanks I echo this post. Random buffs have helped out a helluva lot so far.
---
Did we have markers in vanilla?  Honest question, I dont remember them until later, but my memory of those times are really shotty.
---
Skull -Kill
---
X - Kill next
---
Everything else - CC that
---
I'd keep using Herbalism/Alchemy. Potions are always needed and extremely useful for leveling since you can stack 4 1-hour buffs (maybe more, not sure; they include Regeneration, Armor, Increased Health, and Primary Stat).
---
Plus, Swiftness Potions are great for getting around here and there. You can make good use of Rage potions for your Warrior.
---
&gt;Keep in mind, I've never once said she isn't allowed to do what she's doing - which would I think be slut shaming.  
---
You fucking posted the definition of slut shaming in your first comment. Or did you forget already? Pretty sure the word was "crticize", not "forbid". Christ you're bad at this.
---
&gt;So would like, protesting on her instagram page or whatever.
---
Not much difference between saying it here vs saying it there imo. Is a protest less valid if it isnt directly in front of the main building?
---
I said I was done, but your stupidity keeps pulling me back in.
---

---
Bitch if I'm a hoe u a slut
---
Rekt n cukt
---
Other than the first few ranks of voidwalker taunt before I gave up on him, I did not buy a single pet skill other than seduction and lesser invisibility until 60. Absolutely no regrets.
---
A red dagger?
---
Multiple leveling Warlock builds I've seen go the all the way up to Dark Pact at lvl 40, but then you can diverge from there.
---
I recently respec'd into full affliction at level 30 just yesterday.   
---
Previously I had 3 points in improved voidwalker, but was still struggling to hold threat.  You may actually want to wait until lvl 40 to respec if you are adequately managing threat and not impatient like I am.
---
Destiny is for autists
---
Rouge.
---
Hmmm, not necessarily
---
Yes. Sex is bad, mmmm'kay?
---
at 37 u should go after the SWORD of omen from an SM quest, and at 39-40 u should go after vanquisher’s SWORD from an RFD quest. SWORDS
---
The icon is the same. Without a tooltip, you can't tell the difference. So, we are playing a game "Guess which is the bleach". It's called "fun"
---
Me tank you damage! You do damage me pull
---
Causes high threat on neckbeards
---
It’s sad because this isn’t even an item worth ruining your reputation over.
---
Im level 57 and have 550g, and I plan on getting my mount shoetly after hitting 60. This is after soending about 150g on the auction house.
---
Got my money farming rich thorium, mostly. Arcane crystals are selling for a shitload, and even thorium bars are selling well.
---
Speccing prot isn’t needed at all until 60 dungeons, and even then you can do without if you know what you’re doing.
---
Resist the thirst, dude.
---
Please tell me you’re joking. It’s 2019 so I really can’t tell anymore
---
I showed u my totem don't ignore me
---
Depends on how DM farm is gonna be in classic. If DM North is better than East you will want skinning for that.
---
You do onyxia attunement quest?
---
Okay but what if the whole group wants you moving faster?
---
Apparently shocking information: not every raid uses the same icons as the same indicators
---
We never expected her to go beyond level 5, today she leveled up to seven on her own.
---
My group always used the blue square on tank and purple diamond to mark the healer so they didn't get lost in the chaos.
---
I used to have addon that was a thin black’ish bar with info like gold, the amount of quests i have in my log, exp/hr, bagspace and some other info i think. Does anyone know if something like that exists?
---
LOL you really think they're going to remake all the expansions if they do BC?
---
Why wait til 45?  To keep the Crit%?
---
That makes sense at least, I worry tho since people are trying to replace AoE with Spellcleave in the general nomenclature when obviously they don't mean the same thing
---
Oh so trinkets and stuff but not procs from weapons , but what about oild like there is shadow oil which makes shadow bolts.
---
MARKING IS OVERRATED. LETS JUST BIGDICK THIS
---
Just want to comment on your last line. The whole "it will even out in the long run" still sort of implies that they will eventually go on a dry streak that will "even it out."
---
But as you said yourself, past events have NO effect on future ones.
---
That means if you flip heads 10 times in a row that if you flip the coin another 10,000 times the most likely outcome is 5,005 Heads not 5,000.
---
You're never guaranteed a dry streak or a hot streak.
---
The problem for me as a tank is most groups don't actually want to do the slow, cc way. They want to go faster. So even if I mark, they will generally just ignore it.
---
OH MAN MEMORIES I TOTALLY FORGOT ABOUT THAT DUDE
---
Seriously?
---
Oh lordy I wish more people understood this xD I was in a group this weekend that was using all the wrong icons. It was a shit show. I was fearing hunter targets, because he swapped fear and trap.
---
Six feet under still fire though 🤘👿🤘
---
If only I could get the DPS to kill the skull first..
---
S W O R D
---
Wotlk only got lfg at the very end of the expansion and if I remember correctly wasn't even used on most of the dungeons after its creation. Cata is when lfg became ubiquitous
---
 Had a mage, of course, do that the other night through a Stockades run. Literally Aoe on single targets. Another mage in the group calls him out, and he ragequit after he pulled the final boss along with the room we were in.
---
Those same exact murlocs dropped a dazzling longsword for me
---
Pretty much all of these have been used since at least bc.
---
I remember diamond also frequently being banish though. Depends on the fight.
---
You're the blessing in disguise but I'm just gonna say there are a *lot* of tanks, especially on my server, who stay in zerver stance the whole time, and I do mean, the whole time. There is no such thing as demo shout, sunder armor, thunderclap or any ability in defensive stance to them.
---
And they very often are the very same ones who go "can't hold threat with a 1h + shield and I need to top the meters lulz".
---
They never took this out of Retail. You would think it doesn't need to be explained.
---
no NOT swords, daggers. Rouge daggers. NOT SWORDS. WHY DONT U UNDERSTAND!?!?!?
---
I had a group where we farmed 5 of those damn rings for watch for the dps and tank. Sadly, one of the hunters left but we replaced him with someone else. Anyway, all 4 dropped within 7 runs after we replaced the hunter.
---
If you aren't aoe farming then you should go fire. Fire is more fun and in my opinion better for single target than frost. Opening with Pyroblast is just so mana efficient both for dpme and because you are getting mana regen ticks while casting
---
Lol all’s fair. I mostly mean dotting me while I’m doin stuff on my own like farming or whatever. 
---
Succubus is your best friend in pvp. Charm is so annoying.
---
The best aoe mage farming spots are the packs of tiny plantlings in DM:East for their vendor trash and ZG Crocodiles for the Gurubashi Tokens (though they require good gear, a partner aoe for more dps, or downing mana potions), but neither exist yet in Phase 1.
---
The Scarlet Crusade camps/ lumber mill in the plaguelands are also really good for farming, but be prepared for them to be contested and for world pvp.
---
Titanpanel
---
first time i went there  some human rogue tried ganking me in that like exact spot and I smoked him lol. Im a mage
---
Big respect... I hope he found rest
---
I always wonder if people who keep spewing this are children or legitimately have some sort of mental defect.
---
Preach man. I got bad mouthed by one of those very 'tanks' who bashed me for not being able to keep up on heals.
---
Well of course, if a mage is busy out questing I’m not gonna expect anything from them but if they’re just in town and too lazy to do it after someone asks nicely that’s just poor manners
---
Add curse of elements before you soulfire for that spicy fire resistance reduction. Muy caliente
---
Hmm ok so with how much people were u doing it and were u all doing everything together or did u split?
---
CANT...UN..HEEAAARRRR
---
Titan panel
---
“Hunter BiS is also my best in slot so THEYRE the cancer.”
---
Any holy damage you deal will be effected by spell power. So consecration, Holy Shock, and SoR which are your main skills for damage as a holy pally or shockadin are all effected.
---
I reserved my name before the game even came out because my RL buddies picked it. Sue me
---
Horde vendor Jangdor Swiftstrider in feralas also sells this pattern. The problem is the same with the ally vendor. He sells multiple patters but only one at a time and they respawn every 30 minutes so you can go hours without even seeing it.
---
Not sure where you are going with this?
---
“George the Jerk”
---
Solid commitment to that RP.
---
I bought 3 personally, equipped 1 and am sitting on 2.
---
Lash is her melee ability, does about double the damage of an auto attack, but because of the amount of mana it uses, its not that good. You are using Succubus as a battery through Dark Pact and if she has less mana, that means youre getting less use out of dark pact. Its about minimizing downtime and being optimal, pretty much why you dont use curse of agony on most mobs.
---
If you think that's alot at level 48 and would ninja it for such a paltry amount, you're a garbage player. You could farm that much in grey loot in under 5-10 minutes.
---
I leveled to 20 without a gathering profession. What profession can I level the fastest so that I am not level 50 without a mount
---
If you choose to do that i guess
---
now that's a hot detail, gracias
---
Don't tell me what to do! I'll raid my way!
---
It's when your definition of fun is running the same dungeon 30 times in a row.
---
This is what happens when you envelope yourself in nothing but one thing for a month. It's unhealthy. Try to keep your chins up
---
More than usual actually! On long flightpaths or if I /follow a friend I will do pushups/situps.
---
Question regarding PvP, do I need to tell my succ to seduce using a macro or will she do it herself?
---
Yeah, you can't make a "Daisy" reference and not have the hot pants. They're called "Daisy Dukes" after all!
---
Should i be bying weapons from ah? Leveled my warrior to lvl 16 today with a level 5 axe(from ah), couldnt bear it any longer, went and bought another one for level 13. Its crazy how few items there are.
---
Which unit frames are you using?
---
Yeah the instant mines going off wiped my group like 4 times the other night. Def bugged
---
Sure I could change pet. But I like my current one.
---
Same thing applies to rogue poisons!
---
yeah, he was actually promoted after he said that lmao
---
BoE is one thing because you can resell it to the community. Needing on a BoP that you can't use is dumb unless the group laid out loot rules beforehand, which they obviously did not. I guess no one else actually needed it for an upgrade in which case it should have been greeded so everyone had a fair shot since it's just gold. That's a ninja. A minor one and kind of dumb since he got 1 whole gold out of it.
---
Not when you only started entering raids with late Cata. I never even capped during Wrath, since I couldn't really decide what to play as. The highest I had gotten was my hunter to 71 before the Cata pre-patch hit. I was also stuck in Ashenvale for over a month when I started. And Outland took me 2 months.
---
Well, I capped in early 2011 when the Cata heroics still required some half decent coordination and rogues, hunters and mages always existed en masse, so it was easy to learn which symbol belongs to which CC.
---
Something else about the economy that I haven't seen other mention is the vast reduction in resources/gold when layering is removed. Whether people are intentionally exploiting or just playing normal right now, there are multiple layers happening at once each with their own nodes (herb/mining) and mobs. 
---
When layers are removed (Blizz has said phase 2) the amount of overall resources possible to be gathered/farmed will greatly reduce. No real numbers have been officially stated by Blizz AFAIK.
---
What level should I be as a warrior to tank SM arm/cath? Also when I watch high level warriors play they click whirlwind but I dont see them spin. I'm guessing the damage still goes off but I'd like to know how it works mechanically. Thanks.
---
Er no, it screams "without layering it'll be a much bigger shit show on launch month"
---
I'm guessing the breaking point is probably one of the SM wings. Maybe some of Uld.
---
Does armor worn out by the times you get hit or just by how long I've been wearing it?
---
Probably someone who wants the dungeon for a different reason than the reserved loot would be happy to go. Imagine someone who already had the reserved piece or an upgrade to it and doesnt need the reserved piece but wants some other item. Hopefully, now you understand
---
I put the star on my tank when I’m healing to help keep track of them especially when it’s late when I’m a bit drowsy

You can set custom keybindings for assigning the various marks to your current target which is how I've always done it, I've also tried to figure out how to do this through macros and I don't think its possible.
---
Ever hear of *Google*
---
Seriously how is this not people's first thought about any question ever?
---
Why not just fuck right off?
---
But is that healthy? No.
---
watched him before, exactly my type of streamer. Thanks for reminding!
---
&gt;Then I remembered I constantly pvped and got a ton of xp from it.
---
You remembered wrong.
---
Respect to you.
---
Huge amount of love for a friend, that is amazing by your actions
---
pets do run away if their loyalty reaches 0
---
Yep sometimes, idk about this rogue, if he’s good or bad, either way i can see what he did and didn’t do in the video that i can comment. 
---
My point is that even if rogues has really great dps, the advantage they have is using cc’s and stealth wisely in pvp situations. If not that, rogues are pretty much dead because other classes has some great stuffs too that can easily leads to kite a rogue.
---
Cool thanks.
---
&gt;the tank can easily see if they're present for pulling.
---
That is completely unnecessary, if four dots appear next to you on the minimap, pull.
---
If in doubt, you'll at some point in the first five seconds of the dungeon notice the healer's race and clothes.
---
The only thing I (as both healer, tank, and DPS... I play druid :p) have ever gotten out of marking players is what feels like half my view obstructed by those annoying god damn things. 
---
I absolutely get it in raids, it's useful there. The rooms you're fighting in are also incidentally at least five times larger than most dungeons and the marks don't hide 20% of the action each.   
---
You can't see details that will so a dot screaming "here's the person you need to know where is" is useful.
---
I have a real hatred for marking players in dungeons.  It shows, doesn't it?
---
That's what they all said.....haha
---
Ya, but a crap ton of these guys I've seen them "tanking" starting from level 31(I've seen a lvl 30) in SM. With the Whirlwind Axe.
---
The amount of guys in 1h+shield are vanishingly rare. I was actually surprised last night when I saw the first warrior in ages, using 1h+shield in ZF. The run was among the smoothest, second only to a level 60 druid tank(well of course that BETTER be smooth).
---
Everyone else, does what I call "just the usual". Charges into the pack, switches to zerker stance, whirlwinds and dps'es everything down.
---
You could just go dps for now? You need many tanks for several bosses,its nice to have preraid tanks.
---
It is going to be a shit-show of amazing proportions.
---
If the population / popularity doesn't die down, I expect ranking post rank 10 to be monumentally harder than it was in vanilla.
---
Thankfully, for myself, I've set a max goal of rank 11. I hit 10 on 2 different characters in Vanilla, and would love to hit 11 for the pvp mount this time around. I have zero delusions of being able to hit 12 and above.

Blizzard needs to enforce stricter, child resistant standards on their packaging
---
Can the scourge affect orcs, trolls, and tauren? Or does it only affect humans? Why do the other horde races not have a problem with creating biological weapons?
---
Star, circle, diamond, and triangle are sometimes marked on players as a marker to “stack on this player.”
---
Moonfire is good enough. Does damage and still accomplishes the "can't stealth" issue. This druid was also good about keeping moonfire DoT on them.
---
Shouldnt really be drinking as a warlock. Lifetap to near death or when mana is full, then decide to either bandage or eat. Drinking is for mages.. or those few times when you almost die and are near zero mana/hp, then yeah eat/drink lol
---
What's that chat add-on? Looks slick!
---
I got that part lol, but ty
---
I agree with you. It really seems worth it and 20g wouldn't be too bad.
---
The Underworld Band is pretty good. Doesn't have as much spellpower than that BRD quest ring and maidens circle aswell as no +int for crit, but those +10 stam are really good so it evens it out a bit. With 25g you made quite a good deal. I keep an eye out for that one aswell.
---
Yup I didn’t think about it much at launch, I was just eager to play. Now I get to starts at a bald male human rogue with sideburn patches and a soul patch.
---
swing and a miss
---
This is a troll post right? Seems obvious, but it seems weeb enough to be true
---
&gt;*It's not being self-important to expect that people play the game correctly.*
---
Comprehend the entire context of my original response and you can more accurately understand the reasoning for it. 
---
&gt; ***What are these idiot healers demanding that you find so offensive?*** 
---
Him being a healer has nothing to do with having reasonable expectations people conduct themselves accordingly, or perform their role accordingly. Self-important is believing there's a higher standard for you because you're a healer...which he did. 
---
Idiots like the OP are not beautiful snowflakes and can easily be replaced. Based on his behavior after his "dispute" with his group members reflected he is every bit as toxic as he alleges they were, which, calls into question that perhaps he was the source of the actual issue - not the DPS.
---
People with shitty attitudes of any roles are replaceable so long as you maintain being a good person/player. Luckily, with Vanilla or Classic and pre-LFG tool, if you were sociable, polite and played solidly you were able to build a nice collection of friends of all roles to play with. The rules don't apply to the OP or anyone else any differently. That's the point. Go back and read again if you're confused. This entire post is ridiculous and your failure to understand that is too.
---
This is one sad troll look at his username..
---
Im not sure if I'm fan of Dark Pact at 60,
---
At rank 3, it returns 250 mana each GCD.  
---
Which means it takes like 10 globals to get full mana.
---
The second one, on the right? With the daisy dukes? Isn't that the 1.12 version?
---
Skinning just run around murdering or skinning stuff other people kill
---
As a tank I mark the healer and as a healer I mark the tank. It makes it easier to spot them from a distance.
---
What the fuck am I looking at
---
Check out the leveling weapons section of this guide, ideally you should save as much money as you can so you can buy your mount once you hit level 40.  
---
All of the best weapons that you will want to use while leveling will come from dungeons and quest rewards.
---
&gt;later everyone else on the battlegroup with xserver bgs
---
I don't think that's true.
---
I'm fairly certain ranks were still determined by comparison against folks in your *server*, even after cross-realm BGs became a thing. 
---
I might be wrong. I don't think I am though.
---
Learning how to play within the latency is like 90% of PvP.
---
How do I even us these target icons?

One thing about the neutral AHs, they take a larger cut. it's worth it for those items that are faction specific to sell to the other faction. But you would notice it and really feel the difference if you used it as your primary AH.

It's 2004 you mongoloid.  Crying is the new masturbating, we all wear diapers, and every female is actually a 35 y/o catholic priest cathfishing for young boys.  Get with the times.  2019 doesn't exist the Mayans say we'll be long dead before then.

Just got my Sword of Omen.  Dinged 37 today.  Goin for the RFD sword this weekend.
---
In most cases I would agree with you, but not with these 2. One started running as a way to deal with ADHD, and loves the concentration required to move his body. The other is a world-class endurance athlete, and he certainly doesn't have body issues.
---
Neither is completely sane in the normal sense of the word, and I've seen how badly they react to being forced to sit still for a day.
---
If you stopped to wait for mana you're a trash tank. end of story
---
It just stops stealth. In this case, there was little reason to use it since the moonfire DoT was accomplishing the same thing. If the druid had been mostly feral (didn't appear to be), or if they had been accompanied by a melee DPS, then Faerie Fire would have been the best option.  
---
But, since it was an elemental druid, Moonfire is just as good.
---
Copper ore is nowhere near that price on my server
---
So true
---
He's finna jerk it
---
Something, something, objectifying women.
---
This is true lol
---
Yes it didn't literally remove the ability to world pvp but nobody did it anymore.  Sure if people saw each other on the road the might duke it out but nobody went out into the world looking to farm honor.  Nobody made raids and killed flight masters anymore.  Everyone just sat in town.
---
I wish people would stop repeating this ridiculous lie that flying killed world pvp.  TBC had lots of world pvp, much more than the end of vanilla.  We had constant fighting in Nagrand at Halaa and the elemental plateau.  It doesn't matter if you can fly if the things you need are on the ground.  Is killing someone until they fly away much different than killing someone until they hearth or log out?
---
Players are always going to the easiest thing that gives the best reward.  Once BGs exist that thing is doing nothing but sitting in town and queuing, especially since BGs will not be server locked on release like in vanilla so the cross server queues will be near instant.
---
Players who min-max strive to play 100% perfect and efficient, no matter what.
---
For instance, if the orc female model would have a 0.04 faster swing timer, they would choose to play that race and gender.
---
I know its not. but to me at least your name is NYAH
---
No u are the wee we face and love layering reeee :)
---
Still can't understand what that has to do with implementing TBC specifically instead of Classic+
---
Same except the few times there was an undead that should be CC'd and a priest that could do it, the people I played with used circle. For me, it made sense because I saw the shackle as being like a ring around the CC'd undead.
---
While I agree, it can be hard to find proper WPVP since you get dishonor for killing people outside your level range, so you have to find similar high levels to fight.
---
I wouldn't go as far as calling them worthless. You have to take into account that layering also allows more people to play on the same server, increasing the demand for certain items substantially, not just the supply is increased.
---
Did you go to Ohio state?
---
Yeah, worth it for sure. That price seems reasonable. I'm sure you own kids with fear and dots now.

If you're the tank: if you can't see the healer, they can't heal you.
---
Yes you are right. I don’t know a lot of stuff and i do a lot of mistakes myself. I hope he could learn about his mistakes and do better next time. I really love to see a good rogue ganking and succeed. It’s really great.

where can i download this UI?

You should have been running melee cleave, and the mages shouldn't have been running with a tank. Far more efficient to play 1 shaman 3 melee or 1 warlock 3 mage
---
Yeah like I said my memory isnt the greatest from those times. I just rewatched my guilds first Huhuran kill (the only video I ever took), there were definitely markers up on the MT.
---
Maybe I should have put in a /s or something
---
I made a macro for quick marking in dungeons and whatnot. Instead of the target bindings, it's now mouseover macros. Can only hold three icons, but [here you go](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d50ukk/extremely_helpful_hunter_macro/f0jvoww/).

&gt; Why on Azeroth did they basically put a taunt on Mind Blast. SHEG234H32 ERFSEGY23!?!!?!
---
For priest tanking, ofc.
---
This makes seeing the Target's cast bar for interrupts harder when you are targeting a tank
---
Yeah. It's the 2nd trinket slot that's the problem. Every caster/healer will roll on Briarwood Reed or one in BRD so if you're unlucky getting a 2nd trinket will take forever.
---
Not an item but human /silly sometimes tells you about a journey akin to LOTR.

Sorry that's exactly what I meant. Should have been a little more clear
---
If they had all hole-in-ones they wouldn't have the opportunity to play again because every golfer in a 100 mile radius would receive the bat signal that the god of golf has arrived and swarm them.
---
Right. You are not guaranteed streaks but they tend to happen as the numbers will average towards the expected value. Seeing TTTTTT then 10^(15) flips later seeing HHHHHH helps the median average stay at the expected value, but the TTTTTT did not have influence to make the HHHHHH happen...that is what I meant my "even out".
---
There’s so many fans with awful fan fiction head canon stuff. OP even mentioned OSRS where recently they turned down Warding because it was poorly fleshed out fan fic that didn’t fit in the game, yet over half the community was pissed it didn’t pass.
---
Idk why people think that fan involvement in development is always a good thing. It’s honestly only good for curbing the worst ideas of the developer.
---
Hot pants better come phase 2

Wow head player census. Google that it should be 11-12 days old. Bliz just patched out the ability to harvest player numbers on our side.

Might be undead, would still Drink with you🥳
---
Sounds like a bad tank to me. Though this is what happens in higher level instances if you take reddits (IE: retail players)  tanking advice.
---
This reads like Boomer erotic roleplay
---
Depends what you're leveling as too tbh. 
---
Most people level deep feral, and basically as soon as you get FFF you can just sit in bear and probably never lose to a rogue of similar power as long as you refresh it frequently (you have more than enough GCDs to do this lol).
---
I could have.
---
If you’re actually having trouble with runners that isn’t fixed by telling your group to target low mobs, kidney can stop them. I don’t think I’ve ever wished I had crippling on either weapon in pve content on my grind to 60 or currently at 60.
---
Yeah thats a good way to look at it. The "layering helps shitter lowbies" isn't really true since some players haven't even cracked 25 yet. The only people benefitting from extra valuable resources are the ones who are exploiting layers and creating cross faction alliances and dumb shit like that.
---
"I'm in the same position I was before, but now it's your fault"
---
If you have a hearth/TP close to the instance, then it's fine.
---
If you're questing/farming in Silithis, your hearthstone is down and you wait until the 5th person joins the Strath group before you head there, you're probably a dick.
---
When I first started playing WoW I thought about this video and rolled horde. I was a huge cannibal corpse fan in high school but didn’t start playing WoW until last year.
---
Diamond could also be banish what I know.
---
That is fantastic!
---
So many rogues out there like this giving us a bad name, the way you cast entangling roots for about 4 whole cast resets and he didn’t kick made me throw my phone.
---
Yeah but let’s be honest 
---
I can’t even get groups in retail for mythic plus dungeons when I’m overgeared I don’t wanna experience that again in a game like classic where the 40 man raids can be done by 10-20 mediocre geared casuals 
---
Id light my keyboard on Fire or sth
---
Items durability wears out over time whenever you are in combat, in addition, casting spells at enemies or hitting them with your weapon can cause it to lose durability, and every hit you take can cause your armor to lose durability.  
---
Dying and using the Spirit Healer to resurrect causes huge amounts of durability damage to all the items you have equipped.
---
Because that would be smart and Bliz has a history of being a shit company since MOP.
---
alliance camping terren mill as we speak
---
Pet DPS is normalized, so pve is largely irrelevant. Its pvp and his 1.0 attack speed causing casters to get major pushback on spells
---
Absolutely agree. Pulling aggro once or twice while getting a feel for things doesn't make one a tard. A tard is the guy who doesnt change his behaviour and constantly pulls aggro.
---
Don't u also attack faster following a parry?
---
Yep but UNLIMITED AMMO!

There's 5 expansions between WotLK (where DKs were introduced) and retail, and a vastly different play experience between them.

She was written in as a very well known Easter egg referring to Daisy in Dukes of Hazard, for which the original shorts were named. 
---
Her entire presence is a confirmation that she should be wearing daisy dukes, and the original artist /blizzard made those intentions known by making her that specific Easter egg. They didn't "screw up that race start girl".

Depends on how far... if they are in the same zone and relatively close (within 2 minutes time) I don't see much of a problem with it.  If you are waiting on a 4th or a 5th player that is far away (especially if you don't know them) it can get costly for you in time to go wait by the instance.
---
I have a full time job and only get 3-4 hours top on given night and if I have to spend 10-15 minutes of it waiting on someone I am not going to do it.  Now of course there is a trade off which is why I think you should quest or grind within a few minutes of the instance - anything further and than YOU have become the person wasting everyone's time.
---
There are too many players that don't have that respect for others and it has worn down my patience to go stand at an instance.   I have had people in my groups that will accept an invite and even with all four of us by the instance already they'll say "Oh - I just have to turn this quest in, sell a few items and empty my bags real quick" and then you don't see them for 15-20 minutes.
---
Work doesn't really interfere with gaming, it's friends and family. I got no kids or wife and I' m saving money so I only see my friends once a week. I get home, do any groceries, meal prep, exercise, appointments etc and I still have 5 hours each night to play and get to bed at a reasonable time.
---
I told my BF I took two days off for his birthday but I really took two days off so I could spend one of those days staying up all night playing WoW.

I definitely used a mod called Silencer back in Cata for this purpose. I don't know whether it has been updated for Classic.

Looks like I can only transfer to a handful of pvp realms right now for free. I've put too much time into this priest to give up, so I'm going to try and persevere for now

Idk what class you play. But I am sure  when some idiot takes your BiS  as a temporary upgrade youll be upset too.
---
Only for the first few raids, after that you can go back to fire
---
The correct thing to do for princesses ring is to farm it as a group. Instead, people risky the roll, lose and then have to do the run another 20+ times before they ever get it.

It’s not the pixels themselves that people care about. It’s the idea/reason behind the change and what it means for the future. As in, if they’re censoring these ideas now, what is next?
---
Double check that tooltip. You need 125 mining in order to learn it and you're at 75. Goto a lower tier trainer sort by "available" and uncheck "unavailable"
---
1. Mages are useful AF because of poly + water + AoE Damage. You will die in instances until you get iceblock.
---
2. Phase 2 is the next "patch" that brings some additions. Read more from Blizz.
---
3. No. Since cloth comes from mobs primarily, there is no gathering prof. You can pick up enchanting though, they go together well. (Or another gathering prof).
---
4. Not as far as I know.
---
Sometimes the tank says to leave Growl on and the healer actually heals my pet!

Skin and *VENDORING* the leather. Low level leather doesn't sell for basically anything. Thick is headed that way quickly, and rugged as well shortly behind.

Were cat attack speeds normalized or is Broken Tooth actually caster-nullifyingly fast?

&gt;Just like you could have not commented on the original post?

Lol you must be daft. Do I need to go over all this again with you? You got mad at me for responding to you the way I did when you got all defensive from the jump! Your tenuous grasp on logic is the only incredible thing about you.
---
&gt;Funny, because despite still acting cocky in these posts I featured you in, you still haven't responded to our thread in which I indisputable show you straight up misread my original comment.
---
11 days ago. You never responded to me. You realize anyone can just look at the post right? Just because you say something doesn't make it true. Or maybe you need to read a guide on how reddit works... Ancient history now anyway. You seem to be the lone dissenter on the thread. I'll let my upvotes speak for themselves.
---
No where has that been said at all.

You can't get any of those in mid 20s.  Corpsemaker is like 29 I think.

That was posted by Blizz Brazil and apparently by mistake. IIRC it was taken down pretty fast. Wouldn't be surprised if someone lost their job over it. 
---
It's likely a true thing that's happening but not for a minute. I'd be surprised if this wasn't confirmed before the end of Blizzcon.
---
If you mean the quest log, the addon “Classic Quest Log for Classic” is perfect. 
---
If you mean the on-screen tracker, Questie has a tracker with some good features and Modern Quest Watch is also a solid option.
---
it really isn't that bad even with your explanation.
---
You mean 3 AM?
---
What level are you exactly?
---
That's a big boi :)
---
Are you forced to 10 man this? just curious.
---
What classes are you struggling against? I’m playing a feral druid so I have a bit more in my toolkit like roots and ranged dots, but similar idea.
---
You just dont know what the community wants cuz ur a retail scrub. It saddens me, u shouldnt be allowed an opinion... your similar to that j allen brack guy. Delusional and wrong
---
I'm not sure about this, wasn't it just because it was pretty damn amazing as a rogue level 49 twink
---
That sounds like a colossal waste of time. I just make sure I'm not the last person by keeping an eye on the locations of others. Sometimes there's a LOT of time between group formation and competition.
---
Just communicate with the group. Why stand idle for an hour? What if the group doesn't even pan out? I respect the time of others, but that doesn't mean I completely disregard my own.
---
You're playing a female tauren?
---
And my axe!
---
I peed and farded and shidded and camed.
---
It won't but hope is good to have.
---
I’m just saying you don’t need a dedicated tank to run these leveling dungeons. I don’t get why people are downvoting this fact...does it offend people?
---
Shamans are meant to be able to be off-tanks. This isn't something you can compare to a survival hunter at all in pve.
---
Yeah, that rogue was pretty ass. Kicking the roots is all it would have taken.
---
Its just a UI
---
Nothing against the rules as far as I know, you're paying for a second subscription and can freely create new characters on any faction.
---
I think they might get upset if you create alts to shit talk to other faction members, but that's probably about it.
---
Fear works really well at higher levels as you can cast Curse of Recklessness on a target to cancel the fear if it runs the wrong direction.
---
44, why?
---
Pretty much.
---
I'd pick up all the quests in a zone, look for a mob that died easily and dropped a lot of grey items, and then started killing them.
---
If I had a quest that was easy to complete while doing this, I did it.
---
I then moved to other zones and tried the same thing.  I'd just drop quests that had me going out of my way or when I moved zones.
---
I searched almost every zone.  Now I'm bringing up a hunter, for max farming.
---
Nobody minds spellcleave as long as the group composition is setup for it. Then have at it, we all love it when conditions are at least trying to be ideal.
---
Spellcleave makes no sense when you have a single mage(specced in fire), one warlock and all the rest are a smattering of different classes. But group try to do it anyways and the results are mixed, and in many cases worse off then if you just did the dungeon the regular way.
---
Similarly with melee cleave. Does the group makeup support it? If so, more power to you. But far too many people are watching the big fancy streamers do it, but fail to recognize that the group composition is setup as such for a reason, all the players are on discord actively communicating, and all of them are playing at a pretty good level together. It's co-ordinated, something that more often than not is not the case in a typical PUG.
---
Nah your character sounds like a beef cake

So shall we change all the Easter eggs so they make no sense?

---
Personally, Im laughing at the amount of people who rolled mages because a streamer or video said to, instead of just picking a class they wanted.  Now there is an abundance of mages, and theyre gonna find out, it takes a while to gear just one person in T1, doing that for 10 mages in a raid group is even worse.

As long as you jump you’re good.
---
Some people can be emotional, others are afraid to even show it. Don’t be the latter - it does no good for anyone.
---
&gt; It’s not a requirement that the tank pull and hold aggro on each and every single mob

It is if you want them to tank... no aggro means no getting hit which means no rage which means no aggro.

Star is shackle, sheep is moon, square is trap.
---
Druid can't change the form of the mob.
---
That’s a good point. Hopefully it’s a passing thing. I would have for all of the end game to be like this.
---
Most of your complaints relate to learning the class. It's going to be a learning curve no matter what you play. You will probably mess up the rogue combo a couple of times before you get consistent with it. The other thing is you'll have to remember is a lot of classes don't pick up until late 20's to mid 30's.  
---
Warrior will be great for pvp but you will probably have issues with frost mages which are plentiful. That fits the archetype you want, but doesn't avoid your pet peeve. Paladin  will require a lot of abilities to use but are not (I think) directly countered by anyone because they have so many tools. Rogues fill in this game of having more versatile survivability, but don't have armor. You won't help people directly, but there's enough cc to direct a fight so you can "support" in that sense.  
---
It sounds like you should play rogue, and maybe a paladin, but you have to remember it's going to be slow until you get some abilities and talents.
---
+1 to this. A warrior alchemist is kind of like a rogue. Rage potions, swiftness potions, invisibility potions. Especially since most herbs pre goldthorn are worth barely more than Vendor.

Ferocious Bite costs 35 energy which is what clearcasting will pay for. Part of ferocious bite's effect is that it will burn up whatever energy you have left to deal additional damage.

Everything else aside, we're starting to get posts from 60 warriors who were expecting to MT raids and complaining they can't find a spot so the game is dead.
---
Like, there are people that didn't read up what vanilla was like to know that there would be a glut of tanks at 60, since raids are 1:40 for MTs rather than 1:5.  They didn't realize that 99% of the effort of raiding is getting bodies consistently in to the raid group...they just figured they'd be in huge demand for all group pve content always.
---
Albeit, DPS warriors are beastly, there's definitely a place for loads of warriors in a raid.  Just not in prot spec with tank gear.

Rogue vs druid heavily favors rogue if the Druid gets opened on in caster form. Every other scenario favors druid, but OP should have lost if the rogue had opened with cheap shot and wasn't garbage.

---
The most you would get at anything but Nostalrius was like what, 5000 players on a faction? That was rare. Those people are dedicated players, more so than the typical classic players, I think. Like WDavis said, private servers usually reset or were shut down by the time Phase 3 would be initiated. *Plenty* of players will remain if nothing changes in Classic, sure, but I just know that my friends and I wouldn't just keep fucking doing Onyxia for the 300th time for $15 a month, and I think a majority of players would agree. The voting criteria should be changes that don't dramatically change the game, or fuck with the spirit of WoW classic. You know, like barber shops. 
---
Do you want to see more content eventually for classic, personally? Old school Runescape did some cool shit like that, they essentially made entirely new, classic content, which shifted the game into something entirely its own.
---
So you're telling me that's not a shield to show who is tank?
---
Riiiiiight.
---
Two inches on shorts is not at all equivalent to changing the color of shirt, let alone for a character named after the color of his shirt. You're right, this *is* insanity, OP. Seek help, I'm worried about you.
---
I’m fine, do my posts really come off that angry? I think you’re misinterpreting my tone.
---
It's not a bug. Ferocious bite converts energy above the base cost into extra damage. The base cost consumes your clearcasting. The "additional energy" is still used.
---
Up to Rend is pretty darn easy, post-Rend is a lot tougher.  If you have an absolutely ace group with really good gear you could possibly clear the whole thing, but some mechanics (assassin gouge, Drak's conflag) are really tough to handle with only a single tank.
---
Yes, multiple times. And Im running the newest drivers 19.9.2. 
---
Just had a session go almost an hour and then BAM another BSOD.
---
Meanwhile, as someone who hates tanking in classic, I get a run a week for this exact reason. "Sorry bro, tank doesn't another warrior to roll against"
---
Yeah hes at 1.0 attack speed. Absolute monster

I am always behind the curve so I'm use to that.
---
I'm at work, so I can't check.  But I think chrome has an always on top option.  Or maybe its an extension?  There is a way to make a chrome window always be on top.  
---
You can then shrink that down a bit and put it wherever you want to look at.  It would always be on top though.  
---
But that isn't so bad if you just drag the window out of the way, largely off the edge of your screen.  It would be like a new UI feature, then drag it over back on top to look at it.  Not ideal, no.  But it's a quick and dirty solution without alt tabbing. 
---
If your mouse is able, you could make a mouse macro to do it for you.  Hit a button, mouse moves over, clicks down, drags back to a specified point, lets go.  then another to click specified point, move over to edge, let go.
---
&gt; Then what?
---
Either nothing, some idea they come up with by the time we're to that point or continue with Cataclysm...maybe with some changes to it to eliminate the biggest flaws people hated from it? We'll see...maybe nothing will happen at all, but if classic stays successful, they'll probably just take the "safe bets" for not and got with the 2 most successful expansions of WoW for the next couple of years.
---
too many, and not enough!
---
Well Na I absolutely did quests. I’m rolling pally on the verge of giving up its so damn boring tbh. Lol and not to mention slow as shit. I can’t grind it would be worse.
---
you really think being in a party of 2 vs 4 will make you less likely to be ganked?

There is no way I could give up Cold Snap and Ice Block. They are way too powerful.

Well would you look at that! Ha! Neat
---
Dude was casting 5 yards away from you lol what a joke.
---
Is exists required?  Can you mouseover something that doesn’t exist?
---
Glad I'm not the only one to think that
---
Don’t be worried.  I think you must be too young to know what the dukes of hazard is.
---
Gratz on your axe.
---
Incorrect, Pallys also have to do Dire Maul.
---
MANAgement
---
Hand of Gul'dan is a spell that cleaves. Of course that spell does not exist in classic however.
---
Yo chill dont upvote or repost cuz theyll fuckin nerf it
---
Not reallyindicative of anything, could be the natural rise and fall of game. Too many factors to boil it down to X or Y expansion caused subs to leave.
---
Which classic/vanilla blizz server are closest to AQ opening? And ETA? Never seen it with my own eyes.
---
Too offensive for modern audiences 
---
10% ass showings is a no go now
---
Hey man! Thank you for taking my question so serious, and taking the time to leave a reply!
---
You’re more than right on having to learn a class. Hits the nail right on the head.
---
Does a rogue have a lot of situational combo’s? And how would you compare a rogue to let’s say a druid?
---
Interesting, didn't think of using Twitch. Ill check it out, hopefully no one actually logs on to watch lol
---
Did this with my flasks of oil thinking it was water
---
With 200g invested I can make alot more then 50g in 3 weeks. Hell I made 24g on the AH with a 5g investment recently!
---
FYI, Thunderclap is Battle stance only. Not trying to detract from your point because it's a good one.
---
Conc, Sanc, HS, Shield spike, Ret aura while using SoW will get you 30k/hour at 54 here, if there's little competition. Don't know why people are complaining when you can do something similar and actually chain pull when mages do this and drink and have to wait for respawns.
---
If you don’t have resources to do what you need to do, that’s just bad play on your part. You don’t have to spend your energy to 0. You can sit on points. It takes 10 seconds to cap an energy bar from 0, that’s a ton of room for error in timing and preparation. You know which mobs will run. You can see how your group is playing to adjust during the dungeon accordingly. Don’t expect other people to play well, carry them. 
---
Yes, you have two weapons, so you can run double instant for(almost) double damage. You don’t have to run two separate poisons. 
---
You certainly have the right to play the game how you want, but telling someone else that running crippling in pve content is a good option because you don’t want to plan out how to spend your resources ahead of time and would rather smorc that sinister strike key to 0 energy is just misinformation. 
---
I’ve used crippling in pve once while leveling, and it was to kite around shy rotam in winterspring because I was under leveled and undermanned.
---
Oh, I'm stupid then.
---
Probably savory deviate delight

Savory deviate delight

I'm more impressed that a horde wanted to fight you one on one at an even level
---
There's a main hand fish weap with actual damage stats if I remember correctly
---
At least I'm old enough to not depend on video game characters for sexual pleasure.
---
The problem with wand is it's a hard target. So mouseover can't work.
---
I've also tried with hunter auto shot and it can't work.
---
I got to admit, I've used Square as "CC this, I don't care WHO you are" for like...forever. And it has seemed like that has ALWAYS been the case since marking became a thing/got popular. Sometimes, very seldom, is it used to highlight the tank, then you just use whatever else mark for polymorph/cc that isn't skull or cross.
---
If you mark an undead with the star its obviously a shackle, if its a demon its banish, and if its a human sap since they cant be used on the other, and are all normalized CC
---
Stonescale Eel are usually good along with Nightfin Soup, not OP though :)
---
&gt;  I do all the work in there
---
Interesting standpoint. Tell that to your dps and see how long it takes you to actually kill any given pull.
---
Also shatter works with fire spells so that is very strong when your fire crits do 40% extra damage in tick damage.
---
Whoever smelt it dealt it
---
Damn, even at level cap?
---
Sap the nipple!
---
I've had an opposite problem where I swing my gun instead of my WW axe
---
Thanks! Damage it does is insane!
---
Someone setup a discord for our realm while character name reservation was being done, and they advertise it pretty heavily. It's been really nice.
---
AoE can include warrior/hunter. "Spell" clearly does not.
---
spread dps out evenly among all targets?
---
I am just curious why whenever there are comparison photos, they don't have the same lighting or view. Like, why is one from the backside and one from the front?
---
Hello fellow function keybinder for target icons! There are dozens of us!!!
---
Hello! I believe this was added in 1.11 so it should work, however I haven't tested it as i'm at work. You're looking for the SetRaidTarget script function
---
An example of this in a macro would be /script SetRaidTarget(target,8) to set a skull on your current target.
---
You can find more details about the options for markers at [https://wow.gamepedia.com/Target\_marker](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Target_marker)
---
Gate of Babylon.  
---
And Unlimited Blades Work.
---
they watched some video guide based on private server data where the vw does twice the damage he does in classic and doesn't lose threat.
---
ie. f'ng sheep. those of us who played the class in vanilla know that the vw is ditched the minute you have 5/5 in the talent to reduce pushback on drain life and he is only used when dealing with some tough mobs like the booty bay pirates that like to swarm and do far more damage than typical of mobs their level so you can have that shield handy.
---
Going on 56. I dropped the ball when the going went tough in 40s range, same as I did in '05 (talking about falling back into old patterns).
---
Ignore Prot unless you do a dungeon- then swing by and train. I didn’t upgrade my Heroic Strike, Mocking Blow, Cleave. 
---
Only skills I really care about ATM is Overpower, Rend, Demo and Battle Shout.
---
The rest are unimportant in my experience.
---
You sound awfully dumb
---
When tanking as paladin with Righteous Fury up, does the holy damage from Retribution Aura count towards threat generation?
---
Wouldn't mind a warrior eventually but when I played retail (just legion) I really enjoyed healing and kinda wanna keep that up for now.
---
No overlap as is in there isn't a single pull in the game that contains both a humanoid and an undead mob?
---
[Apparently Soda got hammered](https://twitter.com/Sodapoppintv/status/1176708101375967234)
---
The only reason I've ignored anyone is because of too many responses, especially when I say LF1M Any DPS.. sometimes it's just easier to take the first person who said invite and go, rather than tell everyone who whispered me we are full. I always try to let everyone know were full but damn sometimes I just wanna go quickly and get the dungeon over with. Not the best excuse but that's why I've done it.
---
They choose to put energy where they want, as do you
---
What's up zapp b.  I'm on blameux as well.  Maeby the 46 cow druid.  Are you ally or horde?
---
download zygors if you're having trouble finding quests
---
Ty sir! Now we just need to make it mandatory for all the BfA babies to sub to this reddit and read.
---
Gross you filth!
---
No problem! Hope you were still able to!
---
Well, if it was, it wouldn't be orange.
---
That in turn undercut the previous one by 1c and so on . :p
---
it annoys me that other than skull and cross, the other icons for CC can be interpreted as class colored and yet no one does so.
---
But like, some people don't like the term spellcleave. I just don't understand what the problem is? Why can't people say what they don't like? You know what they mean. Disliking is not being obfuscated. It just sound like you want people to accept your preferences no matter what. 
---
It's just as stupid sounding and vapid in either direction... huh who would have guessed?
---
You’st’ve’d’nt
---
Gratz. Now just need to find some help with mine. 😭
---
Not normalized. My buddy (alliance) traveled into Tauren lands to get The Rake. It absolutely shreds.
---
Mine works fine:
---
/cast [@mouseover,harm][]shoot
---
Agree here. Yellow star is sap fo sure.
---
I don’t use it for my mouseover heals, but I don’t have any offensive mouseovers.
---
God I can't wait until phase two. It'll be fun seeing those people try to play without a nearly gamebreaking inter-dimensional teleport.
---
When they are the same level for hours or days I really don't think so.
---
Who’s cutting onions
---
Lol. People trying to make a standard will fail. 
---
Skull is kill. Everything else is up to the leader and changes. We usually kill skull and cc whatever random other symbol is used.
---
I do love me some A.S.S.F.A.G.G.O.T.S
---
Lmao knew someone would say that. Literally every class could use the ring at that level but if you are taking it away from a caster you are a nonce
---
That pull doesnt require a ranged weapon, you can safely charge however you need to clear the corridor to the left first. You can get close enough to range pull and los without getting the 3 op was going for.
---
Unfortunately that's still the "forbidden zone" of discussion (at least I assume anyway). But there are options if you catch my drift.
---
That being said I do miss my blood DK as well, especially the WoD era where multistrike was still a thing and you could top all three meters just by spamming Breath of Sindragosa and death strike. It was still a fairly complex system of DK play but also fairly streamlined, the perfect mix of easy to learn and hard to master.
---
I think in Tanaris 250 is good enough so you have 100% catch chance on everything
---
I'm confused.. you claimed OP ignored someone in your first comment? That doesnt make sense.
---
I like this!
---
Makes me want to play in a PvP world but I’m ew to WoW :(
---
There's better options for warriors anyways. A couple different guides I've read say dal rend is only good for fury war if you have both.
---
I can do Tinkerer and princess in 8 minutes as a shadowpriest. With Rotgrip its around 12-15. If you do 8 minute runs you will be locked out anyways after about 5 times. You're better off just doing them in order. Still impressive though.
---
Yeah but Life Before Death is important too and druids just keep on dying.
---
Since the people who are willing to tank once again realized they have the ability to make everyone cater to their demands, no matter how absurd.
---
I’ve been afflication since start with just 10 points in Demonology to help boost my VW, and haven’t had issues and am currently 55.
---
kargoz was running off incorrect pserver data, and those points in destruction are a waste you don't have the crit to make them worth a damn. better to keep going in demo to buff your own stamina, the succubus mana pool, instant resummons, etc.
---
Warlock here.. So I just keep spamming fear on  the skull because he looked at me and send the money into other Pat's...... Right???
---
Seconded.
---
I see your wyvern sting and raise you a repentance
---
Well dont i have the bank alt for you! All sorts of useless nonsense from rogue pickpocketing
---
Level an alt on another or the same server. Give it some time for everyone to get to 60 then come back to your warrior and try to find PUGs until you find a guild you want to join IMO.
---
I did this to douches before i got bored of playing my warlock. Dunno what it was about playing them but man i was not having fun. Almost quit classic cause of it. Im enjoying Hunter but im thinking of rerolling again as a mage.
---
It's Dash not sprint and unless you're an NE Hunter you really don't need Prowl.  I currently have The Rake (2nd best PvP pet with 1.2 attack speed)  I use him for PvE with Growl, Bite and Dash.  For PvP you really only need Claw and Dash.
---
AoE attacking pets are fine but could cause you trouble in a dungeon if you're not in a specific AoE group.  If you are turn on Screech, if not, use Claw.  As for where to put your points, Stam plus Armor then when you hit MC, max out Fire Resist.
---
Check ah for prices on executioners cleaver. Things an absolute beast for lvl 44 and it's an axe. If it's too pricey wait for gator bite axe then the BlackRock slicer from lbrs.

---
Ahhh chills.
---
IDK if youtube has the same guidelines but twitch bans people who break in-game ToS even though it's not illegal. So just because it's not illegal doesn't mean youtube "has no reason to take it down" or that they can't.
---
I imagine if someone as big and popular as Blizzard started complaining they would do something.
---
They're very broad calculations. I did note that the absolute best performance for critical wasn't up to spellpower - and that critical only becomes worse the more you have.
---
I also only addressed a single spell because normally people optimize their single target rather than multi-target rotations.
---
&gt; I just don't understand what the problem is? Why can't people say what they don't like?
---
lol, they are arguing people *shouldn't* use spellcleave. I don't have a problem with either. I think the only vapid thing in this discussion is what you just wrote.
---
Death is always funny.  I'm joking btw but as a tank spending the entire group fighting to get aggro (back) is annoying as fuck.  If you want to aoe at least let me roar or hit the enemies at least once.
---
Oh man ofc !! Maybe orc racial??
---
I look back in the list to see who didn't undercut by 1c; that's the one I buy.
---
I will save those I can, and accept I can't save everyone
---
Its a pretty flawed system, its based off what people are listing it for, not what its actually selling for
---
Tank or DPS the Scarlet Leggings are much better
---
I had a warrior salty at me for multi-pulling shit when trying to level, they be mad as hell
---
Please send tell
---
You could turn in your BG tokens for XP. I was a pretty decent rank by the time I even hit 60.
---
Anger Management is a dungeon must-have, in more ways than one!
---
I was just questing in STV, and i thought the same thing when i got Troll Sweat as a drop
---
7 damage away from true power.
---
Yeah this is stupid and in no way universally accepted. Let me know where in game I can find a pack of 8 mobs with 1 undead, 1 beast, 6 humanoids and zero elementals (cuz we felt the need for 2 kills markers and 0 banish markers) cuz that’s the only time this would be of any use.  
---
Ppl usually just kill skull and CC whatever other marker  or 2 you call out. Whether you use a blue shield or an orange circle makes no difference...what does having a designated marker for each ability accomplish? And how tf does this get 10k upvotes?
---
This game seems complicated 🤔
---
Mages who try to AoE farm are always easy pickings ;)
---
Yes, around 10-15 % more damage depending on if you have aged core leather gloves from me (+5 to dagger skill)
---
Ah. Thanks for clarifying.
---
Can't say for other classes, but icyvein list for healing priest wasnt that great until couple days ago. It looks like their guides are literaly copy paste info that is found on internet, and a lot was outdated.
---
Gbtr
---
Yep classic redditor, innovation and depth driven creativity should be hotfixed.
---
Stfu snitch this is badass
---
post-cata still has tons of places to explore, the outside world is just a little less broken  /r/hiddenwow
---
THANK YOU. I don't know why people are so interested in aoe'ing and doing the same shit all the way to 60
---
What are you druid keybinds? I can't really see from video, but it might just be because mobile.
---
I just use gank for any abrupt fight where at least one party was unprovoked before the fight.
---
This is the solution but I think bots are what people are going to trend towards to compensate all that that time.
---
That rogue was trash
---
Murlocs. They have some weird aggro system where if you aggro one and move it away from the rest, the rest of the coast aggros you anyways. Or if someone else is fighting a/multiple murlocs and they just drop all threat on that player and swarm some poor soul a few meters away killing a lone murloc. Like wtf kind of behavior is that?
---
Same, usually it's only one or two steps deep
---
Yes faction changes would only make the problem worse. It's not so bad in a state like retail where PvP is BG focused. But when populations are imbalanced in a *world PvP* game, servers get unplayable. If a server is slightly horde dominated and they open up faction transfers then a lot of alliance will switch over and it will just become unplayable for those who didn't.
---
I guess it's because they specially want magic AOE, not melee. Easier to say spellcleave rather than AOE and have a bunch of warriors and shaman asking to join.
---
Been leveling with my IRL friends, one of them playing mage and he has a ranged interrupt ability.  
---
Not sure what it called or when you get it, but you do get it.
---
wrong
---
Mage
---
You didn't play on Kil'Jaeden in vanilla did you? I recall this exact same thing happen to a rogue back in the day.
---
For people who are all about their opinions being their own they sure do love jumping on here and posting about it endlessly.
---
If your favored way to play is to be in your little bubble and be a dickling to other people then I pity you.
---
These people think they are the best and everyone else sucks. "Oh I'm a dps and I over aggro the tank. He must be bad." "Omg the healer is not healing me even when I'm basically playing tank cuz the tank is bad. He must suck too."
---
had to save for my mount at 40! i did get it as soon as i dinged but i got a gold left now lol
---
Yeah, Rank 1 Blizz, it has yet to fail me.
---
Adibags is your friend then.  It removes the normal bag interface and replaces it with a new one.  It has default filters and you can make more of your own.  Ex it lumps all trade stuff together.  But I want my fishing, tailoring and enchanting separated.  So I filtered them into their own groups.  Those things always show in their own group now and cooking and random stuff I found is left in tradeskills.
---
I swear up and down by this addon.  Love it to death.
---
I do wanna say, I havent built the filters in classic.  I did it on retail.  The author ported it to classic and Ive just been using the default.  This is due to my own laziness.  
---
If you turn the addon off and look at your bags, shits all over the place and impossible to find.  But with the addon on its nice.
---
You can skip leveling like 70% of warrior abilities. Only thing I can think of that’s worth leveling is execute, battle shout, mortal strike, whirlwind and charge. Rend starts to become useless after rank 3 and you don’t even get mortal strike until 40 and whirlwind till 34.
---
No, always mage or rogue from vanilla to cata. Just wanted to have a new experience so switched to horde and trying a warrior.
---
Ummm the tauren shamans in WCIII used nothing but an off hand latern (the Spiritwalkers). Now you can argue why cant Taur wars use something like that, but dont mix in shamans into that mess.
---
Now if youre arguing from the cinematic aspect, it wouldnt be a far stretch to assume that it wasnt a standard warrior, but a faction leader (Cairne).
---

Not sure if “harm” is required but I would like to be educated, as I haven’t delved deep into macros outside of stance dance and weapon swap macros just yet
---
I'm not sure that's true since it's tied to the release of dire maul
---
I don't understand people who roll on PVP servers and don't PVP.
---
Pagle
---
That place is a pain in the ass
---
Rogues are welcomed just about everywhere unless you're *god awful* at the class. But that also means there's an overabundance of them even at higher levels since it's a fairly easy leveling process, if a little slower.
---
Warriors are looking like they're on the decline past level 35 or so. At that point its *much* easier to level as DPS and then just spec to tanking once you ding 60, but most people burn out on it because it requires grinding out elite quests and dungeons for the most optimal weapons, or they just stick to prot and take ages to level.
---
Most people who were there for the launch are hitting 60 now and starting to organize for the end game. Of course it depends on server but theres probably gonna be a small demand for warriors until guilds and raid groups solidify and players start looking towards rolling alts to fill the need (or just swapping mains). If you already have a group or guild in mind and they need a warrior it won't hurt to roll one to be prepared. Even just having one at 60 as an alt is enough to open doors for group content later on, as the playerbase starts to level out and the "rush" of the launch period dies down.
---
That's such bullshit.  
---
Had some shitty mage in the group trying to get something like that going.  
---
The next runs after he left were a billion times better.
---
Basically, you just need one mage to know WTF they're doing.  Just  nova to allow the tank to back out safely once they're gathered.  Then the same mage can nova at the end to stop runners.
---
This makes me miss playing wow so much.
---
Two level 30s and I were attacked by a ?? Night elf outside of yeti cave, we hamstrung and destroyed him and his 30 pally friend. Pretty sure he couldn’t handle reality after that and he was there for 5-6 straight hours just stealthed killing horde after a yeti slay (so they’d be weak and one-shot range).
---
Pathetic.
---
If the healer isn't prioritizing to heal the warlock he sucks at his job /s
---
I just got my warrior to 60. I followed guides originally, but they didn't work great for me as they recommended Arms. I struggled a lot on rage generation when throwing on a shield and trying to tank. Struggled all the way until around 40 when I decided i'd respec to fury. If I did it over again I would put talents in Arms tree to start.
---
5 in Deflection, 5 in Tactical Mastery, 1 in Anger Management
---
Then would start on the Fury tree. I ended up finding Fury a lot more satisfying to use and way easier to generate rage while tanking dungeons.
---
Warrior talent trees are a slap in the face to every other melee in the game, including Rogue.
---
Nipple is also for Seduction
---
Sorry do you think this is a screenshot?
---
Thanks for this Information

You should have killed this filthy horde
---
thanks for the confidence boost stop by the stream for more bebe

thank you sir!

Thanks. I'm thinking of doing two handers but still want those improved shouts and thing to help hold aggro.

Sharing bathwater with masses of people isn't healthy.  If you're doing some anal beads in your bath for the webcam and then sell that water.....  Poop water is not great for your health.  So the health implications are certainly there for sharing used bathwater with masses of imbeciles.
---
It won't really change overtime, mages are smooth sailing all the way through naxx.
---
sorta hard to play at all if youre constantly being camped by several of the opposing faction 20 - 30 levels higher than you...
---
Fuck those god damn zf plate fucking shoulders. Give me my wolf helm, i shouldn't even be running this trash its all gray
---
Answered my question perfectly. Thanks!
---
It's not required.  You will just get an error message telling you the target is friendly.
---
My holy paladin is doomed to wear skirts and dresses from 16-60 I think.
---
Honestly, because you bring the player and the class, not just the spec.
---
If you take away pvp potential, the only talents that actually matter are the 1-pointers at the x1 tiers. And about a third of those are actually shit anyway.
---
Hell with Shadiw Trance you even get the bonus dps fron instant shadow bolts, wanding is for quick totem picking when your pet is busy and mana regen.
---
The first step to getting over the fact that feral dps is bottom tier is getting over your denial. It's ok, those of us that actually played vanilla got over it way back when. No need to get your panties in a bunch over something that already happened. 
---
Also you are talking about parses for the top 1% of players in phase 1 specifically. Wait until the masses start raiding and more content is released.
---
What are the specs of your monitor?
---
In my experience, imp pets seem to fade away most of the time if you are fighting the warlock npc solo. Unfortunately, those imps are the least worrisome anyway since they are so squishy. Having to deal with VW or Succ after killing NPC lock sucks.
---
Time to start "overcutting" by 1c!!!
---
Yes pls
---
&gt; bad server rep
---
lol, no
---
Chuck Norris, Chappelle show it's been a shit show from the start just people remember it differently.  There is a reason Barrens chat is remembered.
---
Warlocks are cool because even if you win you still die, lol. But most of the time I'll open on them and just get death coiled into a 30 minute fear, and then end up dying a million miles away to dots. So I think I might have to avoid locks until the pvp trinket comes out..
---
Warriors are tough because of overpower. I've read guides that say to hit them with bleeds and crippling poison, and then just kite them in their deadzone until you can restealth and repeat. Is this the only realistic way to beat a warrior?
---
I'm alliance so fortunately I don't have to worry about paladins. :)
---
Hunters have a pretty extensive kit, most of which I'm unfamiliar with, so I tend to struggle against them. I am a gnome, so at least my escape artist racial comes in handy. Is there anything you can do if a hunter opens on you? Serpent sting prevents me from resetting, and I can never seem to get close enough to them to blind..
---
Thanks for all the feedback!
---
Game’s been out a month, and WoW’s already dying y’all.

Time to pack it up and go play Borderlands 3 I guess. 🙄

ive literally tanked everything with 2h arms. sweeping + Whirlwind is perfect for aggro. you will have rage for days and can spam cleave as well. know those annoying strat and school pulls? yeah I just grab everything, sweeping + Whirlwind and Mages can AOE freely. even UBRS im 2h.
---
you just gotta watchout for specific mobs/segments. im not tanking baron with 2h (balzannar easy as fuck with 2h tho), or the dude that has the healing curse in scholo, or 2nd part of UBRS
---
but for 90% of all the dungeons you will have a better time as 2h, it's also more fun and engaging to me. its not even hard-core, it's just how the game is.

Skull = Kill first.

X = Kill second.     
---
Moon = CC usually Poly.    
---
Square = CC usually trap.

Diamond/Triangle = Additional CC and will be explained if ever needed.     
---
Nipple and Star = Placed on own Tank and Healer
---
&gt; Also when I watch high level warriors play they click whirlwind but I dont see them spin.
---
Are you sure it's WW and not proc from Ravager?
---
This is much more accurate:
---
Skull - kill first
---
Cross - kill second
---
everything else - read chat to find out
---
Is there really this much crap DPS running around in the game? Because I am not having this experience that much.

Not gonna lie, if my method catches on and this becomes a new meta, that would be glorious.  Just like those Amazon bots that got caught in an infinite loop and tried to sell textbooks for hundreds of thousands of dollars.

And strikers isn’t that good for hunters. It’s super fast and they get a much better bow from their quest which has a 50% drop rate on majordomo. Strikers is almost clearly designed as a melee stat stick.
---
I'm more interested in how you zoomed out so far
---
Sweet I can claim all that unoccupied territory!
---
Any update? I think I'm watching a stream right now using it.
---
Yeah for leveling druid I'm full feral so I'd do Ret/Enh for pally/shaman. More just interested in how they play for late game dungeons/raids. Leaning shaman since I have buddies with a horde guild on fairbanks but they apparently have a bunch of healers already.
---
More love for DD here. Except Hillsbrad. Fuck everyone in Hillsbrad.
---
Realistically there is one meme spec for every Warrior / Mage / Priest out there. Bringing a few along isn’t going to gimp a 40 man that much..
---
People need to remember 40 man raiding was tuned around 25 competent players in 2004, ignore the facts all you want but even the Ret Pallies and Enh Shamans are pulling more DPS then the Huntards of 04’ playing on a Laptop at 10FPS..
---
What you mean?
---
Why are you being so dense about this lol.
---
The Chestnut is a mare, not a stallion ya goof
---
You know they don't generate threat worth a damn, right?  Locks are tanking while the VW smacks away.
---
Nope it does not, it just gets wasted. If you are a druid, go bananas with your HS fake casts.
---
Why resist? She's hot
---
I guess. Fear is the devil Ricky Bobby. Specially with mobs nearby.
---
this crap was absolutely abhorrent in guild wars

Excellent name tho
---
I'll admit, I didn't provide any real evidence of my opinion. But you can't say I'm "factually incorrect" and then proceed to spout off your own opinions...
---
Forgive me but I don’t understand what your point is. Most mobs don’t have unique aggro radiuses. So someone 4 levels under is gonna pull from X distance in SM, same as RFK. So as a tank I’m aware of both mine and yours. And I’m clearing based on the lowest level, not mine....

I dont understand people who think that the only correct way to play on a pvp server is take any and every opportunity to kill someone, no matter the situation.

Yes, I've done both. Str - &gt; Agi is only for bear tanks

You don't need Spirit as you are the only class that can drink mid fight. Stack agl and int for the bigger Mana pool.

Hello /u/insipidgoose and /u/lucadiel, here is the answer to your question below :-)
---
Each Titan Panel item has their own folder in your addon folder.
---
As an example an item which already aligns to the right: TitanClassicClock.
---
Each folder has a .lua file in them and every item you want to adjust, needs to be edited.
---
Example Plugin: **TitanClassicLocation**
---
Folder: **TitanClassicLocation**
---
File: **TitanClassicLocation.lua**
---
Under "`controlVariables = {`" you will find a list of items. Add:
---
`DisplayOnRightSide = true`
---
Under "`savedVariables = {`" you will find a list of items. Add:
---
`DisplayOnRightSide = 1`
---
You need to make this identical change for each plugin which you want to align to the right. This also added the check mark to align or disalign the item to the right in the configurations panel from Titan Panel.
---
Let me know if any questions :-)
---

Can I run Classic on my Asus Chromebook somehow?
---
I think that's fair criticism to what I said, but I would argue that meta being what it is now where druids are last choice for raid spots as healers (and while you would lose the utility in Brez, aren't necessary over 1-2 in raids for the buff) is a supporting fact. In terms of the argument about pvp paladins ability to break any cc with an additional 12s immunity as well as ability to remove all debuffs aside from curses and give blessing of freedom/protection puts them pretty far ahead in terms of healing. Obviously like I said it's situational and there are nuances where another class may be preferred (ie priest/shamans with offensive dispel/purge etc) but in general paladin is going to take the cake.
---
I don't get it 😅
---
Most warriors will not take rogue bc they need the same gear.
---
TIL you can keybind these...I’ve been doing this as a tank...manually...since BC...
---
I really need to hotkey those, does anyone have a good macro for them?
---
Believe it's 1.5 levels worth. I think I read it caps after 8 or 10 days assuming you're in an inn/capital
---
Im pretty sure he is talking about trash, since he mentions nuke target and multiple mobs.
---
It was sent away
---
This would be awesome.  I think a lot of PvP-minded players would be happy to be outnumbered in world PvP and have instant BG queues.  I know I would be.
---
My play group is on horde, but we came really close to going alliance because all of us wanted to be the outnumbered underdogs in world PvP.  Horde won out for unrelated reasons, but given the option to transfer, we might take it (although, my server is balanced and alliance are kicking ass in PvP anyway).
---
All those golden stars and I never knew
---
I think at lvl 20 they get counterspell
---
No blame Diablo
---
Well not with that attitude.
---
I’ve been having trouble with the keybindings. Could you help me out with what you wrote to do such a thing?
---
I am trying to level up my tailoring is it worth it to go back and farm wool or should I just bite the bullet and pay 1.5 gold per 20 stack in the AH? Drops seemed way less often then I remembered when I was in my 20s. Does wool drop less once you're a higher level even if mobs are 20-30?
---
BDE type memes =/= Chuck Norris.
---
Chuck Norris, Jack Handy, etc are cheesy jokes, while Chappelle was obnoxious, 'Greatest Page in the Universe' or w/e was edgy, etc.  Different meme categories.
---
damn, I glanced at your profile and everything you say is negative and also your votes are negative. i don't think you come off as angry - just a negative jerk.
---
i always say to stick to what you're good at. if you're a happy person who enjoys being an asshole and is good at it, you do you.
---
So unless I'm mistaken, mobs only chain pull when they are the same type. Humanoids mobs wont chain pull beast mobs, beast mobs wont chain pull elemental mobs.  This wasnt the case in SM where everything is under the SC faction.
---
end game, Yes i agree, leveling absolutley not.
---
its pre bis for non orcs.
---
I can maybe understand it if you're on your third or fourth alt as it is technically the fastest xp if done right, but like damn it's a game you're playing to have fun.
---
Id be way more sympathetic if they sent a nice mail saying they made a mistake and asking for it back, possibly with a small reward for being a good person. No chance if they just sent that.
---
RUN AWAY LITTLE GIRL, RUN AWAY!
---
I don't get into a lot of Transmog on live, but I could swear there are some cool  low-level pants and chest pieces I just don't remember ever seeing on live. Am I just imagining that? 
---
Hmm... now that I really think about it... Maybe it's because I typically roll characters that wear leather and mail. Whereas in classic... well, if you can benefit from it in some way while leveling, you wear it (even if it is cloth).
---
Bollocks it was a joke. She knew what she was doing.
---
epicc meymeyss &lt;3
---
&gt; Explain that attacking the opposing faction on sight constantly will result in there soon being nobody to fight.
---
Oh please, if this is the crux of your argument let's just move on. Firstly, there's hardly a singular reason people leave servers. Blaming it solely on players griefing is by far the most absurd way to avoid confronting the fact there's an intrinsic flaw with the game design. 
---
Ultimately we signed up for server imbalance problems. It was a problem historically and with #nochanges being the driving philosophy behind classic, why would we expect the problem to be any different now when ultimately the game is the same as it used to be in this way? To say that we can change history by simply acting differently is just tilting at windmills.
---
yuuuppp xD
---
By that logic my mage is a hybrid because I auto attack with a wand. Or my warlock because I can auto attack with a dagger.
---
Sure. Some people want to do a 20 minute MC. Some people think of MC as the end-game content and simply being in it and taking it slow is the point and enjoyable.
---
My turn to link you something.

Oh yeah, that's right. It doesnt work in classic, it hardly worked in p servers. Take your stupid bullshit somewhere else.

Why wouldn’t grouping up improve one’s chances in PvP?

---
I think it started as a 3v3 arena variant of group that was 3 big bursty dps classes.
---
The circle is just a condom thank you
---
apparently its not because everyone plays in a perfect group where they always have the combo points or energy to stun something thats running away or has competent group members who can also do it. they also never need to kite mobs when playing solo
---
I love being told "hunter trap this guy" as if I have a say in the matter. It traps whoever the hell runs into it (if the tank even drags them into it). Unless I run into the guy, feign death, trap and have all the threat on me it doesn't work like that. And sure I could try to do it midpull with feign but they all stack up so it's a crapshoot who actually gets frozen. And when there's dots on everyone it last for .5 seconds. Rant over
---
Look at OP's username. It's the same as their in game name which is the same as their twitch.
---
I feel like there’s potential for a /r/MemeEconomy post here.
---
The game has been out for like a month and you took a break after 2 weeks.  That's not the level of dedication I'd want in a guild leader.
---
Attack speed are not but damage is  so if they are twice as fast they do half the damage each hit

---
Why wouldn't you be using curse of agony on most mobs?
---
But...what do we do now?
---
except you dont use it as your primary source of damage. thats like the saying a rogue is a healer cause he can bandage.......  
---
Hunter, Shaman, and Paladin are hybrid classes.
---
Yup, always fight back. A mage 4 higher than my *holy* priest tried to gank me while I was fishing. They tried again after running back to their corpse. 
---
I got some good money from those sagefish.

I have a Naga so I use 1-12 sift 1-12 and alt 1-12. Makes playing wow much easier imo

So kill skull, then X, then yolo and break out the other 6 CCed mobs. That way you still give the tanks and healers PTSD.
---
Leeeeeeeeeeeroooooooooooy jeenkiiinsssss
---
Now we can finally play the game. . .
---
&gt;  Even worse, is players that just hear about AOE groups and think thats how they should be playing. Its just known as a popular strategy thats leading to a meta of players terribly exectuing a half assed version.
---
Yep. It's been a shitshow for a two weeks now.
---
For every good run, theres been three or four bad ones.
---
Join melee cleave and destroy everything after windfury is down.

Your history screams how annoying you are
---
Im wondering the same, i had one drop for me and the sell price sucks because so many people are trying to sell them. Like 30g right now.
---
I put the moon icon on myself when I'm the tank cuz I think it looks nice :)
---
Literally duel everyone you can find. I mean this seriously. The only way to truly conquer individual matchups is to be prepared for what comes next. Knowing the enemy’s next move is absolute key to close the gap when it comes to counter classes. Knowing when to stun, what to kick, when to vanish, knowing how to pool energy and vanish between dot ticks, people make it seem like an easy task but rogue takes a lot of fucking work. I’d also recommend playing with and against other rogues. If it weren’t for two of the best vanilla rogues being on my server way back when I would probably still be dogshit.
---
Condom the tank for safety.
---
Oh nice
---
I  named a character GrannyGumJob and made a nasty looking orc with long gray hair to look like a granny....ya my name got flagged and now i just have an ugly long grey haired orc now and i cant change him :'(

Just a low drop rate, not bugged
---
I have a 2yo daughter.
---
Thank you for this.
---
Oh that makes sense. I was super hardcore during ICC and got a top 100 kill on LK25H. When I came back to WoW a couple months ago, I found out that that whole instance is burned into my brain. I remember the entire Lich King RP by heart... 10 years later.
---
I just had a bit of fun PvP and wanted to share. What was the point of your message again?
---
I stopped because of the guild collapsing, I wanted to play hardcore and my friends and other people in the guild didn’t so they all left, after that I switched servers to play with my old retail guild and more drama happened and that collapsed. The game didn’t make me take a break the drama did
---
To add to that the popular combos had a name for specific class combos.   It was easier to use the label rather than saying "rogue, mage, priest"
---
Now there's just 4 ways to describe instance comps.  Spell cleave, melee cleave, and cleave are the popular ones, which can really all just be defined as AOE run.  
---
Then there's the fourth option "quest run", which refers to a normal group running an instance whether for quests or not.
---
I think he just got caught flat footed and probably isnt experienced enough to recover, if hes combat he shouoda been able to pop sprint and break out the snares and at least whack this druid a couple of times. maybe it wasnt up tho
---
Nice. I’m a mage and this is my modus operandi.
---
Unsolicited advice: do your best to find some balance.
---
If you let it consume you again, you will be tipping the scales too far in one direction. You're more than that. Do something on the opposite end of the spectrum to help find a middle ground.
---
Best of luck, I'm doing the same.
---
bruh, you can't just hit me with feels when im at the peak of my high and in a post climax state
---
i mean you had all the time in the world to play on tbc pservers lol, it's not gonna be any diff playing it on live
---
Which icon indicates the warrior DPS should charge in, pop all cool down, pull aggro, and face plant into a dirt nap? Because I apparently keep making that in all my groups.
---
I don't play Mage, but I recently transferred off my realm (Pagle) because it was so insanely crowded. A month after release on a weekday morning and quest areas were still completely overfarmed. Players literally just standing around waiting for mobs to spawn so they could tag them immediately. It was awful.

You started playing wow when you were 8. Holy smokes.

---
I get ads for guns and it’s illegal to shoot people.
---
When I get home.
---
Damn what server are you on? It's going for like 30s a stack on mine!
---
Some problems.
---
The immediate one is keeping an extra set of weapons that are relevant. Rage generation is, iirc, at least in part based off your actual damage dealt, and so having a dual wield set that isn't properly up-to-date could easily mean that your two weapons actually generate less rage than your 2-hander. Also, the extra time and effort required to keep them rolling is a consideration.
---
After that, you have to consider kill times. This might work on some bosses, but on any other fight, it'll be slower, do less damage, and on solo pulls, cause you to take more damage than just sticking with one or the other. And that's not considering bosses that will have mechanics to hurt your ability to stay in melee, like Herod's whirlwind.
---
Next big thing, Slam is merely *okay* for dps. You really want to be using Whirlwind and Mortal Strike/Bloodthirst, because they don't reset your swing timer. A Slam cast does, which means your next auto and therefore your next rage gain is delayed by the cast time on Slam, and while it's good for essentially turning your swing timer into a 1.5s cast, an auto plus a whirlwind is doing only slightly less damage than two slams and uses less rage overall. Also, because Slam is a cast, any damage you take will cause pushback, delaying your next auto attack by even more.
---
But even if you find a rotation that lets you do something else besides Slam spam, it's still not advisable, just because swapping weapons *also* resets your swing timer. I keep bringing up the swing timer thing because of just how much damage your auto attacks do for you. White damage is *huge*, and even more so while leveling and without the rage to support special attack spam. Dual Wielding puts you at something like a 30%+ chance for each auto to not hit, between base miss chance and mob defenses. Overall, it wouldn't surprise me if it was the case that 2h generates more rage over time than dual wielding will during dungeons and leveling.
---
You can run to Princess without killing anything, I've watched Staysafe do it many times.
---
For your own sanity. Stay with bows if you can - unless it’s BIS

I would consider the element of surprise a pretty huge advantage.
---
I was farming saytrs for felcoth yesterday and a warlock started farming at the same spot. He started chain banishing the mobs I was fighting to mess with my farming. Since he was same faction I couldn't kill him so you better believe he got an ignore from me.
---
dishonorable kills are only received from killing certain enemy npcs, not players outside your level range - those just don't give any honor.

I don't buy from the peeps undercutting to that degree out of spite! Enjoy the extra money I suppose, auction friends.
---
The worst part about WoW is that even with reasonable time management you can still end up in these multi-hour dungeon commitments. Other games I can just put down to stand up and watch something funny on the gf’s laptop or phone and just take a short break. 
---
Classic is just too demanding on me. I tried it, hit 60 yesterday, but I’m done. It’s not healthy.
---
You're right it doesn't really matter but at a time where companies including Blizzard frequently seem to be censoring content and receiving criticism for doing so it would show good will to fix this whenever they do a polish patch that includes minor fixes. Reassuring people that it's not something they intentionally left.  
---
Especially when in the future we might get Classic+ where I know a lot of people would hope they don't forget that **[this](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/wowpedia/thumb/4/4a/3D-Night_Elf.jpg/300px-3D-Night_Elf.jpg?version=9aa595fa42dddafeacf433fbe031a478)** is how the game used to be advertised.

Is it  Site just based off user  Submission?

What if my iq is at 69, but I cast arcane intellect?
---
Blacklisting someone for needing on a marginal upgrade when it’s a massive upgrade and the item will get more mileage for someone else. I get that you have 0 regard for other people and forming good rapport, but don’t oversimplify things. 
---
A rogue that takes a certain xbow in LBRS that would get much more mileage on a hunter should receive every bit as much heat. 
---
You need allies to make it anywhere after 60, so it’s advisable to learn how to make them. It’s perfectly reasonable to not want to play with someone who has 0 empathy for the people they’re playing with.

I literally saw someone doing the exact same thing on Zandalar Tribe.

Of course anything CAN happen,  you're making it seem like it happens frequently,  when in reality it is an anomaly.

In STV I deliberately go after players that are several levels over me just to see if I can. Some times I can, sometimes I can't.

Commenting to save this
---
the undercutting cuz there was no way to circumvent it and the AH was shit in gw
---
It is pretty sweet. I leveled a paladin as protection back in the day. It was so much fun.
---
+1 for enchanting with tailor, but just know: You will go broke leveling enchanting. You end up DE'ing all the greens you get instead of vendoring them, so saving up for a mount/having cash lying around becomes problematic.
---
&gt; Still, good work with the root-and-wrath!

I love how you compliment the most basic shit to not seem critical. Neither of these dudes played well, just say it.

I spend at least half of my playing sessions either running to places or with my thumb up my ass waiting for one of the 12 quest mobs I need to pop up along with 6 other people doing the same quest.   I honestly have no idea how people get to 60 without playing literally all day and night.  Im 34 and already almost completely burnt out on grinding.
---
Don’t let your relationships fall apart before this “high” passes.
---
Not true, data actually shows there are more Alliance players overall if you look at all realms combined. The PvE realms are almost all (if not all) Alliance dominated, so queue times shouldn't be heavily weighed in either direction I'd say.

I believe he was more talking about the +25 fishing pole we get from a quest in the hinterlands

Dual wield doesn't deal consistent damage. You'll miss most of the time. That's why you need gear to back it up. 
---
Dual wield only beats out 2h if your at the hit cap.

2h deals more damage from your instant abilities.

Here's the math since you think im uninformed brother check this out
---
\+15 agi and +25 Agi ARENT in the game, so explain to me how Dalrends 50 AP 1% crit is better than peacemakers 56 AP 1% crit and +9int enchant.
---
Peacemaker is WAY better for hunters. 
---
Even when +15 agi comes into the game its only a 4 attack power difference from peacemaker with +25 agi. Its never worth it for a hunter to take dalrends from a melee class. If you think that a hunter taking the BiS DPS swords from people is a good option for them you are seriously retarded.

Why do people act like their ignore list is the end all be all? Pretty dumb.
---
It destroyed the server community. It doesn't matter if you're an asshole in the dungeon finder, you can just queue up again and never see those people again. In wow classic now, if you're an ass, people will remember. There are some idiots on my server that are now having trouble finding a group, because people have been forewarned.

lol I feel you.
---
In general, no, you shouldn't be using all your skills, and unless you have someone funding your mount, you should stop buying ranks in many of them to save money. Demoralizing Shout, for instance, is only really useful if you're planning on tanking. In another case, there's no good reason to buy rank 2 of Overpower while leveling.
---
I'm at 49 now, and I haven't used Rend in 10 levels, I only touch Hamstring to stop runners, Slam and Thunder Clap have been collecting dust and I'm honestly not sure why they're still on my bars, and I've been skeptical about Heroic Strike for a while now. In fact, the only things you have right now that I still regularly use are Sunder Armor, Battle Shout, and Overpower. 
---
I would need to check again, but at your level, I think Sunder Armor, Rend, and Heroic Strike are the most important skills for you.
---
Absolutely. Toxic behavior exists in every game and Classic in general is pretty tame. People who say Vanilla had less toxicity clearly didn't play back then.
---
It's Tinkmaster in Ironforge.
---
A *lot* of people are glad the armor bikinis are a thing of the past. They should stay there.
---
lol how the hell do you remember these events? LIke down to the level you were. Do you think about the times you were trolled on WoW 15 years ago often?
---
An advantage for sure, but not huge. At that point 99% of rogue pvp fights are ganks. Ganking in my opinion is when the initiator is likely to win the vast majority of the time. While the element of surprise tips the scales in your favour it isn't like their target is helpless most of the time(assuming the rogue isn't able to 100% stunlock you from 100-0 hp.)

It’s been working great for me, not sure tbh
---
Fuck, there's dozens of us. DOZENS! Like, I want to be 60, sure. I want to experience the raid content I never got to in vanilla, sure. But with no new phases yet announced, and my mage sitting in the high 40s, I'm feeling just fine about that. I don't need to run ZF GY spam for another 5 levels, thanks.
---
Also, the one Cath AoE run I did, we didn't kill any bosses. Is this the norm? I don't even know, but damn, I want loot, too. Our AoE Cath run took almost the same time as a guildie run of the full instance, and we killed the damn bosses! (Still didn't get Whitemane's Chapeau.)

This is wrong. Onyxia is on a 5 day reset timer. Her next reset is in 39 hours.

Yeah this is fake as shit I was leveling in the shimmering flats the other day and noted how daisy duke was wearing daisy dukes and said “haha blizz” because I never understood references when I first played this game when I was 12
---
I had this mage in a run the other day in ZF.. I was 2h tanking. Wasn’t marking as most of us were at high end of spectrum and shit was melting.. mage repeatedly sheep’d mobs with rend and other dots, many pulls in a row until my guildie suggested he save his mana. Was good for a laugh out of us AND helped him learn something

Didn't know

According to wow forums there is a mass exodus of alliance from Skeram to the new servers.

Have fun trying to rank in phase 2 horde gankers

I’ve been leveling Druid too, and while everyone keeps reminding me they’re not as good at the end of Vanilla, I can’t wait to run world PvP at 60 in a pair with a warrior and just out last everyone.

i love the fucking slippery slope argument for "WHAT HAPPENS NEXT???" for shorts being made slightly longer
---
Nah nah nah, the way I learned it over a decade ago Star is Sheep and Moon is Shackle.
---
I had a warrior tank posting overall damage with him in the lead after every pull. He clearly hadn't cleared his numbers from when he was questing. He was doing a third of any of the dps. He wasn't even beating my wand and I was healing just trying to proc spirit tap.
---
This is fake bros go check her character model right meow it’s the one on the right
---
Just want to say thanks again. This fixed it.
---
Thats the stupid thing about vanilla wow though. Alot of gear and Itemization is mixed where you have to roll on other classes gear. This is more of a problem with itemization not players. But when the literally BEST piece of gear drops for you, why wouldnt you roll for it
---
Not an hour, but even 30 minutes. Why rush when clearly no one is ready? There's always somebody slow, I just make sure it's not me.
---
It's anyone's guess, we don't know how long between phases and the AQ gates are relatively late into the game. 
---
I have a gut feeling it's going to be 2 years for all 6 phases, but I have no proof other than the belief that they'll stick to the 2 year duration per expansion they've done since TBC. If that's the case, I'd expect phase 5 to start 16 months after launch.
---
Omg. I love that this is a troll post and everyone is losing their minds.

This is how it is supposed to be. There isn’t anything wrong here. Even if it made them easier to kill, the gold per hour is only limited by the instance reset lockout.

Mage is the new huntard.
---
My guild took advantage of the transfer from Skeram to Heartseeker and I feel like overall the decision has been well received. Some people probably had to leave behind some friends and pug groups, but overall heartseeker seems to be doing well. Without even considering the H/A ratio just getting away from the prime time queues was enough for it to be worth it for me. As far as the H/A ratio it definitely seems like it swings towards the Alliance, but I don't think it is as anywhere as skewed as it is on Skeram. In STV you can still find plenty of horde roaming around and it doesn't feel like the Alliance just overwhelm them there are opportunities for good pvp skirmishes without one side being totally outnumbered. Just my take on it so far hard to fully know anything without real #s from blizzard.

Druids are the ones playing the long con.

Can someone do this for hunters, but every icon is multi shot?
---
Interesting to see this as a popular opinion. I mained rogue in vanilla and sap was always circle
---
You can still vanish with faerie fire on you and it will remove roots, but you won't go into stealth.
---
Spellcleave is an all magic aoe group for dungeons. 
---
One priest. One lock and 3 mages.  
---
A shielded eye of kilrog gets roamed through a portion of the dungeon pulling dozens of mobs at once.
---
Once the eye dies, all the mobs aggro the warlock and return to where he is.  
---
Once all mobs flood out to the warlock all 3 mages cast their slows. Nova's. And aoes. Same with lock.   They kill the 20+ mobs fairly quickly.  Rinse repeat.  Each pull is a a lot of experience. And a super fast way to level and harvest greens and cloth.
---
Oh hell yeah, can't wait to do this!
---
It still is.
---
What melee weapons should i be using as a hunter while leveling?
---
I'm level 45 and so far have only used daggers. I know you shouldnt be meleeing much, but im wondering mainly for the stat buffs.
---
Just based on your preferences I would say rogue. Locks have very limited mobility and get forced into an anchor position in BGs. Also, I main rogue because no matter what is going on in world pvp, I can choose how the fight starts(and ends with trinket, sprint, vanish, stuns, etc). Not to mention locks have to farm a shit ton of soul shards before each battleground if you want to play it optimally
---
When I was levelling through Barrens there was a dude who I "ninja'd" a node from maybe five times? Of course, I never actually ninja'd it, I think he just assumed that every node he sees on his map automatically belongs to him even if someone else is already at it.
---
He even demanded, in very broken English, that I give him the silverleaf I looted. Fucking **silverleaf**.
---
I would have liked them to release Classic as a "finished" version of vanilla, as I heard there was some stuff missing/unfinished for vanilla launch. I would really like the to add some of cut or planned vanilla content into Classic, then continue developing with the same design philosophies.
---
I would also like to see the game progress to BC and WotlK, but with changes so it is more like Classic.
---
You have several options to make this a no brainer;
---
1) Use questie add on which will place quest markers with level on your map, it becomes very clear where to go next. 
---
2) there is a free website that spoonfeeds you instructions from 1-60. 
---
3) use wowhead and filter quests by level and zone, go to the zone with quests your level
---
Depends on how long the mobs takes to dies. If it dies quick you might want to skip using CoA to save mana to avoid downtime when you're grinding.
---
Did you not even purge his ice barrier?
---
If you do what I do and move lfg chats to a new window (which you can do by right-clicking the channel name and choosing the option, or by simply creating a new chat window and fiddling with the filters), I recommend ensuring that System Messages and Whispers are shown in the new window so you don't have to keep tabbing back and forth.

---
I’d bet any class at 60 CAN do it. It’s more of a matter of effectiveness. Warlocks and hunters can do it way quicker than anyone so that is why it’s a great gold farm for them.
---
Saying LF big dick heals! Is a joke. Crying about it on reddit isn’t a joke. It’s just sad lol.

Thank you for this, I'm a new tank and new to WoW and this was very much appreciated.

Love little WoW mysteries like this.

---
This meme is great, be proud

Without a doubt greed played some part in it. If there were no wisp of profit on the horizon, wow classic would have never seen the light.
---
But now that it's such a smashing success at launch, it will absolutely turn catch the eye of the Activision board.
---
Dying is 10% durability lost to all items currently equipped, while spirit rezzing is 25% durability damage to all items both equipped and in your inventory.
---
my main tank kept saying pizza instead of circle.  Half the raid was like wtf there is no pizza
---
I’m new myself so I might be wrong but hunter has been a lot of fun, and having a pet has proven to be really helpful in situations where I don’t have other players. Not 100% sure how desired hunters are in end-game content though.
---
Very cool of you to do!! Very sorry to hear about your friend.
---
Like it was said, you can kill mobs on the way to a quest giver, but if you follow levelling guides you'll notice how efficient questing can be when you don't play how your average player does. Things are a lot less linear, you don't really walk back and forth handing in quests very often. It's a lot of "Head here, do some quests, then run to this area nearby you have quests for, do those, hand them in and then fly back to the original zone to hand in the first set." Completed quests will stack for a while so if you have to return to a weird location you'll probably be handing in multiple quests. There are also a lot of other tricks, like running to Sentinal Hill and flying back to Darkshire if you need to go from one end of Duskwood to the other, that speed up the process. 
---
Questing only seems inefficient because people are playing inefficiently, but I don't blame them because it takes a lot of game knowledge to quest that way. Guides work well because they're built on that accumulated knowledge.
---
Seriously, like what the hell makes you think I want to waste the beautiful happy green 125% attacking power of my pet by sacrificing it, then being obligated to give it fish out of my reserve? You think I do this for fun? Na. Dumb ass hunters are bad but dumbass tanks are worse.
---
3 of these I've literally never seen
---
Hum yeah this is definitely not standard after the first 4
---
When I did that quest, they were going for 4g/each on AH. I message one of the sellers and offered them a 1g tip to craft 2x (one for a guildie) with my mats. So 1g while IN Un'Goro is a steal IMO.
---
Whirlwind's animation is usually canceled by the auto-attack animation when I play, because I'm usually mashing Whirlwind when I have no rage and so the auto that generates enough rage also breaks the spin animation. However, even if the animation is canceled, the damage still goes off.
---
because 2v4 isnt going to improve the odds at all. Perhaps if it were one less?
---
Skull means poison. Don't touch it!

Though keep in mind Blizzard broke classiccensusplus about a week ago so, while the data is probably pretty close to accurate for now, it won't be forever.

---
I've leveled a few things so far, to various levels. I'm torn on what I want, but narrowed it down. Here is what I like about the ones I've narrowed it down to. I've tanked, healed, and DPSd at a high level in BC, WOTLK, Cata, and MOP. I enjoy playing any spec, and am not picky.   
---
I plan to raid eventually, do a ton of dungeons, and everything PVE. Rarely PVP. Maybe the occasional battleground just for fun.  
---
Druid: I loved resto in BC and WOTLK, but looks a bit less interesting in Classic. I love the mobility, ease of leveling, and variety. Lore wise, it's also interesting. I like that there are less of them, so this makes gearing a lot faster.   
---
Paladin: I love the lore, the variety, and playstyle at end game from the look of it. The free mount is nice. The AOE farming potential of prot looks solid. The leveling looks bad, and terribly boring, though.  But end game, even 40+ looks very fun. I resonate the most with this class currently.  
---
Hunter: The easy leveling is nice. The insane gold farming looks wonderful. But I don't really think I'd enjoy PVE at 60 outside solo play. That's a huge turn off, but everything else seems wonderful. I'm leaning against this one a bit.  
---
Rogue: Very fun all around, but there are just so many and gearing would be a chore. I dislike the lack of utility I'd bring to the table like druid and paladin, and resonate less to this class than druid and paladin. But very fun to play.  
---
Thanks guys! Hope to choose tonight.
---
What about BC class balance? I've heard that was good, more choices whilst classes still felt unique.
---
None - AoE?
---
Tide pods
---
Awww I thought green was frog
---
They have a decent dodge rating when it comes to stacking Agility, but I don’t see it very viable for too much.
---
No it wasn’t, the whole run was filled with criticism. The healer also made snarky comments like “I usually don’t have to drink unless the TANK loses aggro” I am not going to lie, because I did lose aggro when I was netted and disarmed, not sure what I could do, taunt is melee range.
---
If you're drain tanking I assume you're affliction, not sure how it could be failing for you unless you didn't get Dark Pact or Fel Concentration, or you forgot to use your new rank of spells, or you're righting red mobs. 
---
Very very few enemies are immune to drains. Sucks for that one quest but it isn't a long term problem. 
---
Yes, monster HP scales really hard, far faster than new spell ranks or gear do, but this just means you can't 3dot+fear juggle as easily, drain tanking one enemy at a time still works fine and sustains infinitely.
---
can't you say the same thing about classic wow then?
---
I also agree with the first 11 points into arms. Make a macro for charge. Something simple like
---
# showtooltip charge (remove the space between the pound sign and showtooltip)
---
/cast battle stance
---
/cast charge
---
Make sure to delete and ranks in the macro or they will break when you train higher ranks. Like charge(rank 2)
---
I prefer to thunderclap before swapping back to def stance but if you want more off the cuff aggro you can make another macro like this one
---
# showtooltip Demoralizing shout 
---
/cast Defensive stance
---
/cast Demoralizing shout
---
With those 11 points in arms and a solid charge macro, you can start each fight with rage and a free demo shout. It really helps your momentum. Right now people are still in their bfa mindset of burning everything the second its pulled, and many posts on this sub are ones complaining of threat issues. While fury makes you flow better, be sure to consider key talents in prot like +15% aggro and -3 rage per sunder which will make your dungeons with randos less of a nightmare
---
There's not necessarily a reason to stop... Give people wanting to relive various expansions the chance to do so,  all the way up to retail and in the mean time start up new servers that start at classic again for the people that want to experience the 'fresh server smell'.
---
Think of it like diablo seasons.
---
Fairbanks ally here, can confirm. Having to skip entire zones due to constant outnumbered ganking is not the PVP experience I remember.
---
400 milliseconds doesn't sound fast though, unless you for some reason ignore the 400 and only read milliseconds.
---
Guess so. Meanwhile, I've killed the Golem Lord around 30 times and haven't seen the ring or trinket drop. :-(
---
I'm curious too.
---
Only reason he won is because he caught the rogue before he got opened on from stealth, you're pretty much fucked if the rogue gets to cheap shot you
---
Yup im aiming for rank 10 for the blue set and ill be happy as well. Was rank 10/11 back in vanilla on 2 toons then the raid gear started overtaking the pvp gear and required less time investment so I stopped
---
Hey dude I just got my ww axe today too. Grats!
---
Fear? No. Banish? Yes.
---
I'm confused, how does fishing /cooking help with epic mount?
---
Yes, im really hope they get a little cheaper 😂
---
Now combine with Seduction and Curse of Elements, and see *why* Warlocks were such powerhouses in PvP back then. Just wait ;)
---
Like seriously, wtf? They would have to manually have changed that!
---
oof, these feels.
---
Doesn't matter what kind. All you care about is the stats. If you can get better stats off a 2h sword, use it. If you've got two daggers that are better, use them instead.
---
Noggenfogger can also do this to your hitbox. It turns you to a skeleton with water breathing. 
---
Also slowfall, which has been very useful to me in the past.
---
The other effect is a shrink. Noggenfogger and Deviate Delight are both very useful for taurens who don't want to have tauren hitbox or be completely blinded by their bodies in narrow spaces.
---
Because alliance sucks huge blue berry muffins
---
It's fine up to the point you're at, but now that you're about to hit dungeons, I wouldn't. Blue weapons are significantly better than green and astoundingly better than whites at the same level, and will go for proportionately more on the AH as a result. But dungeons drop them, and you can roll on them for free, although it's going to sometimes be a pain to actually get dungeon groups as a warrior if you don't want to tank.
---
This makes me happy to be a druid. Being forced to respec to Resto at 60 makes me sad again though...
---
Nah man. Doesn’t work that way. He’s not describing a healthy amount of gaming.
---
*sigh* **unzips**
---
So while your leveling. Go fury or arms( preference really, I personally level arms) you can 2h tank till about 48 then you want to always have a 1h and shield plus at low levels before you have pummel it’s nice to shield bash for interrupts.. if you go arms. Definitely take tactical mastery as you’ll be dancing a lot to intercept/taunt, re apply rend etc. warriors pretty complicated in vanilla in that respect. 
---
Be sure to bind all your stances to easily accessible keys as you’ll be switching around very frequently during each fight.
---
I can’t say to spec a specific way for leveling as pre lvl 40 it’s really preference. A lot of people swap from fury to arms to get mortal strike at 40, but also a lot of people stay 2h fury till the 50s and then switch to dual wield as they get +hit% pieces. Just check out some guides online if you need a baseline and kinda tune it to your own playstyle..
---
I’d like to offer more but it’s tough without a specific question. Feel free to ask away though and I’ll answer to the best of my ability

WHAT?!
---
Didn't you just say it doesn't matter in the slightest? Now you seem to have an agenda. There has always been games out there without bikini armor, variety is what makes fantasy and video games in general great. Instead of trying to censor every game series that contains things you hate, you should just play the ones that cater to your needs instead.  
---
The reason people get annoyed with censorship is precisely for that reason, they don't want every game of series to have bikini armor but they don't want it to be removed from games that do have it.
---
So basically ignore all of that and the hunter's pet hits the group behind all that as "tab-target is funky".

You’re welcome.

Some people who came to play classic didn't do so for the "fresh server smell," or just for nostalgia. Some people just missed the core gameplay experience that existed in Vanilla but was diluted as years passed. Those people shouldn't need to constantly restart over and over.

Back in the day when arena was still young there weren't that many viable 3s comps. When the dust settled in S2 and S3 it became pretty clear that the recipe for success in an arena 3s comp was:
---
1. Melee dps with a mortal strike effect (99% of the time this meant rogue or arms warrior)
---
2. Ranged dps with crowd control effects and tempo control (99% of the time this meant frost mage or affliction lock)
---
3. Healer that can get active in the fight. (99% of the time this means disc priest or resto druid)
---
This meant that the bulk of strong arena teams in the relatively stable middle section of the expansion were things like (Rogue/Mage/Priest) or (Warrior/Lock/Druid) or variants there of. Teams that deviated meaningfully from this paradigm were usually given their own name. Notably things like shadowplay from earlier on being shadowpriest/warlock/healer.
---
In late S3 and then S4, we started to see stat inflation. The expansion was in it's twilight content. Armor pen as a stat is starting to get out of hand, people getting hilariously stated up. People have legendaries and tier 6. Traditionally in WoW melee scales better with gear and people started realizing teams that got rid of the controlling caster were actually really good.
---
This started with the advent of the Warrior/Rogue/Druid team. You essentially lose your ranged controlling/ccing class but gain a second melee blender. Which means there is no longer this interesting dance of crowd control and tempo and people started to give these teams derogatory names that implied they were easy and stupid. Names like "Meatgrinder" and "Cleave" were used to describe them. As more variants of this team comp became popular with two melee just going hog wild and demolishing someone (like rogue/rogue/druid) the various team compositions were starting to just be referred to as _____Cleave to delineate which form of it they were.
---
At the advent of wrath of the lich king PvP was in a messy state and damage numbers were very high relative to where they probably should have been so a lot of these "zerg down one of their guys with our big dick dps" strategy teams were incredibly popular. Except now it wasn't just melee who were going hog wild and killing people, it was all sorts of different shit. However the naming convention of _____Cleave to denote mindless team comp that plans to just zerg blender someone stuck. So you started seeing names like "Spellcleave" to denote a comp where spellcasters were going to try to just frontload a ton of damage and blow you up at once.
---
Since then "Cleave" as entered the WoW lexicon to basically mean "mindless zerg retardfest" and can be applied to anything in a derogatory but sometimes endearing way. So people saying SPELLCLEAVEEEE in scarlet monastery lfg are saying "were going to blow the instance up with 3 mages, a warlock, and a priest.

That's pretty hyperbolic... This isn't ugly, it isn't disgusting, nor is it that big of a deal lol. Just kill more and get the drop, then move on. Seriously, mountain out of a molehill.
---
Yup, pretty much. Most pre-raid bis gear is from drops in endgame dungeons (BRD, LBRS, UBRS, and Strat). A few pieces for some classes might come from quests in the ~50s or like, Mara and ST. There's also some that are crafted, like for mages the pre-raid bis chest is a BoP from tailoring so you'll need to train tailoring.

You can always pay others for enchants, you can't just always buy stuff from another engineer.
---
it comes from 'cleave' an aoe skill for warriors. Stacking warriors without a tank was a good way to quickly clear instances because of a lack of downtime (as long as you didn't mind loot sharing).
---
spellcleave is just a similar approach but with casters.
---
Yep, do your best to get as much of the gear on the list and fill out with whatever else you have. Make sure to grab any necessary consumables as well.

It should show as from unknown sender but I don't know if that was something added later in wow development cycle.

If it sent and was removed from your inventory and postage was paid then it sent

make a farming alt and level them + professions
---
you kinda need em as warriors are mediocre at farming even with gear
---
Oily Blackmouth are good sellers too, since they are needed for Free Action Potions.
---
Depends on what youre buying...with any farmable item the person being undercut will vastly prefer to be undercut by 1c, they don't want the market for their items to be destroyed.
---
I'm having zero issues, but do note that in classic, it only lasts for 5 hits. Any hit will take a charge, too, so be careful.
---
Valid point
---
Ughh. HYPE..
---

Lol I haven't caused any wipes yet

I prefer LoS obstacles against squishy casters, agreed.

---
DS/ruin is primarily a raid spec because you lose too much utility without being able to use a pet. It’s worth it for the damage boost for raiding, but not for dungeoning.
---
You will never steal aggro with rain of fire in a raid.
---
Was a horde Druid player during Vanilla but switched to alliance to play with my wife this time. But I know the struggle with paladin and holy priest that don’t want to fight, especially if you are resto
---
You're not from an imbalanced server and it obviously shows.  
---
&gt; And even in these scenarios, there are plenty of options:
---
* 10 level 40's cannot fight off a group of marauding 60's as well as  a horde of level 40's in the same zone.  
---
* moving from one contested zone to another just doesnt do anything if the faction imbalance means the new zone will just have the same imbalance.  
---
* asking for high level players on LFG chat to help gets ignored. Ive tried this whilst leveling in STV (thankfully finished that zone) when a party of marauding 60's was going around ganking levelers constantly.  
---
* taking a break doesnt fix anything. It only allows for a brief reprieve before going back into the chaos.  
---
just how on earth do you expect people to adapt to a heavily imbalanced server?  
---
Leveling elsewhere is just the same situation but different backdrop.
---
Maybe you’re focusing too much on the destination and not enough on the journey? I know that was my situation, but with a career, kids, adult stuff, I just don’t have the time to hit 60 anytime soon.
---
Took me a while to accept that, but as soon I stopped trying to “compete” to get to level 60 I began to see the game itself and enjoy the little things.
---
I also love the random peaceful moments between horde and alliance. I was questing in desolate late and ran into a bunch of horde at the kodo round up quest point. Decided to just inch up slowly while saluting. Everyone just waved and was super chill and just let me do the quest.
---
...do I smell a crusade coming on???
---
*grins shittly*
---
Sounds like you're leaning towards druid or paladin. 
---
I play a resto druid and its in my opinion really fun, interesting, and versatile. Plus, its almost impossible for people to kill me in PvP unless they gank me or have numbers. 
---
Paladin seems like fun...eventually. If you can get over auto attacking for the early levels you get rewarded with tankiness and utility which is nice. Plus, you can choose to be any role.
---
They're both really similar classes in that they're very versatile. You can be any role you want to be with them. I think you should leave it up to what kind of style you want to play with. Paladins are melee damage, heals and utility while druids are a mix of basically everything.
---
Dude doesn't even have a neck.
---
They do not drop from the same boss. Are you sure you are not thinking of the Dal'Rend screenshots that have been posted?
---
I rerolled from a 42 druid. Wasn't bad at all, if anything I was able to be a lot more streamline in the lvling process after rerolling.
---
I think you made some valid points.
---
I'm thinking lifetap+drain life will do fine unless I killed many mobs. First aid and cannibalize compliment eachother nicely and replace food and water for the most part but it's all about having no downtime and you might be right, dark pact might really help with that on some levels and gear.

Unless the same rogue or warrior that needed on your blackcrow is in your ubrs, you’re just taking out your frustration on someone who did nothing wrong to you. I’m not saying you can’t need on upgrades, but your reasoning is both flawed and slightly unhealthy.

Make a macro from this, just use it whenever you enter a party.

Tbh Lay on Hands seems to be made for WPvP, in PvE you're very very rarely going to use it unless it would save you from getting wiped, a Paladin without mana is useless.
---
In WPvP though, where you are very often going to be attacked while you're at a disadvantage either because of low health/mana or while fighting mobs, having an on demand full heal that gives you some mana (I very rarely use lay before I run out of mana) and armor if you took improved lay is enough to turn the tides in your favor.
---
While questing in STV my lay is basically always on cooldown.
---
me too, how?
---
I play on Felstriker, one of the least populated servers out there, and last night was the first time in quite a while that I felt competition for mobs. It was also the first time since starting that I felt a desire to gank Horde just to keep them from tagging my mobs.
---
Luckily, I got my 10 without sacrificing my morals.
---
[Mines are bugged right now and detonate immediately after being placed instead of after several seconds](https://youtu.be/PntJDY5fRl8).
---
Your best bet is to constantly kite or cc them hard.  Healers have to time their heals to go off as soon as mines get placed if you want to survive.
---
I've got like 84 spell dmg now at lvl 52. (only 7 of it frost from the mage wand). Am I overdoing it? It seems pretty nice bit maybe spirit would be better im the long run.

---
It's literally "Classic WoW". It's literally the entire point of the whole thing.
---
I don't think he needed to. Watching the vid it looks like the mage got aggro on the mobs and they knocked it off for the Pally.
---
That would be so useful on a pally too with how illumination works/ed.
---
I can’t install a windows OS or anything?? I didn’t think so but I thought maybe the internet would know, oh well sounds like holidays will be the only way to solve this.
---
im literally shaking rn
---
But literally every PVP server was horde majority from the start lol
---
Wait, there's karazhan in classic? Is it the same as tbc? (From the outside ofc)
---
How about caverns of time?
---
I'd be happy I'd you got screenshots, I could never find footage on google
---
I rerolled from Dudu to rogue in BC and went on to cap two of every class one horde one ally but never progressed any more than where I left off with my first toon. He got stuck in a time warp it feels too funky to even choose him on the character selection screen.
---
Hmmm well each FORM has a few spells but really the rotation is simple. Feral (DPS) is claw claw rip or something, healer is just regen/Healing Touch, Bear (Tank) is growl/demoarlizing roar(aoe threat) maul. The only complex part is making a macro to switch to healer drop a regen then switch back to bear/cat.
---
First 2 are right, next 4 are just icons for any cc, last 2 are tank and healer
---
I mean, if you want all the changes back, play retail WoW?
---
what a dick
---
LOL. Yes. Superior retail skills.
---
Why does Rotgrip take so long? Is there a method of killing him that isn't just jumping down there and trying to hill him before he kills you?
---
im just at level 30 after picking druid as a new toon to roll..
---
cat for fps,
---
bear for tank,
---
normal for heals.
---
moonkin for... bankstanding, moonkin is terrible in classic
---
Never heard it before lol
---
Well. At least I've learned this at 47. Thank you lol.

I wouldn't be surprised if it was just that Blizzard themselves forgot the naming conventions when they made Chromie and then tried to retcon it.
---
Whisper a mage, tell them you'll be gone quicker if you can join them for 5 mins and will gank the opposing faction, or fuck up their pulls so they die.
---
Meh. I bind the marks from f5 on and only consistently use skull and X for first and second kill. I also use shield for tank and star for healz.
---
People need to understand that Canadiens aren’t nice.

SS- This is the first part in a series recorded last month on the night of WoW classic's release. The intention is to preserve the meaning of this historic event.
---
Join me on my voyage from a 90s gamer kid in love with blizzard to a grown man looking back on it all and starting again.
---
Eh i had a look and perhaps i just missed it or maybe we have different ideas on what quantifies 'explaining'. Skills and an action bar equals more change than the last whatever many expansions? A stretch dude, a long thin one about to snap. Be it mechanically or in terms of mechanics, wow vanilla and wow retail is nothing alike these days. You honestly can't adequately argue the need for bfa to be an mmo, nor claim it as much of an RPG.
---
I don't think there's much of an argument; DotA was a WC3 mod and League of Legends was created by someone who sold the original DotA forum to Riot.
---
What about Tanaris or Tanaris?
---
This legit made me LOL.
---
That is literally the whole meme I am using.
---
There were 6 other expansions before BFA and none of that content is there, its just the base game from 2005. All of that stuff you want is content from other expansions.
---
I'm lv 15 is there any low lv dungeoning I can do?
---
Yes, those two are what I'm leaning towards. And I like that they are always needed and welcomed. They can do a variety, which quenches my altaholic tendencies. I like their lore and playstyle the most. The autoattacking is boring, but I can deal with it I'm sure.
---
If not on tank i view it as 3rd target after skull and x
---
Go the drain tanking build! Ignore aggro.

YouTube and Twitch banned people for streaming private servers, but simply playing a private server isn't illegal. They can still get the ads taken down.

My little brother got me hooked on WoW in ‘2005. He passed away 14 July 2007. I play his dwarf hunter named Kalajeera on Classic Bloodsail Buccaneers. I miss him and I miss playing wow together. I think he would approve of Classic.

Hit me up if you’re on the same server.
---
A layer is like an instance of the overworld that players are filtered into so it doesn't get too crowded. You can change layers by joining a party of someone in that layer. People have been abusing it to grind mobs faster
---
No love for Banish. :(
---
This is probably an obvious answer to a non-noob but what button is that for the pet growl macro?
---
Feral mountain lions in hillsbrad are the same
---
2-3 sunders on the target is fine.
---
With an invite to a different layer you can get the mobs of that layer and/or avoid other players close to you. Easy to exploit to farm exp, rares, etc
---
Fuck, my mage macro marks target I sheep with square.
---
I'd agree with most of these. Skull first, X second, Moon is sheep, Square is freeze trap but the rest are just general CC. if I have two mages I'll use a moon and assign another mark as second sheep.
---
Ooooo gotcha, didn’t even know about that
---
Well only grind dungeons if you’re going to grind. 30/40 is worse then 40/50
---
Who cares?
---
Because if you overlevel the dungeon you can and you should just tank in zerker stance with a 2H spamming WW and Cleave. 
---
Note: Stops working so well around 50+... but is honestly still doable
---
Yeah nah dude. Having watched the first 3 minutes, it's not a well out 5 together argument. And they invited PLENTY OF NON streamers.  Work on a script prior, there's enough drama on YouTube.
---
Wich one ?
---
I have a girlfriend and a few different circles of friends. My brother lives on the other side of the country and likes to game to hang out (he will not play wow). I have a family I like to spend time with. One character and he just hit 40 last night.
---
You’re 3 digits off!
---
1. Meta doesn’t matter in Classic. 
---
2. Enchanting has nothing exclusive you cannot get by other enchanters 
---
It really boils down to personal choice. If you want some extra % go Engineering though. Without being able to scribe enchantments on paper rolls it doesn’t even benefit your alts.
---
Classic Cyrus.
---
You don’t “have” to wait at all, but if you rip and die, don’t blame the tank when threat meters are available and you know you have a chance to Crit. 
---
I usually go in as a rogue right away in 5 mans if I have defensives available, otherwise I’ll hold off anywhere between 5 and 10 seconds. 
---
TLDR: use the tools available to you. There isn’t a simple answer to this because different players play differently.
---
I usually undercut to make the next digit lower. Someone listing for 10s and some extra copper? I'm listing that at 9s99c so that it's obvious mine is cheaper than yours. If you are listing at 9s99c, then I'm listing mine at 8s99c so that it's obvious my item is cheaper than yours. Can't fault people for buying the slightly more expensive item. After all, my stuff is basically the same price as their stuff.
---
I'm new to WoW and I don't know what all these LFG (I know this one) or BIS or WC all these acronyms, can someone link me someplace I can learn them or give me a quick guide? Thanks
---
I find it hilarious when people think they "have" bad luck, like it's some kinda thing that defines them. You understand that's just not possible, right?

Do some research before voicing your opinion. It's 2 different characters. There are no stairs on the shimmering flats.

Why? Diablo 3 had been out well before M+. Legion M+ was fun, but punishing on boss fights. BfA went the complete opposite direction where boss fights are a joke and trash is fucking AIDS-Cancer. Not sure how that's due to Diablo.
---
If you are horde you can do rage fire chasm
---
Lvl 6 Durator Tiger has 1.2
---
It's not impossible, but it's infeasible because this would be an *enormous* amount of work for what would likely be at best a small team of a few hobbyists.
---
There's not much difference between modding and straight up game development except modders don't get paid, and in this situation, the modders would even risk legal repercussions because they'd be doing something illegal.
---
In other words, anyone with the talent to actually do this well would probably rather be spending their time on something else. Anyone who tries is likely to be inexperienced and to abandon the project when they realise how much work it is for little gain, especially when they notice their own inexperience and start having to spend time cleaning up after their own mistakes and revising their own content.

It can fuck up peoples lives and make them ignore their dreams, relationships, hobbies, just to play video games and watch youtube.

What UI addons is this guy using for the frames and bars?
---
They say it's still going to this day
---
I read comments from way back then allready mentioning drain tanking and that it's working better and now even the guide on wowhead changed to that playstyle recently. 
---
The reason for that is the voidwalker on pserver did more damage so it could hold aggro better. On classic, even with improved skills, it can't hold aggro for shit because it does less damage.
---
If you want to learn more about it I provided a link in my other post here.
---
It's definitely not bad, and not something that you should change. I just disagree with people who say its an absolute necessity and is the best stat for leveling. The hassle of getting new gear to replace your current gear would waste more time than the minutes you save from spirit
---
I typically head directly to the dungeon once committed to running it.  I also get annoyed at people that don’t.
---
Maxcam addon can do it ez
---
gankings just a word with no clear definition, like cheese in sc2. It being something about killing someone is clear enough, but otherwise it means whatever u want it to.
---
Holy shit that copper price is insane. It sells for 50c per ore on my server
---
I just wanna say that sidestep was so freaking smooth
---
Apparently mages aren’t allowed to attack more than one NPC at a time now without it being AOE farming
---
if threat meter addons shows 100% is it safe to go or is there a hidden mechanic?

I don't have any guilds that I can point you towards but I just want to wish you luck! There should be a group for everybody.
---
YES!  My stepbrother, who passed away back in June, introduced me to the game.  I reserved his character and made him.  Gonna level him to 60 for him too.
---
That was all pre-release stuff and none of it did they say they were OK with layer swapping for farming. In fact, it actually says they fixed a bug that allowed players to do it by re-logging.

Maybe it was just a server thing then, but we called deadmines VC to avoid confusion. As a new player, I was confused at first but it made sense so it stuck. I imagine I wasn't the only one either

I played a Rogue through much of vanilla mixed in w/a Hunter. I can tell you no guide is going to help you. You honestly have to hone your skills and get guuder (meant to spell it horribly) at knowing how each class is going to fight you. Prime example is rogue who cheap shot or kidney shot a mage...guess what......\*blink\* Mages gonna blink through that BS. You gotta garrote and rupture those clothed nuggets. Make em bleed, make em panic. You just have to learn your class and learn what you can and can't do.

Do you think Blizzard would reskin Classic WoW with updated graphics, just to cash in even more with classic? The populaterity has seemed pretty huge. I'm a new player, and I know quite a few other new players irl and online. I imagine a reskin would bring even more in. 
---
I have zero intention on playing retail, just classic.
---
Yeah that's probably why they are giving you a run around. Maybe they have a policy about not exposing who ignores you. IDK. Ask your friend to check if he accidentally ignored you. If he doesn't look at it and it doesn't get fixed then assume he wants to keep it that way. Unless you guys regularly talk and it was actually an accident lol
---
Holy shit the mudjaw icon is literally the same face as the cat meme. Will never look at him the same.

Melee players have to have 110% or higher of the current tank’s threat in order to rip. Being at range increases this threshold to 130%.

---
Slow, but very detailed exploration!
---
Soooo after I commented that, Blizzard broke the census addons to fight the layering abusers.
---
Warlock is a good fit.
---
Pet + lifetap makes soloing easier, they have the unique ability to summon other players + soulstone, and have banish/seduce for CC.
---
&gt; I am a very casual player who doesn't have much free time to play games
---
wrong player for warrior, it's the most overpopulated, competitive, grindy and complicated class
---
you cant solo anything and you only shine in group content and/or when you get raid epics
---
I thought it was a max of 2 levels worth of rested and it stopped at 2 weeks.
---
Honestly, I will cancel if Blizzard refuses to budge on this. It's not about this one issue, but rather it is about Blizzard thinking that it's okay to make changes as long as they have a good enough reason. That kind of attitude will continue to creep into the game until eventually it becomes an unrecognizable mess.
---
Its eu thing
---
For me it's always been the first two, and then moon for CC.
---
I personally (being someone joining for the first time with the encouragement from friends that played) would love to be able to play through the expansions with them. And it would be cool if blizzard had the classic version stay and you could choose to go through each expansion as they come out. So you could either stay on classic or choose to upgrade to the expansions without having to start over.
---
Not until Cata, which is a long time away.  And you know what they say about time...
---
I played malganis alliance for a long time, specifically so that I could be outnumbered.
---
My classic server happens to be balanced, but I’m quite aware of what it is like to play on an imbalanced server.
---
Softies are transferring to avoid being ganked - Sad!  This just makes the problem worse.  I agree Blizzard should do something about this, but the people transferring are pathetic.  They should have just rolled on a pve server.
---
Okay, that makes sense if pserver VW was buffed so people got the impression it was useful for more than sac'ing for a shield, thanks for the clarification.
---
Sword of serenity main hand, green sword of the bear offhand imo. For mainland you look at damage range of weapon, not the speed. Speed is a good indicator though, as slower weapons usually have higher damage range.
---
Do you really want to be using fear in a dungeon because my succubus can seduce them with no problem.

Gotta get that 3900x and rtx 2080 ti and 32gigs of ram and 1gbps interwebs... and still get fucked by lack of optimizations lol
---
Don't think these target icons are universal across all servers/factions etc. Literally every group has a different interpretation about what each one should mean. But if you're playing a class with CC and your group needs it, the Tank will usually assign you to a specific mark beforehand.
---
I've been addicted to worse :D emphasise on been haha. It's a balance that works, I've loved gaming for 20 years, this is how I fit it in while still having time at the weekend for friends etc.  I don't do this 7 days a week and tend to have 2-3 days of not playing over the weekend :D

Thanks buddy!
---
Both fury and arms is viable for dungeons/open World. However fury does more damage and is the preferable spec.
---
surprised af anyone playing classic knows who this is, then i realized the community is probably much more composed of older people coming back for nostalgia, and less kids who couldn't make it past lvl 20 and went back to retail
---
Damn, if I would have known that my character would look like that I wouldn't have started the game as an elf.
---
Get to 10 at least. For example rogue is a nightmare but at least you get dual wield by then. 
---
It’s classic, all specs are welcome. Get 40 “pre raid” geared people with the appropriate number of tanks and healers and content is doable. These max and minners are just excessive. People did MC with like 25 lvl 60 people and a bunch pre-60. 
---
Want to get fast groups then be a good tank or an alert healer. Want to be able to spend more time solo and gold making then go dps. Find your flavor (spell, melee, ranged, with pet, etc.) and play to have fun. 
---
Just don’t be one of those AOE EVERYTHING mages or hunters that chain pull in dungeons. 
---
Side note: a big compliant to playing Druid is you look the same forever since you can’t see gear in animal forms.
---
But you know that's all in your head, right? It's still the exact same drop chance. His being there or not doesn't affect it. Also remember that with 1 million WoW players playing the game each day, 1 in a million events occur daily - you have just as good a chance of being the one to see them as anyone else.
---
Wouldn't you also need a big dick tank? To keep aggro from the big dick dps?
---
Actually no I'm dying from an incurable brain cancer, but that has nothing to do with my bad typing there except that its fucking up my vision. That;s mostly my clumsy fingers on my tiny phone touchscreen.
---
That's not fast either matey. Doesnt take much for dots to out-threat the VW, so I do wonder what benefit using the VW to tank a 2nd mob actually ends up giving you. Cant see how efficiency would be improved over the alternatives. Sure you can make it work, I just question if it's at all worth it. I am also aware of the 16 debuff slot limit, because ... yknow, it's not exactly groundbreaking information.
---
In Classic, they cannot be attacked and therefore cannot be used to gauge your DPS.
---

---
Wasn't it just because cleave was added as a stat during wod which caused a passive aoe effect?
---
Square is mind control.
---
People don't like the attitude that it's okay to police what others enjoy, which has been creeping into every facet of fandom for the past half a decade at least. It's not just about "longer shorts", it's the exact same pushback that gamers gave the puritanical right in the 90s.
---
My guild definitely used all these when raiding in Vanilla and BC.
---
yeah I'm one of those night owls, even if I didn't play I wouldn't be asleep before 1am. Always hated getting up early lol.
---
oh i thought moon meant auto attack once and leave it?
---
Mage here. Had a tank who kept nippling who he wanted polymorphed . I was so confused.
---
Sorry but no. Moon is obviously "Attack immediately after it is put to sleep"
---
I've already uninstalled.
---
It has always bugged me that 'moon' isn't hibernate.

If you just want it for yourself then training enchanting will cost more than just buying enchants you want.  
---
Keep in mind you'll still have to pay for mats either way.
---
But remember, when you group with clothies out in the world, turn off growl because you're in a group. That mage wanted to tank!
---
Moonkin is often called oomking,  because it has a lot of mana issues. You don’t have a great way to keep up your mana during fights, and don’t bring much utility to groups that a resto or feral Druid don’t. Feel free to play what you enjoy though, and you’ll have a lot more fun in the game. Other players may not share that sentiment though, so you may not be invited to each dungeon/raid group as moonkin

I absolutely love my orc hunter, but I have the itch to make a warrior alt. My biggest hesitation is that when I tank, I'll be expected to know where to go in dungeons and raids. I want to tank, just don't have the knowledge base to lead a squad. Will it hinder me or make people rage at me?
---
I like these videos, keep them coming! 
---
If you have a lvl 60 with an epic mount, could you do hyjal next?
---
Well apparently its not common for a lvl 40 to get a mount, cause apparently everyone has horrible spending habits and don't get their mount at lvl 40. Also this screenshot is pretty opposed to the ones with the UI still on in a not photogenic location.
---
More like "today someone held the door open for me, and asked me 'hey, will you hold the next door open for me?' and I said 'sure but I won't be going that way for a few minutes' and then they slammed the door in my face."
---
But whatever. Defend assholes and antisocial behavior in an MMO. I know which kind of person *you* are.
---
Just stick warlock. You have easy access to maraudon for income.
---
&gt; I'd like to submit my ui for clean consideration.
---
Honestly.  It's perfect.  A great mix of minimalist addons and tehe classic interface.
---
What addons are you using?
---
No offense to warriors. It's a hard life for them.
---
No. You'll hit a hard wall later in the game where any boss smacking a mage once will shatter them like cheap glass.
---
That was such an easy victory for your faction though.
---
No cleave was a term in use *long* before wod was even a twinkle in their terrible design team's eye. I mean I just explained how it came about in common use.
---
Circle has been sap for us since it was in an add-on before Blizzard added it.
---
Beef curtains
---
It’s a bad joke. If someone farts in your room because they think its funny, I’ll still not like it.
---
I believe the issue is that moonkin is very mana intensive and you just don’t have the mana to make it all the way through longer fights.
---
That being said, I’m sure you can make anything you want to work with a guild not trying super hard to be meta.
---
On behalf of the Horde, May your blades never dull!
---
A lot of the acronyms are for specific dungeons. WC is Wailing Caverns. BFD is Blackfathom Deeps. You'll pick those up pretty quickly as you play. BIS is Best in Slot which is usually an item that is the "best" for a given player at a certain time.
---
I picked up the habit to put the circle on the tank back in retail and have continued since
---
I literally never heard cleave used to denote aoe dps before wod.
---
What is an epic mount and what is so good about them?
---
I don't know a central place for all the acronyms, but BIS is Best In Slot (the best gear for that slot on your paperdoll), and Wailing Caverns (a dungeon in the Barrens).
---
Ask more acronyms, I'll try to respond.
---
tfw i was too undergeared to tank wc at 19
---
I could not  stay alive
---
essentially, yes.
---
It's impossible to beat a druid, but as balance druid is a shame for the rogue
---
You should whine less
---
Mage is far more lucrative, retard
---
I loved the return to difficult content in Cata. The current game now, I just can't get into.
---
You are fine either way.  You just have to decide which way you wanna chop, because it's all quality chop till later.   In vanilla we had arms warriors all the way until cthun in our raids.  100% effectiveness is not mandatory to succeed unless your guild specifically requires it.
---
zero.
---
BiS = best in slot (e.g. BiS necklace means that items the best possible necklace for the class in question)
---
RFC = ragefire chasm (low level dungeon)
---
WC = wailing caverns ( low level dungeon)
---
Wtb/s = want to buy/sell
---
Most other acronyms imagine you will see will just be short for dungeons/instances so probably just look up the dungeons.
---
run it on lowest settings and it should be fine.  You honestly don't need ultra settings in vanilla, it all looks the same after 10 minutes of gaming.
---
What class are you?
---
I’ll take bubbly beverage for 500, thank you very much Alex.
---
It's a joke....
---
Is pickpocket farming even worth it anymore? You get so little from Rogue Diaries, it’s only like 25g/hr
---
It’s amazing how much nonsense you spew in order to avoid having to accept that the data shows you’re wrong. 
---
Enjoy the block.
---
Fair enough; I’ve won enough 2v4s that I strongly disagree with this.  In a perfect setting like an arena I might agree, but classic world PvP has a lot of variables.  Level, mobs attacking one player or the other, long cooldowns like LoH, consumables, professions, etc.
---
“I’m not gonna spend an hour...” 
---
So you’re gonna let people die as a means of going faster? It’s fine to leave the grp or kick people but being petty and saying “I’m not gonna heal if you pull aggro” or “you pull it you tank it” isn’t going to be more efficient... 
---
So either you people don’t really act like you say you do in dungeons or you’re absolutely miserable to play with—two wrongs don’t make a right yknow
---
Fuck ur dumb
---
or maybe they hadnt anticipated this level of imbalance?...  
---
I would understand a slight imbalance but when its heavily skewed to one side to the point where you see, just within your surrounding area, 4 horde to 1 ally then its time to pack up and leave.
---
I did say “supposedly.” I don’t have a dog in this fight; I find the whole thing hilarious on both sides.
---
But I think you’re right; it’s most likely a case of Schroedinger’s Asshole.
---
and whats the reasoning? without speculating, can you provide a source where blizzard has said "please help the SJWs have a gun to our head oh god oh fuck"
---
I'm not sure, but I think that EU and NA regions are locked. I don't think you can start up on a NA server without a NA license. :(
---
Having sexual relations with the boss... AKA he’s self employed.
---
As someone who never made it far enough into WoW before this to truly do dungeons/raids, I appreciate this. 
---
My first legit run through on RFC, I was the asshole mage pulling everything because I didn’t understand how warriors picked up aggro. I didn’t tell them I was a first timer till we wiped a couple times. There mood immediately switched and they became super helpful and walked me through everything. They didn’t mention this stuff, though. Probably because we didn’t need it for RFC, but I legitimately didn’t know this. Thanks!

Ice trap is code for MD the healer
---
Questing with this competition on high pop server is depressing. Can you advise me build and rotation for heavy grinding with warlock, also Succubus or Voidwalker?
