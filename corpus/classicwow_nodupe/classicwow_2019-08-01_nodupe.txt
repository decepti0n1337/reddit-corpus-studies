I so will it!
---
---
---
No, I'm not saying that at all.
---

---
I'm just saying that YOU don't know for a FACT that it means before 8/13.
---
Which is entirely the whole catalyst for this conversation between us.
---
YOU made the absurd factual claim that the list is being released prior to 8/13.
---
YOU reinforced that claim by posting the same source we all have and gave us YOUR INTERPRETATION of the announcement and ADMITTED that you were only assuming.
---
YOU then doubled down after being called out and are trying to deflect.
---
I'm in the corner of "We don't know"
---
You're jumping from the "I know it's coming before 8/13" corner to the "I just assumed" corner to the "Well the odds say" corner.
---
Just give it up. You claimed you KNEW when it was coming out. You've been called out. Take the L and move on.
---
Man, we got this level 10 twink Shaman on this private server I'm on atm.  Dude is a straight legend, runs around Elwynn Forest all day with some addon that broadcasts when he kills another player.  Love you, Germei!  Doing God's work, son!
---
Mine would literally be Name, so I guess im going with Thex.
---
Edit: glossed over the *favorite* country part, so yeah could be different. But I like that this setup gives me the name Name.
---
Maybe but I really think Druids should have spells for all roles regardless. The beauty of the hybrid class is being to fill that dps slot for the dungeon run, or shift out and get the decurse going when the group doesn't have another druid or mage.
---
I will be posting my realm choice when the time comes.
---
The missing talents will be huge. 
---
For Paladins, Prot wasn't viable until BC. BC brought Avengers Shield and solved a lot of the mana issues (I don't think Paladins got a taunt until 3.0, though). Ret also became more viable with lots of group buffs and Crusader Strike. Holy was arleady good, but became much better.
---
Here is a list of things that came into existence in BC:
---
Druid: became viable Bear tanks - the best tank on some bosses. Resto got huge buffs. Feral became really viable.
---
Hunter: buffs across the board. BM was insane ('big red pet' memes) and Marks was decently good dps with a one click macro.
---
Mage: Dragons breath, Water elemental, better balanced arcane tree.
---
Priest: Circle of Healing (so OP) for holy, Shadow became hella viable, Disc became (sort of) viable (sometimes).
---
Rogue: One of the classes that changed the most -- but without any fundamental class changes. Mutilate brought a whole new vibe, same with shadowstep/cheat death.
---
Shaman: Well - alliance got them. Enhance became viable (albeit 2nd tier). Resto became top tier ez-mode with earth shield, chain heal and infinite mana. 
---
Warlock: Class fantasy fleshed out a bit more with all specs being pretty viable. shadow destro became so good by tier 6 it should have been illegal. Felguard, UA - introduced in BC.
---
Warrior: All specs became more fleshed out, and warriors were still the best dps and tanks most of the time. At this time, you could still rotate shamans into the melee group for windfury and hero so dps wars could be perma-heroism'd nuking stuff. BC brought imp MS, Rampage, devastate and other QoL improvements for prot.
---
The fines rarely ever have to be paid because this and other aspects of the guild promote strict accountability for everyone's time. Again, we don't care *why* you are late, only that you are and the effect that has on the rest of the team. Do it enough and you'll find yourself needing to leave the guild without our intervention because the rules you agreed to before joining won't allow you to get raid invites or loot when you do get an invite. Every aspect of these rules were negotiated and agreed upon by the raid team, the leadership has very little to do with it. And we are by no means "shit-tier".
---
Yes! Great stuff.
---
Spot on
---
4 I think.
---
Bish better drop my cloak this time.
---
Hunter is the easiest of the three to raid gear.  On alliance side they don't have to share loot with shamans and they don't have to compete as much as mages / paladins for people wanting same loot (minus a few pieces).  Hunter tier set is good in pvp and should be easy to obtain.
---
I never claimed I knew anything other than you were wrong, because you claimed you knew for a **fact** it wasn’t coming until the 13th, which you fucking don’t. All I claimed is that a realm list was coming prior to launch and mentioned in the same breath as name reservations would make any sane human being assume the two were connected. 
---
So I’m not taking an L because at best we’re both fucking wrong and you’re just getting in a pissing match about it.
---
No way what a legend
---
Big agree
---
...or any deep discussion on existentialism.
---
It's not cheap/easy to level up, but you can make good gold w/disenchanting and with higher end enchants.
---
Mini... I hate it.
---
I liked the transition in vanilla of thinking rank 14 were amazing skilled players then to towards the end where you just kinda felt sorry for people that played so much they got vitamin d deficiency, and then for the ultimate humiliation TBC came out and some rank 14ers still played 10 hours a day but couldn't crack duelist.
---
Feral's can ot raids just find and MT on some encounters.  They have form swap to do good dps while not needed to tank.  They can farm well and are good in pvp.  They are very easy to gear since their loot is random and you won't have to respec.
---
You aren’t wrong.
---
Yea i made a 28 minute video on youtube and this pretty much sums it up.
---
Oh yeah thats right, even levels. A rogue gets it starting level 1 though which is definitely a boost on a fresh server. Having to cast wrath for 3 levels can make it go really slow. Also, druids have to drink up for mana and rogues dont so that also puts rogues more in favor as well.
---
There's a cheat code to get infinite gold. It's 16 digits plus another 4 plus another 3 and is unique to every person. You enter it on one of several websites and a few hours later, you receive however much gold you want.
---
We used to have a guild membership fee and would provide free enchants and all standard consumables.
---
We were a pretty casual guild, and not everyone came to raids prepared. It was easier to collect gold and have one of the officers show up to raids with 200 mana pots than verify that everyone was bringing their own.
---
Alchemists could donate pots instead of paying the fee.
---
Plus, we were always short on tanks and healers, and "All the mana pots you can drink" and "Free repair bills" was a pretty good recruitment tool.
---
My server had a horde Druid named ferro who eventually I believe made high warlord. I wasn’t on his side though. I was alliance grinding to FM. His team always the team I looked forward to facing, particularly in wsg. And we used to have our mage spec Pom pyro to deal with particularly him.
---
That countdown aligns with August 13th by my watch... so no it hasn’t changed as far as I know!
---
When in doudt, diacritics.
---
This guys really sums up shadowpriest.  [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHwAN2i59i\_DeVD1b1edBMw](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHwAN2i59i_DeVD1b1edBMw)
---
I am an Anthony from Russia. Please go fuck yourself my dude :)
---
Priest in my guild got to rank 14.   Two people played the account almost 24/7 for weeks.   Quit the game after soon after hitting 14.
---
Nope he's just a reddit meme.
---
It was just a cool mount back then &amp; it was fast farming.  Having black temple gear was a way cooler &amp; we'd sell that too if you could zone in.
---
After everyone in guild got one we sold 2 or 3 most weeks, it was the easiest money in game for us since it only took 9 players.
---
Most rank 14’ers I knew still did well in arena. I mean there was some awful ones no doubt. But you don’t do something 12-14 hours a day without eventually learning some things.
---
People often forget in many instances of wow history the difference between upper duelist and gladiator was /played time as well. Average teams could break into glad simply by grinding their face into a wall or running cheese teams. My ele shaman got glad in wotlk running wizard cleave and I absolutely do not think I’m very good at this game at all. We just spam qued and had some lucky match ups.
---
Gonna make a PvP server our RP bitch if Blizz doesn't make a RP-PvP server.
---
Would you say that playing fire is like playing with fire?  ;)
---
There are full plate pre raid healing sets that will help you for pvp, they just aren't as pve efficient.
---
reddit polls
---
Some guilds might, but probably not.   
---
The thing is about classic vs retail is raids drop high end crafting materials, patterns and BoEs. This was pretty much, at least for my guild, always given to the guild bank, then they would usually sell them and buy materials and pay for tank respecs. Flasks because they were actually pretty expensive for the average raider and warriors needing to swap around from prot for high end PvE and then arms for pretty much all other content added up really fast at 50G a respec or whatever it was. 
---
Just as an example, I remember when our guild leadership decided to offload our stockpile of Sulfuron Ingots. We had only got 1 Eye to drop, MC was turning into chore where 40 people would show up semi afk and the only boss worth anything was Rag and we knew that the next raid was coming eventually. From that sale the guild was able to stock up on a mountain of flasks etc.   
---
The "raid tax" I believe used to be a meme thrown around, most guilds just expected you to buy your own consumables for your class yourself,
---
but what about all them sweet quest greens/replacments to DE while leveling up?
---
Any of Stefon's midget joke names (SNL) would also be acceptable!
---
F
---
My guildmaster got the mount back in vanilla, human warrior. Shout out to Kigdom on Terenas EU!
---
So, your name was The, and after the Everquest server merge, they just tacked the X on there....eh?
---
You're assuming the gold goes directly to the GM for personal use. People make gbanks for their guilds, usually to hold pots/flasks, crafted gear, mats for enchants etc. things that players, mostly raiders, will need. Generally people would just donate gold or mats to help out but some guilds had/have a tax system.
---
You are wrong. You are doing it all the way to 60 in dongeons if you want to be mana efficient. Even not in dongeons. You don't full rank heal yourself if you only lost a quarter of your life. Same for your target.
---
Saco is a slur for ballsack is portuguese
---
Blizzard would ban that shit in an hour.
---
Nightpain - UD Rogue ofc :P
---
I’m Brad and I love Jamaica so my name is Thex.

My name is Joana the troll level 60, so you can call me Thex.

Better Jousa than Messa.

---
&gt;Platinum needs more love. Crazy good production on his vids!
---
Yeah, the zone flows well together for sure. And I never needed Silverpine either, but that’s why I wanna make a point to hit it up this time. I was in such a hurry to see the next zone and get on to 60 when I leveled in vanilla that I wanna make sure to see more of the world this time, even if it’s sub-optimal
---
Fuck me, that guy either feels like the god of this sub now, or he's never setting foot here again.
---
I know what the purpose of a guild bank is, its being mismanaged if you have to collect gold from players.
---
Wow, there is some cool alpha stuff in here
---
Well, in our raid group we had up to 8 shamans with 0-2 druids and 1-3 priests as healers... but there were times when 1-2 shamans was max... It's a popular class but it's often played for very specific content - PvP, farming, twink, etc and thus popularity in a chart may not reflect popularity withing specific part of the game.
---
I played a shaman on the unofficial vanilla and I'm not going shaman as my main in Classic - going mage for extra fun factor. Druid as likely alt (or shaman if really needed). AoE farming or in general fun DPS is something I want to get. Compared to retail and pserver experience - I want a fun class for the open world. Shaman is lacking a bit in that aspect for me (healer on retail and went healer in vanilla, herb/alchemy/fishing/savior of leveling toons in the open world outside of raids)
---
Uff many.. but the top 4 i remember; a human ret Paladin and a rogue terrorizing XR. The paladin seemed unkillable and the freakin rogue also (running away, vanishing)
---
On horde side, think it was the servers first r14, a orc enhanc shaman. Never saw him do bgs or dueling, i think he reached his goal and got bored. He eventually specced resto and went full pve, never again to use his 2H weapon.
---
And then there was this orc warrior. I actually ranked with him, i stopped at rank 11 but saw him reach his dream a few months before TBC. He was a beast and almost unbeatable in a duel lol. And a really nice guy on top of that.
---
Chan.
---
I don't like this but it's a name at least
---
Not disagreeing to that fact but the world feels bigger.
---
I certainly feel like I was a member of the horde in the barrens vs a game I compared like League of legends. 
---
Think there is a reasonable ground for sure, though!
---
I am inexplicably torn between priest and mage. I’ll likely be playing without friends majority of the time, so desirability does play some sort of a role for me.
---
big oof
---
It's not a big deal at all since rogues get 5 weapon skill from talents.  You will do 1-2% less damage on average but you will often beat humans with equal gear, its that close.  In pvp weapon the game treats you as having max weapon skill so at 60 it will consider you as 300/300 not 305 in pvp.  Barely better in pve and doesn't do shit in pvp (lolperception).  Sword gnomes are fine in pve
---
Leveling: a steady pace, a free mount and enchanting/tailoring
---
Cap: Mara runs. AH the mats.
---
Locks can solo it easy greens as sm/ruin
---
A few minor corrections. Not all Alliance faction quests give spillover rep to the other three factions. None of the Elwynn Forest/Dun Morogh quests give Darnassus spillover rep. Also, a few quests later on also do not give spillover rep.
---
And with regards to spillover stopping at Revered, in the Beta, I made it to 6,469/21,000 Revered with Stormwind and 3,715/21,000 Revered with Darnassus and spillover rep did not stop after hitting revered with either.
---
According to Patch 1.7: “Reputation gains given to a player on the Alliance, Horde, or Steamwheedle Cartel factions directly will now cascade down to member factions through the middle of the Exalted reputation level.”
---
&gt;I can't tell if you're making fun of OP, making fun of yourself, or referencing the post.
---
Yes
---
Yo, I'm Crad.
---
Because semi-casual guilds don't except their main tanks to be masochists. It's pretty hard to farm and constant respecs eat so much gold just like higher repairs do too. Also flasks are basically mandatory unlike on other roles. They are often also used to buy important things for the guild like certain boe items, formulas etc.
---
Maap?
---
Joho the Tauren Warrior on Magtheridon US. He was rich from the Arcanite Reaper recipe and always had pocket heals to crush BGs. 
---
He was my inspiration for making a Warrior alt, eventually I got R14 on my Warrior, but that was from RBGs in Cataclysm. I recruited/led a team, flag carried CTF and arms crushed other BGs.
---
I mean, servers now are just virtualizations on a big server farm. All it takes for Blizz to make an RP-PVP server is to allocate some of the total server resources to have one.
---
It's probably a drop in the bucket to add 1 RP PVP server versus the glut of PVE/PVP servers.
---
Haha, I'm sure people will take well to it!
---
Going to check out these Mara runs everyone talks about
---
Entendí esta oración.
---
Yes, you're right!!!!
---
Any sane person would assume the two were connected!!
---
Thank you for admitting you're in fact NOT sane.
---
If they were planning on releasing them before the name reservation then they would have specified that it's coming out before said reservations and not before launch.
---
The entire community has been asking Blizzard about this exact subject and they've been getting the same answer. The same answer you have.
---
Also, yes you 100% without a doubt and scroll up if you need to DID claim to know. 
---
You said "After further research" that I'm wrong and it is coming out prior to 8/13. 
---
I'm done talking because you're either trolling me and I'm too lazy to notice or you're actually NOT sane and can't even keep track of your own bullshit.
---
Seriously scroll up and read your "After further research" comment because that's the only thing I'm arguing with you on, and I've already proven (with your own source) that you're wrong and made an assumption and peddled it as a fact.
---
Over.
---
Sex but with a lisp....Thex
---
Can't tell if trolling or you just have no idea what you're talking about.  If you can find me one video of an ele or enh shaman topping the dps meters of an equally geared raid group I'll give you gold.
---
Edit: in vanilla of course
---
It's the name kids love!!
---
To preface this I mostly expect to pvp, but I might do a bit of casual raiding on the side. So I haven't played WoW in a while, but when I did play my favorite class was blood DK DPS during wrath. I really liked its ability to self-sustain while still dealing respectable damage. I'm not necessarily looking to one-shot people or anything, I'm looking to be that guy who's hard to kill but who you can't really afford to ignore and let run wild if that makes any sense.
---
So far the most fitting options seem to be dwarf paladin, undead warlock, or Tauren warrior.  Paladin seems to have pretty good staying power but I'm worried that even if I'm able to get around to the back line and start wailing on casters I won't be enough of a threat for them to actually do anything. Warrior sounds like it has the opposite problem; if they can get to the back line it seems like they can easily cause enough problems to get people to do something about it, but without other players heals or dispels it seems unlikely that they would ever get that chance. Warlock *sounds* like a good mix between the two, but I've never played a caster before so I don't know if that playstyle is going to click with me. I'm also a bit concerned about their survivability. Are they genuinely tanky or just tanky compared to other cloth wearers?
---
Except you dont start with 5 food and 5 water. that is a private server thing. You can however kill a mob or 2 and sell some grays. [Link](https://youtu.be/kCGy5ZIowhI?t=1466) here to a video if you want to look more into it.
---
I’ll see you gentlemen in Goldshire.
---
Teach my kids to fish
---
What expansion are  you talking about there?
---
Just gettinng the Blue PvP set took a silly amount of time in 2005.
---
That'd be some *next level* account sharing. 
---
Blizz: "Are you sharing your account with a friend?"
---
Me: "Uh, no."
---
Blizz: "Are you sharing your account with 20,000 friends?"
---
Me: "Uh, yes."
---
My name is Andrew and my favorite country is Malaysia so I guess Anal is my wow name.
---
(~1 month before WoW Classic)
---
Can you name one reason why you would force yourself to only wear plate gear?
---
Jaam, sounds stupid.... if I go with second favorite country, it's Jaer, which also sounds stupid. I'm just gonna go by Thex, instead.
---
Second account with AH mule and 9 alts camped at limited spawn vendors.
---
gold making with 0 real impact on my main toon, who can also farm DME once it's out.
---
Why make a survey that requires a google login?
---
Kinda. The mechanics of the class and the versatility sound appealing, but the class fantasy/flavor doesn't really do it for me at all really.
---
KAOL HERE
---
I got a LG 27uk650-W and it on 1600 hour use so far and no problems. Its a 4k 99% sRGB IPS and free sync 60hz panel for around $400. So if your on a budget and 4k is a must i highly recommend  it.
---
You keep saying what you fear so I’d say play warlock.
---
yeah I don't mind helping people get things they actually need if I'm better equipped to help than others, but just a blanket "tax" sounds like some people are gaining a lot more than others.
---
...
---
There was some guy making a thread about how you can choose your name for classic wow (first letter of the rl name then the second and third letter of your favourite country and then the second letter of the first name (theodore and mexico if I remember right)) Then there came some dude on hot with a meme about this post and I couldnt resist :)
---
Why not just open new content for classic, that would be more fun and interesting. We already know what to expect with the expansions. Plus, where do we stop on the expansion route? It doesn’t make any since to just stop after wrath, because where do we go next? If it’s to create new content after wrath, why not just do that originally once Classic is maxed out?
---
I loved TBC and Wrath, but I think it would be so much fun to have new content related to classic. There’s much opportunity. A quick example would be like a furbolg dungeon in Felwood
---
Ahhhh Ad Hominem, the final desperate act of someone who's been called out.
---
I'm rocking my sleeping son in a home I own thanks to a good career. When you know how to read wonderful things will happen to you, "sport".
---
Exactly. This is a social game and all classes are expected to contribute their class utility to the group.
---
Well paladins primarily heal and warriors obviously don’t. Night and day. If you’re planning to pvp as ret you’re gonna feel gimped no matter what.
---
The fact that someone as petty as you birthed offspring is truly terrifying.
---
It would be terribly inefficient, and excellent free marketing for Blizzard. They would be fools to ban it. 
---
If I were trying to make it happen, I would contact Blizzard first though.
---
Thanks!
---
Shh the less people that know our annoying BS
---
the better. They can win in raids and we can be annoying on WPVP :P
---
EULA aside I don't think this is possible with a rich  mouse-pointer based UI anyway. You could do Twitch Plays with controller based games because there is a set finite amount of different inputs to be received.
---
But something with such an elaborate UI as World of Warcraft? Nope. You could map all your key bindings and movement and macros just fine, I've had friends use a programmed 360 controller to do Naxx before, but they would inevitably have to reach for their mouse to do something.
---
Going to be much easier on Classic as well. Lower hp and agro radius on beta. 👍
---
I definitely like the sound of the mechanics of the class, but the flavor of it just doesn't really appeal to me at all. I'm not opposed or anything, I just can't really seem get excited about druids for some reason.
---
It's petty to correct false information? Sure, whatever you say.
---
I mean....its always being collected from players. The difference is whether you ask them to mail stuff to the bank or not. I agree you shouldn't tax your guild members. You just seemed to assume that in a situation where there is a guild tax that the GM just keeps it all.
---
From listening to an interview with jeff kaplan who designed the classes in wow, they wanted the warrior’s movement to be conditional and to targets. Hence charge, intercept, and in bc intervene.
---
And as a mage, I'm not going to ask for a tip to open a portal for the group. At most I'd ask to cover the cost of the reagent.
---
The book about Arthas' rise to become the lich king was a good read, can recommend.
---
Can I speak to a manager? 
---
 Seems like something that'd come up during training.
---
Its a very safe assumption.
---
I can several but sure one is you want to play as a warrior. It feels more thematic and immersive.
---
They might be BM; they might have the Improved Mend Pet talent (dispels magic effects) even if they're not 31+ points deep into BM; and if neither of those things are true, he can just stall you until Hibernate wears off. It's going to take you a long time to kill them. You can't burst them down while their pet is slept.
---
My name is Bertel and favorite country is Italy. So mine is Beta, probably not gonna get that name in-game :)
---
Gold income increases naturally as you level. Just keep leveling like normal
---
Thank you.
---
Lmao. Good ol days
---
[removed]
---
Twitch plays in real time would be a whole new hell.
---
Pokemon at least was turn based.
---
Come along Bort.
---
How?
---
Rogues are the easiest to kill as warlock.
---
I also play warlock
---
You forgot Gnomer in the Dungeon Drops tab!
---
Seriously, though, amazing work!
---
This is not important but I look forward to reading this thread every week. Everyone’s flavor of the same dilemma is quite fun to read.
---
Just send the gold to the guild leader with the message. "Here is the gold you ordered $14.95 received with thanks. Thanks for using wowgoldex.com". Problem will solve itself.
---
Farm those enchanting plans, and sit in IF. Free money, no mats farming required.
---
Don't remember the R14s but I'll never forget Destromath's Horde Honor Contest winner.
---
"DAISH DAISH DAISH [Contest Winner's Tabard]"
---
I get what you’re saying, give people more time to enjoy the leveling process. Delaying MC and Ony won’t help. When the cap was raised to 40 in beta people rushed to get to cap in a day. It would likely take very aggressive time gating of the leveling itself to slow people down. Even then, there is efficient gold farming to consider. Some will rush, some will play inefficiently, some will level with specific groups. It’s all good, just let everyone do their thing.
---
haha
---
I've seen guilds raiding Naxx  with 11 warriors Haha
---
Oh believe me 90% of this sub more than likely would say that considering they had 5 SWP rolling on cthun, a ret pally, arms warriors, and full lock dots on him.
---
We had I think a rogue player named Rocklee that was a high warlord. Then he rolled a mage named Rockleetwo and got high warlord again. Back when i was 14 that seemed pretty awesome. Now as an adult I worry about his personal life!
---
Seus.  
---
  
---
Instant Cat In The Hat vibes.
---
My son's asleep, as I mentioned above....(Man you're really doubling down on the failing to read part)
---
I admited I'm only going off what was posted by Blizzard and the general consensus of the entire community.
---
You flat out said it was coming out before 8/13.
---
There's a HUGE DIFFERENCE THERE. Reddit isn't a good place to make statements like that. You're going to get called out and then you're going to react like you did and make an ass out of yourself.
---
The only superiority I hold over you is my reading and comprehension skills. You're the one that can't seem to stop indulging. I only brought up the kid and house AFTER you resorted to Ad Hominem, it's not like I brought it up out of the blue like I'm using it as some clout.....
---
Since this is clearly you just trolling me, because I refuse to believe anyone who can access the internet is THIS willfully ignorant I'm actually going to stop indulging.
---
Thanks. That section took many many hours to complete just for end game dungeons. Not masochistic enough to add the low level dungeons there too. lol
---
That's crazy, mine also is Thex
---
There isn’t
---
This is my secret! My guild only has me playing druid so far.. hoping I end up the only druid, showered in loot
---
Never knew this existed till now.  However looking at the pic, it screams to me....vanilla wow food
---
If you liked War of the Ancients I wouldn't avoid his work. General reviews seem favorable to comparable of his books within the overall Warcraft novel list. Of the 6 Warcraft novels I've read, his Day of the Dragon is the one I recommend the most.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
You can always find a negative 1 star review on Amazon. Cherry picking complaints doesn't make the general consensus on something terrible.
---
Thread about WoW celebrities reminded me of this video.  NSFW for some language.
---
Cool story, bro.
---
This is the second time in two days I’ve run in to this exact same conversation. I’m not eager to go through it again. 
---
It goes like this, guy A has zero experience with a class but is interested and has read or watched a ton of comments/streamer social media comments and believes he’s now an expert. 
---
And then there’s guy B that was there, played it, did it, had buddies that were balls deep, ranked up, basically the whole 9. Guy B’s experience doesn’t t match what guy A thinks things should play out and the shitstorm ensues, 
---
So, let’s just cut straight to the end bit, There will be a ton of people coming back to the game that never played p.servers, don’t care about a meta that comes from that there, and will still manage to kill it, many will do so using specs and methodologies that are ignored on p.server, just like back then,
---
I know you will disagree, and that’s ok because there really is no resolution so there’s no need to go down an insult firestorm. I’ll just make a small request, keep an open mind.
---
Dam..that's a little disappointing but at least I know now. If this is true, Staysafe should remove his video about getting Darnassus Exalted at 40. Thanks Shadow Panther.
---
It’s great and I too would like to hear more.
---
Yeah, I was just referring to MCP, given that it's BIS for kitty. I'm sure everyone knows that by now though.
---
A warlock with soullink has reduction on par with a plate user without a shield, and that reduction applies to magic damage as well.  
---
Non-SL locks are merely tanky compared to other cloth users.  
---
And then warlocks can gain some hp back via healthstone, death coil, siphon, and drain so if your opponent cannot burst you down you can self sustain almost forever.
---
Yea that's fair enought it is excerpts like having Rhonnin leading an army of raptors seems a bit silly to me I will eventually read his other works most likely as I am slowly working my way through all the Warcraft books but I can see why people might not recommend him as an author.
---
I prefer Corn Thex myself
---
Username.... doesn't check out..?
---
Ez, I got 3 in one run
---
Wouldn't it be possible to add extra questions for the hybrids, something like
---
"If you picked warrior on the class question, what will your main role be?"
---
You can opt of the rush to 60.
---
no, I meant viable, feel free to buy a dictionary.
---
Furthering this, is there a horde equivalent to the hilsbrad fields? Mobs that are allies with horde that horde players can have help kill alliance?
---
Don't forget the alt, Thexicant
---
\&gt;When the lack of new content on the sub makes the meta memes just right.
---
&gt; I think that that mentality is hard to resist for some, but ultimately hurts the game. World of Warcraft was about more than just farming raid gear. I think more players feel the need to rush through the leveling process this time around.
---
Well, that's just like - your opinion, man. 
---
Some folks will rush to 60, some won't. People will consume content at different speeds.
---
MC and Ony were there at release in vanilla, so it makes sense for them to be there in classic. And I don't think any content is trivialized. Folks will still be doing dungeons for weeks.
---
No one is getting more than a few items from raids in the first few weeks (albeit ony splits could change that dynamic slightly). So gear gaps will still need to be filled in with dungeons. And folks will need shards, mats, orbs, etc -- from dungeons -- for a long, long time.
---
Moving Ony and MC back just hurts folks who want to consume the content quickly, and goes against the spirit of nochanges. I don't see a need for it.
---
I understand the "fear of missing out" aspect of watching other folks rush to the endgame -- I expect I won't be 60 for at least three months. But gating their progress doesn't have much upside in my opinion.
---
Woosh
---
At the crossroads right?? I totally remember that guy!
---
Brou, 
---
Brad, South Africa lmao
---
No respecs
---
Twitch, run to the centre!
---
Fuck those losers.  When all you can do is try to shit on a PvP tournament to make a name for yourself, you don't deserve a name.  Trashgodx.
---
Nah, no point in any kind of nods, starting over is starting over and this is its own separate experience
---
I'm planning to multibox several classes to build a dungeon-farming dynamo of level 60s.
---
Warrior: Thux
---
Priest: Thyx
---
Mage: Thax
---
Druid: Thox
---
Hunter: Thix
---
Crossroads?
---
Thanks! Lots of tiny details, I knew I'd miss a few. Corrected now
---
I’m on a similar boat to you, maining my DK since Wrath, but I do actually enjoy DK’s current state. What do you hate so much about it? Frost in particular feels pretty similar in my experience to what it was during Legion (after the 8.2 buffs).
---
That being said, I’m probably going to use a Warlock for Classic, mostly because of the flavor (with DoTs and everything). I do, however, think that if you enjoy other aspects of the play style you might enjoy Warrior (for the melee fighter aspect) or maybe even Mage (for a good toolkit with lots of CC and utility, something I’ll absolutely miss). I’ll admit that a warrior has never filled any of my expectations, it just doesn’t feel the same.
---
I'm really thinking I want to Warrior Tank. 
---
Played a Rogue in Vanilla, Warlock ever since with a lot of Alts. Have tanked on one alt or another in every expansion since Wrath. 
---
I was an Officer in Vanilla, Raid Lead a few times and loved being the general on the field. 
---
I get that Warriors suck leveling, most expensive repair bills, eating/bandaging constantly but is it really that bad? Would it be easier if I was Tank the whole way and just grind Dungeons since I'm guessing Tanks will be in heavy LFM demand? 
---
I do have the benefit of not having too many life demands other than work. 
---
Also, I'm thinking Alch/Herb at endgame but should I be thinking Mining/BS while leveling or would I be crafting stuff not really worth it. 
---
Sorry, rambled a bit to get my point across, thanks in advance.
---
You would think people would realize lmao
---
Do rogue next!
---
It's weird what will take off from time to time...
---
I hate you
---
If anything they should add this in retail

---
Would you give hunters max pvp points?
---
&gt; Vanilla was a different animal entirely. Things like "the endgame" started earlier than hitting level 60. See, you could be level 60, and you were still not totally invincible in things like Scholomance, a difficult level 45-ish ~~10~~ 5-man dungeon even if you were level 60 - a full 15 levels higher. [Source - Vanilla Scholomance](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Scholomance_(original))  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; Some of us oldies can remember that instead of rather than "Whats your iLvl?", it was more about "Are you attuned?" and "Do you have fire resist gear? 
---
You should put in your disclaimer that you never actually played Vanilla WoW, at least not for any appreciable amount of time. You corrected your initial statement and it's STILL wrong. Scholomance wasn't level 45ish, it was level 55+, one of the main sources of pre-raid gear, and you claim to have raided in vanilla. I don't believe anyone would write an article like this for something outside personal gain when its clear they aren't close to the subject matter.
---
Sorry brother you fuggged up. No way ypure getting that name now.
---
Weird thex but okay
---
&gt;If I recall WoW releases were always 2 AM CDT on a Tuesday. 
---
It's 2019...  you read a blue post, didn't belive it, then came to an unofficial source to then believe?
---
Kk.
---
Honestly no idea, people are somehow still debating this and I'm not shaman expert.
---
&gt;If I recall WoW releases were always 2 AM CDT on a Tuesday.

---
I completely agree!  It doesn’t take min maxing to down raids it just takes a strong guild.   I just find it hilarious when people put their nose in the air when it comes to anything less than optimal as if it requires any of that.
---
If anything min/maxers in vanilla are the ones who are bad at the game if they truely require stacking a raid with the best possible comp and world buffs in order to raid.
---
what about gromgol/booty bay?
---
The pressure is only there if you choose to make the pressure a part of your experience.
---
Character creation becomes available at precisely " **Soon™** "
---
Well, if u think getting 60 and farming pre raid gear is no content then why will I still eed 4 months to get 60 and need 1 month to farm pre raid gear? :(
---
There’s corruption too though? But yeah fair enough.
---
Have you considered tauren at all? Warstomp is very good for shaman
---
I was addressing just hunter vs warrior.
---
But this is a good comparison which combo would provide more total damage. IDK.
---
Warriors will always get plate gear on Horde side since there are no Paladins to compete with.  
---
I think they'll be popular at first, but will quickly become more rare once people realize just how tedious it is to level one without funding.
---
I love everything about it!
---
What personal attacks? 
---
I said "good luck buddy"
---
And you replied with
---
&gt;You won't have any success at all.
---
Seems like you are the one insulting me.
---
I knew a Paladin Alliance side quite well when he was sub-60, pretty close friends, I was the first one to experience his new death ray as he leveled engineering. He started to PvP Hardcore for rank 14 and we lost touch. Nice guy, found him years later when I started playing again just at the end of Warlords expansion, I bonked him on the head and we got talking. He's pretty cool.
---
There was a Rank 14 Hunter Horde side who ended up getting Rank 12 solo and had begun usurping the standings of the premade PvP groups with PuGs. He ended up being enlisted by the premade group simply because they needed him to chill out a little. He was a legend on our server for his sheer tenacity, but absolutely the nicest guy. He held High Warlord for a couple of weeks simply because he wanted to keep doing BGs. He still plays, never stopped, I've been in his guild since Classic.
---
Most of the other Rank 14s I knew quit the game shortly after their grind, or just as Burning Crusade dropped.
---
Really great work. I plan on going druid and mage, and now I have a supersheet for each.
---
I'd like to hear people's thoughts on the 2/2 Blood Frenzy in the NS/Hotw build. I feel like something else must be better. Only time you're in cat is for the opener basically, and usually with a pounce, so that can't crit. Then you'd probably use rake and then rip and no more cat unless you get to restealth. So this means, it will only work when you crit, and generally only with your one rake per opener. All of this for one combo point.
---
Putting one more point to max out your stealth/threat level seems better, or maybe 2/2 shred. That would allow you to, if using energy ticks properly, let you open on clothies with tiger's fury, ravage and then shred for optimal burst, leaving you with 2 energy left to then go out of cat form.
---
Alternatively, 2/2 primal fury seems more useful as well, as you'll be spending a lot more time in bear form than cat form for pvp, and probably pve as well.
---
Thoughts?
---
I was agreeing :P
---
Nice.... For my guild it was always that last tank swap for the last few percentage that we had trouble with when BWL was new. All the changes later in Vanilla made it so much easier, but in the beginning, getting the tanks to seamlessly pass off threat to the next plagued us haaard.
---
Gonna feel bad for the real Thex when he doesn't get his name
---
In all seriousness I hope Thex the Shaman gets his name.
---
Fake post, Thex always has mount at 40
---
Scrolling down here was like a solid 4 point Kidney Shot
---
 No one else thinks about Thex dagger from classic eq eh?  Did you even have a goddamn resist set for Hoshkar?!
---
I'm not belitting him or "reaching out to find something negative" I'm just legitimately curious about how his guild his guild thinks this is a genuinely good idea. He says he guild has experience of it working and said 
---
&gt;You won't have any success at all
---
I reply with some success I've had and asks him what guild he's in and then he gets defensive and won't even tell me what guild he plays in. I don't mind that but don't come here telling me I'm the one trying to belittle lol
---
Here's quick reasons why:
---
A) Developing new actual content takes a lot of time and money, releasing TBC takes relatively little.
---
B) Developing new actual content is always a risk. You cannot know in advance if this is something people enjoy. Everyone knows what TBC or Wrath is, lots of people enjoyed it. Success is as guarenteed as classic is.
---
Where to stop, well that's a good question, both tbc and wrath will be easy money. At that point we are like 5+ years down the line, do you really think wow will exist doing that time? Sounds like a good timeline for entire wow to be over with and blizzard finally creating something original, or just giving up on MMORPG.
---
Haha awesome. The posts today really brought it all together. Cheers have a great classic wow rebirth! Perhaps I’ll see you in contested lands...likely to be a dwarf priest Rokhaz or Harpua
---
Oh boi oh boi, another big ass post with little to no actual knowledge of the game just trying to make that money of classics hype. 
---
What a surprise, thank god you did the leg work for me so I didn't have to read whatever this crap is.
---
It doesn't make sense but I got Thex as well.  I'm also rolling a shaman even though I'm rolling a paladin.  Thex the Shaman.
---
Pretty fucking hilarious, thanks for sharing.
---
Probable the funniest meme in the past year  😂
---
&gt; I get that Warriors suck leveling,
---
Depends. They are gear dependent so not having updated gear for your level will be noticeable. The transition from the starter zone to 10-20 content will be the most difficult part. 
---
This can be mitigated by having a leveling partner and checking the AH. Checking the AH is a solid option because a lot of players will be around your level and they'll have greens on the AH in large numbers. This means the price will be relatively cheap because a huge increase in supply will outweigh the demand. This is how it was when beta first started. 
---
&gt; most expensive repair bills
---
Eh, yea to a degree.
---
&gt; eating/bandaging constantly but is it really that bad? 
---
Most players will be needing to use bandages and eat. This is mitigated with a leveling partner. 
---
&gt; Also, I'm thinking Alch/Herb at endgame but should I be thinking Mining/BS while leveling or would I be crafting stuff not really worth it.
---
Gathering professions might be worth it, but how many people are thinking of the same thing you are? ;D It's possible that the market could get flooded with crafting materials which will drive the cost down significantly. 
---
Then again, crafting professions are always difficult to level since they can often be very cost prohibited and you won't have the money.
---
Trying to cure my stupidity :P
---
ty :)
---
This raises a good point. Need a horde guild named Thex and have it full of shm. Every raid punish all the non Thex named members in the Thex guild
---
Fury PVP
---
Would definitely be interested. I cant promise I will be there opening day - currently saving up for a decent laptop to run it on
---
I love how people think sugar isn’t s drug.
---
Not sure we could fit that for every class, but we'll definetly cover it for priest (as they actually get different spells)
---
We could do a standalone one for the different races and pros/cons for them in general though!
---
Not Thex but it is an amazing name
---
Or if you’re Alliance you send in a Pally with bubble. Play horde if you want more challenging end game content.
---
Every now and then I find myself with one of Cranius's songs stuck in my head. It's weird how stuff like that sticks with you.
---
Yeah, he was a tauren warrior, and he was a miserable prick. He and his friends ruined BG's for both factions on the server before cross-realm BG's were implemented.
---
I'm sure you'll make a fine opponent. We may be enemies, but we are all part of this great community.
---
Strength and honor, friend!
---
That's my take. God i hope they some insider insight and aren't extrapolating classic playerbase estimations based on retail subscriptions. 
---
Servers will implode.
---
Literally never noticed the "shit running animations" go spout that meme elsewhere.
---
One of the main reasons I'm rolling a Shaman first honestly - gather a whole bunch of gold along the way to pump into the two "Executioner's" weapons, gear, potions, bandages, etc.  I've leveled my fair share of Warriors to know that it's an infinitely easier and more enjoyable task when you have a good beating stick.
---
Some guy made a post about character creation, and mentioned the name he wanted in the post, and then everyone now wants to make it as a name. It's like someone who wants to reserve a names worst nightmare lol
---
That's amazing.
---
Some guy made a post about what name will you choose to reserve and he announced he was picking Thex. Add in a meme community and this is what you get, he later realized announcing his name was foolish but it was too late
---
We love you OG Thex
---
Not always.  Only if you are sm ruin, and because debuff slots are limited, depending on your raid comp you may have to fight others for that spot.  Others will be DS, and although it gets 5% more shadow damage, it's generally a worse balanced spec if you also want to PVP.
---
Even so, corruption is once every 18 seconds I think?
---
Kargath during raid times maybe.
---
maybe STV Grom'gol
---
other than those 2. i don't think there are any Thex else
---
Stonetalon mountains. Horde have to walk all the way up the mountain if you kill them while they're questing in the dryad area, which has a shitload of alliance mobs they have to fight for quests
---
Someone is always going to be late for the train, cant wait forever.
---
I'm sure plenty of new players were getting pissed at the "horde" that roam around Loch Modan as well.
---
Yes, a couple of months is most likely two and anyone that says otherwise is just talking out their ass.
---
For the same reason they ban all bots.
---
Discord? I used to play on LB in the early days.
---
Your melee doesn't stop working when you respec elemental and it's still strong. I leveled 1-42 on a private server recently as elemental and it plays the same except you cast a bit more but as with enhance you front load your spells to take advantage of mana regen. I had leveled 1-40 as enhance before that and they played out pretty similarly.
---
Just get the gold while you level. You should have the gold at or around 40 but usually at 40.
---
Entertaining lol
---
Weird way to pronounce Thex but ok..
---
Came here to say this.  :D
---
Appreciate the feedback, you must be an absolute blast to be around.
---
Aye, i just finished chapter 1. I have an autographed copy that's been sitting on my shelf for a few years. Definitely gonna finish it now.
---
yeah i agree but i cant get into the feel of a female lol just dont feel connected. i plan on getting my epic mount phase 1 so ill be riding a badass wolf not a badass horse. well only while i dont have my epic mount and i have some nice farming ideas up my sleeve

Sorry to hear that friendo ;c

Thanks! I mean Thex!
---
I believe rogue and night elves could drop combat and mount.
---
I also know several classes that could pop a CC, run, and mount.
---
Flying combat was meant to be in the game, but bliz never implemented it. Even if there were threats in the air, I still think that being able to go over a mountain, a forest, or a sea, removes all sense of adventure from the game.
---
BB is often just a slug fest 24/7, and grom gol is often heavily populated with both leveling and high level players anyway.  Not quite the same.

Classic WoW ESRB Rating has just been released:
---
Thanks for the reminder dude
---
I loved/hated 40 man raids, played as a prot warrior most of the time. Tanking the pups on golemagg, and playing the poker mod that was out back in the day.
---
&gt;Yes, a couple of months is most likely two and anyone that says otherwise is just talking out their ass
---
A couple isn't just defined as two. Various dictionaries define a couple as 
---
&gt;: an indefinite small number
---
&gt;two or a few things that are similar or the same, or two or a few people who are in some way connected:
---
&gt;couple (of something) a small number of people or things
---
Idk if you are unaware of how english works, but a couple does not just mean two, it very often is just used to say a few. 
---
Also BWL was NOT released 5 months after EU launch.
---
Vanilla was released for EU on december 6th 2004, and BWL came out july 12nd, 2005., that's 7 months.
---
Thing you gotta realize is wow was not the first mmo.  People who raided and figured all the shit out for the first time weren't a bunch of 12yr olds who knew nothing.  The first people in there endgame were likely hardcore players that had been there and done that in other games.  The encounters will still be difficult enough even if everyone knows the mechanics.
---
&gt; and dps will especially have issues because they have to compete with the most common tank for dungeons gearwise!
---
Just be the tank, no matter your spec you'll be fine with a decent sword+board.
---
Lmao someone else mentioned Lard the druid in one of the comments...I used to play on Frostmane too great server
---
I see, someone made a rookie mistake hahaha
---
Do you think dungeon cleave groups will be more popular.  The player base is knowledgeable, more organized and the meta refined now compared to 2005.
---
It feels grueling but just not as bad as it was back in the day.
---
Rogue and Hunter would be greatly appreciated!
---
Frostmane vet reporting in, gnome rogue gank squad. Idk how to pick a new server for classic
---
Who is Thex?
---
High IQ Blizzard not advertising the game means less people showing up for August 13th early character-creation.
---
Desp(acito)!!
---
I'm chuckling at a lot of these threads. People have such unrealistic expectations thinking the content is going to get steam rolled just because it's really old. 
---
When you spend an hour killing 100 tigers to get 4 furs, or doing the same dungeon 10x to get one piece of gear that either doesn't drop, or you keep losing the roll for, the reality of how the grind is going to hit people in the face like a truck.
---
That's gonna be one hell of a challenge to find dedicated players but who are also inexperienced with the game. 
---
Best of luck to you my dude, I completely understand why you want this, but it sure won't be easy to find.

Daan.... So just my name with another 'a'... Cool
---
Yeah, that's where I stopped reading.

Please don't take my name guys.
---
This is the accurate data. From beta tested on thousands of +3 mobs (all credit to the savants on the warrior discord). The 10 represents 305 the "cap" is 308 with benefits past that being negligible.
---
BOO... THX 1138 would like a word.
---
Try Warcraft online! Rated T for Thex.
---
It's such a weird time in BGs as a Holy/Reck paladin.  If people see you healing and using blessings it's ALL in on the paladin, but if you attacking people without anyone attacking you it's kinda hopeless.  
---
My favorite though is getting opened up on by rogues and you can just go bake a cake and come back and then stun them and reckoning them dust.
---
It's not exciting, but grinding mobs and selling the runecloth is always a decent income.  Plus if you are on a PvP server, you can always assert your dominance over a particular grinding spot.  (EPL)  I always love getting a mining rotating going.  Learning the spawn timing and just generally shooting the shit with guildmates.
---
Joee, hmmm.
---
[deleted]
---
Love it.
---
Lmao, no. OCD mount collectors should stay in retail.
---
You would need two of them, one Horde, one Alliance, on a PVP server so Twitch could fight itself.
---
A lot in later vanilla. It’s not like people weren’t aware that plate wearing warriors were gimped in retail vanilla.
---
Most of the things you listed didn’t come from pservers but actually vanilla itself.
---
i was thinking about it but that sooorta falls under a similar umbrella to leveling, so i figure'd we'd put it as a note for hunter/mage since they are exceptionally good at it.
---
Troxxed on illidan.
---
Yes, I need to know how my Troll Shaman Thex holds up.
---
Everyone who knows the meme should put thex somewhere in their character name. That way it gradually sinks into classic and instead of everyone wondering why all the night elf hunters are named some variation of Legolas, it's Thex.
---
I can smell the entitlement from here. You don’t pay to be on reddit lmao
---
Wiping isn't exactly the goal :p
---
The majority opinion is that his writing is bad. I also think that in those days, Blizzard gave their licensed authors too much free reign to fuck with the lore and Knaak abused it to create some really awful character stories, like Rhonin and Vereesa.
---
U okay mate?
---
That music is fucking stellar though.  I love Safety Dance
---
He’s rumored to be TheLegend27.
---
M E T A
---
That sounds awful. No thanks.
---
Keeping the level cap at 60 still invalidates old-world content because a lot of gear from TBC is just better itemized, even with a squish. In Classic you can't even put together a cohesive DPS plate set until the end of AQ40 because gloves don't exist, for example.
---
If they ever go back and do a TBC in the theme of classic, the struggle needs to be real. Heroic dungeons shouldn't exist, and Karazhan should be used to "round out" the missing drops as rare gear, not the crazy power spiking loot pinata it was.
---
TBC, gameplay wise, was a great progression of WoW as a game. All of the downsides came from over-inflation of player power, and the whole "go on the offensive" angle made very little sense lore-wise.
---
Those alpha human hairstyles are so brilliant looking shame they didn't make it in the base game.
---
Lol, the "Nice day for a memorial." and "Guess you could say that." part always gets me.
---
Grenades from engineering aren't "instant" and I believe share a cooldown with a lot of other engineering items, but you can move while you are "casting" so not too bad to throw them out there every once in awhile.
---
Not sure they need two tabs, but definitely needs something more than a drop down menu. Extremely easy to overlook at the moment.
---
Sounds like a dick but could he actually be a good Raid leader? He's describing what to do play by play, and then calls out the peeps who are out of position. Not his first time running this raid and he has a lot of people that expect him to guide the casuals along the way. Much respect to this sir +50 dkp
---
Nice
---
Ha! We'll call this plan B.

So whose making Conjured Arizona Iced Teas and Chopped cheese for the raid?

Sure.
---
Pwned.
---
Do you have a video/screenshot from 1.12 showing Edgies granting 2h Swords skill? The recent beta could also provide a data point w/ Expert Goldminer's Helmet; we'd expect a Two-Handed Axes bonus to follow if the wording is consistent. I'm pretty sure you're wrong about the bonus applying to differently named weapon skills.
---
I just equipped a pair and didn't get any Two-Handed Swords bonus, but obviously it's not an official source.
---
Collecting mounts became a sub tab of the game. But earning a mount like I.e. netherwing drake took time and effort
---
I don't know if I agree or disagree on which talents are better, but they are all in the same tree, I was comparing resto to the other specs mentioned for leveling which I assume don't frontload points in resto first.
---
First time I ever watched someone become famous. Use your powers for good or whatever
---
So cute!! Do rogue next!!
---
If this is Blizzard's logic they are such idiots.  I quit a long time ago because I don't like the retail version, because it's more of an action game than an RPG.  The only reason I'm coming back is due to classic and it seems like many people feel this way.  I can't imagine people saying "boy I love world pvp and the community and grinding of classic, let me just jump right into retail!"
---
be glad your name  isnt trevor.
---
First time I ever killed rag. All tanks dead, all healers dead, dwarf rogue named Caedorn evasion tanking and those left alive somehow got him down. September 2005.
---
It's like a giant bug zapper.
---
Gotcha. But they could be used to level bs right? So there's... Sort of a reason to make them?
---
Sp33k l33t?
---
It's dumb. Don't bother yourself with it.
---
Took me like 30 runs to get that shit on a PServer. It dropped like 4 times but I kept losing the roll.
---
No worries! Glad to help.
---
I always thought it was written Krushym
---
It doesn't matter if there's a contingent of players that would never play Retail no matter what changes are made to it. There will be some that do convert in the future and bundling the games together helps maximize that potential.
---
Lots to consider, for example setup, top damage possible, time required to deal the damage. If you are talking about a seduce soulfire immo conflag burn fine that may be the highest damage (I bet a mage hits higher), but when you ask me who is the best burst class I always think elemental shaman or rogue, they can do it consistently and in 3.5 seconds or less.
---
OOL. Care to explain the joke anyone?
---
Wtf do you think alts that farm do differently than your main that farms?
---
If you want gold and can't do aoe farms or tribute runs because you're not a hunter... gather, fish, craft...
---
The saddest part is how many Rank 14s quit the game.  It's this amazing insanely difficult accomplishment, but then it burns people out.
---
Priest is fine in Phase 2 farming DME Lashers.
---
I like the new races in game. I typically would play as dranai (too lazy to look up spelling) and worgen, and while i wish i could play those races in classic its a worthwhile sacrifice
---
Haha yeah clicker as well on an old gateway pc monitor. Those were the days
---
All your Thex are belong to us.
---
I don't play Call of Duty so I can't really say why they should be on separate tabs. If they're essentially the same game then maybe they should be grouped in to a single tab with various "expansions" that are selectable under that common CoD tab?
---
If they are significantly different then I guess the argument is that it would be like putting Starcraft and Warcraft on to the same tab because they're both blizzard RTS's. While gameplay similarities is a valid way to to categorise a tab, they take place in completely different settings. This isn't the case with WoW. Classic and BFA while certainly different games, share a lot of common ground.
---
Then you forgo the opportunity to gather end-game enchanting recipes. If I go enchanting, I’ll shoot to be one of “the enchanters” on my server.  Take human and farm all the reputation enchants first, then go for the dungeon/raid drops.
---
Bad leadership
---
Well, yeah. And once you’ve got them, you might as well use them. Once they’re gone, though, you don’t really have a reason to make more.
---
It was probably just an issue that they werent at max dots even. He says 2 rows. I think he is running a group which isnt maximizing their dots efficiently.
---
NOMEGALUL
---
Lock
---
Lol fuck that. I'm forming a cult.
---
If they release TBC with no changes, I’d lose all faith in blizzard. These legacy servers in my eyes would simply be a quick grab for subscriptions, all while they try and redesign their retail vision to appeal to classic fans. Which will most likely fail. Or perhaps this is all to buy time for a new mmorpg they will release.
---
People just put so much emphasis on farming DME and princess runs for Gold, it seems stupid not to do. But people have told me in nicer and fewer words that the farming alt is a bad idea, as it won’t make a major difference overall.
---
It's an easy way to point out the people on reddit you should block :)
---
He definitely knows his shit but leadership is more than just knowing things.
---
Cant wait for the pally one 😍
---
More pogs. MOAR POGS.
---
Yeah, it will be nice to plug it up to my 65" 4K TV and get some casual leveling done.
---
Less than 1000 hours
---
I probably won’t get Thex. Instead I am gonna make a guild called &lt;Thex likes Nickleback&gt;   Out of spite of course...
---
You can just flash heal max rang perfectly fine to 60 with shadow spec
---
I actually hadn’t heard of that method. Just spamming aoe I’m guessing.
---
End-game content is much more challenging and organized PVP is much more competitive. Retail made a lot of changes so that all the content Blizzard develops is in some way accessible by all players, but that was a good thing. It allows them to focus a lot more resources and personnel on developing that content.
---
There's simply nothing like Mythic Raiding, Mythic+ Dungeons, or Arenas in Classic. The only "hardcore" mode in Classic is speedrunning and there's really not a large follower/media base for that.
---
For me? The economy. The retail economy has so many niche markets. 
---
I'll be playing the classic market for sure, but it's a lot less lucrative outside of mats and mid level BoEs.
---
Very few dps bis pieces are plate though, it’s a lot of leather which hunters, druids, rogues and shaman may want
---
Check the countdown and map on the blizz post: https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22990080/mark-your-calendars-wow-classic-launch-and-testing-schedule
---
It's a global release so everyone has access at the same time. So for you being French it'll likely be at midnight when Monday rolls into Tuesday.
---
How else you plan on learning the fights?
---
Can watch as many guides as you want... still have to play to accomplish it.
---
I just hope someone named Curtis who loves Antigua sees this
---
I like it! Recommend making the art what you’ll look like while leveling instead of the wet dream tier gear!
---
Maybe, but it was the belief that putting a ton of dots on Onyxia would stop the breadth atk.
---
If you're talking strictly new old wow, id still say o o g a g a n g from the beta was first. But yeah thats a cool thing to think about, the first famous wow classic player.
---
Yep, gm here, awaiting server number and names so I can tell everyone where we'll roll
---
Master the arcane, take mage!!
---
Well that's just, like, your opinion man
---
As someone that has never been inside aq40. What is the boss mechanics and how do you beat it
---
Wish everyone would stop saying it’s hard to level a warrior. It’s not.
---
sounds like it is based on your post mate
---
funny vid. gonna be a total dick and say it's not actually a serious pull, and its setup for comedic effect.
---
the entrance to the c'thun area is the opposite side, which must mean the guild traversed the area in front of the c'thun eye by hugging the back wall to get to the small room adjacent to c'thun which is often used by guilds to do a mockup of positioning for the boss. the video seems to start with them running out of that room back towards the boss in a completely haphazard formation.
---
they don't have any consumes or world buffs, and clearly they're all just having a good time saying things like 'lasers pewpew'. makes me think its just the last few minutes of raid and they don't really mean to seriously attempt cthun and are just fucking around.
---
Druid! Can't wait to see more
---
Why lol with an 'e'? Lole, looks strange...
---
I couldn’t tell you, I leveled shaman rogue and 2 warriors to 60 in vanilla.
---
so baited
---
LOL
---
Sp33k l33t ftw?
---
Even though it shows a horde, I love the idea. Please keep making these :)
---
You callin' u/JM91Six a pussy bro?
---
They have stated they are looking to address
---
&gt;all classes are the same
---
Somewhat in 9.0
---
Who knows what their idea of that s though.  I'm sure homogenizing the classes seemed genius to someone(s) in order for them to be as bland as they are now.
---
Mien... I'm German now...
---
(Michael + Denmark)
---
It's gonna take you roughly 150 hours to level a character.
---
Do you really want to spend that much time just to be able to farm slightly more efficiently?
---
[So baited.](https://imgur.com/gallery/rAoAl7D)
---
This is terribly underrated.  Get this post up there!
---
I'd be interested. Im in Brooklyn and have been looking for a guild on the East Coast.
---
Look at BiS lists for holy paladin. Much cloth.
---
Blizzard's treatment of Classic's hidden placement in the launcher (along with a lack of advertising or any meaningful promotion) makes me think that they see Classic as little more than a curiosity or a token effort to appease WoW's most vocal fans.
---
The only thing that will prove them wrong is new subscriptions opened in August that remain active.  Cash is king.  If their internal metrics tell them that Classic is driving more monthly revenue than BfA, then perhaps we'll see a change in their attitude.
---
This certainly is not true for myself.
---
The reason we quit is the reason we won't return.  They aren't solving the problems thye just keep spitting out content with worse and worse mechanics (ooo random my weapon to a higher tier!  what fun, oh this is an mmorpg? thought it was a phone game!)
---
I think so. Smh
---
Did you mean (literal god) at pvp?
---
You can't, he isn't flagged
---
I think raiding is actually Vanilla's weakest aspect, which is why I'm surprised by all the surveys that suggest a majority of players are looking forward to Classic raids more than any other content.
---
I never cared about speedrunning in any game until I played on a Private Server and the reason is because that was the only complexity/difficulty left in those raids. There's so little challenge baked into them that you have to invent your own challenges to make it interesting.
---
I remember when my guild first downed rag too. I remember sooo many things from vanilla because they were real accomplishments. Today everything is handed to you on a silver platter. There is no accomplishment. Only participation trophies that all look like the real trophies.
---
Just be a warlock
---
He's trolling
---
Because that's how mmo's work?  New harder raids that drop better gear come out and you have to minmax and grind to beat them?
---
yes...of course.
---
Don’t dps warriors wear a lot of leather? Even more competition then.
---
Boooooooo
---
Your Anus is mine.
---
I'm stuck between Hunter, Priest and Warlock, in that order. Tho, I just tried making a new guy and playing a little bit of each in current WoW, and now I'm not sure; the order is kinda flipping. I've leveled a Hunter to about 40 or so a long time ago, and never played Warlock nor Priest. 
---
My last main was Mage, and I want to try something new, which is why I originally put Warlock in last of my choices - immolation seemed kinda similar to fire -  but I'm kinda unsure how similar Priest and Warlock actually are in PvP and PvE. 
---
If I played Priest, I'd probably go dps(shadow?) in the BG and leveling/world PvP, but I put it ahead of Warlock because I can try healing in lower level dungeons, which I've never done before. But if I just want to deal out dmg in PvP, the abilities seems similar to Warlock? 
---
I'm also considering the fact that I might get bored before hitting 60. I enjoyed PvP a little more in the past, so which of the three does best in pre-60 PvP (open world/1v1, and BG)? And how does Priest and Warlock compare/differ from each other and from Mage? 
---
I kind of have a general idea of how each of them do in PvE.
---
Thex
---
Which road though.  That's the question.  Did they head to durotar?  To mulgore?  To ashenvale? Or deeper in Barrens.  I'm going with the last choice.
---
yeah, I can´t imagine someone coming back for classic and then jump into retail. They all quit for a reason and BfA is the worst expac so far.
---
This meme is proof of evolution.
---
Beep
---
World pvp encounters as fire: Polymorph..... Pyroblast cast chased by fire blast usually gets em down to about 40% health
---
Im going warlock too and i will focus on pvp and pve.
---
Thinking about leveling with skinning/mining and switch to
---
Engineering/tailoring after 60 and some gold.. Is there another better way to do this?
---
By the same token Alliance Hunters will have no competition for mail gear.
---
2006 vanilla was already much different than the launch game, it was already about end game and less for old mmo players
---
The actual mechanics of Retail content are better, what you're complaining about are the minutiae required to separate LFR, Normal, Heroic, and Mythic.
---
But again, it doesn't matter if you're part of the group that would never convert. If even 30% of Classic players convert to Retail, then the mission was a success.
---
This is actually very high quality material
---
There is a lot they can change in one expansion, hopefully
---
"Past few days"

Yes, beautiful, I invite them to /roll me for the chest the way miners, herbs, and skinners do (or take turns).

Yeah I guess that makes quite a bit of sense. I never played vanilla, I’m a BC baby so I don’t really know the whole story of classes back then. I can barely pick the ones I want to play lmao.
---
Pass me some kool aid Thex
---
They already have plans to address #1 and #3, #5 is already fixed much better than Classic ever will be and #4 isn't necessarily a bad thing. I completely disagree with #2.
---
Do you feel rogues are obligated to share whatever they pickpocket as well?
---
atleast im not the only one who thought it was Ryab
---
This is too much work. I'm just gonna name my toon whatever is on my desk at the time of creation like I've always done. It used to be some sort of snack or toy, but now a days it's probably going to be some kind of medicine because I'm old af.
---
Orc rouge or mage? In vanilla I played a hunter but I was also like 13 years old so I just did random stuff didnt raid until much older. Enjoyed pvp alot in vanilla and world pvp. Prolly wont Raid in classic. I like the ability to teleport any place I want. But I also want to be that rouge everyone hates.
---
People keep saying that but I think they're forgetting rogues can solo stealth to that chest and CC multiple mobs in order to loot the chest alone. The group isn't needed. It's actually slower.
---
Is that really the symbol for Arms? I thought that was for Rogues.

Do we know the times that reservations open yet?

Thex got me covered homie
---
I agree but all I'm saying is if COD has 2 separate tabs for 2 versions of the game then WOW should also have 2 separate tabs for the 2 versions of the game.. Or is WOW not good enough anymore?
---
Sounds like you’re a fan of the extremely overpopulated pservers and have managed to convince yourself it’s going to happen despite it being extremely unlikely
---
If you're in T3 as a warlock, pop a trinket and you can crit 5.5k+ with a Soul Fire by itself. 2500+ shadowbolts, 2k+ Conflags and 2k+ shadowburns. You basically kill almost any class with a shadowbolt &gt; immo &gt; conflag combo, even moreso by throwing in a shadowburn afterwards.
---
Mage tops out at around 4.5k with a Pyro, Ele shaman could possibly get around warlock numbers if you get berserking and Ele mastery, and even then it's still less in a "stars align" scenario but it doesn't really matter since basically everything is dead at that point.
---
The reason why warlock end up being the highest burst is just that they scale way harder than the other casters, and T3 gear on any class basically breaks the game. It just breaks it moreso with warlocks.
---
I would say this is getting out of hand but it got out of hand a day ago.
---
I hope the release TBC. Sorry not sorry.
---
Can't decide between Tauren Shaman or Druid. I will want to heal dungeons and probably raids at 60, as my first two main characters were warlock and then warrior tank.
---
Druid pros: Less people play them.
---
Druid cons: No regular rez, simple healing rotation (healing touch &amp; sometimes rejuv) compared to shamans
---
I think I'm leaning towards Shaman for leveling as well.
---
I'd go herbalism/alch.

 Hi,
---
I've personally played world of warcraft since latest days of vanilla. Think it was 2006?
---
I consider myself to be good at the game. I've pushed high ratings in arena and also raided for 10 years.
---
That aside I tried warrior leveling on a \*notlegal\* server. It was horrible. Even tho you can do tricks like Hamstring kite etc it really is a pain. You will die 10000 times before you reach max level as a newcomer to the game.
---
**I strongly recommend you to start with Hunter. You can always try warrior after your first character.**

Day of the Dragons was the first book that I read from warcraft universe and I really liked it as an Alliance player so I think it's worth to read.  Lord of the Clans was the second book I ever read from Warcraft universe and it literally made me  to reroll the faction and I was proudly playing  under command of the green Jesus in the ranks of the Horde  ever since.
---
Yeah people seem to think that they'll easily get Sulfuras on their enh shaman and windfury proc their way to victory in pvp. A few will, a lot more will reroll and respec.
---
Why
---
You can get a 2h very easily if your guild is smart about it. You can just grab a faster 2h from MC that warriors shouldn't want anyway.
---
It's amazing you're able to dress yourself and wipe your ass. Incredibly really.
---
please don't point noobs at that guide, it's pretty awful.
---
Bullova?  Even if you're so wannabe-speedrunner you skip verigan's and then corpsemaker, bullova is almost 3g.  At launch you can do way better from the AH for 3g.
---
In general you can just buy it at the AH rather than craft in vanilla.  Very few crafted items are going to be BoP.  LW is neat because it lets you make armor for yourself before 40, and after with the dragonscale route (though iirc theres a few non specialized LW mail recipes).
---
There is absolutely no hope of Classic driving more revenue than Retail due to microtransactions and expansion sales. BFA made more money in the first month than Classic is likely to make in its lifetime.
---
Thank
---
The best gear for chasing the enhancement dream are mostly dungeon drops. Don't take leather-working. There's no reason when it's just cheaper to get black dragonscale or devilsaur and save yourself the effort of skilling it to 300.
---
Take Mining or Herb, and then Skinning for extra gold on the way up. Swap skinning for Engineering at 60.
---
You'll need to save up a lot for that Annihilator or Nightfall, and even then you better have some friends in a guild who will let you chase the Enhance dream. 
---
Also, look at Sixty Upgrades and play around with the stats. You'll primarily want to aim for 6% hit, and then stack AGI and crit to keep flurry up.
---
Ty for asking this !
---
Didn't even have to do the math or read to comments to figure out everything ended in Thex
---
Does anyone honestly care about ore, leather, and herbs? There's no point squabbling over a few gold that might be earned from mats gathered in a dungeon.
---
A good BoE from a chest could be an upgrade or 100+ gold. That is an entirely different story.
---
Yeah this is true and I think the OP was referring more to raiding than leveling in dungeons, whereas I was referring more to the leveling experience as a warrior.
---
Gorshek farm I believe is horde friendly, Arathi Highlands.
---
It's not that'd big a deal... One you select classic it will always be on classic unless you switch off
---
this is adorable
---
Why the fuck I don't see this drop-down menu for Classic? I have a game time for it wtf?
---
The 'turtle scale' mail set is awesome for about level 40.  Easy to get too just farm a buttload of turtles and poof, you have some nice new green pieces with stam/int/spi
---
Thex.   I'm pretty sure its a Thai base 16 number system.
---
Just buy those items and take a prof that will actually be useful (engi) or one that will make you money (alch)
---
Why do you downvote me???????
---
From my understanding, as long as one keystroke = one keystroke it isn't a problem.
---
People set up remote access to wow all the time in order to play from their mobile device and its never been a problem.
---
You haven’t heard of layering have you?
---
Yep. Imagine if a lock said I'm not going to summon anyone to the dungeon, give the healer a soulstone, or handout any healthstones. A mage that refused to hand out food/water to anyone. That person would be kicked from the group.
---
Don't see why a Rogue should be any different. I'd be fine letting the Rogue have everything else found in any locked chests, but the BoEs need to be rolled on as they are important loot.
---
Im excited for when you do Priest
---
did you even play back then? what
---
But there are no physical keystrokes in your "Twitch plays Classic WoW", which is why it will get detected and banned.
---
Those leveling stats are only true for solo leveling. Warrior is the best for dungeon cleave and with certain other classes the best in duo lvl setups.
---
Breaking news,  you are.
---
Maybe /u/SoupaSoka could agree to you making "the" name choice thread post name reservation. For the memes.
---
Spirit Tap says no
---
Very true! We made this as a general guide kind of thing for a solo player, if you know about dungeon cleave strats and such you probably aren't looking for help picking a class anyway :P
---
ok so it's better to go in with the mindset for mount money via gathering provessions while leveling right? Thanks for the info about this.
---
It's possible that some unique weapons will proc high and scale well, to the point of making enh shammy the new top dps class in pve. Slim possibility, but still.
---
I agree, this does seem possible.
---
God damn it
---
Now those same people as well as a whole mess of other people will also downvote this. But that's because you gave into that guilty Reddit sin of making your own thread to generically respond to everybody in your last thread instead of individually responding to each of them and finding out their reasons for yourself.
---
It isn't a drop off. Consider that the % calculation in the pie chart is based on (number of people that chose paladin) / (all players).
---
The proper calculation should be (number of people that chose paladin) / (alliance only players).
---
If you do that calc, it comes up to around 12.28%, thats a pretty high %
---
It is with potions though!
---
It's an experiment that will not last. I loved wow when it came out bit that was many years ago. 
---
It's going to be just like a retail expansion. Huge at the start and fall off fast. If you are unlucky enough to pick a streamer server well that will just be a shit show. They don't want to spend money on it knowing what it will ultimately be. 
---
Sorry but wake the fuck up.
---
Ok, do it on your own then.
---
But if you are with a group that helped you get to that chest, than everyone should have a fair shot at it as with any other loot that drops while you're in group.
---
Do you pay locks for summoning you to the dungeon or mages for for giving you food/water?
---
Rogues are one of the least wanted classes for 5 mans, unlocking stuff is one of the very few reasons to bring take over other classes.
---
je suis Thex
---
I leveled warrior and it is a bit slower but not that slow, I also think with so many people playing classic (hopefully) partying up for the harder quest is not that hard anyway?
---
Dont hurt me I'm Ryan
---
Overpopulation is an illusion.  unless youre a warrior.

It is important that players have unfiltered conversation about their experiences in vanilla WoW, as well as remain critical of Blizzard's handling of Classic. It is troubling that this subreddit resembles the old World of Warcraft forums. It was that overly defensive attitude from the playerbase there that led to the game WoW's undermining. 
---
Having critical discussion about how Blizzard is releasing Classic, as well as how Vanilla was 15 years ago should be welcomed by this community, not shunned.
---
No it wasn't, Scholo was never level 45 or a 10 man raid.
---
This post is a pretender, if you didn't play that's fine but don't make shit up.
---
Would you consider doing other locales as well? I love the 80s rpg game vibe.
---
I'd say either Shaman or Rogue.
---
I may actually end up flipping a coin.
---
I can’t decide if the low reliance on gear for a feral Druid during leveling is an advantage or a disadvantage. It probably makes you stronger overall but it’s less interesting. M
---
Lole in the wild.  Thanks moon
---
People who say it is worth a read never played Classic or never played enough to run Scholomance.
---
Because they want to see the game and blizzard do well. Regardless of if they were there for vanilla, it's good that wow is getting people excited again.
---
So you just assume that most people who disliked your post lack a reason to downvote you and that they simply don't know what you're talking about?
---
You must be fun to talk politics with! ;)
---
That’s the thing... warriors don’t need raid gear to break the damage meter + raid gear for dps Warr is pretty bad (besides weps) until later patches
---
Hoho Haha
---
Have you been posting threads for the last 3 hours straight? Might be time to log off.
---
I think I'll use a city instead, it seems weird to just pick America. And since my middle name is Thad and my home town is Lexington I guess that would make mine Thex.
---
It's very likely not going to happen, but it's easy to get to 60 on retail. It would be a waste to transfer a Classic 60 to Retail seeing as the /played for each lvl 60 character is vastly different. I'm not sure on the exact numbers, but \~150 hours to get to 60 on Classic and I'm guessing \~5-10 hrs to get to 60 on Retail.
---
I like this idea too :)
---
I play wow for world PvP and 8.2 is insane with world PvP. mechagon is literally some of the most insane world PvP I've ever seen. I can't even quest at times because of too much PvP. retail does have it's issues but world PvP is alive and well, at least from my experience
---
I made an important post about the content Phases, and the changes made to the game during its second year. If you ever notice on this subreddit, almost all of the discussion is about content before AQ. Post-ZG was roughly half of Classic, and it deserves its share of critical commentary.
---
I maimed a human mage in Vanilla. Elwyn forest is my favourite starting zone! Rolling horde this time because that's what all my friends have decided.
---
Don't play pretend, if scholo was level 45 why is all the gear requiring level 55+?
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Scholomance_loot_(original)
---
Those of us who played remember this and this post comes across as complete dishonest.
---
I’m gonna call my paladin Notthex.
---
Remember that while you personally hate current wow allot of people still enjoy it and it's still profitable 
---
While I want blood elves removed from the horde, I acknowledge the fact that most people don't
---
I played a druid from vanilla to mists (i stopped wow at mists) and I will probably roll one again. One of the shitty things about druids is that you never get to see your damn armor, all you see is that furry bear ass.
---
Because your reply adds nothing of value to the conversation. I google this topic weekly because I too am trying to see if my potato laptop can run classic. I get anything from "Just buy a new PC" to "It will run on a calculator" and everything in between. There are so many conflicting answers that I still have no idea.
---
Or they've been planning to move it to a more prominent in the launcher once it's a real game and not just a beta or stress test. And maybe they'll advertise it actually makes sense for someone to see the add and spend money on it, rather than seeing an ad now, seeing if they spent $15 they'd get 5 days of play time, and forgetting about it.
---
But no, those are silly ideas, I'm sure if it gets its own spot on the launcher, and some ads put out closer to release it's totally because of posts on reddit like this one.
---
Thex ain't rolling retail.
---
What was the item guy in coms was all YES about?
---
Does the war bear really have meaning? Do any of us care about "mount offs" in retail?  I'd sell Thunderfury if it meant my guild cleared Naxx.
---
Who fuckin cares.
---
It reminds of the Blizzard can do no wrong mentality of the old WoW forums, back when I would argue against the expansions in favor of Classic.
---
Character reservation is still 12 days away. The Thex meme is strong, but we might all hate it by then. Let's let it live and die by it's own merits.
---
Those icons are amazing btw. I really like them
---
Thex don't goof, Thex Thexes on scrubs.
---
shamans get access to all the best damage trinkets warlocks do, as well as [https://classicdb.ch/?item=19344#comments](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19344#comments) assuming it scales well.
---
In the time it takes a warlock to **hardcast** a soulfire the shaman would have killed him with 3 lightning bolt chain shock seeing as how the warlock's "ultra mega giga" burst takes days to cast.
---
It's ridiculous that you cap out mage at 1 pyro instead of comparing full burst to full burst.
---
pyro - scorch while pyro is flying (you can get a fireball at max range almost, and I plan to roll troll) - pom pyro - fireblast - blastwave - cone of cold **large portion of that burst is aoe with cc attached also**
---
only 2 hard casted spells and all crits would probably be over 15k you said yourself 2 pyros would be 9,000 dmg, 2 spells 1 instant and it tops out 200 dmg under the warlocks full burst of 4 spells all needing to crit vs the mage's 2. See how it looks now? Warlocks hit hard, nobody is taking that away from you, but do your burst with a rogue on you, you have 1 chance and thats deathcoil or larger consumables that the rogue might also bring. It's for that reason a shaman walking up and casting a bolt into instant crit chain is considered reliable while some tardlock who walks up with his imp and hard casts a 6 second soulfire is not reliable. Also shadowburn being a 20 yard range.
---
Warlocks have 5 crit from talents, mages can get a base of 8 or 9 from talents and \~14 to scorch and fireblast depending on how they spec. The mage can instantly do 4500 dmg from 41 yards with instant follow up damage vs a warlock who has to stand still.... In fact, you are talking about perfect conditions for the warlock which is less than realistic compared to the other classes. In that case consider the shamans and mages to be trolls with max zerking activated, pyro won't even connect before the 1.73 second fireball that crits for 3500 is in flight. You could sheep the warlock and reliably get off a pyro and 2 fireballs into pom pyro with MQG and Zerking, that warlock is **dead.**
---
Nice try, Thex!
---
I feel personally attacked  (am a Ryan also from Canada)
---
It's annoying when a name you want is taken and you never encounter the player who got it
---
Honestly if they use research from classic to create comparable game feel and quality in retail I’d 100% play again. I usually play the first few months of every xpac regardless and I’d love to have a reason to stick around longer
---
Jokes on you, the first letter of my name does not appear in your table.
---
Critical discussion is one thing, but someone commented on one of your previous posts with a well informed breakdown of patch additions throughout Vanilla and you straight up just said "did you even play back then?"
---
How is that in any way a constructive conversation?
---
Warlock
---
I could see them sitting there saying, *scoff* “BFA brought X amount of players, so we can expect that much.” When in reality people who haven’t played in years are coming out of retirement.
---
I can’t even name most of the expansions after BC and played Legion for a week before giving it up.
---
I'd like to know if my laptop can run Classic, I can run vanilla just fine.   
---
Core i5 3337u @1.80 Ghz  
---
6gb RAM  
---
Intel Hd4000 graphics  
---
It's and older Asus laptop. 
---
I'd like to play for nostalgia. If I have to upgrade and spend over $500 then I'll wait and spend 1k on a new PC and I doubt I'd play classic if I can run newer PC games.
---
Never been used shower, check.
---
Blizzard historically rolls out stuff at 12 AM prime meridian. That's the way the full game will be launched and that the way it looks like the character reservation will be opened. In other words, just as the game launches on 12 AM Greenwich on the 27 (5 PM CDT Aug 16), it is probable that character reservation will open at the same time of day on the dates 12/13.
---
My shaman's name will be poopnutz420 thanks you very much!
---
This releases in August hey? Hmmmm
---
Macro noob here: what spell goes in the parentheses and doesn’t the pet auto attack when the warlock casts a spell?
---
This is amazing...  
---
Would love to see an Undead Mage pros/cons.
---
Pretty much this, I don't know how Blizzard could have been expected to expand on anything besides the raiding without completely overhauling existing systems like PvP. Which they did during Burning Crusade with the introduction of a healthier honour system and arena.
---
I love your DND-esque style! Kudos for the awesome job!!
---
I love you both
---
same, just scanned the comments to save myself posting this.
---
Keyword "plan"
---
Was thinking the same thing.
---
They could ignore aspects of Classic completely and just completely wipe all of Retail so that every single player started with nothing and I would choose it over Classic.
---
As it stands now, every time I login to Retail, I feel like I'm chipping away at a mountain of ice with no end in sight. There's just SO much to do in every patch that you have no hope of catching up on what you missed. It's a completionist's nightmare. Even when I put on blinders and say "I'm only going to do 8.2 content", my time investment feels like a drop in the bucket.
---
I'm not excited for Classic because of the nostalgia or because I think it's a better game (it's not). I'm excited for Classic because it's simpler and easier to 100%.
---
This is a really bad ide the whole point in expansions is that you alow new players or players that have not been able to get best gear/seen all the endgame content to have the same chance as old players. When going on this new adventure. If most of the players is going to be able to experience the new content (and pay for it) it need to be accessible. The extra levels and the new gear makes this posible. Sure adding a bunch of low level stuff is accessible but will the big masses pay to level another character in a new way?
---
You are probably ok on low settings. I tested on an Asus G73JH laptop in both modes (including powersaver to use onboard graphics). Was able to run at low settings around 30-40 fps.
---
I mean it wouldn’t have taken new technology to do that. We had mods in 2005. If guilds where interested in that they woulda did it.
---
Well done!
---
Can't wait to see the warlock one x)

Haha, cool!

Hey Silver!
---
If you’re interesting in playing Druid, I made a vide recently highlights my top 5 reasons to play one.
---
I don’t mean to shame plug, just trying to do my best to maybe help those who are interested!
---
Best of luck!
---
Here’s the video link :)
---
https://youtu.be/MpJu0qzQCgY
---
If you take the survey you can view the basic stats of all responses afterwards. If you click the same link instead of having you take the survey it was ask if you want to either adjust you previous answers or see what others responded with which is where you cna see the stats.
---
You can't look at subsets of the data, but if for some reason you care in a few weeks I'll release an updated version of the tool I made for the first census survey that has this surveys responses. Which that will let you see things like like the stats for people who answered certain ways, or what answers people put for one question who put something for another (say professions for people who said they're playing a rogue, or the stats of people who say they're rolling Horde).
---
I never got that vibe from her, but it's been years since I read them.
---
She's usually a fantastic writer, but Arthas...
---
&gt;!Totally forgets about Uther, Kael'thas is the creepy ex-suitor of Jaina, and minimizes Ner'zhuls's corruption of Arthas' mind.  Muradin was cool though.!&lt;
---
'CUZ YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE FUCK TO DO!
---
iirc some dude made a post about what everyone's main will be named. And he said he is going to make a shaman named Thex. So now everyone is going to make a Thex on every server so that guy can't get his shaman named thex lol
---
Before aq released I'm going to farm elemental earth

Druuuid
---
It comes from a character name reservation post a day or two ago
---
It’s mob mentality, I’ve said it a few times before, they want to drag you down to their mental/emotional level,.  There are some cool cats here, but for the most part they’re trolling.  They like to say no changes when nobody asked for a change.  They want threx memes, not discussion.  Imagine what these people’s daily lives are like if the best they can do is bring that kind of salt instead of just scrolling past, being uninterested.  They’re unhappy in their core.  The subs not doing well, activity has slowed, you can see the same 50 or less people acting out like this.  There are plenty of examples that counter this logic, but you can tear down plenty of trees and leave a dense forest.  Just pay attention to the names, they’re all the same people day in and day out.
---
OP spends to much time on this sub, and thinks the classic player base will be nothing but hardcore min-maxers. When reality is the overwhelming majority of classic players will take months to hit 60 and just wing it in molten core. Most people play to have fun not caring what the 1% of hardcore players are doing.
---
Of course it's bad, respecing shouldn't even be in the game at all.
---
It’ll be tough. Skinning may be tough depending how bad devilsaur leather is farmed as well. Mining could be your best bet with thorium along with arcane crystals from rich thorium veins.
---
I guess people can be "defensive" over the game as they want the game delivered exactly as it was. We all know the game had it flaws, it got repetitive, it was unbalanced in terms of PvP, the gear disparity between raiders and non raiders was significant and so on. People do know and understand that-none the less they want that exact experience, exactly how it was delivered back in the day. When people criticize the game or suggest "improvement" the hardcore fanbase will retaliate simply because it is not what they want, and do not want what they are expecting to get to be altered in any shape or form.
---
We have all seen countless threads of people saying "I want classic but what if blizz changed this" or "should blizz rebalance the different specs?" or "can we get transmog" etc. In the end people have got tired of reading the same posts over and over again and having to provide the usual #nochanges response. The people waiting eagerly for classic for so long just want the game as it was even if it was at times broken or repetitive because regardless its faults, it was FUN.
---
With spec loot lists so thoroughly worked out now wouldn't it be pretty easy to have a loot council addon that tells you how big an upgrade a given item is to all players in the raid?
---
Every weapon is a hunter weapon, EVERY weapon .
---
No. There's no maintenance required for Classic and after Phase 6, there will be no movement on Classic at all. Bombard those players getting bored with Classic with news and ads about the then-upcoming 9.0 expansion and you'll convert plenty of them to make the entire Classic enterprise worth it.
---
I'm Tim and mine is Italy
---
I am now Tita
---
I really hope phase 2 is at least 2 months from launch.
---
Dame.
---
Hmm...
---
Hey fub I hope the class decision is going well so far man, it’s def not easy come classic lol.
---
But I actually just released a Druid video on the top 5 reasons why I’m maining one. I think it may help you too :)

---
Not just with other warriors but with rogues/hunters aswell. 
---
When you're leveling, especially as physical dps, it is always nice to stack on some high stam/agi/stg leather. 
---
But tbh, I pumped my warrior with blues LMAO. I had to farm gold. probably like 200g to get my warrior to 60 at a reasonable pace. perhaps im just bad? lol
---
When has  heroic leap ever done good damage?
---
Guilds elect officers, and the officers decide on loot. It's representative democracy. 🙃

Im sure all of this fame has gotten you lots of Thex;) stay safe bro

I'm out of the loop, what was the post that started it?
---
I'll pass the compliments to my wife, she did all the art :)! She does oodles of comissions and other stuff, heres her patreon! https://www.patreon.com/dawndragonart

And, if you wanted a comission from her or had other art questions,  her reddit name is u/EllenQuipley

If you look closely at his mouth, he's saying his Shaman main's name.

This is sooo cool and original 
---
It reminds me of a D&amp;D character sheet so bad
---
Thanks for sharing this 
---
🙌🏽
---
At the bottom it looks like quotation marks are used. Threw me for a loop haha.
---
Scholomance had a minimum level of entry of 45.  A difficulty level of 58-60 though.  
---
The comment stood out to me, too.  None of the gear from there was even usable until level 57.
---
Druid!
---
just stop playing the game when it stops being fun
---
I love the suggestion! I'm working on a few other suggestions at the moment, but i'll definitely get to this one!
---
So Patch 1.8/1.9 and beyond is what I was referring to. This were released over a year before TBC.
---
1.8     Silithus quests and rep farming related to AQ. That was farming for one of the most boring raids in WoW.
---
1.9     A severwide event that lasted a few hours. The idea behind it was good however.
---
1.10   A revamp on tier .5 gear that many players had already acquired
---
1.11  A scourge invasion event and a quests in EPL. Yeah, it was farming for Naxxramas mostly.
---
1.12 World PvP Objectives. Nobody really did these. They were a failure even Blizzard admitted to.
---
Then Naxxramas came out which made released gear that was totally overpowered and ruined itemization in the game. 
---
Over 1 year of Classic and that is all we got? Hardcore raiding. Material and reputation farming for the hardcore raids. Yeah there was way more content in the first year.
---
I still hope it'll take longer though. Especially phase 3 which is the most fun imo. Not a fan of either ZG or AQ, especially since PvP starts becoming all wonky with players running around one-shotting eachother.
---
No, most likely the phases are a 1 year plan. This is based off the historical launch dates AND [the estimates for Classic from WoW's game director, Ion Hazzikostas](https://youtu.be/DdZH3UAwUZo?t=576).
---
* 11 Feb 2005 - Worldwide Launch of World of Warcraft (Vanilla)
---
* 7 Mar 2005 - Dire Maul &amp; World Bosses (24 days after launch)
---
* 8 Apr 2005 - PVP Honor System (1 month 28 days after launch)
---
* 7 Jun 2005 - Battlegrounds (3 months 27 days after launch)
---
* 2 Jul 2005 - Blackwing Lair (5 months 1 day after launch)
---
* 13 Sept 2005 - Zul'Gurub &amp; Arathi Basin (2 months 1 day after BWL)
---
* 10 Oct 2005 - Nightmare Dragons (27 days after ZG)
---
* 3 Jan 2006 - Ahn'Qiraj (3 months 21 days after ZG)
---
* 28 Mar 2006 - Dungeon Loot Revamp (2 months 25 days after AQ)
---
* 20 Jun 2006 - Naxxramas (5 months 17 days after AQ)
---
That would give us:
---
* Phase 2 = ~1 to ~2 months after launch
---
* Phase 3 = ~2 to ~3 months after Phase 2
---
* Phase 4 = ~2 to ~3 months after Phase 3
---
* Phase 5 = ~2 to ~3 months after Phase 4
---
* Phase 6 = ~3 to ~5 months after Phase 5
---
That would put Phase 6 sometime around June 2020 to December 2020, which could be plenty of time before a new Retail expansion.
---
Only reason its profitable is because whales buy crap in game that cost the same amount as actual games, the amount of people playing it is low. Im willing to bet that a lot of people that play it today are too hooked and addicted and feel like they cant stop because of their time and money investment over the years.
---
 
---
I've responded to what they wrote. They listed content that was released during the 2nd year of Classic.
---
1.8 Silithus quests and rep farming related to AQ. That was farming for one of the most boring raids in WoW.
---
1.9 A severwide event that lasted a few hours. The idea behind it was good however.
---
1.10 A revamp on tier .5 gear that many players had already acquired
---
1.11 A scourge invasion event and a quests in EPL. Yeah, it was farming for Naxxramas mostly.
---
Then Naxxramas came out which made released gear that was totally overpowered and ruined itemization in the game.
---
I know right, it's so much better when gear just doesn't drop at all, and when it does drop, you don't get it because steve has more dkp, but maybe it will drop again sometime in the next 4 weeks of raiding. I'm going to play classic pretty hardcore, but I would take getting loot that hasn't titanforged over not getting loot. And people getting titanforges isn't really as common as you think. For the vast majority of players it's a nice bonus, not something they're striving for.
---
Some warriors are barbarians and wear leather.
---
I understand that. However, a lot of posts are not suggesting making changes to Classic, but rather discussing critcism that players had with Vanilla.
---
Hi.
---
I'm hoping the tab is on its way and they're waiting on art implementation and such. How weird would it be if they had a countdown to Classic on the WoW front page, but to play it you have to click on a drop down menu.
---
Is it just me or is rogue suprisingly low on peoples lists?
---
Huge wall of text crits you for 10,000.
---
You die.
---
meanwhile classic will generate that money over time, not in the first month. The difference is that a lot of people bought bfa then ditched it because it blows boat people, a quick cash crab. Meanwhile classic if successful would generate sweet dollaz over a loooong period.
---
I did, after a few hours of their base quest lines, grabbed a set of the new gear then it quickly turned into WQs to level up your follower and the normal WQ grind with rare hunting... Mechagon had even less.
---
If you aren't someone who enjoys collecting pets, mounts &amp; toys, the actual content is very minimal.
---
Also have no idea how someone can log in and not be sure what to do after being gone since the patch before, the game gives you an instant pop up to head straight to the new content...
---
That's still exploitable. It turns loot into popularity contests.
---
I'm Commander Shepard and this is my favorite Thexpost on the Citadel
---
this looks amazing.
---
The Gates of Ahn'Qiraj was not a few hours, it was a few weeks.
---
&gt; Yeah there was way more content in the first year.
---
No there wasn't...
---
Patch 1.3 - Dire Maul &amp; 2 World Bosses (most never fought these)
---
Patch 1.4 - Epic raid-only quests &amp; the PVP Honor System
---
Patch 1.5 - Two Battlegrounds
---
Patch 1.6 - BWL &amp; Darkmoon Faire
---
3 dungeons, 2 battlegrounds, and a once-a-month carnival is not "way more content", it's not even "more content".
---
W O W Z E R Z
---
No way??
---
I’d love to make one of these for my Bloodhunter 
---
He’s literally Darth Maul , I use a [Wotc Star Wars miniature](http://www.gamehollow.com/catalog/images/sw/cs35.jpg) of him as my PC 
---
Thanks again for sharing , this is really creative and cant wait to see more
---
I love the style of art! So talented. Would love to see rogue
---
Classic is not going to generate $400 to $500 million in its lifetime. Just no.
---
Also there are almost no highelves left, they are either dead or bloodelves now.
---
Yeah except that people here are old NA fans who are so proud of their shitty office job and never been good at the game (or any game at all) and go for their excuses of "having kids/responsibilities". I saw the Thex post and it's not even remotely funny like literally nothing, just a bunch of words that means nothing.
---
Thanks for the video man. I was just being meta on the sub with the comment, but I do plan on recreating my first ever character that was a night elf druid that I made at the end if TBC and have it be my second level 60 and a PVP alt. Big &lt;3s keep up the video work.
---
The one-shotting was mostly *before* Phase 3 content because no one had stamina. I spent all day ganking in Blackrock Mountain and that got *much* more difficult after AQ and the dungeon loot revamp.
---
It's second-to-last on my list of solo levelers.  But since Warrior jumps way ahead for group leveling, Rogue is last on my list.
---
Y'all only have like 3 buttons to press and you still wanna macro that?
---
Does the laziness of paladins know no bounds?
---
Why not both herbing and skinning?
---
&gt; BFA sold 3.4 million copies within 24 hours of launch 
---
Correction : it sold those 3.4 million copies from in EIGHT months, between January and August 2018.
---
&gt; BFA made more money in the first month than Classic is likely to make in its lifetime 
---
This is pure BS. But what can you ask from a mindless BfA drone.
---
&gt; More likely is that Blizzard sees Classic as an opportunity to attract former players back into the modern game  
---
One of the most retarded comments on the Internet. Not even a percent of the Classic players will ever play modern WoW. if they would have...they would already be subbed to Retail. Which they aren't.
---
&gt;  If they figure it out in a year 
---
They already figured it out, but also they realized that Retail is impossible to be saved. Classic will not save retail. It will kill it, whether you believe it or not. By the end of this year, Retail will lose almost half the already stupidly low player base (currently barely above 2 million), and with it, a huge chunk of the MTX.
---
Classic doesn't need 20 million players to be more profitable than BfA. It only needs to steal half of the VfA player base (which is almost certain) and to bring back an additional 1 million returning players, which is less than 1% of the former WoW players.
---
In reality, Classic will launch with at least 6-7 million players, will not lose more than 2 millions in 3 months, but will gain back more than 2 millions in the following 3 months after.
---
6 months after Classic release, BfA will have under 1 million players, while Classic will have 7 million+.
---
Whether leveling is a waste of time is a matter of perspective, it's no more a waste of time than it will be in classic.
---
All classes are the same, yet somehow people still have preferences, and raids have different preferences based on the different toolkits classes have, not sure their ability to DPS.
---
wpvp ruined, despite that it has been better in BFA than it has been in years.
---
gearing process is completely different... because a lot more gear drops, and you can't get screwed out of loot for one of the myriad reasons it happens in classic.
---
no sense of server community... I'll actually give you that one. The things that cause that have made it a lot faster and easier to find groups to do hard content, and allowed players on low pop servers chances to actually get groups to do things at all... but ya, the sense of community is gone. It was a calculated decision that I think they should never go back on for retail, though I am looking forward to server community mattering in classic. It's actually one of the key things I'm looking forward to.
---
Game is still about a month away, launch'll be packed, [working w/ new hardware w/ the whole WoW team joining in to help.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.eurogamer.net/amp/2019-07-29-a-big-wow-classic-interview-in-the-lead-up-to-launch)
---
If Classic launches w/o a more prominent spot, that's an issue.  If there's no advertising by mid-September, that's an issue.  Don't want to advertise the game only for fresh blood to ask for refunds when/if the new hardware does its new hardware thing. 
---
At the moment, we're gucci.
---
That sounds reasonable. It would be nice if gear helps skip something like MC because MC was not my favorite raids :)
---
And with sheen of zanza
---
TGFV . . . I might have fudged it, a little.
---
How are the pigeons?
---
The mark of a great game.
---
Very passionate.
---
No it is clear that a couple does mean two in this context.
---
Dire Maul and the first two World Bosses were less than one month after the world release of Vanilla.
---
The PVP Honor System was less than two months after the world release of Vanilla.
---
The first two Battlegrounds were less than four months after the world release of Vanilla.
---
Blackwing Lair was just five months after the world release of Vanilla.
---
Awesome!
---
Thex the Shaman.
---
Who knows, blizzard will let your guard down by letting you do whatever for months and then banning thousands at the same time.
---
Only to major cities..thats not anywhere..but i like the hstone/telepory t freedom thag gives me
---
Shaman won't be the most popular class.
---
Haha
---
Ooh please keep going this is really cool!
---
I’d love to see Priest personally.
---
You cannot compare every single thing in the game that was created over the ~5 years it was in development before launch to what was created *after* launch.
---
If you're comparing year one to year two, you only get to compare content created *after* launch.
---
Was not intended to be. Was supposed to be a riff on Jar-Jar.
---
That might have been the case back in vanilla but people will run around in tier gear very quickly now which has a lot of stamina, but not very high damage. This makes PvP fun because it's a bit more drawn out. The offensive and defensive capabilities are fairly even. Once AQ and especially Naxx comes out, the defensive values stay roughly the same but the damage goes through the roof. An AQ/Naxx geared lock/mage will oneshot players regardless of their gear. Only tanks survive it. 
---
This is why TBC buffed the stamina on gear by something like 30% and added resilience which attempted to provide a defensive PvP stat.
---
It's the name of my troll shaman.
---
yes! I would say the spec I described earlier is best. It is known as the "Heart of the Wild spec", and considered the best pvp/pve combo spec. 
---
It's 0/30/21 or 1/29/21 (4-5/5 HOTW, 21 pt nature's swiftness, and optionally 1 pt in Nature's grasp for added pvp benefit). 
---
Example: [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxoxscrdxVxf0xo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxoxscrdxVxf0xo)
---
It is arguably as good for pve resto as a standard pve resto build because of Heart of the Wild, which provides +20% intellect that no standard pve resto druid would have. For your feral points, you can focus on bear, cat, or both, and you will be stopping before Leader of the Pack.
---
This would allow you to casually raid tank/dps as well (you need to carry multiple sets of gear though). You'd be missing Leader of the Pack though (and some +dps balance talents), so you'll never out-dps a pure cat druid for example. If there is another feral druid in the group with LOTP, then even better.
---
If you’re not in the “clique” this is going to mean zero gear for you for quite some time.
---
That's one way to make sure that Rogues won't get group invites for dungeons.
---
You can make friends pretty easily as you level up. 
---
Be nice to people, help them with goals that you have in common (quests, dungeons etc). Add them, rinse and repeat. Also, joining a guild can be very helpful as well.
---
I have three big problems with this video and a statement a guy made here that it’s marketed towards new players:
---
First of all if it’s marketed for newer players it’s bad marketing because people that’ll go into classic will be players that have been waiting for this game already for the past few years. The marketing from blizzard for classic wow is non existent so we won’t have to expect a completely new player base to classic. Even people coming from retail who haven’t tried it are gonna be rushing thru this instance like a knife thru butter (oh yea and apparently everybody in this subreddit is a classic veteran and has cleared naxxramas. Those players don’t need it at all. 
---
Second of all if there happens to be any new players in classic who haven’t touched wow at all is the type of player where everybody says (also in this subreddit) let them experience the game in the “right way” “vanilla is all about the journey” “it’s a non linear game”. Well then let them be. Let them wander around where to get them quests and let them experience the instance without any videos before hand 
---
The third reason I dislike it (I just thought of it) is the “guide” as it is. Vanilla people and a fuck ton of people in this subreddit are hating on retail so much for their Dungeon guide and raid guides that are build in game: “oh it’s so easy you can just read the bosses abilities, you don’t have to figure out anything by yourself” why then make a guide that explains it even further than the dungeon guides in retail (while this statement is so wrong anyway, there’s still shit ton of things to figure out e.g. WFR, but even heroic difficulty.) 
---
That’s my take on it. Don’t hate. I’m also a classic lover but can’t stand the discrepancy in some of y’all statements.
---
On Deathwing there was Volarun and Swifty. Swifty was the gank King.
---
I mean, sometimes pods also got a text version, typing it all down as it progresses, I just asked if there's such a version :p
---
What was the development cost of each?
---
Tier gear is going to take just as long to collect in Classic as it did in Vanilla.
---
Is this some kind of joke? you reposted the exact same shit that is on the second page.
---
#**There is no option for RP-PvP interest. This is a big oversight. It is not absolute that there will be no RP-PvP servers at launch, yet by omitting the option in the survey you are decreasing the chances of players getting this server type.**
---
That is not the point. The point is that if you started at launch and progress through the content, there was a lot more to complete during the first year. There was very little new content for level 60 players during the second year. This time around a lot of players will be playing at launch, and more will face the content drought of the 2nd year of Classic. A lot of players joined Vanilla WoW throughout the 2 years of the game, so many were still doing year 1 content right before TBC.
---
Jesus that's a toxic mentality
---
you don't use a vague term when talking about something "serious". That would be like saying "i got shot a couple of times" "oh wow shot twice" "no i said a couple, i was shot 5 times, a couple". You use "a couple" when you're talking about fricken skittles or a handful of change.
---
No one knows, but certainly not enough to make "BFA made more money in the first month than Classic is likely to make in its lifetime" less true.
---
I love the alliance, but it really is the right answer. Every mass transit point for the horde is super guarded, and every one for the alliance is exposed.
---
True well said. I like your drawings tho keep up the good work .
---
Oh ok my mistake
---
I like to have thex with my girlfriend. Sometimes we talk about having some thex toys as well.
---
She will love it when I'm done 3D printing a Troll Shaman at work.
---
There is a lot of shortcomings to this survey, very disappointing. Of course, many veteran Vanilla fans will forgo professions while leveling, not even taking skinning.
---
LaCroix nice
---
Mute
---
I honestly don't care what your point now is. The point in your original post is just plain wrong.
---
Take My downvote :)
---
Or a whole character... Transfers won't be cheap..
---
It is extremely disappointing that RP-PvP was not included in the answers. This is a spit in the face to RP-PvP players especially in light of the fact that it is not set in stone that there won't be RP-PvP servers at launch let alone added later.
---
That is a great point.
---
Huntard please
---
So I can't be "ImARealLlama"?
---
Khama hunger flows with this one.
---
How is the original post wrong? There was very little content added during the 2nd year of Classic WoW. You listed it yourself.
---
Unfortunately no, and you can't capitalize letters in the middle of the name either. Only the 1st letter is capitalized
---
No it doesn't because the BFA players were paying $15 a month too.
---
1 and 2 will probably never be fixed, if anything we're heading towards levels being removed completely and more megaserver tech. The other three are all stuff that can change in later expansions though. They already backed away from the homogenisation slightly in BfA, I'm expecting another (hopefully larger) step in 9.0. It'll never be as much as it used to be but hopefully it'll get close.
---
Found the commie@!
---
So this is purely subjective and not facts, that should also be said.
---
True, but most guilds didn't clear MC and BWL in week 1. Many guilds didn't even get past Vael. This is what will change with Classic.
---
I guess thats also a good way to get going. As a multiboxer, you wont have problems killing stuff - Youll have a problem with gathering XP on all the chars at once. Lucklily, thats cured by exploration... At least for a couple of levels. If you can bring 40 chars from 1-5 in an hour, its worth it imo. 
---
How will you handle the leveling? Using the mouse to pick-up quests on all at the same time with instant-quest-accept and turn-in ?
---
#Thex
---
I like it
---
May Thex be with us all .
---
wrath baby
---
My Thex be with us.
---
Well you dont have to use em if you like
---
Promptly got banned for being as annoying in game as real life. Ran around the halls screaming “Nooo! NOOOOO!!”
---
Rc loot council is literally a democratic way of distributing loot to the most worthy
---
r/sadcringe
---
In fact I'm ready to be Faker. Or even Caps if needed.
---
And I'm sure those will be free for none of you knows what I'm talking about.
---
Thex or bust
---
That’s one of the reason vanilla was harder
---
Some dude asked which name people planned on reserving and he gave the name he had in mind (Thex) resulting in everyone just claiming that was their planned name...
---
how so?
---
We have a vote on which race the class would be. Like undead/rogue, gnome mage (pink tail female), tauren shaman, etc
---
Honestly, the only content you're currently missing is the BfA stuff... Which is the big issue if you ask me. As soon as a new expansion hits, everything before it becomes irrelevant and obsolete. Sometimes it even happens before that, a warlock was able to solo the first tier of Legion before BfA hit. WoW has some amazing zones and content in all expansions but it goes out of the way to make sure you *only* do whatever the current tier is.
---
Yeah, I did the exact same thing. Had an Excel spreadsheet, tested it out on a pserver. Here comes the lvl 40 kitty! . . . or not. XD
---
Don’t play shaman if mana issues annoy you, priest is infinitely better.  Shaman is probably the worst mana conserver of all vanilla
---
Have you thought about just not using addons?
---
Yes, because ultimately players progress through that content over the same time period.
---
Can't wait to see Druid!
---
It stops at 20%.
---
Have to re-evaluate my race choice now lol. At least I'm not alone
---
Don't you get it. If you played the game at launch, there was way more content to do that you hadn't done before.
---
You little clever devil.
---
I'm not gonna pay thexes, sorry
---
It's from yesterday morning. We are all Thex now.
---
The specifics paint a vivid image.
---
Then they get guildies and you roll them too.
---
Great times, great times
---
33m sub payments (roughly). I think thats doable over several years. I dont think its likely, but its not unreasonable
---
I havent seen this.  Thank you, giving spirit
---
The game has already so many changes, that asking for nochanges at these days is invalid
---
You cant go wrong with Thex.
---
I hope they do just to fuck with you and only you
---
David from the UK... Dani sounds very feminine though, can I just be Thex too?
---
Or k could go with Britain which would be Dari but that's not really any better... England and Dang maybe? Sure, I'll be Dang.
---
I will in fact be running a guild.
---
seems like a perfect idea
---
This post is a little HomoThexual but let's see where it goes.
---
no worries, me and my buds won't be rushing to 60 :)
---
Yep, and Honor tabards won't be in until phase 2.
---
I recently thought about this.  
---
no. not really.
---
its massively imbalanced in this regard.  
---
go'sheks is similar, but guess what. alliance has fields like that in arathi too.
---
from the top of my head:  
---
- southern barrens excavation  
---
- west in mulgore  
---
- druid cove in stonetalon  
---
- hillsbrad fields  
---
- hillsbrad mine  
---
- hillsbrad dwarf fortress  
---
- hinterlands elf camp  
---
- eastern plaguelands elf camp  
---
- durotar human fortress  
---
- barrens human fortress  
---
- ashenvale nightelf camps  
---
- ...
---
you get the picture.  
---
not sure if some of the low level npc even flag you for PvP. wouldn't surprise me if they did.
---
It really helps if you spec in orgrimmar for the extra haste a critical chance and it becomes pretty insane in pvp
---
World pvp is crap if solo. In a 2v2 you re the strongest class with a healer behind.
---
WoW Classic's success has very little to do with how many players play it in the next year and a lot to do with opening up a huge playerbase to the 9.0 expansion launch that would otherwise not be susceptible to their marketing and addition-based gameplay mechanics.
---
Three months after Naxx, when Blizzard announces there will be nothing new coming to Classic but that the upcoming 9.0 expansion looks great, players *will* migrate. Sure, not all of them, but enough to make all those new expansion sales and microtransactions worth the entire Classic enterprise.
---
!RemindMe 10 days
---
Oh I assumed the first month was gifted with purchase like it historically has been. Hardly fair to account for micros when you’re not accounting for development cost. Regardless, the claim that classic wouldn’t match bfas first month in its lifetime is obviously false, and downvoting me won’t change that lol.
---
Cant wait to roll orc warlock again
---
I mean warriors one shot mages you just are force to dance with them.  Warriors are the best class in vanilla.
---
You just need a partner or to do group content.
---
Someone revealed the name of their chat on launch day so people are all planning to take it on the 13th
---
I know the joke but to make some real talk, as long as you dont have FAP or blessing of freedom, you arent unstoppable killing machine by any means. In fact, you are pretty stoppable.
---
only Grom'Gol and Kargath.  
---
Grom'Gol is a bit too cramped compared to Menethil and you also don't get as much high level traffic.  
---
Kargath is your best bet to gank high levels. either at the chokepoint to searing gorge or close to the tower.  
---
closer by the tower means you'll get rezz zerged eventually.
---
What kind of classes would that be ?
---
I agree with you so much. Retail has become a collection game. Doesn't feel like an actual living and breathing world anymore. Just alot of phasing content and checklists of things to collect. The only aspect of retail I still appreciate is the dungeons, raids, and the art. The as an mmo though, it's so disappointing.
---
Good mages cover their sheeps with detect magic
---
Warlock easily. And even in 10-60 they can compete with Hunters.
---
Lampshade or Soap*
---
Worst troll I've ever seen on reddit, looking through your comment history. How sad, bud.

But but.. I wanted to be Thex :C
---
Pata..

Warrior and pally are my go to classes

Love the artwork!
---
lol this is a very misguided take. you will see soon.
---
No matter what number combination I use I always end up with the name 'Thex' please help :C
---
The whole Thed thing is a solid indicator that this subreddit is thirsty for classic news/info/release beyond what is healthy! :P
---
So... Meritocratic?
---
Thex is our saviour.
---
You managed to look my warrior gay, fuck you.
---
sadly no,german and french but no spanish
---
Grinding rep was a horrifying and dull experience that only the crazy, bored, or someone who wanted that cute flavor reward went for. 
---
Ony, Mc, And bwl attunement can feasibly be done on a weekend if I remember right.
---
T is for Thex, a thexcellent name for any troll shaman in this great game
---
No they won't, Classic is a clean slate
---
The absolute biggest draw for classic will be the levelling experience. I can’t wait.
---
Thex gets early access tho
---
Nope, sadly i didn't have the foresight 14 years ago that this would be a topic here. We will have to wait for classic in a few weeks to find out. Can be noted that the racial abilities of humans and orcs just says swords, maces and axes as well.
---
Not necessarily. People didn't use addons out of pride. Plus, there were rumors using them could get you banned or hacked.
---
Are you implying that criticism or concern means that one doesn't care about the game? That's extraordinarily wrong. You know that lack of care means? Unsubbing and moving on. No feedback, no criticism, just moving on.
---
Hope you all are as excited as we are to have Slanik and Vendor Trash on board :) This was a reveal trailer that a number of you watched live as it was released - thanks for joining us.
---
We are going to continue to announce additional shows and the availability of old archives every couple of days. Our twitter @WarcraftRadio is probably the easiest place to keep up. August 18th at 2pm Eastern time is our launch show.
---
A lot of your points are either contradictory to your sources, or completely unsubstantiated. There's just so much wrong with what you've said it's difficult to believe you actually played the game or read your sources.
---
Damn that sucks
---
The only time I've really only seen that is when I'm joining peoples groups for world bosses or something. I do agree tho, having a consistent world of players is insanely important and one of the first things that really turned me off in the game. I literally just stared playing like 2 weeks ago tho so I'm only familiar with the new zone.
---
Fortunately there's no real reason to grind rep outside of what you normally just get raiding in vanilla. The exalted bg items are about the only decent items and that's not too bad just doing bg weekends and probably not great items if you're a raider anyway.
---
mate. stop the low effort meme posts in every thread. you’ve killed it.
---
i like the cartoony style.
---
No DBM early in the game, but there some addons that almost played the game for you. Decursive, in example. During the beta, there were some crazy addons (like the one where you input the coordinates and it'd walk your character to that location, great for corpse runs).
---
The Raid Leader card in Hearthstone say's "Handle it!" as it comes into play. Always thought that was a nice little reference.
---
Maaaaaaage!
---
Arent night elves just trolls who mutated or something?
---
I'm Thex, and so is my wife
---
Engineering gives you a ton of trinkets that can let you do junk like charge with a helmet, stun with a few trinkets, slowfall, escape CC, create the Mechanical Dragonling/Chicken for raids, and other interesting toys. Explosives are the main draw, since they also stun and you lack one.
---
LW is meh. Alchemy is good, but why not make an alt with alchemy and keep your main for PvP? Might as well if you're going enhance since the difference isn't huge between PvE and PvP specs.
---
Who knows? The economy isn't up yet, but there's always someone who took leather working. Just farm dungeon drops or get your guildmates to do it for you.
---
Ya I got exalted with all the bg factions just by playing and having fun. I think I got AV exalted in a weekend. (Not quite sure on that but I know it was fast). 
---
The only rep I really want exalted with this time is the ZG trolls.
---
Your last paragraph is fully on the spectrum
---
hahahaha i fucken knew someone would say that
---
Really? Holy shit, you just blew my mind. What you speak of was not obvious at all. (Whooosh)
---
Tank and dps warrior share 0 gear drops. Tank gear has higher stamina and defensive stats, and often use the faster 1h's.
---
Dps warriors should be more worried about rogues, who they share a lot of leather gear and weapons with.
---
am slowly realising this lol
---
It's totally not true, was once time a story because some guys downloaded a fishy addon zipped with a keylogger on Megaupload. Addons were never forbidden, only botting apps were.

---
A lot of people like drake, doesn't make him a good musician
---
If you truly wanted to have a constructive discussion, why don't you make a post about what you would like to see moving forward from classic (as a result of your opinions about vanilla, perhaps?).  I think most of the people downvoting, myself included, see no value in pointing out perceived flaws in a 15 year old game.  I'm sure most everyone could single out things they didn't like about vanilla wow.  But, those things are different for everyone so its best for everyone to just leave everything the same.
---
I guess it would make sense for the lore if humans, allies, are protecting their lands as the horde is trying to take over.  Makes the factions even more different. Allies get these zones and Horde get slightly better pvp racials.
---
The horde have one in Arathi, I can't think of any others.
---
adding to your list:
---
-Silverpine Dalarn wizards etc
---
-Alterac Mountains Dalarans and Eles
---
probably left out so many others as well
---
Undead Warrior, without doubt. Can't decide if I'll stick with my modern online name, or go back to my old WoW/Tibia-era name.
---
AddOns played for you though. Decursive was mandatory back then for any serious guild.
---
I'm fucking _J A A N_
---
It depends on pserver players putting the money where their mouths are, since classic servers had been around for a while.
---
I’ve played those, and especially enjoyed arena and rbg pvp. They are the better part of the game. The criticism is still valid tho: retail is neither an mmo nor an RPG. It’s an action collectaton game riddled with personal instances. I’ve played each class to 2k-2.5k rating as well - all were fun, good rotations and skills, but all were also essentially the same. I far preferred Legion over beta for ass a lot, but that 2 had the issues. Perhaps retail can change course and be more than a dumb collectaton made to extort money from “whales” (industry term for money spenders), perhaps not. We will see.
---
its more comparative to other classes, warrior is weak. Prot, especially for the average unkowledgeable newbie (who are the ones who need class advice!), is fairly slow compared to say, a hunter.
---
Not really. This time next year, Private Servers will be legally impossible due to the new copyright laws. Even if they're hosted in a non-signatory country, your ISP will be forced to block your access to them. So if Blizzard closes down Classic in ~2 years to force the final holdouts over to 9.0, then Classic WoW will die forever.
---
I wish for you to not be on r/classicwow
---
"hey vote for me and I'll mail you 10g"
---
&gt; and if they do you can kick them and find another DPS within 5 minutes anyway.
---
I mean, jesus. That's a pretty shitty attitude.
---
Oy vey
---
They are optional.
---
What is your gripe with addons?..
---
The difference is that you waste a lot of time to level up your lockpick. For the first 50 70 skills thats fairly easy but after that its quite hard finding and waiting the currently needed chests to open Like in the lake at swamp of sorrow őr in desolace you burn valuable time for it. So as a rogue main i think its my right to loot it and keep the loot if others cant.
---
Mages just have to learn it and cast it locks just have do the same expect they need soulshard
---
360 nosleep
---
In raids hunters will actually use their tier sets, so they won't have any competition with other classes.
---
When trying to collect pre-raid BiS they will have to compete with rogues and warriors on both factions.
---
AV rep was definitely the easiest by far. Which is nice because it also had the best rewards.
---
Oh 8.2 is so different I’m sure ! And it only took what a half year? To get the real release of the game - 8.2 guys ! - rather than the obvious beta that beta for ass a lot evidently was. I was a fan going in m8, I wanted to love it, but there was nothing to love.
---
Or just join my paladin only guild Knights of the Light, and take on those 40 mans with 40 paladins
---
No, *I'm* Thex.
---
Your "migration" won't happen because classic players perfectly know what awaits them in retail. They quit it once already. And now you assume they will not only buy newest expansion but also MICROTRANSACTIONS? Just LOL.
---
this means people who farmed their pre raid bis would be last in line for raid upgrades
---
Nice. Now compare the cost of development of BFA with Classic.
---
Oh, so no evidence, sound argument. I suppose they will be blocking VPNs aswell? Again you are full of shit. I have been doing IT systems engineering for fortune 100 companies for 10 years. Keep trying to BS me.
---
This are really awesome! If you could do the mage class I would appreciate it :)
---
And my thexe!
---
Should make a legend. I had no clue ~ was for battleground
---
Dumb fuck. They are adding it in phase 2. By then everyone would be 60 if you played from phase 1. So it doesn’t matter. Christ. But you know what it does? It helps IMPROVE THE GAME AND SERVER. 
---
Dumb fuck literally telling a COMPANY to not MONETIZE THEIR GAME. Jesus fucking CHRIST some people are just stupid asf sometimes

Go fuck yourself.

Sincerely,

Rest of the playerbase

Warrior are one of the worst 1v1 classes, at any level
---
If your enemy knows what he‘s doing, you won’t kill anybody in a 1v1, except another warrior lol
---
Meant I have seen the post, not your specific comment
---
I told you what to Google. And no one is going to pay to play a private server through a VPN to some 3rd world country.
---
no worries we will! we are gonna cover every class before release!
---
Is this supposed to link to something? I don't see a key for the symbols.
---
Eh, theres a few points in the 30s where you can stop questing and just grind out half a level to a level on mobs with great loot tables to get mount money.
---
Usually results in similar xp/hour
---
We were, sent you a PM :)
---
Please do more.
---
Yes do tell!
---
Not this time man. I heard they made stealing illegal. Like, with laws and stuff. So, no more thieves anywhere. Nice, isn't it?
---
Lol
---
Same, but I was a kid so it was coke instead
---
Actually no, a majority of players that say they hate Retail have *not* played BFA, as shown in the survey census done on this subreddit.
---
Yep! Sent you a pm :-)
---
The wifey response was lit my dude!
---
Haha, happened a few times until the realized and started staying "oh man, are you still up?"
---
Funny I did google it and guess what NOTHING. Because there is nothing.  Millions of people use VPNs every day for many reasons.  My systems run billions of dollars worth of infrastructure but mid-tier huh? What magic law am I missing Mr. Lawbringer?
---
It's pretty and all but really lacking on information..
---
There was a Paladin on either Executus or Kazzak that was a level 59 twink. He had the rank 11 epic mounts. Not sure what rank he ender up on, but it was higher than 11!
---
Those numbers are not public, but it still doesn't change "BFA made more money in the first month than Classic is likely to make in its lifetime".
---
This is very  cool but isn't the arms emblem wrong?
---
That's why you don't join a guild consisting of slackers that won't keep up.
---
There's absolutely no way you read the entire Article 13 provisions in 5 minutes kid.
---
Gosh I hope this mentality will be a rarity. Obnoxious as all hell
---
It is, but since I already have one I’ll be enjoying it
---
Look how you got entangled in your arguments. Classic playerbase is so small so it doesn't matter, but SIMULTANEUSLY if a small portion of this small playerbase buys WoW Retail expansion its a financial success. LUL
---
Kid, I never said the Classic playerbase will be small.
---
You should get a petreon or a youtube channel and make videos on the process of making these.
---
Having additional loot distribution systems is a great idea in theory but much more complicated when you look at it from the potential problems side of it.
---
For example, a completely democratic loot system would reward social butterflies mostly. Productive but introverted members would struggle to obtain loot. Additionally, the potential for cliques to work together could influence the outcome. As an example, you could make a deal with several others to vote for them if they vote for you.
---
The closest thing to a democratic style of loot distribution would most likely be a loot council.
---
You could go Skinning / Herb to lvl 60 and then gather the skins you need for Crafting items. Afterwards, drop Skinning for Alch. for the later phases of Classic?  
---
That is my plan at least :)
---
A'ight. Peace.
---
Disclaimer : Every things in this comment is based on rumor/leaks so take it all with a see of salt. More like a "tinfoil hat theory".
---
In the other hand, most speculate that 10.0 will be big in term of change, when we see what is happening in retail + different survey, leaks and all.
---
And when I say change, I'm saying big one. The lore is slowy coming in place for a total rebirth of azeroth pre-cata and a level squish from 130 to 60 is highly probable at the begining of 10.0 alongside with a mix of old school talent tree + a "runes system" for special skill. 
---
If date add up and we have 4 to 6 month a phase in Classic then it's highly probable that 2 to 6 month after the end of Naxx, we will see a 10.0 made in order to attract original trilogy lovers and make them switch over retail.
---
k bye
---
Why do you have such a problem with my future troll shaman?
---
If you guys ever feel useless in this world, think of this post and that someone took his time to make it

I have a screenshot with full raid from around that time, should have mostly the same people:

OP mentioned it was a joke pull in the comments 😁

Just make friends with a healer and u can do 10 minute DM:E runs for some decent gold.
---
Alternativey grouping up with the same dude doing strat live runs and reserving crusader orbs/recipes.
---
u/litterlyabear started it
---
Why is this getting downvoted. Your every single word is true. Kids hate reading. End of story.
---
I don't have a drop-down menu on my Warcraft tab at all (so I can't even figure out how to choose a US server let alone Classic Wow).  Has anyone else had this and if so how do I fix it?!
---
Hey slick, I don't live in Article 13 land. Tell me again how EU laws apply to me? Or for anyone who does not live in the EU? Oh that is right, they don't and soon if you live in the UK they won't apply to you either. But thanks for clearing that up.  You really had me going there good job.
---
Don't worry I'm gonna name my character Thex so that other dude doesent get it
---
I don't necessarily think these addons should be disabled however, many top addons should have been integrated within the game.
---
In fact, I think future games ought to have addon support but also offer rewards for finding bugs and developing addons that are significant quality of life improvements that can be integrated within those games.
---
That’s nothing. I remember having 5 mil. Having my chaos bolt so 2 million. I think it was Legion?
---
I do you one better, I don´t know why Thex is and at this point I´m too afraid to ask.
---
We found the snowflake boys. Good riddance.
---
You should be able to easily hit Exalted with Timbermaw Hold while doing the [Winterspring Frostsaber grind](http://www.powerupguides.com/2019/05/how-to-farm-winterspring-frostsaber.html), unless you for some reason skip out on doing quest #2 or forget to do the quest chain that allows you to collect the Spirit Beads. So if you plan on doing it again in vanilla, remember to get that quest chain done and save all the Spirit Beads for revered, and you get your free Timbermaw Hold exalted.
---
Then as a reply to me, bewilders me more.
---
Who hurt you?
---
&gt;your ISP will be forced to block your access to them
---
Damn, love the smell of bullshit in the morning.
---
Damn, must have been a rich kid to be buying cocaine.
---
Consider not learning all of your abilities as some of them aren't needed for leveling. You can also get skinning and grind beasts, just vendor the skins here. :)
---
I guess humour doesn’t translate so well over text based communication but it was a tongue in cheek comment and not meant to be taken seriously
---
This.
---
People gotta realize that classic is a marathon, not a sprint.
---
If you get to 60 reasonably quick (say within 2-3) months, join a decent guild and attend your 1-2 raids every week, then you eventually will clear it all.
---
niger may get me a ban nick germany
---
Your comments was usually the thing that was asked on these posts
---
Get ready to have A LOT of friends in Azeroth and to lose all your friends not interested in WoW (lie to them, they will never understand why you skipped out on "guys(or girls) night!" to kill a dragon with 39 other people online.).
---
Roll a female character and have one of your female relatives talk on discord one time. After that tell your guild "I broke my mic D: so sad &lt;/3 give me loot or i'll cry." Best way to gear a popular class is to prey on lonely loot council members.
---
We can clarify the symbols more for the next one!  the green check means the class exceeds beyond others in that role, the ~ means its neutral, and the red poop means that it tends to be worse than other classes in that role (assuming the viewpoint of a newbie solo player)
---
Fair nuff.
---
I’m never grinding for that tiger again. But thanks for the tip.
---
Was doing gold farming and selling it to buy coke so I could farm for even longer.
---
You can surely get higher quality images for those icons right?
---
You won't need to be geared for MC and Ony xd
---
Hey kid, just because you don't live in the EU doesn't mean the laws won't affect you. If you already can't host Private Servers in the US and soon can't host Private Servers in the EU and soon any company that does business in the EU can't host Private Servers anywhere in the world, then Private Servers will die. Except they're already shutting down, so they're dead already. Go back to your mid-tier IT job where you just do what others tell you so real men can do more important jobs.
---
Andrew from Australia ahahahahahaha
---
Yes it is! We used wowheads classic talent calculator as a reference for the class icons, clearly they aren't accurate :P
---
Says the guy getting his posts removed for being "low effort" lol.
---
ye, i'm just going to enjoy classic wow for what it is, hopefully pantheon will be much closer by then
---
In your honor I will make Shaman named Thex on all the realms I can.
---
It's not bullshit kid.
---
I'm kidding, it's a joke...
---
The perfect system.
---
Warrior running DM:E with a healer or tanking strat live reserving orbs/patterns.
---
Except it is.
---
I think it's just that tad more disrespectful if the rogue just saps the hunter and skins the Dino while the hunter is standing there unable to do anything..
---
It should of been the Mortal strike Icon. The one you used is for assassin rogues
---
You guys are taking a healer??? They barely do any dps! Grab yourself another dps warrior!
---
Nope.
---
Priests are ok... Kinda slow for a long time. Spirit tap + shadow form help
---
No barbarians here and the warriors where plate. Not sure what game your referring to but this is classic WoW subreddit.
---
If you want to Pvp I would suggest Engineering (Mining / Engineering)  
---
I would personally don't go Enchanting without an Crafting ability (like Tailor / Enchanting).
---
I wish I was the Thex of my group, but I'm probably much more of a Samantha D:
---
You ever seen that guy at a party, the one that's standing in a corner thinking that he's above everyone else there but secretly he wished he had someone to talk to, so instead of just enjoying the moment and putting a smile on his face, maybe go tear up the dancefloor and have some fun he has to try and shit on other peoples good time?  
---
That's how I feel about OP.
---
Thex is back with my brand new invention.
---
You are overexaggerating, classic is not that hard, and dying by level 3? Dafuq?
---
Rated T for Thex
---
I was playing gnome arms warrior and i can say their racial is great. Use escape artist and charge just when mage used frost nova, blinked and is now casting fireball/pyro is great :-D
---
Tell me again how the new laws work in the US.  You seem confused.
---
I don't click, I code and build out hardware. 
---
The best part is you won't even admit you were wrong.
---
I am enjoying this. Thank you for entertaining me while I sit on my conference call with these DBAs in Asia. This is great.
---
Corey and Auckland.
---
Blizzard pls don't murder my mom.
---
Aw, /u/atheosuede didn't like that no one agreed with him and doesn't care if he unsubscribes.
---
A subscription should be enough.
---
Only an active sub! :)
---
Waaaaa I got downvoted.

It was probably a fucking shitpost like this one.

Stop begging for pity.
---
The US is being lobbied to have near identical laws by June 2020, which you'd know if you knew anything.
---
It's cute that you think your job is anything important or matters at all to this discussion.
---
Ho yeah I totally agree with you, it could be the plan but the plan will fail, people will go back playing something else or on PS.
---
Let's just hope that classic will be succesfull enough to justify a Classic + team or TBC classic.
---
thanks guys! big help!
---
This is not created using your own effort and we both know it. This is copied from the hard work of years of certain youtubers. Karma swingers.
---
i joined both stress tests, after they were finished however the classic option disapeared
---
Ah, the anti-addon knight.
---
They always sound exactly the same as the  anti-netdeck brigade in the magic the gathering community (my other hobby)
---
*Tips fedora*
---
~~wait for~~  return to a private server....
---
Good ones are already out there.
---
Nice try thex
---
I like how the first word of your comment concedes on your original comment completely. 
---
It's actually kind of funny that you actually believe Blizzard will just toss Classic in the dumpster after the last phase. Even if there is 0 new legacy content (which I don't believe is likely) Blizzard will more than likely just reboot classic over and over again and people will gobble that shit up; we've seen it happen tons on the private server scene to the point where Fresh is actually a meme. 
---
&gt;then a ton of players will migrate over to the new expansion, especially since a lot of its design will likely be influenced by Classic.
---
This comment in particular is entirely unabashed and wild speculation on your part. Blizzard hasn't even announced the new expansion and you literally have no basis for concluding that it will be influenced by classic.
---
That is so cool. Nice work! It captures the spirit of wow.
---
at the end of the day everyone has to pay their thexes
---
My name is going to be Oysi
---
party only
---
I was a Rogue so I got to skip a lot of keys (Scholo, UBRS etc.). I never did Onyxia or BWL, but I did get attuned without knowing just by trying to do all the quests I found.
---
I got exalted with AV, but I'm embarrassed about how I did most of it. I ran stealthed to Frostwolf Graveyard and afked there while doing something else and capped it whenever it was unguarded.
---
Every server will have one Thex
---
Go on do it
---
&gt; the whole point of Classic is to get more players in on the next expansion launch.
---
If you believe this, then it's also entirely fair to consider the increased revenue from expansion sales resultant from people switching over as proceeds from Classic.
---
Even in tbc our GM rogue had his actionbar in the middle of the screen, just so he could click the spells faster. We argued for 30 mins, him defending that its fastet to click than binding.
---
one reason for this is that (in general) only raiders go through the game so quickly that they need new content every few months.   So the new content is mostly raids. 
---
Casual players  (and I am not talking casual raiders, real casual players)  were still happy and not finished with all the world had to offer at lvl 60, or they were doing an alt or multiple alts.    I had a co worker who took a year to get to lvl 60, despite playing almost daily. He wasn't very good at the game, he had a ton of alts, he had really SHIT gear, but he still had a lot of fun. His wife played too, she was better.
---
One beak looted? must be fake.
---
Sure, but that still won't give Classic more revenue than Retail, which was the original argument of this entire thread.
---
Thexmhex is a good variant too I believe
---
why should the guild finance constant respecs?
---
You disgust me.
---
Great answer, thank you. This tread has made me much happier with the idea of going fire spec. If I end up not enjoying it then I'll just respec when I can.
---
Unholy is boring as fuck, definitely one of the most boring specs in PvE currently. Legion Unholy was way more fun, either gameplay around legendary bracers or Dark Arbiter. The current gameplay just feels clunky, dull and boring and it scales terribly. But it's broken in PvP at least, altough I'm tired of spamming necrotic.
---
Frost definitely doesn't feel like Legion Frost to me. First of all, BoS is still a preferred playstyle and as someone who tries to be competitive even with DK I just have to play it. BoS was the best playstyle in Nighthold, but it definitely wasn't that clunky. Breaths lasted longer a the whole spec felt way more fluid without GCD bullshit. Even after 8.2. changes the playstyle is just stupid. Talking about 8.2. changes, yes I admit the specs feels little bit better, but the only thing close to Legion Frost is that crit is the best stat again for me, so it means more KM procs. However crit was the best stat for me in Legion after 7.3. rework, when BoS got tons of nerfs and Obliterate was the best. The spec was fast, fun and fluid. One of the fastest specs ingame. Current Frost has still extremely low APM, even after 8.2. changes. And because we're forced to DW, the spec should be way faster. The current Frost just doesn't feel like Legion Frost to me at all, spells work differently, like PoF is completely stupid in BfA, GCD changes make the spec clunky and it's one of the worst specs in PvP since the beginning of BfA.
---
I mean if you enjoy the current version of DKs, you're a lucky person and I wish I could say the same. For me it's the worst version of DKs ever.
---
&gt; Sure, but that still won't give Classic more revenue than Retail, which was the original argument of this entire thread.
---
No, the original discussion here was whether or not classic would draw in between $400M and $500M in revenue over its lifetime. What you're doing is called moving the goalposts and it's dishonest.
---
Made it my desktop background
---
I see, thanks.
---
it's viable, bonereaver from rag and untamed blade from razorgore are broken as shit and they make for great slam weapons
---
No, read the entire thread.
---
i have. completed my rep with the two new factions, did some 10 keys, did the heroic raid, got rust mount all in about 2 weeks of non hardcore play.
---
what else is there to do i am missing that makes 8.2 so "yuuuuge"? mythic raiding? perhaps, but it seems a colossal waste of time when i can get 455 titanforged in the wild.
---
12 old me didnt have a clue on basic logic and understood minimal amounts of english.
---
This time I'm prepared better.
---
You can tank up to BRD lower with fury spec but after that you will need Prot for every dungeon until you get properly geared.
---
As soon as you have full 60 pre-raid or early raid gear you can tank as Fury again.
---
Drop down box at the bottom, click it, select classic, download,??? Profit
---
I was always tired after thexing - when I was young and now when I am old.
---
Imagine this tread not popping up 1572 times a day.
---
you are delusional, sorry if classic wow triggers you but this will be around for a long time
---
There are no raid wide buffs in vanilla.
---
pity there's also absolutely no way to circumvent isp level bans /s
---
Not available for me either....
---
Well yes, but the only real reason you'd wanna go deep ele is for the cast time decrease.
---
If you're just doing melee/shocks and maybe pulling with LB/CL, you barely gain anything from it.

Cloth users is recommended to pickup tailoring eventually. And I always create a alt leveled to lv 35 to train tailoring to max to get me bags etc.  the he BoP epic tailoring chests are great 
---
Enchanting is good as tailoring doesn’t need a gathering skill but it’s also very expensive to level. 
---
Herbalism/skinning/mining is a good gathering skills to have during leveling  either Herb/skinning or mining/skinning it gathers as you level so to speak. 
---
Alchemy /herb makes you save money when raiding as you can craft your own pots. 
---
Mining/ engineering - extra teleport, fun trinket, very good
---
I'm not sure why you linked me this, but I'm confused
---
You're spending 3 unnecessary points in Concussion for a 3% damage increase on shocks, which is only like a third of your damage at best. 
---
At the same time you're skipping Totemic Mastery, which is pretty much mandatory for any shaman build that can reach it.
---
 You skip a point in imp. GW which is one of the most impactful talents on the tree, while completely filling out imp. lightning shield - which is just barely worth taking if you have nothing else to spend points on.
---
On top of this, I'm a little confused about why you'd create a leveling tree for a lvl 60.
---
This subreddit has really gone to shit the last couple of days
---
When I'm really into a game my schedule can actually get extremely stable. I'm taking two weeks off when Classic comes and I plan to wake up at 8 every day, play until lunch or so, and then playing some more.
---
&gt; What's your first time I played Vanilla story?
---
Don't have one, did not witness it as a kid. Aside from PServers this will by my first Vanilla launch!
---
Lfg caused the interaction needed to form groups to go near zero, as well as the cross realm aspect of it meant that you would most likey never see the other players again so the number of rude assholes went way way up.
---
Heroic and up is not good. 4 difficulties take out all prestige from the raid.
---
I can only speak for Europe, and no, it doesnt happen in Europe. We do not blindly love our country and government, we are not overly patriotic, and politics is not a game for us.
---
I really dont understand this myth of warrior beeing so bad to level.
---
There is Drakedog, a famous warlock PVP player from korea i think.  
---
And then there was Nyhm, who made awesome WoW-remixes of populair songs
---
Blizzard! Please make TBC next!! I can guarantee my old guild of 250+ will come back and play!!!! ❤️❤️
---
Really fun little thing you are starting here, looks great! Would love to see mage
---
You mean Xxspehirothxx...
---
Shadow priests are S tier when it comes to 1v1 and the same goes for hunter when it comes to wpvp. In bgs warlock is probably the strongest of the 3
---
No way they were gluten free back in the day :O
---
This is super neat! But I feel like another good rule if software projects is "Do something you find fun as a learning experience" :) Just because it already existed doesn't mean I can't have a good time working on mine, without raining on other people's parades (which might be something you could try)
---
Fuck no.  People are dumb, and generally don't know how much gear someone has received in the past, attendance stats, or even understand what stats are valuable to classes other than their own.
---
Why would you want something like this when someone has already figured out some loot systems that work pretty damn well.  Democracy in mmos is a shit idea, but if you really wanted to make something like this on an external site it would be easy enough.
---
We are all Thex.
---
So a shadowpriest ganked you? Those muthafuckas can melt lvl 60's from lvl45 and on :D
---
So this is the thing we'll see spammed for the next few weeks, allrighty then
---
Is there a subreddit for wow Art like that?
---
The good thing about Menethil is that you can kill 60s. I guess something like Kargath comes closer as an equivalent.
---
Not sure what you’re talking about; could you break it down for those of us out of the loop and who lack the prerequisite intelligence to make sense out of legal documents. Also, who is Assmango and what does he have to do with this? Saw tons of comments on that video that “I’m here because of Assmangold” or whomever.
---
He literally didnt tho.
---
That discourages people from improving their gear outside nof raiding.
---
What’s Thex? Keep seeing that today.
---
I progressed in BWL with a fairly casual guild and sure it was hard, mostly cause half the people had never been there before but no one invested over 200 g on consumables, of course it was on a pserver but anyway.
---
I think it’s unfair to drag naxx into the calculation, it’s a raid that 95% of the population wont even touch and is at the far end of vanillas life cycle.  It just isnt as relevant to what he was asking.
---
The guy only wanted to know if he can raid in a general sense, naxx isn’t raiding in a general sense. And say if there are hardcore guilds that expect you to clear MC in 30 minutes each week I don’t think that’s what hes looking for either. Don’t go around scaring people away from classic with elitist standards. The game is for everyone depending on how and with whom you are playing with.
---
It's alright, I'll just take "Therealthex" and ruin your credibility.
---
Both Viscidus and Ouro were optional bosses, so most guild just didn't bother.
---
World first Ouro kill is actually dated after C'thun world first.
---
I was on Aegywnn but for pve. This ferro was on ysondre where I pvp’d. (Guess it was sort of a common name) On aegywnn I was a Druid named Uriel in rsf. (I did PvP in tbc on the Druid)
---
ROFL! You're not serious, aren't you?
---
I'd love to see a female Warlock :)
---
Get creative.

It's the most satisfying feeling when you gank someone like this, then they come back and die again.

But hey, atleast you stomp with a healer!
---
phwoar mate this is soooo good.
---
Does this one put Israel first too?
---
Those memelords that level a priest as anything but shadow are in for a bad time, too. Atleast after you get Berserker Rage.
---
I see it as payback for all the people telling us our class is shit.
---
Leveling as fire is fine, I personally prefer to level as fire.
---
Frost is just more efficient as you can more easily AoE grind and get more survivability.
---
I have a question regarding Warlock dots: Is pandemic in Classic a thing? Meaning will the remaining dot time up to 30% or so add to a refresh or is it completely being overwritten?
---
And make sure it is always placed above retail WoW.
---
Just running literal circles around them with Aspect of the Cheetah while getting nowhere on their mana bar because they can cleanse Viper Sting? Good times.
---
T H E X X
---
Honestly no we had a loot discussion in TBC in my guild 
---
And I argued that offspec gear for hybrids was important while others just saw it as a they got free shards as they already had better main spec gear.  
---
Example over 50% of the ppl wanted to shard a Druid healing wrist since then they got a chance of getting a shard instead of a feral Druid got a offspec piece that would allow him to help out in other roles.   
---
Democracy doesn’t work well in a group of 25-40 ppl.  There is a reason why the progressive guilds are very dictatorship styled. 
---
There is ppl who doesn’t understand that the group benefits from X they only tend to see I benefit from Y.
---
Okay, that's 2...what else? I want entire game to be fun, from 1 to max level, like classic, not just end game. I want an MMORPG to be a MMORPG instead of a single player game until you reach max level, get a guild and start raiding hardest difficulties. I want immersion.
---
I'm not sure how much of a serious player you are but engineering is pretty much mandatory as a warrior tank, so I would heavily consider that. And if you are taking the burden of being the MT then you should 100% grab engineering.
---
Maethor the Warrior from &lt;Endurance&gt; on Bloodfeather (EU) Alliance. Did some premades with him once, Arathi Basin if memory serves. Had a pocket healer with him at all times. would just charge in to a bunch and proceed to go big dick. He’d always be stood on the AH bridge in Ironforge or just in front of the bank. 
---
Think there was a R14 Undead Warlock too, forgot his name now but I think he was in the guild &lt;RUSH&gt;. Ganked me a few times when I was grinding Twilight Texts in Silithus.
---
I played a Dwarf Paladin at release. Did some MC and Onyxia before I got tired of trying to fight for a 5man spot with 20+ other paladins at any given time of every day. I then rolled up an Undead Mage on a PvP server. Played this mage up through the end of Cata. Cleared every raid dungeon on normal and heroic (except for Naxx 40, but did get 7 or 8 bosses before Burning Crusade came out).
---
So, I played both Alliance and Horde in vanilla. My conundrum is for PvE, should I go Undead for Will of the Forsaken (It came in very handy in PvE if I recall correctly), or should I go Gnome for Escape Artist and 5% int bonus?
---
Before you talk about engineering bonus as Gnome, I have no intention whatsoever to take up that skill. I am planning on Tailoring and Herb as I level, and possibly dropping Herb for Enchanting at 60. I was Tailoring and Enchanting on my mage in Vanilla all the way through Cata (Suppose he still has the skills, as I have not touched him since).
---
If I didn't get it right and you correct me I'll be thankful, so feel free to double check it
---
Someone said they were making a char named the on a post...
---
Other memes followed
---
My guild thought I was heterosexual for several months. Not that I encouraged that rumor. Must have been my deep voice in TS. 😂
---
Dot up and tank 'em.
---
Rogue is no problem in a 1v1 situation when you're a Paladin.
---
Well, wikis are public. It's already been edited.
---
Give me the rest !!!!
---
Please don't start by yoyo wassup guys it's. This shit is annoying as fuck. Rest of the video makes me want to play druid instead of rogue..
---
So how do you pronounce it? The + x, t-hex (as in t-rex), or tex?
---
Tbh I think they now exactly what to do. They got the numbers how many people are interested in. Maybe we are still a minority in the end. I wouldn‘t worry about it
---
We are all Thex on this blessed day.
---
Sadly its not :( 
---
Just got flagged for "trolling" and this is probably a forum bug. Still weird though.
---
Let's not do that, Activision must not find out Classic exists or they will want to milk it like retail
---
imagine how he would react when he got laid for the first time.....
---
Thanks replies, all. Nelf it is. :)
---
People are getting desperate. Trying to cling to every bit of content, they can find
---
Thexonfristdate
---
Thanks, I know about re specing cost, so probably priest, very capable in wpvp and ez slot in raid if healer. I don't want to go rogue just to PvP and then struggle to find raid etc.
---
Not stupid enough to say ;D
---
We can't all be like Thex
---
Thex for my orc warlock
---
I heard Thex is going to be a popular class
---
That won’t be in Classic. That’s pretty much confirmed. You won’t need to extinguish the ruins.
---
No, they need to do a Runescape and release new different xpacs.
---
Drakedog, Vurtne, Grim, Pat, Unbreakable, Alamo and Swifty come to mind. 
---
Then there are the newer guys from pservers like Payo, Esfand, Stormx, Monkeynews and Perplexity.
---
Menethil has a lot of high level players. Its the main way to Kalimdor.
---
No way to get a warrior off you. 
---
Also there’s literally no reason to level as holy. Your healing will be just fine as shadow, and you can help the warrior kill stuff, too.
---
Théx or Thèx, but maybe Thëx. Or perhaps Thěx? Thėx is an option as well as Thęx. Most probably Thēx.
---
Caps &gt; Faker
---
Argent Dawn Exalted is useful for Naxx. Gives you free entrance to the raid. Otherwise you need to pay to get in.
---
I never played a Shaman or warlock. I had a priest alt (3rd alt, so I wasn't great at it). I had dual spec of Disc and Shadow. It was a bit of fun, as I played a Cleric from 1999-2004 in EverQuest.
---
Getting gold from a fresh start like Classic, or back in Vanilla days, when they were rolling out new servers, it can be a little rough. Need the gold at Lv 40 for your mount + training, and then need another 100g for your epic mount + training at 60. Lots of people are 60 for awhile before they can afford their epic mount. But you can save a little money by rolling a warlock, as they get a free mount at 40. Shamans get Ghost Wolf Form at Lv 30 (not as fast travel speed as a mount, but it's something to help you until you can afford a mount at 40).
---
Another option is Druid. Feral dps (tank in a pinch) or Resto for healing (Balance spec in Vanilla.. lets just forget it even exists in Vanilla, ok?). If you plan to pvp at 60, you can go cat form to stealth around, and travel form is great for running the flag in WSG. As a Resto Druid, if you have good gear and you die as a flag runner, you're doing something wrong. I've seen 10 people trying to kill a resto druid in Vanilla, and it didn't work, the druid would cap the flag and run off.. If their flag was taken, the druid would just stand on the spot and just keep healing themself.
---
There are a lot of options and a lot of different reasons to pick a class.
---
Drood pls :D
---
First, no it isn't, but let's assume it is. The best estimates put the current BFA subscriber count at ~1.5 million. That would mean Classic will have ~4.5 million subscribers (unlikely for a full year, but again, we're playing along). If everyone pays the full $15 a month rather than the discounted 3 or 6 month subscriptions, that's still only $810 million.
---
Thexasranger
---
I would like to see the armor class as mail -&gt; plate (40) or something. Levelling to 40 is quite a chore in classic. 
---
Would also like to have larger spec icons, maybe the name in text too for readability. Right now I have to squint to see the icon. The red poo sign is also not the clearest, why not just use an X and maybe save that for extremely terribad?
---
overwritten
---
**Hunter**, because it's not that popular. (:
---
Haha thanks for the input Ino, I agree that many YouTubers probs start off that way. What would you recommend I say instead?
---
I hear the "let people play as they want" argument but my problem, and I acknowledge that it's just a feeling, is that if Blizzard put some of the most powerful addons as options in the game (tick an options and then bam, you have quest markers on map, tick another and you have big raid alert with big timer, etc) then people would lose their mind about how the game is being dumbed down and they wouldn't be calm down if I were to tell them "you just don't have to use that setting"
---
My point is that addons will bring many things that #nochange people hate but apparently almost nobody really care.
---
My Druid is going to be called Thexonthebeach so I should be good!
---
Where is the difference between contested and non contested areas?
---
I guess we are all going for variations of the name.  x and qt haha
---
Well I just got off the phone with the developers, they're gonna extend the phases for /u/Griffin90reddit. Amazing what a phone call can do!
---
He punched his way some of the way to 70, too (if not all of it)
---
If you are a moonkin in Classic .. chances are you will not get any groups and won't be allowed to raid.. Balance was just THAT bad in Vanilla.
---
Respeccing goes up 5g every time you do it up to 50g.  
---
I did this very extensively on my mage ...
---
3PM August 26th in the US (Pacific).
---
6PM August 26th in the US (Eastern).
---
11PM August 26th in the UK (and Portugal).
---
12AM August 27th in the rest of the EU.
---
1AM August 27th in Russia.
---
I could see it do decently if they made a new classic expansion tbh. We will just have to wait and see what comes from this if anything.
---
Hey man, Herbing is good for gold but have you ever tried DM:T?
---
I've already heard that. How much is barely any loot? Like 4 pieces?
---
imagine paying 75 dollars a month to play a 10 year old online game that you basically made into a job for you
---
It isn't 24:00 in Europe, it's 00:00
---
Why would you need expansions to play the game before expansions? Come on now
---
Sp33k l33t
---
Myndflame was a group of people that did some videos, like MC Raider, Illegal Danish Super Snacks and Zinwrath.
---
Oh yeah, i love hunters, warlocks and shamans! People often say those classea are easy to play. I say they are easy to learn but very hard to master. The skill ceiling on micromanagement is astronomically high
---
So you can only answer once
---
[There literally is an infographic / map to avoid confusion like this on the official WoW Classic website...](https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/template_resource/WXDU6S10E1191557767427831.jpg)
---
The game launches in Europe at midnight between 26th and 27th.
---
Shadowpanther for rogues.
---
I do you one better. Why is Thex?
---
If you want an example of what r/classicwow will look like in a couple months memewise, just go to r/2007scape. The entire community will absolutely cream at a trending meme and repost every bit of respect and originality it ever had out of it. 
---
They'll beat it like folk on r/2007scape beat their meat over swampletics. 
---
In a nutshell it's funny just because of how bottom of the barrel it becomes (the memes that is - the sub on the whole can be great and useful).
---
Can't wait for this obnoxious Thex shit to die already. You guys aren't half as funny as you think.
---
What does that mean in this case?
---
24:00 = 00:00
---
Classic is never going to have any new content unless it costs $60 and includes paid character boosts, name/faction/race change, cash-only mounts/pets/toys, and WoW tokens. There's no reason for Blizzard to spend their resources and time developing content for a version of the game that has 30% the revenue potential of the other version of the game.
---
Realthex
---
Ive just dont one for my own personal rogue  preference but i'd happily do one for rogues in general
---
THANK YOU ALL!
---
Does this one count toward mondays' or fridays' post ?  :p
---
24:00 and 00:00 ain't the same information, though - 00:00 of day X means midnight between that day and a previous day while 24:00 of day X means midnight between that day and the next day.
---
Literally who
---
Wow you must have posted something pretty spicy 
---
 show us lol
---
You share 99.99% of the DNA with terrorists. Guess you’re almost identical then.
---
A lot was different in 2005. There weren't nearly as many good games to spend your time playing. WoW Classic is not ever going to have 8 million subscribers, even on launch day.
---
As it probably never happened... yes, imagination would be necessary. :P
---
I think im going for Thex
---
Aw, someone doesn't know what a metaphor is. Poor baby.
---
watch your mouth baddy, shaman is viable in all 3 for pvp
---
1.12 doesn't really have any one top class that is ridiculously more overpowered than the others, which was common in early vanilla. It's quite balanced, which is exactly why they chose to have Classic only use 1.12
---
Rivendare himself looks an awful lot like Iggy Pop tho.
---
I want to see Warrior again :3
---
How is this relevant to world of warcraft?
---
I've read Day of the Dragon and it was such a bad writing I can't recommend it.
---
Uh huh, if it's that innocuous, then link it.
---
Doge
---
Dominic Germany, I don't wanna be a meme
---
What was your opinion?
---
also this is absolutley brilliant
---
I'm glad to see this is being talked about.  I've been assuming we'll see a sort of de facto devilsaur mafia that farms players instead of devilsaurs-- rankers in 3-5mans and some solo stealthers, ally and horde rankers mostly ignoring each other to farm everyone else; but lately I'm wondering if that assumption is too cynical.  I think the real question is whether zones/ camping spots get contested and if so whether the conflict plays out along faction lines or not.
---
Or to put it another way, if enough people just want to fight instead of maxing honor per hour, the whole thing might get really interesting and chaotic.  Otherwise, I think it winds up being boring and stagnant-- bored rankers camping, bored players hiding in cities and instances.   I'd love to see all the "I don't have much time to play these days" levelers gang up on the rankers who farm them...
---
I've been considering going RP to avoid all this-- I'd definitely miss the leveling skirmishes and sense of danger, but I think the pvp there might be better in phase 2.
---
Remember to post "who?" Or comments along the lines of "Wtf is a thex?" to make sure everyone knows you're too edgy for mainstream memes.
---
lol
---
In a 2v2, you will get rekt by a lot of class combos. Double hunter can kite both the warr and drain the healer for days. Mage can sheep one, rogue can sap your healer and stunlock them. 
---
It's not strong at all.
---
Whatever server TipsOut ends up on will be negatively affected by his presence. If he's blacklisted and forced to quit streaming or even playing, that effect is nullified.
---
I highly doubt your average player can tank LBRS as fury with at lvl 55-56 with leveling gear. They can definitely do it as prot though.
---
Same goes for Scholo/strat at 58 or for UBRS as a freshly dinged 60.
---
You can tank everything as fury AFTER you are properly geared.
---
Lives are for the filthy casuals!
---
If you think people will shift from Classic to private servers, that's absurd. People will always prefer playing on official servers than some bootleg with 90% chinese population and Game Masters that sell gold.
---
That is quite the coincidence! Did you ever reach your goal of FM?
---
In vanilla I think TBC rolled around before I rolled my first alt.
---
On my priest I did.
---
Lyme.
---
Well, given your choice of insult, here's another: your waifu pillowcase does not constitute a real relationship.
---
Or mage.
---
Only under 20% of players clear Naxx on private servers, and clearing it once does not mean you are Naxx geared. So no, not many will be fully Naxx geared.
---
About the journey I just wanna have people to chat with (or talk on Discord) and grind away like I used to do in Lineage 2, if possible in a group but otherwise alone. For me the quests are just an annoyance that I would like to avoid.
---
Eli5
---
God has this already been made a meme
---
Paladin auras in vanilla are just like mobile totem tied to paladin himself. Affects only party. Greater blessing affects class despite group. There are no castable buffs by players to affect whole raid.
---
Say that until aug 12 or 13 after people meme that got it
---
Yep, only a small minority even on private servers are able to get fully Naxx geared. It is a long and arduous task.
---
They literally said they are using 1.12 because all the classes are very balanced in it.
---
Nay. No Blood Elves is the single best thing about Classic WoW. The Horde is back.
---
TBC private servers exist.
---
I see, that is a pity. I guess I can grind dungeons as much as possible and do the quests in between to bridge it.
---
So what exactly do I miss out by not doing quests? Just wealth and exp? It must be possible to get wealth in other ways like flipping on AH or gathering I assume?
---
Trollgodx
---
I do not even have a drop down option. Might be because I've never had a subscribtion on my current bnet account - I hope this option will apear when I subscribe on the 27th.
---
If your really want to grind play frost mage and you can grind most of your way to 60
---
You will access WoW Classic through the same tab as Retail WoW, but you select Classic using the drop down menu above the 'Play' button. That's the same drop down you use to select beta and PTR realms
---
Hell no. Just release fresh servers every 2-3 years. I would much rather just play real vanilla repeatedly than some Classic+.
---
&gt;Dude you're famous ! Long live Thex !
---
Some streamer I'd imagine. No clue. Yawn.
---
And since this forum is US based and english the answers are likely already self selcetion biased making EU the bigger part really.
---
Ah the OOMkin
---
Source?
---
There aren't that many good games to play now lol, probably even less in fact.
---
Classic can and will easily have a stable sub count of 6+ million. The only reason it probably won't reach 8 million is that a lot of people who were into the game back then don't want to get addicted again and have it ruin their social life.
---
There are however millions returning, and millions of new players. Guaranteed.
---
Feel like so many people feel this way about this game. I remember times where all I could think about is playing the game and other times looking at the loading screen unable to play the game. It’s like anything in life use moderation. We would all love rank 14 and a black AQ tank but is it really worth the time spent? Idk love the game and will play way too much!
---
The only problem in pvp is that they aren't good against tabards, if they cast LFG on you then they are probably going to Goldshire.
---
Rag kill 1 week after release? 
---
I want that shit you're smoking, pal!
---
I think you're imagining a situation where random ordinary players will accidentally hit and surpass the honor cap, and suddenly the PvP community hates them. That's not something that happens. It's set so high that the only way you even need to know about it is if you're also part of the hardcore PvP community and grinding industrial levels of honor every day for 8+ hours. The cap has typically been set at something like 500-750k. The only ones who reach the cap are the players who benefit immensely from the existence of a cap. You're just not gonna see players who casually reach the cap and then break it by doing even more PvP. You get nothing out of breaking the cap, you just screw others over.
---
And how do i force the launcher to do that? as i stated in the beginning, i already attempted to shut down the launcher and reopen it to check for updates, also tried logging out and logging back in to see if that would do anything, nothing happened
---
Literally cannot wait to see a Thex running around in Durotar
---
absolutely no way lol
---
Yes but that wouldnt fit the post
---
Especially if they are from a big raiding guild as chances are their main will be raid specced and die horribly
---
10THEX=100G_XXTHEXFORGOLDXXTTV.COM
---
awesome
---
Thex loot. Thex get priority
---
3 pieces per boss. This makes epics epic though. Unlike the loot shower that is retail.
---
Play the free retail trial to get the hang of it a bit and you can fill shit out ;-)
---
It’s party people ;)
---
You hang out in the sun all day tossing a ball around or you can sit at you computer and do something that matters
---
If you go into settings on the app there should be a update icon
---
I think it's only 3
---
Alright, I will give it a try. For me MMOs are all about world PvP and communities. The reason I dislike quests is that I don't wanna have to try to navigate to where to go with a map, I just wanna smack mobs get levels and listen to books or people on discord then PvP until my eyes fall out.
---
I am guessing you don't follow the private server scene.  That is precisely what is being planned.  People are even leveling hunters first just to win the race before swapping back to their actual mains.
---
Thrextwitchtv
---
September 4 is day 9 after release. What's so unrealistic about that?
---
We're reaching levels of thexness that shouldn't exist.
---
Alright, well we will see how I like it. If I do not like questing I will simply stop and just grind and then do the required quests later on I suppose.
---
This one is not from me because my parents kinda limited my playtime... my friend got the wow UI stamped into his computer screen, this mean that while you are on internet you got an action bar XD
---
Thanks for the input, yeah seems judging by all responses that it could be viable but not as well for melee which is most certainly what I intend to roll.
---
Most quests coincide with grinding. They're not intrusive at all. Even PVP has quests.
---
Priest!

In the general tab?

When the first rag kill is weeks before Blizz expects it
---
I've never really seen horde in Menethil, it's so far out of the way, and not a very easy spot to gank in anyway, too many high level players passing through on their way to Kalimdor. 
---
Lakeshire always has at least one horde running around somewhere one-shotting Alliance. I don't think there is an equivalent for the horde. Stonetalon, Thousand Needles, Ashenvale all are potential gank spots for low level horde, but personally I've never really seen high level Alliance players in those zones specifically to kill lowbies. And all of those zones are shared with the alliance anyway, which usually have a harder time due to being outnumbered (except maybe in Ashenvale).

Sure it wasn't a Thex in the City quiz?
---
yeah, all I get is Thex too, no matter what I try
---
The only real answer is hiding around Blackrock Mountain as a shadowmelded night elf priest and occasionally tossing hordies into the lava with mind control.
---
Well the intent is not to pick a class for anyone but to help people make an informed decision. Obviously you shouldn't pick a class from just raw data alone. Class fantasy, playstyle etc. is important and highlighted in the guide as well. 
---
Also, it did help me pick a class after months of uncertainty :P
---
You can definitely do that, no problem
---
Warriors isn’t bad at farming. They just have trouble with instanced farming, unless you’re running with a healer.
---
Warriors got insane sustained AoE damage in Sweeping Strikes and arguably do some of the highest burst damage. With decent gear you can chain kill normal farmable mobs in the open world, much faster than most other classes. You can easily make 40-50g killing bats and blood elves while getting that random good drop and getting some decent/fun PvP as well.
---
I'm starting to think we might be from the same town...
---
That is true, I remember people saying that. But I suppose other MMOs have caught up to the same quality in the end anyway right. I think I've played/tried something like 20+ different MMOs by now and some must have had questing on par.
---
I was going to get Exonic but that seems too obvious. I could have "The Exonic" but that's too many characters... guess I'll shorten it and use Thex

I am Thex.

Then I'm going to PM you on Reddit and delete my toon right as you're about to make it so you can get your name.

I'd love to see Paladin! :D
---
Having the same problem, my only option is to install retail, there is nothing about Classic anywhere on the launcher.
---
When you guys are saying "extinguish the ruins" do you mean dousing the runes? because that will defenitely be in Classic.
---
Do you have a sub to retail right now?
---
We ran DKP all the way through Nax 40, and cleared it 4th in EU and 7th in the world :P
---
I want ur thex.
---
Then you did it correctly :)
---
Well those friends had clearly not heard of ConsolePort. It makes 99.9% of all WoW content playable with just a controller, even competitively. That includes healing in raids.
---
There was a guy name Thex that died in China while protesting nuclear plants being planted around  in Ethiopia. He was shot in the head 23 times by his mate Bruhtus. He was then gang raped by 10 law abiding white swedish men at a festival. Police arrested Thexs body and threw it out in the wilderness but two teenage black guys found it and became insane then started killing 3 people. They are now hanging around with a pedophile of a president eating cookies and drinkin wine.
---
If you are going to mostly grind, then pick up leatherworking in addition to skinning. You're going to have a huge amount of skins so that would help getting some better gear.
---
But how do you get gear?
---
I've the last boss (Alzzin the Wildshaper) has a mana drain spell and will likely aggro the plants in his room when pulled.
---
Glad you enjoyed it :-) Ty!
---
The blizzcon panel was amazing :D
---
They could just make a new server type for the classic like realms where they turn those off.
---
I still have yet to figure out my alts.
---
Time is money friend!
---
I like the idea and the alliance half looks great, but the horde side looks weird like it to small.

&gt; and people who support those are idiots.

And there you have it folks.

Ban well deserved.
---
Sure bud we believe you /s
---
Honestly I doubt these serveys will be at all accurate. Not for this subreddit much less the actual Classic population. I wouldn't worry about it.

Many will change after trying, many are altoholics etc.

This is great! Good job, OP. Really appreciate this. I hope you do more!

Is this the new faction for our almight leader, Thex?

It requires the same hardware as bfa... Code needs refactoring but not rewritten like bfa, assets were all there...
---
I mean we can disagree on it and say arguing about it is pointless, but then this whole thread is useless considering we'll never get the numbers from blizz
---
I love how well-intentioned this guy's post was and this community has turned him into a meme. Well done boys.
---
Bro rag is dead in 10 days max
---
They have to eat, sleep, level, repeat. And take a dump every once in a while.
---
Only time it happens is when raids change shard, invade your own and you're thrown out for the sake of balance.
---
Never really had any other sharding issue in WM
---
He'll no. I'm just not playing shaman, because I find totems annoying. Otherwise I would have played one.
---
You can never have enough of them.
---
If you don't play one, because of some statistics, then you are a fool.
---
Tons of misinformation here. I played a warrior back in Vanilla. They actually do have to eat after pull. You don’t have healing abilities like you do in retail nor do you have tons of instant spam abilities. You’ll die a lot as a warrior compared to other classes. 
---
Prot and Ret are very real in pve despite what all these people claim. You may even end up seeing Ret Pally with the Hand of Ragnaros. In fact, Ret Pallies and Enhance Shamans get priority over warriors for the Hand of Ragnaros because of there are better alternatives for warriors. You’re right warriors will have less competition compared to clothies because... only two classes wear plate as oppose to three for clothies. 
---
Warriors only shine in group PvP with a pocket healer. They’re one of the most dangerous classes in PvP if they get heals and dispels.
---
Yes, except they had to make BFA from the ground up, while 99% of the work on classic was already done.
---
Personally i'll never touch any of the new expansions and will quit the moment they start implementing the crap that i left for in the first place.
---
Same thing to me. I bought some game time and still it won't show any drop-down menu, only "Install".
---
?? Guilds have killed rag with healers being 56-60
---
he did say "all the realms I can" so that works! I hope you get your name though brother, I'm pretty sure it's gonna be fine, it's all good fun :) it's a good name and now it's famous haha

If you have Asperger and ADD it means you are not normal and what normal people should do does not count for you, especially if that's what you aspire (a good thing actually since it means you have accepted the fact that you are not normal).

Normal people are better off doing other stuff than spending 8-12h a day on a game since no matter how awesome you think the game is, you  *will* regret it unless you managed to still build up your career and/or family life.

You think they will but they won't.
---
You left out the # 
---
You will be downvoted!
---
You are worse than TipsOut and you kinda pathetic with your toxic stalker crusade.
---
No he doesn't lmao
---
I could honestly watch an entire documentary series on how they made WoW &amp; behind the scenes. Blizzard should have definitely done a whole series on it, I would've paid to watch it.
---
I'm a resto Druid and my friend a rogue, we plan on robbing Dire Maul blind.
---
AM/PM format is quite confusing, you know
---
I replied to find this later
---
im pretty certain most fury tanks go last stand...? 10 defense aint that much, most prot tanks skip that talent
---
holy hell, dem's some sausage fingers
---
And to think of the classic community is people mostly on their 30+
---
You're not multiboxung tribute runs rofl.
---
Even if you can somehow manage to get past all the guards, it would take too long to make it worth it
---
You're being ridiculous, I'm not going to make them tally up the 5 silver they get and divvy it between the group. It's a lot different than rolling on 1 chest
---
My bad 😥
---
Depends what kind of PvP. Warriors can’t win 1v1 except against bad rogues and enh shamans with bad rng. Same goes for world PvP and BGs. However, they become the best PvP class if they have a pocket healer.
---
There has been no confirmation it works like that in Classic. This is either questionable advice or a bad troll.
---
You're the scary and weird one cos you be any more of a tips zealous fucking hell. Your god emperor is a fraud.
---
This deserves far more praise than it's getting... 5 points to Gryffindor
---
This x1000. I've gotten at least 4 of my friends already ready to go for Classic, and these are people that stopped playing WoW during MoP.    
---
If Blizzard thinks that Classic is just some curiosity that some niche small amount of players are signing up for, they're out of their minds. WoW Classic will literally be the gaming equivalent of Classic Coke. Tons of people will go for it and the retail-team wont know how to feel.
---
Thnx
---
Wow I absolutely love this. Thanks for sharing with us!
---
Warrior is the first up on the class list when making a new character so most bank alts that are staying level one just go with warrior. The only poll I found that excludes level ones has Mages at an exact equal percent population to warrior, with hunters/mages very close behind.
---
People like you fascinate me.  Instead of spending all this time and energy trying to bring somebody else down, why not spend it on trying to build yourself up?  What do you gain if what you’re trying to doing here actually negatively impacts Tipsout (it won’t, but let’s think through the scenario)?
---
ding
---
That's why off-race mounts were pretty rare back in the day. I'm still going to do it. Run my dwarf straight to Teldrassil.
---
Every class has a counter, warriors just has more than every other class. The only class they can expect to take on 1v1 and win is maybe a rogue that can’t stun lock or an enhance shaman with terrible wind fury procs. They’re amazing work a healer but pretty ass without one.
---
I figured it out already posted in reddit how to do so
---
Unlike everyone in this thread the general consensus between everyone that likes maximizing leveling time is that its worth grinding 38-40 for mount money. Use google for best spots. "Just keep on leveling bro" is actually slower when you look at the bigger picture.
---
Blizzard promotes gambling to kids, triple dips their customers &amp; fires 700 people but you are fine paying them every month.
---
I couldn't give a fuck about tipsout but I care even less about his life outside of his content.
---
I’m already excessively annoyed by this.  Really hoping it dies off soon.
---
Well then go do that instead of joining groups.
---
Its not the same
---
Thexfux
---
Isn't the down like 7GB?, does not seem like it's worth it for a 5-10 min download.
---
Thousand Needles. Horde have a really lovely quest bottleneck at the top of a mesa in the middle of a hostile, heavily populated village of evil tauren. It's the perfect spot to camp greys, since:
---
1) the corpse run is extremely long
---
2) there is an escort quest with a killable npc that takes about 5-10 minutes to respawn
---
3) the adds respawn quickly and will finish off near dead lowbies for you, to inflict maximum financial hardship and humiliation
---
4) it takes forever for 60's to respond since nobody likes going to 1k needles due to difficulty of getting around
---
5) it is easy to escape or cheese other 60's due to being able to climb on top of tents and structures, making it difficult for melee to get to you or figure out where you are hiding 
---
With ~3 button presses you can inflict a 5 minute corpse run and a 10 minutes escort respawn on an endless and large group of horde level 25's-28's. You can shut down an entire zone, and nobody, not even a group of 60s can stop you from doing it.
---
I don't understand... Is that about the content you have to go through or the content you want to experience ?
---
Each expansion is a full reset for progression so you won't miss anything, and you may find parties to run the previous expansion raids or even solo any raid before it.
---
Even in BFA with 8.2 being available for a month now you could come back, use the catchup gear and reach raid quality gear in a week or two After reaching max level. For the hardest content it may take longer but if you join a Guild willing to help it could be done real fast.
---
It's such a strange phenomenon. Everyone is so combative now a days.
---
Yeah. I think I understand what he means, but might be better to get it elaborated.
---
It works it just doesn’t proc effects for players by sit spamming (Pally/Warrior had stuff I believe)
---
Don't say you will insta kick him, now we never will get his name
---
Well
---
1. The title of this book is mostly self explanatory here. If you care about the history of the Horde, especially the Orcs, then this book is relevant.
---
2. This book is about Medivh, so it's not super relevant to Classic besides the fact that it's a good history of the previous generation for both factions.
---
3. Another history of the previous wars, but again, we don't really see many of these characters in Classic and the ones we do are minor. It's mostly relevant to Blackrock Mountain and the surrounding zones, plus some Wildhammer Dwarf history.
---
4. Probably the least relevant as a lot of it takes place in Outland, but does have some important points about the Black Dragonflight working with the Orcs.
---
5. This is all about Thrall, so not very relevant to Alliance players.
---
6. This is all about Tirion Fordring, a minor character until Phase 6.
---
7. This is almost all about Arthas, which we don't see in Classic, but much of the world (and the Forsaken) is shaped by his actions before Classic. It covers a lot of the same time as the other books.
---
8. This book explains why the Horde and the Alliance are no longer at peace just before Classic, but has very little history in it.
---
9. This is all about Illidan, another character we don't see in Classic, but has a lot of Night Elf and Burning Legion history in it.
---
I can't narrow it down to just one and I don't remember how much I enjoyed each book, but if I had to pick just two for their content, it would be Arthas and Cycle of Hatred. That should give you a decent history of the 3 wars and events after Thrall and Jaina went to Kalimdor.
---
You... Don't have a shitbucket?
---
Most warriors in a raid will be tanking, and overall it's your own decision as a warrior player if you for some reason want to have a really hard time gearing up and decide to go Fury.
---
Dl was 4-5 gb and the update from America bnet to europe 300mb only
---
This is amazing
---
Yes.
---
Hunter. Raid when you can for tier gear, it's great for pvp and you don't have to fight for rare off-set pieces to gear up effectively.
---
Yes, they can. Here's a good example why: [https://youtu.be/yxs8vOWM2qs](https://youtu.be/yxs8vOWM2qs)
---
The slower weapons 3,6+, you'd usually go imp. slam. Because Slam is not normalized, so the damage is actually insane for single target, when you got a slow weapon with big swing damage.
---
For faster weapons, like 3,4 BRE or something like that, you don't go imp. slam, but rather as you mention yourself, fish for procs from BRE and WF.
---
Both of these work decently, but is still somewhat outperformed by 1-handed fury on your average raid, with the exception of a few stages where you either can't get enough hit or don't have access to good 1-handers.
---
2-handed fury really shines through at outperforms most other specs when a lot of AoE is involved, like a fast run of MC or the ZG run I linked. But even for single target, both specs can hold their own and is generally doing acceptable to good DPS, much more than the usual "gray area" specs, which people have second thoughts of accepting.
---
If a mage lets you catch up to them as a warrior then that mage is ass. Yes, a good warrior doing everything right may be able to beat a terrible mage.
---
Most huntards: sry didn't mean to
---
This guy: screw u guys I'm a huntard by choice!
---
But there's only 16 debuff slots, it's more likely he's just buffing sbolt
---
What seems to be the case is that blizzard is trying to avoid the 'dead server' thing with the layering system.
---
But yeah if you wanna avoid streamer servers I would check up on all the big streamers and see where they go.
---
Came for this. 
---
We had a few other PVP celebrities on Darkspear in Vanilla as well.. for the life of me I can't remember names now. 😔
---
Eternal Quintessence was added in 1.11 so that people wouldn't have to go to Azshara every week to get new Aqual Quintessence. So Hydraxian Waterlords reputation will definitely be required in Classic. 
---
The requirement was removed in patch 3.0.8 , since then you could dowse the runes without a Quintessence.
---
You have a choice whether or not you buy Blizzard products. The California taxpayers had no choice when Tipsout stole their money.
---
DPS warrior don't  use that much plate anyways and tanks should get all their plate pieces on ally anyway
---
540 runecloth takes waaaaaaaaaay longer than leveling 1-10, so I wouldn't say it's a hassle.
---
I..what? 6 years without a holiday?
---
What an empty shell of a life as a cog in the corporate machine.
---
Will you be able to resist talking about work on wow?
---
because you said so? oh okay
---
Holy pally doesn't need to reapec between raiding and pvp. I'd recommend it.
---
hunter next?
---
I dont watch TipsOut. His 10min videos about 30sec topics are pretty annoying. He seems like a cool guy.
---
I just want to point out that what the other guy is doing is worse than when he accuse tipsout of.
---
&gt; Thex
---
I keep seeing that word everywhere in this sub....Did I miss a meme? What is this about?
---
Classic WoW leveling/questing is like 75% grinding mobs anyway. You just get occasional xp chunks from quests.

He still has like 240k youtube followers. 🤣
---
https://m.youtube.com/swiftyirl?uid=hYDO3y5H14ow7WjKMpj-bQ

What
---
Beter to have some fun memeing than the regular "what should I play", "do I need to buy the game", "when during the 27 will the game come out", "is Hunter really that bad" posts. Well done guys, now let's hope blizz makes a Thex realm and we are golden
---
The beta is over so there is no current beta news.
---
Think of it this way.
---
It will take you at least 150h (if you're not a pserver fanatic) to level another 60.
---
Not even taking in consideration mounts/gear/professions you would want on your alt you could make 4500g in that time on your main (I think 30g/h is quite easy to achieve). 
---
Let's say your alt makes 60g/h you would have to farm for at least 150h for your alt to start being efficient (aka in 300h /played on your alt you would have made same amount as 300h farming on your main)
---
I would say if you want to have a alt for more than gold farming go for it. If it's strictly gold farming I wouldn't do it.
---
I will probably buy a starting capital with real money and then farm the AH. Done right you will probably have the same g/hr for 5 minutes of work instead of 60. I do enjoy vanilla farming but cant sustain a normal life when grinding at minimum wage in a game :P
---
People like you fascinate me. Instead of spending all this time and energy trying to tell someone how they spend their time on the internet is wrong, why not spend it on trying to build yourself up? What do you gain if what you're trying to do here actually changes my goal of informing others about TipsOut's true nature (it won't, but let's think through the scenario)?
---
Common fucking sense kid.
---
Kyan

...  I dont like it

"I'll be a bully" - sounds fun.

Its sad and pathetic to bring in politics and shit to classic wow. How sad are you? Seriously.

No, he did steal money, as the testimony in those court documents shows.

Million Dollar fraud &lt; slander.

Jesus fucking Christ man listen to yourself.

Amen.  Shits obnoxious as hell.

Say what you want but having clueless people in the community builds it.

There's no turning back in a dungeon without the group finder. Either you help out those who need it so that you can finish the dungeon or they continue to make the same mistakes.

I find 'celebrity' a fickle mistress on Reddit. 
---
Craft a well thought out post with proper grammar, appropriate research / sources and compelling argument on a topic that is relevant? 
---
-7 upvoted and 1 comment to the effect of "wut?"
---
Belt out a random thought while taking a shit that's riddled with errors and factually flawed or just plain stupid?
---
-Thousands of upvotes, silver, gold and platinum and a click bait news article explaining how your post set Reddit on fire.
---
Also, reputation.
---
Confirmation bias is a helluva drug.
---
seems like you just wanna bullshit whatever answer you can muster that also gives you plausible-deniability so you don't lose face.   
---
there's literally no reason that Classic can't do as well as retail other than your preconceived notions
---
Yeeeeeeahhh ❤️
---
Ah, I guess I mixed that up then. Good to know.
---
That's the meme
---
Is it really 6 PM? Source?
---
No they didn't. BFA was just more art and animation assets on top of an already working system. Classic required a complete rework.
---
Very hypocritical to write something off you've never tried.
---
After doing a quick youtube and twitch stat check on him, his growth has been insane on both platforms and will continue to go higher in 27 days so you are pretty much wasting your time because no one cares lol
---
If you go for last stand you lose on arms DPS talents.
---
The point is to be able to tank without sacrificing DPS.
---
A fury end-game or level up build never has any prot talents.
---
Probably one of the few changes I would like, but I am a meter whore.
---
When I think about you the words that come to mind is sad and pathetic. This is a forum about classic wow and you bring in politics and court cases that has NOTHING to do with classic wow.
---
&gt; there's literally no reason that Classic can't do as well as retail
---
Yes there is. The subscription is 100% of Classic's revenue while in Retail, it's less than half.
---
Don’t Dead Open Inside

This was by far the most clever thex-post. Love it!

I thought this was a poster for Cats.
---
Based on how worked up you're getting over this, I can only come to two conclusions:
---
1. You are TipsOut
---
2. You want to have TipsOut's babies
---
The most recent statistics thread (posted in this subreddit) with thousands of people as a pool to rely on would beg to differ.
---
Like Thex
---
I put in the correct launch date of 2005 (eu) and got "TIDY".
---
Baron Rivendare looks like a very intimidating, tranny knight.
---
Pretty much the stuff of nightmares.
---
I'm 50/50 with hunter or mage. Hunter aspect appeals to me having a pet and pewpew with bows and it's something fresh for me to play. Along with the solo potential of the hunter class does also. But as for mage... Well yeah it's a mage. AoE farming. Strong is every aspect of the game. So it's a tricking one for me. I know how mages play throughout the game. But with hunter I have little experience with them in vanilla. And I like the idea of playing a lesser played class, less competition haha. Let me know your thoughts mage Vs hunter! Thankss
---
Laughing Skull it is then
---
Thanks lol
---
Nothing wrong with dancing dwarf sprites. I miss guild websites...

Thanks for listening!

out of the loop what the fuck is this Thex shit?
---
What did I miss xD
---
 But won’t there be less demand if priest has such a huge representation?
---
Well, mine is the top comment in this thread and the video has a score of zero, so no, not a waste of time.
---
It will go slowly
---
Nope, only targets party members, if the target is in a party.
---
Yeah, let's go back to all the druid threads and pictures of people's desktops.
---
It’s almost like the game and genre as a whole was still in its infancy and they were trying to figure out what direction to go in. 
---
You’re the type that outwardly complained about all the gifts you were given at Christmas as a kid, weren’t you?
---
few will stick with shaman past the 20's, going off polls like that is meaningless 
---
as a shaman, you will get a place in a raid if you grab your prebis healing gear, and you will keep your place in the raid if you learn to totem twist
---
How much would farming Righteous orbs net you per hour? Given you reserve every one for yourself.
---
You are sad an pathetic. I honestly feel sorry for you.
---
The beta is over so everything’s set in stone at this point. 
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/hunter-beta-issues-update/223166
---
yeah agree fully, but thats also why its hard to say to someone else what he sould aspire to.
---
Yes ofc!  
---
Been setting up lists of gear of interest and special quests that are a must.  
---
Name, race, class etc are all prepared.  
---
Leveling areas and professions etc are also prepared.
---
Classic will also be flooded by players no on this reddit (mostly highly experienced pserver players). Trust me, there will still be a lot of hunters.
---
Jaie
---
I've heard this a few times and it just doesn't make sense in my head:
---
* You need to have tanks and healers at lvl 60 (they are waay slower to level than hunters). Sure, the record is a little over 4 days, but that's time-played on a hunter, many records are done using rested XP as well and do not include sleeping.
---
* All your raid group will be in mostly green and blue gear, no one will really of had time to farm endgame dungeons to get pre-BIS items (assuming the RNG gods even have the items drop that people are after), so there is a good chance you'll have people still using lvl 40-50 blues as their best items.
---
* You'll have little to no fire resist gear and no one in guild will have rep to craft it yet, this coupled with low quality gear of raid group will not bode well on damage taken (healers will have to take up the slack, but even they will be poorly geared also).
---
* Only 1 hunter will be able to get Traq shot from Lucifron, assuming it even drops, to get though Magdamars enrage.
---
* No one will even have the rep required to get Eternal Quintessence for dousing the runes to spawn  Majordomo Executus and in turn Ragnoros himself from defeating Majordomo. 
---
I firmly believe that some guilds might be able to get 40 people leveled up to 60 and even get into MC, but actually clearing it? I highly doubt it. 
---
I wish any guilds attempting it the best of luck, but I'd also warn them that a persons personal health, which could be effected from such long play sessions and sleep deprecation, is not worth it!
---
Hear me out, if you’re pro addons why aren’t you pro newer graphic toggling? “You don’t have to use them.”
---
Comes out Wednesday 26th
---
I'm working on the next one right now! Thanks for listening!
---
Speed running vanilla lol
---
No need for criticism for a "as close as possible replica" game.
---
I have played a lot of prot at 60 and I'm sure lots of other tanks do the same thing in that I never make a group with a arms or fury warrior. Thay bring zero utility to the group and 9 times out of 10 they have no idea how to manage threat and just sweeping strikes or whirlwind at the start of every pull.
---
Hahaha, deleting all your comments... you ARE TipsOut.
---
Thex is and has been the pillar of the WoW community since the original beta
---
EU - Daggerspine
---
there also wouldnt be a chest if there was no tank, healer and two other dps? If your class can contribute to the group, he should.
---
Haha I’m in exactly the same boat as you! Hunter vs mage. I’ve never actually played a hunter before, but of course mages are so strong and fun to play so it’s a tough choice.
---
Correct but I'm not here talking about tax evasion, you are. If you have such a big problem with tax evasion, you should be complaining about Blizzard paying $0 in tax for 2018 and not giving them money but you are. 
---
You clearly just have a grudge on someone and that someone being tipsout.
---
People got buttmad last time I posted this, but there are like 3 fights that aren’t tank-and-spank in the entirity of MC and BWL. Being Razorgore, Chromaggus and Nefarian. There really isn’t a lot to figure out in early raiding.
---
A lot of people THINK they are going to make a warrior.
---
It almost never turns out that way.
---
You think you are clever but you are kinda dumb. And pathetic.
---
I think I have watched this about 10 times
---
Time to upgrade!

No idea, tryin to figure out all of my work till the date so I can have holiday time at the release haha
---
Ah you will play alliance, thank you
---
Yes... maybe sooner. There will be entire guilds no lifing it to 60 by day 5
---
Idk, seems like there's a lot of variable you're leaving out just for the sake of doomsaying.   
---
you're assuming that classic will have the same amount or less subs than classic, and you're also assuming that classic won't ever get a shop of its own. What happens if classic gets 3x the subs than bfa? the peak sub number was 14 million, drastically high than it is now.    
---
while I don't see classic ever reaching vanillas/BC sub numbers, I think its way too soon to write-off classic with statements like "itll NEVER make X amount of money" before its even had its first day. I personally have gotten half a dozen people to prepare for classic and i'm just a casual.
---
&gt;Scatter Shot, ....., and Freezing Trap share diminishing returns

I wonder was their 'reference client' is running, because this sounds completely wrong to me.

Hey Swede Boy, isn't slander against your moral code? Go kiss your TipsOut poster and leave us men alone.

Luckily this subreddit isn’t representative of the ‘classic experience’, so it definitely wont.

Your lack of vision isn’t our problem.

Go on like a pc subreddit and ask for best budget laptop for 500

the old witcher movie (the hexer), he got cat eyes so close enough.
---
Huh... I didnt notice that. Thex alot.
---
Let's just say I meant his player to be the civilian... that sure would work
---
Accurate.
---
What is it???
---
I dont even watch TipsOut. I watched 15 sec of this video and closed it. His 10min videos about 30sec topics are annoying. He seems cool though.
---
You are just pathetic.
---
My advice for hunters regarding attunements....
---
Get a group of friends and a guild before you hit 60, and rope them into doing the attunement/key questlines with you so you don't have to try and beg for a place in pugs. An easy way to set yourself apart from the crowd early on is being prepared to enter MC or other instances, and you will be absolutely astounded at the number of goofballs who rushed to 60 but have no clue or ability to get attunement stuff done. 
---
"I have key" = free ticket into a party that may not have otherwise wanted to take you, a hunter. At that point you can prove your worth by multitrapping and showing off aggro bouncing games with pulls which will leave people scratching their heads but eager to have you back since of how simple a hunter can make the worst pulls.
---
You'll have epic mounts for all in a week if you live in strat live, won't need to wait for phase 2!   
---
You could always level 5 hunters before phase 2 and have them all solo runs to the end boss then do the last boss 1 at a time lol
---
While this seems to be a joke pull, i can say that you got essentially the same thing MANY times in real pulls too. Ppl gathering around the corner, someone jumping around there. Accidentally jumped too far. 
---
ZAP. \~1500g worth of consumables gone in few seconds.
---
Chuck Norris jokes are no joke! Take it back before he finds you!

Absolutely. I just thought it wasn't totally absurd is all
---
My original shaman was named after what I had just eaten.
---
Don't worry my dude, this was my first thought as well, but every time I feel like harping on reposts I just remind myself that not everybody no-lifes the classic WoW reddit like I do.
---
Well yeah, I'd get sick of watching myself on YouTube too. Hope you end up having to file for bankruptcy again Mr. TipsOut!
---
I think I'm going to roll a shaman named Thex
---
Got it narrowed down to anything but mage or warlock :D
---
But there are 3 weeks to narrow it down further. Sadly I am too torn between playing a strong class and playing for fun.

I once saw a video guide about this farm, and the guy said you can do it in preRaidBiS, dont have anymore informations tho
---
I will miss the jump during Wailing Caverns.

I will get lost inside the Sunken Temple.

I will buy an expensive item on the AH just to remplace it 2 hours after acquiring a better one after a quest.

This is actually good name :D
---
Hey man, this is exactly the feedback I'm looking for. My thought with the Paladin rating is that they can be pretty nasty for melees to deal with but you are probably right that they should get a small nerf in their rating. My issue with the WPVP rating is that I am contemplating making it into dueling/1v1 instead since world pvp is such a broad term and can mean so many things. 
---
The warlock thing is tricky though. I would rather rate them from potential than ''your average warlock'' and a well geared, well played warlock is almost impossible to deal with for most classes(imo). Again, WPVP rating is just so hard to rate and maybe I should make it into dueling/1v1 or at least add that rating.
---
Because you are contributing so much less and the rest of the raid is picking up your slack just because you want to be a special snowflake.
---
I'm just looking forward to the story of the guild that will claim the world first Rag kill way before everyone else. I feel like we're here talking about how its impossible while some guy is going through excel sheets trying to organise probably 60 people into 5-man groups for speed leveling and assigning everyone a job so that they can make it before everyone else. 
---
We've seen that ridiculousness with Battle of Dazar'alor and Method recently. Those guys grinded their brains out all throughout Christmas just to get a head start on neck levels because the defensive traits are so powerful. They leveled up multiple professions only to craft the gear, equip it and then destroy it, just so they can trade items. They had to empty the AH from 3 different servers for that to happen. They also bought BoEs from all servers. They went into a 10 million gold debt for that world first Jaina kill.
---
You forgot the part where you called blizzard and claim that you were hacked not because you bought gold and gave away account information, but some other mystery way.
---
Your not a man. You may be male, but you are not a man.
---
Usually when choosing character names I just close my eyes and hit random keys. Just tried it and got 'Thex'
---
This aged well
---
Probably more likely going to struggle not to talk about WoW at work
---
Dude, its just some meme that will be here for the next 2 days and then everyone will forget it. Either go with it or dont. Its not like the entire sub is full with Thex.
---
If you’re already playing each expansion they’re not exactly capturing new market share by getting your business.
---
Sadly, I think 1.12 is when they stopped entrapment from having a chance to 'tick' on every pulse of frost and explosive trap, but rather on the first pulse only. Still an amazingly good pvp talent and one of my favorite in the game from back then.
---
So if the peak of Vanilla was 7.5 million, and as of Oct 2018 the subs were at 1.7 million, you really don't think Classic could EVER beat retail? really?   
---
1.7 million was the number Blizzard released in 2018, and if so, that's pathetic considering what their potential could be.
---
You dont need a full raid and you dont need all lvl 60s to clear MC.
---
20-25 60s, rest 55+
---
You dont need fire resist. You can farm trash for the rep.
---
Its already been done on private servers it will 100% be done when classic launches (rag dead inside first reset)
---
Tax avoidance =/= tax evasion. What they're doing isn't against the law and doesn't steal any money from taxpayers. What TipsOut did *is* against the law and he *did* steal money from taxpayers. Besides, there's no sense in comparing a multinational corporation against an individual, every single corporation loses that comparison. But compare TipsOut to any law-abiding citizen and you see him for the piece of shit he is.
---
R/woooosh
---
The sad thing is that I dont think you are trolling.
---
You are stupid enough to think TipsOut would talk about Swedish law and recruite for an EU guild.
---
moron
---
Some guy that made a post 2 days ago, talking about his name
---
r/woooosh
---
Is there a resource to look up what the casting and movement animations are for races?
---
Why would you give away your account information while buying gold?
---
Hahaha true! Thex!
---
Just remember arrows/bullets are a thing.  Be prepared to pay a decent amount for a big quiver and maybe take engineering to make the best quality ammo.  One of my least favorite parts of a Hunter back then.
---
Thex, a true legend is born
---
Cute
---
I dont have to wake up the next day and go to work which is nice
---
Yeah maybe because I don't have gsync. It wow could be due to the fact that my 120hz monitor was old and kind of crappy.
---
Mom! Toilet!
---
Integrated graphics card since 2013 (HD 6000 e.g.) will play the game at 60fps 720p.
---
So you could even go for a cheap MacBook Air if you preferred Apple. Otherwise any Windows Laptop will do fine.
---
If you want more performance look for integrated graphics NVidia 950m and greater.
---
making a Thex on 3 different servers
---
Blizzard stopped releasing subscriber numbers years ago.
---
Are you really this dumb? Seriously?
---
&gt; Traque
---
Thanks. Plenty of evidence is available of DR on scatter/freezing. That is disappointing.
---
Yes I have decided! Thought long and hard about it. I'm definitely going Troll Shaman. Don't spread the name around but I believe I'm going with Thex as the name.
---
You could also add a field for difficulty or skill ceiling. I feel like warrior requires a lot if you wanna play it optimally with stance-dancing etc vs e.g. a mage that is just spamming a rotation.
---
Hahahah true that fam
---
Racism. Spectacular.
---
You'll be okay.
---
Well I can tell you something about rank 14.
---
I had my regular PvP group back in the days and we were grinding heavily. Like 6-10h playtime a day for months. If you want to make the jump from rank 13 to 14 you have to do about 12h+ a day for one or two weeks.
---
We had 2x rank 14 and were one of two successful Horde raid groups on our server. I myself only reached rank 11. To make it to rank 14 you need massive help and arrangements with other PvP groups. Even with the other faction. Most of them only made it with heavy account sharing.
---
Now you are prepared
---
12 days to decide if reserving a name matters
---
That server must suck ass. I wouldnt trust any testing done there.
---
What is that "Thex" thing, can some1 please explain, ty
---
xxThexx
---
Trying to reduce the number of people that will name there shaman Thex so you can get it on one of the servers.
---
Smart move
---
Yeah that makes sense. I get you every class has 'something' to consider which is why this choice is so hard for me! Mages being have to drink all the damn time having downtime after pulls etc
---
Just go back to the survey, you will get a message that tells you that you've already completed the survey. From they're you can see the results.
---
Yes they did have to create the assets and piece them together. 
---
They had to make the new zones, quests and raids from scratch.
---
Even with reusing existing ones it takes a lot of time, while for classic everything is already there.
---
You can't be serious in thinking the effort is even close to being the same.
---
A 1,000 year ban is deserved for calling people idiots? what kind of weak-minded, over-emotional, over-sensitive snowflake of an individual do you have to be to even think that calling somebody an idiot deserves a ban at all? Yikes.
---
Uh, many of the top private server tanks go fury - prot.. idk where you get ur info dude
---
Druids are gonna be the corridor creeper of classic wow.  In vanilla, there were a series of events that led to warriors being "the tanking class".  In classic, it's going to be less about the class and more about the players.
---
Mmm, yes...  If there is anything I'm sure of it's that this guy deserved a ban.   Why?
---
https://imgur.com/Q570Zxs
---
Because I've also been banned for 1000 years and TRUST me it takes A LOT to get to this point.  I mean A LOT
---
You care, that’s two replies.  Three means love.

I did seconds left / 1.5 to get number of gcd left

/hug
---
I have been 50/50 on mage / druid for so long. I think I finally have to concede I want each I guess. Mage will be more useful as my main since I have a guild so I think I will rock that UD mage life.  
---
and then for casual friends / alt gonna go with the druid.   
---
Lets see if that lasts the day
---
I tried TW before, could use an English client. But, it was still difficult since I couldn't understand the chat. I'm in Japan and debating between okay latency and playing with non peak hours folks to the USA or OCE with worse latency, but can okay during their peak hours.
---
I was to lazy to make them template in my own and I thought it would be funny If I leave the iFunny Watermark^^
---
The costs of developing BFA versus Classic (not including marketing) are likely much closer than the revenue of BFA versus Classic.
---
As long as the manufacturing date is later than 2004.
---
True :)
---
The best part of Mage is that when you learn new Conjure Waters, you summon *two* at a time, so you'll be conjuring them 10x to get a stack.  Every level you gain, your Conjure goes up by 2, so eventually you'll be pulling 20 at a time, but you'll also learn the next rank by then, so the process resets.  Leveling with a mage friend, he wouldn't even make water for me until he was making 10x at a time.  I *think* that at level 60, you only make 10 at a time of the top water, but I'm not sure if that was patched or not.
---
&gt; As in, will players be acting in accordance with wow lore and be in character?
---
No, not really. Much more like: 
---
&gt; Or will it be a bunch of randoms roleplaying in ways that have no association with the Warcraft universe?
---
RP servers are just a place for people that like that aspect to congregate. There are no rule enforcements that require you to be in any sort of character or even roleplay at all.
---
Prot isn't all that good at pvp. Druids are way better as flag carriers. If you are talking about world pvp then ~ is still pretty flattering. Warriors are pretty weak outside bgs.
---
when the Countdown is at 0... Thex will arise.
---
Have you considered rolling a Thex? They have the best racial for pvp and pve by far.
---
Yeah I remember them days. Sitting in a town making a bunch water for the journey ahead haha
---
There is that too - for those interested anyway
---
Ah yeah I meant august
---
Thexalted
---
Ion released a statement saying that all troll shamans will be automatically named Threx, disregarding normal naming convention of only having one name per server.
---
XD - More like I can throw that 7 bucks in my coffee fund for this week instead of setting it aside for a wasted subscription =P
---
Look at the gaper on this guy.
---
Fire is actually the better leveling spec if you dont plan to aoe grind. Though you will be an easier ganking option on a pvp server.
---
Theriously?
---
Blizzard has been radio silent, but I would expect that is because they are working hard to get everything ready for launch. I wouldn't worry too much about it.
---
Only of you care and your name is something like 'Legolas'.
---
As far as I know the server list absolutely has to be released for character creation. Names are only unique per server, so it would be a mess trying to reserve against the entire player base.
---
They have a pet that can tank, aren’t reliant on mana, can heal themselves, and have aoe. Yes they farm good just fine if grinding your face into mobs is something you’re interested in.
---
*Let'th
---
And I've explained to you why that point is baseless. During the time that Blizzard released sub numbers, you could figure them out yourself by reading the earnings calls and dividing by 15. Now you can't, so Blizzard stopped releasing them because there's absolutely no reason to give away that information.
---
A lot of people complain about hunter being full of bugs and being 'bad'. I like to 1vs1 duel a lot, is hunter good in duels and can beat all classes if skilled?
---
You should focus on doing at least some quests if you are solo leveling. Just because you are doing quests doesn't mean you don't grind, leveling is really a mix of both.
---
Grind on the way to and from every quest you do always be killing stuff and using your resources while doing the quests you have. 
---
If all you want to do is focus on killing stuff and not have to worry about quests I recommend you try to find a party and do the 5 man dungeon leveling strat that's been going around here recently. You basically just spam dungeons and kill all the elites inside as quickly as possible over and over. Probably the closes thing you can get to 'only grinding' while still being efficient.
---
Gz
---
Oh no he called them idiots 😢
---
Sure, which means "the server list doesn't need to be out until the 12th".
---
Find a guild, pushing group or do harder content? I have never met a group that is doing atleast +7 and they give up after 5 minutes of waiting.
---
what's wrong with streamer servers?
---
I think what the other posters haven’t addressed is your fear of “playing a rogue and warrior will be somewhat same-y.” This isn’t true at all in pve and worldpvp/bgs. Warriors are the go tank so that’s one way to spice up pve and then in pvp a 2hand warrior is going to want to view a battle much more differently than a rogue and your playstyle will be different as well.
---
And as the others have said, it’s really hard to live out your paladin fantasy until expansions like TBC. You can but it would have to be as a main not an alt because you are going to be the most inefficient tank option in 5mans, your bis for raid healing, which you will never tank, isn’t even set pieces, and you will only get pvp 2handerd from raids as a thank you for consistency on showing up to raids; which will be hard to do if you are also playing rogue. And then you will watch a warrior youtube pvp montage and go why did I spend all this time to do a fraction of a fraction of the killing power of a warrior.
---
Get a life
---
Need to reserve all the cool named that go hand in hand with PvP titles, like Private Detective.
---
I did rant a lot in my posts but honest to god they put it under "trolling" when i actually wasn't. 
---
What did you end up doing for your ban?
---
Warlocks can farm both East and West sides of Dire Maul very efficiently once Phase 2 launches. Farming Satyr packs in East w/ Enslave Demon is a great source of felcloth, and in West you can efficiently clear out the treant packs &amp; invisible ghosts for class books and Nature/Shadow resist BoEs that will sell very well once AQ releases.
---
Maybe They used Furbolg Med Pouch before Block.
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?item=16768](https://classicdb.ch/?item=16768)
---
Why are you suddenly changing the subject?
---
I'm not worried about it either, but the people who are working to get everything ready aren't necessarily the same people who would be communicating with us, so it's a little weird.
---
My experience with RP servers in vanilla was that it was mostly just a place for people into role play to congregate. There was role play campaigns ect going on sometimes but it wasn’t really related to wow lore from what I observed. There was also frequently a lot of weird shit going on with naked dwarves in chat.
---
This, basically guy started a thread asking what people were going to name their characters, indicating he wanted to make a Shaman named Thex. 
---
Every comment and subsequent post effectively indicated they too would be naming their character Thex.
---
Wtf I woke up banned with the same message as well. They didn't even bother to give a reason / quote rofl
---
This client will likely be used for name reservations in 2 weeks time. Having it pre-installed would be a smart thing.
---
Granted it’s still early, but some people may be in a position where downloading 5GB now in important to them if they have upcoming trips planned which may result in uncertain download speeds the days leading to name reservation.
---
if your game is doing well, better than the competition, then there absolutely IS a reason to release those numbers.    
---
literally the only reason they cant/wont is because they're not confident that their current sub numbers beat out other MMOs like FF14.   
---
If I have undeniable and confident proof that I'm stronger/faster/better than everyone else in my group I'm competing with, I'm going to share that info. People that are winning generally aren't humble about it, especially when there's millions of potential dollars on the line.
---
Yeah i have a long history of making new posts the day i get unbanned and blizzard would check my history and pretty much refresh the ban again if people flagged it. 
---
My last ban fell under "trolling" so they don't really have a reason to ban me they just didn't like my attitude.
---
Not exactly. The interview published two days ago said there's a hardware rollout required for Classic. Blizzard doesn't own or even touch that hardware, it's all leased from AT&amp;T. They could be completely done with Classic and ready for launch and we still wouldn't hear anything because the AT&amp;T hasn't given the greenlight on the hardware.
---
Fucking Thex
---
I really hope nobody takes the name though :/
---
Off I go to Make Love not Warcraft once again.
---
This and wpvp/ganking will be somewhat forced in classic. People think vanilla was like this so they attempt to make pservers into what their child memories created, or into what their older brother or friends told them it was like. On the racism note, I worked in foreign languages at a university for 3 years, never met more racist/prejudiced folks than the europeans I worked with. All turks this, arabs that. Dont even get a german started on turkish people. In fact, between the africans, europeans, and asians I worked with, the only folks who never complained about anyone else were the chinese students. They were always chill.
---
&gt; you can kick them and find another DPS within 5 minutes anyway.
---
Remember, you can't instantly replace people with LFG in Classic.
---
Tbh I got a mistake like this one a couple of days ago. I tried to give retail a chance again and started playing as an undead. They give you a companion at the beginning and I honestly thought he was another player. Actually I was happy someone was talking in this game again. I was wrong
---
If they dont delay it before the character creation I wouldn’t worry about it.  Super unlikely either way. They’ve prepared everything and all of their logistics are set for a Aug 26/27 release. Too close to delay now IMO
---
I would be surprised if it can't run it, but I can't say for sure whether or not Blizzard would "block" older systems for some obscure reason or for some sort of compatibility reason (e.g., something to do with Direct X and / or your Mac/Windows version).
---
Hi, /u/LiterallyABlackBear

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cknlxq/as_requested_by_other_users_yesterday_i_am_the/). 
---
I 100% agree, but a few months from now when you're forming a group for BRD and a toll shaman named Thex sends you a whisper you will probably chuckle a little bit.
---
It has nothing to do with humility. You never give away numbers that can't be confirmed from outside sources. That's business common sense.
---
I never really did anything specifically related to this myself m but I’m like 90% sure I remember Chinese gold farmers in vanilla farming that shit to kingdom come in mixed world drop blues and greens.
---
You can get laptops with uhd graphics that will run retail at 720p with low settings, where dungeons are playable and raids unplayable with 10 fps.
---
My point is, just saying just get any laptop and you will be fine is not good advice.
---
Spamming flash heal is inefficient, its better to use your max rank slow heal+ renew once tank is around 50%. Id save flash heal for emergency’s or healing a dps.
---
They aren’t really mistakes if you PLAN to make them. It’s just you planning on being a dick.
---
I will go shaman this time. A peaceful tauren who does herbs and heals his friends. I always liked this theme but never played horde back in the day
---
Private Mousepad reporting for duty!
---
But lets say you have three melee's on you. Spamming rank1 shadowguard might stun multiply targets (cus they all hit you)? Instead of spamming SW:P rank1 and tab-target spam? More global efficient with shadowguard?
---
OP openly admits to insulting people for disagreeing with his opinion...
---
You dont see an issue with that?
---
99.9% of laptops at £500 are good enough to run raids. Especially raids in classic since they weren’t near as challenging graphically as retail. Hell you can get a laptop with a 1050ti in it for a little under $500 and it’ll run perfect. It’s cheaper than his £500 limit since a £ is more than a $.
---
Yeah that would be prudent and neat
---
I mean... isn't that the whole point of streaming?
---
Just dont flame and you wont get banned. It really is that easy.
---
There are a quite few very positive streamers like Grubby (the WC3 progamer) who kick and ban all negative nancies who need to resort to namecalling to bring across their point.
---
I wouldn't want you in my house if you start to insult me either. 
---
Therefore good riddance.
---
What was this series of events?
---
Why do you hate fun?
---
my latency to oce is around 180 so i might consider it, although i would prefer to play on a server with sub 100ping but the only choice is tw or kr it seems
---
Gm said that was the stress test client and that the classic client would be released in a few weeks.
---
Oldschool
---
I bet illidans fel eyes make everyone look like john cena. 
---
Because he can't see them.
---
First time I played was on a korean beta server. There was a guide with pictures how to get in.
---
I played an undead warrior. I couldn't read any-quest-texts or anything else so I just grinded mobs. The game got increadibly hard  without any new skills and only white trash-gear. But being a warrior actually helped as they are not so dependent on new skills.
---
I also remember getting completely lost in Undercity and not finding a way out for 2 hours. But I found a vendor there that would sell me some white weapons, which were a big improvement.
---
I made it to level 15 this way and someone actually grouped up with me in that area south of Tirisfal.
---
After that I read how to use the korean beta with an english client and rerolled.
---
Actually being able to read stuff was tremendously helpful! :o
---
yep, they'd literally have to delete 75% of the game's systems lol
---
This is actually genius
---
You mean guild Thexes, right?
---
Maybe because you're wrong.
---
Aye. No blue post in ages, no nothing.
---
Thex is what we got, and we'll milk it until it's getting tiresome.

We ain't there yet.

From menethil harbor you take boat to theramore, jump off right before loading screen far less swimming to die.

Awesome job! Great style! I’ll surely be rolling Orc war as well! Maybe cow...
---
The Burning Crusade launch was pushed back, but it was announced almost a year in advance. I can't think of any since then.
---
they could simply spend 30% of the money they would spend developing something like BFA, and bam problem solved. a lot of the money spent developing the modern stuff is on pointless shit anyway
---
Give it a wait
---
I see a lot of comments concerned about keybindings. Are they really even needed at all... could the chat not use abilities by typing the corresponding /cast command in the ingame console?
---
It has happened already.  There have been many private vanilla servers and this happened on them.  The same player base is going to be on classic.
---
The newer classic players will be learning from them
---
Great thing about playing in the past is that you realize that your first char was a pretty shit class, race, class/race combo, and you weren't clever enough to think of a good name over a decade ago.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Dwarves are obviously the superior hunters.
---
Blizzard have stated time and again that they have a true 1.12 client and a true 1.12 server running as reference. 
---
Your attitude really doesn't go along well with your lack of understanding.
---
Says you, but all that "pointless shit" makes more money than Classic ever will.
---
wow
---
Yeah, I play Big Blue Dress every couple months or so.  It's a good song for a gamer.
---
you could still go with Grackisback though
---
How do you keep all the restricted content up there?
---
&gt; The final stress test was just to greenlight the new hardware rollout.
---
Source for this?  I know they said in the Eurogamer interview that they're deploying new hardware for Classic but I've heard nothing about that being the purpose of a final test or anything indicating that the hardware hasn't already been in place.  I would have thought the last test was more about layering as it's intended to actually be on launch without intentional testing shenanigans.
---
Doubt a single guild will be able to field enough poopsockers. Could be a pug attempt maybe. Would be somewhat underwhelming, no one to claim the kill really.
---
As long time War in classic (and Grand Marshal no im not proud lol but shows I played a fuck ton)This is spot on. You can if heated very high and skilled do ok 1V1 with decent chunk of classes. But overall you know you suck 1V1
---
&gt; 40 man raids?
---
&gt; Ventrilo?
---
No
---
I had both stress test and beta, both were listed in ptr for download, opposed to this version which is under live meaning its the correct one so far preparing for the name reservations ahead 😁
---
Yeah, it's pretty dumb to not have BGs with the release of the honor system.  
---
I personally will enjoy the wpvp chaos but the levelers will get upset
---
I don't know. I've just heard it over the years from several people. The discussion been up in many twitch chats: "What nation has the most toxic gamers?". Maybe/hopefully classic will be "better", since the general age will be like 25-35.
---
I didn't see it coming until the first letter was a T. Made me laugh, well played.
---
https://www.iswowclassicout.com/
---
Love it, priest maybe though a little to prideful of himself lol
---
Yeah I have nothing inherantly against retail other than that the game is shit.  If they made it more like classic and an actual mmo again instead of a glorified chat room between pvp instances or dungeon instances - then I'd totally give it another look.
---
Dumbest comment in a long time. "yeah, it doesnt matter that you piss on your customers, they will play the game anyways". If Blizzard is gunning for to be the next EA that everyone fucking hates, sure.
---
If they dont release server names, people cant make plans what server to choose. It might affect who actually SUBS to have a chance to name reserve. Its a real chance that people wont sub for the name reservations and just get the sub for launch. And blizz just lost 2 weeks of payed sub time.
---
They wont do this - they want to be able to report numbers of "wow subs" and not differentiate between classic and retail.  That way if either version does a lot better than the other it still just comes up as "wow".
---
You keep saying "theres no reason for them to do so" as if player-count isn't a form of advertisement. 
---
When a game has MILLIONS of more subscribers than their competitors, you lead with that foot. I just don't understand your argument here. Its either youre arguing that blizzard doesn't have an accurate number of their subscriber count, which is blatantly false, or that blizzard is choosing not to publish their sub numbers because...your average joe can't figure them out by themselves?  
---
If you don't see the very fact that Blizzard doesn't post their sub numbers as a problem, then I don't know what to say to you anymore. Companies that are happy with their numbers share them, that's just a matter of fact.   
---
If you were a prospective business investor and a business refused to tell you how many sales they make per month, you'd be rightly discouraged from investing in them. Same applies here, if you're not confident enough in your brand/product to strut that SUBSCRIBERS PER MONTH figure that they 100% have and could share, then you're probably not doing too well.
---
I was thinking about Thax but i think Thex just sounds better.
---
I am sure they will but it will stay be a hard time for the levelers.  People wanting pvp ranks will be at every FP, popular farming spots, questing spots, etc.
---
While it will be fun for the 60s wanting to brawl the slower levelers will be forced to hide out in remote areas of the server or quit.
---
No it isn't very doable.
---
It requires crazy good coordination from 35+ people. Hydraxion waterlords rep, GFPP, enought gear on your tank(s). 
---
I would say it requires help from outside the raid team for potfarming etc, for people to sacrefice leveling to 60 and instead doing professions etc to help raid members. 
---
Noone has time to farm hit rating gear so the planning you need and the raid setup would be so out of the norm it would have to be a very dedicated group of people.
---
Doable yes, very doable no.
---
World pvp is great when it is 1-3 vs 1-3. Then it has no phasing problems, etc
---
"organised" world pvp is kind of shit because players tend to group via cross-realm lfg tool and throw faction balance away. They are not "phased randomly", but they may have phased deliberately.
---
In some sense, you are both right
---
Yeah doing the dungeons sounds like what I am used to. Me and my mates had a schedule when we were going to play 9 people online every day and drivers (people who play your char so you don't fall behind) to play if you couldn't play one day. So 9 full timers + 2 drivers would make one CP (constant party). Then you make a clan out of several CPs and an alliance out of several clans. As a solo player you have little say in a clan but as a CP you had some power.
---
I guess WoW have a different grouping structure since supports (it seems) aren't needed in the same quantities and soloing to max level is very effective still. Are leveling record in WoW usually made by groups or individuals?
---
I’d support this. Thex has made this sub unbearable for the last few days. I guess people are bored and don’t have much to discuss.
---
this is different barrens chat than most people talk about. this is just innocent, pure noobism at it's most unrefined, not chuck norris/anal jokes and linking of thunderfury
---
Haha the ventrilo was more of a joke, just more popular back then. Discord was missing from our lives then
---
I would argue a little too much the same. Both dot and wand down the opponent. Plus you would pretty much be using the exact same gear throughout leveling which could get stale as well. Sure, there are differences in gameplay that could spice it up a little, but I like to have my alts as different armor type so it feels like I’m not getting the exact same rewards from quests and hoping for the same drops in dungeons.
---
I got many bro, I am a gamer 🤣
---
No worries dude. There’s a pervasive attitude about classic that vanilla players had no idea how to play and private servers folks are superior players and have made revolutionary discoveries. It’s easy to get caught up in the hype. My issue is that much of the hype is dogmatic to the point that new or interested players feel anxiety about approaching the game or exploring a class.
---
So is anyone in the EU able to download /select classic? i still don't see anything
---
Lennart from Germany =leer
---
That's German for empty.
---
Thex for nothing
---
What part of "it's not Activision-Blizzard's policy to provide detailed sales/subscriber/player numbers" do you not understand? The company still gives quarterly earnings reports, that's enough for every investor.
---
Thanks I read that already tho. Too boring, but I wonder if the 8% MS is too valuable to not rush asap?
---
You won't get an authentic vanilla experience unless you invent a time machine.
---
It will be a similar game but a much different experience.  The player base isn't the same and there is no mystery about this game.

Is your guide aimed at:
---
* earning as much Alliance Faction Rep as possible? or
---
* earning as much Darnassus Faction Rep as possible?
---
You didn't go to teldrassil until level 6.
---
For maximum darnassus rep, would it be better to go straight to teldrassil or following your guide and go there at 6?
---
Ah i see you're a man of culture as well.
---
Found the PvE player.
---
Concerning the quests, it varies a lot - I'd say many item rewards are locked to the final step of a 2-4 quest long chain, but there are exceptions. You'd have to look up available quests beforehand to see what rewards are particularly useful.
---
Dungeon grinding is really only effective in a premade group of like-minded players, so people considering this are already grouping up outside the game. That's not my cup of tea at all, but apparently it's a very viable option - and due to all the boss loot you get doing dungeons over and over, equipment is much less of an issue than just overworld grinding.
---
The answer is always engineering

Better for Homer druid would be Homer as walrus

Thanks, I like it

This hasn't been a thing for years.
---
Guys, you're giving me summoning sickness
---
My name is also ready, gonna play a troll shaman named Thex.
---
You have a point. I surrender. Well done
---
Well don't blame poor Thex, blame his devoted followers.
---
Sure didnt take long for this sub to run this meme into the ground
---
Faction imbalance due to everyone following the streamer, and typically the top guild on the server will be built around the streamer.
---
Go Warlock!
---
Did you know that if enough people roll Warlock on a server they can perform the Ritual of Jumping to Next Phase!
---
I'm not sure what I should see there? Can anyone explain? :D
---
So you were on Arthas horde?
---
Yeah personally I wouldn't count something that doesn't work on retail to be a real record. I think I would enjoy dungeons if I had a stable group.
---
People say so, but I highly doubt it!
---
I'm very interested. DM me that Discord link fam
---
I haven't chuckled so much at all these memes etc. since everyone was posting random wow screens with hidden dogs in them.
---
I bought stupid shit in AH that I replaced after some levels. This time I will horde gold and get my epic mount asap.
---
Could use those holiday hours to spend time with you SO instead of a game though.
---
I will probably look at some guides that are out and try to modify it to my own liking. Just gotta see how painful leveling a rogue is in general.
---
I already know I will probably be drunk off my ass by the time I reach 12-13 on opening day (that meaning the servers actually stay up that long).  I play a dwarf so it's for the immersion okay?!
---
Is there a warrior version of this available?
---
Your whole bloodline is banned! Even your pets! &gt;:|
---
I also was on Arthas and I know for a fact Pat didn't bot to r14. No one on horde side did that I know of.
---
Sup?
---
What guild were you in on Arthas?
---
Whatever server the Rp-pvp community picks, just go with that.  That will have an influx of thousands of players without a designated home and the regular pvp players making it what I would assume probably the largest pop servers.  Barring the "streamer" ones but you don't want to go there.
---
Because people that disagree with your opinion are automatically idiots.
---
Wow how original...
---
Nah, the typical staunch tauren player.
---
Always fair, always good natured, always happy to improve his surrounding, never getting ill tempered and resort to flaming.
---
Why would you do this
---
Is there any way to set keybindings before launch?
---
I've downloaded Wow Classic launcher on my Computer using my brothers account (As he's able to download it on his EU account but not me)
---
However, when signing into my account, I'm still unable to actually open the launcher. So I don't think this will work. As frustrating as it is, I think people in EU who can't download will just have to wait. 
---
I think it has something to do with not having BFA
---
&gt;Leveling a warrior
---
Lol the immediate "you never even played vanilla bro!" flinch defense. Nice one. 
---
No one said shit about the beta client you mongoloid. Their internal reference client is a true 1.12 client running from the ONLY legit 1.12 database in existence. Next time try doing 5 minutes of Googling so you don't appear like a total retard.
---
If you have to revert to using insults, than you've lost whatever argument you had.
---
And if someone is actually being an idiot, than dont waste your time arguing with them
---
Just like blizzard and metzen was wrong about the public wanting classic again, stating years ago that you don't know what you want to a crowd at BlizzCon. I have a very very strong belief that a lot of people are going to be going back to Classic people that have quit retail for years I'm one of those people. I've been supporting my wow Addiction on vanilla burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King private servers for years. And I know there's lots of people like me. Even a ton of people that don't even play private servers but would happily either go back to Classic or never had the chance to play classic the first time. I think a lot of people are going to be very surprised with how popular vanilla is. I love when people underestimate. Makes for a good show. I think with the big patch that they were releasing for retail they're being fair and giving it its deserve time in the spotlight. But I think they're going to start pushing vanilla very soon. Only time will tell. I have a very good feeling that after vanilla they're going to go through at least the first main two expansions. I think if you're in the loop you know how much of a demand there is but if you're not in the loop it's easy to think there's not that many people interested.
---
You don't even know what client was used in beta. The 'stipped down legion client' was used for the Blizzcon demo last year. Your information is about a year out of date.

Ok! Well i guess its personal then. I never had any bad experiences with players from Sweden and never heard anyone in my environment about swedes. I find Russians the most toxic in WoW on european servers, and besides that french/german players who refuse to or cant speak english
---
Yes. Atleast when we get a public stresstest. You can do all UI and keyboard setting and copy the WTF folder (you have to change server- and caraktername)
---
What guilds were you in on Arthas?
---
Pussy whipped casual obviously
---
how do you make gold with engineering? I thought it's the only profession that's just a gold spender rather than earner
---
Maybe there is a huge difference in laptop prices between Great Britain and Scandinavia, but where I live 99.9% of all laptops in the £500 don't have 8GB ram and running WoW with 4GB of shared memory is not going to work in raid.
---
and no phones!
---
Probably go straight to the content. That's what most of youtubers i follow do.
---
Just my personal opinion. I'm just not fan of the classic: YOOOOOOO GUYS WASSUP HeY This iS YoUr BOYYYYYYYYY &lt;insert random name&gt;. Today we gonna talk about, GUESS WAT, &lt;insert title of the video&gt;. 
---
Like seriously ? xD
---
I checked your 2 videos and your tone and explanations are really smooth to listen to. Keep posting good quality content and i might change my mind between druid and rogue :)

The other slot will be tailoring.

Classic will be around for at least a year, possibly 2 if Blizz follows Vanilla's life cycle.
---
They have stated if Classic is a success they would explore the option of Classic TBC and Classic Wrath servers.
---
Nothing has been actually confirmed and we most likely won't hear anything until next year's Blizzcon.
---
No quests = add almost 100 hours to the 150+ hours by questing.
---
That sounds like shitty management if you're mission critical and don't have a backup available. Getting sick and emergencies happen, not to mention mistakes made from getting burned out.
---
Bad automod! Let the people speak to their champion.
---
&gt;called people idiots and morons
---
&gt;told blizzard i hated what their company has become
---
Yeah I wonder why nu-Blizzard banned you..
---
It’s only 1000 years bro
---
With all due respect you have no idea how they're choosing or how they will Implement things that will cost extra money. I'd feel really stupid personally if I was assuming that I knew exactly how much they were going to profit off of vanilla. I'm sure they have teams of people alone their job is to figure out how they can make more money off of vanilla. Let's not be so naive
---
You can mail yourself a lot of things you need using a bank alt, including ammo. There is a small cost but in my experience it's very worth it.
---
The Commies are trying to silence our leader
---
I am EU and have BFA but I can only dl it on the US side.
---
Have you ever seen a real 1.12 client before saying stupid shit? Have you ever inspected the beta client when you downloaded it? Holy shit. I worked on a small TBC private server couple of years ago and trust me even though it's not based on Mangos, I can guarantee you beta values was off the mark lmao.
---
Yeah i agree, the world gets smaller and people are less social.  My guild loved to raid brd and strath with 10-15 people, great times.  But once 5mans were not raidable, less people started playing.  The downvoters probably never got past bwl to know what its like.
---
You absolutely don't know that LOL
---
Priest! This is a great visual guide to a newb like me!
---
Thanks for the answer :) Guess I'll have to wait and see
---
I don't know if you got the memo but low effort posts are okay now.
---
You know it would be way cooler? Not having transmog or any other stupid gimmick in vanilla that would be fantastic
---
I think a PUG is less likely. As others have said, it will take a good bit of outside help, with people maxing professions, gathering, and creating consumables. 
---
I imagine that coordination could only come from a guild.
---
I hope Thex never dies.  This stuff is pure gold!
---
Ah yes, the typical response when someone has caught you regurgitating something you read a year ago clearly showing you have no clue what you're talking about.
---
100 million gold\* debt
---
Some eager beavers may die by level 3.  The majority?  Hell no.  The majority may die by level 12 probably.  The majority means over half.  How do you think you're going to die to yellow mobs that are all going to be spawn camped?
---
Lol no. They would've announced a delay long before 25 days to launch. 
---
Nu-blizz, old-blizz, whatever, blizz is still blizz. They're not *that* dumb.
---
Thanks for this post, easier to block all the boring people if they are all in one spot :)
---
This is me exactly - So I'll definitely be using this tip to get Classic down on my laptop, so i can reserve my names while on road trip.
---
So you will basically get just an hour or so to play?
---
More like the only OC around here for weeks. Everything else is actual forced rehashing of the same crap. Finally bundles of joy.
---

---
Grind mobs, DM farm, etc
---
They're gonna release the list close to the character creation time for this exact reason. They want to avoid too much organizing, which leads to stacked servers.
---
Have you ever seen a real 1.12 client before saying stupid shit? Have you ever inspected the beta client when you downloaded it? Holy shit. I worked on a small TBC private server couple of years ago and trust me even though it's not based on Mangos, I can guarantee you beta values was off the mark lmao. Funny how everything Blizz said is automatically true, dumb fuck. 
---
The point is beta client wasn't true 1.12 so you use your brain from now on.
---
No he didn’t, you’re right. and if anyone is interested. The ORIGINAL post was a guy starting a discussion about peoples in game names for the character creation launch and said “Hi, i’m Thex the Shaman”. There was no mention of how it got his name I believe. 
---
Top comment was something like “Thex seems like a good name, I’ll go with that.” Actually made me giggle. And here we are today...
---
♥️
---
How does it feel to peak in popularity so early? 
---
What will be your coping mechanism when this sub throws you aside like a Warcraft Macaulay Culkin?
---
Google comes up with this: https://www.pantheonmmo.com/
---
I've seen a lot of comments from people on the sub saying that having two characters is a waste of time ebcause of how long it takes to level a single on to 60.
---
I'm self-employed, I have the time :P
---
How the fuck do you think Transmog is a problem?   All that does is encourage people to farm old content for models.
---
Elementals in Silithus give rep, if i remember correctly
---
I'm very interested! Have shared this thread with my guild of irl friends plus other people I know who will be playing Classic. All Norwegian.
---
Could always give that a go when I get bored, thanks for the tip!
---
Never played vanilla. Am a PvE player.
---
I'm not sure between Shadow Priest and Mage. I like both of those classes in bfa (though I prefered shadow priest in WoD to current). I did play in BC, but only somewhat remember it. At the time I mained a healing priest iirc.
---
Anyone have any insight into how fun spriest and mage were? Which mage talent trees were strong / weak (i.e. was it all frost)?
---
This is great. All the butthurt people who hate memes can keep on keeping on. Some of us enjoy a good laugh, and actually add content to this sub instead of straight bitching at every post
---
Imagine how long it would take just to get on a zepplin or activate a flight route or even just walk to a quest giver.. or even just tag a mob.. or even just turn around.. or anything.. how tf would this even work at all?  The commands would have to be very generic.. like 'go to nearest quest giver' with a human pilot..
---
Aurora, I remember mute being in the guild for BWL but think he quit raiding soon after.
---
Oh I thought Dire Maul was a Hunter only thing for farming. Thanks for the heads up on that!
---
Every developer keeps full software version history and DB backups. 
---
I suggest you stop doubling down on your stupidity.
---
Good luck on your 5box journey! I was tempted to but I can't spend 200+ hours solely in dungeons.
---
Was this all along a power move or did you really mistakenly give up your potential character name?
---
You are honestly fucking retarded holy shit dude. Even just by pressing the "Menu" screen would know that it's not a true 1.12 smartass.
---
Dead is a feeling. Make friends somewhere and it never feels dead.
---
Much better than skipping his meds and knowing things.
---
Lmao
---
So I'm thinking about diving into WoW Classic when it launches for a little nostaligia trip. I played pretty heavily as a Hunter at launch through BC with minimal raiding, tagging along on with my guild when a spot was available but overall just messing around.  I stopped after BC with a brief stint on nostalrius prob 5 years or so ago but didn't even hit max level.  Last year I decided to try out legion as a Ret Pally and leveled with gifted heirlooms but didn't  do much. 
---
I sort of just remembered this was happening and am thinking of diving back in for a nostaligia trip again. I cant imagine I will have much time to do any raiding or real true end game activities and will have prob around on average 10 hours a week of playtime. After the kids go to bed etc.  I imagine I will be mostly solo with the random party while leveling or pug leveling dungeon.
---
With all that said, I'm having a hard time deciding between Hunter, Mage and Warlock. I sort of love the idea of going back to hunter and sort of re-living what I loved so much about the game, but then again the idea of playing something new is also intriguing
---
These are the pros as I see them 
---
Hunter - Love the pet playstyle and making the solo experience more fun having a personal tank. IIRC pretty decent crowd control, dps capabilities etc. 
---
Warlock - Has a tank to help with solo, no mount gold farm to worry about while leveling. 
---
Mage - High DPS output, water/bread, eventual porting to various places. 
---
Anyone have any thoughts on my options or other pros/cons that I may be missing on the above 3?
---
Thanks
---
I'm a COO, I am the highest management under the CEO
---
Says the person that's counter arguing a point that wasn't even made.
---
The only boss that could fatigue you is Princess. If you don't watch your mana-management you can run out of mana to mend your pet. Pre-raid gear should be enough, also remember there's rumors that dungeons and elite values are lower than on pservers, nothing confirmed of course.  
---
A side-note, that server seems very poorly written. I saw a few bosses not doing their skills as normal making the fights easier than intended. As an example, Landslide summons ads after 50% hp, thus making him a lot harder and skipped when farming maraudon.
---
There's no way to tell what gear you need until we know the real scripting and values of Classic but either way it's better to farm it once you're pre-raid bis since it's gonna improve your time significantly.
---
I agree, mc and ony should be pushed back.  Nobody wants to run mc for the entire classic 2year timeline just for thinderfuries.
---
&gt;I took a swing with me axe and his head flew off!
---
Cartman used a hammer to crush his head.
---
I'm rolling warrior with friends, I should convince them of this hahaha
---
Has it been shared with the Facebook group? Nearly 12k members there.
---
&gt;Activision HQ 
---
FTFY
---
That line of thinking is really messed up.
---
Yes internet can be harsh and you should grow a thicker skin before diving into it, but how is that a good thing?
---
What's wrong with having a civil conversation that doesnt devolve into a shit slinging competition the moment you can't provide a good counterpoint?
---
Maybe instead of insuting others you should work on your debating skills and try to come up with better arguments?
---
Fk, remembered wrong
---
This survey is meant as a census for the server release so users get an idea of where and what players are going to be doing.
---
Adding in a server that Blizzard has stated will not be available at launch skews the results. The goal with the survey is not to push agenda. We didn't include questions about what users would like after phase 6, what language server they'd play on, or if unarmored mounts should be included in the game. We wanted to see the breakdown of players on day 1.
---
Warlocks can farm Princess, Tinker, and Rotgrip in Maraudon with pretty mediocre gear at 60. I’ve heard conflicting things about aggro radius and HP amounts from the beta but it looks like it’ll be doable. You just need to have a second account or a friend/guildie that can invite you to their group after each run so you can relog to a fresh instance.

How many classic players do you think there will be and how long the classic will last? Your math is way off unless you think there's only going to be few hudnred thousand players and they all quit in several months.
---
That's a pain in the ass. I'm guessing you probably haven't been chosen for Beta then. Hence you cant download.. and hence it's not even an option. As I said I was able to download on my brothers, but not mine :( 
---
An update from blizzard regarding this would be handy, because it makes people think that its bugged or something.
---
What is your backup name in case Thex is taken? ;)
---
I could have created extra questions, yes, or I could just look at the raw results when they're released.
---
In other words, be a selfish prick
---
You can't just assume that people didn't play back then. For me, that is the reason why I downvoted you. I played from the first day of Vanilla to the last back in the day. I want no changes as well. I understand the game is flawed, but it is my favorite iteration of the game by a large margin. I played the beta up until 30 recently, and it reminded me how great the game was and how excited I am. Just because you feel that the game after BWL/ZG isn't enough, doesn't mean have others feel the same way. Making multiple posts about it isn't going to help your cause either. Let us enjoy the game and discussing the game. You don't need to try and bring us down because of the way you feel about it.

If you're excited because you think that classic is simpler and easier, then in a way you think that simple and easy is better than what is current retail wow. It's like you subconsciously want classic wow, and yet you don't want to admit it so you just try to dumb down classic make it sound like a stupid easy simple game and that's why you want it. I guarantee that's not why people want it but all right I guess if that's you. I would actually argue that retail is a lot more simpler and easier. It's actually going to be more challenging and painstaking to level a character in vanilla. I personally am going to enjoy it because I enjoy a challenge I like a game that's hard, I don't like the game where I just login and click a button to queue for a dungeon and then go to that dungeon feel like I really don't have to put forth any effort to get through it and that's it that's a whole game you don't even get drops from bosses anymore you just get a randomize chance to get a piece of gear. I'm actually looking forward to the quests that make me run around the world I'm looking forward to reading class and having to go find the objective even though I'll probably know where everything is already it'll still be a lot of fun remembering reading searching instead of just having an icon on a map.
---
Not so much a question, but I think we should let Thex get his/her name. I have. I have no idea how to coordinate that, but it would suck if a meme got in the way of your enjoyment of the game.
---
We had mass amount of addons in vanilla.
---
I thought naming yourself Cock is against the ToS or something
---
i was gonna go with Tehuacan
---
This is also exactly why I think they're not advertising Classic.
---
If it is successful enough, they'll probably double dip: Advertise BFA and Classic at the same time, saying you can play both. 
---
That way, you're not telling your shareholders "Hey our 15 year old game is making quite a lot of money right now" which would in turn tell them that your new stuff is not worth it or at least spark a bit of a debate.
---
Might be wrong, maybe they just think it's not worth it. But for now, I believe they're just waiting to see how big Classic is, and then advertise both since you *do* pay for both at the same time. Makes sense to me.
---
'' buy a starting capital with real money ''
---
Retard, you're a cancer in the video game industry
---
Which really didnt matter when 15 players were fighting over 10 mobs. Not to mention contested zones like STV. It was hell leveling, the dynamic respawn only made it at least playable
---
Like everything else this will come down to the guild and the people you are playing with.
---
Because it removes a lot of incentive to "become a good player" so to speak. Like so many of retails mechanics do. When I play a game like OSRS or vanilla wow, when I see someone hanging around in a city wearing badass gear, I'm in awe, and I aspire to one day become that player. Tmog, however innocent it may seem, greatly diminishes this rather core-aspect of an mmoRPG. On top of that, it makes it much less rewarding to receive a piece of gear from hard content, because chances are that some easy to obtain tmog piece from 5 years ago looks better than what you just spent a lot of effort on to obtain.
---
Even if the managed it (unlikely) I'm just picturing it now. Two weeks into classic "omg when is BWL coming out there's nothing to do".
---
I know people can play however they choose, but it really feels like speeding through like that defeats the purpose of classic.
---
🚨FUN DETECTED🚨
---
Or that guy has basic gear, get em!
---
Noap... nice
---
You're crazy if you think its not gonna happen, i see a handfull of guilds doing it, maybe even day 5-6
---
&gt; How is it even a possibility?
---
This is one way how:
---
https://wow.tools/dbc/?dbc=spelleffect&amp;build=1.13.2.31209#search=24585&amp;page=1
---
That's the spell ID for the Ancient Hakkari Mansplainer, which has been datamined to scale at 100% of +spelldam. At the same time, in the beta it was discovered that instant attacks (such as Stormstrike and Windfury) will have double chance to proc certain on-hit weapon effects thanks to the spellbatching window. This could lead to dps readings of 1500+ (unless Blizz decides to change some things).
---
Yeh I quit soon after, arthas was my home.
---
are you sure? Didn't the idol get implemented later and in the start you could obtain the enchant by handing in a libram?
---
check:  [https://classicdb.ch/?item=18330](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18330)
---
Mixer then?
---
Toku kept his alts on Arthas and he was in iLL aDVISED with me and his gf and others for a while until we merged with Collision Force. I think he quit our guild around then. Was probably hard watching us wipe on Garr when he had had MC on farm for months.
---
Get a new job man. I understand that stuff always happens occasionally and people need to reach you, but you should not be working *everytime* you have time off. *You* are more important than your *job.*
---
That goes for every class except paladins, they all use different builds for PvE / PvP.
---
I saw the original Warrior, the lvl 60 warrior... a true warrior!
---
How was bfa launch?
---
Remindme! 4 september 2019
---
With a couple level 58s in the raid as well.
---
&gt; Hunters are one of the worst damage dealers in terms of raw output which makes them one of the least desired classes in raids. 
---
What are you basing this on? Naxx? Or the content that the vast majority of players will experience (mc/ony/zg/aq20)?
---
I feel like everyone is judging classes based on who's best in Naxx and not taking into account the rest of the game.
---
BINGO!
---
This is perfect! Thank you.

Are you NA or EU? Because if you really want Thex, I'm quite sure a lot of people could help you by spamming that name, and removing the character as soon as you press enter.
---
As I said elsewhere, I feel like this meme has brought joy to a part of this community, and above all that's what I care about. If I genuinely contributed to this community (even if by accident) I wouldn't take that away.
---
I have a few questions:
---
1) What spec will your Troll Shaman be leveling as?  Any plans to respec along the way?
---
2) What is your favorite zone in classic?  Favorite Dungeons?
---
3) Is Thex (if you are able to get it) going to reach High Warlord, or are you much of a PvPer?
---
I linked the thought process in the other guy's post, do you have an argument as to why not?
---
Most of us are assuming “RP” means RP-PvE, which hardly anyone wants.  I didn’t answer the survey since he didn’t list RP-PvP.
---
Soon is already a registered trademark of OSRS moblie launch.
---
Me too Thex
---
It's been laughs and smiles the whole time. Don't get me wrong, I'm going to try my hardest to get the name, but if I don't get it, then there's no hard feelings.

---
Absolutely love this, I'm all about the griefing!
---
So you want a raid leader without addons to tell you when to move?
---
Are you with the shaman athexa?
---
That's true. But, if I even found one it would be worth it.
---
There's a maximum of 1 Shadow Priest per raid for most guilds that are taking it seriously. 
---
Both classes aren't super fun to play in PvE if you're looking for complex rotations. Priests keep up SW:P, use Mindblast as mana allows, Mindflay the rest of the time.
---
Mages spam Frostbolt until BWL and Fireball from AQ onwards, with the exception of one of the mages applying 5x Scorch debuff. 
---
PvE is not exactly exciting because of how the classes play out, it's more of a group challenge to overcome. Play what you think sounds fun.
---
What about merch?
---
the nostalrius census doesnt look very different

or try finding data from back then

I got banned for a week once a long time ago for quoting a post from the Eu forums. I was only using g it because they made a good point and I wanted to reference what they were saying without copying it. I had a nee thread going with it as the starter so maybe that’s why?
---
Oh well lol.
---
Yea I did the same dude I was super successful though. Got almost 10 + RL buddies from high school we are getting the gang back together! So excited man we all get to relive this with a bunch of old friends. Going to be a blast!
---
NA. Although that's a valiant effort, for every supporter there are 5 memers.
---
&gt; items weren't issue for paladin tanks - no taunt was.
---
No, the itemization is the problem. Taunt is a problem, but it's not debilitating. Taunt is only relevant in a few fights. I don't get why the missing taunt is always brought up. The majority of raid bosses are immune ot taunt anyway and outside of raids, the only purpose of taunt is as a failsafe tool to get aggro back. It's absolutely possible to work without taunt, except on the raid bosses where taunting it is specifically part of the mechanics. 
---
What's debilitating is, that there is very little mitigation gear outside the warrior tier sets and that you have to choose between threat (spelldmg and mana) and mitigation. A paladin, who generates good threat will have much worse mitigation than a warrior and a paladin who build full mitigation will still have less mitigation, generate little threat and is oom very quickly.
---
Is Thex a streamer? /s
---
I was referring to tribalism in general, hence the "Horde scum" bit.
---
Id say a day 7 Ragnaros would be insanely impressive. Speed-running on a scale not yet seen!
---
I don't understand how some people can see the classic client on their launcher, let alone download it... all i can see on my Bnet launcher is this
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/OtIjA7V](https://imgur.com/a/OtIjA7V)

Do i just wait and pray that classic pops up eventually before the name reservation happens?
---
I'm so confused
---
USE YOUR SCROLL WHEEL

Stop trying to use common sense on Reddit. You give people way too much credit.

Aug 16th - free T-shirt day?
---
...?
---
&gt;Has blizzard ever given a release date then pushed it back?
---
...not sure if /s...
---
Or probably expecting for people to be smart and know when to move instead of being told to.
---
Hmm thanks. Do you find the current spriest or fire mage fun to play (gauging if we find the same things fun)?
---
Not sure if I'll be serious raiding in classic or not. At this point I just want to see what I missed and pick a class that I'll have fun exploring with.
---
I no joke still have that keyboard as well, but it isn't functioning properly anymore
---
&gt; I never said the Classic playerbase will be small
---
You literally said that Classic won't ever make even $300 million. Either the playbase has to be really small or it'll make more than that.
---
Sure! We're still in the process of building. Got an icon coming in soon too :D https://discord.gg/Q4KfCH2
---
Yes plz
---
You think you do, but you don't
---
Cool.
---
I feel it’s going to be much more meme oriented around here. You can’t really ask for any changes, and people know so much about the game. It’s hard to have anymore original discussion when so much is already out there.
---
I actually am until I realize they are just not budging on idiotic stances. 
---
Here I’ll play a scenario out on how these happen.
---
Random: “Classic will fail without the WoW token we need the wow token”
---
Me: “no, the wow token will destroy classic before it starts, it would ruin the whole aspect of gold and give everyone an easy path to 60 with a credit card, it will create inflation because of the amount of legal gold farming that will happen..... (insert more calm points here)
---
Random: “THEN EXPLAIN HOW ILLegal GOLD FARMING IS ANY DIFFERENT AT LEAST YOU WONT BE BANNED WITH WOW TOKEN”
---
Me: “well you should be banned for buying gold as it ruins the game, and a minimal amount of people buy gold when it’s illegal, the MAJORITY of people buy it when it is legal, making illegal gold farmer problems increase ten fold”
---
Random: “THE WOW TOKEN WILL BE ADDED DONT YOU WORRY ITS GOING TO BE THERE”
---
Me: “(insert insults about dipshits here)”
---
Yeah there are lesser opinions when it comes to classic wow.
---
It's definitely going quick for me, can't believe it's August already! I was watching Joana's stream a lot during the beta and he's inspired me to roll a hunter despite already having picked a class. Night elf hunter, PVE realm.
---
I'm a busy parent with limited playtime, so I'd rather play as efficiently as possible. I've played retail wow for 14 years on and off. I've spent about a third of this time on pvp realms and I've come to the conclusion that the older I've gotten, the less I enjoy it. Personally, I think that the novelty of it wears off a lot quicker than people care to admit, especially a few months after launch when people get bored and start killing your alts quest giver NPCs. That's always fun. When phase two comes around I'll be sinking time into BGs though!
---
I know roughly what zones I'll hit up for levelling and that I'll be BM spec but aside from that, I've not planned anything else. BiS Gear? Level 60 builds? Professions? I have a rough idea but I'll tackle those topics when they are actually problems! Planning all that now will take the fun out of it for me.
---
If he doesn't mind then whatever right. Let the man/woman be.
---
The only way around this is instead of going Classic + or TBC Classic, would be to make WoW 2, based off of Vanilla playstyle and hard mmo based character choices.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hE0uZxVszV0hZV0e
---
Thank you for that, will do it.
---
Looks amazing man, can't wait for the (dwarf) priest!
---
I was 17 and installed the trial. I played for an hour and I felt the most overwhelming sense of immersion and satisfaction with the world surrounding me. I hopped in my maroon 94’ Honda Accord and drove my ass straight to the local mall game stop and picked up a copy. A few weeks later my friend from my band came over and saw me playing and decided he wanted to try it. That was the end of our band as he didn’t really ever leave his computer after that. I couldn’t blame him. What a fucking game.
---
It's great. Believe it or not this is the second time I have ascended to memehood. I'll link the story in a second.
---
Thank you all for your quick and good replies =)
---
&gt;Keep in mind vael starts at 30% and hammer of wrath is a thing.
---
Totally forgot about that stupid hammer of wrath. Well in that case paladins spamming the shit out of that should be fine, then. What is the cd on it?
---
I did this last night and can confirm that this works (I am based in UK)
---
Game downloaded ready )
---
If my guild is gearing 10 ret pallys and I'm playing a warrior, I'm leaving.
---
Hah imagine being a useless alliance Hunter.

I was doxxed by reddit admins, it's all good fun

---
Our raid group is organizing our 'douse' team now, or at least a plan.
---
~ 1,200 Dust Stormers or Desert Rumbler kills needed to get the Hydraxian rep for Quintessences.
---
- A raid group of 7 (8 to be safe) shares the rep. Two groups of 4
---
- A group of 4 should be able to manage 3 kills a minute (and there's enough mobs to sustain 3+kpm)
---
- So we've got 6 kills per minute between the two groups.
---
-  200 minutes
---
- Rep grind done in just over 3 hours.
---
We're napkin mathing now if it's better to do in groups of 4 starting at level 58/59 - mix in final grind to 60 with rep grind.
---
I wouldn't blame you tbh.
---
What does mystery have to do with it? I was under the impression that most people who want to play Ret know it isn'y good but love the class fantasy.
---
I will definitely post my realm when the time comes. Casual players are welcome to play with me. I'm not about drama and dumb shit so if anyone wants to roll with me they have to be a friend first and a guildie second.
---
i had a paladin named after a medication for bladder problems (the German words for bladder and bubble are the same)
---
!remindme 16 days
---
I also likes to put an 's' after a word randomly.
---
Christoffer Walken, used to, use commas like, that.
---
Well, just an idea for you.  Take the old Chex Quest game, and add new t(h)extures to make your character a troll shaman and you are slaying reddit memers.
---
Updated game name should be obvious...
---
It's not an add. That's just their regular 1st of every month "what's happening in Warcraft this month"-post.
---
Is it really a waste of time if you are enjoying it?
---
Haha if you posted that here you’d definitely get a bunch of people to buy it
---
Thex, of course, is just a contraction for Vex Thal. 
---
When you were keyed for Vex Thal, one of the little known uses for the key was that you could use it to unlock the Shaman class in Vanilla WoW. The first person that did that named his character Thex, and the rest is history.
---
No need to change.  It's going to be Thex.
---
You’re being oddly toxic friend :)
---
As someone who mained a mage in Vanilla through Wrath, and is going to have a mage alt this time around, I would never pick mage if I didn't plan on doing mostly dungeon and raid content. I think if you plan on leveling slowly and doing a lot of solo exploring you will be much happier with a warlock or hunter.
---
Exactly. The original hunter timers would suggest that, but yaht is a much better timer.
---
Retail WoW doesn't feel like an MMO and it's just such an odd game - I started at level 1 as a caster and my mana bar didn't move AT ALL even spamming spells, no resists, no challenge...couldn't even stomach it for 5 minutes. The added flying, transmog, and that kind of stuff doesn't really bother me all that much - the game play itself does.
---
6sec cd. So HoW alone is worth 100-125dps once vael reaches 20% and with infinite mana you can spam it.
---
Oh look another repost
---
&gt; wife to play a little bit
---
.....
---
brb
---
I would really appreciate it honestly. I will report back on name-day if I don't get it. I'm sure you guys will be anxiously anticipating my announcement.
---
No one who plays the game above the most casual level LIKES titanforging. It is a system they keep because it forces you to keep playing. It is a terrible mechanic
---
Sorry.
---
Why? There isn't a lot of item overlap between warrior and ret paladin.
---
The biggest challenge is having an active 40 man roster to play.  This is why I hope all the evil layering leads to having 1 pvp server, 1 pve server and 1 rp server so that you don't end up with dead servers or servers that are so one sided to one faction that the other faction can't even play the game.
---
&gt; . I completely disagree with #2.
---
People that think like this are interesting. Have to wonder if people like this became infamous somewhere for some transgression and didn't like that everyone knew they were a shorter for one reason or another...
---
Vanilla wow was about experiences and relationships.
---
fucking nice, how did you do that illustration?
---
Well back in vanilla fury warriors were meme specs. The joke at the time is that a ret pally that is alive will do more damage than a dead fury warrior. Since they have no way to dump threat AND take increased damage. They were a liability and would help oom healers if they were bad enough. It wasn't until pservers that people thought fury &gt; arms. In vanilla for raiding warriors it was either tank or arms.
---
&gt; No one will even have the rep required to get Eternal Quintessence for dousing the runes to spawn Majordomo Executus and in turn Ragnoros himself from defeating Majordomo.
---
A group of 8 can farm the rep in 3-4 hours. Rep is shared. Grind elementals, EZ PZ.
---
Sure but the server name will change :)
---
Doesn't really compare to a rogue or warrior spamming backstab or execute, but that would absolutely help their *paultry* dps.
---
Haha, did you guys also find the Thex in this post?
---
Why are we speaking English on Reddit again ?
---
This isn't an ad, it's a tweet on their time-line.
---
Hello, Thex-y.
---
Yes, all I wanted was to make this pun. Have a great day, Thex-y!
---
thanks ;D
---
Was asmongold running deadmines for over 100k people not advertising?
---
Here I am!
---
Vaelastrasz isn't so much a DPS check as it is a tank check. If your tanks aren't able to build and transfer threat properly, you can't do him. If your tanks can, your DPS only need to be moderatly competent to kill him within time.
---
It's a promoted post and therefore an ad. It didn't come up "naturally" in my feed. It was in an ad slot. That's literally how Twitter ads work.
---
My name would be Anan...
---
WOOOOOOOOO
---
So... a once a month advertisement for whats new with their products?
---
Hence why I provided a link for the person asking.
---
Stormstrike itself is already in a shitty spot where it's not wanted out of the 16 debuffs on the boss. So, just like Arms warriors, one of your spec defining abilities is not allowed to be used, unless you somehow can justify the debuff being worth it and for Stormstrike, even with Elemental shamans it doesn't add enough DPS.
---
In regards to the proc of items, we for sure can't tell yet. I get your point, but I HIGHLY doubt it's going to be anything close to 1500+ DPS or even be justified with just somewhat decent DPS. I'd like to see your thoughts/source on how you achieve 1500+ DPS with something like that, or how that proc itself could potentially make Enhancement shamans one of the best DPS specs in the game.
---
You never coded in your life or worked on a software environment. Backups and version controls will not cover abandonwares. So shut the fuck up.
---
Mage has 3 excellent talent trees but only 2 real playstyles - spam fireball or spam frostbolt. The Arcane tree is awesome but it's really there as a supportive tree and primarily used for PVE frost or a pvp fire spec. You only get 2 arcane damage spells in vanilla (Arcane Missiles and Arcane Explosion) and they are mostly inferior to their fire/frost counterparts.
---
It is much easier to read still!
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
Lol overpopulation. Unless he's on a streamer server that won't be a problem come phase 3.
---
I'll get to it. Right now I'm working on another inn, and someone wants me to do some sort of K-pop song in NES format. That's gonna be tricky...
---
Then it's off-topic and doesn't belong here.
---
of course not. but it would be the expectation and a point of communal  pride.
---
Are the best wow guilds coming to classic for world first? I want to see some epic story about how they did it.
---
That's rude, making ppl change their mind in the last second! ;)
---
Nah, math is too hard. I will just call myself Thex!
---
:D
---
&gt; wouldn't you also leave out Golden's Arthas book?
---
Arthas was romantical. Knaak is tedious. But I agree that war of the ancients is essential.
---
Not but people (including me) tend to forget that once the game is turned off, everything you did was pointless and you achieved absolutely nothing in real life during playing.
---
A hobby is important but don't forget that everything ingame is pointless in real life.
---
And we haven't yet calculated in potential queue times, server crashes, maintenance downtimes that could happen during the first few weeks. I wouldn't be surprised if it would happen. It's normal.
---
Haven't played current Spriest, Fire mage is OK, Frost was more fun to me. Then again, I'm not a massive fan of the expansion and how specs play out in it. 
---
If you're not seriously raiding, I'd 100% go mage. It's the best 5man DPS class by a long shot in my opinion and has a LOT of utility Spriest simply can't bring. Additionally, trash mobs often fall before SW:P fully ticked, making you pretty inefficient in 5mans. 
---
I was originally a mage main and am going to roll Priest this time around - they're cool because you have the option of healing when your group needs it or you feel like doing that. If you're just going to casually play, explore, do some dungeons, it largely doesn't matter what class you play - but I'd still recommend mage because it makes a lot of endeavours pretty fun ime.
---
Thats me  Widepeepohappy
---
Yes. Most people in Vanilla entering BWL had no clue how to play the game and many of them still killed Vael. The first actual DPS check is going to be C'thun. Then Patchwerk. But even guilds with ret paladins and feral druids killed Patchwerk.
---
Good job. Everyone should use this for their names.
---
Have you ever tried RP realms?
---
I'm sure you've put far more thought into this than I have, but it seems like it would be a fair strategy to have tanks and healers grind the last two levels out on rep in groups since they might be the slower solo levelers. Interesting idea though.
---
There are clearly mods that cheat. Auctioneer is a prime example.
---
Will you people grow the fuck up?  This ain't twitch chat.
---
Releasing realm names with server types and timezones would be nice...
---
How are you doing today?
---
Because Blizzard likes money.
---
And it's not really that big of a stretch for them to require it. I am surprised that they don't
---
I dont think we will care about world first this time around, it will be who does the raid best in time IE Speedruns.
---
He sounds like a "holier than thou" prick to me.
---
Ayeeee yinz
---
To be honest I can't remember. We were &lt;fishbone&gt; quite early though, already at Onyxia and MC. We were a little bit behind the top guilds on the Horde side like Novus Principum. After the top guilds migrated to Frostmane, we became one of the top Horde guilds.
---
I think my friend played in Crimson, Mitch Troll Hunter!
---
dont think so, due to the lack of items supporting other skilltrees at some point you are pretty much irrelevant. 
---
While the prot pala might work in the 5 man's, it wont go well in the bigger raids, simply due to the lack of available items. And i think this sucks, i mean why even give the possibilty to go for the tank pala, shadow priest, etc. if its not supported by items.
---
FBSS?
---
Stave of Shielding?
---
Circlet of Shadow?
---
Torpor?
---
Mana Stone?
---
You will grind for quite some levels. If you level with skinning you can farm beasts and vendor everything. Avoid training skills you dont use.
---
Having the gold at lvl 40 shouldnt be an issue.
---
Vacation?  I checked this sub yesterday morning and I was still lost.  I have picked up the context through helpful redditors like Mr. /u/lorepandatv in this thread.  
---
Can you really blame us, though.  We are in a long content drought.  Most of the streamers and youtubers are taking it easy in preparation of launch so we're just sitting around milking anything we can in anticipation.
---
Not a whole lot. For example, as a fire mage someone should apply the scorch debuff and maintain it on a boss fight, but only 1 person in a group needs to do that (cast 5 times to stack, then once every 30 seconds). Frost mages have a similar debuff but it's passively applied via a talent. Some groups will designate one mage to take that talent and allow the rest of spec Arcane/Frost so they can use Arcane Power (especially powerful if you have quick kill times).
---
Don’t make my mistakes and spend your entire study leave for exams playing WoW.
---
I think its also that everyone is anxiously waiting for Classic to drop and little news has come forward... We are bored and are like ravenous beasts right now, IMO.
---
Of courth not.
---
Just use the search bar and stop complaining
---
Lmao i also cant find classic in my launcher or even anything related to it. So you tell me i need to create a starter account in... Let say US (im eu) and then it will appear in my launcher?
---
This isn't true at all. At least not for level 1 characters. People sell character names all the time.
---
Hogger is going to get some nice kill streaks.
---
Yeah thats my take on it as well.
---
Lol DPS check
---
Was the worst ones 500 or something?

Some people like being the big fish in a small pond and see a guild with an arbitrary rule like that as an opportunity to get a leg up. Some people join for social reasons and disregard the rule.  Some might see that the guild is short on their class and see an opportunity to get loot.

Hunters are super expensive to level in a fresh environment.  Huge amount of spells,  have to feed their pets,  have to buy ammo,  less bag space to harvest with.  It's rough honestly, but because of the pet they can level far more aggressively than the other classes with the exception of good druids. Pallies and locks get their free mounts and training so they're less strapped for cash than the other classes. And since they level so fast they and droods are usually assigned to help out the warrior tanks because leveling warrior in vanilla is hell.

Meh you severely underestimate the draw that classic will have. Sure classic might not have mtx but if millions of people sub and log in to classic and actually stay (unlike bfa) , you can bet your ass that blizz will take notice and find ways to profit off it. Bfa is gonna be a fart compared to classic wow and the kind of publicity and good grace it brings blizzard. Money will come later. Right now blizz needs to get their heads out their asses and be that innovative gaming company they once were. Mtx and more bad expansions might bring in cash but it won't save blizz like classic will. Can't wait for classic.

You also had to hand in an item that is also used to obtain the ZG tier sets. The item that you had to hand in was not the same as the one that your class uses for its ZG set. It was really, really dumb and counterintuitive.
---
On private servers that used this system, no one was able to get their ZG tier set (because the items were always reserved for enchants instead) and the ZG enchants were very easy to get. I had them on like 4 different sets of gear. 
---
Primal Hakkari Idols are much easier for new players to understand and they keep the availability of ZG enchants low (only 2 enchants per raid instead of \~7). Given everything else that we know about Classic, I'm pretty sure that Blizzard is going to go straight to the Idols when ZG is released.
---
But there's no way to know for sure.
---
I mean, can't you write an addon to detect if other cheat addons are running and then have that report to the guild leader, then just make that addon mandatory?
---
It was and it will be more rewarding, I’m going into it with my wife the same way, no addons no macros.  We don’t care about being top tier really so it works out and will be more enjoyable for us personally.  Don’t you love how people twist your words and thinking to lend credit to a response that has zero to do with what you said, or state something that really goes without saying? I appreciate your take on this and your awesome attitude!  Restores a bit of my faith in this sub.

Thex Dagger
---
Literally has been confirmed by Blizzard that the dungeon dmg and also xp was off on pservers.
---
I did this on a well-known, fairly accurate Blizzlike PS.
---
I wouldn't bother if you are a fresh 60. Once you get a decent weapon it becomes viable. My suggestion to you would be to spam LBRS as much as you can until you get Blackcrow. Once you get that you can probably complete the run without to much trouble.
---
It's going to take some practice to get the timings down on princess. You can get really fucked if you burn FD to drink and she throws a rock at you right away.
---
The more gear you get the easier / faster it's going to be. With mostly greens and Blackcrow it can take a while. I was healing my pet alot and drinking alot. By the time I got mostly pre-bis gear I was killing her noticeably quicker. I didn't have to drink nearly as often.
---
Once I got a few pieces of T1 I was able to do it sometimes without drinking at all, or if I got unlucky I would have to drink once or twice. 
---
Rotgrip (the gator) was the only once I had issues with actually being able to kill with bad gear. He stacks a dot on your pet that can kill it pretty easily if you don't have enough dps. I ended up pulling off a strategy to kinda share tanking with my pet when my gear was bad. 
---
I would send the pet it to get initial agro. I pop rapid fire and just lay into him as hard as I can to pull agro off my pet once he gets 1 stack of the bleed. I tank him and do damage with raptor strikes until I need to not die, then I FD, back up, and let my pet tank the rest.
---
Be grateful there is even a game to get addicted to as the game industry is in a tail spin right now imo. An influx of BR games and very little innovation (unless you love BR games). I am so hyped. I’m much older now and know it’s not worth it to let the game take over your life. It should never be a crutch to your real life.

I still suck at explaining this, but basically most of the proc-weapons from the beta were confirmed to spellbatch their procs. So the server listens for your weapon to hit the enemy and then it rolls the dice to see if you get a proc. But it keeps listening for .2 seconds due to spellbatching "lag compensation", so if you can get any additional attacks within that .2 seconds (i.e. Sinister Strike or Windfury procs) then the next attacks will get an additional chance to proc the same thing. So the first strike has one chance to proc, then lets say Windfury procs and it gets 2 chances to proc and the third hit (from Windfury) then gets 3 chances to proc. And if you have say 450 +spelldam, then your Hakkari procs deal 500 damage and your Shadow Oil procs will also be dealing roughly 250 damage. Your Dragonbreath Chili should be hitting for 500.
---
The Ancient Hakkari Manslayer also deals Shadow damage, and that (along with Shadow Oil) both get +35% damage on the boss from Improved Shadow Bolt as well as Shadow Weaving.
---
Nice straw man.
---
Same.
---
“People are trying to have fun? Not on my watch!”
---
Fire has more damage but frost offers more utility and survivability, which, if you play on a PvP server is quite handy.
---
Or Thexasanymore ?
---
I think he's trying to say that people will notice certain items. For instance, in the beginning of wrath you could generally tell which mages were going to do good dps because they had those crystal shoulders from the naxx set. 
---
Regardless of how cool you look, people liked to show off their success.
---
... that's not cheating. There are no "mods" that cheat. There's botting programs, which are certainly cheating because they completely automate gameplay. Auctioneer just speeds up menu interaction (like a lot of other addons) and makes things easier to read/understand (like a lot of other addons).
---
I was with you until you claimed Kara was a power spike. 
---
Perhaps you only played in 2.4, but Kara gear was actually quite terrible until they buffed it.
---
This isn’t the one
---
But thanks
---
Regardless of what y’all are arguing about, Blizzard does have, and has showed they have the original 1.12 client running on 1.12 infrastructure and such, fully original. They use it as reference whenever those posts blow up about how damage is wrong and then they’re like “actually no it isn’t” and everyone realizes the original poster is using a pserver as reference
---
Now I don’t know if blizzard have looked into the supposed hunter bug so that is up for debate
---
Kind of a pitiful little weapon if you ask me.

this has to be a joke...lol

At what point did you do from "ha, good joke guys", to "Ah fuck, there's going to be some genuine competition for this name, isn't there"?
---
[me_irl](https://images.app.goo.gl/77HKuFrJTSjBSMKH9)
---
good quality meme
---
The little bit of googling I did has  the average speed runs taking about 4d15h and that’s assuming you’ve chosen one of a few specific classes, grinding solo, etc.  Warriors and Priests are two classes I can’t see being able to grind to 60 in that window. 
---
I’d be interested to see if someone had data on times of solo v. group leveling and which would net the fastest 1-60 runs. My guess would be solo is still faster.
---
I'd be less concerned if thos idiotic shit wasn't flooding the entire subreddit. I thought low effort ahitty memes that had nothing to do with wow were being taken down  but I guess not.
---
This. One of the best things about Vanilla is that unlike later expansions with their bullshit catch up mechanics, Vanilla had a proper line of progression. if you started in 2004 or 2006, if you wanted to get into a raiding guild doing Naxx, you generally still needed to do previous raid tiers to gear up, or no one would take you. that combined with high quality items in various slots that last multiple tiers, keeps guilds running lots of different content (Band of Accuria in MC and bindings for their tanks, just off the top of my head.) Hell while my guild was doing Naxx we did Disenchant runs of Ony, just for the guaranteed bag for someone, the nexus crystals and the head for the buff to start Naxx night with (this was about the extent of our "using world buffs" back then.  
---
TL;DR there is just enough stuff, and gearing 40 people is just slow enough, that it keeps all the content relevant for pretty much forever.
---
To answer your questions:
---
1) Thex
---
2) Thex
---
A lot of people doing it over the thex meme. Percentages will be off slightly due to shamans only being on horse. A lot of players will quit before hitting 60, especially when they realize there is no duel wield for them in classic. 
---
Certain populations will be crazy for awhile but once things settle it'll all even out.
---
So if you fail in obtaining Thexx or anything related to that.. what name will you try for next?
---
...Thex Dagger
---
In 1000 years the forums will be long gone so jokes on them!
---
I may have added years to my age, but I'm still the same 16 year old griefer that joined WoW on Day 6.
---
A sub now is the same price and the same thing as a sub right before launch. You should do it now for the last stress test and character creation.
---
In short, yes you need a sub for the stress test.
---
&gt;More likely is that Blizzard sees Classic as an opportunity to attract former players back into the modern game through advertising and research into what changes they need to make to Retail.  If they figure it out in a year, we won't get TBC Classic. If they need more time, we will. 
---
TBC? I'd rather pass on Flying, leading to dailies, leading to 5-man badges. It splits the playerbase and turns WoW into a hub-world with minigame activities. I'd rather have classic either chill out and just make new servers every 2 years. Get social or go retail.  Keep it the pet project that it is. Treat it like diablo 3 and just keep the lights on, maybe merge dead servers and make fresh ones every 2 years. But I see the arguments about what they *should* do and I get it, everyone wants different things.
---
Regarding changes made to retail? I really have no idea what they can do to retail to make it like classic and force socializing. Kill dailies, kill flying mounts, kill lfg? It's actually an interesting thought exercise. I can't come up with a solution that does not attack their solo daily quest playerbase.
---
What is dead may never die
---
Is that lok'ramilis (or however you spell mace from nefarian, caster one)  in your main hand? I don't recall any later tier weapon with same icon.
---
Most classes have a very simple "rotation." Warlocks as well should be using shadowbolt 99% of the time.
---
The English UI with the Finnish/Swedish/whatever language guild chat has me all kinds of confused lol.
---
Cool looking character though!
---
Potentially I guess? And then potentially someone finds a way to work around that. I don't know enough about addon dev to say either way but I'd imagine it's just not worth the hassle. You'd be better off advertising the guild as "for players that dont use addons".
---
Simba
---
Yeah that’s not true. I see hearthstone ads all the time and have never played it nor do I ever leave the wow tab. They advertise every new release for hearthstone.
---
Methods are streamers now so it holds
---
Now that Twitch can handle.
---
Pretty sure this is the single dumbest meme of all time.
---
Yea I get what you're saying. These days, I've definitely had a hard time playing video games for any extended period of time for that exact reason. Easy solution, never log out! /s
---
I don't think the downvotes are due to your opinion on the subject. 
---
I think the downvotes come from your self assuredness and the fact that you say we are "out of touch with reality" because we have a differing opinion.
---
On topic, i personally don't think the current people claming they will do it can do it.
---
But i do not doubt that there are people that can do it, but i don't know if they will be able to coordinate it. 
---
So to summarize: Idk, unlikely but who knows.
---
&gt; you can't break through that sort of commitment to fantasy
---
My name is Lily and I picked Japan as my favourite country. Lija? Sounds cool, I like it.
---
To be fair that's mostly because people hate lbrs after a few times running it and won't go back very often for the gems.
---
Shaman too: purge spam, shock interruptions, burst damage. Fear run away and let someone else kill them haha
---
If I remember correctly it wont let you put more than 2 in a row of any letter.
---
I think it's Spineshatter from Razorgore (1st boss BWL). It could be replaced by some sword dropped by Faerlina in Naxx40 I think, but otherwise it was the best available at the time.
---
Really enjoy the art style. Great work, I look forward to the subsequent submissions.
---
Right? God I hated that season.
---
Great! Thanks for asking. I'm in the office right now not doing my work like I'm supposed to.
---
Maybe from the Sanskrit word for vagina: yoni.
---
We don't necessarily disagree, in essence it's about trading a bit of mana conservation for flurry.
---
When you're playing melee, there's barely any difference in the playstyle of the specs, but enhancement does have the most consistent, sustained flow - compared to ele's sole strength being frontloading burst.
---
That being said, ele is far more fun, and better for pvp.
---
I just got a budget laptop for $240 with i3-8300 processor, Intel UHD 620 integrated graphics and 4GB of RAM.  It plays the 1.12 client at 1080p@60fps.
---
With your £500, you'll be fine.  Since this will be a more dedicated machine, I'd look for something that has any sort of dedicated GPU.  Ideally it would be nice to get an i5 processor.  Even looking at the Ryzen APU chips, get something with Vega 11 GPU integrated.  1050 or 1050ti will be fine from Nvidia, I think 1660 is too high up on budget, but you can try to find one.  I'm not familiar with AMD equals beyond the APU setups.
---
But that's not Twitch Plays. That would be Twitch Tells That Dude how to Play.

Double ice block and sheep. Sucks monkey balls

No, it can't be that. They roam along the path, going quite far. He says he's being spawn-camped, which would be odd, given the elves don't stay stationary

Sounds like the kind of instrument that would still be small in the palm of a 5'4" manchild.
---
Recruiting will start when the game launches. But I'm sure you'll have a place with us.
---
Years? 'SC ghost would like to start a chat with you'
---
Man how it must have felt to replace that sick t3 for a green quest item 😭
---
Ah, i see. Never saw it drop, even with latet solo farming so i got confused.
---
It is literal. DPS classes have very simple rotations in classic. Shadow priest isnt much better, you only use 3 spells, but the priest comes with the downsides of doing less damage and having mana issues. 
---
Even though I'm rolling warlock this time around, I always found tanking or healing much more interesting than DPS, especially in classic.
---
Once classic comes out I’m never coming back here, this is solely for the build up. It’s going to be absolutely shit here within 2 months of release.
---
Honestly though if it was on a PvP server they would get ganked into oblivion the moment they got to a contested zone.
---
Once the meme spread out side of the original post I knew it was game over.
---
I awoke the next day to a barrage of mentions.
---
Your man of the house, you decide when you do wow.
---
You know someone got banned for Tweeting "Men aren't women, though", right? 
---
Calling someone a moron is probably intolerant of the simple minded or some shit and there you go, Bob's your uncle.
---
Did a rank 10 grind on a warrior and ended up changing classes. It’s about the worst unless you have two pocket healers. Expect better players now that will focus your healers, they have a lot less mana, and there will be a lot better use of CC and Engineering gadgets this time around. I do not envy warriors at all
---
I have been hung up on this part aswell.  
---
Warlocks and Mages have a 1-button spam rotation.   
---
Rogues build combo points, spent combo points to keep slice n dice up and spend the rest on eviscerate.  
---
Hunters have, afaik, the most complicated rotation.  
---
Warriors I have no idea about.  
---
I suggest looking up some raiding builds, I just checked the wowhead classic guides for the most basic stuff.
---
Layering won’t affect dead servers, all layers are within the same server, no cross server people. So if a server dies to the point a single layer is empty, it’s an oof
---
a hunter previously known as athexa.
---
Well if you enjoy doing a 3-4h Mc clear I wont judge. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.
---
I think you have about a week or so where people would unironically buy thex t shirts.
---
You can do princess naked with the kiting strategy but you have to be on point with LOS boulders (which in turn means you have to perfectly manage your distance from princess at all times).
---
Years is technically just decades divided into smaller portions.
---
wow.gamepedia has health values. Say 1mil for vael (out of 3.3mil max health).
---
No idea how accurate those are, my memory says ~750k for vael, but I may very well be wrong there.
---
Well, most classic rotations are centered around one ability.  Mage isn't actually just Fireball spam, but here's the rotation:
---
 &gt;Stack Scorch to 5 stacks, increasing fire damage received by 15% for 30 seconds
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Cast Pyroblast to try for a huge crit
---
&gt;Spam fireball until Scorch is around 5-10 seconds left, then refresh scorch
---
That's pretty much it.  Pyroblast does the most damage, but has a 6 second cast time so it's highly inefficient.  There's some trickery to the Ignite talent to learn, but the rotation itself is dull af.
---
Frost is just Frostbolt though.  Both spec's you fit in cooldowns as needed.
---
/u/title2imagebot
---
Well for most people it's normal to work like 8 hours a day and have weekends always free - but thinking about it, it will be quite worth if you can retire at 30. I wish you a great time in your holidays, not a lot of people can say they deserve it more^^.

Im out of the loop, whats Thex?
---
Ya but that was just delayed indefinitely. It's never coming out.
---
good bot
---
I'm probably not the right person for that question - you mentioned you love the pet playstyle and I'm the exact opposite. I didn't even get my hunter out of the starting zone for that reason. I played a warlock to around 40 but by then I realized the spec I enjoyed playing was destruction with a passive imp and it basically felt like playing a shadow bolt version of mage, which I already had, so I stopped playing it.
---
Hunter offers more solo content than other classes by nature of what the pet system is though. In Classic you have to level up your pet, train them abilities like a little mini character, and maintain some sort of happiness gauge with them. It's a lot more involved than other classes.
---
You didnt weep shut the fuck up.

---
I just found and read [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/142QiLyH5L0Dx9XnWBNKhBF5LTmOW-vnzb5S-mMDTVcw/edit) 
---
"Picking your Class - a guide for new players".
---
It has a pretty decent breakdown of each classes strengths/weaknesses/playstyles etc.
---
Warrior seems to be just behind Hunter in complexity, but imo, more interesting than Hunter. I tend to play ranged classes though, so I'm a bit stuck. Mage vs Priest vs Warrior vs Rogue are now my thoughts.
---
Thats some cool fuken gear.
---
why the hell so many people talking over the name  thex?
---
Correct me if I am wrong but does account shearing not go against blizzards terms and agreements?
---
Or at least a trigger warning.
---
We, the incel NEETs, don't want to be reminded of the existence of feeemales.
---
Hmm.. maybe Thox? No, that doesn’t sound right at all...
---
So you want to look at nothing?
---
Because being 30 means you can't have a sense of humour?
---
Meh whats the difference if its me or a kid farming the gold
---
Because of layering outside of maybe battlenet logins there won't be any login queues.
---
It’s odd because I don’t remember having hard time getting wsg/arathi rep. I got them exalted on my ally and horde char in vanilla (altered valley wasn’t as easy, got them exalted in tbc).
---
Not sure for the city reps, never got near exalted with runecloth repeatables.
---
Also farming pirates for the pirate hat was fun!
---
You,'re not wrong Walter, you're just an asshole.
---
He'll be lucky if he can even name his troll that after this
---
Exactly. Its a response to all the 'what class should i pick posts'. We fight it with humor!
---
It would take help from a non raiding group for pots, but also account sharing so people could hit 60 in less than 6 real life days.  At least 100 people, and 80 of them sharing 40 accounts.
---
It could be possible but that would be a hurculean effort.  And I'm still not convinced on the rep grind for the quintessence.
---
He will be suuuuper easy to find.
---
Look for a troll ^shaman ^^named ^^^Thex
---
Classic
---
Yeah, there is no data on group leveling yet because no one has done it with min-maxing on Blizzard realms. 
---
I'm trying it myself with a group on release, we are currently 10min behind Joanas time on 1-15, but we are 5 people so it seems really interesting and promising. If it dosn't work out then you know, we just drop group and solo level.  
---
We are testing on private servers tho and grinding minimum of mobs since they will probably all be dead anyway, so it's uncertain how it will turn out at release, but i'm in no need to speedrun anyway, we are clearing MC week two anyway so it's not a crazy rush for me.
---
Heyy someone else thats going mage main and druid alt! Hi friend!  
---
Can you do me a super favor and link that sheet you are talking about for mages? would be much appreciated fellow Vending machine!
---
Now that the name Thex is off the table, what will you character be named?
---
Tauren female, troll male, undead female, orc male, night elf female, human male, gnone male. 
---
All dwarfs are male anyway.
---
I think I agree with you. My gender preferences vary based on race haha
---
Thexxy Rexxy!

It's Thex Manning Day!

Thank you so much for writing a very detailed guide to share, /u/Shadow__Panther
---
Do you think you could do a more "Casual" Guide to maximizing Darnassus Rep that's not class dependent requiring Stealths?
---
As I read through, I feel I'll mistakenly kill few enemies too many here and there and totally brick my chance at maximizing Darnassus Rep, probably before I leave Stormwind, I'd be level 7 or 8 rather than 6 like you said.
---
Like just a "Casual" Guide saying something like:
---
* Quest in Stormwind until level 4
---
* Grab delivery quest in Stormwind
---
* Quest in Teldrassil until level ?
---
* Quest in Darkshore until level ?
---
* and like where to go from level 25 - 40
---
shaman rapper here, I go by the name of T-Hex
---
Classic doesn't NEED advertising; pretty much everyone who is interested in vanilla already knows about it.
---
It's a niche game for a niche audience, it's not meant to have widespread appeal.
---
I severely doubt the mobs respawn at a rate of 3 per minute.  (One every 33 seconds).  I remember in vanilla I was able to clear most of them solo before respawns.  I can't imagine there being enough to support 8 people efficiently killing them.
---
In my experience top raiders just used their tier sets, so everyone knew they were badass.
---

My Orc Mage was named Thex, generator works perfectly!

---
Unfortunately I can't commission that fast. I'm not interested in attempting it unless there is wide-spread interest. I'll see where we're at at launch.
---
Allegedly on Nost mobs hit way harder than they should have.
---
You can comfortably farm Mara as BM with lvl 60 blues, so if Retail has weaker mobs then it should be doable at 60 as MM.
---
Yeah, it just dosn't seem very likely. Someone did some napkin math on the rep tho and it was about 3-4hrs for 8 people to get the rep done with no contesting groups. So it seems doable for people who don't need as much preraid bis Like Mages/locks.
---
High quality shitpost
---
THe only way I could see it happening is 80 people sharing 40 accounts to level 24/7.
---
Give it time, as classic takes hold and becomes a stronger game than retail blizz will start to conform.  We have to prove it's worth their time.  Let's get the game released first.
---
It was my identity back when I played. It's how I was known.
---
but you can easily tank as fury prot at bad gear levels too.. I mean it may not be optimal, but its not horrible. I would prefer deep prot for early 5 mans at 60 sure, but fury prot is just fine too.
---
Who hurt you?!
---
Rise of the Horde ain t 70 years before classic. 30 max.
---
Beautiful, thank you for sharing!
---
I think world first is still pretty respectable.
---
Besides the leveling zerg, you'll actually have to play the class really well and have a huge amount of coordination with your team.
---
I was 100% sure im goin **MAGE**. Was researching for weeks and lvld up to 47lvl on pserver. But then i tried to lvl **HUNTER** and i loved it too. I need help picking one! HALP!
---
They have? I'd kill for classic Wrath, now that I actually have money and some autonomy to for raids.
---
It seems to be blizzards stance on world firsts over all, and not specifically related to Classic?
---
I have another awesome Shaman name lined up if all goes to heck.

Suicide
---
I got banned for 1 thousand years on the OW forums for saying Mercy players are like a cult.  Seemed pretty innocuous for a 1000 year ban, I think the threshold is pretty low.

This is very interesting and made me quite happy. Less hit rating means more space for crit strike.
---
Wait do people actually spam this
---
Whoops my bad
---
So people are really gonna pay five bucks a name to camp names on every wow server?
---
Oh I'm referring to Microsoft refund scams
---
This is a weird way to shitpost about Thex but I'm into it
---
I'm not an addons expert, but that seems way beyond the scope of what addons are allowed to do.
---
And if you found a way to make it happen, you'd likely get banned
---
I rolled on an RP server on release, and have spent all my time bouncing between RP and RP-PvP servers.
---
Not everyone will be in character, you will actively have to go out and find RP guilds &amp; groups if you want to remain 100% in character. It's hard to run a dungeon or raid and remain in character when someone's shouting "sheep the moon!" or "loot the damn core hounds!". That said, I've been a part of a guild that was 100% in character and we focused on world PvP.
---
World PvP is where a lot of roleplaying truly shines. Factions will pick places they consider "home" and will defend those areas any time someone attacks. I've dropped groups only to join up in a huge PvP raid to take back an area. Without an RP-PvP server, a lot of the roleplay guilds may require its members to always be flagged for PvP.
---
The best part about RP servers though would have to be player-driven events to foster roleplaying. I remember one event where we were in EPL and having a "party" (chatting, telling tales, passing out drinks and food) only to have an Alliance raid crash the party and we ended up fighting back and forth for a few hours. The entire event was planned by both guild masters, and we all really had an incredible time.
---
Here's a guild I was part of briefly, but you can see how using communication (forums at the time), helped foster rivalries on the server: https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Guild%3ABlacktooth_Grin_(The_Venture_Co_US)
---
Addons are not cheats. Is it cheating to record AH prices on a piece of paper? Is it cheating to use an egg timer to assist you with ability cooldowns? No, it's just a waste of time.. this is why addons were created, to save time.
---
The second I clicked on the thread I knew it'd be Thex, but I still did it for the keks. Good job.
---
If that's not right, I wish it was, because that's a fantastic name.

A critter I see ;)

It would be amazing if they had another wow episode when their new season comes out, just to capitalize on the classic wow hype.

And no free tele to entrance on logout
---
Wiiiillllllsoooooooooon!
---
80 people accounting sharing will get you to 60 fast enough, but you’re still at the mercy of rng to gear them enough to even have a shot at enough dps/fire resist/etc
---
It's not the question if 20 meme spec DPS are enough, but whether the rest of the non-meme spec players are geared and skilled enough to carry this fight. 
---
Assuming that BWL is the actual content, and you have raid progression with only MC gear present (keep in mind that a lot of MC loot is also gated and comes in phase 2 or even 3) - unlikely. In AQ40+ gear level - most probably.
---
I think that was after the aq stuff so you couldn't transfer for scarab lord
---
The Swedish people make the best metal music.  Completely unrelated but I needed to air out some facts.
---
Troll shaman named Thex
---
I think you're missing the point. OP's post is admitting that he's not gonna be min/maxing everything. Not trolling. He's gonna get stuff wrong and fuck other things up, and that's what makes vanilla - wrath so great.
---
Pretty sure this post isn't about deliberately sabotaging the game for inducing rage on others. Which is what trolling is.
---
hit rating gear doesnt even exist
---
Hogger - RP-PvP
---
Yes. Priest please!!
---
You underestimate my power.
---
New server names.  They stated they weren't going to reuse old names to make it less confusing.
---
I'm hoping for a Hogger (PvP) server.
---
You could simply ignore them. Unless you feel as if you are the holder of the only opinions that should be held.
---
I am German and it worked for me weeks ago, because I had "starter accounts" for both EU and US for many years. That's also why I never understood why so many people weren't able to download classic while I could without any beta access or subscription :-D
---
Wait a minute... Something's off.
---
Oh, I know. There's no graveyard near this Thex bar!
---
Enjoy your corpse run, ladies.
---
I'm hoping to see Alexstrasza again. Poor server went dead after WOTLK.
---
I'm split between a Hunter/Rogue can't decide which one to play. Things I like about each class are.
---
Hunter-pet class, ranged DPS, can kite, movement speed buffs, easy gold farming, being able to solo and not rely on others.
---
Rogue- STEALTH, catch people off guard in wpvp, stunlock, pickpocket, high DPS, lockpicking, combo point system, and not being reliant on others.
---
Literally can't decide.
---
Yikes...
---
Says the guy trolling the r/classicwow sub 247.
---
Remy, is that you?
---
How much will I struggle to heal level 60 5 mans as a shadow priest?  I want to stay shadow for pvp and farming but I'm aware that I'll likely get stuck healing in dungeons.
---
What did he say?!?! The curiosity is killing mua
---
Did u follow the instructions?
---
&gt; Are there a lot of people who still enjoy it?

how does each xpac outsell the previous one then?

Oh he most definitely won't be able to

Well yeah and it’s getting kinda annoying, 60% of the posts are named Thex sth. Few days ago people were complaining about the quality content in this subreddit... now we got Thex. Yay.
---

Everyone who watched it should.
---
59min later...still waiting for the link bro
---
Havent had a sub since December.  I was able to use the Drop down menu in the Wow splash page and download the classic client.  It was like 3.8 gigs.
---
Atleast it's not permament
---
As a Swede, I can definitely say that our finnish brothers are not too far behind.
---
7.2k hp unbuffed blimey.  i remember a time when all our minds were blown because apparently some guy on our server had reached 10k and became a kind of celebrity  
---
we also had a guy who was infamous for ruling the AH and being obscenely rich - he was called Quanthomen (Dunemaul EU) and he paid guilds to take him on raids and give him certain items.  We took him along once, it was strange haha
---
Nah, T3 came from naxx, so WotLK
---
Lol shit. Sorry. I totally forgot
---
I'm just here for Thex.
---
dont be dissuaded from "rushing".
---
 just because people are gonna literally skip portions of the game and no life it, doesnt mean that if you got to 60 as fast as you could means you are "rushing"
---
there are guilds that have been speed running this stuff on private servers for almost a decade.  It's totally possible guess we'll see
---
You'll be in for a rude awakening

sopa :D

Är lite jelly över T3 shoulders, få saker som ser bättre ut in Vanilla än warriors T3.
---
fell for that one too in loch modan. good old days
---
Hey look its Thex!
---
This is one o the big reasons they're going to have layering. 
---
If they create enough servers to handle the population spikes at each new phase, a lot of servers will die when the population drops back to normal levels. 
---
Using layering allows fewer servers to handle the same number of players without queues, and when the populations die down a bit the layering will just turn off.
---
Add time gating flying behind multiple reps that is just BORING.
---
Yes you can, there's big dps checks in classic that you can't overcome with some decent preparation(getting your prebis and using consumes) and maybe a worldbuff here or there even if you are using 30 ret paladins as your dps.
---
The reason people do not want "meme specs" is because such players are just getting carried though raids. They play their fun spec while others have to play proper PvE specs. Another problem is that there's no bosses that are just "dps checks" every second the boss is alive is a chance something goes wrong, yes you can kill vaelstraz with an average of 400 dps in your raid but that means you have to do tank swaps, healers have to keep the raid and tanks alive doing that long encounter, and there's a constant risk of people fucking up the bomb.
---
Not on LH and as far as I know that's blizzlike. It was changed in TBC
---
You don't have to enjoy something to do it.
---
Opeth alone makes Sweden top tier.  Children of Bodom make Finland close though.
---
Take link and add "emov" after the r in Reddit making it removeddit
---
Why do people even want advertising? Is the “no changes” crowd the same people that demand advertising? Does the game even become more enjoyable with more advertising?
---
its the second zone in the game.  
---
chances are you never encountered an elite before or made the connection that this means anything else than cooler portrait frame.
---
I think he meant that you could keep your T3 gear equipped until lvl 70. I think it was possible for some slots to keep the set bonuses, but you had to sacrifice some stats.
---
Fascists
---
don't tell bullshit.  
---
Naxx gear lasted well into around lvl 65, and some things were useful until lvl 70 rare dungeon pieces.
---
Wtf is thex?
---
it was
---
1.12 server though, I don't think they specified if that it would be a phase 6 thing or not.
---
Moonkin / elem shaman can actually just DPS DPS DPS constantly because they won't go OOM on Vael so it might be one of the few fights where they can shine!
---
pew pew pew pew
---
Yeah my sub ended today,  I'll resub on Aug 12th to create my 3 classic toons to reserve their names.
---
Thats also how you die irl
---
Fascists!
---
Finding that rare whelping in Wetlands.
---
Youre right. I missed the point.
---
From what I remember, yes Shadowguard can proc that.  Not sure if it was changed in patch 1.12 or not.
---
Taking into account talents and such, at 40 you do less than half the damage of a mage just using blizzard. On top of that, you don't have a ranged pull or any good movement abilities to gather up mobs. I don't think it's worth it until you get Consecration and the final Prot talent, or the blessing down Prot and improved ret aura, and at least a shield spike, but if you want to switch it up, go for it, it isn't going to fail, it just isn't going to be really fast.
---
at level 39, if you know you are going to be short of gold to get a mount at 40 go to Swamp of Sorrows and grind Jaguars, they drop very good vendor trash items and the exp is okay enough to not slow down your level time too much. I think I got around 25g grinding 39-40 there just vendoring the trash.
---
They also drop Wicked Claws which are used for Lionheart Helm so hold on to those to sell on the AH when people get to 60.
---
What did you think when I literally stole your thread and the whole thing spiralled out of control
---
Just filtering out everything with Thex would be nice, most of the look what my gf made for me are just guys who want the internet to know that they aren’t a virgin.
---
Go fury warrior, enc shaman is a meme.
---
we didn't.  that is mostly urban legends..  I was in full tier2 /tier 2.5 and I kept most gear well  until around lvl 66 and even then it only was replaced by the really good blue quest rewards / dungeon drops with gem sockets.  Most random boe greens were still inferior
---
&gt; It's a niche game for a niche audience, it's not meant to have widespread appeal. 
---
So, when Classic comes out and has more subscribers playing it than BFA does, which of the two will be the niche game for the niche audience, and which will be the one with widespread appeal?
---
Thex don't need to pay for having a mount, that's the mount who pay Thex to have him on her back !
---
&gt;Layering won’t affect dead servers, all layers are within the same server, no cross server people.
---
They can run fewer servers at launch if they use layers. 
---
If they create enough unique servers to handle the big wave of people at each new phase, a lot of servers will end up dead in between content releases. Instead, layering allows each server to go over capacity during those spikes, so there is still a solid population when things balance out.
---
Just curious what you plan to main? You sound like you have gone through a similar decision process as me.
---
Crul'shorukh should be significantly better for orcs because of the axe skill.
---
Did you just assume his gender
---
It's not that harmless when the sub and every comment section is being spammed by this low effort "meme".
---
It was funny in the original thread and maybe a few other name related threads, but now it has turned into spam.
---
And this sub doesnt need even more spam...
---
Hunters are less affected by hit rating too, yeah? Could make even more sense than just fast leveling.
---
A guy made a thread about names a few days ago and said he’ll be a troll shaman named Thex. Now it’s meme.
---
I just wish i could not use the launcher at all, ever. I don't need their launcher for the 1 game that i play.
---
Lol. Hanging out in the &lt;30 zones trying to level... Talk about crowded..
---
Ahh I see what you meant, yea that’s my understanding too.
---
i tried to track down the source, but I think it started with a thread asking what they will name their main. OP said Thex, then everyone else commented they would name their character Thex.
---
Perhaps you're right. But I did need to pack it away for better DPS items while lvling to 70, maybe that's what I'm remembering..
---
This one is great.. because it makes you think a bit then you're like THEXXXX
---
/shrug
---
I guess it was meant to be.
---
Ass candy is a hunter weapon
---
If it's anything like the Rogue mace stuns in original vanilla, the target becomes immune to them after a small number of procs!  Or at least that's what I recall from playing my Rogue.
---
This has been reported countless times but it seems like the mods don't care enough to track down the bug and fix it
---
When a man loveth a woman very much...
---
Ahh ok ty ^^
---
Well done!  I was almost at the end of my rope with the whole Thex thing. This has reinvigorated me.
---
Talkstopigeons?
---
I think for this topic it is fine though.  Clearly marked as "Humor" and a name generator link.  I knew instantly what it was going to be.
---
I agree that bringing it up in unrelated posts is a bit much, but for certain topics Thex stuff is fine.
---
Thex will do it day 1
---
Fastest 1-60 on actual classic back in the day was right around 4 days played. The routes have been improved a bit since then but no one has really been able to test them on an official classic server though so who knows if they really are better. 
---
I'd bet on record pace being around 3.5 days and people dedicated enough to try for a week 1 or 2 rag should be able to do it in at most 5
---
Blizzard, I want there to be a server named Thex. And it better be pvp.
---
Also T3 is a tanking set. You won't much blockvalue while leveling.
---
I used to keep a Japanese hibachi place in business because I went there for nearly every dinner and many of my lunches. I was too busy doing that stupid Warlord grind to ever cook or even leave the house for more than just take-out.
---
Hmm, OK. Thanks
---
I read up on a 'choose your class guide' for Vanilla, and I'm now a bit more open to other classes (warrior, rogue, hunter), but also somewhat more sold on mage - haha. I guess I have a few weeks to decide.
---
Deleted... Suspiciously... They got to him!
---
When I roll orc warrior hes definitely a barbarian type warrior, he will wear a dress if it helps camouflage him. His name is Crunk
---
Looks great! A suggestion to help you optimize for mobile viewing, as the image is shrunk fown on mobile: Simplify the poop icon to not have the circle or text behind it; just a clear pile of poop so it's easily identifiable. Make the spec icons used for the ratings bigger and clearer (less transparency) as it's difficult to see what they are on mobile.
---
I wasn't sure if it was a poop symbol until I opened the image and zoomed in. I didn't know the ratings were for the specs until I zoomed in; just thought they were arbitrary ratings out of three for each category.
---
Good job! Keep it up!
---
Most of these were given to DPS first though. Maladath being wanted by most fury warriors and rogues.
---
And what if I send 1 bronze?
---
I think I did hear mention of outside help
---
Oh cool, I hope he is playing classic.
---
Updating to the latest Firfox DE fixed this for me 3-4 days ago.
---
yeah but those T3 gears are all protection gears, you don't use them to level toon.
---
It is like a wannabe haiku

*laughs in Reddit Enhancement Site m Suite*
---
People smarter than /r/classicwow
---
Do you mind sharing that one with us?
---
We are aware of the issue, though currently do not know what is causing it. We do have plans to update the CSS in the next month, so our focus has been there, which will hopefully fix all issues. 
---
In the meantime you can uncheck "show this subreddit's theme" over in the sidebar, or disable it with RES.
---
I'm thinking your issues stem much further than wow art.
---
You farm 5 tribs at the same time
---
&gt;get to be good at farming, pvp, dungeons, and raids all at onc
---
Literal who?
---
you know all but 1 mage in your raids are arcane frost? A spec that is completely useless outside of raids right? And once AQ is out, everyone is fire which is even worse for farming and pvp
---
I guess you could argue that people just want more people playing the game in general. More success for WoW classic means "more of it" in the future, whatever that actually ends up meaning.
---
There's also the tinfoil hatters that think because Blizz is pretty quiet about it it means that "Activision knows its doomed to fail no resources allocated dead within a month blizzard doesn't about it at all".
---
Probably going to regret leaking his name when people are going to be fighting for it
---
What is the name of the zg set? for the blue vs the epic set?
---
Wow, I got the coolest name ever for my Tauren Shaman(not gonna tell you guys here so you couldn't steal the name)\~!
---
Yeah, I'm pretty sure I'm leaning this way as well.  I'll probably mess with Marks to see how I like it, but ultimately I'm not going to be a dedicated raider, nor am I going to be trying to hit R14, so I could probably get away with whatever if I'm just doing casual pvp and dungeons with friends.
---
That's the content I sub for
---
Leveling frost is nice because you can eventually start to AoE grind, is generally more mana efficient, and the survivability is a notch better but fire is fine too and also lot of fun.
---
They might have a better chance now, as there will be Thexes all over, and when they whisper one and ask if it's you, fThex can point them here.
---
That's probably it! TIL, thank you!
---
aye at the time this was when t1 was uncommon and most people didnt even know what a flask was.  i thought 4k hp was crazy
---
I think I replaced my last vanilla epics with karazhan/Gruuls-loot.

All the PvE servers have Horde faction names and the PvP have Alliance to help balance the factions.  Big brain ideas
---
That’s more or less what I’m wondering. I was level 56 when TBC dropped so I never raided Vanilla, but I’d imagine there was at least one DPS check in MC prior to Rag, right?
---
So can you really go in there with what is likely the lvl 45-55 green/blues (can’t imagine given the speed leveling your gear would be much higher) and make it all the way to Rag and down him without at least *some* 60 dungeon gear?
---
Oh don't get me wrong racism is on both sides of the pond, it's just Americans seem far more happy in my experience to open with racist comments, calling one another various racial or sexist slurs. Europeans tend to target racism when talk goes that way, rather than being the base of humour if that makes sense. At least that is what I noticed on Nost and such like.
---
I just scheduled off wed-fri of release week! HYPE!
---
yah i mean, pantheon is in a good development direction. Literally everysingle thing they said design philosophy wise is good, the art direction is good, the spell animations and graphics they have shown off look good, the recent wall climbing/ledge climbing and jumping looks really fucking cool for a MMO.
---
It's going to be an actual good MMO, probably the first good MMO since vanilla wow.
---
As Tank + Heal, no it does not open up any options. You will still need DPS with you to effectivly farm.
---
OP is Thex.. we are all Thex.
---
Ligma.
---
Yeah, guess we need to make room for the other 100+ posts such as "When are servers announced" and "Why aren't Blizz Advertising?" and "Offspecs can clear content."
---
I see what you are saying, but there is literally nothing to talk about for the time being until character creation date starts.  Any legitimate questions can be answered by doing google searches.  There are 15 years worth of vanilla/classic WoW data.
---
Unfortunately mana is not as big an issue on shamans as resistance is. Warlock curses do not affect nature which is all shamans can do, so the bosses have huge nature resistance and don't get the 10% damage increase.
---
My main issue is still Alliance vs Horde.  In retail I was always alliance (besides a few low level alts).  All my friends were alliance, and that's what I'm used to leveling up as.  I'm not sure if any of my friends are coming back for classic, so it might be a good opportunity to try horde.  I'm just not excited about Ogrimmar or Kalimdor in general :(  I dunno.  Stick to what I know I enjoy? Or try something new and hope for the best?
---
See you at release! HYPE!
---
This is getting out of hand :D
---
There is no chance of this happening.
---
hearing it like this, i suddenly realise it's quite similar to the pirates of the carribbean theme :O
---
I swear if someone steals my Gokmok for my Orc Rogue I will flip
---
I got perma banned about 7 years ago because I replied on a post that someone people play on a private server because they like the Classic experience.
---
You know casters get constantly knocked back unless if they have a protection pot up right?
---
What are some other names you might be considering as alternatives?
---
Priest next!!!
---
Can we get an update on this addon and the effort into it?
---
It’s 1 week after classic launches
---
That's a good point!
---
The guild is mismanaged at that point and raids will be slowwww.
---
Even though i'm getting sick of this Thex shit. This post was funny as hell.
---
That last line perfectly sums up the state of this sub.
---
You won't go wrong with mage, it's likely the best all around caster and the second best class in total in this game. Also happens to be a lot of fun.
---
One of the coolest things in Vanilla is how much fun questing and leveling can be - you might aswell try a few classes and see which one fits you the best.
---
Oooh. Duhh haha. Thank you:)
---
Not having Alchemy during leveling kind of defeats its purpose.
---
I'll be there from the first minute, its going to be hectic but I can't wait!
---
It's technically possible but highly improbable
---
&gt; Do you think any of the casters set up burst into non-CC'd targets? 
---
Shamans can do it in literally 2 seconds from 36 yards, 20 with the shock.
---
Mages can do it with all instant cast spells
---
and if we are talking CC'd targets the mage wins out with the poly'd target with max zerking and MQG.
---
&gt; all of the specs you've mentioned are 3 minute meme specs 
---
Imagine thinking your warlock with succubus is reliable in pvp because other classes who have equal gear have a cooldown you don't have. You aren't walking around with 100% crit chance, you'll have at most like 17 to 20 crit. That means 2 spells critting is a 4% chance, 3 is less than 1% at 1/125 chance. **1/125 is very reliable to you?**
---
&gt; both the elemental shaman and the PoM Pyro mage will global one target and then get crushed 
---
Yes the mail class and the mage who can blink will get crushed by a warlock with succubus is the slippery class? I just don't see how you think the highest hitting combination of spells (mages, especially if they roll their ignites) necessarily means the best burster, which is why I say shaman and not mage.
---
I would like to main a warrior tank, but I am not going into Classic with a pre-established guild so I will just have to see what happens. With isolated servers back I think that process can happen more organically again where I tank dungeons at 60, meet people, and then find a guild that way.
---
If there isn't a tanking role available there is a very good chance I will try and reroll a rogue instead. It's the one class I've played occasionally (via test server imports or friends accounts) and enjoyed but never really had as my own.
---
As I mentioned I will have a mage alt too, but it's more of a side project I'd like for P2 DM farming. I also think mage gear isn't very interesting in P1 with only a handful of good items out of MC. DM really opens up the gear options quite a bit.

Solo leveling, my list is:

2. Druid
---
3. Mage
---
4. Paladin
---
5. Warlock
---
6. Shaman
---
7. Priest

Duo leveling with my best friend, my list is:
---
1. Warrior
---
2. Priest
---
3. Paladin
---
4. Shaman
---
5. Druid
---
6. Warlock
---
7. Mage

---
Yeah, I'm from NA as well and I downloaded it a few days ago
---
It’s still great every time I watch it, roughly once every other year!
---
I plan on doing the same on my rogue. But then having a warlock as my 2nd/alt main. For the rogue I'm going to do skinning/mining then drop skinning after 60 **but not right away**. After trying some devilsaur farming and finishing up odds and ends questing I will switch over to engineering. But like I said, while leveling I will keep my eye on some guides for power leveling engineering like  [https://legacy-wow.com/engineering-1-300/](https://legacy-wow.com/engineering-1-300/)  and bank the matts on either my rogue bank or bank alts so when the time comes to level engineering, I will have already done the sunken cost and it will feel smooth transitioning even if I'm off by several materials. 
---
For my warlock alt I am actually going to go skinning/herbalism. I am going to bank the tailoring matts while I level which almost all come from just killing humanoids. I am going to like you go engineering on my warlock, dropping skinning, but I am not going to go tailoring and drop herbalism until ZG bloodvine set comes out. I will buy the low level matts on AH for engineering and then probably farm the more expensive thorium/mithiril ore on my rogue and feed them to the lock for his engineering. 
---
I would suggest combining the two strategies for your warlock and don't be so eager to level tailoring right at 60 during phase 1 or 2. From a video I was watching the other day, the early MC pre-raid bis tailoring robe for warlocks robe of the void is a pretty darn rare recipe drop from scholomance that you either need to get or buy off the AH and it's not going to be cheap. I would keep tailoring on the back burner till you get that and make a little bit extra with either skinning or mining. I guess you can shoot for the felcloth set but that's up to you as well.
---
Is there like a discord or something where everyone who wants to do RP-PVP is coordinating?
---
is this what got you banned? bad dad jokes

The official forums really are a special group.

This is the type of shitposting I come to reddit for.
---
Lots of talk from who? The people posting incessantly in this sub spreading fear about how Blizzard and everyone who worked on classic secretly hates it and wants it to fail and they want to lose money on it? Those people? Ya, they sound like a trustworthy bunch, best to join in with them and reap the profits of the fear yourself eh?

---
How is it off-topic when he was directly replying to a comment? Why do you even get to decide?
---
 With guys like you around it's no wonder OP gets tempted to insult people over stupid opinions.
---
It is made as a joke. Specially with this meme template. Fury is great. But I do think a lot of warriors might get discouraged by how weird the spec is early in the game.
---
I remember this feeling, it's awesome. Your appreciation was definitely noticed!
---
you give a +14 year old game to much credit in terms of difficulty. If meme specs do such low dps that it becomes a factor in killing the boss, its more a player issue rather than the spec. There are tons of guides out there to help players who do decide to pick up a meme spec, check out: https://classicwow.live/
---
Paladin + mage both AOE spec would outfarm warrior tank + healer priest duo.  Mage + priest would also work, although could be a little more risk in some dungeons with not enough room to kite.
---
Not tanking in Savage Gladiator Chain? Virgin Deep Prot Tank detected.

I would think a server named Hogger would attract streamers like Asmongold

If an organized guild couldnt do it then it is out of the realm of possibility that a pug would

What post hates on STV?  I would to see this madmans ramblings.
---
Yeah man. Unless you're really sure that you're gonna push raiding, just play what your gut tells you.
---
Which is fucking hard to do, my gut tells me like 10 different classes which is why I'm playing druid I think haha
---
It's not. It's really not.
---
If this isn't a gnome of some kind, I will be heavily disappointed.
---
It’s only game, why you have to be mad?
---
It's because the current classic version that can be downloaded is not the live version. But way to just read all the weird misinformed fearmongering and then further it instead of the blue post that was linked yesterday saying as much.
---
Sorry I don't fully understand. So Rep being shared within the group at full value for each member is vanilla blizz like?
---
I've always loved STV.  It has great quests, great visuals, several hubs/areas, variety of enemies, and the zone lasts quite a long time.  IDK why people dislike it.
---
Have you been there on a populated pvp server during prime time?
---
There's a reason people often refer to it as "STV-nam"
---
That’s not an example of when blizzard gave a specific date than pushed it back after the fact.
---
As far as I’m ware blizzard has NEVER given a release date for an expansion or a patch than pushed it back.
---
Same but if I go into the WoW folder and then classic I can just run wow.exe and the glorious login screen appears
---
What's your favorite band?
---
This is the ONLY answer!
---
For Thex sake chill out man.
---
Yeh no, that's not a new game. That's an expansion to an already developed game.
---
The top guild would be all named thex in some variation
---
Fastest 1-60 doesn't really matter. 
---
What is the fastest levelling for shit-tier classes like Paladin? No raid is happening without them.
---
The real question is, will this make playing a druid even more miserable, for pvp purposes
---
Agreed.  Time to leave.
---
Man I’m working til 11 on the 26th (UK) so I will have to sprint home as technically it launches 23:00 26th august uk time right?
---
ITs already being coordinated :) 
---
http://nordicclassic.jinnis.se/
---
Thats the page for these guilds and its not yet including our group with 250+ ppl who are about to be added to the list aswell.
---
No, they never removed one of the test versions from the launcher and some people have access to that. The live version is not available yet. If you do weird things to download the test version you will just have to redownload the live version.
---
Oh, is that the reason? I don’t play pvp.
---
&gt; variety of enemies
---
Such as humans, gnomes, dwarves and night elves
---
Are you familiar with [Muphry's Law?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muphry%27s_law)
---
Yeah fuck that guy! Fuck me for laughing! Fuck unfunny things! Fuck life! Fuck everything!
---
Yeah. If we spent hundreds or thousands planning for a vacation and you double down with this much notice... You'll be filling out no call no show paperwork the first day I requested off.
---
Your operational staffing issues are not MY problem. You don't own me.
---
And mine was intended to be a joke.
---
O I c. I never really played PVP.  Makes sense
---
Doesn't matter who I heard from, but they had any intentions of putting classic in its own tab on the list then they would've done it months before just like Call of Duty that gets added months before release in its own place on the list for every different game sequel (Call of Duty: MW / Call of Duty: BO4)
---
So get your facts right before you decide to bash posts
---
Is the auaction house linked to the other ones?
---
Thats when you start breaking out the X̂'s
---
3 pieces per boss for 40 people, and it’s a large loot table. I’ve gone 6 weeks without raid loot in phase 1 before. Some folks go longer. My guild will be doing alt splits to alleviate this.
---
It gets easier as more tiers are added but then people just want the new stuff.
---
“Fan art” flair
---
I'm not thinking of a farming alt as efficient, rather I know I'll want to play two different classes for two different playstyles. If I'm interested in both raiding and gold making I may as well put those two characters on the same server and faction so I can take advantage of the synergy. /shrug

Good day to you!
---
It sure is.
---
Well if you're going to be this disingenuous there's no point in continuing. Large businesses change strategy under the guides of great leadership and rise to prominence and wild success and vise versa. Sure you can do simple case studies on comparing companies' rise and falls like xerox, apple v1 and v2 under Steve Jobs, Microsoft under Bill Gates vs IBM, the current state of GE and Sears or Nike vs Reebock and say "it's not rocket science"; but the fact of the matter is business strategy, tactics, culture, and leadership matter and can make a huge difference -- and the top end CEO's of these companies don't just wing it but spend 7 days a week studying how to improve sales, how to make a better product, etc.
---
No, you don't. The live version of the game is not available yet. If you create a US account it may let you download the test version which would work if they do another stress test but it's not the live version of the game. The live version will be available closer to release and will obviously be available in all regions, and probably on its own tab because it would be incredibly stupid not to.
---
It’s not funny, more like annoying af.

On or before the 12th.
---
This is my life story.
---
Leave then
---
If you find out let me know please.
---
Thats why I use intimidate and full CDs near 50%, to skip that interphase from Landslide  
---
About the values, well, I've seen the damages, values etc, and according to the database from vanilla WoW (wowhead, wowdb, etc), the values are the same or almost the same. Ofc we'll have to wait for Classic if we wana see how different can it be, but I guess that it's similar to what is shown at the video.
---
The live version of classic isn't available for download yet, it will become available closer to release at which point everyone will have access to it (Obviously).
---
100% chance there's a Thex on every server
---
Haha, and some animals stuff too...
---
3 per min is 1 per 20 sec, no?

Good to see some of the old Feenix bois doing good things.   Enjoyed raiding with you guys! Good luck in classic!

I would talk about server type with friends then assign one person to make the call when the 12th/13th hits
---
Honestly, I really don't know. I thought about pinging one of the weekly LFG posts to see if anyone was willing to set up rivaling guilds on an RP server, where factions and story lines could be roleplayed out.
---
If we can't have an RP-PvP server, I hoped to find others who were willing to bring world PvP back to the classic roleplay servers (along with hysterical drama that world PvP brings).
---
Ah yes, the old ''our corporate overlords know best and only wants whats good for us''.

It does matter, once you have your hunters and warlocks at 60 they can start mob tagging for the healers and tanks
---
Classic isn’t a new game :)
---
Linked with the other neutral auction houses. Not the faction specific ones.
---
Some people have bosses that aren't total jerk offs and can be talked to like humans.
---
4k crazy? For a non-warrior perhaps. A pre-raid geared warrior tank will have about 4.5k hp unbuffed.
---
You will see...
---
8-10 is correct.  In recent private servers, they completed it in 10 days for the first Ragnaros kill.
---
As far as I know
---
It is linked to gadgetzan and everlook, not major citied
---

Do you have an example state? I live in a pretty liberal state and if someone wants to deny vacation.. that's fine.. as long as it's not on going.

They will quit until next raid tier after 1 month
---
Get a BiS warlock trinket ninja'd to a boomkin with sub-par dps.  GM was a prot warrior and he was buddy buddy with the boomkin... worst part was the boomkin was my roommate at the time.
---
Does blizzard care about its players? Enough to give them the information they need to best enjoy their product?
---
Not a priority... as if it's some monumental task to make up some names and list them. The shit ppl will defend baffles me.
---
Looks like you’ve got a case of Updog
---
You raiding funerals or what?
---
Some bis items are like level 40 blues. Dps can go in mostly greens. Mc is mostly just "don't stand in the fire" and cc.
---
No dps check pre-rag. The only thing DPS need to out pace is healer mana running out. Even with Rag added in his DPS check is to beat him before second sons of rag come out since that'd be really hard on healer mana. IIRC the DPS needed for that is not that high, especially with 1.12 talents and 2019 knowledge.

---
That's around about how most original jokes on reddit are
---
How about Updog
---
Skarm explains how to gear your character, its important to know yours stats and caps
---
For example, replacing a peice of hit gear for an item on a BIS list, but now you are under hit cap, now you take a dps/threat loss
---
Everyone *but* the art team haha
---
With absolutely no new information, who cares. I'm calling dibs on Thexbot nobody take it please.
---
Yeah dawg all those useful horde paladins
---
They repeatedly wouldn't admit that there was way more content during the first year than the second year for players who started at launch. How is that not delusional?  
---
Are you going to tell me that if you played Vanilla WoW at launch, that there was more to do post-ZG?
---
You guys are depressing. He made a post, everybody jokingly said they were gonna take the same name and people memed about the situation, why do y'all need to say this isn't funny or shit? I don't see you posting anything, even less anything interesting... Deal with what you get or get the fuck out of the sub.
---
How good does it feel knowing that this whole THEX thing has gotten under so many people's skin? 
---
This sub has so many keyboard warriors raging like crazy over this. They get so mad over the dumbest shit. Although it was unplanned, I would like to thank you for providing some humor to my day.
---
Are you sure about that? I remember posting stuff at the alliance auction house in storm wind and seeing those items at the Vail auction house. Unless they all became linked during the burning Crusade’s
---
With absolutely no new information, who cares. I'm calling dibs on Thexdoll nobody take it please.
---
There’s gonna be some xp fall off though, so the pace isn’t really going to be any faster.
---
No one knows. They said they'd release them before name reservation to give people a chance to co-ordinate.
---
Educated guess? The 5th, a week before name reservation.
---
Hey actually I happened to just find one when I was checking old comments I was keeping an eye on.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cjkm1a/world_of_warcraft_classic_census_and_demographics/evej4ph/
---
For the EU lol.
---
Argent Dawn EU during wotlk. I don’t mind a bit of casual RP. For example, while levelling I’d be “in character” but I wouldn’t go out of my way to do special RP events or sit in Goldshire! My RP character grew organically. Didn’t have a backstory or anything, I was playing a human mage who was actually a 10,000 year old demon trapped inside the body lol. It was fun!
---
It was funny inside the thread. It was also funny when it became a running gag for day. Now we are into day 2 and it's getting a bit too much. But if you haven't experienced it from the original thread, you shouldn't call it not funny. It was.
---
Yeah, on the non carebears servers the zone is a notorious pvp hot spot.
---
One of the many reasons to never play pve servers
---
"My God, we have reached 10M active subscribers. What the hell have we done with the last few addons?"
---
The concern is that players will progress through the content much faster this time.
---
The shit ppl will make up to defend their corporate masters is baffling dude. Doesn't matter how small the needle or how big the haystack, they'll dive the fk in and find you a turd if it means their favorite company is still perfect.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/forums&amp;topic=163496
---
Alot of people aren't going to be interested in playing bootleg servers, so considering that, 150k is an impressive number. With official servers, with actual blizzard support, and sub tied to retail, there will be alot more classic players for sure.
---
Why would they? Call of Duty has pre-orders to sell. What are people going to do? look at a tab and go "Oh WoW Classic, oh I can't play it? Okay whatever then" And then go back about their lives for months and just get used to ignoring the tab? Maybe it would make more sense if they put it in its own tab closer to release when people could look at it and go "WoW classic, releasing soon, and I can play it with just a subscription? cool let me do that." You know, the sort of thing that makes sense if you've ever worked in an industry selling things to people.
---
Maybe you could get your facts right before you decide to make trash posts.
---
what?
---
there is no heroic or mythic
---
this is a joke right?
---
Yes. Neutral AH are seperate from faction AH's in vanilla.
---
Stv level ranges between 29-51 for quests, and its very stretched favoring mounts and theres lots of running. Since the level gap is so huge, youre not only running away from the bored max levels, but also fellow questers who prey on the weak.
---
On top of if being the most favored ganking zones, it also houses a level 60 raid, which puts an extreme amount of high levels all across the zone for more ganking potential.
---
The quests are also quite grindy, but its really mostly travel and ganking people hate it for
---
Me am that kind of orc.
---
Item values will vary by server.
---
No having fun before 27th! D:&lt;
---
streamer only beta test was **THE** ad
---
I love it, it's like a battleground you can quest in.
---
"useless before naxx". &lt;------- what???
---
Context, really. The original post was probably an attempt to fish for name ideas. But he threw it out there that he was going to make a Shaman and name it Thex. Someone else a bit later made a post to discuss what people plan to play on classic launch. First guy to comment said "I'll probably play a troll shaman and name it Thex." And it's been a meme since. It's probably a bit overused by now but we still have 26 days till launch and we're making do with what we have here.
---
Rather ask, why is there so much *love* for it that everyone **needs** to be there even if it means hours of corpserunning.
---
It's the article 13 stuff in Europe.  This doesn't affect the US, but it is true and he is right.

Warrior should always tank levelling dungeons and just don’t bring warriors/ tell pala and hunter what gear is yours
---
Lol the rogue use drops by about 30% from pvp to pve
---
Ya same, was pretty locked in for Alli but my friend group has convinced be to reconsider.
---
I don't think finding a proper raid group will be an issue, I think I'll be more upset that I'm not a gnome later on, like months down the line 
---
I just wanna play a gnome D: but I also wanna play with my boiiiiz
---
I don't wanna be an ugly ass troll or UD, ew. Small people forever! 
---
I also hugely prefer alliance leveling zones AND cities.
---
BFA: Hold my Beta
---
That's true I've heard you can skip that phase with CC's and fast damage, good on you for being able to do that. 
---
Either way it's not profitable to do Landslide since you can barely fit 5 runs under the hour anyway. If you're utilizing parties to reset a dungeon you might be able to do a run in under 10 minutes, otherwise its gonna take 12 minutes+ to do a run and run from the graveyard in again.
---
You don't need much gear to clear MC with an experienced group. We don't really know how mutch fire resist is needed on the MT could be different from pservers. I think 7 days is doable by the best guilds if servers don't crash.
---
It is obvious that it offended players, because it addressed the lack of content added during the second year of the game.
---
I made a post asking why Blizzard did not add more content during the second year of the game, and how it could be a concern during Classic. I received some good answers, such as Blizzard was busy working on TBC or how many of the Vanilla developers were EQ Raiders. A lot of players here are oversensitive to criticism of Classic WoW.
---
This is the part I always found to be such bullshit about just adding 10 levels on the end and calling it "content"
---
They easily could have made an expansion that added dungeons and raids level 40-60 and maybe a battle ground or something and people would have been satisfied with it as new content.
---
Also put diablo2. Ffs.
---
I cringed too, but on a second thought, this exaggeration is fine for a meme.
---
I'm not sure I understand the question.
---
Your tier gear from raids only has one version. Typically that means any class that can heal has a healing tier set only, and warriors have a tank set only. This is not a hard stop to playing other specs, warriors for example do very well(too well some would say) as dps without using tier gear at all(well tier2.5 shoulder is amazing). Healers however usually are not able to raid as anything but heal, not just because of tier but also just that their other specs weren't designed for raiding. There are some exceptions like shadowpriest and feral druid that can work.
---
Prot pala does absolutely not work in raids though. Pretty decent for some dungeons though.
---
Early on when no one is geared, you will struggle quite a bit.
---
Swapping from shadowform out and back is like 10% of your total Mana, maybe more, it's just not practical to heal as shadow.
---
Im p sure there's a disc / shadow hybrid spec that is decent at healing though , but I don't play priest I don't know anything more about it than just hearing whispers lol
---
Sure but that was part of the retail t shirt thing no one cares about.
---
World's fastest 1-60 should be 4 days and 20 hours ( [https://www.joanasworld.com/](https://www.joanasworld.com/) ).  
---
In order to do Rag you will definitely need warriors and healers. Warriors are the slowest leveling class, and many healer classes are slow as well. Let's just SAY we could get all the required classes to 60 in 6 days played time through some aid from other players (Which would be extremely well done).
---
They'd need attunement to the core, but it can actually be done before you hit 60, so it could theoretically not add time to your Rag kill.
---
The fire res gear could theoretically be bought on AH, pretending that there would be any on the AH within the first week.  
---
The only real time constraint would probably be having to deal with Hydraxian Waterlords quests to get the 7 dousing items for the runes to summon Majordomo (Who summons Ragnaros). You have to kill some elementals in Silithus and Eastern Plaguelands and some trash in MC.  If you're a true speedrunner (Including warlock summons), you might be able to do this within an hour?
---
HOWEVER, you also need to kill Pyroguard Emberseer in UBRS. This requires an UBRS key. Again - this key can be acquired from other players, and you only need 7. Getting the key and the Pyroguard Emberseer kills for 7 players could probably be done within an hour(?). And these guys theoretically don't need to be a part of the MC run, as long as they just jump in to douse the runes in the raid.  
---
The hardest part is definitely whether OP talked about 7 days real time or played time. If it's real time, I think only a few players wouldn't die IRL in the attempt lol.  
---
TLDR; Theoretically possible, very very very unlikely.
---
Honestly, Classic is a community game. You're absolutely guaranteed to meet people while leveling and I feel it's often beneficial to let it happen organically.
---
You could use online resources to find a guild, which I'd compare to using tinder to find a date, or you could just run into people in the real world (Azeroth) and let the magic happen naturally.
---
Sorry if that metaphor didn't resonate with anyone
---
Yeah, My guild is worried the GM will be afk between server announcements and name reservation :P
---
Yeah i think i might stream it actually, i'll have to see how my living situation is at the moment of release. [Twitch.tv/Nagini101](https://Twitch.tv/Nagini101) Just in case.
---
There are a few places to look... but most recruitment will be in game, probably see a surge when we know servers.
---
Or just play the game and don’t expect to get every bit of gear you plan to get, because it won’t happen. This isn’t bfa
---
Idk man, you can probably pull in about 5 grand after expenses by selling Thex shirts right now.

Slow start to show me walking slowly through a graveyard or another eerie looking location.  Then when the song really kicks in, it cuts to me landing a huge crit on some unsuspecting, poor noob.

INTRUDER! What are you hiding...?
---
found the private server pro, link me ur sulfuras on day 1 bro
---
Warrior has the benefit of collecting tank gear then also being able to reserve stuff like dal rends if you need. A rogue/ hunt ain’t getting a tank or any physical dps if he tries to do that
---
People are soft carebears who don't care for world pvp.
---
Ahh yes, using the word snowflake to refer to people who disagree with you, that is a way of proving that you are a level-headed individual who does nothing wrong.
---
haha true, Some of the best times in classic had nothing to do with the rush, but all to do with chilling, farming, battlegrounding, and pvping with the occasional raids to cap off the nights
---
I hope they announce them a few days beforehand so people can coordinate where they're gunna go. I don't want to frantically pop between servers to try and get my name reserved just in case. :&lt;
---
You have to excuse him, he just found out he was HIV Thex.
---
They as in Thex Mallet?
---
https://wiki.project1999.com/Thex_Mallet
---
That makes sense to me, so realistically, as a dps you could zone into MC the second you ding 60.
---
Got a link?
---
I dont see this as particularly viable. Firstly it will take alot longer than grinding WHILE completing quests.  Secondly you will lose out on all the rep you gain from completing the quests, and thirdly you will lose out on all the gear and gold that comes from completing those quests.
---
So it will take longer, you'll hit 60 with shitty rep, while being poorly geared and skint.
---
Wouldnt be for me.
---
So you know that I haven’t watched it from his Chanel then? You didn’t make the video, or post it to YouTube so just stop.
---
Lol are really gatekeeping about what is valid as " thematic immersion"? Theres a reason warriors can wear all types of armor. Because its realistic and makes sense. What doesnt make sense? Spinning a whirlwind and swinging a giant weapon with full plate gear on! Needing to wear full plate gear as a dps warrior also doesnt make sense. Nothings hitting you.
---
&gt; unless this comment gets 100 upvotes
---
How many times do we have to teach you this lesson old man!
---
You also will have more troubles with harder mobs, those with higher level or elite. With warrior you generally want to outlevel the content/mobs by 1-2 to have a smooth time and be efficient.
---
Ah, hmm, what about holy nova?
---
Never called you fat so get your facts right periodboy
---
Awesome, I can see it in my mind.
---
Fucking Christ
---
I’ll be playing a horde mage, of course I don’t care about paladins. 
---
What I mean about changes is changes akin to those they have already made to ensure that the game launch won’t be a  WOD launch-level clusterfuck, macro API, easier reports and so on. We will also have better addons. I could even go for a modern graphics toggle. Of course I am not talking about class changes. Meme specs are destined to be meme specs.
---
Playing a remake of a game doesn’t mean I have to go through the shitty setup it had back then, and all the bugs that they since have fixed.
---
«No changes» already lost their fight.
---
Danonius approchaes
---
It's theoretically possible .
---
 Call it 4- 5 days real time to speed run to 60, 24 hours to get attuned and get pre bis for tanks while a few level some alch or engi briefly to get a couple people some consumes, make 7 people get quintessences to douse, then go . 
---
MC isn't terribly hard , it's more of a grind and ppl not fucking up
---
sure you need 30/40 people to clear MC but as long as you're a fast leveler you can have no clue on how to play your class and still get world first...
---
Um..hmmm....feral cat and hunter are really close on leveling speed.
---
Sex and the city reference and you use Miranda for the picture? Come on bro.
---
Anyone who is interested in Classic already knows. You don’t throw a bunch of resources into marketing a 15 year old game. The hype is just fine. 
---
I don’t think you realize the purpose of Classic is not to draw in a bunch of new players.
---
it appears you didnt watch it retain much since he basically talks about how to gear your character without needing a bis list and how you wont get everything you need from every tier
---
Tier one was absolutely replaced by the first quests you did. Above that? Ehhhhh.
---
Yep, will be a serious feat to accomplish, but it is theoretically possible.
---
Realistically, a day 8 - 10 rag kill is much much more feasible
---

Well I’m pretty sure the streamers are going to be saying what server they’re on from what I’ve seen. Just worried about Soda. I haven’t kept up with him for a while but last I saw he said he wouldn’t stream for a while and that might imply him not saying his server
---
Literally nobody knows. It would make sense that it would be immediately available.
---
My money is on day 5, day 6 at the latest. The entire classic experience has been perfected at this point, class play is just a numbers game. I would be seriously surprised if it isn’t downed by day 6 at this point.
---
Yes bro 7 day rag would be unreal too cuz of the attune/douses/consumes required for the raid, and specifically the tanks (gear too, for tanks )
---
Oh it's possible but it's a tall order if you sleep... Like at all
---
Haha, sadly I can too.  PvP videos always made me laugh cause of the kind of cheesy format they all followed, but I still watched them occasionally.
---
I like this topic, well done.
---
Surface by Aerochord for that big crit show
---
Just remember: You can't have Thex if she says "No!".
---
I didn't say it was a commercial - I said it was an advertisement and that's exactly what it is... They tell you what you can expect to hype you up - this is the very definition of an advertisement.
---
Dragula?
---
So, no bingo today.
---
This post hurt my brain.
---
Anyone in that streamer has now learned the release date and garnered more info from said stream than any commercial could get them.
---
He saw a far he didn't like ad it hurt his everything. Lol
---
Seriously, the only addon we did t really have was the quest helper crap. We had inferior versions of everything else. Even dbm. Who doesnt remember /rw macros?
---
Haha yeah no doubt!! 
---
I wonder how many HC guilds have a doctor in there like "alright boys who needs a Adderall script before the 26th" LOL
---
We live in an age of streamers whose job it is to play wow and have tons of people willing to give them whatever. For better or worse it will effect classic wow. I personally think it will help keep wow afloat
---
This is not an ad about classic. It's just a "this happens in Warcraft this Month" summary. It's not more of an add for Classic than any YouTube video where Classic is mentioned.
---
I had almost 5k as a fresh dinged warrior because I was a bit of a Stam whore.
---
That's my dream, wrath was my favorite by such a wide margin.
---
if you read the most recent blue post blizz has announced that everyones name will be randomly generated
---
everyone shall be assigned "Thex"+ plus the number in line you created your character
---
so if you made the 69th character on the server you would be named  "Thex69"
---
That's why you find a warlock first. Just need one person to HS to find a replacement and summon both back.
---
Loved it! ❤
---
And this is exactly why we don’t want meme specs in our raids.
---
It is players trying to see it as a questing hub wheb it is designed to be a pvp contested area.
---
My dogs name is Morty also
---
I think the community is doing enough, theres tons of videos being made everyday
---
so lucky for him.
---
Shit - shaman tier 2 (3 pieces of it) was best in slot for resto most of the expansion.
---
does saying his post took no effort imply mine did?
---
Sounds like you got banned not because you posted an opinion others didn't like but for attacking others. Sounds like the Blizzard forums will be a slightly better place now.
---
 [LIVE TO WIN.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OvpzForHyU)
---
I know this album isn't a fan favorite, but this is by far one of my favorite Metallica songs.
---
I think you're confused about what a dog is. This is a cat. 😆
---
I'll double down on this idea in a couple weeks.
---
Mind you, most of the guilds you'll be invited to in-game will be random people inviting everyone that runs by them. 
---
The exception is that if you join a guild group as a 5th PUG and they happen to get along with you, in which case you're likely joining a guild that has difficulty getting a full 5 man group together around your level. 
---
Either of these approaches can easily end you up in a great community, don't get me wrong, but "online dating" does have a major advantage if you're looking to raid.
---
Sorry Morty, no time for pussy! \*face intensifies\* classic has released
---
okay okay, Sum 41's all killer no filler, and does this look infected? Are fucking classics, and also just nostalgic as hell man.
---
I'm only using OSRS to feed my hunger until Classic comes out.
---
they alienated gamers.  G A M E R S
---
Downvotes because you're ignorant and abrasive.
---
Would you mind timestamping for us when Sksrm suggested getting BiS was easy?  Where he talks about expectations?  Where he mentions you have to acquire all this gear?  Where he says you couldn't perform well without getting every bit of this gear?
---
You're actually a potato.
---
Joana has the world record for speed leveling in vanilla which is 4 days and 20 hours. He also claims that he can get his record down to about 4 days come classic. So I can see 5-man premades of speedrunners finding a way to make it to 60 in less than 4 days. 
---
Assuming 8 hours of sleep, 1 hour of self-care every day, meals prepared in advance, 4 days /played to 60 and a 9 day window for the first kill, that's 39 hours left post-60. It's safe to assume that no hardcore player will be sleeping for 8 hours on launch and 5-6 hours would be more realistic. Which opens up 18-27 more hours of play time. So there's up to 66 hours post-60 left.
---
Agreed, it's probably not possible at the 7th day. But is it possible at the 9th day? Are 66 hours enough to get everything ready? I don't know, I'm no expert unfortunately.
---
I’ve watched rank 14 ret videos and they’re... not good. But don’t let me dissuade you from playing a class you want - just realize paladins are worse than others. even at burst damage.
---
Yes exactly but who are the viewers of these videos, people already inside the community
---
Past FEW days? didn't this start just 2 days ago?
---
PvP. My friends and I are all about world PvP. I like to defend my fellow Horde when they're leveling.
---
Sfafd...
---
yeah i also found it odd
---
I played human warlock. Undead rogues were pesky to say the least
---
To be a bit serious, the Devs expect a lot of Retail Tourists so the population should grow and then shrink. It would make the most sense to do a "marketing push" for classic when the tourists start leaving 1-2 months after launch. The goal isn't to max the nimber on the 27-29th but to have a solid playerbase in 6 months!
---
Blizzard will troll us all, my picks:
---
Burning crusade
---
Wrath of the lich king
---
Cataclysm
---
Mists of Pandaria
---
Warlords of Draenor
---
Legion
---
Battle for Azeroth.
---
Then why are you asking?

I guess you'll never know.

As a bilingual Canadian I won't add any accents because it 1) changes the pronunciation and 2) invalidates my identity as the real Thex.
---
"What does that even mean?!"
---
"No one knows what it means! It's provocative... 
---
It GETS the people GOIN"
---
Hmm, maybe not worth the 3 talent points then. I do prefer 2 talent points in imp expose armor in the assassination tree, for some builds.
---
I guess I'll have to do some testing in classic. Really hard to test these on bonkers pservers with everyone running around in BiS/instant maxed profs/unlimited consumes which is totally unrealistic.
---
I dont see how getting an item defaulted to you bc it dropped and you can use it feels better than getting 1000 gold to buy exactly the item you want and need. Had a warlock bitch at me cause I  won staff of the shade when everyone agreed to roll. 
---
I sold the staff for 100 g on the AH. Its great for twinks. This lock bitching was not a twink. He would use the staff for a few levels and replace it, or more likely ninja and sell it. But hes all upset. I actually need gold to buy prebis, just like everyone else. He wants a minor upgrade for a few lvls. Who actually need this, and who is just being greedy?
---
That doesn't make any sense. There could easily be more prestige earned by an accomplishment only few try because it's more difficult.
---
Not many people tried 5 manning Onyxia, but it surely earned a lot of fame if you managed to do it
---
&gt;Can we get some firm handshakes
---
Speed, violence and momentum
---
yeah! thats the one. it was in a snowmobile racing game i played like 20 years ago but i never knew the name
---
You know many Classic players that have any interest in being pushed towards retail?
---
I think you should rename your cat to Thex.
---
"rouge" takes me back maybe more than anything in this thread so far.  From all the meme's / shit people got, we still can't spell it right  lol
---
No fun allowed on your watch? Would you rather the 505th "what should I play" thread?
---
Where is the launcher?
---
I wouldn't say there's hate its just one of the first zones you see alliance and horde questing in the same vicinity so it becomes a pvp clusterfuck.  Also prime hunting location for a bored 45+ to get some cheap kills.
---
Well someone pissed in your cornflakes. I hope you will recover.
---
That could be true. I don't think it would cannibalize sales as they're sold as one product one subscription. However, I think BFA has ingame sales which might see a decrease if BFA players migrate exclusively towards Classic, and on the long term might hurt the retail expansion.
---
However, I see this as an opportunity to increase your user base through classic. An then through improvements in retail push them towards BFA and future expansions
---
Show me on the doll where Thex touched you.
---
Xxxtentacion
---
I did read \*illiban lol
---
Yeah is this thing an officially made thing? I would bet my right arm i can spew out 3 youtuber names who could easily do better xd
---
Ravenous Thexes.  Thexi?  Thexe?
---
Whatever the plural of Thex is.
---
Yeah a paladin is amazing paired with a warrior, mainly because of blessing of freedom.  But at the end of the day just play the class that interests you the most.  You can always roll an alt later if you like.
---
Someone’s getting mad over a video game lol
---
Mocu. First two letters of his first name and first two of his favorite country... which is couch.
---
Tanks need gear, not rep.
---
People are still probably gonna keep track of classic world firsts
---
I kind of want to find the same thing. I only got to level ~48 in vanilla and really like the idea of going into all the raids totally blind and just trying to figure them out on the fly while having fun. 
---
On the other hand, it’ll probably be more frustrating than it sounds. Still, a part of me wants to make a guild to do this when classic comes out.
---
Yeah, It really pisses me off when I see a thread that could be interesting but it just turns out to be another attempt at being funny by forcing the Thex Meme :I
---
Please just let it die.
---
My first character (and first main) was a name from the randomizes and i still think it’s my favorite name.
---
It's a huge clusterfuck on a pvp server.  Which don't ge wrong I'm a big fan of world pvp clusterfucks, but some people just wanna grind there.
---
ok, now I hate fun, because I don't want one overly forced meme spammed everywhere
---
In a perfect world T3 and equivalent gear for each expansion should last you into the first raid tier of the new expansion imo, so much effort put into those pieces.
---
I disagree I've used the same name since playing DND in middle school.  But I won't be going druid this time so it'll be my bank alt because thunderbluff!
---
Also true. I guess the napkin math will have to determine what's faster.
---
Dungeon leveling is looking to be really really efficient which solves the priest and warrior problem
---
Ruin, bloodlust, reckoning, vengeance, etc, is what I was thinking. However if they do go this route, everyone will play on ruin or bloodlust and those will be the mega servers. It would be an easy way for people to choose a server in attempts to find their old communities.
---
Those Classic players you're thinking off are a subsegment.
---
What about those who have never played WoW before, you don't know if they would be interested in being pushed towards retail after a fun classic experience in Classic if Retail does promise a better experience
---
Thex'st'd'ly'nt
---
&gt;False
---
Can you be more specific ? Your response makes it seem like I claimed fire pve spec was required for pve, when (if you read carefully you'd know) all I actually claimed was that PvPing with pve spec is a huge hinderance, which it is.
---
In pve, if you have 5/5 ignite as a fire mage, you're pretty much fine lol and I never would've claimed anything different
---
However in pvp, if you're running no stun, no imp fire blast, no flame throwing, and you beat a deep frost or AP mage? They suck. Period. 
---
Now, addressing your completely off topic claims of 2-3% dps difference, I think that would only be testable on a tournament or test server, where everyone would have the same gear and you could actually compare talents. That said, if youre battling for top dps with  properly spec'd fire mages, I'd wager you would lose by more than 2-3% of the total damage (not damage done to boss, where every dps should be within 3% of one another)  to the 2nd to top mage (ignite mage wouldn't count) in dps with the same gear , I'd definitely chalk that up to skill on mage and not the spec.
---
&gt;A mage with a few Missing talents won’t xhange anything
---
A few missing talents  in pve , you can skate by (wouldn't recommend though, as you will lose dmg and look like a noob) .
---
However, a few missing talents matters  **A LOT** *in PvP*  (as stated, but I'll state it again multiple times in this comment just so it is clear)
---
Why would you be scrambling? If you are worried about your name being taken, come up with something more unique.
---
You shouldn't worry about type of thing just yet. If I were you I'd just play the game, and just join some random guild and have fun. Once you've reached level 60 you should start looking for a guild that suits your needs, but leveling in classic takes time; so there's no rush.
---
First he says -
---
Then we get -
---
Jesus. I didn't do anything near that. I just called people idiots and morons. I also hated on casuals trying to change classic and told blizzard i hated what their company has become.
---
And then finally -
---
Yeah i have a long history of making new posts the day i get unbanned and blizzard would check my history and pretty much refresh the ban again if people flagged it.
---
Why would I want a million randos playing? Why should I care about twitch views? Honest question, it's not like Blizz would shut down all servers if we dip below 200k active players or whatever.
---
Needs more underscores
---
&gt; I still doubt it can achieve the 1500+ DPS or being the highest DPS. Do you have any math/source on this?
---
I don't, just heard it in passing on the theorycrafting discord when someone described a personal exchange between two of the guys on the beta and their calculations.
---
Who doesn't want a bank alt with the true spelling of Asmongold?
---
The only way to skip the Barrens is the undead route, which takes you from Tirisfal -&gt; Silverpine -&gt; Hillsbrad. You’ll have to do some group quests and then Hillsbrad is hell on a PvP server. And even then you’ll probably need to go to the barrens for a bit.
---
Meh I don't mind. Itll fun watching this place freak out if there are issues.
---
Mind you this is second hand and not actual experience, but everything i have read about most healer classes is that you can heal all the way up to mc as a damage spec, as long as you keep a healing set.
---
IMO he'd have better chance at winning against OrangeMan than any dem right now lol
---
Yes this would be smartest, BRD 56-57 57-58 LBRS 58-59 strat 59-60 scholo (not this exactly, just a hypothetical / fabricated route as an example)
---
Def seems most efficient

---
Yeah I did several calculations according to my time, I got this:  
---
The average gold per boss is the average from his drops. If a boss like Landslide has 4 items in his loot table, he will have a 25% per item (it works like that, is not that I'm just saying it), so, if the item A is 1g, the B 2g, C 3g, and D 4g, the avg is 2.5g. Infact, in Landslide, the average gold per kill is 1g 56s 6c.  
---
The time spent from a X point in the main path to the boss, and returning to that X point, is the time that you spend for that boss. For landslide, it takes 2.7min with my gear (160s), so, it is essentially 58s 52c gold per minute.  
---
The average gold/min in this farm tho, per boss, is 89s 98c aprox, and I assume that everything below that, is just not worth the time and efford.  
---
In fact, we can skip Landslide if our runs aren't fast enough. We gotta keep in mind that we don't want farms that can be completed below the 15min mark to be sure that we can spam the dungeon without caring about the instance lockout.  
---
Actualy, in my video, I did it in 15min 9s, If we keep in mind the time you spend by going out with /camp + reset macro and the time spent to start a new run, running to the portal place, we have \~16min per run.  
---
If we don't do Landslide, we will be more efficients in gold/min, but we may see us instance locked for some minutes, I have to test it out anyways because I'm not really sure. But those 2.7min per run can be the difference between getting instance locked or not.  
---
Also, if we take minning, we can spend more time inside farming veins, which have a good gold/min ratio.  
---
If we take a comparation from my video and few runs I've seen from people who is overgeared for it, we got this:  
---
· Undergeared (with Landslide):   
---
Total time per run = 16min // AVG Gold/run = 10g 49s 65c // Gold/min = 65s 60c // Runs per hour = 3.75 // Gold/hour = 39g 36s 17c.  
---
· (Without Landslide):  
---
Total time per run = 13.33min // AVG Gold/run = 8g 93s 59c // Gold/min = 67s 01c // Runs per hour = 4.5 // Gold/hour = 40g 21s 16c.  
---
· Overgeared (with Landslide):  
---
Total time per run = 13.01min // AVG Gold/run = 10g 49s 65c // Gold/min = 80s 63c // Runs per hour = 4.6 // Gold/hour = 48g 38s 32c.  
---
Total time per run = 10.35min // AVG Gold/run = 8g 93s 59c // Gold/min = 86s 33c // Runs per hour = **5.8 (too fast)** // Gold/hour = 51g 80s 24c.  
---
So, here we deduce that if your runs are gonna be slow, you can skip Landslide to be more effective. But if you are fast enough to clear the run on those 13.01min (and I'd say that 13.01min is too fast, maybe you see yourself locked for few minutes), then Landslide is worth it to increase the gold income.  
---
Afterall, we are sticked to the instance lockout handicap, so It's okay if we have to do several bosses in order to win that time and not stay AFK. I guess it depends if we want to rest and take a break from WoW every hour or not anyways :D.
---
I dont know but i could have some thex mex for dinner
---
so Moco?
---
They aren’t a subsegment, they are the target audience. They are the primary consumers of Classic.
---
If you have new players you want to try retail, the path you want them to take is not Classic -&gt; Retail. It’s straight to retail and if they choose to play classic as an included part of their sub, fine.
---
1) prot pallets only issue wasnt a lack of gear, it was the lack of taunt and huge mana issues. There was plenty of fear they could make do with.
---
2) yes there is no tier dets fir a shadow priest but there is plenty of pieces just as good. You just miss out of set bonuses. Tier 2.5 wasnt even that bad for shadow.
---
I never understood the hate for Transmog.
---
"Everyone looks the same" - Because that did not happen pre-Tmog with everyone wearing the same sets after a while.
---
With T-Mog you could at least make your character individual instead of rocking the same T2 that everyone else had.
---
It really pisses me off when I see a comment that could be a The meme but it turns out to be another attempt at killing off the The meme.
---
I get the appeal of stealing a Big Streamers name to prevent them from going on that realm, but in the end, it makes it that much harder to determine which realm he is actually on.
---
Since you said you are going to be making your own guild, when you reserve your name and server can you do an announcement post on this sub so that we all know which server to follow our One True Warchief into?
---
Yes, I am! It's called **reductio ad ridiculum**, which is to take the proposed logic of an argument and exaggerate it to point out the flaw in that logic. 
---
And so my point: there is no logical distinction between expecting a rogue share the contents of a locked chest and a miner to share arcane crystals. OR to expect the rogue to share whatever they get from pickpocketing! Yet no one does that. Where is the difference?
---
On a dungeon run, you might get the opportunity to take advantage of your herbing skill, or your ability to skin, or roll on a professional crafting recipe that I can't use. That's your balance point to me being able to open chests and pickpocket. If there are two rogues, or a blacksmith with a key, then great, let's each roll to see who gets first dibs on that chest. But to hold the double standard of "it's petty to get my fair share of leather but I deserve a chunk of that chest" is to say "I only care about fairness when I might make some significant gold."
---
If we agree it would be petty and selfish to demand the herbalist give everyone 2 dreamfoil or the rogue to open all pickpocketed junkboxes and share the loot, then I see no difference between that and asking the rogue to also share the contents of a chest. You might get annoyed and not want rogues in future groups but that doesn't mean you're not applying a double standard.
---
All that said, I do open chests for groups. (And unlock doors, and disarm traps, and CC with sap / blind, and stealth ahead to mark pats, and stunlock or put crippling poison on runners, and provide high DPS, and use vanish to avoid a wipe, etc). ***But you can't deny that a rogue keeping a chest is consistent with the norm that other gatherers get to keep what they gather in a dungeon.*** Asking a rogue to share when others don't is an exception to that norm.
---
Yeah... that. I'm still half drunk from last night.
---
The game isnt even out, people are having fun, quit being such a wet blanket.
---
People can have fun with meme builds.  Not everyone wants 100% optimal play.  There is room all kinds in Azeroth.  Bring me your moonkin, your shadowpriests, your prot pallies, the wretched refuse of your classes!  I lift my lamp beside the goldshire inn!
---
yes!
---
Priest porfavor!
---
They couldn't use the trick that was used for Twitch Plays Dark Souls either since it required modding the game to pause between input votes.
---
I mean I don't disagree with you on most of your points but patch cycles.  Really?  Do you think major content and balance patches just never happened in Vanilla?  The game changed more between 1.0 and 1.12 than almost any other time in the game, and we've definitely had major content patches in literally every expansion, adding new raid tiers each time.
---
LFD/LFR, CRZ, war/titanforging, paid level boosts, heirloom gear, those things all add up to a terrible MMO experience, but patch cycles?  That's something that has existed since the games inception.
---
I'm super stoked that my shadow priest made it into your video!
---
Sorry if I'm sounding racist, but I don't want any Canadians on my PVPserver! I'd feel kinda bad about killing people that /wave at me

Lmao, I love it.  I remember those catalogs included in the boxes.  Good stuff, but I never actually ordered one.
---
Everybody: Thex

Cranky Redditors: iTs nOt fUnNy tO mE iT cAnT bE hUmOr
---
I already told you what the difference is, simplicity. Rolling once on a chest takes 3 seconds, divvying up the loot from pickpocketing could take a long time.
---
Your personal hype or lack thereof is your own problem. Blizzard is no more responsible for maintaining your level of hype than they are responsible for keeping a game fun despite your burnout.
---
I completely disagree. I'm contesting you saying it's unhealthy, not impossible. 6h of sleep a night for one week isn't actually going to burn anyone's brain. Hell, a lot of people consistently sleep 6h a night. And not being normal doesn't make it bad. It's okay especially because it's an exception. It's something you'll repeat very little.
---
Like anyone cares about "free shirt day" LOL.
---
no
---
Will /camp reset macros not work on classic?
---
Classic is retail. It's just back at the first step.
---
How do you mean? 
---
Granted in this hypothetical, finding a group shouldn’t be a problem, but the potential for wipes are much higher and can’t imagine you’d want to waste precious minutes on run backs when you’re on a pretty intense time crunch.
---
I would much rather have it the way it is. They have put money into the hardware, which is much better than putting money into marketing to players who likely won't be playing when they realize how much of a niche classic is.
---
Yeah they take racism *seriously* unlike you whimsy americans!
---
I think 11k armor is more impressive. A 60 warrior in full BiS gear has 6k armor at best.
---
Perhaps add a second language? Possibly german?
---
What are you talking about? My affliction lock and outlaw rogue play exactly the same.
---
avoidstreamers.com
---
He's kind of showing that he wasn't just "flagged for trolling"
---
It has nothing to do with Blizzard protecting the feelings of those "Snowflakes" as he calls them.
---
It's Blizzard calling him out on being an asshat and responding in an appropriate manner. If you can't remain civil in a public forum then you will no longer be allowed to participate. Simple enough, no?
---
I can’t remember if Molten Core is going to be in with the initial release but if it isn’t prep could all happen then I suppose. Powerlevel, Rep grind, and all that.
---
Looking forward to it.
---
I was the opposite, arrived and so many people to gank!  But eventually I just wanted to finish my fetch/kill quests.
---
I remember he used a lot of engineering items, at a time when people mostly didn’t realize how to use them in PVP.
---
Hopefully not
---
yikes
---
No, it's not that. I don't think that the game will be unplayable as in offline / disconnecting you etc on launch. Just that launch will be messy and it will be hard to level up due to number of players for first few days.
---
If they want to encourage new players to the game it would make more sense to start pushing them towards the game after the launch extravaganza is over.
---
Like I've said before, the difference is as a warrior, what I bring to the dungeon is taking, as a rogue, what you bring to the dungeon is cc, dps, and lockpicking. The reason why you can't compare it to herb/mining is because those things aren't things specific to a certain class. Classes use their class abilities to work together, this has nothing to do with professions.
---
I get sick of it. You have to return multiple times and converge for quests because I here is few zones to level as well as at 30-40. Pvp is fun, but wow pvp isn't exactly interesting to me for long periods of time.
---
Absolutely! I planned on it.
---
Of the Whale - PvE (Carebear)
---
Wow had a ton of "content" in vanilla.. but it's staying force was from the content that the community created. Relationships and epic experiences and struggles. 
---
Dungeons were a team adventure. 
---
To keep classic interesting there needs to be a steady influx of players, there needs to be NO mechanics that promote the "me" play style. Wow classic will be about forming relationships, not random queueing for your next peice of personal loot.
---
Now, we're really scraping the bottom of the barrel with this one.
---
hat the hex
---
You really don't. Even in Vanilla we were running MC with 4-5 people not even level 60 sometimes. 
---
The hard part was always having 40 people online.
---
Can the mods please gas every thex post on this sub?
---
I expect insider servername choices
---
Yea sorry I was mostly just confirming for others that may scroll that you were right.
---
I wouldn't dare level one myself &gt;:)
---
I really can't take people like that serious. The same people that go around insulting others on the internet are the same ones that would squeak and piss off when they had to do it face-to-face.
---
Or they would be overly polite because they don't actually have the balls to say what they want.
---
But It's always easy being an internet tough guy that insults everyone and excuses it with "hypersensitivity".
---
How many shamans does it take to find one who is warchief material?
---
I honestly don't know what this subreddit wants. People on here are so damn bored, they have to invent things to bitch about... They seem to take this subreddit wayyyy to seriously.
---
Tunic of the Owl - PvE
---
Claymore of the Monkey - PvP

banging ur mum
---
There are bound to be classic dedicated Discord servers but as others have said your best bet is to just play the game.
---
Be friendly and social. Say hi to people, when you run into someone question in your area, ask to meet up. Add them as a friend. 
---
Figure out what you want out of the game. Do you want to raid? Do you want to do it hardcore or casual? Do you want to primarily PVP? Are you a completionist? Find friends that share your goals and then join a guild together. You'll have more fun that way.
---
I wasnt negative about it.. I like it a lot. I love "big kids", I am also one. Maybe I didnt word it correctly. 
---

Admittedly this wasn't from Vanilla as I was too young back then to be a part of a true guild.
---
I remember questing in the Outlands where I got a random invite to a guild. I joined. They said to hop into Ventrilo. The were really nice and talkative. The rest is history.
---
I am not angry, I just care for history
---
Thanks, for your input, i will consider this!
---
I was also going rogue/warlock but was considering starting with warlock and rogue as alt.
---
What makes you choose warlock as alt instead?
---
I wouldn't call this an ad, they do this kind of videos every month so people know the important stuff that is going to happen in the game
---
I think it will be done on the second iteration of a classic launch.  
---
Round 1: 2-3 week Rag kill.  
---
Round 2: 1-2 week Rag kill.  
---
Having done shit like this on EQ progression servers, what you’re saying is spot on.  
---
Once the first classic launch is done though and super-fast guilds with 2, or 3 week rag kills make a name for themselves, if blizzard ever “Resets” and does classic launch round 2, people will know where to gravitate to and the numbers hurdle becomes much, much lower.
---
1v1 duels are not that great for Hunter due to the limited space in the dueling area. They are much better in the open world.
---
I thought gnomes didn't get warrior class until cata?
---
yeah that makes sense.  I was a warlock, so dps = dps  I could keep mine  for longer
---
If you think classes on retail play differently then I want what you are smoking. Different visuals and different names but the similarity is incredibly annoying between what should be vastly different classes.
---
If enough people stop visiting because it's all spammed with low effort memes and druid threads, then yeah, you will eventually notice it.
---
Because we never got old.. we just got more levels and more experience!
---
good point
---
Thanks.
---
I'm not entirely sure dual spec is a bad thing, it would need heavy limitations though. For example only availible if one spec has a majority of points (or the end talent) in a healing or tanking tree. As well as only switchable at the talent fella.

Hi, /u/Zenyatta_OW

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ckqshu/which_class_is_stronger_overall_in_pvp_shaman_or/). 
---
fair enough
---
xpearl, titan panel and autoattack on 1
---
that's some authentic classic wow stuff
---
As a mostly Alliance player, Horde and Kali is pretty lame, Org, barrens, and the dust can be very discouraging, I'd stick to what you enjoy, when I went Horde it ended up dampening my enjoyment.
---
Um you can level a warrior to 60 in under 5 days played.  That old record for leveling is going to get smashed I wouldn't be surprised to see under 3 days played to 60
---
What is blizz thinking trying to advertise both games.  Its almost like they want to make money off 2 groups of people (or extra money off classic players coming back).  Obviously we should hate them for this.
---
What are your Classic goals (besides having a shaman named Thex)? Did you play Vanilla? If so what was your Vanilla experience like?
---
Okay in broad terms you have 3 different types of audience:
---
1. People who have played WoW before and are coming back for classic
---
2. People who are actively playing retail and would shift to Classic
---
3. People who haven't played WoW before
---
For 1. you're right they are the target audience and they don't need advertising resources as they will play Classic Regardless
---
But without spending in marketing you're writing off 3. completely. Now you say okay but if they wanted that why not just try to take them to retail directly. You do that through advertising, which I would argue that so far it hasn't been effective in bringing in new players. So why not utilize Classic as hook? And in order to reach #3 you need a more aggressive exposure campaign
---
will you randomly wait near some tree in a dark place and ask players to buy your potions?
---
I'm an OSRS immigrant. I'll be fine.
---
True, but it's doable.
---
Teach me your ways, cuz I got no idea what you mean

Worn Dagger US PVP
---
First rag will still be a big deal, then speedruns will be the real measuring
---
the games systems were long term investments to cut down on content development. pet battles, garrisons/followers/missions, gated dailies, catchup gear... all designed to stretch player engagement at a reduced cost.
---
Thanks for this!

This boss destroyed my guild, literally. After four weeks of attempts Iniquity of Kalecgos broke apart. Some of us got absorbed by another guild called Meet in Kargath. 
---
Two weeks after the absorption the guild managed to down him. Here's my screenshot immediately after beating C'Thun with UI shown and all:

---
They literally just  Came out and admitted they went to far with recent class changes and are going to fix it lmao
---
heard one of the streamers after the blizz meeting mention one would be named mankrik's wife. he didn't seem to joking. Good chance we end up with a bunch of "meme" server names
---
Recklessness too, yea?  Reduces armor for all the phys classes.
---
Agony is a dot, and I dont believe it is typically applied in raids since the value is minimal iirc.
---
I've played both horde and alliance, but i know where my heart is. IMO, follow your heart. You've gotta look at these characters for a looong time, and roam through their zones on the way to 60. you might as well make it an experience that'll make you feel something, y'know?
---
very cool
---
This might be pedantic but anyone who auctions my name will get reported by me - not even out of spite, but because it's an abuse of the game for profit.
---
People just didn't really DO organized 5 man leveling groups back in the day. I never heard of any. The leveling groups practicing on beta have found out that the private servers were missing the group exp bonus that dungeons award. Whether or not that makes it to LIVE, I'm not sure.
---
On the private servers if you're 2 Manning and kill something exp is split 50/50. On the beta (not sure of the exact numbers) the split is more like 70/70. Not really sure exactly how it scales to 5 man groups, but it's apparently really promising.
---
An 8 day rag kill has already been done on pservers. I have no doubt that there are 60+ likeminded nolifers out there willing to race for a 7 day kill.
---
I think the main difference between mage, warlock, and hunter is your preferred playstyle. They all have good quality of life features and gold farming ability. If you're unsure about whether you'd enjoy the mage or warlock playstyle, you might like reading some guides to the class online. It's going to have to be a pretty personal decision involving things that other people can't necessarily convey to you directly, I think.
---
Here's an example. You're asking a difficult question, so I can't give a tl;dr. I was personally having a difficult time deciding between mage and warlock for the past couple months, and here's how I came to my decision. 
---
First, my priority. The final endgame of WoW Classic is PVP. There's a threshold of ability and gearing beyond which additional optimizations don't particularly matter, except for speedrunning endgame raids. My logic might be different here if I were considering a tank or healer, who have more opportunities for hero moments in PVE raiding, but for a DPS class I am inclined to give PVP concerns priority.
---
So now, I have to decide whether I would prefer to play a mage or warlock for PVP. I think both are extremely solid options, so at this point I have to start considering small factors like synergy with racial bonuses. The choice between gnome and the horde races would be legitimately hard, but I was already inclined to make this a Horde character, and the Horde races are probably slightly better for PVP. Not having to deal with WOTF as a gnomish warlock is also nice, if I were to go gnome it would be with a mage instead. 
---
As Horde, WOTF gives me a better matchup against Alliance warlocks, orc stun resistance gives me a better matchup against Alliance rogues, and troll berserking potentially lets me do obnoxious things with Pyroblast. That's fun, but niche and gimmicky, so I'm choosing between an orc warlock, an undead warlock, and an undead mage.
---
As a warlock, both warlocks and rogues are threatening, but rogues are more threatening, so I prefer orc stun resist to WOTF. I'm choosing to minimize the badness of the worst case scenario, rather than maximize the goodness of the best case scenario, but that's a personal preference. So at last I'm choosing between an orc warlock and an undead mage for PVP.
---
I really like hero moments, and don't want to have to run away if I'm outnumbered or facing a bad matchup that's still doable, so I want to make whatever choice will let me make the best of a bad scenario.
---
That's going to require crowd control. Frost is countered by anyone with a free action potion, druids, and paladins with (Freedom). Fear is countered by Warriors and other Warlocks, but Seduce is almost unanswerable. Curse of exhaustion is also an option, but only if I'm willing to spec deep into Affliction. Both classes are equally frustrated by dispels. Overall, I have more confidence in Warlock crowd control than in Mage crowd control, although polymorph is probably the strongest individual CC in the game.
---
If you want a tl;dr, it's this: when you're having trouble deciding between two classes, know your values and priorities, and drill deeper into specifics. Think about faction choice, racial synergies, and individual scenarios where class choice will change how things play out. You can also think about different scenarios for gearing, gold farming, ability to retreat, or a million other qualities, where they are relevant.
---
same here, I was hoping we might have had some info by now, there's a lot of communities that would like to coordinate and I'd rather not have to try to juggle that along with name reservations all at the same time
---
&gt; . It was that overly defensive attitude from the playerbase there that led to the WoW's undermining.
---
No. It was the people suffering from "social anxiety" that couldn't find groups to do dungeons/raids/pvp/quests/etc. 
---
Catering to the single player folks killed what wow was.
---
Forgot about that! Thanks for the reminder.
---
Yes, the armor value of bosses is in the 10's of thousands or something from memory, recklessness is barley anything (&lt;500 from memory), not an amazing damage increase, unless you're really crunching the speed run!
---
8 days has been done. 7 is highly unlikely, but very possible with enough dedicated jobless tryhards.
---
I think Classic has/had the potential to be a huge success, but it all relied on #nochanges. We'll see what happens I guess.
---
Priests can mind control horde off a flight path in felwood. They die and Res a mile away and eventually get back to corpse to then be in a terrible position and have a long way back to felwood. Give a Google for the exact details or a video guide but it's truly evil....and a big reason I'll be priest &gt;:]
---
Lol who wants to play bfa
---
wow this sub went full retard, guess its time to abandon till the release.
---
I do very much appreciate higher quality pics! You can message them to me on Reddit :)
---
There's definitely rough experiences to be had. On BfA I got baited into this absolute nightmare of a Mythic+ run that lasted like 2+ hours of constant wiping. After finally completing it at nearly 2 in the morning the night before an 8 AM class the dude in my guild swindles me out of an item by lying about the worth of something and then patronizing me. /gquit and went to bed sour at the loss of sleep more than anything. Sometimes they're just fuckers

STV Best Zone EVER = Must be playing a rogue or druid. (That's me!)
---
By bilingual do you mean french and english, or just all the silly accents that Canadiens use like aboot?

So you just wanna talk about what's wrong and not talk about any solutions? Interesting..
---
I would play a Mankrik’s Wife server if I could even find it.
---
It's not so much our hate for STV, but that STV hates us. But we love it, so it's a love-hate relationship.
---
Holy shit my best friend's brother played a NE Hunter named Legolas. I completely forgot until reading this.
---
&gt; Only cons is both of you wear plates.
---
Even with this, warrior gets priority, and paladin takes healing gear, (offsets dps gear, even as ret your damage is minimal, you're supporting the warrior's damage primarily)
---
This is what I "semi-feared".  I was hoping more people would love moving "back to Classic", just to show Bliz that it is a worthwhile effort (not just sub money) for a product "style", and lead to further re-development of possibly BC and WotLK.
---
Extra "hype" from retail crowd, complementing Bliz on the product can never hurt :)
---
Wasn’t the xp split 50/50 in a 2 man grouping in actual Vanilla though? I feel like that’s how I remember it, but it’s also been 15 years so I can’t say so confidently.
---
again, we're talking early-ish days of vanilla wow when people didnt know any better and tanks wore full dark iron for MC etc
---
and yeah i mean in general not tanks anyway
---
Geez... you asked a question and I answered...
---
This is happening right now on a pserver (minus actually running MC). They have 15ish players maximizing leveling routes for every class for pure efficiency. Joana's old record of 4 days+ is old news. This pserver group already has mages and warlocks at sub 3 day 16 hour level 60 times. Particular effort is being paid into optimizing healer and warrior leveling.
---
Ooo bad ass
---
What's that?
---
Seems like people went retarded waiting for classic, time to abandon ship till release.
---
500,000 players x $14/mo (12 months year) = $84,000,000
---
x2 years = $168,0000,000
---
Cost of development being a fraction that of BFA, since the systems are being reverse engineered and most of the content already created.
---
Sure BFA makes $400-500m in its lifetime but what was its development/marketing costs?  
---
Classic is 'free' money, and if its the driver behind consistent revenue for Blizzard you better believe the board of directors will encourage more investment in legacy properties. Consistent revenue stream is important for a stock in terms of dividends.
---
Someone can reply to this post when Rag is still standing at the end of week two because it's not happening.
---
Sort of, although that changed every patch, and will be different in 1.13 compared to 1.12. It would save a lot of gold for tanks/healers, and allow them to actually farm. It would also encourage more people to try tanking and healing which imo is a good thing. Linked together FPs was a QoL change, this be something else imo.
---
It does marginally alter class fantasy. Can't speak for everyone but I used to just rotate between specs for a few months at a time or play another character. Not great design imo to encourage people to just not play that character.
---
All the rankers will be going hard with honour farming as soon as phase 2 starts. People that are serious about the game won’t wait until phase 3 to start ranking.
---
Isn't the record for 1-60 like 4 days played?
---
Your post just made no sense. You were comparing a maintenance year to a game release year... You were comparing 5 years of development time to one year of patches while working on an expansion...
---
When people got sick of trying to figure out what point you were trying to make with your false comparison, you came here to complain about players being "defensive"...
---
 Alright that totally makes sense. Thank you very much for your input! Much appreciated
---
And mods ain't doing shit about it either...
---
Lol it happens man. I’m looking forward to classic. BFA has been the worst expansion next to WoD imo.
---
Thank you for clarifying! :O
---
Risking serious health consequences though.
---
If US-Thex is a server u best believe it’s gon be litty
---
FUGGIT
---
6. Download a completely different game once Classic has been released
---
Yeah just horde all your dkp for BRE and you're golden. Everyone will love you as your DPS skyrockets. ^^^^^^^/s
---
$100-150m development / marketing costs for BFA is entirely plausible. Making the 'profit' for BFA closer to $200-300m, which I believe Classic could generate in terms of net-new / sustained subscriptions over that time.
---
Joana (or spelt similarly) was a well known speed leveller and has a really good 1-60 levelling guide.
---
He/her was a female Troll Hunter.
---
Drakedawg- Undead Warlock PVP master
---
Your best option with a warrior, is have them facetank thing, a warrior will roll over mobs super fast/easy. Rage is primarily generated by being hit. SW:P is  garbage damage, even while wanding, best off letting the warrior go on a rampage, and heal them. In combat, just wand, and let your mp5 take over (stack spirit!).
---
Yo this is cool
---
Pservers have proven it. Bears are flat out superior in the pre-bis stages. Warriors pull ahead once they're BWL geared, but guilds have already chosen a main tank by that point. Your plan is a good one.
---
I don't play much Alliance, South Park lied to me about human hunters.
---
It's one of the earlier contested, *truly* neutral zones, that also happens to have great leveling quests, decent quest rewards, and is absolutely massive.
---
As such, people can be frustrated with PvP, long travel time and to some degree even the enemies in the zone (Some troll areas are pretty rough, and those rogue-like panthers can be a motherfucker at just the wrong times).

Multi boxing- not against ToS
---
Playing someone else’s account is.
---
Unless they loophole the ToS and the accounts aren’t owned by said person, but by a company for use by their employees. That being said as long as you work for said company the account can be used by said employees; register the accounts under Method Gaming LLC as the first name on the column, last names no longer required. Legally you can then play 3 accounts while multi-boxing. Now let’s say method gaming decides to gift the accounts to the employees as a bonus giving them username and passwords and full control over the account. Then what can you do? As long as said company is paying for x amount of game licenses for x amount of players blizzard won’t care.

I started my job in December and have taken 2 days off and 1 sick day since and felt like I’m due. This guy blows me out of the water.

The warriors should probably be spamming dungeons more or less the whole way to 60. Warlocks, mages, hunters, and druids can easily get 60 in 4 days /played with good route prep. 6 hours of rest a night and you're at 5 days RL, so they actually some time to spare. After that some go get Hydra rep, some start farming for consumables or crafting gear. Pallys/shammys, rogues, and priests should mostly be duo-leveling, with a few of the healing classes grouping with the warriors to dungeon spam.
---
The biggest hurdle is getting enough of the slow leveling classes to 60 in 5 RL days. If it takes any longer than 5.5 days RL, it will be nearly impossible to get everything else done and get a clear in. I also wouldn't be surprised to see some interesting comps as well - less dps warriors and rogues than usual. More druid healers than usual, maybe even a druid tank.
---
Blood sail admiral does not exist in vanilla/classic. Most titles are added in later expansions.
---
FOMO, completionism, habit, depression, boredom, etc.
---
Ah, I remember my first Blizzard launch.
---
My boss doesn't think so. Least productive day by far.
---
Yes, no idea why it attracted so many swedes.
---
Shooters are not "much harder". They are very different and I would argue that a linear game designed to be played with an Xbox controller is inherently less mechanically intensive than an open-world game designed to be played with a full keyboard and mouse. Unless that shooter is ArmA II, it's a lot more complicated to do anything as a Twitch chat in the MMO.
---
... The launch extravaganza is not gonna include disconnects etc, yet you still think its gonna make more sense to ... what?  
---
The launch event is extremely hyped (from the community) and in a social game like this, it is precisely whats gonna make ppl join and stay subbed.
---
Exactly. Threat was a huge issue back in the day. On a threat per point of DPS basis, Arms is superior. I don't remember exactly why, but fury generated more threat while doing the same DPS.
---
Sure but you could get the hat and outfit. Plus people used to call me Admiral

I'm surprised nobody posted this already... On Reddit, I found posts called "Looking For Group Monday" that has guild recruitment stuff in it. [This Site](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cj8xym/looking_for_group_monday_july_29_2019/) links to  [a spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w34jsA7g253bazOSbHSWpfCYCzJQZ2w1AyT_LtVhrcQ/edit#gid=1957960049). Click on the Form Responses tab at the bottom. I just looked for a guild that way...
---
Nice. Take this +1 up yar ass

Begone non believer!

They will not. The work around is time be grouped with someone and then drop group. Not really convenient
---
&gt;You hang out in the sun all day tossing a ball around or you can sit at you computer and ~~do something that matters~~ hang out in the sun all day tossing a ball around in a videogame.

The idea isn't to prevent them from going on that realm, but to get free stuff mailed to you
---
YEAH! All these damn people laughing at things that I don’t think are funny are such morons. This IS bullshit... people making jokes. Get a fucking life Plebes!!!
---
No thanks. respec or you are not getting invited to raid night.  rather run with 38 players that want to raid than 40 players where 2 people don't even give enough care to put talent points in the correct spot.  best of luck tho...
---
I can’t see, is this Thex?
---
My first guild memory is actually after h st joining someone offering free bags i thought i hit the lottery.
---
Yep, we ended up having to kick ~5 of our core raiders due to C'thun in particular. They had raided with us since MC, and it sucked to do it, but they flat out weren't learning. When the same 5 are wiping the raid via lightning over and over, drastic measures have to be taken.
---
Some just couldn't handle the leap from "don't stand in fire" to real mechanics.
---
You're actually at the mercy of blizzard looking at the accounts leveling the fastest, seeing that they're cycling ips from different cities, and then someone bringing up their policy on account sharing
---
Something is always hard when Thex is involved
---
I’m not arguing that your points aren’t correct that these WOULD fix those problems.  Much like adding tier set tokens with spec specific sets instead of just armor drops would fix the problem of “tier sets are only for one spec”.  The issue isn’t that I don’t think that it will fix these problems.
---
The issue is that it doesn’t NEED to fix these problems, it SHOULDNT fix these problems, and blizzard isn’t GOING to fix these problems.  Because these problems are what made vanilla, vanilla, and changing this completely defeats the original purpose of making classic in the first place.
---
i played (and ranked) on druid 4 or 5 times on different private servers and currently im on a instant 60 pvp server getting back into feral pvp and flagcarrying. lets say i know pretty much what im doing.
---
i have played paladin and shaman the last two private server runs i did just to get some new perspectives on other classes. paladin was really fun to play, especially the holy/reck (26/25/0) specc in pvp. 
---
playing shaman just felt wrong and i feel disgusting to ever even have joined horde forces once
---
I would not be surprised. I've seen rare names for OSRS go for $100 or more. I realize that RuneScape is a significantly different economy than WoW, but I'd argue that people would take WoW even more seriously.
---
Stormwind main theme next pls!
---
I still wear them for gardening stuff around my house! Got both - Alli and Horde version. Love them.
---
Any plans for a Horde PvE guild?
---
Ha this guy doesn’t know what Thex is
---
Planning on UD priest shadow/holy. LF a warrior to duo with for total domination.
---
fvck him he can buy free action pots!
---
jk, idk. maybe i will really roll paladin as an altand main druid
---
Priest is fine lol, just avoid using the spell.
---
WoW Vanilla is launching and we get LoTR memes? I guess its really 2004.
---
As someone who is mostly getting into this for nostalgia and not min maxing like crazy, I'm a little discouraged how meta warriors are. I just want to MT MC and BWL like I did in the glory days. Tanks seem to be in such high demand right now, I was hoping they would be in classic too.
---
I am going to make a tank druid for my first alt.  That way I can look at some boss knees instead of stand back and dot.  Shaman is probably my 3rd or 4th pick, since they are so good at pvp burst damage and NS can be defensive or offensive.
---

Nice data. Thanks for sharing. Imo, there is no "too fast"because you have to go vendor blues and find your way back.
---
It's so crazy the scale of this type of game and the development that goes in. 
---
Hard to fathom for someone that has to deal with a barely-functioning intranet application.
---
shitty meme quickly killing all decent content this sub used to have.
---
Playing on the private servers has been pretty helpful for me making this decision. It's probably a better way to regain familiarity than just reading will be.
---
I'm happy I could help.
---
I dont think thats true, any reputation grind mounts and PvP gear will always garner praise from your server.
---
Över min döda kropp, danskjävel!
---
They want fresh meat on the menu
---
If it’s nothing but hardcore players it’ll be like pservers
---
Like a billion people use Facebook still. Reddit just tries really hard to play it down.
---
That's a really good point. Did people actually successfully do this in Vanilla?
---
Lagforge.
---
Druid gives you a LOT more skill ceiling to play with for sure, especially while ranking. (Even during AV, stealth capping with a rogue is a blast)
---
Since you said you know what you are doing, I would recommend druid, because it will allow you to stand out really well.
---
But if you are looking for a change of pace, you can do the paladin!
---
Not sure how it all works, but wouldn’t this be moot if you’re using a vpn?
---
Looking forward to drinking that Rumsey Rum Black Label again! *glug, glug, glug*
---
Wow it’s almost like they said that in an interview!!!
---
Warlock mage and SP are probably the best options. Warlock with dots and drains on all of them, mage with control and aoe damage and SP with high natural tankiness and huge dot damage.
---
Until you open the AH
---
Couc?
---
Brooo I'm scared for classic I heard that in the beta some of the resist/miss values are higher than Pservers (which is scary cuz our tank missed probably 1/3 of his attacks/taunts on the aboms on KT last night lol)
---
We do have plans for that. 
---
Right now I’m waiting to hear back from someone.
---
Horde PVE is the only guild we don’t have right now due to most members wanted Horde PVP first
---
Hunters can solo DMT in Vanilla. Its actually nerfed to make it harder on private servers. But you cpuld always solo it in Vanilla.
---
Your title makes no sense
---
Ok, I thought the xp bonuses were strictly for dungeons, so that’s good to know.
---
Do you really think the launch will be 100% stable? BfA's launch saw several high-pop realms damn nearly *unplayable* for like a week as they were constantly going down or lagging to high hell.
---
How do you know he was syrian?
---
I played on shattered hand EU as Ally and I remember the guildname aswell :D I played as mage in Mithrid

If you've already got the friends there and you already know what the population is why would you even bother with the auction house?

It's something they do every month to just say what things happen that month in WoW. In this case, Classic was brought up because it's a WoW thing (included as part of every WoW player's sub) that happens this month, among other events.
---
Tror det var mitt töntiga sätt att skriva "håll käften" (käften - käft - keft)
---
the majority
---
Then the retail tourists get addicted 
---
Ya hate to see it.
---
This sub had decent content?
---
the paladin in tbc is vastly different from paladins in classic.  starting them in tbc is like saying you played demon hunter from legion till now and were thinking of making a warlock in classic...
---
Okay? 
---
Doesn't mean it's not a generally inaccurate and grumpy claim.
---
It's the internet, I could have just downvoted a d or used ugly words.. but I didn't..
---
So I don't see the issue.
---
Some sort of seasons for Classic and maintenance mode like Diablo 3 is likely.
---
They won’t develop new content for it, as they’ve already stated retail and Classic share the same subscription so that would just cause issues in that someone like me, who only dabbles in Classic, wouldn’t want to subsidize its development when that money could go towards Retail.
---
In my head I imagine it will be something like this: If they have any plans for the future with regards to Legacy content it’s likely they would add a separate subscription service for all legacy expansions and slowly roll out TBC, WOTLK etc. servers over the years, perhaps with optional seasonal content for each cycle, perhaps with the option to copy your character over from each legacy server to the next or start fresh.
---
This all depends on how successful Classic is though, if it fizzles out or stagnates then it will likely be kept around in maintenance mode until it’s pretty much dead.

Not within a month or 2, but definitely by phase 3.
---
The top guilds I've talked to will do the following: They will dungeon farm with melee cleave or spell cleave groups and rush to 60 asap. Estimated times (based on beta xp values) to 60 are around 3-3.5 days /played (so a lot faster than Joana). At 60, some will go rep grind, while others will continue to carry lower level classes to 60, in order to get a full roster asap. There will also be dedicated groups to gear the tanks. Also, there are players in the guild whose main job is to provide early wands, or level warlocks for summons. I'm not aware of any account sharing as most players are dedicated enough to play 18-20 hours a day for a week, but I'm sure account sharing will happen as well. 
---
Even if we have server issues, those guilds are confident that they'll reach 60 in at most 4 days /played, which leaves them with more than enough time to clear MC in week 1. I believe it's possible, but it requires a huge amount of coordination.
---
Take my upvote
---
Despite sharding, high-pop realms were still *hell* at BfA's launch. Queues, massive downtime, laggy conditions...

5 boxing Strat Live could be very profitable but your gonna see alot more variance than the consistency of DMT.
---
I have seen 10 orbs, tome of conjure food, two pristine black diamonds, and flask recipe in a single run. I have also seen 0 orbs.
---
No braining DMT sounds easier and more consistent
---
Of all people that create a character?  40%
---
Of all people who get past 40?  80%
---
Aka not holding anyone accountable. 👍
---
In the game.
---
You are the real Thex we need.
---
I think that’s a more fair way of looking at it
---
Always love a good SrGrafo format meme
---
Take on and defeat? Or take on and escape/survive? In the latter case I'd say resto druid:)
---
Yikes.
---
I haven't played since 2006-ish and I'm waiting till a day or two before classic servers launch to resubscribe to max out the free month of service
---
I believe so yes 
---
Warr, paladin, rogue, priest, warlock, mage
---
That's 6, max is 6 in vanilla per race.
---
Most classes would use their T3 upto ~66-70 but you get kind of shafted as Warrior because you're unlikely to want to be leveling as protection. 
---
Secondary stats moving from things like block value to crit meant you replaced it really early with random unmatched greens so you could play arms/fury.
---
They can make room for it, just remove destiny.
---
Honestly I think people who actually played vanilla will still be fine but anyone who came in after might be in for a very big shock. I played vanilla for a year until I hit 60. Mind you, i was 8 but still😂
---
WELL WHY DONT YOU TRY TO COME UP WITH A BETTER ANSWER
---
Why not Area 52..
---
You don't have to have every person in the raid at all 60. The server first MC clear on private server that rhymes with PorthDale had people that weren't 60 or entirely pre bis.  I think there will be a week one MC clear.
---
Yeah they kill jokes pretty damn fast here
---
I once considered doorknob as a name
---
It's the first big "in-house" meme we've seen. Wanted to let you all run with it and see what happened.
---
Mistakes were made.
---
We shall see I guess
---
True spelling is Assholebald
---
Same we Stormreaver US, Was kinda the unofficial Australian server till Frostmourne opened up.
---
Back in Vanilla I didn’t have the patience to hit 60. Was also a kid. Coming back to a Pserver was still a shock at how slow the higher levels were. Still fun if the goal isn’t to Zerg. But slow
---
Yeah, that's true. 
---
But remember, private servers have much smaller communities than classic already has.
---
Getting 40 lvl 60s by day 5/6 may not be the issue, it might be getting dousers or your tanks properly geared in time, or better yet, making sure everyone knows what they are doing (to the extent that they won't cause wipes -- basically just competent humans mc is so easy)
---
Mage&gt;warlock icebock carries in 1vx
---
Exactly!! Thats why i love it to.
---
Nantucket, MA is sometimes referred to as ACK by locals, since that's their airport's IATA code.
---
Cocklover from ACK?
---
Do you have a link to an official post saying company owned accounts can be shared?
---
Yeah I remember late vanilla some group 3 or 5 manned it, something like that. It was pretty unheard of at the time so it was really cool. I have no clue what the video was called though, might not even exist anywhere.
---
But after that more people started doing stuff like that because it was actually new
---
Horde love please
---
I imagine it will be pretty low, but that's to be expected. I remember back in WoTLK they released a statistic that something like 70% of new accounts never made it past level 10, so I would expect it to be similar especially with all the retail tourists who probably aren't planning to play long term.
---
Orc warlock is bis 1v1
---
Dont know if I understood you correctly, what do you mean with "armor pieces tied to their class they aren't competing with".
---
A paladin has massive competition for their bis, either by almost all the healing classes or all dps casters, since almost none of the plate gear has healing.
---
There is only 2 plate items on their list with no competition besides t3 set in all vanilla.
---
I feel bad for OG Thex. What’re the chances he gets it own name now!? Poor nameless Thex. Guess that’s what happens when you cross over into memedom.
---
Specs don't work like that in Classic they are not stand alone, there are tier tokens though to stop gear wastage. You can already change spec and have to to play the game.
---
Classic was an ever changing game and imo it will change in the long run, there was a lot of Classic we never saw due to TBC. Static gaming was very far from what made vanilla, vanilla. Personally hoping for some minor tweaks in post-nax patches such as some method of mana regen for pally tanks and boomkins so they suck a little less. Don't really want TBC
---
What are their thoughts on xp fall-off while carrying those lower level guildies through dungeons with 60s? 
---
As far as gearing tanks, how to they plan to account for drop rates with dungeon gear? And crafted gear, is going to require someone with that skill in or out of guild. Given the fact that we are only 5 days in what is the likelihood anyone has the required skill?
---
I guess it just seems to me like there are too many uncontrollable variables once you ding 60 to guarantee any specific timelines.
---
Depends on what you call meme spec, but managed to do 12/15 with a 2 feral, 1 shadowpriest, 3 elem sham, 1 enhanc, 2 hunters (meme class in naxx). So 1 max is not required, depending on what you want to do
---
If you want to squeeze your bumhole while you raid, you're free to do so.
---
About 10 % of characters who reached above lvl10 made it to 60 on a pserver recently, and about 50% of characters that made it 40 also made it to 60 on that server. Obviously it's impossible to tell how many are alts how many are banned(bots) etc. but it's the best data available.
---
It'll be pretty lame if the guy doesn't get his name because of this shitty meme.
---
Mages are really good cause you won't be buying water or food and can spend 2 minutes starting out conjuring stuff.  You get good portals and pretty nice escapes with blink and frost nova.   
---
Warlock would be a close second with soul stone, health stones, and a void walker tank.  You also have pretty good CC with fear, but that is your only real escape move.  Otherwise, you just have to kill it by draining their life and dots.
---
Honestly I was pretty stupid / arrogant / naive back in those days. I think there was some internal strife going on before I joined, heard about fall out from some officers and another well geared tank leaving, hence why I was fast tracked. 
---
Me joining and on the same day / in very rapid succession getting so geared, more geared than some long time members, and then me running my mouth bubbled over by the time Razorgore / Vaelstrasz started fucking us up bad. Me running my mouth again and going from what I thought was "Farm Status" guild to slow, incremental progression in BWL, and again me running my mouth was like a spark in a tinder box. 
---
I screenshot whispers from the GM, which were not a good look from him having a temper tantrum at me, were shared with MT buddy - which then leaked out to the whole guild. The narrative went from "this arrogant, but skilled / geared, new tank is a fuckin child" to "the GM is having a meltdown and doesn't know how to manage his people".
---
My bad? Sorry if you don't? Git gud? Yeah... That didn't help. The rest is history haha!
---
Honestly I think the biggest win of my vanilla was hitting 40 so I could get a mount. I dont remember hitting 60 but you can be damn sure i can remember killing that crocolisk in STV and then immediately dropping what i was doing and legging it back to elwynn and just running around on my horse slightly faster than I could on foot for about an hour. I think anyone who gets to that point has the perseverance to hit 60
---
Fucking mods need to ban these spamming idiots.
---
I’m terrified to say what my troll shamans name was. I got lucky with a 2 letter name on a small server back in Vanilla... And I’ll never say it on Reddit after this meme.
---
Damn I can’t wait!
---
I am sorry but “Omar Gonzales - PVP- has to happen !
---
Wat. Twitch is normie as fuck nowadays

I think 40% is super high.  This game has no modern comforts and casuals are going to hate it.  I know everyone says vanilla was full of casuals but that was in the early 2000s.  Look at the games people play these days the people.playing those games aren't hitting 60.
---
Yeah but how many of those "new accounts" are strictly gold sellers?
---
Hell YeAh! Such fond memories
---
Tyrannosaurus hex
---
Yea I played this game as a kid and loved it. Didn't you get extra points and shit for running over bunnies and squirrels? 😂
---
I love your attitude towards this whole situation! You are playing along nicely without trying to capitalize on it. 
---
My question is: what is your favorite Thex-meme so far? 
---
Side note: My highest upvoted comment on reddit is a Thex-joke I made yesterday. So, thank you :)
---
There were many HWLs on my server who really weren't that good, they just account shared for the gear. Better than average, even most, sure. But still not that great.
---
Meanwhile Vurtne became famous by pvping in blues. Most of the best PvPers didn't actually hit R14, just 11.
---
Because again, it's time, not skill. It earns a golfclap but since it's not truly impressive, it's readily dismissed. The Vurtne wrecking people in blues is a lot more impressive than some noob with a lot of time who never really gets good but has gear carry them
---
I think most people that will be playing have an idea of what they are getting themselves into.  I don't think there will be a ton of wow virgins
---
Holy shit! I just realized that the Barrens chat is basically going to be a giant political argument! Oh no!
---
As a MT&amp; war class leader  I like fury wars more than any other class in my raid, they all get full prot sets and are expected to tank any new members through attunement if they want to keep a raid spot.
---
Yikes. This is the type of gaming autism I try to avoid. Classic is fucked.
---
To be honest, I don't really know the answer to most of those questions. One guild said they'll probably just play a roster full of mages and hunters + absolutely necessary classes. 
---
As for the drop rates, I believe if they get enough groups farming, the drop rates will even out, but I'm not sure how exactly their plans look. 
---
For our guild the hassle was too big. We're going for a week 2 kill, which isn't nearly as impressive, because everybody is expecting that, I guess.
---
If they were trying to draw new people, they’d advertise way more than this.
---
Imagine if you're someone who said goodbye to WoW COMPLETELY and thus missed out on the Classic announcement and THEN you see such an ad and think yourself "Woah. It's only about 4 weeks away. Imagine how much it would suck to wait for that like a 3/4 year."
---
300/300 Artisan Memer right here! I suspect even a +5 meme-enchant too?
---
On PServers there are soooo many warriors in their twenties. I think once they get to WPVP they duck out 😂😂
---

---
Loved this video. This and the creepy doll video.
---
Is there a similar guide for warlocks?? :O This is great!
---
If they make the world seamless, I’m definitely going to be interested.
---
Ye, It would be best if you are able to make flasks while levelling. 
---
The reason I’m levelling skinning are do I’m able to gather the mats for my pre BIS leather gear (and extra money)...After that - it’s not so useful for me. 
---
That’s the reason why I levelled herbalism. I would unlearn skinning and take alchemy, which will be useful for the remains duration of vanilla :)
---
Warlock: Mana exists.
---
Shadow Priest: ITS FREE REAL ESTATE!
---
Are you Thex?
---
I’m up for WoW 2.
---
It always kind of bothered me in a funny way. Here is the high fantasy world filled with beasts, undeads, demons, etc. magic is litterally flowing around us and yet the most popular choice in class - a warrior, and in races - a human.
---
Hu, dunno. Maybe it's the way I played. Never was in a raid guild and so I always farmed full pre raid geae before going aq20, ZG, MC and Onyxia
---
omg......
---
I played alliance in vanilla wow. Went horde after, planning to stick with horde as i enjoy the animations more and look and feel of the characters. I would go with what you like, in the long run it really doesn't matter to much which race or side just enjoy it.
---
It's a Tide ad.
---
Big oof! Seems like Classic is great for Splits.
---
In all honesty, I didn’t expect you to and that’s kind of the point I guess. There isn’t a whole lot you can do to game plan around those things. The xp, sure, because that can be controlled.
---
But drop rates on gear, crafted gear (and the mats that are required) those are questions mark in my mind. Again, it’s been 15 years and I’m just thinking out loud and haven’t done any research on the mats required, but I’d imagine some of the mats for the crafted gear are on CD, so you may have to find multiple people to craft your reagents  and I think finding one person skilled up enough in five days is gonna be tough, multiple seems like it would be impossible. 
---
Your guild may not be the realm first in week 2, but I’m guessing that title isn’t going to be given out until week 2 either.
---
I was thinking the same, except switching to ele resto at 60. I really want to PVP as ele resto it just looks like a blast.
---
One of my first hunter pets
---
I guess we play a different game if you dont think having a robust AH and realm economy is integral to server health.
---
I know! Isn't it brilliant!!
---
Can't wait to see all the Thex variants running around the Barrens and shit posting in general chat.
---
Yup
---
implying that you can somehow be a fast leveler which is immensely complex but fail at something as simple as playing your class? 
---
Sounds unlikely buddy.
---
I think it will be hard. Just the changes compared to private servers of reduced crit chance on bosses, and bosses having high parry chance is going to be nasty on characters that are all fresh 60. 
---
Even when people have killed rag super early on private servers it’s like a 6+ hour raid. If any one of the bosses is harder in an unexpected way it could make the raid take longer and longer until even unemployed European and Arab failsons would strain to stay focused/enthusiastic about it.
---
Cya nerd. Coming to a sub you don’t like to complain about said sub is about the saddest thing I’ll see today.
---
Hyena packs in Desolace assuming you can AoE or cleave and have skinning.
---
I was part of a day 10 clear on a Pserver about a year ago. None account shared but obviously you can argue stuff about how difficult the raid itself is.
---
yeah maybe you are right on that one
---
Well see you know, it's the specific instance of you taking time to make friends on a server and establish yourself there.
---
Which implies you already know it is low population. Which means you already know the state of the auction house. Which means it doesn't concern you for your experience on that server.
---
Whatever, fukn casual
---
Don’t listen to him. This is just a thexperiment to see if we have the thexpertise to post dozens of thexceptional thex related memes.
---
Lol businesses need to be able to operate.  You think it makes sense to just let everyone go on vacation at the same time?  Also how on earth can it take you hundreds of hours to plan a vacation, and even if it did your first step should be checking with your boss to see if those days are available.
---
Anyway I'll fill out your 2 no call no show papers and then you'll get shitcanned, enjoy! Lol.
---
Well memed
---
I am personally looking to do support class this time around i think. Only issue to remember and no one seems to know, classic will cost gold each time to respec your talents capping at 50g if i remember.
---
Wow, I mean I’d imagine most of the time shaving is going to happen in that range rather than 40-60, but that’s still quite impressive.
---
You won't be contacted for making a portal or food for tips.  You have a pet to do weird shit like interrupt, cc, provide buffs or be a second tank.  You can replace people that leave mid dungeon without everyone leaving the run.  You get more self healing.  You have an unkillable wpvp and bg spec.  You can win fights vs shadow priests.
---
Same.  Sarkoth --&gt; Echeyakee --&gt; King Bangalash was my path I believe.
---
This could prove to be the first acceptable case of keyboard turning in the history of WoW. :-P
---
This guide works for all classes, you just have to incorporate your own class quests into the guide yourself and you are all set.
---
I wonder which class will have the most poops...
---
My first guild memory is me not knowing my way around a keyboard.
---
I misspelled something, so I went to type "oops" in gchat but forgot where the o was so it took a second. 
---
Someone else said something about not doing drugs (I think because I was their Spriest's little brother? I don't recall why) and my response was "oops"
---
It went over well, and had I known how to type, I would've replied in a joking way, but I hadn't even read it until after I sent my "response"
---
in fairness, he meant "in a **blizzard** second"
---
scratch spriest from the list imo.
---
Indeed. This is also why they could do Classic with a tiny team instead of the 100+ army they use to make an expansion.
---
Adding a T to Hex is bound to be thought of by some troll caster. He is just the one who made it public. And now the absurdity spread.
---
You can just ignore it lol.
---
I think item names are a great choice
---
Is it considered a jump run if your not jumping?.. Scholo jump runs involve an actual jump lol
---
I hope southpark make another episode about it.
---
When it's a re-release of an old game..
---
I started playing when I was \~20 and was still in uni.  7-8 months into the game we had a 6 month internship to do. My friend and me thought it'd be a good idea to, instead of applying for actual internships, 'work' for a friend. We were both doing freelance work after school at the time, you know, when web development was still easy and everyone and their mother wanted a website with webshop.
---
So, having a load of friends and acquaintances that were also freelancers or had their company. We got to chatting with one of them and he was happy to be a part of or scheme to have 6 months off. For the internship we downloaded osCommerce, styled it a bit and 'added' a bunch of features. - this solely consisted of downloading addons or whatever they were called.
---
This freed us up to play WoW for 5.5 straight minus one hour a week to sent in progress reports.
---
Now, 34 year old me will be having a hard time pulling this off! And next to taking off a week of work for launch, I'm afraid my playtime will be severely hampered.  At least I'll know what I'm doing this time - ish!
---
Cheers to you, sir. Apologies for not mentioning you in the post.
---
I think that my experience will be affected in game. I will be posting my realm to the sub and I can only assume that I will have people approaching and whispering me in game. I welcome it. I fully appreciate the affects of a thriving community. To my "followers" I say: Well met!
---

I mean... let’s not crucify your own kind here bud lol.  I know I can be toxic as well but let’s not act like we the all perfect :)
---
Potions during the leveling process can help a lot, and don't be shy about healing (even as enhance) while leveling. Just pick up int/mp5 gear as offset gear if there are no good options for enhance during questing!
---
It would just be a constant stream of graveyard running and Rez sickness
---
&gt;Just the changes compared to private servers
---
Yes but I've heard the dmg dealt is significantly lower than Pservers too, from beta testing (obviously they couldn't test raid bosses)
---
Yes MC will def be a loooong ass raid week 1 even week 2/3, but definitely manageable and if you wipe 1-2 times only , maybe 3-4 hours. 
---
Big thing everyone is forgetting: mages don't get 55 water til p2 and you can't get 55 water from argent until you have the rep (revered? Exalted? Idk) 
---
So basically, week 1/2 MCs will be on lvl 45 water LMAOOO blizz mastertroll that alone will take an extra 30 sec per drink, essentially. That time added up over the course of an entire 10 boss raid! That's like 15 minutes maybe more of just drinking!!! Lolol
---
I too am an addict.  What works for me and what I recommend for you is to get a hobby that will get you out of the house.  Any type of exercise is great. My hobby is running.  Sitting at the cpu all day can lead to depression and apathy.  Don’t let it take over your life.  Good luck to you sir.
---
Ya this is really interrupting all the super serious discussions about a game that won’t be out for 26 days.
---
I'm a Shaman, true and through. If I do not get my name, then it was meant to be. So say the winds of destiny.
---
Any chance of upgrading that memory to 8GB? Feels like you would want 8GB just to run normal applications.
---
Yeah, if you get caught.
---
Haha this reminds of when my friends ex started playing. She used to laugh at me and, talk about how the game was dumb. When she said she was going to try it because of her BF. I warned her wow can be addictive. Especially if you have a certain personality type. She laughed at me. Well not 6 months later. She had put on 60 pounds was playing 14+ hours a day and, my friend caught her sending topless photos to their guild leader for loot prio. She fell fast bro. Real fast lol.
---
Having a lot of players is literally something you guard against in online games that use servers that have bottlenecks and limited resources.
---
Warlocks also make good herbalists because you can send your pet in grab the herb sacrifice it and gtfo and the pet doesn’t get mad :)
---
Several guilds on k3 achieved week 1 rag kills. Crazyness
---
I will probably hit 60. But before I do I will at least have one burnout with a break of 2-3 months. I will most likely play from 2-3 months before burnout.
---
Dwarf rogue, it has a great racial and dwarves are the best alliance race. Rogues are pretty viable for pve and pvp..gonna roll dagger spec.
---
Technically this is right at the beginning of BC. XP bar, Resilience.
---
Everone will have a rogue, as a alt. Was like that in vanilla
---
Blizzard will still be going strong. In 1000 years all that will remain are cockroaches and Blizzard.
---
I think this has to do with blizzard making zone "contested" for alliance when they really shouldn't be. How in the hell is RedRidge contested? Where are we even contesting it from?
---
The zone where alliance normally start camping horde is STV. Because theres not better earlier zone thats convenient. I mean you could do thousand needles but, it's only like 3 levels lower and much harder to get too. Most horde stay safely nestled in the Barrens for a long time. So early camping like "RedRidge" isn't an issue.
---
you think you know how classic works.. but... you don't
---
No idea. Vanilla would run fine, but Classic has a modern engine, and better gfx. It's worth it to try though.
---
Be sure to blow the dust out of the laptop every once in a while.
---
&gt; For now. The Eurogamers interview made it clear they are open to new things down the road. The exact same arguments occured with runescape but progress won out due to people getting bored eventually. 1.13 is already a different game, it's not about capturing everything, that's impossible. It's about recreating the experience of classic.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; The team was still balancing classes when TBC was announced which caused rebalancing to be put aside. Classic is all about the design philosophy, which includes stuff being imbalanced but also included making things playable. A good example being Lacerate in the hunter tree, what a pile that was!
---
&gt; Absolutely hate the cross-realm PvP inclusion, hope we can kill that
---
Yes they did say they were open to things in the future, and every poll taken on here and by far TBC is the most popular suggestion.  But let's just say classic + was close behind.
---
Which would be a better option for blizzard?  Making a TBC server and pleasing the crowd that wanted it, while also leaving the ones who just want classic alone?
---
Or appealing to the ones that want classic +, and ruining the game for the others who just want classic forever.  
---
We can speculate what they do after nax is gone for a long time.  But most of my arguments are for the time classic is released.
---
Is the insane title active during vanilla? I can't remember.
---
No, dungeon lvling only is fast in pregroups, but there its even faster then normal leveling. i believe the best group is 4 warriors and one druid, or something like that, or 4 mages with 1 priest. So getting all the classes 60 should be theoretically possible, even though i think 8-9 days is more realistic.
---
At least you’re honest with yourself. In my opinion leveling is more fun than 60 in Vanilla, so I might need to take a break after hitting 60 if I don’t want to burn myself out before reaching some end game goals this time around
---
Your thread was also indirectly the reason for this AMA! One one of his comments on your post, I jokingly told Thex to go ask the mods if he could hold an AMA. He told me to go ask them myself, so I did. You can see how that turned out haha.
---
Half expected your character's name to be Thex
---
You realise you need a corpse to cannibalize?
---
Wrong, they could technically label them server 1, 2, 3 etc and apply names later. Super duper doubtful they will but we don't HAVE to have names on the 12th, technically
---
Definitely, I remember even theorycrafting with my fury buddy to take that mace because tanks wouldn't want it and he was way down the line for weapon upgrades. It's a nice statstick though if threat is no longer an issue.
---
I wonder if people would be pissed if Blizzard added a secret phase for Rag. I won't be anywhere near world firsts so it wouldn't affect me much, but I'd find it funny.
---
It won't happen regardless but the reactions would be cool to see tbh.
---
Because its not ment for new players its for 
---
Returning players 
---
Players that play on private servers
---
Current Players
---
you might not think but  some people already did the classic thing and dont care about coming back. Kids these days dont care about a 15 year old game but well follow who they watch on stream.
---
How has this not been upvoted yet. That one actually made me chuckle a bit
---
In the chattuh
---
&gt;Its is recommended, but not needed.
---
&gt;You need 2 tanks with 285 FR unbuffed, otherwise no you don't need any as dps/heals.
---
&gt;If you have trouble reaching the cap of 315 you can also get the LBRS buff with 81 fire resistance.
---
&gt;last time we tried raggy w/o fr cap the mt didnt resist a single knockback. It's obviously possible, but unfun.
---
Would link the source but not sure if I'd get banned for 'advertising' a server
---
Or just add and format another one. Hard drives are not expensive and you can just look up a youtube video on how to install and format a new hard drive.
---
Sorry 'bout dat
---

---
hardiness is OP
---
Rogue if played right may be the best. Warlocks also.
---
Haha it happens. I definitely did some dumb things when I was younger too. No doubt more guild drama is coming for plenty of people in this sub. You have been warned! Hopefully it’s not as bad since a lot of us have aged quite a bit, but that doesn’t always help some people
---
It's hard to play around in numbers comparing to a private server.  
---
Private server - People search it up and decide to play on it, high chance of reaching 60.  
---
Classic server - People may "try it out", quit and go back to retail.  
---
Also, we have:  
---
Private sever - Unofficial server, will eventually lose characters, not motivational enough  
---
Classic server - Official server, can level at slower pace or go back and forth, motivational to play.
---
Another reason why i may just run alcemy. Im expecting to heal as enhance for many dungeons. Should be fine I think so long as I make sure to have an off set of gear.
---
orc warlock, resist the sun and fap :D

[Music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvnLgCx67rs) drifts through the cool air, weaving lazily through the bouts of laughter and cheers of a lively rabble. Above the tavern door is a simple, wooden sign with a hammer carved upon it. You step inside and are greeted with the scene of an exuberant crowd, yelling out answers to the dwarf running a trivia contest. 
---
The barkeep waves you in with the time-honored request. "Interest yah in a pint?"

We are a light RP guild. We do not intend to have our own guild story arcs but we're happy to join and help create server-wide ones! Our tavern is easily accessible to **all Alliance races in Ironforge**.
---
Our main focus is to establish a community of friends from all walks of life that enjoy the game without resorting to abusive behavior. We're here to have fun in dungeons, questing, exploring, professions, and creating stories. &lt;The Idle Hammer&gt; will host weekly trivia, games, and other events in Ironforge.

That's where I was saying (from my experience in vanilla as a rogue), when you're clearing Naxx is only when people will realistically start seeing themselves actually fill up a BiS list.
---
I was thinking of DM:east jump runs the loot and rich thorium veins at the end, presumed that's what OP was talking about.
---
I know I was making a joke
---
im at rogue, warlock or warrior where the warrior is winning atm
---
Nobody is going to hit their BiS list.  People are going to make compromises.  As a Paladin, all plate +heal gear goes to you.  You're not competing with anyone else for that gear, plain and simple.
---
Welcome, welcome, welcome Welcome, welcome, welcome Welcome, welcome, welcome Welcome, welcome, welcome Welcome, welcome, welcome Welcome, welcome, welcome Welcome, welcome, welcome. Felt very good. I was very surprised!

Haha I think we made a lot of old farts pissed off by contributing to this whole thex thing, but It’s been the most fun I’ve had on this forum. I haven’t payed attention to work in 2 days, that’s the point of reddit right !!!
---
The guild farming just needs to mass report anybody else killing mobs and that person(s) will be banned.
---
Oohhhh we are blessed by the great. Srgrafo.
---
Yes which is why it's useful in 1vsX, there's also no shortage of corpses in the world while questing/grinding or just bodies of players.
---
Cannibalize is the most underrated racial, especially for warlocks.
---
A vael attempt that goes all the way to 3 minutes would be very unlikely to be a kill. So many of your healers would be dead by then.
---
Yes please
---
Gonna run back'n forth at tarren mill for days on end.  Then rush to lvl 30 and live in strangle thorn for a month or five.  Eventually I might try and get to 60.  :D
---
Some rough back of the envelope calculations.
---
* Assume each two letter combination of letters must have both a consonant and a vowel to sound intelligible.
---
* Assume "y" can be used as either a consonant (so 21 total) or a vowel (so 6 total), but that the combination "Yy" cannot count as a name.
---
Total combinations: 21 x 6 = 126 - 1 ("Yy) = 125
---
* Further assume that each combo can be flipped so that either the vowel or consonant comes first and be equally intelligible
---
125 x 2 = 250 total possible names with two letters on a server. So yeah, not many options and they'll all get scooped up fast.
---
Have your guild mass report anybody that shows up out there.  The other people tagging mobs will probably be banned for a day or two until somebody reviews the ticket.
---
I had a literal blast leveling a druid in a vanilla server. I decided to bear tank for shits and giggles, just to see how far I could take it.
---
As long as you don't mind not tanking in progression raids, I say go Druid. The only reason I'm rolling druid is I already did it!
---
Thinking about going warlock myself, lots of class lore, free mount, caster, OP pvp, useful in raids, etc.
---
Nefarian add phase is a dps check too.
---
It killed my guild not needing such a larger roster for a raid.
---
Ferahgo (druid) made some good PVP videos.
---
wtf is this what IS THEX
---
Baby boomer on computer
---
Indeed it was.
---
Ah man, me neither. I think the OP removed it.
---
What class should I main?!
---
Always glad to see people from that forgotten server -
---
Still remember the Kazzak and Azuregos Zerg during the early days. 
---
Inspiration and Memento Mori!
---
You only need 4GB to run classic.
---
Troll: "If you cut it off, it grows bigger."
---
Orc: OwO
---
Do you know from what patch the 2nd ed. was? I can't find any mention of it in mine other the "...after 12 patches..."
---
The youtubers did the art, or what? All the actual information is public knowledge at this point; whoever was the first person to express an opinion like "Prot and Fury warriors are great at raids but Arms is just okay" or "Warrior leveling sucks" is lost to the mists of time.
---
Arena, better class balance (Druid main lol), dual spec.
---
You are very smart for a black bear
---
That just gets your character to use hearthstone. The workaround is getting someone to invite an alt of yours and have that character reset the instance.
---
It needs to be working within the next week or so, character creation opens on the 13th
---
We were going for the world first tbh.
---
Because I enjoed that PVE experience?
---
Because its 2 entirely separate games with entirely separate development teams (MW - Infinity Ward and BO4 - Treyarch). They just happen to both be a part of the same series. Classic is an old version of the same game and same development team. While I think it could be more prominent than a dropdown, I don't think it needs its own new tab.
---
Bingo!
---
Depends if you want to be self-sufficient and make your own gear, or go for profit and buy what you need.
---
Look up if druids can do the devilsaur farm, may be a factor in your choice.
---
I seriously doubt it but I kind of hope the pserver community gets very surprised by a lot of the mechanics the pservers got wrong and that it throws wrenches in their plans. Not just specifically for a quick Rag kill but for all aspects of the game.
---
*scoffs* ..you are not prepared..
---
How many guild are going to be organizing a rep grind for a week on rag on the same servers. I think your deluded if you think they are going to be enough people doing this to fill up the layers as well.
---
Johnathen Colton is a bamf
---
Should be perfectly fine for 60fps on low settings.
---
Asmongold (has only one layer)
---
Sodapoppin (launches October 27th)
---
Shroud (closes after first month)
---
Classicast (alliance only memepvp)
---
Imagine being that clueless. To truly not understand what you're doing wrong.
---
they will find you on whatever server you join...don't worry
---
You theoretically only need 1 person with enough rep. He just gets warlock summoned back and forth for each item.
---
Someone can't get their pash-on for fash-on.
---
Didn't pre-tbc patch do anything to affect it?
---
You're definitely wrong for not using engi on a druid, it adds even more mobility to a class that already has tons of it. You're basically crippling yourself if you play a druid without engineering, rocket boots, helm, net, invis trinket, grenades etc. are pretty much a must if you plan on doing any kind of serious pvp, same thing goes for hunters. I would say warlocks "need" it the least, would rather have lips and faps on a warlock. 
---
And lastly, I have no idea what you mean when you say there is no "space" for rocket helm/shoes?? After you've used the item you unequip it and switch back to your tier set.
---
4GB will work.  You'll for sure be able to run a solid 30 FPS if you cap the frames.  You might get some chug in raids, but you can always drop down to 720p for that.
---
If your system has dual channel memory, I would look into that.  Putting 2x4GB will be a pretty decent performance boost.  I've got an i3 8 series intel with intel UHD 620 with 4GB RAM.  I was running the 1.12 client hovering in 50-60 frames at 1080p on low settings.  
---
I plopped in a 16GB stick from my work laptop, but I had 20GB in dual channel for 8GB (4+4) of that.  My frames were then going anywhere from 60-100 in some random peaks.  But I'd say that my average jumped up maybe 10-15 frames, which is about a 20% performance boost.  Which is pretty damn good just to get dual channel memory.
---
Now, how that translates to the WoW: Classic, it should be similar.  The base engine might be a little more heavy, but the Classic data is so much less taxing on your CPU/GPU, that you should be similar results.
---
I will hit 50 in October.   Great "birthday gift" to have Classic :)  I manage to find Free Time, even with a family, extended family, and I just transitioned to a new role at my job.  Learning to be a Database Admin (t-SQL) with no prior knowledge :)
---
Gotta make time for fun, or lose your mind! lol
---
Is it possible to install just classic without the rest of BFA from the launcher? Pretty much the only thing preventing me from playing tbh
---
Fool me once, strike one. But fool me twice... strike three.
---
A druid tank might be manageable. There's a lot of BiS gear that can be had outside of the endgame dungeons. Just have a guild funnel a warden staff to the druid. The amount of threat a druid can generate would be helpful.
---
But now you're talkinf about an PvE server?
---
I’m a big fan of the current hype and think the OP is a shaman troll called Thex
---
Did you say free t-shirt day????
---
be right back buying twenty years of game time
---
Also, to a note on your laptop stuff.  Going Dual Channel memory in my laptop gave me around 20% performance boost.  So if someone has a single stick of memory and can double their RAM and get Dual Channel, it will help them a decent chunk.
---
Area 51 memes after &lt;1 day...
---
There was also a druid that soloed her in TBC.  And that rogue that tanked Gruul was neat, too.
---
this is some half assed joint advert for classic and retail...
---
Legend är du, b
---
All these "vanilla veterans" that only played pserver...
---
But it's less than a month, so we'll see how it plays out. I have extremely high doubt that "Ragnaross kill ready" geared people will be available in 40 ppl raids before 1 month after the release.
---
For sure, and thats a lot to juggle lol - good luck with the new job!
---
They are two separate games.  You can install either/or.
---
Have you already picked a timezone (for the Horde PvP guild)?
---
I think the biggest reason I wouldnt stick with Classic is if I dont have people to play with. My group of colleagues IRL isnt really big enough to necessitate a guild so I'm semi-interested. BC represent!
---
You would not be swapping into shadowform if you run a 5man as a healer though...
---
Wait, that's illegal.
---
Similar story here, was alliance, friends were alliance. However recent retail has been mostly horde. I did a few different private servers on horde to try it out. I found I much preferred Alliance, I just couldn't get used to hanging out in Org, I didn't like the dusty huts of most horde towns. Windfury is fun, zeppelins are convenient, but for me fantasy has always been elves and dwarves, big castles, and mountain fortresses. It's just such a better aesthetic on the alliance, keeps me interested longer. I would caution going horde on launch to 'try something new.'
---
Yeah that could influence those servers potentially, but other servers it'll be hard to tell. Also, idk how accurate that website will be. I know Sodapoppin for example doesn't want people to know what server he's on, so even if people "find out" it could be a distraction for his real server.
---
Many Hunter pets will be called Thex I bet
---
Yeah, that more or less describes me, although I'm not sure if all the time I spent playing WoW back then was a symptom of a diffent problem or cause of it. It did set me back 5-10 years career wise/financially compared to where I could be if I had finished school the first time around. That said, it could be worse. Eventually I went back to school and I'm working a decent job now, at least I didn't get addicted to heroin or become an alcoholic or something.
---
Those shouldn't even be allowed
---
is it available for download?
---
The thex meme stopped being funny after like an hour.  Ya'll disgust me.
---
The new canon: A troll shaman named Thex. He came to lead the horde to new glory, united under his banner.
---
What is GFPP?
---
What? Finally some OC memes around here and not "HuW WoRLd of wArCRaFt SavED mY LiFae" and other truly depressing shit.

How do you think this guide would do in a three man leveling group? I imagine some dungeon supplementing can help
---
Leggomyeggolas

to be fair its also 13 years older asset-wise

I hope so.
---
If Demo or slow shout unstealths why wouldn t frost trap?
---
PvP were balanced weren't they?
---
Scatter and freezing sharing DR is weird as hell. Makes no sense. Scatter's sole purpose in PvP is to set up trap.

Dangit, I knew I missed something.
---
Diremaul east with a fury warrior is the obvious choice for any healer. You need mining + enchanting and optionally herbalism. Enchanting does not have to be maxed or anything 1/300 will do you are just DE'ing. Typically the warrior has the mining. Here's a video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVUKcRqesto
---
Other than that you can do typical profession stuff like herbalism and become guild enchanter. 
---
Oh and the DME aoe farming you can do as a priest too. Not sure how good it will be on classic though.
---
Lastly you can run through dungeons with a tank and reserve items for gold. Scholomance and Stratlive are the obvious choices.
---
Not everyone plays WoW to raid.  And for smaller raids like ZG its really not a big deal to have a ret pally or ele shaman or something.  The dps is good enough and some of the utility they bring can be quite nice actually.  If you want to hardcore raid with perfect raid composition then go have fun.  Doesn't mean someone can't play a cat druid and do pvp, dungeons etc. and hey maybe a guild that isn't so strict would toss a raid invite, happened to me every so often when I played hybrid in vanilla.
---
Doesn't the 4 set tier 3 for Warriors give enough hit to never miss a taunt?
---
Yeah, I would be surprised if none of the top guilds use a druid tank for at least the trash mobs. I think they've been proven and theory crafted enough that a top guild would try it to get an edge.

Hi, /u/MysticPilloww

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ckspuh/im_trying_heavily_everyday_x_amount_of_times_to/). 
---
&gt; I'd like to know why it's a necessary evil when other private servers launched over the years without layering with 10,000+ people per realm.
---
Those private realms usually implimented dynamic spawn rates for NPCs and resource nodes. This solution has its own set of related issues. And honestly, I think layering is a better solution than dynamic respawns. (But that could definitely be debated.)
---
&gt; Loot trading is not needed. They just needed a policy to say they wouldn't help with loot issues.
---
I wish loot trading wasn't in the game too. But I also don't think it is a big deal. Remember that Activision Blizzard has reduced their support staff significantly in recent years. This change will help them run classic servers with less staff. Would it be better if they had more staff to answer tickets and no loot trading? Of course! But this is what we have and its pretty great.
---
&gt; Just wait until next year, I will quote this thread when cash shop is implemented.
---
Like I said, if that does happen I will be pissed off as well. Cash shop is 100% going too far. And we have no way of knowing that it wont happen, we can only hope.
---
No idea how blizzard are doing it, but the meat is used for a recipe cannot be obtained before the war effort so that's actually phase 5. The meat shouldn't drop but it might due to some oversight.

You’re telling me no one is going to take the name bb? Or like ow? No? Qq!? I’d argue you should just count all 2 letter names, making the calculation much simpler...
---
26 x 26 = 676
---
there's the reply i was looking for.
---
Im rollingashaman named Thex
---
What will be the name of your guild?
---
3 things I think would be just great for post naxx:
---
Tbc - I loved tbc and I want it.. it would be my favorite expansion if it weren't for flying. Take away flying and make tbc wpvp great again. 
---
Fresh classic servers. Sweet sweet fresh hype works for me.
---
Third... this is a little more vague but I'd love to see some distributed WoW servers... make a wow workshop and let players make servers based on their wildest dreams and some of them may be really interesting. I get that this isn't as easy as minecraft or overeatch or sc map editor, but there are tons of nerds that would go ham and make something great.
---
Not of itemrack. I hope someone makes a classic version of itemrack or something similar. I guess someone will have to once everyone is 60 and people start to realize there isn’t a classic version.
---
Oof
---
Wash it down with some Wetlands
---
Combat Rogue.
---
where can i find and install classic wow? it doesnt show in my launcher
---
WoW is love.
---
WoW is life.
---
None of those screenshots are from "right now" nor do they even use the current Battle.NET client you liar.
---
Not really, if you want the closest thing to outlaw rogue you gotta go with a shaman named thex
---
PvE combat wise? Probably Warrior. I’m not sure if you know but classes play way differently in Vanilla. It might not be a good idea to come in with an expectation of a class feeling like retail
---
/thread
---
No idea how outlaw works but if you want melee cleave then both combat sword rogue and warrior does that very well.
---
rogues do not cleave in classic. one ability on a 2 minute cooldown does not count as cleave. if you want to cleave you play warrior.
---
I prefer memes to be clever, at least in origin, and worth a chuckle.  It seems Classic WoW was not up to that task.
---
Sure, just go to Goldshire, you’ll see how immersive it is.
---
Ni, it's BC.
---
I'm gonna show myself out.
---
what if you are playing from olive garden?
---
It's incredible what you people will pull out of your ass because reddit told you activision bad
---
I got no clue what it really means, but it looks like some 10 years olds making fun of the word "sex", being to shy to name it.
---
Yes, you can also do all the elite quests if you are a group which will help supplement the missing xp, so shouldn't be a problem
---
Um.. you know hardcore players are playing right? Including the people from private servers that have done week one kills? And they’ll be in a guild together? And they have set routes and plans to have attunements rep gearing etc all done insanely fast? 
---
The world first week one kill won’t be some randoms throwing something together in trade chat. This shit is being coordinated hardcore - right now.
---
3.7out of 10 people. Not great, not terrible...
---
No sorry
---
Check the photo I just added. From patch 8.1.0. Of course none of them are from "right now" besides the one that is from right now, which you're excluding. Jesus you're insane.
---
Lmao, I was joking. I hope you know who Mike Tyson is and how he talks. On a serious note, I believe Thex is a name someone said they wanted and it's a meme now.
---
Why did we prefer fast weapon speed? Doesn't make sense
---
Only if you participated in one of the Stress Tests, the next one (whenever that'll be) will allow you to download it
---
Speak for yourself.
---
Thex, I hate it
---
Basically just running with reserved items, shouldn't be hard to implement.
---
Some iteration of loot lists would also suit you if you want the benefits of council without the bickering. Just set up primary status on MT, OT, etc drops
---
I see /r/factorio is leaking.
---
I got Thex. I guess I should go with that instead of my original plan of Thex.
---
When I was around level 35 I whispered this popular guild on my server to join, they said they only take 40+ but I could join their low level/alt guild that was for 1-39 so I joined that.

I happened to get this warlock quest that required killing an elite infernal at about the same time so I asked for help in guild. The only one who offered was a level 29ish rogue. Did I mention the quest was red or orange for me? It was actually a level 40 elite quest. Yeah it didn't go well but after multiple deaths, clever soulstone rezzes we did finally kill it! I thought I would get an infernal pet or something like that but nope and all he got was a repair bill haha...but I did end up raiding with that rogue, who rerolled hunter, for a long time through a several guild mergers and changes. Even helped get his Rhok'delar by dueling him and using Curse of Recklessness to avoid the fear for one of the steps.
---
Side note, was having a lowbie/alt guild a common thing? Seems odd in retrospect but seemed totally normal to me at that time. I pretty much stayed with the core group that made up that guild for the rest of Vanilla and TBC so I didn't pay attention to what was common among guilds really.
---
A pun of sorts. It sounds like "sex" and "hex" at the same time, hence **troll.**
---
Most likely the current normal reset times for retail. So the Tuesday following release (for US) or the following Wednesday (for EU). So people will have about 14 days to level and gear to stay within the 2nd reset.
---
Origin is simple and stupid as hell, but that just adds to the fun of it imo.
---
Someone fill me in. What am I missing here
---
I mean private servers were also free so no initial investment to sink in at all would make people less likely to stay.

Loot systems aren't one size fits all you gotta pick what works for your guild and its culture.   Its probably a mistake to set anything in stone before you even get to the point of being able to reliably turn out 40 people.  But yeah I could imagine a hybrid loot system where a council decides the big ticket items and other stuff is dkp.

Plus, this is how every meme ever is born. Someone says something, or creates a funny picture, and bam - meme. Some are funny, some aren't, but what's happened here is exactly what they are.
---
Im in uni, but most weeks it's 2 to 4 days with class or 8am to 11am only. So even on uni days I can do 8 hours. Weekend and 2/3 days per week can go 16 hours. So I estimate like 80-85 hours per week first month - if I like the game.
---
You have basically proven a point that has been pointed out a lot.
---
Did I go around claiming that I am perfect or that I am always polite? No, not at all. So I don't really see the point of checking my comments to "Prove me wrong" despite me never claiming to be perfect?
---
So once again: Please point out where I ever claimed that I was always polite/friendly?  What you did right now was to dig into my post history, see that I am not the most friendly person around (Which, once again, I have never claimed) to post this which has absolutely no relevance to the topic at hand.
---
The difference is that I always try to remain within the rules of the subreddits and as such, I have not been banned yet, something that the OP can't claim as he obviously broke the rules of the forum.
---
TBC, if it even happens, is a long time away.  I would focus on the vanilla experience and leave it at that.  First off, the paladin mount isn't exactly free, but it is cool, and the quest is neat.  Druids are definitely better at leveling, but as you stated a lack of out of combat rez does kinda suck for doing 5 mans.  Paladins are bit of a slower, meticulous playstyle, with constantly buffing, casting seals and judgements, and druids are more fluid, dynamic, but also squishier due to leather armour and no bubble.
---
Iirc that was after TBC prepatch so not really vanilla. 41 point talents changed a lot.
---
I deliberated for some time commenting "Nobody gives a fuck about your baby" on that one post about playing with just a mouse because of baby.
---
Like for real I swear the people commenting stupid shit don't care about the baby either. All a bunch of circle jerking.

Not to disrespect your work, which is great, but I think it will be easier to level with this  [https://allyroute.com/](https://allyroute.com/) , cause its an addon and will not need alt-tab to check steps :P

Caring about your health is for losers
---
Great guide to maximize efficiency, but I think part of the charm of classic is to stop and smell the flowers. I will probably use this on my third or fourth toon, however.
---
I believe as long as the account has the same name and address it should not be an issue, I don’t know how they will handle account transfers on classic servers however.
---
I told him good play the game your way. I think your doing some gatekeeping. If someone wants to play a barbarian that's fine. If someone wants to play like a World of warcraft warrior with all plate that's fine too. Idk why your being so judgemental.
---
You got bamboozled look at you hahah - Mirage
---
Hey, the flair is up!
---
Hunter is not nearly as good at 1vX as mage or warlock. CC is less reliable, deadzone, less survivability. It’s really not even close
---
Ehh It's a reference to a Monty Python character that in hindsight was a poor choice for username. I'm just waiting for the reddit to allow name changes as I'd hate to loose all track of all the sub reddits I frequent and saved posts.
---
The episode clip is on YouTube if you'd like to see it. Just search "Monty Python Mr Hilter election" or something like that, should pop up.
---
Just avoid super undergeared tanks and you'll be 100% fine as shadow. You'll get a decent heal set very fast running dungeons as the healers as well.
---
Combat swords in classic was changed to outlaw in legion.
---
Actually true Pog
---
But wouldn’t they just reply with “There is no way to access it atm.” Unless you were invited to beta, then it might work, if you have not played during beta.
---
I will make a character named Thex aswell!
---
Ehh, there's only major European languages like German, Spanish, French, Italian, Russian etc. with translated clients. This goes for WoW and honestly most other international media. 15 years ago and even earlier Scandinavians just coped and learned English when using the internet.

---
Russian hackers, clearly. Damn ruskies.
---
Not nearly as good
---
I can't really help you decide, but I wouldn't put too much weight on the TBC server aspect of your decision. We have no idea if they will even happen, and if they did, it will be a long time from now. Who knows where you will be in your life by then. You might not even be playing the game or have already rerolled.

You don’t play the character, Thex. The character Thex plays you.

I started on Lightnings Blade and was a total noob throughout my tenure on that server. I messaged Aedak that I liked his hammer and he said "thanks :)". I'm sure he got it all the time but it tickled me that someone with his status took the time to politely reply.
---
I feel personally attacked

Just wow. This...is. really awesome.

Yeah, Activision doesn't have any control over Blizzard. The shareholders of Activision-Blizzard on the other hand do.

Maybe dont try to get into such long and grindy games so close to the release?

Yeah T-Mog is amazing and who the fuck complains about having easy options for character customization?
---
I can't play anything else but that's because the other game I play is fortnite and epic added a fucking megazord.
---
why would you gear people who are not performing and dedicated to attending thou ? That will just cripple your progression as a guild.
---
Welcome to WoW! Sadly even the regular WoW reddit is a lot of meme lords too. It is great if that is what you want but for guides and info the fan sites are often the best. I am a WoWhead fan my self. They have great guides and info. I also have been playing since Classic so if you have an itching Q send it to my inbox I will try to get it answered for you.
---
good point, I think I meant to say that the server population size matters, because that's the community you're comparing yourself to and those are the people who would most readily know that 'you accomplished X'
---
but at the end of the day, if you feel accomplished, that's reason enough to do it
---
Listen broha, you fkin prepare for it is what you do. The amount of players is only a problem if your predictions as to the player count is not accurate. Seriously this willfull stupidity has to have a bloody limit dude. Activision is not advertising for classic because they do not consider it worth. Yes, the game you like, the company that you somehow defend, they do bad things. Have you ever looked into the CEO of activision blizzard?

"No changes" was doomed from the start.

in retail vanilla they constantly MADE CHANGES so how would you recreate the game with none?

BFA has a lot more going on under the hood that makes it far more stressful on servers than Classic. The same servers could probably handle 10x more players on a Classic server than on a BFA server.

I opened it and 5 min later I can't see it. Removed?

That's a pog. Massive props on catching this /u/wowtitle

Are you really this dense?  The population we're going to see on Classic launch day will completely dwarf anything these private servers saw.  It's completely nonsensical that you're even trying to compare these things, and it immediately makes me want to ignore anything else you say because you're clearly choosing to be willfully ignorant here to push some agenda.

While I agree with some of this, people like you are the reason Blizzard Activision has ruined this franchise. They have put out nothing but garbage for a decade on going now, glad I haven't contributed anything dollars wise to encourage this nonsense.

Then you’ll need to eat plenty of fiber to handle the aftereffects of endless breadsticks.

Wow, checks out. As someone was already going to MB, this opens up so many possibilities
---
Funny so few people get this.  TBC invalidated almost everything you did in classic
---
Sure it will, because the games have subs tied together, if youre subbed to one youre subbed to both. Classic itself will probably hold steady round 250k (like best case) worldwide.
---
so basicly giving away disenchant-os loot ? shouldent that be /roll anyway ?

Yeah league keeps my attention at least. I didnt really expect to be so hyped on the classic WoW release. Didnt really think id be hopping on the bandwagon but about a week ago it just hit - i think witcher 3 is the last game i got like this about lol

If you really mean *Classic WoW*, we don't have a server list yet. If you're talking about current wow, r/WoW is where you want to be.
---
WoW can be addictive because of how much fun it is, but if it helps, it's not 100% fun at all times. Plenty of boring or frustrating moments. In those moments, instead of buckling down and grinding harder, get up, take a break, do something else. You'll be far happier when you know you've taken care of your real life responsibilities before you sit back down.

Free mount is meh, not that big, you have travel form as a druid at 30, (and feline swiftness at 20/21).

You can dps as a druid, especially if/when we get to TBC, even though DPS as a druid is a clusterfuck.

Herb/Alch, I would say go druid. Stealth + hibernate/sooth animal, great while herbing. And travel form while herbing is god.

Mike tyson is famous bóxer with a lisp so when he says sex it could sound like thex

I think at this point and for some odd reason it’s safe to assume most EU players do not have the option to download the client at this moment.

Really strange if you ask me. Saying this as a NA player. EU represents like 40% of the player base (don’t remember the actual percentage according to the recent posted survey)!
---
100% pulling it out of my ass.
---
Intel Core 2 Duo E6600 and NVIDIA GeForce 8800 was released in 2006, I seriously doubt this is the requirements.
---
It must be the Vanilla requirements
---
Well, the world is as it was. That is no lie. #nochanges was a fan movement never recognized by Blizzard. Classic is still a more authentic Vanilla experience than any Private Server ever was or will be.
---
I raided just fine in MC and further and never really had problems getting spots. Believe our guild had indeed something like 3/4 warlocks and 4-6 mages but that should not stop you from playing warlock.
---
The nights are quite long if you go for something popular but dislike playing, I always liked warlock because you have multiple options and I remember going between specs quite often and raided fine with it.
---
The warlock brings more then just some curses, I think with the current system in retail the amount of healthstone they use is quite big so can imagine people will use it more and demand it more from us.  
---
The soulstone was also very good and could mean live or death for your raid group depending on other cooldowns.
---
Also warlock have the problem early raiding they easily get agro from the tank so I remember in a lot of the early fights we had to start really slow compared to some other classes. Mage could simply Iceblock, later when gear for us as well as tanks get better the issue of aggro is less of a problem which means more dots.
---

Keff är ju arabiska, har jag för mig iallafall? Något slang som invandrarkidsen använde flitigt i Uppsala åtminstone.

Oh huh, friend of mine does not have it on their launcher and has an active sub to retail. Not sure what causes it to show up then
---
No idea what class/spec you are talking about as I haven't played retail in 10+ years but if you are looking for a cleaving rogue then the closest Rogue in vanilla would be a Combat Rogue with Bladefury. Rogues excel in single target dps however, the best melle cleavers by far are Fury warriors with Whirlwind and Cleave as a result they are high dps in multi mob and very high in single target fights as well.
---
maybe. but why change the icon to the ragnaros one if you going to have separate section.
---
What was your favourite Thex meme?
---
EU-Sylvanas is 95% Alliance. Kinda funny.
---
Trolls look good in shaman t1
---
And all is right in the world.
---
The interviewer made a mistake by using the generic term "gold farming", which a lot of people use to also just mean grinding, so the dev was trying to make it clear that anyone legitimately playing, but grinding for hours at a time to get gold, wouldn't get in trouble. The second dev's followup was more about their improved anti-cheat and anti-RMT measures compared to 2005.
---
Did you try reloggoning the bnet?
---
You won't need to "tank" outdoor content, nor will you need to be prot spec at all till level 60 dungeons, to make that clear. 
---
Money wise, thats an interesting question. There are tons of outdoor grind spots, but you'd be splitting the money of course. I'd try those first. Then i'd also try duoing slightly lower level dungeons to compare the money. Think green level elites.
---
You built a porn site?
---
That or they think the project is world of Warcraft (which it is). A game who already has a full tag. 
---
This isn’t really a big deal. Seriously they are giving us something we never expected could happen and people are upset about the launcher.
---
This sub needs more positivity and less complaining.
---
Choosing your server in Classic will be easy:
---
1. What region/timezone are you in? [Example: Europe]
---
2. What language do you speak? [Example: English]
---
3. Do you want PVP, PVE, or RP? [Example: PVP]
---
Congratulations, there is one server that fits your criteria, go there!
---
Lmao sounds good.  I’m semi super serious and I have most of winter off work to play so I get kind of obsessive. 
---
I’ll be busy until October-November but still trying to establish myself a bit and see if I can motivate to play for a while. 
---
I’ve been on Oldschool Runescape for the last few years and was averaging 9 hours a day for 2 years straight, but I also get some income from that so not sure if I can justify as much time into wow without it making money lol.
---
Is calling this a happy accident just a power^2 move in disguise to cover up you giving up your potential character name?
---
I will be so happy if he gets his name
---
Yeah I will bear tank while levelling too. Bear tanks are actually legit for raids though, have you seen Skarm’s videos?
---
Thank you
---
Even if you don't "think" you need one, studies have shown that you do. Take one more often.
---
Haha what? I go to lots of subreddits and the only one I view that spam the same joke would be r/moviescirclejerk and that’s only sometimes.
---
They will probably merge, don't worry about that. Regarding low population servers that is more of an issue with Retail.
---
Ret pally
---
The raids in vanilla don't require class stacking to complete unless you're very under geared.  You'll find a raid spot as a warlock just fine.
---
Play what you enjoy, because having alts in vanilla is a fucking grind.  If you're a min/max type of player then go mage over warlock.
---
Same just playing league and watching YouTube. Classic wow cant come soon enough.
---
I think you mean income from one expansion, not profit.
---
Wouldn't there be any RP PvP servers?
---
You just need a dedicated shadow weaving buddy. -15% hurts a lot if they're only there on some raid nights or are a bit slack on bothering with the debuff. All mages need is one Curse of Elements which is basically guaranteed in a 40man.
---
But i cant easily change specs, can i? If id like to do it as holy, would i be able to fight back?
---
I’m going to go out on a limb and guess your friend doesn’t know what a pull down is or where to look for it on the launcher
---
Been watching classic videos, therefore I understand this reference.
---
I think a lot less people will be level 60 in the first 2-4 weeks like everyone says they will.
---
But anyone who plays for more than 3 months or more? Very likely to see at least one 60 on those accounts.
---
But there will also be a ton of Altoholics who have 6 toons all hovering between level 10 and level 30.
---
That’s a month away, putting it now is very subtle advertising.
---
The twitch folks could even personally be fans of classic and did this to remind folks.
---
Leave some for the operating system!
---
I would liketo view the animations and such.
---
I hear ya man, I'm the heaviest I've ever been right now at 34 years old, and I KNOW that Classic release is going to wreak havoc on my body if I'm not careful.  
---
Currently I get lots of water (no soda, no calorie drinks while playing at all in fact) and mandating some physical activity at least 2-3 times a week for 60-90 minutes is usually acceptable for me, but I'm going to also entirely remove drinking alcohol on weekends and see if that makes a big enough difference to counter act the additional hours of sitting every week.  
---
I live in Austin and tacos are a real danger, I understand. Godspeed to us all!
---
Don't listen to dudes who get annoyed by a god damn sentence lol. Great video man I enjoyed it
---
Honestly, the game should've never increased the levelcap. That was mistake #1. Increasing levelcap makes earlier content so ridiculously easy with how defense mechanics (dodge, parries, misses, etc) are calculated to the point of trivialization. That just destroys any reason to ever do older content again. That's why they HAD to add stuff like transmog, to get a reason for people to revisit old storylines...
---
And honestly, if you get so powerful to where you can 2-3 shot the lich king, something is fucked completely... Nobody should be able to solo characters like lich king, deathwing, gul'dan, hell even nefarian.
---
All aboard the hype train!
---
No, Classic WoW will not have RP PVP servers at launch and Blizzard has made no discussion about adding them after launch beyond "we'll think about it".
---

I also enjoy the Night Elf aesthetic and shadowmeld for PVP/W-PVP.
---
But if I were to narrow it down to one reason, it's for the Saber mounts.
---
Rep grinding is a serious bitch and if I'm a Night Elf I can just buy the saber mounts no problem. I think Elves look best riding them too.

They don't give us a download classic option but they send me a mail telling me to buy STARCRAFT CARTOONED smh

who shit in your cereal buddy?

It’s a play on the movie Apocalypse Now, which is itself an adaptation of the novel Heart of Darkness. Storm wind military who has lost his mind to the jungle. Assuming the rebels are the few of his troops who are not in on his cult like group.
---
Hmmm... been a long time but arnt they like pirates or traitors to the alliance?
---
All of the repeat release date reminder posts. We get it.
---
Will Shatner edit.
---
Just poking through the Wowpedia:
---
&gt; Originally a talented and noble soldier from Stormwind, Colonel Conrad Kurzen led an expedition from Stormwind to Stranglethorn Vale. Unfortunately, sometime during the expedition, he fell victim to foul magic; his mind becoming possessed by Mai'Zoth, a powerful ogre mage of local Mosh'ogg ogre clan, seeking to use Kurzen and his men for their own deeds.
---
&gt; Although the majority of Kurzen's men still follow their leader, a small group of his men, troubled by this sudden change in Kurzen, rebelled and estalished their own group at the Rebel Camp. Unlike Kurzen's force, the rebels loyalties still lie with Stormwind. Lieutenant Doren, leader of the rebels wants Kurzen's head to bring an end to his madness.
---
So it looks like he was a Colonel in the Stormwind forces, and was sent to STV in an expedition. He got possessed, and his men rebelled against his madness.
---
Why would they split them? I dont see the point.
---
Exactly. Everyone says how easy raiding is in vanilla but won't dare step in without full flask/consumes. It's damn easy because people do an overkill with consumes for MC/BWL, maybe even AQ
---
It’s a stupid joke
---
It really doesn't matter what loot system you use (or even if you mix them) as long as your raid members don't feel like they're being screwed by the system. This is even more important in 'classic' due to
---
+ The sheer number of reliable, recurring raiders you need
---
+ The loot-to-raider ratio
---
***
---
If you're going to run a hybrid 'reserved system and run DKP (or other point system) ensure that the reserved loot still costs points equal to however much it would have if the point system was working normally (i.e. the reserved loot is an exception case, but still has the same cost as if it was divvied up normally, potentially having an increased cost to offset any discontent about it being reserved).
---
Making sure you don't lose raiders to attrition/guild hopping is much more important than priority gearing. The last thing you want to do is priority gear someone only for them to jump ship (it's also why priority gearing is a terrible idea when all things are said and done, compared to alternative systems). Giving someone (like a tank) gear sooner might make re-clearing easier, but fundamentally you didn't need that gear to do the initial clear in the first place (and that's the benchmark for all future loot).
---
So my 2013 MacBook Air is no good???
---
I was stuck between lock, mage and shaman, but now im really feeling hunter. Which is weird because hunter was bottom of my list before.
---
I was wondering who else would get the Apocalypse Now reference.
---
Region: NA.
---
Server: PvE/PvP.
---
Faction: Alliance.
---
Class: Warrior, tank/ot preferred but DPS is fine too. 
---
Raid availability: Friday and Saturday, 9:00pm-12:00am PST. 
---
Looking for: Semi-hardcore/midcore raiding guild, the raiding timeslot is most important for me as that's the only time I'm really available to raid. Also want to join up with a friend who's intending on playing Holy Paladin and has the same availability. We're both very laid back guys who are super hype for an oldschool MMO feel where things matter, and just want to play and have a good time with like-minded people. With our available playtime, we plan to hit cap in late October/early November. 
---
Experience: Hardcore raiding in FFXI at 75 cap, and WotLK (Naxx through ICC).
---
Hhahahahaha the edit ahahhaa
---
I can only hope it's sooner than that.  
---
I swear, kids today don't know what to do besides make memes out of everything and eat tide pods.

I agree, but you got super pissed off for no reason.

"How do you kill that which has no life?" Is one of my favorite South Park lines ever.

With GOT being tainted, only LOTR could stand in to take its place.
---
it means the game is shit now and classic will make it playable. not rocket science my friend
---
It’s a shitty joke
---
Take this, and add to it being an even smaller country with less native speakers, and that language needs to be written right to left - thus needing everything in the UI being basically mirrored, and you get the situation here in Israel.  
---
You either learn to deal with English, or you're limited to the bare minimum when it comes to PCs and multimedia.
---
Shadow priests are monsters 1v1 and you'll spend your whole time leveling as shadow
---
Yeah I feel like a huge portion of players are saying they’ll hit 60 within a month and not realizing that’s like 8 hours a day for a month
---
I’m rooting for this guy to actually get the name thex but I doubt it now with the buzz
---
&gt; Is there any reason for me not to go mage
---
Well it’s going to be the most popular class as usual. And most people won’t think more of you because you are doing more dps spamming frostbolt
---
shit, i don't have a core 2 duo
---
Sorry, but what‘s a pog?
---
Try the disc smite spec. You can still 1v1 but you'll be nothing special. But if they dont see you or they focus someone else you can burst them down like crazy.
---
thats been my name since cata stop it fools
---
I think the real comes down to aesthetics and play style.
---
Druid and Paladin are fine healers, but you wont ever outclass a Priest in raw healing ability. Both come with their own other buffs and utilities that are helpful in a raid/dungeon. Both can dps during the leveling process. Both have "free" mount/travel ability. Both will also have a very small population so you'll probably have no trouble getting into raids if you're good at your role.
---
The two real differences will be play-style and the looks.
---
Paladins have basically no ranged attacks. Initiating fights typically involves running right in. You don't pull anything really, you just run right in and smite it's ass into the ground and smack it with auto attacks while popping heals and bubbles right through all their damage. You're a big ball of light and smiting righteousness as you level Ret through to 60 and then swap to healing. You'll be fighting up close almost exclusively. An ancient order focused on healing people and cleansing evil.
---
Druids have a lot of utility abilities that can make fights interesting and you can approach a fight in a few different ways. Animal form fighting, blasting them with nature magic and roots and so on. That also means your weapon is basically just a big stat-stick that you rarely use to attack with once you get a handful of spells. You're exclusively ranged unless in animal form. You can potentially tank in bear form if you spec right for it. You're basically a garden hippie who smokes (not literally) people with the power of love and nature. An ancient order focused on healing the world (nature) and cleansing corruption from the land.

I don't mind cause I *hate* talking on voice so if someone else is always blabbering maybe no one will notice my silence.
---
So basically i should go shadow for lvls or become holy and find a bunch of sugar daddies to lv? Got it.
---
But also, will holy priest be too much then? If i can heal enough as shadow, are the holy heals superfluous in sub60? Basically no point in doing it?

Big pie guy. Cake is too rich.

i have done a few myself, i can send you the "rules" i have if you have an intrest in maybe stealing or combining.

The large majority of players will have never heard of Thex and have no idea there's anything outstanding about the name.
---
boo hoo
---
Okay, there it is. I've never seen that movie, but reading the plot summary I can see the joke Blizzard was trying to make.
---
Sure, some of it does, but the book begins ~70 years before the Dark Portal opens for the first time and ends ~1 year before the Dark Portal opens for the first time. Thus, it is in the correct spot on the timeline.
---
its the exact opposite of a troll shaman named thex!
---
I dont remember much about vanilla but do some research on reputations. Quests give a lot and you dont want to be stuck at lvl 60 with zero rep if it’s needed on certain factions. I plan on playing through the game quite naturally until lvl 35 then strictly farming so i have gold for mount at 40. Depending on how things go, i will farm from 57-60 purely trying to make as much gold as possible unless i have a very good group and i will target dungeons which drop very good gear for my class.
---
How were you planning to kill NPC's to begin with? (wanding, smiting?). A player fundamentally is no different to an 'elite' mob and if you were capable of killing those solo you'd have no trouble with players. 'World PvP' is generally not going to happen when you're 100% hp and full mana with all cooldowns. It's much more likely that you get 'jumped' when you're sitting down to drink. It also begs the question of where you're getting jumped if it's impossible to make use of terrain/NPC's.
---
If you're really that worried, just don't 'level' solo, always make a group with someone else (and if you're running a support/healer spec that should be fairly trivial, very few people reject healers). No-one ever engages if the odds are stacked against them.
---
Imagine you log in and this is your realmlist:
---
* Atal'Dazar
---
* Tol Dagor
---
* Waycrest Manor
---
* Shrine of the Storm
---
* Siege of Boralus
---
* Temple of Sethraliss
---
* The Underrot
---
* Kings' Rest
---
* The MOTHERLODE!!
---
Seeing the previous survey: 49,9% people would go for the horde and 50,1% for the alliance. 
---
How could Blizzard create two factions so equally attractive? I’m fascinated about the exact distribution: how can people select one faction without knowing what are the rest of the people decissions, and yet the distribution remains 50/50?!?! Am I the only one who is tripping with this? Haha
---
Some dude posted about how he was excited and he was gonna make a troll shaman named thex and everyone commented they were gonna make a troll shaman named thex too.
---
Age / Thex / Location?
---
(Sorry, couldn't resist.)
---
Look how fast people get bored of raids today 
---
And today they are much better designed with more difficulty levels to push through, of new content
---
Yea that would be good thanks.
---
On Kel'thuzad we had Xivia, one of the more well known trolls. All he'd do is drop into trade chat and say "Women don't play WoW" and vanish, you'd come back an hour later and /2 would still be swarming like a kicked hornet nest.
---
You mute the raid chat and only unmute those who actually need to speak, like tanks, RL and officers
---
They won't. MTGO and MTG Arena are under the same tag, as is actually paper play. They'll keep Warcraft as one tag, and Blizzard would prefer it that way, too, as it increases cross-talk, and therefore hopefully keeps more people subscribed due to split interest.
---
I think Westfall is a trap if you are trying to get ahead early, Human is the most played alliance race and most humans will go to Westfall by definition. This will lead to more competition for quests and mobs, on top of that there are some quests in Westfall that can easily be choke points due to small amounts of mobs or low drop rates
---
Even well geared you gonna bang your head on the wall farming gold on anything else than a full shadow spec.
---
If you wanna keep your raid healing spec, roll an alt to farm gold with.
---
BRE only got that chance on hit at a very late patch so I doubt you even remember this correctly. Seens like youre talking out of your ass.
---
SORRY
---
Just roll RP-pve with us and flag yourself. I'll happily gank you in STV for that authentic pvp experience :)
---
What are your priorities in Classic? Is it leveling and questing? Dungeons? World PVP? Battlegrounds? Raiding?
---
Start there. Once you rank those, it's much easier to determine a best pick.
---
It was inevitable with how hyped everyone is and what little there is to talk about right now.
---
Bit out of the loop, why’s everyone fascinated with Thex.
---
Have an espresso after dinner you'll have energy to play lol
---
Yea the fact 30-40% of horde are typically undead is a turn off. But I’m going ally lock this time around because it’s less competition
---
Marketing 101 butz they dun advertize reeeeeee
---
damn you’re dumb as shit
---
Boredom
---
The people using this kind of guide are either private server players that have played through 1-60 too many times or dumb retail players that think the game doesn't start until you hit 60.
---
Why on earth does it not take you to darkshore?
---
I think the meme will carry on to the game and live among the ranks of chuck norris jokes and mankrik's wife
---
Older people like to joke around too.
---
Those under 18 are too young to remember Thex anyway
---
Maybe people want to relive 2005 as their annoying, younger self.
---
Yes, it will be like during release.
---
There are those that know the truth from beta testing. And those that read and misinterpret the blue post and think it means 8%.
---
Yep yep. Screw speedruns with 40 people having every buff possible. I'd be more impressed with a guild clearing raids for a challenge with no consumes and doing 20/25 man or something while it's the current raid for the phase.
---
Paladins druids and priests will be good healers and mediocre everything else.  No changes from the 1.12 patch in vanilla.
---
What do you think the chances are of you getting your name?
---
I pretty much want to do all of the above, my only problem is that cloth armor looks bad in my opinion heh
---
I mean, can i kill enemies decently if i smite spam them into oblivion? Cause if i have enough to at least survive the basic lvling experience, i would more than gladly play with other ppl with holy in harder zones. Thanks for the help!
---
Yes. Release will be like release.
---
Yes it will be a good games.

Undergeared tank
---
But then again more dead mobs = less rage from damage taken = less DPS.
---
If you get jumped as a priest in healing spec you are absolutely not f\*\*\*ed. Barring a huge skill/gear differential *most* of the time someone attempts to gank you you should either be able to escape or give em a good fight. The key is not to panic - you gotta survive their open (the ganker will usually be burning their cds on the opener against you to take adv of surprise), stabilize, and then decide whether you're committing your remaining mana pool to starting a kiting run back towards friends/guards OR turning the tables and trying to kill them.
---
Most of the time you'll run because you just won't have the mana after saving yourself to turn the tables - but priests are good at running. Use your renew, shield, dispels, fears, MC, fade to drop agro on added npc mobs if both of you have hit them, mount ASAP when combat drops, etc. - a lot of classes will struggle to catch you and kill you before you've found safety.

&gt; Or is it possible for me to 1v1 them and succeed often?
---
Nope, you are one of if not the best class healers when healing specced. If you could easily win 1v1 there be something big wrong with the class.

The only option you have is gearing up some spell dmg gear and roll some offensive talents (faster smite casts, more dmg etc.)

One Warrior is more than enough, honestly just don't be alone as holy.

&gt;holy heals superfluous sub60?
---
Pretty much yeah, if you get into dungeon farming for preBiS early you can swap to holy in your high 50s and stay there.
---
You'll heal better in holy always, but shadow is perfectly sufficient while leveling and can solo + PvP as well.

Yeah, I know how to CICO and generally am down with intermittent fasting, but not down with keto. I dont like most fatty things other than avocado and bacon and I live on rice (when I'm not trying to normally diet) so I'm trying not to yoyo too bad this time around, just get out in front of the Classic WoW threat of weight gain, haha.
---
The rigidity is determined by the people you play with
---
I was referring to the private server meta of the past few years, in which there would usually be another big private server launching around the points that people would lose interest in the currently most popular one.
---
Obviously people will prefer official servers over private servers, although honestly I wouldn't disregard private servers entirely. There are some routes that Blizzard can take in which you may see a resurgence in the future. For one, I've seen some people around here advocate for keeping the game as it is forever *and* keeping the same servers forever. Evidently these people enjoy the idea of getting full T3 on all classes or something.
---
I can pretty much guarantee you that a sizeable portion of the playerbase would end up just going back to private servers if Blizzard were to go down that route, as many players (myself included) aren't interested in long term play and would rather play on a fresh server and make a name and server history for themselves all over again.
---
I don't think Blizzard is actually insane enough to go down that particular doomsday route, but everyone wants a different future from Classic so the odds are that eventually some people will leave simply because their preferred future wasn't chosen.
---
i bet its gonna go to lock vs hunter, because both have pets and wlock can cast spells, summon infernal and doom guard.
---
I would absolutely play on 50 DKP Minus
---
INVITE TO ASMON LAYER
---
The other players would have to have that addon too so he could get the infornation from them. But it would be very easy to edit said addon to return 0 addons instead of your actual addons
---
go ahead and form your own raid with 5 shadow priests, 3 boomkins, and elemental shaman that do not heal.  I don't care.  But those raiders are not getting invited to this guild's raid night.
---
Burnouts trying to keep their hype alive will turn to literally anything

Not natively, but they could take over a server

Someone in a thread said that there was another thread about what people were going to name their character. The first person to respond said they were gonna make a Shaman names Thex. Every response after was saying they were gonna name their own character Thex. I’m guessing it just spread throughout the whole sub when the people who participated in the original thread made posts themselves joking about it.
---
Of course this could have just been a lie someone made.
---
Nice try, annoying person
---
what are you using an etchasketch? I just got my daughter a laptop for $300 with an i3

I put in the same thing and got "Thex". How strange....

---
Ah, it is in the US. EU doesn't have one.
---
This is perfect, thank you!
---
You forget about Thexx or xThex or xxxTentacion… Thex will be to classic what Legolas was to vanilla.
---
They would need to use the whole name for [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]
---
Yeah, but i mean, if i just run away wont it just kill pvp anyway? Cause theres no fight, no challenge, just escaping. So i dont stand a chance and have to rule out those skirmishes completely?

Priest - If you like to heal, go Priest. If you want to DPS as Shadow then you probably wont get into a lot of raids. Also, everyone and their mother will ask you to heal, and then get annoyed when you tell them you're specced shadow. Half of them will be annoyed but not say anything. The other half will be annoyed and tell you why you should respec into Holy.
---
Mage - You can level as a fire mage, but you will be a frost mage in raids because M.C and B.W.L are almost exclusively immune to fire damage so a fire mage is next to worthless in raids. Frost mages are a lot of fun, easy to level, and they get a lot of nice things like portals, free food and water, and you'll often get tipped for making food/water or portals for other players. Very easy for solo leveling and highly useful in raids and PVP.
---
Warlocks - Basically "dark" mages with pets. Do you like the idea of a Mage but also want a companion animal/pet with you? Free mount at level 40 is pretty nice too. Not as useful as Mages because lack of portals/free food/water. But you'll always have a few slots in a raid for Warlocks to do summonings and other stuff.
---
Personally I'd go Mage or Warlock. Mage if you want to nuke shit to death. Warlock if you want to debuff stuff, have your pet attack, and then nuke it to death.
---
Hey!
---
I've already decided what my main will be but I will be playing it exclusively in a duo and to not outlevel my partner I'm trying to decide on an alt.
---
So I was thinking about a ret Paladin with a bit in holy to be more support orientated (20/0/31) - I will be mainly focused on PvP but still want to be able to heal dungeons if I can't find a group as a DPS.
---
If anyone played "Warhammer: Age of Reckoning", I'm basically aiming to try and make the Paladin play like a Warrior Priest - kind of an offensive support taking the fight to the enemy and being in the thick of it.
---
So my question is, do you guys and gals think it's possible to "emulate" this playstyle with the paladin or will I suffer?
---
Or should I just resign to playing a shaman (30/0/21) and doing something similar but from a distance?
---
Any input would be appreciated.

Exactly why those raids are not main progression raids and fit more into the catchup mechanics raids.  They were still fun, but the main gear people were gunning for came from AQ40, BWL 40, and some accessories from MC or world bosses.  They are very alt friendly raids, which were welcomed when they were finally introduced.
---
For my raid nights you will not come unless you are raid specced.  It is a team effort.  Like if you cannot put on a uniform for the game to be apart of the team, you cannot play on the team.  This is the idea of coming to raid night in the correct talent specialization.  We don't want you coming in wearing ripped blue jeans and timberlands.  I don't want raiders coming in half assing it, when I could have the raid heals and greater fire protection potions going to people that are committed and will stick it out until the end.  Because they wanted to be on the team and in return didn't disrespect the rest of the committed raid members by trying to half ass raid night.
---
I'd pick whatever gender you identify with.
---
I find games more immersive when a character is more similar to me, even if I'm not a magical elf/dwarf.
---
A ton of people hit 60 in vanilla.. why won’t they now?
---
Partner up with other similar guilds. Agree on tanks and a raid leader then random roll the loot. It's the middle ground between being a raiding guild and doing full-on PUG raids.
---
Who knows, eventually you might merge together and become "a real boy."

I had a women that started everything with "hubby is mad because blah blah blah" both on chat and voice. It's all she ever talked about, every fucking day her hubby was mad at something. The landlord hadn't fixed their mailbox, so hubby got mad and fixed it himself. Their dogs barked at the neighbor, hubby got mad. She breathed, hubby got mad. 
---
This went on for so long until another member had enough and made a comment about their hubby having anger issues and she gquit. Everyone had a good laugh after that, I wonder if her gquitting made her hubby get mad...
---
I want to be able to identify what people are wearing. If I could disable transmog locally so I would see everyone in their real gear it would be a fine system but it would make cosmetics sell less so that’s an unacceptable solution for blizzard.
---
On the contrary, I propose Blizzard immortalize the name by making an NPC named Thex. That would be the ultimate homage to OP.
---
Farm UBRS.
---
They are more than free to roll on it :)
---
Just be sure to STOP DOTS when the raid leader says to when you go after Onyxia :)
---
Getting 40 coordinated fast levelers together is impressive on its own. Maybe not as impressive as the record speed run, but still impressive.
---
Probably an RP Server lets be honest.
---
There will be a lot of mages. There wont be nearly as many hunters.
---
But if you are only a 'decent' mage, you probably wont catch a lot of shit.
---
If you are only a 'decent' hunter, you will get a lot of shit from other players.
---
But if you are a top notch Hunter, you'll be a lot more desirable as Mages are a dime a dozen.
---
I assume classic will be 60fps stable
---
Thexiwont, no balls.
---
They melt face in pvp
---
You couldn't even bother to shop an H in there...?
---
Doesn't work in Classic, because you can't use the teleport log out mechanic in dungeons, so you will have a hard time getting out of the dungeon every 12mins. Dogs (slow cash) should work in DMN if they're not nerfed / path finding is identical to Vanilla. I'm rolling a mage alt myself for gold, since I'm expecting to need tens of thousands of it. (flask recipes etc)
---
thex is 100% a boomer meme
---
Rather claim a pvp server as the official rppvp.
---
But we circlejerk at 144fps now.
---
Thex meme is 100x funnier than Drake memes and hasn't been exhausted nearly as much.
---
Thex meme still isn't funny but basement virgins love shitty memes.

If the LEDs are red then you are OK. Red makes stuff go faster.
---
Thex clicked the wrong button.
---
I disagree. I'm going Mage over Warlock due to water/bread and portals.
---
I like both classes aesthetics, playstyle, and general role in raids/dungeons.
---
So it really comes down to: pets and a free(ish) mount at 40, or portals and free food/water and AOE farming?
---
I'm going with a Mage for those reasons alone.
---
This is a complete nonissue, because if your healer has more mana and time, he can just do that dps instead. 
---
At level 20, for example, you make about.... 1 rage per 10 damage you deal and 1 rage per 30 damage you take (the ratio between damage dealt and damage taken is known, the exact rage conversion rate at level 20 is approximate). 
---
So in order to do, say, 60 damage as a warrior (less, really, as you can't rend unlimited targets), you would need to take 180 damage. And that's not raw damage, if you mitigate that you don't get the rage. Your health has to drop by 180. 
---
But to heal 180 damage, a priest is going to need to spend 100+ mana (heal is about 315-320 for 155), and 2-2.5 seconds.
---
A priest can just do more damage than 60 with that sort of resources. A priest could shadow word: pain in less time for less mana and do  more damage.  Or mind blast for 80 damage for 80 mana, in again, less time. 
---
Even beyond that, warriors can just fight more mobs if they want to take more damage. They don't need to fight them in such a way that leaves mobs alive to wail on them. 
---
IF you are killing 1 mob at a time instead of killing 3 mobs in 3 times as much time, just pull 2 extra mobs. now you are taking more damage. 
---
Warriors do not want to take damage. Period. It increases threat on the healer and also just is an inefficient way of spending a healer's mana. If you have too much priest mana and want damage, have the priest go through his damage rotation. Or more likely, just wand stuff and save the mana for an emergency or tough boss.
---
Classic Thex
---
you got so mad for no reason, get a life?
---
Oh I didn't think about the double guild one, good idea thanks!
---
It’s less ideal but can still out damage every other class if played right...
---
Hillsbrad and Kargath as others have said.
---
Pretty well I'm sure. Post exact specs and we can confirm.
---
And KOS all the mind contolled aliens.
---
Smelly shit is a little lowbrow but w/e
---
Becauase if it did someone would say " why on earth does it not take you to Loch Modan"
---
Dont know for the real boy one but yeah good idea!
---
Reserving the name Thex in 12 days is actually the real payoff.
---
Booooo
---
Fuck, I'll be bidding like 3 whole DKP. What means more to you, other raider, 9g or 3 DKP?
---
That's it? That's literally the entire story?
---
Is this sub nothing but twelve year olds? Jesus Christ.
---
Yeah. I meant you could pick either of those three along with skinning. Alt for crafting is also a good idea if you dont mind leveling it a little bit.
---
Best player you mean, no one will be able to stop you, not even other hunters
---
I'm going to try to grab Thex for my (alliance side) bank alt.
---
There are no significant or any game breaking changes. This is a shit post

Someone just uploaded a pie chart showing age groups and implied that they were surprised at how much the Thex meme blew up since only 8 percent of us are younger than 18.
---
They should give users control of which games are in that sidebar. But ofc they wont. Shitty.
---
Why are the mac requirements so damn high?!
---
Rolled a human warlock on Destromath on launch day and the loot-lag was so bad I drowned from looting a Defias in that river in Northshire.
---
I was 18 and attending a local Junior College. Super lazy living in a frat house like setting.
---
12-16 in darkshore has the highest xp/hr and this has been known for a long time
---
Thex, 😍😍😍
---
You're right lets keep this sub focused on what really matters: screeching about layering and asking if Druids are any good. Nobody is allowed to make any more jokes, you heard it here first.
---
I hope you get over whatever the fuck happened to make you this way.
---
DE'ing won't bring much profit, especially DME, because the market will become saturated where you will have to carefully consider and only DE the cheapest vendor priced items. For that (if you really bother), use lvl 1 bank alt.
---
DME aoe farming won't work, because you can't get out of the dungeon like you did in private servers.
---
So what's left is pretty much gathering stuff in the world or duoing with a tank = if you're serious about raiding then roll an alt for farming.
---
Yeah the saccharine backpatting cult of positivity shit typical of reddit is really sickening. Post it on fucking facebook where people as basic as you might enjoy it.
---
I absolutely will not be Thex. I wouldn't live up to the name.
---
They did eventually split OSRS and RS3.
---
Yup, could be worse
---
It took 4 years of fans begging before Twitch finally separated OSRS and RS3.
---
Well the ones who will hit 60 fast will be the hardcore ones but not all the guild will be. Do you mean 2-3 weeks after 60 or 2-3 weeks after launch?
---
I was running 1.12 client on my laptop with 4GB, integrated GPU and I was only using 2GB of RAM.  Not to say that using more isn't a bad thing.  When I threw in a 16GB stick (but more significant was that it enabled dual channel) I got about 20% frame improvement.

Or they donate to the human fund. Bless those kind spirits.

Leveling disc or holy will take longer than shadow for sure but it works fine. Honestly though if I were you (and I'm not but I will be playing priest in classic wow!) I'd level shadow and enjoy the spec through level 57-58 before switching to a healing spec. You can heal every instance up to Sunken Temple no problem and once you hit 60 you'll be deep holy or deep disc for the rest of the game. Shadow is very strong in PvP and more efficient for leveling - my words above were just to encourage you not to be scared of PvP if you aren't shadow - at end game in deep disc or deep holy you're totally capable of bringing the pain in 1v1s and escaping crappy situations. If you're partnered with a warrior go pick some fights and win 2v4-5s no problem against unorganized folks out in the world.

Thoughts on the  name clapmaster?

No.

2 weeks since last blue post on their own forums, less than a month before launch, people find news in updated icons.  Blizzard are really master in communication these days, I guess it makes sense since they had CM and esport people fired.
---
This is why is love it. All I am gonna do for a couple months is play WoW and go to work. I will be saving a lot of money at least.
---
You can't expect socially awkward 35 year olds to know when a meme is dead.  They'll just keep using it cuz they're casuals in wow and in memes.
---
Dungeons are really only good when you have a good group and know what you're doing. For 90% of people you'll be better off solo.
---
more effort = less funny
---
It's like the virgin vs chad memes. The origin of it was funny, and the first wave of them were pretty funny, but now it's rage comic tier because everyone cranks out pretentious duds. They spend an hour perfecting their shitty art but have the humor of a doorknob.

Even though I did a lot of raiding in Vanilla as a warrior, I never knew that until now. Was that common knowledge back then?

Or finally go to sleep lol

Perhaps, the DM to Wetlands skip is pretty well known too I thought. I hope to find a good ally guide that includes darkshore soon
---
You goofed
---
Sure but there’s plenty to do even if you’re not 60. I think classic will do fine.
---
Obviously not?
---
Well yeah people will find out after launch for sure
---
anything that helps me steer clear of redditors
---
I never said Classic won’t do fine nor did I say there’s nothing to do lol

Turn up your SWAG

Good thing I don't want to name any of my toons Thex.

Hmm, i've recently started studying web development and learning javascript, but i'm having a hard time understanding most of the javascript after the return false line, what exactly do you achieve with preventDefault on the keydown Event, and further more what is the square brackets doing at line, i immediately think of an array when i see squarebrackets, is that so that every key press wont overwrite the previous letter that's been written, but instead add to the line? 
---
TLDR, what does all the javascript code that comes after return false; do
---
&gt;saccharine backpatting cult of positivity 
---
Much much better way of putting it. I was afraid the coarse way I expressed the idea wouldn't have gotten my point across in addition to just angering people.
---
If you had a sick group that's had some practice running a cleave or AoE strat - then it's faster. What I imagine many people doing is LFG for an hour, waiting while people dawdle to the instance, then they wipe 3-4 times, rage, quit. That's not faster.
---
If you find a really solid dungeon group, that doesn't mind spamming the instance a couple times - especially to get really good loot that will help you level faster... that's another story. You're already at the instance anyway.
---
avoid smooth surfaces
---
I remember that on Classic beta launch, Sodapoppin got his name stolen and then changed to Chance and later got in contact with the guy who named himself Sodapoppin and told him that if he wanted to get it back he could and immediatly got it back
---
That's probably the best line from any adam sandler film.
---
Warrior is a fucking slog tbf, i've mained one since day one. Theres a reason it took me a year to hit 60 even playing every day after school haha I will say though its so rewarding at 60. I looooooved playing Prot in vanilla.  Felt invincible in BG's and PvE
---
YEAH!!! And don't stop there, they should ban the moderator that had the gall to make the "THEX" flair for the OP THEX. What is thex garbage!?! ANY utterance of the word THEX should be and instant BAN. No thexing alloud to thex while thexing on classic thex subthex. THEX the THEXIN THEXXXXX!

Haha my orc warriors name back vanilla was "Killmenn"
---
Man I wish I had a reliable Duo partner.  
---
My plan about a month ago was a trio of people that were all going to level together and while they both still talk about the group we will make, I am sitting their in discord with them silently coming to the understanding that by day three I'm going to be severely outpacing them already.
---
Haven’t played warhammer but this is what I want too. Supporting but in the thick of it
---
Except your ignoring the context. I was talking about my immersive experience not someone elses. Also if you want to know why warriors are implied to be in all plate, name me one warrior class set that has mail or leather at 60. Try it. I'll wait.
---
Nice THEX bruh!

I believe man and fish can coexist.

Pre-patch, I believe

Thafe Thex

Yeah I would have just posted the speech but the mods have warned me about it lol
---
HAHA this got me - well meme'd my friend
---
I’m a lucky guy :)
---
If you want some advice for leveling a warrior I'd say the best I could give is just that you can never have too much food. Can churn through mobs as a fury warrior once you have some bread to eat in between
---
This sub literally is the drunk uncle
---
shitty jokes and repeating questions with sharing facebook tier memes
---
I could swear that is 3/8, making it tons easier since the belt and wrist is boe.
---
They just changed it from a BFA picture to a generic WoW picture with an iconic boss? Was this not expected as there are basically 2 WoWs now?
---
Thex: Thex
---
normal people: wtf stop already
---
Thex: THEX THEX THEX THEX UR BAD PERSON IF U DONT LIKE THEX
---
so pretty much the exact same requirements for BfA, Shocker
---
Oh yeah you can definitely tank as a bear, just gotta understand what you are getting yourself into. If you are willing to go the extra mile gearing and consumables, and have a guild that works with you, you can tank as bear, but it's not really optimal and if you aren't on top of your game you won't be able to push progression.
---
I think a good setup would be to offtank where possible, but main as a DPS, cats have really good dps in vanilla and you can gear for your tanking at the same time. Then you can main tank previous tiers and run guildies through BRD spamming etc.
---
name one meme native to reddit that is funny
---
maybe dont play a piece of shit game that's unashamedly aimed at children? i mean, there are lawsuits about some sort of dance that the player game can do in that game, that should tell you something about the players
---
I don't think those are comparable. From a business perspective, Blizzard might want to entice Classic players to check out the newest expansion and be exposed to it. 
---
Runescape doesn't sell expansions. So its more akin to MTG, imo. But Blizzard could change their minds.
---
Yep- you’ll get to meet some good tanks, start collecting some pre raid gear and get your healing career started early. Highly recommended.
---
"I'm shit at the game and  I need to pay more money for unfair advantages"
---
I mean, multiboxxing is banned on nearly every private server for a reason. Activision loves your money, though, so they let you pay for advantages.
---
Thith comment... Take my upvote and go!
---
It won't be as easy as proper spec but it'll work.
---
It's not very common to start grinding dungeons at lowlvl, you maybe do one or two of the easy ones like BRD and LBRS while grinding mobs/quest to finish up and those you can heal as shadow, so I wouldn't give it enough thought to respec before 60 unless if you specifically have a group of players to do dungeons with before 60.
---
Easily doable with 4 other paladins who are also on the quest.
---
Didn’t see anything funny in my post. You did start a sentence with the word “Like” so language barrier may be an issue.
---
Yes the people who need the loot the most are the most worthy. Unless you have billys kid brother who plays hunter and you bring him along to fill a spot then he probably isnt getting anything.
---
&gt;I’m working on a similar route that’s 1-60 for leveling 40 characters simultaneously and I thought about sharing it but I figured it would be useful to exactly 0 people hehe
---
enjoy ruining the game for everyone
---
People are scared of streamers, but multiboxers will actually kill Classic.
---
Easy. Id call Savage Gladiator a warrior set :). If you are going to now say its not a warrior set bc it isnt restricted to warriors, I say bullshit look at the stats on set bonus its certainly not for hunters. Look at the aesthetics, its for warriors.
---
You're actually the one failing to prove a point. You *did* move the goal post.
---
And they have. TBC. Which is why you moved the goal post to "recent expansions" without even replying to my comment about it lol. People in this sub are so damn cringe sometimes, like what are you even trying to prove? Bliz has delayed things. Expansions, mechanics. Things.
---
Disc is fine in 1v1. You lose mostly to hunters and warlocks. It would be better to be UD instead of human but its not the end of the world.
---
Other dps specs should be winnable (well if a rogue jumps at you 30% then ofc not, but it would be the same outcome with most classes).
---
However, there are many other things to consider (gear, consumables, the skill level of your enemy).
---
As the great grandchild of Swedes who immigrated to America, its in our blood to love classic wow and be stressed all the time.
---
Classic != Vanilla. Get over it.
---
You sure you found him? I am 37 :) and read my other comments too...
---
BM hunters while leveling just kick my ass - along with everything else others have mentioned. Warlocks, rogues, mages
---
Instead of going shadow + holy, go disc + shadow(shadowweaving). You have lots of offensive power and a viable raiding spec as long as you are the designated SW priest. Or if you can't be that, go PI + holy and it'll work fine.
---
\*identity thex
---
You know, what would be real greatness? If Thex would get his name.
---
Think about this. A meme, just to stay as meme and not cus we take someones name.
---
Though Escape Artist is on a lower cooldown, Dwarves get pseudo-Cloak of Shadows. Since Imp Sprint is a thing for most specs anyway, Dwarf adds something new to the class.
---
You'll be able to run it just like back on 2005. 5 FPS in raids and battlegrounds

I'd take middle school "memes" over this boomer shit.
---
Memes aside I just got a Tartarus and have been  trying it out, what's your setup for classic?
---
It was the OP.
---
Cleaving judgment
---
For shooter and such. Doesn’t really matter for game like wow
---
This is just a guess, but if Classic will be running in a "BfA" engine, with BfA structure at least, it may be possible to erase hearthstone, and just unstruck character, dying, and having to corpse-run to the entrance.  
---
The time spent in corpse should be 2min aprox, didn't counted it tho, so it's just a guess, that would lower the numbers, but shouldn't be that "big deal". Also, if the statement that Pserver values are harder than in Classic, it can be a... way to ensure that you will never hit lockout, and leaving Landslide as a big no-no boss, depending on the timers.
---
Few expansions on you will learn that ogre mound in STV was made on top of N'Zoth's lair and all of these things are [handwaved](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Contents_of_Mosh%27Ogg_Bounty) as being a part of yet another Old God mojo plot.
---
In-game Kurzen initially was campaigning against STV jungle trolls. You stumble on a group of men fed up just enough with him listening to whispering rocks and whatnot.
---
Also, there's [that](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Captain_Conrad).
---
Should I delete my link?
---
Start doing attempts as soon as you have 40 people near 60, like 30 60 and rest 55+ will do, as long as the tank has gear you can clear MC. Read up on the tactics and host guild events on raid times(or any other time people can show) to do attunement or ubrs stuff efficiently if you cannot raid.
---
What is it?
---
Am I the only one not bothered about this test? I mean we'll be playing for keeps in a few weeks anyway... it doesn't seem worth it in the long run. Sure it's all about stressing the servers but other than that I'm not too bothered.

This makes sense because Blizzard is based in Russia so naturally they get the leaks.
---
This is the first time Dunemaul Eu is mentioned here and damn that got me excited !!! MY SERVER
---
what no common I only have like 200 bucks monthly to live for after welfare pays for my house cmon man
---
/s ( but not really)
---
If you don't have 240 you're missing out
---
2018 MacBook Pro checking in. Have intel iris plus 655, I hope I can get 60+ frames on classic settings. Can’t believe I’m saying that in 2019.
---
Can’t wait to get home and get on my heavy PC rig!!
---
Well a certain amount of consumes like elixirs and pots and food is just good manners to me lol. They're relatively inexpensive for the benefit they provide, and that does add up.
---
But the only type of guilds who will be doing full big dick buff stacking are the top ones who should be, and the shit ones who think it'll make up their slack. Normal guilds reside in the gulf between them.
---
What else are we supposed to do waiting for classic?
---
Omegalul dungeon grinding - the ONLY evidence we've seen of it being faster was when 30-40 got unlocked and all the BIS level 30 beta players started at the same time trying to level.
---
Solo questing will be faster- we haven't seen finalized layering... if they do only a few layers - (which the won't because why would layering be implemented in the first place) then dungeon grinding will be quicker if at level 22 you aren't able to quest in a reasonable amount of time.
---
All memes evolve. I'm sure we'll see Alliance Thex, Hunter Thex, Boomkin Thex....
---
Haha, before I scrolled down I thought the joke was someone calling this sub their favourite.
---
Good news everyone!
---
If you look at how much hand holding games do now compared to back then. Even retail tells you exactly what to do with every quest. 
---
I know some people will love the non hand holding of Classic, but I think far more will hate it.
---
As a person who plan to play both I agree.
---
Because MACs are garbage computers.
---
There isn't an equivalent to DoK (or WP I spose) in WoW.  Fuck, they were such a good class.  Started out on Shaman, but holy hell DoK did so much more damage, and really good heals to boot.
---
Retail holy palis are maybe a little bit like WP, since they need to be up close to get value out of their skills, but still, they hit like a wet noodle.
---
Maybe Druid is closest, since they can switch from heals to DPS on the fly.
---
Listen, if you can heal, you're going to be in the thick of it since opponents are going to be gunning for you.
---
Stormreaver EU was known as the Finreaver, full of finns. People used to talk finnish in general chats lol

---
Pish, cake sauce, damn kids and your LUXURY.  In my day, we 20 manned Onyxia week one and we liked it.
---
Note: That is a partial joke, as GL, one week I think after our 2nd rag kill we only had 20 people show up for Onyxia and downed her.
---
&gt;Your in a thread about a leveling guide that does Darkshore, if you didn't notice :)
---
Basically, the Warrior Priest class generated it's healing resource (used to cast healing spells, couldn't cast any heals without it) mainly by doing damage to enemies, some spells even directly healed your friendly target for a % of the damage they did. So, to heal you had to get right in the middle of it all, especially since the class was melee.
---
I think it might be possible with a paladin but mana could be an issue.
---
Yeah, it's not really a good origin story, since Meme creator probably would have preferred his name for himself.
---
Should be fine. Classic dungeons are a complete joke.
---
warlock  / druid
---
It's Like 'Rama-lama-ding-dong' or 'Give Peace a Chance'
---
I'm gonna have to be that guy, but I would suggest to these people who want to pull some 72hrs straight gaming sessions in order to rush lvl 60 and kill Rag in a week to take frequent breaks, stand up, walk around a bit, stretch. Like at least every 2 hours or so, especially if overweight and/or living a mostly sedentary lifestyle. It would be pretty sad to hear that some people died from a pulmonary embolism or some other causes, only because they wanted to be the first to kill Ragnaros.
---
There, health concern rant done, now please enjoy your game when it's out, have fun y'all :)
---
No fun allowed here, please move on
---
Just look on any pserver guild and I swear 25% of them are swedes, even the "NA" guilds.
---
[It’s already on the front page my dude](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cksxgq/final_test_date_and_wow_classic_minimum_system/)
---
But the "CPU Core i7-3615QM" is confusing, because current and classic runs fine for me on this: 1.8 GHz Intel Core i5   
---
So does that mean the i7 requirement is not accurate?
---
I saw the original Blue post in Russian, so unless those crazy Russian hackers are taking time out of there days to post info about Classic WoW my guess would be that it was true but released prematurely.
---
Having fun are we? Not in *MY* subreddit.
---
All depends on if their expectations are realistic... make sure all your friends know that if they played 12 hours a day it is going to take them on average 20 real life days to hit 60.
---
Probably get out the headbands and fingernail polish for starters
---
[This](https://wow.tools/dbc/?dbc=namesreserved&amp;build=1.13.2.31209#search=&amp;page=1) is a list of every name that will not get past the Character Creation screen. Whether you survive a GM report is an entirely different story. Note: the \b is a regex check meaning even if you add characters before or after the restricted string, it won't be allowed. The .* in the middle of a restricted name means any number of characters won't be allowed if it matches the rest of it.

Get off my lawn

I recently found out that there's a discord for coordinating something like this.

Post the specs. I play on a MacBook air.   You might be OK, not sure.
---
Yes please do!
---
It's a lie.  I can play fine on this: 1.8 GHz Intel Core i5
---
You'll be fine.
---
Just have spirit gear.
---
Thrallx won't work, but Xxsaurfang will.
---
boiiii!  i was fucking THERE when they filmed the attack on stormwind and the huge battle in tales of the past 2.  feels good to be part of history!
---
This is actually a pretty good idea, I don't know why I didn't think of that. Now to find one from vanilla that isn't 240p.
---
Those requirements for Mac are completely wrong.  I can play fine on an i5. Both current WoW and classic.
---
All skills, Esc, Tab, Shift, Control on the Tart. 1-12 bound in a 4x3 grid, with 3 buttons on the bottom row for stances/whatever. All movement on the 12 button mouse, with extra shift/ctrl buttons. 
---
Not the sexiest setup, but it works for me. I can’t do the spazzy left-right twitchy pvp thing, but I don’t care.
---
right before people find some last minute "bugs" that make it impossible to kill a boss :P
---
Depends on the hours you put in - it's not challenging just lengthy. I'm taking the launch week plus the day after labor day off and probably will be able to put in 10+ hours a day easy, 60 hours should be plenty to but 40 easily. (Of course depends on layering but well see)

I can admit, I was wrong here is a paragraph in End User License agreement:
---
“You may establish an Account only if: (i) you are a “natural person” and an adult in your country of residence (Corporations, Limited Liability Companies, partnerships and other legal or business entities may not establish an Account); and (ii) you are not an individual specifically prohibited by Blizzard from using the Platform.”

Then again Blizzard will have to prove that whatever individual is multi boxing doesn’t own all the accounts register accounts with just the first name josh with no last name and have them all come off their credit card and get reimbursed..

It's a tauren.

Druids can still tank 5-mans and quite a few raid bosses. DPS is possible, but the skill requirement is so high it's not possible for 99% of the players. (Also druids are super rare in general)
---
Paladins can still tank 5-mans, and fall completely off in raids. And ret is a joke.
---
Priests still suffer in DPS (debuff slot limit).
---
So yes, it's like vanilla, with many of the offspecs being not viable enough to compete, so aren't going to be worthwhile.
---
&gt; these days
---
This is how they've always been.
---
Obviously doesn't excuse it, but I'm used to it by now.
---
He was absolutely fantastic haha - he’s coming back again after launch :)
---
Fuck you. I said I found Wowhead not as good as Thottbot, but didn't discredit it completely. You didn't have to be a fucktard, and treat me like a fucking piece of shit, in your good for fucking nothing answer. You treat people like dogshit.
---
Also, what I said had nothing linking Wowhead and the world first, I only said I was using it to try to look up shit during the world first race. lern2~~play~~read
---
Finally, I was giving examples, and thought I recalled the Jaina example, but wasn't sure. But since you were fucking stupid enough to actually try it yourself, if you search Jaina Proudmoore in WowHead, this is what you get, with no link to any NPC; nothing linking you to any boss table. [https://imgur.com/a/7BfOslm](https://imgur.com/a/7BfOslm)
---
Way less straightforward than Thottbot, where that was actually at a click of a button, and **intuitive**.
---
So fuck you, you don't have to treat people like fucking idiots, just because they might disagree with you, when you might not have even ever used Thottbot. I was trying to be be constructive with the use of examples, which is way more than anyone can ever say about your god awful answer.
---
Smooth.
---
It's there a link to info on the name reserve?
---
Go back to ur cave.
---
Judging from his post history here, and the comments he has made in the thread, seems like blizzard banned him for legit reasons
---
The hell is t-shirt day, and why is there a draenei in your classic ad D:

I'm on mobile can I download this as an add-on?
---
POGGERS!!!
---
You are very wrong, farming gold as a priest is easier as holy than shadow. Priests is one of the better gold farmers in the game.
---
Private server pvp videos exist, just gotta go fish them up.
---
Go look for the major private server name + pvp and I am sure you can find some.
---
Oh come now, it's a refreshing change from all the thex memes
---
I started blue lions, restarted harder difficulty a few months in as black Eagles till I realized I couldn’t recruit Dedue (OP) so now I’ve started again on hard classic as BL. 
---
Highly recommend this game

Had almost forgotten the time when First Aid was actually a useful skill to level.
---
...we should have a Thex parade

I'm assuming that in their mind:
---
Twitch = Bad
---
Socialism = Bad
---
So therefore Twitch = Socialist
---
Raid groups are willing to take just about anything with a good attitude and a solid willingness to prove dedication to the group. However, you will not be a top tier DPS/MT and you will likely be asked to off-heal or dispel bot often. DPS Warriors will also be expected to off-tank when needed, it's just how the 40 man dynamic works.
---
Prot Paladins are the only exception to this, because of their mana limitations they will likely never be used as a tank in the vast majority of raid groups, but they are perfectly viable for 5 mans/UBRS if you don't mind more mana breaks.
---
Fantastic - thanks for the hard work papa
---
THIS IS LIT.
---
(No pun intended)
---
impossible.
---
Something about 19 Twink and FAP appeals to me
---
Here’s all the stories and adventures you can have, then here’s this flashy particle crap .
---
rolling a death knight on release and powering through everything only to have nerfed after I completed the first wing in naxx.  Totally at a loss about to give up and my GM asked if I would roll a paladin and tank for them, Going 1 to 80 was going to be horrid so I declined.  The very next day I get an email from my gm with a game code and 30 day game card and a RAF request,  Entire guild busted out and power levelled me straight to 80 and geared me in less than 2 weeks ready for naxx.  At the end of the expansion there was not a single boss we had not bested.
---
Still play with the GM today
---
I think Morty is judging you on the class/race choice more.
---
I mentioned that in my first reply and that was 12 years ago and was pushed back a year in advance. That doesn’t apply here.
---
Once a release date is announced they have not moved it in over a decade. 
---
Also you say they pushed back expansions. What other one other than tbc was pushed back after a release date was announced?
---
I’d love to see any evidence except tbc of any release being pushed back
---
I’m waiting
---
Your making it seem like tbc launch being pushed back is evidence of them going to push back classic which is just rediculous
---
Thanks Clemont.
---
144hz show off

I'm more of a fan of the HyperTheX series.
---
I don't see how repeating the name is considered "fun"
---
But you do you.
---
Or the lowly blizzard employee didn't secure their forum login and someone made it up to have fun.
---
Not at the moment, might be something I consider doing later, but I'm not sure how to do it in a good way because of the maps/pictures etc
---
100% agree
---
Eh it was a fun thread don’t be a party pooper

Reeeeeee

Okay, anything but a hunter then

That award goes to Mages. Rogues will probably be behind Mages and Warriors in numbers.
---
MILHOUSE ISN'T A MEME IS A MEME

---
O mega lul... risking losing players btw.. hey man are you a real pers? 
---
If anything they want their servers to be able to handle the player load at launch... they don't need to waste money on advertising.
---
I’m taking launch week off, so really mid day Monday through Sunday. I can probably do 14+ hours per day. So half day Monday and Sunday is a total of 84 hours, which is only 34% of 240. I am probably an above average leveler, but we will be rolling a pally and a warrior, so it will be on the slow side because of that. If 44 is the midway point, I expect we will bit around 35 after week one.  After week one, my hours spent per day goes way down to maybe 20/week. So looking at hitting 60 about two months after launch.
---
&gt; I mentioned that in my first reply
---
You know we can see your [first reply](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cknif4/will_wow_classic_be_delayed/evoy36l/), right? lol you're literally just quoting *my* reply to you.
---
god the cringe. You have no way of knowing if Bliz will or won't delay something. Just stop lol
---
It came from a blue post on the EU forums, the post was in russian, the screen cap stickied at the top is a google translate of that page. The original blue post was taken down about 10 minutes after it went up.
---
Lol Jesus guys
---
Mmmm why not use 2 templates and then paste?
---
With 1 is too short imo 
---
But great work! \^\^
---
When your country and it’s population isn’t very big, and other countries are defending you, then you can afford a very generous welfare system.
---
What’s sotc?
---
Relax, we probably have stress test next week and we'll get info then or right before name res.
---
No way I'm gonna sub before release and I'm pretty sure no one is gonna take my shaman name (Thex)
---
Thanks. I browse the subreddit by NEW, and so missed it.
---
Cheers!
---
It's a bad perspective because 90+% of Classic players have no interest in that garbage at all.
---
Imagine never seeing a meme before
---
Really doesnt matter unless you have so much rage you can heroic strike every auto. Which is rarely the case while wearing defensive gear.
---
 Cry all you want, it never will be
---
No it’s not a ploy. It’s likely going to remain a part of the World of Warcraft tab like it is now.
---
wow, if this works that is pretty amazing.
---
That means i can register 3-4 accounts, pay subscription for like 1-2 months (or how long it takes me to level to 60) and then pay for transfer all chars to one account.
---
Nice way to level up multiple lvl 60s.
---
Spec looks good, but isn’t the -0.5 cast time in Holy quite key?
---
You have more viewers under the WoW umbrella
---
Classic will not have its own icon on the Launcher. You will launch the game from the regular WoW tab by choosing Classic from the dropdown.
---
Absolutely, wait list is key. To be honest, if it's early in launch, people will want to jump in just for the chance of loot.
---
Note: the raid lockout is different from now, if someone kills a boss while in your raid, they now share your lockout, so whatever bosses are killed they are locked out for the week. (Unlike now, where it is based on which bosses they get the kill and loot on)
---
I'm not saying from the perspective of what I want in Classic, but in general. 
---
If you dislike retail, I think LFG,LFR Sharding, Crossrealm, are way higher on your list than pet battles. 
---
If they announced tomorrow that pet battles were being taken out of the game. That's not going to persuade you to try retail again. But Sharding/LFG? Thats going to be way more enticing.
---
Lol yeah I will give you that
---
How much you love them and would like to do something together with them?
---
Oh. You're one of those.
---
Because they consider Classic as a server option for World of Warcraft and not a separate game.
---
Grrl u thexy
---
I honestly think it's a breath of fresh air from seeing the same posts over and over. Many made me genuinely laugh.
---
Solution: he is single, and in a different state. I am going to live in his basement for the week.
---
It's part of the same sub, it makes sense for them to be together.
---
Paying between 7th and 26 seem a net loss for me. I'm waiting until 25 or 26 to get my 1 month. My toon name is not at risk
---
it isnt a standalone game, it falls under wow so will be a selectable option under there
---
Booo
---
You mean someone with common sense that knows how to read?
---
&gt;Make a decision that your guild won't be raiding for 6 months - 60s are free to try to do pickup/fill raids for other guilds in the meantime (you will lose some 60s to other guilds if you do this 100%)
---
This is the best way to make sure all your good players leave and join different guilds.
---
You absolutely want to start raiding as soon as possible. Fill the raid up with pugs if you must. Early on during the server, the players hitting 60 will likely be good enough to clear MC anyway, and its potentially a lot of new recruits there as well.
---
*in the voice of herbert*
---
...and?
---
It's a running joke. It's mildly amusing, I'll grant you it's not exactly peak comedy, but it's entertaining enough. I don't know what you expected.
---
oddly enough, my first pc i bought for gaming, wow specifically, was an amd 8750 with a radeon 4850 512mb gpu.
---
How long do you need to plan lol
---
Haha wtf? Yes. There’s no classic icon so that people are tricked into playing retail.
---
It's still the "father spec of Outlaw". And 2 minute cooldowns are actually short compared to many other abilities. Plus everything is much slower, so those 2 minutes will go by faster than you realize.

I am a huge fan of the music though - thats  been nice to get back into. The ghostlands/Wintergrasp/Grizzly Hills/Darkmoon Faire etcetc

Some of the Lesser known NPCs, sure.
---
That's blatantly false.
---
According to the massive survey done over the last couple of days, around 57% of the respondents have played BFA, with upwards of 37% currently having an active subscription.
---
And that's within anti-BFA populations such as this subreddit - for casuals, the numbers might favor BFA even more.
---
In short, everyone loves to claim how much they hate BFA, yet a vast portion are still addicted to it.
---
Keybinds in 2005. This guy's a pro.

I don't see it either :s

---
Exactly it's basically like saying "Hi everyone 
---
We are looking for some like-minded Americans for our World of Warcraft: Classic Guild’s &amp; Community"
---
Man if only we could harness this kind of energy somehow.
---
I leaned more into disc, you could snag that instead. You could also grab silence too, lots of options
---
&gt; I don’t believe this game is being released as a way to have a no changes version of what it was in the past. I believe that the game is being released to be taken in a new direction.
---
What, in any way shape or form, makes you believe that considering everything blizzard has said has been the exact opposite of what you believe?  Honest question.  I understand that's what you WANT it to be, but they have said in every single post regarding this that this is not their plan.
---
kinda true tho
---
I mean +healing gear will always be better for you than +dmg and healing gear, my best suggestion is getting the pvp set (full set requires rank 10 though) it offers great stats for 1v1, lots of stamina and dmg.
---
 **Scandinavia** forged many outstanding pro players
---
It is all possible. Depending on of course, DPS gear and tank gear and DPS and tank skills and your gear and your skills and well it depends on pretty much everything. Also if you told your group members that you are shadow or if you are just letting them think that you are a really crappy healer because you feel ashamed
---
I'm pretty sure that changing icons isn't something twitch can just do by themselves. Blizzard are likely the ones to take the initiative, and they'll definitely have a say in anything that has to visually advertise their IP on a partner's platform.
---
Can you elaborate on this, please?
---
What's your toon name going to be? 😉
---
Explaining how a meme works isn’t how a meme works.
---
chatted with blizzard customer support "Character services will not be available for wow Classic." so doesnt work
---
We arent stressed though. Swedes imo are really calm and collected. Source: Im swedish
---
Most people who code use it.
---
They gave TFT it's own tab, I don't see why they wouldn't make one for Classic. And OSRS is separate now, yes it took them a while, but I think they probably learned that people want them separate and will apply that lesson to WoW.
---
As for Magic, all of those games put together will probably have less than 1/4 of the viewers that Classic alone will, at least at launch.
---
I see what you're doing, you're trying to hog all the thex for yourself.
---
For true nostalgia I'm going to grab my windows 97 PC from the garage running on 256mb of RAM and an i-1 processor. Resubscribing to my local mom and pop dial-up internet. Going with a 756x480 resolution monitor that weighs 90 pounds too and a ballpoint mouse. This will be just like 2004.
---
What? Don’t have anything to say after you realize your wrong?

Makes sense

Debugging the page how were you able to determine the CSS animation was the cause of the issue? I mean it's fairly obvious with it being a highly animated banner at the top of the subreddit, but there's [nothing from the graph there that i could see pointing me to the animation code](https://i.imgur.com/TiwgRkx.png). I'm talking more future case scenarios where it may not be as apparent as to what the cause is.
---
I was already aware of the animation being quite resource intensive, having recently spoken to my co-mod about it, so for the time being I've commented it out over on /r/NieR.
---
"Recommended specs are the same for both [Battle for Azeroth and Classic]"

Finally, the potato memes will fucking stop.

I bought the Logitech G600 right after they finally gave us the Classic release date lmao. I tried to use it but BFA sucks so much ass that I couldn't force myself to play it to see how good the mouse is. In the brief 20 min session or so I played around with it I liked it a lot. I'll give you a better review on August 27th.

If you're not in the US you can create a US starter account and Classic: World of Warcraft will show up in the drop-down menu.

Useless b4 Naxx??
---
Wot? Meme exaggeration for humour purposes I presume, but seems like a weird thing to say.
---
God is in his heaven...
---
Which is good because there will be "smart people" (sorry don't want to get reported for harassment...) that will leave work early or take off next Thursday just for stress test- it's a small amount of people but blizzard can use that unusual time and multiply it very easily for launch.
---
Prot paladins cannot tank in Raids also because of having no hard taunt, no gear itemization etc having a tank relying on a resource like mana and being starved of it was one of the worst class designs I've ever seen. Even Kevin Jordan (Blizzard's lead class design in Vanilla) said that Paladins (Prot &amp; Ret) were his biggest failure out of all the classes in Vanilla lol
---
You win this round.

---
Im going to use the stress test just to finalize my characters appearance and talk in chat really. Playing that close to launch on a character thats going to be deleted. Not worth the grind!

Good luck with that 🤦‍♂️🤣🤣🤣

Yup, just like the one we already had where they had to shut down 3/4 of the servers because they couldn't get enough people interested in them. Allowing another 5 levels would be a very small concession that would give a bit of excitement to get much more interest in this one.
---
Might want to go take a look for yourself, literally right now. You'll see stuff for other games anytime they have something they want to show off.
---
Yeah, the mana limitation make Protadin almost utterly impossible to raid with, I know some people are looking to try it on Classic and I wish them the best of luck, but I cannot ever see this as a viable spec.
---
uuh.. that one guy, who always ..
---
..starts it?
---
I GET that, that is a problem!!!
---
Rank 1 renew is tested to scale at 11% per tick? So a rank 1 renew heals 55% of your hp?
---
That doesn't sound very accurate.. do you have something like frostbolt or fireball at max rank?
---
Listen man you don't have to get so worked up. I never meant to call you dumb or anything.
---
But I will call out your claim for being straight up false: https://i.imgur.com/qtvelgR.gifv (alternatively just click on the first strategy guide and that also has the loot on there.)
---
Really though wowhead is hands down the best database that has ever been made for any game. There is nothing even remotely comparable.
---
Thanks for offering a review in the future, but I'm going to need to have my mouse by August 27th!
---
I wish it was early access rather than just a stress test those final two weeks. Getting some time to jump start some characters to 20 would be wicked.
---
What is it like knowing that you've ruined an entire subreddit?
---
It’s the official 15 year wow anniversary art
---
Spiritual guidance in the holy tree combined with spirit tap should give you a lot of spell power to help with solo questing / farming. All of the alliance raiders will go dwarf priest but those two talents will pair nicely with the night elf star shards.
---
You are literally a black bear :-P

Whored
---
Shit man you throwing down facts!
---
I looked at it for an hour or so after my comment and by reverse engineering it and using some console.logs i got some answer that are pretty similar to what you are describing here :) the only thing i am still confused about is the modulus use... the percentage sign if you will, i understand the function of it, but the line itself confuses me...
---
If you want to you can try n paste in this and see the console logs i used to get some answers etc 
---
const txt = xeht;
---
document.querySelector('input').addEventListener('keydown', (e) =&gt; {
---
  if(e.key.length != 1) return false;
---
  e.preventDefault();
---
  console.log(txt[(txt.length-1)-(e.target.value.length%txt.length)]);
---
  e.target.value += txt[(txt.length-1)-(e.target.value.length%txt.length)];
---
	e.target.scrollLeft = e.target.scrollWidth;
---
});
---
Id be torn between Crossroads and Leeroy
---
How do we know you really wan'ted to be called Thex and not create a cult of Thex?
---
I like the sound of this. As someone who will be starting WoW Classic as a complete newbie I'd appreciate being a part of a group of people who are fun and chill like me.
---
Bingo
---
You *think* it's a problem, and maybe it is to some. But having multiple realms that end up with less than optimal populations or even requiring server mergers down the road is a much worse problem.
---
Regardless, this reality completely eliminates your need for a server list before name reservation.
---
Tl;dr - Thursday, Aug 8 beginning at 11 PDT.
---
They specifically ask everyone to focus their efforts on the first two hours (11-1 PDT) so they can check their measurements and dials and whatnot. Will end at a as-of-yet undisclosed time on Friday the 9th.
---
/r/ShitAmericansSay
---
It’s 3 weeks before release. It’s a stress test. Not a mini-beta.
---
https://www.joanasworld.com/
---
They mean it scales with 11% of your +healing, I think. :)
---
I anoint you the first disciple of the "Church of the Coming of the Soon to Leave Retail Tourists"!
---
I've been using a g600 for a while now and I love it. If you gshift the keys you can bind everything you want. Every rank of every spell, different grenades. Whatever you dream up. You have more binds than you could possible use, and they are really good binds too. I couldn't suggest it more. You are also using your right thumb which usually just sits there :/
---
Ask method when the next world first comes around
---
I think druids have a decent "jack of all trades" spec. But I wholly agree.
---
Why not both?
---
“Doesn’t interest many classes”. 
---
?????
---
AQ gear is the first time various classes actually get decent PvP gear: warlock’s get spell pen (so do mages), warriors get good DPS plate gear, pallies get amazing gear too, shamans get nice elemental gear and not to mention AQ40 has some pretty damn good weapons for most classes too.
---
I also think that the huge world event surround AQ40 and the Scourge invasion for Naxx contributes to the focus on this period in the game. I could elaborate but cba now.
---
You might have to struggle a little on bad pulls and you'll definatly need to drink up more as you'll not be as mana efficient, but as long as you have some healing gear you should be fine. Saying that, most priests have a healing and DPS set anyway, regardless of spec.
---
&gt; So a rank 1 renew heals 55% of your hp?
---
Rank 1 Renew benefits from 11% of your +healing stat per tick, Rank 10 Renew benefits from 20%. Not % of total health or anything, that sounds like BfA type stuff.
---
[Max Rank Frostbolt](https://wow.tools/dbc/?dbc=spelleffect&amp;build=1.13.2.31209#search=25304&amp;page=1), known to scale at 81% of your +spelldam coefficient, datamined to scale at a rate of 0.81 (spell I.D. 25304)
---
Ok we still pretend that the beta wasnt huge marketing?
---
You must have said REALLY bad word...
---
how long levelling takes, and how long it takes to get anywhere
---
oh yeah, bags like you said, the runecloth bag pattern at winterspring is gonna be farmed so hard RIP
---
Wut? 11% means it gets 11% of bonus power, so if you have +1000 healing rank 1 renew would benefit 110+ healing on each tick.
---
Now you're just being argumentative. I have first hand knowledge of it being a problem.
---
It’s probably for firelands time walking lul
---
I hope to see some pop up in Australia
---
Made a human warlock and ran to teldrassil at level 12 to start getting rep with elves cause they had kitties. Helped create an all NElf guild as the only human in it lol. Helped out the other guildies there too, was pretty fun being the only human in teldrassil
---
Not exactly. The post went on to say you could play it with integrated intel graphics on a machine from 2007.
---
10s of thousands of people have been playing on private realms for years.  That is a conservative estimate.  A large population is well aware of all of this.
---
Can't properly respond because he hasn't settled on a point yet. Is it blizz never changed, is it what in the past several years, or is it they haven't changed a large number? Oh well, guy is gettin fired up on thd internet, good fun.
---
they just did an interview with eurogamer... really there is nothing for them to say. Wtf do you want, a day to day update? "yes, still coming as planned, thanks for tuning in". Lol. Go fucking do something.
---
HP I meant healing power my bad.
---
Anyway 11% sounded like a fuckton, but that max rank frostbolt is accurate.
---
This is quite interesting.
---
I want my pretty turquoise dress!
---
Even though I've never played a shaman (mained priest and rogue in vanilla), this is exactly my plan, and for those exact reasons. I wasn't 100% sure about the potential of shamans, but from my knowledge of the game and a little bit of research (and posts and comments like these!), I was looking exactly for what you described: hit like a mage, heal like a paladin, sounds awfully fun at 60 (I mean that in a good way!), having good PvP and PvE prospects! Plus everyone (well, melee) wanting to have *Thex* with you for your WF.
---
I don't know how I'll level yet cuz I haven't even looked at the talent tree yet -- I want to be a virgin (Shaman-wise) till I enter WoW Classic, but getting to try out enhancement for a good part of the leveling sounds like an awesome way to try out that third spec; I'll see what I do at 40. But yeah, being able to heal in raids and hit like a brick in PvP sounds awesome!! Bring it on!!
---
"wooa soften up" the cloud yelled back.
---
The hardest choices require the strongest wills
---
What actually happened was someone was super excited about classic wow (like everyone on this sub) and was posting about being a shaman player and whatnot and said he was gonna name his shaman “Thex” and everyone trolled the comment section with shit saying their gonna make a shaman on every server named “Thex” first so now he’ll have to play as “Thēx”.
---
This is really high quality. Thanks for this.
---
I wouldn't personally bother with ele until 60. Also, leveling without imp. ghostwolf would be hard for me.
---
Cause snus
---
There is a better one. It went level by level with the spell cost. Had it by different colors
---
&gt;Corsair Scimitar Pro
---
I use the Scimitar, the button keypad position is adjustable so i'm sure you will find it comfortable although its quite heavy. Currently i only use it for targeting macros for arena but it would work well for everything.
---
I think people will be caught off guard by how long it actually takes to level to 60. Sure you can do it in a 3-5 days played if you follow a speed leveling guide and stay dead on track, but if you’re just doing your own thing questing and grinding without a guide it will be much closer to 8-10 days.
---
I played shadow pretty much exclusively through vanilla until I swapped to my Druid
---
you’ll want to build a healing set (+healing instead of shadow/spell dmg) and not forget to swap to it. I never had any issues in 5 mans (or 10 mans, back when strat/scholo were 10 and UBRS was 15) 
---
It is entirely viable and speccing shadow does not ruin your ability to heal effectively
---
What matters more than your spec is being a good healer who knows how to downrank, pre-cast heals to anticipate damage, and communicates well with your tank and dps
---

Ganking lowbies doesn’t give honor, mate. That’s not the correct answer.
---
Hahaha there was a guy yelling at people in a thread about it being HIS thread. So that's not even a stretch.
---
Blizzard made sure to give every one of them access but not only that, Blizzard made sure they all had as near a perfect experience as possible. Blizzard was definitely pulling strings behind the scenes to make sure the game went smoothly for them.
---
lvl 20 is like 5% of the game and only about 2% of people in the test at most would get to lvl 20. The point is to make it somewhat interesting instead of the exact same thing we've seen before.    
---
      
---
Obviously it doesn't matter either way, it's just classic Blizzard anti-fun police in action. The vast majority of people will just play to lvl 5 to set up some addons/macros/keybinds, and then log on with 40 mins to go to see the predictable ragnaros in stormwind again.
---
Yeah 11% is a ton, but healers are constantly using healing spells rank 2, 3, 4 and stuff like that anyway because those coefficients are so high and mana-efficient. Once you get like 1,000 +healing you care less about the base level of the heal and more about the coefficients.
---
They really don't. The 0-30-21 spec isn't viable for raiding at all. At best they can dps and tank fairly well as the same spec(there's a different spec for each for minmax but it works still), and you can also heal in flagcarry spec.
---
Thanks! I got one. I dont care what the rest of the sub says when you're not around OP, you're ok in my book.
---
Plebs 48-59 do.
---
you say that but I remember that there were more PST server than EST, or that the queue length encourage people to go on another timezone so that the queue length were smaller at your playtime. Anyway, I'm EST and played on a PST server most of the time. People were PST, CST and EST.
---
Important note, this says the cap is 15 while the leak post said 20.
---
Doing a BFD run with Aussie guildies while Australia playing Croatia during Fifa world cup 2006. We wiped almost every time Aussies scored.
---
sorry I wrote HP instead of +heal.
---
Because Thex memes are clearly on the level of dad jokes. They are next level shit man.
---
We're not going to have queue times or a need for more than one server of any type for each region/timezone thanks to Layering.
---
I've had the g600 for over a year and its awesome.  Particularly for mmos, but it's great for other games too.
---
Its definitely used by warriors but it's not a warrior set. There isn't a warrior set that isn't plate. It's like calling the devilsaur set a hunter set. Yes it's used by hunters but its not thematically their set. Harder than it looks :)
---
You must be loads of fun at parties.
---
It would be pretty hilarious if some dumb overlooked coefficient/proc made ret the highest dps in the game and all the top guilds started stacking 20 ret pallies. The nochanges crowd would have a melt down for sure.
---
Bro did you look at the minimum requirements? Computers from 2007-2009 can run this game. Seems like they just didn't bother to test recommended specs so they just slapped same as BfA.
---
Hey all! I just wanted to say thank you for all the positive feedback from my last Druid video. I'm glad I was able to help those who had questions about them in Classic :) 
---
But i'm back again with another Druid-oriented video! This one will cover some of the key differences between Night Elf/ Tauren (Alliance vs. Horde) in Classic. I'm still on my quest to keep pumping out more druid content for those who are wondering about them!
---
.... Or apparently I might just have to scrap all the content I'm currently working on and just reroll a Shaman... Named Thex. 
---
I... I couldn't resist.
---
Gnomes for sure
---
Fire is fine while levelling, not optimal but fine. For the first two raid tiers you’ll have to respec to frost. 
---
Also if you’re fire in the open world expect to get squished. No barrier, ice block, etc. Means you’re extra squishy.
---
Wait... xeht isnt that bad a name...
---
So close.
---
Great! Still a *lesser* problem.
---
yeah lol he's begun replying multiple times to the same comment because i've decided to just ignore his ignorant rambling. The cringe is real. Just gonna let that lil guy be lol
---
A large reason they didn't get a lot last time was it was it required an active sub, it was months out from release so if people didn't want to play live they wasted 27days of the sub and it was middle of the week so most time would be lost to life.
---
If you look at who is playing in eSports tourneys it becomes pretty obvious the dominant countries. The most popular countries (in no particular order) for DotA and LoL (and other games too, these are just the two biggest eSports competitions right now) are
---
- Finland
---
- China
---
- Sweden
---
- Germany
---
- Russia
---
- The Philippines 
---
- USA
---
- South Korea
---
And to a lesser extent Denmark and Ukraine have pretty solid showings as well. One easy source is the international qualifying teams for 2019: https://liquipedia.net/dota2/The_International/2019
---
Considering the ratio of population to players Sweden and Finland definitely have some very above average representation compared to their populations (~8 million and ~6 million respectively).
---
Part of the reason, of course, is that it’s so dark and cold outside that Scandinavians should naturally come to stay inside and dominate eSports ;). As someone who has lived in Scandinavia through the rough winter I can totally see why.
---
High-level instances haven't been tested yet, but initial testing of low-level instances showed that elite mobs don't hit as hard in Classic at they do on the servers that run the Nostalrius core. This makes sense to me because I had a lot more trouble healing high-level instances on Nostalrius as a Shadow Priest than I remember having in retail vanilla.
---
So I guess the answer is wait and see.
---
Wow, what do you know, there's another stress test.
---
Someone linked it before me, but to give you a perspective, Joane was famous for having the best leveling guide in vanilla. She has come back for classic to update and make sure her guide is appropriate for classic. She has had, though I don't think she still has it, the world record for speed running leveling from 1-60 in vanilla wow, numerous realm first 60s, and was famous for speed running leveling back in the day.
---
Dude, being a gnome-mini bear all the time would actually be awesome...
---
waifu simulator 2019, bought this game without knowing anything about it and have been loving it
---
Isn’t 11AM PDT August 8 = 4am EST August 9th?
---
So the one is AM and the other PM..
---
..got it
---
Option #3 might be that classic overtakes retail if they do aggressively promote it in combination with returning old players.
---
This would lead to the dev team of current retail WoW to be forced to admit that their game sucks and that classic which released 2004 is better than a game 15years in development and refining.
---
They probably do not want to have too many players playing classic overshadowing current WoW.
---
This is purely from a reputation and monetary perspective in which the stocks might take a hit when an old game basically remastered shits all over their curent day products.
---
It's not like TBC killed previous content.  People would just start leveling as they killed Naxx trash for the twentieth time.
---
ew heroics
---
They are called perler beads silly boomer
---
So blizzlike then. They’ll be scrambling to make more servers just like they did back then. Also I think that extremely underestimates the number of players on launch.
---
Oh that makes more sense. Why doesn't it sound accurate? 1,000 is a huge amount of healing gear and 550 healing over 12 seconds is a minute amount of healing for end game.
---
We really have no idea right now because leveling in dungeons is massively different from pservers was. The beta certainly made it look promising with a 4 melee cleave combo + healer or even a caster aoe comp doing big pulls(this was already done for SM cath on pservers) especially since aoe farming is a lot worse in classic than it is on pservers.
---
And yes im saying pservers a lot, it's been the only way to play the game for 14 years and 14 year old memories are very unreliable. 
---
My guild is gonna test it for sure, already got people making groups to start doing it around 30's. If it sucks then we'll adapt but it looks like its worth a try.
---
lol every druid soloed her in TBC.
---
You could just barely eek out kills as feral with ~SSC/hyjal gear. It definitely paid for all of my respec costs through the expansion.
---
&gt;Omegalul 
---
What are you, 12?
---
25 days
---
I just straight translated from swedish! Thanks for the info :&gt;
---
Obviously it'll be premade groups who have practiced these runs &amp; coordinated
---
Äsch, de e ba gammal skåpmat.
---
It doesn't need to estimate the number of players at launch because this amount of servers supports infinite number of players at launch.
---
Better to open up more servers in the future after having definitive launch metrics than to risk having any single server ever have less than the best possible population for as long as possible.
---
What other class could feasibly justify wearing full savage gladiator?
---
Not at all. It has defense and armor in the set bonus and all the stats a warrior wants. 
---
Defense so its not for hunters.
---
Its clearly meant for a melee dps or tank
---
No mana or int so very non-paladin. 
---
 Its called freaking Savage Gladiator.  
---
You got rekt by your own "proof" mate. Thete are sets made with warriors in mind that are not plate. End of story.
---
Thex, or Tex, or TheEx or TheExe or T0x3
---
Pick flowers
---
Most worthy may not always be the case. Several classes share bis in mc. If your guild has a healing problem you might send more gear to healers than dps. It’s what helps us progress not what makes billy show off his epeen by topoing dng meters.
---
A teddy bear
---
It's true though. It's very easy to develop a well-functioning society and keep such a delicate welfare system floating if you can ignore defense entirely and don't have to worry about any aggression.
---
Ever wonder how the U.S and Britain came to be such powerhouses? No aggressive neighbors.
---
Got the Baga Trinity in last week. Borrowed a Tartarus to give it a try this week.
---
I genuinely think the time sink of raiding will actually throw people off. Sure there might be some hardcore guilds out there that adjust to the value changes from Private Servers -&gt; Classic fairly quickly, but with the average raid group? Taking into account consumable farm time, getting everyone organised and moved/summoned, everyone buffed, everyone ready and fresh from the potty....
---
There's a lot of.... slow in the average raid group.
---
Have them make a level 1 character, I think.
---
Cant say im a fan of the minecraft digging noise in the background. Maybe I'm just not musically cultured enough
---
Show them one of drakedogs later videos. They are edited well with solid music. It might be TBC pvp but your pops and brother won’t know the difference. I’d recommend #7 or #8
---
UD mage, PvP only. Prefer to take my time levelling and hit 60 halfway through phase 2, do some dungeons for a bit then start the r10 bg grind in phase 3.
---
Mc will be raided even when naxx comes out. Mc is going to be seen by most. People start dropping off by aq. I think you’re misunderstanding what we mean. You’re showing hunters as being subpar. You need to show for individual raids and not just end of classic or overall combined because it doesn’t work that way.
---
official post says Level cap is 15

boomers found their new meme to spam in barrens chat now that chuck norris jokes are completely dead

Not to go all Ad Hominem, but you watch fucking WWE (the combat sport soap opera for man-children). You calling others immature is sort of like Hitler calling others racially intolerant.
---
Now this, this takes me back, good times.
---
I mean the dude is shitting on our fun for no reason, let us enjoy our memes in peace.
---
I'm gonna test some macros and stuff because I'm bored and might as well do that now but I'm not gonna bother leveling much. Saving that for the real thing
---
Yes, I thought that too but apparently fuck me for daring to suggest it....
---
&gt; Joana 1-40 record part was smashed by more than half a day on the **beta** by some players 
---
Do you think that the WoW Classic beta was a private server?
---
It has nothing to do with confidence. 
---
Ideally every single server would have ~5,000 peak concurrent players even during Phase 6. Obviously that's not going to happen, but ~5,000 peak concurrent players during Phase 2? Sure. 
---
How do we get there? By overloading the server population by a factor of 10 or more during Phase 1 when Layering is active. You can't do that if you release too many servers.
---
It could be as soon as August 28th or even hours after launch that new servers get announced, just as soon as Blizzard has actual launch numbers, but there's absolutely NO reason to launch the game on August 26/27 with more than one server per type per region/language/timezone.
---
The answer is really, really boring. I checked the performance tool and noticed the style recalcs, then some prior experience made me think of animations and transitions. I commented them out one by one. I remembered some other subreddits as being somewhat laggy on my underpowered toy netbook and all of them seemed to have a background-position animation as well.
---
It's weird though. There's a known problem with this kind of animation forcing browsers to recalculate stuff 60 times a second, but I don't get why the one logo image (seemingly?) seems to make this page so much worse. I haven't really been able to reproduce the problem on a blank page so I guess there's more to it than just the logo size. But eh, another comment mentions that the Dev Edition fixed it, so I'm not really motivated to spend more time messing with a seemingly-known performance issue.
---
How did that other guy (u/Hycran) know what you were going to say?!
---
We don't need another TFT shitshow for the servers.
---
This format is gold has me creasing haha
---
Anytime. Sorry if I came off a little harsh. Of course you can level as holy, I'd probably just go shadow if I was you. Or if you wanna optimize a little, you could get 5/5 Spirit Tap, ask your warrior mate not to execute, and see if you can nab last hits with Mind Blast. It'll keep your mana healthy and give you more interesting gameplay options than just following your warrior around.
---
It's a very popular name, it's the John Smith of wow
---
It doesn’t. That’s why it’s funny.
---
Blizzard has better stats than biased hardcore Classic fanbois, sorry.
---
Roccat Aimo yeeeeeeeaaaaahhhh
---
Take your damn upvote, Captain Bandwagon.
---
Next Thex test
---
Yes, but I just joined this sub a few days ago so what's the answer?
---
A hunter during the beta shaved off 10 hours /played at level 40. Since level 40 is not even the middle of the leveling grind if we're going by /played, it's reasonable to expect a hunter to be able to beat Joana's old record by more than 20 hours.
---
Those kind of people tend to get the most loot.
---
Downvote from me.
---
The maximum level during the stress test and minimum specs for Mac were completely wrong.
---
So when are we going to start banning people for this spam?
---
...Classic.
---
Looks solid... One question: How do you actually use this guide? Have 2 monitors, 1 with WoW on it and 1 with the guide?
---
I've just started tagging anyone who makes a thex joke with RES as "thex retard" so that I can avoid interacting with them in the future
---
That seems like a bad time for a stress test. The middle of a day during a weekday?
---
That list seams out of date. Some restricted names are missing.
---
Well, it also had false information.
---
Thex?
---
Yeah for Ninja.
---
It's literally the list from the latest version of the Classic client.

IMHO due to age of those components and how often people are looking for something to play Classic (often ultraportable laptop with 14nm++++++ iGPU that may be weaker than HD 4000) they could also listed modern hardware, especially mobile one.

Not healers! :D

The point isnt to level and you arent testing for bugs.
---
Even if majority of the players with access to the stress test only log on at the start then again at the end when blizzard overload the servers with forced spawning it does the job the test needs.

You are here to put the servers under stress nothing else is expected or asked of you.

You'll still envy them for the gear. I never had the time to but damn did I want that gear. It was so cool when we could get it in the TBC pre patch.

No admiration for the grind, most of them cheated (accountsharing or botting) and it's just a testament that you threw weeks of your life away for prestige, hardly any skill. But damn that gear is sweet. You can bet your ass I'll envy every fucker who gets it for it. The mage set looks so sweet on human females.

No one is defending anyone.. Our soldiers was in the front both in Iraq and in Afghanistan way before any of your pussy soldiers to take care of the shit you couldn’t do yourself to protect your precious resources..
---
We spent as much of our budget on military as many other developed countries.
---
I remember reading a post on the ARK Survival Evolved subreddit about a guy complaining about being unfairly banned... turns out he called some other people pretty much the entire gamut of slurs.  Guy could not wrap his head around why that wasn't okay.
---
What bias? Have you even played both games?
---
I would love for retail to be an mmorpg, if it were I would probably still play it.
---
Sry was just joking..
---
Why don't you go search for it?

---
Not every week 1 rag kill will be world first though, bud.
---
Why are people saying “pog” or “poggers”?
---
Love it
---
You are right, its quite brilliant
---
Hype will last few weeks, general interest will last max until Blizzcon (november 1st). Then retail will get spotlight back. That is common sense and that is how players always behaved and will behave this time too.
---
You’re talking to someone who doesn’t believe the dropoff is going to happen like people think. Its world of warcrack.
---
Seems like a bad time to stress NA servers. Middle of the day on a weekday?
---
Just PUG. Raids in classic are easy. Players are more experienced than ever. You won't have problem if you fill your group with pugs.
---
I think you mean Sweden not Scandinavia. 100% hype letsgo.
---
Yeah, people are so much better now, it's gonna be fun!
---
They honestly dont have to do a thing.
---
Stress test is on aug 8th. Streamers will play it, easy marketing there.
---
After that there is only 2/3 weeks until launch.
---
I guess the point is people want classic so they never have to proceed with more content. By putting expansions into it, you're going around that.
---
Totally agree. MMOs just don't maintain interest long term. Classic will be huge at launch, then probably not back on top until TBC launch.
---

Sounds like a wrestling move.
---
If they love PvP, they now have the best PvP gear for stomping noobs in BGs. They're gonna have tons of fun and I don't think they would care that you look down on them.
---
I totally get what you mean man. It's a hollow victory. I love gaming and even to a certain amount of excess if time permits but R14 is just mentally sick.
---
And still they're gonna have so much fun kicking our asses for it...
---
Thanks!  So this is the quickest path?
---
I will follow this advice and head over at whatever level makes sense for Ashenvale. I appreciate it!

This is so clever, girl.

Well done. Also: I’m actually getting that mouse.
---
I do actually
---
They just did, you got Thexico pvp, Thexican pvp. Thexican't pve, Thexland pve, Thexisia rp.
---
Just off the top of my head:
---
Restructure raiding so it doesn't automatically invalidate old raids the instant a new raid comes out. Bring back the actual progression through raids ala Vanilla and BC. Don't be afraid to withhold content from players. Make epics be epic again.
---
Make the open world dangerous again. Make murlocs mean. Make elites actually scary to fight again. Don't let players AoE down tons of mobs with zero downtime. Don't give every class a ton of self sustain options. Bring back elite quests that require talking with people in the area to complete.
---
Open classes back up to a variety of options. Stop shoe-horning every class to use one armor type. Bring back the talent tree. The talent revamp didn't do shit to stop cookie cutter builds, it only made everyone even more samey than before.
---
Bring back significant class buffs like back in BC. The only reason they homogenized everyone was because shaman were OP in Sunwell due to Bloodlust/heroism which would have been one easy fixed (raid wide with exhaustion debuff). They went way overboard with this. Class buffs were amazing because it incentives people to group together so much in the open world.
---
Make dungeons longer and more labyrinth. No one remembers "the hallway" dungeons, but they sure as hell have memories of running BRD. Make quest-dungeon integration much more in depth instead of "just kill the final baddie for a bunch of xp".
---
Change combat so tank and healer roles matter. Threat management needs to be difficult and healer mana needs to be precious. No more AoE tanking and no more mindless healing spam. Crowd control and planning should matter.
---
Reduce the amount of noise in combat. We don't need 10 procs constantly going off. We don't need mindless AoE and proc spamming going off. Abilities should be a lot more simple and impactful. Events in combat should be significant, easy to notice, and require response.
---
My biggest fear for the health of classic is that blizzard will wait too long between raid tiers to keep people occupied. Especially during the first tier when you will have a massive gap between the hardcores who hit 60 in the first 2-3 weeks and have been farming MC for months and the more casual people who won't hit 60 until December-February.

There's your fucking realm list kids. Now STFU.
---
What was it?
---
People always say that "this subreddit is becoming more and more cancer!"
---
I disagree. This subreddits always been cancer. It's like the official forums: people there have been screaming doom and gloom and about how WoW is dead even back in the Vanilla beta. Its not like the cancer in either place is getting worse, it's always been like this.
---
Never said that, friendo, it's entirely possible that there will be numerous week 1 Rag kills. I personally think that Rag will die within 7-10 days, it's gonna be exciting to watch the race!
---
It’s a Twitch emote referencing PogChamp
---
Thinking MY warrior would wear plate is actually specifically vanilla. I actually played vanilla and my warrior only wore plate. Your striking out hard but its fun to watch.
---
Nope, EST is 3 hours ahead of PST.

---
I haven't been playing much of anything but I have been trying to catch up on movies that I've fallen behind on and a few old ones. I just watched a i artificial intelligence last night and it was surprisingly good
---
Yeah and I never said anything about the world first rag kill yet here we are, buckaroo :)
---
I'm in a similar situation, my intention is to watch /who for server population like a hawk, once there is a critical mass, probably week 2 or 3 I'll be running PUG Ony and MC runs with the other frontrunners from my guild, reserving head from Ony for the guild, and BoEs from trash in MC. with everything else being MS &gt; OS free rolls after that.

I’m naming my Human Warrior - Soupa
---
Are you Joe Biden?

opening battle.net is more taxing than running classic
---
7pm for us Brexit boys
---
There is an almost infinite demand for large brilliant shards as people are always needing enchants for new gear and because they are used to craft oils that caster/healers use as raid consumes. Even if they get as low as 2-3g each your looking at 10 shards minimum an hour.
---
Meanwhile League of Legends and Team Fight Tactics... But i agree with your point. Especially since it's one sub for both. They just want WOW numbers to be big, as they will :)
---
Dafuq you think I'm tryna do here?
---
This is a mostly American site, eu is probably even bigger (not strange considering eu has higher population too).
---
I'm still polling for interest. A friend of mine manages a screen printing warehouse and t-shirts can be readily commissioned if there is genuine interest in enough people.
---
Ah okay thanks
---
Yes the class that is notorious for running out of mana quickly is great at fighting multiple opponents while: getting viper stung, a shaman purging dropping grounding and earth shocking, a priest or pally dispelling pain, literally anything healing - all while your only form of cc is a pbaoe on a 30 sec cd and a dispellable silence on a 45 second cd. Being “the best at 1vX” is about being able to handle anything not just multiple melee dps. Mages, warlocks and rogues with cd’s can all do that, shadow priest can not. All your spells are high cost, dispel cost BASE mana, you are not meant for long fights. The actual game isn’t YouTube videos anything  in rank 14/AQ gear can shit on 3 people in lesser gear.
---
Don't forget Portugal!
---
A Thex meme with effort. /u/literallyablackbear would be proud.
---
Take my upvote Thex you beautiful bastard.
---
Sincerely, Thex.
---
Yeah and germany is a small country that could never attempt to take over the world and invade denmark
---
If you’re too low for wetlands (even if you aren’t) yes. If you’re high enough to not die a bunch of times on the run, I’d do the run. If you’re likely gonna die more than twice, take the path in Dun Morogh.
---
If blizzard gives him the name I wouldn't even be mad
---
&gt; Don't forget that hitting level cap might mean your largest loot bag may very well be a 12 slotter. Lots of running back and forth selling goods while trying to save for that epic mount!
---
That I very much doubt unless the player in question is a super fast rusher. For the overwhelming majority of the players, even those that level fairly fast, there till be runecloth bags available in the AH well before they are level 60. 
---
Saving money by sticking with 12 slots bags is just about the worst decision you can make. You should at least buy 4 runecloth bags. It's very easy to resell them without much loss if you need gold quickly so you are not really losing anything. I would even argue that you should buy 4 traveler's backpack before epic mount. Same thing there. They are easy to resell so can just buy them and when you are like 100 gold away from your mount sell them( usually seem to go for like 25-30 g each if I remember new private server economy correctly).
---
Is classic wow out?
---
The midway point from a /played perspective is around 45, though I'm not experienced enough in speedrunning to know whether there are specific points where people shave more time off Joana's original world record.
---
thanks for checking really appreciate it
---
Sounds fair for the loot attribution, hf mate!
---
Raggy has been my fave looking boss since i first saw him, i even liked his firelands version excluding the legs.
---
But you're still assuming. Without actual data, it's all just assumptions. And well, I'm not an ass. Are you?
---
what is pogchamp?
---
The Seven? Yes, they ploughed through TBC up to Illidan... *post nerfs*. And there's no way to prove that they just had putten on their T3 gear for lulz for that screenshot, while may have actually worn lvl 70 blues and epics. 52 days is a long time to farm/craft gear in TBC that's better than T3.
---
Right american is spending money on military to defend the world, totally
---
&gt; If anything, raiding will be easier in classic simply due to lower population sizes. 
---
There's going to be more non-raiders than raiders as compared to a private server (where everyone's a raider), so mats will be cheaper.
---
No. Non-contested zones work like PvE servers though. It's only in contested zones that you get the free for all PvP.
---
Playing WoW in 5K resolution on mac is gunna be sweet

---
Bag space will be so insanely limited and frustrating to loads of players, me included.
---
they'll probably post the realm list right after the stress test is over
---
I feel personally attacked.

I'm fucking blown away buy people like you OP, you put so much god damn effort into something just for the love of the game.
---
Thanks for doing the hard work for a free product &lt;3
---
Thats a lot of assumptions lol.
---
No they cant hold their own at all. They still bring the buffs when they are specced correctly, so thats a crap argument.
---
The only thing that will drive people away from the guild is forcing the rest of the guild to carry boomkins and retpalas through raids. Because thats the only reason any guild who brings them beat content thats not on farm. Someone else picks up the slack from the memespecs. And thats selfish as fuck.
---
You're new to Vanilla? You pretty much instantly earned a spot in the guild.

I see

Just show them everything you accomplished during the time you played WoW...
---
Interesting. That kind of bums me out. 20 would have been a seriously fun romp for one day. 15 is gettable in a handful of hours. It's barely outside the first fully completed zone.
---
So I really want to play a shaman but im a little scared of the amount of keybindings needed due to all the totems and also the rank 1 shocks and such.
---
I would like to know if some veterans have played high lvl shaman and can compare the amount of keybindings needed to other classes. Im older, slower, and less dexterous now adays, guess I need a mongoose enchant. For comparison I played a mage fairly well to 70 and with a few extra lvl 1 rank spells it was pretty doable.
---
Thanks for the help.
---
Some will, some won't.
---
They know
---
Yes because the US militaey is entirely for defensive purposes. When was the last time the US had to defend an attack on American soil again?
---
Until the hunters start rolling need anyway...
---
Shaman are the best raid damage (group) healers in Classic.
---
The horrific vanilla rank grind is going to destroy lives and make people beg for a TBC/WotLK-style PvP reward system.
---
Leveled and Pvp'd to 60 in Vanilla wow th h a Prot warrior. Not recommended :)
---
No, reddit is the perfect place for a guy like him.
---
Some naxx stuff will be very hard on the healers and tanks especially, but there isn't really any dps checks that a prebis comp can do with some world buffs
---
BC dungeons are mostly remembered for their crazy heroic difficulty. That's another thing I would also love but it kind of exists in retail with the Mythic+ system.
---
World quests I just don't think they're necessary. In a fully fitted out expansion like vanilla or BC there was just not much filler time left. World quests are mostly just there to pad out the length of open world content.
---
decent? They are sick
---
how long do you think it'll take to get to lvl 20?
---
TY
---
Just level an alt with them. Some class that you’ve always wanted to try but not main (it’ll be fun to level with your friends no matter what) and your main class will be what you play alone.
---
Since they fixes chain heal?
---
Having them ahead of time lets things like unofficial servers form, e.g. unofficial late night servers, unofficial specific language servers, unofficial regional servers, etc.

Supposedly it is professional equipment with 270 degree rotation or something.

Pro equipment isusually marked up a fair bit, though not as much as the average Apple product.

weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeell, I can only speak for Pservers so might not work ofc. But I'm sure as hell gonna test.

That was purely for the threat on the proc though, and they hotfixed removed the threat from the weapon around the time black temple dropped if I recall.
---
I never played vanilla. Eli5 reserving righteous orbs.
---
Thanks I hate it.
---
Most R14's I found played a lot less after they made rank. Or just quit outright.
---
The point of rushing to 60 is to breath the rare air and establish yourself among the peers that breath it with you- plan to merge. So two or three guilds worth of raiders form a second string as their stragglers trickle in? No big deal. This is all fair weather talk, taking a week off of work to play wow is going to be [traumatic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SKdN1xQBjk). Plan to merge.
---
People should be making check lists for pre-bis /unique/useful quest rewards they can knock out from quests/dungeons/pvp and working those on their way. 60 is incidental. Identify recipes that have specific area's/reps to farm and weave that into your progress. Gold is a big grind as well. People not yet ready to raid can stock the raid and stock the market.
---
The fix was in Vanilla.
---
It honestly looks much better and i plan on playing both.
---
More or less never, which proves my point. Without any invaders on their own soil they could spend time developing the rest of their society.
---
Which is why the U.S is a super-power today.
---
Mate, sorry to break it you but you are reading it wrong. That shaman figure is being represented across total population. You need to divide the shaman number by the horde population only. On average (because horde/alliance is normally 1:1), you can safely double the shaman %
---
Solo farming and is arguably worth putting more points into than holy for healing.
---
They combined them all during WoD because World of Warcraft is going to be considered World of Warcraft. It's up to Blizzard to change it not twitch.
---
I expect to see the names drop after the end of the stress test on Friday the 9th.
---
Nah, I'd rather see them never introduce flying again. I'd be fine with recreating the story and talent changes but they'd have to redesign the world for no flying.
---
Also WotlK had some terrible design choices. The story was mighty fine but the content very questionably balanced. The destruction of Naxx as one of the hardest raids ever by reintroducing it in a parodistic version of it self that turned the difficulty it was reknowned for into an ironic joke by making it the easiest raid in the game ever was a tragedy. The dungeons and heroics were a joke.
---
I don't wanna bash your love for WotlK, you'll have your reasons. But I wouldn't want any association of it with classic other than the fact that they are both "older expansion" projects. The egoistical side of me doesn't care about it at all. I have classic and it's all I'll ever need. TBC could be fun but to me personally Wrath was the first real nail in the coffin of WoW for me, even if even TBC introduced a few VERY detrimental things (it did some others much better than classic - I wish TBC had no flying and a nicer setting).
---
I’m sorry this is actually tragic. The fact Classic doesn’t have its own community on twitch is a problem imo.
---
&gt; No one really cares about bare minimum specs
---
lolwat
---
People have been asking for it for years :(
---
zebra has a point
---
It is like they are hiding Classic
---
&gt;BC dungeons are mostly remembered for their crazy heroic difficulty. That's another thing I would also love but it kind of exists in retail with the Mythic+ system.
---
Right, so you can have really memorable dungeons even if you go for a linear design through either cool set pieces (dead mines) or mob design.
---
&gt;World quests I just don't think they're necessary. In a fully fitted out expansion like vanilla or BC there was just not much filler time left. World quests are mostly just there to pad out the length of open world content.
---
I mean, we could destroy a ton of stuff in Classic if the pursuit is to destroy whatever is "unnecessary". Like pet battles, its a reason to get people out in the world, so I'm all for them. Especially in the modern era where the community is so instanced-focused. 
---
 Same reason why the Daily Heroic stuff was good in TBC/Wrath.
---
You can try sneaking in some RFC, DM, and WC.  With some lucky drops you might be able to make some attempts on finishing 'em all and SFK's first boss!
---
Honestly I think bottom line will be wether they are still making decent amounts of money with the subscriptions. IMO the only reason we are getting classic is because recent expansions bombed so hard and the sub count plummeted and they’re gonna test the waters so to speak.
---
&gt; Get it by Tue, Oct 8 with express shipping
---
&gt; Get it from Wed, Oct 9 - Mon, Oct 14 with free standard shipping
---
&gt; No, they said they aren't ready to talk about it. Which means they are talking about it.
---
To be fair, it very well could mean (and probably does mean) that *they* haven't even explored what "post classic" looks like.
---
Yes, partway through.
---
I was getting 55-60fps on medium settings on 9 year old hardware during the last stress test. That was just while out questing, it was more like 40 in SW. You're being over dramatic.
---
+3% hit talent is no laughing matter.
---
Ah shit, there’s no flight path in rebel camp?
---
I might just have to go horde...

The hype is real

Gonna disagree with you on that one, it was way more than 1 in 5 and it took off on its own accord. I don't know why people are saying it's a forced meme, it seems as natural as any other. Also the complaint of it being a repetitive meme is weird too. Memes are by definition repetitive
---
Evangelion reference, I see you are a man of culture as well

Aw man

We are all manchildren here.
---
Worse case scenario can try a middleman like joy-2-key.
---
You are totally entitled to define your role in this role playing game. You want to only wear plate, all the power to you. But thats moving the goal posts. You tried to argue that warriors are meant to or should only wear plate in this game.
---
"No barbarians here and the warriors where plate. Not sure what game your referring to but this is classic WoW subreddit."
---
This isnt talking about YOUR warrior. This is clearly suggesting that in Classic WoW, all warriors should  wear plate.
---
I take you changing your argument as acceptance that you lost the prior argument . The one you tried to justify by falsely claiming that all gear that is meant for warrs is plate.
---
30k viewers and 20k are one guy lmao
---
Druids that play as feral only are doing their class a huge disservice. We are hugely synergistic across all our talent trees and moving between forms is necessary. You only get the mana cost when moving into your form. You normally start as cat for that pounce, get a rip off, shift out when they instinctively frost nova. Dot them up with moonfire and maybe insect swarm if you have it, maybe a quick starfire if you have time, get out of their range in cat form. Rinse and repeat if you want

I’m going to go out on a limb and say you are completely correct.
---
It is wrong....for example it tells you to get Omnicast Boost (which have 8 less spellpower than the bis boots), it tells you to get green lens as bis (you can get 5 SP more on a green helm), and it tells you to get bonecreeper stylus as your wand but you want a green one yet again...

Yea well but that's not contradicting my point at all. In fact that's exactly my point. 
---
I'm fairly certain when they originally announced it their stance was a firm "it's gonna be a preservation and that means barring maybe fixing gamebreaking bugs there won't be any further development on the project". And this is, as is implied by the part you pointed out in the end, a slither of hope that they are reconsidering the firmness of that statement.
---
They seem to have gone from "we'll give it to you so you shut up, after that that's it" to "Hey this is really popular and the fans are way more passionate than we expected. ***Maybe*** we should see how it goes and be open to putting further ressources into this."

I suppose you're right but fuck, it's exhausting.

Most classes level 10 and 20 quests are zone specific. I ran into this on pservers and tested on beta - a dwarf priest cannot pick up level 10 quests anywhere but kharanos. I'm not saying this is so important that you shouldn't level where you want.

Wait a minute.  I'm looking at the map and Dun Morogh and Ashenvale aren't even on the same continent.

What's my plan chief?  I level in Dun Morogh until 20 or so and then somehow make my way across the ol narrow sea?
