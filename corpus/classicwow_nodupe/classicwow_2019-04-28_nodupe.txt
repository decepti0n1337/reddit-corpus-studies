The real vanilla wow experience is having 15 warriors in raid who each have 3 taunts and the raid wipes because nobody taunted.
---
---
---
Don't be so sure about that. The #nochanges guys are incoming
---
Thanks for the explanation! 
---

---
Would be cool to crowd source this data with a wowhead-like addon, not just for flight paths, but for median time taken to run to a dungeon from nearest FPs as well, so you can give your group a reliable ETA :D
---
But even as it is, it's gonna be crazy useful once classic launches
---
I just want a RPPvP server.
---
This is a good thing... better rewards == more people want to pvp == more pvp.
---
What people forget is that the honor system will only come out in phase 2 and BGs in phase 3. Depending on the length of time between phases (it will almost certainly be different between each phase) the gap may be less than you think.
---
femdwarf is 100% more flex, mostly bc of how horrid their faces look.
---
exactly why blizzard is fucktardedly stupid for not having one at release of classic. they cant possibly be THIS brain dead
---
Which slot are gnomes best in? Can I equip one as an offhand?
---
The backdrop and scenery of stv is actually just rogues stacked up to create an illusion of a jungle

At original launch it was more around the 15-20 days /played on average. Or at least all the people I knew were around there. Think my first character took ~18.
---
I’ve had copyrighted gaming stuff before. They probably don’t care or know better if it’s not something super well known or obvious
---
*Checking https://wowclassiccountdown.com every hour*
---
private servers are 90% european, private servers are toxic as fuck, it must be the americans 
---
the single best thing about classic is we won't have to deal with the euros anymore
---
I love the pvp = toxic delusion
---
i want classic, but i also want BC and or WotLK, fight me
---
Is it really a dog whistle when it’s blaring like a foghorn?
---
I’m leaning towards Human Priest. I know I miss out on Fear Ward but who gives a fuck? I’m not going to raid hardcore and push progression. Plus no one on Horde gets it so w/e. I’ll be healing to start but then I definitely want to build a Shadow set.
---
But Rogues are so much fun to dick around with...
---
Just say blacks, poc or people of color is just a fancier way of saying colored people.
---
If you like south park watch the Make love not Warcraft episode it’s pretty funny
---
Do you know in which patch the dungeons were retuned/had their player limit capped lower? I thought it was near the release of TBC but I'm having trouble finding it in 1.12 or any of the patch notes from the time.
---
ive said this before but i encountered a ton of toxicity on the demo from non-pserver players who still believed dumb shit like paladins only exist to buff, priests are the only real healers, tauren is the best race for warriors etc. i was a druid and i kept getting whispers to "play a real class" from complete randos - people i wasnt even interacting with, lol. it was pretty shitty.
---
in my experience pserver players are more accepting of new shit because we've had years to experiment and figure stuff out. the meta has changed. paladins are some of the best healers, warriors are tanking as dual wield fury, druids are often prefered as 5man tanks etc, TROLL is now considered the best warrior race lmao. ive been on pservers for years and never experienced toxicity like i did on the demo lol.
---
straight up, expect to be denied group invites if you try to tank as a druid or heal as a paladin or whatever. people with no fucking clue are gonna jump on classic and start enforcing this ancient stigma and its gonna be toxic as hell.
---
This is genuinely the most disappointing news I've seen from classic thus far. I'd like to play at launch, but if they are postponing RP-PVP servers, I guess I'll just have to wait.
---
True. You right.
---
Ignoring the point I made doesn't refute it
---
That’s fucking amazing I’m jealous.
---
Would love to be gaming with my pops and future son. Props to your dad pulling it off in his 70s I don’t think I’ve seen a gamer that old
---
And his username didn’t?
---
Oh I pm’d you cuz op had deleted the post lol
---
But yeah r/wow mods have been nothing but friendly (in my experience.). 
---
Its just the users of that sub that seem to have a tendency to pick fights and report you over almost nothing. 
---
But then again, that’s just the internet in general. And spirits aren’t high when the game we love is in it’s current state.
---
it's actually really tough to refute something that's self evident, it's like you're either capable of thinking about it or you're not
---
instanced pve is not meaningfully different from instanced pvp, you have no point 
---
would this make you feel better? in pvp theres an entire world you can do instead hurrdurr
---
Are racial slurs a bannable offense on blizzard servers?  I sincerely hope they are
---
I ment right now in retail and back in Vanilla. Even if Classic is free apart from subscription you'd most likely still rather play in your own region if you currently have a retail account there.
---
Edit: or just use whatever you want Im not the word police /shrug
---
The way I've generally seen them refer to themselves is people of color, so I'm gonna air on the side of caution and use that instead. Just calling them "the blacks" seems like it could be taken as dehumanizing, so I'd really rather not.
---
You don't have to be offended to identify blatant racism.
---
Or dumber.
---
Well, I'm not really old. I'm turning 33. Was 18 years old when I first started playing Wow when it launched. Bought the collectors edition with pay from my first job. Little did I know I'd be paying for it with every subsequent job since. 
---
What sparked me to reply to this thread was an old, dear friend I had in vanilla. We were in a guild on Deathwing Horde called Forsaken Spirits. Guy was 65 at the time, and paralyzed from the waist down after an accident a few years prior. I got to know him really well as we quested through the game, doing dungeons, psuedo-raids like UBRS. We weren't a raiding guild, but we had fun. He confided in me one time, that the reason he loved this game so much was how his character could run around and his favorite skill was charge. Honestly I couldn't really understand the depth of what he was telling me at that moment. I mean sure, it's a pretty meaningful thing to say and I was happy for him, but when I look back to it it *truly* warms my heart that this old guy found such solace and joy in such a mundane thing and I got to experience it with him. 
---
I lost touch with him sometime mid-BC. I hope he's still doing well.
---
Lol whoops, I meant videos OF classic that weren't tailored to hardcore fans
---
Do you not like to build credit?
---
Awesome find! I'd use it with a grain of salt though. For example, it doesn't seem to include the Sapphiron Drape from Onyxia which, according to comments on classic.wowhead.com, was dropping during 1.2.1.
---
Redoubt is good when aoe tanking. Many attacks means you will get crit, and you can block a good portion of the individual attacks.
---
Everquest started doing 'classic' a long time ago and now releases time-locked progression servers every year which is the main thing keeping the game going (20 years this year). Expansions unlock after a defined time (some when voted by the servers players). Many players reroll every year to experience classic, new server nostalgia - even after doing it 3-4 times.
---
You can bet your ass there will be progression servers in the future for WoW and people will reroll to play classic, TBC and other expansions many times over. It will likely be a new server that locks at TBC or one that would eventually catch up with live depending on what generates the most interest (and therefore $$).
---
I hope they fix this.  IIRC hearthstone had different prices for packs in countries other than the US.  Would be nice to have everyone be able to play for a reasonable price.
---
If it's self-evident, then it should be even easier to refute it
---
But no, in pvp there's not "an entire world you can do instead"
---
That's the definition of being instanced.. it's separate.
---
So then you're left with world pvp which doesn't have any objective-based and has no dependable avenue to pursue it.. and even then 99% of the time it's going to involve less than 5 people
---
You're likely right about this, I think the playerbase will be much more mature as a whole and the culture will be much more mature as well. I know I have become a much different person now. I can't even really see myself doing much ganking now despite pvp being the biggest reason I used to play this game. I just kind of want to level up, and help out lowbies with free crafted weapons, bags, gold, etc. Most of the PvP I'll be doing is probably counter ganking and BGs.
---
You start off saying you understand the economy issue then show you dont for 4 paragraphs.
---
I flat out just don’t see it. Surely not enough to put it on a list. The hate for pservers is strong and this guy sounds like a weenie.
---
we were pioneers
---
12 shades? I could've sworn there were 50...
---
But, do centaur babies suckle the human tits or the horse ones?  Just asking the real questions over here.
---
Shitpost
---
That's happiness right there
---
It doesn't
---
https://www.wow-auctionhouse.com/ you can check pserver prices here
---
So then why change the content to cater to people who don't 'give a rats ass' about it?
---
Every item obtainable in Classic will be in its final 1.12 state. This has been hinted many times and now confirmed.
---
Ya I tried the water running from a different spot and it worked this go.
---
I read that in Magni Bronzebeards' voice
---
47 next month. Played a warrior on a pvp server. Can’t wait for classic to come out, this time not rolling a warrior though, maybe a Druid.
---
&gt;But no, in pvp there's not "an entire world you can do instead"
---
there literally is, world pvp is everywhere 
---
or do you think dungeons are open world or something? I can't even comprehend what point you think you're making here. 
---
&gt;So then you're left with world pvp which doesn't have any objective-based and has no dependable avenue to pursue it.. and even then 99% of the time it's going to involve less than 5 people
---
spoiler alert: you aren't doing meaningful 5 man content in the open world either
---
the more you try to argue for your point the less convinced I am that you've ever played vanilla
---
Yea a lot of those level 60's blues are really good. Shouldn't take more than a month to hit rank 10 either.
---
It's smart to use a credit card to pay for as much as possible for the cashback and pay it off before any interest accumulates. Using a credit card doesn't mean you don't actually have the money.
---
Only if you're on a date with someone who isn't interested in the same stuff you are.
---
Only the ashenvale tileset I prefer BFA. All the others just look like the colors have been turned down a bit and it looks a bit more bland, in particular the barrens/stormwind/elywn forest areas look much worse in BFA.  
---
Having a few more polygons in models really makes no difference at all to me, i notice the style changes much more than the actual detail. I'm pretty split on which animations/models i prefer stylistically. To me it would feel a bit weird having the BFA models/animations in Classic but I don't care if it's a toggle and if people prefer to play that way.
---
That didn't take long.
---
The Blizzcon announcement video + the rewind cinematic gets me more hype than any other video.  
---
After that, probably Stormx/Perplexity/Monkeynews/Goth/Finalflash PVP videos. Best production quality I've ever seen in PVP videos.
---
Only spells you really need are the dot, pet hot, res, feed pet and speed..that's it.
---
Yeah good catch I missed those because I was filtering by actual gear.
---
I play through euro prime time and you can literally feel when they start to log on.
---
have you BEEN to the barrens? the chat is literally /pol/
---
1.6 is when scholo and strat were made into 5 mans, so the BWL patch. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I think people started doing UBRS as a 10m over time as skill and gear got better? I looked through the patch notes and didnt see a nerf to UBRS till very late, and it looked to be the deletion of a few packs not the retuning of the dungeon.
---
You’re infinitely more annoying than the imaginary person who would be offended by the name of this item
---
I agree, the difference is immense, and quite relieving.
---
They all need [Nicker] skin.
---
Innervate will be baseline, but moonkins still have problems, like running out of mana quickly and tier gear is optimized for healing. 
---
Here is a good video on it: https://youtu.be/RevirDl5oAU from a guy that played a moonkin. 
---
Also you’re Literally just spamming starfire. You might want to think about playing a mage. It’s very similar game play wise and more powerful. Just some food for thought, play what you want. 
---
It might be harder, but you’ll find a guild that will take you to raids if you can show up, know the fights and are easy going. 40 people is a lot of people. 
---
Moonkins do bring a unique spell crit buff to the group for other casters. I would encourage you to go herb/alch too and bring potions and elixirs to raids to boost your dps.
---
Yup I agree there! So many choices and so little time! I think I’ll do what I did back in the day, rogue to 60, join a good guild, make priest alt and power lvl.
---
Some items/abilities are just known as "not allowed" in duels, LoH is usually one of them, but depends on the server I suppose. It's situational really.
---
Fair enough. Thanks.
---
I remember those. I wanted the troll one so bad!
---
Final boss of WoW
---
lol are we still hating things that are popular, Fortnite is in the history books.
---
s. plural.
---
BFA graphics does look pretty nice and smooth, not gonna lie. However classic graphics gives me the nostalgic feel so I think I'd prefer that - at least to begin with.
---
Found it.
---
&gt; **High-Level Instance Changes**
---
&gt; Along with the new Armor Sets, the high-level 5-10 man dungeons have received some changes regarding loot. Many items have been improved in quality and use. In addition, several epic items, such as Headmaster's Charge and the Runeblade of Baron Rivendare, have had their drop rates significantly increased. **In order to preserve the challenge of these dungeons, they have had their instance caps lowered. Stratholme, Scholomance, and Blackrock Depths now allow a maximum of five players inside, and Blackrock Spire allows a maximum of ten.**
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.10.0
---
I've been Horde for a long time in retail and I just miss Stormwind/Ironforge so I'm going Ally on Classic for a change of scenery.
---
Innervate became a base ability in 1.11, trained at lvl 40, instead of the 31th talent of the resto tree.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHHAHAHAHAA
---
BOooooooooo
---
I think the most ironic thing about the graphics debate is that if Vanilla had the graphics of today in, people would still have loved the game. 
---
They contribute to such a SMALL portion of the game that were simply a result of their time. I couldn't care lass how much they change the graphics, as long as gameplay is good!
---
&gt; We're all adults
---
are we, mister SS, nazi corps, 14 words, heil hitler?
---
watch [What Made Leveling In Vanilla WoW So Great? by hamsterwheel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OBK8k_B3Lc) his selling you vanilla gameplay :). the first video i'd reccomend.
---
rather than that, for me, vurtne 3 traverses the best the vanilla atmosphere at least when it comes to what it meant to pvp, it has everything wpvp in all iconic zones, world boss fights, bgs, duels. but its pvp video so not sure your wife would appreciate it :D.
---
gotcha by 3 minutes!
---
PServers are usually people shitting on the USA lol, not so much racism honestly.
---
I’d like to see them release TBC and WotLK as well as I believe both expansions to be better than vanilla.  And I’d play Cata and MoP if it went that far as well, but could take them or leave them.  Wouldn’t touch WoD or anything beyond that tho.
---
I bet you only roll dps characters
---
My 1st char hunter took 14d
---
My 2nd char priest took 13d
---
My 3rd char warrior took 11d 
---
My 4th char paladin took 13d
---
My 5th char hunter took 9d
---
You will probably take 13d played if it's your 1st time through. 
---
13x24/40 =7.8 weeks
---
Now read again in Nick Cages' voice
---
Literally no?
---
When it comes to melee DPS, I'd rather take an Enhance Shaman and have WF totem.
---
The reduced cast time and mana cost to the main healing spells, yeah I can see that being a big boost. But from what I can see it isn't a huge difference, maybe I am missing something. The paladin buff duration is not game breaking, as most boss fights don't last over 5 mins. It's rather a question of convenience in my eyes.
---
Anyhows, these are the same system that most undocumented server are based on? Like nerfed version of Molten Core and talent system changes eqaul to what Classic is gonna be running?
---
I wasted a couple minutes arguing with my friend that you can't name a chicken "Nugget"...
---
I haven't decided yet, but I will PM you when they are ready for sale.
---
I don't play horde side really so sure.
---
This is another layer of learning the class though. It's not knowing less about how the class works, it's knowing more.
---
I would cry if i was first in Thunder Bluff with the music on
---
I’m laughing out loud in a taxi looking at this
---
Since when is the South Park episode tailored to hardcore fans? If anything it’s tailored to people who’ve never played the game, due to all the inaccuracies.
---
Servers for Oceanic.
---
No, it’s for a dps warrior in a dungeon when the actual tank fails to keep aoe aggro....mob running at healer and you mocking blow it.
---
Also if you’re gonna wipe and only have 2-3 people left alive, you’d rather it on you as a warrior then a priest or something
---
I don't hate private servers, I played on Nost and really enjoyed it. Nonetheless, barrens chat and trade chat were rather disgusting. There was so much racism and other unnecessary hatred. Maybe it's different on other pservers though.
---
Lol! If you look closely most of wow is compiled of the rogue asset
---
IF SOMEONE HAS ONE POST A PHOTO
---
The people I know who use exclusively credit cards are a hell of a lot richer than those who don’t in my experience. No point in pissing away free travel rewards
---
undead dance will live on forever, metal will never die! 🤘
---
I'm gonna have to agree with /u/TMblackflag. It's not as bad as people make it out to be. I got to 60 and did some mild end game stuff on a private server. I've seen nasty people sure, but not as much as you make it sound. I've even found some really cool people on those servers. It could be the server I'm on or the times I'm online, but the hate/racism hasn't been my general experience.
---
Yes,
---
Also, he is grinding and assuming gold per hour with gear that is way far beyond what most warriors will have until Phase 3.
---
These numbers are pretty damn far off what most players will actually see in reality come classic.
---
As many other people stated, this is bad logic. Had over my CS over 800 before I was 23, always use your credit card and pay it off before interest hits. Not only does it build credit, but if you have a good card you’ll get cash back. Pretty sure I made over $300-400 at my last bank by just using the card like cash and paying it off before interest. Not to mention gift cards at giant eagle with fuel perks or other tricks like that.
---
I brought my [bubble shield] to [seal my righteousness] prepare for my [divine favor]
---
&gt; My point was that when a great deal of Dungeon gear will be better than MC &amp; BWL stuff 
---
I always see these hyperbolic statements being made, then never see anybody mention actual examples to back this up.
---

---
Unlike you I'll provide some actual data instead of lazy, over the top statements. Here's an actual spreadsheet of the notable items that get affected by the itemization change.
---
Its key if your leveling plan avoids the PVP insanity of STV. Although I suppose the level 60 ganks wont be an issue when were all leveling through for the first time. First play through I'll prob test out STV, but once a bunch of people are 60 I'd avoid it if its anything like the old days.
---
seconded. best meme from this sub hands down
---
Can you get HWL or GRand MArshal to access PvP gear in phase 2, before BGs release? Isn't HWL / GR just rewarded to the person that literally earned the most honor the past month?
---
I wanted one so bad
---
I'm not #nochanges by any means, but I think classic won it for me here.  
---
The color palette was far more in the style of warcraft to me.  
---
Look at the skyline of the barrens, it's a completely different feel from bfa.
---
Another thing is how orgrimmar, and outside of it, looks. In classic it looks like it's 40 C hot ALL THE TIME, which is how I imagine it would be in a desert city. Bfa doesn't give that impression.  
---
Classic graphics + bfa water, is that a thing?
---
[removed]
---
Best meme ive ever seen from WoW and im not even kidding. My favourite movie to boot!
---
joke: 🤘
---
woke: \\m/
---
Because games are more mainstream nowadays. Fortnite is a flavor of the month game.
---
It's actually amazing how much of the game you had to ignore to write that
---
You must be a troll
---
Many like TBC more than vanilla.  And if you don’t think the population is going to start dwindling after Naxx has been out and cleared for a while, then we’ll just have to agree to disagree.  
---
TBC is a logical progression step and would bring a lot of people back, and even some that didn’t play Classic at all.
---
I knew what was going to happen before it even did...
---
Where’s the one with the Garrison on it? Oh... wait...
---
I'm 26, played the game when it came out as an 11 year old and I was playing WC3 before that.
---
The only one I've actually played
---
=D
---
Not dustwallow! Darkshore to wetlands. It’s still a rough run but as bad as having to go to Theramore first.
---
I have 1 healer 1 dps
---
Lmfao you and a bunch of other morons can't take a joke nor sarcasm. Get triggered much?  
---
Also do please go on about your statement. I'd love for you to make sense of it.
---
Lol what? I put everything in my credit card and just pay it off. I’ll buy an Arizona Iced Tea with my card. I’d much rather just always use one card and then pay it off at the end of the month.
---
What I would do is take mining/skinning while leveling. Just vendoring the leather you get while killing mobs should give you a nice extra chunk of gold. At 60 farm devilsaur leather or if that’s too crowded black dragon scales. Both these are needed for preraid BiS pieces for other classes and should sell well at launch. 
---
Then. when battlegrounds are released. drop skinning and pick up engineering.
---
Also be sure to pick up the FP in menethil and loch modan.
---
Pretty sure you can pick up the level 10 class quest at any applicable class trainer in a capital city regardless of race...
---
Even then I don't see the comparison. It's like Anthem releasing 15 years ago, doing absolutely amazing and everyone loved it, and then learning after much public clamoring they're going to re-release a working copy.
---
Ahhh I don't think so.  I have CA on a pserver with full t2, 2.5 and you have about 250sp self-buffed.  If you gear for alot more sp you could get to maybe 400sp self-buffed, still the proc would only be like around 600 non-crit.  I proc in the low 400s noncrit currently.
---
you won't have to purchase anything except a sub, which gets you all of the retail expansions (sans bfa) and classic. pretty sweet deal if you ask me
---
running to hide is pretty much exactly what I expected, are you sure you wouldn't just like to admit you're wrong like an adult?
---
Are battle groups not going to be a thing?  They should be as they were introduced in Classic.  If they are, queue times shouldn’t be any issue for anybody.
---
I had the option to get one, but the offer they made (interest and yearly fee) was horrible.
---
Also the art available to choose from was shit and I didn’t like any of them.
---
 lmao yeah right
---
Thank you! Your site is an amazing tool to find out whats expected of gear to come and the previous gear stats are also nice for historical purposes as well.
---
Minorities across the world salute you for your great effort of standing up for the poor and the weak!
---
I’d be shocked if they didn’t have battle groups as it was implemented during Vanilla.  Nobody will have long queue times if that’s the case.
---
And when do you use max rank then?
---
Are you serious? None of these creators capture the vanilla feeling at all. Watching the blizzcon announcement and a bunch of private server try hards wont win over his wife.   
---
I'd suggest some of Madseasonshows videos.
---
i won't go so far as to say that i've never seen open racism on my retail server, because i definitely have, but i see much less of it compared to my private server and when i do it's usually surprising to me and less ''damn it not this shit again'' like it is on private. i don't know about bans but if someone went into trade chat and started spewing the shit you can find on Dorthnale, people would definitely report you and you would probably be muted or even suspended.
---
I decided to just roll a D20 a few times and go from there . To hard a choice.
---
[All I can think of now is this.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/002/030/dysentery-died-of.png)
---
For 5-mans, you need to get in good with Druids who tank.
---
I'm currently a Fury DPS/OT and we have some Warriors who strictly DPS in raids, but they all had to tank dungeons at some point to farm things like Hand of Justice if they wanted to maintain a raid spot.
---
I personally will only invite a DPS Warrior when there's no other option out there.  A second Warrior brings nothing to a 5-man but DPS and competition for loot.  Both are already easy enough to find when it comes to dungeons, especially when you are only there for the rarest of drops.
---
You can do it as a DPS Warrior, but you will also be easier to compete against for a raid spot.
---
occasionally i log back in for a while because i can't resist the urge, but i've been trying to hold off, too
---
Except copyright law doesn't really work like that in Russia, where a lot of these large server owners are located.
---
Nope. And it’s probably in your best interest.  If you can’t afford $15 a month you should probably be doing something else with your time anyway.
---
Gelkis Clan Clan ftw!
---
GELKIS CLAN CLAN ASSEMBLE!!!
---
Same, but opposite. I also haven't played since the first week of Cata. Probably just gonna go Horde again, the only Alliance race I ever could actually enjoy playing was Draenai.
---
Just every vanilla video tbh, I’m so hyped I can’t sleep...not a good thing haha!

As a hunter you need to have major mana pots and demonic/dark runes too. With blessing of wisdom or mana spring totem, and mageblood potions + double mana oils once available you should never have problems running oom!
---
Leeroy Jenkins was an answer to a Jeopardy question. WoW absolutely pierced the mainstream, just in a different way than Fortnite.
---
&gt;Players in the NFL and even NCAA are "available" when they aren't hurt. This is such a shit analogy that I'm upset I even addressed it.

Also if they're suspended a bunch for drug use/conduct issues. But that's beside the point. I wasn't implying WoW players can't raid because they get injured lol. Whether you can't play because your baby is sick or your plane got delayed and your in the airport it doesn't matter - you're not available. If a player who is really good is consistently unavailable a raid won't wait around him, they'll fill the spot even if the only option is a sub-optimal char build. You think 39 people would be like "no let's all just cancel our plans cause we refuse to attempt end game content with a ret paladin."
---
You seem to be arguing that if you're an elemental shaman or a ret paladin that absolutely no one will ever let you in their raid and it's impossible for you to ever see end game content:
---
&gt;...unacceptable for raids
---
&gt;They just wont invite you to their raid.
---
&gt;it will not work...
---
I want to make it clear I'm not arguing you'll easily find groups and that you'll have as many opportunities as others to see end game content, and I certainly wouldn't recommend anyone to expect to consistently raid and excel in end game content with sub-optimal raid specs. 
---
All I'm saying is that opportunities do come up and if you really want to do MC as a ret paladin there's ways to get into raids. It happened in vanilla, I don't see why it won't happen in the new Classic edition. 
---
Every spec for every class can experience end game content and did. Just google any spec + the raid and there's a video of people doing it. Some just have less opportunity and require a strong group to help them and lot's of pots n stuff. Nothing wrong with that if the raid is ok with it. 
---
I was in a casual raiding guild and every once in a while a guild member would really want to do MC with an alt like an elemental shaman. They made it known and when raids needed to be filled they'd throw that option out and when the cards aligned they'd do it and update the guild chat about their dps and we'd laugh or be like "holy cow more than i thought" and stuff. It's fun to beat stuff in different ways after it's known how to beat it perfectly.
---
Bet you didn't think about time passing when you read.

Every time you read "Classic WoW is getting released sooner than expected." Classic WoW release is coming closer.

Oh lmao I guess I didn't read the post. Lmao I'm dying
---
Yeah, and you’re also not the only person that I see complaining about this everyday. It’s exactly like people who post Game of Thrones stuff on their social media pages and then you have the people who post complaining about the people who post about game of thrones. It’s really fucking cringe tbh. Why do you care if these guys make videos about this stuff? Does it bother you that much?
---
Dwarf hunter, the anti-rogue
---
I don't really get what people are acting so shocked about. Blizz said from pretty much the outset was to emulate 1.12. Classic is basically a glorified private server set to 1.12 with gating to handle the different phases of the game like private servers do. 
---
That anyone seriously thought Blizz was going to start from the first patch and literally recreate every item and talent change through the various patch updates baffles my mind. I mean they don't even have all that data first hand anymore. They lucked out just getting a 1.12 version.
---
"You can lose your world buffs first, fuck that noise..."
---
Fellow nerds, how are you this Friday evening?
---
I should do this. I'm kind of torn between what's most fun for me to raid as and a class that's fun outside of that.
---
I prefer to heal in raids, but because dual specs aren't a thing I'm hesitant to commit to that
---
Neither?
---
Ah so you're a horrible person I got it lol
---
Yeah sounds about right tbh lol.
---
last time I tried, the actual quests were race specific. On a pserver so it may be different on Classic.

Let me ask you this then. How often do you give your cat the opportunity to kill birds? Do you let her outside when you see birds vulnerable? Because what you're telling me is just because someone will do something, we should be ok with it, EVEN IF there are ways to reduce it. Don't let your cat outside if you see a helpless bird you psychopath. Guess what, your cat won't kill a bird that day and you won't have to think about it next time you see a bird. Same thing with an item. Why be against changing it if we KNOW it reduces the overall amount of opportunities for someone to act out their irrational behavior?
---
It’s really going to depend mostly on your prep. Your class will factor in somewhat also. I levelled 3 Warriors among a few others to 60 in vanilla.
---
The First Warrior was around 25 days because I had no idea what I was doing.
---
Second Warrior was just over 12 days, knew what I was doing but wasn’t rushing.
---
The last was 8 days 7 hours because I was well prepared with where I was going, what I was going to skip, knew key items to get ie whirlwind axe. Overall it was pretty draining.
---
I think I went around 10 days on my Lock playing more relaxed like my second Warrior. The ~2 day difference is notable because it was a new class for me and definitely felt like I had an easier time of things.
---
Since the announcement i started up playing on a pserver so i can dab in the classes i am considering. Will def drop it for retail though and make final decisions then.
---
Lol those people are so dramatic. 
---
I love classic too and can’t wait for the release let alone the reveal of the release date.
---
But seeing those posts where they’re like “I CaNt TaKe It aNyMoRe” is so cringey.
---
IMO MadSeasonShow is my favorite to watch.  Very chill guy.  Tons of good quality vanilla/classic videos.

Here is his channel

play balance in pvp. Resto in raids.
---
Good to know where your closest vendors are. Getting bags isn't too hard, though you obviously won't be using 12+ slot bags for a while. If I recall, 10 slot bags weren't that hard to make so friending/being  a tailor will go a long way.
---
Madseasonshow I just found out and he is pretty chill and uses nice footage in his videos.
---
I also enjoy the classic winds channel. Or vanilla winds, not sure of the name, but also covers each class in pretty much depth with memes.
---
But the real money is in armor repair.
---
Malfurion wasn't around in vanilla.
---
The deadmines were also a mission in WC1!
---
Yep.  I played on a couple pservers years ago.  One just shutdown out of no where(after I had a 60), and the other was a laggy/buggy mess.
---
These will in NO WAY clear the copyright of the CC companies, trust me I know from personal experience.
---
Story time: Back in TBC when I played heavily on my frost mage, I wanted to take one of [my favorite custom designed art pieces/renders [cred: Greg Martin]](https://wallpaperplay.com/walls/full/1/6/2/88941.jpg) and add it to my debit card with Wells Fargo. I knew it would be an issue since art work is always owned by the artist, so I reached out directly to him via email to see if I could get approval to use the design on my card. He was super quick to reply and to my complete surprise, he was completely alright with it!
---
Thinking I was in the clear, I started the process to get my debit card art approved knowing I had the artist's approval to use the piece (and even asked prior to verify that is what I needed to get it approved). The design was submitted, then rejected which I immediately appealed citing the approval from the artist to use the image on my card. Wells Fargo replied and said sadly even though the artist approved the use of the design, the other copyrights on the game and everything could be viewed as potential infringement on Blizzard's rights (given they had this above CC with visa too at the time + WF debit card is via Visa) and they wanted to avoid any potential issues / lawsuits thus denied the card. 
---
tl;dr no you cannot use any WoW design on your credit card as the companies are too afraid of a lawsuit (valid reasoning).
---
Will do. I’ll send it over tonight. Mine is wakaflaka. I’ll know it when u see it haha
---
Looks like a hawk or an eagle.

But how can you ally with the Gelkis and farm Theradras for [The Blade of Eternal Darkness](https://classicdb.ch/?item=17780)?

I agree they will monetise it with cash shop in future. Re-releasing the classic game is not a new thing and is a proven strategy to increasing the profitable life-expectancy of an MMO.
---
TLDR: The best we can do is fight for sensible monetisation, which doesnt ruin the experience we all want.
---
Everquest did this and its the entire reason the game still runs. What everyone who says 'ill unsub' doesnt think about is that the game wont even be available for you if they cant make money from it - thats even if you would follow through on this in the first place which we both know isn't likely because nostalgia is a powerful drug.
---
Do you really think they are doing this out of the goodness of their hearts? Do you really believe classic wasnt purely slated by an ambitious bloke in Blizzard to show hes a pragmatic business-minded guy pitching how they can make easy profits (subs without making a whole new expansion content!) and also recover some community good will seeming like they are doing this for the fans? Dont for one second think that at least part of the reason progressive itemisation decision wasnt partly decided because it would be a lot of effort (aka cost) for very little benefit (aka they wont lose paying customers over it).
---
This is business. They're playing the 'devs passionate about authenticity' for maximum nostalgia as its the their #1 marketing tool at this stage. There will be many more classic servers starting fresh after the first batch, there will be progressively released expansions in the future for those that like TBC and WotLk (likely wrapped in releasing new servers so Vanilla-authentists arent offended). If they calculate they will make a lot more money (without a significant community reputation impact) to create a cash shop at the minor loss of a few subs who actually follow through on their unsub ultimatum - it will 100% be worth it to them.
---
Heres the thing, almost every single one of us would reroll on a fresh classic server released in 1-2 years time to relive it again (private server players anyone?) - Blizzard Activision already know or will realise this opportunity to a) sell items that make leveling easier for every server release (therefore releasing new servers will become a regular occurance) and also other cosmetic or utility items like mounts or bags that can be passed off as not pay to win.

Just be willing to tank in 5 mans or start the group yourself and recruit a tank asap. Raids you'll have certain warriors designated as offtanks and way later you'll be gearing towards the 8 required for the horsemen but anything raid related you will know ahead of time. You wont suddenly be yelled at for not being a tank in BWL
---
Warrior is top Raid DPS in the game.  They’re not quite as desirable in 5 man dungeons as they bring little utility and are extremely gear dependent. And typically if a DPS warrior is running a 5 man dungeon it’s because they aren’t geared yet.
---
This. So much this.
---
I want you to know I hate you as a person based off the one comment of yours ive read
---
It checks out. I also looked up some of the items I was told would break shit but it turns out they’re part of the Dungeon “rework” that updates loot tables by a ridiculous margin. Blizzard said those changes will come in phase 5. Doom and gloom over nothing.
---
My bad! I’m still not entirely convinced on this decision though but I’ll give it a pass. It’s still pretty crazy to see shit gear become BiS, but those are from the t0.5 questline. My issue really is how Blizzard worded it, and it seems kind of lazy in my eyes. Still, I fooled myself it would seem.

Please note that you're going to have to go back to darnassus at level 10 to get your pet.

I don't know if it's an EU thing or a private server one but I hated the acronyms they'd use. DD (damage dealer) instead of DPS and the worst dudu instead of druid. Miss me with that nonsense.
---
I’ve been playing since release (and on private servers for the last few years) and 90% of world “pvp” was just ganking... Real world legit PvP is hard to find.  
---
I mean it’s not the end of the world but I see all these ppl hyped for classic world pvp and I’m pretty sure they either never played classic or they forgot that it’s mostly shit.
---
Vanilla WoW wasn’t set for competitive world PvP... I don’t know how to fix it, but being able to one shot players 10+ levels lower than you at will is lazy design.
---
That's a thing of nightmares
---
If i dont see atleast 100 others running to goldshire when i make my human im gonna be upset. I hope they don't do sharding, it'll take away from the social aspect. If theres no sharding then people will have to group up to get quest credit for things because of so many people. True wow experience.

---
If you are holy/prot in pvp you generally will run conc aura, so the points into devo are a waste.  
---
If you are getting attacked by any melee in pvp you will be constantly proccing redoubt.  Against fast attacks things like hunter pets and rogues it is a lot of redux.  
---
The actual reason you need redoubt is if you fully block the damage of a special ability then you do not get the debuff from it.  AKA you can block abilities like gouge and hamstring or even rogue offhand attacks to prevent poison application. 
---
That being said there are a lot of situations in pvp that you will not be able to block.  While getting stunlocksled, attacked from behind, or when spell casting.  I think you get more consistent reduction out of the flat 2%armor talent then the shield block value.
---
Same here, but I'll have a Horde alt for sure, cause old Org is best Org.
---
This made me laugh in a more embarassing manner than I'm willing to admit

I have this problem too.

In PvE Content I love being a healer but in world pvp and BG settings I prefer something like a hunter. Decisions are hard..

A few tips: Buy vendor water when it gives you more mana than your conjured water.  Use a wand to finish off mobs so that your spirit regen gets going.  Getting an enchanting crafted wands early on is a big deal in this reguard.  Spec frost.
---
Mages have to do a lot drinking, it's simply how the class was designed.
---
Classes with low downtime are Warlocks, priests, hunters, and pallys.  However, even with hunters to optimizing leveling time, drinking often is recommended.

Nah, for me, the final slide is "accepting that it'll come when it comes".

He wouldn't be flagged for PvP in his faction's territory.

What? Ofc tanks use mocking blow too... its literally taunt number 2
---
It's true. As soon as it gets close to midnight EU time, the world chat starts turning a weird fucking place full of racism, antisemitism and politics, but I guess it's those European night owls.
---
I mean, it couldn't not be. That place is a mess.
---
I agree with most of your points but the one thing private servers will have over classic servers is the fact that you could get a group almost anytime in the day due to the differing regions/time zones.
---
Only if it's going to be a fair fight for them. I'll still take on a couple horde if I feel I can do it, or come close. No point killing lowbies unless it's funny, I'd rather /dance.
---
I used mocking blow all the time when tanking.  Learn to stance dance.
---
Pallies are very good 5 man tanks, especially early on
---
Another 36 yr old checking in. I need a early evening guild cause of work in the am obv. I'd be willing to no life my sat nights tho :)
---
And I’d have to disagree with you both. Some servers are absolutely worse than others and everyone’s experience will vary. The most popular/populated servers, though, are absolutely filled with the garbage you’d see on 4chan. 
---
In my experience, being a part of the top guilds is an awful experience just because of the chat/discord. The absolute opposite of my time raiding in retail vanilla.
---
Damn you really are a dumb fuck
---
GL multiboxing in vanilla. You'll level a lot slower than solo. There are no shared drops for quest objectives except named NPCs. Only one herb or ore will spawn for one of your characters. One mage will most likely farm faster than you. And you'll spend an insane amount of time and gold getting gear, attunements and faction reputation.
---
Because I think I want it. Like you thought you wanted Classic. Different strokes for different peeps bruh.
---
k
---
For me, once it leaves Vanilla I'll unsub. Simple.
---
The game stopped feeling like WoW once when the aliens came and we all stood around the same campfire, alliance and horde, roasting s'mores singing Kumbaya while holding hands like the last 60 levels of fighting the same red names out in the world didn't matter.

---
Great story! I remember doing something similar with my very first PvP twink.     
---
Back then I didn’t even know that there was a term for those kind of characters – it was just something my stepbrother and I came up with on our own. 
---
So, without much knowledge we tried all kinds of stuff to get the best possible characters for the level 19 bracket, which led us to test if it was possible to earn the [Bloodsail Admiral's Hat](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12185/bloodsail-admirals-hat) at that level.     
---
The reputation was simple enough to get since you could earn it without gaining XP if another group member killed the guards in Booty Bay for you while your character was dead but after the rep-grind we quickly realized that the quest for the had just wasn’t available for our characters at that level.
---
So, I did the *only sensible thing* and filed a ticket to report this *obvious* bug.     
---
Shortly afterwards a GM contacted me but they would have none my *"sound logic"…* 
---
However, since I was bored enough to push the matter, I continued to argue with them and ultimately went on to *demand* that they change my characters status to elite, since it *clearly* met all the requirements an elite mob would. 
---
The whole thing was really quite funny but in the end we had to agree to disagree.
---
Haven’t thought about this whole incident in years, so thanks for reminding me of that with your post :p
---
Well, the images that are literally unchanged other than being graphically updated are fine. The ones where there were complete overhauls I don't like very much. Like old org vs new org, I like the original.
---
No, you just invite her to the party and turn on [Retribution Aura].

**( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)**
---
If you ask me, they called it classic to entail everything pre-cata. So to each their own. Everyone has their own interpretation of the meaning of classic.
---
Run and drink (no sitting)? What is this sorcery?
---
I feel like you misunderstand. Not giving people the *option* to opt out of PvP will create bad blood between people and the game. I love PvP servers, will always play PvP servers, yada yada. 
---
But many people will be happier with an option to opt out. And I’m glad that they have that option, as they don’t really have that option now on most private servers. But if you boiled what I said down Into PvP = toxic than I don’t know why I’m trying to explain that again?
---
i played a LOT for 7 months and barely got the blue pvp gear.. it’s not a foregone conclusion to get it..
---
Checks out. I’m 31 my brother and buddies will be playing ranging 28-31
---
For a couple days. The rough launch probably didn’t help the unprecedented sub drop, but I don’t think it was the cause. WoD itself was the cause.
---
huh?  where do you get that the pvp gear won’t be the 1.12 state?
---
sweet!
---
The GMs really were great. I just wanted to appreciate them for being patient with us young gamers.
---
/join world  
---
Everyone who does that, will be on world chat.
---
Dps to impress the chicks and healer on the side to show her your sensitivity. Pretty slick
---
I’m definitely not happy about that :/ I want everybody to be able to play for a cheap rate, in comparison to their countries exchange rate. I just mean that if it’s 100% free it can attract people who really don’t care about the game, not that you should have to pay an arm and a leg. I hope they can lower it for some countries.
---
When i first started in 2004 i was 10. I went south of Durotar and tried to go to Ratchet from the beach(did not know where i was going at the time). Holy shit man... when i saw that élite shark coming to me i almost peed my pants!
---
No fucking way
---
What is this even directed at? I’m more confused than anything... 
---
...?
---
Yeah and when the PvMers are grilling you for not doing enough dps or telling you your gear is shit and you can't come to whatever raid, that's not toxic?
---
To be completely honest i rarely play with euros and have never encountered shitty world chat until I started playing with euros in p servers. Especially all the Russians you guys have to deal with.
---
I love the raptor mount at lvl 40, the epic one feels like a demonic pogo stick on speed wearing a raptor costume.
---
What's not nice, is trying to have a heated argument and you get whiney fa%%ots who get upset by everything and report you for saying gosh darn meanie head. Keep you fucking profanity filter turned on if you have a problem. Shithead.
---
P1 will be The Reckoning for most PvP characters.
---
You have to hit certain ranks each week once a server goes live if you intend to compete for the first r14.  Hardcore PvP'ers level very fast and they world PvP in groups for maximum efficiency because there are no BGs to farm honor in.
---
In P1, they thrive off of people still leveling in the 48-60 range.  They camp flight paths and they roam around zones, hunting down players in packs.
---
Currently, this is where it is usually decided which faction will be strongest on a PvP server.  One faction gets to level to 60 easier than the other, and then the number of 60's sways in their favor making it even easier for the next player to hit 60 while bottlenecking the opposing faction.

Hashworm, I quite simply could not agree more not only with your main post, but also your replies to comments. It is absurd that after asking so long for an official Blizz vanilla relaunch, people now want “strawberry banana split with sprinkles”.
---
I played through all of Vanilla and raided some of Naxx. I was there when BC launched. Population split is all too real and will ruin the game again as it once did.
---
Unfortunately, as Blizz is keeping their options open, you can be sure that TBC will be launched, and so will WOTLK, and maybe even other expansions after that.
---
I would play Vanilla untill the end of time, probably. I mean, as if Vanilla isn’t a big enough game right? Whoever tires or, dare I say it, finishes the game can always reroll a bunch of other classes or even in between factions. 
---
Unfortunately, history tends to repeat itself, and it looks like this will be the case for classic. Hence why I will not be playing it. I’ve been through this ride.
---
Capital One wouldn’t let me use WoW, Final Fantasy, or Sailor Moon images; the online check caught it before even going to a human (this was a while back).
---
I tried a personal screenshot of WoW at Yankee Candle, too, and that didn’t work, either. That one made it to the humans and they contacted me and said “No go”. They admitted that since it was a screenshot, if they didn’t have a WoW player reviewing images they probably wouldn’t have known.
---
It is really bad, but between the healers it is probably the best in a full healbot spec so you've got that going for you.  
---
Priest smite spam is so bad they basically just wand stuff to death.  Pure Resto shamans don't have wands so they have to cast even though they have no spell pushback immmunity.  They do have some efficient damage in searing, flameshock, and weapon buffs.  Druids can go cat, but without any talents it is really bad damage.  They tend to do better root spamming and dotting things to death.  
---
Hpaladin can swap to 2h on the fly without any talent points and baseline hammer of wrath means you only need to get stuff to 20%.
---
Consecration and ret aura means you are the only healer that can aoe grind for gold.  
---
If you are able to get spellpower gear and especially the activated spell power trinkets you can play shockadin.  It is a meme spec, but can be quite effective in small bursts and in between still play as support.  It is far far better then other meme specs like moonkin or melee hunter.
---
having separate PvP and pve server options will help with toxicity from people who don’t want to play on PvP only =\= all toxicity is forever cured
---
They're doing sharding, it was confirmed in a blue post some time after the demo at last blizzcon
---
Hashworm, I have to disagree with your response on this one occasion and rush to the defense apes. 
---
The retarded neckbeard to which you responded is very much human filth.
---
And how do you know what if any rules they agreed to?
---
I know you said to treat it as if it was happening but honestly I think if they even tried it would back fire so badly. The people who would have bought the microtransactions will not being after a few weeks and the people that are left will be driven away by it's implementation. I know Activision are deemed evil and money grubbing but surely it doesn't take a rocket scientist to work this one out?

Someone else add along to this list, with other items that go through this power creep via patch updates. 
---
I'll say this, even though it probably doesn't matter. I don't agree with the itemization decision and find it to be an excuse, for the team to not do as much micro management level work on updating items based on their stat re-allocation history. i was already a little bummed out by the AV decision and figured I can overlook it, but this sucks. 
---
I want progressive itemization. i want to figure out what items i will need to farm for the current patch and the future patches. It's fun to me, having to figure this stuff out and "google it". It's fun making spreadsheets that determine your BiS based on the current pool of gear available; then having to spend hours finagling around the 3rd party database to see which and what items you should swap due to a patch release dropping. You ask friends, you look for old data on the internet, you create it yourself to help your community adapt to the changes.
---
The changes in itemization budgeting throughout the course of Vanilla allow for this type of interaction and theorycrafting. The decision of making everything 1.12 stat budgeted once the item is released is a nay for me because it takes away that slight mystery, and those "aw fuck, i vendored those man!" "Haha, you idiot. C'mon, let's go run you through &lt;insert dungeon here&gt; and get your replacement then. Oh pray to Rngesus too before we get there." moments some players will experience due to it being their first go around, will not be had at all.

Ha! I'm going from UD to orc. I was thinking doing herb/skinning until i hit 60 for mats. I guess ill see
---
The hate for rogues fuels me. Also not wrong.
---
Started playing classic in May of 05 and was 6 years old at the time.. maybe 5 can’t quite remember
---
My first character was a human warrior and I was exploring in Elwynn when I crossed the water into duskwood and thought it was so cool how everything was dark and haunted. Continued to travel on the road into darkshire... and then followed that road into deadwind pass
---
My poor level 9/10 self got destroyed by those stupid fucking buzzards that are by the path in there.
---
I started panicking thinking that it was over and I would have to delete the character because I was lost and couldn’t get away from them when I rezzed
---
My dad heard the commotion from the other room and walked in, opens my inventory, and clicks on my hearthstone
---
Still vividly etched in the memory, nothing will ever top classic wow
---
If alliance had shamans I'd roll alliance in a second. I played horde for a large part of my WoW experience and Alliance cities and zones are much better presented and constructed.
---
Yikes, I hope I don't encounter people like you in classic
---
If you're playing solo I'd honestly play alliance to have a fresh adventure! It'll bring more content you've had experienced first hand
---
Hahahaha. Aliens! Love it. Right on my man. Only thing I’m doing different is that since I’m SURE Blizz will do the expansions ($$$+Demand, just look at all these responses), the. I’m not playing classic at all. Can’t fall for that shit twice in a lifetime!
---
I played horde in Vanilla up through WoD. Played alliance from end of WoD through BFA. Never playing alliance again. There were way more children playing alliance and the community was just fucking awful. Horde always seemed to have an older crowd so I'm sticking to horde. I'm sure people are still gonna be assholes though.
---
Is it the true wow experience?   Was the original launch that nuts?
---
I've never seen someone get muted for religious views, political views, shitposting, or trolling. 
---
The only time I've seen someone get mass reported/muted is if you're openly racist/prejudice and/or dropping ethnic slurs or spamming like a retard, and even with those cases, you'd get muted anyway just at a later time.
---
I was all over the place for months, constantly debating 3-4 classes, until I had a eureka moment on troll priest. Think about classes you're "definitely rolling" as alts because they're fun, interesting or just badass, that's always been priest for me. It just took way longer than it should've to realize it and stop stressing over forcing myself to "consider" classes I wasn't even that fond of out of fear of making some kind of mistake... like rolling a class I've always liked... hindsight is 20/20 I guess
---
I play both factions. How else can I appreciate the game in its full splendor? That’s one too many credit cards though...
---
[Wildthorn Mail](http://classicdb.ch/?item=12624) is a better chest unless you're extremely concerned about mana pool.
---
[Skyshroud Leggings](http://classicdb.ch/?item=13170) are also better.
---
I would wear [Omnicast Boots](https://itemization.info/item/11822) over those.
---
You've got Fordring's Seal in ring2. That's a healing ring. Cyclopean Band is also really bad. Instead there's [Eye of Orgrimmar](http://classicdb.ch/?item=12545) and [Maiden's Circle](http://classicdb.ch/?item=13001).
---
[Eye of the Beast](http://classicdb.ch/?item=13968) is way better than that trinket2.
---
[Gizlock's Buckler](http://classicdb.ch/?item=17718) is better than that off-hand book.
---
Hammer of Divine Might is patch 1.10.
---
2-3 on average 5+ on weekends.
---
Precisely. Expansions are bullshit.
---
There could still be  more than 100 players per shard, forcing people to group up if they want to quest. I think the point of sharding is so we don't have 1000 players fighting over tags on launch day.
---
Great work seahask, this is a great resource!
---
weird, my screen is always more grey when i level in stv
---
You're not on 4chan, no need to be edgy. 
---
You can call someone a "fucking retard" or "noob" or "dumbass" all you want - if you start dropping ethnic slurs or the "F-word" (the one against homosexuals), you're getting muted anyway, whether it be from Blizzard or the mass report system.
---
I feel this post is basically: “You think you do but you don’t “
---
Yes, yes and yes. Once again, WHAT KIND OF NO LIFE PIECE OF FILTH looks at a game like WoW and says “well, there’s just NOT ENOUGH CONTENT there to keep me entertained for a lifetime. Moar grind! Reset my progress! Make my gear irrelevant! Please, I can’t just reroll a different class”.
---
Fucking hell man...
---
If I'm given a couple years of classic first and then BC classic gets added, there's a very good chance I'll roll up with the expansion. BC was an amazing!
---
It’s strange because I really like good graphics yet I find the older graphics more appealing. Especially the trade district pic, the BfA one looks so cold while the warmer colors look more welcoming. I like the BfA water better generally. This can matter for some as atmosphere plays a role in nostalgia as well as moods but shouldn’t be too big of a deal.
---
Is the footage from classic or 1.12?
---
I think you seriously underestimate how small of a percentage these private server communities will actually be in Classic. Most of the toxic assholes will stay on private servers because they're free and they can get away with that abhorrent shit.
---
Why would they pay money with a $15 fee only to get banned in an hour for spam whispering a streamer the N-word? 
---
Also, ninja looting communities/gank teams all exist now - they will no doubt make an appearance in Classic. Some people just crave that streamer attention.
---
y i k e s, this ain't it chief
---
I wasn’t old enough for one but I sure wanted one
---
Usually takes me about 8-10 days /played. I don't rush hard but I don't waste a bunch of time doing random shit either. Minimal dungeoneering and professions.
---
Expect about 2-3 months before the majority of your server will have at least 1 lvl 60. It’s not a sprint. Because eve if you do go faster than the majority it will be hard to find groups for anything.
---
&gt; I really want to play balance in classic but definitely want to raid lol
---
pick one.
---
TS3 came in 2009
---
100% this.
---
This, 1.12 av, etc is why Classic is DoA.
---
Stick to private servers, the best part of classic will be that we have a reference guide for stats (assuming they don't secretly nerf everything to cater to BfAcucks. Which they probably will, knowing modern Blizzard).
---
Not exactly classic but nyhm has some awesome videos. Nice hao (a gold farmers story) still cracks me up.
---
At 60, Paladins are way less popular than Shamans, and even taking into account population from a single faction, only druid is less popular. Priests are relatively close in population but are closer to Shaman than Paladins.
---
Checking multiple polls, none of them have Paladins in the top half of classes people will play when Classic launches.
---
It's like you want to be edgy and say it but you're too scared to type it out. Lol
---
Thank you for the information! Looks like I did overlook a few things, and I will make some changes to the document. I am new to classic and am pretty unfamiliar to the power balance between spell damage and int so I take it that spell damage is king in most cases based on your suggestions.
---
 
---
I should have noted that in general, I tried to stay away from the very rare boes (see maiden's circle) as I'm cheap. 
---
A question on the off hand though, why do you have that shield rated so highly? It has less int and trades mp5 for spirit, do you think that the regen stats are that relevant in the situation? I am not tied into using a shield, I just am looking for the best balance between mana pool, regen and damage.
---
This thought crossed my mind and then vanished after I spent 10 minutes reading through this sub.
---
Sounds like you play during EU hours. I'm in a private server world chat right now that's spewing anti semetic slurs.  It's par for the course.
---
Yes! That was the first credit card I applied for. my request was declined...
---
no its not in the hall of fame... LOL theres an actually committee that puts games in... and fortnite ain't one bud, we shall see in the future though
---
Judgment and seal are both pretty low mana cost as it is, you're never really going to go OOM unless you are spamming holy lights or consecration or it's a ridiculously long fight. 
---
Extra parry helps you out a lot versus enemy melee and you also swing about 2x as fast any time you do parry, so it causes you to attack more often as well.
---
Then activision happened
---
Interesting to say the least.
---
I didn’t know how to leave Mulgore on my first Tauren. Was just grinding til like level 13 almost until my friend showed me the route to the barrens. Good ole noob times.
---
Big difference between profanity and hate speech.
---
Anybody who disagrees with sharding doesn't understand how many people would quit without it. There's 2000 people in Elwynn Forest and that release hype turns into only the hardcore players hiding in the corners of the map grinding mobs while the casuals lose interest in mass.
---
Real Vanilla never had so many people at one moment starting, it was sprinkled through-out the years. If you actually want no-changes then sharding actually makes sense. 
---
Sharding doesn't create ghost towns, they could even go as far as keep Goldshire, Razor Hill, etc unsharded so you see the masses when you come back into town. Then as you leave town it's a more reasonable population competing and grouping with you. 
---
I'm a big advocate of sharding 10-20 zones, they're going to be equally as cancerous without quests and since they're non PvP zones it doesn't negatively affect anything. If you want the old feeling of Vanilla then don't push away the casuals, these changes don't negatively affect anybody. If casuals can at least make it to level 20 they can do dungeons and people will be more spread out in levels.
---
There were people every fucking where. Could go to the end of the earth and see someone.
---
I'm gettin' redy for classic man. I cant not troll in chat, but I dont wanna be banned either hah.
---
Why are you paying with a card on a date?
---
I've seen a lot of memes. This might be my favorite of all time.
---
Sharding won't be restricted to starting zones, and is gonna be on forever.
---
This is 100% what Bli$$ard does these days: lie, cut corners to save costs, and nickel and dime their customers.
---
A week after launch they'll just make a forum post saying "oh sharding was always planned from the start, you're just interpreting what we say wrong" then never address it again.
---
What level did you get each character to during the demo to make a decision?
---
That right there. "Hate speech" Being offended at everything and labeling every little thing as race related is the problem.
---
who says I pay with a card on a date? o_O
---
People report for anything, way less than your so called hate speech.
---
Something important to add (other than the "CAN'T /SIT IN CLASSIC" talk) is that you should always, *always*, #ALWAYS# cast hammer of justice before you unleash a big reck bomb.  If a character is stunned they cannot block/dodge/parry and it's definitely worth it when fighting any class with melee defenses like a hunter, rogue, shaman, warr, or another paladin to take all that chance to miss off the table.
---
It won't be. Sorry man, shitbirds will be coming out of the walls to be themselves.
---
I stopped playing on a pserver like a few months ago and trying my best not to start again. Keeping myself fresh for classic. But it's hard. I just can't wait to be drawn into wow once again!
---
2000? That means 6000+ on a server. Eh.
---
If you have a lot of SP, CA is better because the spell power boosts the lifesteal proc a lot.  MoM is better if you are gearing straight str, not as much int/sp.
---
For one thing, a shield basically doubles your armor, or triples it if you're wearing a bunch of cloth. Even if you're not thinking about PvP, it's really good to have some armor. You can't just avoid ever getting hit, and since the class has absolutely no escape mechanisms or real CC, it's annoying to run around with like 13% mitigation.
---
Secondly, mp5 is really good and this class struggles severely with mana in longer fights. Intellect is fine and all but it's not something that fixes our mana issues. This gear list is lacking in mp5 and this is an opportunity to get it without sacrificing any spell power.
---
Thirdly, you can enchant a shield. While there aren't many shield enchants, it's still a nice chunk of extra stats. With this gear, you'll have very little survivability and it's nice to add a bit where you can.
---
I love raptors but I’m rolling a Tauren and I don’t think any other mount looks good on those guys. Can we get some kind of improved version of plains running?
---
So why would you whip this out?
---
So you want progressive content but not progressive items or talents?
---
Makes perfect sense.
---
/s
---
yes whilst fire is better than frost damage wise but without proper gear+talents you would OOM really fast in MC, the 15% mana cost reduction was quite important even for mages in T1 gear.
---
2000, 1000, same result you're not going to get to kill Hogger in under 1 hour. This Reddit represents a lot of the hardcore population who would be willing to sit in the corner of the map and grind 3 spiders until level 10 if that's what it takes to get ahead. 
---
Also the other option: Player population is 100% going to decline after release week, inversely from original Vanilla. Open up more servers and now you have dead servers that further accelerate the decline of players unless they merge servers. Classic has potential to grow until something like Oldschool Runescape, it would be a shame if something minor like sharding killed the hype.
---
You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.
---
If I want to play with my friends and level up together from level 1, would sharding affect that? Would we still be able to play together? Or do we risk being separated and unable to interact?
---
Awesome resource and list! I dont play Shaman, but I enjoy seeing guides like this to help other in the community. It's not always about min-maxing, it's about having fun.
---
Could invite them to group and play with them. Outside of group I'm not sure.
---
That makes a lot of sense, thank you!
---
Wow was the fortnite of its generation
---
Can't wait to be the nolifer on my server to set the honor cap for the week so high.
---
You got to rely on auto shot more. You should only need aimed shot and concussive shot(for leveling) and the occasional multi shot. Don’t use multi shot too much if your mana can’t permit it on single target.
---
It was s shitty card. You had spends hundreds of dollars to get a few minutes of game time. I carried mine with pride, but it wasn’t worth it all.
---
You re going to need servers either way. There s no sharding/crossrealm in vanilla.
---
Imagine comparing texture editing to a DUI
---
I totally get you! I'm sat here salivating for classic to come out so I sate myself with tinkering with gear sets. Honestly its more I want to know what items to look for, since someone just posted a list of the beginning items and it was like ~6k or something.
---
I'm also an accountant and I think spreadsheets are in my blood...
---
All I read was corporate speak.
---
Did Auto-Unstuck not work in vanilla?
---
Do you not think minorities feel welcome in spaces where hate is freely thrown in their direction? People like when others stand up for them and try to make them comfortable. Black people aren't mad at the whites who tell the whites who say n*gger to stfu, they're mad at the racist fucks calling people n*ggers. We should all aim to make others feel welcome and at least attempt to think before we speak.
---
I got to say going up over Durotar to see the ocean and Ratchet in the distance really was immersive.
---
i tried it with wells a few years ago and it just copyrighted everything i even drew a stick figure and it said it was copyrighted and even a pic of a bottle cap with no markings and same thing so gave up trying to set it up.
---
I'd probably be down, depends on your schedule. PM me
---
So side with M?
---
Option A: Sharding in 1-10, hopefully 1-20 zones. Builds a successful server, casuals do dungeons and make it to level 20. No server merging or minimal serving merging neccessary.
---
Option B: Open up more servers since people complaining about crowded servers, the population declines from release as 100% expected (contrary to Vanilla which had solid growth and never a bottleneck of people starting low levels). 
---
Choice is obvious here, I'll be here on release week and I don't want to tell others "I told you so" I just want success.
---
Was classic on max settings?
---
Getting my flame imp.  It was so cool how much depth it added having an entire second entity to control.  It was so cool really becoming a warlock whereas before the imp you were just generic.
---
If they were dumb they'd be wiped out by the time we get to them.
---
I play league at those times too, and I’m planning on rolling a nelf hunter. I plan on leveling solo but will definitely need a group for some stuff eventually if you’re looking to add potentials to a list
---
Probably why the EU players are shitting on the US
---
In raids you'll be just fine as only dps, you want more fury warrs than you need off tanks. Trying to join dungeon pugs as a dps warrior is going to be tricky though, as long as the group leader is a warrior tank also trying to gear, you are almost guaranteed to not get a spot.
---
Spagett!
---
Thicc
---
I'm primarily excited for the smaller realm sizes. I remember even back in TBC how much you remembered people in your faction on your server and the friends you made. Especially excited for the little server celebrities that always pop up. Not that I'll be one, but I still remember some from back in the day. Like some dude named Churp and a parody character someone made named Churplol.
---
What the wtf am I supposed to spam in Barrens chat now? Thunderfury? Anal [Rupture]? ... it just isnt the same.
---
I feel like it's only hurting them in the longrun. The longer ahead of time they announce the release date the more ground swell they'll get from youtubers and free word of mouth advertisement. So as frustrated as I am for the lack of release date I just laugh because every day tons of people tired of waiting are rolling on private servers becoming invested and lessening blizzard profit from the whole venture.
---
I can't link the website to that one private server that everyone plays, but it has a list of stats and Paladins are most definitely ahead of Shaman.
---
Still say they should name them with average white guy names.
---
"Dude you play classic too?!?! What server?!?"
---
"I play on Frank!"
---
"awh man.. I play on Keith."
---
Are you trying to tell me that the League or Dota 2 community isn't fuckin' terrible? Because no matter what I see on WoW private servers, it still doesn't even compare to fuckin' Mobas.
---
Who the fuck still plays retail?
---
Valley of Trials, jumping in the pool of water in the cave full of demon imps. There's a little alcove you can swim into, and that's the moment I thought "yeah, this games got it and I'm fucked"
---
.
---
Pretty much, yeah. I don't really need to live and breath every change that occurred between incremental patches, though I will still miss things like the unarmored epic mounts. I was told I was getting 1.12. I didn't really expect anything else. This is still a step up from private servers. 
---
I mean if we really want the authentic experience then the first 2 months of classic should feature loot lag and high latency with frequent disconnects. Gotta have that authentic experience and all.
---
I mean we only built, and gave them refuge, in the civilized world they so badly want to live in, but it must be so tough having to hear a word. Bless their little hearts.
---
Blizzard is not wrong for making Diablo mobile - that's what the market says they should make - but they were wrong for announcing it to their core fans at Blizzcon. That game is meant to attract new customers, not appeal to their base.
---
Give how they have handled WoW Classic so far, I'm confident that they will make their core Diablo fans happy.
---
its highly doubtful that you'd be able to pick tools even with sharding :D i recommend to skip it entirely, do not even think about it.
---
Thanks that's all I needed to know! Will be grouping up then :)
---
I don't mind sharding in starting zones on launch days. I hope blizzard intends to scale it back and get rid of it as soon as possible though.
---
Paladins will not likely find a place to tank in raids and even doing it in dungeons will take a bit of creativity and preparation.
---
As for Warriors, there's a bit more micro-management with your mobs in Vanilla tanking compared to Wotlk.
---
You should probably level as arms or fury so your rotation will likely be Sunder-&gt;Tab-&gt;Sunder (repeat) while using Revenge whenever it's up. You can switch stances to charge/intercept/mocking blow (your 2nd taunt)/thunderclap for situational stuff.
---
Once you're Prot there is more tools to play with, but I'm not an expert on the rotation as I haven't played Prot since retail Vanilla.
---
In a 5-man you will often want to start building aggro on the 2nd and 3rd targets your group is focusing and just let the dps stun/kill the 1st mob down quickly while you get some sunders stacked on the others.
---
I pretty much just avoid Desolace other than Mara runs.
---
Ive compared 1.12 blue sets for 4 classes (sham, rogue, hunter and warlock) and at best the sets are essentially t1.5. For warlock and rogue they are halfway between t1 and t2, but you can even argue they are worse in some instances such as the rogue blue pvp set having 0 agility, essentially losing 4% crit over t1/2. Hunter blue set is complete garbage even when compared to just t1. Shaman is irrelevant because youre healing in pve and you can get way better healing gear. And warlock blue pvp set is like I said better than t1 but worse than t2. Even though in reality the t1/2 warlock set is considered awful and you get offset gear anyway. So the blue pvp set wouldn't see any use there either. 
---
If you’re curious about the other classes just tally up total stats for each set and compare. IMO people are making mountains out of molehills regarding the pvp gear. At best you’ll see classes go for the 2 piece set since it’s a really nice bonus. But that in no way is as game changing as people make it out to be. Rank 13 gear has usually been available when bwl releases in private servers and I rarely saw people put the metric ton of effort needed to get the pvp gear for the slight advantage in pve.
---
Fording’s Seal is + healing IIRC.
---
Did you just see "sharding" and decide to rant?
---
Back into the basement with you.
---
Whaaaaaat
---
I prefer the real hype vid https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RGBnjELkgok
---
Why would you not pay with a card?
---
I watched the World of Roguecraft videos today while I ate lunch.
---
Yup, I overlooked that! The edited version is now posted!
---
There may be a couple *people* per server using r14 weapons by the time phase 3 or 4 comes out. Rank 14 items aren't even close to freebies.
---
i agree. what the fuck is the point of the report button when we have /ignore. even if they are being racist or biggoted, just do /ignore and they go away magically. you don't need to police people for "justice" or whatever. just move on
---
I have like 6 night elf hunters all between lvl 30-50s.
---
I have never made it to the end game. 
---
But I always create a new character and keep trying.
---
You're a legend
---
Die with honor, for once in your life, Alliance scum !
---
Roll Horde.
---
OMG thank you for that reminder, that's the most hilarious thing i forgot about
---
I run from girls that are ignorant to credit cards. 🏃
---
So I approach classic like I am leaving town for 1 hour sprints and then returning to settle business. Prepare supplies, get quests, go out. Then after buffs expire and quests are done, return, sell ,craft, upgrade spells, resupply and do it again. If you break your adventuring into manageable segments inventory can be managed efficiently
---
Because you don t buy coffee with a card and don t take a date out to dinner as a first date
---
Because back in the day people didn't collude as well to monopolize R14s. Welcome to the new WoW meta.
---
You missed moderation. I'm pretty done with kids taking over chat to spew out edgy bullshit just because they think it's funny. I'm too old for it.
---
Swifty's [Incredible Warrior Tricks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MAZkK_xdFg).
---
Dae mad xp above actual content?
---
it takes you 6 weeks to reach rank 14 atleast, no matter how much you PvP because of how the honor system works. Also, the PvP system won't be out at launch, either
---
Americans and eastern europeans. I'm looking forward to not having to deal with either.
---
Follow ur dream bud

I actually gank people based on their name. Anyone with a retarded meme name dies

---
I know you're sarcastic, but paying customers were actually asking for LFR. Sharding, crossrealm, etc. were all introduced as solutions to problems that customers had. Those problems were fixed, but (unintended) new problems were created.
---
Around 2007 I met a girl in a bar and we dated/hooked up for a while. She was unapologetic about playing WoW and I was like it's cool, I play all the time, too.
---
Most of the people you meet are great. Most of the people in world chat are not. There's always someone getting off on there being no adult supervision.
---
Who says you don’t buy coffee with a card? Have you ever been outside?
---
Why do you have to be a minority not to enjoy listening to racist bs?
---
Oh yeah and my first disappointing experience with how the credit system works when you have little credit history. Fresh out of highschool with a regular job and got rejected.
---
I was trying to remember why if everyone just /join world wouldn’t it make a chat channel anyone could join. I remember our warriors had a channel back in vanilla and we could talk any where in the world to each other.
---
Probably just really falling in love with my character and getting excited for the long journey
---
I'd suggest trying to find a guild before launch that would be okay having a Balance druid in raids. I'm sure there are some relaxed guilds that would be okay with it.
---
gelkis so you dont have to buy a target dummy and deal with mobs that have pets
---
The part where they were goin over their scripts for the arena servers was horrible. “It’s just a free win for blizzard”. We get it you guys are streamers and want that stuff for easy content.
---
Yes
---
There's no way Blizzard will remove stuff from loot tables in later phases (e.g., having T2 drop in MC at the start).  They're going to do the simplest thing: use the 1.12 loot tables, and omit items that were added later than the current phase.
---
The main problem is that pretty much every ret paladin guide if you search google puts them into the same shoes as DPS warriors, they prioritize all the similar gear in all of the guides so even if you are doing research to help yourself play ret paladin, those are the guides that you see. The only way to figure out that isn't what to do in the spec is to test it out, which most people can't do (and even if you do, tons of private server values are wrong), so they give out the most up to date information they can find or have looked at.
---
There are a lot of people who don't even consider alternatives to what they have been told, but there are also a lot of people who will listen and want to learn.
---
All I know is wow was like the forefront of gaming addiction talks and tv documentaries on kids playing 24/7. Culturally it was huge.
---
No, I am texting from a tree. You re a weirdo for buying 5$ stuff with a card.
---
was killing gnolls with some warrior.  he then decides we're going on an adventure so we run all the way to lakeshire and he buys some white weapon from a vendor.  i'll never forget such a (now) mundane event and its kind of sad how stuff like that cant be replicated.  first MMO experiences were some serious crack magic
---
I'm sure Blizzard will be aware and will be looking for collusion patterns. Cross faction collusion is against Blizzars ToS.
---
You can tell I don’t tank :) learn something everyday!

Interesting this post appears, because tonight at work I had already planned to start identifying all the quest chains in my database.  
---
I already took a stab at it once and it got wildly out of hand and completely disorganized. I took a deep breath and deleted it. Back to square one.  
---
Now I'm going to go in to the project with a more manual approach and view each quest individually in classicdb.  
---
It will take me a long time, but if I go zone by zone I should be able to complete it in a couple weeks at a slow pace. It also helps that I'm being paid at work while I do it.

I can attest to this. Am a software engineer and it's why we can use Reddit but no other social media site. Joke's on them.

Yeah, those same guides tell you to not even do your other demon quests like felhunter and succubus. Try pvping without a felhunter or succubus!

Putting up a spreadsheet for pre-raid BiS items is the essence of min-maxing.

Have one. Or rather, I have what that card became after the partnership between 1st National Bank of Omaha and Blizzard ended. 
---
I used to hate the card because the bank that administers it was super shitty to me, but they've actually gotten better since it got away from being a WoW card. I would have cancelled it entirely by now if it wasn't a generic rewards card. 
---
But, it did end up paying for several months of WoW.
---
You aren't going to need as many servers after the first couple months than you will at release, though.
---
Yes sure pm me your lol screenname and we can chat!
---
Yeah the way sharding works on retail currently is that if you invite your friend into a party, they will be brought over to your shard.
---
No the opposite Iam saying that MMO crowds are usually less cancer and that it has more to do with the game genre than with the F2P/monthly payment factor.

I’ll never forget the first time I played WSG after I had travel form. The feeling is indescribable. The best part of being a druid is being able to dominate WSG flag-running.

Yea I tried to aswell and I just did Northshire Abbey (human starting zone) to start as a design concept deal of sorts? It took me a while to try and prepare and didnt turn out well organzied, so I thought well if someone else has made this already, it'd be nice to utilize it. Do you have Discord? if so add me #-is me#8020 and ill send you an image of the one I did for Northshire Abbey. It's not bad but not amazing either.

Oh okay, I misunderstood. I think you still got downvoted because the topic of discussion in this comment thread is clearly between f2p and subscription MMOs, especially since I don't think there are any fps or moba games that are subscription based.
---
Pepperidge Farm remembers.
---
What do you mean?
---
Taunt, Mocking Blow, Taunt is a true combo in classic with 1/2 Improved Taunt.
---
Another good combo is Taunt, Revenge (stun), concussive blow (stun), Taunt.
---
You would normally use one of these combos on Skull target, and Sunder the next kill target instead.
---
&gt; Blizzard needed to fix faction balance, but they never did.
---
&gt; How? I dont know exactly but just like every other problem in the game since the beginning, try, fail, try again.
---
The only way faction imbalance can be fixed is by providing incentives for being on the smaller faction.
---
When there aren't any, people transfer away from imbalanced servers/quit, resulting in even worse imbalance, resulting in more people transferring/quitting...
---
The Barrow Dens. What a hellhole.
---
Like you say, tanking is very different in vanilla compared to wotlk. VERY different. I also enjoyed wotlk era warrior tanking but can't say I ever got hooked during vanilla. I would recommend Skarm's YouTube videos. The guy is a walking, talking tanking-encyclopaedia.
---
If I load in and see 800 other people in my starting area, I’m promptly logging off and logging back in after a month.
---
Sharding has to happen. You’re an idiot if you throw a fit about it.
---
The one time I remember Paladin tanking being a thing in raids was for the.imps in MC. Warriors can still easily tank them too, but Paladins certainly can as well.
---
I personally see this as cash grab. I paid for expansions and subscription. That's massive costs over time. If there's sth behind pay wall, like cash shop, that is clear anti consumer practice.
---
Iirc League of Legends had a card too, American Express I think?
---
There's massive difference between playing multi region and jumping from region to region. It's not even close.
---
For hunters the rank 7 gloves can be used to break the devilsaur set but will be replaced by T1.
---
Sharding has a place, but I don’t think it’ll impact the gameplay as much as you think it will. Only major events (like release) will probably have sharding to prevent entire servers from crashing left and right.
---
Regardless, this game will die if there are 1000 people running around in starting zones for the first month of release.
---
It’s been so damn long since I’ve seen that.
---
WoW has had some crazy PR over the years. 
---
I do miss the Night Elf Mohawk grenades though.
---
The original is even more epicker  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNOxz9paA6E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNOxz9paA6E)
---
It was populated, but it wasn’t to the point where 2000 people were running around in the same area.
---
Y’all gotta remember that WoW was popular, but it hadn’t caught on to the mainstream right at release. We’re looking at probably 3+ million playing at release, which was larger than vanilla WoW.
---
Why would you wanna date someone with that mentality?  When I was living in texas I saw a chick in a convertible with a horde logo bumper sticker.  That's the type you wanna be dating :P
---
And I’m sure you remember the constant server crashes and lag? I’ll pass and take sharding.
---
If it's the popular one I am thinking about, the websites statistics are across all levels to my knowledge. IMO representation at 60 is more relevant than what class peoples bank alts are.
---
I f’ing hated BC. They started making the gear easy to get and separated PvP and PvE gear. That infuriated me!
---
The first shaman class quest, at 10, and then every shaman class quest after that, even as I cursed trekking around the world.
---
I think blizz will have both BC and classic server options in the future and it will be nice
---
I've also been interested in something like this, but I don't have any idea how I would put it together. If you want help and are willing to give a little guidance, lmk. 
---
Otherwise, if you put this together please share here or DM me. Cheers!
---
Some people have fun by playing the game optimally, you clown.
---
Hopefully this time they’ll release it when 30% of the population has made it through Naxx, rather than 1%.
---
Anyway, the second they move on to BC I’m quitting. I made it 6 months into BC and got annoyed and quit.

You can do that, you can be known as the leather vendor on your server.

Bind drink water to your action bar. Then it’s really quick to do 5ish second drinks. And wasting water is not a big deal because it’s free.
---
Except there will be, since LookingForGroup was global in the last patches.
---
The TL;DR of the changes:
---
* 1.9 LFG was made global but limited to cities, like Trade
---
* 1.11 LFG was made fully global, but was made opt-in in 1.11.2 (identical to /world on pservers)
---
* 2.0.1 LFG was disabled as a means to get players to use the LFG tool introduced in TBC

---
Yes I parrot /u/SharpsExposure, what do you mean?
---
He means making a macro that will use sunder on the target you are mousing over, instead of using tab or clicking, also from what I remember talking, sunder does not break cc  so using this will allow you to build threat while not triggering your auto attack.
---
I have seen some Skarm videos, but haven't given them a watch yet.  I will check them out when I get some time.
---
Yeah I still remember my first pair of trash gray leather shoulders I got on my rogue. 
---
Also, this isnt really a thing anymore but in vanilla it would normally take until about level 15 before you got a “long” cloak instead of the short/medium ones.
---
I remember my sixth grade friend Eric talking about this. I actually didn’t watch the video until like 10 years later, but it’s still hyping me up rn
---
I was thinking of playing a dwarf priest actually. Also semi-serious. Let’s get in touch closer to release date.
---
The #nochanges people are fighting a battle they have already lost. It's already been confirmed WoW Classic will have changes from it's original form.

Except as that guy pointed out, LFG was made global in 1.11, so there is world chat...

That's the guilds that can dedicate players to control the crater 24/7. Not limited to pserver players.

That's literally 5 people on 1 pserver. Yeah sure they're definitely going to become an issue in Classic.

That's been a thing years before Nost exploded in popularity. There was a guild named &lt;Gankers&gt; during MoP that would camp streamers.

Being an asshole isn't exclusive to pservers either.
---
They don't have class statistics by level. You basically created your own argument that can't be proven wrong, but can't be proven right, either. Paladins as the 4th most-played class across all levels is a proven fact - that's what I go by.
---
Hahahaha.
---
HAHAHAHAHA
---
Most Saturday nights sounds like a great option for me
---
If you don’t clear Naxx, so what? I had a blast in Vanilla only making it barely into BWL...
---
I think people are getting hung up that half the server is going to be running around in full T3. That’s not going to be the case. Realistically it’ll be your 1-4 hardcore guilds just like in the past running around in 1/4 - 1/2 T3 months after the phase release.
---
Everyone on this sub thinks they’ll be clearing Naxx. LOL!
---
Well, my server is fairly small, so trade chat is basically dead.  Hopefully we wont have that problem on Classic...
---
If we're getting 1.12 AV, I can almost guarantee we are getting battlegroups.
---
I don't know, if I ask and she let me there are is no rape 0.o?
---
You take a drink just before a server ticks. So drink&gt;tick&gt;walk&gt;drink&gt;tick and so on. You'll burn through water this way, but if you have a surplus for whatever reason It's a fun trick to learn. 
---
You'll want an energy timer add-on to do it consistently. That's how I do it, anyways.
---
I made a tauren druid with a regrettable (arguably offensive) name once. Reported myself about the name hoping for a name change (before you could pay for it.) DM didn't let me, told me to role a new toon. Was about level 12 so I couldn't complain.
---
There's a meeting stone in the first screenshot. Look harder.
---
Reminds me of the first time I rolled on a roleplay realm. I created a dwarf and fairly early (lvl 5ish) made my way towards Stormwind.
---
When I ended up on the Stormwind side of deeprun tram, there was a gnome player inside one of the "booths" selling Gryphonheart (an addon where you could create your own books and items and give/trade with other players that had the addon) stuff.
---
And that's when I first started using the GHI addon (I think this was about mid wotlk)!
---
Same bro.
---
Didnt you earn game time with this?
---
Dying in fargodeep mines to shitheels talking about candles

---
Shaman, Paladins and Druids can heal all content with 21 points in their healing trees. The deeper talents are pretty weak for all of them. You can always swap to a pure healing build for a few weeks when a new raid is released - at least until your group has it on farm.
---
As for Druids vs. Paladins: they have totally different roles in PvP. 0/30/21 Druids have absolute trash damage. I don't recommend it if you want to run around in cat form and blow people up. That's not what they do - they heal and CC and tank the boss in AV. On the other hand, 21/0/30 Paladins are basically Warriors with Cleanse.
---
Those were added in 1.4 which means that they'll most likely be added in phase 2 whereas those items added in 1.5 would go in phase 3, assuming they do it as they told us.
---
I tried doing some digging. I found 0.6 and they reference bind stones being previously used for Astral Recall. Does that ring any bells?
---
I suspect blizzard probably wont want to ruin the game but looking at retail who knows.
---
Did Blizzard ever consolidate servers? As far as I know they where always opposed to it.
---
Yes, you can get R14 without BGs. BGs actually have *nothing* to do with honor or the honor system rewards. In fact, BGs being absent will not have any effect whatsoever on the honor system. You can get every rank in the same amount of time with or without BGs.
---
I agree. I’m not super happy about it, as server identity in pvp for a long time was tied to bgs and seeing the same opponents in game as well as in world. But the alternative of a server with massive bg queues for 1 faction isn’t amazing either. I’ve played on a server like that in vanilla and it is no fun
---
Not to mention that other warriors probably don't want to waste their time tanking in groups where another DPS will be rolling on their loot.
---
People have a habit of regurgitating facts instead of using them to draw meaningful conclusions. In this case, the underlying question is if your points 8 points are better spent in shield talents or imp devo aura and toughness (the idea of this being that you still net additional survivability when using a shield and aren't wasting talents if pull out a 2h instead, because its armor bonus).
---
Did the math with your provided formula using full soulforge armor +2000 for a shield. Just over 6000 armor total.
---
5/5 Imp devo +3/5 toughness provided less than a 2% damage reduction.
---
So if you need to take 6000 damage to die (reasonable since you heal yourself, and giving the benefit of the doubt), you'll have mitigated less than 6000/.98-6000 = 123 damage additional damage needed to die.
---
Compared to a shield with a block value of 50 after strength bonus. The 8 shield talents outperform the above with 3 blocks (150 damage, I think that's how it works), which seems reasonably likely to occur. Worst case scenario, you don't block at all, and took less than (2%=123) more damage. And you get the flexibility of switching auras without any feelsbadman.
---
(armor bonus from toughness will continue to scale with better gear, but so will block value) 
---
Definitely better to take the shield talents even if you aren't going to use a shield all the time.
---
Typed this rant in case others ever ask this question.
---
raid wise you will be fine as a fury warrior. you might be asked to off-tank if your guild has a no show etc (pretty much all warriors should have a tank set even if its not your main spec just in case). in 5 mans it would be much easier for you to find a group if you throw on a shield and you wouldn't even need to change your spec. it's still doable if you don't want to tank 5 mans it would just take longer to find a group but always having the option of throwing on a shield and being willing to tank is a nice thing if you ask me. you also could always just create your own 5 man groups. the thing is tanks are probably going to be less willing to play with another warrior because lets face it most tanks in 5 mans still want that plate dps gear. another bonus as a warrior i feel its easier to get gear compared to other classes.  certain items you will be competing with rogues/hunters but thats it

https://forum.nostalrius.org/viewtopic.php?f=36&amp;t=16057&amp;sid=39c355564a2e45c2ccb103cc431bcd26 Really good tanking guide
---
My only real raid experience in vanilla has been as horde, but I’d imagine there are a handful of times a prot paladin would shine, such as the AQ gauntlet, or the adds on Frankiss. Taking a prot spec paladin for a few specific fights probably isn’t worth
---
I can't put in the link directly since it has the private server name but vanillaradar.com has statistics on a private server that you can chose what level range you look at. If you include all the level ranges on the sliding bar, paladins have 7.2%, when you go to just 60, paladins drop down to 4.8%. Funny enough, shaman stays at 5.5% if you include 1-60 or are just looking at 60
---
Crossrealm bgs didn't ruin the game *and* it was in vanilla 1.12. People voiced their concern over the 1.12 AV and they are still implementing it, so I don't see why they wouldn't implement BGs in their 1.12 state in general.
---
There biggest current one was in France last time I checked
---
Do you need a safe space, snowflake?
---
crossrealm bgs ruined the game *and* it was barely in vanilla
---
no
---
Oof! I’d like to order one right now.
---
As ths is somewhat of a PvE warrior Tank thread...
---
If we're looking at private server class distributions it seems like there is a over population on warriors. How does this affect the usual "Looking for tank" issue? 
---
Just curious.
---
[https://youtu.be/MENudPgUa5s](https://youtu.be/MENudPgUa5s)
---
It was good comparison. Imagine getting triggered about a person Who thinks rules and laws are there for a reason.
---
I went to that site and there is no sliding bar. Show me an exact link that shows me your sliding bar and I will gladly admit that I'm wrong.
---
Barely in vanilla still means in vanilla. Naxx was barely in Vanilla, does that mean it shouldn't or won't be implemented into Classic? 
---
This also isn't a thread about our opinion on cross-realm BGs anyway. It's about the precedent that Blizzard is setting and the values that they are communicating to us and how we can draw from these that cross-realm BGs will be a thing, whether each individual agrees with it or not.
---
You're at least 13 years too late for this analysis.
---
Agreed.
---
Also the lack of RP-PvP server at launch has me messed up. I guess imma just have to do what I do best... Improvise!
---
crusader strike was in vanilla, get lost
---
An ele shaman is most definitely not considered a great dps slot in raids, thus not min maxing a raid. A BiS  spreadsheet is a goal to work for.
---
I remember that. It was my dream have one of these but I was too young to own a credit card :'(
---
after the first few months when the players leave that are just testing vanilla to see what it's like, ya
---
I saw this backfire on our rogues when our main tank bid on perdition's blade. I laughed when he equipped it and the rogues raged.
---
Gotem.
---
Crusader strike was not in 1.12 though, which is what Classic is based off of excluding content and catch-up mechanics. The actual class builds are not going to be in their 1.0 state as is the precedent set by Blizzard.
---
I imagine blizzard will have their armory on their website connected so using it to look people up will be confusing if you don’t specify the _classic
---
It is WELL worth the $15 per month. In today's dollars, Vanilla cost about $30 per month, and it was worth that price as well.
---
If you look at it from a dollar-per-hour perspective, it's actually quite reasonable.
---
Bottom line though is it's the best game of all time. Doesn't matter that it's older.
---
I don't think they will release an unbundled way to pay, unfortunately, because Classic is a big way for them to get people to try modern WoW. I think you should at least give it a try though. If you really like it, you may just want to save $15 extra dollars per month to pay for it.
---
*"Gank me like you do, corpse camp me like you do"*
---
That's right but there is so much to do w/o grouping at 60 anyways. For example farming AD and DMF turn ins, generally farming for gold and rep. Those things take a ton of time.
---

Imagine using a metaphor, and people using their brain to think about the metaphors semantics, instead of ridiculing it over pointless quantitative questions. May come as a surprise, but some people are really able to use their brains in a fashion that vindicates their status as _sapiens_.
---
I occasionally buy 1$ stuff with my card!
---
it's entirely arbitrary, if flying mounts came out in 1.11 in anticipation of BC in the same way xrealm BGs did then people would obviously be correct in advocating for their exclusion, in the same way people who advocate for the exclusion of xrealm BGs are objectively correct
---
further, cross realm bgs don't actually fix any issues at all and instead address what is obviously a symptom of a broken server, servers are designed to have a balanced faction distribution and breaking that is what causes long queue times in the first place, it is in everyones best interest to throw out the absurdly stupid notion that xrealm bgs are required and instead advocate for servers with a healthy faction distribution
---
cross realm bgs don't make the game playable for someone playing on the wrong side of a massive faction imbalance, it doesn't suddenly allow them to form pve groups or go out in the world without being zerged constantly, it does virtually nothing except address a minute issue for those who are honestly the problem in the first place 
---
regardless, your entire theory is based on 1.12 AV which is once again, a data issue, their furthest back build is 1.12, they likely couldn't recreate an older AV even if they wanted to

reported for harassment.
---
If they told people on all these dead servers they could transfer to another server for free, what would they have to lose?
---
Server merges, free transfers, maybe even free faction changes.  Of course there are endless amounts of incentives they can give also, maybe a mount, pets, whatever.  The reason this hasnt been done is beyond me, I always assumed there was a reason they didnt want servers balanced;  maybe they make more money off server transfers and faction changes.  Personally I think they woulda have made a lot more money long term, because the game would have had a much better community if servers were balanced.
---
xrealm BGs ruin properly balanced servers. A lot of the fun I remember having was due to the fact that I KNEW the opponents.  We shit talked on the realm forums! I hope Blizzard doesn't include that "feature" in Classic.
---
Just ignore those ppl it's not hard

We used dd, dudu etc back in 2004 on our German server and from my experience it is mostly still Germans using those terms. Not exactly sure why bu we have a tendency to take words out of the English language and then just misuse them to no end.

In German  a mobile phone is usually called a "Handy". In English/British English a handy is something very different.

I'd level until around 13 when you get Bearform and have Moonglade teleport, then join them in Westfall-ish. Then you set HS to human territory and also have access to northern Kalimdor with teleport.

Being 7 or 8 not knowing where to go on my orc warrior and killing mobs boars, raptors, scorpions, harpies outside of orgrimmar (more like getting killed by them) non stop
---
I think you would be fine if you made a good joke about. Like claim the bank totally messed up you card order. Then say you just wanted a sensible card like the Hello Kitty one they had.
---
You aren’t really wrong about server imbalance being a massive source of trouble for a server, because I completely agree. But how do you propose they actually fix that problem? The only two “fixes” I’ve ever seen were free transfers and cross server sharding crap. 
---
All I can say is neither of those help the communal feel that a server should have, and when my vanilla server opened up for free transfers it was the most destructive thing pre BC. 
---
Not being accusative, but honestly wondering how anything could be done to help a server stay balanced and also not kill the world community feel that I think a server needs.
---
Most memorable at low levels was probably making a rogue and feeling so freakin cool stealthing past trash mobs to get to things I needed for my quests.  I smirked at all the other classes struggling to get to items or named mobs I snuck to with ease.
---
Gear score and lfg addons... Still hoping the big guilds from my server can agree on where to roll so that shit can be nipped in the bud.
---
i mean it's going to upset people but you have to decide their bitching isn't worth sacrificing the health of the game and enforce strict server limits and faction population caps
---
Anything coming out in anticipation for TBC came out in the pre-patch. It is well known that cross-realm BGs weren't in anticipation for TBC anyway so that point is pretty moot.
---
Once again, I'm not here to discuss opinions on which is better, I am just stating that given the information we have, this is what I think the likely outcome is whether I or you or anyone agrees or disagrees on whether they *should* be implemented.

I am not just basing this off of 1.12 AV. Blizzard has literally given us their design philosophy over many more things than just 1.12 AV. Itemization, class skills/talens being in their 1.12 state, Raid/dungeon balance being in their 1.12 state and, reinstating, that Blizzard has literally told us their design philosophy multiple times throughout their blue posts.
---
Idk if you just haven't been reading the entire blue posts or are just drawing different conclusions than I am from the information present, but it seems like you are basing your prediction entirely on what you want to happen rather than what Blizzard is most likely going to do.

I'm hoping to see a sea of names running around like an anthill.

&gt;What is a Warrior tank's typical rotation, including stance dancing?
---
Basic: Charge/Blood-&gt;BS-&gt;Thunder clap-&gt;Def Stance-&gt;Revenge/Sunder-&gt;tab-&gt;Revenge/Sunder-&gt;etc.  Toss in shield block if fighting a hard hitting mob.  There's a lot of variation in tanking behavior on the basis of the size of the pull, how fast you're going down to damage (learn to tank kite), if a mob resisted a taunt, when to hit a pot, and if you've lost aggro on mobs and they're beating on clothies.   Pratice makes perfect.
---
Stance dancing is just learning to move from stance to stance to take advantage of your abilities that are in other stances.  Bad tanks stay in def stance all the time while good tanks learn when to and when not to chance stances for other abilities. 
---
For instance I could pretty commonly tank 5-6 mobs at once without healing aggro killing my healer.  3-4 From sunder spam, 1 from switching to Battle Stance for Mocking Blow and then back to defensive for more sunder spam, and 1 from waiting until they went for the healer then Zerker Stance-&gt;intercepting the mob about half way to the healer, and either hamstring it or sunder spam it.  This stoped the current group of mobs from beating me for a bit, ging my healer a chance to stop accruing healing aggro.
---
Healing aggro is the big killer in Vanilla wow and needs to be properly managed by the tank.  Learn to use healing aggro to your advantage via health pots, learn, to kite mobs doing so much damage that your healer is going to have mobs all over them, and develop situational awareness to watch for mobs going after your healer.
---
Finally, specing most prot is going to gimp you a tank in 5 mans due to low aggro gen.  Even in raids, I've found prot heavy tanks to be inferior at keeping aggro thus greatly limiting DPS ability to down mobs and bosses.
---
&gt;Are there truly NO instances in which a Paladin is used for tanking anything beyond 5-man dungeons?
---
Paladins are barley useful in tanking 5 mans due to the lack of a ranged pulling ability outside of undead instances.  A big part of vanilla wow is proper pulling by the tank.  I leveled a prot pally in Vanilla.  While I enjoyed the AoE farming I quickly gave up on tanking 5 mans and stuck to being an unkillible healer in BGs.
---
I main tanked for awhile in Vanilla, but don't claim to be any expert.
---
Most common skills to cycle were heroic strike, sunder armor, revenge when it procd, shield slam, and most importantly to keep shield block up as much as possible to eliminate crits and proc revenge.
---
When tanking I wouldn't leave defensive stance unless I needed to mitigate fear where I would of course move to berserker stance.
---
Only macro I ever used was one to hop into berserker stance and enable fear mitigation.
---
I never saw any Paladins tanking successful outside of some trash mobs in raids. Unfortunately they don't have the threat and the gear for it.
---
Hth
---
What are AD and DMFs?
---
Do spells you skip while leveling and grab later count? While leveling you can skip advanced ranks of resurrection  spells to save some cash.  They just rez the target with more health. Priest especially can save on training some ranks of damage spells while leveling,  since you'll be wanding most of the time.

---
&gt; Anything coming out in anticipation for TBC came out in the pre-patch. It is well known that cross-realm BGs weren't in anticipation for TBC anyway so that point is pretty moot.
---
&gt; 
---
false, battlegroups are required for arenas, extending it to bgs was an easy "solution" to a symptom they were at that point ill equipped to deal with, they have a fresh start now and can more rigidly direct their server distributions and ensure they never have the issue in the first place
---
&gt;Once again, I'm not here to discuss opinions on which is better, I am just stating that given the information we have, this is what I think the likely outcome is whether I or you or anyone agrees or disagrees on whether they should be implemented.
---
to be entirely honest, it's a total toss up, it seems apparent blizzard realizes xrealm was a mistake as most of their words have pointed towards understanding what makes vanilla vanilla, but they could definitely take the easy way out and give us an easier to solve yet obviously worse product
---
&gt;I am not just basing this off of 1.12 AV. Blizzard has literally given us their design philosophy over many more things than just 1.12 AV.

---
they're gating content and doing pseudo progressive itemization, this is a far cry from dumping 1.12 on us and letting us have at it, there really isn't much concrete to go on here 
---
raid and dungeon balance, whatever that means, would still be tied to them only having 1.12 data in the first place, so consider me unimpressed here
---
I will be killing people collecting world buffs.

When we're going in with massive class revamps from day 1, it's worth discussing what else can be fixed, especially something so small as having the freedom to change a hairstyle

I remember a bunch of warriors with that helm? Or was.that at lvl 29?
---
They are awesome to tank as, just can't raid tank cause no taunt
---
During your level 10 class quest you learn to teleport to moonglade so you can always go train there or use it to get to northern kalimdor.  
---
There are also druid trainers in stormwind and some class quests are telegraphed by ingame mail telling you to go talk to someone. 
---
So after the lvl 10 bear form quest is a good time but theoretically you can get over there at lvl 1 (you'll just die a lot unless the dun morogh wall rez thing is in game).
---
No shit, I remember you guys. There was a mage or two in your guild that ran flags almost exactly the same every time, blink-jumping off of the tip of the tunnel roof.

What's BRE?
---
If you play the current version of the game (BFA) and make enough money in the game you can buy WoW Tokens which you can use to pay for a month sub. So hypothetically you could pay for your first month of sub and then never have to pay again for retail or classic. But it does require you to consistently play BFA.

&gt;One Region: As fun as it is to play with people from around the world, I will enjoy having 99% of the population being able to speak my language. On most private servers, there whole population is there to compete against you, but only half of it can team up with you reliably. It is disappointing to try communicating with somebody, to not even get a /emote back or much of anything.
---
Well EU servers have always been like that.
---
&gt; People often talk on threads, asking what the quickest way to level 60  is, how to power level, which dungeons are "Necessary" and I think  theyre all missing the point of Vanilla. 
---
The point of Vanilla is whatever you choose to do. That's the point of open world mmorpg. Every type of content is great if you're having fun doing it. Speed leveling, twink ganking, raiding, altoholism, being The Enchanter on the server and whatever else people like to do.
---
It's fine if you tell people what's good about your idea of playing the game but it always annoys me when you diminish other ideas. It makes you look like a pompous ass in my eyes.

Dudu has always been a thing as far as I can remember.

I'd think there will be plenty of people on every server playing the game their own way, giving the game soul and character through their exploits.

Some tanks prefer to not tclap, it’s a high rage amount, it does not generate any threat, and reduces rage per second because of how you slow your incoming damage.
---
That guy has no idea what he is talking about. Do not watch that video 🧐

Pve realms are for the weak

Frankly I'd do the Wetlands run, be sure to get the flight points, level with them for the first 10 levels or so since the first ten levels are a bit boring anyways (though presonally I didn't mind them). You can train your skills at a trainer in the park in Stormwind. Then hearth back for the bear form quest. 
---
Alternatively, if you're having a blast with your friends you can even put off the bear form bit until you get a good opportunity. 
---
Once you have teleport-moonglade at level 14 things get way easier in terms of crossing continents since you can have your hearth in Stormwind (or Sentinel Hill if that's where you're questing at), and between that and teleport-moonglade you can be on either continent at a moment's notice.
---
It's a mixed back. People running around are cool and buff you and stuff. On the other hand, the last mage that gave me an int buff had "nuckfiggers" as their name. So, i think it's safe to say simple kind gestures don't entirely redeem a person. Turns out even racists say "Good morning" when it fits for them.
---
Or the guys that have no time to nolife classic and don‘t wanna spend time on ghostwalking 🧐
---
First of all, there's market for Diablo mobile in China, not here. Yeah sure, whatever you think. They will definitely make Diablo fans happy, if there are any left. I guess you don't even follow Diablo sub or play it, because you wouldn't say bullshit like this.
---
After years of being ignored, like completely ignored on Blizzcon where Blizzard didn't even mention Diablo, Diablo fans were hyped for once about 2018 Blizzcon. And Blizzard made the biggest joke. I'll tell you what, Diablo fans are fed up with their bullshit. 
---
Sure people will probably come back for Diablo 4, but if it's more like Diablo 3 I guarantee you they will leave after few weeks, just like WoW with BfA. PoE took that 1st place of ARPG games and well deserved, because GGG doesn't spit on their fans.

Delusional fanboys like you are the worst.

Downranking Multishot is useful when levelling. It’s an expensive ability but very useful when chain pulling.

Hey ... was reading about Diablo mobile launch and it led me to a WOW rabbit hole.

Anyway I just wanna say KEK and ... what was the name of that zone back in original WOW where the chat was just cancer?  Good times.
---
When has Blizzard ever recognized cross-realm bgs as a mistake? What leads you to believe that?
---
I recognized that they are gating content and catch-up mechanics as those were only meant to be in the patch(es) that they were in rather than being a fix, which is what the stat changes on pre-existing gear is considered. They told us that the itemization thing isn't a database issue but a design philosophy. Whether you like it or not, x-realm bgs was a fix to make the game more polished, whether you agree with that sentiment or not. There are a lot of things that Blizzard regrets implementing a lot of things into the game but they told us that they are recreating Vanilla in it's "most polished, 1.12 state" sans content gating and catch-up mechanics, the good, the bad, and the ugly.
---
„Avarage person“ „40 hours a week“

The cancerous chat in that one zone outside the main city ... forgot it's name ... kek

I'd probably just reroll.  I played on both in Vanilla and still prefer the idea of no XRBGs.  What Blizzard could do is limit the ability for absurd faction imbalances, as that is an actual problem that should be fixed.  2 birds one stone.

Cris Metzen confirmed medeivh was/is gender bender in Q&amp;A at blizzcon 2008. This is how I was able to share the game with my friends. Unfortunately classic will be a hard sell for this reason
---
Unfortunately had to google what this comment was eluding to. OPs user name does indeed checkout
---
The problem here is that now same-server bgs are not viable to reach the higher ranks and it will force people to do x-realm bgs, even if they don't want them or agree with them.

Do you have a suggestion? It would be really shitty if you want to roll on a server with your friend who is already a high level on a server, just to be told that you can't.

I remember trying the game a couple years after I quit, new expansion, and all my leet gear was now just quaint old once-powerful memories

I remember that I made a ton of money by farming some underwater herb up far in the northeast I think and then selling it at the AH

I remember I was in a big strong guild and we killed a giant boss creature that spawned on a field somewhere... but then guild leaders  said you had to earn guild points to get any good loot by doing this every day or something, and I was sort of like, nah I'm done with this game

I remember exploring very scary demon and fire areas, where some dungeons were

Unless you're researching how to level quickly probably at least ten days in game.

Stumbled upon this over the last few months in this sub: [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b7ou6l/wow\_leveling\_quest\_list/?utm\_medium=android\_app&amp;utm\_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b7ou6l/wow_leveling_quest_list/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

You do not use thunder clap much, if at all, at 60.
---
You can run to elwynn at level 1 if you wanted.
---
Youll die ALOT and have lot of down time.
---
But youll get there.
---
I did the opposite with a human. Which is easier cause halfway through wetlands you can just res and swim to town.
---
&gt; I really believe that this mindset is overthinking what will actually happen once the game goes live
---
Calling High Warlords roaming around STV yanking everyone
---
A couple issues with that.
---
1. Lets say someone convinces their friend to play classic WoW. Obviously they will want to roll on their friend's server.  If they cap faction population, now this person can't play with their friend, and if their friend is already level 60 with multiple raids cleared with a tight-knit guild, it would be unreasonable for them to re-roll.
---
2. What if most of the tourist population is one faction? When the tourists leave, there will be a lot of inactive or very lightly active characters on one faction which will then lead to faction imbalance anyway. It doesn't even have to be tourists, it could be an exodus of any reason. Maybe a group of guilds decides they want to change factions so they server hop.
---
3. Even if a server is balanced, that doesn't mean that both sides even want to queue for bgs. You could have a perfect 50/50 balance on a server, but if 50% of one faction regularly queues for BGs while only 20% of the other faction does, that still leads to insanely skewed queue times and premade power imbalance.
---
None of the above! For The Horde!
---
&gt; You do not use thunder clap much, if at all, at 60.
---
10% reduction in attack speed is about a 6-7%  reduction in incoming damage.  It's worth using especially on boss fights or mobs like BRD's fire elementals.  Not so useful for lots of mobs and that's when Demo shout becomes more useful.
---
Yeah .. there was such an adventurous  unstructured quality to some of it early on, it was like playing in an undiscovered LOTR world or something, can't describe exactly what I mean ... I guess age of video game innocence - I do remember it was such a grand step up from FF Online which I had played before WOW

Personally i like this route: Elwynn Forest -&gt; Westfall -&gt; Redridge Mountains -&gt; Duskwood. However it seems that it will be less effective route because of overpopulation in first weeks. For this reason Teldrassil -&gt; Darkshore -&gt; Ashenvale is my choice.
---
I think you're mistaking your anecdotal  echo-chamber as a majority. I've been playing since 2005 and I have never heard of anyone asking for gender neutral characters until probably around MoP, and even then it wasn't a very large population.
---
I prefer faster queues over seeing the same folks and forming rivalries or whatever
---
That is helpful thanks. I was doing my own list and I was wondering if the items were even available.

Seems to check out.

Tirisfal Glades -&gt; Barrens/Stonetalon Mountains -&gt; Thousand Needles
---
It isn't being insensitive. Your friends have to accept that they are a very small and fringe part of society and it is very hard to cater to every single self-identification, so it's just reasonable to cater to like 99% of the population instead of putting in 100x more work for that extra 1%.
---
You haven't played RpPvp. A majority of my server was on board for GB  characters.
---
I’m aware it wasn’t mentioned, that’s precisely why I took to pointing it out.
---
Everyone you fought were terrible players. Not even using any CC. Just auto attacking.
---
Seriously, why do so many people think that the "player has evolved" and Classic will be too easy? Clearly the pro players are a big minority. Casual players just don't care about playing right.
---
It's low level for fun not that serious haha :)

Thank you for the evidence, reasoning and discussion you brought with this comment. I think I'm done with this comment thread, now.

You always Demo as far as I have ever seen.

Argent Dawn and Darkmoon Faire, there are more factions that you want to farm rep for. Just two examples.
---
From what I can see, this community has an negative experience of private servers. My experience is completely different. I have played on only one and during that time majority of the people were extremely nice.

Even min max guilds were nice so I can't relate to some of these things being said here.

Me and my brother saw people playing wow at a lan house, and got EXTREMELY hyped to play it. We downloaded the game and when we finished, instantly created a character. We were so agitaded that only picked the race, and didn't noticed the classes, so it took a few hours for us to go back to character screen and see that the classes weren't random.

I play on one of the biggest pservers out there at the moment, and I have to agree with u/Tmblackflag. Haven't seen any blatant racism.

I tried to get some concept art from Bioshock on my debit card and that got approved. The new card they sent me when my old one expired also came with the same art automatically.

That's close to what I need, it'd be a way better tool in terms of creating a sheet/infographic myself, it just lacks the quest chain relationships which is what I really need, thanks a lot!
---
They should just have seperate TBC servers so the Classic enthusiasts can keep on playing classic. Having the Classic servers transision over to TBC is a bad idea imo.
---
Point proven.
---
if they go with xrealm bgs i hope they will tune their matchmaking algorithm to make premades go against premades most games

As a “euro” I’ll just be frank with ya: I’d get strapped naked to a chair and forced to play ten hours of dota with 9 inbred Russians and enjoy that more than playing with any amerimoron. The fucking gun talks in barrens etc was so fkin asinine

I don't even bother discussing with you if you literally cannot see the truth. Only way to show you otherwise is to let a Pally tank show it by hinself, or a retri Pally(though their damage ofc first starts getting good with T2 because of switching to spell DMG). And Feral DPS, yeah no comment, u will see how amazing Feral DPS is and how easily he can outclass rogues.
---
Ofc it has something to do with how u remember them being and playing on a p-server. Backnint he days people weren't good compared to today, and since then many specs got viable because people found out alot about them.
---
Though Paladin Tank is one of the, of not even the most annoying class to be able to be efficient with, as u have to farm A SHIT TONS of consumables. Otherwise u are useless u could say. And obviously Paladin will never be a MT, but in 20-man raids he can easily tank trash, be OT and in 40-man raids he can be 3rd/4th tank. Idk where ur info or Prove is to how shit paladin tank are, but without really knowing it, and only speculating, you should not spread out something that ur not sure about. And you can't be sure about it as u didn't try for yourself (and trust me you wouldn't be able to to try it out, if other 19/39 people wouldn't believe in you, so there habe to be more people trusting in Pally tank then just you, idk if u ever Thought about that.)

---
Damn 30,000 BCE is crazzzy.

I think their algorithm does do that. The problem with premades is queue dodging. They wait for a premade on the other faction to queue and get into a game before they queue so they don't have to face one another.

My first character was an orc hunter.  Somehow I managed to get lost in the starter zone on a quest, and I ended up climbing over the cliffs that surround it.  I died to the level 10 crocolisks outside, and then again 2 or 3 times on the run back to the entrance.  I was not a smart man.
---
Perhaps, but I am in the very small camp where, while graphics definitely dont make a game for me, world of Warcraft, to me anyway, consists of those old shitty player models. This may seem like I'm over exaggerating, but the last straw for me (during warlords?) was when they removed the ability to play with old player models. Sure, the game changed, but the old player models are what reminded me that I was still playing that wow I used to love.

Perhaps you think my priorities aren't straight, but to me, the old player models do, in fact, make or break my experience while playing wow.
---
I think I'm staying on Eastern Kingdom for the memories. I did the dwarf route in open beta and the human one at release. 
---
Between those two is really difficult for me.
---
But I guess you're right. There will be many humans.
---
Maybe I'll do the dwarf route first and go human for a second character
---
My post was asking if people will be reliving their memories with favourite pvp spots, not if they are going to PVP or not.
---
Right? That's literally calling it a second job. I feel like I'm being optimistic that I'll be able to do 20 in a week
---
Warrior is legit the best class in vanilla by a wide margin. They're the best at everything except healing and I guess aoe farming. They're the true hybrid of Vanilla and a good choice if you want to do literally anything other than heal. Unfortunaly with our modern knowledge this also means that class is probably going to be extremely overpopulated. This actually affects you if you want to play other classes like rogue or hunter since warriors want all sorts of random gear to dps with, including some mail and leather gear.
---
DD is the correct acronym, and I think it should have stayed that way, so I'm not opposed to that.  On the other hand, referring to the role as DPS was a product of WoW players at the time, so it's hard to tell which way is actually proper.
---
Dudu is just incredibly fucking stupid, though, can't argue that.  However, the comment describing where it comes from is interesting.  I'm always glad to know where things come from.
---
Get a wand.  Learn about where to get your next wand.  Get wand specialisation early to increase wand damage.  Cast upfront so you regen mana while you wand.  Get a quiver so you wand faster. Roll troll and use berserking for machine gun wand. Wand.
---
Based on what Blizzard have stated and re-stated about CRBGs, I would be a little surprised if there were not CRBGs.
---
Or we could just type "tutorial classic wow holy priest" into google, and use the gazillions of Gigabyte worth of resources that exist already, instead of opening yet another thread that will be 80% oponions, 5% flame and 15% copypasted material from the results of afmorementioned google query :-)
---
If I don't get dropped by a Zeppelin at least once, I'll be sad.
---
90% of those are 'DPS only' chads and most groups will still LF tank for a good 30 minutes in capital cities.
---
I was gonna say, probably 1/4 of the servers were wrecked at launch.  Many  try hard PvP guilds talked and picked archimonde so there would be good competition.  I think it was down for 4 days or so.   We ended up staying on our  Laughing Skull backup.
---
So if they shard barrens, why wouldn’t they shard something like AQ gates which will have a much more dense population in the zone?
---
Finally someone who gets it!
---
That shut healer who gets groups anyway because people like me.
---
Yes, that's in Vanilla.
---
The patrolling "thief hunters" existed in all major cities even back then. Not sure which patch added them exactly, but they were there.
---
What WASN'T there, was the inidicator icon TELLING you that these had increased stealth perception. ;-)
---
You clearly have literally no idea how bad the original talents were.
---
Agreed, I could listen to him speak for hours. I especially recommend the series in which he recalls his Vanilla journey, it's an amazing trip down memory lane.
---
They are definitely not on par with say, GW miniatures, but they are also not terrible: https://1.bp.blogspot.com/_32qvG77G6A8/TLB4PfCLBgI/AAAAAAAAAdM/boZ4_DcB6tE/s1600/wow_boardgame_heroes1.jpg
---
There might be a chance they don't do it at start but I am 99% sure they will add it down the line regardless because of the eventual QQ over ques.
---
&gt;WORG (women of roleplaying games) 
---
Wow. I wonder how many days we got left, before we get the first "N811 dance considered sexist" posts :D
---
Yeah that's how I feel too. The only things that aren't 1.12 is the gated content and the catch-up mechanics because of content progression. Cross-realm BGs don't really affect the gated progression so I think it's safe to assume that it'll be included.
---
Tell me this is a troll please
---
That's why you roll a Nelf Rogue to counter it
---
I expect it for me to be done in 1.5 months in moderate speed on 3-4h a day, maybe less.
---
But playing 40h a week man, that would be impossible for me with a full time job 😂
---
Great, log off for a month so the rest of us can play and then you can play your “MMO”  in solitude.
---
'Some tanks' are clueless. It's the highest AoE threat ability at 180 threat x4 targets and you should absolutely use it after a charge + auto before swapping to def stance, unless you risk breaking some CC.
---
Your mom might be more mature!
---
J/k, I'm sure she's a fine Tauren lady.
---
Seriously though, I hope you're right!
---
This sub will be furious when they realize sharding isn’t related to what zone someone is in, but rather the population density in an area. It’ll be on wherever blizzard thinks it’s needed.
---
Man's a legend
---
/r/rimjobsteve
---
&gt;is it possible we will finally get gender neutrality in the character creation stage (a widely requested feature since 2003)
---
*widely requested*.... yeah, no.
---
Just like sharding, loot trading etc was an “instant unsub” for 90% of this subreddit...until blizzard announced it, then everyone suddenly loved it.
---
&gt;They take big issue with games like this
---
**Then your siblings can f\*k right off and play something else.**
---
If I "take issue" with something, then I don't consume it. If I do otherwise, that's my own problem.
---
I don't see why millions of people should have to have their fantasy RPG setting compromised, just so a minority of people can force their ideologies on everyone else.
---
And to make myself clear: When I say "minority", I am not talking about transgender people. I am talking about tiny tiny tiny group of asshole keyboard-warriors, who spend their time abusing the real-world suffering of people of color, gender, etc. to troll humanity as a whole, by making such idiotic demands.
---
The quiver thing won’t work in classic. Private server bug.
---
Why is this precisely? The bombs just that good?
---
Well shoot,  thanks for that.
---
I plan on tanking all 5man content i participate in and i will be deliberately excluding melee dps and maybe even hunters unless i can reserve gear.
---
I WILL get that HoJ the first time it drops, even if it takes me a hundred years to form my groups.
---
Post-Naxx content. Classic WoW Caverns of Time. Time to save Manrik's wife.
---
Cmon baby, I got blessing of protection
---
Ah thanks.
---
Nah, Dwarf rogue.
---
Tiny, Mean, aaaaand in case you lack shrubbery, you can try to hide in your own beard =)
---
Why especially on horde?
---
this is maybe the most accurate joke about WoW ever made.
---
Mrgrlm is an extremely offensive word in Murloc.  How dare you, I am offended.  I demand attention and I've set up a gofundme to pay for psychological damage.
---
Wow boardgame??? Would so play (if I had peeps to play with) #feelsbadman
---
Yes, people will probbly pressure you to tank for them.
---
If you're uncomfortable with that, maybe you could go combat rogue instead?
---
Sit in Fellwood and AoE entire guilds when they are trying to pick same Song flower buff so they have to reedo the DM?
---
Yeah I can attest to that. Also love the DPS only Chads descriptor.
---
Is this a troll i cant rly tell ? I know alot of ppl that would love rp-pvp servers.
---
source ?
---
Setting the bar real high I see
---
It's a deal breaker for me same as sharding starting zones is deal breaker for someone else. Nothing wrong with that.
---
I don't think there's going to be battlegroups. If CRBGs are going to be a thing, I'd wager it's going to be all servers in a single pool.
---
What 50 buttons do you use in PvE.
---
Lolol Orcs, Tauren, Night Elf, and Undead. Yeah let’s get right on adding gender neutral classes. Lol GTFO
---
By default, a guy that flags himself for pvp against an obvious twink with fiery weapon is probably pretty low IQ to begin with so none of this pvp footage has any value. Might as well record yourself killing bots or boars. Sorry, I don't understand the fun in it and I didn't enjoy the video. :-/
---
1. Deep Fury / Prot: Revenge &gt; Bloodthirst &gt; Sunder Armor for threat purposes, with Shield Block to trigger Revenge reliably. Shield Block also makes you uncritable when you wanna be on raid bosses. Remember to use bloodrage, is very nice before a pull, and if you are tanking multiple mobs and rage is not abundant, don't use bloodthirst. It's expensive.
---
If you ever have excessive rage, dump it in heroic strike.
---
Deep Prot / Arms: Revenge &gt; Shield Slam &gt; Sunder Armor for threat per rage. Again, if you're tanking multiple targets, prioritize sunder armor over shield slam. If you're taking the stun talent, you can use that to put pause on a mob that'll die within the room of the stun so you don't have to keep threat on it.
---
As for stance dancing, whatever your main spec, you should go into berseker, use berserker rage, then back into defensive stance. Note that while you can clear fears with berserker rage in berserker stance, you can't switch to berserker stance from defensive stance while feared, so you need to anticipate the fears and stance-dance preemptively. This is annoying, and is why we like shamans and dwarf priests. If you're fury/prot, and have brought big boy healers, you can use Death Wish to clear fears in defensive stance.
---
2. A castsequence macro that goes Zerker Stance -&gt; Berserker Rage -&gt; Defensive Stance
---
Macro for your shield slam / bloodlust / sunder armor that activates heroic strike if you hold ctrl while pressing it, or cleave if you hold alt.
---
macro that announces the fact you just used last stand or shield wall, so your healer knows. Last Stand in particular can kill you when it wears off, so healers need to keep you off that treshold.
---
Depending on exactly how windfury works and if you're horde, a castsequence macro that switches your main weapon into your off hand and vice versa, and then back again. This one is for dual wielding though, mash it in your open gcds.
---
3. Yeah there are things. They're very good at keeping mediocre threat on a large number of foes without putting in much effort. Warriors are harder and harder to use the more foes they're tanking. That said, it's not like warriors can't do it. But remember how I said that you use shield block to make yourself uncritable when you want to? Paladins have an ability that gives them 30% block, and another that gives them +30% more, but only 1 is activateable, and in order to use the other one they must be crit. Plus, while their threat is okay when they're tanking, once they stop being the target they plummet down the threat ranks really really fast, so if they lose a mob that has any dps on it at all, they're very unlikely to get it back. This also makes them pretty useless as off-tanks for any fights where you are switching tanks around, say to deal with conflag.
---
everyones alliance
---
I’ve been playing a lot of r/playrust while I wait, I actually think the wait is making me lose interest in classic
---
I totally get, that there is a niche out there of players wanting/liking different things. I just don't stand by the nazi style no changes police on the graphics front. If there's a toggle, it doesn't affect my gameplay if someone wants to play with all the new animations etc.
---
The only thing I will say however, is that because of the Speed at which Vanilla PvP goes, the spells are alot more recognisable in their vanilla style, so many spells look similar in WoW today. 
---
Each to their own and in the side of settings, that customisation will add to the player base and therefore add to the longgecity of the game
---
Yeah don't worry, I can't wait to not deal with Muricans anymore too in Classic.
---
Because I don't give a shit about your politics you have to talk about in a world chat. I don't give a shit about Trump. 
---
Altough retail fucking sucks right now, at least I can play without Muricans because you have your own servers. And oh boy it's day and night difference compared to private servers.
---
You're not hitting rank 10 in 4 weeks lol
---
AWESOME!  Blizz Devs' tweets brought me here
---
Just needed some refreshment before classic instead of running AQ40 every week on a server with no max level PvP. Hopefully will change your mind with Part 2 &lt;3
---
&gt;You can call someone a "fucking retard"
---
I guess you haven't played retail in a while because people easily report you for this and make forums threads about how WoW community is toxic just because someone called them this.
---
This is what happens when you add Pandas and Wolves as races to your game. It attracts an interesting crowd.
---
Next one will be one of those foxes. Calling it.
---
A lot of Germans’ who moved to England I have met actually thought handy was an English phrase for it when they first came over. Led to some interesting exchanges.
---
Your Vanilla book club series is my favourite Vanilla content right now. Everything else is already talked through 100 times. Great job again!! I would love to hear more!
---
Don't have to, they do that themselves :-)
---
Well, additionally, it's that it's your ONLY AoE ability.  I mean, Cleave is only two targets, and Demoralizing Shout is going to do literally next to nothing for threat.
---
If I remember right, Demoralizing Shout's threat is only from using it and, separately, applying the debuff.  That means if your Demoralizing Shout is already on targets, using it again is just the same as some Priest casting some buff albeit multiplied by 1.45 for Defensive Stance+Defiance.  Then again, I had a friendly discussion with someone on this board about how Battle Shout's threat worked, and he claimed it always applied all of its threat regardless.  I think that's a private server thing, but we'll see when Classic's release; it's such a ridiculously miniscule amount of threat that this is just splitting hairs anyway.
---
But anyway, the other argument against Thunder Clap seems stupid to me: it reduces incoming damage.  Reducing incoming damage either matters or it doesn't, or else tanks wouldn't wear defensive gear but rather wear offensive gear to contribute what damage they can while still equipping a shield.  To be fair, I'm kind of curious why people **wouldn't** do this all the time outside of raiding past Molten Core given how relatively easy most of Classic WoW was, but I'm probably forgetting something.
---
However, it is fair to say that because Thunder Clap is on the GCD, it's better to start building real, serious threat on enemies individually.  But yeah, if your party's going to AoE, then Thunder Clap is totally fine at the very start, just not at all worth changing stances during combat for.  I would hope no one's seriously arguing to "stance dance" for Thunder Clap outside of specific scenarios.
---
DPS meters are mainly important over time or for measuring your own personal best/improvement.  A lot of variable mechanics on a single fight can cause someone to dip down but if someone is constantly ~20+% DPS behind equal geared people of the same class then they are doing something wrong.  Even then I don't think our guild leader/officers ever called anyone out for sucking at DPS despite it causing issues occasionally (we had some bad ranged DPS that caused our guild to almost collapse on Lady Vashj).
---
Imagine killing a Devilsaur and just as you're about to skin it, you get sapped and watch the guy with &lt;Leather Vendor&gt; under his name skin your Devilsaur...
---
Ahhh, feels good to be a rogue
---
Vanilla Book Club videos by Galator!! Nice source for in-game lore.
---
I feel attacked
---
I'll be sapping alliance waiting for the boat in Ratchet again.
---
They have said that this will be used only to alleviate the issues very very early on in the servers life when there are hundreds apon hundreds of people in the 1-10 and 10-20 zones. They haven't been incredibly explicit, but they stated that their goal is to let everyone get started and make it out into the world without competing with a wall of people trying to tag mobs the second they spawn. You shouldn't be too worried about areas where you can engage in world PvP being sharded.
---
They also know that if they sharded STV there would be riots.
---
Watched the clip and man does this gif stay true to the original!
---
Basically any threat add-on.  Only exceptions would be on fights where there are aggro drops.  Unless you are literally less than 1% away from pulling aggro and casting a fireball and hoping the tank gets more threat before the fireball hits/crits ... then that might be pushing it a bit too far.
---
As far as I remember you met the same people in your battle group ALL THE TIME. I got to know some of the people from other servers since we often queued at the same time. Sure it's not the ideal, which is a perfectly balanced server, but it's not a community shattering disaster either.
---
I caved. Am currently leveling a mage on a low-pop private server, low-pop because PvP isn't really my thing I'm a thru and thru care bear. Had some nice conversations in barrens chat. Yeah. I know right?!?! Barrens chat! O\_o 
---
:D
---
More like your pet is doing 20-30% of the works and your steady shot rotation is doing the other 70-80%!  Loved me some BM hunter though just had to watch aggro if FD was resisted the first 2-3x I used it.
---
A classic. Did you ever just distract lowbies to make them fill their pants?
---
I plan on using two weeks of paid time off to no life it to 60. Joanas record (Which I'm sure can be improved on by her but is an okay goal) is 116 hours. Take that and divide it by 10 hours a day (Which I honestly will play more) and you get 11.6 days of playing to get to 60.
---
Whether you prefer thunderclap, demo shout or battle shout it's nice to initiate with a little AoE threat just to offset any potential heals that may be needed before you can get a hit on each target. This is really only important when your group lacks cc and you get smacked by 3-4 mobs on the pull.
---
There's nothing more annoying than mobs scattering or charging the healer.
---
&lt; Turned 52 a week ago. Wouldn't say retail was awful. It held my attention for 3-4 months before I got too bored to stay. Am looking forward to replaying classic and hope its as much fun as I remember. I just hope I can find a guild that suits this time around that suits as much as the one in vanilla did. I reckon a big part of the fun was the people I was raiding with. Took it seriously... but not too seriously.
---
Imagine thinking only having male/female characters in wow is somehow excluding lgbt people lmao get the fuck over yourselves.
---
Ok, so basically classic deathknights. I'm still thinking what to play and currently leaning towards priest. In my classic days there weren't much warriors around. So we frequently just replaced the tank with more cc and more dps. Bosses get tanked by rogues with that dodge cooldown and groups where just fully cced and butchered one after another.
---
While a mouseover macro would streamline things, it can also precarious at times.
---
Also, it's not a common practice. I prefer a method that fits within the scope of what the average player is comfortable with.
---
Do you buy these tokens in-game or somewhere on battle.net platform?
---
Then they can just not play or get over it.  
---
If gender choices in a fantasy game upsets you, grow the fuck up and get a life.
---
Answered here https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bh06aj/nyah_good_riddance/eltgx0o/
---
Why is it important for dps? Not dying is important, not getting push back, not having to move etc all boost dps. People of different skill levels have completely different dps, that should tell people with any shred of critical thinking that there is far more to maximal dps than just spamming 1 button...
---
Tanks are still the hardest to find even in 5 mans from my xp on private servers
---
The ideal solution is to only have cross server enabled during off peak hours when queues are too long imo.
---
Personally I would prefer some attempts at balancing the Realms myself, but that may be more controversial than CRBGs. Either way it is not a dealbreaker for me.
---
They are obviously euro trolls, rarely do gamers in us talk about politics and guns and when they do rarely do people reply
---
[Nope](https://www.worldvideogamehalloffame.org/games)
---
yes and mounting with stacks wont be possible too i guess.
---
So Reckoning for pvp will be kinda dead in classic other then do duel rogues.
---
whats the point in smushing players who have no ability to fight back (gear/level disparity)? thats not pvp
---
Yeah ChaosGandalf is right, they're pretty poor quality tbh. Exactly like the pic he linked.
---
Any other than kodo or raptor?
---
I want a Horde Undead WoW credit card!!
---
I think it's not about the original launch and more about how private server launches look like.
---
In short, levelling without sharding and with dynamic respawns is very very very easy.
---
Do you have a suggestion for balancing realms? A faction population cap had a lot of problems with it. People leaving one side more than the other (tourists can be mostly one faction and then mass exodus from the server after a month or two), possibly not being able to roll on a friend's server, one side still just queuing more than the other are examples.
---
If they implement cross-server battlegrounds then I think it will be some time after the initial release of battlegrounds. Blizzard needs queue data before they can choose which servers to group together.
---
Yeah, it's not a perfect solution but it's the best one we have.
---
I think they are still in deciscion process regarding this since battlegroups also depends on server faction balance and population on servers. It is still quite unclear how many will be playing Vanilla and how many will play at 60. 
---
Will there be a need for battlegroups? 
---
I think Blizzard is keeping this issue open and will adopt an 'wait and see stance'. Since Bgs is comming in later phases it is possible to ha e a rough estimate how amount of players before releasing BGs.
---
Brilliant!
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/The_Barrens_quests

If a list of quests for a zone got spoiled by Cata, there is an option to look through the page history:
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/index.php?title=Feralas_quests&amp;oldid=1813652
---
what book is that?
---
Honestly dont care about the gender neutral stuff on this post but I wish this post was real just because I want rp-pvp servers on launch but I can’t find anything on this. Would love for a real source on it though.
---
Not just in-game chat either. I tend to play late and grouped up with some Americans in Discord on my last pserver. You couldn't go for afk to get a drink without coming back to politics.
---
I would like to see them try not a hard cap but a separate login queue for each faction on a server. This would incentivise players to not roll the overpopulated faction on a server, but not force them.
---
Obviously but that doesn’t change the fact you don’t use 50 buttons to dps in classic. Not even remotely close.
---
man, that's THE BOMB
---
Population will be more reasonable by that time so not a big concern, will likely be similar to what people experienced before. However Vanilla never had the low level bottleneck its about to experience. Also AQ gates is PvP zone so crowded equals world PvP.
---
I think he means bracket stacking. Where a guild can not only monopolize the top brackets, but get multiple people in them every week. Kinda like 10 runners in a race agreeing to all have the exact same time so they all technically come in first
---
Oh wow, TIL
---
Why I am reading about this first just now
---
I don't know what else to say than yes, it does. Go with 1 button spam and you will do shit dps for almost every boss.
---
Classic overall but if they added the grass and water from bfa that would be sick
---
Got a friend whose mission is to speedlevel a rogue just to gank in StV
---
Well that was pretty fucking cool
---
I am not saying 1 button spam is going to do similar dps to mix maxing but you don’t use 50 buttons. Not even close.
---
My mains were dwarfs back in the day so ... Dun Morogh -&gt; Loch -&gt; Westfall -&gt; Redridge -&gt; Duskwood -&gt; Wetlands -&gt; Duskwood.  At least I think so cant remember exactly.  I think there were a few high level quests in duskwood I didn't complete until I got higher level after going through wetlands and then coming back.  In Loch/Westfall I didn't do all the quests but moved on after I got to the appropriate levels.
---
This is the best thing since when my mom stopped cutting my grilled cheese in halves and started cutting them into triangles.
---
40 hours a week is a full time job no?
---
Yes, that was the point I was making. I doubt an average player is going to dedicate as much time to the game as they would to a job
---
Lol whut? But I literally do.
---
I suppose some people who are ganked consistently through a zone would want to return the favor to the next lot of levellers going through the zone after them. Some want revenge, some want to vent, some are asshats.
---
Though I agree completely in asking what the point of it all is, it will likely happen anyway. Anyone who's green or higher is fair game. Greys are for Sapping only.
---
Speed isn't everything. Having fun along the way is much more important.
---
Of course, you are right. Shows how rusty I am.
---
List them then
---
Yeah I really liked Azshara, spent a lot of time on my first 60 grinding the Satyrs there when I was leveling.
---
I do not mean bracket stacking. That's different. Bracket stacking is colluding with members of your own faction to monopolize the Rank 14 and many of the rank 13 spots. 
---
Queue dodging is colluding with the other faction so you don't face other premades to make for faster games which means faster honor grinding since you are more likely to faceroll a less serious premade or a team of randoms.
---
I actually listed them when you asked. I listed them in the comment here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bh06aj/nyah_good_riddance/eltgx0o/
---
You can't fool me. I see those two yugioh cards. But I do miss this board game. Never really had the chance to play fully. But was always intrigued.
---
That link  leads to nothing, and I checked your comment history and can’t find it,
---
I feel like this is going to be one of the main problems people will get with Classic. People will feel like it isn’t the same, and instantly question what’s different but in truth very little will have changed except being 15 years older. 
---
Every bodies first experience of WoW is being a noob, that’s not something you can recreate. But I’m so hyped for it I can’t wait
---
It's the 2010 World of Warcraft Magazine.
---
I have this same memory!  Never played orc after that😂
---
The classic wow will be linked with your retail sub. So if tou pay for a month or two in retail you will be able to log into classic servers!
---
Also, feral druids can tank 5-10 mans with ease because of high TPS (Threat Per Second) so it's not like you are forced to go to dungeons with 2 warriors and share loot. High TPS tank means that you can go nuts with your DPSing.
---
It’s a LOT of fun.
---
Hahaha!
---
I don't really like Westfall, so for me it will be an amalgamation of mostly Darkshore with a splash of Redridge Mountains and Loch Modan to get me to twenty. I will spend the bare minimum time in Westfall to get all the Deadmines quests.
---
From twenty to thirty, I deeply love both Duskwood and Ashenvale but I'm not a fan of Wetlands (can't stand the way it looks and the I don't enjoy the quests either), so I'll do the bare minimum there as well.
---
Hehe I will probably main a Tauren Druid this time around and I will be one of those healers willing to do hundreds of BRD runs. 14 potential items for me there for the heal spec only. Can't wait.
---
I think you should at least get 13 points in BM before going into anything else, pet movespeed and player movespeed help a lot while leveling. Second row of BM is a lot of value as well. In your build you go untill aimed shot but you should take the bonus range talents and then go BM.6 range on every pull saves you a lot of time and its a waste unlocking all the way up to it and then not taking it.
---
Found my old night elf card, here it is https://imgur.com/R390EId
---
What?? Did the rank 10 sets get changed? I had the rank 10 set all through out vanilla and never knew about this. What was changed?
---
I think these sites work with an addon that record what you loot. In the blizzard blue post they said that Ragnaros wasn't killed before patch 1.4 so there might be a lot of high end items missing including Onyxia.
---
At least if the item is in this list you can be pretty sure it will be available in phase 1.
---
how? you cant lose and theres no challenge. its like playing retail
---
No it isn’t it’s in classic
---
No, you don't
---
You're welcome. But read the comment of  [SabotageS-X1](https://www.reddit.com/user/SabotageS-X1) , apparently some items are missing.
---
Nah, subbing gets you everything except the latest expansion
---
If you have retail subscription you can play classic
---
Although this isn't confirmed, I imagine you will be able to just download classic and then pay subscription with out installing retail.
---
Have them come to darkshore and its about lvl 10
---
We already had confirmation that they won't touch things that will alter the community aspect of classic with a ten foot pole, so in the event that we do get them, it'll be in the final phase, and that's a huge if.

Me and my friend tried to get to next zone (from dwarf start to second place) and we go back bc we thought it is impossible game want us to walk that far :) we didn't know vanilla was walking simulation. 
---
Also I remember going to ironforge for the first time and all shocked to see 60s with their mounts :D
---
that reasoning applied to any bad thing breaks opposition to it; how can the world improve with that mentality?
---
That raptor has seen some shit.
---
No, the base game (meaning everything except all the current expansion content) is free. If you have a subscription, you can do all content on retail from Vanilla to Legion.  
---
Since Classic isn't part of BfA, you should also be able to access it by simply setting up a new b.net account and paying the sub.  
---
To be eligible for betas, log into your account, and under Games &amp; Subscriptions scroll all the way down to Beta Settings. You'll be redirected to a new page where you can check the box for Warcraft betas.
---
I was young when I first played. I was wandering aimlessly Dun Morogh and Loch Moran as a dwarf hunter, I think I made it to level 4. I was falling off mountains and entering areas with higher level aggressive mobs. 
---
I remember seeing Rams fly by me and felt like I was being dusted like tumbleweed in the winds.
---
Once I made my way to Ironforge. I saw all the high level players, I would whisper them and ask them how to level. I remember one individual blessed me with one gold coin! I even think I bragged to my friends, ‘One gold, that’s like 100 silver, or 10,000 copper coins! I’m rich now!’ 
---
Finally, I recall seeing the Felsteed for the first time along with the Dresdsteed after that. I was younger at the time, so I just called it a ‘fire horse’ or a ‘hell horse.’ I remember whispering people, unbeknownst to me that they were Warlocks, on how I—A level 4 Dwarf Hunter—could acquire a ‘hell horse.’ I usually got ignored.
---
Also, leveling 1-10 in a day was a skill to my friends and I. We would also make new characters as well with extreme indecisiveness.
---
I’m now playing on LP as a Dwarf Shadow-Disc Priest after not playing WoW in years. I am getting close to level 40... my much needed Ram!
---
Just checked in incognito, and you're right. My guess is that the comment is too long and has probably triggered some shadow deletion where others cannot see it. It's a list of buttons I use in course of raids, when I filtered it down to buttons used in combat that affect my dps it's only 42. I will put it in pastebin.

I've also met a lot of wonderful people on private servers, from all over the place, and my total experience has been great; however, there is definitely a large population of shit-spewers in the chat. There are also more people per server than there were in vanilla so I really don't know if the ratio is any different of it it's just more prevalent because you have more people crammed in the same amount of space.   
---
It could also be partly generational, in that I'm 29 now rather than 14 (in retail) -- and the humor I enjoy now is markedly different than back then when I said a lot of stupid racist/sexist shit thinking I was clever (never really believing it, but playing on the commonly abused stereotypes). Now I find that same shit (i.e. meme culture) to be incredibly obnoxious / "toxic" and want to repeatedly kick my younger self in the nuts. I imagine that may be similar for number of folks.
---
I member!
---
There is no "base game" anymore to purchase. You can create an account and play to level 20 for free. To play beyond that, you'd need to subscribe.
---
(You also need to purchase the latest expansion to play its content (BfA currently) but that's not required for Classic.)
---
[Found it.](https://i.imgur.com/A2xJjzX.png)
---
We are alliance but would love to have you!
---
Ive seen at least a dozen memes of this scene and this is the only one i audibly laughed at.
---
Agreed. I tend to play way later than most people and enjoy grinding, so nighttime was especially enjoyable. With the old-school day/night cycle is was pretty awesome haha
---
Alliance and T W Th depending how much content is on farm.
---
Alliance mate sorry
---
Thank you, it has been so long!
---
Yup!  My group of friends and I are all mid to late 30's, and are looking forward to returning.
---
It won't be perfect, but I'm sure it will be fun.  It just feel like modern wow has forgotten about the journey, and is just so focussed on getting everyone to the destination.
---
Can't wait!
---
I couldn't remember when that had come about, thanks for posting. I do remember not having world chat for quite a long time, having to search for groups in specific zones or spent a large amount of time in IF lagging out haha
---
I flagged myself against him :D but knew I was gonna lose..just wanted to know fast a twink would kill a equal :D. it was fast 🤟
---
Thank you! I forgot how WoW functioned present day. I should have piled up on those ten day free trials. Haha.
---
Well, I’ll get to level 2. Pay for sub. Enable beta settings. Then I should be prime for potential beta and Classic release?
---
I look forward to playing on servers where racist comments will actually get you banned.
---
Ok, I stand corrected then.  Could have swore I did the human version of the level 10 rogue class as a NE back in vanilla.
---
I hope so. Blizzard lost me after WOTLK.
---
Do you think they will use the same installer as the earlier games (nostalgically)?
---
Red is dead. See you in stv big baby bitch
---
Well, that is perfect!
---
Thank you!
---
I love this. Pretty wholesome story tbh. And dont worry about wasting the GMs time. They probably got a good smile out of it and maybe some laughs. Probably had a few other coworkers with them. But you should probably try this when classic comes around. Worst thing: it fails. Best thing: you make a killing doing it.
---
If you notice discrepancies, report them :)
---
Oh my God...the tasteful thickness of it.
---
I've been ganked before, many times. You get some friends and you get them back. No point in being critical over someone's choice to do it to you.
---
If you're corpse killing a low level consistently, you will find yourself at the wrath of some level 60s quickly or be put on a KiS list and pay for it throughout.
---
Unlikely, most will have raid gear before r10
---
I have the same experience. Played on one starting with K. No idea what OP is talking about.
---
How much worse is nelf warrior vs human for tanking?
---
Anal [Hammer of Justice]
---
Did you become a horde player as a result?
---
You can get about 400 from gear alone added to the average 200 base damage. Then you have arcane elixir, elixir of shadowpower, and also debuffs like Shadow Vulnerability, Curse of Shadows, Shadow Weaving.
---
It's perfectly possible, and due to how SoR functions it means the procrate is basically doubled over what a Warrior would experience so it procs a lot. Thats quite a huge increase in DPS actually.
---
Always used to wonder why each race didn't get their own Warlock mount and not just the Generic  Felsteed.
---
The most memorable for me was the first time I did hogger. Someone advertised in local that they needed members for hogger, so I asked to join. And met up with a bunch of lovely people levling alts and knowing what they were about (this was in ~october 2005), and yet perfectly happy to help a complete newbie like myself out. It was such a nice introduction to the social aspect.
---
Demons don't discriminate.
---
Well would'nt you rather you knew who the actual rasist are so you will not associate with them as opposed to them being secretly racist and hiding it so they dont get banned ?
---
doubt
---
Then you'll be happy to know they are indeed in the client, only on max settings. https://youtu.be/6tx0zfziIhE
---
It give the feeling that you are gonna enjoy a wonderful and epic journey with your group of friends riding through the world to increase your power.
---
The Classic client seems to have grass density and BFA water shaders. https://youtu.be/6tx0zfziIhE
---
Good guy demons
---
The difference is honestly negligible, so you can just choose which ever one you want.
---
most griefers camp low levels (eg redridge) and log out for 20 mins when high levels come to kill them
---
why promote "tormenting others"?
---
Mate you are totally over generalizing. I agree with many of your points but when you talk about pserver players as some kind of sickness that will spread over wow I'm gonna have to speak up. 
---
I have played on pservers where the chat was racist as fuck at times and I have met some asholes, like you do online. But the absolute majority of the time I find people on pservers to be extremely kind, helpfull and social. They are classic enthusiast and have been long before there even was talk about blizzard doing classic and many are just people like you and me who wanted to relive wow. 
---
They will not be detrimental to the community. They will enrich it.
---
Why life so difficult
---
I WANT ONE NOW
---
Or just pu a minimum timer of 1 minute where it will attempt to match prioritising people from the same server
---
Meeting the same opponents makes it more personal.. for good and bad.. *slams fist through the wall*
---
Prot paladins have huge glaring problems with their class mechanics, and really poor itemization due to how their threat is based around spelldamage, but all tank gear comes with stats that increase physical DPS.
---
That means while Druids and Warriors can equip regular tank gear and also increase their threat, Paladins cant, and they are stuck wearing either no threat gear, or very little mitigation gear.
---
You CAN make Paladins work, but they are not even close to be as good for raiding as Druids or Warriors.

If anyone is interested in joining a mature guild let me know or check us out!

\*\*&lt;Chaos Theory&gt; - NA \\\[A\\\] EST PVP Server\*\*
---
\*\*Introduction\*\*
---
Greetings! &lt;Chaos Theory&gt; is a mature Alliance, PVE focused guild based out of North America (EST). Our goal is to work toward raiding progression as a raid team. We will be playing on a PVP server for Classic WoW.
---
\*\*Member Expectations\*\*
---
As we prepare for the Classic WoW Launch, we are looking for new members to help us build our core. The main requirements to joining the guild are active participation in Discord, a good/positive attitude, and a desire to progress. We are actively looking for all classes and roles, so now is the opportunity to join at the ground level and help build something special.
---
\*\*Specifics in regards to desired classes/roles:\*\*
---
\* Druid (Tank, Feral DPS, Heal)
---
\* Hunter (BM, Mark)
---
\* Mage (All Specs)
---
\* Paladin (Heal)
---
\* Priest (Heal)
---
\* Rogue (All Specs)
---
\* Warlock (All Specs)
---
\* Warrior (Tank, DPS)
---
\*\*Raid Schedule – Early night EST Raids!\*\*
---
Our raid schedule will be 3 days a week. The core raid days will be Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursdays from \*\*7pm to 10pm EST\*\*. If we complete content early, we will take days off if there isn’t additional content available to clear. We plan to use a hybrid \*\*transparent\*\* form of Loot Council. This will include open dialog with the entire raid and potentially a rotating member of the council.
---
\*\*Next Steps\*\*
---
If this sounds of interest, please join us via Discord to proceed with next steps. We currently have a Discord and Guild Website ready for your enjoyment. We are looking forward to adventuring in Azeroth with you this summer!

---
I agree, Azshara is zone that I miss the most.. Everything after WOTLK just doesn't interest me.
---
My chill route would be Elwyn and dipping through Loch Modan after for a few easy levels while I grab the IF and Loch fp. Obviously not the fastest route though, but Westfall at 10/11 can be tiresome for some classes. 
---
I don’t know why, but for some reason I love Darkshore but despise Ashenvale on both horde and alliance, so I always avoid it as much as possible. 
---
I’d most likely go Elwyn - Westfall - Redridge - Duskwood and minimize travel as much as possible. Dip through Hillsbrad and get a head start on STV quests and maybe even postpone it until 33/34 would be sweet. 
---
I don’t really care about optimal routes, won’t have time to grind out 60 in two weeks either way. I just want to make sure I’m not fighting higher level mobs as a warrior
---
come on man even my grandma knows what that video is
---
Depends how much you like pvp I guess.
---
Not for tanking specifically but humans get bonus to sword skills. Also get slight bonus to spirit.
---
Yeah this is what I responded to a few people earlier. Generational differences in tolerance/humor. I'm 29, I played when I was 14. I'd hate to play with 14 year old me.   
---
100% agreed on the "edgy bullshit". Idk why I even get on reddit, that's 90% of it.
---
We are raiding early evening EST check out my post in this thread and let me know if interested
---
Go at 16 if they don't come to you. 
---
Since aquatic form quest requires an item from darkshore and westall. 
---
At 16 you can also easily go through the quests leading up to Deadmines.
---
Classic. By far.   
---
Classic has warmer colors which I much prefer.  That combined with the old lighting creates this fuzzy bloom that I find very pleasant. 
---
Then there's the draw distance - the world genuinely feels much bigger and more magical when you can't see that far (ironically enough), so I don't like the fact that you can clearly see mountains on the other side of the zone.
---
I prefer the old water to the new only because it is moving and it feels more alive that way, but I do appreciate the reflections, foam and higher resolution of the new water. It just feels dead to me though, like every body of water behaves like a puddle or small pond.
---
Yaaaasssss
---
Remember ye duty tae Azeroth!
---
Because jerks gonna jerk. 
---
Nothing we can do about it.
---
This becomes harder with xrealms thou, so atleast we wont get those dodge premades. they will have to dodge in the games they enter.  
---
And that is a possitive thing about xrealm, besides the better que times.  
---
But if you are worried about you wont see the other faction, i dont think you should. I mean if you dont meet them in bg's you will see them in BRD, world bosses or at other places, pvp guilds like to kill other guilds.
---
Again, not promoting either for or against only asking. I was ganked in Vanilla and I expect some will do the same in Classic to replicate the experience.
---
The hardest choices require the strongest wills.
---
I'm basically a #nochanges guy, I guess.
---
We knew from the beginning that we wouldn't get everything we wanted.
---
The point is to have *as few changes as possible* by pushing back and being vocal. If there were no #nochanges guys, who knows where we would end up. 
---
I'm quite happy the way it's going. Would have liked to have old AV though.
---
&gt;Ian Hotzitakostos
---
 I've read this thread for 5 minutes, and seen people having pissing matches over "euros are the worst", "americans are the worst", "pservers are just full of toxic players", "you sound like a weenie if you were ever offended on a pserver", etc ...   
---
You've received more down-votes than most of the instigators of those arguments. \*sigh\* Sorry buddy. I hope it will be good too, and that this sub won't necessarily be an accurate portrayal of the communities we respectively join.
---
Just say nickers and stop beating around the bush.
---
Vanilla has been out for a while already...
---
Hogger, period.
---
Will you pvp or pve more? In case of pvp I find night elf more fun  because you can charge from shadowmeld. The 1% dodge is not bad but nothing you couldn't get with gear. Humans get sword and mace skill which is huge in pve (more consistent dmg = more threat). Items that give weapon skill are very few and they are hard to get.
---
They did ironforge pretty dirty but it was cool
---
&gt;I know there are always some purists
---
Correction: There are always some people who don't get what a recreation means, and think if they whine enough, or make enough posts that are meant to superficially look like "discussions" but are really just pathetic begging to have the BS of BfA being piled onto Classuc, they get what they want.
---
No, there will be no quest highlighting. There will be no aid for people too lazy to even look it up on a website. You wither play the game it is intended to be played, or you can stay in BfA, **end of discussion.**
---
Thank you, this makes a lot more sense to me. Although I’m still fine with them not implementing progressive itemisation, I can definitely see your point! I just don’t think the original post got it across very well. (Or maybe I just kept reading it wrong, also very possible.)
---
I won’t go into counter arguments simply because I feel like the other comments in this thread have made any point I would, and probably more clearly. Either way, I don’t feel like this is something we will be able to change blizzards mind in even with a bit of fuss. I reckon it’s actually quite a bit more work/hassle than other points like which version of AV, or how they re-implemented spell batching.
---
That’s nice! :D
---
All you're going to get from here is #nochanges man. Someone should really make a subreddit for things like WoW: Remastered (tentative title) where we have servers that go back and take lessons learned from WoW's history but rebuild the game with more traditional ideals in mind.
---
Did somebody say [Thunderfury the blessed blade of the windseeker]
---
I don't think many people would argue that Classic should *change* into BC. And I'm sure Blizzard is not *that* stupid to do it. :)
---
What is however undeniable that a lot of people like expansions, BC in particular.
---
Blizzard already has the Classic team. After Vanilla they have better backups. It's a no brainer for them. Just release all expansions (as separate servers) eventually. It's a relatively low effort, high reward project. When they can play their favorite expansion(s), a lot of people will basically never unsubscribe.
---
Uh, no, they weren’t in the demo. It’s still very unclear whether (no pun intended) they will be in the game or not.
---
I was genuinely slightly excited :(
---
Hahaha, alright. Hopefullt Blizz adds it if they haven’t already!
---
&gt; There will be no aid for people too lazy to even look it up on a website.
---
I never really understood that argument. Like what point are you trying to make? Obviously you DO want to look it up, or else you wouldnt want to go to a website. So you just want a more contrived experience, which is something I dont understand.
---
&gt; intended to be played, or you can stay in BfA, **end of discussion.**
---
 lol. what is wrong with you. Are you a game designed at Blizzard? You have no idea how the game was intended to be played. Maybe decisions were made on resource/time constraints.
---
Youd have to be racist to think it sounds racist.
---
(Not OP but) I wasn’t that bothered about progressive itemisation, though one big point you raised which I didn’t think about much is the PVP gear.
---
If I’m not mistaken, PVP gear was buffed to keep up with new raid content rather than say, fixing wacky itemisation like the well touted spirit helm. For this reason I feel like the upgraded PVP gear should be considered more of a content gated update, by their definition, than some of the other items.
---
So much hate in this comment
---
&gt;When has Blizzard ever recognized cross-realm bgs as a mistake? What leads you to believe that?
---
They have in general pointed out that it is important for vanilla communities to be limited to one server, however proof of this philosophy in Classic has thus far not extended to beyond the world/PvE, and the unknown of BG's still remains.
---
Also, I'd just like to point out that you can't win this debate by arguing it as a "fix". There are people like me who would prefer 1+ hour queues over x-realm BG's, because x-realm BG's is literally a non-feature to me. At least when there are 1+ hour queues I'll queue up and go do something else and still do some BG's in the end. X-realm just means I don't even acknowledge the existence of the battlemasters because I'd rather do literally anything else than waste my time PvP'ing against people I will never see again.
---
The most you'll ever get out of me on this topic is consent to make battlegrounps of 2-4 servers, maybe 5. Anything more and everything devolves into a clusterfuck of anonymous. But frankly even that much is an atrocity.
---
Honestly man, this seems like one of the most baseless complaints I've ever seen about anything. The people who complain about the report system in WoW, are generally people who should have been reported and banned several times prior to the time that it actually occurred. I've literally never sought out, used, or thought about the report button in game because I don't act like a total fucking douche. It's actually easier to NOT be a douche than it is to go out of your way to intentionally upset people. 
---
I'm curious what opinions you think you'll be reported for.
---
Why does it not have Warcraft music? There’s so much to choose from!
---
Would’ve made it really cool.
---
I felt proud of myself wh n I played WOW and felt pity on people who didn't play video games and what they were missing.
---
Today I don't feel like that but man if I have ever used a product in my life and that has given me some best moments that will be original WOW.
---
There's already a gender neutral choice in the game : "male" nelf.
---
It's obviously not a male and not a female either :o
---
You got jokes aye?
---
H
---
No the trick is trying to be nice and caring and then still getting shot down
---
It’s not as simple as that sadly. They would obviously put them in there if not for the fact that the weather system was completely revamped in a later expansion. It might not be possible.
---
Running a premade and strategizing honor gains isn't against the ToS; there isn't much that Blizzard can do about it.
---
I'm not sure why you're bringing up "cross faction collusion."
---
These people usually travel in (well armed) pack.
---
I know you are joking but what's up with all the hate on Europeans on this sub? Being Swedish, I'm wondering a bit what the hell I did to upset so many Americans. 
---
Europe consists of many very different countries and probably close to half the people here are European but from very different places. So what's the point in generalising and calling us all trash etc. 
---
Tldr: Why you hef to be mad?
---
I've been in the Alpha client, and it looks like the weather effects are the Vanilla style.
---
This is in fact impossible! You will reach lvl 2 from exploration xp before you get there 😎
---
Beeeecause...this is a remake of the Game of Thrones intro?
---
What is the "squishest" class? or are all clothies equally squishy?
---
Accusing something of "hate" is a hallmark of people who know they are defending bullshit, but aren't even creatinve enought to come up with good lies in defense of said bullshit.
---
How often do you guys reckon you'll rely on 2h weapons and their animations as a Warrior? 
---
I really hate the 2h animations on Human, Dwarf, Troll and Tauren when I'd be happy to play them otherwise. 
---
At this stage leaning towards orc or undead as their animations are universally good imo.
---
I just want a fking release date.
---
Queen slay
---
Iiiiiiiiiiin... the Warcraft universe?
---
&gt;You have no idea how the game was intended to be played.
---
Yes I do sunshine, because I played it.
---
You don't need anything more than a Threat Weapon in order to increase threats as Paladin , Consumes will do that job for you.
---
You are also wrong that Physical DPS doesn't increase Paladin threats, while Warriors increase Physical DPS threats by 10% thanks to Def Stance , they reduce the same % thanks to slower swings.
---
Paladin in other hand have 10% increased to Physical DPS thanks to One-Handed Weapon Spec without slow swings Penalty.
---
While Warrior depend on Physical DPS in order to make good threats, Paladin increase threats with both Physical 10% and Spell DPS 90%. 
---
If you watch the Video , then you are going to see how different is Paladin Gearing than you state here in this reply.
---
Why is this getting downvoted. Aimed Shot should never be downranked. Multi-Shot still does decent damage at lower ranks while saving quite a bit of mana. However, you should bring mana potions (easily farmed from tribute runs) and demonic runes to never run out of mana.
---
looks like cadaverous set is going to be bis option for all dps classes(together with devilsaur)
---
as a hunter  with cadaver set u will have 850ish attack power with around 284-327ish dmg
---
with 9% hit chance (u need 9% - some say 8 is fine but i always went with 9) and 12ish% crit chance (5 from talents 5 from gear and around 2+ from agility)(163ish agility)
---
with devilsaur set and frostbite girdle and bloodmail boots u will have 805ish attack power with 273-316ish dmg
---
with 10% hit and 3 additional crit chance(14ish%)(187ish agility) (which can be translated to 180ish agility some say 1 crit is 59 i just round it up to 60)
---
also cadaver set up gives around 100 more hp while devilsaur gives around 100 more mana and 200 more armor
---
both set ups use mask of unforgiven/truestrike shoulders/cape of black baron/slashclaw bracers/blackstone ring/painweaver band/blackhand and  hoj(i dont think getting hoj as a hunter will be that hard if u join groups with tanks farming for ironfoe)
---
blackcrow and dalrends set (which i consider to be bad choice as a hunter mainly because of how many mdps will try to get that item and instead i would advise to use dreadforge retaliator which gives 30 attack power - 20 less than dalrends but 1 extra crit and has decent weapon dmg)
---
 blackdragonscale can work as well and it will be very close to stats of devilsaur with addition of extra fire res(however there is an issue of 8% hit which can be taken from survival tree instead of going mm/bm and that would add 2 extra cit on top of devilosaur set up which can be again translated into another 120 agility)
---
i personally am very happy that cadaver gives super viable option for gearing up a dps class without the need of devilsaur set (of course there always were option with leather pants from ubrs and voons gloves but thats  another discussion)
---
im not including any comparisons with ppl that will go super tryhard with arcanite reapers and dwarfs with dwarven handcannons , trinket switches etc
---
looks like both sets are very close and fully viable as pre raid bis
---
Thank You!! More to come :)
---
Honestly man it was clear enough in the original post. You never said anything even remotely close to "PvP = toxic". Dude's arguing to argue.
---
&gt; So you just want a more contrived experience
---
Can you please define the word "contrived" as you're using it here, so I better understand how to respond?
---
&gt;	They even offer support to the tanks like each doing a sunder on pull so tank doesn’t have to spam it.
---
Isn’t sunder to generate threat and not to apply the debuff? Seems counterproductive for a dps with no threat lowering abilities to be spamming a high threat ability while the tank is still establishing threat
---
Max rank kick does like 70 damage. I'll keep rank 1 only.
---
I want people to start using the search function so we dont have 20 of these threads posted every day.
---
No Undercity 😭
---
Contrived: “Created in a way that seems artificial”
---
Me too. Sooo..?
---
He's about to "yikes"-post you. Brace yourself.
---
Sooo much hate
---
Same. Well. I don't like gnomes at all, their presence irks me.
---
I started in Vanilla alone without friends so had no reason to go alliance dispute my anti-gnome sentiment.
---
I kinda hope to have a reason to compel me to go alliance this time, but seeing once again no friends will be playing once again...
---
I'd love that. It's an interesting conversation to have and I understand why people want to have it. It's a horrible conversation to have here where Blizzard might check in for the pulse of the player base, though perhaps not as potentially damaging as it once might have been since things should be pretty far along.
---
Rearrangable character selection list.
---
If it takes 10 days /played that's still 4 hours of playing per day to be 60 within 2 months. That's still alot of time for most with kids, job and so on. 
---
If we can cut down leveling to 8 days /played, that's 3h12min per day.
---
Sooo, you have 2 options:
---
* If you want the bullshit quest highlighting, that made people ignore the game world and stare at their minimap instead of reading questtexts or finding their way through the world, you are welcome to stay in BattleForAccountloss
---
* You can stop whining and accept reality.
---
Yoooooou got a point.
---
But I think it would ruin the intended effect.
---
I was with you until you hit the condescension button.
---
The former part, no so much, but the latter? Definately. (Multiplayer) games nowadays aren't made for sessions that last for multiple hours.
---
Nope. Die to an enemy in the starter and ghost run all the way to Elwynn Forest. Or if they have a level 20+ Warlock friend, they could just summon you.
---
As long as you switch continents at least once it resets your spawn point to whichever spirit healer you talk to.
---
This was changed in Wrath or so, but I do fully expect it to work in classic, or be implemented if they miss it.
---
We didn't have those, but our local banks have had the service that you can choose your own picture (any picture) on your card for years. I had one made with the original Black Lotus artwork on it (Magic the Gathering card Black Lotus)  Obviously there were rules like no pornographic images or copyrighted art, but this Lotus picture was obscure enough to pass and  am sure I could have used some WoW related picture for those cards as long as it wasn't with blizzard logos etc.
---
This was fun to watch stoned. Loved the video!

I honestly couldn't give less of a rats a\* if you are "with me" or not. I stand by what I said, if you don't like it, that's not my problem.

Or something like that.
---
You guys looks so full of life here, please take a picture 3 months after release as well.
---
I don't know, not sure many people actually have a lot of experience and so they tend to listen to what sounds logical, which in Vanilla often isn't necessarily the right thing. Thanks for the support, though.
---
&gt;Do you think they will use the same installer as the earlier games (nostalgically)?
---
No, because they (understandably) want Classic integrated into their product tool-and-distribution chain. It wouldn't make sense to have it seperately, also, this won't have an impact on the feel of the actual game.
---
But of you want, you could cut out this:

---
Cross faction collusion is against their ToS actually. But you're right, proving it is the hard part. With streaming and bnet integration, though, maybe some people will be dumb enough to out themselves
---
As someone who played on a very small Australian pservers it was amazing. There were only 5 guilds that finished even mc and you knew everyone's name.
---
Teldrassil -&gt; Darkshore -&gt; Ashenvale
---
Fair enough.
---
Yeah, that's for sure.  In a WoW with very limited AoE options, any threat at all is better than 0.  Even Bloodrage is fine to use just so an incidental buff cast doesn't make them go to someone else.
---
As an aside, I realized I may have gotten a couple things slightly wrong, but I think the general idea holds about Thunder Clap being a decent damage taken reducer and Demoralizing/Battle Shout being better-than-nothing threat although things may get weird in a huge mob (8+ enemies).
---
What I'm not sure about is how Thunder Clap's threat actually compares to Demoralizing Shout because Thunder Clap has to be used in Battle Stance, but of course you would use Demoralizing Shout in Defensive Stance.
---
dont remenber but actually want one
---
Would be great to have rest of the cities as well. (And IF could use a better one imo)
---
Still very good. Maker of this, be proud.
---
What is it
---
I would gladly join a Dwarf only guild
---
Impossible. Too much alternative and *cheaper* entertainment. Besides, far too many developers already tried this - during 2010-2014 there was this massive amount of MMO titles being worked on, released and then cancelled or going into micro-transaction hell.
---
I'd say WoW was released at the perfect time. Early enough not to get caught in the quagmire, late enough for most people in the civilized world to have access to broadband Internet.
---
Damn, tough luck. I'm from a small European country, so maybe that helps as well.
---
It doesn't matter whether the comminity thinks it's a fix, it matters whether or not Blizzard considered it a fix at the time. It's just like what they said about itemization. The community wants progressive itemization and they said that the stat changes were a fix for bad stats on items, so since it was considered a fix to an issue, they are keeping the 1.12 itemization.
---
Also the "cross-realm" battlegrounds in vanilla *were* in battlegroups, not all servers being connected. You still saw the same people within your battlegroup all the time in retail vanilla.
---
Outside of leveling, 2h weapons are used almost 99% exclusively for PvP, so there’s generally a lot of movement involved. Might make the animations a little less noticeable.
---
Thank you man!
---
Westfall 1-60
---
Technically having battlegroups wouldn't be changing the social aspect, it would be implementing a feature that existed in 1.12 retail vanilla. It's not like adding LFG or something where it wasn't even in vanilla (I know, meeting stones, you know what I mean.)
---
I am hoping to see no cross-realm BGs at the start and once/if server populations are dwindeling they should add battlegroups.
---
To add to this. As a warlock i have never come across a class i cant beat 1v1. Even stealth ganked by rogue. 
---
1v1....
---
If im out number its a bit different
---
I think it´s mage, because they have the lowest healthpools. Got a lot of survivability though
---
IMO, mages. But they’re also the most difficult to CC, and they have a lot of counter-abilities and the best CC in the game.
---
But, if you can catch one afk or with no CD’s, they die super quick. Especially if you can purge/dispel their buffs.
---
Imagine turning a Quiet, Mysterious Scary Autumn Forest into a Goblin Playground with a Highway...

It hurt to lose Original Azshara.

lets be brutally honest, with #4 you're talking about mass amounts of Chinese gold farmers and spammers.  and i am totally not going to miss that at all
---
This is really the best answer
---
I can’t decide on what horde race but I will be warrior tanking. I know Tauren has the stamina but what else is good? Or is Tauren the best?
---
on my last pserver i played resto druid and while i didnt generally top the healing i was ALWAYS lowest on overhealing.  i was proud to get around top 3-5 HPS while being the most efficient!
---
Is there challenging raid content for smaller groups or do you have to be in a guild with 40+ people?
---
My group of friends wants to start WoW classic when it comes out but having to join a massive guild for raiding may be a deal breaker...
---
Well, lets list it. And to be fair, lets ignore Druids.  
---
Human -  No enrage dispell  
---
Dwarf - No Warlock/Mage  
---
Gnome - No Heals  
---
NE - No Casters  
---
So Human would have best chance ?
---
Its cus your hogging all that Knaeckebrut
---
I'm so hyped for classic right now!
---
A friend of mine rerolled his lvl36 orc hunter because his skinning skill was not high enough to skin lvl 30+ mobs. He didn't want to steal the mobs from the poor low level players. He never catched up again but at least he got his lvl 40 mount before TBC came out. lol
---
Ten years ago I had this picture as on my credit card, no colors on the numbers on front and a tiny visa logo in the corner:  
---
https://i.imgur.com/CZqG9SB.jpg
---
It would have been a really good thing with PI in regards to warrior spikes though. Even sub 1.12 stats, they are at the top of the damage meter. This change effectively puts them even higher. 
---
If anything it’s the class that get’s the least screwed over by this since their alternatives are as good as the alternatives for a rogue. 
---
The main concern is the PvP gear though. Ir’s too strong and saying that it’s hard to get and that only a few people will get them is a poor argument that would never have merit on retail. 
---
It feels like people aren’t against this particularly because a) it doesn’t affect them that much and b) it might make them feel their argument for 1.12 stats on everything else is invalid. 
---
Both of those arguments are selfish though. Anyone with an interest in keeping the game as balanced as possible withour sacrificing authenticity too much knows that this is a major flaw. And what bothers me and others is that Blizzard are aware of it - yet decides to make it a black and white thing. Why not use the pre-1.12 PvP items? Or better yet... Why not use pre-1.12 items on some of the crazy strong items like BRE and Savage Gladiator Chain? 
---
All changes on items done up to 1.12 wasn’t just to create a really shitty gear, useful. It was also to make the shitty gear useful for AQ40 as a catch-up mechanic. 
---
There’s a big difference between making a really shitty item useful for Molten Core vs. making a really shitty item useful for AQ40. 
---
If the problem is that changing stats confuses people how about just removing the items nobody was going to use prior to their upgrades entirely and add them back with other items that was added later as well. 
---
It doesn’t have to be all or nothing despite whatever Blizzard is trying to convince us. If the demand for it was there, they’d acknowledge it.
---
Fuck I would get all of them
---
Amazing work bro!!
---
Yeah, I was at least expecting that the lava pours in at the end of the animation.
---
I'm so happy about auto loot being in the alpha.  I don't use WASD so Shift modifiers are off the table for me and it makes looting a pain when it should be enjoyable.
---
Very very happy.
---
If you intend to play a warrior, you must be willing to tank at least sometimes. If you don't at least attempt to maintain a tanking set and are willing to step into the OT roll on occasion, you're not a real warrior. 
---
That said, fury is great, and only gets better as  the game's lifespan goes on, so you may end up spending all/most of your time dpsing, if that's what you want to do.
---
All just my opinion of course.
---
Thanks for Helping me out, some people are still unaware of the fact that Paladin is not bad. Some people would still not believe even if they saw it.

The Items I have on my list for an easy achievable Healer Set were in the list.
---
So it was really helpful.
---
Major mana pot and [Demonic runes](http://classicdb.ch/?item=12662) should take care of your mana problems. They do not share a cooldown. You can farm them from satyrs in felwood or Azshara. It is what all healers use to keep a healthy mana pool. Have not raided as a hunter though.
---
The raiding guild I was in during Vanilla was called Sons of Ironforge. It was originally an all dwarf guild but eventually the GM let all races in once they started focusing on preparing for 40 mans.
---
10 man blackrock dungs
---
I thought mouseover wasn’t a thing in vanilla?
---
Sunder is mediocre threat generation compared to revenge/shield slam, you aren't going to pull aggro off a main tank with a single sunder.
---
holy shit i forgot about that one!
---
You're the only one talking about cross faction collusion though.
---
I think that queue dodging is a grey area that Blizzard won't punish players for.
---
&gt;It doesn't matter whether the comminity thinks it's a fix, it matters whether or not Blizzard considered it a fix
---
Mate if this game was up to Blizzard we'd not have ever seen it again.
---
&gt;You still saw the same people within your battlegroup all the time in retail vanilla.
---
No you didn't. You probably just had the joy of being on a small battlegroup, as there were a few with only 3-6 servers. I was on one with like 16-18 servers. You never saw anyone again.
---
Hi, /u/GenderJuicer
---
thats like saying "why dont we get tauren paladins that use nature magic".  it just sort of goes against the mythology-inspired theme
---
As far as we can tell, content will follow the phase system, but itemization will be based on 1.12.1. So expect those items to be available in Phase 1.
---
Trolls have highest Threat per Second
---
Yeah, me too - but I work with some program developers who are well into their 60’s, and I wouldn’t doubt their abilities with a keyboard/mouse. They could be absolutely lethal - and then they could write an app to run the game for them when they’re bored...
---
I wonder if there's a boss that would be super easy thanks to raid wide stoneform.
---
I hope the nights are as dark as the original vanilla game was, the immersion was great
---
Orc Warlock OP
---
Maybe something in ZG, or AQ.
---
 **Viscidus** in AQ40, would be fun
---
If it was up to us we'd have progressive itemization and no loot trading.
---
You might be new to this sub. But when you see people day in day out try to destroy classic instead of going back to BfA where all them features are already available, people develop a short fuse.
---
Classic is *not* your forum trying to make something new. If you find fault in the Mona Lisa, you don't go around advocating for the Luvre to butcher the painting in their possession.
---
&gt;Everyone you fought were terrible players.
---
That's the point of being Lv8 doofus.
---
Seriously, why do so many people think that the "redditor has evolved" and making a valid point will be too easy?  Clearly the pro redditors are a big minority.  Casual redditors just don't care about commenting right.
---
Ok? So since I'm the only one talking about it makes it less factual that it happens or that it's against ToS?
---
no its gonna be part of the [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) Launcher.
---
None.
---
Actually what are the 'can't skip' classes if you want to clear all raid content?
---
Hunter for enrage.
---
Lock for banish in Mc (could be off tanked though) and shadow resist tanking in aq40.
---
Warrior for tanking (not an issue)
---
Anything else? Or are we just talking about inconvenience instead of impossible?
---
To see the contrast? :)
---
I'm 25. Can't wait to get called “the kid“ again.
---
Nelf and troll would both be fine. The essentials are hunters, priests and a way to remove curse. As long as you have those bases covered I think you could kill every boss ok.
---
Or 50 men and 20 gnomes. Imagine the possibilities!
---
You should teach your sibling that WoW is a fantasy game where they can imagine anything they like, instead of letting them believe that a fantasy game is somehow trying to be exclusive.
---
At cemmetery ! For The Horde!
---
Isnt that exactly what you are advocating for? How does a magic inapt warrior's quest traveling/quest journal magically develop the ability to highlight zones your character does not even know exist? 
---
It's inconsistent with the game world and tears down game immersion. 
---
All I can say to sum this up: "I have been chosen by the big *metal hand in the sky*!"
---
Dual specc 🙄 gimme all the hate you got!
---
Better surround the devilsaur with campfires.
---
No remove curse would make some things impossible  I think (ie dwarves).
---
My post seems to have been misinterpreted as a personal attack on OP. All I'm doing is pointing out the fact that casual players are a majority against the misconception people are spreading about the game. If you're going to backpedal like that hunter, you're probably still gonna backpedal at 60.
---
&gt; It's an interesting conversation to have
---
Sure, just not 20 times per day, every day
---
Dude is this board game awesome??!
---
tbf, undeads are most likely gender neutral. The sex organs are the first to be eaten when a corpse starts rotting.
---
World of warcraft is a feeling
---
I used to distract people running and send them into mobs or in the opposite direction before they realised. Most people running have auto run on.
---
&gt;eventually the GM let all races in 
---
Males only, beards mandatory.
---
I wanted to play the game. Just didn’t want to learn how lol. Same with DnD
---
&gt; can fortnite say the same?
---
Warcraft belongs to the Nerds!
---
That's not inline with Blizzard's [last blue post.](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/itemization-in-wow-classic/160757)  
---
&gt;Developers have scoured through vendor lists and treasure tables for items that were added in patches, and then attached them to the staged content unlock plan. This means that if a new item was originally added to a dungeon boss’s loot table with Ahn’Qiraj, you shouldn’t expect it to appear in WoW Classic until Phase 5, which is the phase that contains Ahn’Qiraj content.  
---
Everything will have its 1.12 stats, but won't start dropping until it did in vanilla.
---
Good point!
---
Am I the only one who can't help but grin at the fact that this Michael-Jackson standin-Nightelf spends half the video dancong around a young boy? ^^
---
Your OP?
---
But why.
---
this is just superb :)
---
I’m thinking of rolling a Tauren, but I haven’t really played Horde in ages. What’s your personal favourite route to take from, say, level 1-30? 
---
(Not necessarily from an efficiency standpoint - I’m mostly thinking lorewise and not-to-miss questlines and zones.)
---
Glad to see that childish tantrum didn't keep the site down for good.
---
Hi frost, 
---
Whilst your videos reveal nothing new to me, I really enjoy them for the lore you share, the music and the quality of production.
---
Keep up the good work! 
---
Cheers
---
The sub fee mostly, lol.
---
I've not seen it once on this subreddit. People rightfully descend upon posts inviting it and...kindly....remind the OP not to play with black magic that they cannot control. If my calculations are correct that's 0 times per day  on no days. 
---
Perhaps it's a topic that opens up once Classic is released in a non-fucked format because, once the product exists, I wouldn't be too worried about Blizzard getting evil ideas again.
---
Are you sure it was the admiral's hat? According to Wowhead(classic) the quest for it requires level 30, which is about that I remembered too. 
---
Maybe your're thinking about the other one that got really popular among sub-level-30 twinks:
---
* [Lucky Fishing Hat](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19972/lucky-fishing-hat) which could be earned during the Stranglethorn Fishing Contest.
---
**High:** Warriors, Warlock, Mage, Priest  
---
**Medium:** Paladin, Rogue  
---
**Low**: Hunter, Druid   
---
This would be accurate ?
---
ITT: people act like they constantly knew their BG opponents, or that groups somehow prevent that.
---
The funny thing is, i prefer p-server community over non existent community on retail.
---
I think there is a case to knowing familiar faces if you are on the rank grind with a premade and face other rank grinders and premades.
---
Sort by new, and you will see a post asking about changes every few hours.
---
They all get downvoted to hell, so they never make it front page, thankfully
---
Will dungeons like Stratholme or Scholomance be raidable? like 20 or 30+ people.
---
You need hunter for chromagg and huhu but can make do without for the other tranq fights.
---
Wait what .  when did Paladins ever become bad healers?
---
Premades avoid premades tho
---
I don't like Darkshore as great as it is for leveling, but Teld and Ashen are my two favourite zones!
---
A fair amount of people who look back with perspective.
---
Vanilla through Wrath all followed classic's core design principles, just with minor tweaks and twists to fix the issues that cropped up over time, just like they did throughout Vanilla and TBC.
---
Cata was where the classic era truly ended. Locking you to a single talent tree until you'd spent 31 points, removing free to mess with talents. Massively re-designing classes and specs on a level that made them nearly unrecognizable compared to even their wrath incarnations.
---
TBC was mostly just polishing the existing mechanics and trying out new class synergies, while wrath was mostly about further refining classes that worked well enough by default, while spreading the love of some of the strongest synergies to specs that were ok gameplay-wise but weaker in terms of group synergy.
---
But not falling into the trap of Cata onwards of wanting every class to be able to do every thing. They still had sufficient unique identity, even if there was a bit of homogenization with regard to some of the most powerful group abilities.
---
Cata though is a turning point expansion. It's a messy hybrid of both the old style and the birth of the new style.
---
Where as Pandaria was first expansion fully committed to the new style of WoW.
---
Nope, 5 man only.
---
I always wonder if companies use ddos attacks as an excuse for fucked up launches.
---
I mean, who can proof if there really is an attack or if their servers are just too weak for all the people trying to log in.
---
yeah i thought about this aswell, but that the only fight, we really need them. so we dont need them in guild ? we can hire a mercenary hunter from chat ?
---
I'm pretty sure I did a bit of all of those except Daskshore in my original leveling of my main.
---
I took many months, though. Maybe not an example to follow.
---
Why 21/0/30 and not 20/0/31? Isn't an extra CC just better than 1 spell crit?
---
Entering Ironforge for the first time.
---
I was a dwarf rogue and it was a magical moment, made me feel so small and full of awe.
---
No Tauren damage dealers? Eh?
---
I have just started paying attention to Classic, and you are one of the few reasonable nochange people I have seen. 
---
That being said, I don't understand why people care about something that doesn't effect their game. If updated graphics and models is a purely cosmetic, optional thing, then who cares if other people use it? 
---
I saw someone on the official forums say "I never got to play Vanilla wow, so I want everything exactly the way it was". That guy is going to quit playing after a week. Classic servers aren't for people who never played it, it's for people who did and want a nostalgia trip. 
---
I haven't seen a single person say "Oh man, I can't wait to bandage/eat/drink after every single pull" Or "I can't wait to rebuff myself every 5/10/15 minutes". Or "Man, I can't wait to get ganked in Booty Bay 16 times while I'm trying to get to the Flight Master". That's not even mentioning waiting 45 minutes for your 40 man raid to all to get to Molten Core, or having to do the actual quintessence quest.
---
I imagine Classic is going to be comprised of mostly players who started in Vanilla and want a change of pace from what WoW has become, and maybe 1/3 of the players who never played Vanilla will actually stick it out.
---
yes, no mages,warlocks, rogues
---
When were quest exclamation marks added to the minimap? I definitely lean #nochanges so I don't mind if they're not there (despite liking that change) but I played vanilla since (EU) launch in 2005 and I could have sworn that was added before TBC.
---
Saying that, I can barely remember my own name most days so...
---
I was really excited during Vanilla when Cross Realm BGs were announced because I was on a server with a huge faction imbalance. It doesn't really matter if you are on a low pop or high pop server, if there is a faction imbalance than the queue times are going to be really long. I don't need constantly instant queues, but at the same time its not fun waiting 30/45 minutes just for one WSG game. 
---
If you want to do PVE content you can always coordinate times with your guild, but for PvP/BGs there's nothing you can do if your queue times are long. I don't want to be restricted in how I play just because I picked a server that turned out to have a faction imbalance.

Seemed so crazy for me!
---
A recent extremely popular -dale server has a pretty loud population.   Farming anything high end outdoor is also a nightmare.  Paladins will log in 3 seconds before a lotus spawns , bubble, herb, log out.  Kind of fascinating how locked they have it but I guess it's nearly effort free gold.  Devilsaur mafia also similar.  Just too many people chasing too few resources and racism is a handy way to express that anger.

it was the opposite for me, i loved generating threat and keeping it on multiple targets...hated having insta threat and managing my health in wotlk

This whole discussion turned into a ticking time bomb and has been removed/locked.

In middle school P.E., we had a section dedicated to dancing. Learned things like the Electric Slide and Thriller, among others. At the end of the section, we had to form dance groups and apply what we learned to make our own dance to a piece of music selected by the P.E. teachers. We also had to make a name for our dance group, which the teachers would announce as we took the stage. I was the new kid that year, and got saddled with the kids that were left over after everybody else partnered up with their friends, but the nice thing about it was that the other kids in my group were pretty spineless, so they were easily persuaded towards my suggestions. In the end, I convinced them to name our group Malicious Goiter Syndrome, and hearing one of the P.E. teachers actually say that out loud through the microphone was a true highlight of my time in middle school.
---
But yeah, when I was in middle school, if anybody knew you played WoW, you'd get a lot of shit for it.
---
I mean that it was irrelevant to the point I was making.
---
Aside from the 20 man raids ZG and AQ20, it might be viable for your guild to seek out other smaller guilds in order to form an alliance for the bigger raids.
---
Back in the day and even nowadays on private servers there were plenty of smaller guilds (mostly friends that played together) that formed alliances with other smaller, likeminded, guilds to tackle the bigger 40-man raids.
---
It’s an easy way to take a look at the 40 man stuff while still preserving the feel of a small community guild. Plenty of bigger guilds start out with an alliance of smaller guilds that found their communities are compatible/likeminded enough and fused together to make the organization easier.
---
You can kinda manage with no tranq shot, although it's not advised. But you can't do without curse/poison cleanse.
---
I'd say the best race would be trolls. You have decurse with mages, you have poison cleanse with shamans, you have magic dispel with priests. You have rogues for supp room. You have hunters for tranq shot. And obviously you have warriors for tanks and big D DPS. Warlocks and druids aren't mandatory anywhere.

---
Also wondering this. I downloaded questie for the marks, but there doesn’t seem to be a way to only have the marks present on the minimal, and remove objectives from the mini and main map
---
How about requiring an invite from a friend if you try to roll an overpopulated faction? That way you still allow people to play together and solve part of the problem.
---
no to see the cactus growing
---
Yeah I definitely wouldn't want objectives marked on the map or any pointers for quest completion. I appreciate that not having quest markers on the minimap also encourages exploration (to an extent) but I felt they were a good change, whenever that actually happened.
---
While Blizzard hasn’t specifically talked about those dungeons yet, they seem to base everything on the game-balance side of things for Classic on patch 1.12.
---
If that’s the case then all dungeons besides raids and LBRS/UBRS (which are technically also raids) will probably be 5 man only.
---
Leaving Teldrassil for the first time on a Gryphon. I thought the starting zone was big, and Darnassus was huge! But honestly, I had no idea what I was doing and never expanded the map. When I got on the Gryphon to Auberdine and saw the scale of the whole word...*mind blown*

(Alternating between those two a bit until 30)
---
That's just top of my head, probably inefficient, but covers all the main horde story, especially any Tauren related stuff.
---
I finally decided on one and stuck with it. Took forever
---
what a lad squad!
---
Right.. because there is no undercity.. lol
---
That's like 16hours per day 🤯

get him outta here
---
Undead have Will of the Forsaken and Orc have stun resist, both have there benefits, especially in dungeons.
---
Made me laugh far more than it should have
---
bahahah I did wonder if anyone would see that, nfi how they got in there...
---
On the very top they do. I dount the rank 8-12 premades did that too much
---
I mean it it possible. 10-12 hours a day on the weekends and 4-5hours a day during the week. Wont leave much time for anything else tho.
---
Play dual wield, it's not as efficient/cheap as 2h while leveling, but it's strong as heck at 60 with the right gear, and it's my personal preference for playstyle.
---
The one that doesnt have me buy a fucking target dummy
---
All the minmaxing nerds on here are going to go to loch modan and redridge so obviously I will be going to ashenvale
---
This is great. Thanks! If you don’t mind me asking - what are your favourite Horde zones?
---
You actually nailed it. Sadly, thats the one part of Classic that we can never get back. That feeling of everything being new and unexplored. You had no idea what was around the next bend, and it was amazing!! Not sure what it is about Wow though, because I have played other games that are in all honesty, probably "better", but nothing gets me like old Azeroth does. Perhaps it was the throw back to the good old days.
---
Of course we're going to get battlegroups.  That's how it was in real classic.  Anyone who, like me, remembers BGs before x-realm knows that it has no longevity as you're constantly waiting ages in queue for a BG.
---
Battlegroups is a good compromise and also was in vanilla anyway so is absolutely fine imo.  You still get your 'battlegroup celebs' in terms of premades that dominate n stuff, but you end up with a much larger pool of players to choose from.
---
the rain in stv ;( i miss soo much
---
I'm just randomly curious: Why are you taking leatherworking?
---
Sorry if it's been posted. It was munch first time seeing the countdown
---
Mix Enchanting  with Tailoring, they work very well with each other. And you won't have paladin depening on you and you depending on him.
---
So the idea is to use Skinning + Cloth you find, to power level both tailoring and leather working to be able to craft their first green item. At which point you make those items in bulk, and begin to disenchant them on your enchanting character. You continue this until level 30, where you are then able to make yourself a Lesser Magic Wand.
---
I usually don't have any cash at all, and my workplace cantina doesn't accept cash anymore. Neither do any vending machines here.
---
Damn I remember Xfire. Loved that program, was like the gamers version of MSN
---
Always thought the flag drop mechanic needed work.  The opposing faction should be given 1 second chance to click before a handoff.
---
doesn't even have to be shadow, they just get that shit.
---
Thanks lol.
---
I see your logic and I counter with nostalgia! ;) 
---
No but really, nostalgia is a legitimate thing to consider.
---
Many of the people in the hardcore Vanilla crowd today cheered way back when they removed weapon skill, need for arrows, skill levels and many other QoL and conveniences.
---
 They thought they wanted all those removals and QoL changes, but since then many have realised that these little "hurdles" let's call them, provided things to do. It made you sink more time into the game, allowed you to set yourself apart from the rest, and it gave more meaning and substance to your accomplishments. You felt a bigger payoff because there was more work and time invested. It felt good because you truly earned things. 
---
The drinking after every pull meant a slower pace. It allowed for people to socialize during the downtime. It also makes sense to rest and regenerate after you've had a fight. You became buddies or enemies. It was all part of the adventure, you were in a dungeon in a far-off place together with your party. It was dangerous and required some methodology in order to advance.
---
The rebuffing was a pain only for Paladins, but mostly I would say it was one additional conversation starter. "Hey can I please have a rebuff?", "All rebuff before boss". It is an RPG element that is almost gone in the modern game. It created team spirit imo.
---
Being ganked 16 times in Booty Bay sucked. Likewise, it was incredible fun to gank someone else 16 times :P.  The entire zone of STV was feels dangerous, and it should, because of the PvP. You either love it or hate it. I love it. It's another difficult obstacle on your journey that you have to overcome.
---
Doing a raid was a massive and epic effort. It wasn't a little roadtrip with interchangeable parts like it is today. The payoff was huge in Vanilla precisely because it took that much time and preparation to pull it off, and because there was only 4-5 items dropping it made it that much more satisfying when you did get your piece. 
---
The way WoW is played today on modern servers is a travesty. It's not what WoW, or an MMO RPG should be played like.
---
the dwarf and preist fighting the yeti. unf. fucking love that pic.
---
But you can just kill cloth mobs and reach wand level with no problem if you have just tailoring thou. When you are doing this, you are both just going to sink money into learning proffesion skills, specially LW that he has no use for, and he cant level it up without you giving him what he needs. Then you can just grab blacksmithing+mining. Do the same thing, while getting some gear.
---
Why do they work so well together? (my main issue is needing eng so it's a waste to level two big profs) especially when I can't get rid of tailoring due to the BiS 60 robe
---
Agreed, feel like its almost a foregone conclusion cross realm bgs will exist in some fashion as the alternative is hour plus queues and/or relatively dead PvP during off peak hours .  I hope this gets treated more like connected realms they have now - small subset of servers (3-4) so you can significantly improve queue times but also still be able to familiarize people you get paired up with.  At that size you will most definitely get re-grouped consistently.  
---
Think the worst thing they can do is cross realm without battlegroups.  That would directly conflict with one of the major tenants of vanilla in “community” and frankly exacerbates, or at worst encourages, trolling/afk/etc with the layer of anonymity it gives.
---
seems unlikely that you were actually on the same realm as him when this happened almost two decades ago but ok
---
Yup.
---
Most servers in current wow are hard-fused to 3-4 other servers, and light fused to a larger cluster.
---
hard-fused servers are functionally 1 server, just with people having different server tags so the mail-system doesn't get confused by people with the same name. (One they've been hard fused all servers but the "core" server are removed from the realm-list and you can only see them if you have at least 1 character there).
---
Light fused servers let you dungeon together, BG together, or quest together via shared shards, but your interactions are limited, as you can't trade most items (except BoPs with trade time left you're eligible for) and can't join guilds for those servers.
---
Light Consolidated servers shouldn't happen in the classic project, but hard-consolidated servers are pretty much a guarantee if the populations drop too low to be healthy for that server for a long period, they'll probably fuse them into another server with a complementary ally/horde split or similar population if the servers are relatively even.
---
Vanilla especially requires fairly large average pops (around 800+) to be healthy, while TBC can get away with 350, and Wrath+ can drop as low as 150 if you don't mind 25 man content being rarely run.
---
Say what? Do you just make reality whatever you want it to be? I played on US servers due to wanting to be with some gamer friends from previous games. Your barrens chat is a decent if not quite adequate measure of how asinine your country is.
---
It was on Archimonde-EU. War Legend had a lot of great players. First rank 14, First Onyxia EU kill,.. 
---
I've good memories playing against them !
---
Those are rookie numbers. Real gamers play *at least* 26 hours a day.
---
because you grind cloth, and get skills in both proffesions.
---
troll would be the masterrace for that race only guild i think aswell.
---
Because the board game might be wrapping up around then
---
It is, but games take multiple hours. As in, over 6 usually. And that's a generous estimate
---
Archimonde was like the most populated french server, and War Legend was a really popular guild. Doesn't seem unlikely to me.
---
As someone who played DotA 2 and LoL, I completely agree with you.
---
"Gave them refuge"? You mean owning them as property, right?
---
If you are a solo priest the wands are your dps, however when duo leveling idk if it is viable to make your own off the bat. The amount you could progress in that time is pretty good and you don’t have to rely on drop rates ect. You have to be level 5 to use the wand you make. Instead of doing that I think (if you were dwarfs) it would be more practical to just level in the dwarf zones. “Gathering Idols” level 13 loch modan gives the “Dwarven Flamestick”  13.6 dps if the wiki is right.  This will carry you till cookies stirring rod. So you’ve got to figure out if you think relying on the rng drops and focusing on profs that early will pay off when the next wand you can get is level 13 and disgustingly better. I would understand the argument if you were solo but not with someone that makes up for the slight lack of damage.
---
Just to expand on OP's post, the blue PvP gear in 1.12 *is a completely different set with different item IDs*, they never updated the stats, rather they just replaced the old blue set with new, completely different sets.
---
In theory the 1.11 version blue PvP gear should only be added in phase 6, since they didn't exist before then and they said they would be holding back on gear that was released later on in Vanilla's patch cycle.

---
nice
---
All are good in their own way, but I like Tauren for Stomp and HP.
---
Because most cloth items you make for skilling up tailoring are worthless auction-house wise. So you either sell them (waste of perfectly good greens) or you disenchant them. Now, you could have an alt for that, but why not have it directly on your main?
---
BfA edition with no Darnassus no Undercity DansGame
---
I tried some shit and my bank was very fussy about it.
---
They never were, I played a pally back in the day and healed everything just fine. Maybe other pallies were bad because of skill/UI limitations but as long as a pally knew how to triage correctly they did the job just fine.  
---
He is talking about people who either had the perception that they were bad back in the day and/or are going into classic with that perception/expectation.
---
Wait, so if it was 14 years ago, it's impossible that someone played on Archimonde-EU?  
---
So it must be impossible that anyone played on Stormreaver when Xenif hit 60 too?  
---
Are you trying to say that everyone who played vanilla, or at least on a server that did a big thing, is dead?  
---
I don't follow.
---
So I really loved classics art style and colors but because I've seen it all before I'm probably going to max everything out in the off chance it will fill me with the same wonder I had when I first played. 
---
Seeing everything in higher detail will hopefully let me see wow in a new way.
---
Every race has something that benefits them for tanking. Pick the race you like the most.
---
Not enough to not pick it
---
feels like he is "playing" zoomed in. no environmental controll
---
"This is not an opinion "  
---
" Just discussing why I think Blizzard will have them "  
---
Hmmm.
---
Dun morogh -&gt; Loch modan -&gt; Westfall -&gt; Redridge -&gt;Duskwood -&gt; redrigde :D
---
I remember thinking the troll was a warlock (Because apparently red=warlock to dumb 11 year old me). Imagine my disappointment when I realised I couldn’t be! I love this pic.
---
It is probably just a TBC client thing and can be blocked by addons and might not even happen in the future classic client, but:  
---
Track humanoids on druids. I'm sure it has SOME use for PvP, or if you don't know a lot about the game and prefer hovering over dots to jut typing /target name. But at least in TBC it auto-activates whenever you go into cat form. This makes it very likely you'll miss herbs or mineral veins unless you switch the tracking back over every single time you go into cat.
---
I’m going to be a [Dirty Magazine Vendor]. Hand out steamy romance novels
---
Can you "save" and "reload" a game? 
---
I use to do this by taking pictures for some board games
---
This is how the afk-bots started.
---
Imagine ruining the game. Oh wait, nvm, they did. Several times over.
---
I'm right there with you, Game of Thrones is great and all, but WoW has its own iconic music that would have also suited this. I get the impression that this is doesn't completed. Ironforge was lacking and two cities were completely missing, Darnasus and Undercity.
---
They can easily fix dodging by just deserting the entire group if one quits, simple easy, and very little fallout.
---
I played pserver for a few months, just because I couldn't allocate points into talent trees/look at spells &amp; icons/reset talent trees forever. So I played what I thought was going to be my 'class to roll for classic (shaman)' and realized pretty far in (49) that shaman was not for me.
---
Happy I made that realization on a pserver rather than a live server...and now my class choice is narrowed further, which is great.
---
If you are trying to level fast no this is not worth doing
---
that Pic was fucking rad
---
I posted on this before.  There are comparable wands available at level 7-9.
---
My experience is pretty much the opposite.
---
Elwynn Forest -&gt; Westfall -&gt; Loch Modan --&gt; Westfall --&gt; Redridge Mountains -&gt; Duskwood (wolves + spiders) --&gt; Loch Modan (elites) --&gt; Duskwood --&gt; Wetlands --&gt; Duskwood --&gt; Wetlands (orc quests and cursed ship) --&gt; Duskwood where I probably end up killing ghouls or worgens for a few levels. Can't wait!!!!
---
Ashenvale is unbearable as A and I don't fancy the quests too much. World pvp is not that fun before you get your abilities imo.
---
Agreed. I want to make a tanking set for my Paladin to run through undead 5-man dungeons quickly, but didn't want to wait for the Deathbone set to get patched with good stats.
---
Yup, whole reason I picked hunter Cos I wanted a bear pet like the dwarf! 😂
---
after this I rolled a hunter dwarf with bear pet. I was 12 years old. I got to level 30-40...then my playtime expired and I didnt know what to do...after I found out I need to buy playtime, my mom refused to buy it for me and I had no nearby gamestore. A year later i played on a private tbc server, this time i rolled draenei paladin...dont ask me why :D
---
1+2: This is a good start. Ideally you'd want to macro everything so that can swap between your stances seamlessly for abilities such as Berserker rage, Mocking blow, TC, etc.   
---
3: Don't even consider a prot paladin  
---
4: Check out skarm. He's good for beginners too,  [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5xSfo5nMGSmv00sGpRN7SQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5xSfo5nMGSmv00sGpRN7SQ)
---
It is amazing how different some of these servers actually are.
---
I love budding other people. 
---
In ffxi buffs are a huge deal, huge. I loved throwing out protect/shell, and a few cures to someone grinding on some mobs as I ran through La Theine for the hundredth time.
---
Elwynn Forest &gt; westfall &gt; Redridge &gt; Wetlands. Duskwood is mostly to full of people. Redridge mostly for the 2h Mace from the Elite quest.
---
Yes, any warrior that says 'I cannot tank' will be laughed at a bit.
---
If you are going to be 'pure dps warrior', you have best be the top of your fucking game, or risk being replaced by one who has a tank set in his bags.
---
Multiple times almost every day.
---
Not if you talk to the other side's top premade guilds to dodge each other.
---
Summer is coming.
---
As a whole, if your class can do X, you should learn how to do X.
---
If your class, like warr, can do x and y. You should learn to be decent at both or able to do both.
---
Yes. Due to the information I have, I am lead to believe this. I can believe that something is going to happen and not give my opinion on it.
---
I believe that I will be alive tomorrow. It isn't my opinion that I'll be alive tomorrow, but with the knowledge I have currently, I believe I will be.
---
Maybe they want 1.4 bugged out ragnaros too.  And 1.4 paladin reckoniing bombs.
---
The progessive itemization private server retards, are just that, retards.  They think classic wow will be super hard, while using mega-buffed drop rates, and mob-spawns, and all kinds of other buggy shit that is stronger than original on their wanker server.
---
Will Classic run mostly in the same graphics as it did back in 1.12? I am stuck with an office HP laptop which has rendered me unable to play retail but would hopefully allow me to play Classic without any hurdles.
---
Dun Morogh is one of my all time favorite zones. The music, the aesthetic, it's all comfortable and warm, despite the snowy climate. If I could live anywhere in Azeroth it would be Dun Morogh. I love the zone, I love the dwarves.
---
How does threat in modern wow work? Is it not a thing to consider anymore?
---
It only cost a few silver to train those professions. Also once the economy balances out you can actually craft wands for nearly free if you can sell strange dust for 2-4s each and get stacks of linen for less than 10s. Source I’ve made 25g casually using tailor and enchanting on a bank alt. My main is only 23 but the servers economy is a little more established.
---
You know you have to farm potions and more in the other days.
---
You like holy tentacles. 🐙
---
I have a bank alt with both and it can do a shuffle to bassicly manufacture wands for pure profit granted you need to be able to sell strange dust for a minimum 2s each and get linen under 10s
---
According to Preach's videos, not really. They put a bit of it back in, but only to the point that freshly capped tanks can no longer hold aggro on highly skilled and geared dps.
---
You chose to use OPs fun little video about PvP as a platform for pushing an agenda about elitism and how people are perpetually terrible at games.  Even worse, I don't agree that there's some overarching theme of a casual minority anywhere to be found, in this video or otherwise.
---
So uhh, rude.
---
Reason why people are annoyed by this being shared over and over:  
---
The point of a countdown is to give an accurate timing on some event that is about to occur.
---
Emphasis being on **accurate**. This is not a countdown. This is someone making a stupid clickbait page, to generate revenue with fottball field sice ad banners. **There is no release date for classic yet.** It doesn't matter what some big shiny banner on some website says.
---
One eu and one us server for different times,?
---
Why? I played vanilla and I knew many many people on this realm. There wasn't that many realms. I was on a different one. But if it would be my realm and would most likely have seen this guy. Why is that unlikely?
---
I haven’t played retail for years but, when I did the tank’s abilities generated threat at such a rate that it would be near impossible to catch up. The challenge for tanks was staying alive and managing the damage you take.
---
I would presume more than likely yes they will be included as their not ‘game breaking’ such as Decursive.
---
I’m usually pretty much a no changes guy. But I wouldn’t actually mind cross realm bgs. Sure it’s fine and dandy with going against the same guys over and over again on your server, but I feel it would be more fun in the LONG RUN to have cross realm bgs. As long as outside of bgs in the actual world there are none crossrealm mechanics.
---
They won't be, I'm very sure.  It would effect game balance and wasn't possible in Vanilla.
---
Blizz isn't going put keep a debuff limit and spell batching and then allow rogues to blind people without losing combo points etc.
---
Back in the day I was a sort of quest giver to new players on my server. Don't remember very many of my quests but one in particular stood out to me. 
---
I was a tailor and was wearing some BoE green. A new player whispered me asking where I got it, and I told him I could fashion one for him if he completed my task...
---
I sent him to gather a stack of 20 silk cloth. Being a new player he didn't know where to get any of these so he didn't check the AH. I told him the only place to get silk was from the elite orcs in Stonewatch Keep, not expecting him to actually believe me. But the madman actually got together a group of 5, went into stonewatch and started farming cloth.
---
He returned to me in SW and I happily crafted him that robe. Pretty sure it was a net loss but it was worth it to make that dude's day.
---
Gah you reminded me of my favorite video.  It was some dude ganking in Org, and when they finally caught him he popped the invincibility flask.
---
Elwynn-&gt; westfall -&gt; loch modan-&gt; darkshore -&gt; westfall -&gt; redridge
---
Playing on a class I don't remember and seeing a rogue using sprint for the first time. Re-rolled instantly.
---
Starter zone -&gt; Westfall -&gt; Redridge -&gt; Duskwood
---
The atmosphere in those zones just ticks all my fantasy boxes. Darkshore needs to DIAF
---
I've seen it before as well, but it has been over 12 years last time i've seen it. It was a good laugh
---
gonna be playing 6-8 hours a day on each character. i think ill be ok in that regard
---
You could in theory yes. There are a ton of moving parts and different cards in this game. It takes up like 2 whole tables and as someone else said takes a good 6 hours or more. It is really fun though, usually play it a few times a year.
---
Not during vanilla at least, but interrogation marks were added to the minimap before TBC by the time of 1.12
---
i want them to both be US
---
Oh yes I love karma video!
---
There is a quest in Darkshore that rewards a wand and requires 11 lvl. to complete.
---
You mean their big rubber masturbating shoes?
---
I played from the start of vanilla and never seen that.
---
you don't have fun the same way I do =/= go play retail instead 
---
Your logic gives me a headache.
---
There's also a threshold where Blizzard considers it harassment, specifically when a high level player consistently goes out of their way to kill the same lowbies over and over again. I know you all have spent a lot of time on private servers and probably dont remember what actual vanilla is like, but yes, Blizzard did and does have a limit to what they will allow even on PvP servers.
---
Wow that is a huge bummer. Threat is one of the interesting mechanics in WoW for sure.
---
The whole tone of the game changed from "real" fantasy to "really funny" fantasy. Remember the Lich quest as Horde that killed half of Southshore when you completed it? That's what I remember about classic. What I remember about Cata is a Gnome looking for a toilet. Stopped leveling any more toons after that.
---
Also silencing a warrior is a good way to not get charged and just get intercepted I loved doing that shit 🤣
---
I had one too. You would get free time for charging a certain amount to the card eg every $100 or something like that. I had the Cataclysm design which always got some jealous remarks from fellow WOW players.
---
The lvl58 and lvl60 blue gear are completely different items and may be released in different phases.  The rank 12/13 gear had their stats upgraded and will likely be released in their 1.12 form.
---
My friend and I watched videos from the competition for hours and read all the entries to the monthly wow comic contests after his parents said we could play 'that bloody game' all night :D
---
You're severely limiting yourself if you only date girls who wouldn't cringe at your WoW credit card.
---
The thing is that most of those are dps's. Most people who roll warrior want to top the dps charts as fury, or reck nubs in pvp as arms.
---
The get away with it too, because outside of 4 horsemen in naxx, you will never need more than 3 people to tank, and 1 or 2 of those will dps'ing most of the time anyway. But you can easily bring 6 warriors to a raid.
---
The good fury warriors will usually tank 5mans for their dps prebis, which will annoy the fuck out of rogues and such.
---
I started on archimonde from the first day if european release, at that time there maybe 2 pvp servers, 2 pve and 1 RP for french people.
---
I were 21 at that time, I am now 36 and still willing to play!
---
As someone from AUS, it means I can do raids that don't start at 2-4 AM, have a ping below 400ms and be able to play with friends without staying awake at ungodly hours during the night! I played on Feenix and would go to sleep at ~9PM to wake up at ~3AM for naxx then go back to bed at 5-6 and wake up for work a couple hours later it really drained me... but I did get nearly full BiS on my mage.
---
As a PvP player, the biggest thing is the ping. Pretty much all classic private servers were in EU where i never had a good ping. And back in retail vanilla I had Dial-Up so it will be the first time i get to experience classic PvP with a playable ping. And of course not having hackers or people abusing bugs secretly is a huge bonus. When feenix was shutting down, everyone spilled the beans about how they would solo naxx bosses using underflow abuse, how they'd pop 5 potions at once, and all kinds of things they kept quiet about. There's also going to be no shady GM's selling gear or gold, or any personal drama shit from the staff affecting the servers.
---
I don't think so
---
So what your saying is Classic should be like classic and should never have representation of the four server types that were present in its history and thusly are advocating for changes to be made ?
---
We are currently sitting on a 1.12 system with delayed content release.
---
In addition it seems that you are promoting for larger than normal server size - the biggest issues for servers is lack of balance with their faction populations which causes toxic gameplay for players. This is much more prevalent on PvP servers which can easily swing that way.
---
Unlike any other server's RP-PvP generally has the best balance in regards to server population across factions - it would thusly make sense to put restrictions to prevent this for server longevity.
---
That's a joke, right?
---
Leveling a Paladin from 1 to 20. (retri)
---
Would 1h+shield be better/even than 2h until u get SoC?
---
Haven't watched the video yet, on data rn, but he may ha e been referencing original estimates from after it was initially announced. I was expecting a post Blizzcon 2019 release myself
---
Probably more. By the end of vanilla speedrunners could hit 60 in about 5 days of /played time. But this was on fast levelling classes like Hunters/Warlocks (which a Shaman is definitely not), with plenty of prior practice, and with optimal routes already figured out before they even started. This guy was so ahead of the curve that he had to figure this all out by himself, which had to have cost him time. He also had to farm the gold his lvl 40 mount himself, something that later speedrunners didn't really bother with as they could borrow from other players in case of a fresh realm or use their main characters for funds (or they got it for free as a lock). But again this guy was so ahead of the curve, that there was probably not a lot of gold in circulation to begin with. So assuming he had about 6-7 days of /played to hit max level (which is already amazingly fast considering the circumstances), that left him with roughly 5 to 8 hours per day for breaks and sleep. Or in other words between 16 and 19 hours of playing every day. And it might very well still have been a lot more, because I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt here in terms of efficiency.
---
You sound like my kind of date!
---
I thought you meant buttons you’d use every fight not one or two fights each instance. Obviously utility has niche uses. Doesn’t really change my opinion.
---
Yes you can. It does not require Gnomish engineering to use. There are a handful of items you'd want to craft, like the Battle Chicken, before you drop engineering so make sure you craft everything that's gnome only
---
I started on archimonde from the first day if european release, at that time there were maybe 2 pvp servers, 2 pve and 1 RP for french people.
---
Of course Blizzard had to add servers quickly but when I created my first char, choice was limited!
---
I did not choose it because of War Legend, Millenium or other big guilds that chose it, I picked the first one in alphabetical order!
---
how is 1 clicking lowbies fun?
---
Same thing happened in vanilla
---
Honestly rank 14 isn't even "earned" at that point if you can play much less than other servers.
---
I don't agree with the system in general, but if it's going to exist I want it to be as grindy as possible for those going for rank 14. 
---
No sympathy, the PvP rewards are going to be even more OP this time around, I want people ruining their social lives and get their account banned for account sharing in their attempt to get r14 😂 Serves them right for refusing to change it to a skill-based system
---
I had the Orc version, but when the card expired, they just sent me a generic card and any trace of Warcraft was erased from the account. I think I still have the card somewhere, will post a pic of it if I find it.
---
No way I can sit through an hour of that shit tier mic lol
---
Can you PM me what server you choose at launch so I do t accidentally pick the same one as you
---
How would you have access to the alpha client?
---
Actually a pretty solid way to make a bit of change while people are leveling. Get greens that are better for leveling along with various healing potions and sell them on the Zep....
---
If you leave each Xpac with their own servers (i.e. leave the Vanilla servers, and open new ones for BC, WoTLK, etc) you wont have people whining for Classic, because it will still be there. So Classic will stay Classic.
---
Why is cornering the market on an item in the auction house fun, I'm not paying 4g for THAT item so BS?  Why do people even duel outside major cities, you don't even get honor or rewards?  Why do people grind rep for factions that don't give them any rewards, so boring amirite?  Who grinds rank 14 by playing 12 hours a day for months, that's disgusting those people need help!
---
It doesn't matter dude.  If you have a problem with the way others play, that's a personal issue no one wants to hear about.
---
That’s going to be a lot of money spent to level them both up.
---
That cinematic made me play a hunter for a few years!
---
Hey, thanks man for the sanity check. Even though, I'm bringing this up for discussion I don't believe that blizzard will pull it off. First, it is a really risky move no way around it. Secondly, blizzard just wants to put classic in stasis mode, like starcraft, where they put all their resources in revamping the game but once that it was revamped they moved everyone working and left a couple of guys just to mantain it. I don't think you should shy from playing because BC may come out, doesn't really seem like it.
---
I only ever got up to like r8 or something I think. How does the system actually work, is it just purely about total honor gained? And if you get R12 you can get the blue gear and R14 for the epic?
---
Dude those are some big words. Feels like you're over seasoning your argument.
---
"Pushing an agenda about elitism"
---
Against elitism, actually. There's nothing wrong with admitting that you suck at a game because it's just a game.
---
Also I didn't say anything about a casual minority, but a proffessional one.
---
Did you stand up and throw hot coffee on him?
---
There's really no incentive to go goblin. Their bigger bombs are super expensive so u won't craft Em often anyway
---
Quebec guilds raid in afternoon iirc
---
I imagine this was not easy and they did the best they could though.
---
? u literally press one button and everything you said is completely irrelevant in a 40m scenario
---
yea or could have even added some warcraft sound effects that are familiar for each city.
---
Fedt gutter!!
---
Makes me think he had to have had a beta key, but I’m not even sure the EU servers had access to beta, which would make this even MORE impressive
---
Um...This was def not Goosebump material..
---
You got something where all store purchases you got like triple reward points or something but it didn't really add up to much lol
---
Its fine
---
Don't feed the troll
---
This but make sure to pick up flight paths.
---
Litrually every single person who opened the game for the first time I bet...
---
No changes
---
classic team could go revamp diablo 2, doesn't mean that they will stay doing BC.
---
lmao the private server "community" is the worst on the fucking planet. /r/wowservers is a fucking cesspool.
---
Wow gets even 100 times better when you play with RL friends :D
---
I JUST GOT SO EXCITED WATCHING THIS - thanks OP!!!
---
Oh yeah dude, it's just me.  There is no way you're the problem here with all then downvotes.
---
Have some selfawarness.  Doubtful you'd ever apologize to OP for making an ass out of yourself on his thread.  Mabe next time make a constructive comment about the video or something.  Don't worry, you'll get better at this over time.
---
Like they used to do...?
---
The problem with these vanilla servers is that the same guild(s) goes to every single one, magically gets perfect loot drop on the first Rag kill, and engages in serious Devilsaur mafia. A lot of them obviously account share to reach 60 in under a week but they know the admins so nothing is done about it.  HOPEFULLY all of this will be gone with the release of Classic.
---
Do Tauren have any restrictions on what mounts they can ride?
---
Pets yes, Tabards Yes, Shirts yes.
---
Everything else: No. Not even toys.
---
Tak ærede falcorn!
---
Man I am so looking forward to exploring these areas in detail. In retail I never went here as I was mid 49s when bc launched and I just rushed past to outlands. I can’t wait!
---
Before the game was released I used to look through the class and race descriptions religiously, and in the end I planned my race and class by how incredibly overpowered I would be with increased health regeneration and the highest armour class, a troll warrior.
---
I made that toon and well... I stuck to it most of vanilla and I guess that's something.
---
lol dumping 2-3 /played days into a bank alt
---
i think its fucking gay to lock anything behind their shitty blizzcon virtual ticket 
---
i have no interest in anything from blizz other than classic i dont want to spend the cost of a good game just for access to test classic , a pet or anything like that.
---
people should not be ok with blizz locking access or anything really desirable behind massively over priced virtual tickets 
---
i cant even imagine how i would have felt if i got real tickets last year as a diablo fan to hear they were turning it into a casual mobile phone title for children
---
More populous side gets a faction queue during peak? If you're server is overpopulated, then limit the queue to the overpopulated faction. It wouldn't break anything, and blizzard uses queues for everything.
---
Are you comparing classic wow with a painting like mona lisa? Lmao
---
Find a weekend raiding guild. I'm sure they'll exist again for the no lifers. They would do some 8 hour raid days on sat/sun day time.
---
this is by far the most quality post i have seen here
---
100/10 my friend
---
Taurens can only ride wolves and kodos
---
Seems odd they would use the new engine but revert to the old clunky macros.
---
Should work in the 8.x client.
---
Well the quest log seems nice yep, id vote for a quest log bfa toggle. I also think making the meeting stones work for summoning would be nice. And warlock be able to stack soul shards would be nice.
---
You can still dodge crbgs premades as easy as non crbg. You send 1 player in and they sit until they see the ranks/names of the enemy team. Then you either join or dodge. The one guy that entered gets a quick loss and still decent honor, while your main team in a new game against pugs, wins just as fast. And then you're back in the queue.
---
Keep in mind that you'll still be getting exp from the humanoid mobs that you'll be killing, and if you're teaming up with another person that cuts down on some of item transfer time. So really it's just a few combines to get a pretty nice DPS upgrade. Logically it seems worth it, but I haven't done any math.
---
2h is for levelling and pvp, all other situations you'll either be tanking with a 1h/shield or dual wielding
---
Hi, /u/Wildhornz
---
Ho shit
---
The ZG mounts and the baron mount from strat should also be possible IIRC.
---
And you get 10% off purchases over 50$ ar disneyland!
---
Are you trying to go full classic and bring back the word dip/dipping?
---

I believe he said on stream that when he tested this, it was around level 8/9 before his duo got enough cloth for the first wand. Quest wands start becoming available at 11-13 in Darkshore, Loch Modan, and Westfall. It'll be worth it if your route doesn't have you doing any wand quests for a while.
---
I think testing will be required to know if crafting will actually save any time. It's less likely it will since the priest is going to be duo instead of solo. If you were both casters, I'm certain it would be worth crafting lessers.
---
Yes they’re in Vanilla. They also trap you.
---
If we stick 20 gnomes as riders on 20 centaurs does that count as 20 cavalry and 20 infantry or just 20 lightly calvary :P
---
just expect it to be the slowest game you have ever played
---
it becomes rewarding but especially 1-40 essetially sucks and can take weeks for a new player
---
love the game but its sloooooow
---
Yeah if I bet they will announce it like this :
---
# Release date will be JULY 16th !!!!!1111ONE
---
^(and you get cross-BGs too (please don't hurt me I'm just a spokesperson))
---
do there will be some that just do saturday/sunday? thats good to know. i think if i can convince my already lined up guild to stick to one or the other, ill be fine.
---
Server 'community', anyone who stayed behind would be completely fucked, people losing names/guilds/friends that have sentimental value.
---
It's why they prefer merging servers.
---
"lol u got a lotta downvotes so I win the argument"
---
Could have tried replying with something relevant about my last comment, but I guess not. Go ahead and play the victim card : D
---
I already stated that my first comment came off as a personal attack on OP. If he didn't seem offended by it (judging by his reply) then why are you white knighting him anyway? My only guess would be that you're one of those players in the video and you still click your spells after 10 years of gaming. Anyway, thanks a lot for defending a video about a level 8 paladin killing people. You've done the world a favor and stopped global warming.
---
You're right about that
---
Why are gnomes hated so much? It’s friendly-ish hate but still, why?
---
All these people that don’t understand the time commitment needed to play and raid just *one* character seriously. 
---
So many people in for a shock once the game launches. 
---
I mean... you can do it, but you’ll basically need to poop sock it just to be anything except a casual raider.
---
because all of those things are challenging, requiring some combination of skill, intelligence and persistence to achieve
---
1 clicking lowbies is no different from 1 clicking mobs in retail. or just replacing the whole game with a button that prints 'you win!'
---
The left one is the druid symbol. The one on the right is the hearthstone
---
Man, you know something is old when all the wallpapers are only available in 4:3 aspect ratio.
---
Yesterday I was cursing you, today I'd kiss you on the mouth \\o/
---
Honestly I can't tell if it's because it's free to play or because of the euro trash in chat but pservers are sooooooooooooooooo much worse than NA retail servers in terms of the quality of people you encounter.  It doesn't help that all they have to say is "lol amerimorons" and "lol NA".  Nice way to contribute to such a better chat guys.
---
Because it’s classic, not modern wow with modern QoL?
---
Are they only usable as goblin engineer?
---
The pacing was one of the positive aspects of the original game in my opinion. You could really experience and get to know the world.
---
And the value of doing quests in the slower paced game far exceeded what it is today in retail. Experience gains in quests was exciting. Currency was exciting, especially since you need to work towards getting your first mount. You actually spent time reviewing rewards and feeling overjoyed when you could replace gear.
---
In retail, the majority of the quests rewarded you with gold that didn’t need, artifact power that you could give two shits about, and items that you mindlessly equipped based on a single “item level” stat.
---
No.  I play the game for fun and don't want to deal with that bullshit.
---
Hacking support is a big one for me, on Pservers if you get hacked... tough shit.. On retail Blizzard tends to investigate and get your stuff back. Got hacked on a server starting with K and ending with nus... Was lvl 38 and had like 95g... came on, no gear, all vendored, no gold, all quests abandoned... no profession mats... Luckily they were too stupid to check the AH, and I had the  epic BOE shadow ring... managed to sell that for a few hundred gold... They told me it was my own problem. I fully expect when classic launches that these types of things won't be a problem/
---
Elwynn Forest -&gt; Westfall -&gt; Redridge Mountains -&gt; Duskwood
---
Elwynn Forest is comfy and easy to level in, can't go wrong.
---
Westfall had great quests/rewards and awesome opportunities to make gold (Dust Devil/crab farming) along with Deadmines quest rewards and farming I always enjoyed doing
---
Redridge Had awesome elite quests with great gear, but there is ALWAYS at least one Horde going around ganking people and camping that god awful escort quest...
---
Duskwood was amazing for Paladin, chopped down everything in my way via exorcism, until bored Horde decided to come over and camp the cemetery where 90% of the quests and no guards are...
---
Not really, but that intro is absolutely goddamn fantastic in describing the various zones. Hell, Ironforge remains my favourite capital to this day, due to the intro alone, even if it's clumsy to navigate.
---
Its not raw cost, its opportunity cost.
---
That paladin could be giving up mining/herbalism and tossing away a few dozen gold.
---
Because Gnomes are the best race, even for the classes they can't play. People get jelly you know?
---
Fair enough on DD but personally as I've played WoW as my first mmo its always been dps on the servers I've played on. It just all comes down to habit and it would throw me off every time reading "DD". Just like the difference of VC and DM for deadmines, since I played horde it was always VC. It will be interesting to see what the server I play on will do with acronyms since it's social not gameplay driven.
---
Mouse over macros were a thing back in vanilla.
---
Don't know why that gives me a belly chuckle. I mean the things I've seen the modern day woman take on those webcam sites.
---
Is a bleed/poison hemo build viable for rogue pvp? Or are the increased poison chance to hit and increased poison damage talents just not worth it? Would love to know the results of any p server testing
---
I agree to everything you said, but man you could be a little more creative than "gay" my man :p
---
Not the right direction, that was the opposite of improvement.  Try positivity or a constructive comment about the video.  :D
---
We did, at least I had access to the open beta. However, i'm gonna take a wild guess that this guy leveled a char to 60 on the US realms before the game hit Europe ;)
---
yeah i only ever really enjoyed pvp and raiding , you are right though a lot of people enjoy the questing
---
i just never enjoyed it , it was quite a bit too slow for me when i just wanted to do max level things
---
in vanilla i had like 1 level 60 and like a full list of 1-30 alts lol , during bc i dual boxed to 70 just so i coukd have 2 characters and only ever level once lol
---
waddayamean "now that blizzcon has been officially announced"?
---
To be honest, I'd instantly exchange my current CC for one of those if they'd offer them again. But I'd prefer them to be Mastercard for some arbitrary reason. I mean if women can carry stupid smartphone pink cases with glitters and sparkles like they're 10 year olds, then I can have my WoW insolvency card.
---
We need a goblin credit card
---
Those centaurs are actually a decent grind even for rogue or warrior. They drop money and cloth and are really easy to kill, also they don’t turn red until you have killed all you need for rep
---
Refrain not to spec imp slam is right.
---
Old graphics, but the client will run on the retail client (for modern security, interfacing with battle.net application, etc). So it depends on what was stopping you from playing on the laptop. If it was a compatibility issue then Classic likely won't work. If it was an issue of using too many graphics resources, then Classic may be better in less populated areas.
---
Although isn't playing at 10 fps with an overheating PC part of the vanilla WoW experience?
---
Mods there’s a grammatical error in the first paragraph
---
Level 12-13 human mage, walking down into the Deadmines entrance (at Moonbrook) for the first time and seeing a Defias mob at the entrance to the cave. The mob had a weird, golden dragon border surrounding his unit frame. Had no clue what it was but the mob was only a level higher than me, so I started attacking.
---
I died.
---
That was my first encounter with an elite. And I was overjoyed with the challenge WoW was going to present to me moving forward.
---
(I also was possessed with seeing what else was down there)
---
It varies so much, if you wanna go the cheap route just play healer. It’s easier to get by without a single consumable, I was constantly in the top 3 hps using only the major mana pots I found whilst playing casually and crafting some really cheap lvl 35ish mana potions.
---
I think the only reason to use hemo is to build cheap eviserates. Bleed won't do enough burst to actually be a thread.
---
Thank you, I'll look into it!
---
Boo this man
---
There were no markers for the quest givers, but there was a ping on your minimap (like a resource node) when you had completed the quest and were close to the turn-in spot. That's from memory though so take it with a grain of salt.
---
Dusk wood for ambiance, red ridge for ease of question... the hub is close to all of the quests
---
who cares what joe schmo's website says. if you deny the prominence of fortnite you're sadly deceiving yourself.
---
OP was talking about putting a Warrior in combat so he can’t charge you. Nobody mentioned blackout.
---
The phase:x search operator is accurate to retail Vanilla until we get clarifiactions from the Classic team about how exactly the item gating is going to work; see this [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/1121853269033328641). T2 was in the game from day 1 and some of it used to drop in MC.
---
About the Necropile set, I'm not sure what you mean? if you search for *added:1.2 necropile* it shows up.
---
I tested it. If you’re solo then getting 60 cloth on a fresh server will take a long time and you will have to grind humanoids for a good while. The torchlight wand from Westfall lighthouse is better than Lesser Magic Wand and it becomes available at 13 I think.  
---
So in my opinion it’s not worth the extra effort to have a wand from levels 9-13. You can kill stuff just fine on every class, even priest, using a white  melee weapon. The wand helps with kill time tremendously, don’t get me wrong.   But in the long run, having a wand during those 4 or 5 levels will be extremely inconsequential in your journey to 60.
---
Yep, fire logs are pretty useless unless you filter out ignite damage.
---
Even I lol'ed and I'm an EE who will play and pay.
---
It’s actually a pretty nice weapon for Ret pala pvp early on for broke boys
---
auto loot being in the alpha?
---
Your joke sucks
---
this is original and thought provoking
---
I'm pretty sure banks allow you to change the design on your creditcard as long as you follow the rules when applying for the change (like no nudity, racist stuff, etc etc).
---
Your frost mages were horrible then. Fire sucks in MC.
---
99% of the people in this subreddit never played retail vanilla, and its some kind of sociopathic trait to claim that you have because you played a few private servers.
---
I started in in the tbc prepatch and I can remember fuck all, i also dont comment on changes because I dont know what I'm talking about, I wish others would do the same.
---
classic huntard comment
---
You get a certain amount of RP (based on your honor vs. the rest of your faction for the week) and lose a certain amount of RP (based on your rank, this is called decay) every week. When you get enough net RP you rank up. The higher you rank up the more decay you experience, meaning the higher percentile you need to finish for the week to avoid a net loss in RP (which is why when you hit Rank 14 you cant just sit there)
---
BGs make earning honor more predictable and give you a "guaranteed source of honor", but without them the same amount of RP will still be rewarded each week, meaning the same number of R14 exist with or without BGs.
---
Yeah it certainly depends on the player and what you’re after, I agree. I loved raiding content but as a player who never played an MMO prior to WoW, it was a real treat to take things slow and soak in the whole game, one experience at a time.
---
Maybe that’ll change this time around when I play classic since I know what lies ahead.
---
You are right.
---
But I doubt he did it all by himself tho
---
Twinking, a universal term that nearly every WoW player understands, that has been around since before the games conception, is NOT the same as PvE in retail.
---
I honestly don't understand the point you're trying to make.
---
If they’re going to make a pet etc. I just hope it’s something subtle that fits the theme of classic. There’s nothing more annoying than walking through retail and hearing everyone’s gadgets yell as they transform into Gamon or a Vyrkul.
---
In the open beta me and my friend picked up the quest in stormwind to deliver a package to stormpike (?) In Loch Modan.
---
We were unaware of the existence of the tram at the time and clearly didn't read the quest text. So I reviewed the world map and we set off through Elwyn forest, Redridge mountains and through burning steppes at like level 7. Needless to say we died ALOT but it was a fun mistake to make.
---
I'm pretty sure this has always been the meta though. I recall people doing this back in vanilla and I believe most guides recommend it.
---
If you've ever died in WPvP and before releasing heard that male gnome laugh, you'd know why. Other than that, I actually think people hate elves more
---
I did play vanilla. Never played private servers.
---
I used to love looking at all those in the booklet-thing in the wow box my brother had. Brb gona look at it again holy shit the nostalgia
---
Sarcasm? Lol
---
My fondest memories were of vanilla leveling. 30-40 especially since you got to spend so much time in the original scarlet monastery. I and my two best guild friends were all arms warriors. We'd challenge each other to largest execute critical. I'd be up til 5 am in there laughing hysterically at their idiotic jokes. Classic was much less about being a solo hero, and more about being a part of a group. It was harder to find groups, so when you did, you made sure you were respectful and listened well. That's how you got invited to a guild. Since LFR came out, guilds got destroyed. There was no need to ask around for a group to run a dungeon. You could silently join one and teleport there. No story about dodging the enemy faction running to the dungeon. No strategic entrance to the instance because you had to fight mobs outside of it. Just boring teleportation and a faceroll of a dumbed down dungeon experience for people with no patience.  
---
So I made my best friends in vanilla leveling. And when we hit 60 together, we raided together. We had each other's backs too because we were fringe spec arms warriors in a prot warrior's world. Leveling is what I look forward to in classic. Making friends again is what I look forward to.
---
I'm speaking about the Draenei and Naaru coming from Argus. I probably should have been a bit more clear but I figured mentioning the horde and alliance getting together in Shatt would have tipped it off.
---
No. Get a 2H and use SoR
---
The alpha IF was HUGE I wish they kept it. 
---
IF is my favorite city as well, just wish it was more popular than sw
---
Im all up about QoL features ... but yours is a bad example here.
---
The questing in classic is a big part of the game, easy things up will heavily impact it.
---
QoL features I would like to see are:
---
Rearrangable Character screen
---
right click items in trade to put into trade instead of using
---
Bigger mailsending
---
because warlocks are all stealing their mounts from the same place. There aren't any demon rams and demon wolves to go with the demon horses
---
This is also how the real world works as well. You get what you pay for. Most things in life that are free are not so great.
---
so what exactly happened to wow? i’ve been out of it for a while
---
I played vanilla and currently a private server....I remember vanilla alright and that's why everyone is excited
---
yeah like a lot of players truly enjoy questing , it always just felt likena barrier to me that helped keep really bad players out.
---
it was my first mmo too im not sure why exactly i hated it so much, i just always want to be in a group with a heap of players . if i leveled with friends id prob enjoy it
---
I think most of the older crowd generally has. It was THE game to being playing for many years.
---
I wish blizzard would have no xrealm BGs at launch, but already planned battlegroups for servers. So they could monitor the average queue times on a server over time, and if it goes beyond some threshold on average over a certain period of time, then activate the xrealm for that server. It would be extra work, but it would be really nice for the balanced servers that just don't need xrealm BG. I played on a large, fairly balanced realm all of vanilla, and there was never bad queue times (the longest I remember was 1 hour AV queues at 3 AM on a weekday). For servers like that xrealm BG was a big, big loss, while for others with too long queues it was great and necessary. So I hope blizz could come to some kind of compromise, though it's probably wishful thinking. :(
---
bfa is not wow....
---
OK, not a horde zone but...best horde zone is Hinterlands hands down
---
You'd think a separate client, separate forum, separate servers would be a clue.
---
How about you just select which armory like you select your client, like you select the classic forum, etc?
---
It won't be woven in with the current armory by selecting _classic.
---
No you can use them as gnome eng
---
There’s a few items on both goblin and gnomish that you can only create as that specialization, but can use as either. The important ones become soul bound when created, the other important ones are only useable by your current specialization. Take your time looking through item descriptions. Some classes find one spec over the other more useful.
---
Flare is so good for raid leading. 
---
“Casters stand here” 
---
“Other hunter place trap here” 
---
“Hey tank, you’ll want the boss here facing away from us” 
---
Etc etc 
---
Plus if you’re also master looting, having a speed ability is nice to catch up with the raid if a good piece of loot drops and takes a bit longer to hand out.
---
&gt;how classic will play out once we realize how convenient certain retail features are
---
This is the #1 selling point for me and I quit during wotlk so I never even got to experience the cata/post-cata wow
---
Can some1 explain to me what's going on here? texture and model swapping? recent reetail ban? what?
---
Certainly possible.  During progression some guilds do up to 3 nights a week.  But once content is on farm which will be very fast (week or 3) for most guilds then it will get back to \~2 nights a week.  Our guild currently has the membership to support 2 and maybe a 3rd 40 man raid group.  Running them on different nights means we can bring in alts from the other raid groups as support.  Several are planning to dual raid in both groups. 
---
You might have the best luck finding one east coast and one west coast guild whose raid times don't overlap, or day time + late night set up as days can sometimes shift due to wonky things like holidays, server down time, etc.
---
Can i ask a supplement engi question? How does gnome racial +15 to engi lvl work? Just gives you a head start of starting on lvl 15? or is there any unique stuff you can craft at engi lvl 315?
---
Crafting a wand early is a strat some speed runners enjoy if they are playing a caster and to my knowledge they use only Tailoring. The use of leatherworking is just to half the reliance on cloth drops, depending on your race the lw value goes up.
---
To use this strat you'd pretty much need to
---
1. Run to pick up skinning
---
2. Farm 40-60 Leather &amp; 40 Cloth
---
3. Learn LW and use all your leather on cheapest green
---
4. Drop LW
---
5. Learn Tailoring and use all your cloth on cheapest green
---
6. Drop Tailoring
---
7. Learn Enchanting
---
8. \*Optionally buy enchanting vendor mats to craft rod early
---
9. Disenchant everything you just made
---
10. Craft rod
---
11. Craft wand
---
As you can see you don't need to drop skinning, you can just craft all the required leather, drop lw and then do the same with tailoring if you wished to keep your skinning level and as most people prefer to level with skinning+mining this is probably what most would prefer. 
---
THE biggest issue with this is that on launch you have around 30 minutes to get level 6. If you don't reach that you're behind the curve and you're not longer speed running. If you get ahead of that you have something like 8 hours to reach level 20(?).
---
Speculating that you're human you'd have to run to Helene Peltskinner near the Goldshire Lake after hitting 6, no big deal it's next to the next questing hub anyway. Then you need to skin beasts or loot cloth. Assuming Fargo Kobolds drop 1 cloth every 3 mobs you're farming 120 Kobolds and now you're behind on leveling OR Level 8-10 you can kill Defias but now you're level 10. Greater Magic Wand is level 13. (the above is in addition to killing every skinnable mob you happen to run into)
---
It's pretty much the same as Dwarf, you have an abundance of beast killing quests but your linen comes from trolls which is out of the way.
---
tl;dr unless you're farming higher level mobs for exp rather than questing at the start I think just getting the wand near L10 is logical, idk how/why speedrunners go for it at level 6 but maybe I'm missing something.
---
I like this kind of thing!

The client was uploaded to Blizzard's servers to allow for Blizzard Employees (and historically this also included friends and family) to join in on their internal alpha. It can be downloaded "manually", just not through the battle.net launcher. Of course, this will not give you access to the actual servers, but you can run around in what is essentially a stripped down private server (usually just called sandboxes).
---
That's correct.
---
Of course not
---
It's REALLY bad. I feel debased just knowing these people exist.
---
I mean Pre Raid BiS.
---
Rank 10 is not that hard
---
Interesting. I think that’s what is selling most people, is that none of the convenience features in retail will be in classic, and I’m thinking how convenient it is that I can experience the raid content that’s out now with my busy life and that I may not be able to in classic like I could when I was 15
---
I remember long trips from the gy and pulling more than 1 thing equaled death. I remember running everywhere and by the time I got to 40 I couldn't afford a mount. I remember trying to find groups in chat for VC not DM cause DM was dire maul and van cleef was the boss for dead mines. Shit bro I'm having flashbacks as we speak. PTSD flashbacks 😂
---
You're forgetting the gnome mage in that picture.
---
...they can herb while bubbled?
---
Fuckin AWESOME
---
Oh ok. Hard to tell sometimes
---
..and you're setting yourself up for a miserable life if you only date girls who cringe at the one thing you're passionate about.
---
I don't know about that. Early Vanilla was really caster gear starved. Classic wont be.
---
I'm surprised
---
I'm sorry for hurting OP's feelings. Will you make sure he's tucked into bed tonight? I swear I won't say anything bad in his comment section again. Scout's promise.
---
Eh, the conveniences of retail are facilitated by the systems within. Things like earlier mounts and flying are things that became necessary as the world got bigger for example. Im fine with the actual gameplay archae, its the minor cosmetic things that im going to miss, like updated race models and bows showing up on the back instead of melee weapons (for hunters)'
---
What you call "problems" is an experience many people are looking for in a game like WoW. They want people to be different because it makes the entire MMORPG experience more fun.
---
This entire post is frankly just tailored to yourself, you see certain vanilla features as problems because you have a min-maxing mindset when playing the game even though you can't live up to those standards. If you don't have the time to play enough to get the best gear possible then that's simply not you, you'll have to be the more casual person that stands and watches a guy /flex in his t2 gear on-top of Org bank roof.
---
Also just because I wonder, how can you consider yourself a min-maxer if you're not in a guild in retail? I'm pretty sure you won't be able to pug mythic raids in retail so no matter what you will be behind in retail aswell.
---
I played vanilla about 6 month after release, and I still won’t comment on a lot of things as it was 15 years ago, I can’t remember last weekend let alone a game I played then! I still play retail now and only skipped legion.
---
My excitement for Classic is specifically because it won’t have some features that are part of the retail experience.
---
Dungeon Finder, Multiple tiers of raid difficultly and a largely meaningless leveling experience.
---
Xfire #thegoodoldtime
---
That's too bad. I like it on the pserver that sounds like flight's dope with the exception of the racism crap
---
Of all places I was the saddest about Thousand Needles. Filling it in with water just pissed me off to no end.
---
All the shit you talk about is why I want Vanilla. It makes the world more cohesive.
---
I don't care about having 900 people on my friends list I want 9 that I have a bond with and can trust because we live on the same server.
---
I don't care if someone tags a mob after I'd been waiting for 5 minutes. If they did that means they were there first and I was the one that was intruding.
---
Etc. Etc.
---
I want the world to feel alive again. Retail doesn't. Its filled with people who ignore each other because they KNOW they will probably never see them again.
---
I'll never get to experience Vanilla again like it was the first time, but I sure as shit can enjoy the world building that the community does.
---
My little brother, the trailer was all it took for him to want to play it :D
---
Haha. Yeah man. It was a rough time. When you really think about it, it could be rough
---
It became a joke.
---
it makes it easier to level engi, as the different craftables will remain orange/yellow/red for 15 skill levels more. Also, there's some items or at least one that i know of, the arcanite dragonling, which will be lvl 62 or 63 instead of lvl 60 when you use them.
---
It is pretty refreshing indeed
---
Yeah there was, Closed beta and open stress test actually
---
This guy's guild was involved and they claim EU records on first 60 during closed beta and highest level attained during stress test so they definitely got to prep beforehand
---
I'm for no changes, but imagine if in 2019 we could finally have WoW looking like the trailers of 2004.
---
I never played vanilla WoW; I was an EverQuest player. I started with Nostalrius and I don't really see any of the things you listed as problems, because I prefer my MMOs that way. Hell, all of those "problems" are even "worse" in EQ. Raid sizes were generally much larger than 40; you could have as many as 70 people or even more depending on the raid and your guild makeup. People could fuck with you in ways that are a lot worse that tagging a mob, but generally didn't because the sense of community was even stronger since you had to rely on other players for just about everything. You would have gear that was one or two expansions outdated, but you felt more attached to it and a greater sense of achievement for earning upgrades.
---
Some of us just prefer our MMOs to be this way.
---
Why do you think only 1% of us played Vanilla?  If you are 30+ and played video games, you almost certainly played it.  All my roommates played.  My gf played.  My brothers played.  My cousins played.  Many non-gamers got addicted and definitely broke into the mainstream - I remember halting an AQ40 run to watch the new South Park episode, WoW was a true social phenomenon.  12 million subs during vanilla IIRC.  
---
Many more than 99% of this sub played in Vanilla retail, my guess would be 75% or more.
---
I remember this quest also. There were so many random ass quests in all expansions after WoTLK. I couldn’t ever make it past 8 levels below the cap without quitting.
---
&gt; advocating for changes to be made 
---
Nah, quite the contrary, I think you are deliberately misunderstanding what #nochanges is about. Not releasing 30 servers does not constitute a change to the gameplay of WoW - just as Battle.Net integration (provided it doesn't allow cross-faction conversations), modern infrastructure (provided it doesn't come with sharding and other technologies), localized servers and so forth. 
---
&gt; In addition it seems that you are promoting for larger than normal server size - the biggest issues for servers is lack of balance with their faction populations which causes toxic gameplay for players. This is much more prevalent on PvP servers which can easily swing that way.
---
What does one have to do with the other? 
---
First of all, what you think/define as being "normal" is irrelevant - whether by judging some bygone sever 2.5k or 3.5k limitation (not a deliberate gameplay one, mind you, but one imposed by the technical limitations) of ages past, or by some subjective metric you've derived by playing on private servers like I have; the reason I'm telling you why I think 1k players wouldn't cut it is because I've experienced what it's like to play with 7-900 concurrent players consistently around 2 months into the server's launch (which started with around 7-8k concurrent players), and I can describe to you with census data in front of me why that's a really bad population to have. With 900 players at peak, around half of those were level 60 and around half of those were playing on my faction which leaves us with ~220 players I could run dungeons with across both EU/NA, forget about finding 5 healing priests to make a raid team. It wasn't good for the low levels, high levels or anyone in particular and they eventually merged that server. 
---
Now if you want to say that your feelings trump my (or anyone else's) subjective experience with these sort of numbers that's fine, but I have some historical evidence to believe otherwise and Blizzard has some actual numbers and statistics when they agree that there aren't that many RP-PvP players to justify giving them their own server. Your "feelings" or opinions don't make for a good argument, I'm sure if you showed them some stats, more guilds and a petition they would reconsider, same as I.   
---
Second, the type of faction imbalance you've seen on retail was gravely accelerated by allowing for faction transfers as well as modifying racials to make them OP for PvP (on the Alliance side) and PvE (on the Horde side). That's why you still see 90% of the top tier PvE guilds playing Horde and most of the PvP top arena players (at least historically speaking) playing on the Alliance side. Even if there was the case and faction imbalance was imminent, I don't see how RP-PvP could be spared from this like they're some special snowflakes which aren't prone to the same shit as everyone else. Far be it for faction imbalance to be, as you put it:
---
&gt; the biggest issues for servers
---
I can think of worse things like server instability, dead population (which is still a problem on retail), and really long server queues. Adding more servers could mitigate these problems initially for sure, but we'll end up in the same position as retail right now if we open up too many realms from the start. If you're playing on a 30/70 faction imbalanced server you can do something about it - group up, play smarter, get better, avoid dangerous areas - but if you have no one to play with then there is no fix for this, you can't solo dungeons or elite quests and everything. 
---
&gt; Unlike any other server's RP-PvP generally has the best balance in regards to server population across factions - it would thusly make sense to put restrictions to prevent this for server longevity.
---
You just went down the conspiracy shit-hole. It's the same stupid reasoning as the one with subliminal satanic messages in Judas Priest songs, [Bill Hicks has you covered.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyrtHC3U_YU).  
---
I suspect that the reason RP-PvP is more balanced there is because nobody in his/her right mind tends to go to an RP-PvP server for serious PvP or PvE content. At least in the EU, the best guilds - whether we're talking average guilds or high-end world first racing guilds - are on PvP/PvE servers. Nobody says "yeah, I wanna do some kickass arenas and high-end mythic raiding, let me hit up Defias Brotherhood" - no, they go to Kazzak, Draenor, Tarren Mill, Ragnaros, Twisting Nether or they get told to go there. Not saying RP realms don't raid - just that on average they tend to raid less and/or not as good as the others, and I can pull plenty of averages and historical data from sites like wowprogress to support that. Myself and many other friends I know transferred from dead realms to the aforementioned ones so we could join good guilds and raid properly. I'm sorry if this comes as a surprise to you, but people who are interested in PvE/PvP progress don't really go to places where people devote a lot of time to RP activities because they do nothing to contribute to their goals. I am running what is probably the largest and most serious WPvP guild myself and I would never touch on anything RP-PvP related because of stupid I think their ["terms of engagement"](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/abpcse/a_scheduled_rpwpvp_campaign/ed2tv7t/) are because I don't give two fucks what some RP-ing crybaby declares or thinks victory or fairness is in the open world, they can go to BGs if they care about that.
---
Blizzard has always said PvP is an ingame problem that requires ingame solutions.  If you don't want ganked, then change to a PvE server or have friends and guild members help you.  I've seen this mirrored by dozens of blue posts and community managers over the years.
---
There has never been an exception that I've see proof of.  Even on RP/PvP realm rules, trolling the innocent victim out of character there is no penalty for doing so. i.e only bannable if you break the RP rules.  Crashing RP is normally an offensive, but not if by ganking.
---
I see comments like yours all the time.  But nothing written in blue text.
---
Tauren only server when?
---
Lord of the rings did
---
Azshara felt remote. There were never may other people there so you could get lost in the immersion. Beautiful colors, eerie ruins and interesting geography. It was a great zone.
---
What they did to 1k, for me, hurt more though. 1k was full of life, people questing and farming constantly. PvP over quest mobs and ore. Between levels 23 and 40 I usually did a loop or two of mining there so when I hit 40 I had the gold for my mount. I spent a lot of time there and after cata it just died. 
---
Bring on Classic!
---
I love doing darkshore&gt;ashenvale/stonetalon on alliance, especially because you'll meet a lot of horde for some world pvp. When you're questing in stonetalon as alliance it really feels like you're far, far away from civilization and surrounded by enemies.
---
A lot of people here have played private servers and more or less know what they're getting themselves into. There's also a large chunk that will drop out somewhere before level 30 because they don't fully realize what the leveling process is like. I think private servers are close enough, I don't buy this "they're totally different!" nonsense. As far as leveling goes they've got it pretty much down. If you play an hour a day every single day it will take 4 months to hit 60.
---
You will always be behind in Classic because like you said we're not teenagers any more and can't play 4+ hours a day. And that's fine. There's a finite end to the content and there's no big rush to get there, plenty of people will be playing casually. Thousands of people still play vanilla on private servers, even on 15 year old content so I really don't think the community will go anywhere. You might be running through dungeons with someone's 2nd or 3rd alt but that's their prerogative.
---
You're right that getting 40 people together sucks, but I think pugs are more accepted now. Alternatively lots of smaller guilds will run ZG/AQ20, then group up with another guild to run raid content. One of the benefits of 40 man raids is that if you need to take care of something for 5-10 minutes go take care of it. Dont log out and nobody will even notice you're gone. If 40 competent players are doing MC/BWL, then they can do it with 39 players on some bosses it's really not a big deal. Naxx is another story but you likely won't even make it that far.
---
My faction had way fewer people I'm vanilla and we would get instant queues thanks to the massive alliance pop. I felt so bad for them though because we'd farm the shit out of them. They would spend over an hour in queue just to be 5 capped by us in AB or destroyed in wsg almost instantly. Good times.
---
I min max in pvp since I can’t commit to pve. I’ve gotten glad and try to push r1. 
---
You’re 100% right that it’s tailored to myself as a min maxer and it bugs me I can’t commit to that level in classic. I’ll have to settle which bugs me, but I guess the post was an attempt to see how many others feel the same way
---
You don’t find any of those features convenient?
---
&gt;About the Necropile set, I'm not sure what you mean? if you search for \[...\]  it shows up.
---
Yet it doesn't show in Allakhazam at patch 1.2. Since you got your website down I made this : [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bi2zik/spreadsheet\_from\_all\_items\_that\_were\_available/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bi2zik/spreadsheet_from_all_items_that_were_available/)
---
Where did you get your item list if I may ask ?
---
By the way, huge thanks for your website, I can't live without it (please don't take it down anymore, or I'll have to parse Allakhazam again \^\^ ).
---
i'd always be the one dps warrior who taunted and instadie because none of the healers expected it ;\_;
---
&gt;Multiple sources, mostly in French, all confirm that the very first EU server player to get to level 60 was Cau, a Shaman of Archimonde (EU - FR) rolling with the War Legend guild.
---
Firstly, with a name like Cau I really hope it was a tauren. Secondly, I'm super impressed he managed to get a 3-letter name.  Even at launch unwound imagine that they get taken really quickly.
---
😐
---
I've always heard it was at the time of spawning and there was a way to game loot tables in raid ID's because of it. 
---
It has been a long time since I came across this information so it may be wrong and I have no sources to provide.
---
It starts low again
---
I remember having XFire but I can't remember what it actually did anymore.
---
99% sure it resets it.
---
Sooo take Hundertwasser? Or some painting from Dalí? Or Martin Eden from Jack London? Maybe you dont like that Frodo survived the Ring War and it would fit better to just make him die by the hands of Faramir? 
---
Point is: dont advocate changing a piece of art and not expect people start shitting all over you.
---
I have no idea how Blizzard does it, but as a software dev I would determine it only once someone loot the mob, it would be best to save server resources.
---
You die before looting the mob ? Then I don't spend some processor time determining loot.
---
The fact it's incomplete is disappointing.
---
I remember starting a new dwarf back in the day, the snow effects and the atmosphere completely blew me away.
---
If you want to compare ganking and twinking to retail PvE that's fine dude, just don't expect that to be popular option.  Certainly those concepts predate WoW entirely.
---
I see 100% where you’re coming from. I just think the target audience must be different comparing classic to retail. I’m a try hard at everything, so I’ll give it my best.
---
I can see why people prefer their MMOs that way
---
I think you mean it gave you \*moosebumps.
---
I'm looking through various dates and even the forum. You can tell it was constructed by devs and not multi billion dollar publishers just due to the language used to describe shit.
---
You want to raid seriously on two characters, on separate factions? 
---
Have you played classic before? Do you realize how big of an undertaking that is? You're in for a rude awakening and I don't mean to sound elitist but I don't think it's an attainable goal (particularly if one has a job). You can have perfect time-management skills and it still won't be possible, mate. That amount of grinding will inevitably take its toll on your body. Don't say I didn't warn you.
---
&gt;all laws and rules are inherently just because they are laws or rules
---
Nope. Anyway DUIs puts others in life-threatening danger, so it was a terrible comparison.
---
The macro's might not work, but blizzard would have to limit addons pretty substantially to prevent mouseover healing with the help of an addon.
---
In TBC it was the time you zone into the raid the loot is set ( see old warglave drama)
---
Thanks for validating my point
---
Yessssd this game was amazing! An old roommate had it and we would have entire days long sessions with around 6 or so people. The good old days for sure.
---
uh.... okay?
---
I didn't start till 1.10 and only raided MC cause BWL was too hard for my guild
---
I'm going to roll a Gnome in Classic, what do i need to know to prepare myself from being bullied?
---
Do gnomes have a support group?
---
Is it better to just constantly stealth around Ironforge to not get picked on? 
---
:(

Patch 1.4 release date: 19 April 2005
---
Patch 1.3 release date: 7 March 2005
---
Conclusion: Necropile set existed in patch 1.2 :)
---
Would’ve been better if they were all impaled
---
I was like awwew shit yeah here comes undercity/ruins of Lordaeron then it ended
---
So what happens when you're not  "flavor of the phase" anymore ? You get stuck to a char that you have no connection with ?
---
Yeah I was speaking more to their point about not many people playing Vanilla. It was a serious cultural phenomenon from 2004 - 2007.
---
:)
---
You don’t *need* eng till 60. 
---
If anything pick up mining and save your mats. Then use em all to powerlevel eng at 60. Sell all extra ore
---
Sounds like account sharing to me
---
No as far as i know not.
---
10 minutes before cross-realm would have my vote.
---
I really like this comment. 100% true
---
Are you in a hurry or something? You dont have to play 8h a week to experience content. Anyway, having undefeated content makes the game seem bigger. Classic wow is an RP experience, at least in some sense. Retail isn't, in any sense
---
The employee alpha is going on right now and auto loot is currently an option in the settings.  Not the crazy AoE looting or what ever retail has, but you don't have to hold shift to pick up all items.
---
This was in the leaked screenshots irrc.
---
Private servers have done this.
---
They are always ghost towns.
---
For a reason.
---
Imagine accepting every metaphors at face value without critical thinking cuz muh brain fashion muh vindication muh sapiens. 
---
Protip: if you want your diction to come off as intelligent don’t butcher it with comma splices. 
---
It was a bad comparison because DUIs affect other people where as character texture editing affects only yourself.
---
It’s the difference between violent and nonviolent crimes.
---
Well a normal person would try to learn something and see what mistake he made and what he can do so it will never happen again.  Normal person would improve his own security behavior.   
---
You see the problem somewhere else. Someone else should have made it so you don't get hacked...... interesting outlook on life problems.
---
You know you can put people into ignore list right ?
---
They're basically completely different genres of games at this point.
---
One is an open-world, roleplaying experience where you make your own adventure and sitting in a city trying to recruit people to go raid a dangerous dungeon with you *is* an integral part of playing the game.
---
The other is more of a twitchy action game where if you're not plowing through dungeons back to back and looting tons of upgrades then it's "boring."
---
Good looking group
---
It's generated at spawn/instance creation. It was confirmed in a blue post but that's long gone. 
---
&gt;Drysc explains on the American WoW forums:
---
&gt;" Loot is generated upon creation.
---
As soon as you step into an instance, or a mob is created in the world, the loot that's going to drop has already been determined."
---
&gt;What are the variables in the random generator's kernel, is it based on some attribute of the players in the raid, or the raid leader?
---
&gt;"Heh no, I believe it uses a time stamp to seed the generator. So, there's nothing you can influence within the game that would alter or coerce the generator.
---
The time it uses to seed would have no real implication into the final outcome of what loot its given. On a long enough generation table, you may see some type of pattern based purely on a random generators inability to truly be random. But we're talking about astronomical numbers, something ridiculous like hundreds of billions of generations. Nothing you would or could see a pattern in during your time playing the game.
---
What you're seeing is pure and basic laws of probability. Have a few thousand people roll a pair of dice and you're bound to see hundreds of people able to roll snake-eyes 10 times in a row. (not that dice are truly random either)
---
&gt;As for Quest items, they are always there, they're just hidden if you don't have the quest."
---
[source](https://www.sk-gaming.com/content/15628-Loot_generation_clarified)
---
Don't see how that makes any difference, still have everything keybound and in muscle memory.
---
Redditors and WoW nerds that look normal?
---
Fake.
---
Is account sharing against the rules on private servers though ?
---
Wasn’t it like ventrillo?
---
Instead of holding shift and clicking to auto loot like vanilla, you can just enable auto loot then use shift to only open the loot window
---
You sound like you are thinking about AOE looting.
---
u/wegwacc is this your OC? This is fucking unbelievable
---
The longer time you give a caster to live the more counter options they have to kill you.
---
The only scenario where you should open with garrote on a caster is on a mage because mages can blink out of cheapshot.
---
Ive toyed with the idea aswell, even going as far to try a double garrote/imp. kick spelllock but the dmg is just not there to finish the fight as fast as ambush/bs would do.
---
Not to mention deadly poison takes a while to get 5 stacks off on your target because you dont have Shiv ability like in TBC.
---
Id say against a druid in bearform or warrior though rupture and garrote is good because it ignores armor.
---
I was hesitating too but I've decided to roll female dwarf pally because their healing animations are the best, plus you're super rare and because of that people are most likely going to remember you.
---
No no you see all rules exist for a reason and therefore all rules are inherently correct and just because they are rules.
---
The correct rule that blizzard should implement is that texture editing in a way that does affect other is a violation of ToS, but your personal character can be whatever it wants.
---
Appeals to majoritarianism = fallacy
---
I saw it back in a card thing in a warcraft III case.
---
 Imagine if Radim Zeifart, aka Hurricane, aka the maker of those Opening of the Gates of AQ and Naxx patch trailers, made this.
---
You don't think there would be any issues with banks profiting on IP they don't have permission to use?
---
Cata doesn't deserve its reputation. Every high-level zone it introduced had incredible questlines. Vashj'ir remains the third best questing zone of all time. I think nostalgia overrides a lot of people's desire to try and accurately judge the revamped starting zones: the quests are actually well put together. The only problem is that they don't make sense after Deathwing was downed. Furthermore, they introduced flying to mainland Azeroth, which they deserve a great deal of technical credit for.
---
How is that different to determining loot at the time the mob spawns..?
---
Is it ? I played wow on trial account recently. Run few dungeons did some quests and so on. In no dungeon group did anyone from the group spoke a word. Not even hi.  
---
I even wondered if I am actually playing with players or just bots. It felt like single player game to me. A one that is too easy to be fun.  
---
Playing on private server was a night and day difference - grouping up while questing common place actually needing to discuss stuff as CC in dungeons .... so on.
---
More like a MSN version for gamers.
---
I didn't play wow till mists, but having this trailer pop up in my YouTube recommended on a slow night got my interest.
---
That orc was metal af.
---
Fire rocks in MC, you just need to know how to play and spec it. :)
---
Make that three times then
---
Nice, thanks man! :D
---
I really like this question because I’m asking myself why I’m rushing and now that I think about it, I don’t know, I guess I just don’t want to feel like I’m behind in progression or gear. Knowing another guild is already smashing MC while my guilds figuring out Lucifron just discourages me I guess
---
Judging from u/LawrenceLongShot 's post, you are dead on!
---
I did MC including Rag as a fire mage.  As I stated, there were times when I needed to use frostbolt, but the damage just kept coming.  Using scorch on Garr's minions saved my mana pool, timed mana pots, health and mana herbs, always kept me going.
---
My point is that you're contradicting yourself. You can't say progressive content makes sense while progressive items don't. They're two sides of the same coin.
---
According to you, we should have Naxx on Day 1 because that's "authentic" 1.12.
---
Ever more convenience does not equal good, meaningful nor fun in a game. You need to realise this before you understand why people want classic.
---
You guys are giving a master class in Missing the Point right here.
---
Cata zones were good overall. Vashjir was amazing. What they did to Azeroth was dumb as shit and flying in Azeroth was part of the beginning of the end
---
This makes total sense, but apparently isn't the way it is? I guess the only draw back to that is that if a lot of mobs died at a specific time, you'd have a huge processor spike. Whereas if its determined on spawning, the system could space the spawns out slightly, eliminating a huge peak. But as a software dev, you'd know FAR more about that than I would.
---
I think by far the worst were the changes for the old content in Cata. Most of the quests changed to "funny", child friendly jokes. The whole epic feeling was gone in favor of streamlined quest hubs. 
---
MoP has some very cool moments by the way (yes, I also hate Pandas but the xpac was quite good). Everything past MoP, let's not talk about it.
---
That's a pretty cool little trick! Would be interesting to see if that still works.
---
It’s amazing. Between blue posts and these quality submissions this sub is probably my favourite on reddit right now
---
On a scale of 1 to LFR, how easy is PvE going to be now that we know we're getting buffed items, buffed talents, and nerfed bosses?
---
Part of me is glad that PvE is being even further trivialized since I prefer PvP, but the other part of me is disappointed because I thought they'd try to create an authentic experience.
---
If collusion like that is presented and proven to blizzard it should result in bans for all members of the premade teams.
---
Against Mages you can Gouge the Blink after CS, against Warriors you'll want to open CS because you need time to crippling poison (among other things) in order to kite around their deadzone.
---
Shamans can't. They really need mana tide totem.
---
Druids and Paladins can do content with only 21 points in the healing tree tho.
---
Could you please link me those quests pleasE?
---
Nice job ignoring the question
---
&gt;	not willfully ignorant of that fact, and thus agree that it is a rule that makes sense.
---
I’ve never textured edited and think the rule is at best lazy or at worst stupid.
---
You  pointed out that “players models are one thing” because it’s obvious that player models are complete unharmful to the game. Who gives a shit if you want your character to look like Goku. It doesn’t affect anyone. 
---
&gt;	Next stop is map textures, and hello Nurse, I’m looking through walls in WSG.
---
Right, and this is what should be banned because unlike character editing this editing it has negative externalities. It allows you to cheat. *This* is what should be banned, not character editing which is what the vast majority of editors do, and that’s exactly why Activision unbanned everyone. 
---
The blanket ban is just laziness, as they don’t want to have to differentiate between who is cheating and who isn’t. The obvious solution would be to only flag those who edit things that aren’t their character, but it’s Activision.
---
Things I hated in Vanilla :
---
\- 1 hour in the dungeon : "sorry mum said it's supper time, I have to go guys"
---
\- "plizzzzzz dud can u giv mi 1G so much plizzzzzzzzzzzzzz neeed !" 
---
\- StupidOverGearedMage sheeps you. StupidOverGearedMage starts to cast pyro. Pyro of StupidOverGearedMage crits you for 3000 damage. StupidOverGearedMage gains presence of mind Pyro of StupidOverGearedMage crits you for 3000 damage. You die.
---
\- raid times are from 9 PM until after midnight. Wake up early to go to work ? Suck to be you. Want to PUG it in the week-end ? Enjoy the wipes.
---
\- as a tank : "dude I'm the best DPS of the server. I give full DPS at the beginning, if you can't hold agro go play a healer !!!"
---
\- as a healer :  "dude where are the heals, we wiped. Not my problem you were OOM, if we die it means you suck !"
---
\-  RandomRogue's rogue ambush crits you for 3000 damage. You die. RandomRogue spits on you. RandomRogue spits on you. RandomRogue spits on you. RandomRogue spits on you. RandomRogue spits on you. RandomRogue spits on you.
---
\- Not enough rage. Not enough rage. Not enough rage. Not enough rage. Not enough rage. Not enough rage. Not enough rage. Not enough rage. 
---
(works with mana and energy too :o )
---
\- as a rogue : open trade window with a locked chest in it. No hello, no please. Repeat 20 times every time you're in a capital city 
---
\- as a mage : "portal to UC, water and food pliz". Repeat 20 times every time you're in a capital city 
---
\- as a demo : didn't play long enough to get flooded with TP requests :p
---
\- and on and on and on
---
Why I'm giddy to play classic again ? I tried to come back 2 years ago at Legion. Didn't last a month !
---
That's funny. I hated 6-9 on the druid and then trying to solo that overpowered space chicken to get bear form and after that I only liked bear form. You could easily moonfire pull, bear, heal up, repeat all the way to 60. Cat form, unless you got lucky crits which were infrequent, didn't kill fast AT ALL and so I'd get frustrated and stay in bear form. Cat simply does crap damage (at least if you are used to rogue evis) and so I find bear form just generally better all around with the exception of getting the jump on someone, then it's back to caster/bear.
---
I know but sometimes you miss the window and failed to Gouge, and also i feel that most mages panic when spell-locked and forget to turn they backs away from you :P
---
In lineage II you could sit and auto sell stuff
---
lol is this real?
---
Tranq
---
You'll be right, you're not a female dwarf or troll.
---
Did you check on [archive.org](https://archive.org) ?
---
You can literally look at the numbers something your always quoting but now you result to just insulting people. The same tactic used by people that can't take that someone has a different view point and is putting forward solid arguments by resulting in calling it conspiracy etc etc and relating it to satanic messages.
---
You are quite clearly showing the character you are here and you are deciding to call RP-PvPer's things because you had a problem with a community you played on you have made it your quest to scourge against RP-PvP servers.
---
Im a guy that views rules of engagement to be a load of rubbish, you have to play with what you have got and conflicts in WoW were never fair.
---
You have allowed your judgement of roleplay to become clouded much like some of those individual's i've spoken to from the RP servers and their clouded judgements about other players and such toxicity is what has started to kill roleplay slowly like an infected wound.
---
The more you bury the head the more you will drive RP down - your being the crybaby right now by intentionally harassing people that seek a particular server type not because of the "reasons" you so claim but because you have a hatred for things you've seen and witnessed rather than turning the other cheek you yourself are promoting the idea of the toxicity of the WoW Classic Community - you are an adult aren't you so why don't you understand each person see's WoW Classic in their own way and wants their home.
---
Now start trying to make connections across the community rather than scattering it and weakening it, the more we scatter and make our own nest's the more issues will arise when we don't work together because blizzard decides to do something that will harm classic.
---
It was a good comparison. Case closed.
---
Like the other guy said, the 1.4 and 1.11 PvP blues are completely different items, so we should be getting the 1.4 versions on phase 2.
---
I guess thats just the way it is. I’m just gonna take it chill, no guides, no other bs and many others are gonna do so too. Magic of classic WoW isnt rushing through the raids or getting R14, but rather adventure round the vast world and communicate with other players.
---
Obviously there are as many playstyles as there are people
---
God I wish they made a The Return 2 though eh?
---
It wasn’t. Next.
---
You shouldn't stop at death ray, there's other gnomish stuff to craft before abandoning it and go goblin.
---

---
No matter whether you are questing or in instances, pulling extra adds is bad. Mostly ends up in wipes and graveyards are not convenient places most of the time and corpse runs are long and shitty.
---
Fact. Trolls are the best.
---
you should narrow it down to a couple and write down the names.  on launch day create multiple characters right away to reserve the names.
---
I disagree. I think the intro animation is iconic enough that it would have went much better with the WoW login theme because the music is so iconic to us players.
---
&gt;without critical thinking
---
Confusing the semantic meaning of a metaphor with a pointless comparison of shape, time or size between two things, is not "critical thinking", it's dumb.
---
&gt;Protip: if you want your diction to come off as intelligent don’t butcher it with comma splices.
---
Protip, if you wanna people taking you seriously, don't play Grammar Na\*i
---
&gt;It was a bad comparison
---
According to no one but you.
---
That's not at all how credit works.
---
Litrually
---
it's like real life :(
---
Agreed about Vash'jir that whole experience was fantastic.
---
Sorry but the case was already closed. Your whining is ignored.
---
You playing with the shadow war expansion?
---
The "game of thrones intro: wow edition" has been around for years now (since 2015 to be exact). I wouldn't really consider it a meme either.
---
If I roll warrior, what's my likelyhood of only tanking? I know in 5 man's, tanking is heavy sought out, but in raids, not all warriors can tank so it is almost required to always have a dps and tank set?
---
You could set up like a vendor in Everquest too!
---
Just like you missing the argument.
---
&gt;ignored
---
And yet here you are
---
Yes. Sappers and Grenades are amazing.
---
Reflectors are also great, so is Dimensional Ripper, cables, Arcanite Dragonling, Battle Chicken
---
He litrually said it the way I used to say it when I was 8. 
---
No change is affecting vocabulary too :O
---
No what is right is to test what works or doesn't for you.
---
99.9% of people just parrot the group think, they never bother to make their opinion.
---
I used imp slam back in Vanilla but I was lvl 60 and it was in raids so it doesn't apply to a lvl 30 char.
---
I used dual wielding while levelling. If you listen to the parrots here you would think I'd still be trying to reach lvl 60 after all those misses \^\^ DW felt good at the time, but I don't have numbers to back it up. The deciding factor is probably more a matter of having a good rare 1h or 2h weapon.
---
If imp slam doesn't work for him, he can wait lvl 40, pay 1G to respec for a cookie cutter build.
---
Seriously I had a lot of fun on nost until I had to move timezone and it was so cancer to play with eu/Chinese/Russian i ended up quitting. Eu servers have really toxic players tbh even on wotlk servers and bc servers
---
Yes you can! That's what the very hardcore eng people do: Craft the gnomish BoPs then respec to goblin for the consumables.
---
Well, why donÄt you take the video then, research a fitting piece from the Warcraft OST, and put the two together?
---
I am a bit rusty on copyright, but I think something like that would be covered under "fair use", as long as you mention the original videos author/channel in the comments.
---
Would love to see the result =)
---
yes dos not rly work, i guess because the database is missing or something.
---
How many weeks does it realistically take to progress from say rank 8-14? And once you get R14 assuming you have the gold to buy the gear, once you have the gear, you don't need to keep the rank to still equip the gear, correct?
---
its insane how something as simple as a mount just felt so fucking epic. like its so quaint now but at the time it was the coolest possible thing ever.
---
But it’s the content that’s most important right? Any feature that facilitates that would, in my eyes, be seen as a positive. Enjoy more content, with less downtime, within the scopes of your personal schedule
---
There was a lawyer from Texas that I met back in vanilla who's entire play time was cracking open beers and ganking in Redridge and Duskwood. That's it. Literally. The guy took forever to level and only healed instances to 60, but when he got there he was ruthless. Talked to him in vent. Turns out we knew some other people from a different game who played alliance and they would tell us about how chat was filled with people complaining about his druid ganking all of the time. He'd pass out at his keyboard.
---
I dunno man, lawyers gonna lawyer I guess.
---
Do not try and rush your way to max level. So many of the frustrating parts of the original WoW experience are only frustrating when your sole focus is getting to 60 as fast as possible. The levelling experience is slow enough (for a variety of reasons) that there is a very high probability of burnout unless you have something you are enjoying in the present. 
---
Find a class, race, and spec that you enjoy and explore the world. Join dungeon groups, help out with difficult quests, make friends, and mess around in BGs. Make alts and see the different starting zones and play styles (if your anything like me, one of them might become your new main). Duel random people in quest hubs. Pull multiple mobs to test the limits of your character. Check out zones that are too high level for you and laugh when you pull a wolf from miles away and get one-shotted (looking at you Felwood—Ashenvale border).
---
I met someone in the Barrow Dens in Teldrassil and we are still friends today. At one point I switched class and then out-levelled her, so I waited for her to catch up at levels 48-49 and just did BGs. That is probably some of the most fun I have ever had doing PvP.
---
In short, forget the endgame while you're levelling and have fun. Level 60 will be there waiting for you.
---
Your post has been automatically removed because you used a keyword which is reserved for the subreddit moderators.
---
That is true. Do we have a blue post about the rules of dodging games ?
---
Also looks unfinished, I’m sure there could be more
---
In 5 mans, 99%.
---
In raids, it's a long shot to tank. Most raiding guilds are formed around at least 2 tanks as officers. Unless your making your own guild, you'll likely be joining as a DPS warrior and maybe get move to tank if/when the MT/OT burn out, need a break, etc.
---
Not if said majority includes the deciding entitiy/factor, which in this case it does.
---
Plus, it's called _"Argumentum ad Populum"_.
---
If you wana sound smart, at least use the correct wording, even if your premise turns out to be wrong.
---
Well, any leveling guide will do, you should cap your skinning long before you level cap any way, and you can take time out to level LW any time you feel.
---
Pretty much every guide tells you to grind between quests and just make sure you have atleast 170(I think) skinning before starting the mastery quests in STV, that will get you high enough to skin everything in ferelas and you should get 300 there or near enough. 
---
As for LW, I guess just follow an independent leveling guide as you go and mix it in when you want to craft new gear etc.
---
Ignored again.
---
This WILL happen. Aren't PvP servers awesome?!?!?!
---
Hahaha wooow... I'm not even sure what to say... You really going to extrapolate that much from that little?
---
It wasn't uncommon for friends and family to take shifts playing.  My buddy who didn't have a PC used to stay the night and sleep at a weird time to play when I went to bed.
---
I remember going to worldofwarcraft.com I think, although maybe it was blizzard.com... idk, I don’t think it was battlenet yet. And just scrolling through the fan art wallpapers...
---
I mean if you want to get into semantics we’re not even talking about metaphors. We’ve been talking about analogies.
---
The substance of the comparison is actually the basis of the comparison. I encourage you to google the difference before using semantics to weasel out of a bad argument. 
---
&gt;	You’re dismissing a warning about fire by way of comparing its dangers to that of a hotplate, on the grounds that hotplates are not yellow and flickering.
---
This is so dumb I can’t even comprehend it. Both are dangerous. 
---
Character editing isn’t dangerous.
---
Battleground editing is dangerous.
---
That’s the differerence that seems to escape you.
---
Yep you're not wrong, I'm only thinking about CA procs in terms of PVP where you are self buffed and won't be popping many consumes / have tons of debuffs on the target.  
---
You would have to gear kind of oddly to have 400 sp as a Ret too, I think even if you stick only to full t2.5 you have about 150sp there from 5 pieces, and then have to fill it out with a bunch of different pieces.
---
Honestly if I were going to grief people, I think it would be wayyyyy more fun to shadowmeld near raid instances and dispell everyone's raid buffs.  You can get away from gankers no problem even though it might be frustrating....but having to spend time farming world buffs and having them dispelled....man that's REAL hazing shit right there.
---
No, didnt know it existed actually! Is it good?
---
Take BRD for example. 
---
One rogue enter the instance to pickpocket a few mobs but you generated loot for every mob in the instance for nothing since none of them will be looted.
---
I guess if Blizzard does otherwise there's a good reason for it, maybe it's about latency but IDK.
---
Do the darnassus rep and get a sabre at 40. Then you'll be rolling in streetcred.
---
No
---
Yes!  They need to do everything they can to pair you with and against players from your own server.  Vanilla is all about KNOWING your teammates and enemies.
---
One final thing to keep in mind as well:  On current Vanilla servers, the PvP rankers all know roughly how much honor they need each week and the best times for them to farm honor in BGs (aka peak times!).  Cross-server will allow players to grind BGs 24 hours a day.  It will no longer be a one-person grind to r14 when that happens.  You will have to buy your rank from Chinese farmers or do ToS breaking shit like having 3 ppl logging in and playing one character throughout the day.
---
We've already been down this slippery slop with cross realms and it began the exodus of the same population Blizzard is trying to get back.  They HAVE to do something different this time if they are even considering x-realms.
---
200-300 hours unless you're some kind of pro and skipping a lot of quests.
---
Depending on your class, it's worth jumping over to Silverpine. A few of the chains have some great rewards, and lore wise it's far more interesting than the barrens. Try and get as much of the WC chain done as you can, then head over to silver pine around 12, stay there till you run RFC, come back to silver pine, then over to barrens at 17 to finish up the WC chain and start looking for groups there.
---
&gt;	Not if said majority includes the deciding entitiy/factor, which in this case it does.
---
Luckily you didn’t say that and no one is debating whether that’s the case. 
---
&gt;	Plus, it's called "Argumentum ad Populum".
---
Holy cringe
---
I'm going to playing a gnome mage and I had a couple questions:
---
1. When doing lvl-60 content, does frostbite still affect monsters in raids or should I respec and get rid of frostbite and shatter?
---
2. What were the common ranks of frostbolt and blizzard people would use to prevent going oom so quickly in raids and dungeons?
---
3. What were the stat priority on gear for mages? Like was ~25 increased damage with spells better than increased 1% chance for crit on spells?
---
4. Was there any benefit of having a higher range for spells on a pve server with arctic reach?
---
5. Was the only reason that mages swapped to fire for AG only damage or was there more to it?
---
It's probably based on BfA where there is not
---
Yeah I have read the other answers.
---
It's possible that determining loot is absolutely not processor hungry, or maybe they're grouping it in big batches to be more efficient (like spell batching), I don't know.
---
I'm not a game dev, I work on absolutely boring problems where performance is not a concern, so I probably don't know much more than you, really \^\^
---
&gt;The obvious solution would be to only flag those who edit things that aren’t their character
---
No, the obvious solution is to make the scanning engine adhere to the KISS principle (Keep It Simple and Stupid), **which means less prone to error, easier to implement, maintain and upgrade, and less resource intensive on the players hardware**, and take a total checksum over ALL files of the game.
---
This comes at a cost, which is the tears of a few whiners, who cannot deal with the fact that they cannot play as Goku in WoW, but that is not a relevant factor.
---
Ignored again
---
Cool thanks. Is there not a tauren in the box?
---
I saw a Tauren as well. I don't have the game so I just googled World of WarCraft board game miniatures and found some images.
---
I really think the solution is faction locking before things get out of hand for certain servers, as was discussed in a post last week.  Cross-realm BGs, to me, is something that takes away from the essence of vanilla.  The entire game being contained within one server is a big part of what made the game great.
---
Is it better than having hours long queue times?  Of course.  But if the goal is to have an authentic vanilla experience, I think maintaining server-only battlegrounds gives us closer to that original experience.  Lock realms for the more populated faction once they get more than 60-40 with the exception of people who already have characters on the faction and a limited number of invites for their friends.
---
Yes, cross-realm BGs were a part of classic, but I would argue that this was a change that led away from classic game design despite being in patch 1.12.
---
&gt; Luckily you didn’t say that and no one is debating whether that’s the case.
---
_"My opinion has the backing **of Activision Blizzard** and most of the playerbase._"
---
Any more nonsense you want to put forward for me to disprove in public?
---
&gt;Holy cringe
---
The only cringeworthy thing is the constant whining of a few people who think the world has to give them what they feel entitled to. Luckily for us, there is a button that allows us to ignore them.
---
In that sense, farewell.
---
I imagine the main fear is the idea they would need at least 3 in the EU - RP-PvP for English, German and French.
---
As other have mentioned, there really is only 2 instances for 20 man raids.
---
So unless you start your own smaller guild, most guilds would probably want to do MC, BWL as a minimum.
---
You could though make a guild focused mostly on getting everyone their dungeon set because that takes a while too and you would also have to visit UBRS which is a 10 man instance.
---
Maybe play retail then?
---
Haha no idea. I didn’t but that one, i was hoping you could tell me lol.

Mounts are almost a status symbol, should be earned/farmed, not from an item shop/as incentive to buy a ticket to an event.
---
It is the only thing i am personally conflicted.
---
I really dont have any issue with either of those and simultaneously i have with both. 
---
Imo it all depends on the server population.If it is way bigger than vanilla cap then do it.If not get battlegroups
---
You judge people by a subreddit about servers?
---
I played WoW trial accounts for months before I got my first real copy of the game.  I was watching WWE Smackdown when I saw the commercial and Christmas 2006 I finally became a citizen of Azeroth.

Lol I don't know how to search in a spreadsheet I guess.

Always, always, always KOS rogues, and keep DoTs all over the motherfuckers
---
Im going with the horsey mount instead of saber cuz i just think it looks hilarious with a big horse and a kid sized rogue on top lol
---
Probably more
---
What's the time table for ranks 8-10?
---
Did you not play in vanilla?  I wasn't even a premade player or a hardcore PvPer, but what made it fun was seeing the same people game after game. I still remember the names of the people who killed me every day.
---
People absolutely did constantly see the same BG opponents, and this stopped once servers were grouped.
---
I remember my premade in 2005 would get queues every 5-10 min. This was back when you queued at the bg portal, too.
---
Crossrealm didn’t mean shit to me when it came out as my server had already been decimated by blizzard. I was on Arthas, we had a lot of video making pvpers and some of the best progressed pve guilds prior to naxx. Then naxx came, and it required so much more effort from guilds. Arthas was a launch server, our server tech was aging. Blizz opened free xfers to the shiny new MalGanis on new tech. Overnight more than half the alliance raiders and 1/3 of the horde transferred.
---
Arthas, known for world of roguecraft, maydie, roaming pvp night, Ioneye, pat and more was dead.
---
To add to the burn, iirc, MalGanis was in our battle group.
---
Depends on how many servers we get and how many they want to link up.. 2 or 3 paired is enough to not stop you from seeing local pvpers in BGs, tho I did use to grind gold/mats in between matches as the ques were long.
---
Was south park actually got me to buy it
---
You kept at it this long, so I know you’ll still read this.
---
No one is debating what the “deciding factor” is. Obviously Activision is making the game and they get to decide. Your original argument was that because Activision decided this way, therefore the rule is correct.
---
That is what’s wrong; and that is why you’re an idiot.
---
Yeah but that might not be possible code wise.
---
Is there a 5% discount for Friendly reputation with a faction, or is there just the 10% discount you got at Honored?
---
Well, unless they rework how mouseover (as well as focus) work for rogues, it will be pretty gamebreaking. Using modern mouseover and focus functionality, rogues will be able to CC secondary targets without losing their combo points on their primary target - which is in fact broken as shit.  
---
Buuuut lets hope blizzard are aware of this and got it fixed already.
---
Hey when you’re wrong, you’re wrong.
---
That's mainly why it happens on classic too tho. Because in classic, while leveling, other peoples buff are actually worth something, sometimes boosting your overall performance by a noticable amount. So you throw one out in hope to get one too.
---
It probably won't. It worked because the servers only "knew" items that they had already seen after coming online, i.e. this week since reset. They would see the items if someone with them logged on, or if a boss was generated that would drop it. People used this to farm for Black Temple IDs with Warglaives in TBC, but the system was changed later on somehow, nowadays servers just "know" all items by default. Considering that Classic will be Legion in disguise, I'd say it's fairly unlikely this will work.
---
Uh, every proposition = rape?  Give it a rest kid
---
Yes this is correct
---
I think that restricting certain factions on imbalanced servers to maintain close to 50-50 splits is a better solution than cross-realm BGs.  Tbh I don't really see why the argument for cross-realm BGs couldn't just be used to add dungeon finder.  (Of course dungeon finder wasn't in vanilla, but neither were cross-realm BGs for the majority of it.)  Both just try to cut wait times at the cost of immersion.  I'd rather they find a better way to deal with queues than making battlegroups.
---
Totally this. Direct interactions and what's actually said in broader channel differs quite alot in terms of the quality, humanity and decency.
---
Actually, it is
---
Besides the 10% discount you get with a faction for being Honored+ with them, is there also a 5% discount for being Friendly?
---
As a Scandinavian I take offense with the notion that it ever went out of style to begin with
---
Oh glad to hear that. I played classic as well, but it was so one ago I forgot. In retail buffs are unnoticeable for the most part when in the world.
---
I guess you can manage it, but why ?
---
After 10 years in the same company I still have a hard time to keep track of colleagues names, so imagine 2 different guilds :D
---
I don’t remember it, but did it do similar to https://www.classicwowtools.live/?
---
We probably could have that. But an MMO requires a huge playerbase and locking out 90% of players due to high hardware requirements is bad for widespread adoption.
---
Someone is too young to understand points and proper credit card management.
---
Either that or obviously too superior with some god given credit that is just magically approved for a house / car.
---
Quite same here. I know i can be quite indecisive sometimes and as i dont want to waste time on a character i wont like in the end on retail classic, i decided to level every class to 20-30 and draw a conclusion afterwards
---
It takes a MINIMUM of 12 weeks to get Rank 14 assuming you were number 1 in CP for 3 months straight.
---
I think this will only impact the 1% playerbase of super hardcore min-maxers and everyone else will just play what they want.
---
and got so far...
---
Skinning will be at 300 by the time you are level 35-36. 
---
Best thing to do is to get a pair of gloves and ask a guild enchanter to stick +5 skinning on it. Grind away during quests. 
---
The barrens, STV, arathi, Feralas, Tanaris &amp; ungoro are all amazing for skinning.
---
Based on random forum posts and that someone mentioned seeing him on a kodo I believe he was Tauren.
---
3 letter name definitely made researching him that much harder
---
You all look friendly, there look to be enough alcohol for everybody, I'd play with you !
---
I’m not saying that at all. I’m not saying people who play private servers are a plague or are generally bad or anything. What I am saying is that the *circumstances* Private servers are in from those points and others are negatives to the community. 
---
The whole racist scum bag point is that those people *wont* be playing Classic, or if they do, they’ll have to keep their mouth shut. As far as the whole diffusing thing, I think the poster was talking about hardcore elite raiding guilds on popular servers. The poster was worried about Classic being full of private server veterans that know the game by heart, and all I’m saying is that there will be a diffusion of those elite veterans.
---
I picked Tauren because of the Tauren with the 2H totem swinging on said bear.
---
At least you're was in the game. :(
---
People seemed fairly pleasant on dalaran-wow. Compared to retail at least.
---
Twice on Sunday ! :o
---
That's understandable, and again that's just my general experience. I'm usually online at non primetime hours so maybe that's it. I agree with the meme culture being dumb. I'm 33 now so I've grown past it, but kids are kids. I was one once. Truly tho, the only time I've seen anything racist was when people would get ganked or griefed. Is it the right reaction? Nah, certainly not, but they're just mad lashing out. I've put roughly 15 days game time on a server that rhymes with snail. And again this has its just been my general experience. Everyone's is different. I do hope that we all can have a good classic experience, and good luck in Azeroth.
---
 I first heard about wow from the southpark episode. Had to try it... Well and 13 years later still killing boars in elwynn.
---
That trailer sold me on making a hunter...But I switched to a rogue 😂
---
Something you should add to expose weakness is that is stacked. Having multiple hunters with expose weakness meant you could have 2, 3, 4 or more stacks of the debuff on the target at once. This meant ridiculous gains of RAP for all hunters in the party, but the 16 debuff cap meant this wasn't a very effective strategy except on some private servers where there was no cap.
---
Ideally you want to leave telderassil around level 11, once you complete all quests and do average amount of grinding, do bear quest and exploration exp doing the wetlands run should put you about 12, then you are good to go. Druid trainer in SW.
---
I wouldn't even bother going out of your way for aquatic for now, do it when you have 30% run speed from talents in cat form, it's better to traverse long distances when you can move faster.
---
We're still looking for interested folks, we have about 20 of our 40 members so far roughly, and are accepting all specs (that means you Ret Paladins and Boomkins!) All we ask for is maturity - no specific age requirements (other than meeting ESRB of course)
---
I have the same experience. I played on pservers that were below the usual player numbers of individual realms and were regional (german). The majority of people were very nice and the staff was absolutely professional. I was a GM there for a couple of months and every single gm command or server query I initiated was protocolled, available to most players and could only be altered by the admins. Which werent active players anymore.
---
You wouldn't happen to have a list or know where one is would you?
---
if you play a class you dont want to play because it has a better than normal belt available, you will regret your decision
---
That’s a hard question to answer since difficulty in raids in retail and vanilla/Classic WoW are fundamentally different for the most part.
---
As raid groups shrunk in size in retail WoW, Blizzard shifted the difficulty in raids from logistics and group management to a more mechanically complex approach that is overall more demanding on the individual.     
---
That can make it seem like raids in vanilla were rather boring and easy, but there’s more to difficulty than just complex mechanics.
---
In vanilla most of the difficulty comes from getting 40 man to work properly together. Knowledge of encounters will already make it quite a bit easier to progress through content, but even today you can find more than enough guilds (on private servers) that struggle with BWL and anything beyond.
---
Without a raid leader that knows how to manage a raid well you will most likely hit a road-block with anything after MC even if the individuals in the raid-group are familiar with the mechanics of an encounter.
---
The debuff limit is a good example of that difficulty through management.
---
A rogue using Deadly Poison and bleed-effects would be able to deal more DPS than one using Instant Poison and Eviscerate, but since Deadly Poisons and bleed effects take away debuff slots, it’s not advised to use them, because overall the raid would lose potential DPS.
---
Warlocks can only use one curse per target, and that usually means that Curse of Shadows or Curse of Elements is the way to go. Anything beyond that will block a valuable debuff-slot.
---
The difference between a raid group that is aware of which debuffs are overall beneficial to the raid and one that just spams whatever debuff there is, can be enormous.
---
That isn’t to say that vanilla didn’t have any kind of challenge when it comes to mechanics. Getting 40 people to stand in a manner that doesn’t link the Eye Beam from C’thun for example isn’t that easy and takes quite a bit of practise.
---
Having said all that; 
---
I think LFR is still easier than anything vanilla raiding has to offer.     
---
Personally I’d rank the normal mode in retail to be somewhat comparable with MC, ZG and AQ20.     
---
BWL and the first half of AQ40 with Heroic.     
---
Anything beyond that I can’t really comment on – as I haven’t dabbled in Mythic raiding in retail.
---
I quit retail pretty much for good after the first few months of Cata and the only “recent” raiding experience in retail that I’ve had was Emerald Nightmare in the first 2 weeks of Legion.
---
Warlegend is one of the top 2 French guild, with Millenium.
---
They said they would roll Alliance on Classic. 
---
Their recruiting post, as usual, ooze elitism (but at least in their case, they don't pretend).
---
I have seen less intimidating job openings for the French Foreign Legion :D
---
Mage is in a good spot at all content really. Drops off a bit towards the very end but that's it. Melee having good gear affects mages less than any other class if anything, as your mission should be to not get hit by them in the first place.
---
It fully depends on the picture you use, I think it's free use though. Either way the bank will just not approve it when you try and apply for it.
---
Reckoning will still be viable, just the normal way, i.e. heal yourself and party members while taking hits (hopefully from a pet), then when someone is half dead, you can help burst them down.
---
Leveling and gearing IS content, world pvp is content, random questing is content. Raiding isn’t the only content in classic.
---
I love healing and was set on it, but do hate the lack of damage that other specs provide. I would definetly try a pserver to test out!
---
That was epic! Let's see an elder scrolls one next
---
If you're coming from a private server, I think you'll be surprised how difficult it is. There will be less good pre raid gear and the bosses will be probably have more armor, better resistances, and hit harder as they did in vanilla compared to how they do on private servers. 
---
That being said, you could argue all PvE content in both vanilla and retail is trivial aside from mythic progression and C'thun and Naxx in Vanilla, so I guess it's just your attitude toward it or how good you are
---
Judging by his guild name, he probably wasn't alone to figure things out. I'd wager it was a guild effort for planning the routes and pooling gold for the mount.
---
The old school speedrunners were not big on quests they'd rather grind so gold for the mount might not have been a problem at all.
---
I have a piece of paper beside me that I have started writing down the things blizzard has stripped away over the years as I play retail. 
---
It is getting quite long. I would sacrifice all of the thins I like that have been added to have everything on that list back in the game.
---
everyone? it was shown when you launched the game..
---
Where can I buy this! This looks like fun!
---
I said "imagine", not "actualize"!
---
It's probably the reason I like dwarves so much and might do a dwarf Hunter with a brown Elwynn bear.
---
&gt;Level 9 - 12dps - Easy  (Horde Only Silverpine Quest)
---
You need to kill lvl 14-15 mobs, this is not a lvl 9 quest !
---
Evil. I like it.
---
 Claw and Bite only when convenient (near hub, on questline). Usually every second level. I don’t train dash or prowl.
---
Well, on Reddit you had watchpeopledie for that.
---
Would you share that with us? Curious to see it
---
Yes theres going to be alot of humans. But also mind that dwarves share theirs with gnomes
---
I I don't disagree with you I just wish you weren't such an asshat about it.
---
I think by asking this question in a pc hardware related you would fare better. That being said you can always compile your own PC for a relatively cheap price if you just plan to play wow.
---
Indeed, any group with a warrior tank is going to be extra likely to kick you because tanks don't like loot competition.
---
Nope
---
The levels listed are the levels it is possible to acquire at.
---
Priest questions in a paladin thread I suppose
---
Probably wrong thread man. With that said, go on YouTube and look up reviews for some affordable options. I feel like you should be able to get a rig for ~$800 that can chew through classic.  Look up “gaming computers” as well on google and always look up reviews!!
---
Oh fair point
---
Agreed MoP was a fantastic expansion
---
I hear conflicting takes on this so I'll just ask generally: how easy is it to get a spot in a raid as a tank (obv warrior) in vanilla? I've played a variety of chars over the course of WoW but it wasnt till late TBC that I started tanking. Ive never had trouble finding spots in raids as a tank during like every expansion but while people simultaneously say that tanks are always the most needed, others say it's the hardest to find a spot in a raid as a tank. Just wondering how it worked then, and how you expect it to work in classic
---
You'll still get the server identity through pvp. We wont get BGs until like 6-9 months in, maybe longer. So you'll have that much time to establish yourself in world pvp. Sure it will suck a little bit but I dont think it will be such a big deal. Also as long as they keep battle groups and not just 1 bg queue I think it'll be okay. Say like 3-5 servers in each group or something.
---
Building your own is the way to go.
---
It's relatively easy, way cheaper and more fun (maybe with some help from a friend?).
---
You would save a lot of money and be able to run it at max settings for quite some time.
---
If you get a laptop with a 4GB graphics card, you will probably be able to play classic wow on any resolution. 
---
I understand modern wow is cpu heavy, so go with a i5 at least. 
---
Dell and HP and even toshiba are all good. Microsoft and apple are good but pricey.
---
&gt;  subscriber count fell
---
Subscriber count never fell during vanilla, absolutely the opposite of that
---
In the past I also thought about playing my pala as a tank. The more I read and thought about it, the more I came to the conclusion that for personal satisfaction of tanking and being a valuable member of my raid I will go 20/31/0 to farm dungeons as a tank/ healer in preparation of raiding. This also works for solo prot farming. 
---
When my guild starts to raid mc and ony I'm respeccing to 30/21/0 to be more viable at healing effectively, bringing that SDR blessing to the raid and still tank the occasional dungeon.
---
For me it's the compromise that makes the most sense.
---
I'll probably start raid tanking for fun when I'm heavily outgearing the raid.
---
You're going to be a mismatched loser for 98% of the game anyways. Golden shoulders, red shoes, green robe, black hat. Once bwl rolls around as a warlock (typically weren't a lot of warlocks since mage and warrior have always been work horses, rogues too but less so when they nerfed sword spec but I don't remember when that was nerfed, could be tbc.) 
---
However.. it doesn't matter to me what race I pick. I just don't want to be a gnome.
---
jea thank you so mutch, i didnt know that site !
---
Not really played Cata, but from what I've seen, Azshara was hit pretty bad. Azshara was lorewise a very important zone, yet Blizzard built that Rocketway thing on it. It's like building a theme park on Pompeii; you just don't do it out of respect.
---
Which one of you sang about Jenny?
---
If you’re going to buy pre-built, I’d suggest trying to buy second hand. I’m selling my current build to switch to a laptop for classic as I’m going to need portability. I’d link you to the eBay listing, but I’m not sure if this is the proper place to do so. The starting bid is $700, and the components cost me $1600  in all. If you’re interested, feel free to message me.
---
me want wow, no change wow
---
Selling Sapper Charges for gold.
---
Teldrassil- Darkshore- Loch Modan - Duskwood - Redridge - Ashenvale - Stonetalon - Ashenvale - Duskwood 👍
---
in my opinion it is more popular, in classic at least. just about every server i’ve been on whether it was actual classic or not, way more people were always in IF than Stormwind.
---
If it's for retail, sure whatever I don't care. Do what you want with that game.
---
If it's for classic, I would rather have no extra cosmetics at all. What I would be "oka"y with though:
---
Blizzcon rewards: Murloc Egg, like in 2005.
---
Collector's edition pets: In the shop, but limited supply. Like if they sold 20.000 collector's editions back then, sell max. 20.000 pets so they have a similiar value compared to vanilla.
---
Trading card game items: Since the TCG isn't distributed any longer, I would be okay with making them accessible through Hearthstone. Maybe a 0,1% chance to get a code from a pack or something.
---
There weren't many items anyway, I think 2 tabards and a turtle mount or something?
---
BIG BOOTY
---
[Primary profession exclusive benefits - complete list](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bep2sl/primary_profession_exclusive_benefits_complete/)
---
Even regardless of pservers many of us can remember these aspects of vanilla just fine. 
---
Also we've been told repeatedly about them by players who don't like Classic for the last decade.
---
Depends on the private server. If you're coming from Nost, the Classic pre-raid gear will be far superior to what's available at Nost launch due to Nost's progressive itemization.
---
Passionate? Lol ok calm down dude.
---
You can also do priest only raids. Some maniacs did onyxia with 40 priests: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAmXZPuS7L0
---
If i had tried it in Vanilla it would have taken me 5-10 minutes to download the cinematic probably lol
---
Global channel is pretty shit tho. It's filled with edgy players who think they're on 4chan.
---
Sure you’re right, I guess what I meant was that when LFG was developed, it was around the time that subscriber count was falling. It was a solution to a problem, the problem being subs falling
---
It will be in classic! It’s the closest to blackrock and molten core. Right in the center of the continent.
---
I wish I had more upvotes for this post. People comparing vanilla raid difficulty to later expansions are missing the real difference. 40 man vs 25man and vanilla's smaller quantity of catch-up gear. Vanilla raiding difficulty comes down to logistical difficulty.
---
Shush. He answered your question. Stop nitpicking unnecessarily.
---
But imagine if we did actualize!
---
How do you feel the matchup spread is for pallys in world pvp while leveling? I remember getting dumped on by pallys when I was leveling my first char as a mage way back in the day but that's the extent of my knowledge surrounding vanilla pallys in world pvp
---
With proper GvG queues and single realm BG, they would end up waiting a long time and lose out.
---
I actually like the $15 barrier to entry. The free to play crowd tends to be a lot worse imo.
---
Idd it is 😊
---
Because they were new
---
But in the end it doesn't even matter
---
XDdddddddd ebin u sure OWNED him xdddddd
---
What are going to be the graphics of Wow Classic?
---
Like are they going to have improved shadows and view distance, but keep old textures. I tried googling it but it’s surprisingly hard to narrow that down. Or my head cold is making me dumb, one or the other lol.
---
Clumsy to navigate? Ironforge is like the easiest city to navigate in the game
---
nope only works when youre honored. if you also have rank 3 in pvp you get another 10% off
---
It will be the most popular. If only because it’s the closest city to Menethil Harbor.
---
They say that, but for part of vanilla if your name started with a certain letter you wouldn't even get on mob agro tables.
---
I agree with you conceptually -- it's better for the experience if you play what you like, not what you think you *should* play.
---
Having said that, there definitely are scenarios in which there's a right and wrong answer, mathematically, and when someone asks for answers surrounding those scenarios it isn't very helpful to tell them to just do whatever.
---
You mean the gauntlet
---
Yep, I cannot even understand it, do they realize that you don't need to respec to tank? You will gain your DPS gear 1000x faster if you tank and just don't invite other melee/physical dps. Lol.
---
Dwarf Hunter main since 2004 (alliance side). I'm still annoyed they nerfed the rifle sound. :/
---
Although i played a Belf Paladin horde side since TBC primarily.
---
Loved Classic,disliked BC at the time, but kind of like it in hindsight, hated WotLK and Cata.
---
I felt they made a lot of bad changes in BC, but it was still a good game. When they announced WotLK i was really worried, everything they did wrong with BC they were expanding on and everything left of WoW that was good they were gutting and I ended up 100% right on it. When Cata was announced I was actually excited, they announced a lot of REALLY good changes in a lot of aspects. However, they completely botched it in every way possible. It was clear to me at that point that retail was a lost cause. I have no faith in Blizzard to make a good WoW xpac at this point. So i played a buggy poorly scripted pserver a few months later and never went back. It was a much, much better experience than Cata.
---
I couldnt actually say whether modern retail is good or bad, havent really played it. But I can say i have no faith in Blizzard to continue developping modern WoW into a quality game.
---
On the dale, yes.
---
Ser sgu godt ud gutter !
---
You can thank Matt Ward 2.0 for that. The RP community quite literally died over the course of 3 months, it was depressing. Entire guilds, an entire community which was completely different to how it is now in almost every respect just vanished over the course of 3 months. I could go and on, it really pissed me off to see them do that to Warcraft.
---
Looks like a great group of mates. Jealous of your party size, haha.
---
Azshara was the one zone I never visited in Vanilla. It'll be a brand new experience from an old game that I'm really looking forward to.
---
I'm almost certain the world first 60 was a hunter.
---
Not a shaman. and it took them 10 days.
---
Something about your info is wrong.
---
They affect me a lot, probably more than they should.
---
And I'm actually in the same boat as you. I like Orc a lot, their casting animations are really good, but I can't stand them wearing robes in vanilla.
---
That's why I'm going Undead if I go Warlock. I will be looking at that character for DAYS, literally. No racial ability can make up for that, and it's not like Undead are a bad choice anyway.
---
Shaman is a no-brainer, the Male Troll's posture looks even BETTER to me in Vanilla and the casting animations are amazing (Hadouken / Kamehameha...please!).
---
1. Even if frostbite did affect bosses the frost nova effect would break instantly from the other 30 people hitting the boss. It is useless in raids.  
---
2. There is only a short window of gearing where you have enough spellpower to make downranking somewhat efficient, but poor enough mana/regen to make it worth it. In other words, except in the very start only max ranks were used.  
---
3. Depends on how much damage your spells deal in raids. For frost it is simple. If you frostbolt hits for 1000dmg in a raid setting (buffs and debuffs included), 1% crit is worth 10 damage, which with frostbolt coefficient is about 12 spelldamage. For fire it is much more complicated and depending on amount of mages in raid and how much crit you all have, 1% crit can be worth anywhere between 10 and 40 spelldamage.  
---
4. Higher range is amazing for pretty much everything. I think the only build where 1 point of arctic reach is skipped is arcane/frost  
---
5. The reason they weren't fire for the entirety of vanilla was because MC and BWL have a lot of fire resist or immune mobs. Fire is superior for damage if there is no resistance.
---
What a post. Thank you very much, tons of great information here.
---
Isn't there a shout ability that has a reasonably short cooldown that actually generates threat on all nearby mobs? I was watching a video recently, was it actually battle shout? I don't remember now.
---
Pretty much what you said, water and some particle effects look a bit different and such things but the textures and models are the same. You can check out videos of the Blizzcon demo.
---
Ditto. 1k was one of my favorite zones and it was so chill to level during nights. Losing it hurt a lot, although I think the cata version was pretty fun too when I leveled an alt.
---
1. Frostbite does not affect raid bosses. When you're doing raid content, tanks are often moving mobs to a specific location, and Frostbite can accidentally snare mobs, which gets in the way of that. The frost raid spec has one mage, usually the mage with the lowest gear, speccing for Winter's Chill to debuff the boss while the rest are arcane / frost. You can go fire when you're in AQ40 and Naxx.
---
Winter's Chill - (Your choice of Ice Barrier or Presence of Mind)
---

---
Fire
---
http://classicdb.ch/?talent#of0E00MZxgM0fcht0h
---
2. Always use the max rank of Frostbolt. The damage is worth it. The exceptions would be if you only care about the slow effect and not damage, in which case you would use rank 1 for the lower cast time. The same principle applies to Blizzard, but it's used much less frequently. You have lots of options of mana regen between your four mana gems, mana potions, evocation, mage armor, etc. You can also use gear like Robes of the Archmage and Celestial Orb for mana regen.
---
3. Stat priorities generally aren't as much of an issue, because most of the time the gear available creates an upgrade path much clearer than anything theoretical. At low gear levels, it's somewhere in the ballpark of Hit =&gt;= Crit &gt;=&gt; ~15 spell damage &gt; any amount of Int &gt; Stam / Spirit / Mp5 &gt; Agility, etc. ~57 Int = 1% Crit.
---
4. As I'm sure you know, Arctic Reach is useful for PvP, but it is also useful for PvE. For many dungeon and raid encounters, you need to outrange or line of sight a debuff or enemy spell, and being able to attack them from a 36 yard range while avoiding their 30 yard range spell.
---
5. Pretty much just damage. Fire causes more threat than frost, so it takes a guild that's more coordinated / better able to manage threat, which you're more likely to have if you've proven that you can clear BWL.
---
Lemme know if you have any more questions or want any more specific information.
---
Give orc female another look. The hair looks bad from the front, but from an above/behind angle they’re fine. The model and animations really grew on me in a big way.
---
Thanks for the tips
---
Need a budget but these two are the best deals I found with a quick glance on Newegg.
---
This one will actually play most games at near max settings at 1080p: [https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?item=N82E16883102696](https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?item=N82E16883102696)
---
This one is a lot cheaper and will still play a lot of games really well, not as future proof: [https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16883102698](https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16883102698)
---
Both will obviously have no issue playing Classic WoW at max.
---
Thanks!
---
It's literally a circle. It doesn't get any easier than that
---
I'm sorry, but saying Blizzard is intentionally sabotaging their own servers because RP-PvP are historically balanced therefore they're not allowing these servers to exist would compromise their secret plan to make Classic WoW fail is a stupid theory. You do not deserve even the slightest amount of respect or intelligence for making that point without any proof or explanation - just like the other guy in the other thread, you're coming across as being/thinking the small RP-PvP community is *so much* better than everyone else that they're deserving of their own safe haven lacking *any* toxicity and bad behavior. 
---
Everyone is telling you that RP-PvPers don't have enough players to justify giving them even one single server on EU with some arguments (number of announced guilds, historical data from RP servers, Blizzard outright fucking saying it etc.) and I've asked you to put forward any argument that would support the claim otherwise - instead you come up with this bullshit conspiracy theory like RP-PvPers are so much better than the rest of the servers and that's why Blizzard hates them, and then cry about how toxic I am for not agreeing with your demands based on that reasoning. Talk about being delusional. 
---
I am not harrassing anyone, I'm demanding they show some arguments as to why they think they're entitled to a server. By the interest and numbers I am seeing you are no more entitled to a server than me and 2-3 other guilds who can get a couple of hundred signatures and make threads on /r/classicwow every week are, from a numerical standpoint to say the least. This isn't about my opinion of RP-PvP, I'm simply trying to explain how things look like outside your bubble. All this rubbish about "we just want a home" is sentimental and childish and has no real value in any debate. You want a home, show us that your server isn't going to end up with just 2-3 active guilds after 3 months time and you have it - piss on your vision, feelings, opinions or mine for that matter. 
---
I don't want any connections with the RP-PvP community just as I have no interest to have any connections with the RP community, the "let's add changes" community, the hardcore raiders' community, the casual dads community and so forth - but if any of them wanted their own servers and Blizzard said no I'd probably say the same thing.I'm fine with Blizzard going either way, but just because you and a few hundred people want something doesn't mean they should give it to you.
---
What I ultimately want is for all of you to get it across your skull why this is happening: it's not a conspiracy theory, it's not people being mean to you because of the things you do in Goldshire, it's because you don't have the numbers. If you can prove otherwise, I'll be more than happy to agree with you but the way it's showing, you're all talk and no show and myself (and many others) aren't going to support this on the feels and blabber talk of a few hundred people because we have different opinions on what makes a good healthy server and what's better for the longevity of the game.
---
This is all overstated to the max.
---
Savage Gladiator chain got +13str +14agi and -20defense.  Either way it was a good item, and best in slot still.
---
BRE is another 'wah' item.  It was originally -300 armor for 60s.  If you think 'ignoring 700 for 10s' is so much better, I got news for you.  You can easily go 10s without even hitting a player in pvp as a warrior.
---
maybe I'm just slow but I can tell you that the "S" word is "Sharding".
---
Congrats on having one of the four tables known to mankind capable of playing the base game and expansion simultaneously on one surface.
---
Ohhhh ok yeah it was probably lvl 39 then cause i remember that helm being part of the war twink set with a enchantment? Idk ng its been a while since i played haha before they nerfed twinks and made heirlo9m gear but yeah lvl 19 twinks where my fav i tried so mnay hours to get that fishing hat haha and feet of the lynx both where damn near impossible i had a 19 rouge twink and i had almost all the gear
---
Everybody? It played the first time you started the game.
---
I think Shadow of War is &gt; TBC, but it's only cards, gear, equipment, etc.
---
The only thing that we know for certain is that there will be a setting that recreates the graphics to what they looked like in vanilla.
---
Beyond that we can only assume that, since the demo and the beta client both have the option to improve the graphics, Classic will have improved graphics too on release.
---
A thing to note though: Neither the beta client nor the demo have a setting to increase the viewing distance.
---
Definitely true. Maybe like 10% of the time there’s an interesting or funny conversation but yeah, 90% of the time it’s an unsupervised class of 500 6th graders.
---
Nothing against OP but, that kind of thread is very weird. I can understand the &lt;1% super burnt out players who only want to play for the numbers, but you won't have much answers asking that kind of questions. Normal people play a class because reasons. Not because of number and itemization.
---
People have spent the past 15 years trying to figure this stuff out on pservers.
---
Other than ferals abusing pummeler mace from gnomer, the meme specs will still be memes
---
Hahaha what the fuck
---
Did this for the latest fresh pserver launch and it was great. Really fun way to blow off steam for 30 mins, just log into STV or redridge (at a fair level, ideally)
---
If I should lose my job and my wife (for some reason) I'm going to do this all day long.
---
To be fair I think that’s sort of the point. The Bilgewater goblins are meant to be industrialist assholes with no concern for anything but money.
---
The current rifle sounds in retail sound so bad. I really hope it's the old bang in vanilla
---
&gt; Cata is a Gnome looking for a toilet. Stopped leveling any more toons after that.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?quest=4449 It's not like there's been similar quests even in vanilla so I guess you won't be playing in classic?
---
Here’s my advice. I’ve leveled 5 Tauren Warriors to 60, once in vanilla and 4 on private server. When you’re doing 5 man’s and gearing up, get the best Fury set you can. Go in to raids ready to do the best DPS you can, but tell your class leader and the officers that you want to tank. Unless you’re starting your own guild, you’re likely not going to be the MT, but you could be 2nd or 3rd.
---
This is a bit reductive.
---
It changed in a lot of ways. A lot of people don’t like how it changed.
---
Will macros work like they did in vanilla, or will they work like retail?
---
i want to play now ffs !!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Undercity is also a circle. People hate that one.
---
Can you give me an example of one so I can test it on my server?  I was unable to find an example of one on my own.  I remember using them all through TBC but I wasn't much of a macroer before then.
---
It's my favorite city haha
---
People seem to forget a lot of stuff when 15 years pass by.
---
None of the engineering items require a specific proficiency to *use*, only to *craft*.
---
Gnomish items are almost all multiple use, while goblin items are mostly consumable. In later years it has become commonplace for engineers to level gnomish first, craft all of the items, abandon engineering and re-level as goblin the second time around in order to access all of the crafts.
---
Retail
---
Hey I’m team circle all the way if/uc.  But there are a lot that disagree with us
---
A laptop with an ssd, i5 or i7, 4gb onboard video, and 8gb ram will do the trick
---
Got it, thanks.
---
The incentive to go goblin is to be able to craft your own sapper charges.
---
No &gt;:(
---
1. Frostbite affects very few raid mobs, as well as Frost Nova, so it and Shatter are considered wasted talents for raids.
---
2. Max rank Frostbolt except a few scenarios where you want low ranks dor faster cast speed. Usually max rank Blizzard too for raids, you pretty much want to kill anything youre slowing, down ranking Blizz is really more for large scale PvP and farming.
---
3. Ive mained mage for a little while, but dont really remember the numbers fof stats like that. I think 1 crit is worth about 15 SP if I remember right.
---
4. Im pretty sure you could outrange Magmadars fear with Arctic Reach and theres a few other situations like that. Getting in range faster xan sometimes mean you get some more DPS in too.
---
5.Fire is just a lot better for straight DPS, theres just a lot of fire resist bosses in MC and BWL. Imp Blizz is honestly also really helpful, especially for new guilds.
---
It's funny, I leveled a couple of characters to 20 (which is the cap if you don't have a sub) just to see a few of the starting zones and such, as I realised I haven't leveled a Pandaren (among others). I'm fine with a jokey quest here and there, but when you get to Redridge Mountains and half the zone is about following a "totally-not-Rambo" on a shitty "hilarious" quest line which, of course,  ends with you driving a tank with a machine gun that automatically kills everything close to you, my eyes just start to glaze over.
---
Then I played through Blood Elf and Draenei starting zones, and while they were by no means perfect/flawless (shitty drop rates, some weird pacing, etc), I realised I preferred them - or their style - a lot more. Then I realised, oh yeah... they weren't changed in Cataclysm, they're still from TBC-era design philosophy.
---
I don't think that liking something just because "everything was better in the past" is a valid reason, plenty of things have improved, but the fact that I didn't realise it at first is what caught me off guard
---
Do all factions have a 10% discount on their gold prices for wares and services when you are Honored+ with them, or is that just the 8 player race factions?
---
NoChanges doesn't interfere with optional graphical updates.
---
Battlegroups and cross-realm BGs are not the same thing though. As long as battle groups are composed of max 3-4 servers, we'll be fine. I remember very well recognizing people from the other faction in WSG.
---
And yeah, 1h+ queues are not fun when your favorite thing to do is PvP.
---
With friends you will have scenarios where it is possible to not wait for doing a dungeon, and as a tank/healer it might be instant as well in Pug. Given how unpredictable BGs queues are, it's not really comparable imo.
---
The opposite actually, the addition of the dungeon finder broke the back of the dungeon scene by introducing a method of entering dungeons that didn’t require you to be accountable to your party members. It also introduced people who had previously never joined a dungeon run because it was too hard to dungeon content. These players generally never had any reason to learn how to play their class well and were generally unwilling to learn as up to this point they’d been playing the game as a single player rpg with an unusually robust chat feature. There were hundreds maybe thousands of these players most of us who had always been in and played with guilds never knew existed but suddenly there we were in a dungeon with them because it was more efficient to queue and take your chance that to wait for a guild group to get together.  
---
Dungeons were the protective barrier that forced people to learn to play their class and role before they could advance. With dungeon finder being introduced players who had never been able to make the cut for their servers dungeon group suddenly were in these instances and getting mangled. So Blizzard decreased the difficulty of dungeons and then they slowly made them easier and easier as time went on. 
---
Dungeon finder eroded the guild community and created the PUG structure that so many players live in now, where item level and dps meters are king. Raid difficulty was then split in to tiers diluting that community and making it so if you want to do anything beyond the basic tier you’re going to be going back over the same content 4 times, for gear, titanforge and achievements. 
---
Retail has completely  ruined the sense of accomplishment and destroyed the progressive journey that use to make the WoW expansions prior to Wrath great. Even though Wrath had some of the most fantastic content of any of the expansions you can really see the cracks start to show as corporate interests took over the design process.
---
Not anymore we don't.
---
I quit after max level a few toons in WotLK. game changed so much. Almost none for the better.
---
The current most popular one a constant stream of bullshit in general channels. Barrens is, per usual, awful in private servers.
---
The best video game known to man mashed with the best TV show? Count me the fuck in! I was about to fap to normal pr0n but I guess this'll do just fine ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡ °)
---
Wow, Org looks like shit
---
This is awesome
---
So the whole misconception again about vanilla, that all of us were too dumb back then to figure those things out? You know people actually used math and min-maxed the shit out of classic wow. There won‘t be any suprises in regard of playstyles or raid strategies except blizzards decides to use new rulesets.
---
Of the 5 level 60 Warriors I’ve played, they’ve all been OT. But, one time I was the third tank and didn’t have a suitable Fury set. I felt bad, because I’m my eyes I was holding back the guild. That week I went out and got 95% BiS Fury set (But I had to use a 2hander because I only had Rend’s off hand). Do yourself a favor and get a Fury set to start.
---
I think they said it’s like a hybrid of both
---
I’ve been happily married for 20 years.  Tell me more about what I should look for in a partner.
---
As an old man stuck in my ways could I possibly roll anything other than an undead? I could probably rock a dwarf and see a whole side of WoW I've never experienced. Although at first I'd feel like a traitor being on the same side as gnomes. Ok lets play! Wait...its not out yet. Shit.
---
Tracked time played for games too.
---
When ZG comes out, assuming you have decent pre raid gear, will ZG or MC be easier to clear at that time?
---
Hi, guy who wants to answer question here
---
Having raided on a DPS warrior, you definitely feel pressured to involve yourself with tanking - keep a set, tank dungeons, OT in short-handed 20 mans, no rolling on warrior tier gear in DPS specc, blah blah. It can be a pain if you really don’t want to tank.
---
If you really want to just be comfortable as an mDPS whore, go rogue. Not only can you roll on tier gear but you can use it. You can roll on all gear that’s usable for you.
---
Which laptop are you going to buy?
---
The whole honor system is shit as it is. The grind should have nothing to do with queue length and battlegroups or not.
---
No matter what, that grind is incredibly stupid and should be changed. But as you know, for now and for a long time after Classic is out, people are #nochanges.
---
Hopefully they will just revamp that system eventually. There is a middle ground between 0.1% jobless / nolife people having access to things and 100% of the playerbase having access to it.
---
Did you do the whole narration in one take? If so, that's impressive, but you don't need to tire yourself out too much right? Can always just edit in the sentences.
---
this looks like a shitton of fun, even with friends its so good
---
Some of the best OC i've seen on here in a long time. Shame they didn't do all the capitals, but still cool as shit.
---
Didn't you know that Vanilla WoW was the first MMO ever and it was only played 12 year old kids? /s
---
many of us are hanging out in discord to pass time until classic. feel free to come hang out.
---
Not my video so I dont know the answer to that.
---
I'd rather them not say shit and get banned when they do, I played on 3 different pservers, the most popular ones during their time and racism was common. Euros trashing Americans, Americans trashing euros, nastyness towards black people, general nastyness towards the Chinese and all the politics BS
---
You can bet your ass these people will either get banned eventually or get quiet real fast
---
I've never said to play what you like, but to test everything and not rely on theory, especially pserver theory.
---
I agree there are right and wrong answers but when you do your math you can't account for everything (lvl, gear, enemy lvl, buffs, player skill etc).
---
So you do the math you put it to the test and you keep what's good.
---
Look at ret paladins : the class has been theory crafted to oblivion, but more importantly tested in countless raids so yes I'm fine with saying it's not a viable raid DPS (not that I care, I play horde).
---
Show me the same kind of data for slam and then we have a definitive answer.
---
I have the opposite experience, if you play off meta in pservers you're gonna have a hard time unless you put a lot of hours into getting gear and consumes
---
Are you Danish? A flat I rented in Denmark has their alcohol set up like that too
---
If you're just going to copy/paste someone else's work, atleast put in the effort to format it so it doesn't look like a wall.
---
the madman actually did it all manually  ,  perspective corner pin for most of the 3d tracking. But i told him to try out mocha
---
i didn't say it will be easy. but the reward will be so, so sweet.
---
i will bring friends.
---
Eh. Players should be punish because Blizzard are dumb enough to not change that awful system? What?
---
FFS FORMATTING. Wall of text is horrible.
---
I think the best case scenario would be cross reason bg's on an as-needed basis. 
---
Two servers with faction imbalance? Pair them up.
---
That one server with 24/7 bg's and queues under 5min? Leave them alone!
---
I'll prob swing by tonight or tomorrow. I havn't played wow since TBC and I just started a worgen on retail. I don't remember it being this easy lol.
---
Hvad så whars!
---
So you stole someone else’s work and posted another Karma farm video on this sub? 
---
This sub is nothing but this spam lately
---
That's nuts! Well done for sure. Definitely tell him to try Mocha next time, he'll save some time and sanity! :)
---
Boom! Boooom! Kaboom!
---
Now
---
^^^^click ^^^^click ^^^^click
---
Yes we are located in copenhagen! 😊
---
Yeah and everyone backpaddled and clickcasted until BC where we finally started to use our 14 year old brains
---
Well, at launch, ironforge had the only alliance auction house
---
I mean, that's my point. American Diablo fans are their core audience. China Diablo fans are the new audience. That announcement was a slap in the face to their core and I'm not making excuses for that. Appealing to China is a good business decision on their part as long as they can find a way to do it without alienating their core fans.
---
I would not call myself a 'delusional fanboy'. The only Blizzard games that I ever purchased were Diablo 2 and WoW. As a business owner myself, I admire how they run their business.
---
I love this community so much.  I noticed a big spike of external traffic to this video and my first thought was "reddit?" 
---
Was not disappointed. /u/Napoleann is bae
---
I dont think silence puts target in combat.
---
It's really situational and not great. If u go goblin from the start sure, but lvling gnomish then goblin is totally useless.
---
Just beware that deep fury / prot will leave you without the tactical mastery talent so every time time you stance dance you lose ALL your rage (you keep up to 25 rage with talent).
---
I didn't play a warrior since Vanilla, but back in the day I was of the mind that any warrior build that don't include 5 points in tactical mastery wasn't viable for me.
---
I hated that gun sound so much, I went to Darn at 11 just to train bows and come back to EK
---
Me too lol. Ended up playing shitty offtank through mc :)
---
Is this stealing someone's work? He didn't post it here himself and I thought it would help give him exposure.
---
I played wow because I loved Pokémon and final fantasy games and wanted a new RPG that had level ups and customisation. Wow was what kept coming up in my searches. Oddly Diablo never did though. A few months later a guy at work was being made fun of for playing wow, I just said "I play it too". Made friends for life because of that game. In fact my only proper friends are from wow. Everyone else has fallen into being just some one I know or an acquaintance
---
not the cinematic.
---
when i first got internet access, i wanted to try these online rpg's.  i bought guild wars and WoW within a few weeks of eachother, and frankly preferred GW.  Wow sat there collecting dust for a long time.
---
why i got me into WoW was a video a saw on the old TechTV.  dozens of players  attacking some huge egyptian god looking thing.  all the spell effects and projectiles (obviously this was around the AQ opening).  at that point i decided, ineeded to be a part of this.
---
from there it all snowballed.  
---
and i want to point out, for the people that rolled a hunter because of the trailer, watch the 'God save us' FMV.  the point when the dwarf hunter shoots in time with the music...my god, it still gets me pumped.  
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdK0wcxQfFA  skip to 3:18 for the hunter.  and just the way the tauren muscles up when he swings that tree trunk at the bear....
---
God no.  I use audacity and do multiple takes of dialogue and then just cut out the stuff I want to save.  As of right now I lean towards editing out all the pauses and silences, just because of right now I don't have a proper studio so I don't want the viewer to hear the hissing and humming(I record in my garage, 15 feet away from the furnace.)  I think once I get my audio dialed in and properly soundproof my space my delivery will be much more natural.
---
You're doing great work man, keep up the awesome content!
---
Any update on this? Can i access it now?
---
What do you mean there is no Undercity?
---
Dude, based on how much you seem to like scrolls, go with the class that can benefits from the most from them.
---
Personally I don’t like slam mechanic and hamstring kiting. I think it’s a boring ability. Not sure if it’s good honestly. There are better viable options that are more fun in my opinion. You could try dual wielding. There are some great options towards 40 (SM quest and RFD quest). You can try arms, deep wounds is very satisfying. ESP if you get some nice agility gear.
---
PvP server - Hard no
---
PvE server - I guess, if you like Slam to begin with.
---
Dude, based on how much you seem to like scrolls, go with the class that benefits the most from them.
---
And actually playing on the big servers.
---
its a really good board game
---
I’m having Xotic add some custom options to an MSI GS65 stealth. Rtx 20 series GPU and a newer i8, along with some aftermarket thermal paste to the cpu and gpu.
---
I was so excited to play I didn't even know there were classes. Was a warrior asking all the hunters how they got their pet lool
---
Nah, TBC is best.
---
It was on the last one I played.
---
Its fine, just adds some cards.
---
GET THE RUNNERS
---
/r/nothingeverhappens
---
&gt;You earn enough gold to pay for multiple accounts so that means you know what you’re talking about and I don’t know shit?
---
Yes? You are claiming that multi boxing is not that good because you don't earn lots of money with it. I know that's possible and I do that, which of us is wrong - The guy claiming its not good at making money or the guy making good money claiming it is indeed good?
---
I remember that my brother and I created a Dwarf character just to see if we could find the same exact spot and look at Ironforge :D
---
I have 99 runecrafting on osrs.
---
Of course there are a lot of great people on private servers, just like there will be in any game on any server, but only on private servers will you find Devilsaur mafias etc that completely ruin the experience for others.
---
The highest lvl I reached with a shaman was 41 in Vanilla so take what I'm going to say with a grain of salt.
---
That being said, whatever your class in PVP you need the max STAM and armor you can reasonably get.
---
I don't see much STAM in your list and a few cloth pieces, I would personally stick to mail.
---
Try to calculate your final HPs and try to find the video of a lvl 52 rogues killing lvl 60 under geared people : they all have something like 3k HP, it's not enough to survive while being stunned.
---
My 2 cents ;-)
---
Same here. Love me some Undercity. I can't wait to see if somewhat busy again.
---
Awesome find! Love the artwork they used back in the day. The golden borders are sooo nostalgic haha
---
Brigam Girdle was beaten already by [Belt of Perseved Heads](https://itemization.info/item/20216) and if you argue that is another phase, then Brigam Girdle is beaten by Onslaught Girdle off Rag.  There are also several 40+ AP belts to chose from, which are like 70-80% as good.
---
The omni boots gained 9 int.  If you are whining about 9 fucking into, you need help.  
---
Skul's is a retard comparison because Savage Glad chest was +20 def.  
---
Deathbone was and still is outclassed by BRD Legs: https://itemization.info/item/11927  
---
The spellhit belt is like the only item that really changed the slot, though the scholo belt got Hit too.  These were in response to people using PVP items in these slots, which came in 1.7 earlier.  
---
If you think a 2.3 speed 2h sword is 'fine', I don't really know what to say.  It also does not invalidate AR...  One is a BoE easy to get profession item, and one is a low drop rate off the end boss of an endgame 5 man.
---
Thank you so much my friend!  For someone just starting out that means the world

My favorite Horde zone is Barrens. Hands down best leveling experience from 1-60. The quest lore is outstanding, you do really great circuits completing 7-10 quests at a time, and there’s a bunch of wandering rare animals that drop items to start quests.
---
Agreed for the most part. We could still hold out the slightest bit of hope for OP's theory considering no p servers have all of the right numbers. But it's a stretch to think it could make an entirely new spec "viable"
---
Get in early with a guild with the expectation that you want to tank.  Guilds usually have their go-to MT, OT that get geared up first.
---
It's not a punishment, is the "real classic experience".
---
If there's a system that can only practically reward players who break TOS or have the privilege of playing/streaming 16h a day, I'd rather it be as punishing as possible.
---
Don't like it? Fine, then join me and argue for a better system or don't try for R14
---
having massive raid logs that are all live log enabled vs not having them in 2004 is noth the same as calling someone stupid. yikes dude
---
this is something that cant be overlooked. many people were introduced to the fantasy genre with the LOTR movies.  there was a preponderance of characters with legolas, gimli, and aragorn derived names.
---
I’d say if you can get the jump on a Rogue, they’re squishiest than a Mage. But that’s pretty rare.
---
It makes me sad watching and remembering this and seeing what the game has become ..
---
What changes did you not like about BC?
---
Night elf hunter taming my first pet, the spotted nightsabre from telderassil, named him Rathalos, nearly cried when chose to change pets 20 levels later.
---
It’s like you only see what you want to see lol. You realize this thread is about classic right? The version of wow where only 1 person gets to loot each mob and gether each node? OBVIOUSLY multiboxing is good for gold making on retail. It is no where near as lucrative in classic. You have to pay for all those mounts and repairs but you ONLY gain extra kill speed in the open world. Did you not realize that? Holy cow you sure are one dense person.
---
Used to? What happened?
---
Creator of the video here, OP did nothing to claim ownership of the video.  I saw it posted and was actually flattered.  If posting a video in the classic subreddit is stealing, than 50% of this sub is thieves.   Relax bro.
---
I've known that was there since retail, I'm not missing anything about the post... Other than being disappointed in the click bait title
---
Realistically, how long does it take the average person to get geared for raids? Follow up question, how long would it take to get geared with full/mostly raid drops?
---
It was 100% a thing in Vanilla. I've never played private servers but definitely did it back in the day. As you zoned in a simple /tar Jed would let you know if he spawned or not. It worked because he spawned near the entrance, just one floor up. 
---
I don't see the point in changing it. It's not like it was always trivial to get a competent UBRS group together if you didn't have the key, and weren't a tank or healer yourself.
---
No...No it doesn't.
---
Sorry I'm late. Boom https://imgur.com/LMpxtJ6
---
Yeah this is awesome, been looking at it a lot getting my bearings again. 👍
---
Read up on how to get all the quests that involve Ragefire Chasm and Wailing Caverns.  Doing all of those involves going to all 3 major cities, but I think the XP and rewards are worth it.
---
Danes have a unique sense of interior design :)
---
Also, jealous of you and your mates!
---
I've made a bunch of posts on it, but basically Mana Tide Totem + the pre-requisite talent is worth about ~25 MP5. For comparison: Major Mana Potions are worth 75 MP5. Flask of Distilled Wisdom is ~55 MP5 on a 3 minute fight, or ~27 MP5 on a 6 minute fight. Oils, food, Mageblood Potions, etc add even more.
---
Most healers don't actually use max consumables because they don't need to, but for Shaman specifically it's more affordable to actually use them than respec every time you raid.
---
&gt;I was about to fap to normal pr0n but I guess this'll do just fine ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡ °)

---
DPS meters were a thing back then...
---
It's not that simple. BGs are easy to get and you can grind them no problem, it doesn't matter if you are solo player or a tryhard premade. Before BGs you have to farm kills outdoors which puts different groups in vastly different situations and you won't get anything done solo.

From my other comment in this thread. Figured I'd give it a top level post. https://imgur.com/LMpxtJ6

Yup, that’s what I’m going for. Laptop with i7, 1080 at least. Need to be mobile to play as I wrk away.....and also sitting on the sofa “socialising” with the wife! 😂👍

You are more than someone that just casually enjoys WoW if youre sitting in the classic wow subreddit months before the game is even out
---
I pay the neighbor kid $20. $40 for mow, edging, clipping hedges, weeding.

&gt;You don't need anything more than a Threat Weapon in order to increase threats twice than Warrior as Paladin , Consumes will do that job for you.

You cant possibly believe this?

Wow was one of the big things that pushed me into IT. Always wondered how it worked on the back end. Now i am the networking administrator for a data center.
---
This is so cool  Do you have a version without the level ranges?
---
I'm EU and i played the US beta, the Korean beta and the open Eu beta. So there certainly wasnt impossible to play before the launch... :)
---
I had a dwarf Hunter named gimlee 😂😭
---
when the US beta ended those of us who had a beta key could get access to the EU beta instead. I remember emailing blizzard about it and getting a key for the EU beta (which made no real sense honestly since the live game was released in the US, but it was something to tide us over until it released for us a couple of months later I guess)
---
MC and Ony will be cleared with everyone in mostly greens to start with. To get decked out in raid gear will take weeks/months unless you are being fed gear by your guild.
---
South Park for me.
---
I’m looking forward to classic, but gone are the days when everyone was ignorant and just playing for fun
---
You shouldn't regret it. I read one GMs stories saying the silly things often made their day brighter. I'm sure you unintentionally made their day
---
NE Hunter is the only logical alliance hunter choice.  FD+SM+Engineering is too strong and too unique of a combo.
---
It always resets from the beginning. CoA kind of sucks tbh.
---
I’m missing UC and Darnassus.  
---
Gj tho.
---
Old forum sites were just more fun. You would come to know a few dozen regulars. The conversations would be about pretty much anything.
---
Reddit, much like retail, killed that sense of community.
---
and they were just as advanced or comprehensive as they are now?
---
Both Darnassus and Undercity have been destroyed at the start of BFA, you're able to talk to a bronze dragon to go back in time to get em back but that's for gameplay purposes only, lore wise they're gone.
---
True I didn’t think about any of that. I just know they’re all about convenience now adays so thought they’d just weave it together

We 2 manned 25 man heigan on wotlk launch, and 2 tanked patchwerk.  Solohealed half of the bosses.
---
Certain bosses in ZG will be harder than certain bosses in MC and vice versa but overall ZG will be the easier raid. The fact that it’s a 20 man raid instead of a 40 man raid is already a huge factor in overall difficulty.
---
Were there a lot of spriests our there? Wasn’t it hard for them to get geared ?
---
*I can't wait to not be fully geared up within a month.
---
*I can't for a server being a community instead of this feeling of random people.
---
*I can't wait for raids to be 40man again.
---
*I can't wait to see someone with a sick weapon i know and it actually being that weapon theyre using.
---
That said vanilla wasnt perfect, my biggest struggle is probably knowing that later expansions actually had better class versions than vanilla, fx my Disc Priest is going to feel weird without Penance for one thing which i think made the spec really come to life.

Yup, started as hunter , got to level 53 then made a warrior and never look behind
---
If you download it, you get the full size image.
---
PSA: don‘t level as fury. You‘re gonna miss a LOT with your offhand and you‘re going to have a miserable time
---
Can we at least get some clarification on this from Blizz?
---
I can’t seem to recall this
---
Your TLR is as long as the thing it’s describing.
---
Yes, all factions have that reduction.
---
I haven't polished my crystal ball in a while and it does not really make sense to do it just for this question.
---
If some more similar questions come up I can give it a shot.
---
this was my biggest take-away when logging into WoW recently (realizing you don't have to pay to login on a low lvl).  
---
Orgrimmar looks absolutely terrible in current WoW.   
---
I could see a polygon update on most buildings, but BfA didn't even have the same buildings!
---
imagine taking the effort to point out the most obvious thing ever, he got you good and that makes him based
---
If blizzard hasnt announced a release date yet, what makes you think anyone knows the answer to this question..
---
The ENTIRE zone of Uldum... that long ass Indiana Jones quest line with zhe people who talk like zhis. Jesus, that got soooo unfunny SO fast.
---
IF is closer to MC (thorium point fp), Ony, AQ, Naxx, Strat, Scholo, UBRS, DM, AV, AB...
---
I think SW is only closer to ZG and WSG. Not that helpful.
---
Sky is falling.
---
Looking back yea, the [21 Holy](https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#sVxuMx) was mostly to hit illumination.  And this was mostly for raid viability.  The 21 pt would be 1 of the optional ones in tier 3.
---
Consecration, or 1/2 in either Imp LoH or Unyielding Faith.  They are all useful in a variety of situations.  Consc is probably the least raid-used though.
---
I played a heavy (probably unhealthy) amount back in Classic and I don’t think people quite understand how similar it is to today’s game. Yeah, there’s stuff today that wasn’t in Classic, but the game itself was fundamentally the same. 
---
People who “played Classic” will probably be angry when the learn about Classic having things like catch-up mechanics that launch over time, just like today, because they don’t understand that it’s easy for us who played Classic to see those who claim things about how it was but obviously didn’t play it. 
---
I think a high majority of players that claim to have played Classic refer to private servers, none of which I tried have felt like they provided the proper Blizzard experience (not even Nostalrius).

That's so cool your 70 year old dad is playing. Im 22 but always wished my dad got into playing video games with me!! We play madden here and there still but man to play wow together would be awesome!
---
MoP still had alot of really clunky cheesy quests that took me out of the game. That jade princess quest and the hozen/forsaken romance story come to mind.

My raiding friend tells me each fury applies 1 sunder to a boss right at the beginning to maximize dps for the full 5-stack-sunder-debuff instantly instead of waiting for the MT to hit onyxia or whoever 5 times with sunders and generate enough rage. 
---
This wasn’t done when I raided back in BC, but he’s been doing pserver vanilla endgame so they might have new or different strats.
---
You're probably just excited, but think about what you're asking.  
---
No one announces a date on which they will announce the release date.  They just get to a point where they can drop a deadline on their staff, and then they announce the date.
---
Also you're not going to miss it.  News will be everywhere inside of half an hour of the release.
---
What the Hell? I've seen 40 man druid raids which make perfect sense.. but priests?! I guess you have a ton of heals and bubbles
---
As far as i can understand it is from a stream + reddit. I do realize the people that are here on reddit are more hardcore than the average. 
---
How would you get a sample size less random than this?
---
I’ve noticed that some people take the fantasy aspect of the game very seriously and do anything silly or goofy is met with a lot of hate. For example, gnomes, pandas, cata old world quests, even trolls. Personally I like gnomes a lot but I like the horde and it’s zones even more so I’ll be playing an orc
---
I first tried wow when my dad got his account. I was like 8 or 9 years old and I really loved playing runescape. My dad described wow to me as “a more badass runescape” and I bit the hook. Now I’m nearly 21 and I’m still into wow. Ive played this game more than half my entire lifetime.
---
Yuuuup. I'm too clumsy to power level, and too much of a completionist to ignore "inefficient" quests. I'm expecting to take 2 or 3 months to get to sixty during which time I may or may not have collected enough gold for a mount :)
---
I think we decide to join Glamorama, you can message /u/Glamo-GM
---
I am in no hurry at all to get to 60. I'm looking forward to reliving the wow I loved and enjoying every zone and quest to its fullest.
---
How about you try walking face first into traffic, gotta test it, right? 
---
Slam is shit. Not using a weapon is also shit, but it will get you to 60 in the end, so by your definition it works, right?
---
Shitpost Sunday?
---
I suppose stealing wasn’t the right terminology, I apologize to you and OP.
---
I’m just irritated with the spam of these videos and the karma milking on this sub. But if I’m in the minority on that, I’ll be glad to keep my opinion to myself.
---
I love games that I can alt-tab out of very easily. I work from home, and have a decent amount of spare time, but its all in small segments. Like I have 10-20 mins where I can play, then I need to tab out out for 20 minutes. I love playing dota 2, but its hard to dedicate the time. 
---
Thats were mmos/classic is perfect for me. I can still play a ton, but kind of off and on.
---
Casual playing is going to be easier than it was in vanilla, there will be alot more pugs for example..
---
Pretty much the same, I think we will end up joining Glamorama.
---
You can message /u/Glamo-GM
---
Pilav is that you.
---
Classic's systems requirements will be laughably low I'm sure.  If you gotta pony up for a new rig, I'll be willing to bet it's not going to be much. Even retail WoW's requirements are on the low end, so I'd be willing to bet Classic's will be even lower.  You can find decent refurbished laptops on amazon with dedicated graphics for pretty cheap these days.  If you wanted to go desktop, I bet you could find a capable machine for even cheaper.  Best of luck to you!
---
It's for a different server than I was talking about, and not a very active one, but he is right.
---
What ended up happening with the card? Did they eventually dissolve it and you had to get another one, or did you get rid of it before the card became obsolete?
---
You can get pre-BIS in about a week excluding 3 or 4 items. A lot of your pre-BIS will be crafted gear that can be obtained pretty easily. There's a few items that take more time to farm, like Briarwood Reed for casters or Hand of Justice for melee, and a couple other 5 man drops. If your guild wants to start MC as soon as possible, you will probably start without some of these items.
---
I didn't knew it existed, made a female dwarf hunter and month later someone showed me the cinematic and I cried, because it was so beautiful.
---
Yes people die at age 25
---
you are going to level tailoring 3 times ?  you are going to need:  
---
240+ Linen Cloth  
---
160+ Wool Cloth  
---
570+ Silk Cloth  
---
300+ Mageweave Cloth  
---
660+ Runecloth  
---
Sound like you wont have much time for other activitys
---
You're not wrong, thought I may as well quote the whole thing for interest's sake.
---
No. The items have no impact on my choice.

[21/0/30] RaidHoly-PvPRet Hybrid
---
Options:  
---
T3 Holy: Cons - ImpLoH - Unyeilding  
---
All good options for PvP and PvE.  
---
T3/4 Ret: Eye for an Eye vs Vindication  
---
Depends if you struggle with melee or casters, also some theorized raid benefits from Vindication.  
---
Raid Viability:  You bring Improved Might, Sanctity Aura, and you could in theory keep up SoCr, but its probably not worth it.
---
Probably not going to enjoy your 4th point. One of the great parts of old school vanilla was that it was international. EUs, Chinese, people stationed in those countries, it was great.
---
Not just excited but a bit frustrated after waiting for this for 2 years. I'm not used to game releases like this. All the modern stuff these days get announced and released in the blink of an eye. It sucks not having any good games to take off the pressure with.
---
Your last point i feel is a completely valid way to play the game, real authenticity
---
&gt;  I just don't stand by the nazi style no changes police on the graphics front. If there's a toggle 
---
Anyone I don't like is a nazi! Isn't really much of an argument though is it? What's hard to understand about 'historical recreation' as it was, the fact this project is meant to be a muesum piece or what's more the opposition to taking away the players to ability to be percieved how they want to be? It's 'just optional' doesn't cut it when people no longer have control how they look in a MMORPG. People make comments on how my character looks in game all the time  regardless of what I play and vice-versa, so how you look matters. The fact that so many people don’t understand that and just say *“well you’re ruining the way I want to play the game”* as though you’re entitled to something extraneous to vanilla and it doesn’t matter is genuinely laughable.
---
No, subs continuously went up during WotLK (to the highest peak WoW ever had), which is when LFG (i.e., Dungeon Finder) was introduced. Subs dropped in Cataclysm and then further dropped in 5.0.3, which is when LFR was introduced as a feature. MoP was actually the first expansion to have a huge spike of people coming back, then leave, and Cata was the first expansion to not have an increase at all. You could argue they had saturated the market, everyone who wanted to play a game like WoW was already playing WoW, but Cata was clearly the start of the fall. Nothing to do with LFG, which existed for months at that point with no real issue.
---
Incredible resource. You're doing God's work
---
Can you still renew the card? Or did they eventually remove it and you had to switch to another card?
---
Today's sounds literally like with a silencer
---
&gt; Don't like it? Fine, then join me and argue for a better system or don't try for R14 
---
I think we agree here. I just was confused by the "I want people ruining their life because R14 blabla".
---
I live in Rochester. Now you got me curious to go check out the Strong museum to see WoW in the HoF

And Blizzard had built up a reasonably well made universe. It was a perfect alignment of timing, gameplay, and story
---
#MakeWoWGreatAgain
---
Pay a friend $20-40 to build it for you when you buy the parts. If they are experienced, it would only take them an hour tops.
---
I think they should try to create a system that leads to approximately 50:50 pop as well. I don’t know how it would work but people nowadays are knowledgeable and will choose the majority faction, leading to a bunch of 90:10 servers.
---
You say that, but there are two posts in this thread talking about it.
---
[And they have more upvotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bhkdwo/classy_friday_paladins_april_26_2019/elu1w8n/)

Honestly if you dont need a big screen the xps 13 is a great value
---
cant fcken wait
---
Damn y’all are all cute
---
That's not true. It's just not rushed. You are aware that classic will span over 2-3 years and not a couple of months.
---
There is time to take a break from classic for a month and come back.
---
Just a heads up skinning on a mage might not be optimal. The time you're spending skinning is time you aren't replenishing mana while drinking
---
Is this one of those “I was only pretending to be retarded” things?

If so, yeah, he totally got me by acting retarded, but I definitely also think he actually is.
---
You guys had a long time to lose your virginity. Come on guys, time is running out.
---
That's the quest for toilet paper. The guy in the toilet hut. And that's no what I mean, as this was actually quite funny. I cannot remember where it was because it was such an idiotic quest that I had to stop playing there. Maybe something in the New Azshara, idk. Congratz for finding this one, it doesn't change a bit that the quests went from epic to shit in Cataclysm.
---
I bought the game cause of a screen shot of a bunch of players underwater. Had no clue about the combat or anything just thought it was gonna be so cool to explore. Had never played an mmorpg the closest I got was Active Worlds and the screenshots made it look like Active Worlds on steroids.
---
Then I started in Teldrassil and thought Teldrassil was the only area night elves could go. Thought it was still pretty big. Little did I know just how big the world was gonna get. 
---
Then I thought it was so cool you could pick up items and money. I thought to myself how cool it would be if there was an in game trading post or way to sell your stuff to other players. And then I found out about the AH. I had no clue video game technology existed to do all of the shit WoW was doing it was blowing my mind
---
Literally everything I could think of the game had and more. 
---
Oh and I also thought it was so cool that flying out of telsrassil you actually flew to other zones in real time with bo loading screen
---
Some people think 1-40 sucks.  It's my favorite part of the game though.
---
Dungeon leveling is awesome and there are some amazing ones.
---
Contrary to everything you may read on this reddit, theres nothing you have to keep in mind except it's going to be slower paced and the game wont hand you anything on a silver platter.
---
Aside from that it's all discovery and community.  Have an awesome time!
---
I had to wait until I had enough money to pay for the game AND the hourly rate at the local LAN center
---
Well assuming at least *some* people continue creating characters for the underdog faction, it would open up again. So as long as you were persistent you would get the chance. I personally think this kind of system would be worth it to preserve server health in the long term.
---
I would assume because of Paladins? Not sure though
---
Are druids still going to have to macro form breaking on spell cast?
---
I really have trouble remembering that xpac in detail. I think the worst was that underwater zone. The beginning of the end of WoW.
---
Ah, before Azeroth was a (living) planet and was just a kingdom.
---
I always thought it sounded like the dildo launcher from Dead Rising 3
---
It was a feature that was implemented almost 2 years into the game (21 months from launch, and just under 5 months from tbc), and was pretty much a technical advancement they had made in order for the arena function in the 2.0 update to, well, work. We were just beta testing the Xrealm instancing for them, it never belonged in vanilla and it shouldn't make it into classic.  
---
    
---
As for the community aspect, what do you mean? Of course it changes how BGs are approached - not only does it change up how honor ranking works on a large scale, it was the beginning of the end when people started being able to let their inner asshole out by AFK honor botting because there were no social repercussions like there used to. You also never saw people from your own server again, people you had perhaps leveled up with and fought in every level bracket, the people you knew, who knew you. It's literally LFG but for BGs, but worse since BGs take 10-40 people making malicious behaviour harder to notice.
---
I could power level, but I've got two other friends that I am so excited to share classic with. We became inseparable during Legion when my roomie and I met our third. Now we're going to roll squad deep always, tank heal and dps. Try to challenge ourselves doing dungeons alone, make sure we level our professions, defend the meek, all the true vanilla experiences. We'll get to 60 and into raiding before a new tier releases, so other than epeen and trying to control the market early on there's no real reason to rush.
---
Absolutely.
---
What if they implemented a system to control faction balance? Would you be opposed to that?
---
Yup I'm basically planning on levelling real slow and enjoying the ride, level some professions, do some dungeons..
---
In the first area? Yeah, that's right. But there were better areas and I actually found that grind Island fun as well as SoO (at least for a while). It's funny that I cannot remember any names of that while I'm pretty certain I know every area of classic in a heartbeat. Although h I haven't played for years..
---
I look forward to hardcore casual.  Like, I still plan to randomly run around like an idiot.   
---
Like, take quest to get a nice weapon upgrade.
---
But in game be like.   Ok I'm ready let's go.   Oh, look they rock looks cool, I'm gonna go check it out first.
---
There is nothing to fix. 
---
Gameplay wouldn't be all that different if they had to tab to blind you and tab back.
---
yes, but one of the best ways to farm gold for a mage, DM North, has its gold per hour multiplied if you also skin the hyenas you farm in there
---
Agreed. Some sort of faction locking system to maintain balance is one of the only “changes” that I feel really confident about.
---
Yuuup. Was desperate to experience teldrasil after that
---
I’m also planning on 1-3 hours. Per week. Well maybe 5 when I can. 
---
I will be the biggest turtle to 60 😀
---
Triphelz covers one reason for that decision. What would you propose as an alternative?
---
Your plan is solid, and I plan to do the same thing as well. 
---
However I wouldn't recommend to re-level tailoring for the Bloodvine bonus. If you're a steady raider doing BWL weekly, you won't want to use 3 piece Bloodvine. ZG head enchant, CoC, Bracers of Arcane Accuracy, Nelth's Tear, hit ring, Ringo's, Bloodvine legs + enchant would put you at 9% hit. These are all pieces you will easily have come ZG release, Tear might take you a while though. 2-3 smart ZG clears with your guild should net you CoC and enchants.
---
The spell damage loss from using Bloodvine over the pieces above won't outweigh the 1% hit, but if you insist on being capped you can use the hit neck from Strat and still rock better stats than you would with 3 piece Bloodvine. 
---
Essentially level Tailoring for RotA, drop it and level engi x2 whilst maintaining Herbalism throughout the lifespan of Classic.
---
So if someone ran over and tagged a mob a split second before you were able to and got an Epic, that Epic could’ve been yours. Brutal.
---
It was the NE druid running then changing into a cat that got me more interested in rolling a druid.  I was doing research on the classes before playing and thought the druid would be fun.
---
Yup, I love leveling. Questing away dong stuff solo and exploring the new zones. I like getting like 10 quests in the log and going to complete them all before returning to hand them in and empty my bags all all vendor trash. 
---
Looking forward to end game too, but love getting there. Back in vanilla I raided and pvp’d with two characters (hunter and resto shammy), 
---
But I had a priest, warrior, Druid and rogue all level 60 too (but never played them again once they were 60). 😂👍
---
Vanilla had two? or three? from the trading card game. A turtle and something else? Sooooo there is a precedence for that.
---
Get ready to die.  A lot.  Your choices will make a much bigger difference in Vanilla.  Situations where you ask yourself "Should I?" lean very heavily towards "Bro you should totally fucking not."  It's much more mentality engaging in terms of gameplay, you're going to have to use the knowledge you've gained to overcome certain obstacles, you're not going to be able to just mindlessly faceroll through the content.  
---
While it may be "slower" than Retail, I find vanilla infinitely more fun, engaging, and satisfying.  You might feel the same way ;)
---
I mean, this is spanning a year of playtime so levelling those primary professions isn't a huge amount of time in the grand scheme of things.
---
What would you change? Keep Tailoring the whole time at 60 after I initially pick it up?
---
Haha! You deserve at least silver for that.
---
I started levelling a horde character using Joana's guide to speed through it, but around level 30 I was having so much fun I stopped following the guide and stopped caring about getting to 60 altogether. Can't wait to take my time in Classic :)
---
I loved vanilla; every minute of it. I have missed it ever since patch 2.0.1 dropped. I played TBC, I enjoyed WotLK but nothing since. I stuck with the game and played every expansion up until 7.1.0 slowly getting more and more disillusioned. I’ve not logged on since then. I despise retail. I can’t wait to go back to 2006!
---
He seemed to be having a good time with my silly request. I'm sure it's a nice break from angry tickets about lost items or somthing
---
Hi, /u/FaveHD
---
Jump a few time zones west just for good measure.
---
Is agility going to give Attack Power? I seem to remember it not doing that until a certain patch. Speaking from an Enh Shaman perspective, wondering if I will still want that juicy Str gear
---
More like an old peashooter.
---
I've looked at a lot of Alliance 2h Fury videos and many of them are Slam spec. I'm trying to understand how Slam is supposedly so good when you're losing autoattack damage because of the swing reset.
---
Even if you time your Slam perfectly after the swing, you're STILL losing out on 1.1sec white damage. And that's the best case scenario. Add lag and human error into the mix and you're probably looking at something like ~1.6sec lost autoattack damage for every Slam. 
---
And you are rooted, as a melee. What am I missing since many suggest Slam for Alliance 2h Fury?
---
Or maybe not the best.
---
TBH I think having the 1.12 talents from the start is gonna have much more impact than a couple items with different stats.
---
And personally, I'm looking forward to it since some specs will now be viable from the start whereas they wouldn't be if Blizzard did full progressive patches (like some Pservers). Can't wait to play me some Feral Druid! 
---
I only wish Blizzard would have done some changes to buff the really shitty specs, like Retribution Paladin, Enhancement Shaman, and Moonkin Druid. I think Classic would be more fun if those specs were viable.
---
&gt; Gameplay wouldn't be all that different if they had to tab to blind you and tab back.  
---
Uhm, yes it would? If they had to tab between targets, they would lose their combo points. If they use focus or mouseover they don't lose their current target.  
---
So all im saying is, hopefully Blizzard are aware of this and make sure that combo points are lost on your target once you cast anything on your focus target or mouseover-target.
---
&gt; Based on random forum posts and that someone mentioned seeing him on a kodo I believe he was a Tauren.
---
Actually yeah that makes sense.  It was a lot more time-consuming to get the rep that you needed to buy another faction's mount back in the day.  Cheers.
---
Playing casually, this will be me all the way.  I just want to level every class to 60 and have fun doing it, that is my goal.  I started in BC and soon after I had to have all the gear and be so strong.  Now i'm like "I just wanna level" lol.  I'm sure there will be a few of us around.  Everyone else will race to 60 and farm dungeons/raids/pvp/stream it all etc etc.
---
That's an amazing add, I appreciate the insight. I was basing that decision off of Infra's 1.13 BiS list for Stage 4. If BWL gear comes close to/surpasses Bloodvine with the set bonus, then I can save myself the trouble of getting Tailoring up a second time.
---
Getting a hunter pet for the first time
---
Vendor everything. Skin everything and vendor those. Always pick the weapon rewards over other items and vendor them. VENDOR VENDOR VENDOR. 
---
Did I mention vendoring everything? Pick the bones of your foes clean, then skin them.

I murder everything in front of me, pick up everything and sell it, I've never struggled for my 40 mount, at 60 I typically an end up with around 500-700g and then I'll just farm the rest at 60. There's probably more efficient ways but this is simple and easy.
---
I had every class except Pala at 60, started several Ally ones on a PvP server for a change, went to t9 with my Ally Warrior (race changed to Horde if you want me to link it, should be in the armory) and raided MC with the 2nd raid group on my server. I had a playtime of more than 200 days.
---
That's where I decided to stop raiding because I actually lost my job and gf to Wow.
---
I think I played enough WoW to judge it. Regardless whether I remember a toilet quest or not. Cheers.
---
1-40 doesn't suck, it's the best part.
---
Back in vanilla i was blue with all enchants. this cost time and Gold. the reason why i plan to make Gold while leveling. In classic this gives me a speed boost in midgame 
---
dont forget to make all prequests!
---
Being multilevel and harder to access is probably the main reason
---
Take skinning and cooking. 
---
Only train the skills you absolutely need.
---
Buy nothing except 6, 10 and 14 slot bags.
---
Grind on beasts. 
---
Vend everything.
---
I want to say the spectral tiger from the tcg, that might have been after vanilla though.
---
But how often did you see those mounts? I think I may have seen one of the Tigers at some point, saw a few turtles though, they didn't increase speed though?
---
/cast [@mouseover] spellname
---
Basically I want the nochanges crowd to suffer from their own rules as hard as possible
---
Soon^TM
---
Pushing r1. Sounds a Bit effortless
---
I don't main a warlock but it'd be nice if they could stack shards a bit better at least (and I remember hunters suffering the same fate with arrows). Not a huge change, not a different inventory - just a bigger stack.  
---
Speaking of which, they shouldn't have to ress their pets in BG in Classic (maybe that change did come late classic? or tbc, can't remember).
---
MoP was a great xpac but I never played it when it was love bc I was so turned off by the pandas. But it actually has the best post-wotlk questing, and the Monk class is the only class added by an expansion that actually worked imo.
---
It is their job to rein in their vile tendencies, not our job to turn our eyes away. Elementary history will teach you that.
---
There's a couple spelling errors I noticed.  But yeah it's a nice map.
---
I know there were atleast 3 or 4 turtles on my server. I recall a tiger but I couldn't tell you when it was from.
---
I watched it and thought to myself, "Someone's gotta do something about these goddamn dwarves.  They can't just be allowed to roam free.  They must be exterminated."  
---
Horde for life.
---
I was certain to play Horde but having just watched Lord of the Rings I now feel I have no option that to play Dwarf warrior!
---
I don't know of any big events until gamescom in late august. So my guess is online.
---
I'd completely forgotten about this one. That outro is a thing of beauty.
---
Most classes can just run away from a paladin, even mid fight, if they think they will lose. A paladin will rarely be able to secure a kill on a competent mage, warlock, rogue, druid, shaman, or hunter as they can easily escape by using CC or increasing their speed. Similarly the other classes can initiate long annoying chases by getting a little bit of distance, but they don't have the tools to outright get away.
---
Wait, are there people that are dumb enough to think that things getting upvoted means they are true?
---
They look so glorious ! Days were beautiful back then where there was no transmog. :)
---
Someone linked an interactive one a while ago, and I forgot to save it :(
---
Ahh, I can't wait. The other day I saw a hunter running around with Corpsemaker and the gnomer hat and it was just so perfect.
---
When were they added to sw and darn?
---
No, just that is shows a reasonable correlation for them believing it to be.
---
Really? I'll have to rewatch, I didn't remember them showing theramore.
---
Get out of here with your rational thought.
---
Contrary to what others are saying there are items that require proficiency just to use. I don't know all of them, but the World Enlarger is one (https://classicdb.ch/?item=18660) so it's probably worth checking all that you want to continue using.
---
Youre actually saying nothing.. all i read are weird comparisons and you thinking you are so smart that you are able to think for me and OP instead of just discussing normally. thanks for the effort.
---
SW is more helpful when you want world buffs. As you said, closer to ZG and that's where you turn in ony/nef heads.
---
thats a bummer to hear
---
I thought the Dwarf looked stupid but I was floored by how COOL the elf looked and how amazing the transformation was to the cat was. Also a huge fan of the Tauren bit and caused me to roll a Tauren Shaman as my first character. 
---
Going back to Classic, I have absolutely no plans to play Shaman or Druid because I loathe the Druid class (always have. The forms all look goofy.) and I don't like Vanilla iteration of Shaman.
---
As far as I remember, the first long cloak didn't come easily obtained via quest or crap green was late 20s, early 30s.
---
Oh stop.  OP asked if it was fun.
---
most of these are not OP at all in their final form
---
but just got what I would consider a buff that makes sense/makes them viable items.
---
With that said, I agree about a few of these being beefy af and pretty easy to acquire.
---
The fact that you all can't sense the sarcasm in this... "my great great great great great grand papi" Glad to see the wow community iq is still very low. lmfao

54, used to play druids, back when I started, will be starting another when classic returns.
---
I intend to take it very slowly though, I'm in no hurry to get to end game, if I ever get there at all.
---
Because the updated pvp blues were entirely new items, which were added in later patches, therefore should be added in a later phase
---
Im excited to No-Life-Casual this, just like back in the day.
---
Play for 5-30 hours a day, making alts, camping people who gank me, looking at unaffordable Auction House Porn, inefficiently grinding while I listen to Comedy Podcasts/Music.
---
That's majestic.
---
You can tell it's an old picture because no one has the patchy neck beard or soy boy mouth open, eyebrows raised "smile" and instead genuine smiles.
---
Throne of thunder and SoO were excellent I agree. But it would be so much more fun if the gameplay elements were backported to BC or Wrath. Only 1-2 difficulties, stats being less ilvl based, threat and mana regen, unique classes would make those raids timeless imo. Which, speaking of timeless, I feel like the community has kind of done a 180 on that isle. Personally I hated it and wouldn’t do it again, but compared to tanaan jungle or whatever mechanic Legion/BfA use, I’m sure timeless isle would be a godsend, and so looking back, people remember it better.
---
I do agree though that the zones were beautiful in MoP. I remember playing shammy on the beta so I could far sight around, and I could always get a few peeks at kunkai before it would boot me out. Kunkai, Krasarang,and the place north of it are excellent.
---
Dude stop spreading false information... They are shit tanks, saying that they can tank trash doesn't make them good. Feral dps... anyone who brings up druids having good dps as feral their whole argument is invalid.
---
This is exactly what I plan to do.
---
I love the Orc model and animations but their too bulky to wear cloth, it just looks silly.
---
I think Undead Locks look way better and WotF is still an amazing PvP tool.
---
Vash’jir... always hated it, so I’d do Hyjal instead. Except I also kind of hated Hyjal too, it felt like you would walk 5 feet and be at a new hub. Also, it was the first (and only) expansion that had flying off the get go instead of late into the xpac, so that kind of killed the explorative side of things.
---
And people will "believe" whatever they want to believe. Which is why I am asking for a source.
---
Spooky circle
---
I was waiting to play it ever since the first announcement.  Grew up on warcraft games.  Been playing since launch day.
---
Battle Shout gives some threat, and so does demo shout. Most videos are from private servers though, and so the exact threat may vary. On private servers, swapping targets around with sunder armor was still better than this, until you got to like 6+ mobs.
---
One nice thing battle shout threat is useful for is picking up pulls that the hunter did or whoever.
---
well china and NA will be soft locked, but all of europe will be free to pick any euro server.
---
I'm an EU player, and even though I was just 15 years old at the time I still played both the US Beta, Korean Beta and EU Open Beta before the game released in Europe. Plenty of opportunity to practice.
---
Home again.
---
Flask of Supreme power is 175 spell power and casters in FULL prebis have ~300 spell power at most. 
---
lmao you know nothing about vanilla
---
The reason I started playing WoW was I was a Blizzard and MMO fan and had been following the game for months prior to the launch. I was reading the forums and seeing what people involved in the alpha/beta were talking about, and I could see what people were playing the most regarding class-race combinations. People seemed to be neglecting trolls and priests, so that is why I rolled my first character as a troll priest, which I leveled to 60.
---
The journey is the destination.
---
And the demon hunter of 2004
---
2. Is excellent. I had an inkling if that idea but had 2 minutes before I had to go to work, and didn’t have a way to express that thought. I think the fresh craze is very real, but exacerbated by the fact that private servers have an air of impermanence to them. With something more concrete, hopefully we can go longer before we need a fresh server. Maybe something like 3 years of Classic, then open up fresh Classic and TBC, simultaneously, to control overpopulation of ether one.
---
Your 3rd point is something I tried to convey too. I love having noobs in the community. It makes things more exciting, especially when you’re running dungeons and can kind of help guide people through.
---
Fully expected Ironforge just to show the mountain not moving at all while watching.
---
It upsets me that they don't continuously update the original game world with each expansion and have the story and most of the gameplay taken place there.  One of my biggest turn offs with modern WoW is how the world has effectively shrunk to 5-6 zones because theres nothing in 90% of the world for players to do.
---
Why waste time building another random handful of islands when you could have put the story in already existing and underused zones that mean something 5o players. BFA has improved on this with things actually happening in meaningful zones instead of random backwaters but Legion was the absolute worst at.  The Burning Legion is invading the planet and they choose some nothing area to it in for no reason at all
---
I'm rolling a female dwarf paladin for the uncommon character model, a statistical anomoly only seen on special occasions.
---
Completely agree, how many ladder resets for vanilla progression does there need to be to move forward with the content, and some of the BC progression systems?
---
Run Tail/Herb &gt; Tail/Engi  
---
Keep 35+ alt with  Tailoring/Alchemy if you want to have that combo. Or you do Herb/Alch for raid consumes. Mooncloth is decent money, but i think you would make more money farming herbs and makeing pots that sells well, instead of haveing a proffesion you just use for a long CD.  
---
Make a lvl 5 for disenchant.
---
I’ve not played since 2012, and thought the same, maybe play on pserver.
---
But decided to just read up and watch vids on YouTube to plan my start. Don’t wanna burn out, so decided to just wait for classic to be released. 😀😀
---
Did changing herb tracking to mining tracking trigger the GCD?  
---
Is there a macro that change automatically between them every GCD?  
---
How would that affect my casting ? (Don’t allow me to cast spell) ?  
---
If not maybe I can bind them macro on a key easily spamable.
---
How this macro would look like on the modern macro system ? (It seem that classic macro would not work like in vanilla)
---
Blizzard had loot determined when the mob spawns. Private servers actually do it as the mob dies, which lead to some really terrible situations in which the server crash after a guild loot legendaries in raid, only to kill the boss again and get some regular epic items.
---
By having loot tied to the ID you make sure that in case anything goes wrong, a Blizzard GM can look up the loot table for that ID and restore any items that would have been lost in a crash.
---
Can someone please explain how stats work on a per level basis? I understand that each race has base stats for starting a character and then what class you decide upon gives bonuses to certain stats as well.
---
Now does each race/class combo have a certain stat gain per level. When i played vanilla WoW i recall every time i leveled it would say “congratulations! You’ve reached level #! You gain X Stamina. You gain X Agility. Etc etc etc.”
---
Is this a correct memory? Is there a chart for stat gain per level? Is that race or class based?
---
Think so? I’d disagree. Quite challenging. You’d have to have a 2700+ rating in 3s at the least. At least last season anyway. You pretty much have to know how to press all your buttons, when to press them, and know your opponents buttons and when they’re pressing theirs. I can’t think of anything more challenging than pvp in wow
---
Shoutout to all the casual players, you make the world feel alive!
---
Can tauren ride raptors?
---
I wouldn’t mind an international bunch of servers, honestly. But I am looking forward to having most of the people be able to speak with me. I would go out of my way sometimes to translate speak with people, and that was always fun, I’ll admit.
---
Thanks for making this, it's very helpful! However, I don't think the most items are hella powerful, some are, but most has just gotten buffed from useless to useful tbh.
---
Theres a lfr recruiting thread. There are scores of guilds looking for people so check it out and find two that fit.
---
Sweet. I have written him/her a message! Looking forward to play with you!
---
Classic models and classic animations will actually allow me to play a race I enjoy. Gave up on my troll druid in retail after they "enhanced" the animations. The only horde race I can stand with the "improved" models and animations are blood elves.
---
Actually hate pretty much all of the new animations and models, they move really weird in my opinion.
---
Fortunately we'll have the choice to play with the new or old models and animations, since classic is still based on current retail.
---
You can if you want. I leveled to 10 and stopped because it felt like a waste of time/ruined the nostalgia factor. The people playing on private servers all these years did them selves a disservice.
---
Watching vids is a great idea! :D
---
That's what makes Vanilla so good and -why- people want it back. Yeah sure, the endgame is great and that's a big aspect on why people want it back. But...The thing that Classic gives us that retail does not is the adventure. You can fuck around for multiple days without progressing an inch and still have a good time. I don't plan to rush to 60 in the slightest. Hell, I'm genuinely thinking about playing a mage and spending some time just making friends and giving people teleports for a couple days. Not looking to hit max or farm the best stuff. Just spending time talking to people in town and offering teleports. I mean, partly to meet people and build up that friends list, so it's not 100% without -reason- but yeah. I DO plan on hitting 60, but I wouldn't call myself hardcore in the slightest. One of my goals is to (eventually) have enough gold to become a helper to fresh low levels and offer decent bags and some starter items to new players/characters to help them on their way. I'll be spending gold on that before I spend gold on food and pots for raiding tbh
---
Awesome! Anybody have this in a 1920x1080? I am trying to set it as my desktop wallpaper but it's a little too tall :(
---
Ahh you‘re talking about retail here, sorry didn‘t notice. Because r1 in vanilla is like the first one to get (Grunt?), and that‘s just easy :)
---
Sounds very relevant for broke low level wannabe pally twinks. Because there are dozens of those.
---
One clan thinks strength and FIGHTING SPIRIT is important, the other doesn't. 
---
What kind of loser would choose Gelkis?
---
NO! Don’t do it, you’ve waited this long. You have to put work Into your toon, and even if it IS fun, it will make it less rewarding when you do it for real. 
---
If you haven’t started, don’t start imo. Let the magic capture you all at once when it releases. It’s great to have a toon that you start on day 1, put hours of work into, and then you’re 60 and have all these friends who were there with you on the way. 
---
Plus I’m still holding out for a July release. It’s more unlikely with every passing week, but it’s not off the table yet.
---
Oh. Yea. Lol. R14 (grand marshall) I guess would be the vanilla equivalent. Even then, I think getting r1 in retail would be more difficult than getting r14 in vanilla. I feel like getting grand marshall was more of a grind than it was you just being a master at your class. That’s my opinion anyway
---
yes
---
Estimating at work probably 2 months from 8-11, a month each for 12 and 13, 2 more months for 14. Give or take a month total based on my own error and where you finish every week (top 3 vs top 10)
---
No, once you are Rank 14 you are set for your character's life. Buy all the gear and go rack up the dishonorable kills because the pvp system has no rewards left for you to attain. You can continue to wear Grand Marshal gear as a Scout
---
I have plans to kill every raid boss, but I still enjoy playing casually. I may no-life one or two toons, and try to cap them within the first 2-3 months, but after that, I want to be a serial altoholic and just relax. Maybe I’ll have toons around every level, so I can always play with friends that want to do something on alts.
---
Retail models will not be available in Classic as far as I know.
---
Pretty sure some of the gear requires goblin or gnomish to wear
---
Tried retail pvp only a small Ankunft of time, but you can be right here. 
---
Only thing i noticed was my shammy had an extreme overpowered skill where you could stun the enemy for like 5 seconds and Hit for 10% of his max hp every second. that was a little too easy
---
Level 10- 21 dps?  You have to kill a level 27.  What is this treachery you speak of?
---
On one hand, it worked in Vanilla.
---
On the other hand, I wouldn’t mind it being fixed. Having people cycle through instance IDs for 10 minutes is not very immersive, and it makes finding a rare... well, not rare at all. Either make him a permanent boss or fix the bug imo.
---
Sick editing 10/10 would greed again
---
Really enjoyed this. Keep the vids coming!
---
I had a buddy that did this. his first like 5 characters were all warriors cause he didn't know how to change classes.
---
Chad would never! That insufferable virgin is going to ruin Classic!
---
PAGA SPENDI SBORSA INVESTI SPILLA ARRICCHISCI SPREMI!!!
---
No, save the excitement so you can unleash it to your full potential in Classic
---
It is indeed the best, I actually got this printed out as a poster it came out great, I was able to print it huge because it's very high resolution. I shall plan all my quests out on the map like Cartman in the South Park episode!
---
I played feral druid back in actual vanilla. Back then I was in school and had plenty of time to get the epic PvP set and the AQ mace (feral attack power).
---
I'm considering playing something like hunter or mage instead because they're easier to gear, despite how much I love druid. The PvP set and a FAP mace are mandatory for feral, and now that I have a job I don't think I can reasonably acquire those.
---
Making MC so much easier from the item perspective.
---
WOW MAN THIS IS SUPER COOOOOOOOOOOOOOL XDD
---
Even at RazorHill
---
That was in BC when Inquisition split into VV, MM and Tribute.
---
I was in Carebears throughout most of AQ and then Inquisition during Naxx. Provite, Dwarf Priest /salute
---
I still get shit from my friends for playing wow, although tongue in cheek, but no longer from classmates/colleagues. I think it's less to do with WoW getting more mainstream and more to do with people growing up.
---
As with any hype monster, the disparity of quality is at an all time high imo. Every day it seems like there’s a fresh high quality meme or two that gets a chuckle. And then there’s a huge basket of shitty ones. Either way, keep me coming :)
---
Thanks for the input! This list is a pve list, not PvP. The goal was to come up with pieces that resto shaman's should maybe  look out for as they run dungeons to allow them to fill it a DPS spot if they have to, with the most damage in mind. 
---
That being said,your PvP information is quite useful for some that wants to pvp and I hope they take it into account!
---
At least we get the racial armor soon!
---
i know a lot of people love questing to mee it just feels like a chkre i need to do before i can raid
---
You know what, your comment just 100% settled it for me. Thank you so much, you are absolutely right and I will wait for the release. I didn't realize the importance of the "waste" that could come out of it.
---
"Full potential is right" Thanks for your input, I'll wait for Classic :)
---
Cataclysm and the goblins FUBARed so many zones. Goblins screwed up Azshara, polluted Stonetalon, Thousand Needles flooded, the desert of Tanaris ended up with an inland bay (a bay. In a desert. Dafuq?). Barrens and Stranglethorn got cut in half.
---
The only zone that got improved was Desolace.
---
That's interesting to hear from the perspective of someone who actually tried my idea of playing on a private server! Thanks for sharing, I'll make sure to avoid the private servers!
---
Make Ironforge great again!
---
Classic uses retail macros
---
Rushing to 60 asap and then leveling skinning after the fact might be more efficient, since skinning is so easy to level and you could easily AOE large groups of mobs down to skin.
---
Just throwing this out there as stuff to consider
---
Isn't that where all the pirates are?
---
Really like the list. Gonna save it for release :)
---
This honestly sounds like an amazing way to play WoW. I've always viewed WoW as a kind of passive game. It doesn't require laser focus like FPS games do, and it doesn't require time restricted goal oriented gameplay like MOBAs. It's something I can just play while watching my TV shows or youtube videos. It's something I can do in between errands and chores. In Classic, it's almost impossible to play in a way that requires complete concentration for long stretches. Because just the simple act of traveling forces you to take mental breaks. That's why when I first played Classic as a teenager, I could play it for literally the whole day. But even in my youth I had trouble playing games like Starcraft for long stretches.
---
274/20999 Gelkis Clan all the way. It's the only way to play.
---
Hyial 😀
---
Elwynn-&gt;Westfall-&gt;Darkshore-&gt;Westfall-&gt;DM-&gt;Redridge-&gt;Duskwood
---
I'm not though. I never said it doesn't make sense to have progressive items -- I just said it's silly to expect Blizzard to go that far to faithfully recreate the experience since not only is it *a lot* of extra work, but they don't even have the data to do it in house.
---
All of their trailers were absolutely stunning.
---
I did this with my guild back in vanilla and helped a guildmate get this. This video made me laugh but if you never did this, yes it was a huge amount of work. This didn't even include constantly farming mats for the turn ins to open the gate when we weren't doing the other steps. And the silithus farming.... That was legit grinding! 
---
I have absolutely no interest in doing this again but this video did make me laugh and remember those times!
---
Back in vanilla my decision was to take a cool Looking Troll
---
Straight into ignore list to make sure I never let this guy into one of my groups. Might need that ignore list limit remover addon very fast...
---
How did they announce previous expansions release dates? Then it will likely be announced in that manner.
---
Good edit. Sad that you stole my gif.
---
This isn’t legion, good luck 3 manning dungeons lol.
---
I couldn't agree more with this.
---
The teleporters are locked behind gnomish or goblin.
---
You are pretty delusional if you think you will reach anything close to top 10% spamming one button. [This](https://i.imgur.com/AHUJrej.png) is a more realistic damage distribution if you are tryharding. In addition there's a huge gap between top players and the rest in terms of activity percent. Super common for people to have less than 80% time spent casting in combat.
---
I have literally provided you numbers previously and so have others you choose to ignore it and stop responding when that happens. You have done so time and time again.
---
You good sir are tarnishing the community as a whole because you can only see one thing you winning whatever you think your winning. The numbers present on RP-PvP (or rather the ones that exist on live in their current form) show suitable populations to quite easily support a server of each language on the EU and easily 1 or 2 or US.
---
Your using a reddit as a base for something rather than things in general. It is more likely that we would see guilds come over from Live which wouldn't be actively recruiting on a reddit because why would they - they have already made their communities.
---
Private Servers have never represented roleplay, so in general roleplay guilds are less in number and even less so RP-PvP guilds because of the toxic nature of people - like you. It's well known that during US hours the toxicity is generally worse than EU hours depending on servers.
---
Also the fact you seem to insinuate ERP shows how much of a completely confused person you are - any of the major sections of the RP Community has issues with how it is performed and done by individual's in a game where children can be exposed to it. Even worse you've said it to someone with my background of knowledge shows how much of an utter arse you are. Stop acting like an RP hating child - RP-PvP is arguably the way the game should always be played after all its a MMORPG - if you want to represent a living world you need PvP and you need RP which only comes from RP-PvP.
---
Dude, I am more than happy to help you heal the scars that have been caused to you by sections of the RP community, just admit you need help.
---
This is not a place for politics.
---
This is awesome, thanks for this. And to confirm, if an item was changed to something in say 1.8 it will be that way in our 1.12 release?
---
Item and talent data is readily available in numerous places. Hell, they could just get it from the Nost code, which they most likely have up and running already.
---
There's no excuse aside from "we want to make this as profitable as possible".
---
Honestly doesn't seem that bad to me because I'm used to the figures PoE racer put up. We just had a race to 100 where people had around 4 hours of breaks every day. https://i.imgur.com/PmcwHRC.png :^)
---
Thanks! Definitely gonna save this :D
---
Downvoted just for the picture.
---
Teldrassil -&gt; Darkshore &lt;3 -&gt; Duskwood would be my favourite zones :)
---
What? I mean poor paladins who can’t get AR. Not twinks lol it’s too high lvl
---
I really miss standing around in the Ironforge square, nobody flying around, no other hub taking everyone instead.
---
Gonna be good standing there on my Dwarf.
---
I roll shadow priest, worst T1 set but the class fascinated me.
---
I'm gonna be in between hardcore and casual. Not quite hardcore since I work and go to school, but definitely not playing at a casual pace. I feel like many people playing in at least my age group will do the same.
---
&gt;The people playing on private servers all these years did them selves a disservice.
---
I wasnt aware the last five years of having very enjoyable experiences on private servers and meeting a lot of great people I keep in regular contact with was doing myself a disservice, but thanks for the info I guess.
---
You lose combo points on target when you start generating combo points on a new target, iirc.
---
Not when switching target. 
---
Either way, it's not necessary, and I don't even play rogue.
---
What probably is necessary though is taking blind off of prep haha
---
It’s amazing. Big fan
---
Music from my generation in a game made by mine generation for mine generation. They were only able to ruine the game impossible do better.
---
Ain't like it hadn't been done before back in Vanilla. Did it a couple times in Nostalrius.
---
Yup. Dwarf hunter also.
---
Ironic shit posting is still shit posting. If you act retarded you just might be.
---
Dude... the left is Damage per second and the right is Healing per Second.
---
The dps was measured over less than 10 seconds for most of those. Thats not accurate AT ALL.
---
Go look at some videos from tipsout comparing dps of classes in mc, bwl, and naxx. then go watch the spelladin dps video on Templar Drakova youtube channel.
---
Ah. I thought that was OPs OC
---
Your dope gif was definitely the inspiration, but I'd call my edit transformative enough not to be stealing.
---
I didnt even think of it that way! Seems so much worse now!
---
Awesome!
---
Go ahead and roll something you're curious about but don't really want to main. Hell, roll the faction you're leaning away from. I have two classic characters planned out and I'm steering away from anything that will diminish those experiences, but I had a lot of fun leveling on a private server.
---
I'll forgive you, if you tell me what program you used to edit the gif.
---
I found watching vids just made me want it more, adding to my thirst lol, so instead I’ve settled playing the retail WoW trial version, just to get used to the area again, movement, etc.
---
I know it’s not the same, and won’t be as enhanced, but it has helped me a little...for now.
---
Appreciate the insight, that's exactly what I'm looking for. This would be my first Vanilla Mage so I am not aware of all the BiS alternatives to profession gear. I'll look into the Robe of Volatile Power now that you mention it.
---
And just for clarification, assuming I did choose to go for the Robe of the Archmage instead of Robe of Volatile Power, are you suggesting I roll with Tailoring over Skinning while leveling and as a fresh 60?
---
Yeah, I was planning on a level 5 Enchanting alt as well, but forgot to mention it.
---
And as far as the 35 alt goes, I chose Tailoring since the playstyle of crafting and auctioning is very similar to Alchemy and wouldn't take much extra time in relation to the amount of additonal gold it could net. The CD was just an afterthought. The way you worded your reply makes it sound like you would do something other than Tailoring/Alchemy. What combo would you go with on a 35 alt, if any?
---
Adobe Premiere my dude!
---
You mean the people who are the literal reason you are getting to play classic servers?
---
He actually made really good time even by today's standards.
---
Thats a great point, actually.
---
In the FAQ section

**- "Will there be alcohol in World of Warcraft?"**

---
Make azeroth great again you idiot
---
Ok and now you get to do the same thing you've been doing for years one more time. We both know its a better experience the first time around, don't get salty.
---
1. You're a beta
---
2. Make azeroth great again
---
I just can't wait for the army of Xiao players who don't speak english to evaporate.
---
Dont forget about the thicc tauren! Or was that on the wow sub?
---
I played to 33 on a p server and it just makes me more excited for classic. I now feel more prepared. I would have spent a lot of time relearning things if I started on classic.... which is just fine for the vast majority of us. 
---
It’s an individual decision.
---
Still a great video :)
---
Nothing really comes to mind besides BRE. It's the only item I can think of that got buffed enormously in late vanilla. The "meta" will most likely be about the same as on private servers. There won't be some class that has a surprising new facet in Classic just because of progressive itemization.
---
If PvP gear does turn out to start with 1.12 stats, high-end players might pick their class based on what benefits most from PvP gear and what's most desired in premades. If we get the final version of the R13 sets, and you can rank up early on, that's a gigantic advantage all the way until the end of BWL. That's a small percentage of players, though.
---
Just because you were mindlessly addicted and couldn't wait for the real thing. Doesn't mean anything lmao.
---
big yikes
---
Lots of great suggestions here. Biggest takeaway, enjoy it all. Read the quests, enjoy the story. As you move to a new area, don't rush. Sometimes you quest in an area for what seems forever, you get to know all the npc's, so much so you notice when a guard is gone and wonder what the hell is going on. You'll see a companion pet and be googling where it drops, if you're too low level you'll look forward to grinding for it later. You will finally get a dungeon group and wipe, wipe, and wipe. Then someone will notice the pat that was around a corner pull a second mob. You'll pull 3 mobs by accident, kite and kill and feel proud you made it out alive with 3hp. Help out a random player questing, might make a real friend. Get a new weapon and go kill every rat in the tram station to level it up. Stumble upon a rare elite and see if you can kill it, enjoy the loot if you do. Keep that lower stat cloak because it looks better than your fighting one, you have to be spiffy in the city. Get bummed when you spend more on food and water than the quest paid out. The struggles are the journey, the journey is the end game. The achievements along the way are the reward. That huge crit on a random mob that you want to tell someone about, having someone to tell, that's the experience. Be your character, that made all the difference later on. I was never as geared as others it seemed, I always felt behind. But I knew my character, I knew his crit frequency, his damage intake. I always pulled 1 extra mob when solo questing, I pushed his limits, and in later levels, I held my own against random attempts to gank me, in bg's, in dungeons. When 2v2 came along, I'd have ppl lol at my gear, but with a healer and knowing my warrior, I lol'd as they died. Be your character, live his/her life in game, that is what you will remember. That's why us vanilla players have such nostalgia. We dedicated ourselves to our main, we were our main, and it made a real impact on us all.
---
There probably is, but you don't need it. The difference in stats between any 2 races is going to be tiny. Everything else about it is more significant.
---
Very Nice, I'll try to obtain skills like you!
---
“If you don’t live like I do you did yourself a disservice” arrogant, pompous, fucker
---
The thread isn't political and the picture isn't so bad. The only way this gets political is if people start arguing over the picture and not the sentiment of the title.
---
Because they're mushroom sniffing quarterling shit stains.
---
Vendor the heroes best friend. Dont be shy to grind mobs. then you have the gold you need.
---
LOLL. That comment triggered alot of the nerd's who couldn't wait for real classic, kinda funny.
---
It should have said some, not most. Sorry for the typo.
---
I love this map. I have a laminated version for my wall.
---
I don't think it's quite 1.12 though, no Ratchet fp, for example.
---
I saw elemental I automatically assumed PVP \^\^
---
For PVE the opposite apply : you could dip much more in cloth gear if the items are better.
---
Can't know your limits without these experiences though. I recommend the opposite, pull an extra, learn your skills and the different ways they can help you. If you die, try again, change the tactic, tweak the rotation, adapt, overcome. Learning should not be a negative, it's part of the journey that is the life of your character.
---
As of the latest blue-post yes.
---
Good video! Loved the broad overview between the lore, landscape, questing, and community of the zone. Barrens feels like an obvious choice for the first of the series, what’s number two? The only zones I can think of that have remotely as much to say about is Hillsbrad, Tanaris, Searing Gorge (including Blackrock), and maybe Tirisfal. 
---
One thing about the Barrens that makes it so unique, as you mentioned, is that virtually every horde member would go there at some point, many times. Every race from 10-25, and then revisiting it at 30 and 37 for RFK and RFD. It makes me a little sad since I’m rolling Alliance. Even on the demo in November, it felt awkward having the choice of Barrens and Westfall. Westfall is kind of cool and nostalgic too, but it’s just so much more lamer than Barrens. But i guess Alliance gets more 10-20 variety, with 3 choices instead of 2.
---
Well, if you go more **PVP** heavy, id say get  Engi/Herb.    
---
If you focus on more **PVE**, get Tail/Herb. You want to do both you can get Tail/Engi.  
---
( Herb is good on main-char, because he will have epic mount)  
---
As alt, i usually end up haveing a lvl 60 alt anyway, i like to level instead of afk in towns. And i always try to have Alchemy/Herb combo on main+alt, just to make stuff a bit cheaper for Endgame.   
---
As to 2nd Proff on alt, its always depending on what i do, and what alt i play
---
I’m sorry, I just really didn’t want to get involved.
---
&gt; My mistake, it should say some instead of most. Thank you for pointing this out. :)
---
LFR was introduced in 4.3 dragon soul. but I agree with all your other points
---
Makes sense, thanks.
---
I’m all for playing with other cultures on private servers. But goddamn the xiao thing is such a meme. It also kind of defeats the purpose of an mmo, having a huge chunk of a culture name themselves with the same word. That’s like going into Classic and just seeing 30% of people have the word gold in their name. Xstabxgold, goldkiara, afkgold, asmongold, oh wait.
---
Yep turns out the 0.1% freak social media parades around are not the norm
---
It's a shame really that no class other than those with stealth could pull this off successfully, I believe. In the end they'd just be run down (meaning 20 mins after setting up each day).
---
I considered not taking any primary professions except Enchanting while leveling to save time.
---
I still need to test and see how it flows having Skinning versus skipping it. But I believe it partially comes down to whether skinning mobs passively will be worth the time and risk of possibly setting me significantly back in terms of leveling speed and where I am in relation to the pack.
---
I have also strongly considered no Herbalism since zones might be far too congested for it to be worth trying to train.
---
I don't think I'll have a problem getting enough gold for my rare mount, even without professions tbh.
---
This is something I'm probably going to play by ear at launch to adapt accordingly.
---
I totally agree that even though MoP was a good xpac there's no way no it's better than TBC or Wrath. Timeless Isle was a lot like Isle of Quel'Danas imo and I liked both of them.
---
I honestly think a majority on this reddt say that they want to go full-retard hardcore mode when the game hits, but will play very casually after a few days.
---
Stat gain per level is based on class. Race only affects base stats. I've searched for tables of stats at each level for each class before and haven't been able to find any.
---
Feels
---
I’m glad to have helped. If I could uninstall all my private server memories and experience from my brain, I would in a heartbeat. It’s been fun, for sure... but the best part about playing it was leveling my gnome mage up in dun morogh, struggling to kill some things, and just being *in awe* at how much fun I was having playing WoW, like I hadn’t had in a fucking decade. 
---
It’s just so much better to let that first experience be what helps carry your toon to 60, with all of that awe you felt being a part of that same toon you’ll keep forever.
---
Yeah, there are no flightpaths to silithus either.
---
Wod got alot of people who played during vanilla and bc to come back.  And alot of my friends came back for molten core.    Once we found out molten core was a 1 and done.  With only 1 item dropping from it. Alot of people quit feeling they were mislead by the marketing trying to sell the game as if it were going back to its roots.     Having no flying In wod for awhile was also a part of this.

6 months to 60 easy!  Honestly couldnt care less about endgame.  Probably going to level several toons at the same time as well...which will make it take even longer.
---
Self sufficiency demands that you level all professions so you don't have to rely on anyone else.  So it's going to be a long ride for me!
---
I met a friend around level 29 of my 1st character. He later far outpaced me and was in the best raiding guilds on multiple servers, he was very elite. We still spoke periodically years after I quit, until his death last year. He was the best player with any class I have ever met. He kept to the mindset that was vanilla and would hop on a max character anytime I asked and help out. The people made the journey real, the friends became friends offline. I'm skeptical it's repeatable for new players, but I'm hopeful. I will more than likely start a guild in classic named after one of his favorite chars. With any luck, us vanilla players will be able to influence the world of classic enough that it will capture a bit of what was.
---
If you play competitively, apart from hunter, I don't see any class that doesn't need several sets : one for raid, one for surviving the Blackrock Mountain shenanigans and other non consensual wpvp encounters, one for BGs, one for farming / fishing etc
---
And btw any space left will be taken by consumables ! \^\^
---
Frankly you have much bigger concern than bag space as a warrior !
---
I'm looking forward to the pve realms and the fact that there will be more of them unlike private servers where it feels like all these people mashed into one or two servers, way overpopulated imo.
---

Makes sense. I'd be using the alt purely for the professions, bank space, and proximity to an auction house. Log on it a couple times to buy, mail, craft, sell and log off pretty much.
---
&gt; You lose combo points on target when you start generating combo points on a new target, iirc.  
---
In vanilla rogues loses their combo points upon switching targets. It wasn't untill patch 2.0.3 (tbc) that this was changed so rogues would only lose their combo points if they started generating points on a new target (like you said).  
---
This is actually a pretty big deal, if mouseover and focus doesn't get fixed to remove combo points.
---
bröther blizz we crave the blue paragraphs pls end our torment
---
tbh 99 Rc is like 300 hours tops. which will probably be about the same as the average persons /played to hit 60
---
Honestly that molten core thing was such a big letdown. Granted, MC was NEVER what you call “hard”, but the fact 40 lfr strangers could plow through it without experience, voice chat, effort, or even skill, just felt like such a cheese fest. It was like the Black temple timewalk, it was kind of fun... but it just shat on what it used to be, and reminded me how much I hate the current game.
---
Same with Ulduar. I actually resubbed just to try Ulduar timewalking and immediately regretted it. It was just aweful groups of strangers plowing through content, until they got to a certain boss that had mechanics you couldn’t just plow through with dps, and they would quit, that was your lockout.
---
bv set is good for phase 5 since you'll switch to fire for aq. So you'll drop Ringo's and get a 2% crit bonus from having tailoring. However, if you get robe of volitile power that's a good peice to use in place of bv chest.  
---
Also that list of hit gear may be hard to collect for a mage. Warlocks are going to fight for that +hit gear in bwl, so unless your raid has good caster rng you may not get it all. It's probably best just to know your options, see how the loot plays out, and adjust as needed.  
---
It's worth saying too, you don't absolutely need 10% hit over everything else. Everything is a balance to max dps.
---
I saw the original boxart on the inside flap of a dwarf shooting a blunderbuss at a dragon and i needed that in my life.
---
Thank you for answering my questions!
---
I cannot remember many good things about Cata. Some of the dungeons like Grim Batol were good. Also the difficulty was pretty good at the beginning (still nothing beats Shattered Halls Heroic for 5 men imo). I dropped out of the xpac fast (after having played Classic, TBC and Wrath for ages), because I was just sitting in OG and had absolutely nothing to do.
---
As a rogue main I had 1 set.    Do the most dps set.   With only a few things to change around    (I also never raised passed bwl)   so never had a nature res set.  Or cold.
---
We all know hunters will roll on all weapons
---
Yeah, I agree, timeless isle really isn’t THAT bad. I think it kind of hurt the experience though, when the best way to play it was to grind the same spot of frogs over and over. It got very mind numbing so fast for me. Whereas Quel Danas was a place you dailied in and that was it, or it had an excellent 5 man and the hardest raid in WoW history.
---
Exactly. There’s a few people in this thread that have horrible reading comprehension and think I’m a “carebear” that wants nobody to have fun pvping. I just want people to have the choice to play how they want to play.
---
As someone who's played private servers for a long time, stay the fuck away from private servers. Especially this close to launch.
---
Yep loved cinematic, made me wanna play sooo bad 😀
---
&gt; Is there a macro that change automatically between them every GCD?
---
This is not possible.
---
Thanks, been a bit confused about it. Highly appreciate your response.
---
&gt; Item and talent data is readily available in numerous places. Hell, they could just get it from the Nost code, which they most likely have up and running already.
---
The appeal for me is having the official data. If they start filling in the gaps with best-guess sorta-fits-on-the-surface data from outside sources, there will be no authenticity and I might as well be playing on a private server. Classic for me is all about Blizzard using their numbers, not ours. 
---
But I digress, this will just go on and on at this rate. I don't really disagree with your sentiments, we all have our own views about what it should and shouldn't be.
---
Am I in the minority that I would rather have a stick that offers + agility than any weapon without stats or with Str
---
Gnomeregan listed as a capital and not a dungeon.
---
Neverforget
---
Nah I just played retail vanilla and remember how awful 15 to 20 min queues were on horde side before battle groups. If that's what you're looking for from classic than we have wildly different tastes.
---
Thank you so much for posting this! Do you know how hard it is when I try to google all the alliance flight points? It always comes up as something else or it gives me the wrong xpac
---
Spirit of Aquementas original with the -25 mana to all spells casted, got changed to +sp/heal in later patches. Huge item for holy paladins, decent for other healers.
---
You really don't need a super computer, I was playing BFA with a AM2+, 8gb ram, GTX960(2gb), 250gb SSD, everything was just fine.  Pvp, raids, mythics, standing around Orgrimmar we're all over 80fps at 1080p.  I HIGHLY DOUBT classic will be more needy than BFA.  
---
But if you can swing a nice PC the answer is always yes do it.
---
Well said.
---
Cata heroics were actually really fun, I agree. For a month or two. However, even though people complained about the difficulty, if Cata came out after BC, people would be saying the heroics are too easy. It’s just kind of funny how having Wrath in between two shifts perspectives so far. 
---
One side note... i hope they rerelease the WoW trilogy for Classic. And when they do Wrath, I reeeeaally hope they address the problem 5 mans had. There was no challenge. I played the shit out of BC and I don’t think I ever managed to clear every heroic. Meanwhile, I could clear every heroic in Wrath in under 15 minutes with random strangers.
---
I’m no changes normally, but Wrath could certainly use a revision as far as their 5 man content goes. I don’t think mythic+ is the answer, but maybe a static Mythic?
---
His group might not have a
---
Had anyone else who could have used it.
---
This post put a smile on my face
---
I've played on private servers and one in particular where the factions were so imbalanced that it resulted in the disadvantaged faction started losing so badly that they lost interest in PvP.
---
Battlegroups 100% take away from the communal experience of the game, but in the interest of keeping Classic healthy I think it's a necessary evil because I've seen what happens when the system doesn't work.
---
Destiny, my first epic in WoW!
---
u gunna hit lvl 60 irl soon
---
You initial statement of painting everyone who disagrees with my point evil is just pot kettle black 😂😂 
---
Firstly, your talking nonsense. If your graphics are set to low, then people you see will be low, the people who see you, will see you in whichever way they chose to play their graphics. 
---
Secondly your last point is irrelevant. The new graphics steady exist. The content they are implementing, already exists. There will be zero new content for Vanilla until Naxx is cleared at least and you sit there acting like people wanting classic their way (people who also have fought to have Classic by signing their names where possible and fighting their battles) are harming the creation of a game that is ALREADY created. In all aspects, good graphics and bad. 
---
The issue is people have SOMEHOW been operating under the delusion that the thousands upon thousands of signatures that went to blizzard were to beg for a museum. No. Some of us begged for a game with community, a game with some purpose to play and a game that actually is a game, rather than an over priced transmog suite. I don't care what the world I'm playing in looks like, and I don't care how other people choose to set there settings either. 
---
I care about the gameplay.
---
I care about the community.
---
I care about the classic experience as it is today. 
---
Arguing that it's meant to be a museum recreation you may as well sit and scream at Shedo for finding ways to play feral DPS because Thats not what was played back in the day. Or two handed fury 1 hour 58 minute naxx clears.
---
Thanks for the explanation. I appreciate it :)
---
I still haven't decided how much time I'll take for 60, but it's good to know FirstAid&gt;Tailoring in all situations.
---
Yikes
---
It was clearly really big for games on the quake engine. I used it for cod1, 2 and Jedi Knight 2 and 3.
---
VE is a debuff applied to a target (treated as a curse). It heals your party as a percentage of any shadow damage you deal. The only way to increase the amount healed by VE is to increase your shadow damage, from whatever source applicable (talents, gear, potions).
---
What a retard lmao
---
Same set for PVP ?
---
Blizzard uploaded their internal alpha client to the Blizzard Content Delivery Network (CDN) which basically made it public access, since anybody can download files from the CDN. That's where BNET downloads game files from for instance.
---
It just wasn't added to the BNET client, so in order to get the files you had to request the files manually from the servers. From there it's a matter of booting up the game and giving it the instructions required to enter the game world.
---
&gt; I have literally provided you numbers previously and so have others you choose to ignore it and stop responding when that happens. You have done so time and time again.
---
No you haven't. All you (and the other fellow) have presented was some unknown survey done who knows where, who knows where, no source, no nothing - a survey which showed around 1.5-2k people saying they'd want to play on an RP-PvP realm, which seem like they are nowhere to be found nowadays for the reasons listed below. 
---
&gt; Your using a reddit as a base for something rather than things in general. It is more likely that we would see guilds come over from Live which wouldn't be actively recruiting on a reddit because why would they - they have already made their communities.
---
Which is why I linked [wowprogress](https://www.wowprogress.com/realms/rank/eu) to show you there's fewer minimally progressed characters on former RP-PvP realms (defined at the bottom of that page) than on Argent Dawn (RP) and 3-4 times fewer than on the popular PvE/PvP servers, which does support the fact that RP-PvP is not very popular even on retail.  
---
&gt; Private Servers have never represented roleplay, so in general roleplay guilds are less in number and even less so RP-PvP guilds because of the toxic nature of people - like you. It's well known that during US hours the toxicity is generally worse than EU hours depending on servers.
---
But I was not talking about any guilds on any private servers, I was strictly talking about [this list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e7nMh8IaH5mNZ7MOx2it8MF7ULYdCIT0VqO6ubaUDq4/edit?usp=sharing) compiled by the owner of one of the most popular Classic WoW guild recruitment Discord server owners - with all the known/announced guilds which are announced for Classic WoW and is being updated daily. My guild isn't on any private server either but is still announced there - and RP-PvP now has 10 guilds out of 249 posted there, which is about 4%.
---
&gt; Also the fact you seem to insinuate ERP
---
I did not insinuate anything, I stated that we're not disagreeing with you because of the ERP as means of saying "we're not just haters because of what goes on in those servers" because you seem to have a bit of a delusional victim complex thinking we "toxic PvPers" are out to get you along with Blizzard or something, because you are *that* significant to us and your way of life clearly matters a lot to us that we should automatically agree with your demands because you have feelings and those are more important than population numbers, expenses, server economy and so forth. 
---
&gt; Stop acting like an RP hating child - RP-PvP is arguably the way the game should always be played after all its a MMORPG
---
There we go again with that righteous bullshit talk about "we're so much better than you because we're not toxic, asshole" or the "this is how the game is supposed to be played" talk - no wonder this community doesn't care that much about you.
---
If anyone is being childish here, that's you - I never once called you anything but you keep on insulting me while flexing the weirdest shit at me like I can't have my own story without 40 other players engaging in my narrative, or by writing long walls of text and complete sentences means you're more mature than other people, and you're so *mature* that you need your own safe space away from people who choose not to do that. 
---
&gt; Dude, I am more than happy to help you heal the scars that have been caused to you by sections of the RP community, just admit you need help.
---
None of the RP shitposters have even come close to realistically bothering me, I just like trying to make those righteous pseudo-intellectual arrogant pricks see things from outside their bubble - chances are, they're not as friendly, mature, intelligent and understanding as they think they are and I get a laugh hearing the stupidest arguments I'm ever going to hear in this game about anything. 
---
**So I'm going to ask you again**, this time spare me the toxic commentary, the "he said, she said" non-sense - can **you** bring any proof that there is a significant number of players who are exclusively interested in playing on an RP-PvP server? If not, it doesn't really matter whether you accept my assessment or Blizzard's opinion - you're probably not getting an RP-PvP server.
---
Hell I have always mained Horde and my favorite city is still Ironforge.
---
Different game. They guessed on a lot of things like armor value and how mechanics actually worked. You may be able to 3 man a few instances until you get to like scarlet monastery and higher. Then your dps won't be enough for your healer to not go oom on certain pulls
---
Tanking 5 mans as warrior:
---
* Mechanically harder than tanking raids unless you have engineering shield/grenades/crystal charge/oils of immolation.
---
* You have to mark every pull or the dps will never coordinate with each other. 
---
* You are in high demand so you will find groups very quickly. You can take advantage of this and reserve items if you wish.
---
Tanking raids as a warrior:
---
* In a guild, main tanks should have near perfect attendance. Off-tanks should have pretty high attendance. 
---
* Flasks and financial aid for the MTs is pretty common but depends on the guild. You usually don't need to flask while off-tanking.
---
* MTs only need a set of fire resist gear in their bags. Off-Tanks will use fire resist, nature resist, and frost resist sets over the course of the game.
---
* MTs should know all the pulls and keep the run moving forward. If you don't know them, learn by off-tanking or studying a video. 
---
* Off-Tanking is pretty chill. Very low responsibility. Dps or swing nightfall/annihilator until you're needed then tank some adds here and there.
---
``Blood Fury: Increases base melee attack power by 25% for 15 sec and reduces healing effects on you by 50% for 25 sec. 2 min cooldown.``  
---
This is the one we'll be getting most likely. Looks decent to me.
---
15 Str and 8 Stam. There is literally no useful stat for a hunter. Even if no one else wants it, you just vendor it. When you see a hunter with a Str weapon for whatever reason, it's probably best to put him on ignore list anyway.
---
If we could manage to walk from one fight to the next without 2 or 3 DCs, we called it a win.
---
Honestly any news is music to my ears at this point. Especially as we’re nearing summer, there’s so many big juicy points I want to hear about. The extent of sharding confirmed, the reporting system, populations and number/names of servers, and so on...
---
But a release date would be pretty cool :/
---
They would be able to craft their own sapper charges.
---
I'm going to be leveling 3, not multi-boxing.  At least 3 to start...  I plan on wandering around and re-finding everything again, with no set plan of action.
---
Another daily, thank you.
---
Yes. By then we will have completed all the content and people coming in as new players won't feel left out because the level cap will still be 60.
---
I guess I haven't thought about this aspect of Classic as much as others, since I was not a Vanilla player, but even as someone who started long after Cata, I've always felt sad about the broken parts of the world that I know used to be so different and whole. Now that I think about it, this is one of the biggest things that I'm really looking forward to; being able to see the old world of the game as it was meant to be at the start, and having all of it actually be a living, relevant place again, and not just the sad empty stage that it is in retail, where I've only seen it after everyone had so long moved on.
---
I say go for it, just don’t invest in your character.
---
You’ll be more prepared for classic.
---
I disagree. That specific weapon is very slow with a high dmg number which makes it quite appealing for hunters IMO. Obviously the strength stat isn't that useful but Stam is Stam. That being said if I was a hunter I wouldn't roll on that if there was a pally or war in the group that needed it. But damn right I'd roll on that otherwise.
---
There are in my mind only 2 reasons to do this. 
---
1. You really prefer the everlook portal to tanaris for some reason but still want to have death ray.
---
2. You want to make money crafting and selling sappers which only goblin can make.
---
Otherwise, you can get or use most of the good goblin stuff as gnomish just need a goblin to craft for you. You keep your tanaris portal which is netter IMO.
---
It is Sunday after all.
---
What else are you going to spend your rage on?
---
I started hunter as my first class after watching this cinematic. Should I roll hunter &gt;rogue or spriest. It is hard to decide. I don't care for which is easier to level I want the best fun in pvp, I think rogue would be the most fun because of stealth I am not sure.
---
Not for shaman. They get 2 ap per str like war, druid, or pally. Jody is still very good for them, because like Warriors and paladins, it gives one for only 20 agility.
---
I loved the cinematic with Nickelback's Someday over it.
---
Well, they tried this in Cata and most people hated it.
---
Part of the community aspect to me. Finding groups for dungeons was long at first, but I made some really great friends with those forced player interations.
---
Do you know what opportunity costs are? You rack up a lot when you use your ranged weapon with corpsemaker equiped.
---
You are sacrificing white damage for an entirely new swing, doesn't generate rage be neither does heroic strike.
---
But Cata was mostly new zones in unused areas in the original two continents. And it came with a total revamp of the old world, with all its glory and all its horror.

I remember playing a beta on a us realm. (I'm EU)
---
Well they added a lot of meaningless zones in Cata and their redesign of the world largely focused on making it a more streamlined leveling process rather than reflecting any changes you'd expect from the story.
---
I think if they'd changed parts of the core world to serve max level players and cut out some of the extra zones added like the elemental plane stuff it would have been better received.
---
But yeah some people don't want anything but a word designed to be as efficient as possible for navigating
---
Casual guilds will never have Naxx on farm, let me get that out of the way. You need to put a lot of effort to get through aq40 and Naxx, and actually *keep* those people. Let alone getting 8 geared tanks that are skilled enough to do 4h. That’s nothing casual, lol.
---
BUT with that aside, maybe. I don’t want old Vanilla to become bloated though. If you put a new 5 man with “similar” gear to BRD it makes BRD less important. And say that new dungeon or two are just loot hallways like blizzard loves so much. Then instead of doing inspired Vanilla dungeons, you’re doing modern-designed 5 mans instead. 
---
I’m not opposed to 3-4 5 mans scattered throughout the 1-59 leveling process. I fear a raid wouldn’t slot in between the raids very well. Blizz took great care to make every raid important, from Mc to Naxx. I don’t know how they would make a raid sandwiched between other raids very appealing past the first run. 
---
If you mean post-Naxx, then I don’t think ther should be a raid whatsoever. I don’t want one person In tier 4 wiping the battleground floor singlehandedly. There’s already a big power creep between fresh 60 and Naxx. Any more and the game is worse as a result.
---
Maybe at some point, a “Vanilla remastered” would be cool, where it has slight tweaks and some content gaps filled, but that should be WAY down the road. I mean, 6-10 years down the road, and even then, Classic should still have a server for each region in its original unaltered state.
---
Let them release BC and Wrath first. I think what a lot of people want is something Vanilla can’t offer. Everything that made Vanilla great but with the strengths of other xpacs. Instead, just release them all over time, and we can have toons at 60, 70, and 80 to scratch each itch that each expansion scratches.
---
Vanilla, BC, and Wrath are all different beasts that have strengths and weaknesses. This is why so many people pick different favorites. Personally, BC&gt;Vanilla&gt;Wrath&gt;Every other expac. 
---
But I don’t want them to force what made BC great (class balance, lots of content) on Vanilla, because then both games are weakened as a result. For example, I LOVE 5man heroics. Would I love to do Shadowfang Keep Heroic, or Scholomance Heroic? Yes, but having them introduced would weaken the game. Keep Classic as it is, introduce the trilogy, and then maaaaybe down the road, when we’ve had a lot of time to digest the trilogy, we should think about how to change the game in ways.
---
Yeah agree. I was mainly pointing out that vanilla is much more challenging than current retail in that you have to be careful plus manage your mana.
---
It’s hard to please everyone. My biggest anticipation is going to be the back to the basics travel in classic. I guess I’ve got a thing for the mundane haha.
---
How would it be pre raid bis if it’s being released after people will have raid gear equal or better?
---
Maybe my dad works for blizzard
---
Hi, /u/ZuljinWrought
---
Yup, it's an entirely different world.
---
I literally gave you the numbers earlier and you denied them - did you not read my statement earlier based on the size of servers and so on ?
---
Your also using Argent Dawn which is a straight RP server not a previous RP-PvP server.
---
I've dealt with much worse that you in regards to toxic PvPer's and never expect anything from dev's but i have seen them try to cozy up to dev's. 
---
You claim its righteous bullshit as a way to attempt to deny anything - just like your psuedo-religious claims about satanism earlier. You damn well did make hostile claims to me and try to deny it behind words.
---
What about sites like Wow realm pop and realmpop that i quoted earlier that you denied anyway and as i said to your previous numbers they don't take into account particular variables, such as player retention which is much more important in regards to Classic WoW as you want a high retention rate rather than rapid drop off.
---
Within the spectrum of RP Servers old RP-PvP blocks in the EU take up major portions as does the US block. Retention is the most important factor - the reason they might consider no RP-PvP Servers is because they might have to put three or so in place in the EU.
---
Now I would appreciate you reading my posts rather than quoting sections that trigger you. I just wanted to phrase it in ways that you would understand based on your background, clearly I have as you've now got defensive. Sadly i've just gotta accept that your someone that can't tolerate being challenged.
---
Yes my time wont let me play as much as I want or did back in the day, but I will definitely be playing and progressing. Will probably be limited to about 5 hours a week
---
Will be looking to join a big community where Ill always have someone to group with
---
I don’t think I’m going to be able to do much more than casual blue gear. Probably will play on a PvP server and want stealth plus initiative so debatable between rogue and druid.  What’s easier to gear to be most effective do you guys think? I’m leaning towards rogue because I remember cat damage being really piss poor plus vanish, blind, cold blood, prep...yet I can’t help but consider what an advantage tanking as feral has as far as getting blue gear faster. Decisions decisions...
---
What AG007 said but its off of base melee AP which I believe comes out to just below 50 AP(?) at level 60.
---
Ye
---
Four those who are rushing to 60 because they want the endgame. Fine. You do you.
---
I just hope people aren't rushing because they feel they have to or *should*. Play the game to have fun. It's not meant to be your job so don't treat it like it is.
---
I've known quite a few people throughout the years of playing who didn't play the game like they wanted but rather how they were in some way pressured to. That's where I'm coming from with this. 
---
Me, I'll just be fucking around.   
---
I have zero plans. I have zero preparation. Why the fuck would I?    
---
I have a stressful demanding job where I'm literally engaged every single minute of my workday save for the breaks I make myself take. (Software developer.)   
---
I'm gonna die and fail and lose time and travel and explore and challenge myself and I'm gonna FAIL SO MUCH and enjoy the rezz walks because fuck putting an iota of stock into a game. Relaxing and fun. That's it.

Mom said it was my turn casting acolytes into the Sacrificial Pit.
---
Skinning is the easiest one for sure. Free gold on the ground.
---
I did not say "the blacks."
---
It's definitely nothing new. Every private server I've played on for the past 4 years has a vocal minority of edgy 4 chan addicted manchildren. Free hardcore MMO + no moderation = a lot of unhappy losers getting a chatroom to talk to.
---
Balanced servers don't mean balanced pvp queues though. You could have a faction that cares more about pve and not be queuing for bgs that often. Where the other faction is more pvp geared and has a decent amount constantly queuing for them. Yes a natural population imbalance can cause long queues but having balanced population doesn't guarantee short queues either.
---
I liked the special story that these weren't just  demonized domestic faction mounts, but corrupted wild horses that resented having their freedom taken away.
---
Heroic Strike?
---
I clicked on a random spot, saw Blackfathom Depths and sighed. It's Blackfathom Deeps. People always get that wrong.
---
If overgeared enough, 1 tank 1 heal 1 dps and a good chunk of patience is totally enough to do any dungeon in Vanilla. I did not do it in all dungeons but I did it a few times for fun with friends back in the day.
---
It wouldn't solve the problem. A balanced population doesn't mean a balanced queue for pvp. Also you risk forcing people out who want to play with their friends or the faction they like.

No it wasn't.  It still had lfd lfd, multiple difficulties for raids, and welfare epics.  Impossible to have a good game with those mechanics
---
I don't think you know much about anything.
---
"Dude?! You obviously don't know how to enjoy Classic. This game is a 14 yo game that has been figured out again and again. If you don't play it for the crunchy numbers then you're just a worthless player".
---
jk OP. Plus a million upvotes for the chuck Norris memories you triggered in me.
---
You nailed me so well. I totally don't get downvoted in the politics subreddit frequently for pointing out bias. Funny how quickly you stereotyped me.
---
Biggest one for me is sharding. 
---
I think I could accept something like sharding contested zones of heavily biased PvP realms, for the sake of a bit of balance. Beyond that though? No way. Sharding is *the worst*.
---
I hope they bring a website just for classic, like the old one!
---
I find as a tank rage management differentiates a good tank vs average in 5 mans. What I mean by this is it’s hard to hold aggro with no rage but if you learn to use your rage sparingly and blood rage between fights to keep your pool of rage from decaying you will have an easier time producing threat. Then it becomes a game of finding out just how much you can pool during pulls without losing aggro.
---
Big 2h's are very good for Hunters in pvp. Raptor strike crits damn hard and often with talent
---
Here's the problem: PvE is already going to be easy due to factors outside Blizzard's control (player skill, community knowledge, etc.). If they make it ***even easier*** by giving everyone the most powerful items and talents it's only going to degrade the overall quality of the game, and that's bad for everyone.
---
I wish I knew my dad.
---
That was realy intresting, thanks. Can you do the same thing for the raid loot.
---
For pvp you want a slow 2h
---
Thank you for answering my questions! I had a couple other questions if you don't mind:  
---
1. I was planning on tailoring as one of my professions, What would be another good one, I heard engineering is good, but I don't really plan on pvping(maybe for titles or a mount whenever BG comes out) but mainly on raiding.  
---
2. Why do frost mages take Cold snap? Is there situations where using Ice Block back to back is required or using Ice Barrier back to back helps?  
---
3. I heard that mages should AOE farm with blizzard when they hit level 20. Would this tree be best for that? https://classicdb.ch/?talent#of0y0ofZZVGMIcfzho  
---
4. Was spamming Blizzard on group mob pulls in dungeons/raids better than single target with highest rank frostbolt?
---
I always thought there was something off with modern WOW's FOV, but I  couldn't put my finger on it. Until I found [this video](https://youtu.be/6tx0zfziIhE)
---
I personally am not a fan of this changes since everything seems to appear smaller and further away. What do you think?
---
The problem with this is that it screw over players who want to go back and do old content they didn’t get to do the first time around.
---
Also anyone who loved the world as it was. They’d be pissed that they world they fell in love with doesn’t exist anymore (e.g. Cataclysm)
---
Few people seem to appreciate how fine of a line it is.
---
Although I've played since late vanilla, I was never able to see classic Azshara. I only hit level 60 in Wrath and by the time Cata came around, I had never figured out how to get there.
---
I look forward to exploring the zone in its full glory for the first time soon.
---
Datsik song "my guns go boom boom and yours guns go click click"
---
&gt; Any tanks out there have good experiences with pugs in dungeons/ubrs?
---
Good experiences yes.  Awful experiences even more so.  I'd spent more time trying to stop the groups from wiping us than I'd spend on running the dungeon efficiently and well.  At 60 I generally did mostly guild groups just because it was easier to kick idiots and I could relax more and just have fun.   Once you hit 60 you really don't have to tank for anyone you don't know or like.  There's a lot of freedom in that. 
---
&gt;How important is it to make good healing friends? I'm finding tanking with my druid while lvling in vanilla to be very hit or miss with healers.
---
I've had awful healers and I've had awesome healers, and generally I don't really care how good the healer is.  If they suck, I slow down the pulls a bit and mark up more CC, use pots, kite tank, etc.  If they're awesome, I pull, pull, pull and blast through instances.
---
“Just say blacks” is still referring to an entire group of people by a color instead of actually saying they’re people regardless of whether or not you include “the”
---
Nice writeup thank you!
---
That is good to hear. At Blizzcon they fiddled around with the lighting of a lantern so you can assume they will provide the true weather.
---
If it gets fixed then preferably it would be to make Jed a standard spawn. That trinket is one of the few caster trinkets available outside of raids.
---

But allow me to correct your nitpicking and clarify that just calling them “blacks” can be equally dehumanizing. Nothing changes from what I said, and now I’ve literally used your words verbatim.
---
the new water effect is so ugly, it looks like liquid metal, no water :/
---
Real classic was 2004, keep “triggering nerds!!!”” Though
---
Same but the tower scene with the mage. Spent a lot of time blasting fools from av towers.
---
&lt;/3
---
Yeah Wrath didn't have the best 5 mens, but I never ever had so much fun in raids than with ICC, Ulduar and remade Naxx (never seen it in Classic). Also it has by far (!) the best atmosphere of the leveling areas. Never again did they reach such a standard. Crafting was great, building Motorcycles all day. And flying through Sholazar for ages. I think gameplay wise TBC hit the best spot, but from the story and atmosphere Wrath topped it all.
---
A rework of all three would great, but I'm good with Classic at the moment ;)
---
Druids fill a different role than rogues in PvP at any gear level, and the role that druids fill never is the stealth &amp; kill playstyle due to reasons you've already guessed: cats (and druids in general) don't do a ton of damage in most cases. That said, the value of druids in PvP (regardless of gear level) is that they're really difficult to kill and simultaneously one of the most mobile classes in the game, so they work as the best WSG flag carriers and AB/AV point protectors, or be a very slippery battleground support healer. These roles don't require a ton of gear to make use of, which is important because you're assuming you're never going to get more than blues. Another perk for druids is that if you're willing to put the effort into learning to play either feral tank or resto/HoTW heals (feral spec dungeon healer can work well) you can have a really fast, easy &amp; smooth time getting groups for 5 man dungeons, enabling you to get your sad blue gear even faster :)
---
Rogues obviously do a much better job of actually killing than druids, but are more gear dependent by far. A rogue in blues vs a MC-geared rogue with [https://classicdb.ch/?item=18816](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18816) is going to be a big power level difference.
---
It depends on your playstyle, though. If you truly think you'll never raid, poorly geared druids are going to be overall a much more valuable part of any battleground (group pvp) team than poorly geared rogues, given that a poorly geared rogue probably won't even be able to pick off lone healers solo without cooldowns so can't really fill the rogue's role in a BG that well... Though, again, if you don't like to support people and you want to kill things, druids won't be fun
---
Morgans Vigil and Thorium Point flight paths are missing.
---
You can easily 3 man most pre-40 dungeons. Its SUPER inefficient and takes a long time, but not difficult.
---
[There you go.](https://classicwow.live/guides/19/threat-guide-and-reference-table) :)
---
It's a shame they didn't offer one with a goblin.
---
So glad i did not play this expansion. I would have quit the moment they destroyed Under city and Darnassus. What a shame.
---
Very cool.  Pretty sure I know most of it by heart by now, but I'm saving this anyways.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but Heroic Strike double-dips into your rage in that not only does it cost rage but it also removes the rage you would have gained from the next white hit, making it less than ideal as an economic use of rage vs. slam, yes?
---
Ah, see, I feel the opposite about Desolace. I absolutely loved the old, well, *desolate* feel of the place, and all the new oases confuse the aesthetic, imo. Similar with WPL - gimme blighted wastelands **or** lush gardens, mixing the two starts whittling away at the personality of the zones.
---
I'm sure the warriors etc really appreciate that spell damage.
---
So, we're at the lowest tier of progression here. Consumes get "worse" as your gear gets better because they're static and don't become more powerful while your better gear is giving you more stats.
---
Frostbolt rank 10 (so this is before rank 11 from AQ20, which would make the flask represent even less of the overall damage) average damage is 446.5. 300 spell power gives 244.2 damage per frostbolt. The flask (which by the way hardly anyone will ever use because actual vanilla black lotus spawns are **much** longer than your shitty private servers so supply will be far lower) gives 142.45 damage per frostbolt. This represents about a 20.6% increase in damage. I'm no mathematician, but this is about half of the original number, and as far as I'm aware you can't get this much raw damage from other consumables combined. This is also at the lowest gear level where these buffs give the *biggest* boost to your stats and become significantly less powerful as your gear gets better. Let's not pretend that people are flasking up for MC. So, maybe for fresh 60's the number works. It simply doesn't for anyone that has gear. Or isn't a caster. You're an idiot.
---
until they get right klick reported by other enchanters
---
Oh really, that low? I mean 50 AP is still something but I thought it was at least above 100 AP at lvl 60.
---
I tried World of Warcraft because Sony butchered Star Wars Galaxies.

How did Horde manage to compete in PVE without Blessing of Salvation? Or better said, how did some classes manage on Horde without Salv?
---
I could see Warlocks getting by thanks to Tranquil Air totem, but what about the melee? Especially Warriors?
---
Yeah, water is just bad, but you'll have a sider for that separate from graphics, so it's all good.
---
Thank you roe your kind words. It has been a pleasure /s
---
I think if they do implement it, they'll only add it for maybe the starting zones, or the first 10 levels.
---
And it may not be a bad idea, since you do usually tend to get a huge concentration of people in those areas.
---
If they dare shard Stormwind or Orgrimmar I will be PISSED
---
Son?
---
Reading through this list is a great reminder of how terrible some items were at release.
---
As long as we have the option to play with the graphics as they were, I dont care.
---
Yeah its definitely something the player base can be divided on, personally I think what they did with Arathi Basin in BFA should have been the norm from the start.  It was a dead zone devoid of content or players for years, if people were really interested in older content they'd be exploring it.  I bet Blizzard's internal data shows that most players actually don't bother to go back and explore old content for the sake of it.
---
I mean how many people complained that Arathi Basin was changed?
---
damn thats some good quality map, thx for sharing
---
i was too busy in university to play &lt;/3   
---
in some ways i'm glad and others, sad; friends of mine flunked out and divorced afterward, i missed a hell of a good show
---
Me and my roommate were discussing this last night as well.  She played exclusively Alliance back then, and we were trying to figure out the Alliance equivalent of the Barrens, Westfall was our first thought, but you're right, it's a much smaller level range, and not nearly as big.  It does have the Deadmines though, which is pretty much the quintessential Alliance dungeon of WoW.  It's so hard to pick.  I think for my next one I'm going to shoot for a higher level contested zone.  Tanaris would be super fun to do!  I love that place! Thanks for watching, I appreciate the kind words! :)
---
If that's your belief, then you roll a frost mage.  But just don't be in a raid / group with me.  MMMkay?
---
Then again, I played classic, not sure what version you played.
---
Yeah if I was horde id probably try and go for some kinda 2 Hander spec. Rolling paladin tho, holy mainly, maybe ret sometime in world pvp or battlegrounds but I doubt it, 2 expensive to respec :DD
---
Am i gonna gimp myself as a pvp only player if i don't want to do any large pve raiding whatsoever ?  Will i be able to make money and buy decent gear that i can keep up in pvp ? Rogue / warlock classes.
---
I wish I wouldn't know that my dad ist also my brother
---
You buy them on the auction house ingame if you want to use them. You buy them in the ingame shop if you want to sell them for gold.
---
Just get in the habit of only using it when you won't be taking any damage from AOE. That -healing debuff is a universal "don't waste your time healing me" sign to healers.
---
Or how about: No
---
You think Activision will take less money on a game they aren’t going to make a lot of money on
---
what the faaak xD
---
Keep in mind Holy is fantastic in battlegrounds. You obviously won't be going around swinging hammers at people, not much anyhoo, but it's still great.
---
We don't really know yet if you can play in Classic at all without a subscription, though. The lvl 20 deal is for retail.
---
Wife and friend goes on holiday and the boys stay uninterrupted playing classic. Now that is the dream
---
Dont buy anything on the AH and sell everything. I fucked up so much on my first playthrough. Ended up solo farming SM and selling fiery enchants on my rogue. Took forever.
---
There aren't any raids listed on it.
---
I notice you didn't include raid gear but even some raid gear in phase 1 will be BiS thru multiple phases, such as the Bonereaver Edge.
---
I would like to see a narrowed down version of this list along with all Phase one loot(like BRE) that are BiS for more than 2 phases. Because I would like for a few of the overwhelming outliers, thing like Savage Gladiator Chain, Bonereaver's Edge, and the like, to be pushed back to later phases to give more progression thru-out.
---
Does anyone know of any other 1.12 version BiS items from phase 1 that'll last til AQ40?
---
No thats the cove on the east bank
---
It changed from an FOV that was appropriate for 4:3 to an FOV that's appropriate for 16:9. This is a good thing.
---
what if they can't uphold the release date and they have to delay would you be mad?
---
Absolutely, it's the thing I hated most about Cataclysm. There were so many questlines that were cool/epic/creepy, with maybe a joke quest here or there. After Cataclysm, practically every zone questline was a movie reference. Every side character hopping around was a pop culture reference or celebrity. It became impossible for me to RP or immerse myself while levelling because everything was made to be a callback to real life. And it really just disappointed me, they took a facet (the movie and pop culture references) which used to be 5% of the game, and cranked it up to 50%.
---
ramstein neck?
---
this would make them more money, so...
---
Leather farming spot. Turtles
---
Is this a video saying the 21/x/21 base cold blood prep build is good in PvP?
---
yeah the ''go to a new hub every 3 quests'' was especially bad in hyjal, imo. i get what they were going for but it just didn't work. i obviously remember the main cities, but can anyone think of a widely memorable and loved QUEST HUB from cata onwards? places like darkshire, sentinel hill, camp taurajo and crossroads, they're so iconic
---
You can turn it off
---
I'm glad they aren't rushing it out the door and fixing it with patches like every game nowadays. Let's get a good experience from day 1.
---
Another real issue is which Linkin Park song to use for my pvp video
---
I think you have a misunderstanding; the "new" fov is just proper fov when using widescreen monitors.
---
The picture is the only content of the thread, and the picture is political. Therefore, the thread is political and in violation of r/classicwow's rules
---
Feeling like it’s going to be pushed back TBH. You’d think with a summer release date they would’ve announced it given we’re almost in May.
---
Stormwind is a maze, the canals are the hedges and they force you to take roundabout ways to get around the city
---
Just use an old monitor with no widescreen cababilities and you can have your FoV back lel

---
I'll get my toons reserved and let the initial rush die down. First week will be hell no matter what. I'm certainly not taking time off for that.

^^He’s right, you know.

I still watch his from time to time, even before classic was announced. Of course with the sound turned all the way up.

That's how I remember it, but I never tried dropping and releveling.
---
So dell is reputable then?
---
Perhaps no changes for 3-4 years. Ofc new quests and story lines would be welcome for utility items and cool cosmetics
---
Ok thank you
---
It passes the test of it was in original vanilla so I have no problem with it. But just like the AV changes there’s a vocal minority that will never be pleased.
---
Even if it did, it´s not worth it...the healing bonus would be even smaller than it is if you were a full shadow (25% more shadow dmg)...by math if you had 200 spirit at lvl 60, 25% bonus damage from spirit via that talent would be 50. Let´s say your basic damage of Mind Blast is 600. You would have dealt 650 damage with Mind Blast in this form and 800 in shadow form. That is a difference of 216 and 266 heal from VE. Add damage from SW:P and MF. Combined you heal your group more than you would with a renew.
---
If you want to play a Shadow priest but still be in a normal form to be able to heal your teammates, I suggest this build:

You have better mana regen, sustain, more mana which is crucial, 15% CC resist, 20% interrupt resist chance, Inner Focus and so on...Remember, if you want to be able to heal your team via Vampiric Embrace, you need to cast ONLY shadow spells = MB, SW:P and MF. Your build has improved holy damage and spells such as smite and holy fire which you dont want to use because your VE would not benefit from that. If you want to be casting those spells, I suggest avoid Shadow spec completely and make disco/holy:

---
with this build you have strong heals and strong damage via smite and holy fire. You will not be using your shadow spells much but you will have very nice holy damage and better healing potential so you are better for a team-fight and BGs...the upper spec is great for small PvP. I´ve been using the upper one for fun a lot.
---
Otherwise, I suggest going full Shadow:

---
This is the basic God build...you are immortal while you have mana. The healing of VE is nuts. If you get a MB crit for 1500, 300 per tick of SW:P and you cast your full MF which does another 300 per tick, you can heal up by 1/3 of your HP in this rotation. The only problem is, as I said earlier, mana...What I have been doin is that I was using downranked damage spells when I was under 50% of mana...I was still able to deal generous amount of damage and outlast my enemies via amazing heals that VE provides. 
---
If you want to roll a priest, try one of these specs.
---
Yeah I agree.
---
BRE is less of a priority for me because it's only PvE use is likely on a Ret Pally or 2h Fury Warr (Horde only). But it's still badass in PvP. 
---
The caster belt is also pretty wild for a phase 1 item.
---
Amazing
---
Oh yeah for sure! Its really strong support with the blessings and cleansing. Ill definitely heal BGs , gonna be rough open world tho, maybe il have to aoe farm undeads with Holy spec and some thorns / tank like gear \^\^
---
hahahaha
---
Budget is a good question, in a tough spot right now after a rough breakup but I start a new job in 2 days. I will probably wait until just before classic release so I can save up, but I would say under $1k for everything including monitor would be reasonable
---
Just out of curiosity, what are your plans for classic with regards to faction/race/class/server type?
---
Personally, I played Undead Mage back in the day on a PVE server. I really enjoyed playing mage and want to do it again, but I also want a new experience. I ultimately settled on switching it up by going Alliance with a Gnome Mage on a PVP server. 
---
Can't wait to play! Your videos are getting me really excited to get back in there!
---
&gt;My issue is that my wife and her best friend want to book a holiday out of country while me and my best friend(also wifes beasties boyfriend) play classic wow. This have to be booked in advance, its even cheaper if its booked in advance.
---
To paraphrase [Prof. Richard Quinn](https://youtu.be/rbzJTTDO9f4?t=792):
---
_"I don't care what's on your schedule.  
---
I don't care what you have planned.  
---
If you have to give birth,  
---
you gonna give birth in the starting zone.  
---
Because it's gonna have to take a signed,  
---
hand delivered note from GOD  
---
to tell you a release date in advance."_
---
You know what? i won't stop telling people paladin tank is a good tank, Feral DPS is a good dps and retri being a good DPS, because that's not false information. I played on a few private Servers for 5+ years and i think at that point these things weren't just exceptions, especially when i was able to reapplicate what they did.
---
But i will stop arguing, because i can tell you that u are wrong, but even with proofs u wouldn't believe. So there is no sense in convincing you otherwise, u just won't believe and so do many people. You also believe that Naxx is hard i guess, but u guys will be dissapointed soon enough. I don't know if it's the nostalgia or what but that's not my problem, i tried my best but u are acting ignorant and as if everything u would say IS TRUE no matter what. 
---
I just pray to god u are not leading a raid, that u would be a whole disaster if u would not even let ferals in that are better then ur rogues or u kicking them after them beating the rogues in the damage.
---
Have a good day and hopefully you will have a competent Feral DPS, Pally Tank and/or retri DPS in ur raid so you can see by yourself how good they actually are and maybe then convince u otherwise.
---
Not really, if you do 5 mans you will be geared enough. You'll be fine on gear once phase 2 releases and you get a decent rank.
---
Ehh... It certainly wasn't classic, and I wouldn't say those features are necessarily BAD per se. But MoP really was the expansion that most people agree had the most fun class balance. The environment design in Pandaria was fantastic, the story was at least somewhat interesting, and damn if enhancement didn't feel good to play.
---
somebody has to buy tokens with $ in order for them to exist.  blizzard makes an extra $5 for every token purchased, they never give anything away for free
---
Second hand might be a good idea for me. I’m going through a rough time right now after a breakup, but start a new job in 2 days and my plan is to save up as much as I can before classic release. So it will probably be a few months before I buy something, I’m sure yours will be sold by then
---
All visual changes/updates are good as long as they can be turned off.
---
Doesnt work on 1.12 private servers.
---
Tried it during the wetlands run. It just put me at the spirit healer that was closest to my body
---
Great thank you!
---
Where's the weather effects news and when is the release
---
Ok thanks!
---
that's debatable. i agree that vashj'ir was a really good zone; the water controls don't bother me (but they might bother somebody else) and i love the ocean scenery.
---
hyjal felt like you were constantly on the move and having a new hub every 2 seconds, which could feel annoying and rushed or fast-paced and fun.
---
the indiana jones quests in uldum aren't good but imo the rest of the zone is great. 
---
deepholm, i... honestly don't remember a lot about it, almost forgot it existed while writing this list. 
---
ditto with twilight highlands altho i barely quested there anyways, the intros for them were really cool though and i like the dwarf towns and the atmosphere.
---
while i do definitely enjoy some post-cata old world questing zones, i do think that some of them got really ruined. inb4 ''NOSTALGIA LUL'' i STARTED in cataclysm, so technically these new zones should be what's nostalgic for me. i think westfall is the best (worst?) example of this, for two reasons. 1) i'm not opposed to pop culture references when they are done tastefully. considering this eclipses 80% of the zone and, whether or not you understand the reference, is incredibly cheesy and in your face, isn't really great for immersion or lore value. 2) they wanted to update the zone but didn't want to progress the story in any meaningful way, so they did the same thing but with more pop culture references and different characters. yeah vancleef just happened to have a daughter who happened to recruit a dungeon boss of the same race as the old ones, and nothing about the situation can change, improve or worsen because writing a new path for the zone to take would take more effort.
---
Although I doubt my chances, I agree haha. My wife wants to take the kids to her parents for a week from the 1st of july. If classic could release then I would be the happiest guy in Aus.
---
I might look into that once my life is a bit more stable, thanks
---
Holy crap the gun sounds...
---
When I got the dragon breath hand cannon (?) from BWL I hated the sound SO MUCH that I modded my game to use the cs 1.6 deagle sound.
---
It. Was. AMAZING... for about 1 night. Then only having 1 sound effect without any differentiating pitches or anything really got annoying.
---
TLDW looking forward to the old gun sound again.
---
There's pretty much nothing there except a few turtles but I think you have to go past it to talk to some siren for the scarab lord quest chain
---
This actually slipped my mind. I guess I wouldn't consider spending $ for gold so I didn't retain this fact. Thanks.
---
3 good people that know their class will be much more efficient than 5 keyboard turning clueless people that made the majority of people in vanilla and that's not even taking into account knowing strategies of the encounters and such, not saying it will be fast or efficient but definitely possible
---
The big problem with adding new content to old zones is that players who are leveling new characters get screwed over. How can they actually do it? They could possibly shard the old zones so depending upon what your level is, you either see the "easy stuff" that you need for leveling, or you see the "new content" to reflect the current crisis, but then having high level players assist lower level players becomes difficult. So how can they update the old zones without screwing over people attempting to level new characters?
---
Shaman are great fun.
---
Every phase would contain a 'flavour' class with or without progressive itemization.
---
The only difference is which class is which phase.
---
It's probably just a good idea to play the class you like.
---
So I can take some annual leave and enjoy the launch experience....
---
&gt; I literally gave you the numbers earlier and you denied them - did you not read my statement earlier based on the size of servers and so on ?
---
I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that - it would be nice if you could link any actual numbers or proof you are mentioning (like I did earlier with wowprogress and guilds spreadsheet) instead of "you know I said he said few comments ago" since it's the third time I'm asking you in this thread to show any evidence there's enough people to fill a server with RP-PvP exclusive guilds/players. 
---
Yeah, I know AD is a "straight" RP server - but that survey you mentioned (I hope we're talking about the same thing, it would help if you actually linked what you were talking about like I just did in my previous comments) showed that people were here were more interested in RP than RP-PvP, whereas wowprogress sort of shows the other way around and with Blizzard also saying there's not enough players for RP-PvP kind of means that survey doesn't hold against retail numbers to say the least. 
---
&gt; You claim its righteous bullshit as a way to attempt to deny anything - just like your psuedo-religious claims about satanism earlier. You damn well did make hostile claims to me and try to deny it behind words.
---
I am sorry I have to explain these things - it wasn't about the satanic message, it was about the fact that **Blizzard has no interest in trying to sabotage its own game because they are making money off of players paying to play this game** same as **Judas Priest has no interest in trying to kill its own audience because they are making money off of fans paying to listen to their music**. 
---
I am really, really sorry you didn't catch that basic analogy, I can't believe I have to explain these things. Yes, my claim was hostile because your theory was insane, uncalled for, illogical and lacking any sort of proof. If I told you that Blizzard was paying Metzen in exclusive Orcish skins for Soldier:76 in Overwatch to stay silent and retire so that Ion use the RP-PvP server money to buy Chinese farmers in order to farm artifact power on all of his 50 characters, you'd be hostile too. 
---
&gt; player retention which is much more important in regards to Classic WoW as you want a high retention rate rather than rapid drop off.
---
Do you have any proof RP-PvP servers have a higher retention of players or are you just talking out of your ass? Can you prove that any player wishing to play on an RP-PvP server is more likely to be "retained" across long periods of time playing Vanilla than on regular PvE / PvP servers - or is this just some anecdotal bullshit you're spewing because you think RP-PvPers are so much better than everyone again? 
---
Are there any more "remarkable" variables you're imagining or was that it? 
---
&gt; the reason they might consider no RP-PvP Servers is because they might have to put three or so in place in the EU
---
Sure thing, that *might* be a reason but you should note that it's very unlikely since the RP-PvP language realms were released at a [later date even in Vanilla](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/EU_English_realms_info) so I really don't know what the fuck you're on about. I can't even find the DE and FR RP-PvP realms there, nor on a quick google search. 
---
&gt;  clearly I have as you've now got defensive. Sadly i've just gotta accept that your someone that can't tolerate being challenged.
---
No, it's alright, I just don't have time to quote and respond to every stupid thing in your paragraphs, but if you keep insisting I will. There's nothing to be defensive about, I'm not the one begging the community for my own safe-space so don't be afraid to challenge any of my points.
---
No problem.
---
Professions don't matter a great deal in PvE, so it won't be a huge deal. The relevant tailoring items are the Robes of the Archmage and the Bloodvine set. Engineering is primarily relevant in PvP, but the Bloodvine Goggles from ZG rep aren't horrible. Alchemy is important, but as long as you have access to a guild alchemist, you're fine. In the long run, herbalism will be the most useful, but the other gathering professions are fine while leveling. Just make a level 1 alt with enchanting for DE convenience. Tailoring / Leatherworking / Alchemy will make you money from Mooncloth / Salt Shaker / Arcanite Bar cooldowns. I would go Tailoring + Eng / Ench / Herb - your pick.
---
Bloodvine Goggles
---
http://classicdb.ch/?item=19999
---
2. It's just a convenience thing. In PvE, it's just so you have the option of utility. It's just a good option for a 1 point throwaway talent. Your next best bet would probably be 1/3 Permafrost.
---
3. AoE  farming is doable. You have access to virtually all of your useful leveling skills by level 26 with Cone of Cold &amp; rank 2 Blizzard. It's very fast once you get the hang of it. It's very reliant upon not being interrupted by other players, which may or may not happen depending on server populations. Basically any spec in the frost tree is fine as long as you don't take Frostbite (as RNG snares don't work well when kiting multiple mobs) and you only take 2/3 Improved Blizzard (as 3/3 overrides the slow effect from Cone of Cold).
---
4. You will virtually never spam blizzard in a dungeon. Maybe 5% or less of dungeon / raid pulls are AoE. The vast majority of your interactions in PvE are Frostbolt skull, Conjure Water, Sheep moon, and Decurse. Two notable ones (that you take 2/3 Improved Blizzard for) are the Flame Imps in Magmadar's Cavern within MC and phases 1 &amp; 3 of Nefarian.
---
&gt; Also, there's some items or at least one that i know of, the arcanite dragonling, which will be lvl 62 or 63 instead of lvl 60 when you use them.
---
Wow, TIL. That's pretty neat.
---
Already ran it. client crashed.
---
I don't invite hunters to my parties.
---
I loved my resto shammy in BGs. AV especially. Was a lot of fun and you are hard to kill too.
---
Imagine caring this much about someone being retarded on the internet.
---
It just has the stat difference at 1, and the difference at 60 but lets you compare stats and racials side by side which is nice.

Chuck Norris disenchants into [Solid Steel Balls]
---
Yeah nobody should care about anything that I don’t care about tbh.
---
Nope, don’t want bed content. Only top guilds will clear Naxx. So in approx 3-4 casual /normal guilds will still be clearing BWL and AQ40.
---
I wouldn't mind personally, but I really, really don't see it happen. It would be a lot of effort for medium return (at best). And Activision is about maximum return and firing people, even if the game is profitable (see Heroes of the Storm).
---
The best you can hope for is BC and Wrath Classic, and even that is up for debate at the moment (they have no plans currently and want to see how classic performs....).
---
The best case scenario would be Classic blowing everything out of the water, unexpectedly. Like +2-3 Million subs, sustained. But even then I could see them invest in a new MMORPG instead, not tinkering with classic or even retail.
---
The only ignorant one here is you... The 3 legit worst specs for any class in the game and you're trying to back them up as some of the best. lmfao you're either extremely stupid or you're a really bad troll.
---
Resto Shamans are pretty weak pvp healers (except in AV). Most shamans will go 30/0/21 and be a buff/burst/heal hybrid.
---
Do you know what the point of that is?
---
Hi, /u/Robster17
---
soon
---
BRE has never been changed and was in the game since day 0. There is no way it wont be in p1.   
---
Its also not a raid drop but a world boe drop. So good luck farming it.
---
My Professions at the start will be Herbalism and Tailoring. Herbalism to acquire herbs, which I will save for leveling alchemy later. Tailoring for the Robes of the Archmage. 
---
Why not Enchanting? Because at the start there is no gold / economy, and I'd only benefit from the occasional enchants I can create and the wand at the early part of leveling. DEing items for mats will not fetch a good price until later in the game. 
---
Why not Alchemy? Because I intend to level it after I hit 60 and already have the Robes of the Archmage. Leveling should be very cheap with all of the herbs I hope to acquire throughout leveling up and post-leveling. This will replace Tailoring at 60, and I'll make use of the daily transmutes. Note: I have no intentions of going back into Tailoring after this is acquired, even for the bloodvine set, though that's multiple phases in so I could have a change of heart. 
---
Why not Engineering? It requires way too many tools and resources that'd be simpler to acquire and access when there's an actual economy. I'd only go this route for PvP purposes, potentially swapping out Herbalism for it. 
---
Why not Mining or Skinning? Mining is a good money maker once the economy flourishes, but isn't helpful in the early game for the resources it provides from a Mage's perspective. Skinning is a great money maker before the economy flourishes (vendoring items), and afterwards as well. However, it doesn't contribute towards my endgame goals, like Herbalism and Tailoring do. 
---
I will also focus on Fishing, Cooking, and First Aid.
---
You wouldn't update every zone, there would still be a leveling path for players, but right now you don't need 8 zones to level 1-20 and 25 or so zones to level 1-60 its just a waste of space.
---
I see that you mentioned glancing blows when calculating threat from heroic strike, but from what I've read, yellow damage abilities like that can't glance.
---
Am I missing something?
---
I'd like to see pet battles, that's about it.  I've cancelled my live subscription and am just flying around finding pets until it runs out.
---
I think you mean litrually
---
AHHHHHHHHHH.
---
That's why
---
You will be using purge a lot.
---
I'll never understand nitpicking about graphics for a game like WOW ... I'm here for the mechanics and a sense of community, I couldn't care less about graphics.
---
At lot of mechanics don't work on PSs that are supposed to.
---
Some of that is that they aren't actually 1.12. They're a 2.2 TBC core that's been stripped down and tried to scale back to previous patches. As that's what core all private servers are ultimately descended from. That's why Meeting stones have a buggy summoning functionality on all vanilla private servers, unless the Admins disabled them entirely.
---
I’m not plugged into retail enough to know what the AB change was or how it was received, so I’ll take your word for it.
---
But to respond to one of your other points, I’ve played retail on and off the last two years and all I’ve been doing is completing BC content. Rep, quests, exploration, professions, raids/dungeons. I have a few more weeks of Ogri’La dailies left, and then I’m going to move on to Northrend and do all the WotLK content.
---
I’m sure I’m in the extreme minority here, but I’m glad that Outland and Northrend have been left untouched so that I can go back and do everything I skipped the first time around. If they added to or changed those zones, I would be happy they were relevant again, but I’d be sad if, for example, Blade’s Edge Mountains was completely redesigned and Ogri’La was removed before I could hit exalted.
---
This is all to say that it’s complicated and that it’s impossible to please everyone, which it seems like is what you’re getting at as well
---
I had never played vanilla at launch. But I've been playing it for a couple of weeks on private servers. I hope I'd be able to influence the game in a positive way in the same way you want to.
---
Let me know if you set up that guild, I'd love to join.
---
May your friend rest in peace
---
Like i said, i'm not discussing with you anymore, the only thing that can change ur mind is ur own experience, i mean it wouldn't be hard to watch some videos of it too but u would maybe see them as a fake or exception so, wait for classic release, join a Guild, raid, and get ur ass beaten by any of those classes, depending on the Role u are gonna play.
---
I mean you are literally telling me, having played on a private Server, having cleared naxxramas, that these specs are bad even though i played a Feral DPS in Naxx and was top 5-10 DPS. Like how is that even possible that u really try to convince me otherwise even though i have cleared Naxx in 4 raid days with my guild. It wasn't even like the other dps'es were bad, we logged and compared the logs to other guilds, and the DMG was really goos that we did. 
---
Why are u trying to convince me to be the ignorant one? Like i don't understand how dumb a guy must be. Like are u also telling an Astronaut that saw the earth from the outside that the earth is flat? LMAO.
---
If there would be a way to aloud only that...
---
I plan on name grabbing on several servers and watching population. I'll save this post and let you know on where I commit. You seem valuable as a person and player.
---
Before Classic WoW release

i would have 12 hours of play time each time and 14 on weekends. i only work 5 hours a day and only need 7 hours of sleep. is it possible?

BRE=bonereaver's edge, the 2h sword from Rag

Ganking and 1v1
---
I'm planning on the same,
---
I'll add something to my calender to try and remember this by.
---
Resto shamans are not used as traditional healers in premades. Their healing output isn't enough to warrant mana cost. Most if not all go 30/0/21 ele resto. Which is a great spec, but not for traditional healing if that is what you want

Pendulum, Celldweller, Soilwork, Crossfade, Rob Zombie, Breaking Benjamin, In Flames, Muse

---
They can ride any mount when they fit rep-requirements and such. I'm pretty sure all races can ride any kind.
---
You can ride the other race mounts if you get Exalted reputation with that race's faction. Wolf is the only racial mount you can ride by default.
---
We are not alone brother.
---
Yes, i too can pull random numbers out of my ass
---
People just watch their threat, and let the tank build it for a while longer. Raiding as Horde just requires a bit more 'skill'.
---
I'm rolling a Priest and my plan is it to have my IRL friends I'm playing with help me quickly get 4 stacks if linen cloth and make tailor green robes, DE them, and make a handful of lesser magic wands. Then I can have one and randomly bless a handful of other priests/locks. Should be a good time.
---
$15 bucks little man, put that shit in my hand
---
lol? is this serious?
---
If you're overgeared, then whats the point?
---
Im only going to fish, cook, and grind to 60.
---
With decent classes (cc) and skilled players it should be very possible to three man most instances. Just go a level or two later, as soon as the end boss is yellow there are no unsolvable problems. I did instances in vanilla when I was a total scrub, fire mage specced somewhat into arcane for threat reduction with arcane missiles. There were hunters without ammo, tanks without shields and afk people because of mom aggro. Dungeons were still cleared.
---
NO exactly. 
---
Especially on a PvP server. 
---
Bitch you signed up, time to fight. If STV gets sharded and I have to spend ten minutes to find people there in Classic, then I’ll fraudulent charge Blizzard and get my sub back through my credit card.
---
Sorry, I was confusing it with Edgemasters Handguards.   
---
I still heavily disagree with your point tho
---

---
Thousand needles for me.
---
I miss that zone
---
No no no. I want to see 40 level fives fight one lvl 52 dwarf killing quest givers.
---
Lorewise? Casualties of the war, Sylvanas burned down Teldrassil, Alliance attacked Lordaeron to retake it and after they won Sylvanas unleashed the plague and destroyed her own city too just so that Alliance doesn't get it. Actual reason? They wanted to make it fair by having both lose one city rather than just Alliance losing Darnassus.
---
Ekspiriensu
---
I very much look forward to mind controlling people off the great lift
---
Nope! Thanks for catching it. Will modify to correct numbers.
---
Roll a Paladin or Warlock 😋
---
Not right after but it definitely helped seal the deal.
---
I hated how they "broke the world". I didn't like how they took existing zones and basically overwrote them and created new zones out of them. I didn't like that at all.
---
Best of both worlds tbh. Well done
---
To have fun?
---
Shamans are alright PvP healers, but the elemental spec is just so much better in general. It's like 90% of the healer that a resto shaman is because you're going to use mostly LHW in PvP, you can't go around casting CH and stuff like that. So you get practically nothing out of being resto. To put it in another way, when competitive PvPers talk about shamans, they only mean elemental shaman. The other two specs aren't worth talking about for high-end PvP.
---
Windfury totem.
---
Ya I’ll be casual pretty much. Do quests and zones I didn’t do back in vanilla. If I go horde I’ll avoid barrens and stay primarily in eastern kingdoms.
---
Ok sure.
---
https://www.google.de/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7n23dn/grinding_xp_grid_amount_of_mobs_you_need_to_kill/
---
Is this what you are looking for? In the First column, it lists the total amount if exp for each level
---
Technically you can get quite a lot on horde (Grace of Air Totem is about 80 AGI boost which beats kings) and WF for melee weaving but realistically it's not happening. 
---
Melee group you're going to be put in will use WF instead, and even if your shammy is going to totem twist (which is not going to happen in 95% of guilds) then it's very likely going to be threat reduction totem instead of the AGI one, unless it's a taunt-based fight.
---
Same goes for melee weaving -  more often you would want to stand away from the boss to avoid fires/fears/cleaves/boss movement issues, rather than try to land that whacky hit and hope for WF proc.
---
And finally - hunter is not really a competetive DPS class. Starting from BWL you are mostly there for utility, not damage.
---
Meanwhile I was waiting for a burnt stump labeled "Darnassus"
---
The tanks have Windfury, so that helps a bunch. Probably not as good % threat buffer as Salv though.
---
How many days after release do you think we'll see our first Ragnaros kill?
---
i'm totally fine with sharding in starting zones at launch.  ANYTHING beyond that is unacceptable in my eyes, i dont see there being valid reasoning to do it
---
Coming from a vanilla p server vet.
---
Your very first character, do not worry to much about optimization until end game (unless you prefer to be). 100% take the time and do the dungeons at the very least for the quests and rewards. Play whatever speaks to your inner nerd. Def take some time to level professions/secondary professions.
---
Honestly just enjoy yourself and dont rush. My first playthrough of vanilla was genuinley magical.

Do research and build your own PC. It's very rewarding and it saves you a lot of money in repairs when you can replace parts yourself. I buy everything piece by piece on Newegg or Amazon. Invest in a nice case that will last decades, get a good Power Supply and you can swap out the mobo/cpu/gpu every few years and sell the old stuff to friends or keep it as backups. I just bought my GF her first gaming PC and had her build it so she could learn about this stuff.

its not automated in vanilla.
---
&gt; You initial statement of painting everyone who disagrees with my point evil is just pot kettle black 
---
??? I literally quoted you, calling other people Nazi's and I told you that isn't an argument.
---
&gt; Firstly, your talking nonsense. If your graphics are set to low, then  people you see will be low, the people who see you, will see you in  whichever way they chose to play their graphics. 
---
The old character models and the new one's are entirely different, that's the point. Not having control over that is bad. I won't reiterate what I've already stated.
---
&gt; Secondly your last point is irrelevant. The new graphics steady exist.  The content they are implementing, already exists. There will be zero  new content for Vanilla until Naxx is cleared at least and you sit there  acting like people wanting classic their way (people who also have  fought to have Classic by signing their names where possible and  fighting their battles) are harming the creation of a game that is  ALREADY created. In all aspects, good graphics and bad. 
---
I have no idea what you're trying to say here but I'm assuming you disagree that you don't think it should be a muesum piece.
---
&gt; The issue is people have SOMEHOW been operating under the delusion that  the thousands upon thousands of signatures that went to blizzard were to  beg for a museum. No. Some of us begged for a game with community, a  game with some purpose to play and a game that actually is a game,  rather than an over priced transmog suite. I don't care what the world  I'm playing in looks like, and I don't care how other people choose to  set there settings either. 
---
I personally signed that petition to play vanilla, not classic+. I can't speak for thousands of other people but I'd confidentally say the no changes side of the argument is fairly large.
---
&gt; Arguing that it's meant to be a museum recreation you may as well sit  and scream at Shedo for finding ways to play feral DPS because Thats not  what was played back in the day. Or two handed fury 1 hour 58 minute  naxx clears. 
---
At this point I feel like you're either talking past me, or didn't understand what I was getting at.
---
One area that I am interested in that I have not heard people talking about much is quests.
---
How are quest giving factions that were added in patches, such as the Thorium Brotherhood, going to be handled? As they are using the 1.12 data one might expect them to be present from the start. But if progressive content and item additions are a thing, and the quests they offer reward items, one might expect them to appear later. Having a bunch of quests that do not reward items initially, but do reward them later in certain phases seems like bad design and antithetical to the philosophy described in the progressive itemisation blue post we had recently. Having the quest hubs and NPCs in the world, but not making the quests available, also seems sloppy. It essentially consigns the NPCs to wander with no purpose for months.
---
I have an academic curiosity as to how Blizzard is planning on rolling this content out.
---
Did you pay for her epic mount?
---
Just because you played in a realm with bad population balance and had 15 to 20 min queues doesn't mean that's how it'll go now. I think the pvp scene will be more active anyway now than it was in vanillas since people are more focused in min-maxing and the pvp rewards will be really good.
---
You can try using your distraction first so the mobs will turn around and then you have less of a chance of getting caught. Also could just be because you’re playing on a private server. Another thing could be the level gap if the mobs in the dungeon are 2-3 levels higher than you it’s pretty easy to get caught out of stealth.
---
Perfect! exactly what i was looking for, thanks!
---
Yeah. I know. The guy above you is a retard. Don't worry. We see him too.
---
I did the same thing! There was this hunter I harassed nonstop about his buzzard. I was like 10 years old, and that guy was a saint for putting up with me.
---
Probably a good idea, a little overwhelming for me but I’m sure I could figure it out with a good guide
---
that video was great lmao. Such a snap shot to the early 2000's
---
That should tell you all there is to know about the idea.
---
Absurd!
---
Yoink
---
I can see how not saying anything concrete can be considered playing safe, in business terms. This isn't what this is about.
---
No! 
---
Stv is quite possibly the best zone in the game precisely for all the PvP.
---
Wanna learn to play WoW? Level in stv. Between your skill book opening up (and your enemies), and the quests getting a bit harder due to mobs stv is great. It offers a trial by fire for learning the ropes of PvP and pve. If you haven’t mastered leash pulling, the trolls and venture co will make you suffer. If you don’t keep you head on a swivel and have an exit strategy, you’ll end up dying. If you let yourself get to 20% hp then drink, you will be ganked.
---
Best zone.
---
Sap is more of an "Emergency CC" in vanilla, rather than something you would use on a daily basis.
---
There is a talent in sub tree which reduces the chance to get knocked out of stealth by 90%, which makes it somewhat usable.
---
You can cheese it even without this talent if you instantly vanish after the sap or use evasion and run back to the tank, but it's sloppy af.
---
They couldn't possibly provide an answer to this.
---
Sap takes you out of stealth
---
There's a 3 point talent in sub tree that gives you a 90% chance to remain in stealth after sapping, however I woundn't recommend going Sub for anything other than PvP.
---
If you don't have improved stealth talents, sneaking up on mobs will be very difficult, you'll need to use distract to turn them around and make it a bit easier.
---
Unless your group is undergeared/underleveled for the dungeon, you really shouldn't need to sap mobs, it's just too risky. And if CC is needed, then mage/lock/hunter should be brought instead.
---
Absolutely. this week I had a few raptor eggs from Wetlands and I thought I really gotta level my cooking. This led to running to Booty Bay to fish and getting ganked a lot. Travelled to Elf Land to get the book for expert cooking. Ended up ganking horde in Thousand needles thinking a) this is awesome and b) was I not trying to level in Wetlands two days ago? How’d I end up here?
---
&gt; Is anyway excited to just play the game casually?
---
Yeah. It's kinda *why* I am looking forward to Classic: No more daily clock-ins so I don't miss out on anything (because every-freaking-thing seems to be either on a daily CD nowadays, or randomized. Or *both*. Or time-locked (like assaults). I mean, I'm probably be playing a lot, but I tend to play in waves (some days not at all, others 6 hours or more), so the whole "WoW as a job" thing doesn't work for me. I am looking forward to be able to manage my own time in WoW again.
---
&gt; Drop the occasional Chuck Norris fact in barrens chat.
---
Ugh. Never. If there's one thing I am *not* looking forward in Classic its the bozos who will try to resurrect memes and jokes that weren't funny the first time around, and have certainly not improved since then.
---
It'll be like that without sharding because you picked horde on a server with 90% of players being horde. 
---
If you weren't afraid of a fair fight their suggestion wouldn't bother you that much.
---
https://youtu.be/6PU4I7a4hq0
---
Any sort of mobs that drop greys and can be sold to the vendor. Look up the mobs hit table and what they drop/sell for and farm those. BONUS POINTS: if there mobs not used in a quest youll have much less competition.
---
On the other hand, look for mobs that sell reagents. Store them for a little while (assuming starting fresh server) and sell them when the servers lifecycle is a bit more developed. Check AH youll see the auction house mature and prises rise.
---
I have another video on my channel related to selling larval acid. Trust me when i tell you this, you will make a fucking KILLING doing this. Its worked on every private server i have been on.
---
https://youtu.be/TRRmHUTqRiA
---
They cant even confirm a release date yet and you want them to confirm future expacks? Really?!
---
No worries man, not everyone will feel like me. To be honest, with 4 other people you know, if you’re “good” you don’t even need a tank. For the first instances, bfd/gnomer/rfk/stockades/and below you don’t even need a tank, 4 dps and a healer can do it.
---
Thats what i was talking about with a friend yesterday, i would like to know if they will release more expansions after WoW classic comes out. Because there is a huge amount of people that want to play pure vanilla and some other want to see the next expansions!
---
Yeah I don't understand why people have trouble seeing why people hate CRBGs. They are literally the pvp version of LFG and LFR. Surely people wouldn't want them implemented just to "make the queue time better in off peak hours or in realms with population imbalance". CRBGs made everyone just gray anonymous mass in bgs and LFG and LFR made the same in pve. Both of them ruined the community feel and the last nail on the coffing was CR sharding.
---
Hi, /u/GimmeFuel21
---
I remember! It's the first and only time I applied and got declined for a credit card lol. I was 18 at the time with no credit history.
---
Melkor was already taken so I rolled an undead mage named Nelkor.
---
I’ll be aiming for the server with a decent balanced population, if that is a visible stat on launch. 
---
Nice assumptions though, bub.
---
How can you not? I thought the point of Classic was for people to be able and play Vanilla. That's why Vanilla private servers were so popular. 
---
Since when has the release of Classic become a nostalgia ride where people now want to relieve expansion re-releases? I thought it's about having Vanilla access, nostalgia is just a bonus. 
---
This is the kind of indecisiveness that leads to crappy content. 
---
Am I the only one who views Classic as the re-release of Vanilla for the sake of Vanilla gameplay, and not solely for a nostalgia joyride that will require another "fix" in the form of expansion re-releases?
---
Me, I created a Tauren druid because I loved that part of the trailer where the Tauren blows the dust into the wind
---
Have you read my post?
---
I want them to confirm that Classic will remain Classic regardless of their expansion plans. Can you not see the nuance?
---
For sure and I’ll totally watch every one of these you put out. Maybe you could consider the whole human region of Elwynn/Westfall/Redridge/Duskwood as one kingdom, but each zone is different in aesthetic. Darkshore may as well be as painful to run across as Barrens though, for what it’s worth. Gotta be a longer run from tip to tip than Barrens.
---
The TCG items started in TBC.
---
Can you block attacks if you have a shield equipped but its on your character's back? (not in fighting pose).
---
Uh actually...Weird Al haha I had bought The Ultimate Video Collection shortly after WoW and constantly had it playing on repeat on my tv while I did quests in Classic https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Weird_Al%22_Yankovic:_The_Ultimate_Video_Collection
---
No your argument is for a museum piece. An exact replica of Vanilla, that is not coming your way and does not exist. Period. 
---
Vanillas time has passed, and the game played on Private servers is far different to the one played 14 years prior. If you wish to play a museum piece then I suggest finding a dead server, using the zero knowledge of what we know now, and playing it out as it was, because what is coming is far from that. 
---
Yes, acting like a Nazi is a saying. Where overwhelming numbers of cult like people seemingly overwhelm alternative opinions because it doesn't fit the criteria of what they want. 
---
The control of the old and new models is in a toggle. You can't have any more control that being able to turn them off, clearly your not understanding the point. People want the option, give them the option. If they choose to keep the old models, they just check it in interface and crack on. Again I'm not reiterating MY point.
---
No, again, more to the point, I'm not asking for answers regarding expansions. I'm asking for an answer regarding Classic's future, if such a thing as an expansion re-release will take place. Will Classic remain unchanged? Or will we get into a giant 15-years hamster ball again and again? 
---
Regardless of their expansion plans (which it's too early to tell) they should know what Classic is all about. Is it Vanilla, purely, or is it about a nostalgia vector that will potentially change with expacs.
---
druids arent a healer they are flag runners so i dunno what you mean. 
---
between shaman and druid, in terms of their healing capabilities in pvp, they arent even close. though druid as a class is more dynamic and "fun" you can say, but they really underwhelming in  pvp as a healer. 
---
no matter how cool your class is, if you have a healer mentality in you head, the most important thing is to heal good, its not fun to be weak and being unable to deliver a heal in time and keep ppl up you know. its rather very frustrating.
---
no fast cast heal is completely detrimental, and hots don't do much.
---
ofc, you can fuck around with druid and heal here and there. but if you for real want to play a pvp healer and heal ppl play one of 3 classes priest, paladin, shaman. druids in vanilla is a wierd support class, they aren't really a healers. no premade run a druid healer. and even in random bgs you rarely see one, if its not some clueless person.
---
as for shamans, purely restor spec, i would say its particulary fun. you server as wf bit, and constantly need to take care of it, and as for heals its just direct cast heals. you don't really have cc, rather than slows. druids either though.
---
Maybe because they don't know how successful classic will be?
---
If it doesn't turn out as popular as a lot of us are hoping it will be, do you really think they will invest more money into re-releasing expacks?
---
But the people who are still leveling don't have much gold. I'd much rather be an ammo, reagent and potion vendor in blackrock mountain.
---
Distract to make sure it lands. Gouge nastiest one hitting you and head back to tank - sprint/evasion/vanish if needed.
---
TIL: 50 shades of gray was inspired by a WoW zone.
---
The only thing that has kept the private server community strong is constant resets or "fresh" servers. I'm not sure what you're expected Blizzard to do different; eventually the servers just die off on their own.
---
They can't possibly provide an answer for you because those options haven't been explored. They need to see how classic performs *first* before figuring out what happens next.
---
It's basically a rectangle with grids. It's a bit confusing initially but it's not, like, Boston.
---
What are you raging for?
---
Yep. I still have mine. The account is canceled but I still have the card.
---
You get improved stealth and higher base agi as NE but humans are superior. If you care about minmax go human or you will regret it.
---
Look at this badass group and then imagine playing alliance.
---
Unpopular opinion: Desolace is underrated. I love the green putrid splotches, the buzzards that see me from across the map and kill me, and the Kodo graveyard ganking.
---
I think ideally they would have single server on balanced servers +/-10%, and then cross realm unbalanced servers with other unbalanced servers.
---
It's not a belief its literally a fact. Fire loses a ton of DPS on all bosses due to fire resist and frost loses none. You also have to cast 3s frostbolts on Geddon and Rag which are arguably the 2 most important DPS dumps in MC.
---
I played classic until TBC. P servers up until today.
---
I found a group of guys, but they are located on the east coast. Their raids are like 8pm-12am our time, which I like.
---
I’m in Oregon though
---
Sounds like you are gonna be either night elf or a rogue. Shadowmeld is perfect for that
---
&gt; Another thing is: is there a side which is more likely to be overpopulated hunter-wise, especially on a pvp realm? I would guess alliance in general, just because "legolas"
---
You answered your question yourself. Alliance has a buttload of hunters because of the legolas syndrom. As well as a terrible reputation for that same reason. You'll also get ganked a lot just for being another "fem nelf hunter", it's kind of a tradition ^and ^usually ^an ^easy ^kill. :^)
---
According to [the results of this poll](https://i.imgur.com/IwuJuGY.png), Alliance has more hunters.
---
The music, the snow, the feelings when that nelf switched into cat. Take me back in time and hold me
---
You want clarity:
---
If WoW Classic is successful for a few years, they will release a classic TBC.
---
If WoW Classic is a flop, don’t count on it.
---
Common sense, bro!
---
Their only plan right now is to release the game.
---
I'm sure they have given a lot of thought on how to handle expacks, but it's fucking ridiculous to expect them to confirm how they're going to do it, when no one even knows if classic will be successful enough to warrant additional content.
---
You have ADD, don't you? Keep reading my post until you grasp it.
---
That’s actually a perfect time for use too, how do you guys communicate?  We haven’t played regularly since just after WotLK so we’re excited to get back into it
---
Weapon skill is absolutely bonkers in vanilla, Human rogues get +5 in swords/maces.
---
Lmfao you keep telling yourself that bro, and when you roll a paladin and go dps or tank dont be shocked when you're out dpsed in every situation (if they even bring you as ret) and picked last for any tanking situation.
---
Perfectly balanced.
---
Name 3 games you're excited to that aren't Classic WoW.
---
Who decides the price then?
---
To be honest I'm not really seeing any of this. This subreddit has been pretty civil, for the most part. Seems like this post is trying to stoke a fire that doesn't exist...
---
dont vanish, removes the sap
---
To be totally honest, I'd say a good 75% of my playtime in Vanilla was on an UD rogue.  It was my main all through Vanilla, BC, and Wrath.  It's the class I know the best, so it's more of a comfort pick.  However I've been messing around with a shaman because I've never maxed one, and I forgot how cool their class quests were - plus getting into dungeons as you level is super easy because you can heal in any spec pretty much.  tl;dr, I haven't decided yet! haha
---
If you have the 25% damage from the talents it will be doing more? The increased damage from the talent is not reflected on the wand itself.
---
building a PC is pretty simple. Its not like you can put a CPU in backwards or upside down, they have guides and notched corners to show you exactly how to place it into the mobo. can only put a GPU in 1 way, RAM is pretty easy to figure out. Just read and watch videos, its easier than you think
---
If you time it correctly, slam won't eat into your auto attack timer, and you can get off a mortal strike or whirlwind as well if your weapon is slow enough.
---
not for hunters... lmao these people
---
I recommend leveling as not holy, haha. Either ret or prot spec. You can still heal dungeons with an intelligence armor set. It's feasible to have some points in holy for the base level stuff like resistance to pushback, etc.
---
Also as a paladin in general, you are greet at making friends. Take advantage of thwt by grouping up with whoever you can when leveling in the open world. Just ask general chat, list your quest, and go play. 
---
That gameplay of buffing, swinging your hammer a few times, tossing out a heal and swinging some more, is kind of the original intended gameplay for the class, and best realized in dungeons and open world.
---
Not sure tbh. It's actually very interesting though. I suspect it has something to do with them not being able or willing to devote as much time and effort, but at the same time they're going to be salty when they get shit on by someone who is hardcore and geared to the teeth.
---
Where do you people find large groups of people that enjoy the same things like this. Wtf
---
Even if they do release TBC Classic, Vanilla will stay it’s own thing. Guaranteed. If not, we will be in this “we want Vanilla” cycle forever.
---
If you sort by New, you'll see plenty of posts that OP mentions, but they ***usually*** get downvoted to hell
---
Both factions will be equally represented in all aspects. Don’t base the observations of this reddit as a true representation of what faction demographics will look like.
---
And why the words you say never apply to me and never happened to me at once?
---
Neither i was picked last for any tanking situation , neither i was out dpsed in every situation as Ret. 
---
This feels like we live in 2 different worlds, but the problem with your world is that you never experienced it , you just "assume" , while i have experienced it and speaking of pure experience.
---
I think they feel the rush and instant gratification mentality will become pervasive in classic and you'll get some ruining the experience through min/maxing. Truth is it was always there.
---
People can safely ignore how everyone else wants to play. I can play SMB and beat it without warps while the next guy speed runs it no prob. The game doesn't change because some dude wants to go fast.
---
Definitely. My wife and I have 2 kids, so I’ll be raiding when the kids are asleep, so it’s perfect.
---
https://discord.gg/yznz9W
---
We are a group of “hardcore” players but realize that time constraints are a thing since we’re not 16 years old anymore. We seek to maximize our raiding time by not messing around, so we want to experience content while being efficient. I’m a PvP guy but the guild will be on a PvE server, so people don’t get camped, thus wasting time and efficiency.
---
Agreed. Perception is not reality.
---
Lol
---
It’s decent, not sure I’d go with absolutely bonkers though.
---
Many good points made here, agree with the most of it except "you'll need to use distract". Distract can be useful in many situations, but I reckon it's much more important to practice how you move when in stealth. Practice, practice, practice. Practice the distance you need to have, and practice staying in their 180 degree back radius as much as possible. Regardless of how many stealth points you have, you will be spotted if your all up in their face.
---
We just had our first kid 2 months ago.  I feel you, I was pretty hardcore in my youth but with work and the family there are time commitments I have to stick to.
---
I’m a PvP guy myself.  Thanks for the link man 🤙🏻
---
I actually didn't see the trailer until the Classic announcement, so I didn't know what was happening until I got it from the crowd.
---
Blizzard would. 
---
Someone better at maths than me would be able to calculate the price of WoW gold without BFA'S inflation.
---
Saved.
---
Then I'm not sure you understand what it does.
---
Azshara needed a makeover though, there was not a lot of reason to go there in Vanilla unless you were low50s and looking for somewhere to grind out levels with minimal interaction with other players.
---
Most people aren’t aware that rogues need to spec into sap to make it viable for dungeons. If you don’t have the 90% increase you’re going to have a bad time. 
---
With distract though you should be able to land the sap with ease. Surviving the pull on the other hand is a different story.
---
They created instancing and then... didn't use it.
---
You’re not paying attention then
---

600 upvotes on this ridiculous thread?
---
And South of it is Don island. I think all it has is a bottle asking "what you don here?"
---
Not necessarily. Vanilla pservers are wildly more popular than any other and for a reason. I couldn't see other expansions being popular if the last decade of pserver pops was anything to go by.
---
Do gathering professions such as Herbalism, Skinning, and Mining give increases to stats such as Int for Herbalism, Agi for Skinning, or Str for Mining in Vanilla WoW? I haven't played WoW consistently for over 10 years now and I vaguely remember some professions giving stats in later expansions but I'm not sure if they were in Vanilla.
---
/castsequence spell1, spell2

Why would something you're never looking at not looking good impact your choices?

It sounds like you're saying that humor is subjective, and some people might find some literal "toilet humor" funny, while others not.

I'm going to record my experiences , create a story for my characters, with my first 1-60 experience I'm using zero add-ons 
---
also going full grind rush mode would burn me out
---
Its not an assumption, its the truth. They are shit tanks, 9/10 times will be picked last and that 1 time they are picked its because no other tank is available or they don't have a holy pally in the group and want your buff. Paladins are barely viable when they have full BiS items for prot... Next time to before you make a guide, make it decent along side with your mic. your mic sounds like you picked it out of the local dumpster.
---
TBH I think this goes both ways.
---
There are plenty of "casual" players despise the idea of min/maxing and you'll even see the occasional posts claiming that it is the wrong way to enjoy the game.
---
But then you also have the wannabe hardcore guys that will shit on anyone that doesn't follow a cookie cutter spec, even though it has no effect on them.
---
People on both sides seem to fail to understand that you can enjoy the game however you want, you just need to find people that share your view and let the other guys do their thing.
---
Every game has their hardcore players, just ignore people and play how you want to.
---
If people want to casually stroll through the game exploring every nook and cranny then good for them, the lore and locations are fantastic!
---
If people want to power level through to get to the end game raiding then that’s also great, it sets a bar and target for others, it makes the end game competitive and exciting.
---
Each to their own, I don’t even know how I’ll play, I guess cram every waking hour(where I’m not working, socialising and being a parent) into it.
---
I can’t wait! :D
---
Been awhile but don’t those abilities have decent cooldowns, as well as rng for revenge? Also sunder isn’t a damage ability and generates extra threat so it’s just needless threat generation for a dps to use instead of a mortal/heroic strike or slam or whatever else a dps warrior should be using for dps.
---
Well in Cata they completely replaced the entire Vanilla game design which was arguably better in terms of the immersion/world-like feel OP is talking about.
---
You get goosebumps very easy
---
nope
---
ye
---
Only because you decide to play that way , doesn't change the fact that Paladin is completely different than how you "Assume" it is.
---
Hi, /u/korasuma
---
I'm curious about this. In my experience though on a popular private server, I tended to kill mobs before sw:p wore off. Specifically if I was fighting a mob my level I would:
---
most damaging spell &gt; sw:p &gt; wand
---
And the mob usually died between 6 and 8 wands. Attack speed of 1.8 seconds * 6-8 attacks = 10.8 - 14.4 seconds. Since the baseline sw:p is I think 15 seconds (or at least 13 seconds) the increased duration of spell was irrelevant. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying fights *never* took longer than 15 seconds, but just that *most* mob kills for quests didn't. So the increased dps from the sw:p talent only helped *some* of the time, where as the wand specialization helped *all* of the time.
---
Just my experience though! I will note since it should be mentioned, the improved sw:p talent is very nice when you pull more than one mob, since you can throw it on both mobs, and by the time you get to the 2nd mob (especially if you need to heal to play it safe between mobs) it's nice to have had those extra 2 ticks on that 2nd mob.
---
It's copypasta
---
Yes. I want vanilla, not vanilla plus some new content created seventeen years later. The game holds up fine with the content it has; private servers have thrived by simply releasing a new one every so often. I'm certain the same will happen with Classic. Once Naxx is out, a new generation of realms will open and most people will be happy to move there because the first half of vanilla is the best one.
---
Besides, Naxx gear is already retardedly broken. Once it becomes commonplace, the game is basically dead. PvP turns to shit because anyone dies in two seconds. That's one of the reasons servers never remain popular once Naxx is out. When warriors run around with Might of Menethil, there's just no reason to even try to have meaningful PvP anymore. Adding additional tiers after T3 would make it even worse.
---
Also, it's quite likely that if Classic becomes a success, we'll eventually have TBC realms as well. There's very little wiggle room between Naxx gear and early TBC gear. You couldn't keep adding loot after Naxx without essentially making it as good as early TBC loot. That would be pretty weird.
---
Honestly, I don't get the obsession with wanting more content. Vanilla covers about two years of progression. Do you really need to keep a character longer than that? Isn't it better to start over with a new class at some point? I'm pretty sure that if you added a T3.5, almost nobody would play it. It would feel unauthentic and most people would have moved on by then anyway.
---
/shrug.  Still helpful at least.
---
Can’t wait for the Chuck Norris jokes
---
BRE has the potential to be trash bis for warriors depending on what classic armor values will be regardless of faction. It's definitely better on warriors than paladins though.
---
Overgeared or not, what's the point, is the question you're looking for then. 3 will always be slower than 5, in case you doubted.
---
So yeah as the other guy says, it's about fun. But hey, not everyone plays for the same reasons.
---
90% of all the pulls in dungeons will be facing your way.
---
Sure you can try to take the long way and waste everyone's time, or you can just use distract and move on with it.
---
It's not like distract will have any other use, nor does it have a long CD
---
Yes for hunters...
---
Only if the mob you sapped got tagged in combat, which it usually will.
---
I’m not going to waste my time trying to prove something. Those are just some of the most upvotes posts on this sub. They are examples, you don’t browse this sub enough if you don’t think there is toxicity towards hardcore mindsets
---
If WeakAuras is working I'm gonna jizz myself.
---
1 handed or 2 Handed, as long as i can hold it, its a Hunter weapon.
---
you can do that?
---
If you care about min/maxing roll human. Sword spec is a big DPS boost.
---
Which is originally from Big L, a deceased rapper
---
Within 2 weeks
---
Decide to play what way???  Did you even read what i put? That 9/10 isn't myself picking up paladins thats everyone... You're hyping prot paladin up so much and i can't wait for you to be very disappointed when you get almost 0 groups.
---
&gt;Possibly. Raids have a decent amount of items like Azuresong Mageblade that were buffed later (literally +40 spell on that btw). As well as Vis'kag that used to pretty close in gear level to the MH Dal'rend early on in vanilla.
---
It's a different adventure every time, guy.
---
Thanks me too.
---
both. tanks are most needed for 5 mans and stuff, but when it comes to raids most guilds already have their go-to MT and OT (usually GMs or officers or irl friends, ya know, trusted, reliable guild mates). so ye its both. super desired for 5 mans, but hard to get a raid spot.
---
I was always a big fan of Albis. [Rage of Angels](https://youtu.be/5m-GK33ZCw4) was amazing, and the [ending](https://youtu.be/RDp3UeCKHgw?t=585) of [Fire in the Sky](https://youtu.be/RDp3UeCKHgw) is ridiculously hype.
---
Eulogy 2: Wings for Hector is fantastic as well and contains the [greatest 1v1 world PvP battle in the history of WoW.](https://youtu.be/hMiapFdbxss?t=172)
---
I like my old, PvP movies, what can I say? \^\^
---
Imagine whipping that bad boi out at the bar to buy a girl a drink, panties would be dropping
---
&gt;a shield bash interrupting a spell will have the same threat as a shield bash on a non-casting mob.
---
I heard differently, that actually interrupting a spellcast generates slightly more threat. But that might be private server inaccuracy.
---
well you'll be gimped until they add the actual PvP into the game. It's not releasing with battlegrounds so you'll have to only WPvP for a bit. But once the BGs are out you can get good gear from PvP, you'll just have to get a good rank which takes some dedication.
---
Also our thought. We get more gold. Get more gear. Dont have to run back when a doofus hunter let's the pet run thru packs when jumping for speed. Evens out in my head in an efficiency sense and a fun sense. Really ain't losing out when I'm playin with my homies tho!
---
Atlas- so i can check loot and probably recount, omnibar, and maybe a few other small ones
---
There is no such thing as "Everyone" , if that "Everyone" was a "thing" as you try to say , i wouldn't be in the position to Main Tank and clear all Raids.
---
So obviously i am not only one Prot Paladin who has done Raids , even tho i am only one who cleared all Raids as MT Paladin , it says that your "Everyone" is just false statement. 
---
But even if that is the case where "Everyone" deny you because you are "Prot Paladin" , doesn't change the fact that Paladins are optimal and viable to play and able to Main Tank everything easy by doing twice more threats than Warrior Tanks!
---
I would assume. Might need a version that works for the client because o think they use legion client
---
I just don't see those as hostile posts. The first one is just a dude expressing his opinion on how to have the most fun. The second one is just some guy trying to be funny.
---
I don’t see it as a big deal banthok and savage glad chest are the worst offenders. And they both come from a dungeon you have to run a lot to get the drop and with how quick you can do it you’re limited by instances an hour. 
---
If you’re worried about killing rag too fast, well he will die week two regardless and that doesn’t leave a lot of time for no lifers to grind this arena event. 
---
Bre is like a 3% drop I’m not worried every alliance warrior will have one. 
---
I’m not worried about epic PvP gear. On retail the time between honor system and bwl was like a lil over two months. It takes 12 week minimum for r14, that’s hitting every week at standing 1. Tall order with no bgs. Say it does happen, phase 2 is 3 months, that’s 1 GM/HW per server. Further the weps were upgraded with bwl release (some additional weps were added in 1.9 like spellblade)
---
What does worry me is the blue PvP sets. There were two. The level 58 set and the level 60 set. I’ve been scouring over patch notes for the last 20 min and can’t find it, but I believe the 60 set came with 1.9. Since they are separate items, I hope blizzard releases them separately. If not, pure dps and most healers will be predominately incentivized for PvP as those blue sets trump a bunch of pve only gear setups of the era. 
---
If 60 sets come with phase 2, ranking towards 10 will feel very compelling. 
---
So following blizzards logic, we shouldn’t see level 60 PvP sets till later than phase 2, as they are different items than the 58 sets. We also shouldn’t see the additional r14 weapons till later either.
---
Yeah I still can make a good chunk of time to play games when I want to but my assumption is it will take me 4-6 months to level.
---
like 99% chance you'll tank 5 mans 1% chance you'll tank raids
---
Boomers can't go hardcore anymore because they don't have the time between working 60 hours a week and raising their wifes son.
---
Who are you??
---
When we had the blizzcon demo, one of the developers of a popular addon (I believe it was the WA guy or the ElvUI guy) wrote on twitter that the API was a total clusterfuck of a mix between modern and old.
---
If that's the case then it might take a bit more to get working... unfortunately
---
I don't think there is anything higher than the Death Ray that *doesn't* require Gnomish to use. For example, the Transporter and World Enlarger both require you to keep Gnomish in order to use them.
---
People are unreasonably resentful against people who are better at a game than they are.
---
Lazypig functionality is pretty awesome in Vanilla. An addon with QOL features like holding Shift to auto accept/complete quests and auto sell grey loot at vendors.
---
Here's a fear mouseover script.  You may need the SuperMacro addon for this to work:
---
&gt;/script SpellStopCasting()  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;/run if UnitExists("mouseover") and UnitCanAttack("player","mouseover") then TargetUnit("mouseover") CastSpellByName("Fear") TargetLastTarget() else CastSpellByName("Fear") end
---
bald-ass eyebrowless pennywise looking mfers
---
Part of it might be that for the early days of vanilla, there wasn't all that much competitveness, no real "rush to become first" mentality and no well known sites that ranked progress. World first 60? Word never really got out. World first Onyxia? Word never really got out. World first Ragnaros? That generated a little bit of gossip, as for awhile there were doubts that Ragnaros was even beatable; but even then it blew over. 
---
It was really toward the end of AQ40 that the "world-first kill" notion started to become important, with the ascent of Nihilum. And then it got more and more attention, until it seemingly took over many aspects of the game. So, while I'm not exactly seeing any toxicity, maybe there is a slight hope at least some of the adventurous spirit of vanilla will appear in classic, rather than everything being about getting something first.
---
Okay uh, Borderlands 3, Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order, Classic WoW
---
There are 9 classes with unique gameplay and 3 roles to fill. There is PVE and PVP content. There are quests for 2 factions. You can play this game forever if you are willing to reroll.
---
If you can't play retail it is unlikely you will be able to play Classic.
---
I guess it wasn't around in 02/03, but Blizzard's 'Screenshot of the day' was my favourite part of the vanilla WoW site. That was my OG check-the-internet-every-day feature.
---
Best PvP gear comes from raids, if anything, horde might have an even more active raiding scene
---
Thanks for making this list, it’s great to have multiple options
---
I have one and 8-12 PST would be ideal. Kid goes to bed at 7 so anytime after that works for me. Need a tank?
---
generally you want to stick to 2h weapons because SoR deals more damage based on weapon speed (slower weapons deal more holy damage)
---
having said that i literally just looted a green 1h mace on my level 10 paladin and it has 11-21 damage, 7.3 dps vs the white 2h mace i had with 6-10 damage, 2.6 dps. obviously im using the 1h lol.
---
How anyway can listen to anything but the original music in vanilla wow is beyond me :)
---
And you think it’s a lot cheaper than buying a complete from a manufacturer?
---
What? Are you saying I'm never looking at my characters?
---
You might think that if you’re trying to validate your argument. On the other side of the argument, the title is literally “don’t min-max the fun away” and the other is encouraging people to inconvenience hardcore players. The other one implies that playing competitively is low IQ
---
Yea... you're always looking somewhere else while playing.
---
&gt; None of the engineering items require a specific proficiency to use, only to craft.
---
This is not true. See the following items for examples:
---
 * [Ultrasafe Transporter: Gadgetzan](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18986)
---
 * [World Enlarger](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18660)
---
Probably not. The first day of summer is 6/21 and the last day is 9/23. They aren't charging for the base game it is just being included in a subscription so the marketing/shipping supply to stores/etc. won't be nearly the same as new expansions. This gives them more freedom to just drop it 1-2 months after announcing it.
---
human for alliance troll for horde
---
Just don't expect it to be easy while I compared your group to a 5 clueless people in vanilla they didn't have an easy time clearing the dungeon and you won't either, it will take a lot of time and won't be xp efficient in the slightest, if you take it as a novelty and run some dungeons just to see if you can that's fine but I don't think it will be a lot of fun after the first few maybe.
---
The feeling back then has since been impossible to replicate. I still cannot fathom how it could feel so overwhelmingly good. Holding my first copy of WoW and looking at the pictures inside the box, immediately sucked me into another realm.
---
It definitely blew my mind and made me so pumped for every cinematic from then on,.
---
Same boat man. Hardest decision for me. Definately playing rogue again, too much fun. I'll probably play horde though. I'll miss the atmosphere of the cities too much.
---
where is that thread? cant find it. is it really possible to clear all the raid content even naxx in just two days though?
---
Don't understand why are you guys so worked up about it.
---
I'm not denying the popularity of Fortnite. Believe me, I know how popular it is, I work in an IT shop and every kid want Fortnite preinstalled with their PCs.
---
I'm just saying what I know is a fact. Also, I don't think that's some "joe schmo" website, cause I remember clearly that their "2015 Inductees" was covered by IGN and Gamestop.
---
Exactly :)
---
No, you're the only one. You and all the other people who make this same thread three times a day.
---
if you take a 3.2 speed 2h axe with like +15 str over, lets say, a 2.7 polearm with +10 agi and +5 stam, you are a moron
---
Agreed lol.
---
I made my first character, an Undead Warlock, because I bought the collectors edition thinking that I'd have a super special lil diablo imp pet to do my bidding. Turns out it was cosmetic and you could summon it with any class. Ahh 12 y/o me.
---
I'm 95% sure they could not in vanilla.
---
Not correct
---
Just read the whole thing, super informative.  Really helps a tank understand what he is to do and why.
---
Go watch The Hobbit, that'll fix it.
---
Later expansions had benefits such as +crit for skinning, +stam for mining and an active +haste buff for herbalism. There were no such things in Vanilla.
---
Lol the people looking to rush to end game are in for a big disappointment.
---
Lol I remember I rolled a rogue and was wondering why I couldn't shoot my bow as fast as this hunter I saw ahaha
---
LOL what
---
No, PvP will be relatively even, RP / PVE servers will be vastly dominated by alliance.
---
Can you explain what WeakAuras does? I don't play retail.
---
I'm still bummed with the new Tauren model. The Tauren Shaman in that cinematic looked AMAZING, the in-game models (since WoD) look too "puppy-like". They don't appear tough or rugged, and certainly not imposing.
---
Most people don't care about hardcore vs casual. That said, Classic WoW forums etc seem to attract largely those of us with *very strong opinions* on the matter, so you might see a disproportionately high amount of vehement disagreement with any idea you post here or on the official forums or other classic forums.
---
Sometimes people who are quick to screech about "it's okay to play how you want" forget that playing hardcore falls under that umbrella, too. Sometimes it's just the other side of the "there's only *my* way to play" coin.
---
Doom Eternal
---
I think that Classic is a fine steak that is meant to be enjoyed slowly. You should savor every bite, chew it well, and let it nourish your body.
---
Someone who scarfs it down in 1 minute, forgoing taste for speed, will find themselves with indigestion, and wondering what all the hype was about.
---
you could also take the av wolf.
---
All of the addons will have to be backported anyway. The Classic client is forked from Legion and will have different patch offsets.
---
First and foremost I want a soul shard limiter addon like Necrosis, and secondly I want something like Questie.
---
Literally levelled a ret paladin while tabbed out during fights back in TBC and when I had a single monitor. Spent the majority of time in combat just listening to the fight while chatting on IRC.
---
WoW has some great options for grinding while barely paying attention.
---
you don't need wotf as a warrior, you have berserking which does pretty much the same thing + a healer who can dispel most shit anyway. orcs are garbo too, you wont notice the stun resist in pve and you cant use blood rage as a tank because it will kill you. also bis tank weapons are swords so you dont even benefit from axe spec.
---
tauren is better than both. stam bonus is always active and always benefitting you, war stomp is a great defensive. no better defensive ability than straight up stopping things from dealing damage to you.
---
troll is best for tps
---
I play runescape now. Maybe 2 hours a day if I'm lucky, but still able to hit major milestones, and I finally have what I can say is not a noob account. I expect wow will be the same way.
---
only zg and r11
---
He's asking because certain races can't ride certain mounts.
---
Oh that's unlucky
---
There are a couple companies that offer these options. Xotic offers lifetime support and some decent prices so I went with them.
---
Horde = better proximity to dungeons and best PVP racials
---
I’ve heard the horde have never actually fielded a full  raid in all 14.5 years of WoW... May or may not be hearsay.
---
You know, Being 20 with a joke job made it a hell of a lot easier to play.  Now with kids, career, and wife, I'm probably forced into casual.  Still pumped!
---
How good you are at wow is mostly based on how much time you put in, not how "skilled" you are wow is like baby mechanics it's not a hard game at all. Lmao private server heroes are clowns
---
Just tried it on mangos and it doesn't work.
---
GW2 UI. I like this UI overhaul, it's clean and simple.
---
To put it simply, it increase your dps by about 3%
---
Except the people who have been "scarfing it down in 1 minute" for literal years on private servers and they still love the game and are willing to do it all again once Classic comes out. Get your head out of your ass.
---
It should not, at least it didn’t in vanilla
---
i can literally go to sleep with this pic
---
so relaxing.
---
I kinda like this idea.
---
It would take Gold out of the Game without rly changing anything.
---
And WoW Classic Retail will have to way way to mutch Gold, considering all the farming places that wont be nerfed like they are on Retail.
---
If you guys haven’t see classicwow.live yet, they’re interactive map is really nice and polished.
---
Wrong. Some racial mounts (off the top of my head, raptors, Undead horses and mechanostriders, maybe some others as well) have restrictions on which race can ride them. The only mounts that have absolutely no restrictions on them are the instance mounts (ZG raptor/tiger and Rivendare's Deathcharger from Stratholme) since those aren't faction specific. PVP mounts are affected by the racial restrictions.
---
For example, taurens can't ride both raptors and warhorses. This includes the PVP mounts but not the ZG raptor.
---
*cries in rogue*
---
Progress is going to be slow. If you try to rush it then you may find yourself frustrated with the game. If you can adapt to the game's pace then you will have a much better time.
---
Especially considering the release cycle, this is a game that is meant to be played over months, if not years. Trying to conquer it in a month will lead to destitution.
---
Shouldn't everyone need on BoE?
---
well male orcs have the best 2h animations so
---
Haven’t noticed this at all.  Maybe you’re just too sensitive.  
---
Even if it were true, who the fuck cares? You do you and who gives a shit what some nerd on Reddit thinks about it?
---
Everything.
---
Tldr: 
---
Use sunder god damn it
---
They probably wouldn’t hold off on giving us the release date for very long after they know what it is. I’m sure they have a pretty good idea of when it’ll be but there’s no sense in telling us until it’s 100% since if they’re wrong there would be riots.
---
Star Citizen looks pretty amazing
---
It is true, the world is full of gluttons. I'm sad to hear that you prefer that to be the norm over a healthier option.
---
Oh btw. if u don't trust me, maybe u trust shedo. If u don't know shedo, then it's about time i guess. This guy is a Feral DPS GOD. Just look him out on twitch and watch the Video Underdogs of raiding #10 from the YouTuber hamsterwheel(u might know his popular "was naxxramas really that hard?" Video). After watching this videos there is no "i believe" anymore, these are clear facts, with proves, u see shedo being at the top of the damage Meter.. if u don't do that and still argue that Feral dps is shit i will never answer you back as that isn't worth my time.
---
Any one else that want's to seriously know more about Pally tank or Feral DPS can message me.
---
Why do you care at all?  Play how you want.  Why do you need random internet strangers to approve?
---
"Base AP" is naked AP + gear stats converted to AP but not AP from gear. So +Str and +Agi from gear, converted to AP in your character sheet, are included in "base AP". +AP from gear is not, it's a separate number in your character sheet (green number) and not counted in Blood Fury. It's a very good buff.
---
human is best for both tanking and dps tho, extra points for flexibility. but real talk nelf isnt that much worse. racials are negligible.
---
NEs have higher base Agi, which makes them ***slightly*** better if you're going daggers
---
But tbh the only race/class combo in vanilla that anyone will actually care about is dwarf priest. For all the other classes you can just roll whatever, so long as you know how to play your class you'll be fine.
---
He said for pvp you want a slow 2h.
---
You said no for hunters.
---
I said hunters want a slow 2h.
---
Hunters want a slow 2h.
---
This 100%.
---
Molten core and bwl to an extent isn’t very heal intensive, 21 deep in holy for Devine favour is more than enough to be a viable healer.
---
The hardcores are the reason classic wow is even happening. I doubt they care what casuals think
---
I shall be ganking. And raiding to get better ganking gear.
---
This does work.  That's amazing thank you.
---
A lot of it comes down to game knowledge. Take for example people who speed level - they know how to optimize their talents to level faster, they know all the quests like the back of their hands, they know what abilities to train and not to train, they know how best to play their class to maximize kill speed and minimize downtime, and the list goes on. This person is better at the game than somebody who blindly stumbles through it. The same applies to raiding. Somebody who knows what the fuck they're doing is generally considered better than somebody who can't put their shoes on the right feet. 
---
I find that people who have limited game knowledge and don't understand how their class works or how to optimize their gear or talents are resentful of people who know better. Why this is, I don't know for sure. Insecurity, maybe?
---
idk about that
---
keeping threat on hexer sucks because a bunch of your threat is reflective, bat spams silence, and being unable to taunt panther sucks too
---
They usually have an elistest mentality
---
People are always quick to chime in "why you aren't even looking at your character" as if character design wasn't a big part of character creation and a pillar of many RPGs.
---
None of the vanilla models bother me to the point that I literally can't play them. I've never been a fan of the vanilla graphics, not even in 2005 (it was a part of why I took so long to try it, I thought it was an outdated children's game). Character creation for me is more about overall ideas. I don't care about the muppet mouths or that female trolls don't blink for example. When I make a character it's usually based on lore, rather than racials or mechanics, or some other theme (i.e. this time around I'm going for a combination of lore and recreating characters from the cinematics).
---
I have *favorite* races that I think look best, but nothing I particularly loathe.
---
tl;dr I don't care for the vanilla graphics but I'm not playing for the graphics so it's no big deal. I get that graphics are a more important thing for some people, whether they're old or new, but in my case it isn't really a factor.
---
Okay. I never actually heard about these restrictions before.
---
aBSoLuTeLy bOnkErs
---
Idk much about the modern client, but....
---
Icehud 
---
Some kind of bartender 
---
Timestamps for chat
---
Enemy cast bars
---
Dumbest thing I've heard in some time. lol
---
No they cant, they can use blessing of protection, but that blocks only physical damage.
---
It allows you to create, use and share what's known as weakauras, which are basically small scripts that show icons/progress bars/whatever on screen, make sounds, use chat or whatever depending on a set of conditions defined from an (essentially) limitless set.
---
For instance, you have a warrior flair, lets say you're playing fury and you want to prevent capping on rage by using HS, but you still want to make sure to save rage for BT/WW, in that case you could set up a weak aura to show the HS icon whenever you're above 60 rage (or whatever number you pick).
---
Maybe next to that HS icon you could put a BT and a WW icon that show their remaining cooldowns and on the other side maybe an Overpower icon that lights up when it's usable.
---
And below those you could put 2 progress bars, one that shows your rage and one taht shows your battle shout timer.
---
And maybe if you're one of those guys that never notices you're getting hit by Geddon's bomb you could make it show a big-ass icon whenever you have it.
---
or you could be the "meme" guy who whenever Onyxia does a deep breath yells "She deep breaths more!"
---
There's a just some examples, and as I said the conditions are essentially limitless, everything an addon can react to WA can react to, certain things are complicated for sure, but all of the examples I named would be super easy to make, even for a beginner weakaura user.
---
The list is also wrong, since it lists **Goblin Sapper Charge** as craftable by both Gnomish and Goblin, but it is only craftable by Goblin. This is the most important item in Engineering PvE, so...
---
Well there is a ton of items in this list that get nerfed as well. Tons of Defense items for starters.
---
Yeah it’s pretty underwhelming but you’d might as well use it if you’re not expecting any healing 🤷‍♀️
---
At least it’s an on use that you can stack with other cd’s
---
Dude how lame is it that one of the things I'm most excited to do in Classic is set up my UI again.
---
It's more than that, but lets go with it, how is that *not* absolutely insane?
---
Druid is more defensive and self-sustainable than Shaman. You can control the battlefield easier (especially as Night Elf druid because Horde has only one defensive dispeller - Priest that can dispell your roots). Rogues will hate you due to the fact that they cannot use their core ability - stealth. On the other side, if you play as a Night Elf Resto Druid and you have a Shaman opposing you, you will not be able to heal much. His constant purge and interrupts are your doom. Your HoTs will be useless unless your team manages to kill him fast. Which should be their priority number one. Other than that, as a Druid, you have to be ACTIVE and pre-prepared for upcoming threats. As a Shaman, you have to be more REACTIVE and deal with the situation that has just happened. As a Shaman, you have to read the battlefield and know exactly what enemies and teammates you have around you and place your totems accordingly. Use Tremor if you and your teammates might get feared, use Windfury if you have a warrior nearby, use Grounding totem to mitigate a very dangerous spell and so on...Shaman is a much more offensive healer and you might find yourself doing more damage than healing. In that case, your mana will be depleted fast and you will not be able to do much. 
---
TL;DR  
---
If you enjoy running around, being an unstoppable force, pick a Druid. You can and will exhaust most of your enemies. As a Druid you can adapt to every situation. You can´t get polymorphed or slowed and you can get away from threats to last in a fight longer.
---
If you enjoy being right in the center of the fight doing damage, throwing wooden sticks with various effects around you and purge any beneficial spell that your opposition has, pick a Shaman. You will be more useful in an actual team fight but you are vulnerable to all forms of CC and you will be focused more.  
---
TL+DR extra
---
The fun aspect of a class is subjective. Pick what you enjoy more on a pserv.
---
Not a fact.
---
Sorry to disappoint.
---
There are flasks for increased magic damage when you have to frost bolt.
---
Sorry, been there, done that, beat those frost mages.
---
And really, *really* sorry, but frost mages on a private server dps?
---
Naw.
---
Why would you look at your character?
---
I think at this point in time, there are a lot of players that would love to be hardcore but their current lifestyle won’t allow it due to being an adult. For me personally, I played vanilla when I was in middle/high school so I had all the time in the world but now I have responsibilities that keep me from taking a month off and play as much as I can! I envy that. Maybe it’s just me but I have a hunch some of us casuals are jelly!
---
So basically it sounds like every buff/debuff, cooldown, +, +, + addon ever made, rolled in to one, and not a piece of crap?  
---
Can it track spell DR?
---
Right... except people in HC guilds can clear MC in less than 40 min, while the casuals will be stuck in there for 2+ hours with multiple wipes.
---
So not only do you spend less time raiding, you also don't need spend as much time farming consumables.
---
But please do tell me how wiping for multiple hours will make better at this game?
---
You see doc, this analogy assumes that enjoying the game by playing it optimally and being good at it is inherently bad by likening it to gluttony. That's not a very good way to have a discussion. Why don't you just accept that some people have fun by optimizing their gameplay and being cutting edge?
---
Because it's in front of me and I have eyes.
---
I rolled a priest but initially the warlock with the infernal looked awesome to me.
---
Lmao, you're never going to play without rested xp from like 15-60
---
Probably has to do with elitist twats who insult and berate a player for making a mistake in a 5man because it's their first time running the dungeon and then kicks them from party and tells their guild to never group with them.
---
No transmog in classic right...right..???? That picture just oozes vanilla cool.
---
ZG is harder than mc
---
&gt; So basically it sounds like every buff/debuff, cooldown, +, +, + addon ever made, rolled in to one, and not a piece of crap?
---
Pretty much.
---
&gt; Can it track spell DR?
---
You can definitely make it track DRs, the question is more how much work it will be.
---
Just chiming in to say, distract is pretty useful for patrols that are either in risk of aggroing mid fight, or to stop them and make it easier for the tank to pull without risk of aggroing other mobs
---
Has it been confirmed **by Blizzard** that sit to crit will not be a thing? I heard a rumor it won't be around although I vaguely remember it being a thing back then.
---
As someone that’s had a boner for the release of every wow expansion my loins tell me that it’ll be in some sort of classic wow live stream with ion since there are no relevant events coming up. 
---
Basing this purely on the fact that a forum post would be underwhelming and blizz likes to do stuff like this to hype shit up. None of us would give a fuck how they give us a release date but they’d probably do something like that for the normies.
---
Yes that’s true, but the amount of items nerfed don’t nearly make up for the rest that were buffed. Sure there is less def on some items but most tanks won’t and shouldn’t be aiming for def cap in MC anyway.
---
And those eyes should be used to look at other things.
---
I get pretty obsessive about addon tuning. I really hope WA is in Classic because it looks like fun to setup.
---
They did say that Classic will be authentically replicated, so long as hundreds of thousands of people play it, or even just ten. 
---
So I’d expect them to stick to their word on that, that. Even if BC and Wrath are offered, there is NO WAY it would ever effect your toons unless you decide to swap over, however they decide to make that transition. They can’t be that stupid to realize that’s agaibst the whole point of having Classic for once and for all.
---
Granted, I’d love that same sense of stability knowing their future plans, but they probably won’t utter a word about the future of Classic until after Naxx has been released. It’s just not good for hype and sales, I think. Plus, back in Vanilla, people quit trying to clear Naxx after BC was announced. So I hope they wait until 6-8 months of Naxx, and then announce BC, to arrive 10-12 months after Naxx launch, as well as a round of fresh servers. That’s my ideal, and what I think is most likely.
---
Are you me?
---
I'm getting back into Classic in the hope that they bring back TBC and eventually WotLK. I want to relive those years SO badly. They were some of the greatest years in my gaming hobby and I can't wait to hopefully go back and replay all that old content as it becomes relevant again.
---
I feel like it goes both ways. Casual players are also looked down upon by hardcore players. Hardcore players are baffled how someone can enjoy a slow leveling experience and immersion and all of that other RP nonsense.
---
Pretty much anything. If someone is a pally/shamy/druid that would be nice. Really you're going to plough through every quest in the game in a trio, even if it's something 'terrible' like 3 warriors or 3 rogues.
---
Warrior, rogue, and a healer, preferably priest, would be pretty good for all content, especially wpvp. Warrior will have a healer on them and could tank dungeons and elite mobs, and the rogue could be a nightmare in wpvp since the tank and healer will have all the attention
---
As much as I want to play hardcore, I have a wife and two kids.  Playing time comes sporadically.  I am going to tryhard like the rest of them but end up being a casual and having a lot of fun regardless.
---
Take with moderation in all things. If one is at an extreme end of a spectrum then it can be difficult if not impossible to see the other end clearly. If one cannot see the full measure by which growth is achieved then how can one move toward growth?
---
That was a lot shorter version of my post :P
---
Yeah il lvl as a Prot/Holy hybrid together with most likely a warlock , getting that Fire shield from imp, reckoning, no pushback healing, blessing of sanctuary.. mmmhmm juicy
---
I still have every issue ever printed in a box in my bedroom lol.
---
Did you get a rather intimate feeling in your pants about 45 minutes ago? If so, then yes, we are us.  
---
I was in the shower.
---
Why are you spouting a bunch of strange pseudo-philosophical mumbo jumbo instead of actually responding to what I said? I'm not at either end of the spectrum, really. I see myself as a very average player who goes maybe a few hours a day. I see bullshit coming from both sides but I definitely see more bullshit coming from the casual crowd.
---
Peak Blizzard
---
F
---
I didn't really like any of Cata. I forced myself to finish it as I still enjoyed my DK, but any Cata leveling for me was just a slog.
---
Is this going to be your first time playing classic?
---
I never see any behavior similar to that on this subreddit. All I see are casuals saying "le ELITISTS le RUINING our le FUN DDDDDDDDDDx stop and smell le ROSES and enjoy le GAME"
---
&gt; just expect it to be the slowest game you have ever played 
---
The FFXI player in me laughs
---
The Toontown player in me laughs
---
The Runescape player in me laughs
---
Honestly it's not THAT much slower compared to retail.
---
Post just to save map
---
One asks a question when one seeks an answer, but the answer one seeks is not always the answer to the question one asks. Where does all this anger come from, brother?
---
Alliance = better proximity to raids and best pve racials, arguably great pvp racials with stoneskin, shadowmeld, and escape artist.
---
Horde gets warchiefs blessing though, not sure alliance can get that world buff.
---
I keep seeing all these ‘best classic wow map I can find’ post.
---
Lemme find my first edition atlas book I still have somewhere. And my original 1.4 players guide.
---
Warrior, Paladin, Mage if alliance. Paladin can BoP the mage, BoF the warrior. Mage can provide food and water. Warrior does well when with a healer and someone else to peel for their healer.
---
Warrior, Priest, Warlock if horde. Warlock has good CC and steady damage. Priest can spec into shadow to increase the Warlocks damage. Horde don't have to worry about WoTF and Fearward can be dispelled in pvp(its overrated unless they are smart enough to  buff block) Warrior is good for MS.
---
You seem to be pretty familiar with all this. Do you play retail? If so, here's my question:  
---
Is there a pretty good way to simulate + pre-plan addons (not the settings files) in retail?  
---
Does the UI look roughly the same nowadays?  
---
Basically what I'm thinking is I'll get MoveAnything! and an art panel addon and then go pre-map my planned UI + elements in retail then screenshot it.  
---
When Classic comes around, I'll have a rough template of where I'm going to place each UI element. I would also be able to have contingency plans just in case certain addons don't make the cut.  
---
Thoughts?
---
The best raid teacher for me as a warrior in early TBC was Shattered Halls / Shattered Halls Heroic. That dungeon was deadly if you tried to ignore pack management and were lazy about managing threat.
---
Offer to buy stuff from people on COD never take it out of the mailbox so you have extra time to corner a market space.
---
At this point I think there probably is a good reason they haven't given a release date yet, but I sure hope thats not the case.
---
Animated Chain Necklace was ADDED in patch 1.4 therefore is not on this list, phase 1 items only in their 1.12 itemization
---
Casino operation is not a reportable offense?
---
Old school or normal? I have the itch to get back while I wait on classic
---
Im going to be somewhere between casual and semi-hardcore.  not really sure what that is.
---
Ill be playing a fair amount, though i wont be using optimal routes, etc.  Hoping to do plenty of dungeons while leveling up, and leveling professions as i can, etc.
---
I have no interest in being a cutting edge raider.  i do want to raid, but its going to be something like 6 hours per week (hoping for Tue/Thur 7ish to 10ish Central, maybe Sunday night sometimes).
---
Im too old, have too shitty of a memory, and already have a real job that requires way too much of my time and focus.  I dont need a second one.
---
be happy
---
attack the darkness
---
How can we survive
---
For raid access it about evens out. Alliance has Ironforge and Stormwind being very close to Blackrock Mountain for those raids and they have a boat straight to Dustwallow Marsh for Onyxia. It is a pain in the ass to grab your world buffs and head to those raids as Horde compared to Alliance. AQ is much closer to Horde cities and Naxxramas is right next to Undercity basically, so they have an easier time in later phases.
---
It seems possible yet potentially deadly to do it during the first reset (you’d need 7 days of 4 hours of sleep or less—that’s only 220 hours). You’d need 3 warriors with a semblance of tank gear at 60 within 6 days so you can push through the dungeon with 59-60 dps and 58 healers. 
---
You’d probably even want a bunch of hunters as your dps since they level so quick—they could then help boost the warriors
---
It was patched early in Vanilla and wasn't a thing in the demo.
---
So you sit you get crit but it doesn't proc anything.
---
I ran a casino operation a few months before TBC came out. I had zero issues whatsoever as long as the player was a "consenting" participant.
---
Boomers? Most Boomers are over 65 right now. You mean Gen-X?
---
A Boomer isn't just an age, it's a way of thinking.
---
Flasks provide a bonus to all magic damage, there is no "frost flask". Arcane/Greater arcane elixir is available from the get-go and adds to all magic damage. The only frost damage elixir comes out during the x-mas event and is only +15 frost damage.
---
A fire mage that is of equal competence to a frost mage will never win in MC DPS. Those p-server logs are to show I know how to play the class and fire loses in MC. An official blizz server will not change this.
---
How do rankers get gold to buy their consumables? the time spent farming the gold for it would take away from honor per hour right? Or do you get gold for completing wins? i have always wondered this.
---
Druid, warrior, and warlock
---
You'll have crazy sustain with druid being able to heal everyone, crazy ability to dot everything between warlock and druid, and crazy ability to tank everything the warlock pulls between warrior, bear form, and voidwalker. Between cleave and whirlwind warrior aoe isn't too shabby, especially when they don't have to worry about dying.
---
This being really effective would require all 3 players to be on the top of their game between warlock pulling wisely, druid managing man's between healing and shapechange, and warrior stance dancing and well times abilities.
---
I’m gonna take a hard break for 1-2 months before launch. I need my first experience to be like that first time back on Warcrack. 
---
I think there will be a mid July release and there would be threads saying “WTF BLIZZ I COULDNT GET TIME OFF!” because they didn’t offer 3+ months advance notice. But it’s silly to expect Blizzard cater to those 1% of people who are going to literally plan their life around a game, burn through its content, and likely unsub sooner. 
---
 No hate towards people doing that, but there’s already so many posts venting at Blizz about how their missing their deadlines to take time off. Like... relax, we’ll get a date soon, and if you can’t spend 10+ hrs a day on the first week of launch, you will be alright.
---
Yeah like probably mid40s itll become mor effort than it's worth. We are rolling priest, mage, warrior so I think we can whip some serious ass.
---
Oh. I honestly never heard that expression other than for a baby boomer. Got it.
---
Absolutely not. Dungeons blues don't stand a chance against T1 / T2 and rare pvp set don't stand a chance against T2+ either.
---
Thread title is fitting, this is the most detailed, well-marked map I've ever seen.  Anyone new to Classic should keep this as a reference, this one even has sub-areas that aren't even on the in game map.  Whoever made this needs a medal.
---
If anyone gets r14 before bwl, consider me impressed they earned it. Or they sat at a high traffic FP for 16hrs a day.
---
That is a great idea I didn't think about utilizing that system, as not many people used it. But, a few good relationships with some farmers might change that
---
If you do not have Improved Sap (18 points in Sub) then you should use Vanish immediately after sapping. If you do not vanish, and so have aggro from the other mobs, it will be more difficult for the Tank to pick up those mobs. Your healer will have to heal you, transferring the aggro to them, it will be a mess.
---
You may even want to inform your group that you do not have Improved Sap so that they can plan accordingly since you may not have Vanish on every Sap.
---
Got it, yeah, it looks like casinos are allowed but advertising them in public chat channels is not.
---
Burst with excitement then text my boss and put in my two weeks PTO.
---
In the editing in those videos is God-tier.
---
Been playing a Pserver lately and I’m honestly afraid to role on anything until everyone else has rolled because like everything is an upgrade. Intelligence, great more mana. Strength, cool better melee once in awhile. Agi is BIS, spirit is nice since I’m leveling. Feel like an asshole.
---
What does Necrosis do that the drain soul macro doesn't?
---
Garrote didn't even silence in Vanilla. It only had a silence from R7 upwards, and R7 Garrote was learned at level 61 in TBC.
---
This cinematic sold WoW for me and also influenced me to make a dwarf hunter as my first character
---
&gt; Is there a pretty good way to simulate + pre-plan addons
---
There probably isn't, best we can hope for is a beta and that addon developers will take the oppurtinity to create some for us (if it's as bad as I lead on in the other post).
---
&gt; Does the UI look roughly the same nowadays?
---
[Pretty much](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/701867.jpg), they (finally) changed the "buttom" part of the UI a tiny bit last expansion, but it's still roughly the same, and given that the classic client appears to be a fork from prior to then I'd expect the default UI to be near pretty to what we're used to from the 1.12.1 client.
---
Humans for PvE, gnomes for PVP. You see the choice is easy, stay horde :o
---
It really comes down to what you guys want to play (individually). With nothing in particular to go on, I would suggest Hunter, Mage, Priest - Hunters are the strongest class by far during leveling for both PvE and PvP; a mage brings lots of convenience with water and portals (you can follow the action more easily!) as well as an absurd amount of control and even damage in PvP; the priest can heal, the stamina buff is pretty big for world PvP, dispel is invaluable both offensively and defensively, the instant AoE fear and silence (talent) bring a lot to the table as well, not to mention steady mana-free damage with wands.
---
I'm guessing 14ish
---
You don't love it anymore? :(
---
It should be higher\~ I leave Teldrassil at 14. lol
---
Yes the heroics from BC really make you learn to be a better tank. I cut my teeth tanking in BC. My post was geared towards leveling dungeons where your tank gear doesn’t generate much rage so instead of spamming sunder it’s better to limit the amount of rage you spend so you have rage for the next pull or boss and can snap aggro. Going to 0 rage makes a pull significantly harder.
---
Rogue mage priest, all times favorite
---
I have similar opinions of Cata and MoP. The gameplay experience was like a neutered bastardized non rpg non mmo version of the original game, but some of the raids were good. I really enjoyed Blackrock Descent and Firelands, but I still don’t forgive Blizzard for making Dragon Soul... and then taking 180 bucks from every sub for a year, and create absolutely nothing out of it.
---
Dragon soul was when I really became disillusioned with Blizz. Like... there wasn’t a single new boss model aside from deathwing, the entire place was a copy paste of dragon blight, eye of eternity, and the old god caverns, and the gunship. LFR on top of that... Don’t even get me started on how shamefully dogshit the Deathwing fights were. It was legitimately cooler to get burned alive by Deathwing in Uldum than the entire two fights against him.
---
a lot cheaper? maybe... depends on what you're buying. One this is for certain though, if you buy from a manufacturer they will be using the CHEAPEST parts possible to maximize their profits. I've had both store bought computers, high end laptops and custom self built PCs. I like the results I get from building my own PC and being self reliant. Knowing how to build PCs is a very handy skill to have, even if its just doing basic stuff like swapping motherboards or installing RAM.
---
Hm. I think I can still do some effective planning with that.  
---
Next project!
---
Only the quests? Or grinding mobs until literally no experience as possible, in which case you take the maximum level difference between the mob and yourself that still offers you experience, you find the highest level of the highest grindable mob in all the zones, and that is your answer.
---
It's super shady shit that will make you plenty of enemies. So best use an alt, but on items that have high margins and low volume it's a very good way to control the market.
---
Another bad meme on the classic thread.
---
I don't know, my parents never had a whatever reason, it was always a very specific reason which I could know in advance and nullified that reason to keep the sub going. That's some chaotic neutral parenting going on over there.
---
What kind of shit are you doing to leave Teldrassil at 14 son?
---
sit to crit was always a thing and still is even in bfa, but those "forced crits" didnt proc on-crit abilities like enrage
---
You typically need to swap between barrens and silverpine or westfall and loch modan if you want to never have a quest drought. That continues through to level 60.
---
If you always go green and yellow quests and avoid doing orange and red ones and go between the 2-3 zones for your level you’ll never run out, except for 2, 3, 5 bars where it becomes advantageous for a speed run. 
---
That said, it really doesn’t make sense to go from Durotar to Mulgore and quest in both. All starting zones have enough quests to get you to level 11, 12 if you got unlucky on drops. 
---
But if you were dead set on it, late into level 13.
---
Every time this is posted, I go and check if they've fixed "Aralhi" to "Arathi" and the missing FP in Ratchet. Yet every time it isn't fixed.
---
Other than those, it looks good
---
Probably between 14 and 15. I usually bit 12-13 if I do everything in the first zone. I imagine I’d hit 14 doing the second one, and get close to nothing on the last.
---
Keep in mind, when you’re lower level, things turn gray a lot faster. So you’re only going to be getting a handful of green quests when you’re 14, and most of the mobs to kill will be hard green or gray. 
---
Personally, I’m kind of curious to see how far doing all of Darkshore, Westfall, Loch, and Redridge would get you.
---
Farming cloths and bags on Furbolgs. Turning in my quests later when mobs start to get grey. :)
---
This.
---
Got myself a laptop when I upgraded so I can game while my gf plays on her phone and ignores netflix in front her.
---
Saves me the headache of “you never want to spend time with me at night” bullshit.
---
You will outlevel the zones by 14 and 15. Maybe you can do a chain of grey quests for white items and get a green quest that gives a green item for the same slots you got in Teldrassil, but there just isn’t much to be gained. 
---
If your goal is to see all the zones, you’d be better off rolling multiple alts.
---
Well, eventually only the quests will give exp. If its mobs it's around 16. So i'm thinking doing all 3 zones might be around level 18... I'll test it out today. :)
---
Quick, time to blast another 'jealous girlfriend'.
---
Hopefully we get a whole new suite of addons. Ones that do what we want/can do for classic that utilize the bells and whistles of the new api. 
---
I’m excited to level my first character with no kids at all. But by phase 2, I expect better mods to be put for classic than we ever saw on retail or pservers.
---
Just a few minimal things to enhance the UI:
---
 * A way to move UI elements around the screen
---
 * A better quest tracker
---
 * Custom hotbars so that I can arrange them in a way that better matches my hotkey layout.
---
Oh absolutely! We’re the silent majority. And I can’t wait to get into a guild and just be social and run instances and shoot the breeze.  (Incidentally I’m a Gen X Dad looking for a guild of gamers like myself! :)
---
Wanna join my guild?
---
Probably the same thing—but begs the question, does the macro work in bfa API?
---
[Paladin/Shaman/Priest/Druid]/[Mage/Warlock]/Warrior
---
Healer, Tank and QoL dps.
---
nah 100% of everyone is going to play this hardcore you’re the only one of millions
---
Honestly there's a good chance that's what I will do as well. I'm not a hardcore Raider, I'm not a level racer, and I would find enjoyable value in taking my time, doing all the content at level, never feeling underleveled for where I'm questing, and having plenty of profession materials and gold as I do all the content.
---
It is interesting to see retail players' attitudes. It would be cool to see a survey of active BFA players and see how many are interested and plan to play or just very casually check it out and how many think it's stupid and will crash and burn.
---
I should know better than to speak in absolutes on this forum I guess.
---
Boring? Compared to retail? Lol.
---
IMO if you can handle the extra 2 players you will be in a prime-position to quickly spam dungeons whenever you want to. LF2DPS (Any Dungeon) will fill up pretty quickly while leveling and you can dictate the speed of the run with your tank / heal combo. 
---
If you had a Warlock in the group you could also make it faster by being ready at the instance while spamming LFG
---
Am i the only one who would love if the game would be mirrored, other items would drop and different quest would appear so all the elitist guys would suck the same like the people who never played before to achieve the perfect vanilla vibe.
---
"Twice more threat than warrior tanks" Maybe if the warrior had 0 gear on.
---
Everyone’s a critic.
---
I mean you aren't wrong, but still rolling need over a warrior for a weapon with either no stats or str is kind of a dick move.
---
I would put it up there with melee rolling on a clear ranged weapon upgrade for a hunter, etc.
---
I'm sure there are some exceptions, but in a total pug run, that's a dick move.
---
I say this as someone who is likely playing a hunter...
---
Ironman, captain America, Loki
---
The fact this exists is awesome
---
Didn't they confirm that they are still not sure whether to do a tbc or not, but they did say if they did you would have the option to stick vanilla or progress with it?
---
I’ve always been someone who doesn’t use the package ui’s like elvui for example. 
---
I spent hours fiddling around with discord uf, and action bars in classic figuring out layout and keybinds. I’d make layouts on my school notebooks and list out my binds as I’d iterate through during biology class. 
---
I still keep the same binds in my main to this day, with retail additions and subtractions. 
---
I’m quite excited to play a new class, set new binds, and have a new addon to build my ui around.
---
I can see that being very fun. There's probably not much point for a druid to do anything in bear or cat with a warrior and warlock rounding up and killing everything in range, just throw heals and drink. Probably rank 1 MF tagging more things for them to kill would be the best use of your time.
---
How else should people take it?
---
Peggle
---
Didn't you see the forums after classic was announced? It's good for a laugh at least.
---
Well pack it up boys its all over. I can't believe I forgot how boring classic going to be.
---
[Retail players when it's been 5 seconds since they've made a post about how Classic sucks](https://i.imgur.com/n08A8NO.jpg)
---
the drain soul macro has no smarts, every time you press the button it deletes a soul shard.
---
Necrosis had many functions but one of the best things about it is that you could set a limit to how many soul shards you'd keep in your inventory. Also you could choose which bags to put them in as well.
---
Thank you for the details. That's a bit reassuring.
---
And like I mentioned somewhere in the thread here, I'm fine with the possibility of other expansions being launched. I know it may sound weird for many players since this is an MMORPG after all, but I'm in a situation where I would rather stick to Classic even after the playerbase declines. I'm sure there will always be a core Classic community even if BC would launch separately. Even if it's just those ten people :P
---
Yup, doubt I will do a single endgame dungeon or raid, just want the old world back to level in and shoot the shit.
---
they really dont
---
if you are prioritizing melee weapon speed over ranged stats you're doing it wrong
---
More tank = more spank!
---
Replace a druid with Shaman for earthbind totem kiting
---
Flight path in UnGoro (up north) is missing? 
---
Or have I been jaded by Private Servers.
---
DAE le gem?
---
I could be wrong, but I think on retail it automatically adjusts based on supply vs demand. So for example if no one is buying them, then the price goes down so more people buy them until equilibrium is reached.
---
This intro is one of the greatest intros/trailers for any game
---
How do you plan to advertise your casino services if you can't use public chat? Isn't that a defacto ban?
---
&gt;raptor strike never gets used in pvp
---
Exactly, and OP suggests an infinite supply version
---
Probably 3 Frost Mages.
---
The only statistical Analysis that anyone could come up with between horde and alliance was horde favourite PVP over alliance having 3 times as much pvp in world experience than alliance.
---
If you’re interested in being a quest completionist, completing every quest in all zones at the appropriate level before they turn gray, then you may find my Alliance Quest Completionist guide useful:
---
https://shadowpanther.net
---
You can report low effort troll shit like this by the way.
---
Also, note that contrary to popular opinion here, that was soundly downvoted by r/wow. The general populace there is just as sick of idiotic classic bashing as the general populace here.
---
Tbh the extremists in both the Retail and Classic community are retarded. Two very loud minorities. 
---
Meanwhile, here we are. Us normal people. Just playing Retail or Classic because different strokes for different folks.
---
They did? I am not aware of this - hence this thread - but would really like to see the original post/video, whatever form the statement/confirmation came in.
---
I think you meant to say 1% crit every 20 agility (though Warrior only needs 19)
---
lmao where are you guys getting this info from
---
a weapon with the right stats is going to benefit you way more than a slow 2h in pvp
---
am i right in understanding you morons would choose [The Nicker](https://classicdb.ch/?item=13285) over [Ashkandi](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19364) simply because The Nicker is slower? for a hunter? big lol
---
Thank you for the offer and while I am not currently committed to a guild, I am refraining from joining a guild until the game comes out. I enjoy joining guilds based on my experiences with people in-game.
---
I dont know why there is progression for the horde... they all just die any ways.
---
It's important to note that the linked post isn't the "retail players view". It was downvoted by almost everyone that viewed it. Attributing that opinion to a lot of people would be pretty out to lunch.
---
I found that putting players in a unique location and using /say rather than public chat worked best. Classic was great because player curiosity was still there. Gamblers felt like they stumbled upon a rare encounter and were told to keep things "secret". Low-traffic areas in high player density zones were the key.
---
Oddworld Soulstorm, MCC on PC, those are the only 2 really.
---
I'm saying that one is on me. People should take it exactly the way they do.
---
I don't use any of the art replacement addons. I actually like Blizzard's player/target/group frame art, along with the frame art of the ability bars.  
---
The thing I primarily search for in an addon is functionality. My UI always ends up being a very well organized set of information while still using the default Blizzard art.  
---
The most important addon I can possibly use is MoveAnything! due to how badly the default Blizzard UI is arranged (frames being so far away from debuffs/buffs for example is really bad design)  
---
I just watched a 35 minute video on WeakAuras and I must say I'm super pumped to play with addons for Classic.  
---
I'm probably going to make a mock UI on a trial character in retail just to get an idea of what my goals will be with the UI.
---
I'll still definitely be shitposting [The Blackrock Slicer] all the time. Everyone who knows the context will get it.
---
Yikes. Bet he never even played classic
---
10 out of 10 lame
---
Pretty sure Shattered Halls HC had the biggest packs out of the 5-mans, and in BC warriors were the lower tier in terms of multi-mob tanking.  
---
I played a druid tank so I could just LOLSwipe.
---
My man!
---
Either way you won't have much a hard time raiding since you need 40 ppl.
---
All this about having x amount of a class is a bit  dumb unless you are going for world first or something. Many ppl just follow the along without doing their own research, hunters are fairly decent too outside of just bringing utility. Feral druids are capable in raids and can beat rogues but require they a lot more effort and time. 
---
Classic is gonna suck for the sole reason that many ppl are struck on the idea that playing anything outside of x y and z is a waste of time, or that bringing them is pointless.
---
The person who would be playing the paladin.... Do they enjoy self harm?  
---
This really makes a difference for my answer.
---
But go check out the comments to see what is upvoted, it’s all stuff saying people will get bored of classic after a day or two.

Just starting out. I would hate to start char in a server with ET if I am in cali for example.
---
(I dont like California but for example purposes)
---
Another Crossfade/WoW fan!
---
Yup. I read the "don't min max your fun away"
---
Minmaxing **IS** my fun. So i posted as much... then moved on with my life.
---
There used to be a website mapwow that had a browsable map like this using Google map tech and minimap data.  It's not around any longer.  Is there another current site that is similar, or how was this map compiled?
---
Haha, the point is I wanted to play the game so damn bad I would roll on trial accounts just to get my fix
---
Oh, I assumed /say was also part of public chat. Does that mean you can stand on top of the ironforge bank mailbox and advertise your casino service?
---
Both! 
---
I play a paladin that just does healing in raids and dungeons and then play an undead rogue that just does bg's and world PvP. This way I get to to play the best or both worlds not only with both factions but both types of game play!
---
8
---
&gt; Their raids are like 8pm-12am our time, which I like.
---
If this raid group raids evenings best coast time on a PVE server, sign me up.
---
We have an MT and OT, but last I heard we need rogue mages and maybe a sprinkle more healers
---
I saw a hunter with Ravager equipped, once.

/facepalm

As a warrior I suppose your own individual concern would be if a party member is going to save your ass with a heal if you are dying horribly.
---
Yeah my want to play was waining after coming out of Elwynn feeling like a bad ass and getting wrecked in West Fall. It picked back up when I started getting used to my stride but it always stuck with me how fast you can fall behind when entering new zones in classic.
---
It’s tough to say, they should always beat warriors. Other than that, you CAN beat each of the other classes but you have to win through smart sustain. On top of that, the enemy HAS to choose to fight you. They can run away ar literally any time and you can’t stop them. Engineering can play a big part in your success as well. Use freedom wisely, not on a short slow, but for the bigger CC’s.
---
Same here!
---
I meant it wasnt a change as it was in vanilla so it's #nochanges.
---
Of course it changed things within vanilla. At the same time, though, only a select few servers benefitted from same-server BGs. There were a lot of servers that you just couldnt queue for bgs on because not only of server imbalance population wise, but also skill-wise.
---
If one side took pvp more seriously, they would just always win. And in vanilla, if one side takes it more seriously and wins more, they get better gear, and so they dominate more, and it snowballs to the point where BGs just aren't an option. With Battlegroups, it allows for better matchmaking for more even matches AND lower queue times so people who are on imbalanced servers can still queue for BGs and rank up and be competitive. It allowed for everyone to be able to play the game rather than a percentage of people having a better time while everyone else can't even play
---
“Make love not warcraft” my was trigger, I watched it with a bunch of friends at the age of 12 and we all went to the nearest gaming shop afterwards, they had 3 copies but there was 4 of us, a small war broke out over the last copy, great times...
---
I'd maybe be up for more battlegrounds, but then again, i can play arathi basin forever.
---
Some people think those modern conveniences killed the game
---
Really you're not going to need to kite anything as a group of 3. You'll just kill everything in range.
---
It's interesting, really. I've never seen so many people get so utterly disturbed by a videogame simply existing. The sheer number of "LOL GAME SUCKS ROSE TINTED GLASSES DEAD IN 2 MONTHS LOG IN FOR 10 MINUTES THEN QUIT WHEN YOU REMEMBER HOW BAD IT IS" and similar nonsense, is just mindblowing. I've never seen this level of doomsaying about an upcoming game.
---
Why do you have that opinion of him?
---
Yes, that would be public chat. That's a terrible spot. Again. the best places are those which are low-traffic, high-density. Most players last time gambled for the experience, then they came back, it's all on the down-low.
---
Those people will realize that they rolled on a server where the opposing faction all has higher level pvp gear and will just dominate the newer players and they will quit pvp because why wouldn't they?
---
I mean the shaman+priest are the dream combo for a warrior. You got the WF, dispel and heals. You couldn't really ask for more. If I were you id choose shaman+priest 100%
---
Mage warlock and healer, probably shaman or priest
---
Its hella impressive but man not good for the body.
---
The board game? I've played it with people who were only slightly familiar with WoW and weren't big board game players and although stepping through the rules at the beginning takes a bit no one had an issues playing it.
---
I'm pretty sure thats how battlegroups worked. Some battlegroups were like 2-3 servers and some where like 15-20 servers.
---
PVP contract service. You will corpse camp and grief a player until completion date.
---
Loan servicing sounds interesting but how do you plan to enforce something like that? You will have no collateral?
---
This. I literally quit at Cataclysm because I’m an Alt-o-holic who really really enjoys going through the low level zones. Two things pissed me off about Cata. 1) they ruined the dungeons and the zones. 2) I would’ve freaking LOVED to run through the new content in the zones but low levels flew by so fast so they could get more and more players to end game content. True, this started earlier, but levelling was obscenely fast in Cata. 
---
I want to take my damned time in Classic. I want to check out all my old favorites. I’m excited for Sunken Temple, Zul Farrak, Scarlet Monestary. I’m freaking hyped to run old school Lower Blackrock Spire again!!!  I’m excited to find the less popular places to level. Desolace. Swamp of Sorrows. Feralas.
---
Then at that point they would just win trade.
---
I'm fairly certain they said sharding would be there for launch to mitigate the inevitable lag from everyone logging in, since there's not going to be many realms, and then they were going to completely disable it past that from there-on forward.
---
&gt; It isn't just a strong profession, but I think it fits the class as well. 
---
For sure. Make sure you get the Invisibility trinket so you can aimed shot people out of stealth!
---
TBC adds more content I would say but shadow of war adds more in the ways of quality of life changes by adding quests for those pesky blue independent type creatures that always seem to clog up the board.
---
This is what I miss about wow. Going from level 39 to 40 felt like such a big acomplishment! You weren't even close to end game, yet you could feel your power level and access to the world advance.
---
Nowadays with retail, and all the catch up systems, if you aren't playing in the latest patch of all why bother.... especially this expac....Was trying so hard to level a Kul Tiran mage and I'm finding no joy in it.
---
BTW anyone knows a cool game where I can play a Wizard until classic comes out and I can make my gnome mage? Was leveling in a private server but don't want to invest into it with classic just a few months away....
---
It only stops you from seeing people on the same server because the people on the other faction aren't queuing for bgs, which is what lead to battlegroups in the first place.
---
Check this Discord channel out. It’s how I found a guild that fits my raiding schedule with a newborn baby!
---

---
Lol stop. This shit ain’t gonna happen. If it does, they will lose 90% of the population.
---
As in, your parents making you do work, chores, etc. in return for paying for your sub?  
---
That's good parenting. :\~)

I've gotten addicted to ElvUI and Miks Scrolling Battle Text for looks.  Just some other core addons, like AtlasLoot, BossMods, etc.  to save me time looking up info.
---
I honestly plan on playing without addons for the first week or two.
---
got a link? If it's PVE server 8pm west coast time, I'll be the best damn healer / DPS you guys have seen.
---
Always WF
---
Did you play with them?
---
Yep, if it's the one I'm thinking of though, they aren't exactly doing things for profit, which imo kind of helps. The shadier ones  (Paymane, etc) that deserve to go to court over it are in Russia.
---
Osrs baby. It's great to go back to, totally different kind of game from wow but an amazing mmorpg. Add swiggens if you want, could help you out a bit.
---
There's more to faction imbalance than just population. If the population is 65-35 which would happen with the invites as guilds would want to get their entire guild in and i'm sure each invited friend probably has another friend which has another friend etc. 
---
If the side with 65% has 70% queuing for bgs while the side with 35% only has 20% of their faction queuing for bgs, that still leads to a huge imbalance which only gets bigger when one side gets more and more pvp gear and dominates harder which snowballs into one side not even bothering.
---
So you just want to start a group of people who are complete assholes and try and rip off the rest of the player base?
---
And you think this is a normal and cool idea? This is why the world is fucked in so many ways.
---
They were usually okay with me doing outside stuff like mowing the lawn and picking the apples for my sub, haha.
---
Hard to beat a hunter's utility in a group, 40yard pull range, high constant dps and a tank for the group. Priest doesn't contribute to much in a group unless they purposely leave killing blows for you.
---
I don't recall if anyone reached R14 before BWL in patch 1.6, but Blizzard made it easier to achieve after 1.8, so people may get it even faster than during Vanilla since we are starting with 1.12 mechanics.
---
I would only hope I could be in your guild for classic.
---
And if I would roll a mage.
---
Then again:  "not"
---
I never said there was a frost flask.  
---
You've never played my style, my build nor my knowledge of the class on how to keep that mana tank full.
---
But you do go on with your F1 frostbolts on a private server.
---
But you don't have the mobility of BOF. Personally, I think BOF still outweighs the benefits of WF.
