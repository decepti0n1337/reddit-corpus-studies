They'll still be there, just not having logged in in 5 weeks. :) Be impressed!
---
Finally someone that actually understands the situation. 
---
Yup. Obesity kills not only people.
---
Horde has the better individual pvp racials, however paladins make up for all of that + some in premade pvp. So sort of depends on how seriously you plan on taking pvp.
---
I think they've only said that they want to recreate the gameplay, not things like support staff and infrastructure.
---
Seems some people keep confusing pservers and Vanilla.
---
Activision sucks
---
As someone who played priest for thousands of hours in vanilla and capped out at r11, priests is not squishy, they're literally liquid. One touch and you're dead. Even if  you're rolling full r10, with bis off pieces, full buffs, a power word shield and renew, and single missed step that allows warrior to get within charge range, or a rogue to open on you and you're dead. Even if you play perfectly and fake cast potential interrupts, you'll still die because of pure damage, MS, or a reset by a rogue.
---

---
&gt; *Is it possible to duo the levelling instances in Classic at appropriate levels?* 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
No.
---
Was liking the idea of a 3ft tall, pink haired, relentless ganking machine but I guess I'm gonna roll a greenskinned shoulderboi ;)
---
Make sure you don want to have another factions mount though. If you find yourself only halfway through friendly at level 60 and you realise you want a kodo, you will spent thousands of gold for runecloth in order to buy your rep.

Please explain to me the value of creating a separate product within the same genre to appeal to people who are already giving Blizzard money.  
---
What does Blizzard gain by doing this?  
---
Level on mobs 2-4 levels below you as warrior as quest xp is just the same and killing them faster will amount to the same xp you would get by killing yellow ones.
---
Warrior can be quite a good leveler and benefits a lot more from healers than a hunter would. 
---
A warrior who can buddy up with a shaman is among the fastest.
---
I did the grind with a shaman from 1 to 60 and it took 6days for both of us.
---
A gm once teleported my bot character around a few times and emoted to him before issuing the ban hammer, I always enjoyed that lol.
---
Yeah it's hard work being a healer if melee have good gear, the only class that can stand up ok is a pally really, everyone else needs peels. I'd still say a properly specced disc/holy priest is a harder target for a rogue/warrior than a shamy or a druid. Shamans just cant get away. Druids are dead the second they get stunned not in bear form, and can't do anything useful while in bear form.
---
As a rule, I treat people nice and with consideration unless they prove themselves to be unworthy of it. So, mostly option A, unless the person in question does not (in my point of view) deserve the courtesy - e.g. because they are a cutthroat roller.
---
How about we discuss the fact that Blizz has never increased WoW’s monthly subscription fee?  And I guarantee you $15 today has significantly less purchasing power than it did in 2004.  They’re allowed to cut staff.
---
5% more hp could mean the difference between being able to take 2 hits vs 3, the trade off is +5 weapon skill on axes for a bit more  threat while the best tanking weapons will be alcors, tf, if.  If orc racial was +5 to swords ud have an argument, but axes, no way.  
---
Same. I just feel like a massive dick if I just replace the piece of gear I already got, because I've usually already put it on and now there's no way to give it to the other person.
---
Obviously trinkets/engineering/potions/fakecasting etc are what make good pvp players, I just want to crush people without HAVING to use all that :)
---
And seduce is also broken by WotF so can't even do sick soul fire 1 shots :(
---
By the time you have those weapons odds are you have the gear to swap on that extra 30 stam on fights you need it.
---
Fair fights are for duels and retail arenas, prepare yourself, it’s gonna be a fucking bloodbath.
---
the nef axe is good, ony axe is okay.  The thing u gotta think about is the trade off, 5%hp for +5 weapon skill on 2 weapons that will eventually be replaced with non axe weapons.  Does that make orc the best possible tanking option? nope
---
&gt; not going to play on a pvp server if the cap is more than 5k, been there done that and it's a complete shitshow every time  
---
Really? Because I was on one with 14k day one, 10k steady and it was just fine.  
---
*HARDY THEME PLAYS*

IT'S THE PARTY BROTHERS!!

---
It's totally up to you whether or not you choose min/max over racial preference. I am going with racial preference personally. I'll make up for it with practice and hope I can overcome it.  
---
Not only that but there's less PVE raid spot competition for Alliance warlocks.  
---
I think anyone who chooses a race for the min/max alone is doing themselves a disservice.  
---
That's noble of you.
---
I don't really have a code of ethics beyond don't gank greys, and don't corpse camp deliberately. Mostly I just /bow or /pat (sometimes /pray). If they're a dick though (or an Undead Rogue), /spit.
---
I highly doubt he even games, or ever has. 
---
alcors and if are  both avail right from the start and tf fairly early on in vanilla.  Ud be pretty stupid to go orc and assume it is the BEST tank just because u can use an axe for 5 weapon skill for like the first few months of the game.  by the time you hit progression raids in bwl/aq or naxx ur going to wish you had 5%hp if you are a dedicated tank.  
---
Ill say it again, the only reason you see orc tanks is because people are either forced into being dedicated tanks for their guild, or they wanted to go dps at first but changed their minds.  There is nothing wrong with orc MT or OT, but the number 1 choice is cow, hands down
---
[Level 25 druids](https://youtu.be/LMSrqrJs1CY?t=126) hate it when you pot in wPVP though. Especially if you're a level 17 hunter
---
Of course they can't come close to mages if you only use 2 warlocks, but 6 mages instead. It's insanely easy to keep the ignite up on bosses, while it's almost impossible to keep up improved shadow bolt the whole time with using only 2 warlocks in your raid. That's extremely ignorant and dumb from your side and stop the "oh they were good at theorycrafting"-bullshit, since you've not even tested 4 - 5 warlocks in your raid. You even went full retard and stacked 4 hunters in your slow ass and extremely bad 4HM kill.
---
Just buy the books used on eBay or Amazon. 
---
How come people chat with GMs? I’ve talked to one about accidentally deleting a. Hats yet, and getting stuck. That’s it. Ninja looting and shit like that doesn’t belong in a GMs hands. 
---
They need to make reporting people via web browser only. Make it sooo time consuming that people will only report if it’s very justified. 
---
GMs should deal with stuff relating to your character and account imo
---
Not wanna be that guy but nintendo closed factories in europe during that crisis resultin in 130+ lost jobs
---
Whats a good duo for a rogue for dual boxing?
---
Why are you assuming we never tested 3-4 warlocks in a raid? We did and we stopped doing it because it was lackluster. 
---
People care too much about it.
---
If you wanna let people of the opposite faction fish in peace, go for it.
---
If I can kill em, I'm killing em.
---
Unless they helped me.
---
Yeah, then maybe roll  the correct faction when you get your next chance instead of rolling shit that will be a huge issue for threat later in the game.
---
I’m in Chicago. Played on khadgar back in the day and ran into a few people from it’s top guild at an Internet cafe. Pretty Fucking dope experience. 
---
As little as possible, else you’ll lessen the experience
---
It's not remotely possible to duo instances without being 10+ levels over the intended level for the instance. No healer's mana can last long enough for a single DPS to win the fights no matter how well you play or how many consumables you use.
---
Tagging this for later. I was a tank in Classic with experience in every single boss fight from Onyxia to Sapphiron. (went back and cleared KT as a level7 70)
---
I hope to reroll a tank again, and will be playing out of mountain time. 
---
Being awful to regular people is the cornerstone of them losing 50% of their value.

Apparently there may be an actual cost to being awful money grabbing bastards.
---
One word: patience
---
 everything takes more time.
---
Seeing as this is a WoW sub, it would fit better with the Jaina template. This is the first I've seen of this one though, so I don't mind it :)
---
&gt;They need to make reporting people via web browser only. Make it sooo time consuming that people will only report if it’s very justified.
---
If only. Right-click report is the polar opposite of this.
---
You know he didn’t write TLJ?
---
I'm with you on this. And as has been said before on this topic, when Classic actually releases and we can have actual conversations based on reality, not just pservers and hearsay, I hope mods tighten the rules on shitposting.
---
*If* you had an issue, you knew that there was a human being, a *Game Master,* that was out there that would personally help you.
---
I've never watched a single WoW stream in my life.
---
I’m in the same boat. A lot of responses here saying only option A with friends, but I’ve found it’s a good way to make new friends/groups/guildies by being courteous with drops and not hoarding drops 
---
It's still a good base. Once we know exactly what the progression schedule is, and what items are actually out, then at least we can draw up more accurate BiS tables using existing ones.
---
Blizzard had communication problems even before they layed off 800 of there staff. Trying to get ANY information of them about Classic. Is like trying to get blood for a stone .
---
This. But if I’m lvl capped and won’t gain honor in the described situation, I usually just keep traveling; lowbies can fight each other, I got shit to do. 
---
Revenue is not profit
---
Maybe not an issue anymore with loot trading ;)
---
Oh the organizations that have been getting systematically dismantled for decades? Sure they’re more powerful than ever /s.
---
Sounds like we would work well in a group together! :)
---
Expect an older style RPG style. Older RPGs wouldn't give you exact details (most of the time) about what to do. Quests in Classic had no hub or indicators it merely stated what you had to do by reading the quest and sometimes they weren't the clearest but I strongly encourage you to use your noodle and figure them out without going to the internet all the time!
---
There's a huge level of satisfaction from solving the quests.
---
There's even objects in the world which start quests and they're not marked either. All in all, expect to have leveling be a part of the overall experience again. Leveling in modern wow is nothing more than a stepping stone. Leveling in classic is actually an achievement... Making it to 60 is not the shortest task.
---
Me being being a devils advocate to your devils advocate.  The meme did ask you to change his mind.
---
It's not final, but it is confirmed.  Pvp rewards are coming with BWL as discussed at blizzcon and in the blog posts.  They said they may make changes, but it is what the current plan is.
---
&gt; not going to get into the very disturbing psychology behind WHY some people really enjoy this  
---
Now why did you have to go and do that? DM me plz. Asking for a friend.  
---
There was nowhere like that on my server at least.  If you wanted 1v1s you would duel.
---
That last part hits too close to home
---
Wow great tips! 
---
How frequently do you think ??s kill lowbies? I avoid killing grey players unless I'm feeling particularly cruel 
---
&gt; In non PvP zones, or on PvE servers, be mindful of your AOEs. An enemy player can simply flag themselves and "accidentally" wander into it and now you're flagged and about to die.  
---
Fairly certain this isn't how this functions. Too lazy to cite sources.  
---
If they are flagged and you are not, then yes, your AOEs can flag you. 
---
That dude must have rodent dna
---
yeah, it's generally what experienced priest players tell beginners. "how do I get more survivability, what gear do I need?" "you don't. you're made out of wet paper."
---
you can compensate somewhat by learning a few tricks (say, how warriors tend to pommel if they don't have rage for MS, so you can just fake cast and waste their rage), but even then, priests are the most dangerous and most fragile fuckers in the game - everybody is going to gang up on you.
---
you don't win by surviving, you win by disrupting. and respawning. a lot.
---
The ONLY way WoW Classic will be AUTHENTIC
---
So you'll roll Forsaken?
---
Well, he did that.  Fortunate for us that Vanilla, TBC, and WotLK were created when developers were ecstatic to work for Blizzard.  Imagine the culture on the Mobile Diablo team.  
---
warrior+paladin is the ultimate world pvp duo at max level so its worth.
---
Not really. There's a ton of shit to play right now. Honestly I hope the game gets delayed until a major gaming drought.
---
Any hunter worth their salt will place their pet outside of taunt range using the wait command. 
---
Hunters win 1v1 against warriors 100% of the time, all the time. 
---
It depends. Far more ??s will ride on by then stop and kill you. And not all rogues are crazy lowbie gankers. Between levels 20-50 (once 50, kinda hard to claim you were ganked since you can't easily be one shot and you have a decent chance of escaping), expect to get ganked maybe once every 2 levels.
---
I imagine we’ll get the date very soon — likely in March.
---
My assumption all along has been a July release date.
---
Maximize every profit to satisfy greedy investors and throw away 800 people that has outlive their usefulness. Ah good ol' Capitalism. 
---
yeah cause uploading that to a website is so much easier than youtube
---
Actually, this is relevant.  The health and culture at Blizz has A LOT to do with how Classic will be handled.  
---
Rogues have high enough agi to dodge constantly even without evasion. "Don't pop evasion against warriors" is a dumb meme. 
---
So now you eat the overpowers AND the mortal strikes and autos. Good shit, you outskilled that warr! 
---
Walk up and ask if he wants help

#Conclusion
---
Doom's Edge beats the supposedly superior weapon Alcor's Sunrazor where two Warriors are tanking the same boss. Once we factor in proc rates of Windfury the discrepancy widens significantly.  
---
Since no other Warriors on the Horde faction have additional weapon skill, and there exist axes that are on par with swords all the way up to Naxxramas we can conclude that axes are viable tanking weapons.
---
:)

I’m actually surprised you didn’t respond to me lol.

Who said about WoW LoL
---
druids work just fine, just try to stay away from priests, especially shadow priests... they can basically shut you down. (dispelling HoTs, fearing, silence, mind control with DoTs ticking... it's not pretty). if you're alliance, you'll also gonna have to contend with shamans, who can similarly dispel your HoTs and shut spellcasting down.
---
paladins are nice and durable, with a few useful support skills, but as peaceful as they are, it's boring as fuck. priests and shamans, once again, can shut down most your support skills and fuck your casts up.
---
shamans are offensive healers, mostly going for an elemental/resto spec in classic pvp, they can hurt just as much as they heal. totems are useful in a premade, but since they're party-wide only, they're not as effective in pugs. they're also squishier than paladins and druids, and any skilled hunter/warlock will destroy your totems in a second. luckily, the former is not something that tends to... well, exist.
---
priests are the spanner in the works and a ridiculously fun and varied healer to play, but that comes at a price... you're squishy as hell. and since you can very realistically ruin the enemies' day, you're always gonna be the prime target. however, if you feel like not just healing but making your enemies bang their heads against the wall in frustration, there's nothing better than being a priest.
---
doesn't factor rage gained from taking damage, u clearly don't get it, but its fine u can be a subpar orc tank and experience vanilla 
---
Just dont. youll regret it.
---
dwarf paladin ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
---
hahah
---
Nice tips. Helpful reminders even to seasoned veterans.
---
I would also mention it can be very helpful to your sanity to keep a ‘safe toon’ as I like to call it. I play more than one class, so if STV is a bloodbath and I can’t get anything done I can always log into another character. Sometimes that even means just logging into my bank alt for a little while.
---
Now I know you're trolling.
---
Addons were around during Vanilla, and they they were not for the sole purpose of "gotta go fast".
---
Can 100% confirm this isn't the case in vanilla. You need to /pvp yourself before AoE can hit a player. They aren't "red" to you until you /pvp. (I played a lot of warlock in classic -- and on a PvE server)
---
But if you heal (even with aoe) someone on your faction that is flagged -- that *will* flag you.
---
Could be on a PVE or RP server as well if you want to avoid pvp altogether
---
Humans have no racials that benefit mages. If you care about racials then I would go for the following in PvP:
---
Gnome Mage (5% more int, Escape Artist, Engineering skill increased by 15)
---
Dwarf Priest (Fear Ward, Stoneform)
---
Dwarf Rogue (Stoneform)
---
All the other race/class combinations on Alliance are sadly inferior in PvP vs Horde. Alliance have the superior PvE racials while Horde have the superior PvP ones.
---
In retail, you can't trade a piece after you equip it.
---
After playing on private servers, I do worry that BGs while leveling won’t be very popular during classic. It’d be unfortunate as that was one of my favorite parts of leveling in classic the first time
---
It's from 3s to 1s cast time with Talents, which means its an easy Counterspell and its worth doing so as it's considered a Nature spell which means his Grounding and Earth Shock (his only interrupts), Heals and Chain Lightning will be locked, its game over for Shaman if they get locked.
---
Why would i play an ally rogue when orcs have 25% stun resistance? And i already stated i wont play a gnome.
---
As for dwarf spriest. Are they more effected by wotf then a mage? I chose human mage because i thought the benifit of being a mage outweighed any other issues
---
im not, if u actually played the game and did testing yourself u will find that 5% racial from tauren is the best option for a tank. I don't argue that weapon skill isn't good, it certainly is but when u go around telling people that tauren is a "noob trap" u clearly don't know what ur talking about
---
I'm not saying or implying that they don't. Very few businesses want to lay off people I'm sure, but I also imagine that, as Iwata seems to claim, that some companies more actively try to minimize it happening. 
---
The thing that people don't seem to get is vanilla isn't about skill the majority of the time. World pvp isn't meant to be fair and the classes aren't remotely balanced in any aspect of the game. The pvp system rewards chopping up pugs who go afk because they have no way of winning for weeks. The raiding has super simple mechanics and you can easily carry a ton of dead weight in the majority of the game.  
---
All of this is totally fine though because even though it's not balanced and it's not really about skill it's still a very enjoyable experience for most people. As the game advanced people wanted it to be more about skill so we got arenas and we got more complex raids with tons of mechanics and more difficult rotations, but we slowly lost everything that made vanilla great.  
---
I love vanilla WoW, but it's never fair and it's never balanced and that's just fine with me.
---
oh and I figured u just copy and pasted that whole post about alcors v s dooms edge which just goes to show what kind of player you are.  One of those guys who thinks he knows a lot about the game just because he reads stuff other people posted online instead of thinking and playing the game for himself
---
I wish this was talked about more in almost every entertainment industry. Nintendo may be a bit too strict with content creators and finicky with their IP's, but Nintendo - from the lowest of workers up to the CEO himself, care so deeply about their customers and simply creating the best possible games they can.
---
I have never once felt remorse for buying a Nintendo product, even if the game didn't live up to my expectations, at least I know the money is going to a company who always has and seemingly always will do whatever it takes to continue making fantastic products and creating a great work environment. 
---
Ideal height to Lay on Hands ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Nah, gnome mages really are much better than humans both in PvP and PvE. 5% more intellect and Escape Artist are too good to pass on. I had to mention it :P
---
Also, some of the things I said depend on what kind of PvP you would like to do. Solo or in a group?
---
I know gnomes are better but i wont play one. Your giving me useless advice. I like all kinds of pvp. Solo, world pvp, bg.
---
Hmmm. I could have sworn that enemy players who flagged themselves in neutral zones were yellow colored meaning that any form of damage you did to them resulted in an attack. I remember even accidentally melee hitting an enemy player and getting creamed by guards in gadgeton. 
---
It was shit for pc, may as well continue on with tradition. 
---
Mages are in no way affected by wotf btw. 
---
I don't think you realise what you're getting into mate and I tried explaining why I think you are wrong about human mages..
---
Meme doesn't really make sense. The people who got laid off were almost all administration side, and the development teams are being increased by 20%. If you're a developer working for Acti/Blizzard, you know that the executives feel like they need to kick content development into high gear. The people actually developing the titles are in demand; they aren't the ones in jeopardy of being laid off, in this scenario. 
---
Lolol
---
&gt; Don't leave a trail that points to you like an arrow. 
---
holy shit, this is giving me flashbacks. a trail of corpses was always as invitation to play the revenge game... catch them while fighting one of the mobs, even out the odds by fear/mind control so the whole pack gets a change to avenge their fallen brethren.
---
very solid tips all around. one more thing I'd like to add: if you get ganked by an equal level and manage to take 'em with you (priests, warlocks, anything that can DoT can do that easily), don't rez immediately when you get back to your corpse... wait for the enemy player, then surprise them. that extra health won't matter for shit if, say, a hunter shoots you in the back while you're drinking - but when he's feared and running in circles with DoTs ticking, you'll be glad you've waited.
---
Who are you talking to? Lol.
---
What im trying to say is. I will only play mage, dwarf or nelf. So whats the strongest pvp combination i could choose considering the horde racials i will be up against. Or are you saying horde racials are to powerful to roll a human mage or dwarf spreist
---
The former
---
Oh didn’t know that, good to know
---
I didn't interact with any GMs in my time spent playing WoW, so it wasn't part of my social experience. Does that mean I violated the game's social dynamic, or that your argument is flawed?
---
The answer is: Dwarf Rogue. And no, you will always be inferior to Horde if you PvP as Alliance. 
---
Or did you think nelfs can be mages in Classic? Because they can't..

**About**: EoT started on Bloodscalp shortly after vanilla wow’s release &amp; became a top guild on the server. We’ve persisted as a gaming family ever since. Our goal has always been to clear content as a team while providing a second family for our members.  Our leadership is experienced, skilled, and caring.  We've been around since the beginning and we're not quitting until we've farmed naxx enough to gear everyone :).  We look forward to developing a winning team of people you'd not only want to raid with, but would also like to meet in real life if the chance arose.  
---
For classic we will be a top guild &amp; clear Naxxramas. We have a solid core experienced through Naxx. Most of us have raided for years &amp; are ready to devour classic content. We run a DKP-guided loot council (attendance and contributions are measured and accounted for but there is no bidding). focused on awarding gear where it best serves raid progression &amp; best recognizes attendance, &amp; contribution to raid performance.
---
**What we expect**: We expect dedicated, skilled raiders who show up with consumes, proper gear, &amp; knowledge. We are team-focused so great performers are appreciated &amp; recognized, but divas who are unconcerned with the health of the entire raid team or overly self-interested are not tolerated. We are a diverse group of raiders worthy of individual respect &amp; the respect of everyone’s time.  Toxicity and drama stirring have no place in our guild.  
---
In short, be prepared, be knowledgeable, be on time, &amp; don’t be an A-hole.
---
**Raid Schedule**: Wed, Thur, Sun, 6 PM to 10 PM PST (GMT-8) (9pm – 1 AM EST) hard stops. Our guild has always been extremely active &amp; 20-mans, Onyxia, etc. will continue to be ran on non-core days. On most days, if you log in, you will find a good group of people to smash content with.
---
**Looking for**: Great people of all classes are strongly encouraged to apply; **specifically seeking: Shamans &amp; Resto Druids.** Core raid spots are earned through demonstrated competence &amp; dedication. This means that no core spots will be predetermined and certainly not before anyone's hit 60.
---
If you are interested in leadership roles within the guild please send me a whisper &amp; let’s chat.

Why do you say dwarf rogue when orcs have 25% stun resistance
---
Most players knew how to assign loot and thus never needed to interact significantly with GMs. 
---
&gt;So, I'm reading a lot about world PvP and what can be done to survive and enjoy yourself.
---
Play on a PVE server and engage in PVP when you feel like playing PVP.
---
Vanilla PvP is like rock, paper, scissors. You can't beat everything in every situation. 
---
Vanilla is unfair like that.
---
That is indeed a quite powerful racial. 
---
Meh
---
&gt;I don’t wanna roll a druid to find out I can only FC cause "thats what my class do."
---
You flag carry. That's what you do.
---
Warlock/Shaman isn't a bad combo at all.
---
You can dispel polymorph with fel hunter, blind/viper sting with totems or self cast, and you can protect your own buffs/consumables by prebuffing trashbuffs like detect invis and underwater breathing. 
---
You're both tanky, have high burst, mana drain, interrupts vs. casters, several ways to kite melee... it's a pretty strong combo honestly.
---
I understand. But i was under the impression as a human mage i still stand a good chance at beating a lot of horde no matter there race/class because mages are a top ass in pvp?
---
I'd enjoy either side :)
---
Lol holy shit dude you need to stop flipping out on everyone. The world isn’t out to get you, only when you act like this 
---
I'm from Decatur, and wouldn't mind some fellow Illinoisans joining us :)
---
As a min/maxer I'll just say that it would be a really, really bad idea to go human mage when gnomes are so much better. You will be good, yes, but you will never be as good as a gnome. 
---
Or go horde :p
---
If you want the one reply to this that matters.... 
---
What Blizzard wants, and what Activisions bullshit will allow are two different things.
---
We are getting Classic without dungeon finder and a cash shop. 
---
But hiring a bunch more GMs? Nope.
---
In order to have fun in wow i need to like looking at my toon. Thats why i cant play gnome or horde. So do u know the best race/class combo possible out of the races i like or what? Its a human mage right? And yes..i know gnomes are better.
---
this so much. i never talked to a GM except maybe when my character got stuck somewhere once. and the things like GMs summoning random mobs in cities or whatever never happened much after the first couple patches. by the time something like 1.12 came out GM stuff was very sanitized.
---
except it’s barely even english. read the first part of the post. it doesn’t even make sense. 
---
&gt; Thunderfury available fairly early
---
Rofl. You're lucky if you see one before naxx launches. It will happen, but probably not to you. 
---
Missouri here. So far most of the recruiting guilds for classic are all EST. Glad to finally see the CST representing themselves.
---
Try waiting on the FF7 remake.
---
Oh Damn I remember you guys and was even a member very briefly in my leveling days. http://warcraftrealms.com/charsheet/27342333
---
To anyone looking to join them. I can confirm they were a top guild on our server and were known to be a good bunch of people. 
---
&gt;Its a human mage right?
---
No. They can't get out of CCs like frost nova, slows, etc. A gnome can. They also do less damage than gnomes. You will also DEFINITELY want to have Eng in PvP. Gnomes are the best engineers..
---
Either you go dwarf rogue or dwarf priest. They are THE best class/race combinations on Alliance PvP wise. If you want to also do some PvE I would go dwarf priest though. Human rogues are better in PvE than dwarfs.
---
Ok so dwarf priest it is. But why do u say dwarf rogue when orcs have 25% stun resistance.
---
And again we have no idea how blizzard classic will calculate rage from taking damage. We can be pretty sure it won't be the overtuned nostalrius implementation though. 
---
I've always found it incredibly hard to believe that anyone could actually believe that an unrestrained free market was a good thing.  Even a basic understanding of how economies of scale and financial leverage work would inform a person pretty quickly that it's not the kind of economic state that would benefit, well, anyone except maybe the top fraction of a fraction of a percent of the wealthy.
---
You missed his point. If someone robs a bank, is their goal to traumatize and assault the innocent people working there? No, they want money. Same with corporations and pollution. They don't set out to fuck up the environment, their usage of the most cost effective means of production produces pollution as a byproduct and they only care when they are incentivized away from it by regulation. Unregulated capitalism = nobody uses eco fuels.
---
One of these days I'll turn the music back on.
---
If they were shorting their stock with every product they released and it worked, their stock would very rapidly be at zero.
---
This quest taught me how to charge in blow retaliation and flee in fear after collecting my quest item
---
You have a hard time against other casters- mainly locks and good spriests. You should demolish anything melee. 
---
Beaverton here! Massively hyped.
---
Outstanding.  What was your toon name?  In touch with anyone else from back then?
---
I've been hoping to find more and more of us old schoolers.  Ty so much for the vouch!  
---
wait... you were a warrior, he was a higher level mage, and... you killed him after he respawned? repeatedly?
---
yeah, if that's true, that particular mage was a fucking disgrace and *absolutely deserved to die*.
---
This.
---
You need major support around you / peels to keep them down or you are literally just dead.
---
My gut is saying mid August. Hoping I'm wrong and its May or June.
---
You'll learn to deal with them having WotF. It's not too difficult because it's only a 5 second duration. If it's an emergency you just use grenade, coil them, net-o-matic, tidal charm etc. on them during WotF to waste it.
---
There's lots of ways to deal with WotF. What's really annoying is that you don't have a lot of ways to deal with a Rogue as an Alliance Warlock compared to being an Orc. Orcs have 30% stun resistance (5% base, 25% from racial which stacks additively) which makes a Rogue's life a lot harder.
---
Horde for windfury totem
---
The BGs will be popular while you're leveling alts.  Sadly, it'll be 95% twinks, so you'll just get crushed by everyone and cost your faction every BG you enter.  So there's that. :P

---
If you are deciding between priest and mage, imo the bottom line is do you like to heal? 
---
If not, a mage will always out damage the priest. But the mage is strictly dps. Shadow is a fine and fun spec, but ransoms will not respond well to players who refuse to heal.
---
There are many other comparisons that could be made but that is the largest difference between the two classes. They both are strong casters in pvp.
---
I dont like to heal at all. If i roll a human mage do i stand a good chance against most horde regardless of racials
---
That was painful to watch. Funny parts, but damn lol.
---
Not going to lie, that bestiary, the dungeon companion, and the atlas were far more useful to me during my times on Nos/Ely/LH than i thought they would be.
---
Any kind of speed running requires skill.  Having your route planned out doesn't change the requirement for muscle memory and good reactions.  It's like saying chess doesn't require skill because it's all about memorizing moves and follow-ups.
---
All they did was blink and then frost bolt or try to run away. They could have countered me easily ofc but not every player you meet out in the world knows how to use their full kit.
---
This is categorically untrue. 
---
Alliance because if you get a hpally friend you are unkillable.
---
Use felhunter to dispel ccs from your paladin and he has cleanse/freedom/bop for you.
---
Pve sidenote salvation is really good for warlocks.
---
Would explain how he lives and thrives in a garbage heap habitat.
---
LOL, yeah. It’s a wreck.   The message comes out clearly though. 
---
You do know that Ythisens did not work on those games, right? He was a community manager, not a developer.
---
Yes of course. Racials are nice, but they don’t make or break pvp. As someone above mentioned mage isn’t affected by horde racials either.
---
I refuse to play gnome. And human has benefits of, 10% more rep and perception. Which if used correctly is a free kill on a dumb rogue.
---
If you don’t like to heal at all I strongly advise not playing a priest. Everyone loves a good mage, and as I mentioned hybrids who refuse to heal are frowned upon. 
---
If you’re brainstorming hard about class choice make a list and write pros and cons. Might help since you have a lot of time and it gives you something to do. Personally I’m maining a human lock, with a human mage alt. I’ve played them both at 60 and a priest. Priest was a blast to level but I wasn’t happy with the level cap experience.
---
So much this. Iwata was a brilliant programmer and a great man in general. Bobby kodick or whatever his name is and Activision can fucking suck it.
---
I was an Orc Hunter named Zodia back then.
---
I am in fact in contact with one of DPSs main Naxx tanks. I was raiding on retail a few months ago and we got a new offtank, who happened to overhear me in discord talking about DPS, he mentioned he was a main tank in naxx, he was recruited cross realm. He sent me his warcraftrelam proof at the time. 
---
That is the only person I still am in contact with to any amount. I remember a lot of names though from some of my old guidies in Storm over Azeroth. I also ran into a guy in WoD who recognized my hunters name from my brief stay in Warriors of Death. 
---
If memory serves EoT was one of 3 Naxx guilds on Horde side. DPS was one, I think Heavy hitters? or was it Harmonium? I frankly don't recall too many guilds. The 4 I remember 100% were the 3(EoT, Storm of Azeroth, and Warriors of Death) I was in, and DPS for being mad lads in Naxx. 
---
I would apply to join your guild, however this time I will be rolling Ally with a bunch of IRL friends. Time to see Vanilla from the other side. 
---
Sooner would of course be better. But I am always willing to wait more for polish. 
---
Me and a friend duod SM dungeons as spriest/lock.
---
Mind control/VW tank and double fears are amazing.
---
Would you say resto shamans is the most in demand class for a raid?
---
Can confirm I was the NPC nearby
---
Depends on the fight, on single target ignite doesn't do too much. 
---
But either way, ignite is not a spell you cast, it's applied by your pyroblasts, so they are still your main damaging spell. 
---
Yup. I for one keep forgetting this fact. The plan in my head while leveling up I keep planning on BGing for a bit at the top of a given bracket, but then remember they wont be in at release. 
---
We haven't been told as far as I know how long each of these stages will last. I suspect 6 months
---
Stage 1: Molten Core, Onyxia, Dire Maul, Kazzak, Azurgos
---
***Stage 2: Blackwing Lair, **Battlegrounds and PvP rewards**, Zul’Gurub***
---
Stage 3: Ahn’Qiraj (including opening event), Tier 0.5, Silithus content, Green Dragons
---
Stage 4: Naxxramas Raid, Scourge Invasion
---
I believe heavy hitters was alliance.  But you brought back some memories and you got the names right.  Thanks again.
---
Y'know, you could still join us😉.  You could play on our guild horde side on one server and another server on the alliance.  I know I can't swap to easy mode alliance now; we gotta finish what we started, lol. 
---
Either way, I wish you well and I hope you keep in touch.
---
Somebody just got owned, oh boy.
---
I wouldn't have an issue if they just said "Oh yeah btw classic doesn't have CS" if it prevented the automated stuff from getting added tbh, that \*is\* the reason they want fewer CS people.
---
Oh shit I think you're right. Damn hard to remember shit from 2005/06
---
I wish you well too!
---
Report him, then let my ally kill him as he DCs
---
Hey laddie, what'ja drinkin' ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
---
What makes u main a lock over a mage
---
It will take awhile for outrageous twinks to become common with like crusader enchants and stuff
---
*Direct attacks* will flag you, yeah. Like if you're tab targeting and accidentally hit someone. But AoE will not flag you. You would need to toggle PvP on before using psychic scream for it to actually work on an enemy player.
---
&gt;The best alternates are "old farts" who log on when they can, and dont care how many opportunities they have to join raids. You can never have too many of these. Unfortunately, the same traits that make them good alternates also usually make them un reliable.
---
There was a guy in my old guild who always got invited to raids because "Well he used to be good, and hasn't missed a raid in 8 years, I don't want to kick him after so much loyalty." The dude gemmed intellect after hunters got focus. The top 10 best in the guild left, sniped 15 of the best from others and got server first for everything after that.
---
That's the truth even if lots of people (here) deny it. Read this and get your shit together.
---
Don’t think I ever spoke to a GM my whole time playing WoW
---
Life isn't fair and neither is world PvP. 
---
The other week I was ganked by a 2 man roving gank squad just as I pulled the last mob I needed for a quest before I hit 51 and then was going to go work on getting my AV crossbow.  I was pissed.  This is felwood so I had a long run back.  So I rezed, got away from the gank area, healed up, and headed back to kill that last mob.  Gank squad killed me again.  This time I tried to run and ended being killed by mobs that use entangling roots and took durability loss when I got caught in a pack of them.
---
By now I was livied.  I was going to murder these motherfuckers.  I'd wait till they tried to gank someone else and nuke them down from behind.  So I rezed up, killed the mob I needed and went looking for them.  They'd left the area.  So I started attacking random alliance as revenge. Spent the next 30 minutes killing any alliance players I could find.
---
If they had the tech to do a lot of things, they would have. But Classic isn't what could have been, it is what was.
---
note on dwarf shadow priest: [desperate prayer](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Priest_racial_abilities), while a nice spell, drops you out of shadowform quicker than you could say "fuck me, I've just wasted 700 mana".
---
fear ward and stoneform are some really nice abilites though. however, unless you're alright with healing when the situation demands (only shit shadow priests aren't) and being made of out wet paper, stay away from shadow priest. priests are fucking wrecking balls of fun and have probably the most varied playstyle, but you generally have the survivability of a newborn amidst a pack of starving wolfs.
---
The strategy is to have all the rogues/druids on your server group up together and wipe out the enemy faction one by one, thus making it mostly safe for your own faction to level up and beat the game. I assume in this world there wouldn't be anyone crazy enough to plug into the system after learning how insane it would be, so eventually the other faction would run out of players. And bonus points if you never get seen killing people, so that the other faction can't do anything to counter it.
---
Nah just kidding, that would be messed up. But I guess it could be potentially better than a world where everyone just kills the other faction on sight.
---
Biggest reason is the pet. Now that I have a full understanding of classes, macros, etc I can fully utilize my pet. Back in vanilla I just kept it on defensive and ignored it. I stuck to the mage because it was simple. After playing mostly only mage until mid TBC, I want to main a warlock. Summoning noobs will be helpful too since I’m usually waiting at the dungeon.
---
I will still play a mage for the awesome aoe, but he will not be my first to 60 or to gear up. 
---
Do u think mage pvp is more noob friendly?
---
I've never not used a pot in world PvP.  I keep a stack of them at all times.  The only time I don't use them is duels, just due to costs.
---
I'm in the Chicago area. Couple of my friends here will be playing too.
---
You're using a made up definition of war haha
---
Yes mage is more noob friendly. They have very few keybinds, unlike a warlock or druid. I would call mage easy to learn difficult to master. Spells like iceblock or blink are simple and amazing if used properly. Mana gems are simple quick mana that doesn’t hurt you, and evocation is a full mana bar on cooldown.
---
Compared to a warlock who has no blink or movement ability. They have to use macros for pet abilities, and if you mindlessly life tap you nearly kill your self. Hellfire the stronger aoe CAN kill you on its own.
---
Makes sense, making extensive use of mind control pretty dramatically reduces damage taken. Forgot about that. I imagine some duos like hunter/hunter could pull off some indefinite kiting shenanigans that would make most dungeons possible as well.
---
Just because an option exists does not mean it should be used. I'd much rather have humans over AI.
---
You'll know when the subreddit explodes. It will be nitpicked into oblivion. I don't know why people keep asking... you will know when we will. It will be impossible to not know.
---
The GM should never have intervened in many mater back in classic, just gave the community an unrealistic expectation. GMs should never solve loot issues for example. If you need to report abuse, or a game breaking bug, that's where u go to a GM, but you get scammed of game items/gold, then that's on you. (Real life scam, go to the police, but they will probably say that's on you too)
---
Just for clarity, are you aware that BGs in Classic are not rated/ranked?
---
Also, people willing to heal in PvP are always welcome since this is the time that most healers like to respec and experience the other side for a bit.
---
You don’t start your experience as a legendary hero.
---
You start as a measly peasant.
---
Have patience and don’t try to pull more than one mob your level.
---
When reporting is easy, ppl do it for looking at them sideways. And in turn, reports don't do shit. 
---
&gt; But today, the AI is so convincing that most of us couldn't discern a human from a machine.
---
Without disagreeing with the rest of your post, this is not even close to true.  We are still very far away from AI being able to pass the turing test.
---
Hhaha, now in 2019, method spends their entire guild bank and goes 100m in debt to pay for their world first race. Funny how times change. 
---
Yeah, times are different. Flasks now get the respect they deserve, if not too much respect in Classic and TBC servers. Either way, they're pretty lucrative and we know more about the game than we used to. 
---
Like it sucks for them, but they've already explained this and isn't nearly as simple as people are making it out to be. Many of them were offered transfers to other departments and an open door back because they aren't completely getting rid of those positions (of which almost all are non-development that got laid off) they are reorganizing them and planning to shift them around. They also got excellent severance packages and are getting assistance with finding a new job. Marketing and customer service job are notorious for this type of stuff.
---
To be fair to the bot, i always /followed my buddy as a heal bot for him while i watched anime, an i didn't know how to emote either.
---
Stand amongst the ashes of a trillion dead souls, and ask the ghosts if honor matters. The silence is your answer.
---
How was red shirt guy not the best amount of questions answered? 
---
Server migrations to TBC will kill community, no? Say half my guild wants to play TBC and half wants to stay.
---
Is big futa cock sex roleplaying in goldshire a positive?...
---
In this situation, I'd likely be in the middle of something else. Continue on.
---
I don't know why most answers given here are analyzed as if it was a 2v2 arena match.
---
If you're interested in world pvp it does not matter which class combo u have, just play what you enjoy.
---
Druid is insanely powerful in wpvp if played well with unparalleled escape and durability , it doesn't matter if you don't have burst damage, the ele shaman can do that, you also don't need to worry about magic dispels, you can out maneuver / outlast most things .
---
Besides why would you consider yourself facing another pair like it's a legit 2v2, it might just be 2v1 or 2v40 you never know what'll happen in wpvp, most often than not being a druid and having stealth/escape can actually be better at avoiding fights that are disadvantageous , whereas the immobile stone that is a warlock would surely perish in such scenarios.
---
Bottom-line is , every class has ups and downs, don't let anyone tell you what's best, everything is best if u enjoy them , 
---
fun &gt; other people's biased opinions.
---

B. A is polite, but unless everybody are A-polite, the A-polite ones will lose out. If everyone goes with B, RNG will generally smoothen out the players' gearing progress anyway. 
---
dupont fired thousands of chemists a couple of years ago, i didnt see reddit crying about it
---
Yes indeed. Nerfed in BC but probably should have been nerfed for 1.12. 
---
I prefer the aesthetic of UD lock, but that racial plus the 5% pet bonus has me thinking orc
---
Starting my RP guild and building lifelong friends.
---
I would be up for that =)
---
And the average person doesn’t care. So?
---
I’ve never played on a RP server but I’m seriously considering it for Classic but I really have no idea where to start.
---
Dealing with "that guy ninja looted" requests are not to hard to code for. As for AI being convincing, if a telemarketer calls you, there is a possibility that it's not a human but a robot. And most of us wouldn't be able to tell the difference. I'm sure people who deal with AI on a regular basis can tell the difference but for basic tasks, most people can't. 
---
I think you're in for a bit of a shock if you think that the people that are all about "community" aren't also the people who are all about getting to say the n-word whenever they want. 
---
From way back in retail I recall there being an 'option A' attitude with people passing on upgrades if they already got one earlier in the run (unless it was something super amazing). Same thing if someone had been farming an instance and the item they'd been farming for dropped on your first run. The typical scenario was to pass the loot to the farmer and let them be done with that instance.
---
But the attitude has 100% changed over the years. Currently it seems to be a 'fuck you got mine' deal where everyone needs everything and if you lose an upgrade to someone who is just going to vendor it then you just accept it or pay them whatever they ask for. It was one of the big 'culture shocks' I got when first joining pservers after years of not playing.
---
I sort of adopted a mix of option A and option B, needing everything until I'm content with what I've got then backing out of rolls to give other people a better chance at upgrades.
---
My leveling always grinds to a halt as soon as I hit STV.  5 seconds after I start a quest I'm killing players, not mobs.
---
I always reserve loot when I'm close to full pre bis. 2-3 items left 
---
Keep one mob CC’d while I kill the other
---
Yeah sadly this is the case. Best priest tip I have for dealing with warriors is to power word shield immediately after a mortal strike so that your shield is used to absorb auto attacks. This prevents the warrior from gaining rage and might sometimes provide you a precious few seconds where mortal strike isn't up to get some big heals off.
---
But generally you're paper begging to be shredded unless the warrior/rogue gets peeled off you by an ally or engineering shenanigans that have long cooldowns.
---
Most (60%+) of those people on your list of 51 will not make it to 60.
---
Just get as many like-minded people as you can right now, it'll all work itself out.
---
Rest easy knowing that EA and ACTIVISION will be dead and gone in the not too distant future. Their business practices are literal suicide and it will catch up with them. It's not a matter of if, only when. They're horrible, but they're doing a necessary evil (not intentionally to help) by showing exactly what not to do, and other devs and publishers are taking notice. A world burned down in the ash of these shit stain companies will give rise to a glorious new era of gaming. 
---
You know.. sometime before the heat death of the universe. 
---
Me waiting for Pantheon rise of the fallen
---
Isn't that because they have pre-programmed responses, and the only AI part is the voice recognition needed to file what you say so it can give out a pre-recorded response?
---
Combat is much slower. Both what you can do and what bosses does. Basic "rotations" for most classes are not engaging at all. Frost mages just spam frostbolt for example. 
---
Levelling takes ages, getting from 1 to 60 will take a new player at least 8 days /played, maybe as high as 13-14 depending on how focused you are. 
---
Gearing up and stuff at level 60 is alright, you have a lot to do. But once you have gone past that and become a full-fledged raider there isn't much end game content to do. Aside from the raids themselves there is pretty much only Battlegrounds (PvP) and farming (consumables/gold). 
---
But because everything is so much more tedious and takes longer when you accomplish something (like hitting 60, killing that raid boss, getting that epic item, etc.), it feels much more rewarding. 
---
For some reason that is hard to exactly pin down the world also feels a lot more immersive. In retail you are often entirely removed from the game world, sure you can see what it looks like and what your character is doing and stuff, but it doesn't really feel like you are that character and so on. 
---
People talk about the community aspect and stuff, but having played both modern WoW expansions, real vanilla, and private vanilla servers. I don't think it's a huge difference. If you are an active player in an active raiding guild on retail you won't see a massive difference in community interactions in vanilla, it's still more or less the same. Being able to always see other server members in the world is the main difference (no cross realm sharding). 
---
Thanks for the reminder, just bought a copy myself. Can’t wait for it to arrive! :)
---
Juat be sensitive to the fact this one was published around patch 2.4.  There are a lot of differences between the values in this book and Blizzard's 1.12 reference client.
---
Which, if that doesn't bother you, it's a great read. These old references are fun to see how we used to learn about games.  Nowadays the Interent tends to spoil these sort of things.

Learning how to #8 is the key as something that can't run away. Warriors really don't have a choice other than "kill em with kindness" or afk. Works better than you think and at the very least will prevent from getting camped.
---
#8 is the most useful tip I think. Today this rogue kept ganking me. She killed me 4 times jn about 15 minutes.  Each time I had tried to fight back or fear and run. (I play on heavily overpopulated-with-Alliance PvP server, so there really is no option other than to keep rezzing and continue questing. Yes, it can be rough at times.)When she opened up on me the 5th time I just turned around and started jumping.  Not fighting, just jumping. It might have seemed to her like I was having a great time dying. She got me down to like 1 hit left and just turned away, mounted up, and I never saw her again. It’s just boring when they don’t fight back.

As a troll warrior I could get away using waaaay lower level food so I think the racial is just the munchies mon

Nintendo isn't even strict with content creators anymore. Last year, they pretty much undid all of their restrictions. https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-11-29-nintendo-scraps-creators-program-making-life-much-easier-for-youtubers
---
Trolls are the best tanks for endgame raiding, the added low HP zerker threat far outweighs the HP from Tauren.
---
Not much of a raider (Haven't even touched a BfA raid, not even in LfR!) more of an RPer. I do appreciate the info though!
---
"Why isn't everyone more educated on the situation?"
---
Ok, what really happened?
---
"Fuck off, do your own research."
---
I will be starting a white supremacy themed guild.

Had the same thing happen with me after not playing for awhile then going on a private server and experiencing the new norm, it seems. I remember people being called out for being greedy if they were needing over others after already getting a piece or more

&lt;Malicious Intent&gt; is a Semi-Hardcore Horde raiding guild that will be competitively pushing all high end content in classic WoW with a focus on both clearing content and having fun doing it. We will initially be raiding **two days a week with a possible third night for progression weeks (never on the weekend)**. We use a loot council system with static members and one member rotated in per week to keep the council a fair and diverse place. &lt;Malicious Intent&gt; will be focusing on 40-man content. We will have PvP and PvE events; these include - but are not limited to - farming Devilsaur, raid consumables, gearing under-geared guildies and possibly even city raids. We are mostly working adults which may cause us to clear at a slower pace, but our guild is competitive and progression focused - so we will clear content. While we are a raiding guild we also welcome social players to build and take part in our community.
---
**Experience:**
---
* Leadership has experience into and through AQ40.
---
* We will gladly accept raiders both with and lacking prior experience. All we ask is that you put in equal effort in learning fights and coming prepared.
---
**Recruitment:**
---
* We are currently seeking all roles, but as more people reach 60 we will close or open certain classes/specs.
---
* We do allow obscure specs, however the positions are ***highly competitive*** and they may receive lower loot priority than traditional specs.

Exactly. In a scenario where two clones of the same character are tanking the same boss, they receive the same amount of rage. The only difference in rage generation comes from what weapon they use.
---
As I've demonstrated with mathematical proof, weapon speed alone is not the determining factor in assessing the tanking value of a weapon.
---
What I want is for Blizzard to go through the entire Vanilla lifecycle first. Give us what we've wanted for over a decade. Do minimal patching beside what is needed and put out fires when needed. During that time, work on multiple pitches for more content. When we're done playing Naxx, Blizzard would give us a choice between multiple options on where to go. We'd vote, and then they would go that way. 
---
At every step of the turn, there would be a community vote for changes. Should we give Paladins a taunt? Yes or No. That type of thing. Should we introduce flying? Yes or no. Offer arguments for and against. Let the community decide.
---
And if people want some pure Vanilla servers, leave them, while offering players a chance to migrate their characters over to the updated Vanilla+ servers. 
---
That's what I want. Let the modern gamers have their modern WoW. Classic WoW was always where it's at, in my opinion. 
---
Very interesting. Thank you for the info.
---
Acting out all of my carefully laid plans :)
---
The bigger thing is that I don't think I've had a problem that required a human GM in over a decade
---
If my faction member is winning the 1v1 I let them finish, otherwise you bet your ass that I'm gonna help him out.

This shows how much reddit bernie bros understand earnings.  It was a record year in revenue.  Profit was down.
---
They fired 800 useless esports kids who had no talent.  Cry more.
---
Explain.
---
Blizzard has great year, lays off 800 employees and CEO gets huge bonus.
---
Nintendo having some bad years, lays off 320 people, over half of which were temp from the beginning, CEO and other executives takes between 20% and 50% pay cuts for months because of profit losses.
---
These are totally the same thing, yes.
---
I remember asking to see a GM's artifact weapon once, and they said that if they linked it I would be blinded by the epicitude.
---
Yes.

Not everyone in here is playing, some of us are just waiting on news.

Nah, undead are the best tanks for their undeadiness.

---
Weren’t Battlemasters added to improve queue times on BGs across the board because the friction of traveling negatively impacted queue times for all BGs?
---
leveling doesnt matter. late game pve is like this:
---
ally - lower threat generation and greater stats and being forced to play human because of the glancing blow reduction or you might as well uninstall the game
---
horde - having the time of your life with the unbridled stupidity that is windfury totem
---
&gt; Should we give Paladins a taunt?
---
Lol, and this is exactly how you turn Vanilla into modern WoW all over again haha. 
---
Hahaha wow. Your comment was such a wild ride of hate, it's dizzying. 
---
Nintendo is sitting on so much money that their stocks could go into the negatives for years before they even remotely start to feel the effects. They don't give a fuck.

It's just an example. 
---
Devilsaur mafias would then become entire economic monopolies of the trade industry. No changes until all of classic content has been cleared. Anti-change, because vanilla is vanilla.
---
Welcome! Glad to have you on board for Classic! On top of what you’ve heard about the gameplay, I’d add that you can also expect a bit of a chattier, more social experience than what you may have found through the latest expansions :) 
---
E sports department were untouched from what I heard. 
---
AND THERES NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT MON
---
Honestly, I prefer priest/warrior over pally/warrior.  Priests with enough points in shadow can do a lot of damage, apply a ranged slow,  fear a bunch of players at once, etc.  Pallys are better PvP healers, but their damage output is pretty low.  The upside with pallys is they're pretty damage hard to kill and have tons of utility. 
---
Windfury, that is all.
---
They did mostly that in Cataclysm. No thanks.
---
Eh I’m just saying if you start on release and average like 2 or 3 hours a day, taking in the sights and pvp but not intentionally holding back your leveling, you should avoid the shitshow of optimized rogues in the first 2 brackets. The majority at that point probably won’t even be maxed out on gear, much less the expensive/rare enchants that are the true source of their power.

I never saw or spoke to a gm during vanilla. This is just absurd now. 
---

Yeah, I always just assumed Thulsdoom was making up threats in hopes of scaring you guys off. 
---
Damn, Classic sure is going to be an adventure. I hope to see your riotous ass back out there again. Just, God forbid, not in Molten Core ever again. A man can only endure so many conniptions in a single lifetime.
---
Major City, please and thank you
---
I like the rock-paper-scissor aspect of WoW. It made your class feel special and powerful in certain scenarios, even if you had glaring weaknesses in other areas.
---
Loved dotting up Rogues with my Warlock, it completely fucked them over. Though if a Rogue got the jump on me, I was a Deadlock.
---
I recently switched to Alliance warrior after being deadset on Horde warrior.
---
My reasoning being:
---
* I've never gone alliance before
---
* TBC spoilt me and I'm going to miss pallies more than shammies
---
* I want to roll on a PVE server and the only organised PVE guilds seem to be Alliance based
---
* Dwarves are cool
---
Hope this helps
---
The amount of hate that spread through the forums about having to travel to portals back in Vanilla was unrivaled.  
---
One of the many things I loved about TBC was Fel Lotus in random herb spawns
---
Yeah it added a ton of flavor and life to the game. I played a warrior so anytime I saw a frost mage it was like ah god damn it this is gonna blow. Fortunately most players at the time were horrible and with a little decent rng on my side ( hello frost bite can you fuck off) and a massive amount of gear I grinded my life away for I'd destroy them. Yeah sometimes I'd fight a mage that knew exactly what they were doing and it was hopeless. That was okay though because the good moments felt like taking down a titan even if it was some guy back pedaling arcane explosioning.  
---
Pre sword spec nerf I once charged a warlock hit hamstring and they died from 6 sword spec proc's. When the game doesn't focus on balance at all it can really focus on uniqueness and flavor and that has its own fun to it. Yeah I loved arena when it came around and I enjoyed more difficult raids that came with later expansions as well. However each expansion tore a little bit away that made vanilla great.  
---
I miss that flavor and uniqueness that vanilla added. Games now all focus on being balanced and having match making systems so it's fair and stream lining everything. What made vanilla great was it was just a huge cluster fuck in a game. Outside of super broken things balance wasn't a priority at all.
---
Use the standard arms leveling builds. You can tank easily without being prot spec. I'd pick up skinning while leveling but I wouldn't waste time on anything else until you at least have your first mount. Herb is the biggest money maker in the professions and every player who doesn't pick up engineering for endgame content is doing themselves a disservice. 
---
Have you made a Horde one? Ooh! Or maybe the crests of all the races! (I work at a craft store and now you've given me ideas.)

**&lt;Kor Kron Vanguard&gt;** Semi-hardcore | PvE/WPvP | Server region: EU (NA welcome) | Server type: PvP | Faction: Horde
---
**Introduction:** If you're looking for some pre-BG PvP action or you're a PvE raider who's looking to put that gear to some good use whacking Alliance in the face with it, you're at the right place. Everyone earns their roles here, whether they're Social, Raiders or PvP-ers. 
---
**What we are looking for:** Players of all different schedules and backgrounds willing to be part of an amazing community regardless of how much time they have on their hands to play this game.
---
**What we are aiming for:** Clearing all raid content, acquiring all epic items and scepter and be one of the most respected guilds on the server. We aim is to be decent in PvE without tryharding and sacrificing the fun aspect of playing this game in order to spearhead the advancement of structured WPvP in the Classic WoW community. 
---
**What we expect of members:** 
---
As a PvE raider: Knowledge and desire to improve in your class, as well as getting to level 60 and able to raid within 8 weeks.
---
As a WPvP raider: Show up at 3/4 of our weekly WPvP raids. 
---
As a Social: Participation in various social activities. (recruitment, social events, writing a 5 minute report etc.)
---
You are free to choose any combination of those roles within our guild. Currently recruiting all classes. 
---
**Our Raid Schedule:** Current plan is min. 3 major raids per week. (1 WPvP raid + 2 PvE raids) with Loot Council. Additional details (such as raid times, spots etc.) will be handled after the game launches. The WPvP raids are not be mandatory, but they will provide an advantage as a Raider in ties against other players when deciding for loot. Our timezone will be around GMT+1. 
---
**Guides:** A thorough introductory guide to structured World-PvP to show you how we get things done.

Warlocks are def high on the threat meters as we don't get base reduction or a threat resset in fights. Having salvation is a god send fo this (as is tranq air but shamans first go into the melee groups for WF). LIPs will get you far aswell. All other buffs that paladins give are stronger versions of totems or just non excisting as a totem (BoK) also does the alliance come with fear ward from Dwarf Priests.
---
  
---
As for PvP I would argue orcs have the strongest racial. As a lock you are going to face more melee than you will locks and you can use you feldoggo vs fear anyway.
---
For Wpvp WotF is a anoyence to deal with. However come premades and dungeouns i'd prefere facing undead than having paladins on the opposing team.
---
As a lock you are also in luck that you can use SM ruin for PvE and PvP.
---
I am not the most pvp savvy person of the [Classic Warlock Discord](https://discord.gg/D6TrRkq) but there most def are some PvP nuts in there. Might want to give it a shot.
---
Goodluck and have fun.

Having lvl 18 spells at 32

Use swingtimer, hamstring kite when you are waiting for your next swing, that way you are trading hits with the mob. I suggest respecing to tank as 60. You can tank dungeons as any spec as warr but the 2h wep rly speeds up your lvling process with this method, avoiding eating time as much as possible.
---
I was being sarcastic :) 
---
Run 30 minutes to an Dungeon Just to wait 30 minutes more for the Last Player that sits afk in ironforge 
---
Always B when drop is an upgrade.
---
It's not 5% of your total stamina pool mate. It's a 5% increase to your base stamina pool.
---
At level 60 all Warriors have 112 base stamina plus their racial starting bonus. Tauren start with 1 additional point of stamina, which puts a Tauren Warrior at 113 base stamina before Endurance is calculated. 5% of 113 is 5.6, so rounded up becomes 6.
---
A level 60 Tauren Warrior gets 6 extra stamina points. Your supposed best tanking racial grants 60 health.
---
Pretty sure they had record revenue not profit and cut non developers. 
---
Hpala and arms warr rule the 2v2 game. You might have trouble with double casters being able to kite you down, but vs melee, no competition.
---
I agree. I once had a 10 minute convo in whispers with a GM about “if Jesus played wow would he play a paladin or a shaman?”
---
I actually thought it was gonna be awesome, and it was for like a month. But the novelty wore off pretty quick.
---
Plus Mark Hamill does a lot of back handed comments and down right calling Disney out for the way Star Wars went. He's like the Ythesins in quite a few ways. 
---
They really don't, this is just a rumor that started spreading for no reason...
---
But if you somehow have proof I would like to see some.
---
But just recently, during switch launch months they used airplanes for delivering their consoles (extremely expensive) when the demand was high.
---
But that was not intentional, it is because the Nand factories are heavily occupied by Samsung, Apple, Toshiba etc for making storage for ssd, phones and such.
---
An unfortunate side effect of used flash storage in the switch and using cards for their games.
---
Always B. You only ever do A is if it's someone you know that you're playing with and they need the item.

During vanilla a rich individual (who played the AH) purchased full T2 for his mage. This was just before gates of AQ opened.
---
Well... There is this sword. But, its in some flash drive somewhere 
---
Playing the game with my friends, instead of going at it alone like I have done before. 
---
Sorry but this is nonsense. 
---
Speccing shadow barely improves your damage until Shadowform at 40. Why would you go that deep into Shadow when you’re duoing with a Warrior who benefits massively from having a healbot?
---
 The ‘ranged’ slow has a whopping range of 20yds, which is much less than intercept. It won’t help your Warrior catch anyone he couldn’t already have caught. 
---
Speccing shadow doesn’t affect Psychic Scream beyond a small cooldown reduction.
---
Finally, a Paladin’s damage output is irrelevant when they can keep a geared warrior on his target with freedom. That outweighs any damage any class could hope to do.
---
This, your my type of lad
---
Watching these videos is the best advice to give, but one thing I think is worth highlighting (it's mentioned in the video, but worth reinforcing if you're new to vanilla):
---
The availability of dispels will dictate much of your playstyle. Shaman purge is an offensive dispel (opponents), Paladins can only dispel defensively (own team). Priests can dispel both offensively and defensively, but are often asked to pick up the slack based on faction (more offensive dispels as ally, more defensive dispels as horde).
---
This small asymmetry can make a big difference in the way the heal classes play out across factions.
---
I played from just after release until near the end of TBC, at no point did I ever have any interaction with a GM.  
---
I know that falling though the world did happen from time to time, and kited world bosses needed to be reset, but that is hardly 'part of the social dynamic'
---
the statement:
---
&gt; **Interacting with GMs was a part of Vanilla's social dynamic** 
---
Is just plain bullshit.
---
Only 2 monitors? What year is this. 2018?
---
Stay tuned for 10 reasons why these kinds of videos are really annoying and why you should just do whatever the fuck you want.
---
Overall tempo is slower, it seem more grindy. Journey through game moments feels like listening to slow blues, not spastic kpop.
---
&gt; As for AI being convincing, if a telemarketer calls you, there is a possibility that it's not a human but a robot. And most of us wouldn't be able to tell the difference. 
---
Do you seriously think this?  You really think that your average person couldn't deduce whether or not they're talking to a robot over the phone?  You're delusional if you truly think so.
---
We are nowhere close to being able to make convincing AI's that can converse with humans.  An average human could probably figure out if they're talking to a robot vs a real human in less than 60 seconds, it just takes a few questions.  You're making it sound like we've got much more advanced AI than we actually do.
---
Real druid gamer. 
---
Even so, he's still wrong.  It's incredibly simple for a person to tell if they're talking to a real person vs an automated response system, I have no idea what that guy is talking about.
---
He's either vastly underestimating the abilities of an average person or he's getting telemarketing calls from some super advanced future AI of some kind.

---
You have to go resto when going ele for PvP either way, the instacast from the resto tree is mandatory. 
---
Ele is probably one the strongest more versatile specs out there for PvP and synergizes well with other casters.
---
Remember to have him heal you and actually use totems, and you remember to peel from him with fears and you can melt faces. Warlocks can keep the pressure while ele will be able to instagib some1 if left to cast.
---
City. 2 reasons.
---
a) it means more people doing BG's and that's very important.
---
b) It spreads out rankers who will go to high lvl zones to wpvp for honor while waiting in queues. A couple of rankings going to felwood to pvp is fine, but when Felwood is the closest thing to ashenvale bg? Oh man have fun questing in that area if there's queue's for the opposite faction.
---
There’s such a stark difference in this place from when Classic was first announced in 2017 to where we are today. I enjoy the nostalgic threads and old screenshots people share, but man, the mechanics of classes and raids and min/maxing can only be discussed so much. As someone who never raided and considered getting to Level 60 my #1 accomplishment, I just want a confirmed release date and beta announcement!
---
That guy is just wrong resto-ele hybrid is legit, they will be sought after in premades. 
---
Healing druids on other hand not so much, in bgs youd need to flag carry p much. In world pvp youd likely need to go mostly feral and would want to pair with a stealth class.
---
Sham and lock will be a good duo for levelling and most forms of pvp. SM/ruin is a great all around build, but conflag builds might eventually fit better on the BIG BURST synergy youd have with a sham.
---
Taunt was intended to be in Vanilla for Paladins but they decided to delay it to BC.
---
I wouldn't care as much for finished zones as I would for some instances down the road.
---
Adding grim batol, halls of origination, some of the caverns of time instances or karazan would kick ass. They were all planned to be added in vanilla and I think they could seriously prolonge the experience. They could also reuse assets from retail to make it somewhat easy to make.
---
Just make all of these super high level. Like splice them in-between BWL and Naxx so that newcomers down the line get a proper vanilla experience.
---
I know. I’m always posting that copypasta. 
---
I usually spam /sigh /sleep alternatively 
---
LOL, this is a joke right? 
---
A geared 60 rogue can one hit any level 20. If they see you and want to kill you they will do so. At level 20 you have no mount so can not out run them, you can not out hide them, they will kill you if they want to. The only thing you can reasonably do is get a 60 friend in who can kill him. If the level disparity is less than 10 levels you can maybe take them out 3v1 if you have friends at the time and particularly if they have a mage that can keep them slowed.
---
&gt;Seeing a cash shop icon on my screen is enough to break that immersion
---
There won’t be. They’ve clearly said that.
---
Dear lord you’re off your meds. 
---
Try going into display settings and duplicating displays before opening the game. 
---
Is your external monitor 144hz by any chance? 
---
Heres the best tip. Play pve server.
---
I’d postulate that the AMAs with John Staats and co are much more informative as they’re legitimate sources and not raw speculation.
---
They disproved most of the speculation made in the linked video, via their comments, in those AMAs. If you really study the development of wow you’d realize that “what the original content was meant to be” was a constantly moving target that. 
---
Which means there’s no way to really reverse engineer, or speculate your way to the truth behind it. Content plans for Vanilla changed all the time. They were never static enough for “meant to be” to be applicable. 
---
Blessing of freedom lasts about 2 seconds before a shaman purges it in my experience.  I've done this leveling combo before and in BG the priest proved a lot more useful than the pally.  The priest in our group killed people trying to take him down, slowed flag carriers,  and made our little group quite offensively focused.  
---
Secondly, he's going to be leveling with this duo.  Heal bot pally DPS is shit, and if the pally goes ret he's going to have shit all mana to heal the warrior.

---
This is important doe, since its about the company that will release our game.
---
Professions: Herbing/Alchy you're going need lots of health pots while leveling.  If you're lucky selling some herbs will help with  your mount at 40.
---
Learn cooking for food buffs.
---
Spec: First 5 points fury for +cirt, then all arms till 40.  Then respec Mortal Strike.  
---
Tanking:  Don't bother with prot spec until you're getting ready for raids.  A lot of times it actually makes you a worse tank in 5 mans due to rage starvation.
---
Things to buy: Get a  pair of white grade boots(cloth is best so you can mail it to alts later) and pay an enchanter to put minor speed increase on it(3-5g with mats usually).  That's +8% running speed that you swap on whenever you'll walking someplace and then swap out before you start killing.   Since you don't get a mount till 40 and don't have speed increase skill like other class you will spend a lot of time on foot and it will save you a lot of time.
---
Get a new weapon fairly often(5-10 levels). Weapon damage is the biggest part of your DPS while leveling.  Don't go crazy on the AH, but look for good deals on weapons thinking to when you'll need them.  Don't pay too much, getting a mount at 40 is more important than weapons.
---
Killing ERPers in Goldshire with my Infernal/Doomguard
---
As a warrior who never maxes gear while leveling, I just /wave at people and hope for the best.
---
Then it’s just /cry until death.
---
No idea what's best. Most because the SUPER NUKE classes will just instantly kill everything.
---
What's would be the most fun to play for me? Easy. Either Hunter or Rogue. They maintain their synergy of play and mostly get a ton of maximized tools. Sort of like how I would think a Warlock would be the best caster choice for me.

Probably the most important things to respect are to have a fantasy conform name and not be a dick in say and yell chats. They should be reserved for in character(IC) conversations.  Global and regional chats(/1-4, lfg, world) can be IC or 'out of character' (OOC) conversations.
---
Also just try to learn from RPers by just observing at first. Maybe try some light IC talk. 
---
When you're more comfortable with RPing you can try to develop a background story for your character.(you can even thinking about it now). You can be a good or evil character, a pacifist or a warmonger, a dumb peasant who picked up a sword and is an ever stronger-growing warrior. Probably the only frowned upon character is some overpowered dude, like you're Thralls forgotten son who will be leader of the horde soon. 
---
So my suggestion:
---
Just create a character on a RP server and observe and learn. Try it for yourself. The community probably is more mature and glad to help (although there will be elitists like everywhere)
---
OR when servers are announced and guild are forming you can find a RP-Guild and tell them youre new to RP so you'll have people to ask OOC and practice IC without feeling anxious.
---
Hope I could help you and have fund exploring a whole new aspect of the game :)
---
My casual raiding guild took Enhancement shamans to raids. However, they generally wore all healing gear and healed. If they had insisted on DPSing instead of healing we would have let them as we did with some feral druids, but I can't recall any of them ever DPSing on a progression raid.  Healers were just at too much of a premium to waste on low shaman DPS.
---
It has a point tho
---
Grow up man :)
---
You *might* convince a guild to bring you for use of the Nightfall axe, but Horde raids usually want eight Resto Shamans and none from the other specs. Of course once you get content on farm, a casual guild might not care too much, but that'd be something to bring up when joining.
---
This. Duplicating or disabling laptop monitor before running the game should do the trick. WoW 1.12 definitely supports 1080p.
---
its not like there are going to be no actual GMs in classic, there definitely will be considering the fact I’ve had to talk with two this expansion (once for having group that was very efficiently taking advantage if the old Nazmir BoE farm to the point where leveling players and 120s couldnt finish leveling/world quests, the other i forget). if blizz coulda had an automated ban/report/whatever you wanna call it system 13(14?) years ago, they would have. however I really really reaaaaallllly hope that it isn’t just a copy and paste of what we have currently because if 5-10 players decide they wanna be a-holes and get someone kicked offline for reporting them over nothing thats BS, especially with the chat ban that is included in some bans which would make it nearly impossible for a player to find dungeon/raid groups in classic. (which i might add is why LFR is the most godly amazing most blessed sick epic gnarly righteous thing to ever bless this earth /s)
---
Biggest diffrence is that you have to figure things out for yourself. If you arive at a new quest hub. You look inside every house for npcs questgivers because the minimap tells you nothing. Once accepted you have to read it. Because the map tells you nothing. When you have to collect certain items you have to kill mobs to see if they drop them. Because the tooltip sais nothing. If you have to pick up stuff from the ground you have to search for them. There is no yellow glow around the items.
---
Its more like other rpg's where searching and finding  things is a big part of the game. 
---
Its dangurous. May die during leveling if you start fighting mobs when you are low on mana or hp.
---
You may die if you pull to many. Even when you pull and try to run. You will pull more and more. 
---
There is one world. No sharding.  No phasing.  
---
You leave a footprint behind when killing monsters. Enemy faction members will follow the trail and kill you. You can do the same. If you are a strong player 1v1. And you decide to do a certain quest. You are the boss in the area. Your presence matters.
---
Level as Horde and experience it as Horde this time because I played Alliance up until Wrath when faction changes came out. After that I was Horde until about a month and a half into BFA which was when I quit the retail game. Waiting for classic, and if it's bombs I think I'm gonna retire on the Blizzard titles. 
---
&gt;I don't mean a min max guild but a guild that raids once or twice a week.
---
Those are not mutually exclusive. In fact I would guess most "min max guilds" only raid about that much, because it doesn't take longer to clear raids if you optimise well. Anyway, every raiding guild want to min max to some extent, like trying to make their shamans go resto because they are more useful that way. If you're really stubborn about your spec you can of course find a guild that takes you as enhancement, shouldn't be a huge problem. Just don't expect your guild to be particularly happy about you refusing to play resto. 
---
As always with these debates, it's not that the "bad" specs are useless to groups. You would just be *more* useful as resto, in this case. And changing specs isn't that big of a deal, it's not like you have to re-roll your character. 
---
Re: #1 regardless of back to anything sitting is a guaranteed crit. They can also stand inside you to be behind you.
---
Re: #8. As a level 30ish rogue I've stopped many level 60s ganking in stv just by locking them down and running away. You can cc/run/hide, maybe not fight and win though. 
---
Something like that could never be banned to start off. However making a true twink will be more effort than most people realize. Its a combo of getting ALL the right gear(bad luck on rng can make this difficult), taking into account travel exp while acquiring said gear, and doing it all before you accidentally go beyond the desired level range. Not to mention having the gold for the enchants you want. 
---
that works temporarily but then my 4k monitor from the laptop is on aswell. i just have the laptop closed so i can game at 1080p on my monitor. If i keep my displays duplicated it will put a lot of stress on my computer from running everything on my screen twice for no reason wont it?
---
I missed the point? Who is disagreeing that there should be regulations on polution? It is not me. I was trying to talk about free markets in relation to Blizzard. 
---
Who has the job to know what polution is? The ppl who write the regulation or the ppl who say burn a piece of textile together with some woodpellets to heat thier factory?
---
It is a well known concept that Air polution is an "Externality". This means nobody owns the air so when polution occurs intentionally or not nobody is directly effected. This is a category of violation that we need governmental intervention to fix. 
---
An example of regulation that has unintented side effects: Rules regarding how you spend your pention funds. It is advantagious to put them in stocks or bonds. This grows the stock market. In order to get a piece of this growing pie companies like Blizzard may want change from private ownership to publicly traded. This mechanism gives incentive for companies to keep growing and become mega corporations. 
---
You are fighting imaginary ppl who advocate for it to be legal to polute. 
---
Farmers would use eco fuels but as it stands there are regulations that keep them from doing so. As eco fuels are also a food source and it would also be too easy to cheat on Tax by making the stuff yourself. 
---
Well, thats kinda half of the game. New locks are "undergeared" until r13 or full t2/2.5. Until then they are rogue food dying in a cheap + kidney.
---
Spot on!
---
You sure showed me! This issue has no nuance at all. Corporation = bad. Regulation = good. 
---
Wow that doesn't even make sense rpg wise xD. Good thing Classic is coming..
---
The System doesn't need to impress anyone.
---
&gt; If i keep my displays duplicated it will put a lot of stress on my computer from running everything on my screen twice for no reason wont it?
---
No, it won't. It will share the same image to both outputs, it won't render everything twice.
---
I think the best solution is to have bgs available only from portals initially, then later add battlemasters.
---
It more closely matches the vanilla experience and creates more wpvp hotspots early on - part of that world building which makes vanilla special. Later people can start afking in major cities between pvp.
---
&gt; b) It spreads out rankers who will go to high lvl zones to wpvp for honor while waiting in queues. A couple of rankings going to felwood to pvp is fine, but when Felwood is the closest thing to ashenvale bg? Oh man have fun questing in that area if there's queue's for the opposite faction. 
---
See this is something I want to experience again (at least for a time). The feeling of a World at War.
---

Moving on

Roleplaying in goldshire it is for the rest of my life.
---
Paladin - bubble hearth
---
&gt; You don’t start your experience as a legendary hero.
---
It's funny to think about the players who started in legion playing vanilla. They started and immediately got their Ashbringers and shit while regarded as a champion. Now they get to go back to the roots that all characters are assumed to have and lay the groundwork of becoming that champion.
---
its pretty much just a pve issue. why?
---
pve is mostly about high sustained dps
---
pvp is mostly about high burst damage
---
hunter excells hat burst damage with the right gear, especially with renataki trinket from ZG. Now the Dilemma for blizz was that hunter pve dps could not realy be improved without increasing pvp dps at the same time. so if blizz fixed hunter dps for lategame pve during vanilla then pvp would have been broken for hunters.
---
I was talking about free markets in relation to Blizzard. Not anything to do with EPA. I also never argued for an completely unregulated free market. It is all black and white for you no inbetween. You are fighting imaginary ppl. 
---
Merge happened in 2007. WotlK and a bit of TBC was ynder the influence, but it is true that the absolute decay of fhe game and the breaking point was at the end of wrath. 
---
However, things like flying should be mentioned. Cool idea for the layout of Outland, but otherwise a bad thing for the game. But that wasn't an economic decision, I am aware.
---
and how was it?
---
If polluting the environment results in a higher profit, yes.
---
Pve server. Find yellow mobs a level or two lower than me. Grind for a month.
---
Yeah, you never have enough shamans, never.
---
Always go for mobs that are lower level than me, I could safely grind my way to 60 like that. You could do this in dungeons solo as well to avoid being ganked but be careful with pulling :D. Never grind in peak hours. Escape/hearth when there is any sign of danger (although rogues and druids could royally fuck you up even if you are very careful lol).
---
I'd roll a night elf warrior just for the fun of it. I am sure shadowmeld could save me. I'd also steadily max out engineering to get stuff that could potentially avoid sticky situations.
---
lightning reflexes becomes a viable pve build but only in super late game with great gear. and also then it doesnt make up the damage in pve. its pretty much a tradeoff between:
---
(marksman) 100ap trueshot aura, 15% multi damage, 5% ranged damage VS 3% more crit, 15% agility (survival)
---
Only reason I'd want the portals (apart from maybe a little nostalgic feel) is the hillsbrad foothill wars. 
---
Other than that I think battlemasters is the way to go.
---
Add "anyone buffed with Fear Ward" to the Horde List, and Paladin cleanses. 
---
You read into my comment an argument that i never made. 
---
It is not so simple as Corporation = Bad, Regulation = good. Any regulation will alow a company to compete on being good at living up to that regultion rather than say create a better game. 
---
Hi, /u/wahiggles
---
Don't spend your rage on Heroic Strike or Rend. The damage per point of rage spent is low.
---
Pull one mob, pool your rage and aim to be at or around 90-99 rage by the time you kill that mob. Depending on the strength of your character, pull two or more mobs and begin cleaving them down. This method becomes a lot more effective once you have Sweeping Strikes. Also use talented overpower every time it's off the cooldown.
---
Grats, you're a more efficient Warrior leveler than 80% of the entire server.
---
Really? hmm maybe i should still consider holy reck instead of holy ret
---
Tbh roleplaying is the safest thing you can do. Never leave the safe zones
---
Niche tactic but if all is lost try to die near a wall if you can so you can res on the other side of it. I escaped a group of 5 corpse camping me once that way!
---
A warrior just for the fun of it? Are you suicidal? You're definitely gonna die with a warrior.
---
Zzz
---
Even then, a stunlock is all it takes.
---
That would mess up the lore of the game. 
---
I only played Warrior for the most part in my life, I'd be fine lol. I barely died during the Classic demo as well, haven't lost my edge.
---
This mentality towards blizzard is probably more common than you might think, even from people who were not initially part of the classic hype/audience.   
---
Looking back at my past experiences with their titles, it makes me sad to see things end this way.
---
Try disproving any of it. You can’t. 
---
But that's the thing about warriors. You can know the class and the abilities 100% but you pull too many mobs in the wrong place at the wrong time and you're toast
---
Then a 60 horde decides to attack goldshire and you are dead
---
Only PvP
---
funny enough that dark edge of insanity is pretty much bis for Hunter pvp. especially since u can proc it with ring clip spam
---
Fury or Arms to Level 39, then go Arms at L40 for Mortal Strike. It's really worth it. Also don't worry too much about armour but try to keep your weapon up to date as much as is practicable. WWA or Bonebiter are great choices for the 40-60 stretch.
---
roll lock, get imp void talents, then full affli. ride my felsteed, kill alliance in STV
---
Goldshire is not contested.
---
I know its just a fun thought experiemnt, but lets be honest, if that would be the case nobody would level at all. There is ALWAYS a possibility that a hiher rogue/druid shows up, the game lags, you pull a few more mobs accidentally, the risks is just waaaay too high. There should be a time limit though. I dont think the fact that "you can get out at lvl60 is motivational enough. You should be granted like half a year or so to finish it, or alse you die anyway. 
---
We should also estabilish wether the others know about my situation or not, or if they know about the situation (but not the person) or not? If they know that there is somebody here who ca only get out at lvl60 and dies IRL if dies ingame, I would spend my time befriending some ppl and after a few months of bonding I'd tell them, it is me, and I need their help to get to 60 (possibly by farming dungeons).
---
Then that's on me, I'd be more careful than usual though. If I die still then welp. Just because I am in a real life and death situation I won't give up playing the class I know. Heck, knowing myself I would die pretty fast with a class I don't know xD (despite it having better survival tools lol).
---
Negative emotes might trigger them because you apparently do not like it.
---
I always use fun/positive emotes like hug, greet, wave, smile, laugh etc. For some reason it feels more satisfying killing someone who sighs, cries or spits than something laughing and hugging you.
---
Frost mage. I would play only at lowest population times of the night. I would maximize efficiency leveling in the safest zones. I would constantly be communicating with others and zone chat for anyone who has seen pvpers. I assume everyone would be leveling together or something and that there wouldn't be a bunch of 60s just running around? I would probably make sure to always play with at least one other person maybe more. Always have health pots and such.  Stack stamina as much as possible. Probably be constantly going back and forth Into safe spots because of how fuckin scary it would be. Rogues would really be the only big problem so rank 1 blizzard spam on myself would probably be a thing 
---
They don't know and I doubt anyone would believe you. Added a timer
---
Also it's a pvp server and warriors get rekt in world pvp while leveling 
---
Why does no one want to talk about Blizzard?
---
Take this example. You are heating your factory with wood pellets but you have some leftover scraps of textile, is it ok to burn them? What if noone knows if it is ok? Should it be punishable to polute if it happens before it is known/regulated? Should we ban all kinds of fuel that is not governmentally approved? What effects does this have on inventing new fuel sources? It is not so black and white as you make it out to be. 
---
Basically the pre-raid bis for warriors. Either buy the items from the AH or bribe people to trade them to me. With unlimited gold, that would be possible. But in reality, it is grind, baby!
---
(It should be mentioned that I don't actually want this option to happen. It would be terrible thing for the game and it would be much less enjoyable once people actually get the items. Just said which items I would happily invest a lot of gold in if I had the gold.)
---
Just endure the /10 days played to get to 60 and enjoy the next /30 days played being the best tank, the best PvP and the best DPS class in the game.
---
Just out of curiosity, how much would that cost? Considering the raid would know the guy has money, my guess is like 2,5K gold at the very least.
---
With loot trading, you can just trade them the first one if you win the second.
---
if they dont know they definately would not believe me. Although I for some reason thought it is some kind of magical matrix scenario, where if my avatar dies my mind also shuts down, but it can also be a pretty real situation, where you held captive and threatened to be killed if your toon dies. You hooked to an infusion, and you also dont feel any other pain (just death). So if the situation is this real I might be able to convince them, otherwise (if its just a magical fairy slicing your neck when your toon dies) i wouldnt be. I feel like I kinda went overboard with this... But the timer is a good update.
---
Related to this; if you didn't know don't ever accept a duel from a pvp flagged more powerful player while you're not pvp flagged, for example in faction zones. When you attack them inside the duel (which doesn't flag you for pvp) they will type /forfeit and ending the duel, now you just attacked them outside of the duel and are now flagged for pvp.
---
druid is trhe safest best, stealth, tanky bear and heals and easy to escape from people.
---
My first bit of advice is to post in the correct Subreddit.
---
While frost mage or holy paladin can be a good choice, I dont think anything without stealth could be a possibility. The ability to stay hidden or vanish in a tough situation (for example when an other stealther jumps on you) is invaluable. I would probably roll a resto druid and be in stealth 90% of the time, only playing at nights  after like scanning the zone for 30 minutes or so. 
---
Edgemasters handguards, Lionheart helm, titanic leggings, devilsaur set, Foror's compendium of dragonslaying.
---
I would say if you focus on mastering warlock you can pick any race really. Horde does have better PvP racials which will give you an advantage when fighting against opponents of same skill level or higher. Against most people(especially in WPvP) they won't really matter because there will be a lot of bad/average players.

" \*My wife will be playing for the first time, and while I will allow her to play anything she wants, she will come to me for direction and an opinion\* "  
---
Literally where I am right now.   
---
We're getting her a computer for her birthday so she can start playing with me when Classic comes out. She wants to tank, but I think she'll realize it's a ton of responsibility that she's not socially prepared for (she could totally play a tank, but social introvert and entirely non-confrontational). I'm trying to steer her toward either warrior or druid so she can still jump into the middle of a battle and own stuff in the face, which is what she actually wants to do, but seems to think she needs to be a tank to do so. I'm going to be a pocket healer for her, and I'm totally going shammy if we roll horde (also her choice). If she picks horde and druid, I'll find out first hand just how well this combo works.
---
You're doing this all wrong. You're supposed to say "ACTIVISION BAD" for the easy karma
---
Yeah, but what about that one screenshot where a GM makes a joke? Checkmate
---
It's bad enough having to queue from a city, especially when you're trying to level, having to fly across the world sounds horrific. I'd be happiest with a recruiter NPC sat in every inn who lets you sign up for whatever BGs you're eligible for.
---
as far as i know u can bubble while stunned
---
Bubble remove any cc
---
To me, T2 had SO many iconic sets. Obviously Paladin is No 1. But Mage and Warlock are fantastic looking. Priest is great. Rogue like you mentioned.
---
The warrior shark stuff is memorable although I prefer T1. The Druid set is very thematic. Hunter set it great.
---
Really only warrior and shaman are not-awesome. But they're still good looking. T2 is the best collection of class sets by far imo
---
You can bubbke while stunned
---

You need "sourcing" to know why griefing is more negative than the supposed "meaningful interaction" (read; griefing) of world PvP?
---
LMAO
---
(As an aside, I'm very anti-leftist, so let's agree on that point and leave it out.)
---
I had a T1/T2 resto druid @ Nost:
---
Get some green/blue healing gear from quests or AH and start healing 5 man dungeons and collecting pre-raid BiS items. Go resto or stay feral if you wanna play PvP. Make money with your profs. Find a nice guild with nice people to talk and play with. Cheers!
---
You don’t push miss off the table. You reduce miss with gear that says “increase your chance to hit by x%”. 
---
Article unnecessary. If you want to avoid the toxicity of world PvP, play on a PvE server. Simple.
---
Its 25% + the base 5% so closer to 1/3 than 1/4
---
Spec as a healer, grind out pre raid bis as well as actually raids like mc and zg, from there aq and naxx. Grind and grind till your hearts content.
---
It's a vanilla wow question about a private server. Sorry but no.
---
CoT, Kara, BMH and even ZA could be added on to Classic and could be a nice addition after a year or two. Not sure how the lore would work though, were the actions of the infinite dragonflight independent to Outland activities in TBC?
---
Dwarf hunter, fuck everyone I have hidden grinding spots.
---
By that logic only people who actually played vanilla should play classic. 
---
i started in bfa and still had to work my way up, so that really isnt true (unless you use the booster, which most people won't)
---
Yeh from memory it was like 400-800 per piece. 
---
He was guildless and had better gear than 98% of people.
---
Great year =/= next year will be good.
---
Major companies are all trimming excess fat at the moment. It is a natural cycle. You must expand your view and consider future and past events.
---
Nintendo’s approach may stem from another company strategy. Perhaps they have a different approach to recruiting, meaning they hire less but also must let go of less personnel in the event of reduced income.
---
One could argue activisions approach is better since they gave more people jobs while Nintendo decided to not do excessive recruiting.
---
Mess up lore how?
---
So useful
---
nah, having one shaman be enh to provide the same utility as restor,  is actually better for other rshams,  cos they gear up quicker, cos obviously less rshamans competing for gear, and raid gearing up as a whole,. If you have an insane amount or rshamans, you'll never gear them up, and they will always drag behing in gear.
---
also enh taking on some rogue role in a melees group, making other melees more geared, cos enhs roll on a speicific mail gear and 2h.
---
So having one enh is actually good for the raid non ubertryhard guild.
---
Since the server is pvp, are the other players part of the experiment as well? Because I don't think many people would take the risk of dying just to gank you :D
---
I think some of the more noteworthy ones are:
---
* Each class has three talent trees (one for each spec) they can invest point in rather than an explicitly selected specialization. This means all skills are available to your character at any time, unless they are special ones that you unlock by investing in a tree. A mage, for example, can always use both fireball and frostbolt.
---
* No mount until level 40
---
* Your character has a skill level for each weapon type that will increase if you use it. If you've never used a one-handed mace until level 40, you will be missing a lot of hits until you level it up
---
* No personalised loot. If an item drops, only one person can get it.
---
* No loot with personalised stats (if some item has strength on it, it won't "disappear" if you're a warlock)
---
* No PvP-only talents or rebalanced numbers for PvP
---
* Arena does not exist. Only three battlegrounds (WSG, AB and AV) and world PvP
---
* No LFG tool, you have to form groups by contacting people through chat
---
* Every dungeon and raid has one difficulty
---
* Each raid dungeon is either a 25 player raid or a 40 player raid. You can't select the group size; it's predetermined by the dungeon itself.
---
I'd say overall the game is a bit simpler to understand when you're new. A particular dragon in a dungeon has a preset strength that doesn't depend on your group size or difficulty setting. It's always the same dragon. When that dragon drops a sword, the group decides who gets it instead of everyone getting a random item that they can only trade under some arbitrary conditions. It translates better to real life comparisons that way.
---
Can be useful to any one who will play on classic though if you take it as an hypothetical. 
---
Grinding in the shimmering flats forever
---
if you are social and good, its np. its all about making connection to people and being a reliable player. 
---
&gt; likely is it for a decent guild to take Enhancement Shaman
---
Not very likely. This spec kind of underperforms in raid environment, and even if they would decide to take one then it's going to be GM's friend or a guy which  minmaxes. 
---
All of those dungeons/zones belong to a later chapter in the story.
---
in 5man dungeons, need is need. Is it an upgrade for your mainspec and/or spec you're currently in the dungeon as: Then press need.
---
That being said, many raid-pugs will probably operate on the +1 loot system which basically means if you win an item, you wont be able to roll on loot against others who havnt gotten an item yet.
---
Yes but it has to be written as a hypotethical otherwise it's against this subreddit's rules.
---
Not an experienced player, but I will say what I know. Warriors are indeed not strong in 1v1 matchups. You will need to be very skilled, have good gear and preferably some luck and engineering as well in order to be *able* to beat *anyone*. However, pairing a warrior with a healer is a whole another story...
---
Warriors have high armor, HP and damage, but what they lack is the ability to regain their health and strategic position once badly damaged, frozen in place, etc. The ideal pocket healer for a warrior fits the following ideals:
---
* Have the ideal heals, including fast and slow heals and idealy a hot
---
* Have tools to deal with CC / have CC on your own / both
---
* Have abilities beside heals to keep them safe and alive
---
***Paladin*** is indeed a great choice for a pocket healer, because paladins fulfill each of the points quite well. They don't have a hot, but they do have strong heals through their fast *flash of light* and their heavy (and still quite fast, with a 2.5 sec cast time) *holy light.* If specced into holy, they can have a guaranteed crit on their next heal, which is pretty neat. They can bubble themselves or the warrior, they can free the warrior from a freeze using BoF, they can stun people using hammer of justice, they can use their *lay on hands* from time to time, etc. But the strongest thing about paladins is, that they are very hard to kill. They can wear plate, allowing them for some nice defense against those anti-healer rogues (but of course against pretty much anyone in melee as well). They can heal themselves very quickly, can use their blessings to keep themselves out of sticky situations and even bubble or lay on hands if things go really into shit. If the enemy doesn't go for the paladin, but for the warrior, then paladin can easily negate most of the damage. 
---
***Priest***, however, is also a very strong choice and the best choice for a pocket healer on Horde side and arguably even on both sides. They too have strong heals *and* they have a dot as well! In fact, the strongest one in the game! Their CC is weaker, because they don't have any blessings, but that doesn't mean priests are that weak in terms of defense! They have power word: shield, psychic scream, inner fire, renew and additional talent abilities like holy nova or mind flay to be a bit more useful besides their healing. It is true paladins are harder to kill, but priests can be tough nonetheless. Especially on Horde, where UD get their heal through a dot (removable by dwarves btw) and Trolls get the superb unique ability of Shadowguard, which they can combine with Blackout to fuck all the rogues and pretty much all melee classes out there!
---
At the end of the day, if you or your friend are really looking for the min-max best pocket healer, then I would say go Paladin on Alliance and Priest on Horde. Some people may disagree, but be aware both classes are the best choices for a pocket healer.
---
You ain't never seen a gnome then. 
---
A lot of raid groups, if they’re willing to accept an enhance shaman, will get them to use Nightfall to buff caster dps as well.
---
Pre lvl 50 your bubble only lasts for 10 sec, and hearthstone has a 10sec cast, with the global cooldown in between a good player has plenty of time to interrupt your cast as your bubble fades away.....
---
Seems fair enough! :P  To be honest, the reason I assumed what happened is that I actually read too fast and missed it too, so when I read your message, I had to go back up and check, and there it was, ha.
---
That's my secret. I already want to die.

First of all, choose a PVE server, the risk of ganking is always there. 2nd, obviously hunter or warlock for leveling. Always look for others to help you out, and dont pull or do anything that is higher than 2 levels than you.
---
Or just go ERP in goldshire.
---
Thanks for all the advice it really helped
---
I’m split on how I feel about private servers. On one hand people playing them is what proved that there was still a strong interest in classic WoW. On the other hand private servers are just not the same and need to be separated from the classic conversation. Private servers are so inaccurate in many different ways I’ve already seen a lot of bad knowledge floating around. It doesn’t help when most of the content creators putting out stuff have never actually played the game other than on private servers. I keep seeing all these guides telling people stuff that only works on private servers. 
---
I don't get this. Is this supposed to be a joke or an insult? Pepega
---
Very few enh shammies actually have a smart gearing plan which does not interfere with other classes. 
---
Most of them want warrior/rogue gear for WF oneshots in PvP, further exacerbating the unwillingness to take them in raids. 
---
this
---
I too came to this conclusion
---
Classic is actually much easier than any other era of WoW to me, personally.  But the reason people say the opposite, and why they're also right, is because in Classic the difficulty floor is incomparably higher than in post-Cataclysm WoW but the difficulty ceiling is incomparably lower than in post-Cataclysm WoW.
---
In other words, while levelling, similar level enemies will pose a very serious challenge, and this holds true through all dungeons as well.  Even at max level, similar level enemies shouldn't be taken nearly as lightly as they are in WoW since Cataclysm.
---
However, compared to anything hard in WoW since Cataclysm, like raiding or top level dungeons, Classic is almost completely braindead easy except Level 60 Naxxramas.  I won't yet claim (until I play) that it's quite as bad as LFR but almost.  For now, I'll say it's like something exactly between LFR and Normal difficulty of WoW raids today.
---
Other than just the gameplay difficulty, which is all I've been describing, you really ought to be more specific, no offense, so that you can understand more because there everyone cares about different things in any given video game.  Each era of WoW is different enough to be almost like their own, separate games.
---
Both
---
Heyo. Couple ideas here...
---
1. Learn if any of your **buddies** will play. If so - and if they are willing - you should play on the same server!
---
2. Decide what **class**, **faction** and **race** you want to be. People have many ways of choosing their class. You can spend hundrets of hours searching for the optimal choice for yourself and still feel undecided, or just look back and tell yourself which is the coolest. Depends on how 1337 you want to be ;)
---
3. **Wait**. For real. Playing on private servers might give you some insight on leveling, but that is useless and might harm the ultimate nostalgic feeling of playing the game again, unless you are going for server 1st level 60 or the like. You won't really reach much now anyways. We can't recommend private servers around here. If you have a lot of free time, you can watch videos and streams.
---
4. And of course the **obvious one**: be sure you have access to your account. Setting up subscription might also be a bit different.
---
Otherwise, have fun! 
---
Cheers!
---
I mostly meant the raids. I think it's assumed in the games lore that your character is the adventurer who defeated all the bad boys along the years and that's why you're regarded as the champion that your character in in Legion/BFA.
---
I mean, yeah, you can go back now to blast through MC/BWL but in the classic you really get the chance to be the pleb traveler who makes his way to conquer those places.
---
You shouldn't stress yourself out trying to step on the moderators toes.
---
By killing 19801 boars
---
Why not just play heal? I mean you are still a support class especially if you spec into imp totems for melee group. You are both a buff bitch and heal bitch and it's actually a pretty fun playstyle. Similary in PVP you spec elemental and you are really a great mix between big burst offense, boosting your warriors dps, and healing people when needed. 
---
In classic you aren’t even a fraction of the hero you are in bfa, even after you kill cthun. I still get “that merchant doesn’t like you.” Sad.
---
If you can play the moment servers come up, speed level - other people speed levelling won't bother with pvp, and if your life was on the line playing for 48 hours straight isn't really an issue.
---
You'll be in the top 20 levelers on the server, and those people don't want to pvp.
---
That epic eye that drops from the demons in winter spring for Benediction. I forget the name but by god it took me months to farm. 
---
Easily the greatest gaming achievement I’ve ever had when that quest was complete. 
---
Simply cannot wait to go again!
---
See all of you degens online
---
I would be either warrior druid or rogue.. and make big raids to level and hunt around.. never stay alone somewhere in case PKers come.. 
---
no changes don't want the game to be harder they just want... the fucking game
---
Yea, expect an MMO, not just an rpg with other players
---
I'm intending to level a gnome mage. I understand that Tailoring and Engineering is the ideal combination of professions but, of course, engineering requires materials.  What is the best way to get round this?
---
My ideas are a) farm gold, buy ores etc and level engineering this way.
---
b) Level up as tailoring and mining and just bank everything I mine. Ditch mining for engineering at 60 and at least i've got a headstart on some of the materials.
---
c) Just don't do tailoring as maybe it's not that much of a big deal until ZG anyway? Consider dropping mining for tailoring at this point.
---
I will be playing on an RP/PvE server (I know, I know, but my life is what it is and this works best for me. Shame as it is) if that impacts the decision at all.
---
The reason I want engineering is because I like the idea of going the extra mile with mech pets and bombs and, being gnome, it just fits thematically.
---
Yes and no.
---
It's a game and it's war. You can use every dirty trick you want. 
---
But on the otherhand, sometimes it's a lot of fun when you CAN cheat, but you decide to respect the opponent and play fair. 
---
Really interesting thought, me like.
---
Its already hard to decide what class/race combination to pick.
---
Gnome would be wise as youre pretty small and easy to miss.
---
About class? Everything but warrior I guess. Paladin has strong survival and bubble could save you up really hard. Hunter Overall Utility and easy to Level. Shaman Utility and kite potential. Druid strong Utility, STEALTH!, healing. Rogue ... well stealth. Mage god of pvp and easy to Level, warlock pretty much the same and priest ... healing I guess.
---
I think the best Thing to go for ... would be either nightelf hunter, tauren shaman or Gnome/undead mage.
---
Nightelf hunter can go stealth, hunter is really easy to Level, you can use your pet to Scout if needed, eagle eye to Scout by yourself, you dont Need so much gear (dungeons/Group or contested quests) to Level smoothly and can pull of quite something in pvp.
---
Shaman is really about the Utility, being able to interupt/deny casters via shock/totem is pure Gold, instant wolf + frostshock for melee kites is dope aswell. Tauren would be just for the stomp to allow you a retreat. Leveling can be a bit annoying though, also quite gear dependant.
---
Mage has great ways of survival/retreat, Gnome and undead can cancel CC, leveling is easy, not much gear required.
---
About the playstyle ... well I guess I would Keep that items of eagle/monkey/bear to be able to survive a rogue stunchain and would just go for defensive / big health pool. Most likely a shield as shaman and go for enhancer with survival stuff (+armor, dodge, instant wolf etc). Hunter ... not sure if maybe survival would be better to have more ... well survival. The CDs can really save you there, but so can scattershot / pet stun. Not sure here. Mage is pretty obvious to go frost.
---
to be continued ...
---
And did it have pre-defined spawn locations? If so, then the playerbase it fucked up.
---
It's not specific about any particular private server at all, though. It's relevant to vanilla wow in its entirety. So IMO it belongs here, as it's interesting for others who may be interesting in playing a Druid but not sure what they'll be doing at 60.
---
I don't think the Nintendo comparison is really applicable here.
---
I don't want to sound callous or disrespectful to the people who lost their jobs, but its important to note that Nintendo doesn't have anyone have an esports department. I'm not sure how to prove this, but I also don't think Nintendo had as many as community managers as Blizzard does. 
---
One thing about questing. You may find a quest in one location completely unrelated to the location of the following quests in the chain.
---
I.e. A quest in thunder bluff that would take you to silver pine and start a 14 quest chain with a blue item reward.
---
Oh yea, you also get to look forward to the color of your item text actually matters. If you get a blue item in your 20’s you will be thinking about it after you log off. And when you get your first epic, you will wanna tell your significant other who doesn’t care in the slightest 
---
Horde can't attack Alliance in Elwynn Forest unless the Alliance attacks first.
---
Yeah it might fragment the community a lot. Might also just be a nice way to clear off the people not needed for the 25-man raids. 
---
How is ATVI a monopoly? They have tons of competition.
---
Huh.
---
Go down the arms tree. Fury works too, but tactical mastery for example is just such a nice talent to have. Use slow two-handers. Use a swingtimer and kite between your hits to increase your survivability dramatically. Keep a one-hand and shield around for when you want to tank. 
---
Levelling in a "tank build" is really really bad. It increases your survivability a bit in solo play, but everything takes ages to kill. And you aren't better at all at tanking. The only thing limiting warrior tanking when levelling is rage generation, so the protection tree doesn't help you with that at all. 
---
OG barrens
---
How does uldaman belong to the 'current' vanilla story? It's just a dungeon really, having halls of origination in wouldn't be that far off. 
---
Or going to Karazhan after we did Naxx and got some staff fragments, I mean, it only makes sense.
---
The beauty of vanilla is that there isn't much story to begin with. Adding anything as, oh let's kill some dragons, would work just fine.
---
Every other class you'll be fighting for gear against will be out-dpsing you. If you're prepared for that and really want to then you do you.
---
When you make the group and everyone knows you're reserving it ahead of time then that comes down to you: they know what they signed up for.
---
Get yourself Nightmare and you will be invited to anything :D
---
I hope they re-release all that things into stores, maybe a revised version with "CLASSIC" under WOW logo, and with all that mistakes corrected
---
Do you mean he got to enter their raids and then pay to actually recieve loot?
---
Japanese companies actually treat their employees like family.  Sometimes too much so, and salaries can be poor at times, but overall one is given a career and is treated with respect for the most part.
---
American companies treat their employees like disposable units, to be replaced on a moment's notice.  Blizzard was once one of the better places to work, but I'm starting to have my doubts.
---
I said NOTHING, stop fighting my imagination with logic please :(
---
You using the beta  client? maybe its just buggy.
---
idk, maybe he wants to train for plumber's job?
---
Letting everyone level ahead of me and just twinking on my rogue at 19 for weeks :)
---
Blizzcon presentation. First phase has a couple of instances, second one has pvp rewards and bgs.
---
It doesn't need to be specific. Here's the rule, 
---
"Do not share or encourage the use of exploits, cheats, private servers, or other illicit game behaviour." 
---
The OP has shared his use of a private server, thus encouraging it. 
---
As I said, it can be written as a hypothetical. It might only seem like a minor difference but let one through the cracks and then the entire front page is full of questions from private server players that have migrated to this subreddit because it's more active. 
---
The games are barely even comparable. Dont take anything you know from legion.
---
Could you get by to 60 fine with only quest reward weapons and dungeon drops? Here are just a few two-handers which, although might not all be the best options available at the time, will keep you going quite nicely. I believe there's also a decent weapon in BFD to get between SMH and WW axe?
---
18+: Smite's Might Hammer
---
30+: Whirlwind Axe
---
32+: Thermaplugg's Left Arm
---
34+: Bonebiter
---
37+: Ravager
---
And then afaik Uldaman, Maraudon, Sunkern Temple, ZF, BRD etc. all provice decent options for a leveling warrior.
---
Explain
---
You don’t remember the first 10 levels of hunter, do you?
---
This is me every break at work, browse the subreddit looking for interesting new news or in depth discussions.
---
3 Questions about rules:
---
1. Logging out is possible or denied ? since ... well you cant really log out, unless its just black and the timer goes on.
---
2. Is the Server a fresh one or do we Need to fear 60s running around ganking others? I think a fresh one would be more fair to be honest.
---
3. Group playing allowed? Its one Thing to search for a certain quest, travling together from 1-60 is something different.
---
Another simple thought ... how about you do that as a Group? Actually ... that would really Change the subject, holy moly. 3 Man Group you are allowed ... now who is going to take what? Are you really giving that Stamina item to your friend or are you scared because you yourself dont have so much health then? Why should I go priest and be squishy, just because we Need healer? Should we really try to do the groupquest or go a dungeon?
---
At first I was thinking Hunter for quick leveling and escapability, but I realized that I would definitely go NE Druid and creep around Azeroth leveling in corners of zones where nobody seems to go.
---
Definitely run Stockades for as long as the dungeon yields experience since it has a safe entrance and in the event of an imminent wipe you can sprint out in cat form and survive.
---
Consumables of all kinds for sure.
---
There would be a lot of down time stealthing through zones.
---
Option A if you are grouping with friends and B if you are not.
---
There is an option C : grouping up with someone who is NOT your friend but proves to be a really nice person. In this case you start with B, and move to A after you become friends.
---
At 51, your worth honor. It's no longer a gank. 
---
For sure, I would totally skip STV. That place is a deathtrap!
---
Hunter - only move from one flare to another.
---
But yeah ... rogues would be the most annoying things.
---
Yeah that was much nicer lol.
---
I think it's a better discussion to have 2-3 years after classics release. So let's pretend it is 2-3 years later. I genuinely think Blizzard lacks the creative ability to recreate Kara/CoT/HFP/Azshara, etc the way they were originally planned to be. Completely different people are now designing the game than the people from 15 years ago. I fear the modern Blizzard design process would just hinder any non-vanilla additions to classic. It's already present in the form of loot trading and auto-reporting.
---
In an ideal world where Blizzard had the same vision from the WC/vanilla days, I'd love to see these added to the game, but I fear the reality is the company in its current form doesn't have what it takes
---
Stealth really shines in that Scenario ...
---
Kite Mobs via serpeant sting to Citys :P?
---
I paid 250g for my T2 shoulders (which no rogue wanted) at a top guild because my own guild stopped raiding and I wanted to complete the  set.
---
250g was the minimum cost, items like DFT and Lok'amir would cost like 2k gold. 
---
What makes you guys post about your fears and activision blizzard every day until launch ?
---
Because you are bored and there is nothing else to do.
---
For me, the Quel'Serrar quest book (unless I get a guild group to farm for, and get it relatively fast), Medallion of Grand Marshall Morris and Stonegrip Gauntlets.
---
Might as well drop some gold on BoE plate bracers with defense (blues or even T1), or a + defense blue  ring.
---
Freezing bands are world drop rings that stack and have a chance to freeze an enemy that hits you.
---
\+ some darkmoon fair trinkets and maybe flask recipes.
---
Like two days ago a friend said he got freezed by attacking a druid with freezing bands. 
---
Depends on how would they like to monetize it. Microtransactions aren't a big problem per se, cosmetics, novelty items or stuff like realm tranfers don't really affect gameplay itself.
---
Level boosts or increased RP rates for money isn't really a big deal IMO. Even though that is probably debatable.
---
Gold for money could ruin in-game economy for players, so that's something I'd definitely don't want to see.
---
Lootboxes with rare items is what could kill the game completely.
---
I hope they won't be too greedy, but year 2019 is very different time compared to 2005-2006 when it comes to game monetization.
---
I think a fresh Server would also be better.
---
Having to choose to go fast/risky or slowly/safer makes it even more intersting.
---
Then people will abandon them, Classic is their last chance of getting back some goodwill.
---
Yes, people are bored and there's not much else to discuss. Do these topics bother you too much? Why?
---
I know that sometimes it seems that people want to see classic fail. And I would really like to see it succeed, but I think that these concerns are very real unfortunately.
---
Be mage, get to lvl 46, solo grind instances for quick lvl 60.
---
Westfall/ wetlands to lvl 25, darkshire Worgen to 35ish, then comes the fun part. 
---
Badlands near uldaman for quick retreat into thelsamar. Grind elites till 40.
---
Go Hinterlands - grind wolves in blinkrange of wildhammer base. 
---
Never STV.
---
Lvl 46 - aoegrind turtles and worms in maraudon until lvl 52.
---
Lvl 52 grind diremaul lashers till 60. Buy invis pots for Dungeon gates transfer. 
---
Reward: be alive, have epic mount. 
---
Stockade Pauldrons are nice for tanking. I’d also cop a Krol Blade if Teebu’s isn’t available. Maybe an Ebon Hand for the OH.
---
I can't not post this:
---
https://youtu.be/upAcVDxEn98?t=14
---
Exactly, you might get the advantage of gearing up your resto shams easier, but you really dont want to give war/rogue gear to enh shams. So what do you do with them? Kind of an awkward thing to deal with.
---
I level in the safe zones until all the mobs are grey. I never do dungeons, since you're putting your life in the hands of some moron on the internet.
---
I'd probably play BM hunter. Night Elf, with a cat. So we can stealth it up. 
---
I'd only come out at night too. Probably do a LOT of grinding around towns with guards and avoid most quests. Avoid Darkshire and STV like the plague. Probably level in the Night Elf zones as much as possible since nobody ever goes there. 
---
Stay in the forest.... killing boars
---
In the limited scope of GM interactions I think you'd be surprised. We're not talking about general AI here, really just an amped up chat bot. I'll bet current AI would probably fool most people. 
---
WHy would acti care about some passion project then they are too focused on whatever candy crushes and whatnot
---
Yea seriously, where did this mentality that classic=PvP come from? Is it because most pservers are PvP or something?
---
Somebody hasn't seen the Google Duplex demo...
---
&gt;On the other hand private servers are just not the same and need to be separated from the classic conversation
---
Do you think that OP's question doesn't belong in Classic WoW discussion? I think that everything not directly related to pservers can be a part of Classic's discussion.
---
I would say, however, that people shouldn't post guides or other material based on info from pservers. As most people know that everything on pservers has to be taken with a grain of salt. Some spells might not work 100% correctly, stats might be slightly inaccurate etc.
---
Yes, and you should be burned at the stake!  
---
How dare you take away from the social aspects of the game?  
---
You must be one of those LFGers!  
---
^^^^/s
---
Not sure why people are downvoting you when you're totally right.
---
Most of those are replaced pretty early on so I wouldnt bother with them unless I'm rich.
---
Blue dragon trinket for healers yea, definitely.
---
Only do dungeons (besides beginning uncontested zones) so I can play safely and still quickly while instanced. 
---
If other people are playing normally, I’ll probablt just constantly be annoying and depend on being summoned. Probably as a Druid, so people will have demand for my tanking and healing and I’ll be able to get away with it. Plus I’ll have stealth, so I might be able to go to entrance if I really have to. If I can’t get groups, I can probably still kill some mobs for xp.
---
level boosts in a game that most of the game is the leveling and not endgame... that would be a game breaker for me atleast.
---
agree on the other items. except for the cosmetics, against transmog.. should be able to see what you fight against :)
---
&gt; Real life scam, go to the police, but they will probably say that's on you too
---
[They will file a report, and start an investigation.](https://youtu.be/Y3i6Jb7K4O4?t=11)
---
Tauren druid. Stay stealth and farm mobs in remote corners of the world. Green lvl mobs that pose no threat to you is your target. If you get spotted run immediately. If you get caught by a rogue or something stun -&gt; root -&gt; run -&gt; heal/stealth. Stack health and armor. 
---
You do not want to group up cause there might be lvl 60's on the other faction that want to gank you.
---
And when the game closes down or you stop playing for the last time, the stories will be all you have left, so what's wrong with wanting those stories?
---
Rogue, pick weeds, break rocks, pet battles, sneaky sneaky, win.
---
"issues"
---
b
---
Not an RPer but would imagine classic is great for it 
---
PvE Server, play hunter. Easily get to 60 without one death if you play reasonably safely. Your pet will die for you every time and you just run away.
---
Few pointers for newbie warriors:
---
- Rend is actually pretty good during lvls 1-40. After that you can mostly skip it though due to Mortal strike or bloodthirst.
---
- Hamstring/kite/swingtimer playstyle is mostly for experienced advanced players. If it is your frst time playing warrior, just focus on the essentials. Kill 1 mob at a time. Only use heroic strike as a rage dump (when full rage). Try to stack up rage for the next mob if possible. If specced into arms, get Anger management, it got a hidden bonus of 1 rage ever 3 seconds during combat.
---
- KEEP AWAY from prot until 60. Go arms or 2h-fury. Dualwield fury is kinda bad during lvling due to the fact that you dont get +hit on any gear during lvling.
---
- Get Whirlwind axe as early as possible. Ravager is also an okay alternative but lack of stats is a buzzkill when lvling. Warriors should try to get str and stam on all gear pieces when lvling. Also 2h-axe from SM quest for alliance is an excellent alternative. Any of these weapons will last you into your mid-late 40s or even early 50s.
---
I think all the worries partly stems from the way retail has headed and also because of the lack of information regarding pretty much anything related to the development since blizzcon.
---
Not sure all of these things are in Vanilla wow.
---
Too many grammar errors.
---
By cosmetics I didn't mean transmog. I meant fancy tabards, shirts, and normal (white) quality items which give no bonus stats, so mostly RP-related stuff.
---
&gt; And I would really like to see it succeed, but I think that these concerns are very real unfortunately.
---
I think classic devs know what the community wants and based on that and requirements of their current server and client outlines they try to make it close as possible. Writing "this will kill classic" posts daily doesnt change anything, from a youtuber point of view i understand that you are trying to get views, but spamming it to reddit...
---
I know i will play the game no matter what is released, based on the fact that its NOT run by volunteers on donations and subjected to abuse. Paying gives me also the right to demand certain level of service and support.
---
Until release, i will continue playing on private servers.
---
Didn't they say that they had some news soon tm. Mostly i think that they aren't saying anything because there isn't anything worthwhile to say. 
---
While i say that i do still think that more communication would be better, but that has rarely happened ever.
---
I'd say WoW turned retarded during Wrath, specifically the BadgePlz patch. If you look at sub growth that's also where it levels off and even starts to drop.
---
Is it a fresh server? Is it like SAO? Because there's really nothing you can do to prepare for being ganked by a max level char. However, if you are one of many people starting out on a fresh server, you can pick a class that quickly out levels everyone (Feral Druid/Hunter) and then you really only have to deal with the environment, which shouldn't be a problem.
---
I think people worry too much about this. I don't blame anyone for worrying, this has never been an easy ride, but I don't think we should be worried about this precise issue.
---
The investors haven't been told that classic is a major project. Ion has stated they want to remain as true to the original experience as possible. Even Ythienes as an ex employee has said in a recent stream that everyone working on classic wants to be there, that it is a passion project.
---
What I could see happening is expecting you to buy BfA to unlock classic. I don't agree with it but I can certainly understand them wanting to recoup their investment and make BfA sales look better to investors.
---
Also what I could see happening is making the Landro Longshot (TCG) items available as micro transactions, and possibly previous Blizzcon attendance items as either micros or deluxe edition items. Since these were cosmetic items that were available in vanilla I can't see what harm that would do.
---
If they introduced post-vanilla or pay to win items then absolutely that wouldn't be on, but going back to the start of my reply, I just don't think that's going to happen. 
---
Novelty is a really good word for the Cata old-world refresh. The vanilla world was great because every zone felt like it's own place. Each zone had its own local population and conflicts. With the Cata revamp, every zone was all about the impact of the Cataclysm, it made the world feel like a much smaller homogeneous place.
---
&gt; would acti care about some passion project
---
$$$ ...the question is if the Activision will continue(?) to see it as a passion project or if they'll at some point try to milk as much money from it as they can.
---
&gt; Do you think that OP's question doesn't belong in Classic WoW discussion?
---
I believe the one you're answering to isn't saying that, just that private servers are inaccurate so people shouldn't base their knowledge on them.
---
&gt; most people know that everything on pservers has to be taken with a grain of salt
---
I wouldn't be so sure about this, unfortunately.
---
thats so stupid lmao
---
Pasting comment from another thread.
---
Go to your game folder, find the WTF folder, open the config.wtf in notepad and find the line
---
SET gxResolution "1600x1200"
---
and change it to
---
SET gxResolution "1920x1080"
---
You never wiped in a dungeon ? :-D
---
Well the subs are linked so theyll get more money trough that anyway, but i still don't think that they will throw lvl boosters and whatnot to there.
---
We can all always go back to private servers, which as of now is shaping out to be a better product than what Classic may end up being. Classic only helps the private server community with corrected data, while we'll receive progressive itemization, progressive timelines, necessary economic nerfs, and more.  
---
Time will tell...
---
I'm honestly not sure, haven't followed to closely for the past month. I do disagree a little with you though. Judging by all the community discussions regarding the different decisions, sharding, loot trading etc. I think that alot of what goes on in the Blizzard offices would actually be worthwhile sharing.   
---
But i also agree that the whole discussion can get a little hyperbolic and pessimistic.   
---
Any extra information in it that isn't online?
---
If this was a new game, lack of information would indeed be quite odd. But its a old game released on new client. A lot of the work they do isnt very exiting news to us, like confirming that out of the xxxx number quests they have gone through and tested 84%. Or that the lamp post light color is now fixed.
---
The thing they could announce is certain questions like loot trading, phasing, server capacity etc, but some of these are linked to each other. I suspect they do another stresstest that will ultimately decide capacity, phasing ...
---
And the real announcement that ppl want is the release date. Until they have the locked down, i dont see them doing separate announcements. Still thinking its going to be in GDC 2019. Perfectly timed for information before summer, its in San Francisco.
---
Biggest thing is that you've not go to read the quests or if you don't feel like doing that, have wowhead open on a second monitor
---
Roll rogue. Die in glory in STV
---
Shaman are in general stacked like 5-8 out of 40. So i would say it is possible but there is gonna be pressure on you to go resto. You might be considerd a black sheep and it can cause drama if the guild ever gives you any gear. This is the basic gist of it. 
---
Also you will be very low on the dmg meters even if you go max effort and it will only get worse with gear.
---
kinda wanna say rogue, but then i also think that id do a mage just for the experience.
---
We stay in the forest, killing boars.
---
&gt;youtuber point of view i understand that you are trying to get views, but spamming it to reddit...
---
I agree that this doesn't really bring any value, but discussion like this one is something a bit different. But yes, they shouldn't be spammed too much either.
---
&gt;I know i will play the game no matter what is released, based on the fact that its NOT run by volunteers on donations and subjected to abuse. Paying gives me also the right to demand certain level of service and support.
---
I want to at least try classic for some time, I hope we will get more info from devs about what are their future plans with Classic though.
---
#NoChanges . That includes any and all changes.
---
It  might not be a new game in essence, but in practice it is a different story. They have the data values yes, but how are they implementing it? I loved reading the dev watercooler post, thought it was interesting getting a bit of insight into redeveloping such an old game. I think pretty much any sort of information would be welcomed by many people.  
---
Regarding the questions your refer to, maybe they should do polling. Or in some other way gather real data from the expected playerbase about what they think about sharding etc.  
---
And maybe the release date wouldn't be so important if the Blizzcon demo hadn't seemed so lacking in a lot of areas.   
---
&gt;I think classic devs know what the community wants 
---
I guarantee you that Retail devs know what the community wants as well. 
---
I worked customer support (billing, not GM) for Blizzard in Cork during MOP, and the Devs had very little input into the direction the game was going. Those decisions are made by suits, not nerds. 
---
Only using monitors? What year is this. 2018?
---
&gt; Classic only helps the private server community with corrected data
---
Huh, good point. 
---
My private server dropped from a stable 300-400 people every night to around a 100 since the announcement, I hope we can get those players back once Activision's greed eventually destroys Classic. 
---
There already will be changes so... they have stated as much. 
---
&gt; Regarding the questions your refer to, maybe they should do polling
---
Tbh, i see it like this. Read the community concerns and suggestions. And then do what THEY think is the best course of action honoring the old game.
---
Fuck no, i dont want people have a vote how the game should be changed. When devs just start do changed based on the guys that shout the most, you will get retail.
---
Second great videogame crash when?
---
I agree, blizzard only job is only to not make classic worse than private servers. So far it dosn't look that promising with sharding, indirectly nerfed content, loot trading etc...
---
People want classic vanilla. They know what it is. They have the game ~ready. Suits want least money spent on the dev time and fastest possible release. 
---
But classics success depends on the game being as close to vanilla as possible. There is no "direction" in development. You are trying to do a carbon copy on the new servers and clients.
---
I'm with you, but retail is also a symptom of a trend in the whole field of gaming and the merge with activision, i feel. And honestly the guys that shout the loudest is the ones on the forums, however in a poll every vote is of equal value. I agree that it is not the best, or maybe not even a good, way to do it. But I also think that any sort of reaction from Blizzard would be good. Especially now that we have  forums that are anxious about everything in regards to implementation.
---
Anything is a gank if you're attacking someone who isn't expecting it and kill them.
---
Not sure I'd blow nature's grasp to drink personally. 
---
100% orc
---
Just because he is from BlizzCon doesn’t mean he can’t be vanilla. He’s the guy who knows everything so that’s why I think he should be the most. Do you know for sure red shirt guy didn’t play vanilla?
---
I'm in the same boat. I would prefer NA and I can only play late night. 11pm PST starting time would be preferred. Let me know if you find anything
---
You had ranks of every skill. Up yo 10 ranks for some of them. 
---
Honestly the game time tokens in the AH arent that bad. It doesnt generally affect the economy, allows good players to save money, and to pay for alts and Activision still get their $$. The only acceptable microtransactions imo.
---
Nothing, they'll release it without anything in the start but after a month or two they'll reveal some shitty ingame store for cosmetics, mounts etc. 
---
Then when people abandon them they'll say "SEE IT WAS JUST NOSTALGIA" and then start sending cease and desist to every single wow private server, no matter what expansion that private server is playing on and argue that "WELL YOU HAVE THE REAL WOW HERE WHY NOT JUST PLAY THAT? THE OLD TBC/WOTLK ETC CONTENT IS STILL AVAILABLE" and just generelly be ignorant of the entire situation and not understand why people hate them.
---
I'm a warrior,so yeah i'm fucked
---
Be a rogue and enjoy 45 days of gankibg lowbies, and stalking people till they low health then kill them as they start to eat
---
Nice try buddy, that's dlc 
---
Imo very unlikely. And since Stormstrike takes up a debuff slot, I am not even sure if your rotation would be anything but auto-attacks and keeping up totem buffs.
---
Might as well go resto then.
---
Because people will just leave for private servers, including a gigantic shitstorm. 
---
After the last month's, I don't know what they would want to accomplish with micro transactions. 
---
In short, Vanilla for me is World-PvP
---
Aren't we all playing in glorious #nochanged 800x600??!? /s
---
I mean you can critique the style but the actual content brings up good points. It blows for people who choose a server that’s ends up being the same one a huge streamer chooses. 
---
I wonder how much the developers have thought about how big streamers will effect gameplay for everyone. 
---
Yeah, why would Activision care about money. 
---
"This token would only make us a couple of millions, the goodwill of oldschool players is so much more important to us!"
---
Yeaaaah, no. Hunter before level 10 dies more often than 10-60 put together.
---
No pet.
---
&gt; they'll say "SEE IT WAS JUST NOSTALGIA" and then start sending cease and desist to every single wow private server, no matter what expansion that private server is playing on and argue that "WELL YOU HAVE THE REAL WOW HERE WHY NOT JUST PLAY THAT? THE OLD TBC/WOTLK ETC CONTENT IS STILL AVAILABLE"
---
Yeah, exactly what I'm expecting.
---
Rekt
---
Depends. Are you in enemy held territory? Are you somewhat low on health and will just need to book it and not fight if you actually get attacked? 
---
I agree with you that its better used infight for a crucial heal in duels and fair PvP, but in 99% ganks happen when you are at a disadvantage, therefore winning a fight from an ambushed position with 10% health left against  rogue are slim. 
---
Playing on a pvp realm, being worth honor to players, and not expecting?
---
Ok
---
The difficulty between classic and retail is totally different.
---
Classic is simpler when it comes to rotations and boss mechanics but has a lot of min/max parts of the game that are imo more complicated (stuff like gearing).
---
DPS is easier across the board with pretty easy rotations.
---
Tanking is much more involved as you actually have to fight for threat instead of how it is on retail where your job is essentially taunting on debuffs and keeping up your AM.
---
Healing is on the surface much more complicated in classic just because the amount of spell combinations but is generally top heavy and once you break through all the confusing "which rank to cast in which situation" it becomes a lot more manageable.
---
Generally classic is referred to as difficult because the lack of gear makes certain content much harder to access and be successful in.
---
TLDR; retail is more mechanically difficult and classic is more about knowledge and time investment.
---
ah, that's ok by most I believe :)
---
Your bigger concern would be a Warlock summoning in a doomguard. 
---
*Yeah, of course it’s a summoning portal...* 
---
I don't think we're talking about the same thing.
---
You underestimate the malice of others in WoW. 
---
gearing is more complicated in classic? nowadays you have tintanforging, azerite and what not. as what i have read back in the day you where very restricted in what is bis and what is not.
---
Nothing.
---
Died with a Giant Long Blue Female Part around me.
---
I mean, If you're probably gonna die anyway? What a way to go.
---
I have epic stories of the times I saved the day with good play, or fucked up and single-handedly wiped a raid. They'll do.
---
They probably will. I don't care if they do. 
---
Set BiS is easy but for certain classes (especially melee) it gets quite messy when looking at upgrades, where hit starts to drop off, where crit starts to drop off and how they all link with weapon skill rating is extremely vague.
---
Titanforging and azerite by comparison is obvious, you know which traits are BiS and it's easy to find out your stat weights.
---
This sounds a bit bonkers but have you tried running the game in windowed mode then just maximize it on the screen you want to run it on? Its not perfect but should be ok?
---
PS. Did you just confirm Beta?
---
Honestly I think they realize that if they try to do it everyone will just bail. They have shot themselves in the foot so many times lately, they kind of need this so we don't write them off entirely.
---
At this point I'm not spending another dime on Blizzard products, mostly because they are all shit and less so for ideological reasons. If they fuck this up I'm just putting them in the same bin as EA ideologically, which means they wont ever see my money ever again.
---
I'd venture to say there are many Blizzard vets who think similarly to me. 
---
Live to win!
---
It's not about him it's about his relevance to the community. Around the time of vanilla he wasn't famous at all.
---
[https://kotaku.com/nintendo-of-europe-will-lay-off-320-people-this-month-1627924242](https://kotaku.com/nintendo-of-europe-will-lay-off-320-people-this-month-1627924242) Nintendo had layoffs just around that period , it was just the personal in EU. People tend to forget this part :P
---
I'm not too worried, final fantasy 14 is pretty good if classic doesn't work out
---
German summer
---
Vanilla WoW PvP highly incentivized focus around the opening of a fight. Rogues are designed to capitalize on this portion of the fight.
---
I hate rogues - fighting and playing them - and I know it's true.
---
Pretty much. A lot of posters here think pirate servers are vanilla. They sometimes get offended when you say that massive overpopulation, dynamic respawns and no PvE option make pirate servers massively unlike real vanilla.
---
probably grind green mobs in remote areas outside of peak hours for a few months. 
---
This pretty much. The quality and accuracy of private servers these days are eons beyond what we saw in the early private servers days. Basically, ever since N*stalrius shut down, each iteration has only increased in quality and stability.
---
&gt; And honestly the guys that shout the loudest is the ones on the forums, however in a poll every vote is of equal value. 
---
Most wont bother to vote, so its going to be the guys complaining in the forums that DO vote.
---
And then a warrior took an afternoon off to make some friends and goes on wrecking tour 10v3 with his shaman and priest buddy. :(
---
Do you even realize how hard it is to get a piece of gear in a 40man raid? You might go weeks or months without getting a single piece of loot if you're unlucky. In retail WoW you are guaranteed to get gear from every single raid you do, not to mention that you have mythic dungeons that can provide you with great gear that is equal to raiding gear.
---
Titanforging is a useless argument since it's purely RNG and Azerite is just you running around doing the same dailies for months that barely anyone wants to do anymore because it's just a way for Blizzard to keep people "interested" in the game for longer (which clearly didn't work out well for them). You might aswell wait for a few months and do dailies then when the catch-up mechanic begins.
---
There's a reason why epics felt so awesome in vanilla.
---
Voiceing concerns is a good way to keep them on track aswell, assuming devs even read these forums (which I believe they actually do).
---
For raiding optimal feral druid has the most difficult rotation and farming requirements of any class in the game(and are only really viable on ally), powershifting and using MCPs on cd are the only way to put out numbers around what pure dps are capable of.
---
If you want to casually dps, you are very much on the low end of dps, and don't provide any buffs that can't be brought by a more useful class except LOTP which doesnt make up for not bringing a better dps.
---
It is common knowledge that horde has WAY more quests than alliance. (Around 15% more). And they have all the early zones packed together whereas alliance has to go all over the world to quest. 
---
Every speed leveler out there knows this. Joana has said many times that leveling horde was always significantly faster than alliance. 
---
On your last point there were 20-man and 40-man raids, but I believe there were also 10 and 15 man dungeons during certain patches. Like Scholo and Ubrs.
---
ok i am very exited to experience it by myself soon. thx for the answer
---
It’s interesting how my comment is 100% factual and yet there’s morons denying it because they don’t know about vanilla. 
---
It matters if the cosmetic stuff looks like absolute garbage and breaks immersion, like the current cosmetic stuff does.
---
Blizzard design has fallen far.
---
Smh... The good idea fairy just won’t go home and leave our beloved Vanilla game alone... No changes means no changes, and it DEFINITELY doesn’t mean adding some new feature to the game that never existed...
---
To all the folks that continue to get hit with the fairy’s wand all the time, please feel free to go and start your own gaming company and make all this stuff a reality in your own new imaginary world, but leave ours as it was always intended to be! 
---
SOON tm
---
&gt; It is common knowledge that horde has WAY more quests than alliance.
---
So its super simple for you to find that stat and proof your own first claim and not tell everyone else to proof you wrong, right ?
---
I hope, that Classic will reactivate so many dead subscriptions that it makes them realize that they went the wrong way with WoW. And if that doesn't make sure they don't screw up Classic I hope everybody just cancels their subscription straight away again. That will make them think twice on what they are doing.
---
You're not Debbie Downer you're Alexensual Apathetic. lol
---
For me, that depends on a lot of things. Did they want a 1v1? Did they perhaps pick a clean mobless area, bowed to each other and started fighting a fair fight? I let them duke it out.  
---
Did my faction ally just kill a mob and started to loot it when the filthy enemy ambushed them, and even as my ally is strong enough to start a fair fight, it's despicable how he got attacked, so  I go in to help.  
---
But it also depends on how your mindset is. I wouldn't expect a rogue to just sit around and wait it out, unless they are just observing. I'd imagine they would backstab any Red without thinking about the circumstances. A priest would be more inclined to run the hell away from any fight and hide(that's me).  
---
So to speak it's a bit of an RP decision, so if you want to play an honorable warrior/paladin, then you might not interfere.
---
But but but white two headed puppy dogs!
---
Basically, rubbish, from a dps perspective. Feral just wasnt in a good spot in classic. I say this as a devout feral from vanilla who was one of the guild's MTs as a bear, and was server first bear to tank raggy.
---
Cat form CAN do okay dps if you gear up hugely and master the complex rotation, but most guilds wont have more than one dedicated Feral and you'll be more useful tanking... end result is you'll probably be expected to heal. This is just how hybrids were in Classic. 
---
if you ONLY want to be a Melee DPS and you dont want to have to be forced to tank, and dont want to heal, and want a guaranteed raid spot, you basically HAVE to roll rogue.
---
The only alternative is Fury Warrior and they'll be expected to do lots of 5man tanking and likely raid offtanking too. Classic had these kind of expectations and there's no getting away from them realistically.
---
Probably you are right, I'm not disputing that. But I think that Blizzard could calm down alot of the wild rumors, discussions and frustration that is emanating from the forums. Personally I would love to hear some of the thoughts and processes the development team goes through. 
---
I didn't use food on any druid I've ever leveled so i guess I'm not the guy to ask. Didn't use water after level 40 on any druid either (2 vanilla, 1 private server)
---
Definitely going sub rogue and just stealth every where and kill every mage I see who is sitting down drinking. 
---
Oof. 
---
Stop playing shitty meme specs and go Resto.
---
Mine has 5000 on every day lol. 
---
This is a reasonable compromise. 2019 Blizz would never do it 
---
It would be interesting to see the value of WoW token in Classic, but I think for that same reason they won't implement it, but on the other hand what we all  should be worried is bots infesting WoW Classic with spam and AFK farming in WoW Classic and this will be present in Classic of course, and WoW token is kinda there to combat that, so without token and Blizzard already cutting on  their game masters / help support, it will be funny to see what happens with bots, because it  might just go to automation (report certain person X times).
---
And I think no one would be happy about that...
---
Just like Plebbit, eh?
---
Night elf doesnt have a pve advantage. Humans are the best alliance warrior race for pve it isn’t even a contest.
---
If your laptop has dual graphics, disable the Intel one through device manager. Then set the in-game resolution to maximized window mode. If you want consistent 144Hz you will need to enable vsync in game as well.
---
Enhancement isn't a viable raiding spec. You won't see a high level raiding experience. Maybe a guild would be willing to take you through bwl but post that your lack of damage doesn't offset your buffs you give melee. So no serious raiding guild will bring one. You're better off going resto and enhancement for fun on the side.
---
This is what we call an asshole haha.
---
battlegrounds
---
He doesn't mention ease of leveling. He could just as well mean which is more enjoyable, strongest, has the best quest rewards, best for leveling dungeons, etc. 
---
Classic is being developed from a stand point of a historical timecapsule, if it did not exist in vanilla days then it is unlikely to feature now. As bad as the Blizzard money grabbing has become over time I feel that it is unlikely to happen as it would destroy the project, which they are aware of, and stop it being a success.
---
for world pvp probably, but for bgs? Nah 
---
But I might hit classic while waiting. Relearn some macro management. 
---
Honestly just starting a character I know will be there forever. Hear me out, it won’t be like starting a private server, because those are always bound to change and leveling on private servers always felt a little pointless to me. It was fun to level on Nostalrius when it was up but after the Nost and Elysian Drama I’m still weary to ever level on a private server. With official Classic, I feel like I will be actually working towards a goal that won’t ever be altered, or skewed.
---
I dont get it? Why do people get SOOOO upset by the thought of wow tokens. I dont know if you guys experienced how it was before wow tokens. People were still buying tons of gold, just not from Blizzard. Wow tokens let Blizzard control the market price of gold. If it isnt wow tokens its gold sellers. There will always be people selling gold, if it isnt Blizzard its someone else.
---
I know the thought of people using the buy to win method sucks, but there is no way around it. If there is irl money to be made, people WILL abuse it.
---
Or you could just chill, play on private servers and let them finish the game. You could think of it the other way, if they released (more) info, it would lead more complaints and whining. People demanding changes.
---
Just finish the game and say here it is. Take it or leave it. They can do the thought process over at this years blizzcon seminar.
---
Game becomes P2W with tokens. WoW is built upon gold-earning being a major part of progression, if not the biggest. By allowing RTM you allow rich players to get much better simply because they payed more. That is the definition of P2W.
---
That's par. Imagine how hard these people are going to be dominated by the top tier of players in vanilla though.
---
&gt;What makes you optimistic that Activision won't milk Classic via Micro Transactions?
---
Because they don't care much about a sub-project to one of Blizzards oldest still active games. 
---
I'm pretty sure the higher-ups has little say in specific projects within Blizzard. They just give them directives, like needing to cut costs, approving new projects, that sort of thing. They don't go and say that Blizzard should put micro-transactions in specific games. At least that's what I believe. It's up to Blizzard how they do these things, and I don't think Blizzard will monetise classic to a very large degree. Game time tokens are a possibility, but level boosts won't happen, at most maybe some sort of bonus experience gain thing. They have never boosted characters to max levels in WoW, only to the lowest level of the new expansion (110 at the moment), and the lowest level in classic WoW is 1, so yeah. 
---
And while I don't want them to put the token system in classic, it would not ruin the game for me. People are always going to buy gold whether Blizzard supports it or not, so the actual effect that would have on the game is not very big. At least not big enough for me to care much. 
---
I'm pretty sure they will offer at least some character services though, like realm transfers. Maybe even race changes and stuff like that. But again, while I don't want them to put that in the game, I'm still going to be playing it regardless. 
---
Now that you say it, I did break and opened an account on one of these servers that shan't be named.  
---
And honestly the only reason I engage in these discussions is because I love to hear the different opinions of the players :)
---
Invisibility potions aren’t usable in combat. 
---
You should forget about dpsing as cat, tanking as bear isn't bad though. Maybe not good enough for MT, but can OT well.
---
Hmm Okey, I just feel like everyone and their parents will play warrior or rogue, but maybe I'm overestimating it.
---
Is a enhance resto Hybrid good in raids?
---
Hinterlands escort on a PvP server is best accomplished by a full 5-man party. Tanaris was not as bad because the escort route has less traffic. Still better to group up, though.
---
Rogues are the reason I still hear ‘fortunate son’ when I arrive in Stranglethorn Vale, from the borders of Duskwood... 
---
I will never play anything from Blizzard again, just delete everything and start a crusade to boycott their products.
---
&gt; indirectly nerfed content
---
I haven't heard this one yet. What is indirectly nerfed? 
---
Warrior 1-11 - Human - 02:07:17
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPBsAyzuZgM
---
Unlikely since they'd get only one chance to try it, and they must be 60 first.
---
Cats were upper middle tier DPS actually IF played optimally and you're willing to put a lot of effort into it (way above other classes). Your biggest issue will be groups accepting you with the general dogma that you can't dps.
---
So safe card for melee DPS is warrior or rogue
---
Sigh... I don’t care about that. 
---
Are u talking retail or vanilla? Vanilla would get destroyed and not work with game tokens for money
---
Epic BOE ring with +frost damage and +intellect. On top of that it has a 1% chance to freeze enemies for 10sec when attacked, super good ring especially for mages early on. Had one on my 60mage on nost, rip cudi :(
---
If your goal is end-game raiding only sure. You could try and forge a name for yourself early in UBRS runs etc and help combat the dogma on your server!
---
&gt;Or in some other way gather real data from the expected playerbase about what they think about sharding etc.
---
They don't really care though. They do sharding because they want stable servers and what not. And because they don't want overcrowding affecting how they think the game should be played. It's not because the playerbase wants it. While yes, this entire project is pretty much made because of fan demand, it's still the devs making the game, they are the ones deciding how things should turn out depending on what they think is best. Contrary to public opinion, especially on forums and such, fan-service is not always the "best" way to go. 
---
I'm not saying they are making the right decisions. But they are making their own decisions, which I honestly think is healthy. If it turns into a bad game then the devs did a bad job, but not necessarily because they didn't follow every demand of the fan base. 
---
Classic will be a lot more difficult. There is very little self healing where as in bfa/legion every class had some form of self sustain. You will for sure need to level first aid as well as get food from a mage or stock up on vendor food/water since regen is a huge issue in the game. Take it slow and enjoy the experience. Do all the dungeons and enjoy the community. Join a leveling guild and explore and make new friends it is a completely different experience. If you are on a PvP server don't be a bystander help those in need if they are getting attacked. 
---
Poop sock to 60 and be one of the first level 60 warriors on the server.
---
grind dungeons as rogue druid only group to ensure safe entrance. use consumables to cover short comings. 
---
I don't know, I remember how 10 years ago we'd rag on Nintendo for always releasing the same games over and over again and for cash grabbing.
---
I think it's just that some parts of the gaming industry have sunk so abysmally low that Nintendo looks great by comparison. 
---
Though, I suppose 10 years ago gamers were also a little bit spoilt perhaps. I don't know. In any case, the gems of the gaming industry today will be the companies what prioritise product/pride over short-term proceeds.
---
It's not like these companies don't exist but, man, we're really feeling the lack at the moment.
---
It adds another dimension to the game, on a PvE server you can go do some quests and grind mobs/ore/herbs and you never have to worry about anything side from the mobs, it's safe and there's no thrill. On a PvP server there's suddenly a risk, you venture out to grind some mobs and you never know if an alliance/horde might turn up whilst you're halfway done with a mob.
---
Without the anticipation of PvP and competition the open world seems a bit.. flat and one-dimensional.
---
You can always hold off on tailoring until max level. It really isn't a money-maker. You would be better off leveling with mining, which will support Engineering and you will be able to sell the stuff you don't need on the auction house, or to a vendor. You can also look up how much cloth you will need to level tailoring later on, and save whatever you obtain while leveling. By the time you're 60 you will most likely be running Scholo &amp; Strat a lot and you will get plenty of Runecloth there. Once you switch over to tailoring you can buy what you need (or from your stockpile) to do Engineering things.
---
Shit, so brainwashed from retail wow, completely forgot about server reputation
---
There were tons of German servers in Vanilla. I myself played on Blackhand (EU).
---
I'm pretty sure there will be language-specific servers come Classic Release. German, French, Spanish, Russian servers etc.
---
If you're founding a guild, you should probably already have a main tank in mind. In any guild that plans to raid, MT and OT need to be reliable and active guild members, and those guys need to know what they're doing.
---
Besides, you only need max 2 main spec tanks for the lower tier raids. It's not really that tanks are hard to recruit, it's that you should probably build your guild around them. There's a reason you rarely see guilds publicly having tank, especially MT recruitment open.
---
You must be new to all of reddit.
---
Find a guild and soak that delicious free gear! Most guilds don't have resto druids and are always looking for them since they are the least played class in vanilla wow. My full clear aq40 guild we have two druids one feral and one resto we are lucky if we have a 3rd druid in raids.
---
There were many german servers back then, i played on one of them, Frostmourne. Im pretty sure there will be german servers too if Classic launches.
---
yay for perception but that's only going to help so much
---
any good rogue i will never see coming
---
&gt;LOL, this is a joke right?
---
Reading comprehension issues? If the 60 rogue wants to kill you, he has to know that you are actually there. Like the trail of corpses point, if there's no dead mobs near the rogue, the 60 will have no idea someone is even questing in the area.
---
No it doesnt... high level gear and loot Is earned from pvp and PvM. And black market gold has and always will be cheaper. Because you are effectively buying gold directly from blizzard.
---
Trust me, it isnt Pay2win weve had it in osrs for years
---
nice i cant wait. thx
---
I found hbomberguy using an alias.
---
You're all assuming you are at risk of getting ganked all the time, but no one will even try to initiate with fear of getting killed themselves.
---
The exception would be people grouping up with direct intent of killing others. Your best bet is therefore for you to group up with others as well.
---
Class matters little here, if you're alone you're screwed either way.
---
I think mobs would be the biggest risk of dying anyway. It's vanilla after all. 
---
Rogues don’t die in glory. They die naked and afraid.
---
Because the game was designed as a PvP game with rivalry between the two factions. Just because they added PvE servers to appeal to more players doesnt mean the game is not a PvP game at the core.
---
&gt; Free market capitalism is the cure to big corporations not the cause
---
... Can big corporations exist without free market capitalism?
---
&gt; which as of now is shaping out to be a better product than what Classic may end up being.
---
Personally disagree with that. 
---
I value the feeling of "this is legit and this server wont DC/Crash/die" way too much to ever feel like private is better than a legit blizzard option. 
---
Nost is the only close to "legit" feeling Ive gotten and even then there were clear differences that put me out of it sadly. Its just so demotivating to have a constant feeling of "this shit might die tmrw/I can be rollbacked anytime soon" that I have on private servers.
---
It might be an improved option, but not better than what Classic servers is shaping up to be. 
---
Opinions like this is what made wow into what it is today.
---
No thanks!!!
---
I also think ferals will do comparetively decent damage early on in raids as a lot of their 100% necessary gear (even into naxx) is obtainable while levelling (i.e. manual crowd pummeler, wolf's head helm) whereas other classes will get bigger jumps as they obtain weapons and stuff from raids.  
---
Like of the top of my head a close to BiS pre-raid list might be something like:  
---
devilsaur set
---
gnomeregan mace  
---
wolfshead helm
---
magni's will/horde equivalent (easy to obtain quest reward, probably better ring here but it's so easy to get) 
---
mauradon ring from princess 
---
blackhands breadth trinket (quest reward)
---
rune of gaurd captain trinket (if horde)
---
cat dps libram (less energy on shred iirc?) - assuming DM is in at release.  
---
And some other stuff I'd have to look up. But you can probably get most of that whilst leveling, too.
---
Flare, hunter's mark, and track stealth all help far more. At least perception is good in bgs sometimes but yeah in wpvp it really doesn't do too much except when a rogue vanishes.
---
Why rush, why is everyone in a race!? Why!!! Enjoy the damn game and the plot and the questing. Why does it have to be a race!
---
Tank: amazing threat capabilities in certain bossfights and a decent OT if geared through the roof.
---
DPS: can be good but only if you put in a stupid amount of time and effort.
---
I'd go pally or druid.  Pally's have a ton of survivability and druids have stealth.  I would stay in stealth for the entire game, only killing green mobs.  I'd probably only kill mobs that are right next to a town/city with guards so if I do aggro extra or get ganked, I can run into the town and have the guards take care of it. 
---
Agree.. their impact in BGs seem a bit exaggerated by scarred memories from wpvp tbh. 
---
&gt; Added PvE servers  
---
Lol, you do know there were equally as many PvE/RP servers at launch right? They weren’t “added” to appeal to others. You could argue that PvP was what was “added” since honor system and BGs weren’t in place at launch. 
---
Blizzard will very aggressively shut down private servers after Classic, much more so than now. Would need to be hosted in Russia or something I suspect for that to work. 
---
i never read that even once here and im checking in daily.
---
their neither top of the line dps wise in pve nor are they especially superior in pvp which consists of dueling, open world and bgs. sure they excell at some and suck at others just like any class
---
The best route for early ally is going to darkshore, but as a pally that means no new abilities which means not so good.
---
Covered in blood and tears of enemies 
---
Haha call me soft, but I actually dont attack warriors who does this. Feels bad killing them when I know they have no chance.
---
Except Orc male warriors. They always seem to be agressive players who attack you at first opportunity. I always kill them on sight.
---
AV would be nice, that's for sure.
---
Why do people have to play the game you want it to play?
---
Speedrunning is a huge thing by now, sorry to burst your bubble..
---
Nah. That was because people were whining about a lot of stuff. Almost every significant bad decision by Blizzard was done because WoW fans were complaining about things and they tried to improve it. A lot of good things also came out of that, but at least to classic fans it mostly turned into shit. 
---
I'm not complaining about anythingI don't want them to change anything, I liked vanilla the way it was. I'm just tolerating them doing a lot of stuff because I like the game, and even if they change minor things I will still be playing it. 
---
This might have been done with bugged XP rates. Private servers had a problem while back where quests etc etc gave to mutch XP.
---
I think you are right. Both in regards to what they would be able to share and what would be interesting to read. Honestly for me it is not about impatience but more of a wondering. It is obviously a project for the long time fans of the series, and this is the reason why it is weird how limited the interaction has been. If I were running the project I think I would exchange expectations and thoughts with the fans. Obviously I am not though, and I am sure you are right. If they thought it would be a better idea they would probably do it differently. 
---
Yes, because the only option is to either enjoy every single aspect of PvP servers, including 60's ganking your level 20 toon, or not play there at all.
---
Lmao.
---
I enjoy faction rivalry, camping Blackrock Mountain, fighting other guilds for world bosses, small scale skirmishes in high level zones, contesting herb and ore spawns etc etc etc.
---
But just because I dont enjoy being corpsecamped by a 60 as I level through Redridge I should go play on a PvP server? Thats some legit autistic thinking.
---
it would improve the discussion if you bolstered your claim with a source somehow?
---
There are lots of private servers around. 
---
Pushing efficiency is fun for some people.
---
I've leveled plenty of characters slowly and taking my time enjoying the game. Now I enjoy leveling by creating time goals and trying to push my character to it's limit.
---
If *you* enjoy the game by leveling that way than go ahead. I never understood the premise that other people know how I should enjoy playing the game.
---
Part of me want to do this aswell but another part want to enjoy the lvling and struggle it offers aswell as the low lvl wpvp when noone is 60 on the server yet. So imma do the latter. 
---
Damn its gonna be fun to enjoy lvling and the world again. Getting excited af to get a greenie or get a good pot/scroll so you can do a really hard quest lol
---
For Bg premades rogues arent that amazing.
---
They are for sure a top class when it comes to 1v1's
---
World PvP is autistic. Nothing you have said can, nor does, justify its toxic impact on the game.
---
&gt; If I were running the project I think I would exchange expectations and thoughts with the fans. 
---
I think a lot of their quietness is also because they can't just tell us about anything. It would end up giving us a lot of false expectations, and then when they inevitably change some things around before the next update or release, people would be all riled up about it. That sort of thing. 
---
Nah. Monkeynews is one of, if not the, best and well known warrior across all private servers ever. He is extremely efficient. Watch the video. 
---
warrior / paladin and warrior / priest is a very strong combo yes
---
Why only as ally? 
---
'Till you die
---
sounds like the list of a pve player that has been forced to play on a pvp server.
---
pro tip:
---
once classic is released just play on pve if this world pvp is giving you such a headache.
---
point 8 made me smile. its a game dude there is supposed to be world pvp and that can include high lvls ganking low lvls of the other faction. thats what the inhonorable kill system is for.
---
LOL remember when they first talked about a WoW Movie being made....10 years later....
---
I'd say rogue in dungeons. Vanish will keep you alive when the group is dumb.
---
It's almost as if different people enjoy different things.
---
Also some of as have already done it several times.
---
Eye of shadow? 
---
Thank you, that's what I needed to hear to seal my pick of shaman
---
I am finding this has become an exhausting annoyance to be honest; including what class is the best at what. Maybe it's because I've been subbed here for a while but the information out there about this has been beaten to absolute death ( almost pictured above). 
---
Just in case you needed to know something about PvP no one else knows about.. take engineering.
---
Roll Warlock on a PVE server and keep soul stone up at all times
---
Only reportable offence for me is cheating or goldselling.
---
I think it is because of the release schedule of content, having certain items available will make some other content trivial. I'm not up to date on the specifics, but I don't think it will really affect &gt;75% of the population, since we are much more casual than the more vocal minority of hardcores this sub seems to have sometimes.
---
It isnt that hard isnt it?
---
I mean you can get out at least 3 shots + sting before the enemy is to Close and then you just gotta smack. I dont remember it to be so bad and the payoff with pet at 10 is worth it I would say.

In classic wow you could kill people who weren’t flagged for PvP and get dishonorable kills which was like -5 honor. The shire isn’t safe. 
---
Well ... yeah pet battles arent, not sure what he means with break rocks ... archaelogy? ;D
---
Also ... professions didnt yeld experience in classic ;). So questing or killing it is.
---
I think you're absolutely correct. From the different interviews I've heard with developers from Blizzard they all seem passionate. I do have my doubts regarding Activision, but the team behind the project I am not doubting. I am only wondering about the silence. The most rational conclusion is of course, as you say, expectations, development state and so forth. But lack of information is always a little disturbing and makes people wonder.
---
Oh god you're right, it's 20 and 40. 25 is one of the new numbers, I think.
---
I definitely remember running 10-man Stratholme and 15-man UBRS. IIRC those were the upper limits of players, but they locked you out of completing quest objectives.
---
Are you sure about this? I can't remember this ever being the case in Alliance-/Horde Only zones. I can only remember getting DH kills for killing guards of the opposite faction.
---
They are? They can go in stealth and capture shit in AV/AB and carry flags easily with 2x Sprint,Blind,Gouge etc.. 
---
Rogues are just bad in big fights..
---
because cat druids dont benefit from memefury totem
---
Thanks, I'll check this out. 
---
PM me which one? Im  kind of sick of the one I play on
---
Are you saying there was balance in 'nilla!?
---
Downvoted!
---
&gt; Free markets gave you some pretty clean air. Before free markets you had to burn a fire in your house to keep warm
---
Direct quote from you obviously not talking about blizzard.
---
Proteins ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
It wasn't specified if it was a fresh server or not :P.
---
Well blessings in general will help more than totems, kings/might is great.
---
THE BIG ONE is wisdom though, powershifting destroys your mana, and then you gotta wait on regular energy ticks
---
i did this on a server before. it was a new vanilla boot with accelerated leveling so i went with a bear druid and i made it my mission to put the early LBRS/UBRS farming on my back and tanked god knows how many runs per day for about a week
---
it was cool to have people whisper me wondering if i can tank for them. my guild encouraged me to see how many people i could upset as cat though when it came time to go to mc and bwl (the server never saw aq/naxx) so i didnt continue tanking though
---
if there are enough successful druids, theres hope
---
No you bumhead, he's an Undead
---
Maybe it’s just my fuzzy memory but I don’t recall ever seeing a warrior top dps in Vanilla during progression. It was one of those classes that was so fear dependent that to actually be really good dps you were on farm status and not progression status. And warriors tended to tank a lot more during those days. 
---
But rogues are most certainly a top pve class. When in progression mode rogues and mages are likely to be your top dps classes. I took a break after we progressed to C’thun in AQ40 and consistently was in the top 5 or so, depending on the fight (like Vael in BWL) rogues we’re dominant. 
---
If you do it properly Group can be very effective.
---
I honestly think someone there knows that stuff like that would outright kill Classic, driving away any potential playerbase.
---
Classic is going to be such a boost to wow numbers and thus subs, not to mention how amazing that would look to investors, that I don't think they'll risk a cash shop.
---
What does “properly” entail and how does it equate to faster levelling over solo?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eH8qq2AOBo
---
Recommend you to watch this.
---
At/around release, so early on? Two things.
---
1) Gather the mats for and craft my own armor and weapons. I know it isn't the most efficient/best route, but I was so proud the first time I did this in vanilla way back when. You could still do that now, of course, but just mining the mats alone will almost out-level any of the first copper armor gear. 
---
2) Deadmines. Such great memories of this. Can't wait to tank it again. And actually tank it, rather than faceroll through it.
---
my goal is to make new friends. i have a hard time doing so elsewhere, but this game works for me for some reason. maybe ill even be lucky enough to develop an irl friendship since it wont be yet another european private server for once
---
It's clearly warrior. Both top DPS in raids and absolute killing machines in battlegrounds (just need a healer backing you up). 
---
Maybe it was only contested areas then. I’m not 100% sure, I was a noob when this was going on I just remember getting -5ish honor when killing other level 20s that weren’t flagged. Never thought about that. 
---
Well Blizzards classic version still played itself better than any server I played on. These server are full of bad coded shit (need to manually dismount when you want to fight, automatical dismount on Zepps, ships and some places, busted droprates etc) for me they don’t feel right.
---
The major gaming drought is now. BfA is shit, Skyrim played to death, Cyberpunk maybe next year, BDO played to death. Classic pliss, the sooner the better.
---
which is a major part of premade pvp, most premades want one rogue to defend the flag for wsg and make whoever grabs the flag burn CDs. The meta ab groups don't even want to run a rogue or again only one. They just don't have the impact that a mage has
---
Don't see why not.
---
It's not just the drops you might miss out from, it's easy quests. Sometimes you can just look on classic db, gather them all up, and blast through the dungeon.
---
Thanks, will give it a watch 
---
Fresh server? So mobs can constantly respawn on top of you.
---
17/25. Messed up some pretty easy ones.
---
Could not quite reach Asmongold's level, which is a godly 21
---
This guy was agusing me of wanting people to get hacked, accounts stolen and even identity theft. Just because I didn't want wow tokens. I don't know why he is always so angry but I guess whiteknighting is exhausting. 
---
Progression wasnt using patch 1.12,or itemization which greatly boosted war dps
---
&gt; Maybe it’s just my fuzzy memory but I don’t recall ever seeing a warrior top dps in Vanilla during progression. 
---
They only became the absolute top with 1.12, or at least one of the later patches, not sure exactly which. But since we are running with 1.12 for classic they will always be great, even in earlier raids. They might not be absolute top early on, but pre-raid bis gear is good enough to pretty much entirely get past gear issues. 
---
I think he means the gear makes certain fights easier. Looking at restoration shaman's preraid BiS, its like 90% from Dire Maul. Having that before you go into MC makes a difference.
---
Right now, with Classic yet to be released, it "seems" that they are looking at Classic as a legacy throwback version of WoW designed to capture some of the gamers they have lost over the years, and bring them back into the fold of paying customers.
---
From what they have said, both versions of the game will be available with a single account.
---
It remains to be seen how successful Classic will be, and how many gamers end up playing one version or the other (or both?) So they will do some market analysis and gauge the impact of in-game transactions after Classic has been available for some time.
---
Assuming that Classic is successful, I expect that these features will be added, eventually. Hopefully, I will have played it through to completion by then. Nothing good lasts forever...
---
I'm a rogue by heart. So great tips for avoiding me, however ganking of low level characters is kind of boring. Instead I used to stalk lowbie characters in STV of my own faction and wait for an unsuspecting ganker to jump. Now that I have a proper casus belli, I would attempt and most like succeed in ganking the ganker. 60 vs 60 duel basically.
---
If there is no danger of dying to non scripted characters (PvE) I'm not really sure you can call it World of **War**craft. Perhaps "World of Killing Dragons, A Fiery dude, Giant Eye with weird tentacles and a high fashion skeleton in a cape"
---
Dishonourable kills were when you (or someone in your group) killed NPCs that were marked in the tooltip as a dishonourable target (e.g. quest givers and I think also vendors). Essentially to discourage high levels from wiping out entire quest hubs for the opposite faction.
---
playerbase will be too small. no reason to. but if you think about it that’s a good thing. 
---
If all they sell is pets. I'm okay with that. 
---
Lol I was not fully awake or caffeinated when I posted this.  Just realized it was for classic not retail.  Yea, I got nothing, if anyone says they can level 1-60 in classic without dying once they are full of it
---
Not to play a warrior.
---
Because micro transactions development would be better applied to BfA, that's why they wont put (lots) of micro transaction in classic. Just the basic server/faction/race change
---
All the non rogue players band together.  If you guys say it enough it may come true.  But the time will come when you think maybe you saw something but you are not sure. You continue your quest but the little voice in your head is telling you that something isn’t quite right.  What was that ?  Then you get popped and have a lovely corpse run.   You all know it’s true.  Rogues....for the Horde, for the Alliance, for the win 
---
For sets, I would say Warrior. 
---
For flashy spells, I always liked Shaman. They have lightning shield whirling around.  Chain lightning, chain heal. That awesome tornado when WF procs. 
---
easier for people to karma whore and do the whole "misery loves company" bit than it is to be constructive.  
---
`nillas balance lies in consistent imbalance. 
---
now take a downvote you troublemaker!
---
Paladin, Warrior, Hunter, Priest. They all have flashy sets and actually wear most of their tier items. Other classes tend to wear only a few tier items which makes their outfit look very mismatched. 
---
Kotick is just a symptom. Yeah what he did was fucked up but fire him and any other CEO will do exactly the same.  Until we as consumers stop giving these companies money for shit games and shoddy buisness practices, crap like this won't stop happening. I mean for crying out loud, I had tons of friends all buy starwars battlefront 2 even though they knew the game was shit. Their reason for doing so? "Dude it's Star Wars! Of course I'm gonna get it". Then they bitched about the crap game for months. But I digress. The point here is that if people stopped with the preorders, stopped buying games that are shitty and bugged as hell, stopped actually buying micro transactions, then shit like what happened at activision would stop. As it stands, people like Kotick have no incentive to not be shit heals. It makes the company money and keeps the stock holders happy
---
ayy lmao
---
Rogues are #1
---
I think solo is always faster. Leveling in a group just drags you down. But it’s definitely more fun. 
---
im talking patch 1.12 which is what classic will be running on. and fury dps was insane for that patch.
---
Sigh here we go again. This sub keep on getting flooded by misinformation from players without a clue. Druid tanks are far superior to warrior tanks in regard to threat output. Warriors only output similar or higher threat if the warrior is dualwield fury tanking.
---
That's a good question. Hand of Rag is unique in its PvP superiority. First drop will still be determined by loot council, additional drops by DKP bid. Loot council will have to decide based on both raid contribution and pvp focus of the player, as well as willingness to farm the mats. Even though it's not a progression item, is still takes a raid to acquire and should be rewarded to a player invested in the guild's progression.
---
 I know of 1 other member that has also shown interest in the item (warrior), but no one can say where priority goes to until the raid hours have been logged.
---
Germans have very poor English skills so yes there will be German servers. 
---
Become a level 19 twink and camp starter zones. The ultimate life. 
---
I highly recommend you read this tanking post on tanking, to show you that tank Druids are viable 
---
[tanking](https://www.dkpminus.com/wow/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/) 
---
Some pretty good video for feral cats can be found, posted by Shedo the Druid can be found on YouTube to show you how to dps and to learn how to power shift.
---
This to show you how that yes it’s possible to output real good dps in general but you have to commit to do so, in terms of farming of potions and weapon (from gnomeregan)
---
Since when is "everyone does it" a good argument for anything? Look at the facts, not at whatever nonsense is common to do. 
---
The solution to this problem has been offered in the New Rule addendum. If I have no need for breaks, I will just stay ahead of the curve. The Hardcore few who keep up with my leveling won't be interested in PvP anyway. I will take my Server First 60, and GG out.
---
There are no private servers with bugged xp. 
---
I never had more than a 1/2-dozen communications with a GM in vanilla - but I thought it was awesome that they were there to keep order in the community &amp; solve problems.
---
It most definitely has. I think a lot of other people (including me) feel the same way. It doesn’t help that every other person is all of a sudden trying to become a YouTube personality for Classic WoW now too. I’ve always stuck with Mining/Skinning to be honest! As cool as Engineering looks, the crafting nature of it always scared me off. Boy would it be nice though in PVP. :(
---
Until a friendly warlock lets loose an infernal.
---
You would have people just buying out resources and reselling when scarce if you implemented the whole caravan thing. Would actually provide incentive to let the opposing faction win!
---
Because it's Blizzard's original baby and hopefully they have something to say about how it is monetized
---
I used to enjoy collecting herbs, doing raid preparation, even fishing, but today I don't enjoy it anymore because I keep thinking "Well, I could farm for 10 hours, or I could just buy this token and get it from the auction house". I really hate this, it directly makes me enjoy that part of the game less because those 10 hours spent feel less rewarding.
---
Cosmetic stuff like pets, appearances and mounts from the store are annoying too. They somewhat ruin the immersion for me, but I could accept that as a compromise.
---
Either way, it's not much use worrying about it now. If they decide to do it, they'll just do it. Once that happens I'll have to decide whether this is a show stopper for me or not :/
---
Don't go near stv. 
---
retail wow is more profitable than ever, they can just keep adding stuff to the cash shop there. classic is more of a side project, and microtransactions would just drive the community away
---
if druids are often relegated to a healing roll and according to the mindset on this forum, rarely get accepted to groups as anything but healing, when are they supposed to get offspec gear that isn't ''ninja looting''?
---
It took a while for people to figure out how powerful fury warriors truly are. But nowadays it’s common knowledge that fury wars are by miles the strongest dps in vanilla. 
---
No kidding!
---
You're actually completely wrong. The game wasn't supposed to have PvP *at all* until Mark Kern showed Allen Adham how fun PvP could be in Dark Age of Camelot.
---
Allen was concerned with the griefing aspect of PvP, but was convinced by Mark. He basically wrote a huge list of why PvP had to be in WoW.
---
Allen supposedly got so hooked on DaoC PvP after Mark showed him that he would bug him about coming online all the time. So WoW was actually made to be entirely PvE, and was not built around PvP at all like you're suggesting. It was an afterthought.
---
Source: The ClassiCast podcast with John Staats and Mark Kern. 
---
To level a class i never got to max back in the day. I'm pretty much ready to start playing now Blizzard... so anytime you feel like releasing the game, go ahead. \^\^
---
I mean, being a close second to warriors in PvE content prior to AQ is pretty damn good. Mages don't show up in the meter before AQ, and only on bosses that greatly favor ranged, before that they're basically just food vendors and decurse bots, so it's not really fair to discard rogues while mages will only pop off well after the Classic hype died out.
---
I'm in Chicago too and will be playing horde.  Would love to join up in a guild or community!  
---
Heirlooms is what killed twinking in BG's...  Twinking is a lot of work to get the gear, but the goal was to be better geared than your peers in BG's at 19 and thus be better. With Heirlooms anyone had great gear available and twinks just dissapeared because everyone was geared.
---
&gt;This is known to be largely misinformation, created by a druid player with an obvious bias towards his class. It's pretty clear from his warrior gear sets and boss fight examples, that he doesn't understand warrior tanking, warrior threat tanking especially.
---
Funny how people are so dead set on druids being bad that they will spread any sort of nonsense. You are not providing any arguments here. You are just blanket stating that druid players have an obvious bias (how is it obvious?) and stating Taladril do not understand warrior tanking (how come?)
---
I can also just make an arbitrary statement that you do not understand druid tanking, but it's not helping anyone get any wiser. Taladril has made a huge in depth blog post about druid tanking, where you have done what exactly? Just stated he's wrong?
---
Most likely scenario is that you are just one more warrior who cant handle the idea that you may not be the only class capable of tanking endgame.
---
Lol are you serious
---
Is the hearthstone on gcd? 
---
You keep Krol Blade for a very long time. Basically throughout all of MC progression. 
---
im absolutely not discarding rogues they are top tier dps wise across vanilla. i was simply taking reference to the OP`s post which presents rogues as 1# pve dps and pvp wise.
---
with no word did i say rogues are in anyway a bad class choice for vanilla in any aspect.
---
I mean we are still improving, and there are logistics involved such as dealing with loot, getting world buffs, getting everyone from bwl to mc to ony, etc.  
---
Our last BWL clear was 1 hour 15 minutes, and our MC was just under 1 hour.  Ony is obviously only a couple minutes.  So 2.5 hours actually in the raids clearing, but when you add all the other bullshit it is close to 3.5 hours.  Time is improving each week though, sub 3 hours should be right around the corner.
---
He is supposed to spawn a posse of 2-3 helpers when attacked.
---
I've actually tested hunter + healer and I think people sleep on it way too hard. I think it's in the good tier / god tier. Depending on the healer.
---
A lot of people don't think of it this way. If you're the hunter yes you're dragging your /played down a day or two but overall if you combine you and your duos you're basically sacrificing your time to boost your duo's time so overall you guys take less time to hit 60.
---
Shaman / Druid have 0 issue with keeping up to a hunter because of Ghost wolf / Travel &amp; cat form. Provide good buffs and can hold their own with good sustained damage and buffs that help you. Gear competition is irrelevant because you get your gear from quests mostly if a green drops you usually just give it to the hunter.
---
Priest and Paladins help Hunters a decent amount but they're a lot slower so it might not be worth leveling with one, a lot of downtime waiting on them. I have not tested with these healers so maybe it is worth if played right but needs to be tested.
---
Best would be to queue only from going through the portal for me.
---
I think it works best to always recruit for what you think you need, even as the guild is leveling up. As guild leadership you should always be planning ahead. If you notice not enough mages are keeping up with the general speed of the guild, look to recruit mages, etc. You don't (or shouldn't) go from a leveling guild to a raiding guild over night. 
---
As people reach 60 you should start implementing "Raid nights" for gathering BiS and attunements. It should be the exact times you expect to raid. Those who are showing up to those nights are your core raiders and you make that your base for what you expect to need to maintain a healthy raid force. 
---
Over time, as you get close to the night you will do MC for the first time, you will have 95% of your raid force. People will always know people for those last few spots, and if you impress then with your raid, or invite them often enough, they'll join your raid force.
---
With that said, you do need a little bit of redundancy.

You should have 2-3 people who could main tank.  Don't rely on just one main tank. If you had 2 people in the raid that share the role and take turns MTing life will be a little easier. The raid wont suffer because you have 1 prot tank DPSing. Also, assigning a typically DPS warrior a back-up role for tanking will help too. They should understand if a MT is missing they might be asked to respec to PROT and should work on getting a set of PROT gear as well as DPS gear. You do not want to cancel raids because the tank is sick or for the guild to explode because he/she realizes they hold some power.
---
Your guild should have more healers then it needs. It stinks to have a raid ready but not enough heals. Maybe have 2-3 extra super active healers on your roster and work out a rotation and/or bonus system for healers who show up to raid but are forced to sit out. In a DKP sytem that might mean that they get the nights DKP as long as they remained logged in, or in a loot reel/suicide kings system maybe they get to move with the reel even tho they are not in the raid.
---
As for DPS, if a core raider suddenly drops off, the loss is not felt as much. Actively recruit while you PuG that last spot or two. Sometimes the PuGs turn into recruits, just like in your early raid stages. 
---
Too many players wanting to raid causes drama, sometimes worse than when you have too few log in for a night.
---
this. rogues have a super hard time in premades.
---
Absolute nonsense
---
Well so far Blizzard has had a VERY strong line in the sand and been very open that they are not going to do this.  
---
Remember when the last big AAA said no microtransactions and then they put them in? Remember when Bush said, "No new taxes"? People remember when people make strong statements. The community will definitely hold Blizzard accountable if they pull this and would/could be a Classic killer. People are playing Classic for authenticity. The people who want Classic want it to get away from the retail experience. When you bring retail to Classic, its not Classic anymore.  
---
There will not be mictrotransactions in Classic WoW within the first couple years.
---
Of course there were and will be german servers
---
I think you're referring to the French.
---
Agreed. Look what people did to Star Wars and EA when they pulled this shit in the past. They ran from it like it had the plague and the game was dead before they new it.  
---
Couple months you will have all the proof you need :)
---
It’s the absolute truth. It’s common knowledge that Germans suck at English. Even English movies are dubbed in German, it’s quite bizarre. 
---
wat zhe heg ar u dalking abaut
---
Agreed, these posts are getting old AF. If you think its bad on reddit, dont go to the Discord. The general channel is filled with trolly questions, speculation on implementations, and retails kids giving their ideas for Classic.  
---
For our sanity, Blizzard please give us more info!
---
I dont know about animations and abilities but there is definitely only one winner for best looking set: 
---
Tier 2 Paladin
---
A lot of people will play warrior and rogue, but on the other hand, there's a ton of spots in raids for fury warriors and rogues. You might have a hard time gearing up, but there's *always* a spot in a raid for a good fury warrior or a rogue.
---
You are wrong though. The whole Warcraft universe since Warcraft 1 has ALWAYS been about faction rivalry. I dont know why we even need to debate this.
---
There is ZERO chance the game would ever have released without the option for PvP.
---
Ye
---
Rogues whole job at the highest level of PvP is defending wsg flag by stunlocking until help arrives. Not even grabbing flag. *maybe* trying to snipe efc in 2 flag situations.
---
Sitting at the Loch in Loch Modan at sundown eating some Dwarven Mild and a bottle of wine with graphics on full blast and just enjoying the view.
---
This is really the question of “How would you avoid dying at all costs in Vanilla?” And I really like the concept.
---
Personally, I know the Horde route to 60 like the back of my hand, so I would definitely choose Orc Hunter. Pet bonus damage, stun resist, feign death, personal tank, ranged damage, wing clip... Hunters are designed to kill stuff and never die. 
---
So, right off the bat, at level one, I would be killing boars until they are grey. That puts me around level 6. As a rule of thumb I would never fight anything even close to my level the entire run, so green mobs only. From there I would do most of the Durotar quest line, avoiding really dangerous quests (Dark Storms, Zalazane), while staying much higher level than everything around me.
---
This whole time I’m also going to be leveling fishing, cooking, first aid, and my two main professions. Those would likely be skinning/herbalism to farm gold, because I’m going to be loaded up on consumables at all times.
---
So now I’m about level 15-16, done with Durotar (leveled by grinding green lvl 11 mobs for a while), I’m as high-leveled in my professions as possible, and I have quite a lot of money from selling mats on the AH, so I also have excellent gear for my level.
---
I move to The Barrens with the same mentality, and again avoid dangerous quests (Stolen Silver, Northwatch, Counterattack!). Doing green quests and farming green mobs exclusively, I finish the zone around level 30 (southern barrens mobs are low-mid 20s, if there are higher, safe mobs I would be a higher level).
---
From there I believe Thousand Needles would be best, although I would need to be careful, and stay near Freewind Post. That would push me to ~35. Avoiding STV entirely, I’d go to Desolace and just farm mobs, quests there are a tad too dangerous at times. This would push me to about level 45, while being quite safe.
---
45+ I would avoid Tanaris and things would get tricky. I can’t get to Badlands to farm because of the routes to walk there, and STV/Tanaris are deathtraps. So let’s assume at 45 I hire a group of four 60s to accompany me, protecting me while I walk to Badlands from Arathi Highlands. I’m assuming I have a ton of gold from all the farming I’ve been doing. Once we’re in the badlands, I can farm there (relatively) peacefully until I’m about level 55.
---
For 55-60 I can go to Western Plaguelands and just kill the level 50-51 mobs right by the Bulwark. Now I’m 60 and free!
---
I really like the idea of creating the safest route to level to 60, so if anyone has some suggestions, please let me know. I’m a little unsure about the Desolace + Badlands bits, there might be a safer location to farm.
---
You're spewing complete nonsense. You could never kill unflagged players. You're confusing it with killing Civilian NPCs.
---
Pick rogue, when you learn vanish level only when you have it to escape any situation. Go to isolated zones (Desolace...) 2 or 3 levels advantage to area level. Have a good supply of food, bandages and health potions. Pray for not being ganked.
---
Good luck when you realize you need to be level 50+ in order to bubble hearth since bubble duration is too short until the last rank of the spell.
---
That feeling when you finally realize that you're so weak because you never changed out your spell on your spell bar and have been using level 1 spell forever.
---
You won't get any proof, "iT jUsT mAkEs SeNsE".

Nintendo do not artificially short their stock. This all started when the NES classic was around. A product so specific you can't just "make it", you'll need to have a specialized manufacturer just for this one off thing you're selling for Christmas that not even your market researchers know will do well.
---
Factories don't just grow out of the ground and make your product in 2 days. When planning a completely new thing, you need to know how to make it, how to ship it and how many you're willing to ship. Can you 100% tell how much the NES Classic would sell just because of some Internet hype overseas? No. You can't. 
---
As such, they made a few that'd sell for sure. Suddenly, it's the hottest item since steamed Broccoli, and they try to make more. But waiting for a few weeks killed some people and they apparently died, either that or they grossly overexaggerated on Reddit and people would *never* do that, now would they?
---
They re-stocked ASAP, same with the SNES. 
---
And can you blame them? The Wii U was a *huge* failure. Why overpopulate retailers when you constantly make things that aren't safe sells, but much rather new ideas? They didn't know how well the Switch would sell. They didn't know the Wii would blow up as much as it did, especially with the Gamecube not selling too hot in comparison.
---
With the Switch, they just had the Wii U. 
---
sets did not change bro. you can still check em out and judge yourself
---
No it's not true
---
&gt;Even English movies are dubbed in German, it’s quite bizarre.
---
So what?
---
Please. Hunter pre-10 is easy af if you know what you're doing and kite mobs. The only way you'll die is if you pull extra mobs just like everyone else would die from that too.
---
Nice strawman. Anyway, when you get your head on straight. The rest of us will be waiting for reasons, numbers stats, sources, facts. The shit that dont care how you feel
---
Getting prepared for raids in BfA is nowhere near the investment it is in vanilla. You don't have to "work your way up" in BfA
---
The main vanilla pservers have a way higher up time than vanilla servers ever did back in the day. 
---
And the fact that you said "nost" is the closest to be legit completely invalidates your opinion. The biggest vanilla pserver out is nost code + 3 years of improvement. 
---
Got my Pitchforks ready

---
And russian
---
Oh but it is true. German dubbing is a testimony to how poorly Germans know English. They don’t mind ruining a beautiful movie as long as they can understand it. 
---
I think mainly because of the success of Vanilla Private Servers. One server was so successful Blizzard actually took the legal route to shutting them down.
---
Once WoW classic is released someone will be able to emulate it in a way that most people would prefer (if Bliz adds things the majority of the community does not want) and everyone would move to these servers if Bliz just seems to be making this server to milk our loyalty.
---
With the overwhelming disappointment of BFA I think they know better than to ruin classic.
---
Probably a hunter 
---
It isn't a testimony to bad english skills though. Some just prefer the dubbed version.
---
COA + Corruption as you run by
---
It is. Everyone in Europe knows that Germans don’t speak a word of English.
---
ok
---
Yea I guess I just remember a time when fury warriors didn’t really exist. But anyone saying rogues weren’t a top pve dps class clearly must not have done much pve during Vanilla. 
---
&gt; The biggest vanilla pserver out is nost code + 3 years of improvement. 
---
You mean 3 years of scams, drama and corruption? 
---
This is true, although I am the Orc Male Warrior who isnt aggresive :(
---
Maybe you should do some research bud. 
---
Not really answering any of questions, but Mage/Priest is an awesome duo for AoE leveling.
---
My best memories from vanilla is going into SM Cathedral when the mobs are low yellow to high green and completing the entire zone in two to three pulls. 
---
Hell yeah.
---
The Real MVP. 
---
I dont think people realize how much Classic will not feel like Classic if you go to one of these servers. 
---
Except it doesn’t work like that and hasn’t. There were complaints about that happening but like a lot of community uproar it was unfounded. 
---
I agree there are a lot of these type of videos out, but this one really lays out why you should not do this. A lot of people want to follow their "streamer", but never really think of the consequences. And by the time they figure it out, they have sank hours into a character that is worthless.
---
It's really awful. Hunter is probably the weakest class pre level 10. If you aggro two mobs you are dead.
---
If that was possible then a tank+ healer should certainly be able to finish at least some instances.
---
What about italians and frenchmen?
---
I'm fully aware the Warcraft franchise has always been about faction rivalry. It's called Orcs vs Humans for a reason.
---
But World of Warcraft was not suppsed to have a PvP component. It was not supposed to be Orcs vs Humans. I'm not wrong on this.
---
Watch the podcast if you don't believe me.
---
The fact that after Classic releases, new pservers will appear, which will become more authentic than ever before. That makes me optimistic. If ActiBlizz screws Classic, we will have another option.
---
Rogues are the most powerful class... once every 10 minutes. 
---
what the fuck are you on? keep the content of your demented mind to yourself
---
&gt; People have already done it several times.
---
This is the main reason
---
Besides, 1-20 is probably the most important part to rush to get ahead of the curve.
---
To be fair a rogue with full CDs can kill anyone 
---
Im a man of honor. 
---
I watch the fight like in Colosseum and clapping the winner. If the opposing faction wins and he is grey - he can live. 
---
More even level range? Goodbye. 
---
I think so, as long as you go at the tail end of appropriateness. Like if a Zone is 20 to 26, you should be about level 24 to attempt it.
---
Recently on a PServer, we did a Trio (Warrior, Paladin, Warlock [Tank/Healer/DPS]) as Horde and we did WC and RFK and SM following that rule.  IIRC we had to skip one boss in RFK but otherwise we cleared the instances while the quests were still yellow.
---
&gt; The main vanilla pservers have a way higher up time than vanilla servers ever did back in the day. 
---
So to make your argument you intentionally compares hardware setups from 2005 to 2019 and thinks thats a fair assumption of what Classic will be launched on?
---
&gt; And the fact that you said "nost" is the closest to be legit completely invalidates your opinion. The biggest vanilla pserver out is nost code + 3 years of improvement. 
---
Thats why I said "I've gotten". 
---
And again... it doesnt invalidate my point because there's been a fuckton of corruption, instability and drama within the "next nostalrius!"x5 during those 3 years. Not to mention how few actually have a comparable big and loyal playerbase. 
---
Im not saying all Private servers are shit.
---
Im just saying its REALLY reaching to say that private servers are shaping up to be a better product than what Classic from Blizz is shaping up to be. Thats just ridicilous to say if we look back at the flaws of private realms historically and today.
---
Well, IIRC Horde can get to level 48 or something without ever leaving the Barrens if you just stick around and cheese RFK and RFD until every single mob goes green.  Of course, since I think Coldbringer is the highest lvl mob in the zone you'll be running thousands of RFDs at like 2-500 xp per run.
---
SM is also super safe for Horde but I'm not sure it's worth the risk of taking the Zeppelin since there are a nonzero number of times I've zoned in dead from falling because of loading issues.  Buy a port to UC instead of flying I guess.
---
Then- and this is the brilliant part IMO... Then, once I'm lvl 50ish, I declare war on Ratchet and grind lvl 55 Ratchet guards until 60.  Assuming you get experience for them.  As A hunter it is certainly not difficult to kill +7 mobs.
---
Speaking of which, Hunter would be my first choice, probably Tauren for life and war stomp.  Mage would be very attractive though... Frost Mages have a lot of outs and travel between continents without worrying about glitchy boats.
---
Another possible option would be to bait EPL mobs back into the Bulwark to kill.  No one ever goes there so it's safe PVP wise.
---
Either way no possible way I'm going alliance.  There is literally no possible way to make it past 30 or so without delving into gankfests, and the Barrens is easymode leveling.

---
I would pay good money to hire bodyguards
---
Roll a paladin, play it safe till Divine Shield then proceed to bubble hearth at the first sign of danger and spend the hearthstone cooldown drinking at the pub. 
---
There’s nothing stopping you from only killing things 4 levels beneath you until you’ve got a pet. Risk of dying goes to near-zero.

Here, I found it for you: https://youtu.be/izCBaGfGJCg?t=6249
---
A long email was written to Allen Adham (the project leader at that time), trying to convince him that WoW should have two factions with a Horde and Alliance split.
---
Believe me now?
---
Which is a stupid complaint because you can clear MC in greens as long as you've got tanks def capped.
---
Mine still works!
---
Take up skinning, which frequently will help remove the trail. 
---
Leveling solo will almost always be at least slightly faster while also requiring much less effort and coordination. The main reason for this is that any efficiency gained from the natural synergy of classes is outweighed by needing to travel twice as far to kill enough mobs to get a given amount of xp.
---
Mage is the class least suited to group leveling because they have a fundamentally different killing tempo than every other class, killing quickly but spending a lot of time drinking.
---
That being said I still recommend you level with your friends. It will be a lot more fun.
---
I've only ever made a Horde and Alliance ones.

And I guess I got confused when I uploaded these; Alliance Nail Art and Horde String Art. Ops :l

I agree, I think everyone knows development came up and scrapped a bunch of ideas along the way. I just think this particular one would've made a better story line than what they ended up doing up to now.
---
Isn't too many buttons is good? 
---
Assuming you can never log out with this scenario until 60.
---
One if the most dangerous part would be the initial level 1 route to a major city. Lots of people die before even reaching a city. But this shouldn't be too hard as well as you level in areas you're only just above. 
---
Take your time making gold without leaving major cities and stack every single enchant on gear you can. I'd fish most or the time in major cities near guards to build up the gold very slowly and cautiously. Keeping myself ready for a sneak rogue attack at any time. 
---
When out of town only level in groups of 5 people that has maximum survivability. Pay team mates handsomely for your time if necessary. 
---
Always have a soulstone on you when leaving major cities - assuming this wouldn't be a cheat of the rule?
---
Get every buff possible on you before leaving a major city. 
---
Carry pots and use buffs such as well fed.
---
Can you gain exp with fishing by the way? If so I'm never leaving town.
---
Running ZF to find a gray tablet that tells how to make the mallet to summon Ghaz. That was such a mind-blowing concept to me back in Vanilla. “Go across the world and do some ridiculous grinding and adventuring!” All for 3% riding speed. Totally worth it.

---
There are MANY things you can do to speed up your leveling pace in the early levels.
---
I'll assume you're working off a leveling guide.  The common guides available are about...80% efficient.  You can find many ways to improve upon them if you think critically about what you're doing rather than just mindlessly following the guide.
---
It's all about focusing on the most efficient route and eliminating unnecessary downtime/travel time.
---
I'll give you some examples on the Dun Morogh route since I've done the 1-12 run about 15 times the last month.
---
1)  Know which quests to skip.   ex:  You should be skipping the quest to pick up the dude's bolts/bucket/etc from the 3 troll camps as the respawn time sucks and there are no follow ups to the quest.
---
2)  Know when to die on purpose.   You don't get rez sickness before level 10, so dieing in certain places and rezzing at spirit healer cuts down on a lot of travel time.
---
4)  Know which mobs are weak.  Off the top of my head since I've been working on the darkshore leg this month, ghosts/imps/moonstalkers are all good to 3 shot as you're running around.  Bears are not as they have a lot of HP.
---
5)  Be very selective on where you choose to run, and when you choose to train/get flight points/turn in quests.  I have mapped out exactly how much XP I need at say, level 7 in order to die, rez in Kharanos turn in quest to ding level 8, get new spells and go back and do the shimmerweed quest.
---
6)  Once you are beyond level 10 you should be hyper-aware of how to use your hearthstone most effectively....which ties into
---
7)  Figure out which levels you can skip training.
---
ex.  I have my hearth setup for quick transport from Auberdine to IF to train level 14, then I will skip training until level 18 as the level 16 spells don't have a huge impact on leveling.
---
On top of all that, there are a lot of 'specific' tricks that cut down on the time as well.  Can't be giving away all the secrets ya know.
---
It does take some extra organization on your part. People aren't going to log in and form groups on their own and farm BiS.  You need to assess who is online and form the groups for them. Give them direction.  And make sure you are always mixing the group compositions up so its not always the officers in one group and then a tier A group and a tier B group.
---
It is micromanaging and therefore a lot of work on the leadership, but people tend not to mind. They look forward to logging in to "raid" and getting assigned a group where they will get a chance at a specific loot they need or pay it forward for a guildy because that is the same help they got previously. 
---
Your leadership team needs to be dedicated enough to log in each of those pre-raid raid nights and work toward making fun nights of farming for all who log in. 
---
I think I worded my response wrong, as evidenced by the votes, but I never argued that. They said that people who start in bfa immediately start as a champion and such, story wise, which isn't true. 
---
Except “this one” isn’t based in reality. 
---
It’s based on someone wishfully interpreting artifacts left over from game development.
---
So. He’s basically just making shit up. Shit that was proven to not be true.
---
Which means he’s basically just fan fic-ing. 
---
such as? nothing that has had any effect on me or my friends. 
---
B) isn't changing due to being in a city
---
I personally believe 1-30 is. The faster you get to shimmering/desolace/stv the better. Those zones can take 5x longer if you're not ahead.
---
I never said it was based on reality. Just that I like the story line better than retail.
---
can you please stop telling this to the horde. 
---
Priest-Rogue-Warrior is most OP. You'll have a tank and healer at the ready. Rogue is great DPS. And you don't share armor types. 
---
And this will be a problem in your group. because you and the priest will have to roll for any cloth armor that drops. Same goes for staves offhand weapons main hand caster weapons etc.
---
I'm pretty sure they don't consider classic a Frontline release as it has no upfront box cost and it's entire business model is already tied to the preexisting wow sub.
---
I would go straight to Hogger at lvl 1
---
If it’s just fan fic fanboy wish fulfillment then I’m not clear why it’s worth linking. 
---
Just link someone’s fan fic. There’s probably a billion WoW Fan Fic stories with a better arc than retail. 
---
damn how did I read this as "beast looking cats"

**&lt;Requiem&gt;**
---
**Raid Schedule:**  Thursday &amp; Sunday 6:00 PM PST. As more content becomes available we may add a 3rd day, this is still TBD. 
---
**Background:**  Group of IRL friends from the mid-west all getting back in for the release of Classic WoW.  Most of us are classically trained up to and including MC, ONY, and BWL, with a few who saw AQ40 and NAXX content prior to the release of BC.  Many in this group, myself included, have been active across various vanilla private servers over the years and are eager to bring our knowledge and experience to the Blizzard stage. 
---
**Expectations:**  Be courteous and respectful of all members. No Gatekeeping. We don't expect you to know every boss strat, but if you don't, we will expect that you show up with a positive attitude and a willingness to learn.  
---
**First and foremost, this will be a Semi-Hardcore PROGRESSION/RAIDING GUILD.** Our goal is to progress through all Raid content efficiently but without tryharding and sacrificing the fun aspect of playing the game -others have referred to this as relaxed-progression. 
---
Do not let this intimidate you. We understand we're older now, with families and careers. We're not asking you to put in an extra 40 hours of WoW on top of real world responsibilities. We're also not asking you to give up PVP. And while we'd love to begin progressing through content as soon as possible, we understand the level 60 grind, and preparing for raids, takes time and effort. 
---
What we're really focusing on now is building a core group\* of like-minded players who understand the effort behind building a successful raiding guild and have the drive to make it happen in a friendly and laid-back, albeit efficient, environment. 
---
\**If you have past experience with being a raid /class leader (or even no experience) and are interested in applying for an Officer position, PM me.* 
---
**Discord:**  [https://discord.gg/fUvwyCt](https://discord.gg/fUvwyCt)
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't this set kind of useless, since paladin mostly plays holy, meaning you will wear all sort of armor (cloth etc.), resulting in never actually using tier 2 set? 
---
Dont think it effects classic or WC3 remastered
---
Pfft give me back my old microsoft sidewinder mouse.
---
Level boosts is one of them! 
---
Ah, I remembered Retail has this scaling bullshit now.
---
even as a hunter ive never got to 20 in 8 hours, that sounds like broken xp rates or maybe retail rates.  if you want to stay ahead of the curve just stay awake longer and sleep less and youll be ahead when people eventually have school or work or real life things to do.
---
What a mongoloid. Go learn English you german ape. 
---
Its really not a problem, most lvling items have only base stats that are didn't hit your dps, only +int but it's very slightly. 
---
But rarely you can find something with of frost/fire/arcane/shadow/nature wrath suffix so it's obviously problem. 
---
So if you have only mage-priest-rogue setup you can go something like frost on mage, disc priest and combat rogue for safety or go something dps on mage like fire or arcane frost for dps and hemo rogue for stunlock. 
---
I’m just making it clear to anyone that reads your post that the video in question is just made up bullshit. 
---
Sorry that makes you sad. 
---
Personally I don’t share made up speculative bullshit here on this subreddit because that legit is a problem here.

Fact and fiction blur a bit too often on this subreddit so if I see someone post a link to an entirely made up, disproven video like this, I’ll comment.

Our warrior is in durotar. This is mainly for the starting zone just to get ahead of the pack.  We don’t care about gear that much. It’s already decided that all frozen wrath gear goes to me and the priest can have spirit gear mostly 
---
Classic is still coming but they don't see it as a "frontline" release.
---
I think the hardest part of leveling as a group is timing. When do you play? How does everyone’s schedule line up? Did someone have an hour free and do a quest without the others?
---
It’s bothersome, but if you manage past that, it works well. “Kill 30 trolls” takes less than 1/2 the time with two people than with one. With three (a dps, healer, and tank no less), such quests would take no time at all. Dungeon groups would form on a whim because “LF2M any DPS” is a godsend to get into. Elite quests (even red ones) could be done with your group. The game’s difficulty would go way down if you could reliably work as a group of 3. I say go for the group effort if the timing aspect works to your favor.
---
I have the 502 as well - and I really like it. I do think I'll get the 518 as well though.
---
Just because why not.
---
I mean, I don’t have proof, but it’s rhetorical in nature, so proof isn’t needed.
---
When I think back on the best players on my server(US Lightning’s Blade), while I recall many great players, I remember the Rogues the best. Ming, Jookya, Jerin(sp?). There were standouts from other classes(Aedak, Cheese, Tidehunter among countless others), and my memory after so many years isn’t what it was honestly, but I certainly recall the Rogues.
---
I'm not a fan of Kotick but the letting go of those employees was blown way out of proportion. They let go people with positions that were contracted for specific areas of time in the development of certain products. They did not fire any long time developers in the company. This happens all the time in the game dev industry. People just hastily glued together the yearly profit reports with the laying off of contractual workers. 
---
We are all no lifing the game for the first 2 weeks. If I can get ahead of the pack I’m ditching my friends and gonna go the aoe grinding route and meet them back at 60.  My main concern is the start with all the chaos. Maybe I should group up just to tag mobs better 
---
Tier 1: Hunter looks kinda cool, the others are kinda meh
---
Tier 2: Many cool ones but Paladin, Rogue, and Warlock wins in my book
---
Tier 2.5: Most people hate these but Paladin and Shaman and Rogue looks cool I think
---
Tier 3: Even more cool ones.. I always liked Mage, Warrior, Druid, Warlock and Shaman the most
---
My philosophy was always that if I was riding along and came across a lowbie they were gonna get the token gank. I'd usually just mount back up and keeping going from there though.
---
Genuinely being corpse camped is a lot more rare.
---
&gt;updated models
---
No, having sub-5 second load times isn't possible when the models have like 100x as many polygons
---
I had a G500s before, a G500 before that and a G5 waaaay before that. Two of those I got as replacements for the former so had I not gotten a G500s for the replacement of the G500 I probably would have gone with the G502. 
---
&gt;  two factions with a Horde and Alliance split.
---
People tend to forget that everyone being lumped into one of two factions is a WoW thing.
---
Night Elves and Undead were their own distinct factions in Warcraft 3.

You won't die if you just stick to lvl 1-5 zone until you're lvl 9 and then continue only via zones that are -4 levels AT LEAST.

That's true but if you see a ?? approaching, you can activate it and try to get away before they get near you. 
---
Lol, thanks for being the defender of truth and justice on reddit. You make your country proud. From the beginning I said this was someone's opinion. I think everyone who's interested in this subreddit are already savvy enough on the topic to discern on their own. Sounds like you want the last word so say your peace and have a lovely day.
---
The extra mob you might pull is a lvl 3 or 4 imp while you're level 7... big deal
---
Rogues prey on the souls of the doubtful like a fat kid on cupcakes
---
Because for a lot of people that's what classic was about. A lot of people played on PvP servers and the dynamics there was a big part of the experience. Those who played on PvE servers had their experience.
---
But for a lot of us sudden world PvP (even ganking/camping) was a major part of Vanilla. Doing raids to get better gear just so that it would help you out in world PvP wasn't an uncommon thing. There wasn't really the distinct 'this is PvP gear and this is PvE gear' thing in Vanilla. Raid gear was often great in PvP, and the PvP rank gear was often pretty good in raids.
---
Don't roll a warrior.
---
Don't not be a lock or a hunter.
---
Level 60 achieved.
---
I typically let random grays live. If two lowbies are fighting, I’ll heal/buff my guy so he wins, or just 1-shot the other enemy. If they are green to me, I will almost 100% try to kill them. I’m very cautious around yellows/orange enemy players, and if a red or ?? comes along, I /wave or /dance or wiggle to try and convince them not to kill me.
---
I feel like my approach isn’t the most honorable, but it feels the most fun for me. If a 60 decides to kill me I will usually /dance or /clap while they kill me lol

come classic I intend to farm at least one of these on my warlock and give it to whatever priest in my guild I feel best about. is this a feasible idea? i don't mind putting like 20-30 hr into it
---
A lot of people genuinely like it. Maybe we should stop throwing around the term autistic so loosely. What you meant to say is you don't like it so you play on a PvE server. Good for you.
---
If you think that then you aren’t paying attention to this subreddit much. 
---
There are at least 5+ posts a day that are based on someone’s lack of information, or videos like this where people just make shit up. 
---
E.g. the current hur durring over right click to report, or last months hur durring about how sharding can’t handle large groups because a streamer somewhere had a problem with a city raid. 
---
So when stuff like this is posted, especially when it’s completely made up but presents itself as being a researched opinion, it’s useful to clearly point that out. 
---
This is such an ass-backwards reply that I have a hard time imagining you ever played on a pvp realm. World pvp is great - you get huge wars in burning steppes for control of the black lotus spawns there. There’s nothing toxic about rolling around a 50+ zone as a group of 5-10 trying to collect the highest value herb in the game (needed for flasks). There’s also nothing toxic about battling for control of Blackrock mountain so that your raid can roll through 10-20 mins later with buffs and not worry about losing any. World pvp makes the world feel alive - as nothing is ever truly safe. If you find that toxic... well I guess playing on a pve server is your only answer.
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Slightly slower PVE progression (The whole clearing MC in the first week thing sounds like anti-fun to me, no offense to anyone that may be trying for this)
---
I don't mean to be a debbie downer, but that is going to be a thing. All of the private server racers are coming into classic, and they will be shooting for that.

&lt;Murloc Overlords&gt; \[Horde\] EU-Undecided Server Type
---
We are currently a group of friends that met up within WoW. Our guild was part of a larger guild that become corrupt, which led us to disband from it and go a different direction. Throughout all of us, we have people that started at BC and others at Legion. We are open to newcomers as I only joined at the end of WoD and have had minimal experience within private servers as well.
---
Our main goals are currently to just get a community of players to play throughout Classic and depending on the numbers, we can make additions to the guild like raid days/community events etc. 
---
As of now, the server type that this will be played on is not decided, hopefully by the time that we have more players, we will be able to have a goal as a guild to partake in mainly PvP or PvE activities. 
---
In general, this is not a hardcore guild, if that is what you are looking for, i would recommend going elsewhere. We are here to have fun and make some new friends during that period.
---
Here is our discord, feel free to join and talk to us about anything gaming related. [https://discord.gg/B8AZMjb](https://discord.gg/B8AZMjb)
---
If you have any questions about the guild, message me on reddit or join the discord and send me a PM from there (I am Cattman312 on discord)
---
I hope to talk with you soon, and if not, i hope that you find what you are looking for in the rest of this page.
---
Love that mouse for day to day usage, but I find it unplayable for WoW. The thumb buttons are far too ridgid, it makes spamming them impossible.
---
Pffft, trackball for life!
---
Warrior / Paladin is OP. Because the combo is extremely hard to kill. The only thing that can kill the Paladin is a Shaman. So the trick is to have the Warrior take out that Shaman asap. Rogues don't stand a change against Paladin. Because a rogue relies on CD's for a kill. But the Paladin can break that CC both on himself and on the warrior. After that the Rogue's become dinner. 
---
In a 2v2 fight I think you would only have a difficult time against a Shaman / Warrior combo. Any other 2v2 match up you will win.
---
Classic got no updates after RS2 was made, OSRS isn't RSC
---
Mages are better in raids outside of patchwerk.

True. Sorry, I didn't mean to presuppose!
---
&gt;Its definitely in a better spot than ret. so if you made it as a ret you make it as enh. if you want and try it - you make it.
---
This has to be a joke. The main ability of enhancement (Stormstrike) is not even something that you get to use. Ret Paladins have their problems, but at least they have the possibility of actually using their abilities, and they dont go out of mana nearly as fast as enhancement.
---
If blizz fucks up classic I will never touch another blizz product the rest of my life, I think many feel this way.
---
If your rolling a hunter and rogues are your worry, you are doing something insanely wrong. I would argue that hunters are the bane of a rogues existence.
---
Happy cake day
---
Multiple raid difficulties and easy heroics were in the beginning of wrath.  That xpac was shit end to end.
---
Well I know some content creators like Sodapoppin and tipsout are specifically rolling the opposite faction that their counter-content creator-parts are rolling to specifically make it fun and not one sided   But yeah I don’t really want to be on those servers mostly just for queue times
---
It's simple, they'll once again lose the subs they release Classic for in the first place. 
---
And how are gonna figure out what server all the creators are gonna pick?
---
Not like they are gonna go out publicly what servers they are gonna pick.
---
Still using my old mx518 right now @ work haha
---
Retired the mx518 to a work mouse and bought a g403 since it was the spiritual successor to the 518 when I was shopping for an overwatch mouse that didnt have the Angle Snapping Feature.
---
Im sure this one will not have it either since it is brand new and theyve done away with it in later models, cant wait to switch back!
---
https://prosettings.net/library/what-is-angle-snapping/
---
Classic is being hidden because it will come with subscribing to world of Warcraft. For blizzard, they will look like they are innovating once again when it is shown that their sub numbers have jumped up. They just can't tell everyone "our old product sucked so we allowed people to play the old version and now they're coming back in droves"
---
I always run towards the graveyard when I’m trying to run from a gank. 
---
I feel like that too.
---
Yes I actually feel the same way. Also I don't really know any WoW streamer, so I won't have a clue what server I should avoid. 
---
13/25
---
I think most of that is due to not actually having raided anything in Vanilla. Excellent quiz though! Loved the mob sounds section.
---
Loved my naga before the left mouse button started double clicking everything when I touched it.

been wondering this myself

We'll be fully prepared for launch, join now!

nobody was saying that though. like ever.
---
Thanks for the reasurrance guys. Needed to calm my nerves. I never got to play vanilla wow as I lived in the country and I'm overly excited now. 
---
I’ve never been optimistic about it. Just look at EverQuest progression server. People squeeled and whined over micro transactions being in the shop. Guess what though? 
---
Each time a progression server launches its easily the most populated server by a large margin and people thrown down on the cash shop (xp pots, bags, etc).
---
I hope it won’t happen with WoW, but you’d be insane to think that they’ve never considered it. I’m sure they’d sacrifice population if they knew they’d make a quick buck off the cash shop.
---
Why wouldn't they? They do want their followers...to follow lol.
---
They will, they will have guilds already premade, and the info will slip even if they want to keep it secret.
---
Failure would be the best advertisement campaign for private servers :D
---
Shamans look dope in bis elemental/resto gear for pvp. You’re like a armored caster and if you go male orc you get the sick wind blowing cape when you cast. Then you bang em with a chain lightning crit that zapps them into the ground. Fun stuff 
---
private servers are up for 10 years. we allready know :)
---
Check movies from Perplexity. He can do crazy things with the rogue class :0
---
I went and try a private server between Legion and BfA and ended up with two level 60 shamans on two "realms". You can check out my full relation on [https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17624152675](https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17624152675) :)
---
In general you travel way more, without flying, get to know all the zones that are dead on retail version due to not being current. Gearing as a fixed BiS list so if you get it you have it and nothing won't trash it by increasing ilvl for next raid tier. Economy is way "better" where you get a *Honest Pay For Honest Work* and even on a private server there isn't enough hads at work to overflow the economy. Raids compared to modern ones will likely be borring but raids aren't as self-enclosed content as on retail. Most of raid will be to prepare for it - get some world buffs, get some consumables, get some rep for MC, get a douse etc. Oh and leveling is quite fun.
---
That was fine when MMO mice didn't exist. I couldn't play without all the side buttons anymore though, at least not a class like Shaman that requires 8 billion keybinds.
---
Pfff going to the zone for portals. I was leveling on a Pserver the other day and by accident came across the WSG portal. It struck me with such a flashback off memory's. I completely forgot we had those portals before the Battlemasters. I just wandered around the area there just to check it out. Yeah that memory was great.
---
But no, Battlemasters is the way to go. Although I would not mind if they would go with going to the portals first and adding Battlemasters like after a few months.
---
And how will that get you to 60?
---
Eventually a stealthed 60 rogue will be behind that mage and permakill you.
---
I don’t mind playing on a content creator’s server. At least it will mean the server is alive and active. 
---
A lot of classic servers are gonna die off after initial rush and hype settles down. And nothing’s more boring than a dead vanilla server, you literally can’t do anything. 
---
you would risk going dungeons multiple times? are you not concerned that you'd group up with an idiot who wipes you?
---
and Feign Death
---
warrior? are you insane? the weakest leveling class by far?
---
You do have a point, but maybe if it was a small content creators it would be fine, but playing on a server with Asmongold or other streamers with thousands of viewers i doubt will be fun experience. 
---
If you’re going the aoe route then yeah, maybe just keep dungeons around their level in mind. Grinding is a lot less painful with a good number of blues.
---
I dont think they're doing the wow token, but i wouldnt be suprised if they forced you to have an authenticator to play classic.
---
vanish can be resisted
---
World of Roguecraft. 
---
Also this would've been even better if you intentionally mispelled it as Rouge. 
---
so you have a 2.5 hour clear time which is not bad.  
---
dynanic resoawn wasnt a thing in classic
---
Having raids roaming inside BRM everyday killing groups who try to enter, 60s corpse camping low levels in low level areas, bots in battlegrounds, premade dodging groups throwing games and raid groups roaming in Un'goro killing anyone that tries to farm is far from fine, as can be seen by the constant complaints in the forums (guessing you're talking about ND) sure these things can happen in 4k pop servers but to a much lesser extent. The 4k pop server I played on actually never had these problems. 
---
Literally still using one. Think Im going to move on after this one though to a newer Logitech model with a couple more buttons.
---
Well retail is there to help my friend.
---
Same. I love mine.
---
Don't run into a group of murlocs thinking you can fight more than one because you probably can't unless you're a pet class. 
---
Never claimed it was. Stuff can respawn on top of you without dynamic respawns. 
---
&gt; the risk of taking the Zeppelin since there are a nonzero number of times I've zoned in dead from falling because of loading issues
---
Since its a fictive Scenario I would assume stuff like that (or lags/Server Crash etc) is not a Thing. 
---
but what does a fresh server have to do with mobs spawning on top of you then?
---
You have to watch their... stream.
---
I think i just puked in my mouth a little.
---
wow youre a dick.
---
Have fun getting cleaved or something because the tank is dumb
---
Holy shit ... the Moment you are on 10% health or something and waiting for the healer to heal you since it would be you permanent death ... scary
---
Right before tbc, after they’d released the 41 point talents, me and a fury warrior with Thunderfury did a 2 vs 6 in AB and won. I was a disc priest that wouldn’t die and he steadily chopped them down since they had no healer
---
**This**
---
Ironically because they want money. And its either leave it be, and collect the subs, or infest it and drive off the playerbase and get nothing. These assholes may be assholes... but they can be trusted to follow the money. That's the only thing they can be trusted to do.
---
Personally I don't care but I think the hostility is more towards the toxic community that usually revolves around the streamers and not the streamers themselves.
---
I use to love watching rogues die to my thorns in bear form. 
---
“A lot of servers are gonna die off[...]”
---
Crunched the numbers, have you?
---
When he ask the DPS or at least states before the run starts that he/she will be rolling on their offspec. 
---
Hmmm I mean ... well ... hmmm ...
---
not sure about the rules, if soulstone is allowed to save you ... well out of question it is warlock then rofl
---
I became hostile to the 7 remake when I realized its combat would be more similar to 15... it just made me mad... I love turn based shit, damnit!
---
&gt; Im just saying its REALLY reaching to say that private servers are shaping up to be a better product than what Classic from Blizz is shaping up to be
---
Its not even reaching, its flat out wrong. You were right the first time you replied. For all the so called praise for the vanilla private servers, the one the guy is defending shuts down this summer. So much for that uptime.
---
An official one, with actual US based servers for decent pings, and a sub cost to filter out the russians, kiddies, trolls, and legions of chinese farmers is miles beyond Private Servers and always will be.
---
Im sick of playing with an inflated ping. Fuck that shit. 
---
I think people just tend to dislike people who get a lot of attention, tbh. I don't follow any streamers, but have watched some youtube videos of some of the ones involved with Classic WoW, and I don't see anything wrong with them. It's just the regular think of hating things that are popular.
---
&gt;But for a lot of us sudden world PvP (even ganking/camping) was a major part of Vanilla.
---
Don't get me wrong I 100% agree, some of my favorite memories from Vanilla are either getting my Charger on my paladin, or winning some 2v1s in STV on my warrior. Just wondering why it seems that the Classic community specifically seems to really be all about PvP - when I would wager that Vanilla itself was pretty evenly split between PvPers and not. I would assume it's because most pservers have been PvP, and so it has served to retain those of a specific mindset more.
---
They are bad at pronouncing stuff. They are not really bad at understanding the language. Certainly not below average compared to other EU countries. I went zo school in switzerland do im fluent in german anf english was so fucking easy for me to learn because its basically a dumbed down version of german with some latin thrown in to it. I dont mean this in a negative way tho. German is probably the language thats more similar to english (same origin and all) but the grammar in english is a lot simpler than german and other latin languages which in turn are also a lot simpler thsn german.
---
My english is not the yellow from the egg.
---
For animations and abilities I'd go Mage. Just because I love the way Frost spells look.
---
For sets I'd probably go Warrior or Priest as I think pretty much all of their sets look good. Warlocks also have decent sets up until Naxx, but Plagueheart is perhaps the ugliest in the game IMO. Mages have good T2, T2.5 and T3 sets but T1 is awful.
---
The ugliest looking class has to be Hunter... Nothing particularly good looking about their spells and attacks, and their sets are for the most part awful looking (up until Cryptstalker).
---
It's the same for everyone. When I leveled a rogue I leveled him cold blood. After I got that everyone died in a cheap + evicerate. I agree with your point Warlocks can be gear dependent like warriors though. Not having to deal with WoTf is nice but it's not game breaking. Keep in mind as an alliance lock you won't have to deal with (cleanse) so it's a pretty sweet trade off. 
---
I don't its mostly the people around them. Im not saying all the viewers are all bad... but the bad apples are typically louder and more annoying than the bunch making it seem as if the communities are bad. People usually connect the streamers their fans.  Id rather just stay away from them in regards to playing, but they are entertaining to watch occasionally.
---
How about going felwood/winterspring for the later part?
---
As These Areas are actually pretty far away, not many People are there.
---
Also there are quite some places off the roads you can grind.
---
People are pussys and cant just ignore content they don't like anymore instead they voice themselves loudly trying to get people they disagree with banned.
---
pvp raid incoming killing you while you zip your merlot
---
A) quest selection to focus on. Kill quests are great, since there's three of you, you can tag 3 at once, doing the quest 3x as fast, since a firm 10 is all you need to kill, so long as the party members are close enough.
---
If you're level 31, and the quest gives 1.500xp and you kill 10 level 31 mobs for itat like 1 a minute, solo it'd be a 16 minute quest (3 travel, 10 kill time, 3 travel) for 2,000xp from mobs and a total of 3,500xp, or 13,125xph 
---
With three in the group, kill time is now 3 minutes, so it's a 9 minute total time investment, and even though you get a group penalty so kill xp is only 733xp, the faster time makes up for it and a total of 14,886xph
---
**~ 13% faster in a group**
---
B) quest selection to avoid. Collect quests. That 10 bear ass quests is now a 30 bear ass quest. And even though there's 3 of you the faster killing does not benefit you as much.
---
Let's assume a 50% drop rate. And again, level 31, killing (60) level 31 mobs for a quest turn in of 1500xp.
---
Solo: 1500 quest xp + 4,000 mob xp for 20 kills. Takes ~20 minutes @ 1.5 kills a minute + 3 minute travel each way. 12,692xp
---
Group: 1500 quest xp + 4640 group xp for 60 kills. Takes 36 (30 kill, 3 each travel) minutes even at a more efficient 2 kills a minute (60 mobs necessitates spawn wait time.) 10,233xp
---
**~ 20% slower in a group.**
---
C) Fetch and Fedex quests are moot, no practical difference. Slight benefit for spawn click quests, since the 2 not waiting on the spawn can kill whatever's around. Time's not wasted.
---
D) Grinding: in a group of 3, kills give 38.6% their normal xp. **You need to kill things 2.5x faster to break even**. Which is normally pretty fine with 3 people, but you run out of mobs fairly quick, it's hard to maintain.
---
So if you have a GOOD plan, routed to prioritize kill quests, fetch quests, FedEx quests etc - and kill the shit out of everything within a 50 yard radius going from A to B.... you're slightly ahead. But once you get into the bear ass territory, you fall quite a bit further behind.
---
you would die by wolves and defias until youre there lol
---
Who honestly cares about CMs anyways? Why are we making such a big deal about this when they are hiring more devs who actually work on the game?
---
If you manage to login as the servers go live, you could always pick a server and try to create characters with their names as fast as possible.
---
Nintendo's philosophies are why they've survived and been loved for so long. To bad other companies refuse to take notes and are ruining these great fucking games
---
Imo best thing is just to go rogue, get all defensive talents and just carefully grind mobs in very remote corners of azeroth
---
Here is my tip, if someone is chasing u, run around a corner and start logging out. They have to kill u in less than 20seconds. That saved my butt countless times. 
---
Same thing if u died and don't know if someone stealthed camping u. Start logging out as a ghost then with few seconds left click resurrect. They will see u for a second before u log out, he will think u have entered a battleground and abandon camping u.
---
that is also fine
---
It's what my plan will be. Take a few weeks off, play a \*lot\*, but not really efficient. I will do the level appropiate dungeons, and unnecessary quests and level up cooking etc. 
---
But since I can play 10h a day for several weeks straight, I will be in the top 20% of the server, behind the power levelers but in front of the big crowd. 
---
Which is a perfect spot to be in a guild. You get goodies sent from the power levelers and you can make friends with the crowd below you by sending them goodies. Once the power levelers are 60, they want other guildies to catch up and will rush you through the higher level dungeons (ZF is quite easier with 1 or 2 60s in the group etc). 
---
Don't have a problem with streamers. I have a problem with their fans. Having one on your server will shift factions to weigh heavily in one direction, q-times will be awful and all the streamsnipers and their zealot followers will be all the server revolves around. 
---
Also, some of the more prominent content creators of Classic related stuff are hyperbolic or just very obviously cashes in on the Classic hype, even though a lot of their tips/tricks, leveling guides and such will be outdated come Classic launch. 
---
This is one of the best things about official classic. You will have servers for your language, your time zone and they will be located in your country so you will have excellent pings.
---
I hated private servers latency. So glad thats over.
---
I agree that guild drama is not really something to look forward to. 
---
No matter how fair you try to make the guild, how impartial the leadership tries to be toward it's members, drama tends to pop up eventually.
---
 Maybe it is just ingrained in human nature, but as soon as a guild finds itself making the server firsts, many of the attitudes in the guild change to needing to stay the "best" and weeding out the "Dead-weight" starts to become an issue when, in general, people were happy to log in and make steady progress before they were the "Best"
---
Sometimes too much success can kill a guild just as much as poor attendance, loot bias/issues, etc.
---
&gt; Enjoy the damn game
---
I enjoy it by going fast. Other people like different things than you. Move on.
---
A compromise would be nice. I'll be queuing for BGs as often as I can, happily 1.12 will mean I can do that without gimping myself as badly as I'd have to by travelling to AB or ST from wherever I am in the world.
---
Mine also still works👍
---
There was a guild "Lucky Strikes" on Garona-US in Cata who invited anyone, in order to get the guild achievements &amp; associated perks. When they got the guild to level 25 they made an announcement they were cutting back to the original guild (which was a small 10-man raiding group) and after a few days, they started culling 100's of plebs from their roster. The ensuing drama &amp; tears were like pure gold.
---
There was a thread on MMO Champion, it's probably still there somewhere.
---
There have been some drama between certain Twitch streamers and Youtube streamers which made the hate for streamers worse everywhere. But I think a majority doesn't care, except when streamers from any platform are casually just advertising their streams here.. that's just annoying.
---
1. I think blizzard understood that this peoject is not aimed at the general audience, rather a specifically targeted group of people who dont welcome anything of this. 
---
2. Production of classic doesnt need huge amounts of capital, so margin on it will be big enough so no MT needed.
---
3. The finishes product already existed without MT so it might contribute to thrm not adding any in the first place. 
---
You literally said that rogues were not a top dps in pve. Perhaps you meant “the” top dps, but yes if you scroll back to your first comment you most certainly said it. 
---
I love how you people think they got rid of people at random. They only got rid of 8% of their employees, a vast majority of which were probably making less than $15/h, which is pretty close to the minimum wage in CA
---
Warden Staff for druids...
---
It's possible. My past few runs on p servers have been about 8-9 hours to 20 on a paladin (sub 24 to 30). 1-10 on the slow side of 3 hours because I have a custom route that takes into account possible congestion at launch. 11-20 is 5-6.
---
xp rates completely blizzlike.
---
The situation is extremely blown out of proportion. Customer support can be automated, therefore they don't need to keep paying people to do it. Plus they are hiring more dev positions, so more people are actually working on the game. But one guy who posted on the forums a lot got laid off so Blizzard is evil!!!! 
---
If you actually knew how to rogue in Vanilla, they’re pretty good. The damage is insane especially if they get their openers off.
---
Bro please :(
---
At launch, like 80% of those quests are going to have competition. That 2:07 will likely push the 3-4 hour mark.
---
There is already multiple duel specs, you just got to pay to switch your talents to PvP ones to duel efficiently.
---
If you need a healer backing you up that doesn’t mean you’re the best lol you can literally say the same about any class “if you have a healer backing you up.” 
---
Rogue isn’t good vs warrior but warrior isn’t good vs mage. That’s vanilla.
---
Yes it does.
---
Not a vanilla warrior thats for sure hes gonna need a break after 2 chops downs haha
---
Dwarf Rogue. Sub spec. Stealth everywhere and only grind in the most obscure locations. Immediately vanish and sprint away if an enemy player comes into view. If necessary use preparation to vanish/sprint again. Carry around invisibility potions to use just in case, and also level engineering for gnomish cloaking device and other potentially lifesaving items. Never come out of stealth when all my safety cooldowns aren't available. Never fight mobs with DoTs or anything else that will prevent stealth. This way there will be almost no way even a very determined high level player will be able to find me.
---
Theoretically with this strategy the only threat to my life will be stealthed rogues and druids, and maybe a hunter managing to tag me with hunter's mark from 100 yards away depending on draw distance. But this is my life, so that risk is unacceptable. I will spend a lot of time in cities playing the AH and twinking myself out. The only stat I care about is stamina to survive burst long enough to escape, but I will also carry around and constantly have active any consumables that will increase my survival chances. For example I will have restorative potions to remove hunter's mark, faerie fire, and anything else that might disrupt stealth. Stoneform will take care of bleeds and poisons. As long as I live long enough to be able to vanish -&gt; invis pot I should be safe.
---
I still have my MX518 from 2004. Used my MX510 until i dropped it while moving. Didn’t realize the MX518 was such a revered mouse lol 
---
Agreed. However most of them will roll on PVE servers to avoid harassment which makes our decision easier.
---
Soda was on Nost PVP since he wasn't streaming private servers. So it's possible he'd roll on a PVP server since that's his game.
---
Keep in mind the risk involved. If they're willing to kill their channels with 15-year-old game corpse-running content then they've earned their PVP server status IMO.
---
We do? Lol
---
Some just don't want to play on the same server as them as they impact gameplay negatively or otherwise
---
Please take just 5 minutes and read about how businesses work before you make a stupid comment like this again.
---
This message brought to you from Logitech tm
---
Who else will tell me that they are still working on classic every month or so?!
---
Post got removed. Great. I will just repost it without the names.
---
Well, good for you that you didn't encounter the warlock that was shooting everything on AV in January of 2017. That I guess you didn't play when server got shutdown for a week because S stole donation money and OVH shut them down after the charge back. Or when wk literally stole E database and then relaunched it as L, which, by the way, was also a downtime for about a week.
---
If that is fine by you, then be my guest. I was happy when they relaunched N as E, but it took them less than two month to show the actual ugly side of private servers. N was somewhat clean, aside from accusation of trading with Chinese. E and then L was nothing but a shitshow. That's why I was so glad that Classic go announced, so I can play the game without having to worry that some slav will steal the server tomorrow.
---
I am going to be leveling a warrior in the hopes of tanking at max level. I played vanilla back in the day and I have leveled a warrior multiple times on private servers. However I have always leveled as a miner with Blacksmithing and I always had cool gear I made (Shining Silver Breastplate) and such, but was always so low on mount money. So I am curious if the blacksmithing route is a good way to go since you can level it up as you level or if it is better to go with some other combination to help level that is less costly (Alch/Herb). I am not a hardcore player, I will probably binge early but I will only have max 10-15 hours a week to play.
---
I cannot wait for classic to be out. and thank you
---
You realize everyone else would also have the same "go out st night" plan right?
---
That's not really true. Not every class benefits equally from a pocket healer.
---
I raided with one and cleared everything up to naxx. We also had a feral tank so the group was feral enhance me(2h) fury (dw) hunter. Someone from our group would be #1 dps for every single fight and he would never hesitate to heal if we needed it. And he would save his last mana for wf totem if it got to that. I would much rather have enhance/feral buffs than a hunter in raid. 
---
What you don't want gen and trade chat to be filled with retarded twitch memes?!
---
Pallies are great 10-18 in Darkshore. We get SoR rank 2 at 10, rank 3 at 18.
---
If you can live without Blessing of Wisdom and the newest Holy Light 14-18, you're fine, nothing really of value is lost.
---
People are in for a rude awakening when they see how dominant Hunters are in open PvP, especially at low levels and during early content
---
Well guess I'll be playing a Dwarf Paladin with an f-ton of Swiftness and Free-Action Potions to abuse slowdown effects.
---
Also I would message my brother and friends of my situation and make sure I play with them at all times. Strength in numbers!
---
The driving notion behind no changes that I think some people are failing to grasp is that people don't trust Blizzard as they are now to make good decisions. 
---
Excellent way to loose a shin. Godspeed el choppo
---
Tbh I think that's inevitable at this point even if no streamers were playing classic, it's so deeply engrained in gaming culture right now. 
---
Avoid anything involving Murlocs.
---
I still have my vanilla mouse, Logitech really makes quality hardware.
---
https://i.imgur.com/MIDYQDb.jpg
---
Find a solid set a people. One would be a warlock. Spend enough time talking to them and see if I can confide the truth of the situation to them. See if they're reasonable. 
---
Have the warlock of the group summon me to instances. Instance grind to 60. Joke around with them after 60 about how I was playing "hardcore mode" but only wanted to play that way for leveling.
---
top is a very specific term. the top is the top. there is nothing above the top. rogues in 1.12 have great pve dps yet they are not top of the line and that is exactly how i worded my post. 
---
you can broaden the scope and say they belong to the top tier of dps classes but then again, they are last in that tier.
---
 FD and log out in the inn any time shit gets scary 
---
no logging out if you are trapped in a VR, only way to get out is when you ding 60.
---
....You actually believe we have unregulated capitalism?
---
Leveling and doing Dungeons with People. And actually talking to them and not just pressing a few Buttonts to get teleported somewhere together with a few Robots that don't talk.
---
Yea the Russians were shady, good thing all I had to do was change my realm list to play on L and haven't had an issue since. Being not able to play for 1 week because one coup went down in 3 year time period isn't the end of the world. That's still over 99% availability. 
---
WotLK footage, he's specced Titan's Grip
---
So, like Ironman on a vanilla PvP server, but irl. A lot depends of whether the server is populated or not - if it is, best bet is to find a few friends for leveling. And don't f&amp;ck up. Ever.
---
Just using my common sense. Which some people lack apparently. And that’s okay. 
---
Will I be relatively safe playing on an EU PVP server?
---
It's quite accurate... for a level 30 warrior who just got Whirlwind Axe lol.
---
There should be a streamers only server and they would be forced to just have a circlejerk of streamers just streaming streamers streaming.
---
I'd watch that online. :)
---
I charge right into Hogger at Level1!
---
Yea so what's the problem exactly? 
---
As a lock you can quite easily solo them and considering noone else goes near there you should get one soon enough if you're not totally unlucky; I got two and I only killed like 30 of them 
---
Actually there's even a skill with 12 ranks, mage's fireball. Frostbolt has 11 different ranks as well along druid's rejuv. All of these are from the AQ20 books. 
---
Oh hell yeah
---
I would personally not interfere in other their fights, let the enemy heal up and then fight them fair and square.  I've had a lot of people just leaving me alone in 2005-2006, at most a wave at times. The decent players would challenge you at times and you would fight to the death and the people that weren't integrated into the servers social segment would sometimes attack you randomly, usually resulting in their own demise.
---
Rogues are generally beaten by fury warriors due to the insane itemization that fury warriors have access to early on in the content. It is not until a rogue has access to almost full tier 3 that the itemization is equal (and greater) to that of fury warriors in vanilla in terms of AP/Crit/hit/setbonus gains from gear pieces. Whilst fury warriors will find "few" upgrades in Naxxramas, your general rogue will replace close to every slot of gear, often with very substantial improvements. With this in mind rogues are absolute mad when they reach and exceed the same power level as their melee counterparts, however when they do reach that level there is no more progression to be had in terms of content - so are they really the top pve dps class in the late game? Not really, but in the "super late game"? Sure, although at that point noone really cares.
---
Correct. It's good for PVP, but fairly useless elsewhere.
---
But your post wasn't about 'class that looks the best while being good at what he's doing'
---
T2 Pally is the best looking class.
---
the prompt says you are the only one in this scenario, everyone else is playing like normal
---
I have an old G5 (successor to the MX518) I've been using since the WoTLK days - a good ten years. Saw this ad and thought this is pertinent to Classic :)
---
I guess what it is is that I know when Classic comes I have to play it, but honestly I don't really feel like playing it. Still alittle burned out from classic pservers. Not gonna fall behind the curve and start classic late though. Also must started streaming some retro games and other stuff, gonna have to put it all down for classic and that's only like 3-6 months away. Guess I'll try to rush endgame so I can raid log and play some other stuff.
---
Let’s assume that you’re lucky and roll on a server with a decent guild that’s going to be ok bringing an enhancement shaman...
---
Why is that guild going to pick you over all the other people wanting that spot?
---
I’m not trying to be rude, but nothing you’ve said sets you apart from the rest. Standing out is the only way you have a chance at getting that raid spot.
---
No I do not want to sit and watch other people play wow. Some streaners like to say that they create community and what not, but I do not believe that. They create a community around them, that they control, and not in the game on its own terms. I think large streamers could have a lot of negative influence on server communities and I will do my best to avoid them.
---
You joke, but I'm surprised we aren't seeing this in AAA gaming. Streamers are an important aspect of marketing and growing your community, but they also have costs associated with them, (such as how their presence affects other gamers), I'd think having 'streaming servers' would make a ton of sense. 
---
Even as late as MoP, I was trying to get a battle pet restored, and the GM gave me a whole RP spiel about having to catch the pet and convince it to get back in its carrier. I did get the pet back so I wasn't too fussed but it sure was... something.
---
Well then.. that changes everything. I wonder why though since if it was everyone would make for a much more interesting meta
---
Felwood is an excellent idea! I totally forgot about it. Yes, it’s very barren as far as players go, and would be an excellent spot to grind to 60. Winterspring has far too many alliance, and the mobs are mid-high 50s, so I think I’d avoid that area, but Felwood has plenty of high-40s and low-mid 50s.
---
If I remember correctly, even level 50 mobs are green to a 59 player, so that would work well.
---
Can't purge bubble ;)
---
Ah yeah people who get criticized in any capacity actually did nothing wrong and people are just sheeples
---
Clearly Hitler did nothing wrong by that logic 😎
---
Yeah, nicely meme'd OP but that just gives me chills...
---
solo
---
I come from a family of fisherman and loggers. And me being lefthanded it's all I ever heard.... Or worried about lol. 
---
The lightning is cool but chain heal looks like a holy spell which breaks my immersion somewhat.
---
My vote would be warlock, really badass look (sets) with fire/shadow spells.
---
Rush end game and earn the right to raid log
---
Yea hes not respondign to me even so idk what he's on about tbh.
---
And below some other guy gave him multiepl examples of issues with the said realms and then we havent mentioned something every private server has had and thats as you said the iffy ping for a ton of people. Another thing is that theres always inaccurate spawntimers, bugged quests(!!), unstable management and leadership, poor support, poor anti-cheating etc in comparison.
---
So its just delusional to claim private servers offer a better experience qualitywise. It really really is factually wrong.
---
My god, I can just imagine the thousands, if not tens of thousands of eager Classic players jamming out to this song on 10 hour repeat while slaying nothing but boars in elwynn, living that nostalgic dream.
---
Oddly enough, this time it ain't gonna be a dream. This time, our reality *will* be LIVE TO WIN, 'TILL YOU DIE, 'TILL THE LIGHT DIES IN YOUR EYES!
---
CLASSIC, HERE WE COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOME. ARCANITE REAPER-HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
I'll invite you to my guild! We'll have lots of fun!
---
This makes me think of the video of the Ventrilo chat where they trick the kid into joining a group during a duel and make his twink level. (NSFW) https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PAymFijzM_I
---
Anglo countries suck at any other languages a whole lot more though 
---
Yes activison has greed on the mind, but I don't think theyll jack up classic too bad.
---
I feel like server transfers and wow tokens are going to be put in the game after a while. Maybe not right off the bat, but theyll be in there. I also wouldn't be surprised to see name / race / gender changes either. I hope they wouldn't add these but it really wouldn't surprise me. 
---
I would still play classic though with all of that in there. As soon as they start adding pets, mounts, and any sort of transmog into the game though.... Thats when I draw the line. 
---
And the meme called it the madness!
---
Indeed, and the typical chestpiece u r expected to wear is an ugly teal robe (robes of the exalted) for quite a long time. And you might replace it... for another similar robe from AQ. That is until you're able to get T3 chest (4HM token).
---
They also want to maximise profit. If they believe that adding mtx will outweigh the revenue lost through people choosing not to sub, they will do it... I'm not saying that it would be the case, but the only goal for these people is to maximise profit. Everything else is a means to that end.
---
uhhh no, just stop talking lol
---
yes, you need the last rank 12s Divine shield
---
Actually doing dungeons sounds scary, I would probably just farm the mobs outside the entrance until level 40 or so. After that, I would just hire people to kite mobs from Western Plaguelands into Tirisfal glades and level up that way.
---
Enhance resto is useless, Eleresto is good up to ZG but you probably need straight resto after that. 
---
I think the GM's that were involved on the forums probably played a bigger role in this. I hardly ever talked to a GM in game and when I did it was only for a ticket and I didn't give a shit what they said to me as long as they helped lol. 
---
GMs as far as CMs though... They definitely improved relations and helped the community. 
---
40 man raids. Most people hate them... 
---
I LOVE THE CHAOS!
---
The Turing Test is far different than automated customer service. 
---
TT involves a multidimensional scope of human conversation. All topics have to be considered when programming an AI to pass it.
---
The scope of conversation for customer service is much narrower. Further, there have been AI bots that have been very successful in this specialized context.
---
They've confirmed this x2 officially, both highly upvoted posts 
---
No there is no such thing
---
By playing BfA - no risk of meeting another player 
---
But how did he get to 60 though.
---
Why are YOU so certain such a bias exists. Why do YOU think it is anything more then a vocal minority.
---
Personally I find streaming as a career makes people obnoxious and inflates their self worth to the point where all interactions they make in games are focused only on themselves and making content for their audience.
---
Tips Out has a great video where he breaks down some DPS numbers from what I believe is early Molten Core.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0wciSPO9zg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0wciSPO9zg)
---
It is a reply. It is kind of rude to just ignore ppl.
---
Don't forget 20 man raids started in Vanilla as well. 
---
*laughs in Free Action Potion*
---
Divine Shield rank 2 is 12 seconds and you get that at level 40
---
It would be totally awesome
---
Azshara was one of my fav zones and it just needed a little polish, something to really happen there, because the zone being dead saddened me tbh
---
That could be done in some other places too - Grim Batol for sure
---
I'm against adding KZ raid but making the zone more useful could be exciting, maybe some underground questline
---
Geared warrior + priest &amp; pally heals = murder machine
---
Question about European servers, are they all just randomly grouped as "European", or are there specific servers for French, German, Italian, etc? Or do those communities just migrate to their own servers organically?
---
The only way you'll get a is in a guild pugs it's ffa.
---
Why do you need a guide. Just level in night elf zones and do every single quest in the zone. 
---
But, you should expect blizzard to hit pserver hard from the moment Classic releases, making your characters always being at risk of being destroyed. Plus the normal shenanigans and drama of Pserver guys. Also, things that can't be fixed, like the huge populations requiring super fast respawn rates which in turn unbalance the whole leveling experience.
---
Yea, corporations can easily become part of the state. 
---
I've always made them for free
---
I was also one of the most famous enchanters on my server and didn't charge any mandatory amount of gold, but some people gave huge tips :)
---
As others have said, it's not the streamer - it's the combination of the streamer and their fans.  Watch some of the streamer's videos and you'll see a raid worth of people just following them around like paparazzi.  Imagine trying to quest in Westfall when Asmongold is in there, and everything is laggy and there's no mobs to kill because he's got 50+ people following him around.
---
Now imagine this is STV and you're on the opposite faction.
---
Now imagine you're in trade chat and you say something that shows up on his Twitch feed, and a bunch of them start whispering and harassing you for it.
---
Now imagine right-click reporting is in the game and they see you in trade chat.
---
It's not about avoiding the streamers.  It's about avoiding the toxic situations where a mob of people exist.
---
Bingo, I'm expecting to be put through a blender 1-60
---
I'd swap Priest and Shaman.  Priest is getting so much survivability (Blessed Recovery, Improved Inner Fire, Spell Warding) and quite a bit more damage through Spiritual Guidance Force of Will (which translates to more survivability via Vampiric Embrace).  Not nearly the synergy of the pure DPS classes, but still quite good.
---
Also hard to evaluate warrior.  Rage capping might be an issue, but they can do so many things so much better.  With stance dancing and advanced macros they could be truly unstoppable.
---
Hm, I agree with you for R13+ and prot warriors, but furies look like shit
---
One thing you have to keep in mind is that **in a raid you're in a highly specialized environment** compared to the rest of the game.  A mage in a raid may just spam frostbolt.  A mage while leveling is going to use frostbolt, frost nova, cone of cold, blizzard, fire blast, blink, polymorph, fireball (if the target is immune to frost), ice barrier, fire ward, ice ward, counterspell, ice block, evocation, mana shield, arcane explosion, and probably a few I've forgotten.
---
Same applies to pretty much every class.  In solo, PvP, and even in 5-mans, you need to use a lot more of your class, but when you get to a raid you focus specifically on your assignment.
---
The other reason people have a lot of abilities is that **you have most of the abilities for all 3 specializations**.  In Vanilla, a mage gets Arcane Missiles, Fireball, **AND** Frostbolt.  In live, a Mage gets Arcane Blast, Fireball, **OR** Frostbolt.  And sometimes which one you use is dependent on which one you most recently ranked up.
---
Yeah, I didn't specify that I want it to be functional too, my bad. 
---
Shh just let them scream no changes until they fall asleep.
---
I'm assuming you probably want the mount. I'll recommend this [video by staysafe](https://youtu.be/28uB4ym6TCM)  and for all the reputation quests checkout this [link to classicdb](https://classicdb.ch/?faction=69#quests:0+3+1+2) 
---
Gearing is more complicated because in live you basically have a formula.  Gear has X Strength, Y Stamina, and Z of 2 secondary stats.  Of the same item level, X, Y, and Z will all be the same.
---
In Vanilla, you might have a piece with 23 strength, another piece with 17 stamina and 10 strength, another piece with some random proc to hit 3 enemies with lighting, or another piece that has 14 stamina, 9 strength, 4 agility, and 9 spirit.  
---
Weapons have different speeds and that has a huge effect as well.
---
I think as we progress through classic it will get more alt friendly. I'm guessing when we're in BWL / AQ40ish, there will be GDKP runs in MC / Ony. May even be sooner than that, maybe while we're still in MC. I'm sure BWL / AQ40 will be both being ran up until Naxx so gearing up alts shouldn't be a problem. 
---
Sounds like sth for me, if Bis actually looks good. Thanks, I'll try on some private server. 
---
I'm not optimistic.
---
True, but I will have to be prepared to die in a rogues stunlock on any class I pick until full t2/2.5 :)
---
Every other class won't do enough damage to last through dots and SL + HS + coil etc. then when I'm geared I can blow them up with destro for some sick pvp montages
---
whats the main composition?
---
Yea I get what you’re saying, I got hung up on the word “top”. To some top dps means a tier, as you mentioned, and to others it means the single top. Seems we are in agreement despite viewing the words slightly different. Doesn’t matter. 
---
I’d be curious what the numbers are like pre-Naxx. Obviously 1.12 threw a lot of curveballs because everything prior to that, fury warriors weren’t even really in the raid, so I’m curious to see how it’s going to go with Classic. 
---
With sweeping strikes and cleave!
---
Picked up one off these bad boys today, and couldn't be happier. It's literally the first mouse that I've been 100% satisfied with since my original mx518.  
---
I would love it, but I don't think ActiBlizz can do it. I would wholeheartedly accept this if the original classic team was behind it. They crafted such an amazing world that I could never help but wonder what their plan was for all those zones. I wanted to see The Emerald Dream and go into Uldum. 
---
Can we also face the fact that after vanilla has been out for a few years, we're all going to be tired of it? I played over 80 hours per week and I'm super excited for that game to come back, but I know there's going to be a limit to my attention span. We're going to need something new at some point. I'm just upset that they're going to ruin it when the time comes.
---
Perfectly fine to spam to me? I use them mostly for CDs though, still use keyboard for rotational abilities.
---
1. Go Rogue.  Group up with people, just leech their kills while I'm stealthed.
---
2. Go Paladin.  Only fight the lowest-level green mobs so I continue to get XP, but do not risk death.  For example, if I am level 20, only fight level 15 mobs.  Hunter is another good choice for this strategy.
---
Maybe I'm just too much of a cynic, but I could them doubling down on anything they do to fuck classic up if it goes to shit.  I really hope it doesn't happen but I just don't have any faith in Blizz anymore.
---
Mages, warriors, paladins, hunters, shadow priests all have a very good fighting chances unless a rogue really goes balls to the walls with all CDs and 10min cooldown prep usage.

A average geared WL has 2,7-3,3k health, is a clothie, his trinket does not break stuns. The warlock is the only class that literally dies in a cheap + kidney, because you really sit 8seconds in a stun. Longer with gouge and restealth. Most classes have ways to pressure the rogue, the warlock... is just a mushroom doomed to die.
---
Ah I can see where that would make the difference. I tend to put skills like Hamstring or Sinister Strike on the mouse thumb buttons so in my case it's really bad. Which is a shame since Logitech stuff is such quality across the board.

*laughs in Skull of Impending Doom Macro*
---
Fuck yes!!!
---
I got MX518/G400/G400s anxiety years ago and horded them. I was buying them for $80-$120 a pop right before they stopped making each model, starting a decade ago.
---
I've still got two G400's in a box as backups from 2013.
---
I've played on a Private Server that did this.  They had their own classless system where every other level you could grab an ability from any class and apply it to your character, which was really awesome.  It was actually a WotLK build, but Vanilla content, and I ended up with a melee healer, who had both the enhancement shaman and retribution talents to proc instant Flash of Light and instant Healing Wave and Chain Heal.  (Not to mention a lot of self-heals like Bloodthirst, Seal and Judgement of Light, and Divine Storm, and a few instant heals like Rejuv and Holy Shock).
---
However, when that server first launched, it was a hardcore server.  When you died, you dropped a chest with some of your items.  It was a FFA PVP server, so you could get ganked by your own faction (and items dropped from PvP).  There were other elements in there as well.  I believe they even wanted to release a version that was basically a survival game where you had hunger and even more to deal with.
---
When they only had the FFA server, most people would play up until they got out of protected territory and then just quit, because you could get ganked by your own faction in your own city.  The server saw a massive population boost when they made the "normal" server (which was a PvP server with the classless system).
---
Anti-QOL changes would be just as bad for the game as QOL changes.
---
I would much rather see them develop TBC and WotLK servers.
---
&gt; Could you get by to 60 fine with only quest reward weapons and dungeon drops?
---
Sure can. Once you hit 51 you can pick up the ice barbed spear which will last you until 60.
---
Classic requiring more skill is subjective. People confuse the difference between Casuals and Hard cores these days. To a hard core player. Retail is harder it's Mythic raids are much harder then anything classic offers. Same with rated pvp. That being said Retail takes HC people with no time on their hands and thinks they are "casuals". When in fact they aren't. Casual players rarely raid. They rarely even consider raiding. When they made Raid Finder they didn't really make content for casuals. It's content for HC players with no time.
---
Going back to the original point. If you are a casual. Classic wow is the much harder game. Leveling is way more engaging and difficult. Questing is much more "involved". Dungeons require co-ordination and team work. All of the aspects of the game blizzard decided were just "noise" or filler. Are still in full effect. So from the perspective of a casual the game is much harder. I will also say if you are hardcore. Classic is not as hard but it is far more rewarding then retail.
---
Remember a casual is not a hard core raider that has no time so he does LFR. A casual is the guy who hit sixty and now spends 4 hours a day sitting on the AH selling portals. A casual is a 50 year old mother of 3 who loves helping her friends in the raid on her warlock by "passing out candy" (yes I knew a lady that lived for that and quit when the summon vendor spells dropped in bc.) A casual is the guy who spends all day helping everyone else level because he likes to help others through dungeons. If you are a casual classic wow is miles ahead of Retail. The Hardcores have no use for the casuals anymore.
---
Hmm, I guess I missed those posts. Thanks for your input though.

I can destroy mages as a warrior, but I need intimidating shout 
---
Need always.  The game has a random roll for a reason.  If the other guy gets nothing, it's the fault of the /roll system.
---
My personal experience says yes, blacksmithing is a good way to go.  Other professions rely on crafted goods from blacksmiths so if you're aware of what's in demand, you can make good money off of it.
---
It's hard, honest work, and may not net you a profit like alchemy and herbalism combined, but if you're playing a plate class, it doubles as a great source of gear as well.
---
Correct. But they have zero incentive to learn another language. Except some Americans who live in border states do speak Spanish quite well. 
---
You act as if killing non aggressive boars is a challenge. Not efficient, but hardly "the worst".
---
Because this is 2019 and anything that makes anyone else uncomfortable must be banned or regulated.
---
Oh, if you have a 1h and skull of impending doom on I wouldn't bother polymorphing lol, just nuke.. You wont break my barrier. Skull of impending doom isn't all that useful for warriors sadly, you need it equipped for 30 secs before you can use it.
---
lol ok kid, keep telling yourself that.
---
Nothing more scary than a fresh 40 BM hunter with bestial wrath up
---
It's out already? 
---
I used to have a similar problem back in the day around '07. My frames would be just fine unless i alt-tabbed out or did like you did and logged out and in. But once i shut it all down and started up it was fine. 
---
Unfortunately i don't have an answer to your question just a similar problem from back in the day. 
---
I play retail and it doesn't seem to have as many problems. If i have frame drops its because my rig can't handle everything at the settings i have them at.

Never do a dungeon....

Fucking knew this would be the top comment
---
Because they are all just "self promoters" bar one or two. They are simple manipulators who say " we are going to down so and so tonight" no! You are downing that boss and saying the word "we" to make it appear it's a team effort so please keep donating to me.  
---
They bring nothing but bad luck to servers due to their retarded and toxic followers who agree with everything they say. 
---
Then they moan about paying taxes as a streamer, yet consider it a real job 🤣.  
---
I will watch streamers closer to classic release purely so I can see what servers they are going on so I can avoid them. 
---
I'd roll Tauren Warrior and die in all gloriousness against a pack of level 8 wolves I didn't intend to pull !
---
Yes, released today. At least in Sweden.
---
Hey guys, I know this isn't strictly classic so please remove if inappropriate. I am a huge lover of BC though, as I suspect many of you are, so I thought you might enjoy this exploration of one of my favourite zones in the entire game.
---
I fall asleep to this one every night! 
---
Try fighting soul link lock 1v1 they will facetank all your damage heal with healthstone + lifedrain and /laugh as dots drain your health to zero without the fight even coming close &gt;:)
---
I played a Shaman during TBC, the time when they had the most abilities in the game and even then I could do it quite easily without a fancy MMO mouse. Instead I use a mouse with two side buttons and what's already there, 1, Shift+1, Ctrl+1, Alt+1 and so on on my keyboard, for practically every button except WASD and Space. Once you do that you will be able to bind dozens of keys, even the useless totems like poison cleansing and still have room for more!
---
What classes best counter Rogues in 1v1?
---
Put battlemasters outside the city by the dueling areas. They’ll be RPing as recruiters to get the duelers to join their BG. 
---
It depends. If the person seems chill, I tend towards (A). If they're a prick I'll roll my off spec against their main, cause fuck them. Some important factors are how good is the item, for how many levels do I expect to have that item equipped, how rare is that item or how annoying is it to run the dungeon we're currently in. For example, if I still needed a Blackstone Ring, I wouldn't care if I'd already picked up a bunch of drops, I'd absolutely roll on it simply because it's that good.
---
Everyone would just party up and level as 5 then, too easy.
---
If we’re paying $15 per month, WE SHOULD HAVE GM’s!!!!!!!!  
---
Common sense based off what exactly??? No one knows how many people will play classic. 
---
They don't kill off servers they merge them
---
That's... That's what my new goal looks like
---
they delete any references to pservers so this might get deleted.
---
i think i see why we are in disagreement.  where i play the alliance have instant ques so its the horde rankers going around ganking.  flying from org to felwood is probably faster than riding from the wsg entrance.
---

That looks dangerous AF.  RIP feet (eventually)

I always found CCR's Run Through the Jungle to be a better fit...
---
You can literally bubble out of ANYTHING -- and then have total god mode tier invulnerability... with an instant cast button... every 5 minutes.
---
Its the definition of a bull s*** zero skill required panic button.
---
But then again, Paladins were designed to be a super low skill floor class that literally anyone could use.
---
I always tought Troll Shamans with a Zulian Defender were awesome.
---
Lol @ linking tips out
---
Warriors do more dps than rogue in a vacuum but the real world doesn't work the same as on paper. Warriors generate the most threat of any dps class besides warlock as they have no threat reduction in their talents. What does this mean? In MC before your MT gets thunderfury your rogues are gonna do a lot more dps than your furys as rogues can vanish to instantly reset their threat to 0. This allows you to do cheesy things like going full 100% dps from the very start of the pull and vanishing at the last moment before you pull off the tank to maximize damage uptime. Also your average guild MT probably won't be fully consumed every second of every raid unless you're in a top guild so this threat discrepancy can carry over to later raids like AQ/naxx. This is why hunters are so strong in MC compared to BWL+. Vanilla has better balance than you'd think not everything is about pure theoretical sheet dps.
---
At this point they should cosnider WoW Classic a frontline rlease.
---
And i am dead serious.
---
This is so true, I really love my rogue and it's gonna be my main class in classic, but Preparation skill is definitely a bad design. I'd rather have less powerful but shorter cooldowns.
---
I think everyone expects them to ruin it, but at the very least private servers get authentic numbers to work with.
---
Personally I think gold sellers are more detrimental to the game than time tokens.  I've yet to see a good argument against time tokens.
---
it was kinda stupid to have all these high levle people go to lowbie zones where people are trying to quest. It was fun though, I remember many battles outside of those entrances.
---
Prep limits game design? Is r/hearthstone leaking?
---
What they mean is no original releases this and WC3 remaster are both remakes so they aren't like D4 or anything big like that.
---
Lol, believe it or not, but I still use this mouse on my gaming PC.
---
I bought it to play warcraft3, I upgraded/changed my gaming PC more than 10 times between those years, and this mouse is still my main mouse, I love it.
---
Thanks for the precisions mate
---
in vanilla everything is
---
Great point re: world chat - I realise the chat won’t quite be the same as private servers (hopefully), but I really don’t want to read the dead shit musings of edgelords/second year university students who have figured the world out who want to let you know how ‘words are just words’, ‘religion Y is taking over the world’, or ‘Conspiracy X is 100% true, open your eyes sheeple’.
---
Eat my /ignore and fuck off somewhere else with that.
---
Also hello fellow Oceanic player! :)
---
I was going to go herb/alch but this convinced me to go herb/mining and then maybe make a dedicated gatherer later
---
I would watch you watch him doi---ok i won't do it. 
---
But a streamer server would be a way to keep them away from some of the people who mind it. I honestly don't care where they play. I am playing to get lost in another world so if they happen to be a part of it ill find a way to deal. 
---
I remember back in vanilla i played alli and went into BG at level 60 and saw that yellow beam for the first time. WTF is that priest doing was my reaction. 
---
Haha I am using that right now. Just bought it off ebay last week. Previously used a 510 for the last 8 years. 
---
As for the question, I was playing in Silverpine the other day and there are a few places that you can get surrounded really quickly if you aren't paying attention. Like on Fenris Isle if you step too far in one direction you are dead. 
---
Or Ambermill, when you have to go into the building and there is a mob around every corner and sometimes a rare spawn who is like 3 levels higher than everyone else. 
---
So a literal demo of the game isn't good enough of a source for you?
---
lol.
---
MMO mouse ... or it's a waste of money.
---
*I have all my gear already how dare you take the only piece I can use when you don't have any preraid BiS gear*
---
10 and a half hours it took for joana (world record) to get to lvl 20. 
---
8 hrs in unrealistic. 10 is super good, 12 is fine.
---
a) A level boost in classic is like buying a ticket for an event and then complaining that it takes too long.
---
b) This would set a dangerous predecent for any retail player. Once they know it can all be taken away they might as well quit sooner than later. And this is just speculation but I think the number of players required to make a profit is really low. Server infrastructure costs sure are less now than 15 years ago and the game will have less support and maintenance. 
---
**&lt;TBD&gt; \[H\] US-PVP**
---
We are a Horde based guild (working on a name, we are holding a March Madness style vote in Discord eventually), specifically catering to those who want to raid casually, but just don't have the time anymore to commit tons of hours into the game. The bulk of our group is "9 to 5ers" who work, have families, or other commitments that prevent a more hardcore schedule.
---
We want to be an effective and efficient guild, clearing what we can, when we can. Make no mistake, we will experience all content of Vanilla, simply at a slower pace.
---
**Possible raid Schedule:**
---
2 days a week (likely weeknights, possibly 1 weeknight and Sunday). The window for raids times would between 8PM EST and 1AM EST. This does not mean we would raid during this entire time, only that we have the possibility if members are willing to stay awake and push until 1AM EST.
---
**Loot Rules:**
---
We will use some form of DKP or EP/GP. We will use NO loot council (outside of very specific items, such as Thunderfury for the main tank) as it lacks transparency and perceived fairness.
---
If a casual guild for you "9 to 5ers" sounds enticing, please PM me and I can send you the Discord link.
---
Thanks!
---
Harpy leaders is the hardest one. 
---
Not only they throw out poisons, CC's, aggro together, but some of them have Execute spell.
---
How is poison cleansing pointless!
---
never said warriors are top dps throughout all content. also the data tips out presents is not on paper but actual measured raid dps which should hold up pretty well.
---
This is a really good point imo.
---
Exactly. Warrior might have some extremely exploitable weaknesses in a lot of 1v1 situations, but Warrior + Pocket Healer is greater than anybody else with their own healer. 
---
They laid off community managers, the glue between their players and the company. That precisely tells us how much they value their community. As if we needed that reminder after "don't you guys have phones?" 
---
I want to play classic, but at the same time Kotick disgusts me. 
---
It takes up a water totem slot which is used for healing so nobody uses it in raids since other classes can cleanse poisons far easier. Also, be honest, if you get poisoned while questing, how often do you cleanse yourself? Usually low level, non elite mobs poisons last about 30 seconds at most and do like 15% of your hp in damage, if that.
---
Also, nearly nobody would kill each other if they knew the other person would die unless there was something really good to gain out of it, like an instant 5 levels up or a million bucks if you get out.
---
let's hear it then. what is a pvp player then supposed to do instead when having to deal with a higher lvl player?
---
I make crappy WoW YouTube videos and I even hate myself. Many, many content creators have a very high or exaggerated level of self-importance, and on top of that, believe themselves to be experts on games that, truly, they're not. Obviously, I'm speaking anecdotally and/or subjectively, but it seems to be true quite often.
---
On the other hand, I think having a strong Twitch viewership is almost essential these days for the success of a game (at least for PC games or games that are a new IP), so I would definitely not go as far as to say that I *hate* content creators/streamers by any means, just that I can see why other people find them annoying or frustrating.
---
Yeah I forgot about that. Those harpies can be hell. It definitely makes it a lot harder when the mobs have more skills than the player. So you have to kite or really hope they don't resist/dodge attacks.

Is the build quality the same? I never appreciated it at the time but, after using modern mice, when I bust out my old MX518 I realize that it is SOLID. The plastics seem to have been much higher quality. 
---
If I used my MX518 as a weapon to fend off a home invasion it would probably still be usable. If I used my G600 it would blow up into 100 lego pieces, and I can tell every time I touch it as it creaks and groans and squeaks. 
---
While I love TBC as much as the next guy, I still think you should remove this as we're currently focusing on Classic right now and it's best to not stray too far down the expansion road *just* yet.

&gt;need to manually dismount when you want to fight
---
That's blizzlike btw, you needed addons to auto dismount, and auto dismount was integrated into the client in TBC.
---
&gt;busted droprates
---
How about the demo dropping TBC prefixes, like of the bandit?
---
Furthermore the demo client had model movement issues, where when wanding or autoing midair, characters would turn to face the creature they were attacking rather than continue to face forward. Really most of the movement was kinda scuffed (just strafe spam in the client and it feels slow because of the turning animation) and I doubt they'll end up fixing it because it's a small thing and it'd be a lot of work to fix I imagine.
---
If you throw in all of the mechanical errors - no extended AOE spellrange while moving, no ranged pushback AT ALL, and arcane missiles breaking on line of sight (all things I found within an hour playing ONE class before putting the demo down) I really struggle to believe anyone apart from you thinks it plays better than 1.12 clients currently in circulation.
---
y just some differences in the wording i guess.
---
i can only suggest you check out the videos of tips out on the topic as he as analized available vanilla raid data which gives some interesting insight into how the classes are doing at what stages of the game.

 Reply with the word ignore and I won't reply to your comments.

Yeah, sorry, we tend to try to focus down on Classic (aka, Vanilla) content here. Obviously discussion spills over quite a bit and we're OK with that as long as it's Classic-focused, but this seems to be almost entirely about TBC, so I'm removing it as per Rule #1. Sorry for the inconvenience. You might try r/wowservers or r/wow.

This is the **KING** of guides when it comes to Feral tanking. It is realistic in what fights a Feral can and cannot tank, it mentions when and where a Bear is good, and bad. It shows how useful a Bear can be as a dedicated OT. Anybody who doubts that Feral is a good tank needs to read this. 
---
As for DPS it is possible to output good DPS, but it depends on a number of factors.
---
For the most dps you can do as a feral cat you need to:
---
* Power Shift
---
* Farm Crowd Pummelers from Gnomer
---
* Use pots and other buffs always
---
If you want to ok DPS:
---
**AND**
---
If all you want to do is meh dps with a lot less effort
---
* Just power shift
---
Without powershifting a feral cat is not good dps. Crowd Pummlers add a lot of DPS, but Power shifting is far more important imo.
---
I can never tell if the people on this sub are trolling or if I am witnessing intense nerd rage
---
While leveling (say lv 15+) or endgame? Cause Priest can solo-aoe-farm DM:E from ~lv56 onwards.
---
I’m playing a Soul Link lock. Avoiding murder(ganks) would be the real challenge, and no class does it better.
---
Because it says something about the company which is hosting the game we gonna play. Like can we be certain they will treat their consumers nicely?
---
If this is the same issue I ran into after setting up the client all over again. It's been awhile but I think I resolved it by:
---
Going into my video driver properties (I use nvidia) , manage 3D settings and create a custom settings profile for Wow specifically (even if it's the same as defaults, but I did change some things including forcing vsync on).
---
I also ensured the launcher and path through all sub-directories had full admin rights upon launch.
---
I don't see the FPS change after alt-tabbing or logging out now. The driver settings and performance now seemed to maintain priority through game window changes.
---
OMG! I blew out 2 of these MX518s. LOVED these mice. The fact that they died was no fault of theirs as I put in some solid hours on them back in the day. What ended up happening is that the clicking function of the main buttons became impaired where you'd have to press very hard on them.
---
Such a good feel and you could repurpose some of the middle buttons for key functions.
---
Probably going to buy one if Classic ever gets released.
---
Got one a while ago off AliExpress for 50 bucks!! Worth it. I loved the original Mx518 and this is true to the original.
---
Because we're the ones forking over our money, and will stop if they pull some EA type shit.
---
Either or. Your response was helpful!

Classic isn't out. How do you have the client? Suspicious. 
---
nothing. thats life on a pvp server. i was simply amused that it is bothering some people enough to come up with a huge list of behavioural adjustments to minimize their chances of the encounter. i probably wouldnt play the game if this would strain me so hard that i came up with something like that.
---
Yep, this is my answer. Stealth everywhere, get you HoT to Bear /HoT to Travel form macros down.
---
Lastly, level in the water away from other players. Use waterform to escape pvp.
---
I don't hate streamers at all. I almost never watch them anyway, and certainly not their long live streams.
---
I don't like the impact in game if you play on a server with popular streamers. Classic should have enough different server options to dodge the existing big streamers so I'm not worried anyway.
---
All my warnings about hardcore guilds, players and streamers are just that; information for your consideration from someone who has personal experience with this. You may not care, or you may consider the information when choosing your server.
---
What about leveling? Other classes that can AoE level?
---
Best is subjective but they're without a doubt great at both. They're basically designed to gank people without allowing them to react appropriately. 
---
You don't know what the fuck you are talking about, my retail vanilla experience completing MC to KT is greater than your experience on some broke piece of shit private server where warriors are demi-gods. 
---
after naxx becomes old again, why not?!
---
Blade flurry is only what, 2 minutes? Adrenaline rush is 5?
---
Do you guys not watch streams? 
---
Solo while leveling I believe only Protection Paladins and Mages can AoE Grind- Prot Paladins are going to be later on as well as you need to be fairly far into the prot tree IIRC.
---
It depends on what angle they take. If there’s a significant amount of people paying for WoW subs *just* for Classic access, then Blizzard would already be getting a disproportionately high amount of money per head for the product they’re offering. That’s the biggest noneyspinner, and it’s why they bundled it with the sub rather than using an independent payment model.
---
I think they’ll want to add microtransactions if it ends up being successful in the long term, but I also think that they’re conscious of how some microtransactions could tarnish the experience. I’d expect them to stay away from level boosts completely. They might do WoW tokens though (using the “this replaces illegal gold sellers” argument) as much as I’d prefer that they didn’t. A cash shop for cosmetics is also on the table, but I’m not entirely sure what form they would take, given that most of what’s in the retail game wouldn’t translate well at all.
---
Don’t get me wrong, Blizzard monetizes *everything* that they ccsn get away with. But I do think that they’ll avoid anything that significantly damages the “warts and all” Classic design concept.
---
Oh, I only think in pvp. Sorry. 
---
I had a nvidia profile already and i also changed some things today but seems like it has 0 impact. I have vsync aswell and alt+tab works fine. My .exe has admin rights but i'll do it for the whole path as you said but i don't have hope tbh :d
---
Prot Pala. But then they only can AoE level and nothing else. 
---
Were people lonely? Like... Social interactions with GMs?
---
Situational. If I were 1v1 dueling trying to win as magr v war, I'd have my trinket equipped for that. In BGs, I'd probably save the trinket. A pvp-spec mage should basically never lose to a warrior, mage has cooldowns to counter anything the warrior can do. Unless the mage is pvping in bloodvine and the warrior is bwl+ geared. 
---
I've always thought that a female Orc in plate armor looks the best. 
---
I'm pretty sure that was faked and even if it weren't, it's not anything close to an AI that's indistinguishable from a human.  Any human who was asked to could easily figure out in just a few minutes if they were talking to a real human or not.
---
I am well aware, that’s why I mentioned it. I dont see every Classic server being flooded with P-Server Vets, there is just not enough to go around for every time Zone. There will definitely be servers that are behind in progression.
---
No longer checking this sub every day.
---
Can't tell if this is sarcasm or not, too much ignorance in here.
---
lol. Some of those vids may show aoe being used in combat, but I'd surely not say it's efficient aoe.
---
The damage the druid was doing using aoe was doing less damage, BY A HELL OF A LOT, that a dps druid would do mostly single target. Meaning, killing those one by one in a row would be faster ... much faster.
---
Has nothing to do with the numbers being off it's the fact that fury warriors got buffed pretty late into vanilla and by the time they became OP nobody had the bis list mapped out or months worth of the rare epic raid drops required make it work like pserver players who plan out their characters months in advance. If everyone had known back in retail that warriors would eventually get buffed and had the knowledge that we do today they would all be playing warriors too.
---
It depends which raid boss which is why I brought up patchwerk. On Patchwerk our warriors dominated the dps charts, on other fights like [this 4H kill,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUzWiQF1fMg&amp;t=7s) mages and hunters dominated. It depends on specific encounters in Naxx who excels the most. A lot of the raid bosses in Naxx are AoE fights and they destroy the damage meters with warriors barely in Top 10. 
---
Can confirm. I once kited that magma Giant from burning steppes all the way to goldshire. 
---
The quality does feel really good so far, but it felt a tad lighter than my old one from what I could remember so I put em up on the scale and yea, I couldnt find my old mx518 so the mx500 would have to suffice lol.

The shape is exactly the same and the amount of force for pressing all the different buttons is the same. The scroll-wheel is way better on the new one, dont know if it's worn out on the old but anyways. 
---
Mage can be even more powerful, once every 3 minutes.
---
Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face 
---
The guns of northwatch can cause some troubles. The priests can heal, theyre grouped up, and the escort quest there is long as hell.
---
It seems like Classic is being positioned as a retention tool for retail. This could be seen as a slap in the face for the diehard classic fans, but it does bode well imo for keeping classic pure of MTX.
---
* Blizzard / Activision seems to be reluctant to report on subscriber numbers between the two products (which might show that the flagship retail product is 'dying'). MTX presents a similar optic problem. They might feel pressure to report transactions between classic and retail separately - or given their decision on box/sub price for classic not offer MTX at all.
---
* Being positioned as a retention tool where there is low friction to being 'upsold' from Classic to retail might make Blizzard / Activision confident that any appetite for boosts is captured by people opting to do so on retail (coming along with the additional box purchases).
---
Any time a mob has a heal i try to bring the A-game. I usually conserve mana to make sure i can keep pulling without drinking but healing mobs make me through my brain out of the window and i just try to nuke them lol. 
---
Nah, rogues are good against squishes in world pvp. But a hunter or warrior will destroy them
---
I sure don't LUL
---
Yeah but horde need feral tanks for increased threat due to memefury &amp; no salvation. So yes they are needed on horde
---
Yup, I only really had a problem against good ice mages staying right out of range of melee, and to close to shoot lol, and decked out warrior who have a shitton of hp
---
The best rogue counter is a reck pally, you get opened on, you wait for the 5 stack, bubble or trinket to remove cc, stun the rogue and one shot him.
---
Ah, 'soon' in UK... Thanks Brexit.
---
Paladins were once known to aoe grind a lot more on private servers but that was because Consecration scaled with physical stats before being fixed. Most level Ret now because spell damage gear for paladins is a late game and even later patch reality.
---
I've seen many other builds being leveled. Those are the paladins 1 watch killing 1 enemy while I just killed 5 in less time.
---
With some feral tank gear, As long as i can go in bear form, a rogue can't kill me.  Even if he try to stun lock me, i will just wait 1 min until disminushing return kick in and only be at half health.
---
Ironic how streamers say no changes and yet bring the change. Did I ever tell you the story of Darth Asmongold the bald?
---
While definitely not a guide, here is a google doc I created to help me track which quests I've done on my way to exalted with Darnassus, maybe it will help you - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1spD5vcf5vt3CIVd_rJIfERlOs_4o1xYRcTUkIW8RNag/edit#gid=134288223.
---
So, if rogues are not.. prepared... They suck?
---
Some food for thought. Tauren make better shamans then Orcs. Stun resist is unnecessary. Once you get some gear Rogues are not hard to kill as long as you know what a shield does. Where as warstomp lets you get off a spell. Mega gigantic for any hybrid in pvp. Orc axe spec is good for pve but, lets be honest no one gives a damn about your shammy deeps. lol
---
I will also point out you can use the priest to do farming runs of DM. You can AE all them plant packs for lots of gold so the third char may be unnecessary.
---
As far as most brutal quest. I would have to go with getting your fire totems on a shammy. It's not brutal hard but, It's brutal lots of walking. Lots and lots of walking to obscure easy to miss paths.
---
Classic is made for a demographic that absolutely despises MTX and believes that it ruined the game.
---
HOOHOHOHOHO
---
Personally, I feel that Activision is planning to rely HEAVILY on server transfers to monetize Classic.
---
I think its inevitable that the majority of servers will be effectively dead within 3 months. WoW Classic is going to have a lot of very short term appeal for a lot of people.
---
Servers were dying out during Vanilla when the game was CONSTANTLY gaining huge numbers of players. Frankly I suspect that within 6 months we'll be down to maybe 7-10 US servers with healthy populations.
---
So, server transfers. The ethical and healthy thing for the game long term would be aggressive server mergers and free transfers, but I'm VERY confident that Activision is looking at population management as their only path to monetization beyond the monthly sub.
---
[Per the product page](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gaming-mice/mx518-gaming-mouse.html) it appears that it supports angle snapping.
---
Reading that first paragraph actually hurt my brain.
---
Jump off the cliff
---
It's not how vanilla was, and those who want to relive the game as it was don't want that crap. But if you enjoy some bootleg private server experience created by some Bulgarian teenagers then by all means vote for a 12k pop server
---
I was quite optimistic...until the layoffs (cost reductions), the quarterly report (most of their income in 2018 was from microtransactions and services) and the declared future for mobile and microtransactions as being priority no.1 for ActiBlizz.
---
Maybe they won't do it from the start, but they WILL DO IT, unless some kind of a miracle happens.
---
Now I am about 80% sure that Classic will have (from start or at some point) microtransactions,
---
Which will lead to all Classic fans dropping the game, being replaced by the "new generation" o gamers, and once this is complete, Classic will have LFD, LFR and other QoLs...because the newer player base will not only be ok with that, but will ask for.
---
Sorry man a skilled ice mage should be able to 1v2 a warrior and healer (except pally)
---
EU Kel'Thuzad Horde boi here. Good times
---
I prefer having to go to the portals themselves.
---
It's a deterrent against dodging by quickly switching BGs and it encourages people to go out in the world. Plus, you can gank that annoying player who kicked your ass in the last WSG when you know where he's gonna be right after the last cap.
---
Not faked. I'm not going to try to prove that to you. You can research it yourself. (Almost) no one is going to ID that AI in a couple minute cold call scenario. When you consider that voice is infinitely harder than chat and AI GMs are perfectly viable. I think you're likely ignorant of the state of the art. In fact I would wager you've interacted with an AI telephone agent and don't even know it. 
---
Seriously. Everybody says the best way to deal with this bullshit is to "vote with your wallet." Well guess what? 90% of the Classic community are people who chose that route and unsubscribed from WoW and voted with our damn wallets. If they fuck up Classic, we will do it again, its as simple as that. 
---
Thanks. I was concerned when I read that it was going to use updated materials. 
---
As for the weight: that looks right. The MX500 was definitely a fair bit heavier than the original MX518 so I think the measurements you've got there imply a faithful recreation of the 518. 
---
I'm really tempted.
---
So I have definitely looked into it and a lot of people say to start a tauren Shaman, I do love Mulgore a lot and like being a big ole piece of beef. I just really like orcs. To be fair it would probably be smarter to be a tauren for another reason. More people will be starting Orcs/Trolls/Undead than taurens so i may not have such a hard time in the starting zones. So I may just make a tauren shaman. But damn I love orcs.
---
Awesome about the priest. I am an Altoholic but knowing that my Priest can be my gold maker really saves me a lot of hassle with other characters. I guess ill just have to make my orc last....as a warrior or something lol. 
---
Oh my god yeah luckily i have that path memorized ahah, i hate the water one for sure, so much traveling. 
---
With 1.12 itemisation, because of the defense nerf you can't be def capped in pre raid bis without going for some green item of defense and loosing every other stats. Even in bwl tank aren't going to be def capped early on because you lose too much threat by trying to do so.
---
Excellent, so we can toggle it on and off as needed. Im sold haha
---
Not really, it's very slow. You need good spell damage and block gear to make it work which you won't while levelling.
---
if you can take a few extra steps to avoid dying and losing time, why not take them?
---
it read neither as if it's a huge burden to OP nor is it huge. looking around this forum, people are talking about way dumber shit just to pass the time.
---
I've done a decent amount of raiding as feral on private servers. I have 2 concerns for Classic, which is why I am not playing one as primary or even secondary likely ... at least early on:
---
1. I played feral in raids mostly when weightstones and weapon damage enchants worked on white damage in feral form. This inflated cat damage which helped greatly in raiding.
---
2. Once that was fixed and you could not use them anymore, feral still did OK if you were a tryhard, but being a tryhard on private servers was also very easy because consumables were easy to come by due to dynamic spawn tech added to counter the insane population. Consumables won't be as easy to come across in Classic if they truly are going for "no change" at launch with lower pop cap and no dynamic spawning of resources and mobs.
---
3. Math. We don't know if private servers were 100% accurate with their class, combat and raid mechanics (in fact we know they weren't for certain things).
---
It's an easy choice for me anyway, as I plan on playing Shaman first and I prefer druid on Alliance side. The reality of playing Druid in all roles though is the patience required to build multiple gear sets and being forced to change spec and role at times. It takes great planning to get BIS tank, dps and heal gear in the druid style. Some gear pieces are BIS for life and are sometimes lower level and certainly not part of pretty gear sets.
---
You have to do EVERY single night-elf quest. So just look up all of them and do them. And make sure you don’t let any quest become ‘grey’ because then they won’t give as much reputation 
---
No classes use only two skills in both of those raids- Warlock has the least and its like 4 spells you would use throughout MC. Not a huge difference from what you said, but it's worth pointing out it isn't actually 2.
---
Warriors actually out-threat warlocks most of the time because of Heroic Strike. Warlocks don't have any threat reducing talents either and the only set bonuses are for 8/8 T2 which is pointless because the set is so bad and 6/9 T3 which reduces threat on corruption and crits but it's quite far into Naxx.
---
You would do better using a restorative potion against sheep, dispels magic debuff every 5 secs for 30 secs. Either way Flask of petrification technically would counter it
---
an actual good game
---
I got a G502 a few months ago, and it would have easily won best mouse I've ever used had it not been for the poor build quality.
---
The scroll wheel is too loose and even slight side-to-side movements of the mouse makes it shake and make a sound/vibrate in its slot.
---
Also the left mouse button is much different than the right. It feels too springy and it always makes a very weird and annoying upward click when you  rest your finger over it and raise that finger suddenly.
---
Otherwise the buttons are useful, but it's just a very loud and rattly mouse.
---
Lol "vote" like we get a vote. Stop sounding so triggered boi, you're taking this too seriously.  
---
New shop item?
---
Enhance shaman raiding is miserable. Like you said no SS honestly though on a 45 second cool down was never gonna do much any way but in addition to that. Windfury is no way to pve. You will dies constantly to trash lol.
---
I believe I was exalted with all major cities after a lot of quests and handing in a lot of cloth. 
---
Then again, before becoming and acheivement whore in later iterations, I was a reputation whore. Basically exalted with everyone :D
---
But seriously. Get the Winterspring mount. Feel the classic grind. FEEL IT. 
---
Dude just go with the orc. If there is any chance for regret with race choice, you should not choose that one, cause in time you will regret it.
---
If you end up making a druid you should be aware that there is a really nice Bear trinket and a really nice Cat trinket that are both rewards from the same quest and you can only pick one. The Bear trinket isn't really replaceable and the Cat trinket takes a long time to replace.

Similarly you don't want to miss out on this tanking ring early on. https://classicdb.ch/?item=15855
---
Shamans have to wear dresses tho :(
---
You can’t still determine the outcome of most fights on retail with just the opener. 
---
I don't think linking a 4hm video for DPS logs says anything about the strength of warrior DPS when this fight is about tanking; theres 8 warriors (cant tell if theres more due to resolution) in the raid with 4 bosses to tank and all the warriors need to rotate in and out to drop Mark debuff, so they are not really dpsing at all, anyway.
---
As far as Naxx bosses being AoE heavy, there are only a few fights with a lot of minor trash mobs which mages handle more easy due to their spells can hit more targets at once (Anub'rekhan scarabs, Maexxna spiderspawns, Gluth zombies). All other fights where there are 2-4 adds in addition to the boss, a fury warrior will outdps mages with Cleave/Whirlwind.
---
Mages are super important for other reasons like decursing and sheeping or for fights where melee are incapable of DPSing due to boss mechanics so you need to bring a good number anyway, but purely as DPS they are not the top dogs even when you divide ignite damage between all the mages, the average fury dps still beats them.
---
Try /r/wowservers saying you're having trouble with the 1.12 client. This has nothing to do with Classic.
---
Thanks, I’ll be sure to check those out. Always hard to remember the exact details of the game a decade removed. 
---
Can’t wait for MC, by far my favorite end game raid in all of WoW. 
---
I mean I might. I played Hpal and was bored as fuck.
---
You have that regardless in classic. People camp herbs minerals ect and then upsell to their own faction or in the universal ah. I wasn’t suggesting that’s the only way you get easy supplies, I’m saying that every time you go for supplies in a city you may have to try different shops or actually take a second to look or trade with people. It would give an increase value to basic items. Silver in vanilla wow was important for the first half of the game! You have deliveries on a random timer and not the sole source. But you tune it, basically the point isn’t the idea itself specifically it’s a spiritual heart directional thing that would push the game in the direction it was created, rather than the streamlined no need for anyone outside of my guild blow through content as quickly as possible to end game changes, that seem to be the complaint a lot of us have. This wouldn’t even be a discussion if blizzard hadn’t lost so many subs. They aren’t doing this for any other first reason other than money. Everything else is secondary. They have made that pretty clear w their recent business history. Use existing IPs to drain our fan base of more micro transaction dollars on mobile... not exactly a secret. 
---
Also to those who only post no changes and that’s it, you aren’t getting vanilla as it was in release. If all you wanna do is scream no changes in the forums you can, lol, But blizzard isn’t giving u the original classic vanilla that I played and between all the different private servers you can get pretty close to what you’re looking for. No changes is antithetical to what WoW was and is still technically, an ever evolving changing world to play in using the lore and world of Warcraft. The spirit and the heart of the game were changed too drastically along the way to what it is now for my liking so I quit playing. If what you’re looking for is a verbatim recreation, blizzard has already said they aren’t going to be able to do that. They also aren’t really releasing classic for a no changes crowd. Eventually the game will drop and changes beyond what they already have made will be implemented. It is inevitable. My only hope is they correct their past mistakes when they do push forward again. I don’t really care how they make their money as long as I get content delivered in the spirit of classic. 
---
That's one of the core reasons why gamers are demanding old school style mmorpgs again: Every silly convenience thrown into the game takes away the impact community has on the game.
---
The freedom to be an asshole in a game is countered by the power and control the community has in game. This is entirely lost when a game nurtures the Ultra-Casual (the target or F2P and RMT driven monetizing). This is why a subscription is critical along and game content and design. 
---
Classic was designed for a specific audience. Every mmorpg prior to Wow was designed for a specific audience. It's called genre gaming, a concept not supported by venture capital and stock market driven enterprises. 
---
Blizzard just took a massive nose dive in influence with Activision. Blizzard products are the premiere front runners anymore. This Classic project may turn into their new gem and teach them what they have lost. Personally, I am hoping this is the case. I know it can swing a totally different direction so am waiting to see for now.
---
Depends on the gear. Early-game an SL lock will beat the smeg out of any rogue or anyone else for that matter except perhaps a shadowpriest. 
---
Retris as mentioned above will always have an easy time against rogues, it's their primary counter. I'd say a feral druid would be pretty tricky to get down as well. If the rogue can't stunlock them to death and since the druid trinket removes stun, that's unlikely.
---
I enjoyed playing Ret in raids even with Nightfall so I'm hoping something similar with Enhancement.
---
The primary factor is gear. If a warrior is decked with BiS gear and Dark Edge then yeh he will beat most of the mages in a mix of BWL and AQ gear. We had one warrior like this in my guild, with BiS and Dark Edge that did insane damage on patchwerk. It makes me want to roll one but I will stick to hunter again as main with possible warrior as main alt. 
---
I just want to fucking play already instead of debating this shit. 
---
So the problem is that those were the 2 I was deciding between in the first place. I will more than likely stay orc but seeing as I have an alt addiction I'll end up with both in the end. one will be enhancement the other will probably be ele.
---
Mained a r10 priest on Nost. As long as you can get enough mana to spam Holy Nova you can aoe the non-elite plants for booku dollars lol. Any caster can as far as I know.
---
Frostmourne here as well. o7
---
I see what you’re saying, but I’m not suggesting that. I’m suggesting npcs traveling a road w rewards for groups of players who can take them down and if they do, have negative consequences to the world we play in. That’s all. 
---
Go for it, you wont be disappointed. The shape is, as I said exactly the same, the quality feels superb and the hardware is modern.  Up to 17,000 fps capture rate, achieves 400+ IPS across the entire 100 - 16,000 DPI range with zero smoothing, filtering or acceleration.  
---
It doesn't get any better than that :)
---
Alliance also has paladins for blessing of wisdom and seal of wisdom.
---
Language specific. So you have/had german, english, french and i think spanish Servers. 
---
Because healing isn't the type of support character I like. I enjoyed being Retribution with a Nightfall and boosting others DPS. I mean I had legitimate hate mail from pugs but when I was raiding with a guild nobody was mad, even when I rolled on loot. Even was happy and it was a fun time. Obviously we didnt clear in all of MC in 15 minute speed runs but it was fun as hell and I'm hoping to recreate that experince over on the Horde side.
---
Got my first green on a pserver last week, shit felt so awesome. Saw a vendor was selling a white staff with 2x the DPS my current staff has. feelsgoodman.jpg to have stumbled upon that vendor and bought. 
---
I cant wait until gear means something and isnt just a handout
---
Night elf hunter.
---
I get ranged attacks and a melee weapon, a powerful ally in my pet which I can change at will. 
---
And I can briefly go invisible.
---
Plus my mount at 40 is a fucking panther, which in the lore were also used as weapons.
---
The obvious choice here is nelf hunter.
---
I'm gonna have to stop you there. Blizzard absolutely designed WoW to be casual friendly, and it wasn't a secret. It's just what was deemed "casual" back then is different from what is deemed "casual" now. Their philosophy never truly changed, the times changed. It was more of an escalation of their philosophy than a change in philosophy.
---
It comes down to the same in terms of classic WoW being in a good place of casual friendly, but still not an amusement park. But it's important we don't fall into these false narratives that get built about Blizzard one catering to a hardcore market. They weren't. WoW was casual as fuck in the context of the MMO market back then.
---
am I wrong or did they not have bestial wrath until 12+ months into the release of vanilla? I don’t Remember it until I was 60. 
---
Can you share the route you used to get from 11-20 in 6 hours?
---
Link it.
---
“Hey, this system has no downsides that anyone has actually proved, so it must be terrible.”
---
damn... well, the one who waits for something good, never waits too long. ;)
---
lol nice autism,  I'm just answering your weird questions 
---
I'm not sure how it scales up as you go, but I was able to pretty effectively AoE grind as a warlock 20-mid 30s. Rather than pure AoE spells though, I would pull with the VW, wait for him to get a taunt off, have him move on to the next mob. Each mob gets CoA and Corruption. Once you have enough mobs and VW is about to die, generally 6-8 based on the level of the mobs, sacrifice the VW and finish them off with RoF. This worked best on mobs that run since you can finish off the stragglers with your wand and Soul Drain to trigger Imp Soul Drain. However I was able to AoE grind well on UD in Darkshire, so that's not necessary. I recommend speccing Imp CoA for this.
---
It's still nowhere near as effective as a post lvl 40 mage grinding thanks to Ice Barrier and the ability to group mobs up while mounted combined with mage AoE scaling infinetly, but it's somewhat competitive pre-40 and was still faster than grinding 2-3 at a time like a lock normally would.

Maaaaaage is uber aoe class. Warlock is second, they can aoe a little bit too but it takes preparation for VW sacrifice and such. Prot pala never tried it

Don't see it. But nice try pretending.

He's not faulting the guy for rolling on it, just saying there's no way he'd pass, regardless of how many other drops he made have gotten that run.

Sounds like a bad product to me.  Is it too late to return it and get a new one?  I've never experienced any of those problems and I've had mine for a couple of years now.
---
Mage aoe’ing perfectly is so *beautiful* (said in latino voice)
---
same, using it right now. 
---
Yup, new server hype is real. I mean if any of us wanted to play Vanilla we could go play on private servers right now, but new 'official' server hype that people can stream will be huge. This subreddit/twitch/youtube will be flooded with content/drama/hype for a good few weeks, and lots of long lasting communities will be made.
---
roll paladin and never leave a contested zone unless my bubble hearth is up
---
How hard did they hit?
---
I am was a RPer for many years and I can tell you it will be great for you. I remember when I was on my human mage on my horse and I was RP walking just fully immersed by my surroundings and sound and then getting ambushed by some undead rogue. 
---
Also, one time I was doing a escort quest with these night elf hunters and we were just walking and then we just started RPing about the quest. 
---
I RP'd a lot on retail and the experience you get in vanilla is so unique and when you add a little bit of RP it just gets even better.
---
I work from home as a full time software developer and I have been using the same MX518 since as long as I can remember - probably '04 or '05.  Not exaggerating - I'd say I have 25,000 hours of use on it.
---
I'm using it right now.  God bless the MX518.
---
Can you name an example? 🤔
---
Mage is the only class that can aoe farm **efficiently**, yes. 
---
Is Retribution that viable for PvP or raiding, though?
---
I’d really like an anti-Rogue character that I could use in hardcore PvP and/or raiding.
---
You went through those 5 days of vods in 3 minutes? Impressive.
---
The fact is, I could give you the exact timestamp of it happening and you would just argue it's a good thing it happened because "muh thought control is acceptable"
---
Hmm. Can I use the in-game food and drink? If so, roll a Tauren or Nelf and live in the start zone.
---
If I have to level then . . . Urgh. Permadeath on a PvP server is bad. Probably a Nelf hunter - hunters ability to hang back and send in the pet, track humanoids, shadoweld . . . Although druid would be good too.
---
So something that players can abuse and inconveniences other players?
---
Yep, not at all like what I said (sarcasm).
---
Retribution doesn’t seem to fit that. Getting geared as a Shadow Priest seems extremely difficult since they’re very low in demand. Should I consider Warlock, then?
---
My route has me 10-11.5ish heading into westfall. I do a few quick quests there, then head to [Darkshore for 12-17](https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-1-60-alliance-leveling-guide/levels-12-17/) and then some followup in [Loch Modan into Redridge](https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-1-60-alliance-leveling-guide/levels-17-21/)
---
Necessitates getting to 10 quick enough to start ahead of the pack. Darkshore has 2-3x the quest xp as westfall / loch modan. Between levels 7 and 17, 76,305xp from quests in Darkshore vs 26,525xp from quests in Westfall. Rushing through here puts you even more ahead of the pack.
---
Darkshore is dense.
---
For that "awesome vanilla feeling" you'd rather want to go for an old low res 4:3 monitor, lol
---
Meh, this is cool and all...but when are we going to get new/updated versions of the Zboard keyboard with interchangeable face plates for Classic?
---
I believe this is very true. If Classic never launches, the built up for it will legitimize private servers on a level this industry has never witnessed prior.
---
Blizzard will lose ALL control over the IP that built the company. 
---
Due to the recent drama, Classic is the only product they have where the audience is optimistic and not annoyed, saddened, fearful or flat out pissed off right now.
---
Playing the game.

Shadowmeld while eating/drinking, keep your back to a wall, afk inside towns or up high behind hills, kill them before they can kill you, quest in other areas temporarily if you’re outnumbered.

He literally said he would be pissed if someone else rolled on a piece of gear he needed if it was his last upgrade while the other player still had many upgrades.
---
I got it sometime last December. Wait, so if you grab your mouse and slide it left and right, doesn't your scroll wheel wiggle and make a loud sound? I think it's normal since the wheel has a left and right button ability too.
---
Also when I placed the order for the mouse, I used a limited discount. I doubt they would send me a new one.
---
I find it very odd he found no dps stats T1 for feral. I've seen it and done it ... but not front progression wave, so they very well may not be there.
---
I did over 400 dps most of the time as Feral in Pre-Bis.

When armor capped most avg bg rogues white hits were in the 30-45 range if I recall correctly.  And I was returning I think 18-24 dmg per hit from thorns plus ret aura which I believe was higher dmg from my ret pally partner. With my active dmg plus this passive dmg I would do just a bit less dmg than they did, but have 2-3x their health and win the war of attrition.  Then add in the aoe ap debuff to pull rogues from stealth,  and fairie fire (feral) to kill vanish shenanigans.  I enjoyed going against rogues all things considered.  Then again my other main was a mage which gave me a great appreciation for outlasting their burst and turning the tables on the sneaky bastards.

Agreed. Streaming is not vanilla.  Getting carried to 60 and people throwing gold and gear at them.   Those accounts should be banned.

Well thought out, but the only flaw is that you’d have to look at your ugly, hairy, dwarf ass

&gt; The fact is, I could give you the exact timestamp of it happening
---
Everyone will be here waiting for you to prove you're not lying.
---
Haha, yeah the edgelord shit is real. It’s like some trolly anti-social justice edgyforthesakeofedgy mentality. It’s boring and overdone. 
---
The pain is real when your ignore list gets full haha
---
&gt;Due to the recent drama, Classic is the only product they have where the audience is optimistic and not annoyed, saddened, fearful or flat out pissed off right now.
---
Am pretty sure that the majority of Classic fans have been extremely fearful of the idea of just how much Blizzard could fuck this up years before the announcement even came.
---
I'm very excited all the same, but most people are here because they want to go back to when the game was good, instead of the shitfest it became. A shitfest which many of us spent years dredging through as it became shittier and shittier and more or less killed off any faith in Blizzard over time.
---
I'm hopeful for Classic, I truly am. I think there are many reasons for Blizzard to stick to their guns and remain truthful, reasons which even Blizzard should acknowledge (and as far as one is to believe BlizzCon/interviews, they have). But even so, it's very difficult to truly trust a company that methodically destroyed the game I loved.
---
I think the idea is that they are relevant the most. Decent to good in all raids, great at world PvP and have their niche in battlegrounds, and they have nice tools to handle a lot of situations.
---
Classic is good for many of the same reasons that bfa is bad. It isn’t true in all cases, but I don’t see any issue with poking fun at the dichotomy while we wait for more news.
---
As my rogue friend would say in a duel after he popped vanish, "See you in five minutes bitch"
---
Preaching to the choir.
---
Reck bomb pally is a meme pvp spec, it counter rouge perfectly and you can make some funny one shot montage with it but that's all really. Holy paladin should still be able to deal with rogue tho or at least survive until someone else help you.
---
As for countering rogue but still being viable, i would say frost mage (blink ice block to remove cc, and then kite), hunter (anti stealth flare, traps, tracking, pet), soul link lock (can just tank the damage while the rogue slowly die to the dots) and druid (can't be ganked by surprise if you are stealthed, can also track humanoid, can tank damage in bear and can run away and kite).
---
You get bonus points if you choose orc for the stun resist.
---
If you are rich, you could also just play any class you want and use free action potion everytime you encounter a rogue.
---
fuck off boogie
---
Anyone telling you 8 hours is a good time 1-20 with a Paladin is a fucking clown. Not even hunters can do it that fast. 12 hours is a great time to 20 and is far more reasonable.
---
Nah, you are, and I could give you the exact timestamp on stream and you'd just throw out some other ridiculous statement about how it doesn't matter or how it doesn't prove anything.
---
Another thing with the itemization is the weapons. R14 MH is far superior to everything early for rogues and the first  weapon that even gets close for rogues is AQR. But R14 is still bis untill KT without even having a debate about it. While furys can get Ironfoe early and get compareable weapons to r14 in BWL. 
---
Retail raiding is absolutely harder than classic. Rotations are more complex (with more room for error) and boss mechanics are harder to deal with (leading to more avoidable damage).
---
Gearing in classic was more complicated and more rewarding though — the feeling of earning an epic in Classic has no equivalence in retail. 
---
So you're lying. Gotcha! Nice try, though!
---
The other guy I challenged also chickened out. I'll be referring to these posts in the future to make my case :D
---
&gt;Now I am about 80% sure that Classic will have (from start or at some point) microtransactions,
---
Classic did have microtransactions. Server transfers and name changes.
---
They didn't add any microtransactions to Starcraft: Remastered, if that means much.
---
Worst case scenario, I am doubtful they'll add level boosts as microtransactions. The whole point of the level boost was to get new people to get to end-game content at the end of Wrath, onwards. 
---
I only understand train station.
---
&gt; So you're lying. Gotcha! Nice try, though!
---
Yea, just pretend I'm lying, that's fine.
---
&gt; I'll be referring to these posts in the future to make my case :D
---
Sure, but remember to refer to all the times I've asked you questions you refused to answer, starting with the simple question of what the benefit is of the system.
---
The decked out warriors are the ones I remember the most. You spend a few minutes dodging and CC’ing for them to find a window and 2 shot you.
---
From the standpoint of a spelling and grammar Nazi, I simply cannot approve of this post. 
---
That's not a bad idea, having people kite mobs to you.  I don't really think running dungeons is crazy dangerous though, especially RFD, especially as a hunter.  Plenty of places in that dungeon to evade bug things.  If life is on the line, remember, you can go to a lot of trouble to stay alive... always stay stocked on swiftness, invis, invuln, potions.  You'd also have nearly the best gear available if you took your time to farm.  Can a lvl 40 use flask of petrification?  Can you log out while using flask? lol.   Id say a 45ish BM hunter could darn near solo most pulls in RFD with a bit of preparation, which is when you would be doing the vast majority of runs as mob experience drops off. 
---
I just can't get over people thinking  that running dungeons is more dangerous than going into contested territory.  If my life was on the line I'd never leave uncontested territory ever no matter what lol.
---
Warrior can with cleave + sweeping strikes.  It can be a bit risky, but if the mobs are like 2+ levels below you it can be done very efficiently. 
---
You're right. Beastial Wrath wasn't there at launch, and lacerate was the top survival talent. Hunter talent trees were really stupid at release, although spirit bond was way better.
---
final fantasy xiv's microtranscations are nothing short of insane. 
---
War.........
---
Wow....all the negative comments.  I doubt any of the naysayers will take the time to watch this video but I'll link it anyways:
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szkScab2iOQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szkScab2iOQ)
---
At about 59:00 into the video he talks about totem twisting.  This is a guy who did over 1000 different parses with weapon buffs to determine how each performs.  There's a ton of good info for ANY spec in the video but he goes on a few minutes to describe that totem twisting will buff the melee DPS group by an insane amount.  Unfortunately totem twisting is something that is only available to shaman considering that totem twisting takes about 550 mana per totem cycle and also requires the use of a lot of GCD's.  TLDR: Totem twisting, Nightfall efficacy, and the ease of early raids should 100% allow enchancement shaman.  A resto shaman, even with the appropriate 'enhance" talents will never be able to totem twist due to GCD lockouts, talent requirements, and mana pool limitations.
---
Or swap the pally for a shammy on Horde side.
---
I'd love to see the Azshara Battleground. It's the one piece of cut content I always wanted to play. Alterac Valley is awesome, but I can stand snow levels for only so long. It would also finally give Azshara some purpose. The entranced to the bg are already there, why not use them?
---
I had the same one, a great compagnion.
---
But Logitech today is not the same quality.
---
I can throw out some of my experiences, take them for what their worth.
---
Enh Shaman is likely easier to level if elemental spell power gear isn't in the game at launch (depends on if they are in the 1st or 2nd planned patch ... I believe the patch progression has yet to be 100% confirmed by Blizzard yet). I suggest sticking with 2h, the dps difference is significant. Don't use a super slow axe due to the change to miss and not even because of WF, because when you get WF ... still use Rockbiter for grinding. WF is a dps loss due to change of miss and glance. You WILL discover this yourself so just use Rockbiter and save WF for later crazy burst fun once you have +hit stat.
---
I don't want to go into the chances Enh has trying to get into a raid early on. It's prior to Nightfall being in game and if debuff slots are 8 (I know this is a no change argument for some, but 8 slots is also confirmed to have occurred because of tech limitations and actual game design).
---
Priest: I suggest a leveling build around wand and at least minimum shadow to get by. Healing is easy in any dungeon even without going full Resto.
---
Just two dudes...running the galaxy...
---
Just to give people some context, the biggest MMO at that time, Everquest, had things like losing experience when you died. WoW was indeed casual, back then, compared to what else was out there.
---
"relevant the most"? 
---
oem sure man whatever makes you fee good.
---
Remember it's not possible to get exalted by 40 with real classic rep values but you can get a solid chunk done.
---
Using the standard Gregorian calender? What year is this, Year XVIII of the Second Millenia?
---
I can't wait for playing SL lock against rogues.
---
Thing is with warlocks that you pretty much have to be SL to beat a geared rogue, and SL is shit for raiding. 
---
The best is probably a paladin because you can heal in raids and grab some off-pieces for PvP, especially 2-hand mace from BWL trash. You'll also have plate gear and there's no armour penetration in vanilla. You can break several stuns, you have heals, decent dps and high sustain. The only problem is finishing off the rogue as paladins have no gap closer and rogues are extraordinarily slippery. 
---
who do you want to convince? i find it highly amusing to put so much effort and thought into avoiding a high level gank here and there which tbh. realy doesnt happen that often, not even in STV. 
---
if you think thats reasonable and worthwhile to do instead of just playing on a pve server, by all means go for it.. more power to you.
---
ill still find it amusing though.
---
You have unlimited gold.....
---
Dude, we're playing the hypothetical that we have unlimited gold and can buy anything you want as a fresh 60 😦.
---
Didn't you read the OP?
---
Vanish raises your stealth level by an absurd amount for a few seconds, you're not catching a vanished rogue with Perception. So he has a few seconds to move out of Perception range.
---
Hi, /u/Jess_u_w_u
---
Definitely not worth it for vanilla in particular. Its not exactly a game where you will get to reap the benefits of high end modern hardware. 
---
I just got a 1080p 144hz monitor 22".
---
It's more than big enough and crispy clean. I couldn't imagine going for a higher resolution.
---
The 1.12 client capped out at 120hz I believe so I'll be able to utilize a better framerate in Classic.
---
It's flicker-free as well which idk if it makes a difference since I have a high tolerance for staring at screens for long periods of time.
---
If I am alone and outnumbered or out leveled and its a bad matchup. I give them the /golfclap emote and just let them kill me. Usually they are gone when I get back.
---
Same dude, I also have the same mousepad
---
I found Paladins decent to 20, meh to 40, and painfully slow until Ret can pick up Consecration. Then it kills decently but is mana intensive. I see others using different builds, which is great (I prefer a variety outside of the normal memes) but, despite their claims, they level more slowly than Ret.
---
You stack dps stats, you try keep a new, very slow weapon, and make your Ret one button, macro rotation, and watch your Youtube vids while leveling. 
---
If it wasn't that brutal portion of later game leveling where dps slows dramatically, I rather enjoyed playing Paladin (somewhat similar to why I like Shaman ... it becomes interesting when grouped. Shaman just happens to be far more interesting to me offensively too).
---
I was smart. I didn’t play on shitty PvP servers. 
---
PvE for the win. 
---
While this is true, they took that concept and ran with it so hard that they have gone way overboard.
---
You can only make things so convenient before it feels like the game is playing itself.
---
be nice if somehow/ some reason, classic goes really well and ends up adding (somehow) TBC and maybe just maybe WOTLK (but stop there, go no further, ever) idk, wait and see, doubt itttttt
---
It's also a really good quality mousepad, lasted me 10 years now, the flaking in the corner only happened after someone borrowed it and started picking at the edges.
---
unless of course there is sharding..
---
Volley also has a 1 minute cooldown, so it's not really a thing.
---
Volley has a several minute cooldown.
---
Spell damage also increases arcane shot damage. 
---
Also is getting 1100sp going to be achievable? 
---
What tier of gear do you need to make that happen?
---
Even with sharding. Sharding just means dozens of players in Northshire Abbey instead of hundreds.
---
Did you play live vanilla? Lmao. 
---
DWing spellpowe weapons means double wizard oil and double enchants.
---
Complete oversight on volley CD. I'm glad you poked holes into my ridiculous idea lol
---
ok now bring back the G9 and i will never touch another brand of mouse ever again.
---
^this
---
Go engineering, carry sleep dust, limited invunerability potions, dont be scared to spend consums 2 win. 
---
When I scaled down to that in a vanilla server, it legitimetly made me more immersed. For real, try it.
---
Ultrawide, hands down. There's just [so much room for activities](https://i.imgur.com/t6AD9yr.jpg)
---
Let me amend that, pvp server live vanilla*. Depending on the location this would actually pull griefers and campers away from questing areas if properly placed. Higher prices for basic supplies but up supply drops on mobs so people questing get the items for free here and there or as quest reward supplies for turn ins. So simple to make it so it isn’t people taking advantage. Having pre spawned locations for black lotus that Chinese farmers camp and sell at high gouged prices is something that should be kept though? All I’m sayin’. Just a discussion
---
jump around orgrimmar bank roof for literally the rest of my life, which is what i will be doing upon classic launch anyway
---
I'm Batman.
---
Blacksmithing is not bad if you can get your hands on valuable recipes early (Lionheart, Titanic Leggins). But otherwise it isn't a particularly great moneymaker imo.
---
"A" and "D" the best "rotational" keybinds in the game ;)
---
The worst part of that happening wouldn't be the fact that it happened... it would be the fact that people would then gloat *"see, we* ***told*** *you it was just nostalgia and you didn't really want it!"*
---
Ran the North American premade on nostalrius when I ranked. Rogues are the last class I would fill up my premade with. Maybe to guard the WSG flag but still...once sprint is up on CD they dont have a single gap closer.
---
ythisens was their last bastion of goodwill from the classic WoW community, and they had *zero problems whatsoever* firing him **out of the blue** (bold for good pun).
---
they dont give a shit about goodwill; goodwill doesnt show up next quarter.
---
If you know they’re around, hunter, assuming properly PvP specd with FaP and engi 
---
This is definitely legit.  Especially in FPS games.  Lower res can help a lot (4:3 in particular) as it allows you to take in everything at once instead of having to look around the display.
---
Beastial wrath is a BM spec tho?
---
If you go alliance prepare to have the majority of your opponents in pvp be undead with will of the forsaken. 
---
Go alliance for PVE
---
Go horde for pvp
---
I use 1440 my roommate has 1080.  Kind of amazing how much more room I have for addons and such.  I imagine ultrawide or 4K would be that much better again.
---
I’m a big fan of hunter tier 0, very rexxar, much awesome. 
---
I guess there's a chance a guild might let you in as a Nightfall carrier. But as others have pointed out, it's unlikely you'll get gear priority, and you'll just be objectively worse than other melee dps, even feral druids.
---
To followup Norjac's post.  Mining takes more time/effort to level than other gathering professions.  As such if you are planning on a profession that needs mining mats or you plan to take mining at some point, take it from the beginning.  Going back later to mine is a pain in the ass...
---
have two LG 2560x1080p monitors, love them for wow. so much more room for addons and have a large FOV. 
---
resolution is probably more important than refresh rate for MMOs so if I were you I'd go ultrawide in the highest resolution you can afford and is a good match with your GPU
---
Holy pala; for survivability, no competition. Takes forever to kill anything, but you cannot die. I once took on 5 mobs by myself and most of them were 1 or 2 levels higher than me.
---
Won the fight. Was a long fight, used all my cooldowns. But i showed that defias courier bitch who’s boss.
---
Rogues have a ton of bad matchups, actually.
---
Ele sham
---
Paladin
---
Warrior
---
Hunter
---
Feral Druid
---
Frost Mage
---
Ironically, their biggest strength is just avoiding bad matchups entirely which makes them appear a lot stronger than they actually are. But in forced encounters like BG's where they have to constantly fight against specs that perform very well against them, they suffer.  Also, because they are relatively squishy single target melee, they bigger the fight gets, the worse and worse they perform, while some classes like warlocks, mages, hunters and ele shams get better and better the bigger the fight is.
---
The result is god tier at ganking in world pvp, pretty damn average at BG's.  But that doesn't mean they don't have their roles. Stealth is incredibly powerful at defending nodes/base or returning flags in WSG, or stealth cap towers in AV.
---
The only class I can think of that goes from super aggressive, center of a fight with less than 5 players, to ghosting around the outside of  a fight looking for low hanging fruit in larger scale fights. You really do need to have a completely different play style depending.
---
what about other games? Ive seen opinions that only some titles support UWHD
---
Even then, can't prep and AR in Vanilla, only in TBC could you do a hemo+prep/AR huild (HARP).  Which lacked burst damage, but hemo in combination of 30 seconds of AR was stupid strong conditionally.  You could literally stun lock a target forever.
---
It varies some by gear tier and individual skill but the general WSG meta is something like
---
1x druid
---
1x rogue
---
1x lock
---
1x hunter
---
1x warrior
---
1x Shaman/Pally
---
2x priest
---
2x mage
---
Unlikely from my experience.  Min/Max guilds use enhance shamans for Nightfall. If anything I'd say joining a decent guild whose willing to accept you in the first place and then fairly give you raid gear is a tough sell. 
---
My advice is to be the first guy with a nightfall on your shaman and declare it with your GM the benefits of having one. 
---
Less survivability, but twice the damage output and more one shot kills.
---
Hey thanks for the input. I didn't actually get to play shaman until Wrath because i was playing Hunter up until then. So it's good to have people give me actual advice versus just reading the random advice given to some people. 
---
Another problem i know i will have is that back in the day when i played i had a lot of friends playing so i could have played anything and they would have accepted me because i learn my class to the best of my ability. I will be going into this solo and trying to form friendships along the way. So i just hope i find people who like to play the way i do. Which is pushing content early. 
---
Just a little side story from wrath.
---
My Brother, Friend and I leveled paladins and did everything 3 man style and several times up to 5 levels above us (dungeons) That was the most fun that i have ever had in the game. 
---
So i would like to just find friends and push content for fun. 
---
Any way im gonna play a shaman and alt a priest! hahah
---
I never really pvp'd in vanilla and I'm interested in a Shaman for Classic, what do Ele shamans have against rogues if you don't mind me asking? Would they not just get stunlocked &gt; death like most others?
---
No but they will want tons of people to run them thru dung/raids and funnel them gear.
---
Resto Shaman don't totem twist.  Totem twisting is the sole responsibility and realm of Enhancement shaman.  This is not live.  GCD for totems along with limited mana (even for a resto, who is not there to restore his own mana, he's there to restore mana for the entire group) made it nearly impossible for Resto shaman to effectively totem twist without severely gimping their talent tree or their healing output.
---
Not only does this [2 month old thread corroborate](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/a3bwww/totem_twisting/) what I'm saying but [a recent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szkScab2iOQ&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3551) with Defcamp who crunches numbers on vanilla shaman agrees as well.
---
TLDR: Totem Twisting, especially in vanilla, is for enhancement shaman.  In TBC it was easier to totem twist due to mana constraints starting to be lifted and classes given different ways to recoup mana, but even then it was still more for the enhancement shaman (who were given more tools to be very decent melee dps as well).
---
Grind while you level. Kill stuff on the way to and back from your quests. Some mobs are much easier and less painful to kill than others, so don't be afraid to grind for a little bit, and always carry food or water.  Know when to hearth to save travel time.
---
shield for high armor which mitigates a pretty hefty chunk of rogue damage.
---
Decent sized health pools compared to other cloth casters
---
The ability to still heal, and most have natures swiftness for free instant full heal
---
poison cleanse totem to be essentially immune to poison
---
aoe slow and frost shock snares makes it easy to escape melee range
---
extremely high burst damage, with decent survivability
---
And commonly, ele shamans are rare -- so the ones you do find are often paired with a buddy.  Not exactly a favorable matchup.  In large pvp fights, they are in the faar back healing or picking off tagets who get close to 50% health.
---
I never liked the concept of 'reserve loot' in random groups. Making decisions like that among friends, sure, but doing it to strangers is basically saying "Hey, I'm going to ninja this item if it drops, but it is okay because I'm telling you before hand that I'm going to ninja it."
---
BiS tier 5 should do it.
---
It's not. I've seen mages/warlocks in naxx gear get past 700 but there is absolutely no way a hunter can get that high lol
---
Do you want to suck as a hunter? Cause this is how you suck as a hunter...
---
Except for the twisted psychopaths. Weren't you paying attention to Laughing Coffin in Sword Art Online?
---
Exactly. I especially felt it while in caves and such. I felt REALLY immersed there
---
They'll fit right in
---
It’s not as bad as you think. I’m Canadian but I’ve been living in Australia for over a year now and it’s a 14 hour time difference.
---
Stay on the same server as your friends. Yes you will have to adjust, I now raid at 7am because that’s raidtime back home. I can’t make all the raids but I can still do some.
---
The lag is real, but it’s a little easier playing a caster. If you’re getting 200-400latency it’s still playable and after awhile it’s honestly not that bad. Melee is sometimes annoying because targets can walk behind you and you won’t swing, but casters are really good. You can also chain spells so lag doesn’t affect too much.
---
I’ve tried moving servers and although gameplay is better, without all your friends it’s just not the same as it’s gets boring. Play with your friends, you’ll be fine. Then when you move back you won’t have to start over too!
---
I would absolutely never go into dungeons. All it takes is one guy to pull too much and cause a wipe and you're dead. Even if you can escape the situation, the occurrence is too high. Just imagine being a hunter and having to FD but you're too close to a pack so you have to stay put until your party walks back. But...what if they don't? What if the group falls apart and you're stuck there?
---
Pay for IRL transfer to PvE server = win
---
You didn't take into account PvP items, did you?
---
&gt; but man, the mechanics of classes and raids and min/maxing can only be discussed so much.
---
Thats what annoys me about seeing all of these Classic WoW guides on Youtube. The game isn't even out yet ffs
---
I like when clueless people like you get upvotes for being edgy. Some of these streamers, especially the more famous ones, bring whole armies of fanboys with them. And when you are on a closed realm and not multi-realm shared server, you are in for a disaster.
---
I've literally seen hundreds of people following a single streamer around, do i need to tell you what this does on a classic style realm? What happens when the hype dies and these streamers simply quit, because they are just here for few hours of twitch "fame"? Do you think these fanboys will keep playing?
---
Streamers not only bread toxicity, but can very well affect the balance of a realm once they stop playing.
---
The first 6 months of classic will be interesting thing to witness.
---
Yeah im horrible when it comes to grammar, please have mercy on me lol.
---
The PvP items will be added in the second stage afaik, after that they are added where they are BiS. The list is strictly PvE related.
---
If you can find some good set of mobs your level or a little above, and pretty much fast kill non stop with a group, you can actually get some solid xp and gold. One example is the hippogryphs in Feralas. We did it with a warlock, Spriest, and warrior. If one of us had to drink the other 2 kept pulling non stop, at least 2 at a time. I was really surprised how much xp we got from grinding those.
---
Moving my mouse left/right quickly doesn't create any sound other than the friction against my desk.
---
Who decided this guy gets to decide what we post about in the forums?
---
Merging servers has massive issue with community disruption and character naming. Also what happens if there is a player influx again, say in a retail content drought? The server blows up because of the increase in players, if you don't want sharding then you don't want server merges. It needs to be a natural process of player movement over time via paid character transfer.  
---
Naturally you'll get dead servers, retail has dead servers - so what? The players that continue to play the game will slowly filter on to the more popular realms. I'm more than happy to pay £18 to transfer onto a more popular realm 6 months after launch. In vanilla me and a few friends PAID to transfer off a high pop realm onto a medium pop to escape the server queue times, it was quite common back then. There seems to be this misconception that all vanilla transfers where free. I'm sure Blizzard made good money from server transfers in vanilla so I see no reason why classic should be any different.
---
Ill never forget Teldrassil and the music as a night elf. I was stunned when I left that place and saw that is was a small portion of an immense world. I also really liked Elwyn Forest, Westfall, and Duskwood. But I've turned to the dark side now and the Undead starting area Tristfal glades and Silverpine Forest has grown on me.
---
I'm looking for a guild on a US realm but raid times during the day. Ending no later than 16:00 pst/19:00est. If anyone has heard of a guild like this please let me know or pm me!
---
I am unconcerned about realm type etc. 
---
Thanks! 
---
I have an Dell s2716dg which is a 1440p 144hz G-Sync Monitor. If you buying one just for Classic i would say no. But yes if you plan on doing everything else with it, other games in the future then yes as well as Classic. Just as long as you have the GPU horsepower and CPU to running at 1440p. Ive not played WOW since wrath of the lich king and back then i was on my other 1080p 120hz monitor at the time. I changed to my 1440p monitor a few years ago. I had a quick go in retail wow, i was given 1 free day pass on my lvl80 warlock last month. Ive since changed my PC system since wrath of the lich king. 
---
Ive got a 4770k with 1080ti and 16 gig ram. at 1440p 144hz G-Sync. At UTLRA specs running around in stormwind which was busy at the time i was getting around 50 to 80 fps at 1440p ULTRA on a very busy screen in the open wildnress that was up to 100 to 144hz Maxxed out. 
---
The graphics where great and i had more screen space for wow than my 1080p [monitor.](https://monitor.Games) Games do look better at higher rez. 
---
It’s a passion project not a major release. Therefore, it is substantially more likely that no wow token or shop will exist. Any speculation in the alternative is probably purely for a pet shop, but even then unlikely. 
---
Plot twist: you just keep banning gold sellers. 
---
Some PvP items are BiS in for PvE iirc, it might depend on the release timing though :), thanks for your answer.
---
If I may add, I see you listed +5 damage on MH as being superior to +15 Agility for a Dagger Rogue. The difference is very small in both ways anyway, but some spreadsheets usually show the +15 Agility as becoming superior around BWL, especially when using World Buffs, due to its (far) better scaling - of course it ceases to be true if you are crit capped.
---
So now what we also have to consider is the character aka you needs sufficient rest and food and beverages.
---
I would believe Paladin is the best bet as when your at your weakest you can always shield yourself and escape with a hearthstone.
---
I would suggest most people would struggle to survive due to the fact if its VR and your brain is still exhausting maybe you feel the physical exhaustion as well and if thats of yourself rather than the character you might find yourself unable to pull the hours needed.
---
I would suggest avoiding an elite and dungeons etc and stick in a party.
---
I also strongly doubt with PvP enabled that it would occur, the reason for this is if people don't see a benefit in XP then why kill someone as it might come back to bite you once your out of the game.
---
I strongly doubt the vast majority of people posting if it was real life and you killing a character killed a player that they would do it. Very few people are programmed that way mentally and even many people in the military aren't, guess why they have training.
---
Maybe because they continued to build and expand the Warcraft universe as the game progressed? And lack of time/resources probably played a part as well.
---
It's nothing like that at all...  You need a single item from a dungeon that drops 50+ things you reserve said item because its the only reason you go...  Who wants to do ubrs 100+ times for felstriker then loose roll to someone who got it to drop on first run.

Ive noticed this trend from very young people today, who surrender their will and any agency, upon things being pushed on them. 
---
If someone complains about microtransations, lootboxes or DLC, they are met with a sarcastic quip sounding like this: *"Wow! Microstranctions, lootboxes and DLC can be found in many games today, its just how things are now, news at 11!"*.
---
It is this pathetic surrender at display, meant to sound sarcastic and even witty, where you just accept whatever is being pushed on you, without exerting any integrity or agency on your own. Your post reeks of it.
---
Nobody here has to engage or even acknowledge any streamer if they do not want to. Just because you and your friends send a few bits to a streamer to say your name does not mean that is something the rest of us think are good use of ones money
---
Nobody here is campaigning to ban Twitch or Youtube, or to stop anyone else from watching or donating. Do as you please. Yet here you are pushing this "streamer acceptance" on others, without realizing what a tool you are. And i do not mean tool as a insult, i mean as in a literal tool, who is freely advertising other peoples work, on command. "*Please like and subscribe, follow me on Twitter and make sure to spread the word*". Congratulations, you are doing just that.

My favorite mouse ever was the Logitech G500. Mine started double clicking a few years ago though : (

Site is terrible, none of the calculators work.

I am coming at this from a different angle than you. 
---
The key thing is that Corporations can be competetive by doing other stuff than satifying thier customers. They get thier advantages from Legal departments, being aware of regulation and how to work around it. Copyright claims. Accounting departments being aware of tax law and how to work around it. Just of the top of my head btw.
---
If the government would interfere less there would be less opportunity to be competitive outside of satisfying your costumers. Highly regulated markets breeds mega corporations. 
---
The last century had all kind of political ideas that did'nt respect private property rights aka capitalism. The world is still healing from the outcome of them.

For pvp druid dont get mutch better then this:

---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQwH0atQZ0Q&amp;t
---
Are you serious? you be a reasonable person and don't take their gear which is crucuial for them, cos they do more dps and its a better upgrade for the raid dps. its not like ppl can't negotiate stuff. 
---
and they have LESS interference then if instead of enh shamana as a melee you had another rogue or fwar. yonk? how hard is it to grasp? 
---
its like you guys can't read and think, its hilarious really. 
---
Please stop embarassing yourself 
---
Interesting. Mine has [this EXACT issue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpQ5_QDUMhE) and after looking at a few more clips and reading comments, it seems like this is a very common issue. I fear that even if I request an RMA and they send me a new one, it would end up being faulty again. I might try though. Recently I had to return a faulty office chair too...
---
Nowadays the quality of everything is just so low, it makes me mad. And this is coming from an engineer....
---
Goodwill never shows up, but a sufficient lack of it will catch up in the end.
---
This prebis prot warrior list is terrible. A warrior wearing this gear would have less than 4k hp unbuffed, also the word TPS should be removed
---
To put things in perspective on one of the last pserver L I ended up reaching lvl 20 in around 15 hours and I was top 25 on the server at that point(13k population , not very blizzlike).
---
I just lvled a mage to 20 in the last 2 days and ended up at 13 hours without any rested exp, mining at 60 and engi at 100. Over an hour spent in cities.
---
Anything under 12 hours is super fast
---
If a shaman gets opened on before they put their totems down could they still get one shot? I'm trying to decide between a rogue and shaman as my main for classic and the world of roguecraft meme. Well I don't know how much of it is a meme.
---
I love my Naga and have repaired it several times over the years. I honestly can’t go without the MB3+4 on the top left... I just use it for so many things. So sad They don’t make that type of mouse anymore :(
---
Same, I'm perfectly happy with 1080p and 144hz is just lovely. When G-sync supported monitors drop in price I'll probably get one, but am not in any way in a hurry.
---
Am i missing enhancement or are they just like so bad that we don't even want to see their BiS lol. 
---
Great spreadsheet btw. 
---
Make epica purple blues rare etc. And maybe link to the classic wowhead website. Soooo cooooowl. 
---
at which point the CEO steps down, with a massive severance package, and moves to another company to destroy
---
The best anti rogue class is by far a frost mage, especially now that spell batching most likely won’t be a thing 
---
My understanding is that the volley coefficient is divided by the number of ticks making it 5.6% spell power per tic [https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=14295/volley](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=14295/volley) if you look at mages blizzard its pretty close to the same. The 1 minute CD is also a major issue.
---
I am really interested in using spell power with the Hunter class and doing the math have found potential in using DW spell power weapons with arcane shot to get similar dps to the accepted aimed shot rotation. 
---
Using dw spell power weapons - wizard oil - 2 spell enchants - and spell power flask(there is no agility flask to compete for flask spot in vanilla) I find around bwl - aq 40 with T2.5 you can get around 450 spell power at the cost of your melee weapon slots that usually give \~100 ap and 2-3 crit at around the same power level.
---
I made this spreadsheet to compare  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FrVkU\_QfojyWfyVnCuUCOR6mHSMTg\_hy7Ei2F2UDA\_o/edit?usp=drivesdk](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FrVkU_QfojyWfyVnCuUCOR6mHSMTg_hy7Ei2F2UDA_o/edit?usp=drivesdk) 
---
I found full spell power gearing to be a total non starter for hunter
---
Yep.  
---
They do have the only battle res.
---
Battle Rez and innervate are crucial to progression and will get 2-4 druids into a raid. 
---
If the shaman isn't in greens no.
---
With 4-5k armor and 4-5k hp, a rogue won't be able to burn down a shaman that easily.
---
Thinking of rolling a warrior tank. But it looks like that is a pretty popular choice. Is it worth or do you think there will be too many prot warriors?
---
In b4 shaman reincarnates kappa ("battle res")
---
I mean yeah. But is it really that good? Couldn’t you just soul stone your main tank?
---
This sound only happens if I leave the scroll wheel unlocked. 
---
If you click the button directly behind the scroll wheel you'll lock the scroll wheel and it should only spin once click at a time.  Does this fix your issue?
---
It simply wasn't in the game.
---
Serious guilds bring like 1 Druid to raids for the buff.
---
I don’t remember playing the night elf so can’t recall the music. Again with undead, I didn’t pass level 7/8. Tauren warrior was my dark side!
---
It's the ultimate hybrid tax, because they are technically capable of all 4 roles they cannot excel at any...
---
That said with a lot of effort feral isn't complete dogshit and honestly resto is one of the most efficient healers in the game, they're also very strong in open world pvp because if the insane mobility they are capable of.
---
I’d probably make a group with some other people,but not just any group,a 5 man group with One warrior for tanking,one Druid for its healing and its off tanking/dps,either a warlock and a mage for the locks soulstones,voidwalker and just overall good damage and the mage for its damage output and kiting capability’s,me personally I would be a rogue in this situation for damage and if shit goes sideways I can just stealth the fuck outta there,Plus we’d all pick professions like First aid for the obvious bandages and stuff like tailoring and blacksmithing for armor and weapons.
---
I'd like to see something with sub-BiS alternatives that are also okayish, especially for pre-raid. A lot of the tippy-top BiS items are very rare world drops or very expensive crafted items. Other times there's an item for a dungeon that just *will not drop* and you want to find out what's the best alternative.
---
For example, Mage pre-raid BiS cloak you list as Amplifying Cloak, but DM:W is tends to be unpopular. Meanwhile a competent mage can solo Heliotrope Cloak from the first boss in DM:N and it's not that much worse.
---
BiS lists are everwhere, but lists of "not quite BiS but way easier to get" no one provides.
---
This is why you don't get your info from /classicwow
---
If you have to ask this question though druid isn't for you it's a complex class. 
---
And if you think you can rank healers by their hps then you don't understand healing in vanilla.
---
This is the response I expected to see. 
---
Do you really need optimal class roles to clear everything?
---
No u dont Vanilla raids are really easy u can go with most raid setups. But if u want a serious speed clearing kind of guild u wont get inv to often
---
Vanilla is designed to have hybrid classes. Druids are not useless, neither are Shaman and Paladins. If you want to main tank, you pick Warrior. If you want to main heal you pick Priest. If you want to main DPS, you pick Mage or Rogue. Everything else brings valuable utility and flexibility to the group.
---
Thanks for the reply!
---
8 months until BG's are released? As someone who mainly pvps, that is way too long. I can see maybe 4 - 6 months tops. 
---
Do you guys not have phones to watch twitch streamers?
---
Mail armor I honestly thinks looks the best.
---
But then there is Warrior T1 shoulders...
---
Horde PvP Mail armor looks amazing. That and the Defiler's pvp reward set, too.
---
Far worse than reddit. You can't view anything for long without registering, there are blocks to copying images, etc. It really is a marvel how they keep going.
---
some of us have an adrenaline addiction :p 
---
Looking forward to your arguments for why Activision is good.
---
Yeah I still can't figure out why with the druid / shaman nearly identical nature based resto spells (even their spec names are the same, and both have natures swiftness!)  that chain lightning would look like a holy spell rather than a green healing chain lightning, similar to how wrath is green but lightning bolt is blue.
---
No. In fact I exclusively keep it in lock(step) mode and it wiggles the same amount. I believe the base of the mechanism is either loose from the factory or broken.
---
Thanks to you, I got convinced to request an RMA (their support line works at 12 AM, way to go!). I will return the mouse tomorrow and wait for a replacement. They said if the new mouse is also defective I will have to send that one back too for repair....
---
Honestly Logitech has had a huge decrease in quality for quite some time now, but I really liked how this mouse looked and all the buttons so I decided  to try it out.
---
I'll let you know how it goes with the new one :)!
---
I had a MX518 for YEARRRRRRRS. Took a long hiatus from gaming due to having a girlfriend(that bitch), but as soon as I was single and built a new PC i whipped out the trusty 518. Apparently 6 years in a drawer didnt do it well though because it died after only a month or so.
---
&gt; soul stone your main tank
---
yeah we did this on patchwerk on the time, worked great
---
There's been a huge amount of talk about druids here over the past few months, I think all this has been covered pretty well.  
---
   
---
For premade PvP you need one for FC, they're a suboptimal choice outside of that for any role in WSG. You can make use of a one to defend a base in AB with but they're weak when it comes to any actual fighting.  
---
Druids CC is basically roots. Hibernate can sometimes be handy vs druid/shaman/hunter but is super situational. Roots are a bad CC, any dispelling class can easily remove them, only useable outdoors and doesn't really bother any classes outside of melee. Any good rogue or warrior will be saving cd's/items for a situation when they need to get out of roots if they don't have a dispeller around. Bash one of the most useful things a druid can do for CC, but it's very limited as well due to being a melee attack required bear form. You can't really ever rely on it due to dodge/parry/resist/miss. Paladins HoJ sounds similar but is far more powerful.  
---
The default is complete resto for raiding, but even then they are weakest healer out of the 4 in vanilla. Feral will definitely be more popular than it was in 2005 due to understanding itemisation much better, but in general takes a lot of work for less results than other classes. If you're after a challenge and don't mind fighting some attitudes and never being top of the meters Feral might be a good fit.   
---
Fuck an hours worth of time. If you didn't make it back to your body to loot all of your gear in time it would disappear,  permanently. If your whole group dies at the bottom of a scary ass dungeon you'd better hope you have a brave rogue, skilled bard, or a monk to go drag your corpses back to the entrance or you could lose months worth of farming gear, consumables, bags, etc.
---
This right here. I usually run an SL build for pvp and almost never had problems with rogues.
---
A huge flood of noobs to gank in BRM will be fun too. Looking forward to all the 1v5 video montages
---
In premade WSG you will be the flag carrier, that's what druids excel at. No other class can carry flags the way druids can. And in AB you'll stationed at stables/farm defending. You basically just sit in stealth with track humanoids and wait for someone to come try capping it, once someone shows up you call for help and stall them until others get there. As far as nelf vs tauren, the difference isn't big you should really just pick the faction you like the most. Tauren have slightly better racials but nelfs get to play with paladins which benefits druids much more than shamans.
---
Thanks for your enlightening comment that is well designed to create a discussion and isn't at all a complete waste of time to read or reply to.
---
I'm glad someone else has looked into this so I don't feel that crazy lol. If someone can jump off my original idea and run with it. My volley info was taken from a pserver so the coeffecient on it was just wrong
---
Retail WoW is fast paced, tells you everything, and pretty linear. Classic is very slow, doesn’t give you a lot of information, and is very non-linear.
---
Step 1: Don't
---
Step 2: Focus on PvP if you want to be a successful enhancement shaman in Vanilla
---
Step 3: Realize the best thing you can do within a raid environment is heal, and just heal until you get your enhancement gear. At that point go back to Step 2.
---
I think this is a fair assessment. They don't care so long as they have a sub, so I think there will be a crossover function that preserves classic wow. Maybe along the lines of transmog for retail. Items/Armor/Weapons earned in classic wow will be unlocked as a transmog option for retail. I'm not sure of how many items are actually completely lost due to the implementation of BMAH. For real vanilla achievements, they will still be noted. If you earned them the second time around, they will be noted as such as well. I think this may be a collector's dream, a chance at getting those mounts/transmogs for their retail toon.
---
You are being fooled
---
Yes they are not amazing at PvE, however they excel at PvP (best flag carrier and hard to lock down healer) and are pretty fun to play in the open world with a ton of tools
---
Gank all the retail noobs
---
Frost mage?
---
&gt;Not anything to do with highest dps. just a bunch of guys questing,talking, hanging out,playing the game and doing things the way we want to
---
Don't get me wrong, but what is stopping you from doing that on retail? 
---
Vanilla dungeons are piss easy compared to what retail has to offer
---
Do you know if the rep starts at friendly or nuetral?
---
arguably not! if everyone was in on it, it would basically be like watching the purge / anarchist settlement with loose agreements and shit.
---
In OP's scenario you are a lone player navigating a world that is actively working to kill you irl and HAS NO IDEA. sure you can hunter safe pull every mob and literally just grind to 60. but what about other players? The dick who sees a lowbie or just general red its dead wPVP. that's what makes it so interesting. 
---
see me personally, unless i plan to be grinding in an area for a while or have a lot of quests will often attack people I think I can kill in wPVP just for fun. If they die cool, if I die, cool its just a game. But for the one person in this, it's LITERALLY their life on the line and I have no idea as I open on them. 
---
Do quests marked as "Alliance" give you reputation with every Alliance faction? Like these in Duskwood https://classicdb.ch/?zone=10
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wewnTYQfdR8&amp;t Best rogue vs Best warlock the skill cap dont get any higher then this.
---
Efficiency won't be any where near as big an issue as it was in vanilla. With today's knowledge and 1.12 talents/items average raid dps will probably be in the region of double what it was for your average MC/BWL/AQ raid.
---
Rogues are shit. All of you should roll something else and leave rogue to me. 
---
Yeah people really don't understand that threat is king in vanilla
---
Times I wiped in Vanilla because the tank died: 10%
---
Times I wiped in Vanilla because the tank lost aggro: 30%
---
Times I wiped in Vanilla because other shit: remaining 60%
---
I agree but you left out the part where horde are forced to play orc for the same reason
---
Sounds great to me, but my playtime is from around 20:00 CET and onwards :(
---
they are not considered a viable spec by most. Any argument you can make for an enhancement shaman to be in a raid besides the fun and class fantasy of it, or that they're not that bad etc ends with another class filling that roll or niche use better than the enh shaman.
---
example: 
---
nightfall uptime -&gt; hunters are more consistent
---
their damage is ok -&gt; any other melee is better though
---
hybrid class! can dps and heal! -&gt; spriest excels in both aspects
---
etc. there is a better class for every roll you hope an enh shaman to fill. hence, not viable. 
---
Jeez. We get it you want to play Rogue all by yourself, this kind of posts wont make the rogue population smaller
---
That would be the "gimmick". He uses a smithing hammer that no one makes, which means you have to level the skill yourself just to use it to get a CHANCE to dispel the soulink. This is not working in the world because the lock is going to prevent further resets tagging a mob. It's also obviously not working in BG's. 
---
Think about it this way, they are the third best healers in the game (it could be 4th but since you can only have three healer classes per side, oh well), and the second best tanks in the game (because there really only two real tanks). As for ranged or melee DPS, well, they can do that too!1
---
Nah, like all the content creators you watch I play warrior now. I just don't complain about rogues and make excuses for my failure like they will.
---
Or is he though? ;)
---
Oh i already know that but it would still be good info to have. I am not saying anything bad about the spreadsheet at all because it is amazing but I am 100% playing enhancement so it would be cool to see in there. Seeing as I am an altoholic i will also have an Ele or Resto Shaman as well eventually. 
---
It is really awesome for the priest i will be making right after my shammy. 
---
ATM Oceanic servers are having issues where we are getting US ping anyway lol. Might not be exclusive to Oceanic servers but just my experience, weird because it's been a daily thing and not a spike... Like constant 150-200 fps when it should be 20-50. 
---
Yeah I didn’t think so even dual wielding with enchants ect.
---
Druids are actually the most optimal tank in Vanilla WoW, but you're not too far off. Restoration Druids, Balance Druids, and Cat Druids aren't necessary in a raid at all. At minimum you'd want bring a single Bear Druid. Outside of crushing TPS, they're mostly there for Faerie Fire and GoW, ha. At least they are competitive when it comes to healing though...
---
They are really strong from about 33 when you can go Hemo to around 50ish with thistle teas. After that? They kind of suck. Other classes get higher armor. Warriors at higher levels figure out that they can spec in shout and reveal stealth. They are also really powerful as twinks due to dual wielding at certain levels and enchants. 
---
Most peoples views of rogues probably come in that 33 and up STV leveling cushion and twinking.  The "twinks" at 60 are warriors.
---
Of course org to felwood is faster but..
---
You can also queue UC and go wpl/epl
---
And for alliance well they can go BS/searinggorge/felwood etc.
---
Having 3(4 with entrance) start positions obviously gives more places to go than just 1.
---
What's your monitor?
---
then NF shaman is your best choice, it's basically a better version than NF ret paladin, so if that worked, NF shaman will too.
---
There will be enough whales playing classic who are older and have disposable income to completely outweigh the fact that they will lose some subs if they add MTX. it works for almost every modern game, and classic wow unfortunately won’t be different. 
---
Narrated by Sir David Scattenborough
---
I used to farm dungeons in TBC with volley and a gorilla for thunderstomp. Idk About vanilla
---
I see, that sounds pretty decent. How good is a shaman at catching/breaking a rogue's stealth/vanish? I imagine not nearly as good as a mage with their explosion or hunter flare.
---
Hybrid feral/resto druid is actually really strong in PvP. Heals, you def are solid, not the best, but solid. You also have on the fly bear tank if you need to. 
---
Point is, it's a true hybrid spec and it can get decently complex to play. It plays differently than most specs. It's fun times 
---
All you have to do is look at how much money runescape 3 (insane amount of MTX) makes compared to old school runescape which has 4-5X the amount of players on it with very little mtx. 
---
Iwata didn't comment this when Nintendo released people, it's all a game for these guys.
---
I don't get it, was everyone able to invite people to a raid in Vanilla? I thought only the raid leader/assistant RLs could do that.
---
I loved your work in Street Fighter!
---
Wow such an insightful and thoughtful comment.  I've totally changed my thought process! /s
---
I guess if someone has a differing opinion from you instead of providing any evidence to the contrary or perhaps just realizing you dont agree with the opinion... better just randomly insult them!! Amiright? You sure showed me!
---
Guess being rude and not having the ability to come up with any semblance of an intelligent retort comes naturally to people from old Societ Bloc countries eh? (Read: you)
---
Obviously rogue in 1.12 isn't nearly as good as on other patches but you are really underestimating the potential of rogue. But I guess you were just a shitter rogue who did terrible dps, couldn't find a proper guild to prebis in and lost in every 1v1 because of skill issues.
---
If you wanna tank, warrior is always your best (practically only serious) choice in vanilla. And if you want to be able to switch to DPS if there are too many tanks, warrior is, again, your best choice in vanilla. Yeah, warriors are imbalanced.
---
One resto with improved GotW and T1 set bonus is more than enough. Druids are so far behind other classes it's so sad.
---
dat tank bis .. roflmao
---
Nintendo gets overrated here at times, Iwata definitely seems like a good egg, but we're really forgetting Nintendo laid off hundreds in a not so distant future?
---
Play druid, almost impossible to die
---
Soulstoning the Mt is pointless, once he is dead he'll never be able to get aggro back, remember that most bosses are immune to taunt 
---
The problem with lists like these is that there are so many variables that aren’t being taken into account. On the Druid one, you have end of tier 2 with only two pieces of tier 2. yoi Also have mishundare in the helm slot. Basically, you’re suggesting that 2% crit and +6 heals is a worthwhile trade off for a Stormrage cover which gives the 3 piece bonus, 6 mana per 5, more stats, resistances, etc? Absolutely not.
---
I think we finally have to realize that there is no such thing as BIS. I’m not mad at OP for trying and I think the list is largely good and well formatted but it’s so frustrating looking at these lists sometimes.
---
You... have cat and bear listed?
---
\*Sheds druidic tear.\*
---
Go watch Stormx come and say that again. 
---
Mob resists two freezing traps in a row = ded
---
In what world does an enhancement shaman beat a rogue lol.
---
In a word Druids are bad. I don't actually mean that they are bad. It's just that to play a druid. Is to do 300% of the work everyone else is doing. For at best 95% of the result. This is fine in theory but two things make playing them ass to most people. Firstly being able to at best do 95% of what someone else can do. Means in a pve setting you will deal with crazy amounts of prejudiced. By people who should not care that much about 5% they aren't world firsting it.
---
The second reason they are ass is that in pvp that jack of all trades thing actually works kinda well. The problem is blizzard didn't make any gear for you so you just have to scrape shit together and, hope it works out.
---
Druids are very rewarding to play and should not be underestimated. That being said unless you are 1000% sure you wanna be a Druid. Make that class an alt. It's not for you. Druid mains know they are druid mains and their was never another option for them.
---
Isn't display size what determines how much you have to look around, not resolution?
---
4:3 is definitely the superior resolution for general computing though
---
[Nothing special](https://www.amazon.com/LG-29WK500-P-Monitor-Dual-UltraWide/dp/B07BBT5M8T), but I can't complain.
---
The amount of misinformation around druids is staggering.
---
Druid tanks definitely have a place in a serious guild. They have the highest possible TPS in the game, throughout all of its phases. In addition, they are incredibly easy to gear because only a few pieces of loot they need are even considered by other classes.
---
Feral druids are spectacular in decurse fights because of their huge mana pools (heart of the wild).

It all depends on what you want to do (and also what patches they're going to be using). Rogues were always great at 1v1 surprising people in world PVP. With equal gear you may not always win but you'll pretty much always have a chance. In battlegrounds rogues were fine but when we needed to sub someone into a game because it had gotten stupid we were never looking for a rogue.

Someone's salty
---
Mage and priest are great for leveling together. 
---
Is the rogue really a friend? Xd
---
Well, just be prepared that "being able to" doesn't mean "being able to well enough for raiding". The fact that you can do MC with 30 people isn't enough argument for someone and especially progressing later raids, everyone will want to push the limits and effectiveness to have the best possible chance to progress the bosses faster, so, taking a ret pally into the raid certainly isn't the optimal way.
---
And also some people will ridicule you or throw it into your face that you're the worst DPS spec and you will probably not be able to prove them wrong that much.
---
So if you want to push the limits and be part of top tier raiding, ret pally is probably not the choice.
---
Just letting you know what to be prepared for. Personally, I would not mind taking ret pally to a raid, because it's just the game, should be fun and it's not that bad, but others might see it very differently.
---
I guess relatively it was but I think the MMO genre needed a game that didn't necessarily "casualize" the market but rather not have game mechanics such as XP loss.
---
WoW was still a game where you still had to learn about the entire game either way. There wasn't a dumb mechanic like XP loss and you were still interacting with the game world which is detrimental to an MMO.
---
I don't think WoW has necessarily become more casual but they shifted a lot of the game to end game. Leveling is not a major portion of the game and socialization is basically nothing past your guild. Basically the game is on easy mode until you get to mythic, that's the problem.
---
Why does the rest of the game exist? Retail doesn't feel like a world, it feels like a raiding simulator. When you play Vanilla, every little thing you do counts. Leveling is an important part of the experience, no catch up mechanics that skip over raid tiers meaning you always have something to work for, 5 mans can give top level gear (Robes of the Exalted), etc.
---
Classic is just a better fleshed out experience overall and I'm 95% certain that it's going to be a success if Blizzard doesn't somehow screw this up. Like they literally can't fuck it up, the blueprint is there, they just have to make sure you aren't falling through the world.
---
Supposedly, stone claws' taunt can pull druids/rogues out of stealth, along with fire nova/ magma totem's aoe. Not so great.
---
Searing totem and the dot from flame shock can prevent rogues from vanishing effectively or dropping combat.
---
Depends on availability and gear but:
---
1x Druid Flag Runner
---
1x Hunter flag defence
---
2-3x Priests
---
1x Pally (I dunno horde)
---
That's your utility, you're going for damage after that. Warriors are amazing with dispell (much more important than healing) support, but mages absolutely blow things up with AP+POM+Pyro. 
---
Burst damage is king in WSG since it's really hard to stop your opponent getting the flag, so most games come down to the flag return. With respawn advantage that fight can't be drawn out, so you go in, blow people up and return the flag asap. We did it with the 3 warriors and 2 priests just chaining fears, the flag carrier would go down in seconds. The other massive burst was mages with AP+POM+Pyro, the danger of that being that if you're already against a priest heavy lineup, the priests just spec for silence and you can't kill anything.
---
We basically never took rogues or warlocks if playing seriously.
---
\&gt;"every viable spec"  
---
\&gt;includes Shadow Priest but leaves out the rest of the lesser specs  
---
What? LOL
---
Get to level 59 and stay there forever while opening a shop with cool shit everyone wants.
---
You missed the footage in the Perplexity videos where he 1) respecs for every duel between dagger, CB and Hemo specs as well as repspecs for BG's due to 5 gold respecs on his private server that will cost 100 in Classic. Almost all rogues are going to be hemo on Classic for pvp, because it is pretty good at everything and it's what my list is based on. People are not goign to spend 100 gold a week multiple times. They will do it once at most for raiding/pvp. 2) died to random spriests while taking none of their health and getting stunlocked from blackout procs. Of course players don't put in every loss and he is an exceptional player who knows how to use every trinket and consumable correctly, which is the "meta" for Vanilla now. Classes? Mean a whole lot less. You either are squishy or aren't, have burst or don't and can last on mana or not. Spriests are gods in 1 v 1. They SUCK at bg's when the players are all actually good in a premade vs premade.
---
Razor stuff always tends to break (2 nagas I’ve owned), there’s a Corsair mouse exactly the same and it’s lasted longer than my other two mice combined! No issues at all so far either.
---
Wouldn’t herbalism and mining be a tough combination? Since you can only track one type at a time? 
---
You're right, it could just be size.   
---
Personally I stopped caring about the resolution 4:3 thing after stopping playing CS (1.6) I played it 640x480 back in the day when the norm was 1024x768.   Made it easier to see heads and such.
---
Now adays I use a 1440p 144hz and gotta say its awesome haha.
---
Q times?
---
*Carlos!*
---
I main rogue lol, I just think it's funny
---
You didn't get in? Ah man, that sucks we where about to see if you wanted to raid Hogger.
---
I'd suggest no higher than a 1440p monitor, or some type of ultrawide monitor for any type of MMO. FPS is never going to be incredible with a bunch of player models on screen, so combining that with a 4k panel (or something with similar density) is kind of a waste since you'll rarely push enough frames for an enjoyable experience.
---
I personally like 21:9 monitors in MMOs because they give you more screen real estate for larger ui/addon elements without cluttering the critical portion of the screen, in addition to getting a much nicer, more natural horizontal FoV. Higher than 60Hz is also a good idea, since that seems to be the way monitor tech is trending, since super high density displays lead to diminishing returns in image quality, in addition to lowering your fps.
---
And top tier raiding will still anyway be about chasing the highest DPS. 
---
Classic absolutely has merit and I can't wait for it, but a lot of these post are just circle-jerking. 
---
"You don't gotta lie to kick it homie."
---
\-you to your coworker, probably
---
the person he replied to. With 6-8k population you would need dynamic respawns or else you would not have a good experience on that server... constant resource camping, line ups for quest mobs etc. 
---
So essentially, I am going to be looking at having to heavily farm gold to both be optimal for raiding and for PvP Premades each week!
---
On the subject of CC, thats very lack luster which I am suprised about as it seems like roots it quite strong in alot of PvP videos! Thank you for the infomation!
---
There's already a few errors I can see in the Feral Druid BIS list. On top of that, the more significant problem is that this list doesn't properly specify patch content. No offense but without having tiered lists for each patch then any "ultimate" BIS list is effectively useless.
---
Not to mention spending several months just getting to level 60. I look forward to that.
---
Interesting, so there is no scope really for me to be within main team fights i'm assuming due to my low damage output and being the lowest throughput healer etc. Something i'm not overly familiar with having played Warrior so much. Hmm. 
---
It's absolutely worth it. Classic WoW will support up to at least 4K resolution. The extra real estate afforded by 1440p allows you a lot more flexibility for add-on placement and will give a more immersive experience. 
---
I'm impressed constantly by the sheer survivability of Druids. Is that their big gift that makes up for the lack luster damage (Although I saw some pretty nasty Starfire crits) and the sub par healing throughput?
---
Tips Out has been doing what he calls deep dives with some expert players of classes.  They go through pre raid BiS and they also talk about what to get if it's not available for the harder to get pieces.  He has only done a few classes so far.  Here is the rogue vid.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U83KVY5ikiE
---
The only 'content-creator' I give a shite about in gaming is Angry Video Game Nerd.
---
WoW came out before the streamers and we can do without them.
---
I’ve used a razer naga molten since it came out, I honestly think they make reliable products I’ve only ever had 1 of maybe 15 or so total razer products across console and computer that broke.
---
Dat naga molten does look sick tho
---
This is a brutal scenario. Your odds of survival are practically zero playing normally.
---
I would attempt to start a strange guild where there is a big focus on leveling as a group and keeping safe at all times. I'd roll alliance so the paladins can constantly consecrate the earth in a big circle around the ranged/healer players so no one (me) gets ganked by rogues. And I'd pick Paladin obviously for the bubble. My biggest fear would be a small group of invisible mages blinking close to PoM pyroblast/fireball me before I can immune bubble. (If there was a targeted attack on me like this, I'd try very hard to recruit as many paladins as possible so we can extend the consecration circle further before going back into any PvP zones.)
---
The most dangerous part of this would be the fact that the guild would no doubt level fairly slow, and so some quick level 60s might find it fun to attack a level 35 raid group. (Hopefully two raid groups) And the guild may become a target in general because of it's strangeness: "&lt;Guild Name&gt; is up north right now, anyone want to try and take them out with me?" The best possible solution to this would be to make it a guild rule to always avoid fights if possible and always be /e friendly with all horde players, but I would still imagine trying to defeat it might turn into a fun game. It might become necessary to always stay near a town with high level guards.
---
If the guild got decent traction, I'd put my odds around 40-70%.
---
Did I mention that this is a brutal scenario? Fun tho, thanks!
---
Before they nerfed invulnerable mail in vanilla I used to eat rogues of all spec alive on my ele shaman. I sincerely miss that overpowered mofo.
---
I love it. They honestly should keep making them they look so cool and are way more comfortable than the current nagas 
---
Every undead rogue ever would do it for 2$, guaranteed.
---
Eyes bro
---
If you're serious about PvP/PvE as a druid is you're looking at at least 2-3 bags full of gear on you and a lot of time farming gold for respecs/consumables. The amount of gear you had to carry was one of the most annoying things about the class. Also 4 sets of gear to keep enchanted... I would recommend to fully committing to either resto or feral at end game to avoid that. Doing feral (tank) &amp; feral(dps) &amp; resto with pvp variants for each will just drive you nuts.  
---

Vanilla druid pvp highlight videos are usually some aspect of kiting rogues/warriors around with roots in the open world to look impressive, because that's really the only way they can ever 1vN people. In any sort of premade PvP or duel situation it really doesn't work like that. Enemy melee have dispels and people have Free Action Potions and in duels people save their cooldowns like Intim Shout/Blind/Vanish/Grenade/Helm for the second you try to root/ng. Roots can come in handy but in general it's a very poor CC compared to Poly/Fear/Blind/Ice Trap/Sap/Frost - they are the core CC in organised PvP.
---
True. Sounds like such a pain though! 
---
Don't underestimate the environment. Especially if you are speed leveling and not just killing solo mobs in the forest.
---
The fact that you just went through and listed every class that should definitively beat rogue just shows you have low knowledge/skillcap. There are so many variables that play into vanilla pvp that you can't just say "this class will beat this class." Yeah you could say "SL locks will be a tough matchup for rogue" but that doesn't mean you're gonna get dusted every time.
---
I'm not gonna say rogues are OP, but they also don't suck like you seem to think. Big difference between and good rogue and a great rogue. Just like every other class.
---
I too like the idea of surrounding yourself in the games. Your eyes may not focus from your peripherals but that part of your vision is still submerged and it seems cool.
---
This is the kind of info that I have been looking for, cut and dry is always the way that I prefer it to come across! - That is slightly worrying in that case, I guess I'll have to commit totally to PvP then if I plan on rolling druid, as I will not have the time to be able to farm the gold needed for all that gear, + the numerous respecs I will need.
---
Kind of a bummer of a revelation, but better to know now than on release learning the hard way aye!
---
Kings and cleanse. 
---
No RNG needed. 
---
My point is more that the Classic launch will be markedly different from Vanilla's launch. If Blizz launches enough servers to sustain the first few weeks, the majority of those servers are going to die.
---
Classic is going to have tremendous appeal to a certain category of people, but the number of people who log on to give it a spin versus the number of people who will be there a month later is going to be the opposite of vanilla.
---
Sure, I appreciate your comment with respect to some people wanted to get off the high pop servers. I just suspect that we're going to see dozens of abysmally low pop servers and a handful of high pop realms, with none of the glorious medium pop from classic.
---
Since you said 60 I'm assuming it's Vanilla. Farm mobs until they're grey, then move on to the next yellow/green mobs until they're grey - rince and repeat until you die of old age because that's how long it would take
---
Or choose quests very carefully 
---
As a side note, the first time I tried to post that, was on my mobile phone - and I got that ban notification there.
---
But, after logging in from my laptop (with the same account), I was not banned there, so I posted the same reply and link again, so I got the same ban again. 
---
Huh.  Interesting.  Well I hope everything ends up fixed when you get your replacement in!  I've still got an old keyboard from them that's 10+ years old, and I finally got around to swapping out my mouse a couple years ago.  
---
And please do let me know if your new mouse fixed your issue!
---
Hey guys. Obviously people have been floating the idea of post Naxx content for some time now. Mainly Kara as its the biggest no brainer. Just wondering how ya'll felt about some of the other missed opportunities from back in the day, and seeing i made a video on it figured i'd post it here.
---
Im a big "no changes" guys fyi, just keep in mind the original content cycle is complete after Naxx. So imo expanding Classic's longevity in this way both circumvents infringing on the original Vanilla experience, while also exploring underutilized areas from back in the day.
---
Yeah maybe. I want some time to have huge wPvP battles before everyone just stands in cities queueing. 
---
I assume you guys are rolling NA - PVP?  What about faction?
