‚ÄúClassic experience ‚Äú.  - Blizzard
---

---
Yeah, not so much.
---
---
---
There is so much we don't know about how Blizzard works internally, their server architecture, layering specifically, and a million other things. This is like laying out how to we'll get to mars...
---
Im gonna be really pissed if they make language servers and no RP servers
---
Honestly all of the classes you‚Äôre interested in have very viable roles in pve. Especially if you‚Äôre casual. Spriest maybe the least but I think people over estimate the current ideas of what the ‚Äúraid meta‚Äùwill dictate in raid class distribution. Just my opinion but there will be many many times where raids are just looking to fill that 40 man limit. Maybe not initially as Hardcore guilds push content but definitely later on. Furthermore, it‚Äôs not like your looking to play some meme spec and raid hardcore. That may be a different story. Anything you decide out of those 4 classes will work for both pve and pvp with casual goals. So just go with what you see yourself enjoying the most as lame as it sounds.
---
Sounds like you just need to find right guild. Racism in my guild is limited at hating gnomes
---
Demo is viable for questing but deep affliction is the most optimal. You should just keep void out at all times while questing, he's your own personal tank. He also has a powerful pvp ability in void sacrifice, and with fel domination you can quickly summon another void (and sacrifice him again if you need to). 
---
One thing about your spec is I would definitely get 5/5 imp corruption early on. Instant corruption is just so nice to have. Also get improved void over succubus :)
---
They better not come out and say they aren't doing an Oceanic server next, cause that will be some good ole bullshit.
---
This is fucking amazing!
---
no, but it helps a little
---
I don't know i just found this pic.
---
AU is not in the US either...
---
This is why classic need way more beta testers!
---
Thank you... Yeah I'm not expecting to be taken into hardcore guilds, just want a spot and be able to progress at a decent pace. Leaning towards Spriest&gt;Lock
---
I can't tell if you even played the same game as me. Mindflay is the most mana inefficient spell in the game and to even use it you have to waste even more mana shielding yourself. 
---
I mean if you want to drink after every single pull, which i 100% know you do, go right ahead.
---
And saying "just go buy spirit gear off the AH to play this spec 4Head"...
---
While I‚Äôm afraid you‚Äôre right, I hope you‚Äôre not. The challenge of the dungeons was much more fun when it was more difficult early on.
---
3 per account.
---
Cheap shot &gt; Kidney shot &gt; Blind &gt; Restealth &gt; Preperation &gt; 15 sec wait &gt; Cheapshot &gt; Kidney shot &gt; Blind &gt; 15 sec wait &gt; Cheapshot &gt; Kidneyshot &gt; Goblin Rocket Helmet &gt; 15 sec wait &gt; Cheapshot &gt; Kidneyshot.
---
Use your damage abilities in between.
---
I have a pocket priest I think I can get it done
---
You‚Äôre not getting standing Orcs.
---
Is it unreasonable? The amount of interest in Classic Wow is huge. While 30,000 might seem excessive, it‚Äôs not unreasonable to think of 7-9k people trying to log into the same server causing huge queue times.
---
I know I don't have the motivation to level 3/4 to 60 just to have it all wiped in a few weeks. I've got 6 characters between levels 10 and 20. I want most of it to "feel fresh" come release.
---
They will just have queues but add more servers, while implementing temporary server transfers to new realms for free.
---
He is spot on. I think they should do away with layering. I would be ok with sharing the earlier levels. Imo, Blizzard should increase the cap to like 10k per server and launch few servers then call it a day.
---
&gt;look at the response to difficult heroics in Cataclysm
---
They weren't difficult.
---
They are correct about the 400ms window, but the way it's implemented is clearly wrong. [See this clip](https://clips.twitch.tv/TransparentGrotesqueMallardYouWHY). That delay is signifcantly more than 400ms. Keep in mind that 400ms is THE MAXIMUM it should ever be, and this is according to Blizzard. If you hit a spell near the end of the batch, it could be as low as 1ms though.
---
Here, I actually downloaded the clip and calculated the time exactly.
---
|Time Offset|Moment|
---
:--|:--|
---
|0ms|He enters the Blizzard AOE region|
---
|753ms|He gets the Blizzard effect|
---
|1769ms|He takes damage|
---
|2360ms|He receives the debuff that slows him|
---
Notice that the gap between all of those events is larger than 400ms.
---
My bestfriend just bought a brick cottage with a garage and a 40 000 square feet land. For 220k
---
Looks like you need to switch country mate üòÇ
---
It should just NOT be in the game at all. Today a certain popular pserver released a realm and they were TONNNNNNNNS of ppl but everyone grouped up, spawns were fast and everything went well. We don't need and don't WANT layering. :)
---
Magic is pretty big, most card shops/comic places that host tournaments have pretty good turnouts on those nights. I don‚Äôt play personally, a buddy from work has been playing since the late 90‚Äôs, but from what he‚Äôs told me it‚Äôs still a very active community.
---
I have seen chats with English, French, Russian, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese and other languages, it was fun, hilarious, full of memes and banter. Loved it.
---
Ah yes, forgot about the void sacrifice.  
---
So for someone with experience.  Are you able to sacrifice your void, summon a felhunter and deal with a rogue before you are dead?  Or is it moot because if a rogue SAP's you you're dead no matter what anyway?
---
I know the Void is most optimal, I'm just wondering if the time I'll spend running after I'm ganked will cost more time than using another pet.
---
Damn warriors keep getting buffed 
---
They're the class that need it the least lol
---
https://wow.tools/dbc/?dbc=spelleffect&amp;build=1.13.2.30862#search=684659&amp;page=1  
---
Field 7 should probably be -4 then, many game systems use negative values behind the scenes for easier math.
---
It didn't got shutdown by Blizzard. They received a ceise and desist letter (like almost every private server does) but instead of simply ignoring it and continueing their service (like almost every private server does) they shut it down on their own, hoping to use the publicity and momentum to create a dialog with Blizzard regarding much demanded official vanilla servers.
---
Blizzard has to sent those c&amp;d letters but not a single private server hosted outside the U.S. had been forced to shut down so far.
---
They might make us play on US realms for an authentic vanilla experience
---
I don't understand how server architecture would affect any element of this plan except server capacity and resiliency. This is all about when to flip the switches after you've already built the rocket to Mars (Layering) first and are now determining when to jettison thrusters and responding to atmospheric conditions on the way up. Still complicated, but you've done the hard part.
---
You mean a beta with a very limited number of invites has a very limited number of players? What?
---
I would pick either NElf or Dwarven area and get to honored. 10% discount applies to training so it helps save a little coin.
---
Personally plan on running to w/e area ties into the profession I choose. NElf if I decide LW, gnome/dwarf if i decide engi. Then doing some quests in the human area to get honored before that 40 for mount.
---
And honestly without dynamic respawns i dont think people are interested waiting 20 minutes in line to kill garrick padfoot or even begin to consider dicks to will steal/tag the mob while everyone else has been waiting. As long as layering goes away a couple weeks to a month in, it could be an ok thing.
---
I could have sworn scatter always had a diminishing return with freezing trap, but I was surprised to see it didn't when I played on a p server. I distinctly remembered trying to trap without scatter for that very reason, but I assumed I just remembered wrong.
---
Mage is probably your best bet if you want a great pvp and pve pure damage class. Anything is fine though really, most people you‚Äôre gonna fight in the open are gonna be people you‚Äôd beat with any class or people you‚Äôd lose to with most classes, very rarely is it even skilled (assuming that it‚Äôs not a gank)
---
If you aim is just to level fast nelf starting zones are generally considered to be the fastest. There will be much less players there than in the human zone, and dwarf zone is crap after the first 5 levels.
---
Don't need that, still got mine  [https://i.imgur.com/j4WYAMk.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/j4WYAMk.jpg)
---
So my client has the option for classic beta but it says I can't play it yet. My brother's does not have the option at all. Anyone else notice that?
---
My one and only goal is rank 10
---
I don't think it would be a good idea. Layering is more of a thing where it's either turned on or off. You could either restrict phasing between layers for high level characters, or you could create a dedicated layer for for them, both of which impact gameplay more than the original implementation. 
---
As long as layering exists you still have the problem where the server is divided into several 'layers' and the population is distributed throughout, if you cannot change layers then you cannot play together with a large number of people on the same server. 
---
Layering in its current implementation is restrictive enough that unless intentionally abused doesn't pose much of a threat to gameplay.
---
I‚Äôm just going to get any leather/mail gear with str/agi and use a 2h. I‚Äôll keep some int/spirit gear with me the whole way if I need to do more dedicated healing maybe in a dungeon setting.
---
this is really the only issue i see in layering:
---
"im standing in goldshire, do you not see me?"
---
"no?" im standing right where youre saying"
---
Obviously they can group up, but poof, people disappear.  Those certain interactions are what made vanilla, vanilla.
---
No gouge?
---
It seems as though all systems are in their 8.X state.  This means there is a ton of shit that still needs to be fixed.
---
You might have to recreate group, that usually fixes it.
---
I think I'm the only one in the world who hates upright orcs.
---
You will be missing a few talents but nothing too game breaking for lower tier raiding. 
---
Don't tell anyone but I am planning to have a few alchemist for transmitting. Free gold every what 3 days. A couple of those should get me at least 100g a week in passive income.
---
Darkshore is a better leveling zone than Westfall and Loch Modan. The human and dwarf speedlevelers will be coming to you, not the other way around.
---
Hmm... I'll give mage a try... I'm not one for squishy classes usually. Spriest is very tanky due to shadow form and bubble, and lock is tanky as well. I will try it though.
---
I‚Äôm just going to get any leather/mail str/agi gear and a 2h weapon and then hold onto any int/spirit gear to use if I need to do any dedicated healing in a 5man setting.
---
Dedicate time to get the right gear and study up - You'll be just fine man. Enjoy!
---
[removed]
---
Whatever helps me avoid having a queue to log in, and not spend the first few hours competing for mobs. I don't care about other people's concerns regarding layering, I don't want to wait. My time is more valuable to me at 36 than it was at 21, and I don't really care what "purists #nochanges" folks spout.
---
On hunter:
---
Easy to level, not easier to play than other DPS until TBC.
---
Really good dps early on, and you can compete in dps meters well enough in Ony, MC, and kinda in BWL. Around AQ they drop off hard and stay that way. This is mostly due to the lack of pet scaling with gear.
---
Hunters are still desired in endgame due to Tranq shot and some other utility.
---
As far as gearing, I'm seeing some renewed interest in GDKP runs of farm content. So the best gold farming in the game can help you gear up a bit faster. (Assuming you find the right people)
---
Fun wise, rpg elements and a relatively interesting rotation keep me in.
---
Hope that helps!
---
People don't like that it "rewards" people with more free time.  "He has no life so he got exalted before me!"
---
Closer to level 50 you‚Äôll probably be doing more group content anyways so you might just make the complete swap there if Resto is what you really want to do at end game.
---
Aside from my main, I'll level my alts mostly on rested XP, so I will still see endgame.
---
You may have to respec (pvp and pve specs for mages are pretty different) but that‚Äôs the case for pretty much every class. Mage is also one of the strongest farmers on top of having the option to portal for gold (also low cost of maintenance; you make your own food and water!). Good luck!
---
I am going to guess you have it installed. Uninstall it and see if its still there!
---
No
---
 RemindMe! 2 days
---
where the f do you live in Aus? it‚Äôs around $19 here.
---
appreciate the help!
---
Good on you for not quietly wanting something that buffs your class :p I remember being mad when the hunter deadzone was removed even though I played a hunter since I felt like it made the class too easy to play and made movement/placement in PvP less impactful.
---
It's horrible. I don't understand how those people can just echo garbage indefinitely. It doesn't matter what you do. You can say something, ignore them, get upset, whatever. In their eyes, they "win" every conversation by upsetting someone else.
---
I just /ignore them and go on about my day. I don't use profanity filters because I rather like the F word, but I don't need children spamming my chat with the N word.
---
There are BFA private servers.
---
If your real handle is unique, what are the chances someone else is going to pick it up.  
---
Look on live armory and see how many characters there are that use your desired names.
---
On top of that, it wasn't hard to get groups going for those instances, even on normal.  Every physical DPS wanted that helm enchant from Cenarion Expedition.
---
I see, thank you
---
Yea people who play mmos don't know what buffs are.

Lol.

To the OP, you had access to the stress test that started Wednesday. Today was the last day for it IIRC.

terrible tank then. watching KTM also doesn't need skill lmao.

"dots and burns"

lol. shadowbolt will always be 90% of your dmg. there isn't anything hard about it, sorry.

i would buy someone donuts for 8/9 plagueheart.

Hey, I replied to another person about this same thing, but I figured you may be interested in my response as well as I provided a time by time analysis that shows the 400ms window is not working. [Here's the thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c3sl50/tfw_2_french_baguettes_can_deliver_a_more/ertoj1q/?context=3)
---
10k per server?  Absolutely not. Blizzlike caps. None of this private server megaserver bullshit.
---
That's working exactly as intended. Blizzard only ticks once a second. Spell batching is separate from Blizzard ticks.
---
- T+00:09.191: He enters the Blizzard AoE
---
- T+00:10.209: He enters combat as the first Blizzard tick occurs. Blizzard ticks once a second so this is normal.
---
- T+00:10.494: He takes damage and gets slowed. Spell batches fire every 400ms so this is also normal.
---
Pservers have dynamic respawns. No thanks. 
---
People really should stop comparing shitty pservers to this.
---
You mean they aren't all farming Uldaman lockouts for Pendulum of Doom ??
---
we have a max, but no min time
---
I‚Äôve been getting a green item every single time. I‚Äôm off to buy some lottery tickets!
---
Mostly been folk from Singapore, Aus and NZ in my guilds over the years. How could I forget them!
---
And my axe
---
Why don‚Äôt you look at one of the hundred other posts about this that show up daily m
---
2 Friends and I rolled in the Dwarven/Gnome starting area on the Classic 3 server. Between level 1 - 10 I saw 6 people. Including the trip into Ironforge to pickup tailoring and drop off a quest. This is not what I want at all. I don't care if mob tagging is a cluster fuck and it takes me 5 hours to get out of the first zone.
---
Is this even English?
---
You really think shadow focus is that good when on a single mob you are casting at most 2 shadow spells? SW:P + Mind blast. That‚Äôs it. Blackout for sure is good if you plan on doing some PvP while lvling but not necessary at all for lvling/grinding. Also you still need to put points across all tress for a trispec, so it‚Äôs not like you take Spirit tap and then completely ignore the shadow tree.
---
You‚Äôll be fine
---
You'll be there day 1 like the rest of us, and there's nothing wrong with that!
---
did you get beat as a child?
---
Spell batching isn't artificial lag. I don't know what the batch window actually is, but let's say it's .5 seconds. If you cast a spell on the enemy at the beginning of a new batch window it still registers as having been on the enemy for .5 seconds. .5 seconds of lag would be if you cast the spell and it happens .5 seconds later. If you've played on any of the beta servers at all you can feel the difference between lag and spell batching immediately.
---
Did you get dropped on your head as a child
---
I didn't know it was considered fastest. Does it pick up quickly after 8? I found it to be so tedious trying to get the various animal parts to drop while competing with people who tag faster than me.
---
Out of the loop. Do orcs not normally stand?
---
That was my next question
---
It would be only 10k for a little while. More than likely, half the population will be quiting,so you do not half to worry about a dead server. Layering will be abused I have seen it in beta already.
---
None of the daily quest factions in BC had any relevance on raiding or PvP, so they weren't *terrible*.  And realistically, by the time Quel'Danas came out, you were probably done with Netherwing/Ogri'la/Skyguard anyhow.
---
Or your gear is terrible. A good lock will always struggle with threat, especially on Horde side. 
---
A lock playing it safe at 90% threat will do less damage than a lock that can push it to 120% without risking taking aggro.
---
It's also nice because it'll fuck over hordes who want to gank redridge.
---
There is what, 5.03 million active retail players right now? 
---
And they all have access to classic servers for free?
---
And then add in returning players that will sub purely for classic?
---
How is it unreasonable to think in the first few weeks (that we are talking about in this thread) that my numbers are u reasonable?
---
I'm done with you, it doesn't matter what I say you'll just sore some shit.
---
Leeway was in vanilla right? Of course technology is better and this could probably be updated now, but I don't remember Mages being that bad in vanilla, or any other casting class. I'm not sure I'm for or against "fixing" it, but leaving it the way it is, even if it does seem broken, wouldn't break my heart.
---
What if it's designed to autoscale based off population targets? What is automated about layers? Could it be clustered with retail hardware since it's based off the same tech? What impacts would that have? Can layers not just collapse into a single layer that represents a "realm"? Are realms even physical servers anymore or or more like a VM? What are the population caps that they are shooting for? Will those caps be variable? If so, what range? How do layers interface with those caps? Is it set per layer? If not automated, who needs to be aware of a change? Do we need to coordinate with the Community team to have them be ready to handle issues? Are we going to roll out changes slowly? Do we need to merge all realms at the same time?
---
There are a million more questions I would have before I could even consider laying out a plan for how it would work.
---
What if someones character is a twink, will they be layered forever?
---
I‚Äôm gonna mainly be pvping with my hunter so this is pretty game breaking
---
I like this new sound though. That creaking in 1.12 sounds abnormally loud.
---
Ha i lived in Nashville for two years! I love the south! I just also love living in the heart of dc lol
---
&gt; Smart hunters
---
What?
---
I like how you cherry-picked the example where it's plausible instead of the later one where the spell batch clearly fires more than 400ms later. I already told you that it's possible for it to fire early, so this doesn't really mean anything.
---
The latter example was 2.36 seconds. Even if the effect fires at exactly 400ms and the Blizzard ticks exactly at the end, that's still about 1 full second too late. Ping and framerate imprecision do not account for that final second.
---
Not to mention, this isn't the only example, it's just a very clear example of the delay and easy to digest since it shows how Blizzard is essentially useless now.
---
If they intend on keeping melee leeway either because they want it in the game or because they don't have time to fix it, it's going to be really hard to get used to. Main reason other than it just being a bad mechanic is private server experience for me. I have played on a couple private servers now and when you have experienced vanilla without it it's going to feel extra horrible having such a clunky movement mechanic in the game.
---
 Being able to kite stuff is so important, it's something that is fun and brings so much to the game. Even for melee classes it's important. Would suck so much when playing a warrior for example if you couldn't hamstring kite mobs and instead would just have to facetank every mob or hamstring and backpedal like some idiot( my understanding is that if you backpedal instead of strafe you can kite but maybe this is incorrect).
---
What you just described is layering................. 
---
Also. Again. Layering is temporary.
---
I think what they were testing was automated systems for merging layers as population drops.
---
That macro wont work in classic btw.
---
But I actually like the added sound effect...
---
No, not to this extent and range.
---
It's 12:00am UTC, which means it'll be the 26th anywhere West of that. The 27th is mainly for Europeans and Asians.
---
I can almost guarantee the cities wont be empty come launch, even with layering. Each layer will supposedly have the same population as a vanilla server did back then. So at/after launch, the only reason any cities might be empty should be due to nobody actually being there. Layering will be extremely useful as long as it does go away after the first few weeks once things have settled down and people have spread out after the launch rush.
---
Dynamic respawn is way better than layering in the first couple hours imo. 
---
iF yOu dOnT lIkE iT dOnT pLaY iT.
---
Lol... this is the best game in the world i will play it even if layering is on for all of it.
---
That would be great, sadly thats not how they implemented layering.
---
The easiest method would be just to disable layering completely after Day1. I'm not how easy it is to put all 20+ Chars in the same layer.
---
https://wowclassicpopulation.com/activity?realm=Classic%20Beta%20PvP
---
No, my sets are preserved in photo albums. Don't really want to play with 16 of every card...including 16 Mox's
---
No because layering won‚Äôt last forever - they‚Äôve already said that.
---
Number 2 is Pservers only. You can't control where mobs will run at low health or via fear in Classic (nor could you in Vanilla).
---
Number 5 is unnecessary. You should have an addon that automatically vendors junk, repairs your armor, and replenishes any reagents. There are several at https://willitclassic.com
---
Number 8 is also better explained as "get addons". Just get one that shows the vendor price of every single item in the tooltip.
---
RemindMe! August 27
---
Don't you have to set that as a global option for all subs?
---
The batch has little if nothing to do with this. If it was the batch causing this then at most the delay would be 400ms, and average 200ms. The actual delay here is well over a second and seems fairly consistent, as it seemed to tick 1 second after the aura has been applied both times he ran through.
---
To begin with I'm not sure if Blizzard's AoE detection back then even worked via the batch. It might have, but if it did then surely only to apply the "Blizzard" aura. The problem here is that the first tick doesn't happen until a second after the aura has been applied, rather than upon the next actual tick.
---
1: there was only 2 difficulty of raids and it was for the last 2 raids.  (I‚Äôm not including the ruby sanctum or w/e it was called as that was terrible)
---
And I wouldn‚Äôt include hardmodes as vanilla has hardmode bosses as well in case you forget.
---
2: All raids become irrelevant before new xpac... I think you worded this incorrectly.
---
3: LFG was around at the very tail end of wotlk, I‚Äôm not going to judge the 90s off of 1998-2000.... I like to look at things as a whole.  This was a terrible move, BUT at the time when it was brand new it was fun and great.  Until it became the norm for gear progression, when wotlk introduced wotlk people were already geared so it was mostly used for fun. 
---
4:  It was a joke later down the line but the mount hunting in wotlk for the achievements were hard and fun because of how new it was,  and just like I said it was fun during the time, but when it became the norm from every point forward is when it started to become boring gameplay.
---
5: game balanced, what?  What in the hell are you talking about lol wotlk had some of the most egregious examples of imbalanced gameplay there was.  
---
The thing about it is the negative that did end up being bad things were fun during that time.  Like imagine playing through a game and the last 10% of it you had cheats that let you go nuts.  It‚Äôs fun.  But then have a game where it just gives you cheats throughout the whole game.  Not fun.
---
I could literally write a book about what cata doubled down  on or added that completely ruined the game but if you are honestly at the point where you just can‚Äôt see why people blame cata *at all* then there‚Äôs no point wasting my time
---
The void shield is pretty significant and with the cooldown you can instantly get a new one for another shield. This makes you a beast in wPvP.

---
Oof, I'm not the only one.
---
Ok but have you started downloading hardcore pornography yet? Thats the true Paladin leveling experience
---
Guess how I know you never played in WotLK? It's because you actually believe anything you just posted.
---
Better to focus your spec on leveling than trying to prepare for the occasional gank. You'll probably save time.
---
You can set the loot to FFA if you want, but you still need to collect them separately.
---
Elwyn has a lot of travel time going between northire, westfall, redridge and it's usually the most populated starting zone in the whole game. Nelfs have the least populated zone and have a fairly straight run through to lvl 20 off by themselves.    
---
    
---
There are annoying quests in the nelf zone but there's annoying quests everywhere. The grass isn't always greener.    
---
You shouldn't ever be sitting around for 20 seconds and then trying to get a tag on spawn if you're trying to level fast. Going and kill something you don't have a quest for but getting sure exp is much better than just hoping you get lucky for minutes at a time. Keep moving, keep killing, don't ever sit around waiting. Avoid travel time as much as possible.  
---
  
---
The classes aren't dramatically different at tagging. All ranged classes can tag with rank 1 1.5s  spells.
---
Was a a slacker and never finished any of them despite playing the whole xpac. Seem to remember having the void ray mount in my bag forever and not being able to use it.
---
Agreed they weren‚Äôt the end of the world, and in theory they got max level people out into the world more, but it just left a bad taste in my mouth.
---
Between this and the way melee leeway works right now, I am reconsidering choosing a mage to main in pvp...
---
Hopefully Blizzard addresses this before launch.
---
Technically you can just add "+none" to the subreddit to disable the style (i.e: /classicwow+none/) but I like the style just wish they would optimize it.   
---
BTW I'm like 90% sure the problem is in the top banner.
---
That's why I was hoping for some sort of classic. I'll take a classic that's not 100% knowing my character won't get wiped, the servers won't get DDoS (rebirth) or servers shut down (nost).
---
 Check one of the 1000 posts asking the same thing today.
---
&lt;3
---
You can adjust targets and parameters, something they were likely testing during the stress test based on the varied experiences. 
---
We don't what is automated, but they do, and we can guess or discuss what we think should and should not be automated. 
---
If it can be clustered and that's economic, it likely will be, but I fail to see which aspects this impacts in our experience, only how the back end is being juggled. 
---
Layers could collapse into a single realm and I've proposed this elsewhere in my description of possible layering behaviors. Adjusting the target population parametdrs periodically to gradually grow to server capacity would be an apparently easy way of achieving this end. Disabling layering entitely would be achieving the
---
Smart hunters won't multi shot near sap and sheep in the first place.
---
Nobody asked that. Why do you keep saying it?
---
Nobody in this thread has ever asked "are cata dungeons difficult?".
---
He did use feign, it shows as if his hp is 0 but he's still alive playing dead over there I'm sure.
---
The points he touched on are the same points many people who have made their living on making content about this game have touched on. This stuff needs to be at least addressed and hopefully remedied.
---
The numbers for the second example are virtually identical:
---
- T+00:20.886: He enters the Blizzard AoE
---
- T+00:21.905: He enters combat
---
- T+00:22.189: He takes damage and gets slowed.
---
When he visually enters the AoE (your T+0) Blizzard has just ticked (it ticks every full second and you can conveniently see the enemy castbar, though it's delayed by about 0.2 seconds due to latency). The first tick he's affected by is when the spell is at 5 seconds left. The first tick he takes damage from is the next one, when the spell is at 4 seconds left.
---
It does seem that the effect of the first tick is ignored aside from putting him in combat. This could be a bug, but it's just as likely to be a feature. Either way, the delay caused by spell batching here is working as intended.
---
Imagine being so short sighted and generally retarded to not realise the ramifications of weeks of exploiting multiple layers to avoid world PVP and farm abhorent amounts of resources (devilsaur leather, black lotus,...) vs you not being able to quest for the first day!!!!! REEEEEEE
---
Maybe you could adapt and lvl to 5 via exploration and grinding, but obviously you don't seem to be someone who is capable of any degree of foresight so I suppose that's out of the question too.
---
Most people are aware layering is necessary for the starting zones - people will be heavily spread out at 30+ and layering may not be necessary which is what people are advocating now.
---
I didn‚Äôt need to answer it but yeah, chat being filled with twitch emotes, the streamer getting just given whatever they want. (First chance at raids, ringing the AQ bell)
---
1. Spell Efficiency - You dont have to get spells every two levels. Skip spells you dont need. Plan ahead.
---
2. Positioning - Only in Pservers so dosnt matter.
---
3. Do cloth Donations - Good for rep, get some xp. Good way to get different races mount early
---
4. Learn secondary professions - fishing, cooking, first aid
---
5. Vendor macro - macro wont work in Classic. But make macro to sell all grey items so you dont have to individually 
---
6. Make a bank alt. - Make a bank alt. Get to level 5 so you can disenchant
---
7. No Rez sickness before lvl 10 - before 10 it may be quicker to just die and rez sick to save time and get out of starting zone quicker.
---
8. The heaviest weapon will sell more - when choosing quest rewards, if you are just going to vendor it go for the heavier item.
---
Suddenly redridge became peaceful
---
Isle of Thunder and Timeless isle were neat extra content too
---
clickbait garbage
---
Lol bye
---
Why would there be 2.5k players in the same starting zone with layering?
---
I'm actually surprised it lasted this long. But it makes sense, people don't want to invest too much time into their beta characters when they know it isn't forever.
---
How many people do you think are on that server in 6 months?
---
5 &amp; 8 - get addons to do this for you
---

---
OK good to know. I really don't want to get too lost. 
---
Thanks!
---
Hell yes.
---
That's so awesome. I can't wait to jump in!
---
Interesting video.
---
The way I understand sharding it is an aggressive dynamic layering. Too many ppl in an are, boom lets grab a few of them and put them in a different place. From my personal experience the very first stress test was something similar to sharding, ppl would just pop here and here, mobs would just appear. No consistency at all.
---
The last test to level 15 was nice. Two servers 3 (I am guessing with layering on max) and 15 (with layering on min). There was consistency, ppl and mobs did not just appear. You had the sense of consistency.
---
Here is an interesting alternative. Say your goal is 3K concurrent players. So lock top 3K of the highest level players currently logged on into a "main" layer. They cannot hop it, even if they get an invite from a 39 man raid of level 1s, those level 1s will move to the "main" layer. The idea is to have some kind of one server stability as population stabilizes. 
---
If more higher level players log on the cutoff simply moves up to maintain the 3K main layer. One restriction the cutoff cannot go above say level 25 or 30 or 35. Any player of that level will always be on the main layer no matter the population. 
---
What do you think?
---
Let me know if I need to clarify anything.
---
yo so, no shit, does this means you have access?
---
Avoid spriest. Your raid would want 100% attendance from their spriest, and you'll likely be low on priority for caster loot.   
---
Hunters are good, but there's an understandable prejudice against them because playing them is marginally more challenging than other classes. So the average player on a hunter ends up looking pretty bad. Roll hunter if you have above-average competence.  
---
Rogue damage rotation is far, far more interesting than warlock damage rotation. Having to summon people and farm shards can also be a little tedious, while a rogue basically just shows up and gets to hit stuff.
---
So my recommendation would be hunter &gt; rogue. Good luck.
---
aren't european proud to speak 3-4 language? aren't they laughing at american who only speak one?
---
english is the most spoken 2nd language in the world, how is that not a good reason to learn it?
---
Many years later it holds up to the test of time right!? Still know all the words.
---
OK, this is good to know. I'll keep this in mind. Thanks!
---
Huge fucking yikes, not the streamer. 
---
Layering as they want to implement it, will severely hurt social interactions, world pvp, ganking, contesting, gold economy, just so they can make life easier for the "normies" who can't handle competition or hardships for half hour. 
---
Ironically the target public they are trying to make life easier with layering and make sure they stay around for the longest possible till level progression stabilizes, will be the ones affected the most by layering. 
---
All the basic materials who can provide them a decent source of gold, so they can respec, buy their mounts and riding skills, this and that, will be devalued to the ground. 
---
Experienced players will manage it, like they always have, they know which classes to level for farming, where to do it and how and how to use auction house.
---
Ultimately layering is literally counterproductive because it is the antithesis for everything wow vanilla was developed for and it's qualities.
---
I sincerely hope they restrict layering to starting zones only or disable it as soon as you get into contested zones.
---
LMAO you can almost hear it: "Fresh bread for sale!.." echoing down the corridors, with no response.
---
???????? What is your point? No one will be there! I will not be there for sure Classic will be out lol.
---
Essentially yes.  They recreated vanilla using the modern engine and are releasing content in phases as it was in the original.  It won't be the same, but they're trying to get it as close as they can, barring a few details.
---
I'm not arguing, I'm stating it.
---
I'd rather they just make it so where you only actually change layers when you take a boat or zeppelin.
---
&gt; So you have a ton of freedom to explore and play without too much concern for finances.
---
I only experienced the stress test, but with how giant the world already is, I can't wait for fast travel. LOL
---
Ohh noz someone got that stupid shit pvp trinket from guruabashi.  Ohh nooz what shall we do!!!!
---
Unless other faction is doing the same? Hard to say but I see this as a possible solution.
---
This is what happened in actual vanilla when the game grew past blizzards expectations. It's bound to happen again.
---
Filthy kneeler
---
It's not.
---
Its a fine line, you have to keep the issues raised so theyre addressed. Blind faith wont do us any good. But yeah the fatalists are tiring
---
&gt;There is what, 5.03 million active retail players right now?
---
Source?
---
I really wish nothing but the best for this guy as I have nothing against him personally. But fuck I wish he wasnt the face of Classic on youtube. Im almost tempted to make a youtube account just so I can get him off my recommended...but then youtube would win.
---
Just saw Avenue Q a couple months ago. My girlfriend thought I'd love it, and she was absolutely correct.
---
&gt; Some blame it on A and B design teams, but I really am not sure. 
---
Vanilla was great (so great we're getting Classic!), BC was great (IMO BC was the peak of the game, flying notwithstanding), Wrath was great (peaked at ~13 million subs).  All of those were done by a single design team.  It wasn't until Cata development that they started splitting teams so they could really keep up with activi$ion$ goal of a new expac every 1-2 years.
---
At that point, we had a great base game and 2 great expansions behind it (Team A).  Then Cata fucked shit right up, and wasn't super well received (Team B).  MoP was an improvement over Cata I'd say most people would agree (Team A), WoD was a straight up fucking shit show, PvP balanced was garbage, PvE content droughts though I think most agree that the content that *did* come out was pretty good (Team B).  Legion was great relatively to what we had gotten used to at this point, and was overall seen as a good direction for the game (Team A).  BfA, while super hyped up, turned out to be a total shit show (Team B).
---
Really, its been an extremely noticeable every other expac since Cata has been good.  Good, bad, good, bad, the cycle continues as long as you have 2 teams that work on separate content at the same time.  One team is basically busy making their own game that undermines and flips the old game on its head every 1.5-2 years, its blatantly apparent and its fucking awful.
---
Seriously, its extremely telling that the most hyped games Blizzard has on the table right now is a WC3 remaster, a Starcraft remaster, and WoW Classic.  Blizzard sucks at making good games now, they're reliant on the name and reputation that the old, pre activi$ion Blizzard built to sell you new trash.
---
Because it has nothing to do with layering. You're making it out like it has 3-player limit on the layers.
---
A lot of people said Hunter damage falls off hard though, so idk
---
You guys are missing the mark, layering is not supposed to fix "starting areas" to make them playable. Blizzard does not care if you can complete the quests or get mobs at all.  
---
The starting areas will not make a difference with 0 layers on 20 layers, because the realm cap in it self and each layer is the same.  
---
If you have 0 layering you will have 3000 people spread across 6 starting zones, with layering you will have 3000 people spread across 6 starting zones (except there are gonna be more copies of the same instances)  
---
Layering is there to solve 2 things, REALM POPULATION and QUEUE TIMES.   
---
Yes there will be cons like layer swapping to avoid world pvp ganking, to snag some Gurubashi chests or to kill some rare spawns 1 more time perhaps or get another herb or vein.   
---
People are so missing the point of layering  
---
Layering will be needed until people start spreading out their playing schedules to different times / days of the week so all the players are more spread out, because at launch, everyone is gonna be playing at the same time regardless of where theyre from.  
---
blizzard only cares about if people are ABLE to log in and play the game, what you can or cant do ingame is not their concern as thats a gameplay issue and not a technical issue
---
Huh weird, I'm almost sure it had the correct sound during the Blizzcon trial. It was one of the first things I checked out when I went on that server.
---
So I guess they changed it between the Blizzcon trial and the beta release
---
I'd be very happy with rank 13. I'd be content with 10-12. 14 is not feesable.
---
So will druids be able to use polearms (Spears) in classic? It says they can in the manual
---
You can adjust targets and parameters, something they were likely testing during the stress test based on the varied experiences. We don't what is automated, but they do, and we can guess or discuss what we think should and should not be automated. If it can be clustered and that's economic, it likely will be, but I fail to see which aspects this impacts in our experience, only how the back end is being juggled. Layers could collapse into a single realm and I've proposed this elsewhere in my description of possible layering behaviors. Adjusting the target population parametdrs periodically to gradually grow to server capacity would be an apparently easy way of achieving this end. Disabling layering entitely¬†would be achieving the same end suddenly. 
---
Realms are likely to be VM and variable from what is understood about Layering, its purpose, and its implentation. 
---
Population caps are speculative and something the community should discuss what they believe should be maximal or optimal. The minimum desired ranges are likely known from past experience, the question is maximum and attrition. 
---
Layers are a secondary population cap, allowing for surge population to be taken into account and flexibly adjust for attrition/settling while always maintaining worlds filled with X players on Y designated Realm. Layer caps and thresholds are parameters they should know and have developed. Layer count should be the more flexible parameter, adapting to allow players in after one fills, collapsing with another layer if the two layers have sufficiently depopulated. This process could be automated. 
---
What issues are you imagining the Community team would need to address? The Community team should already be communicating details of how a system like Layering will be operating to the best extent they can prior to Launch and what the plans are for its implementation and removal. 
---
Changes should be rolled out with advance notice at whatever pace is necessary. Layering should end on all realms at the same time. It may functionally end sooner if a realm does not have sufficient activity to populate a second layer. 
---
Layers should either be merged at set times (server resets) or whenever activity parameters are met and if so, provide a warning to the two layers being forcibly merged. There should be both a cooldown on how frequently this should happen and enough difference between the size needed to create a layer and the size to collapse one that it does not happen regularly.
---
no, it's obviously a  spin of some sort
---
Thanks man. I think matching movement speed is going to be a nice plus for this duo.
---
I guess it's common courtesy, and the fact that WoW hasn't had this kinda of interaction between players for a long time in-game. It's nice to see people helping eachother.
---
RemindMe! in 64 days
---
&gt; 30+ and layering may not be necessary which is what people are advocating now.
---
Show where I said I was against this, and also show me that there is any evidence that layering *by level* is possible. 
---
&gt; generally retarded  REEEEEEE
---
Now this I can agree with. Don't worry buddy you'll get those fortnite dances down one day.
---
they could just make the veins / herbs kinda "stick" to your current layer if you looted it already
---
There is never any sources on current wow pop. Long ago, Blizzard had made it private and very clear they won't release them because current active subs aren't what bring in money, its the cash shop. And that's what they want investors to focus on.
---
Dosnt matter this post it self has nothing to do with wow classic. Its advertising a youtube channel with a picture of the streamer behind it. If this was a video of someone playing wowclassic, talking about wowclassic, maybe even a picture of wow classic then I would agree. But his has nothing to do with wowclassic.
---
They really should just unlock level 60 and plenty of people will be back on. I leveled two characters to 40 quickly, ran some dungeons, and then leveled a bunch of other alts for fun. Basically just testing out all kinds of leveling routes/zones to test as much of the 1-40 game as possible
---
I had Adblock Plus enabled but "turned off" for reddit but I was still having the performance problems till i completely disabled the entire addon. Not sure what's going on but try to reproduce it with the adblock addon installed.
---
Probably with [ReShade](https://reshade.me/)
---
It is so tempting though!
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
....Must not reach for wallet.....
---
Gonna have to try a bit harder than that, ma'am.
---
Yeah but didn't the rules get changed? Like you don't have to RP per say on it?
---
Yea there is not much to do at 40, WSG‚Äôs run when the Euro‚Äôs are online but then stop.
---
If it‚Äôs not a try hard group both sides have a jump master x taking flag and exploiting terrain all day.
---
I admit though to mind controlling 3 people out of WSG because of the games being lame.
---
I solved the problem for me. I had the Adblock Plus addon for firefox. Had to totally disable the entire addon and the performance hit went away. This could be your issue.
---
I really hate to burst your bubble but wow servers can take over 10k players at the same time without any issues. The problem is only if you want to keep using the cheapest possible server architecture, virtualizing 3-4 wow servers on 1 hardware server it does not work. This is a greed issue to maximize revenue not a technical one.
---
then you have sharding just like in retail, nobody wants that, kills the community
---
Hope you're ready to wear a bright blue dress for an entire raid tier.
---
Okay well you should write Blizzard a letter about it then.
---
exactly, its strange, artificial, and just really bad.
---
I leveled a mage to 31 and a druid to 23 before I lost interest.
---
I haven't lost interest in classic at all and can't wait for release just the beta feels a bit pointless.  Population is so low it feels like I am playing solo and since the level cap likely won't be raised past 40 there is little point in continuing.
---
I wish they would invite a lot more people or do more test like they did with AV.
---
I was considering dual boxing with a priest at least up to 30 to get my WW axe.
---
Sorry, those get fixed in 2.0
---
&gt; Show where I said I was against this, and also show me that there is any evidence that layering by level is possible.
---
Show me any evidence that layering by level isn't possible. Nice now we're on the same level. Use your brain, do you think maybe blizzard and their huge amount of resources could possibly modify an already recently modified system?
---
&gt; BC really remedied that by giving most DPS classes a boost to be a bit more equal, while still keeping what made them special.
---
Right, that's nice and all, but Classic is not a B.C clone, and everyone has been pretty adamant about no changes so you can either deal with it or keep playing retail, or just wait until Classic inevitably does well and B.C. gets released since B.C was by far the best expansion the series ever saw.
---
You can just press the esc key as well.
---
There were a lot less games available back then. And the player base has changed quite a bit. Most of classic will be returning wow players not new players like vanilla. It was released at the perfect time and if it would be originally released now it would compete with fornite, Apex, league, which are all free to play and cater to younger crowds. No way can you expect original market trend.
---
Translation
---
Poggers = :O (or) Epic, awesome.
---
Twitch prime tier 3 = Give this man and twitch money so you can watch him play a video game even though the video will be available on youtube and twitch for free later.
---
No lol, that could just crash the servers and would mess up everything just like private servers, they need to start adding crazy dynamic respawn as extra help etc.
---
"Peruse" is not an entry level word fam. Also this person is on the internet can clearly confirm spellings.
---
Thanks for linking those videos, now I had to look at lores stupid face.  I get irrationally mad when I see that fucking idiot even attempt to talk about WoW like he has a fucking clue what makes the game good.  I've literally never seen someone who is such a waste of payroll in my life.  Those people holding warning flags on the side of the road during construction that people all like to mock for being a waste of a salary and not actually doing any work?  Yeah, they're worth infinitely more money than fucking lore is.  At least the flag serves a purpose, and they hold the flag up.
---
It's me or the char looks like Mr.Slave?
---
Yeah that's one of the ways to cancel your target, of course.
---
I'm actually on the opposite side of the spectrum. I wavered on BfA a number of months ago already, and getting into the classic beta actually made me want to mess around on retail a bit again. 90% of my time will still go towards classic, but I don't think I'll ever be completely free of retail despite how much I internally complain about it.
---
Yeah you will have 4 times the amount of mats on the auction house if you have 4 layers, but you will also have about 12k people buying those mats instead of 3k. it evens out most likely, its not that big of a deal.
---
Nice find
---
How about Survival Hunter?
---
Only thing that really comes close to a 'melee hunter' is a..survival hunter which I highly do not advise rolling one.
---
If you do want to stick to melee, Warrior is a solid choice, but I would honestly go with hunter if you want any ranged capability at all.
---
Beta isn't inconsequential. Isn't layering something they should be testing too?
---
sap
---
That is a far, far more complex solution than the one suggested in this thread. The layers as they are are entirely separate. They're probably virtual machines that may or may not be on the same physical device. What you're suggesting is to add communication between servers, which were inherently designed to be separate, as well as add "cooldown" timers on nodes bound to a specific layer.
---
OP's answer solves the problem in a much better fashion and is very easy to implement.
---
Aren't we trying to go for the authentic experience?
---
You seem fun at parties
---
Man...I really want to main another class but I played rogue in vanilla and I keep getting the itch. Honestly probably the most fun I had from any expansion
---
I have vanilla, bc, cata, and wrath, and panda. Panda was only gotten at the time since I have all the prior ones. After panda I just quit.
---
Broke AF. Will Blizz be able to fix all these game breaking bugs in a couple weeks? Hunters are completely unplayable at the moment. Don't even get me started on layering. They should push back the release until at least Winter, IMO. I know it sucks, but I'd rather them take more time and get all these things worked out.
---
Roll a rogue.
---
Hew was doing okay at first, then went stupid.
---
I don't know how you're attributing Naxx raid design to wotlk? It a pure watered down copy of naxx40, pretty much as low effort as you can get.
---
Always TBC I guess.
---
Lol youre an idiot. I raided all content in retail WOTLK and multiple times through private servers. You sound like a fuckin moron
---
Whats leeway?
---
Disagreement: when I'm level 15 or 20+, I still want to be able to attend to the business of toons, friends or strangers, at lower level. A similar solution that I think I would agree with, is to simply limit layering to the early non-contested zones, i e Durotar and The Barrens, and not have it at all in, for instance, Hillsbrad Foothills. The problem that could appear, of course, with both of our ideas, is that we may have a massive influx of players especially in the early PvP zones. Would be fun!
---
Probably yeah, but OPs solution wouldnt even work, thats not layering, thats sharding.
---
I mean it's all predictions at this point but my forecast is that you've got a bigger market of gamers and many younger gamers getting sick of brs. They see classic on twitch and try it out. Most people who are new and tried the stress test seem to be enjoying it. My prediction is a classic renaissance... once again all conjecture. If this does happen, layering will be sold as the "necessary evil" to keep queues down. It's a rock and a hard place because we don't want empty servers but we don't want layering forever. Hopefully if the demand is there they open more servers and don't just BL us with layering forever.
---
There has always been private servers running the same patch of Retail servers.  
---
Why would Classic be any different?
---
whoosh
---
lol
---
They will up the cap soon to 50 more than likely so they can test out more content and with that it'll bring back a few players in the beta. People honestly just don't want to get burnt out on a beta when the real thing is around the corner.
---
Was it a paladin who ganked Soda? If so, well done.
---
Half of why I killed the meters in TBC I'm pretty sure was having 2GB of RAM and a comparable video card.
---
Doesn't matter what you're looking to do with your warlock, all you need to know is once you get your succubus you never use any other pet. Its kinda self explanatory.
---
Don't take what you read here as a reflection of what the general playerbase will do, only a small fraction of players are on here and an even smaller, more hardcore fraction are actually making posts/comments
---
Yikes
---
I'm not saying that they shouldn't have tried to keep their money train going. Fans wanted more WOW, they gave them more WOW. Everything after Wrath was basically beating a dead horse though.
---
CATA was maybe the last expansion that had some real old-WOWness to it but MOP and everything past it was definitely just a milking party.
---
Honestly it's not surprise that retail is so much worse than the original game. I'm not saying it makes Blizzard look bad, but maintain and updating a game like this with regular content and fixes and XPACS that are new and exciting is just par for the course.
---
Sooner or later the game you now have looks nothing like the game you originally made. You either do that or you eventually lock the game in an eternal time capsule and eventually bleed off players who get bored of repeating the same content over and over.
---
I'm not saying that's bad on Blizzard, and they definitely held the title of top MMO dog longer than anyone else, but they were also unable to stop their quality from taking a massive dip.
---
Hopefully the renewed excitement for classic will reinvigorate their team.
---
New sounds are better.
---
Thats gay fam
---
&gt;Personally I don't know nor have I seen anyone with this opinion.   
---
You are either lying, new to WoW subs or blind.
---
I disabled my 4 addons and still had the slow-down. These addons were UMatrix, HTTPS Everywhere, Ublock Origin and ViolentMonkey.
---
Then i tried restarting firefox in safe mode and then it was fast again. So I can say that atleast it's not caused by my addons. No clue what's breaking it but my 8core R7 1700 was jumping from 2%-98% usage and ram usage jumping to 8gb for the single firefox tab too. It was unusable.
---
This video (which is the most recent I can find) uses wow realm population numbers to estimate two million active CHARACTERS for both US and EU realms. Not accounts. Not players. Active in-game characters. 
---

---
You can interpolate how many of that 2M are just alts.
---
Well considering a resisted SW:P or MB is a 100% damage reduction for that ability, yeah, shadow focus is pretty fucking good.  Winding up a MB and mashing SW:P so you apply the dot as your cast finishes and getting a double resist isn't particularly *uncommon* in Vanilla.  Pushing those resists off the table with hit from talents is absolutely amazing.  Theres a reason why in raiding your first priority in gearing is to cap your hit against bosses, as its the largest DPS increase you can give yourself, to never miss/resist.
---
While you're leveling, 99.9% of the mobs you attack 1-60 are stunnable.  Blackout will prevent you from taking damage, allow you to cast more smites, throw an extra MB before the mob reaches you, etc.  Blackout is totally optional, but if you're going shadow with wand spec, its not a bad pick up to unlock later shadow tiers.
---
Going 5/5 wand spec then the rest in shadow, with shadowform at 45 is a perfectly fine leveling spec.
---
So, if a problem is hard or controversial, you'd rather it not be tackled at all. Got it. We can all fight over limited resources on Earth instead of reaching for the heavens. 
---
I may still be missing something, or the problem too big, but I'd rather see people being constructive about how to resolve things to the maximum satisfaction of the most parties involved instead of just complaining.
---
And the Hunter is feigned waiting for the party to wipe.
---
Well if you are going to wait a few weeks there shouldn't be a huge problem of over population in the starter zones.
---
Glad you figured out a solution all  on your own.
---
If thats the case then why should they fix it in classic if it was bugged in vanilla
---
Implying that within 5 minutes of launch, this kind of thing will already be established. Hell no. It's going to take weeks before communities naturally settle. By this point, people will already be stuck with lv 40s in a server that turned out to become a foreign language server.
---
The creaking is there in classic as well. The only difference is the impact sound, which also appears to cut off the sound of the arrow being shot.
---
I play private servers and will pay 15$. Worth it to not lose my characters and have less bugs. Also, 15$ is like, really not a lot of money... If you're out of high school anyway
---
these dungeons did more dps vs players in pre-2.3 bc.  
---
My current thinking is they are using a reference database from either wotlk or 2.3/2.4 bc (or later) for tuning dungeons/elites.
---
Corroborated by this video from actual Vanilla: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEGwsKAaFVw
---
It's a little tough because of other sounds going on, but there are several brief moments where the only activity is an auto-shot, and there's no accompanying hit sound.
---
However, abilities (such as Concussive Shot) definitely have sounds when they hit.
---
&gt; So, if a problem is hard or controversial, you'd rather it not be tackled at all. \\
---
No, I'd just rather it be handled by people that actually have knowledge of the situation
---
well one possible problem with that, what if the "1.12 reference client" were to be demonstrably wrong about some things?
---
Bye.
---
I haven't even found a guild yet,bi just know I'm gonna be a undead holy priest
---
&gt; Show me any evidence that layering by level isn't possible.
---
I have no burden to do so, I never made the claim "this is what blizzard should do." In a perfect world, having layering stop at some arbitrary number like 30 does seem to make more sense, but I have no reason to believe this will happen before launch. You're the one so *passionately* arguing for a mechanic that we have no reason to believe is even possible. 
---
Layering is by continent, why does anyone think they will suddenly be able to change how their technology works? If they could, why does anyone believe they wouldnt have *already done that*. I guess the random posters here are just *that much smarter* than people who are literally paid to do this. By all means, I hope they can further develop the technology, but I've also been in the corporate world long enough to know that "just throw more resources at it" isn't how the world works.
---
somebody less lazy than me should copy paste all the fixes they've ALREADY made to classic beta so you'll stfu
---
You know removing it in beta means it doesnt get tested and fixed, right?
---
Implying that English is even a majority language in Europe.
---
Hint. It isn't.
---
Damn well aside from all the ‚Äúabandon all hope ye who enter here‚Äù
---
I‚Äôm still going to hold on to my hope filled side, i‚Äôd Use those 28 days of play on the current game but it‚Äôs just so lame XD.
---
Well if anyone manages to get a new one flag this post otherwise, Un freeze me August 26th
---
Can confirm this used to work. I did it all the time. If a friend wasn‚Äôt online I‚Äôd just offer to tip anyone who‚Äôd group with me for 2 minutes and I‚Äôd get a response almost right away.
---
Is it Assburgers?
---
&gt;dvisers who are qualified to handle the areas that they've been assigned.
---
Listen to the yes men.

---
Bit like my Entire WoW experience.
---
Definately roll gnome for expansive mind and also escape artist.
---
Leveling to 60 will take you at least 5 days played, more likely 10+ if you aren't speed leveling. You won't be doing much pvp on your way to 60, so go for dps instead of survivability to reduce that time.
---
No pvp spec in the world is gonna save you from high level gankers or being outnumbered or getting attack mid combat etc.
---
My memories on leveling to 60 on a pvp server weren't frustrating in any way. Half of the people is probably ignoring you, because they wan't to hit 60 fast.
---
Inviting streamers onto the beta realm is the best move they could possibly make. One big streamer playing the game and thousands of people all watching means you can find a lot more bugs. If I was playing and I miss something that was a bug, then I've missed it. If a streamer misses it then a hundred people in chat will go "what the fuck was that" and it gets reported. Imagine how much less known the layering issues would be if we didn't have massive streamers layering back and forth between all the shit that goes on around them
---
Don‚Äôt fall into temptation with your ‚ÄúSilver Hand‚Äù.........:)
---
After debuff slots were increased so affliction locks were viable.
---
Thought it was August 27th
---
If layering didnt exist, OP wouldnt be on that server. They'd be on another one with no people. And then maybe it would be a dead server in 4 months.
---
But yea man that scenario totally doesnt hurt the game.
---
Might be faster. Definitely more boring.
---
Missing MOP, which kinda ruins your thought process as that would make WOD "A" Legion "B" and BFA "A"
---
Every time leveled a NE in Vanilla, I made sure to stay in their zones through lvl 14 at least, before going to Westfall and preparing for Deadmines.
---
It‚Äôs also advantageous to run to pick up as many of the flight paths as possible before crossing to the Wetlands. You can get a bunch of them, picking up XP along the way. You will be glad you took the time later, when you return to Kalimdor to quest at higher levels. Just keep your hearthstone on Darkshore so you can hearth back and catch the boat.
---
That's been the case for a long time now, it was a nightmare to try to moderate. It hasn't really been a big deal for the big two RP servers on NA.
---
Yeah, an unfortunate part of classic
---
&gt;Personally I'm worried that everyone is just going to be obsessively min/maxing so hard and racing to endgame content that people aren't going to socialize the way they did in the old days.
---
Using OSRS as a model, early on the community will likely be split by min/maxers (minority) and people there for the journey. Depending on how they approach further development, community involvement will likely be defined by QOL updates and content releases.
---
OSRS used to be very community driven until most typical end-game content became trivialised but powercreep and ultimately was more efficient to do everything solo, with only hyper-late game events that only a very small amount of the playerbase saw actually required multiple people.
---
This is fine if you don't have guildmates also rushing to 60. If you do, dungeons can speed up your time quite a bit.
---
&gt; If they could, why does anyone believe they wouldnt have already done that.
---
Ah yeah, I forgot Blizzard always make the correct decision. BFA is a great example of that, you got me.
---
Damn, you've found the solution
---
Don't use Adblock Plus, they take money from advertisers to let "safe" ads through.  
---
Use uBlock Origin, it's lower CPU load and also serves as a malware blocker.
---
Also, disable Subreddit CSS.
---
While I don't disagree from an exposure perspective, you want to know an even better way to get people to find and report bugs?  This is really goofy and out there, I know, but hear me out.
---
You let more people into the beta.
---
LOL Luckily it's time for work so I don't have to look at that bnet "play" button!
---
Yeah imagine having hours of leveling shoved under the table for when its actually released. There are reasons more than just disinterest for not playing. The problem that is existing being that they're playing characters that they'd play when it launches. Instead, they should be playing something they'd never play making it refreshing when they play Classic on launch. 
---
For the recent stress test I played a Priest and I have 0 interest in a priest and I had a blast wanding shit to death and healing. When I realistically wanna play a warlock.
---
I don't RP on wow i would rather play DND, but i hope the best for the community TBH because i know a lot of people love playing RP servers. So i hope they give the community a pvp and pve server.
---
Just saw a post the other day saying you could get to 60 in about 5-6 days played using only dungeons.  You need a competent group of 5 ppl though.  However, you could potentially  save a lot of time from grinding gear at 60 too.
---
Interesting but pointless if you don't know how to replicate it.
---
With a random group? Absolutely. With a guild group of good players? Probably quickest 3/4 a level you can do is a fast dungeon run with all quests.
---
Because Hollywood is what we all aspire for.
---
Sounds hypocritical from someone trying to discuss how Layering could or should work in game, but okay. 
---
I'd rather the consumers who will be affected by a system have input on its development, especially by communicating to those with more knowledge of the system what the desires and acceptable compromises of the community are.
---
No don't i am the only priest classic needs
---
Oh I agree. Things need to be brought up and stuck with. However, the people who are so negative and think the sky is falling because of a bug really wear me out.
---
That's a pretty fucking stupid thing to say, because there is no such thing as a retail subscription. There's only World of Warcraft subscriptions, which are valid for both retail and classic.
---
Well, he was talking about BWL, not MC, so that point is just you jousting at windmills.  Furthermore, the level difference doesn't really matter it only matters where along the power curve those levels fall.  For example, a game like WoW, each expansion has resulted in far more than doubling an individual players power, so the curve generally grows exponentially, but in a game like Diablo 2, each level adds less power than previous levels, so you do continue to get stronger when you go from 90 to 91, but your power doesn't grow as much as it does from 30 to 31, or what would be a logarithmic growth.
---
So basically, Blizzard could have ultimately done whatever they wanted, they could have left mechanics alone that required more than one person, they could have had enemies scale with you or you scale down, they could have scaled your character more slowly, they could have fully remade every instance, etc.  What they chose to do is invalidate all previous content between expansions, which led to each patch invalidating the previous one.  The path they've chose is the laziest approach, offers the least in terms of game play, and have severely harmed their game.
---
There really isn't a difference between layering and sharding outside of the scale and layering trying ever so slightly harder to keep you on your current layer.
---
And do explain to me how it cannot work. As all it would take is just a trigger that says "Player reached level 20, move layer". Maybe if you wanna be kind to them make them switch the next time they get into a town/inn/log out. After that just ensure that if you party up with someone 20+ you get put into their layer, not the other way around.
---
There's some other minor issues like the potential for the 20+ layer to be overloaded, but Blizzard would have to seriously overstack a server for that to happen. Most people won't hit 20 all that fast and the initial rush will have died down by then. And frankly, you could just opt to level an alt at 1-19 if you do not wish to wait in queue at that stage.
---
The damage IS supposed to come earlier, and the slow comes later. It's a spell delay system that existed in vanilla/tbc at least.
---
A lot of private servers get this wrong so people started to think that spells are supposed to be doing stuff instantly, but the delay is fully intentional.
---
[Evolve doing a lot of spell delay research](https://github.com/Evolvee/Spell-Delay-Research/issues/1)
---
[Example of Imp. Blizzard doing damage first, then applying the slow on the spell delay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8hQG5CnG5s&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=13) watch in slow-mo and you can see it clearly.
---
[Evolve's video for this mechanic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3l6OEo9Wzg) W &amp; FM got it wrong, NW got it right as is evidence by the retail footage
---
Yeah if you know people beforehand. Ive done full "guildie" run which turned into disaster. 
---
That is just risk I dont want to take. Fortunally as priest I dont need as much gear. Just wands from enchancing. I made greater magic wand at lvl14.
---
Great news. They seem to be hard at work.
---
You can not like BFA or the general design path its gone down, I certainly don't, however WOW is the most successful MMO of all time and it isn't even close, and it's still making the gap wider every year.
---
Having layering stop at a certain level isn't exactly a highly complex thought. I'm pretty confident the idea did not originate on reddit or a forum, considering there are quite a few people literally being paid to develop classic. Maybe it can be done and they are just hammering out the details (seems unlikely given the stress tests), maybe the technology doesn't make it feasible at all, but to be so arrogant to think that if you dont *zealously post about it* that blizzard might *make the wrong decision* would be hilarious if it wasnt so sad.
---
They also had insane HP for soaking big hits. I remember our DK having 36k in ulduar while the rest of us were sitting around mid to late 20s.
---
Battle for hillsbrad was always my favorite of his
---
&gt;I spent 2 weeks on BFA release gearing for the opening raids and before they came out they introduced Warfronts meaning every bit of gear you obtained prior was worthless - go do Warfronts sixteen times and hope. I had (IIRC) full 360-365 gear and Warfronts just gave everyone 370‚Äôs the following week.
---
What lmao warfronts released on the same day as Uldir and M+, not before them, nobody was grinding warfronts for gear. You got ONE 370 from your first completion then it rewarded 340 gear. You couldn't even be past 355 before Uldir and that was if you had max titanforged items in literally every slot. If you're gonna complain about something, at least get it right when you complain. The only people that were grinding warfront gear were people who were lazy in the dungeon weeks with gearing their alts to 340 or people that wanted the transmog
---
I agree partially. Alot of what makes current wow bad is the community and mentality in game. People changed the last 15 years and not always for the better. Seeing all these posts about streamers, layering, language, leeway, ... but mostly what kind of posts, shittalking, whining and crying made me realise alot of our 'modern mentality' is going to spill over in classic.
---
Which is fine, until you hit level 19.
---
Solo speedlevelers are never going to compete with groups that do it together.
---
Are you joking? I've got 512MB. It's gonna run so smooth...
---
Play whatever you want it really doesn't matter.
---
Dwarf are only super good for a couple fights, it's not like you get a giant advantage in all PvE by picking Dwarf.
---
I remember when I upgraded my laptop's ram to 1GB and didn't really notice any difference at all because I didn't know that adding more RAM would not give me higher framerate.
---
True but it's far easier to just ignore the inevitable oblivion all of our toons are doomed to face when it isn't going to happen in a matter of weeks.
---
&gt;it‚Äôs just a little silly to hate on a version of wow you aren‚Äôt forced to play at no point in time
---
Nobody is forcing you to play retail though?
---
and you think you will find constantly group who are at same lvl range, online same time and good composition?
---
All top speeds are done by people who solo quest instead groups who did dungeons.
---
What class were you playing? 
---
I gotta say, I feel like your class matters a huge amount. as DPS, I often feel like there's not much I can do to avoid a wipe, but as a tank, I feel like it's almost impossible for the group to cause a wipe. 
---
I haven't really felt like cc is needed on any fight, unless the tank stands still while stuff patrols into you, or underleveled melee run in and aggro too much stuff.
---
I do agree with your other points. I feel like if you aren't AOEing, you aren't really competing in terms of exp per hour, and with random pugs, it's much safer just to chain pull 1-2 mobs at a time and perpetually single target stuff down so they can't screw everything up.
---
This is how they trap you!
---
Can we remove yer face instead?
---
I won't say the bad word but there is a massive population of people trying out classic.... just not on the beta servers
---
holy shit... this can't be real
---
&gt; and you think you will find constantly group who are at same lvl range, online same time and good composition?
---
I know it. We've even recruited support staff that will be continuously tanking and healing relevant dungeons even after they offer no XP for them.
---
&gt; All top speeds are done by people who solo quest instead groups who did dungeons.
---
12 years ago, sure. Not anymore. Joana's record is going to get obliterated.
---
I really can't believe I never found the rest of his stuff basically yesterday, I'll check that one out first!
---
Yes at lvl 45. Or even 40 if you wanted to go shadowform. My whole point though is pre-40 where going full shadow is not ideal. Like I said Blackout is fine, a lifesaver in PvP, I‚Äôm definitely grabbing it on a high pop PvP server. 
---
Most of Priest lvling dps is wand. Not SWP and certainly not mind blast. As opposed to lvl 60 dps where you SWP, mind flay and mind blast on cooldown. Don‚Äôt you think that‚Äôs a significant difference in spells casted per mob? 2 vs continuous casting. That‚Äôs why you want to cap hit for a caster. And that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs simply not as important for lvling as a priest, you‚Äôre not continuously casting. 
---
But maybe you‚Äôre right, maybe the hit chance on the spells you do cast is decently important. Why I‚Äôve liked lvling a priest is that there is no cookie cutter build outside of spirit tap+wand. It leaves you plenty of room to gear your lvling process to how you want to play.
---
All need to be removed*
---
Now we just say ‚Äònice‚Äô into clan chat every few minutes and run by 99% of players.
---
People just raid with the same small group of people. Etc
---
Priest healer.
---
I can do fine. Problem is dumb wipes eather because lack of dps / extra pulls or other stuff.
---
Actually on my dungeon toon I managed to clear most dungeons fine but sometimes when grp is absolute fail that is long run back. Also travel time to dungeon + horrible xp.
---
[This clip shows the damage of blizzard being done first, and the slow applies afterwards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8hQG5CnG5s&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=13)

Sure! I watch this one here and there, well-made. :)
---
(And yes, mage are OP)
---
In the 2nd example the positions were clear - look at the original video.
---
It mostly impacted load times. Had a friend of mine that had the bare minimum ram in WotLK and he avoided Dolaran at all cost because it took 5+ minutes to load anything.
---
Your name is ducksdonger... please gtfo hahahaha
---
doing dungeons for quests once with a solid group is fast xp
---
J.Allen Brack was correct afterall. Everyone starts crying when they realize that they actually don't want the proper mechanics of vanilla, they just want a private server copy but made by Blizzard.
---
It's one of my favourite things about this subreddit honestly, as a software engineer.
---
Ok where I can find guild like that?
---
Every person online 16h + 4 hour sleep. Constantly at my lvl range and have full composition every single time.
---
It hasnt even happened in beta or private servers. Wont happen now. This is not lfr RETAIL.
---
These fucking comments are all over the place, no one even knows what they are arguing about.
---
I really want to main undead mage in classic but I'm worried they will be so popular that I will have to compete for raid spots and loot. Is it worth rolling priest instead?
---
Okay but the guy taped to the ceiling is the real mvp in that pic
---
Remind me! 64 days
---
I already put in a weeks vacation for this. 2 days of the stress test convinced me a made the right choice!
---
We just want authentic vanilla. Not Legion scaled to level 60.
---
&gt; and it's still making the gap wider every year.
---
Not at all. WoW has been on a gigantic downwards trend for years now. To go from having 10 million active subs to what? 1 million now? being generous. 
---
OSRS, ESO, and FF14 are much closer in sub counts than we probably know.
---
&gt; but to be so arrogant to think that if you dont zealously post about it that blizzard might make the wrong decision 
---
I believe zealous posting (and playing) of private servers is what got us classic in the first place. I believe extensive testing and feedback is what has identified numerous discrepancies (and got them fixed). But sure, maybe if we're quiet blizzard can slowly turn classic into BFA which we've all come to know and love!
---
Yup, I recently played for 2 months and can only remember having maybe 3 conversations, mostly about efficiency/gear upgrades.
---
OSRS is a good model to use, but also gives some truth to the "You think you want it, but you don't" idea. QOL seems great but each step gets closer to removing what makes a game special.
---
Like others have said, if they polled LFD back in Wrath it's likely 75%+ would have voted for it. It's going to be interesting to see how Blizzard walks the line.
---
&gt; Ok where I can find guild like that?
---
There are several. Onslaught is one of them. But you've got to be willing to practice your routes from now until August 26th and show a sub 5 day /played to 60 (and then practice MC in greens) or don't bother applying.
---
"solid" group. Yeah if only. 
---
If you have retail guild and have experience from vanilla you are in good spot.
---
no French in there
---
Have you actually ever leveled a priest in Vanilla?  This shit is so nailed down over 15 years of people doing it.  Wand spec, spirit tap, then yeah, do what you want, but going 5/0/5 then dumping most of your points in shadow building down to shadowform is extremely common and efficient.
---
You literally MB/SW:P every mob you attack, then you wand it down.  Its about a 50/50 breakdown of wand to spell damage.  It isn't even about continuous casting, its the fact that you're *going* to cast at least 1, if not 2 spells on *every single mob* you kill on your way to 60.  Very few times will you wand something 100-0 after level 10, that would be just dumb once you have spirit tap and wand spec.
---
14 would be someone under 18. The federal minimum for someone 18+ is about 18.50
---
I mean, yeah I guess.
---
It would make more sense if there was no hit sound if you miss but hit sound when you...hit.
---
Because its continent based not per zone.. with approximately 2.5k in each layer what makes you assume they won‚Äôt be a clusterfuck?
---
Or are you convinced there will be a few hundred layers?
---
RemindMe! 64 days
---
They hunch.

BFA is dogshit.
---
Hey pserver guy, take your efficiency somewhere else!
---
They're a big contributor to openstack too, would only make sense that they use it.
---
It's true. And by the time you reach AQ/Naxx, you want to start bringing fewer and fewer rogues.
---
Everything has trade-offs. :)
---
Then maybe they need a chiropractorc.
---
It‚Äôs not about server capability. It‚Äôs about population in game.  Too many players and not enough mobs/herd and ore nodes, etc. 
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter if a server can handle 1k or 10k or 50k or 100k.  There is a limit to how many players can be in a given zone(s) and the game still be playable.
---
You mean in a couple years once theyve completed the release roadmap?
---
Theyre not gonna end it and let all those subs just go. They‚Äôll release tbc or start a new season on classic or do a classic remaster or something.

There are several things on that list that is incorrect tho so I'm not sure how serious it is
---
Did you do this on beta or Pserver? Because pserver dungeons are stupidly hard and definitely not worth it. But in the beta people are saying that dungeon leveling is worth it because of how fast the mobs die.
---
the real loot is the friends we made along the way

There is a hunter trainer in stormwind. Just keep your hearth in the nelf starting zone till you hit level 10 for the class quest. There‚Äôs also a hunter trainer in ironforge, so questing in the human zone isn‚Äôt bad.

Not sure where you got the idea there was no hunter trainer ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

This was my experience with Dalaran instead. I think I got solid 40+ FPS until then. Slideshow!
---
Depends where you live
---
And thats the one you use for 99% of content you do end game so honestly i don't get why LFG and LFR are brought up as this big bad boogie man.  The hard content still requires you to put together a proper team manually.  Just nowadays you have a tool that allows you to do it properly instead of spamming global channels on repeat.  The LFG and LFR content is basically just a way for uber casuals to see the story content and its fine that way.
---
More polished product... you do realize this is a closed beta right, not some fake beta that a developer releases after years of development? There's 2 months until release, chill ur tits.
---
I thought there was no changes? I remember they were equally hard in vanilla too.
---
But yeah even then going to skip it. Even if I succeed 90% fine that 10% will hurt me badly. Those graveyard runs are so long.
---
Maybe if Im with 10% top players I can maybe do Zul as it has many quests. Thats about it.

I‚Äôd say Classic Warrior comes closest to BFA survival hunter in terms of play style.

We have over 100 committed members already and know of 3 other guilds with similar plans and numbers, so if we're the 0.00001%, that means over 4 billion people will be playing WoW Classic.
---
Zero chance of that happening. Much closer to 0.1%.
---
I had problems in Vanilla with FD. I have 200ms+ ping to NA, so I think there's an issue where you could attack then FD, but serverside the attack completes after the FD so you stay in combat.  
---
Not 100% sure that's the cause but I have video of it occurring at least a couple times.
---
Fair
---
Not sure why everyone's so concerned with leveling as fast as possible. Maybe to beat the crowd so you're not competing with other players as much? 
---
I'm going to take my time and get as much done as possible. Going out of the way to level up all primary and secondary professions, exploring zones more (playing as horde for the first time for classic), grouping with strangers, doing every dungeon in the game and their respective quests, grind a bit of reputation, and doing other fun things along the way. I want to explore the content for my level and do as many quests as I can in hopes of stumbling upon  a really nice reward. 
---
Then once I'm 60 I'll be all set to start working on BiS gear and prepare for PvP/PvE!
---
Yes I‚Äôve leveled two priests, one to 54 in retail right before BC and another to 60 on a private server. Obviously no clue what I did on my retail guy, but with the private server I did not take full shadow focus. I think I went 2 or 3 points to fill in that row. But you are mistaken on MB+SWP every mob. There‚Äôs a few levels where wand simply does more damage than MB. And when dealing with mana, trying to continuously kill mobs, I would SWP+wand plenty of mobs rather than throw in a kind blast. Not saying it‚Äôs ideal but I think we can both agree on that shadow focus is not as important as spirit tap+wand
---
6. Risk of encountering players who are competent, but grossly under-geared. (Especially melee dps.)
---
&gt;Does anyone know if the logs in the middle of the map will block LOS?
---
They shouldn't. But with those kind of bugs being in, who knows.
---
Promoting actual physical violence over a video game.
---
Nice, dude.
---
Your first point is wild speculation, and my assertion that WOW is the most successful MMO of all time and continues to be has not been refuted. I understand why that would be hard for you to do, *because im right*. 
---
Your second point is literally nothing but strawmans, so have fun arguing against a nonexistent claim.
---
I can see why that would be frustrating. I feel like it's a lot easier to control a fight when you are the tank, and of course... priest is one of the least gear dependend classes in the game. You already are basically a zero downtime class. Your wand dps does not scale off of anything. Your spells do not have major coefficients. You have a reasonable health pool and armor from your buffs already. 
---
But as a warrior, I have yet to run into problems on numerous private server runs of early dungeons. DPS pulling, I have realized, is mostly a question of patience... all of that can be corrected by just upping the tempo. As long as you use your throwing knives to chain pull trash as they patrol away, you can keep the dps busy and prevent them from thinking they can pull minor stuff, and it takes a REAL idiot for the dps to pull the boss while you are waiting for the healer to get mana. 
---
I do agree, The other problems are real issues. But I think the whole wiping problem might be more healer problems than dungeon problems. If you are a tank, or even a melee dps, a lot of this stuff is avoidable.
---
More people are learning Irish on Duolingo than there are native Irish speakers.
---
I think darn has the least amount of quests awarding rep. Not positive though.
---
Don't do it, you will just be disappointed and left wanting classic that much more.
---
No beta access but I'll post it on the forums.
---
There's a difference between discussing one feature and laying out an entire deployment plan.
---
Props if you actually vote with your wallet, but there likely aren't going to be enough people doing so to make any kind of an impact.
---
It's not so bad once you get out of the starting zones. Still much better than Retail.
---
I dont get your point. Are you saying people should be happy to play on eu mixed servers, talking english?
---
We should have the choice of language. I would hate trade and general chats in a mixed server. Some french, german, spanish guild advertisement i dont understand. Wonderful.
---
So 99.9% who are not in those guilds shouldnt do it then. 
---
Grouping with randoms = Good chance to slaughter you xp gains.
---
Private server launches are not at all a reliable comparison for official Blizzard WoW Classic.
---
&gt;I dont tell people where im from
---
Too late
---
You're not alone
---
Really? When did they change it? I played Vanilla and I'm sure it wasn't that sound.
---
Night Elf zones are significantly faster than Human zones. Human zones are atrocious for fast leveling. They‚Äôre very populated and the quests are all spread out. 
---
There‚Äôs a Hunter trainer in Stormwind so you can level in Human zones if you want but it‚Äôs gonna be slow.
---
I made it to 11 and auberdine area was a fucking mess. Mobs were spawning so damn fast that you really couldnt progress in any of the quests. Funny how they have mobs respawn that quickly but not quest items you have to click on. I played classic stress-test and had 10x more fun. LOL
---
I'll be the friendly druid you can count on for basically anything. Need a Healer? Done. Need a Tank? Done. A flag runner? You bet. Need to enchant that shiny new epic? I got you covered.
---
I don't mind not being at the top of the charts if it means I can help and we get stuff done instead of waiting around for xyz
---
No thanks. I will take the layers and their "bugs" over a several hour queue time.
---

So you are going to be playing CS1.6 on the 26th? Less competition for quests... LETS GO!
---
Same here man, I've played my rogue since 2005 though so I'm going Forsaken Warlock. It's going to be a hard breakup, though.
---
ofc WoW is the most successful MMO of all time. Because of how good it was pre cata. 
---
You honestly believe the gap is getting wider each year between WoW and other MMOs? Have you been living under a rock or something? Are you in 2008?
---
Players like you truly are the reason why WoW is as shit as it is now. Ah daddy Blizzard you're always right, we'll just wait for you to get it right there's 2 months left. Oh daddy Blizzard it's ok you have a week to iron out any problems. Oh daddy Blizzard it's ok just make sure it's gone before phase 2 end :) Oh daddy Blizzard it's ok you're still the most popular MMO that must mean you're doing things right!
---
So far they haven't release the main part of the game. So hopefully they don't and everyone comes back for launch.
---
it wouldn't crash shit with serious hardware... nostralius had like 15k online in it's peak... I would rather have dynamic respawns than deal with phasing which is a total immersion breaker...
---
I don‚Äôt think joana‚Äôs record will get obliterated at launch.
---
In time sure. There are enough differences between classic and pservers that I think it will take a few runs before someone ‚Äúobliterates‚Äù Joana‚Äôs record.
---
Na, Classic dungeons are a joke. The tank can pull 5 elites and he‚Äôs barely taking any damage and the mobs die so fast. A lot of people are saying that dungeon leveling might be the meta in Classic and questing is slower.
---
After AQ 40 people will want more content, even the "no changes" people. 
---
I hope Blizz does what Jagex did with OSRS. Update the game but stay true to the core mechanics and things that make it what it is. And maybe even do player polls for once, but that's probably a long shot. 
---
I'd also like to see some class changes. Nothing major just some tweaking so some specs/talents and classes don't simply suck as bad.
---
Worse than the plague.
---
hard denial
---
&gt; wants Classic+
---
&gt; wants #NoChanges
---
You don't get both.
---
&gt; I raided NAXX in vanilla and we never developed this meta, world buffs were rare because we didn‚Äôt see the value in it at the time.
---
For your experience, sure. But for mine, we got realm first Vael ahead of guilds much larger and more successful than us specifically because of World Buffs. And we continued to use them for the next 18 months.
---
&gt; They could make it so you can only have one world buff and possibly even buffing some of the world buffs tailoring them to aspects of Attack, Defense, Healing given/received and Mobility. I would also argue to make some of the world buffs easier to get by still applying the buff to the raid group when the zone buff is on cool down
---
This is not at all #NoChanges
---
&gt; If changes mean only nerfs than I‚Äôm on the No Changes side but if changes mean developing the meta for deeper and more engaging systems than let‚Äôs get to work.
---
So you're not #NoChanges, you're for #ChangesIWant, which will always be contested and should be completely ignored by Blizzard.
---
You always want to open with a cheap shot unless the target is low HP then Ambush.
---
For Rupture 
---
Make sure to time the opener right before the server tick so the talented Cheap shot will only cost 20 energy instead of 40. 
---
If you are planning to bleed the character do one sinister strike and gouge right as the 4 sec stun ending. You should have 4-5 points depending on luck. Use rupture as soon as you can but don't autoatack so you can vanish since rupture will tick in 3 sec enough for you to get distance.
---
For evis 
---
Same opener except after cheap shot you would vanish cheap shot for an extra 2-3 points to get to 5. Cold blood Evis Blind.
---
Rinse and repeat.
---
Play with bugs and other BS or not play at all????
---
There's no need to layer or shard if the population of the server is high enough.
---
wow, congrats! i wish i had friends to play with too üò≠
---
Yeah I stopped for a myriad of reasons.
---
Density being higher killed the feel of an actual blizzlike server, add in pickpocket rewarding way more gold, respawns so fast that I couldn‚Äôt loot fast enough or get skins if I failed. Rep being so off. Even before any classic tests there were things that just screamed to me I was on a pserver, now it‚Äôs even more obvious. Just doesn‚Äôt seem worth it. 
---
I guess I could refine my route, just not sure if it‚Äôs really worth it... especially cause I am not planning on speed-running so what‚Äôs there to refine?
---
&gt; So 99.9% who are not in those guilds shouldnt do it then.
---
False. It just won't be *as good* and *as convenient* for them. Look at what happened on the Beta. The first 100 level 40's got there by grouping up.
---
Your advice boils down to "if you don't know how to make friends with skilled players, don't know how to recruit groups for common gain, and don't know how to lead a trip to the grocery store, then don't do dungeons."
---
Well they also made all the specs actually playable.
---
Black Label don‚Äôt even @ me
---
You're thinking of specs
---
I‚Äôd rather spend my time playing when it actually releases so that I don‚Äôt burn out and it still feels fresh.
---
true, but to OP‚Äôs point i don‚Äôt think anyone under the age of 18 has the freedom to move to canada
---
We all know layering is trash. I want a server to be a server.
---
Fair enough.  To be honest, I didn't know that.  I let my subscription lapse just before Legion, so I haven't looked at how things are being implemented since then.
---
ARCANITE REAPER... HOOOOOO!
---
Gotta love the legion/bfa client running 15 year old data
---
Your daddy issues aside, all you did was create another post full of strawman arguments. 
---
You should probably talk to someone, btw.
---
I would take that bet. We have at least one player in our guild that's been practicing day and night, on Pservers, on the Beta, and on every Stress Test, all to get his 1 to 60 in under 90 hours. And when he has the support staff in place with summoning alts all over the map, feeding him dungeons, gold, consumables, etc. He'll make it no problem.
---
You missed the whole point of the post. Assuming that the community cannot agree on the direction Classic should go is just defeatism.
---
gasp, private servers were *wrong*?
---
how can this be?!
---
And none layer at start, will risk people quiting at a low level cause of the over populated areas
---
Full tier 3, Atiesh, and about 30k+ gold by the end of it all. Of those only Atiesh may be the only tricky part and I‚Äôve given up on any shot at Scarab Lord but I might still try as I believe if I can do the fragments part quick or in line with a few others in the guild I can get my scepter around the same time as when the gong is rung (I really hope so).
---
I am in the same boat, I want to do all the quests and sort of build up my knowledge on the 30-60 zones but I have done them all in Vanillla / TBC / WOTLK several times before so my memory will be fuzzy but good enough. I wont be trying for server first or anything crazy like that. I am shooting for 8 days played so no need to really bother with these other servers I guess
---
Good post.  Which realm were you on?  One was heavily layered w/ no competition, and another was a big zerg for every luckless murloc.
---
FYI, the first level 10 in today's pserver launch was at 1hr 44 minutes.  I think it was on the horde side.  You were at level 10 in 5 hours in the classic stress test.  Dynamic spawning on pservers the biggest difference?
---
Maintenance is still in prime time tuesday nights, that's never changed and it's the reason literally nobody raids on tuesday nights in oce still
---
Heres my problem. I like the idea of playing alliance priest but i also hate dwarves.
---
I really hope they release TBC, one of my favs
---
We‚Äôll see. It seems they aren‚Äôt sure how they want to implement layering yet. Hopefully everyone who hated not seeing anyone leaves feedback for blizzard on the forum post along with what realm they were on (realm 3 *cough* *cough*).
---
&gt; Assuming that the community cannot agree on the direction Classic should go is just defeatism.
---
The community can't even agree on what the realms should be named. It's no defeatism, it's the truth.
---
Why are you going to look like this the day before release? If that‚Äôs the case I shutter to think what you‚Äôll look like when it‚Äôs actually out.
---
The willingness to dream big and work relatively blind? The desire to solve the entirety of a problem instead of only its beginning? Frustration of dealing with those who use the failure to address removal as reason to avoid discussing implentation at all? A touch of insanity? I'll cop to all of the above and a general enjoyment of the speculation, blind as it may be.
---
Well put it more simply. If Im not with at least top 15% of levelers then grouping is waste of time.
---
If they are willing sacrifice their gains for dungeon then I consider they know what to do and I can trust. Otherwise Im not going to risk sabotage of my progress.
---
My main was a warrior. I leveled prot and remained prot through most of vanilla except when I was doing the pvp grind to rank 11. The only changes I'm making will be leveling arms and skipping the pvp grind this time as I don't have as much free time now that I have kids.
---
You can literally do all of the above in retail to be fair.
---
Never heard people complain about world buffs. Most people were excited to get them. No idea why people are complaining now.
---
We just get to have a tiny regional population instead :(
---
I Mained a prot pally and raises with her through MC/Ony and some BWL, but leveled a priest to 60.  This was my first (and only) MMORPG so I still consider myself a noob to this day, but talking to my gamer husband it seems like I knew and did a lot better than I realized! (We didn‚Äôt know each other back then)
---
This time I‚Äôll be maining a shadow priest, and I‚Äôll swap to heals if I don‚Äôt get to be *the* shadow priest.  I‚Äôll probably level a mage too, as I want something with some cachet!
---
There‚Äôs so much more info and explanation on how things work now that I‚Äôll actially know what gear to go for and what quests to do, vs just finding it as I go along.
---
**In order of least to most available *Alliance* reputation:** Stormwind, Darnassus, Ironforge, Gnomer   
---
**In order of least to most available *Horde* reputation:** Orgimmar, Undercity, Thunder Bluff, Darkspear Trolls
---
They wont. On stress test even grouped the loot is round robined and its still bad drop rates for quest items.
---
/thread?
---
pet pathing and pet control were bitched about for years before many were fixed in Wrath. I played a Huntard main in vanilla so I am going to say working as intended to bring back that true hunter experience.
---
&gt;it wasn't a thing in the past stress tests or in the ongoing beta.
---
Wait what?
---
I think we all know that official forums are much too toxic to even think about posting something of this nature there.
---
That's my point, literally all of the above are some of my positive experiences in bfa before I unsubbed. Obviously there's a lot of bin shit in retail too but yea people here get kinda tunnel visioned into classic good retail bad mindset
---
Probably because people wanna play the game on release. 
---
You're really gonna sit there with a straight face and try and hype up classic wow as the greatest iteration of WoW and expect people to sit on their hands so they don't have yo wait to kill mobs?
---
That's asinine
---
They're pacing things to milk the greatest number of resubs out of the beta process that they can.
---
First wave was people re-subbing for a chance at an invite. That happened mid-May when the closed beta began.
---
Second wave was people re-subbing for access to the June stress test. That happened mid-June, and probably pulled in a lot of folks who were not tempted enough by a chance of a beta invite but who were willing to re-up for a guarantee of three days. Also, coincidentally, it was right when people in the first wave would have lapsed out from bitterness after re-subbing for a month with no invite.
---
Third wave logically would be an "all access" beta in mid-July that will be opened up to all active subs from then through the start of early access. That will pull in everyone who was not tempted enough to re-sub for a chance of a beta invite or for a mere three days of stress testing. Again, conveniently, it will be right around the time that subs would lapse out for those who might have been captured by earlier waves. This also would give them a very accurate gauge of the population they can expect on launch day, so they can revise their server provisioning and load tuning up or down to accommodate.
---
Doing it this way guarantees them between one and three months of extra subscription time leading into Classic launch from pretty much everyone who is tuned in to Classic, which should make a nice bullet point for the next earnings call. Some have resisted the first two incentives for early re-subs, but it's unlikely many will survive the third and final temptation. And it will guarantee plenty of fresh asses in chairs for the final phase of whatever testing they want to do.
---
As others have mentioned below, it's clear that the early waves of beta folks are burnt out by now grinding on characters at Vanilla speed, all while thinking more each day about how their work will be wiped away in a few weeks. Blizzard probably anticipated this and smartly decided to limit early beta access tightly so that the big crowds would not be burnt out and long gone in the final beta month when large numbers likely will be much more important for effective testing.

Great work, but give him a pose fit for an orc, standing tall and proud, and he needs to be bigger and more muscular.
---
Level 3-4 with 5hours. They must have been afk or something.
---
Usually what I do when I do the exploration route, is that I add bunch of random level 1's that are starting when I start. Then I can compare.
---
I did this on the last stress test. When I finished I was a level higher then the highest one on my list.
---
lol nice one, you got me! I'll go see someone, you should go see your middle school math teacher and get him to explain some concepts to you so you can learn about downwards trends and how it directly contradicts "making the gap wider every year".
---
I don't care either way - if layering stays I'll abuse it and dogshit players like yourself will later go onto the forums complaining how much further ahead I am than you.
---
&gt; my assertion that WOW is the most successful MMO of all time and continues to be has not been refuted. I understand why that would be hard for you to do, because im right.
---
How many items have you bought off the retail cash shop for daddy blizzard?
---
Do you think if we make changes to classic, the community will cry for more changes which kill the game?
---
Sharding/layering tech is the least of the reasons they had to backport. It has to work on their current servers, it has to be supported by modern client hardware, it has to have modern security standards and it has to work with modern battlenet. Using a new client with old models/data was the obvious choice.
---
You say self explanatory, but that's sort of what I'm looking for clarification on.  Most builds and others here have said go Void, how do you play with the Succubus? (PVE Questing)
---
Ah, I see. I'd argue that whether or not the language is taught in schools does not make as much of a difference as you'd think, though. At my job, my colleagues and I are required to communicate, both in written and spoken form, in English as well as in German. And - bless their hearts - quite a few of them somewhat suck arse at the former. Compare that to our Dutch neighbors, who are, on average, leagues ahead of us as far as that's concerned.
---
My brother actually has a theory about this that I really like. Since apparently, hardly any movies, TV shows and video games are dubbed in the Netherlands and instead are just subtitled, people are much more exposed to spoken English there, whereas in Germany, just about EVERYTHING is dubbed.
---
Mind you, this is all anecdotal, after all.
---
You said you lost 3 days /played by doing dungeons.
---
There are 17 or 16 leveling dungeons in the game, depending on your Faction.
---
That means it took you an average of 4 hours and 15 minutes per dungeon.
---
The problem is clearly not other people, it's you.
---
The mage gets ZG trinket, which increases critical damage of arcane spells.
---
How about just don't buy that shit and farm your own mats. 
---
You wanted to feel a sense of accomplishment right?
---
still got a CRT right besides my 1440p IPS. it's great for playing old console emulators (psx/n64) in native res, somewhere around 240p!
---
From my understanding, there are a lot of caster spots in a raid group, and only a few are for warlocks because they have great utility but sub par dps compares to mage. I don't think it will be difficult for you. 
---
Personnaly I'm going Rogue, which will also be very popular, I also considered Warrior, Warlock or Hunter, but I really want to play Rogue, and if it's hard to find a raid spot then so be it. I'd rather play the class I most want to play.
---
farm that karma like a boss
---
I have mained most classes. Usually something different each expansion. I have not mained a lock and was leaning that way. Also haven't mained a warrior so being a tank is always needed.
---
no, that is dumb.  stop whining about things you do not understand
---
When each spec plays like a different class it doesn't really matter
---
Vanilla had its fair share of toxicity, you may have just been lucky or have selective memory. Rampant racism, sexism and homophobia was pretty standard. On my server one of the best PvP-ers was Chinese, and the world chat was a cesspool of racist hate-fueled bile when he‚Äôd roll through. 
---
The pserver crowd has nothing on them, they really don‚Äôt seem all that different from the hardcore crowd who called anyone who disagreed with them ‚ÄúCasual‚Äù, bit use it as a noun.
---
‚ÄúLittle to almost zero‚Äù ?
---
I did some dungeons twice. Also please consider travel time + Wiping time + Picking up quests + Mob xp.
---
These were all random groups btw and not in new server but old one.
---
Yes. Because changes to Classic means the death of Classic by definition.
---
If you don't want to play Classic, that's fine, but do not try to turn it into something else for those of us that do.
---
I‚Äôd guess there‚Äôs more reasons, like fixing bugs in the modern client is far easier because it‚Äôs more familiar to the devs rather than code from 2004. Also having a client that‚Äôs already compatible with modern operating systems. 
---
Although some issues arise, I think it will lead to more stability for the client and server which will make leveling in the beginning more bearable and enjoyable.
---
everyone was bitching they can't kill anything. this was the main zerg
---
#15
---
How invested can anyone be to a character that's going to be gone in a few months?  It's crazy it got the amount of hype it did.
---
Dude.... its a beta ofc stuff will be wrong. Let blizz do their jobs and fix it, instead of wining on the subreddit
---
Almost seems to me they are pull at the seams to make it fail, so then they can say, see they didn't want classic wow.
---
The idea that a gigantic portion of people rolling Warrior will just give up because the leveling is relatively a bit more painstaking than every other class is oversensationalized. Surveys show that most people rolling classic wow are are either vanilla veterans or played private servers, or both, people know what they are getting in to.
---
Then wait until p2, you're sure there won't be layering then. To me, not playing at all is worse than playing with layering at launch. Now, this inn solution is great.
---
Not to mention layering was invented for classic
---
never said they were right either
---
Gasp, i like putting words in people mouth and look stupid!
---
It‚Äôs a PP. Not ingame
---
that's layering....
---
I played an Alliance Prot Warrior in Vanilla but will be playing a Undead Shadow Priest in Classic. Might be worth noting that I've never actually played Priest in any expansions or current retail.
---
"If you don't want to play Classic" I absolutely want to play classic, and i want to play it with No changes if changes would kill the game. Is it wrong to dream of a Classic + made with the spirit of classic?
---
That's why you Imp SS fish with R4 Shadowbolt.
---
You still haven't refuted anything, btw. Not sure if you just keep forgetting in between you sucking your own thumb. 
---
Searched "most successful MMO of all time" and got this:
---
https://twinfinite.net/2018/05/most-popular-mmorpgs/12/
---
I checked a few other links, same result. WoW can simultaneously be losing subs and still be making the gap wider between other MMOs, but I guess you just don't understand that? WoW has been at the top for *15 years*, it will be unlikely that any other MMO will match its' success. 
---
&gt; How many items have you bought off the retail cash shop for daddy blizzard?
---
$0, not that it matters? If I cared about the flare/mounts I would probably buy them. I'd be totally okay with supporting the *game I am playing*.
---
Even if you've been perma banned several times from the previous forums? Asking for a friend...
---
&gt;  Those certain 
---
what in the fuck are you talking about?  Grouping solves this problem, and you are not likely talking to ppl outside your layer for anything.
---
They should get rid of that and the spellbatching. Screw the no changes shit, the game has to be playable.
---
The bug report function was under main menu in stress test. Just wasn't a pop out like in Beta.
---
Me too
---
It's the difference between useful feedback and noise. Unfortunately it looks like your ego's too big to understand that difference.
---
I lived it
---
Literally and figuratively
---
Gotta find something to fill the gap between all the layering and streamer threads.
---
Go to woweconomy and you will find a subsection of people who play the game differently from yourself. 
---
Crazy right?
---
Ah, great research - the irrefutable twinfinite.net who posted an article in 2018 about popularity (when blizzard haven't been announcing sub numbers for a significant amount of time)
---
I literally agreed that WoW is the most successful MMO of all time because of how good it WAS not how good it is NOW. I'll just assume you have short term memory loss or something.
---
If WoW was still the absolute best MMO why is classic being demanded so heavily? By your logic and repeated statements the game is still so amazing that we should all be playing it and not be waiting for classic.
---
Yea that is exactly what i‚Äôm saying and only retail babies feel that is wrong..
---
&gt;the circlejerk in here is fucking crazy
---
The circlejerk in every thread is crazy. Complaining about the circlejerk doesn't make it any better.
---
this is some ass-backwards ageism at play right here
---
I love these long articulate posts that basically amount to nothing in the end. You're speculating in an attempt to make Blizzard the bad guy. They are literally running the classic client through an interface that allows the newer engine to understand the 1.12 client. That's why it seems like a backport. Simply rebooting all the long outdated software for classic is impossible. it simply wouldn't work. They would have to nearly rebuild the whole thing (which they've been doing for 13 years. IE: the Legion version of the engine).
---
&gt; I did some dungeons twice.
---
Never repeat a dungeon unless it offers a greater XP per hour than solo play at that level and only if you can retain the group.
---
&gt; Also please consider travel time + Picking up quests
---
This doesn't double the time for a dungeon. But fine, I'll knock off half an hour to gather quests and half an hour to travel.
---
&gt;  Mob xp
---
Has no bearing on the time required to complete a dungeon.
---
So even if you did 25 dungeon completions of the 17 dungeons and took 30 minutes to gather quests and get to the dungeon plus had 45 minutes of wiping, that means it took you an average of 2 hours and 2 minutes per dungeon.
---
Still fucking embarrassing.
---
the blizzard gaming community could be classified as a smart unlearning AI so ye having skilled friends is good
---
Exactly! It‚Äôs going to water down the gameplay and get rid of awesome placement perfect plays
---
This is the way of the Rogue.
---
Unfortunately I believe there's more people that didn't actually play Vanilla voicing their opinions than the core fanbase. There's so many people blindly defending layering and acting like it isn't a detriment to the social dynamic of the game its sad.
---
[https://discord.gg/](https://discord.gg/)   This is a Classic wow Rogue discord. you can learn alot here.
---
I mean this is why you are testing the game for them. They said it wasn‚Äôt an exact copy and that it was going to have a lot of bugs. It‚Äôs your job to find them. It‚Äôs their job to fix them. Don‚Äôt act like they are purposely leaving in bugs when we have seen them acknowledge them and change them.
---
Incorrect, 2.5-3K concurrent players..... some server pops went up to like 25K
---
Don't think you can compare an unassisted run like Joana's to a circlejerk of helpers carrying you the whole way.
---
Majority opinion is not agreement, not everyone will ever be happy with any given change.
---
As evidenced by the majority opinion being for #nochanges, with a few non-content sprinkles from some, and you being here with a laundry list.
---
I'd be fine with post Naxx content 2-4 years from now, but most people wouldn't trade classic for that and I wouldn't either if it meant replacement.
---
&gt; and i want to play it with No changes if changes would kill the game.
---
Then you want to play with No Changes at all, because every change you make kills the game for someone.
---
Based on a normalized experience scale, level 40 is less than halfway there
---
You explain the effect better than I can. I played classic to wrath and I feel the game has always been dumbing itself down. In my case, it needed to be dumbed down.
---
I didn't peak in WoW until late TBC to about midway through WotLK. The thing about the peak though is it's a steep drop off the other side as soon as things become too accessible.
---
For me it started with the patch that released Trial of the Crusader. 25 man ulduar badges started dropping in heroics. My guild had been raiding 10 man and trying to progress in 25 man ulduar for weeks and instantly people who ran heroics for a day had more badges than I had collected in 2 months. Icing on the cake was ToC was a yawn of a raid that was easily doable even as a guild who never beat Yogg in either 10 or 25 man. Next patch was dungeon finder and a couple months later I was out. Years of enjoyment gone with just 2 patches in which the game just got too accessible for me. I'm sure it happens to a lot of people at different times in their WoW life.
---
Well yeah, but I‚Äôm trying to keep it a bit more sugar coated for people who are resisting things that obviously need to be changed/removed 
---
All of these things WILL water down the experience of classic wow. And none of them are needed for a true vanilla like experience (maybe spell batching, I‚Äôm a little lost on how it all works or is suppose to work, all I know is it‚Äôs fucking up perfect interrupts and making blizzard useless)
---
Why should we uphold a record of some guy that refused to use any and every advantage available in the game?
---
You realize BFA and classic are *both* world of warcraft, right? You are literally making my point. Que your next mouth-breathing tirade of strawman arguments where you *still haven't successfully refuted anything*.
---
Why not? Seems legit, right?
---
No1 is yet to state how layering is game breaking so nah
---
It's a joke cause its a half naked women following you around. The og succubus model is alot more revealing than what it is now. https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/48pkpw/new_succubus_model_%CA%96/ shows a current model, and in the comments it shows the old model.
---
Nah.  I've been playing ESO while I wait, and am happy with the decision despite losing interest way back at launch.
---
Going through the dark brotherhood quest line as I level has been a lot of fun.
---
&gt;why do we need it now?
---
Because 60% of week 1 Classic players will be BFA/nostalgia tourists who will quit within the first 6 weeks. This is a massively different situation to 2004 launch where the population grew for 4 years straight.
---
this can be discussed in 2 years when everyone is done naxx for a while and theres literally nothing to do
---
u/uwutranslator
---
Ah, I see you're trolling. You got me good. You went a bit too retarded in that last comment though, I finally caught on.
---
ty cya
---
Ironically, somewhat yes. This is what I thought layering was going to be when it was announced, but it turns out layering is just sharding with a hat on.
---
In its current state, unchanged, we'll be looking back at layering as the bullet that killed classic. Mark my words.
---
We need Layering to ensure a smooth launch experience that prevents dead servers forced into mergers. It's that simple.
---
Not sure how that relates. If the server has a concurrent player cap why would it matter?
---
I told my wife I was thinking about doing it for prep...
---
Her response: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been playing this game for the last 15 years. I don‚Äôt think you need anymore ‚Äúprep‚Äù. You‚Äôre definitely prepped enough, if not you‚Äôll live.‚Äù
---
Just use Joana's guide. Even if it's your first time using it, if you have a second monitor it's pretty easy to understand and keep up at a above-the-pack pace. Sure you wont be mega blazing speeds since you still need to glance over and double check, but you'll be ahead of the pack.
---
Badass! Now that's a classic in the making
---
Level 20 is to high. I say cap it at level 10-12.
---
Most of the friends i would meet will be in the barrens after all!
---
I'm really feeling this, too. I wanna fuckin' play Classic, man.
---
I mean yeah there's private servers but I don't want to play on them since they're all going to shut down in 2 months, and...they're the same private servers I've been playing the past 4 years; I wanna play Classic because it's new and different in a sense.
---
Wololo!  The classic's are always better.
---
only about 600k last i read
---
It's classier when you just admit when you're wrong and stop acting like zoomer doing fortnite dances for likes on youtube.
---
A couple weeks? Do you mean a couple months?
---
"(This is not a bug, but a feature that was supposedly present during vanilla. Makes it much harder to kite melee classes)"
---
False.
---
Day one/week one 1-2 million ppl will attempt to log in. at 3K per server that is 330 to 660 servers on day one. Imagine trying to select from the list. After that 50-60% of ppl will leave so servers will be deserted. Am I missing anything?
---
The goal is a server with 3,000 players online at peak hours after the tourists leave. That's the best Vanilla experience.
---
If 60% of players are going to quit, that means every server needs to house at least 10,000 people at launch.
---
Without Layering, that means either a 7,000 long player queue (not an option) or ~1500+ players per starting zone (also not an option).
---
You literally post using twitch memes. You use twitch emotes outside of Twitch and I'm the zoomer? more irrefutable logic by the guy citing twinfinite :D
---
I'm gonna go ahead and make a pretty large, but safe, assumption now. You failed highschool?
---
Did you read what I said? RANDOMS! They were 100% random people. Retail players who are trying vanilla for very very first time.
---
With randoms there is no single dungeon you could gain more xp/hour doing it once or twice. I did dungeons for just to test as I already had toon who did it 100% solo. 
---
Mob xp does matter when you clear them super super slow.  I dont think you understand what random actually means. You are obviously in good guild and havent played with braindead in very long time.
---
A layer contains an entire server worth of players. Servers are going to have many layers. The queue would be like 8 hours so this is a non-solution.
---
Haha, I decided my goal is to hit every single horde-accessible dungeon on my first route to 60 :P. Some of my fondest memories were going deep into those dungeons! I figure it won't be terribly painful even with randos since I plan to run shaman.
---
There were a ton of servers for the vanilla WoW launch, and also saying "it worked" is a huge stretch. I already posted this somewhere else, but launch was a total shit show and the servers never really stayed up long enough for the starting zones to get really crowded. Later on the large number of servers led to other problems; as player numbers fell after the initial surge, many servers became ghost towns. This led to Blizzard adding free character transfers from high population servers, and later server merges. This brought a whole pile of other issues as launch server guilds with MC on farm transferred onto newer servers, factions became increasingly imbalanced, etc.
---
Classic is apparently going to launch with very few servers, and Blizzard is instead opting to use layering to handle the huge population concentrated on them. This affords them the ability to easily compensate for population falloff later by simply merging layers; no character transfers or server merges required. It's not without its own potential issues, but it's actually a very elegant solution to the problem.
---
I am having my ISP throttle my speeds down to 56k so I can relive the vanilla experience with a vanilla internet speeds. Busting out the CRT even downgrading my GPU... gonna be a blast man.
---
It's gamebreaking and it becomes more evident just HOW horrible the system is as the game progresses. Most people haven't played on patches with BWL+ Geared players, I can tell you that just ONE Extra Auto + 1 Ability is the difference from life and death everytime in PvP and MANY times in PvE Also. 
---
Leeway is a broken retail mechanic that must be removed ASAP
---
"Edit: love the no reply downvote from OP, really speaks to their interest in our thoughts." I did neither of those things.
---
That's like saying why should we uphold the record for 120 star when people run 16 star SM64 much faster lol.
---
They are completely different categories. The sheer audacity of comparing what one person did to what 40 people did for one person is hilarious.
---
&gt; They were 100% random people.
---
Then again, the problem is one of your own making. This is like someone complaining they couldn't get past the first two Molten Giants in MC because they just picked 39 random level 58+'s out a hat.
---
&gt; Either way have a great day :)))
---
Jesus, you're PISSED.
---
You keep calling me stupid and you have literally never refuted anything I have said with any logic, reason, source, anything. You're just flailing your arms around hoping to be right on the internet. Sorry man, it sounds like *you really need this*.

&gt;It worked back then, why do we need it now?

.. Because the amount of people logging in day 1 of vanilla was measured in the thousands, and this time it'll be measured in the millions.
---
Cmon.
---
How can we possibly tell if everything is actually 1.12 or not if we don't have the resources?
---
&gt;It‚Äôs your job to find them.

Oh yes I'm paying them $15/month and it is my job to do their job for them as well. LOL.

You aren't going to top the healer list nor the dps list, you have to decide what you want to do with your shaman and what is more important. Shamans are a support class.
---
That's a good point
---
Thank you for a real beta test and not just another example of why you personally don't like something.
---
"You mean we can make hundreds of thousands of dollars in server transfers?" - ActivisionBlizzard
---
It will be playable anyway. You're acting like a server being overcrowded for a few days is some sort of catastrophe, when in reality it's a mild inconvenience.
---
People don't understand that regardless of what class you play every NPC mob now hits you minimum of x2 with a snare maybe 3x. And every Player who uses melee now gets 2 hits instead of one. 
---
Now show me this in Vanilla? 
---
No.
---
But in reality use void walker. Hes your own tank and the void sac is great in so many situations.

Run the risk of a ban iirc. Also appears you can‚Äôt edit the models since cataclysm anyways.
---
No it isn't. The win condition is the same whether you have assistance or not: level 60 before anyone else with the shortest /played time. Your analogy doesn't equate because those are two different win conditions: defeat Bowser and save Princess Peach in the shortest amount of time versus collect all 120 stars.
---
So I should carry shitty group is what you are saying right? 
---
Funny thing is that I was geared as hell and still oom healing people who constantly pulled extra packs. There is 95% of time zero cc.
---
Also have you ever met leaver? Afker? People who disc? Had trouble finding new randoms who dont want to enter dungeon because 1 boss already dead? Have you experienced respawns?
---
The video I wat had about had a silly scenario show casing a guy running into a rock and a tauren strafing side to side.
---
I understand the point of the video but what you are seeing is not typical

I log into the Beta Server like once a day and check the AH for Wands and then log straight back out.

Glad to know all you have left to resort to are personal attacks.

Again, thanks for your initial constructive criticism.
---
Yes you're correct they are from the 8.X. state what I'm confused on is why the Melee Leeway hasn't been fixed yet with all of the information on it yet. Hopefully with this AOE fix we will see it soon. I didn't see any patch notes for this fix so I'm wondering if Melee Leeway will be the same
---
The name reminds me not to sugar coat it. I call it how I see it..
---
Should be zone based instead of level based so a lvl 19 could play with his lvl 21 friend still. 
---
Ideal solution would be:
---
-lvl 1-20 zones (and cities) are allowed to have multiple layers
---
-lvl 20-60 zones are the actual realm and don't ever split into layers
---
-If they wanted to failsafe this for streamer servers make each 20-60 zone its own layer (sharding pretty much) and make the layer cap super high so it wouldn't overpour unless it were like thousands in stv from a streamer raid
---
-Keep their normal plan of dropping the layers after a few weeks
---
I think this would be the best solution as you are getting all the benefits of layering while minimizing the exploits/pvp issues of the higher levels. Only downside would be split community and 1-20 but it's much better than what we have now.
---
The win condition is the same: defeat bowser and save peach, just the method of how you do it changes.
---
I'm not saying it won't be the fastest, I'm just saying don't compare it to Joana, because they aren't similar at all. Doing it faster as a group won't suddenly invalidate his run, which obviously means they aren't the same. 
---
His record isn't going to go anywhere because a bunch of poopsockers do it faster.
---
I got my manual in my closet. In it's box where it's supposed to be!
---
I bet he watches streamers in there while he's naked.
---
No, I'm saying that you don't understand how to game the social aspect of WoW.
---
If your goal is leveling quickly, you should do dungeons. Part of doing dungeons is knowing how to find a solid group at any moment and leading the group through a successful run. You just don't know how to do either of those things, so you routinely failed.
---
They need to massively over-populate the servers on launch day in order to prevent them becoming ghost towns 2 weeks later when all the tourists leave. Private server numbers are lower than the number of concurrent launch day players blizzard will be aiming for, not higher. I'd be surprised at anything lower than 30k players per server at launch.
---
Leeway hurts everyone but of course is a buff to Melee, don't be blind to think though that other Melee hit you more while kiting...It's not helpful for anyone...
---
A PP...? A powerpoint?
---
&gt; it‚Äôs reasonable to expect NA will be getting 1 PVP, 1 PVE, and 1 RP for each coast.
---
Unless NA grew itself some more coasts since last I checked this is a very pessimistic estimate. It assumes a mere 36k _max_ concurrent users in NA + EU, if every single realm is maxed out in capacity. Nostalrius alone boasted more than a third of that during peak hours, and Blizzard's "launch stress test" earlier this week, which was only open to retail subscribers, had ten realms.
---
Cry more kid. Nobody gives a shit you arent gonna be able to manipulate the market yourself.
---
How far will a falling star take me?!
---
Yea, i haven't voted up or down on anyone's comment. I'm getting down voted with little substantial reasoning. Only hot takes. I get that people want the original classic which no changes for the real classic experience. Blizzard refused to do that. Part of me hopes that they can continue the changes they are making to nurture the classic experience but like with retail they are going to nerf united aspects of classic killing the game for everyone. If the "No Changes" crowd cannot come up with a methodology and clear message to blizzard that blizzard will understand. Everyone will lose because billiard is already set on not delivering "No changes"
---
Yea that must be it Ive used it as an alliance character
---
Nobody is asking to have it removed. We just want it toned down a bit because currently it‚Äôs stupid from how far away people can hit you.
---
Get rid of the incorrect extra leeway

Get rid of the incorrect leeway
---
Get rid of leeway
---
Internet telephone game, people know there was supposed to be a smidge of leeway and so does the features bluepost.
---
I havent ever played in brand new server so I dont have experience playing with capable people. 
---
I started in private where all retail folks are. What I can do? I have been in every dungeon and I communicate most and even mark mobs.
---
All I can do is add people in my friendlist and notice that they are never online or Im 10 levels ahead of them because of my questing speed. I had plenty nice runs. 
---
But what if you meet afker? Person who leaves because he can only play 1 hour? When you are middle of nowhere and try to get 1 person in mid of dungeon run where you have boss downed and have no lock?
---
Im giving you several examples how dungeon run can go easily shit with RANDOMS.
---
Make lots of gold
---
Well, first, you're wrong. Even Joana believes his record is going to get smashed on Classic launch. He's said so many times on his stream.
---
And second, your analogy is still wrong. To be considered as a record holder for SM120, you have to collect all the stars. It's not just about defeating Bowser. 
---
The same is not true for Realm First 60 or lowest /played to 60. There are only 60 stars to collect there and EVERYONE going for the record must collect them to win. None are optional. 
---
What you're trying to say is that by refusing assistance, Joana somehow collected extra stars, putting his record in a separate class. This is your opinion and it's not really shared by anyone. His record stands because he collected 60 stars on a new realm faster than anyone else. When someone does that faster than him, no one is going to care about how they did it so long as it wasn't an exploit.
---
At this point it‚Äôs pretty evident that Classic won‚Äôt be a carbon copy of Vanilla and there‚Äôs nothing we can do about it.
---
Not going to lie, I was hook/line/sinker about their logic regarding avoiding 1.12 bugs/exploits, but now that I've seen how the beta is going and experienced the god awful pain of trying to manage a pet in the beta, I think it would have been easier to fix 1.12 than to try to fix Legion.  
---
I think we have more information about what bugs and exploits are present in patch 1.12 than we do about what cancer has infected Classic from Legion.  
---
We are seeing TONS of Legion-esque behavior seeping in to the game. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. I can't imagine how many other things are leaking in from the later client.  
---
So far we've seen two huge and hard-to-see aspects of the game from Legion infecting the client: AI behavior and combat data.  
---
Those two things aren't often noticed by the layperson. It takes dedicated theory crafters to notice something like that, as we've seen demonstrated already.  
---
If anything, Blizzard should open a bug bounty at 1 month game time a pop + cancel the beta fee cost of anyone who submits a verified bug relating to high impact issues such as combat data, AI behavior, creature values, etc.
---
You right.  No debt other than a home mortgage.  Preferably a 15 year.  Definitely with 20 percent down.
---
Anyone believing blizz is doing this out of good faith is stupid, this is a cash grab to fund asian mobile development.
---
Imagine having the playerbase become detectives when you have a perfect running 1.12 reference client(so they say)
---
Just calling a spade a spade
---
Never saw or heard that one, it‚Äôs actually funny! Not like that ‚Äúworld of Warcraft that you play‚Äù garbage. Thanks for sharing this
---
You realize the vast majority of "the pack" will be using Joanas guide as well right? It's ridiculously popular.
---
Best advice if you want to avoid the pack is to avoid Joanas guide all together. Unless you log in first and can consistently stay ahead of everyone.
---
Thats funny, I absolutely love this and I am seriously hoping this doesn't change. It almost gives the bow more weight. I find it SUPER immersive in all honesty.
---
Who knows? Maybe you guys think i'm a idiot.
---
&gt; Well, first, you're wrong. Even Joana believes his record is going to get smashed on Classic launch. He's said so many times on his stream.
---
Never said it wouldn't.
---
&gt;What you're trying to say is that by refusing assistance, Joana somehow collected extra stars, putting his record in a separate class. This is your opinion and it's not really shared by anyone. His record stands because he collected 60 stars on a new realm faster than anyone else. When someone does that faster than him, no one is going to care about how they did it so long as it wasn't an exploit.
---
Lol, wrong. The fastest unassisted run will 100% be remembered, regardless of what a group of 40 people do faster. Why? **Because they are different categories**.
---
False equivalence. OP could just be on a more crowded server instead.
---
Think of it this way. 
---
There's an estimated 1 to 3 million active subscribers (blizzard doesn't report anymore) and they ALL will have access to classic for free.
---
There will be an unknown amount of return players subscribing just for classic (I'd guess over 100k).
---
Now imagine everyone trying to log in and play. Queue times just to login would be *hours*.
---
"You can just hang around outside in the sun all day, tossing a ball around, or you can sit at your computer and do something that matters!"

Preach brother. Nail on the head.

---
Well...  debt definitely wouldn't help your situation.

Starting zones only, or maz level 10

Who said anything about manipulating? Have fun making gold when the rarest herbs sell for 30% of what they usually go for. Have fun farming gold without a Hunter or Mage lol. 
---
Your a retail baby, thats fine man - just own it.
---
My bad.  I meant no debt other than a home mortgage.  Preferably 15 year.  Definitely 20% down.

Do you know if blizz is rolling out classic with RP and PVPRP servers? I'm not exactly into roleplaying but I'm the kind of player that will sacrifice a few stat points for cooler looking gear and sort of build a narrative about my journey and toon. The biggest problem with RP servers though is they typically attract the worst griefers, keyboard-turners, and people who take it too seriously, but I made some great friends on RP servers back in the day, although my main was on Archimonde. 
---
RP guilds tend to do poorly in end game content too, but I don't want to play with impatient pricks who rage over dungeon wipes or supertryhards either.
---
I am so thankful that this is true.
---
Exactly how I feel about it too.
---
Everytime I say "No one is stupid enough to think that." The Wow community proves me wrong. You'd be surprised how opinions and levels of understanding vary among folks. I'm not arguing with you, but seriously, a lot of noobs read this sub and think leeway is some Legion mechanic or some stupid crap and want it removed entirely.
---
The #NoChanges crowd fall silent when you point out they aren't using a CRT monitor come Aug 26th.
---
because queues will be awful first few weeks until all the tourists leave. blizz needs to have few servers so that when everyone leaves there will still be a playerbase left in 6 months
---
Let me be your codpiece.
---
The majority of leeway post just say its wrong and how can blizz do this, omg this is messed up remove leeway, REE reee REEE. I would guess maybe 10% of the people browsing here fully understand that its needed in the game.
---
Optimal is a pretty strong word in regards to PvP. It's passable, but SL and Conflag beat it.

I played vanilla for years, and I enjoyed it. I am going to enjoy classic. I did not enjoy trying to find a place to even find 1 mob that someone wasn't waiting for in *all of Elwynn*. Honestly, you  are really disingenuous about the scope of the issue. I haven't seen anyone supporting layering because it was slightly more convenient, they are supporting layering because it *allows them to actually play, even in the immense competition*.
---
I logged into the character screen and looked at all my 110s and 120s and was like "fuck this" and logged off.
---
This is brilliant thank you. I'll definitely be going for the nightsabres but it's nice to know it's more efficient to go for horses first.
---
What do you think the purpose of a beta is?
---
Furthermore they're the fucking developers. Are you gonna tell a surgeon how to operate next?
---
Is Joanna‚Äôs guide still available ? If so, I was on jubeithos when joana levelled his hunter to 60 in 4day20hr played time. The fastest way to level is efficient questing - nor arguments, discussions, etc.
---
Yeah, you can go back to that private server you were on with the 15 other people who will be there. 
---
Be real, this is the dumbest threat I have read in awhile.

**Epoch of Thought \[H\]** | NA-PvP | Wed, Thur, Sun 1800‚Äî2200 PST | Hardcore
---
**TL;DR**:  Hardcore experienced, established guild seeks non-toxic, dedicated, competent raiders for Classic dominance starting with test realm preparation now. We most need Resto Shamans atm, but except all great people who are willing to work to be their best.
---
**About**: EoT started on Bloodscalp shortly after vanilla wow‚Äôs release &amp; became a top guild on the server. We‚Äôve persisted as a gaming family ever since. Our goal has always been to clear content as a team while providing a second family for our members.  
---
Our leadership is experienced, skilled, and caring.  We've been around since the beginning and we're not quitting until we've farmed Naxx enough to gear everyone :).  We look forward to developing a winning team of people you'd not only want to raid with, but would also like to meet in real life if the chance arose.
---
**Raiding plans**: For classic we will be a top guild &amp; clear Naxxramas. We have a solid core experienced through Naxx. Most of us have raided for years &amp; are ready to devour classic content. We are running two competitive raid teams both lead by experienced leadership and tanked by experienced main tanks.  
---
**Loot System**:  We run a unique/proprietary point-guided loot council (attendance and contributions are measured and accounted for but there is no bidding and the system is designed to be transparent and efficient).  The loot council is focused on awarding gear where it best serves raid progression &amp; best recognizes attendance, &amp; contribution to raid performance.
---
**What we expect**: We expect dedicated, skilled raiders who show up with consumes, proper gear, &amp; knowledge. We expect competence and literacy with computers, google spread sheets, balancing individual schedules, and team communication.  We expect effort during, before, and after raids.  We expect serious practice on a guild hosted test server.  
---
We are team-focused so great performers are appreciated &amp; recognized, but divas who are unconcerned with the health of the entire raid team or overly self-interested are not tolerated. We are a diverse group of raiders worthy of individual respect &amp; the respect of everyone‚Äôs time.  Toxicity and drama stirring have no place in our guild.
---
**In short, be prepared, be knowledgeable, be on time, &amp; don‚Äôt be an A-hole.**
---
**Why We Will Survive and Thrive**:  We are experienced, dedicated, and prepared.  Our leadership team consists of mature, experienced, and professional leaders.  Our raid core consists of experienced, skilled, and most importantly, dedicated raiders.  
---
We are busy doing all the prep work we need to run a highly organized, reasonably competitive guild.  We are inclusive, non-toxic, and value team building and a rewarding social environment over pyrrhic victories.  We were successful in actual vanilla and have only gotten smarter, wiser, and more organized with age.
---
Most importantly we desire complete decimation of classic content and will not stop until we get there.
---
**Raid Schedule**: Wed, Thur, Sun, 6 PM to 10 PM PST (GMT-8) (9pm ‚Äì 1 AM EST) hard stops and early nights where possible. Our guild has always been extremely active &amp; 20-mans, Onyxia, etc. will continue to be ran on non-core days. On most days, if you log in, you will find a good group of people to smash content with.
---
**Looking for**: We are seeking a few more Resto Shamans atm, but great people of all classes are strongly encouraged to apply.  Core raid spots are earned through demonstrated competence &amp; dedication. This means that no core spots will be predetermined and certainly not before anyone's hit 60.
---
If you are interested in leadership roles within the guild please send me a whisper &amp; let‚Äôs chat.
---
**Current Activity**:  The guild is practicing on our own test server to get the group reoriented to the old content and shaking the rust off.  We use the test raids for providing feedback, polishing raid skills, and determining and bolstering roster weakness.  
---
Currently, a sizeable portion of the guild is practicing leveling runs on pservers while a few are raiding hardcore.  We also have guild jackbox party nights for fun while we wait for classic.
---
**Apply**: The best way to join is to shoot our Guildmaster a private discord message **(Discord: Lne#2710 | Battlenet: Lne#1326)**.  You can also hit up either of my assistant GMs on **discord:  XvK#7740  &amp; AYD#5916**
---
The less social can also fill out an application on our Website [http://epochofthought.shivtr.com](http://epochofthought.shivtr.com)  
---
You can also jump on our discord at [https://discord.gg/UqAVjJT](https://discord.gg/UqAVjJT
---
**Join us!**
---
Did you not suss the stress test? It was layered aswell.. still had a fuckton of people fighting for mobs.
---
You better roll on everything you can equip and even some things you can't, IT'S ALL HUNTER GEAR! Seriously though, thinking of rolling rogue myself instead with all the current hunter issues.
---
If you have no experience of WoW Classic Beta or at minimum a fresh Pserver launch, why on Earth are you trying to pass off your opinions as tips for WoW Classic launch?
---
&gt; But what if you meet afker? Person who leaves because he can only play 1 hour? When you are middle of nowhere and try to get 1 person in mid of dungeon run where you have boss downed and have no lock?
---
Before sending invites, you confirm they have the time and get everyone on Discord. If they aren't sure or refuse, you replace them. People willing to join a voice server to ensure a smooth run are likely to be more skilled and more dedicated.
---
As a healer, you should always befriend every Warrior and Druid you come across that seems even remotely skilled and dedicated. You'll be able to monitor their play times and leveling speeds, giving you ample opportunities to find the right one to say "hey, I'm planning to reach level X at this time, let's get together and do Y dungeon at 0Z00 time, I'll line up DPS an hour or so before." You remind them of the quests and rewards if needed. This means you lose absolutely no time in questing time. Once you do this a few times, you can start adding DPS to your list as well. Then you have a solid pool to choose from that know your goals, your pace, and your style, all without ever joining a guild.
---
A solid tank and a solid healer with 3 DPS listening on voice chat will destroy any dungeon in Classic (this is also a problem you experienced because mobs on Pservers are harder than on Classic).
---
Girlfriend isnt happy that my friend is spending the weekend so we can play. At least he is bringing his own mouse and keyboard.
---
That's what I said, people know but the people hearing misunderstand.
---
I was concerned going back into it but it's so well done it's still enjoyable, glad you dig it!
---
Curious how much of the game I still remember after having quit 10 years ago.
---
Baron Rivendare's Deathcharger Reigns.
---
It‚Äôs not even a big deal.  It‚Äôs people panicking that one little thing being different will invalidate their experience, which is ridiculous because there are things no one is throwing a fit over, like the macro system.  No one‚Äôs falling over themselves because castsequence made it in, but that stuff is definitely not Vanilla.  No one‚Äôs demanding all the protected LUA functions be opened back up so we can write smart macros.
---
&gt;There's no need to layer or shard if the population of the server is high enough
---
High populations is *why their is layering*. You wanna wait 4 hours in a queue to login?
---
Well if you're trying to get both, the efficiency path might be a bit different.  
---
The guy who hosts the shadowpanther website is creating a rep efficiency path I believe. Might look into that.
---
Awesome! Thanks for the info
---
Might as well check the "At War" box right now.
---
&gt; oh boi ever been to WoW retail facebook groups? xD
---
No, I'm not a boomer.
---
I kept trying to log in getting a message saying none of the servers were up.
---
&gt;  There are people specifically speed leveling unassisted for a reason, and it's not because they think it'll be the fastest.
---
Yes it is. Even Joana says this:
---
&gt; Many people have asked me if dungeons (instances) are a waste of time.  No, they are worth doing, but only if you have a good group to do them.  I personally skip dungeons while racing myself to 60, cause I don't want to take the chance that I will have a bad group.
---
Even your king doesn't subscribe to your purity notion. And if you watch his speed runs, he grouped up several times for various quests and accepted trades. 
---
He even borrowed gold to be able to afford his mount:
---
&gt; Another thing to note is that I usually have to borrow gold from players when speedleveling on new servers (I pay them back in double) in order to buy my mount in the mid 40s.
---
So who is the unassisted Vanilla record holder then? Because it's not Joana. That's right, you have no idea because no one remembers because no one case.
---
Hmmm. Could he? If Vanilla had a cap, and the layer has the same cap, and he's on an unpopulated layer, how would he get into the populated server? The queue would be full.
---
If he couldnt get in queue, (on a full non-layered server) he would go to another server.
---
Not really
---
Best part of this is that it‚Äôs in Zul‚ÄôFarrak
---
I didn't downvote you (until now) but crying about downvotes on reddit only works out 1 way, friend.
---
Yes, I was on the stress test, that's why I know that layering is needed. The server I was on had minimal layering, while the other one had much more robust layering. The entire point was to fine-tune the numbers. Server 15 was way under-layered, as you noticed. You realize you are making my point?
---
Recollect tier 0.5... other riding shit I missed
---
I definitely will! Thanks a bunch!
---
&gt;people here get kinda tunnel visioned into classic good retail bad mindset
---
It's dedicated to classic wow... Of course it's that way. *Many* people are  specifically here because they do not like retail.
---
Hunter is the easiest to gear. In deadmines alone you have access to emberstone staff. Lavishly jeweled ring. Defias set. You could very well roll need on every item that drops!
---
As a warrior main I like dueling rogues. IN MY OPINION neither of our kits counter each other so it comes down to skill and luck. Unlike getting rolled by a mage or rolling a shaman.
---
Backporting from Legion was the only way to make Classic happen. If they had to rebuild everything, the decision to start the project never would have been made.
---
Pretty sure all enchanting wands are cheap AF on AH when everyone else is lvling profs.
---
Use skinning herb to make money.  Chase good wand drops or buy them.  Not very hard.
---
The fact that you can't see that says tons about you. I'm not personally offended... but I don't want anything to do with your side of the argument when you essentially call all American's retards.
---
I am having this problem too. Now that I am older an can appreciate every class and build I want them all lol.
---
I play Retail almost everyday and everyday I do for right now we'll see in 8.2 I hate it more and more.
---
If you say so. Whatever makes you feel better about your life. I guess if trolling people on the internet makes you feel better who am I to stand in your way.
---
If layers are to manage increased population and rare mats have fixed spawns, the number of rare mats per player should be roughly consistent. 
---
Further, if layer numbers are fixed and node locations are fixed, increased population = increased competition to farm the nodes. 
---
Is there something I'm missing? How will layering significantly impact the economy?
---
Getting 9 Arena chests in one go. That's what he did.
---
\-There is no single random who would join discord even though not necessary .
---
\-There was no single warrior I met in dungeon who was even near my lvling speed. I actually added all mages/warriors/druids. I was more online + I quested 5x more effecient.
---
\-You can say anything you want in chat. Half people dont even understand english properly or dont care. Its not like "promise" mean any shit especially in private.
---
I did 2x60 runs in private. Reason is because there is 0% chance to get into retail beta. I also assume that if its (no changes) its closely similiar. My opinion wont change. Unless its top 20% or MC guild then I wont take any risks. I had enough experience of randoms.
---
Ugh, this makes me terrified to play hunter. The main thing I want to do is pvp, and this feels like it would put me at a gigantic disadvantage. 
---
Does this effect other abilities as well? Will I get charged from further away due to intercept? That would kill my advantage of having the longest range in the game
---
I'm in the shower right now looking at this
---
You haven't awaken quite yet.
---
Get Ashkandi and dominate the barrens with my pally bro. Good luck ;)
---
Yeah. Dynamic respawns make certain things impossible. People who want dynamic respawns have never had to suffer through them.
---
not a troll..  u r whining about something that won't happen.  you sound like a republican talking about illegal immigrants voting.   you are trying to solve a problem that doesn't exist.
---
I first played a hunter, but then rolled a holy priest. Stuck with my human holy priest through the remainder of Vanilla and every expansion since.
---
I LOVED healing in Vanilla. The act of watching health and timing heals/cancelling/downranking to pick the right heal size... the gameplay was so much more fun back then. I can‚Äôt wait to get back to it. It hasn‚Äôt been the same since BC...
---
Not sure if I‚Äôm going to roll dwarf or human, though.
---
I also doubt I‚Äôll ever raid again... but I‚Äôm excited to gear up in dungeon blues.
---
It does on context since you're comparing it to when the game launched
---
Well this is where your experience starts to detour away from the speedleveling experience of Classic. Because if your speed is as good as you say, you will find people just as good wanting to do dungeons and they will be willing to join Discord.
---
You're framing your planned Classic experience and gimping your potential leveling speed in Classic because of negative experiences on a Private Server that wasn't even fresh.
---
Your tip is how best to level on a non-Fresh PServer, nothing more.
---
Basically using macros properly and understanding shot rotation better. Also starting a profession at lvl not at 60 like an idiot.
---
&gt;You are essentially saying that players even though they are 120 (DOUBLE the level required to do it originally) they should still have trouble doing BWL.
---
Yes because raids should scale and raid gear should be exclusive to raiding not soloing. I don't care how old the content is, it devalues the gear and lore when it's blasted through solo like it is these days.
---
I'm a fan of cs vanish ambush tea stab cbevis. blind and restealth.  Requires 5pc ns and the reduced energy cost talent in subt. 
---
Not sure how sap dr works with hat combo though if you use it after the blind.
---
Lmao, I've probably been playing wow longer than you've been alive. 
---
I won't need to make that much gold, this game is deeper than just having stacks. 
---
You can reliably farm everything you need to clear any content. So unless you're just one of those retail goblins that actually only plays retail to make gold nobody gives a shit. 
---
Sounds like you're projecting. Why don't you do us all a favor and drown yourself, because obviously you don't contribute anything other than hot air.
---
It's irrelevant whether you, or 90% of the playerbase deems a change good or not. The point of no changes is to prevent meddling from Blizzard. I'd rather take all the bad of vanilla with all of the good than give ActiBlizz control over the mechanics of the game. It's a fundamental principle to prevent the slippery slope. And I don't particularly give a fuck what \[insert streamer here\] thinks about anything.
---
That‚Äôs the whole point of the beta. If you don‚Äôt want to do it then don‚Äôt.
---
You still haven't answered the first question.
---
I'm here too.
---
I'd love to play all the way through to Wrath again. Give us B.C for a time, hit us with Wrath, and then I'm going to quit in CATA like I did before.
---
this is a great psychological experiment when one thread has the word "obvious" and the other one doesn't. 10/10 take my thumbs up. I hate people
---
You do have the resources. That‚Äôs how you know things arnt the same.
---
WotLK was terrible and destroyed the game.
---
Fresh bread for sale!
---
"Twerking in the shadows."  
---
My brain needs to settle down...
---
&gt; It will be playable anyway. You're acting like a server being overcrowded for a few days is some sort of catastrophe, when in reality it's a mild inconvenience.
---
*didn't play the stress test*. If I hadn't played the stress test, what you posted sounds exactly like some shit that I would say too.
---
Really we have 1.12 resources on all aspects of the game? Where?
---
Have fun waiting in a 50k player queue because some streamtard decided to roll on the server your guild is playing on.
---
How this is not relevant for retail?
---
99% of players dont have any classic experience. If you join with randoms you will have same equal experience as in private server. There is nothing different.
---
Do we even talk about same subject anymore? I think you are talking about you and your buddies clearing dungeon which I dont disagree that it will be effecient. Im talking about joining with randoms.
---
If you are fast solo lvler you better have good guild to back you up if you want to sacrifice your time in dungeon.
---
I give you the ‚Äúcertified piece of shit‚Äù label. Think what you want, I don‚Äôt tell people to kill themselves..
---
You may be an old person, but you are obviously immature AF.
---
Do surgeons have open betas and forums for receiving feedback on their abilities?
---
And a piece they do not even know the name of.
---
I shouldn't justify this garbage with a reply but it's not a "threat" it's just a fact. I'm not going to invest time into a game where someone trying to gank me can have their friend invite them and accept the invite when I start winning to phase into another dimension never to be seen again... Yeah I'll hard pass thanks. 
---
This OP has a reasonable solution as well but in 1-2 months time the starting zones won't even "need" it because the BFA players like you will all have gone back to buy some more pets and mounts.
---
This and Chronicles of the Annoying Quest were my favorite comedy WoW videos
---
Lmao, figured with a username like yours you can take it. Turns out your just a wanna be classic baby who can dish it out but can't take it.
---
You know that high level resources will be exploited by people who will rush to 60. The high levels will just layer jump to farm resources. Since the amount of the resources will be multipled by number of layers.
---
BFA sold 600,000 more copies in 24 hours than any other WoW expansion in the history of the game. I doubt Blizzard considers it a failure in the slightest.
---
Fuck the environment just give me the game book
---
When I was 21-8-22 my go to was;
---
CS - SS - Gouge - KS - BS - BS - Blind - Stealth - CS - Gouge - KS - BS - BS.
---
I might be slightly misremembering exactly what it was but it was a fun combo to use in duels.
---
Yep. You got me... tell me how you really feel. Let the anger out. You sound like an angry liberal.
---
Bad for getting inside
---
I have 0 hours logged in BFA, but hey as long as you can generalize, right?
---
You're right, starting zones wont need it *which is why layering is being removed towards the start of classic since its only being used for launch*. You're so worked up over this whole situation and you don't even know that layering isn't a permanent feature. 
---
Let me try responding like you now. Crybabies like you won't make it in a *hardcore* environment like classic. God that sounds lame, please remind me to not sound like you ever again.
---
You keep throwing the random word around like it was the right decision. Your choice to do dungeons should never be random.
---
And yes, 99% of the people will have no experience with Classic. But if your questing efficiency and dedication is as good as you think, then you'll outpace them long before any worthwhile dungeon becomes an option. The people leftover will all be experienced and dedicated and not at all what you experienced on a Private Server.
---
Those are the people you befriend, those are the people you consider. And once you do that, your dungeon group is NEVER random.
---
To be fair, stream-sniping people to gank them is like shooting fish in a barrel. Nothing stops you doing it, and nothing stops them from deciding not to stream... but it's not exactly a display of skill to gank someone or camp them when you have that kind of unfair advantage.
---
Reading the manual and playing WC3 was how I coped in the times I didn't have money to buy game time haha
---
what about warlocks?
---
Have you had the bug with pet training? I had my first pet, used pet training to teach it spells and put it in the stable. Went to get a 2nd pet, as I taught this 2nd pet spells...my game would lag out hard everytime I clicked train. This seemed to only happen while I had a pet stabled.
---
BREAK BREAK BREAK
---
WoW Classic Beta has bugs!  Sound the alarms!  Women and children first!  Run for your lives!
---
They do actually.
---
 I don't need you to tell me how fucking good my grog is, okay? I'm the one who buys it. I know how good it is. When Chromie goes shopping she buys SHIT. I buy the gourmet expensive stuff because when I drink it I want to taste it. But you know what's on my mind right now? It AIN'T the grog in my tavern, it's the dead troll in my garage.
---
Didn't experience that one. I did get a second pet but only for a few seconds to learn screech
---
You should try a little harder buddy, you called me a private server player and then act like a crybaby because I called you a BFA player? I'm done with whatever this dialogue was, gonna tick that ignore button now later kid.
---
Why spell batching? Unlike leeway or layering, spell batching did exist in Vanilla.
---
I heard a game called Bless Online sold a lot of copies too....i guess that means it's not a failure right...
---
My issue is layering keeps getting used as this miracle solution that solves polar opposite issues. 
---
Yes layering can make the first few weeks better. But its actual solution was supposed to be for tourists leaving which will not happen in just two weeks. Tourists will leave in the first 2 weeks but true population changes won't happen for months and that's why everyone knows layering isn't going anywhere.
---
Blizzard is passing on costs at the expense of us actually experiencing vanilla. There should servers 1-5 of each server and if they die they're merged. They should share naming conventions to ensure smooth transitions. You're telling me you're going to openly argue that being on warsong 5 diminishes your gameplay more than being on some stupid abuse ridden layering system? Come on.
---
Ban Method, Limit and Exorsus!
---
His arse
---
Random for me is synonym with idiot. Going blindy to dungeon with unknown potential idiot will slow you down.
---
You have 3 choices.
---
1. Join retail with bfa guild 
---
2. Join retail with raiding guild you had in private server
---
3. Level fast and whisper with people who also level fast / add them friends.
---
If you cant get neither 1-3 of option you should go 100% solo. Im trying to arrange raidguild spot atm from private server. I will never play with randoms again.
---
So who says there aren't skills that are purely for pvp and useless in pve?
---
Highly disagree 35-40. Doing SM Cath farm runs 5-6 at a time is like 30k/hr xp.
---
That's how all the quickest beta players did it. The trick is you don't just run it once
---
It‚Äôs dead
---
fishing in the pool is not a bug, having to throw your cast into the wall is
---
Crazy. Not a single mention about how you didn't even now layering was a timed feature. Anyway, you're welcome. You can enter the next layering topic with more information.
---
Are these the default raid frames?
---
Thing is the vast majority on the beta are very competent. So for us doing 4-5 runs back to back w one party in SM is crazy fast XP.
---
You know.. 99.99% of the subreddit blindly screeches at people saying it's a carbon copy and if they say it's good it's good... Sooo cake or eat it
---
Me
---
Rogue has real game play. It's basically the same as live but with energy ticks.
---
None of the horde males stand up straight.  It‚Äôs actually been my biggest gripe aesthetically since classic
---
Yeah well thats what has been my point all along. 
---
If you can get inside those groups then sure. But if not its too huge risk. Might potentially lose 3 day worth of playtime with total strangers/idiots.
---
Me too, I've really been enjoying learning about it through making these!
---
Chiropractauren? Chiropractroll?
---
Hey I used to run a guild called Onslaught during vanilla on gorgannash and dragonmaw lol
---
The dude sitting underneath the dude taped to the ceiling is braver than any US Marine.

Blyat
---
&gt; Yeah, you can go back to that private server you were on with the 15 other people who will be there.
---
&gt;I have 0 hours logged in BFA, but hey as long as you can generalize, right?
---
like pottery.
---
I did get an invite to the stress test which really surprised me because I couldn't play because my us account was inactive. Thanks, blizz!
---
this
---
Is your warranted lack of faith in Blizzard not going down the slippery slope your primary reason for #NoChange?
---
I never played BFA and I haven't played Private Servers in over 5 years. I found a guild just fine.
---
You're gonna quit classic very soon after layering gets removed and go back to retail ;)
---
Dude, back then we actually had language specific servers. I played on a german one.
---
I have decided (well before this post) to not worry too much about layering, ( I still think it would be better with it just in the first 2 zones, but i really dont "know" too much about it, so im not going to waste my brain power stressing over it).  
---
I do think post like this matter, I spent more time enjoying the game in a 48 hour stress test than i have playing the game over the last 5 years and while i realise blizz will probs never see my msg but if it does somehow make it back to blizz hq i want them to know they are on the right track bringing back classic,   
---
and i just wanted to share for all the casuals out there, that the game is still fun even if you dont know what your doing
---
You haven't thought this through, have you?
---
How exactly is having 500\~ people in every starting zone a solution to solving overcrowding?
---
Its a private server Meta that i'm concerned will bleed into classic though i hopeful it isn't as bad.
---
IMAGINE right, there is 2 servers, one says population: high the other says population: medium, if you don't want to fight for tags you could always join the server with less players on it FUKKEN MAD IDEA I KNOW RIGHT
---
Many people who speak swahili, especially those living in europe, would be more at home on french than english servers.
---
You gotta fully trust the gaming friends
---
And how you know it will be decent? Personally I havent played retail over 3 years so cant go with guild.
---
My plan is get 60 asap and group up with other fast players and join guild that way after asking questions. I dont trust these made up "web" guilds where 80% players wont be even active and do not want to commit those.
---
Call me old, but I prefer the left one. If I'd want my fantasy world to look like IRL I'd go outside and roleplay.
---
Anyone that doesn't agree with these concerns didn't play vanilla or at the very least doesn't understand what the magic of vanilla was. Having parellel universe servers will be the death of the game. What's the difference between retail and classic when you can traverse "layers", it makes the social system of the game meaningless.
---
Yeah super dead atm sadly
---
I couldnt imagine the bs you guys are about to see :(
---
The easiest way that requires no external software and lets you change brightness/contrast/color vibrance would be the nvidia control panel in the desktop color settings menu (or something like that, I have different language settings).
---
If you want an external program with more options like post processing shaders and stuff like that you can look into either ReShade or Nvidia Freestyle.
---
why do redditors do the alt caps thing when being ironic it's the most cringe shit i swear.
---
When the current wow sub count is about the same as 6 months after the initial wow release... Yea its a failure. BFA was a possible spark of hope for alot of people, and it was a failure. And it wasn't much more than the previous expansions, only a little over 100k more copies sold.
---
Last night i dreamed of a nuclear apocalypse. I wish i had fun dreams.
---
If we dont at least get a reply to this I am seriously reconsidering this game that  I've been waiting and fighting for for 10 years. 
---
Blizzard clearly doesn't give a fuck about the EU and are willing to ruin the experience for everyone just to avoid a few under-populated servers. Have they looled at live?
---
Laying is the worst system they could've come up with behind sharding lol.
---
First, you'll want to test your ping to these three IPs (can be done in the command prompt with the ping command):
---
    185.60.112.157
---
    185.60.112.158
---
    185.60.114.159
---
Second, you'll want to consider the ramifications of your available play times versus your friends and that of the rest of the server.
---
Peak times for any server are usually between 7PM and midnight, local time.
---
If you're on the East Coast, this means 1PM to 6PM for you. West Coast, 10AM to 3PM.
---
If your friends are playing at off hours that fit your own schedule, go for it. If you find a guild full of people doing the same as you, go for it.
---
I don't have experience finding an American guild on EU realms, but I do have experience with the opposite (EU guild on NA realms). I was working nights, so their schedule fit my own.
---
Yup, this occurred to me. Is it a big issue? Mostly those players would be in different zones right?
---
if theres 30 severs and 5 have to merge not a big deal is it, you are going on like merging is literally the end of the world.
---
Sure it's not great but a couple of servers getting shafted is preferable to every single server, and the entire game in general getting fucked over because of a couple dead servers.
---
Release less servers, let people wait in queues, no layering no problems. 
---
inb4 OMFGGGGG WAIT? YOU EXPECT ME TO WAIT TO PLAY VIDEO GAYMES?! ITS 2019 FFS
---
&gt; what about warlocks?
---
For **Forsaken** you can look at Human Warlocks, of course. With the Well of Eternity being used as a gate to the Twisting Nether and scattering during the Sundering, the ethereal constructs of this fel magic was spread throughout Azeroth. This knowledge wasn't a secret, and the High Elves made Humans aware of this all the same as the arcane. Plus, Orc Warlocks later invaded Azeroth and became an obvious reality for Humans so they've been studying it (illegally or not) for some time. Kel'thuzad is an example of someone who clearly was aware of it in life, despite the Kirin Tor's general stance against it. 
---
So Forsaken Warlocks very well could have been Warlocks in life. Plus, when they became members of the Scourge they literally worked with demons for a period and of course have a Dreadlord in a high position next to Sylvanas. Suffice to say, the Royal Apothecary experiments with demonic blood and what have you with no quarrels. So whether in life or death, they've had plenty of exposure for Warlocks to emerge. 
---
**Trolls** have had knowledge of demonic and fel powers for a significant amount of time as well. Zandalari and Gurubashi trolls practiced demonology in ancient times. Amani trolls worked with the Demonic Horde during the first and second war. Darkspears who left the Gurubashi probably contained Warlocks or at least people that dabbled in demonology to some degree (Come get the Voodoo is pretty close there too). Plus, there's again the notion of them picking it up from Forsaken. 
---
And finally **Orc Warlocks** are an obvious one since they were historically the first Warlocks in the Warcraft franchise (WC1/2). Being directly taught them demonic and fel magic through Kil'jaedan and in turn Gul'dan back on Draenor/Outland. Whether Thrall likes it or not, Orc Warlocks a plenty on Azeroth. His reasons for allowing them in the Horde are a little more questionable though, considering his hatred for demons, but then we get to faction balance again I suppose. That said, the Orc questline surrounding the Burning Blade does deal with this directly.
---
True, at the end of the day, what happened with WoW was a bit of an anomaly.  
---
With that said, they don't need to replicate a growth of 150-300k players a month like it was all the way to wrath.  I don't think it would have been out of the question to at least expect a tiny growth, if not stagnation post release.  Now that they are incorporating random crap that wasn't in vanilla.. who knows what could change in the mindsets of many gamers.
---
I think it would be huge. Would definitely break emersion.
---
I havent seen mod abuse or narratives that harm the community. The fuck are you talking about
---
During Legion we journeyed to Argus, the baseworld of the Burning Legion, and put a stop to the Burning Crusade by aiding the Titan Pantheon in trapping Sargeras. While there, we met Alleria and Turalyon (last seen in Warcraft 2: Beyond the Dark Portal). In the time before we arrived, Turalyon has become the High Exarch of the Army of the Light. Alleria has learned and harnessed the power of the Void, thanks to the help of an ethereal. After Legion, Alleria visited her homeland of Silvermoon City. Being near the Sunwell did not go well; minions of the Void used her presence to summon themselves to the Sunwell, nearly corrupting it. Alleria was banished from Quel'thalas permanently. Some members of the Blood Elves wanted to harness the Void as Alleria did. The group, led by Magister Umbric, nearly succumbed to the insanity of the Void. Alleria saved them (alongside the player). The new Void Elves (empowered by the Void through a ritual) are not welcome in Silvermoon, and Lor'themar will not allow them to stay in the Horde. Alleria now leads the Void Elves in the Alliance, and trains them. They are in the Alliance only thanks to Alleria, very few trust them

What about inconsistencies that have slipped through the cracks from Legion and can't be identified? - which was the main point of this post.
---
Finally, a post about this where almost all the responses so far make sense. 
---
#NO QUEUES
---
Look, no offense OP but there have been so many of these posts. None of them share any convincing new reasons why a normal person with a heartbeat would prefer wasting nights that they want to spend playing, waiting on a silly multi hour queue instead.
---
So it‚Äôs up to you, convince me. Just don‚Äôt use the words: impact social interaction, warp out of PvP, or exploiting chests, vendors, and resource nodes, None of these arguments have been compelling.
---
Bless you for you're history preserving work sir
---
Best I got
---
&gt; why do redditors do the alt caps thing when being ironic it's the most cringe shit i swear.
---
Also you:

&gt; oi bruv u got a loiscence for that argument fam
---
Ur NoT eVeN tRyInG
---
I did the alliance side of the quest just to see it.  AOE everything!!! Got bout 2 lvls got borde now was classic back
---
Shadows usually put a lot of extra strain on the system when playing it. While I think it's great I am not sure most players couldn't handle it.
---
It absolutely wasn't. Edgy 12 year old me was insta-banned twice for saying things that would be considered docile compared to what currently happens on private servers.
---
Which ones?
---
Thats why they have layering, and the servers are going to dry up sooner or later anyway. Considering how many ghost towns they have on live it feels a little hypocritical that they can't set up a handful of servers for the big languages.
---
But this simply isn't the case we have seen it over and over again. After the starting zones people become so much more spread out after a couple of days it's a non issue.
---
Out of everything I've seen posted, the reins are the only thing that piqued my interest.
---
That's been like that since vanilla so it's legit and they still haven't fixed it in retail
---
In the demo last year, we saw players were phasing constantly as well as resources as the system deemed it fit, much like in retail.  
---
It isn't semantics.  You don't get forcefully phased with layering (although city gates seem to be different for whatever reason) when you are out questing/gathering.  It is by choice that you swap layers.  
---
With sharding, the entire system is designed around a constant flux of the zone/area populations, and it just constantly 'fills' areas with people against their will.  
---
Don't get me wrong, I think layering is far worse.  But the bottom line is that both would cause people to quit.  I really don't want to trade one hell for another hell that I already experienced in retail.  I got to play from vanilla all the way to cross server, and it was the most miserable drop off I have ever experienced in a game.
---
Because I've seen their dedication, seen their accomplishments, spoken to them frequently, love the effort put into their loot system, love their plans for a week one Rag kill, and have been playing with them on the Beta and their own server for the last month or so.
---
Exactly. I'll roll on an english realm but we won't even have that if the people who don't speak english don't have their own homes.
---
 It's a reason. There's also the fact that the game is what the game is. I  don't really agree with or like the perpetually changing design of  MMORPG's. It's a unique situation that's difficult to deal with though.  It's why I quite enjoy private servers and the fact that the main vanilla WoW private server core is now open source. Server owners can make changes to the game and  players can choose what they deem to be the best. But Blizzard has a  complete monopoly on MMORPG's so that choice simply doesn't exist in the  legal realm. I guess the best way to answer the hypothetical is to say  that if Blizzard were to have dedicated "no changes" and "changes"  realms then it wouldn't be so bothersome as whatever was simply the  better edition of the game would outperform. Above all giving the  consumers choices is what matters.
---
Just shard the starter zones. So Elwynn and Durotar etc.
---
Rag? You said you didnt play private server
---
So am I (your shower)
---
I don't have a special care for it, but it's the most consistent online database around with the most accurate information on items and abilities. Not to mention, when we get final information on how things *really* work (that we don't know yet), you can bet money on Classic Wowhead having the best data around.
---
But for now, the reason I linked them is because they have the best archived comments, which reveal a massive amount of relevant testing data that have gone into many items and abilities (along with the usual unscientific anecdotes, which can come in handy sometimes).
---
You never played vanilla so you don't understand, that's fine but don't call other people who know better ignorant.
---
Bro how much adderall you on fam
---
That's a way of looking at it i can get behind. I'm hopeful that their will be a true "Classic" realm set that i can log into and progress my alt even 5 or 8 years down the line.
---
Hate to say it, but blizzard never instantly applied the debuff back then.  Perhaps it is too extreme right now, but I never expected my blizzard to allow me to kite anyone reliably because of how close they could get before getting slowed, as opposed to simply frostbolt tagging and running away.  
---
I feel this particular example is just a mage who doesn't realize that you never had any full control in PvP with blizzard.  There was always a rather large delay.
---
R u excited
---
No lol
---
&gt;I notice most people were level 3-4 with 5hrs or more play time and I was level 10
---
Ouch, slow. I thought my exploration was slow at 3:45 to ten.
---
&gt;which leads me to #8 - Mobs XP is also reduced.
---
Across the board, mobs on every server, private or classic match the 45+(clvl*5) xp rates, with accurate values for higher / lower level.
---
&gt;Exploration route XP is less in classic then in the private server.
---
Mine's close. But lower by like 5 here and there. Surprisingly, Ironforge never gave me XP (though SW and Darnassus did)
---
There was no sharding, layering, or any type of phasing in the original trilogy of the game.  You can go dig through all patch notes for yourself, but it just wasn't a thing lol
---
I mean... I'd prefer you and every other person that is a baby to quit the game. This is coming from someone who commutes 2 hours a day and works another 8. Now that's an alternative to layering.
---
retail player asking
---
Stopping players from hopping layers if they have been in pvp combat within the last 5-10 minutes would be a start.
---
Yea, if your PC was a 1999 non gaming rig.  
---
You could play AV back then and still see people from quite a ways away on the average settings.  You could see peoples' spell effects while dueling from the moment you turned the corner to head outside of IF anyway.
---
Hard to find good ones that small

Sounds to me you want leeway to compensate your skills. You say your no expert but claim to have played on ‚Äúbig servers‚Äù with and without. The one without being frustrating.
---
Everyone who claims leeway was in Vanilla can‚Äôt find any clear evidence of its existence.
---
The ones who claim it isn‚Äôt have found multiple videos disproving it. 
---
Maybe it was but I can promise you if it was it‚Äôs not as big of a discrepancy as it is now in classic. As it stands now it‚Äôs fraud and abuse of mechanic.
---
Well I mean they could be in bed, maybe on the toilet. Could be saying that they're wrong, or maybe they're grinding Anchor weed for 8.2.
---
and yes this is a poor attempt at a joke
---
Don't bother man... too many "layering is just for ph1" normies in this sub these days.... they don't care about anything but not having to fight for mobs. Come @ me down votes, my body is ready.
---
I can't believe you are getting downvoted for speaking the obvious truth here...  
---
This is not pop in.  This is clearly a phasing glitch with layering.  This has been reported for a couple weeks now.   Whether or not it gets fixed or they even deem it as a bug, we have no idea.
---
Needed is a strong word.
---
Because its better than thousands of people in every starting zones? Jesus christ dude, are you just trolling or actually this dumb?
---
And phasing was linked to quest progression and nothing else, not zone population.  
---
Wasn't until cata that they really went hardcore with it.
---
&gt;Ironforge is a ghost town.
---
Maybe they were on a different layer.
---
You can design your own and get 10 of them for as little as $9 (depends on size) at [Stickermule](https://www.stickermule.com/unlock?ref_id=6944271701&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_source=invite). They're high quality die cut stickers. I still have a ton of them on my everyday use laptop from hackathons that have never shown any signs of wear. 
---
If you use that link, you get $10 credit. But it can only be used on a purchase of $30 or more, which is probably irrelevant for you, but it also means I get $10 too, so I'd appreciate you remembering to use it if you like what you see.
---
Good for you, I speak english really well, too. Now think about other people.
---
Even on a crappy computer, you'd still see spell effects even if the players didn't load.  This was by design, and specs never changed that.
---
I guess diff strokes for diff folks cuz I have 0 interest in going back to do old raids &amp; dungeons. I absolutely despise timewalking.
---
hunter shouldnt be dead, only feigned death lol
---
I never argued 500 is better than 5000, I'm asking how it SOLVES overcrowding, which was my original question you never answered.
---
Do you know the definition of solve?
---
Legion???? Classic is based on BfA. How can you not know that??
---
No it most likely does not even out, if you have had 2 months of players farming, abusing layers etc they will have massive stacks of lotus to play with, you are going to end up in a situation where a few people are controlling the lotus market inflating the price whilst everyone else who played normally is scrounging for scraps.
---
Meanwhile every other herb is worth nothing because even casual, non-exploitative players will have farmed enough to last them the rest of the game.
---
That is honestly the most likely scenario.
---
No they are not instances.  This is clearly phasing for whatever reason. 
---
How many people are that ignorant on vanilla?  Have only 5% of the people posting here actually played the original trilogy of the game?  Man, this is becoming infuriating at this point.
---
I guess you just use the sock if you need to.
---
They can't disable layering if a server is already maxing out 5+ layers worth of people.  
---
They either remove it before it launches, or they keep it until the game loses enough players on average to let servers drop the feature.
---
Doing the starting zone quests at appropriate level is the biggest deal for rep so plan accordingly!
---
Pretty sure that was a problem with lag in vanilla
---
Good question.  My guess is that they have been toying around with the idea of hub layer switching to prevent exploits.. which would be so frickin annoying on a whole other level. 
---
Everything about this garbage is insane.
---
I'd totally prefer that to layering.
---
This subreddit is actually incredibly split. I'm curious where your 99% data is from.
---
Fury warrior is an option to consider.
---
Probably bc it was temporary
---
Helping a friend?
---
 RemindMe! August 27
---
no changes tho
---
 
---
I'd prefer being able to communicate with my server community rather than having to ignore large parts of it.
---
Its dead, Youtube systems and easier to produce content killed it.
---
Rag = Ragnaros, the final boss of MC.
---
And no, you're taking me out of context. You said the only option was to join Classic with the raiding guild you had on a Private Server. I never raided with them until very recently, on a server specifically tuned with Beta numbers used for practicing leveling routes and Molten Core in greens.
---
I'm going to enjoy playing the game blizzard abandoned for years. It's going to be great doing old professions again. I don't really have many progression goals. The only raid I did in classic was ubrs. My sister's guild ran me through at 56 if I remember right and that was the day before TBC released.
---
And if the game only grows for half a year?  How in the world can they subject so many server caps worth of people via layers, to server transfering?  As if that is going to be an actual option man.
---
It isn't that bad past the first few days.  It isn't 'weeks' like you and others keep thinking.
---
I'll never not love this video. But it's also exactly why I will never roll a male spellcaster toon.
---
Imagine being on the layer that is the least populated at the time... what a crapfest of an idea the whole thing was.
---
As bad as sharding is, I still think it would have been less damaging than layering.  What a dumb position Blizzard has put themselves in now.
---
Imo just suffer through the starting zone, it picks up in Darkshore like crazy if you're ahead of the curve.
---
Sorry, but I dont speak whatever snarky shit your spouting. I literally fucking said without leeway you cant hit enemies directly in front of you while moving. I'm not asking for you opinion.
---
You don't need to be a Dwarf Priest because ar aid only needs one Dwarf Priest to Fear Ward everyone.
---
You never played the game or what? You think being out of combat makes any difference lol
---
The thing is I did raid MC in Classic and I don't remember going in there with 1.12 talents when it was new or collecting world buffs first or clearing the raid with 20 people or killing bosses in under 20 seconds or any of that stuff. I remember MC being brutally hard because we were complete idiots at the time and didn't know how anything worked yet. If you want no changes then having raids that easy seems like the biggest change of them all to me.
---
Private server? I'm talking about the actual game, not some broken mess held together with sticks and glue.
---
Like I CLEARLY explained above. You cant hit people at normal distance while running without leeway.
---
I went to a swedish school rather than a finnish one because that's my native language. Is that segregation now?
---
Cooldown on layer switch means people's play is restricted by an arbitrary cooldown, just because a 'few' people will choose to abuse a broken feature. 
---
So if someone switches layers to complete a couple quests, then the group drops, and now you see a new group forming for the next batch... you may have to wait for this "cooldown" to finish before having the chance to group up again with other layers?
---
Absolutely stupid.
---
Teldrassil sucks for leveling, it's Darkshore that speedrunners love.
---
I wouldn't call that /thread. That sticker costs $8.76 to me with Shipping (in country). You can design your own and get 10 of them for $9, exactly the size he wants, as I explained in [my comment](https://redd.it/c3yslk).
---
What spec would your shaman be?
---
Do you think Blizzard is just doing layering for the hell of it? They are doing it to stop overcrowding, and they will make as many layers as necessary to do so. Just like sharding works in retail, on xpac launches, where there are thousands of players logging in to the giant megaservers, you still only had to deal with a reasonable amount of people around you.
---
The difference with layering is that it's continent based instead of zone based so you don't get the phasing issues when you move through zones. You wont have nodes and mobs disappearing. Where are you even getting 2.5k in each layer to begin with? Did they say that?
---
So you think a player shouldn't be allowed to keep hopping groups as they drop?  You are an absolute fool if you think the guy you group with will always stick with you for more than a couple quests.  
---
An arbitrary cooldown to punish the majority of players for something few people will end up abusing.  Yea, sounds like the feature itself is to blame at this point if that is the only real solution.
---
sounds like a you problem :)
---
I found classic much easier to get fast times in 1-10, I easily got an hour and 55 mins to 10 trying a route I‚Äôve never done before and wasting a pretty significant amount of time with professions and dying trying to kill a rare. Only thing I noticed that was more challenging on classic was that pets are completely broken
---
They said it can, multiple times lol
---
Holy shit the old sound was so much better. That creaky sound is iconic. The new one is just bland and boring.
---
Why the FUCK did they even bother to change this? All they did was make it worse.
---
LOL, how can you be so uninformed that you don't know how cities are constructed in the game. Have you actually played the game???
---
Much earlier than that. I remember patching in the old gun and bow sounds in MoP.
---
As an ambassador for r/classicwow, I speak for everyone when I say you're forgiven. Just don't let it happen again.
---
I run a hardcore raiding guild that is freshly formed, aiming to be a top guild on our server. We love pvp and take both pve and pvp seriously.
---
The real alternative is:
---
 - To have more realms
---
 - But with common login servers so that character names don't overlap
---
 - So that later the realms can be merged without any problems if necessary
---
haha :D
---
Well instance leveling is specifically good during SM. If you do a few dungeons before that just for quests, and talk a bit, be sociable, then add the competent ones you'll have a good list of people by the time you do SM. Our beta guild (Alpha Beta Fish) has a ton of people (881) most of whom are quite competent. Might not be a bad place to find people who are up to speed for instances if you wanna PM me once launch hits. We're pretty casual, but we've mostly all been playing WoW a loong time. Lots of pserver players and OG vanilla players that have run this stuff 100s of times.
---
Hunters are awful to gear, there will be tons early on and they don't compete very well in raid dps either way.
---
Not if youre black.
---
Omg your opinion is different, dOwNvOte
---
I agree, blizzards implementation of spell batching has made the game feel extremely clunky .
---
What's "bad" about it? That people get better at playing games over time?
---
If you want to play with people who are clueless, join a bad guild.
---
Only 10? It's like you don't even want to raid.
---
merde
---
Yeah like I said. You come raid with them from private server backround.
---
Eather way Im done with topic. Im going 100% solo as I probably wont keep up with 20% because I want to sleep too. I estimate I will save 2days worth of /played and I will ask top guilds to join at that point.
---
If only that case had a Nintendo Switch logo. That would be fucking awesome.
---
That spec is very substandard. I have a good rule for mages that seems hard to break.
---
**Choice 1:** Pick a **31 point talent** and then distribute the **last 20 points in any tree you like**, usually 20 points in 1 other tree.
---
**Choice 2:** Pick **two 21 point talents** and then distribute the **remaining 9 points how you like**
---
**Choice 3:** Pick **a 21 point talent**, and invest the **remaining 30 points how you see fit**
---
One rule you should never break until you are in the top 5-10% of mages, your third tree with the least amount of points should never have more than like 7 points in it. 4/5 imp arcane missiles with 2 in hit comes out to 6, 5 in the fire tree for fire spell stuns with impact, or 2 in frost elemental precision for pvp. If someone challenges this last rule and can reliable defend their position, it just means they outgrew the usefulness of this rule, and I am not sure if it ever stops being true.
---
As for your idea of weaving scorch and frost spells, it really depends on how crazy you play. You can go the kamikaze elemental build of no imp counter spell and no ice barrier, but tons of crit chance and stun procs.
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/-05520201230001-05003220120051](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/-05520201230001-05003220120051) I didn't finish spending points here because after picking up iceblock and blastwave the rest of the points are sort of min-max types of spending, crit chance in fire is pretty much required, I think frost spell range for rank 1 FB/blizz is important. If you don't want to tryhard with rank 1 blizzard keybinds you can skip imp blizzard. You will usually be casting 1 or 2 frostbolts max before spamming scorch and instants. Get Ice shards if you do a lot of shatter combos with 2 frost spells like nova-frostbolt-CoC.
---
If you don't care about really beefing up scorch, (it gains a lot from fire but it's used in every single spec regardless) just go 17 arcane for Imp CS and the rest in frost for Ice Barrier. If you don't like that, do 31 frost 20 fire.
---
No, it isn't like you said. I didn't find them on a Private Server. I found them here.
---
I played a hunter on the stress test till 15. 
---
It feels extremely clunky and unresponsive compared to private servers. Spell batching seems to apply to all actions, makes it feel like i'm playing with 500 ping.
---
Classic wow being hosted by classic cdn
---
The first and foremost reason I wanted Classic was so I'd stop losing progress on private servers that shut down.  Not that I'm in the beta, but if Blizz said "hey, this is all gonna be deleted shortly," I'd feel a lot less like playing.  *Currently.*  But when Classic is released you can bet I'll be on like 18 hours a day, no-lifing it.
---
It's not a lack of interest.  It's a lack of incentive for the effort.
---
It's weird how people think it was the Activision ruined everything BUT you still don't let the game devs touch the game.
---
Surely if it's all fault of the suits, then without their interference changes should be fine?
---
wow movies still is rocking I think
---
Trivializing content is bad, making raids challenging and your preparation tactical and meaningful is good.
---
There's more to being a DPS than scoring high on meters.
---
I need to tweak my nvidia settings.
---
&gt;Have fun farming gold without a Hunter or Mage lol.
---
I think this is going to be true regardless. Gold making gap between hunter/mage and everyone else is insane
---
How many people quit the game because they rolled on a dead or dying server?  LFG and cross realm made the game playable for thousands of people who felt stranded in realms where even losing a few tanks would kill your chances of being able to group up and do dungeons.  Losing our main tank twice to real life killed our guilds raiding potential and mid-late TBC everyone started paying for transfers to more populated realms.
---
Everyone is clamouring for vanilla social structures but not everyone had the same experience, vanilla had the potential to be a very lonely experience if you didn‚Äôt know the ins and outs of server populations and rolled on the wrong server.  
---
We know now that you want to be on the high pop realms and take the bad that comes with that but surely there will be people, guilds and factions deserted if there are no quick ways to bring the populations together to stimulate activity.  
---
People complain about cross realm battle groups being formed and how it changed the rivalry within the server but I fucking rejoiced because the queues actually popped and there were battlegrounds to play again.  Horde queues were over an hour long, the population imbalance was completely one sided and our pvp group basically farmed the alliance‚Äôs will off the server.
---
Staysafe says otherwise and I tend to agree with his logic
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/-055232012100315-05052200100051](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/-055232012100315-05052200100051) 
---
Everything in the far left side of the arcane tree is mostly complete crap except Imp Mana Shield, this spec has the same. You also put 3 in elemental precision, pvp miss chance for spells is 4% IIRC, and you will always have a 1% chance to miss, meaning you need only 3% hit, but you invested in 6% hit. I think  5/5 frostbolt is very important not so much for max rank frostbolts, which are mostly casted on poly'd targets, but for the rank 1 frostbolt casts.
---
I completely agree with you on this. It's unlikely Blizzard will fix many of these bugs, but it's really important that we keep talking about it until they do. Right now, even private servers have done a better job of creating a blizz-like experience, which is pretty ironic. I hope it doesn't stay that way.
---
They do. If you watched the video you linked, you'd understand that they have a reference client from an old package that they compare against.
---
The reference client is PURE 1.12.1, not downscaled Legion.
---
&gt;There is a limit to how many players can be in a given zone(s) and the game still be playable.
---
And that figure is extremely low on classic. Loot x items quest are hellish to do if you have even just 4 competitors, can't even group to finish them faster.
---
They should have updated the original client. You can't tell me security patches would have been more difficult than potentially THOUSANDS of gameplay breaking issues that will have to be sorted out for months.
---
The ONLY way using a modern client was going to be less work is if you just planned on half assing it and never fixing most of the subtle errors. 
---
Oh wait...
---
This sub set its collective dick on fire when they had to wait 2 hours to log in to a 5-level stress test.
---
REEEEE
---
I'm not ready. I've never been this unenthusiastic about playing the game and it's bumming me out.
---
half the quests are loot x items, grouping is not going to help.
---
The two iconic damage dealers. One physical one magical. It‚Äôs fun to watch
---
PvP undead for anti-lock capabilities imo. Skinning and mining while leveling to level your professions as you level. Sell all the skins, save mining materials, at 50ish+ drop skinning and roll engineering for pvp items + fun gadgets, use all your acquired mining materials to level engi up.
---
None are compelling individually, but they should be all together. Now I did bring up on solution which was layering the starting zones only for the first month. Is that not acceptable?

---
Yes I understand that client is pure 1.12.1
---
We don't have access to that. They do. So we can't help them on a lot of aspects on the game currently, and that makes them "invisible issues" to us.
---
Only they can identify every possible aspect. 
---
Do you think they're going to test and fix every aspect of the game against that reference client, more "invisible issues" that have slipped from Legion, when they haven't even fixed simple animations yet... as I've laid out in my post.
---
I can already imagine the fun we have to look forward to.
---
This is actually the plan, I think.
---
They're going to half ass classic but use it as a gateway drug to try to get people back into retail.
---
They'll probably bring back the talent system in the next expansion or something and say "SEE? SEE? Retail has everything you loved about the old game but with all these improvements."
---
Pretty obviously an attempt to just get people back into retail.
---
I‚Äôd hide your game key but that‚Äôs just me.

You just need a sub.

To play Retail up to all level 110 content, you just need a subscription.

To play Classic, you just need a subscription.
---
To play any BFA content, you need BFA and a subscription.

Proudmoore ! Best regards to Immortal King - Easy Raider - Lords of Methusalix !!!
---
Dungeos ate a great part of the game realy fun. But if you realy want to rush your way to lvl 60 you should ignore all of them. I will do every single one with my friends enjoy 100%.
---
(Sorry for my english)
---
Its not about scoring high numbers. It that an essential part of the class is not being used. Like playing a first person shooter but only using melee for kills
---
&gt; To play Retail up to all level 110 content, you just need a subscription.
---
&gt;To play any BFA content, you need BFA and a subscription.
---
How can you do one but not the other? Sorry, I haven't played WOW in a hot minute.
---
Going from fresh 60 with no spell power to BWL gear will literally double the damage of a mage's main hard casted nuke, hit cap him, and throw on top of that 10-15% crit. The mage will overall have more burst compared to the druid, the druid's HP doesn't inflate as fast as the mage's damage. If you get a freecasted frostbolt/fireball, and nova grenade into another hard cast and a few instants that can kill the druid outright. A naked lvl 60 fireball hits for 638.5 and crits for 1,340.85. Fireball has 100% scaling with spell power, so a mage with a 25% chance to crit, stun procs, and a fireball that can do almost 2,400 dmg on a crit has a decent chance to win.
---
I want to get the Scarab Lord title and mount and  full T3 for my warrior.

Every time a new expansion comes out, all the content of the previous expansion gets rolled in to the basic subscription.

Raiding, heroics, arena and hybrid improvements made TBC such a huge upgrade to vanilla for what I wanted to do.
---
I think the understanding of modern content vs what we are demanding for Classic is going to define what people want in a long term MMORPG.
---
That will make it easier to design suitable content that people can chew on for years.

Imo WoW Classic is just the beginning of an MMO revival.

In Pandas I was one of the best geared mages on the server for a while because I got perfect RNG on every single weekly raid of that stupid sha of shadow world boss that replaced the winter pvp zone bosses. I had the best pvp pieces and the 2 PVE pieces I wanted for secondary stats and set bonus IRRC. It was dropping the best gear and I may have won 2 pieces in one day.

Thats just planned realm merges with extra steps

---
If the other comment wasn't super clear it's this.  You could run around Pandaria, Draenor, and the Broken Isles (Legion) even though you never bought those expansions.  You just couldn't get to Zandalar or Kul Tiras or do any of the content added in BFA.
---
Just think, today this would be considered a bigoted song. Press F to **honk**.
---
I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on in this thread lol? He wants more content creators making content based off pserver stuff and less information about actual classic? Well okay
---
From what I understand they aren‚Äôt really implementing spell batching as it was, they are trying to imitate it with some sort of a delay and it‚Äôs having side effects that weren‚Äôt present in vanilla and aren‚Äôt good for the gameplay
---
Raiding only a small part of the game you spend a few hours a week doing you will always have other places to use those abilities, and even then there is more to it than just doing damage, applying your curse/banish/whatever. What separates good players from "bad" ones in vanilla raiding is more about how you prepare, do you have consumes? Are you on time? Are you an asshole? Do you cause drama? 
---
Don't worry so much about how fun your class is to play in raids, most of them only press 2 buttons anyways and again, it's only a part of the bigger picture.
---
Guild Wars 2, SWTOR, or Retail WOW might be more your speed then.
---
It seems most of the things that make Classic what it is are incompatible with what you enjoy.
---
If this is their real motivation, then they will dig their own grave. 
---
They already got a huge amount of hate for their Diablo mobile announcement.
---
History for complaining about classic? Last years I checked they had been asking to return to the old days of vanilla.
---
I did my best. üòé
---
Well for starters if you logged on to do a dungeon quest and it took an hour to form group and another 30 minutes to get to the instance to find out the tank didn‚Äôt have a shield and you wasted 2 hours - as a student - it doesn‚Äôt really feel that bad.  As a father with kid and wife aggro that shit is annoying and ruins the valuable play time.  At least with a limited amount of playing time in retail you are pretty well guaranteed to accomplish something useful.
---
Its wrong, its the cata+ combat range.

I dont have the IQ to compete with the average redditor is this supposed to be a gotcha moment?
---
don't give a FUUCCCCKKKK
---
hrmm, can't remember if IF did or didn't. The Lakeshire one took me by surprised. I usually rez, swim across, skipping going into town but behind it to the gnoll camp and die there, rez again and run to the FP. I noticed Lakeshire wasn't unlocked when I was swimming through. It literally had me go to the dock area to get the exploration xp.
---
Also going into deadwind pass - you'll get the zone entrance but still have to walk in a bit more further for the exploration. I had to run back to it. That's when i noticed the XP value were different, cause that always gave me 110 and instead it was 75 or 85. 
---
on private server, my exploration route 1-10 best is 3hr 10min
---
Jerking it to Pat; your boyfriend is a man of good taste.
---
Only 30% of people hit 60 even on private servers, which are much more hardcore based.
---
Classic WoW is going to have far more casuals than hardcore players. As always, these type of subreddits always try to frame themselves as the majority, when they are a big minority.
---
This applies to all ranged weapons I think since I noticed it applied to throwing knives when playing rogue on the stress test. There is a sound when they hit a mob/player.
---
Yes
---
Stop back pedaling, it's fine to just admit you were wrong and move on. Your original "question" (or incorrect statement) was:
---
&gt;layering isn't implemented to reduce overcrowding (it can't accomplish that).
---
It's to remove server queues.
---
Once again, it *reduces* overcrowding, which you just admitted to but now are trying to backpedal and say *solve* overcrowding.
---
Bring back Ventrilo!
---
Putting the cap on players won‚Äôt prevent some of the exploits that gained attention. The STV chest, for example, doesn‚Äôt have a level needed to open it. You could just corpse walk a level 1 (or however many levels you‚Äôll gain through exploring) to the arena and then find an empty layer to open the chest, still completely bypassing the whole arena. 
---
The best compromise I‚Äôve seen is just limiting layering to zones level 20 or below. Let‚Äôs be honest, most people are going to give up by then so it won‚Äôt be as much of an issue, still allows layering to do its thing while relevant, and prevents some of the exploits beyond those first few starter zones.
---
IIRC it was tested with paladin Vindication, and discovered that mobs had ~100-200 of each stat.  IIRC this was in TBC.
---
The reality is probably that mobs have base stats similar to players of the same level.  IE, a "warrior mob" would have level 63 "base warrior str/agi".
---
First one looks washed out and bland. The shadows make a huge difference.
---
The fucking director of WOW (who's also responsible for WOW Classic) can't help himself from constantly making passive aggressive remarks about the original game and how inferior it is to the current fruits of his loin. He hates the original game. The demand for it is a direct insult to him and his current team. It's a rejection of what they're doing.
---
Humans are humans. They're petty and bitter and emotionally attached to their own work. We know how Activision internally feels about vanilla: "You think you do but you don't." They still believe this. There's a reason they're half assing the EU servers. They genuinely don't think people are going to stick with it or that it's going to be that successful in the long term.
---
The only reason they caved and did it is because retail is bleeding subs and they saw it as a cheap, low effort move to get subs back and think that they can use it as a springboard to get people back into retail.
---
Add more vanilla like features to 9.0, market it as a "return to form," and then when people get bored of Classic, there it is, waiting...
---
When they have tbc sitting right ther, you think they'll develop new content?  Not a snowballs chance in hell.
---
The video literally says GM island is being removed in &gt;&gt;Patch 8.2&lt;&lt;
---
Not Classic. Classic is separate.
---
That was Blizzards plan all along. Now that you have a new sub, why not try the new patch. Seem par for the course.
---
nope world buff stacking exploit has to go.  The cancer pirate server meta is unacceptable.
---
I actually like the NE starting zone. Am i crazy
---
You guys realise the only change you have of this actually happening is if 2-3 languages get grouped together... Or are you actually expecting Blizzard to create 3 realms per language? (PVE, PVP, RP), knowing full well they're already planning for the inevitable population drop off with layering?
---
Did you even watch the video? It's both.
---
I don't think you understand how hard it would be to make 1.12 work with 13 years of security and network infrastructure advancements.

Why wouldn‚Äôt they be out of combat?

I sapped often in classic, am I misunderstanding?
---
Oh yes, the lack of violent crime, nice roads, and actually living near the mountains is terrible.
---
There are equal and opposite frustrations to playing on a low pop server so damn if you do damn if you don‚Äôt.
---
Those are supplementary problems that stem from the main problem that is lack of consistent world.
---
They were hesistant to add dungeons, raids and battlegrounds since they shard the game world... Now they want to add realm-wide layering. And you think the only problem is some exploits?

Historical evidence of every major WoW release since Cata and many others across similar games in the last decade. That's just how so many gamers operate these days. They follow the bandwagon until the bandwagon finds something new to hitch onto.
---
If they fixed the AOE leeway, and melee leeway is actually a bug, then have faith that it will be fixed.
---
Nostalgia google.  
---
Lot of people either forgotten, or new player don't understand how much of a grind Classic WoW will be compared to modern MMO.  
---
And that doesn't include the MMO tourists, who will play for a month just to look around before stopping and moving onto the next MMO.
---
gimme dat sauce for bottom left pic
---
There are a few reasons 
---
1)the time commitment to progress compared to retail is night and day. 
---
2) the anonymity that LFR and LFD allow is not there, meaning if your an ass you‚Äôre less likely to find it easy to find groups. 
---
3) the time to get the gear to raid is much higher than retail due to rn‚Äôgeesus and the lack of welfare epics. 
---
4) getting tier sets is a long slow tedious process due to competing with other classes for tier tokens. 
---
Bottom line the hardcore crowd will hang in there, the casuals will drop like flies within 3-6 weeks. Once the hype/nostalgia wears off.
---
Because that's how it has worked for every single WoW expansion since Cata and most online game releases.

I have played on a private server that had a 5k player boost overnight. I know what it's like and it's not that bad.

But you don't compete with other classes for tier tokens in classic, especially at launch.

&gt;and hits instantly

This is why. If Lightning Bolt has a travel time while Chain Lightning does not. So if you time your Crit Chain Lightning when your Lightning Bolt hits, you do a ridiculous amount of burst damage.

---
The cost to enter is extremely low so for the retail player who is curious they will surely check out what the hype is about.  Modern gamers might have a higher expectation than classic can deliver.
---
 Also, for those that played vanilla, well they played vanilla and have also possibly leveled many toons over the years so the thought of leveling again is not really that exciting.  During the stress test I was running around the barrens thinking twice about wtf I was doing leveling another orc and it turned me off.

For fucks sake...

Here was me thinking this retarded melee leeway was bad enough.

Isn't it August 27?
---
You can go watch any mage/rogue pvp video from vanilla and see with your own eyes this isn't working the same way. If you go do that and still try to argue it is working as intended idk what to tell you.
---
You missed the point. If everyone can see the content, it trivializes it. If *I* can see the content without effort in 10 minutes, I have MUCH less incentive to go out of my way to see it *again* but with.... bigger stats on loot? Why?
---
‚ÄúThe world is a lot bigger if there is unbeaten content out there‚Äù will always hold true. Blizzard said it, and making those 2 dungeons Mythic-only in Legion was the best decision they made it YEARS.
---
Wasn‚Äôt this used in some scientific research or some crap? They used it to simulate an actual plague spreading, someone please confirm.
---
I really appreciate the help. Just to be clear, a highly geared mage without gathering professions will make more gold per hour than a decently geared mage with herbalism and skinning?
---
Not for tokens (until raiding), but for gear in general you do, priests compete with other cloth wearers. Paladins and warriors for mail(until 40), rogues and druids, hunters with rogues and druids(up to level 40).
---
Rerail tourists. That's the full answer. Some of them will love it and stay, others will find it actually challenging and leave. Tbh I think more will stay than Blizzard are accounting for but we'll wait and see.
---
RemindMe! 1300 days "lets see"
---
Yes, but those aren't 'tier tokens', which aren't a thing until AQ40. MC, BWL, and the dungeon set are just normal drops.

People will most likely create a discord for general chat for each realm because of how spicy chat can get. Pserver chat gets real spicy and there's no one to regulate it.

It happens in every game, especially MMO's; its not a slight against WoW specifically. People try a game out, especially if it has a low entry cost. A lot of those people don't stick around, they're just tourists.

It‚Äôs not a private server meta, we most certainly turned in heads and gathered in .org pre-raid to get the buffs back in 2006.

and you still sit there for 5x as long because the quest drops dont stack.

I don't head to duskwood or deadwind pass, so I'm not too familiar with them. Though I know what you're talking about with lakeshire. [I was able to not die in redridge until Canyons.

Unless you're level 10, you shouldn't be getting 110xp from zone exploration. [This](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Exploring) isn't perfect, but it's been accurate enough in my experience.
---
You could always sell me your beta key account :)
---
Well considering that the initial number of people truing out Classic may be 10 times larger than the number that still will be playing after 6 months Blizzard really have to do something unless you want nearly empty server later on, and their something is layering.

Wow, counterspell unstealths it if both happen at the same time? Guess no mages ever thought to try it vs me in vanilla.

The available rank of Chain Lightning at level 40 is Rank 2:
---
&gt; 2.5s cast, 380 Mana, 6 second cooldown, 30 yd range: 277 to 311 Nature damage, jumping to a potential 2 additional targets with 70% damage to the 2nd target and 49% damage to the 3rd target.
---
The available rank of Lightning Bolt at level 40 is Rank 7: 
---
&gt; 3s cast, 165 Mana, no cooldown, 30 yd range: 227 to 255 Nature damage
---
The spell coefficient for Chain Lightning is 2.5/3.5 or 71.42%.
---
The spell coefficient for Lightning Bolt is 3/3.5 or 85.71%.
---
With 476 spell power (not feasible in the Beta), EM + CL2 does an average of 1,664 damage.
---
With 476 spell power (not feasible in the Beta), EM + LB7 does an average of 1,664 damage.
---
I played thru bc and then in mists. I think that was a beyond wolk becuase i dont remeber it being a thing.
---
so I am supposed to get over 400xp for it???? never seen that.
---
I played a Orc Shaman Restoration for raiding and PvP to rank 13.  
---
I was 18 at the time so I had no responsibility and managed a LAN and could no life it for a solid 3-4 years lol.  
---
I will play the restoration shaman again but just enjoy raiding 3 nights a week and some casual pvp maybe to rank 9.
---
I never remember MC being brutally hard, I remember having to wait for people to figure shit out (easy shit) like simply dispelling or moving away from the raid when you get the bomb icon or just moving out of fire raiding down on your head.
---
The real change is that I won't be raiding with idiots this time around :)
---
Obviously
---
I can't get into eso. It's like a Chinese elder scrolls knockoff.
---
the solution is pservers
---
He did as I recall.
---
I'm a hunter main. Always have been. Started the game in 2009, so never got to experience Vanilla outside of private servers. What I want to do is get Rhok'delar and Lok'delar. To me they're the ultimate hunter challenge and the best way to prove myself as a hunter.
---
&gt;lost interest in the Classic beta?
---
beta, it's pointless unless you're making money on views or actually testing.  patience!
---
Lol...you might have a point.
---
Ive heard him say those lines on pservers. I‚Äôm sure he did in vanilla too.
---
It's not really that though. It's the rank of spells available at level 40. 
---
Until you reach 476 spell power, which is simply not feasible in the Beta, Rank 7 Lightning Bolt (level 38) does less damage than Rank 2 Chain Lightning (level 40).
---
Well if Classic is really successful then once the populations have stabilized they may just convert the three layers of the "Argent Dawn" server into Argent Dawn 1, 2 &amp; 3. And they can allow free "server transfer" between the three for a period of time.
---
I was there for the queue days. It was never more than an hour much less four, and those days were few and very far between.
---
stealth have suffered so much over the time due to various bugs and spells acting wrong.. im surprised they haven't gone ahead and removed it completely. 
---
im wondering if the "randomly drop out of stealth" bug is gonna be present in classic since its using the modern client
---
Yeah I hope so. You guys should definitely not roll hunter. Any and all of you. So broken. Stay away. Totally not viable. Don‚Äôt play hunter. So bad.
---
Thank you!
---
Because germans are only a step below brazilians and polish in the cancerous scale in video games
---
Shudder*
---
Confirmed.
---
Black lotus spawn in level 60 zones, layering gone at 60, you freaking moron
---
Frost mage is really cool.
---
Good lol all those reasons are why I want to play classic in the first place there is nothing hardcore about it retail wow is just softcore and has been so for years just felt so hollow compared to what the game used to be
---
If ppl want to quit it or give up oh well go back to retail anytime u want at least we have some options now
---
I'm German. I can read what you wrote. But if I was to answer in french, it'd take me a quarter of an hour since school was long ago and my active french is not really there anymore while my passive french is still servicable.
---
You are *so* right. I could see you looking for members of a group, but I couldn't come with you.
---
If layering plays out how I expect it to, gathering and mining won‚Äôt be as profitable as they used to be. 
---
That pretty much leaves farming to make gold.
---
The cynic is me thinks that blizzard only has a 1.12 client, and not 1.12 source code.
---
This means they have to fuck around to verify accuracy, and will also miss odd things.  If they had the source code, some of these issues would be non-issues.
---
Phasing was introduced in Wrath. The DK starting zone made heavy use of it, for example
---
Think of all the fresh bread to be had though!
---
Is that not against the ToS? Just wondering because it seems to alter the game in a way not intended by the devs. Similar to the bigger boobs situation a few weeks ago.
---
Isn‚Äôt 40 the cap?
---
What else is even on the horizon tho lost arc eventually?  Idk I left wow for bns and im.so happy to be able to come back to classic the mom industry is so dead nowadays it's sad
---
Even ignoring the retail tourists, player falloff is just a common *thing* that happens with every MMO. Some people will realize that (whatever game) is just not for them, will quit, and not come back.
---
Who do you think the current devs are? They aren't the people that designed Classic WoW originally. I didn't say Activision is not to be trusted, I said ActiBlizz. I don't differentiate between the two because there literally isn't a difference. There's no activision and there's no blizzard, there's ActivisionBlizzard. Perhaps you can tell me where this seemingly blind trust in the same developers that brought you BFA comes from, because it's beyond my comprehension.
---
It‚Äôs not worth rioting like it‚Äôs not worth rioting for layering, for QOL change, PvP RP server or if Blizzard decide to put new character model or +20%XP pack after two months for 20‚Ç¨
---
Now do you understand that the language you‚Äôll mainly speak for a character you‚Äôll play for hundreds of hours has a way bigger influence on your experience than having layering in place in low level areas at the launch that will affect your game for a week and yet people are ¬¥rioting‚Äô non stop about this?
---
I just played the last fresh private server launch, and I would much rather have a layered classic experience even with the faults than with dynamic respawns. If a better alternative exists / can be implemented, I‚Äôm all for it. But after playing the launch today I am in no way shape or form going to shit on layering if it provides a vanilla experience for leveling.
---
Pretty much the same. I played a few dagger Rogue specs, and this time around a few mates and I are all taking Humans, so I'll be trying out sword specs. Might be fun trying to get a combat sword spec to work okay in WPvP. Yeah, we'll all be competing for similar weapons (unless I can convince the Pally to take maces), but it's more about taking our time and enjoying the ride this time around.
---
Lapdogs, all of you.
---
Low damage rarely-to-never causes wipes in vanilla. That being the case, buffs that increase your damage are incapable of trivializing most content.
---
Ironically, plenty of guilds did this in vanilla lol...
---
Their word cant be trusted because of their track record over the last decade, you blizzdrone apologists are quick to forget about the past.
---
Don't you guys have memories?
---
That explains why it sounds correct to me as someone who quit during early TBC.
---
In today's clown world, yes, yes it does.
---
If it is indeed like BFA pet mechanics. My hunter on retail I have to have pet attack and all their auto cast skills macroed into every ability on my bars just to make sure the pet stays on the boss and uses all its skills.
---
Every discussion by Blizz about layering seems to mention 3-5 layers or around that.. assuming its capped at 2500 because thats about the server cap for Vanilla. 
---
Even at a 1000 cap with 10 layers, you‚Äôll still have 850 people in starting zones..
---
Layering was meant to combat the influx of players who wouldn‚Äôt stick around. Instead of a 2.5k limit with say 40% of people dropping out pre-60 - they are letting layers increase server size hoping that after the players leave the numbers get back to a normal server size.
---
I don‚Äôt know why people think its going to make leveling easy. Even 300 people in starting zone is a riot.. the difference is negligible.
---
complete lie.  No one stacked all 7 buffs.  Some guilds might like say Ony's head or something for an extra push on nef or something, but that was about it.
---
We'll see who's retarded when the games dead before it even hits phase2 :^)
---
oh this brings back memories. and endless catch phrases for months!
---
It srsly is. I logged into retail today to dabble the free 1-20 (no active sub for me) and the hunter STARTS with a pet, which most ppl probably know by now but I haven‚Äôt created a new hunter since vanilla and I have to say....what a huge disappointment regarding one of the coolest rp elements for the class. It was such a delight to choose and tame your first pet at lvl 10 in vanilla. Often you‚Äôd have that pet forever even if he was just in your stable. Gaining loyalty, feeding your pet, naming your pet...an excellent rp class and indeed very a fun and versatile class to play if played well.
---
Not 7, but several sure. There was plenty of times I got more than one just chilling in storm wind. But they could have, and I‚Äôm sure it did happen at least once. You want classic, world buffs are part of it.
---
Look Jimmie.....
---
Spoken like someone with decades of enterprise level consumer facing programming experience who totally knows what they're talking about.

Hope i see u all in Classic WoW &lt;3
---
yes, the whole point is to avoid merges lol
---
Ty
---
But the cancerous world buff stacking exploit isn't part of Vanilla.  That's from the pirated servers.
---
#nochanges
---
When they started creating Classic on the modern engine, BfA wasnt even launched yet.
---
HOw cAN YoU nOt KnOW ThAT??
---
IF you're within 5 levels of the zone, yes. If you run into Deadwind pass at 50-60, and it's a 55 zone, you should get ~560xp
---
If you run into the zone at level 3, you'll get the xp for a level 8 zone (70)
---
The highest I get from any exploration is 85, when I'm 5 in 10+ zones.
---
You don't have to buy all the previous expansions anymore. You just sub, and it'll give you all the expansions up to the previous one included, you only need to buy the newest most current one in order to be 'caught up' for retail. For Classic, all you need is the subscription (which, again, will give you everything up to the last one, and you can completely ignore whatever current xpac is going on).
---
Ty =]  hope the star wars one is good
---
 I know it won't be as smooth when there is 1000's of people trying to do the same, which is why this is a video that show you the quest I plan to do and in which order.
---
Downvote me, you read what I had to say - I don‚Äôt care if you liked it or not.. that was my point lol.
---
Its liberating making a post saying what needs to be said, knowing people don‚Äôt want to hear it.
---
I really want Blizzard to let people do this, just one time please lol
---
*Phewwwww-CRUNCH*
---
It‚Äôs not an exploit dude. It could be done in vanilla, it just wasn‚Äôt ‚Äòmeta‚Äô. Besides why does it matter? Nobody is getting world firsts on any of this content, most of it has been cleared for nearly 15 years. Everybody knows how to beat every raid, and if you don‚Äôt you can YouTube it in 5 seconds.
---
holy shit that music is bad
---
Haha. I hear you there. I am keeping up with Rogue guides for this reason. If Hunter is scuffed I have Rogue in my back pocket.
---
cool !
---
Name me 1 game has been made out of good faith.
---
I will wait...
---
Money talks.
---
I find that "doesn't matter im always right" part really funny actually. Seems like, what is annoying you, makes me laugh. But he is also very smart and entertaining guy, who is not afraid to express his personality and I find most of his opinions relevant
---
you are right no one will care about normal nodes because they will be literally everywhere on all layers and everyone and their nan will have a nice big healthy stack of herbs at all times and they will all be worthless :^) at least i wont have to play the game and tag mobs!!!!
---
aw, that Jesse Cook song is a classic.
---
My buddy and I are planning on rolling together, he‚Äôs single and i live with my girlfriend. He‚Äôs rolling Warrior and I‚Äôm going Warlock, between our two handicaps we might actually hit 60 around the same time.
---
Well, if this is true, it will be clown fiesta. Hopefully they will make a blue post anytime soon regarding this
---
People gonna cry no matter what.
---
Random question btw, what are you rolling ?
---
Change "the very first server" to "the first server starting with M" and you have a system that is better and was used back then.
---
Ironically I am doing a warrior and he is doing a lock lol
---
Feel free to unmute &amp; use your playlist ;) Problem solved
---
yeah now they are after these vids come out, you go back and look at posts from a few weeks ago the consensus here was very different, you were an idiot, hater or pserver retard whos opinion doesnt matter because pservers are illegal!! :^)
---
So do it maybe? ;)
---
While i dont agree with the rest of your your looney theories.
---
They definitely will take classic features that people actually end up liking and have them influence retail.
---
Wow that's super impressive.  Near the end of WotLK and early Cata I had the best ping of my friends living on the east coast.  
---
I just found https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/7870 which can give some IP addresses to ping and traceroute based on WoW data centre locations.  Getting ~200ms for US West and &lt;40 for Oceanic :D
---
I don't believe they will, that's my point. This is why I won't be rolling a hunter.
---
This is a repost of https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c3noge/petition_language_dedicated_servers_for_europe/
---
but i'm doing it for visibility since the petition has been flagged on official forums, and so is hidden.
---
I could have sworn I had that manual. It's nice of Blizzard to let us download it!
---
What's your point?
---
What bullshit. I need something to read while taking a dump!
---
What about piglatin
---
Basically the moment I started questioning Blizzard's intentions I became stupid? ...
---
Phasing has really nothing to do with it
---
15 years of updates and this is how fucked up it sounds in BFA when you shoot an arrow lol.
---
Wow, I didnt know. Seems like im wearing pink glasses afterall. In my country, kids start to learn english at the age of 3 in kindergarden, which only continues and escalates all the way up to college.
---
I don't see the problem of having a 500-1000 pop server. Blizzard (especially in BFA, but noticed the same trend in Legion) has obsession with packing tons of players and npcs in crowded space. 
---
This decision of having a single EU server speaks exactly why so many people want no changes. Literally every time they make a change, it is pretty bad in some way and they're so clueless EVERYBODY else figures it out before them. Arguing with Blizzard these days became like explaining rocket science to a mentally retarded monkey (no offense to monkeys, I love animals).
---
That is incorrect, the only reason to have layering is to smoothen out the launch experience and has nothing to do with server capacity. It's due to how concentrated the population will be in a select few areas of the world, slowing down the progress of one another and thus extending the life span of these highly populated areas.
---
It's true that layers probably can't be removed on a whim on a per player basis, but you don't actually need to remove the layers like that. After level 15 Blizzard could force you onto a default layer and disable the ability to change layers.
---
Getting invited by someone else would force you all onto the default layer. It would require some work but they wouldn't really need to change the layer mechanic that dramatically, I think.
---
Not competing with other classes for tier tokens is actually **more** difficult. Tier tokens makes it *easier.*  
---
There are 8 classes. If the boss drops 2 sets per run, then the odds of your set dropping is roughly 1/4. On average, you'll get 1 pair of rogue legs from Ragnaros every month. If you're slightly unlucky, make it 2 months for one pair.  
---
When there are tokens, the roll is 2/3 instead of 1/4. You could plausibly get 8 pairs of rogue pants in a month. This also means less loot is wasted, which makes things even easier in the long run.
---
Yes and TBC was the beginning of Dailies, Flying Mounts, and Nerfed Raids, and 25 mans instead of 40...tbc was great but thats when the Aids started spreading. Wotlk Aids was in full force with LFR. And by Cata the game was nothing but a husk because so much rot had taken hold of the company.  WoW has basically no relevance today in PoP Culture...its just a fucking nerd game. Remember in 2005-2006 they had celebrities like Ozzy Osbourne and Mr. T doing commercials for them? What about that? Overwatch is dead....i hate Activision
---
LOL
---
They will though, this the entire reason blizzard wants to do it, so they CAN have 10k pop servers.
---
No changes at work, we did it!
---
Ret Prior esfandOkay
---
from 8 to 16? I think that's a good thing. It's not a change you fucking shill. It's to prevent exploits. 16 or 8 debuff isn't game-breaking. International servers that destroy the community + layering is. YOU THINK YOU WANT CHANGES BUT YOU DON'T . J. Allen Brack is at fault here, I hold him personally responsible.
---
Shhhhhhhh!!!
---
I'm hopefully planning to have a mage alt ready to farm Dire maul when it is released in phase two. Mostly with the intention of trying to farm a quel book for my warrior, hopefully that isn't too lofty of a goal. From what I can google DM was the place to farm for it, but it seems like either East or North are options. Would anyone have any experience from classic on which would be better?
---
it's...not whining? it's literally bringing the issue to attention so hopefully they can be made aware and fix it
---
I've already starting learning Swedish, Polish and German because of this. Thanks Blizzard!
---
I thought DM wasn't going to be around until phase 2?
---
&gt; And yes, some people don't even consider the "launch day congestion" to be a problem
---
because it literally isn't, if you can't handle it you have a bunch of options available to you which don't ruin the game for everyone else. You could stop being entitled and sit in a queue, you could join a lower pop server and tag all the mobs you want or you could just not play the game for the first couple of weeks, the best part is we have distinct planned content releases called phases so you wont even be at a disadvantage if you start a couple weeks later.
---
Don't thank me, i'm a genius i know. Blizzard should hire me /s
---
Imagine complaining about there being issues in a beta test. Yikes.
---
Well there‚Äôs only like four races to choose fr‚ÄîWELL PICK ANOTHER ONE YOU STUPID ASSHOLE
---
Do you even realize how much of a fucking pain it is to maintain two completely separate code bases?
---
‚ÄúOh that‚Äôs a big boy!‚Äù
---
It is an exploit.  Just because it scanned under blizzard's radar 15 years ago when no one used it doesn't mean it's fine.
---
By blizzards definition of exploit, it's an exploit.
---
Could someone explain the ignite mechanic in raids? How is it shared and is it basically RNG who gets it and the one who does just massively outdps the rest? Thanks
---
I don't really want to chase girl for years. That would be absolute waste of my short life. Lets put it like this. I wanted to marry my wife pretty fast because i knew she is the right for me. I didn't wait 10 years just to chase her and not marry because that "slow progress" would have made it somehow more rewarding.
---
Ugh, the right ones are horrible.
---
I haven't heard about what exactly happened with the boobs situation, but I'd assume the difference is that it altered game files (similar to how people got banned a while back for modifying game files to swap races and stuff like that to make their dwarf look like elfs or to make weapons appear differently or whatever).
---
The nvidia control panel stuff is pretty basic and you could probably do comparable alterations with a good monitor, so I'm pretty confident that you're 100% safe from bans if you use just that. 
---
As for ReShade or Nvidia Freestyle I haven't heard of any bans or warnings and a lot of people use it, whether or not it's against the ToS I don't know because it doesn't alter any game files and just does post processing stuff to make it look differently. I would assume if Blizzard has any problems with these kind of programs they will announce it via blue post, because as mentioned earlier they are very popular. That said if you want to be 100% safe it's probably best not to use them.
---
probably feral druid and/or hunter.
---
The only Australian Formula 1 driver even did it when he won a race.
---
I already told you guys...faction up by axis and allies and RP WW2 war crimes 24/7, and they will fix it faster than a petition.
---
It is, but its from cata+
---
No, it isn‚Äôt man. If I‚Äôm not mistaken don‚Äôt you have to clear content for many of these anyways? If you got the kill to turn in, do whatever you want with the buff. Really don‚Äôt see why it‚Äôs a big deal? Maybe they could limit to 3 at a time or something. It‚Äôs honestly a non issue to me though.
---
&gt; By blizzards definition of exploit, it's an exploit.  It's an unintended use of game mechanics to stack all 7 world buffs on an entire raid, and then trivialize raid mechanics.
---
Slow-paced, grindy games do not have mass-appeal.  
---
When WoW was released, it was essentially a casual version of EverQuest. It took about 1/5th as long to level your character as in EQ. You don't lose experience when you die, you don't have to recover your corpse after death, flight paths exist, mounts exist, etc. But times have changed. Warcraft looks and feels slow-paced compared to games these days.   
---
A few years ago, if you saw the re-release of Jurassic Park in theaters, you probably saw some bored 20-year olds in the theater. Kids who were using their phones because the movie was too slow for them. No jump-scare or punchline every 11 seconds? Too slow. (Try watching "Alien" or "Star Trek the Motion Picture", and try to imagine something that slow-paced being created today.)  
---
Times change.
---
I played hunter first time around. Switching up to warrior or rogue this play through, haven‚Äôt narrowed it down yet
---
I'm more familiar with [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBhCky8iKzY) from when there was a bug that made underwear not show on nude player models.
---
Layering is going to cause exploiting and that is all. Why do you people think that hitting level 20 is going to take less than 5 hours? I dont understand how people cant function without layering. Blizzard did not have such cursed words during vanilla. The whole layering is going to cause chests, farming and just the whole experience to crumble once you see people phasing out because the community feels like layering is needed but visually the realm will 'seem dead'
---
It is also 2019. People are able and want to speak english more.
---
What is the intended use of world buffs though? And if you‚Äôre guild is geared enough to get all 7 of them, you‚Äôre already clearing just about everything weekly.
---
The problem is just that Blizzard doesn't know when and how many tourists will leave. From what they are doing they seem to expect that the majority of the playerbase will leave after a few weeks/months and only the very hardcore audience will stay.
---
Layering is not a solution. People will continue to think a realm is dead when they're actually just phasing out of others layers.
---
eso pvp is great if you like pvp
---
And my Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker
---
I could not find the original version with nude models unfortunately.
---
Beta servers are empty, he's not being put on an empty "layer".
---
Stop being a sheep ;s
---
Statistics don't lie.
---
Part of me wants to multibox but I really don't want to pay for 5x accounts. 
---
Also if you are mutiboxing why not run 5 warriors and just stomp on everything
---
They intended raids might use one or two to get over humps.   For example, nef.   They were not designed to be stacked at the same time to trivialize raid content, nor to be used every single raid.  nor dw tanking.  nor splitting your 40 man in half to do 2 clears.  etc....
---
It breaks the entire pve side of the game.
---
The population will go wayyyy down shortly after launch.
---
This sub is such a tiny fraction of the wow population.
---
There are millions of current players. Most of those will try classic in the first few weeks because it's free for them. Most of those will stop playing after a while.
---
The rightmost one is much closer to what you'd have IRL than the left one. The difference in shade between direct sun and the shade of the trees, when you have clear blue skies, is going to be far more stark than that little off-colourness in the left screenshot.
---
That's alright if you feel that way - It's certainly not Skyrim.  But it seems successful enough at putting Elder Scrolls into the MMO genre.  You gotta have the right expectations.  But it's got interesting characters and a world that feels alive like an Elder Scrolls game.  What with all the NPCs and dialog and whatnot.  And you are free to quest in that Elder Scrolls style, in that you can basically travel wherever, and find more folks in need than you could possibly help, so you just do whatever sounds the most fun or whatever.  It's nice when you're not forced to play through zones in typical MMO style, where you kinda pick up a bunch of quests in one spot, do them all, move on, do a bunch more, and you don't usually need to read the quest text.
---
And the combat is getting more interesting as time goes on.  Not to mention it's refreshing to have that sense of danger while leveling (like what Vanilla WoW had).  I've died, oh yes, I've died. And I've played smart and survived many close brushes with death as well.  And it's fun trying to get away with crimes while trying to avoid getting a bounty (this is actually one of the nice things about ESO - in that if you fuck up and get spotted, you can't reload.  If you're going to rob a place, or murder a dude, you gotta be sneaky, or be prepared to fight your way out of the situation and be left with a hefty bounty to wait out or pay off.
---
Sollution: Open more servers. We don't know yet how many servers Blizzard plans to open exactly but it seems to be not very many. The US will easily be able to fill up 30 servers which would be 90000 people playing concurrently on peak times with 3000 players per server.
---
But from what all they are doing they don't seem to think Classic might be a success which is probably the reason for the slim server lists.
---
Ah, someone parodying Weird Al for once. Interesting.
---
Yes but i'd prefer the evil we're used to as opposed to the evil we don't know. So what, server is packed, big fucking deal. Wait a couple days, put it on a stream, more people will come, the game will blow up even more just like in 2004
---
Current WoW seems more grindy. I have never played it but as far as I understand, you get update each patch and your equip  becomes irrelevant every 4th month. I also heard something about continual farming Mythic+ during legion, because you had to, to stay relevant. Did I get this wrong? I dont know. However in vanilla, you can leave your character for 6 months and still rock, due to items from MC and even dungeons being quite similar to ZG/BWL. In this matter, vanilla is not grindy at all, its actually quite relaxing. Not to mention all the catchup mechanics in AQ / Naxx release, that helps you to get on track faster.
---
Not everyone raids.
---
Even lower. I still remember Onyxia runs where our Alliance raid got  shaman set pieces. 
---
Also armor class was less important in classic. A cloth/leather/mail piece could also be best in slot for plate wearers. A paladin trying to gear all his speccs could pretty much pick up anything not strickly class restricted and not a gun/wand. 
---
It's one of the reasons I like DKP. You usually save your points and don't even try to start a bidding war with half the raid when you can pick up a healing plate or mail for peanuts.
---
Their health bar will still make it look like they are dead.
---
Thank you for posting this. Love Kevin Jordan and I wish that the whole WoW community would watch his stuff. His twitch channel is amazing. Nothing like your Asmongolds or shrouds or whoever. Calm, thoughtful, insightful stuff about the game we love.
---
Go enjoy the summer, get a tan and an ice cream then come back by the end of August and roll the dice. 
---
WoW is amazing no matter what class you play
---
Actually , I can see your point now. Considering all that, I think you should be able to hold 2 of them, and if a new one is applied it should replace the one with the least amount of time left. How would you feel about that?
---
FD isnt supposed to always work.
---
ARCANITE REAPER HOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
---
The ratio of people who raided to didn't will be around the same. Creating the same outcome.
---
Spell batching is currently too slow. It's set at 400 ms when it should be around 200 ms or so.
---
There also seem to be some other systems tied to slower sever heartbeat, that weren't batched in vanilla. Auto-loot is just one example, it is super laggy on the beta.
---
Thats exactly why I never put serious time and effort into private servers, wow is a slow burn game and classic even more so, feels shitty to play a game like that when your progress could be wiped at any moment
---
I think, blizzard is aiming to have 6-7k people per server
---
Something isn't "nerfed" if comparing a feature in an official game to a pserver emulation.
---
Why should anyone have faith when blizzard seem dead set on implementing shitty mechanics like layering for the sake of the "tourist" population, not the actual players.
---
Blizzard is 100% sure that the playerbase will drop so much we will have "normal" level pop servers after a couple of months, you are asking me to have faith in a bunch of people who don't even have faith in the product they are delivering and think it's going to die.
---
If for some reason the data and code of the reference is not accurate to actual 1.12 then there is no good reference and Classic WoW can only hope to be as authentic as the private servers, which would suck. But I have no reason to believe that Blizzard doesn't have a proper 1.12 reference. 
---
I just don't know how extensively Blizzard is using the reference in their testing. They've clearly done a lot of cross checking with it but evidently some things have been missed and brought to their attention by the community.
---
\&gt; what if the reference client seems right, but the beta were demonstrably  wrong vs. the reference client in things blizzard has no excuse for not  having corrected? 
---
Then they can correct it. Seems fairly self explanatory. But the best way in my view to ensure that inconsistencies are at a minimum come launch day is to get as many good \*testers\* as possible to comb through the reference client and 'Classic' to find them.
---
I wouldn't even be mad really, 200 ping was never a huge deal for wow compared to other mmos
---
That's exactly what they want you to do. Keep that sub going until Classic and buy BFA on top of that. But wouldn't it be more satisfying to ignore retail entirely and only sub in august to show your interest is only for Classic? The bigger the spike in subcount for Classic, the more they will support legacy realms over modern WoW. Let's vote with our wallet on this one.
---
Same fam terrible night horrors all around. Ruins my day on a regular basis
---
Retail has a large player base, and Classic will be free for Retail players to try. It's basically a given that a *ton* of them will give it a try since it's basically 100% free for them. Why *wouldn't* they try it?
---
...on the other hand, obviously, there's a lot of things about Classic that are different than Retail (that's why people are looking forward to Classic!) and a lot of those things are QoL changes or content.  There's a lot of very valid reasons why current Retail players may not like Classic, or at least choose to play Classic (eg, maybe they just love DKs, or blood elves, or maybe their guild is staying Retail, or maybe they have fond memories of playing Vanilla in uni, but they have a job and kids now, and don't have the time to play Classic, whatever).
---
I mean, every WoW expansion has the same pattern, with login queues at launch, slowly emptying out.  That's how it works.
---
TL;DR:  Basically every Retail player is going to try Classic when it launches.  Most won't stick around. Which is fine; it'd be absurd to think that Classic is going to *literally* steal every Retail player the second it launches...but since it won't, that means there's going to be a big dropoff in player counts.
---
Nothing, i ended up with a full Redemption armor set at the end of vanilla, apart from that DAMN ring that only dropped once, so i must have been doing something right
---
Nah by time that happens I'll be high enough lvl not to be ganked.
---
fucken oath mate dreamtime brother
---
What part of NO FUCKING CHANGES! did you fail to understand when you made this post?
---
Hi,
---
I would like to pledge myself to the cause, as I have many attributes, which, I think are befitting a moderator on any subReddit, but especially the kind of character I have found to be true of this staff. If we are being honest I see a lot of myself in you. A lot of similar traits to my own.
---
This then, I offer my services.
---
No english is bannable
---
No if the server is still over populated it‚Äôs a terrible idea.  
---
Better idea:
---
You can only change layer in a resting zone.
---
Lived this life as well for about 6 months. Upgrading to 512mb of ram was the best feeling since I could enter IF and use flight paths.
---
GL finding your friend in Felwood.
---
*fart noises*
---
You're spot on dude.  The previous poster is mistaking limitation for flavor.
---
These conversations, once classic has been out for a few months, will be more and more frequent.  Not just "What made Classic great?" but "What are the few ways in which the expansions made Classic better?"  And can we pick and choose?
---
Blizzard has straight up said(you can look it up, I'm too lazy, but it's out there) that it will only be active for a short period. Exactly what the top comments have said, except the Blizzard dude said there will be NO layering AT ALL eventually.
---
Why is using the search function such a big deal?
---
Very dumb answers without thinking about Blizzard, WoW Classic is a business. Millions of people will try it who don't even play Retail. People who haven't played the game in years and people who have never played WoW period, now you want these people to not be able to play the game? Awful business decision and will never happen.
---
The more people that play the game the better the health of the game in the future, don't be selfish and ruin the game population so you can have your 'community' in the first month
---
Such a crappy fucking system
---
It's funny because this almost never happens and whenever I see a carebear crying about it I just think yeah, you are probably the one camping lowbies.
---
I remember when they launched language specific servers they offered mass character migration for free.
---
Learn English.
---
Because every single BfA subscriber will have access to it. A fraction of them will enjoy it and stick around. That's potentially millions of tourists.
---
Yeah, YouTube's system changing is the biggest factor. The old system rewarded you for making a video as popular as possible, the new system rewards you for making a channel that gets as many minutes watched as possible. That change killed any channels that weren't able to pump out daily content
---
I mean the answer changes a bit with time.  Right at the beginning of a new raid tier expect herbs to skyrocket in price, and early in the expo when everyone is saving money for their mounts raw gathering mats are usually super cheap.  In general however, any class can be an effective gatherer, only a well geared mage can grind elites and aoe the things that other classes cannot.  Generally that means less competiton, and higher prices.  
---
For example, not really geared, but early on a progressive private server I found Tyr's hand solo farming to be far more effective then mining, and while I didn't yet have herbalism the price for herbs was terribly low as the market had not matured enough for the average player to be spending gold on consumables.
---
So phase 1:  Mats are probably going to be ultra low price, since every player needs to gold dump 1k for the mount.  Elite grinding almost for sure better
---
Phase 2: Ok, average joe getting into MC consumable prices should go up, but not it is the pvp patch so your alt will get pooped on, and you will likely want to be on your geared mage in world pvp as much as is humanly possible  This is the part will being geared+having a gathering profession is profitable and fun.  
---
Phase 3: BWL open, here herb prices will start to skyrocket, and at this point maybe herbs is better then strict farming for most classes, but for mage and hunter elite grinding is probably still at worst on par
---
Phase 4:  ZG, low point in herb as consumables are not as needed.  Mages can now Bijou farm crocs in the water.  
---
Phase 5:  Herb prices go back up with AQ gate, but a lot of gold can be made aoe grinding lower level stuff for the turn ins, as well as griding the NPCs in silithus
---
Phase 6:  The argent and crusade marks require drops from all over the world.  I found savage frond farming in DM east insanely profitable back in vanilla.  Dark Iron bits in beginning of BRD can also work.
---
You are absolutely correct, but the core problem is that it is hard to predict the numbers.
---
It‚Äôs not. Your Edginess is lost on me. Try again.
---
if you can't handle the fresh experience you have a bunch of options available to you which don't ruin the game for everyone else. You could stop being entitled and sit in a queue, you could join a lower pop server and tag all the mobs you want or you could just not play the game for the first couple of weeks, the best part is we have distinct planned content releases called phases so you wont even be at a disadvantage if you start a couple weeks later.
---
I'd even argue that MORE players will raid in Classic this time round than before.
---
Nice! Hope to see you both out there.
---
Also, the 2nd best buff comes from fuelwood.  There's a plant you cleanse, and then you can click on it and get a buff.   However, if multiple people click on it at the same time, then everyone can get the buff.  This is jus an outright exploit.
---
Ya, I was there on the main Zerg. I didn't take 5hours for people to get to 3-4. But maybe that was the case for someone who didn't know what to do.
---
Irrelevant. Classic is and always will be based on whatever the current version of the game is.
---
People seem to forget that layering will be removed after x months. So it is a non issue anyway.
---
Besides the auction house is still server wide right? Not layer specific.
---
Saying it might is a lot different than saying it will.
---
go to a different server, stop ruining the game for everyone else because you can't be bothered to fight for mob tags or sit in a queue
---
I don't even think 60% is that high of a guess
---
It should always work in PvP.
---
Thats cool for them :P
---
I know what your going to say about the last 10% that ends up on the german server.. Well they just need to roll a new toon i guess;P
---
It's not a bug, it's an intended mechanic that was in the original game as well, as a mean to compensate latency. Is it still relevant today, that's up to debate.
---
Also a possibility is you were pulling too much at once. Deadmines has very few pulls that have to be more than 2x elites. And that‚Äôs ignoring cc options (sap/poly).
---
Ya this doesn't look good. Its going to make the game look very laggy
---
[Change.org](https://Change.org) does nothing.
---
neither were ever that profitable anyway. Besides classic never had a supply issue when it comes to consumable. I doubt gold/hr will change much
---
At least you're honest about whats important, don't tell me you work for blizzard as well? :^)
---
Yes I figured that as well, the game will have more educated players with even more raiding. Even with layering as a crutch the economy is gonna be rough to level out.
---
Each layer will be the size of a normal server which is somewhere in the 2k-3k range. As retail players give up on the game they will strip away those layers until only one remains and voila you're left with an authentic 2k-3k cap.
---
I don't get it. Why is AoE or ranged leeway a good thing, but melee leeway needs to be fixed? Aren't they exactly the same thing, a mean to compensate latency? Isn't it incredibly biased to allow one but not the other(s)?
---
Except it isn't going to be Blizzlike *without* layering, either.
---
If they are expecting people to do THIS much in depth work to test the beta, then maybe they should get rid of the sub requirement.
---
Which is what I am implying if the 5 layers of people farming x material for 5x the amount of played they will be a fairly similar price. Even if layering is never removed because to many people keep playing the economy will be fine.
---
I don't know, why are language-based servers such a problem so that they have to be removed, unlike how it worked back in the day? 
---
I know people from back then I still play with, have met in real life, and even met people later in school who I played against that I didn't know of before we talked about WoW. 
---
This is a direct result of localized servers, if I was on a multi-country server this most likely would've never happened, or have been significantly harder.
---
My mates are coming over on the 25th we all have two weeks off work! So this will be epic!
---
Ya I'm fine with them putting a beta in and expecting the players to do some work. The sub requirement is the thing that just floors me
---
When has a change.org petition ever worked? Lol
---
Good suggestion, but not gonna happen. Apparently (Staysafe said he got info from classic devs), it's impossible to implement layering any other way than "all or nothing". So, it's impossible to have layering only for certain level ranges or for certain zones, or whatever else logic you would suggest.
---
&gt; I'd rather blizzard took a strong stance on the no-lifer farming behaviour and went to town on those trying to manipulate the auction house early game.
---
Imagine actually wanting players punished for playing the game.
---
Felwood 
---
Ungoro 
---
WPL
---
Ashara 
---
Yes it becomes harder but normally you don‚Äôt log off in those zones.  So grouping you fly to the closest inn.  And you fly winter spring close by.  To switch to his layer.  
---
Since when leveling you always log off in inns you can switch there.  
---
The only thing that could impact is DC that could be solved by server remembering last layer for 30min
---
Nostalrius\*
---
I live in England, so no.
---
This episode actually made me go out and buy WoW
---
I mean we have 1.12 talents and abilities, items, an upgraded UI (raid frames etc) and graphics (particles etc). It's closer to a remaster now than anything.
---
Lots of remastered games don't even change this much stuff.
---
&gt;Are you telling me that they‚Äôre not used to people speaking in different languages in their every day lives?
---
Yes. 
---
The vast majority of the populations of the large countries - Germany, France, England, to a lesser extent Italy and Spain - don't and often can't speak more than one language in their every day lives. 
---
I'd recommend using r/nostupidquestions for this type of post in the future.
---
Why not just keep it in one topic then? Why does every hick out there need to make the same topic over and over and over again?
---
I'm not against discussions, I'm against the flood of identical topics saying the same shit 40 times a day. Any good points made are buried so much shit that they'll never see the light of day.
---
The layers and the language servers
---
Would be better than 40 identical posts about layering a day.
---
I rant because i care
---
Are these game settings or?
---
So, when I played on the classic stress test a few days ago I asked a couple of friends whether they could see my hunter's quiver on their screen. According to them they couldn't, and when I noticed other hunters unsheathing their bows in front of me I couldn't see their quivers either. Is this a bug or just a vanilla thing?
---
Multiboxing with 5 is a whole different ballgame than just dual boxing two characters.
---
Salute to the fellow Dentarg player!
---
go to a different lower pop server or wait out the launch for 2 weeks instead of fucking up the entire game for everybody with your entitled "wahhhhhhhh i cant tag a mob :(((" bullshit
---
Not enough apparently ive ranted for half my life about this game
---
Pretty impressive right? Imagine, selling more copies in 24 hours than any of its predecessors, it's truly a marvellous feat that Blizzard will cherish for eons to come. Diablo 3 is truly a wonderful game.
---
I want to do with either 5 different melee, or 5 warlocks. The idea of the melee group is if they are all white hitting a target it will die, any buttons I press is just bonus.
---
That's actually pretty sad because GM Island was the spot for, well, GMs - back when GMs actually went around in-game to help players in need. The last GM I saw in-game was in Legion by accident in the Rogue Class Order Hall, the guards there somehow knocked him out of invisibility mode.
---
In addition to what everyone else mentioned, you also have launch day/week hype where people play significantly more hours than they normally would, even if they do end up sticking around. That just compounds on the tourists/attrition.
---
They obviously know its wrong. They have a 1.12 reference client to check this stuff. You people are just bombarding them with useless bug reports
---
Hence why I'm asking about interesst in it since I have come up with a way to play it and deal good dps with about the same mana usage per second as a fire mage.
---
I can't wait for them to pick a random day during the middle of classic where paladins can 1 shot raid bosses.
---
Classic coke will always be superior a superior formula to New Coke in 2004 and in 2024. Identical results in the modern market, why else would they bring it back?
---
Exaggeration. Gnome's hitbox is exactly the same as any other race except Tauren, that is 3 yards, and their melee reach is 2 yards for a total of 5 yards. That is 7.66yd **with melee leeway** so smaller than arcane explosion's range (10yd) **without leeway**.
---
Uhh...just make 1 big german server and one big spanish server? just 2 servers they can do that easily...
---
I thought spell batching was only about casting spells though? Not getting hit by them?
---
When you get dark pact at 40 you can use imp as a mana battery to dot up multiple mobs and drain health
---
Imo it's not that big of a deal as most streamers make it out to be. Look at [Kripp](https://www.twitch.tv/nl_kripp), his stream is like 20-40% dead air &amp; hes near the top the charts of whatever game he plays. I realize he may be an exception but I think it's proof there is an audience for people being themselves &amp; not the non-stop gab machines a lot of streams portray themselves as.
---
What do they do?
---
Hahaha Holy shit. I was reading a post about druids doing less damage, and it being the correct numbers. All I could think was "the rich get richer and poor get poorer"
---
Of course not, but the hype for classic will be like this hype was for CS, and let the land parties begin!
---
Remember people wont wait for you to pickpocket :) So it will be difficult to pickpocket before the mob is dead, also you need to hit level 4, which will take some time.  
---
1 hour spent leveling will make you reach like level 7 or 8, and you might be able to buy a cheap green weapon for a few silver.
---
Or wait out the layering for two weeks instead of fucking up the entire game for everybody with your entitled "wahhhhhhhh its not perfect vanilla :(((" bullshit

---
Apparently I am the only one who likes when we all just mix on the same server.
---
No they don't, they don't speak English.
---
So hold on, you decide to play a different main, because Hunters have bugs while the game STILL beeing in beta? Allrighty then
---
Less and less players the more near launch, it's common
---
Start the petition...layering above 20 should be out.
---
I think I‚Äôm out of the loop here. What is layering and why is it bad?
---
I hear no difference between 1.12 and classic? Maybe because they aren‚Äôt side by side. It sounds the same to me.
---
My biggest gripe with all of this is that they are demanding a 15$ sub from the people helping fix all these issues.
---
I was playing on a German (EU) realm while Legion! And the latency was great! Less than 120ms from Alabama.
---
It's in the game at launch, nothing we can do and I don't want a 50k que anyhow
---
Simple and elegant solution. Plus you've probably now got a bunch of people who subbed for the stress test so it's not like you have to hand out beta invites to people who don't have subs.
---
Or they could just make it apply to the starting zones (Tirisfal, Elwynn Forest, Durotar etc). Once people move out of these zones, there should be only 1 shard.
---
There wont be any EN servers. They will be EU with no language enforced in public channels. Other than the private servers, everybody is free to speak however they like. It will be a huge clown fiesta.
---
Many of these bugs are also present in BfA and haven't been fixed in years... Most of them are going to be there at launch.
---
This is in my Spotify playlist today still :)
---
Not true, they can vanish into Sap.
---
I don't understand what you are talking about. Melee range is the normal 5 yards (6.95 yards for male tauren) + 2.66 yards from melee leeway. There is no "double leeway".
---
It does not, a lot of people are talking smack when they never played Vanilla, you guys will see, the best rogue vs the best shaman, the rogue will win.
---
Now we know your cd key and can take your account muhahhahahabah
---
That would be seriously terrible for hunters. Ohh well. Druids melee attack supposedly does even less damage than on private servers. Good thing we no longer have to suffer under the oppressive MIGHT of feral dps /s
---
Imagine the main language on your US server changed from english to spanish. The quests, all game text and so on is now in spanish. 
---
Its also annoying with a global with alot of language you dont understand. 
---
German, french, spanish and some other language speaking players used to get their own servers. Now they will not get that, for them it‚Äôs a clear downgrade.
---
Not true. They can vanish into a sap. Then brake a totem with an auto attack, wait untill dot comes off and they STILL have enough time to re-stealth.
---
There is long time downsides for literally THE ENTIRE GAME because YOU personally cannot log in or tag mobs, thats a YOU problem. 
---
Layering has potential to cripple the game, even if the long effects are half as bad what they could be, it's still fragmenting players during the most crucial time, the start &amp; leveling experience.
---
If you could see beyond your own ignorant view of the world you'd understand just how retarded you sound, probably why you have no rebuttal to begin with, nothing to add beyond QUEUES BAD BLIZZARD GOOD.
---
Nothing is more embarrassing than change.org petitions.
---
It's about 3gb if you have retail installed. I think more if you don't
---
Oh wow i forgot 1 skill from 15 years ago, im clearly horrible and never played vanilla :D
---
Yes its in there but should it be? Why not just have a MASSIVE epic event? HUGE...
---
Non-EN Realms currently make up 49% of the European playerbase in terms of level 120 characters. This gives you a great foreshadowing of what is to come if you put everyone and their mother on the same realm.
---
A shaman video shows a shaman winning fights? No way!! I thought PVP videos were filled of loosing fights. You can do the same thing with Rogue and find a rogue that decimates any shaman. This proves nothing.
---
Almost
---
No changes people, this is what you wanted.
---
Just because you don‚Äôt speak a language doesn‚Äôt mean that you‚Äôre not used to hearing other people speak it in your every day life. You from the EU? Or just talking out your ass?
---
Yeah, if you have the achievement, you should easily be able to get it back.
---
Oh because i forgot about 1 skill 15 years ago? Yea okay :D :D
---
Not even that IMO.
---
The initial starting zones (Elwynn forest, Tirisfal, Durotar, etc) should have layering. Once you get beyond the first zone it should be a single layer.
---
Why would I have to imagine the game text from from English to Spanish? How is that relevant?
---
Indeed, boggles my mind that people believe that they will somehow remove melee leeway now that they implemented aoe leeway.
---
To me it just reinforces that melee leeway is working as intended and is here to stay.
---
Lets start off with downvoting my comment is utterly pathetic lol. Second of all, all classes have bugs.
---
Check Dream analysis..apokalyptic dreams mean you are afraid of big changes coming in your life or if you are processing losses in your life.
---
I dreamt of an alien apolaypse due to my last and final law exam to come...
---
Redditors just need something to complain about. First it was #nochanges, then it was streamers/blacklists, and now it's layering. At launch, it'll be something else, and it'll keep changing to help people feel victimized.
---
It's funny because what happened to Thanos after this is what will happen to classic in about a year or two.
---
because people would be waiting for hours to get on anyhow. Can't do a massive event
---
&gt; It has a lot of potential for murder....
---
hahah u r right. lol
---
True, but honestly, "meet me at the inn" would have some charm. Would feel like most rpgs' campaign start.
---
it's almost like eng-fr eng-de eng-sp speaking people are so rare and ask for a very high salary... well no speaking those languages brings only a low salary actually
---
The batching probably affects players and mobs differently. If the guy aoe farming to 30 actually used blizzard which I mean you kinda have to there is no way he did it with it functioning like this on mobs. This is however still a very serious PvP problem.
---
Is it true in reality?
---
aaaaaand RIGHT CLICK
---
Dumb comments get downvoted, that's what the button is for. Also, none of the classes in the beta are nearly as buggy as the hunter. If you want to play one that's fine, just know that you'll be shooting yourself in the foot.
---
I'm certain thousands have cried out for beta access. Surely you would think they'd allow more players to build even more hype?
---
I thought we were going for ‚Äúno-change‚Äù? Wtf is blizzard doing now?
---
I played retail and hated the fact that sometimes I can‚Äôt see my friends
---
Society not just reddit.
---
"I'm not entertained by Trump."
---
"Wow, you like Trump. Hey everybody! This guy likes Trump! He's a Trump supporter!"
---
Yikes. This nonsense has even trickled into the WoW subreddit.
---
&gt; Layering has potential to cripple the game, even if the long effects are half as bad what they could be, it's still fragmenting players during the most crucial time, the start &amp; leveling experience.
---
You have literally no idea how layering actually works. Please, educate yourself before you make yourself look even more ignorant.
---
&gt;If you could see beyond your own ignorant view of the world you'd understand just how retarded you sound
---
The lack of self awareness here would be funny if it wasn't so sad.
---
&gt;probably why you have no rebuttal to begin with
---
I quoted you, but changed the places. So, again, the self awareness is hilarious. But, I'll humor your and rebut your "argument".
---
&gt;a different lower pop server
---
You in six months: "YES I SAID THEY SHOULD MAKE MORE SERVERS INSTEAD OF LAYERING, BUT IT'S BULLSHIT THAT THEY'RE SERVER MERGING NOW THAT THE CASUALS HAVE FALLEN OFF"
---
&gt;nothing to add beyond QUEUES BAD BLIZZARD GOOD.
---
nothing to add beyond BLIZZARD BAD AND I HAVE NO ACTUAL SOLUTIONS
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter if it should be or not. It will be. The quicker everyone accepts that the quicker we can focus on ways to minimize the damage layering does.
---
Rather than trying to fight it, work with it to see if there is anything we can do to mitigate layer hopping abuse. Or other problems with layering.
---
Of course you could always bang your head against the wall and try to get them to remove it.
---
&gt;Just because you don‚Äôt speak a language doesn‚Äôt mean that you‚Äôre not used to hearing other people speak it in your every day life.
---
Not only does it mean you're not used to hearing it spoken, it means you're not used to hearing it sung because even McDonald's has a your-language-only playlist. 
---
&gt; You from the EU?
---
Yes.
---
&gt;Or just talking out your ass?
---
I would ask you the same but I *really* don't need to.
---
You would think, but I think they are using it as a quality vs quantity deal and trying to get solid feedback. I think the streamers shitty or not was the only part of hype usage out of beta
---
Reading the comments in this thread is indeed mind boggling. Ranged leeway is suddenly fine but melee leeway isn't? While they're exactly the same thing. Wait what? ¬∫_o
---
They thought they did, but they didn't
---
As it gets closer to launch, a beta invite becomes less valuable. So many people have watched streams of the content already and vicariously experienced it.
---
Even if I got a beta invite right now, I'd have maybe a good month to play around with it. After that we'd be 30 days to release, and I'm not going to want to grind for hours on a character that is going to be deleted in a few weeks.
---
Thats all assuming the beta goes until release day, which it won't. I'd be shocked if they don't close it within the next 30 days.
---
I think some discussion about this already started yeah.
---
Any unauthorized ass touching must be reported immediately to the council
---
The mobs on pservers give about 10-30x more than what they do on classic.
---
On the test the kobolds we‚Äôre giving 1-4 copper. On pservers they give 10-50 copper. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll be getting 88 silver in an hour on classic launch doing that. GL if you want to try.
---
If you *absolutely have to play* WoW and can't play any other video game, at least wait until Tuesday (8.2).
---
BFA will be... slightly... less shit. 
---
I mean, its still shit. But 8.2 is just ever so slightly less so.
---
No it wouldn't, there's actually stuff to discuss about layering
---
I canceled my sub when classic beta went down. I also left a comment with the reasons which I won‚Äôt be playing retail. If you unsub, please do the same!
---
Server 15 horde, we got to level 15 5hrs from launch questing. Shaman was first followed by two mages.
---
Restrain layering to lvl 1-20 zones instead.  There is still abuse possible with the agm chest if a lvl 1 can still switch layer in the stv arena.
---
Everyone can use the client they like in the server they like. Are you serious? Plenty of people play on german servers with the game in english for instance. The display language of the game is not in any way shape or form related to the serverd language.
---
&gt; You have literally no idea how layering actually works. Please, educate yourself before you make yourself look even more ignorant.
---
lul okay
---
&gt;nothing to add beyond BLIZZARD BAD AND I HAVE NO ACTUAL SOLUTIONS
---
Because picking a different server, waiting in a queue or just not playing the game for a week aren't actual solutions no ofc. 
---
This is your brain on reddit... or is this just your average american?
---
Layers are definitely smaller than servers. This will cause multiple layers per single server to reduce the strain on the servers. As you could imagine this could mean a single server could have double triple or more times the amount of x resource available to one servers players. 
---
Moving away from resources
---
The real problem with layering isn‚Äôt just about resources or impacting game mechanics which it obviously does. The real problem is that it kills immersion
---
Yes. Immersion. Yeah the graphics are crap for today. Yeah it‚Äôs a total fantasy. But seeing people just disappear seems game breaking and definitely breaks any immersion there. Like people would have reported it as a bug asking why half of the worlds players disappear when they get invited to a group
---
World of Warcraft was a world that sucked you in and incited a desire to compete with the people in the world
---
If the people I was playing with in 2005 were to randomly disappear when my friend invited me to a group I would have never met them. I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to see that we were all doing the same quest. I wouldn‚Äôt have grouped up with them and formed friendships that‚Äôs lasted longer than ten years. We still jump on wow sometimes but we‚Äôve generally moved on the other games in the recent years.  None of us really have a single reason or a point where the game turned to shit. It just got whittled down and we stopped talking to the other players. We didn‚Äôt have to. Like an inexperienced craftsman trying to make the perfect knife. Sharpening and grinding away the ripples and hammer marks to remove all the ‚Äúimperfections‚Äù
---
This results in a game with no character and no material left. The metaphorical knife has been ground down to a stub. Sad in comparison to the beautifully flawed original blade 
---
My friends and I are coming back for classic but I doubt we will raid hardcore. Now I‚Äôd love to but it depends solely on one thing. Player interaction. To be able to justify dedicating hundreds of hours  of my free time to classic I will have to develop meaningful relationships with the other players in game. I really really doubt that will be the same with layering 
---
I don‚Äôt care if it takes ten minutes to find a boar let alone get the tag. Myself. Alone. What that will do is highly encourage me to communicate with the other players so I don‚Äôt waste three hours on one quest. With layering this goes away completely and people don‚Äôt make friends. Without friends people don‚Äôt get heavily invested and the game dies. That goes for both modern and classic
---
Yeah, I didn't mean in classic. That is kind of irrelevant now, despite nochange camp. What I meant was that I was under the impression that for WoW Classic we get 4 realms per region which I thought was already mentioned by blue a while ago.
---
Alternatively, I found this, which kind of support what I thought. https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/there-will-be-at-least-5-servers/165261
---
Looks like there may be 2 pvp or pve realms and I doubt that there will be "defacto *insert nation here* unofficial server". They would have to be extremely lucky to get small english audience and large national audience, but only from their own country.
---
Beta? or private server? i have heard that there are major discrepancies for pickpocketing between the two, (beta is much stingier), but I am not sure if that's in general, or if it's just due to the rogues manual price discrepancy. 
---
Also, I will note.... minor health potions are basically free. Every alchemist needs to make about 50 of the things (peacebloom is by MILES the worst herb in the game, and it's the only efficient way to use peacebloom without wasting tons of earthroot). And they vendor for 5 copper and have a 2 minute cooldown. Any alchemist who knows what they are doing would be ecstatic to sell them as quickly as they can make them up to about level 10. 
---
Honestly, if you want potions, just start clicking around goldshire, until you find a guy with potion buffs (the mark of an alchemist). Whisper him "can I buy a stack of minor healing potions for a silver?". I bet you get like a 30%+ acceptance rate. And only that low because alchemists can give elixirs to non alchemists.  
---
Cool that you are getting value out of pickpocketing, I can never be bothered personally. When I learned you couldn't get junkboxes until about level 20 mobs, I just gave up on it and run at mobs screaming once I have sword proficiency, and run up behind neutral mobs and backstab them before that point.
---
Why a group?
---
Current WoW is *not* grindy at all; that's what turns many people off.  The catchup mechanics are **VERY** strong, and it's just crazy fast to gear up, or catch up after a break.
---
Yes, your gear is worthless every ~4 months, but a new set of basic gear is handed out essentially for free. The catchup mechanics in Vanilla aren't comparable at all.
---
You can pick pocket most of em before they kill em. He was also probably on the pserver which had near instant respawns. This won‚Äôt work on classic not only due to respawns but also the fact that the mobs on pservers drop more than they do on classic. (Believe me I tried both, may have been the one he saw on the pserver).
---
&gt;Because picking a different server,
---
Addressed this.
---
&gt;waiting in a queue
---
Long queues are bad for game health.
---
&gt;not playing the game for a week 
---
New players will exist past the first day. "Don't play the game because it will be shit" is not a good Day 1 slogan.
---
&gt;aren't actual solutions no ofc. 
---
Not if you're trying to pretend about the health of the game, no.
---
A lot of these I'm not sure are bugs but the best way to get them fixed isn't to give a big list of things it's to show them in action. Footage will get things changed much sooner than "This happens, it shouldn't, fix it plz" programmers aren't wizards even if their work does appear to be black magic at times.
---
Amusingly I do have that experience.
---
Yeah, don't care what was in vanilla 15 years ago, technology was different. I was talking about announcement by blue which you can see in my other reply.
---
Just FYI. They‚Äôre not normally like this. I think they expected everyone to use them to test their levelling routes but instead of keeping it blizzlike, turned up spawns to stupid. Don‚Äôt let that scare you off pservers. Both of the alternative realms offered by that server have better spawn rates.
---
Oh no, not the server economy.. seriously merging never hurt a soul. They merged a bunch of servers in retail and it was great. Seriously its pretty much the perfect solution with zero downsides except the god damn names. Ill take a name change over layering any day.
---
If they actually cared about accuracy (they don't), it would be far easier to maintain two than to try to get one to behave like two separate games.
---
Yes, he always spoke.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29IaykCjS0w
---
Proof from TBC from a boss that a shit load of hunters did, that deadzone was shorter.  Deadzone did not change from vanilla to tbc.
---
It's not directly due to spell batching as this is significantly larger than the maximum of 400ms of delay. Something fishy is going on in Blizzard's batch hack.
---
&gt;  I don't know how popular hillsbrad was with alliance, but it's also a 20-30 zone.
---
Hillsbrad at level 20 okay..
---
I mean you are assuming my example was the whole not a sum. But I think it‚Äôs a right direction in order to have Pvp matter. It would act like how Pvp works underwater. Shitty but doable. And if it isn‚Äôt hyper balanced it isn‚Äôt a big deal. The hyper balance is killing the game for me.
---
Yeah I would delete this image. That key can identify your account.
---
Okay, thx for explanation
---
no, leeway only applies when your both running, and you cant cast most spells while running, most mage vs melee caster is well out of melee range while one of them is rooted
---
Apparently nobody wants vanilla anymore, everyone wants new classic instead even though it's a completely different game.
---
I forgot about this song, good find!
---
I‚Äôve played on plenty of them. Did do the launch of the other realms offered but did do Nost, and other launches. Sure today had the worse of the worse respawns but everything else is still off on them. Mob density, pickpocket loot, rep rewards from quests and more.
---
I remeber taking fat dumps while trading this bad boy
---
For the immersion there is a pretty simple solution, assign accounts to a default layer, if they constantly party with someone from a different layer(constant layer/person) move the account to that layer, people disappear in the game all the time(logout) but that issue can be fixed by making layers only able to be changed in inns logical place as it's where you will to sleep 
---
And it's not gonna be 10 minutes to get a boar it will be 2 hours to login then 10 minutes to get a boar if you are a class that is good at tagging try playing a warrior with 23 hunters tagging every mob you think about getting
---
I think very early in vanilla sap either broke you out of stealth and/or it was much harder to stealth near mobs.
---
might just be misremembering though.
---
Mum  Bowl üí©üí©üí©üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Well I'm looking forward to your detailed video analysis. When you've posted it, let me know :)
---
Just trying to give people a heads up with how the game is designed.
---
Definitely isn't. The button is there to downvote off-topic comments, the button has just devolved into downvoting what you don't agree with. Doesn't change what it's for.
---
How do you know they'll be shooting themselves in the foot? The game isn't released yet. I don't care if they're not fixed on BFA, this is a different team working on Classic.
---
eh i got suckered by the new races my bad guys.
---
I don‚Äôt agree with that.
---
Jadex recreated old school RuneScape with great perfection. All of the people who currently work on osrs were not around back then or with a smaller role they had now. 
---
And a poll system could fix the problem with not trusting the company. 
---
Just saying there are methods that exist to make it work. Just because the old devs are gone, that doesn‚Äôt meant it isn‚Äôt possible.
---
Most people will spend a few days, possibly up to a month getting to level 20, even if given a layer all to themselves. The population naturally spreads out like crazy after level 10/starter zones
---
Look at it this way. The people want busy servers long term 5k plus. To achieve this the servers need to be jammed at the start, consider a 60% drop off for examples sake. For 5k after drop we need 12.5k at launch. That's spread over 6 starting zones 2-3k people in each one. 
---
Take a second to imagine 3k people in Northshire Abby.
---
you do know you can aoe without blizzard, right?
---
especially with legion values
---
 Remindme! 64 days
---
I'm much more interested in world pvp during phase one, personally.
---
So for your benefit they should buff feral dps to what it wasn't in vanilla simply because you enjoyed it's buffed dps on a private server that got it wrong? 11/10 /r/classicwow logic.
---
Are u saying they won't be judged by the colour of their skin, but by the content of their character?
---
early on in wow FD made you appear dead to your party to.   You couldn't heal the hunter, and I think it even cancelled heals.
---
"Way too much DPS" would be their way of saying they did more than half the damage of a Rogue.
---
Buff motw pls
---
&gt;  You people are just bombarding them with useless bug reports
---
yeah people complaining about bugs during a beta is totally useless
---
just because they have a reference client doesn't mean they've mind melded into the fucking game and have identified all bugs before hand. otherwise they wouldn't need a betatest in the first place, they'd know everything that was wrong
---
Private server. No way you‚Äôre getting 88 silver in under an hour on classic. Even if it had instant respawns like the pserver today did. 1-4 copper per. 8800/4= 2200 mobs. You can drop some of that down since the salt licks vendor for 1.35s for 5 but still more mobs than you could pick pocket in that time reasonably.
---
So they're doing Layering because they don't wanna merge realms because they fear they will become empty after like a month, only to realize after this month that their predictions were totally off and that they now have to split the realms instead.
---
So you think all these bugs will somehow be fixed by a team that's much smaller than BfA's, even though they haven't been able to fix it in 2-3 years? You're delusional if you think that's the case.
---
It's irrelevant whether you care or not. Most of these bugs will be present at launch, and if you think otherwise you're just naive.
---
Damn you people are getting lazy with this. He even offered suggestions right in this post!
---
Why are so many people suddenly so narrow minded that layering is the only option they can hold in their brain. What happened before layering? Was there zero solutions?
---
&gt;Right now, even private servers have done a better job of creating a blizz-like experience, which is pretty ironic.
---
Not like private servers have been developing their cores for 15 years or anything.
---
Nope, Reshade is not against the Tos. It's like a filter apllied all over the screen. Reshade doesn't change any files in the client.
---
Cool
---
Isn't the mage still fucked though?  
---
I thought mages kept threat with Ice Block in Vanilla and would sometimes Ice Block Pull
---
&gt; But seeing people just disappear seems game breaking and definitely breaks any immersion there
---
This is a dumb argument:
---
People log in and out. 
---
Things respawn.
---
Griffons flying have always just appeared and disappeared.
---
Zoning in and out of an instance.
---
It's only breaking your immersion if you want it to.
---
It's like arguing with someone with a mental defect
---
&gt;Didn't address the point.
---
Are you serious? Pick a different server if you can't log in, are you implying that EVERY SINGLE server will have the same pop at the same times of day? No that's a stupid assumption to make, just pick a different server if you cannot handle the pressure.
---
&gt;Long queues are bad for game health.
---
A non argument, nobody wants to wait to play the game but if the alternative ruins the experience for everyone i'll happily wait in queue because i'm not an entitled americant who wants his golden goose NOW.
---
&gt;New players will exist past the first day. "Don't play the game because it will be shit" is not a good Day 1 slogan.
---
Are you new to the World of Warcraft experience? Theres been like nine expansions and everytime the launch is a shitfest, EVERYBODY knows this, TBC launch? GG 8k people tryna kill boars in hellfire. OMG HOW DID WE MANAGE IT WITHOUT BIG BOY BLIZZARD TO HOLD OUR HANDS
---
&gt;DAE REDDIT AND AMERICA BAD?
---
ask anyone outside of your echo chamber and you'll find people have different opinions, if you wanna get into semantics yes objectively they are.
---
Vanilla thing. That is not a bug.
---
I hope they launch TBC when the time is right
---
To give you a simple answer to a simple question: The majority of people in Europe are not confronted with other languages on a daily basis. In cities you‚Äôll hear more different languages, but mostly because certain nationalities are more prevalent in those cities.
---
it did not last 10 seconds.  and pulling the mob into it is ez for a non shit hunter.
---
3.6 not bad not terrible
---
Technically speaking though, Classic is different. When you're trying out a new game or expansion it's new, so you don't know what to expect, so you might end up not liking it and quitting.
---
In case of Classic, most people joining will be people who know exactly what they're getting into.
---
Alien is still a masterpiece though. That one aged very well except for 1 thing. The robot/Android.
---
Because there‚Äôll be other groups doing it, tagging and killing them faster than you (as well as killing you if it‚Äôs the opposite faction).
---
That's a username that fits!
---
Thanks! That's really interesting. Seems like some effects are asynchronous applied to a different kind of batch with slower tick, or something. Could it be that the inital effect never triggers? And the effects that *are* applied should rather be on the second tick. If you understand what i mean?
---
I mainly focused on ganking lower level players and camping quest areas/NPCs. Any sort of heavy griefing was pretty clutch. I assume Classic WoW will bring this element back to life. Can't wait.
---
would be cool if it was a recurring thing
---
...yes. People in Germany do not regularly talk with the French. You know, because they live in different countries?
---
I was implying it taking much longer than ten minutes per boar but yes mob tags will be difficult. If those hunters weren‚Äôt there you wouldn‚Äôt be able to talk to them. You wouldn‚Äôt be able to make friends. You‚Äôd do the quest and move on. 
---
Lets say they make layering account wide. That‚Äôs just a different server. Even if it‚Äôs not that still means I‚Äôll never meet the other players on my realm because they‚Äôre in another layer. That‚Äôs not very conducive to player interaction and engagement. That‚Äôs not vanilla
---
Every single action is batched, or should we say botched.
---
His suggestion is a much better solution for everyone involved (even Blizzard) than the level cap "solution" you proposed.
---
You're complaint about economy is valid, but it will significantly worse with layering. And player name clashes are irrelevant if it's preplanned.
---
Also, your solution is basically what Blizzard initially planned. It's still awful. It completely destroys the community for a good chunk of the leveling process whereas preplanned server merges prioritizes community health above all else.
---
Ironically, they could even implement the servers using layering. Just let players choose the layer when they create their character, keep the layers totally independent, and do not allow layer hopping or criss-layer communication whatsoever until the merge.
---
Everyone has their own preferences, but changing gameplay is hugely different to changing graphic settings.
---
That's a negative lol
---
&gt; It's like arguing with someone with a mental defect
---
Self awareness.
---
&gt;No that's a stupid assumption to make, just pick a different server if you cannot handle the pressure.
---
Making assumptions while complaining about assumptions. 
---
&gt;Are you new to the World of Warcraft experience?
---
&gt;Theres been like nine expansions and everytime the launch is a shitfest
---
Not everyone trying Classic will be a WoW veteran.
---
&gt;ask anyone outside of your echo chamber and you'll find people have different opinions, if you wanna get into semantics yes objectively they are.
---
Enjoy crying about layering while I enjoy playing the game.
---
Oh snap
---
Despite it sounding responsible, that's actually not really good financial advise for building wealth. Otherwise sure, that will probably reduce stress since you'll always be protected, though likely very far behind where you would otherwise be. Risk is not an evil thing to be avoided at all costs.
---
Yeah well, you're not really adding anything to the conversation. These bugs have been reported by beta testers as well so Blizzard should be aware of what's going on.
---
Nah, the only relevant wand from Enchanting is the lvl 13 wand, which can be skipped and replaced by the lvl 15 vendor wand or the lvl 16 WC rare drop wand. The first wand from enchanting doesn't really benefit much from wand spec, especially since you get it at level 5. 
---
And if doing dungeons is "risky" and a "waste" to you, I don't know what to tell you. I'm not trying to speedrun this game, I want to have fun leveling and still be efficient - dungeons let me do that. I also have an IRL group to play with, so wipes aren't really a thing. Would you be quicker grinding/doing quests? Maybe. One of the biggest upsides of instances on a fresh server though: nobody will steal your mobs, you don't have to wait for named quest mob respawns, you (largely) don't have to deal with horrible drop rates to finish quests. And you progress your character.
---
If you're genuinely interested in how to progress your wands, [here is a nifty spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTm4F0MKf-HFEhHV7RjCS-MmQOFKinmXLNKMVC1N1RILG80RwtSQmAewGs0glOt2GMle9hRdbdTrUG2/pubhtml#)
---
Yeah, even if you account for lag something's wrong here.
---
How do you know the BfA team "haven't been able to fix them"? How do you even know they care or are trying to fix them? You don't.
---
Thank god we have you, the all-knowing. Guess I'll just base my entire opinion of the game on this beta, months from release, because that makes sense. Thanks!
---
Yeah some people are just really selfish and shortsighted. They really don't get why people want layering gone.
---
&gt;**Post 1.12**
---
were at 1.13.xxxx already.
---
/r/classicwiwplus is a sub for these ideas, maybe.
---
On second thought.... sometimes.
---
Correct. Blizzard ticks on an interval as well, so here it waits for a tick, then once it goes of, the action is again batched. Fucking stupid
---
To be honest I don‚Äôt buy that this is how it worked, it would seem pointless from a programmers perspective to initially design a spell around being batched (blizzard), then not have it refresh on the same interval as the regular spell batching. 
---
Either way it‚Äôs a moronic system that needs to go
---
I added plenty, I said that a list of words with no evidence makes it much harder for programmers to fix these bugs. 
---
You got snarky straight away and now you're trying to attack me when all I did was offer help. So do as you've done and lose out on the class that you seemingly love because with this attitude almost nobody is going to want to help you.
---
Yeah, no induced lag in video games in 2019 please, thanks everyone who never understood spell batching in the first place, you did this.
---
I'm a cere bear. PvE. I am a completionist.
---
stay strong brother.
---
Yep, you are correct. I was just trying to put across that in general, the mage class does have the tools to push through the phase where their single target performance doesn't feel great. Not particularly doable on a fresh server unless you only play at really odd times, but a good tool to have in your arsenal nonetheless.
---
Yeah pvping and having the ability for a friend or guildy to be able to just invite you quick and join their group is definitely game breaking. Imagine pvping for world bosses or mob grind spots and just seeing your target disappear in front of your eyes. You‚Äôd feel cheated. It lessens the importance of everything because you can just go to another layer. The world matters less because you can access virtual copies of it that are less populated. Temporary server transfer system should be what it‚Äôs called.
---
Sorry, I‚Äôm out of the loop.  What‚Äôs going on with the hunter class in the beta?  I was gonna roll hunter when classic launched and I‚Äôd like to know what I‚Äôm getting into.
---
Hell...yes. That's amazing and good proof of some staying power! Or hopeless nostalgia of which I'm truly a victim lol
---
you didnt explain #4 very well
---
Let's ignore the fact that the official Classic servers petition was done on change.org by Mark Kern. He brought all the signatures to Blizzard.
---
"Thanks to"? Is that complaining? Or can we just say thanks for reporting the bug.
---
A US/Aus server is great as it never goes quiet with the time zones filled
---
so people may prefer macros over addons
---
I'm just curious why people forgot about the "no changes" stuff, I remember how people were pissed when they found out you can crank up the graphics in demo of classic wow, but now they are fine with everything.
---
Did consider that would update it
---
Jeez, man. Are you trolling or are you really this stupid?
---
The pet control in BfA for example has been bugged for ages and Blizzard has said that they're trying to work on a fix. They fixed it temporarily at the end of Legion but it got bugged again when BfA was released. They haven't been able to fix it since.
---
Knowing this, it's unlikely that most of these bugs will be fixed at launch. It doesn't take a genius to figure that out.
---
I actually dreamed last night that I managed to order 15th Anniversary Limited Edition and I bought classic themed calendar with it.
---
Nah how about no. Keep fighting for layering to be completely removed as it should be. I'm tired of people just giving up when game companies take a shit on their own product.
---
If none of them are compelling individually, why would they be compelling together?
---
Couple things you don't seem to understand though, it isn't going to be 5x the players farming, it will be a minority of players farming 5x the amount of resources, most of which will actually not be used, no one is going to flask for MC/BWL. This will enable the people exploiting layers to set the market for lotuses for the rest of the game, never mind the fact that EVERYONE will be able to farm lesser nodes like normal herbs til their hearts content, and also EVERYONE including Blizzard seems to agree that the playerbase will dwindle... so if theres 5x the amount of resources being farmed but half of the those players will be gone later... I don't understand who's going to be using all those extra resources.
---
You could argue that when those players leave the extra resources are taken out of the game but as I have already explained, at least on PvP servers, it will be a minority controlling the spawns, the only thing everyone else will be doing is creating layers by "existing" for the minority to abuse
---
Garithos was from Lordaeron, and not part of the alliance during Classic WoW. Technically the undead remnants of Lordaeron banded into the forsaken and joined the Horde - so horde as axis in Classic still makes more sense.
---
Beta key is tied to bnet so I doubt that

give some constructive criticism mate, its for beginners anyways + to my credit theres a few videos like these out there and the aspects covered are somewhat original also its one of my first videos so cut me some slack
---
Different countries with open borders. 
---
I was in Paris. I met so many people there who couldn‚Äôt even speak French.
---
Okay you talked me off the fence. No sub til August.
---
You guys are so addicted.
---
Private servers? I hopped on an instant 60 private server having alot of fun
---
I don't care if this was or wasn't in classic. I want it.
---
This assumes Blizzard doesn't have other dials they can turn to ensure proper spawn rates relative to population. To be clear, this doesn't mean dynamic spawns, this just means setting default spawn rates higher/lower (as they did during the vanilla launch).
---
Either way, at this point we have no idea what granularity they plan to tune things to. They may have an ideal rate of resources per capita or they may just let it evolve naturally and have every realm be different.
---
Uhh could it not be that people are passionate about the game they love and have wanted to play and have been playing for years? Despite the fact they've been shamed for "nostalgia" or told "you think you do" 
---
They just want the game to be good, it's fine if you don't really mind and are just here for the ride, but don't cheapen their experience because it's not something you care about as much as them.
---
This is not about "security patches". What makes you think so?
---
Every private server out there is having an easy job compared to Blizzard. They "simply" take their backend on a random server with enough power, hand out the 1.12 client that's already finished and done. The hard job is actually getting the backend into a state that's "correct". Funnily enough kinda similar to the problem Blizzard faces when backporting their retail client.

What Blizzard does with the new client is a million times better. Since their backend is now using the same "format" than the current retail client, they can use the same hardware and integrate the classic client into their ecosystem. You know, these people asking for 1.12+ content? Stuff after Naxx? Yeah, no chance that Blizzard does that in the old codebase. But with an up to date client that fits their modern standards? It's actually possible.
---
For the frontend it also means we should be able to get the multicore support retail received a few months ago. But even in the current state, the retail client itself is a lot more tailored to modern hardware and runs quite a bit better. Most performance issues we've seen on the beta we're in fact server issues. The old client is not using any of the current "tricks" you can do on modern CPUs.
---
Yeah, classic will launch with quite a few bugs and I hope they iron as many of them out as possible until launch and keep doing so afterwards, but it's worth it on the long run.
---
Wow...even when I am going to roll a rogue...this is messed up.
---
Absolutely no way that rogue should walk by even half the blizzard without getting hit.
---
Ah okay. So undead rogue.
---
!remindme 64 days

Bus stops, traffic signs and some restaurant menu items here in the Bay Area are in Spanish/Chinese/Vietnamese. Some restaurants here have NO ENGLISH MENUS, AND NO EMPLOYEES THERE SPEAK ENGLISH (Pho Houses/Taquerias). 
---
It‚Äôs not a big deal at all. Seriously. Why are the EU players crying?
---
You're underestimating the amount of people that never played it and are just going to give it a try. And I'd assume most of them won't stick around for long but who knows.
---
Eso pvp was probably the worst pvp I've ever played in any game in my opinion
---
&gt;  LFG and cross realm made the game playable for thousands of people who felt stranded
---
As I said: Good intentions, unintended consequences. You still have LFG and CRZ on Retail servers, with all the good they do for you.
---
I quit WoW in Wotlk. Although it was a popular expansion, that was the end for me, the content got too easy, you could literally queue for weekly tank and spank raids for welfare epics, you could queue for tank and spank PvP gear (yeah idk?), interaction between factions became almost non existent (IF SW UC and Ogg all dead cities replaced with dual faction lets all be friends cities), etc. It became abundantly clear what direction Blizzard was going with WoW. A lot of people stayed through Wotlk regardless and ended up quitting with one of the future failures they released. It's hard to let go when you invest so much time and energy into something only to see it be worth nothing on the release of a new expansion. 
---
It was really painful to watch all these years, I returned briefly after getting an e-mail from Blizzard which I believe gave me a month of free game time and a lvl 110 boost, so I took the offer, logged in, ran around checking everything out for a couple hours for about 2 days, logged out and never logged back in. I'm really really hoping that they don't fuck Classic up. It's their last shot, the current WoW playerbase must just be absolute shit maybe classic can be a fresh start.
---
&gt; Unlike leeway
---
Leeway existed in vanilla.
---
I PVP'd IRL in Iraq right before launch, so I was pretty chill in game. I still enjoyed it, but didn't go all apeshit
---
Hunters had similar bugs in retail also few months before. Same delay in deployment of traps and auto attacks.
---
Blizzard has gotten plenty of reports with detailed explanations of the various bugs, as they have been reported by many players during the beta. If you think providing video evidence is essential you can do that yourself if you want, but I think the developers have plenty to work with to test it themselves.
---
Also, this is not about me. I don't really care that much about the class because there's plenty of other classes that are fun to play and I'll simply be maining one of them.
---
Is it really a shower thought if Blizzard has already said pretty much the same thing?
---
What raids were you queueing for in Wotlk?
---
Just going to assume you can't link to a blue post where they said that.
---
So "knowing" that pet control is something they aren't able to fix, it's reasonable to assume the 43 bugs unrelated to pet control also aren't something they can fix? Makes sense I guess.
---
Whilst you're right, I'm still arguing there won't be that much of a fall off.
---
Imagine I'm right for a second a classic grows like it once did or faster. What then?
---
Its probably the same people who are also planning to mod the game with addons etc. to make it easier.
---
Just look at streamers who claimed ‚ÄûClassic wow is great because gold matters‚Äú yet happily accept donations from anyone. That only really affects their gameplay but it shows a large amount of people just campaigned for no changes because as bad as it sounds ‚Äûthey thought they did but they didn‚Äôt‚Äú. And by that I mean, they didn‚Äôt actually want a 100% accurate vanilla experience. It they did, they wouldn‚Äôt stream for example, because that wasn‚Äôt part of vanilla.
---
What I‚Äôm trying to say is I don‚Äôt think most people cared if there were some small changes, I think people campaigned #NoChanges just to try and make sure the game was pretty close to Vanilla.
---
Maybe it got better since you last played? I've played a lot of mmos and this is one of the best feeling games movement wise when it comes to pvp.
---
That is so awesome dude. Happy to hear you guys are enjoying it! I have been trying to recruit my friends back to WoW Classic, but instead they have their eyes set on retail. I don‚Äôt even....
---
Yeah, because if they can't even fix ONE bug with a much larger developer team it's unlikely that they will be able to fix 43 of them with a much smaller team.
---
You really are dense aren't you?
---
You are one of the most insufferable people i've ever had to displeasure of discourse with. Literally every single one of your replies can be boiled down "no u" there is nothing from you of substance just a vapid entitled asshole B-B-B-B-BUT I CANT LOG IN OMG A QUEUE? IN 2019?
---
I will still be playing and enjoying the game, i'd just enjoy it a lot more without layering, as would most people judging by the state of this subreddit.
---
It's the same reason I've stopped nolifing my private server warrior. It's going to be for nothing in just under 2 months anyway, I've lost interest and I might go back to BFA once 8.2 hits to scratch the MMO itch.
---
When Classic releases it'll be based on 8.2. When the next retail expansion launches Classic will be based on 9.0. The two games will update at the same time and use the same core client.
---
Other faction pieces dropping in raids only occured in the very beginning and in one of the later patches by accident. I don't remember which patch that was though.
---
They also dropped for both factions in the tbc pre patch but that was intended for tbc.
---
No one is forcing you. And when you okay the beta, it's with the purpose of finding bugs and report them. It's not rocket science, so even you should be able to comprehend that
---
&gt; You are one of the most insufferable people i've ever had to displeasure of discourse with.

Yea it's been a little while. Also was on xbox. It was a real button mashing mess. And way too  large scale. Battleground was bigger than AV
---
So its a Roleplay Game ... think about it. Take a Second.
---
back when fans made real content instead of just top 10's and reaction vids
---
This literally was not how it worked. But ok. Your recreation definitely doesn't have bugs. W.e.
---
That way, undead mage is pretty easy to sneak in there, no?
---
The latest Path of Exile league is pretty good.
---
I think most people can agree anything after wotlk is not really necessary
---
Please no
---
I'd forego shatter and frostbite for it then and put points into improved blizzard for example
---
except this isnt how blizzard worked, or correct spell batching... oh snap?
---
I never said it was essential, I was telling you that just words is often useless. 
---
You're clearly invested in hunters or you wouldn't have made this post, you wouldn't have gotten snarky when someone offered really good advice, you wouldn't be getting argumentative in this thread with everyone who doesn't just insult Blizzard straight away and at this juncture I have no interest in being involved in this any more because everything points to you being just as happy being angry as getting the bugs fixed, something that's quite indicative of a Redditor on this sub recently.
---
Yeah, I had a similar experience in WotLK. I thought it was a good expansion overall but signs of the direction the game was going in started to appear. WotLK was where my interest in WoW became more casual. Cataclysm was where I gave up.
---
You‚Äôre strengthening my point; thank you. Play a role. Enter a world. Everybody in that world speaks the same language as you?

---
Distinct lack of tank in your analysis
---
New content is completely stupid and antithetical to the whole point of doing classic in the first place.
---
The original game plays differently. They fundamentally changed the way certain mechanics work. Using a modern client can NEVER feel the same.
---
I guess we were in seperate showers
---
You made me realise that's what I did with Overwatch for a while aswell. I hate what they've done to the game and I can't for the life of me enjoy the standard game mode so Id log in every week to get the weekly lootboxes. But thinking about it, apart from chasing event skins I really don't care about the game at all.
---
Exactly. Immersion really isn't good argument.
---
Oh wow I haven't played anything like that. All the BGs are split into 3 teams of 4 player so pretty small. The BGs themselves are fairly small-mid sized, comparable to WSG. I like the bar swapping also, enables you to do a lot of cool stuff. I don't find it very mashy, at least not my class. I wouldn't say there's a super high ceiling, but definitely still very skill based. A big part of it is managing your mana/stamina as well which promotes non-spammy gameplay.
---
The batching is 100% not working as it did in Vanilla.
---
Very few will survive the tedious leveling, and those who do will realize there's not much to do at 60.
---
And when you want TBC? Just overhaul 2.4.3?
---
Wrath we have to completely overhaul 3.3.5
---
So if they want to hit those major buzz expansions on the classic roadmaps, that's now 4 games of seperate clients?
---
NE Druid
---
Get a life proof case for that iPad!
---
&gt; It just doesn't feel like an immersive MMO world anymore.
---
It's one of the reason I'm against layering beyond level 5.
---
Honestly, I really have no idea. The timeline is pretty strange anyway.
---
So what do you do after wotlk?
---
Yeah I actually agree with you in most of the point, but addons for instance were a part of vanilla as well and I don't think they should be frowned upon now, it's up to a person to use a quest helper if he really wants to, but blizzard shouldn't implement it into the game. And yeah, J. Allen Brack wasn't completely wrong unfortunately.
---
Speaking of streamers, I guess we have to wait for the release to see what they are really going to do, if they'll be open to donations of gold and item, since beta doesn't mean too much.
---
Who said that? Portugal always had one server, pve, for instance.
---
If you look at the Blizzcon where they announced it, security was one of the main points they made.
---
Breaking news: the people of USA are less than 5% of the world's population. 
---
What's very well known there is often completely irrelevant in other parts of the world.
---
Even that doesn't account for. 2 full batch windows plus a full second waiting for Blizzard to tick is 1800ms. That's still less than the 2360ms delay that happens the second time in the clip.
---
Nah, but I see why you chose that. I have many alt classes/races. 90% alliance.
---
Aren't servers down? I'm confused.
---
Real question, where are people finding the sub count?  
---
I can find it NOWHERE but I see people here pull numbers out of who-knows-where all the time.
---
There's a couple of good selections:
---
**Deep frost** -  (all the way down the frost tree, and some points into arcane for imp. Counterspell) this is very common
---
**POM+Pyro** - aka. the "3 minute mage" you'll blow people up with presence of mind and pyroblast, but PoM has a 3min CD so apart from the big explosion you don't do a whole lot. super fun to play though.
---
**'elementalist'** - or whatever its called nowadays is a very fun, flashy mage to play! it centres around instant-cast spells a bunch with improved Cone of Cold and Blast Wave. You also get iceblock since you'll be a tad short on "survival" abilities. Still super fun and definetely a competetive spec.
---
Reshade can trigger warden with certain hooks that require depth buffers and the likes, but general recolour stuff is fine. Enb on the other hand will definitely hook into the game and get you a ban.
---
Personally I wouldn't risk either.
---
It's actually less practical to try to backport multiple expansions worth of content than just maintain separate code bases.
---
One code base that has to run effectively 4 different games? That's a complete fucking mess. They ALL behave differently in significant ways.
---
where did I call "all American's retards"?
---
Nothing? You have a classic server, a BC server, a WOTLK server and a retail server for the foreseeable future? I would have endless fun hopping between them as I‚Äôm sure most people would. And grinding a fully BIS geared character and knowing that it‚Äôs gear isn‚Äôt going to be irrelevant the next month would make me want to play every class. That‚Äôs years and years of enjoyment.
---
VILL S√ÑLJA PISSBLOMMA, EN GULD √Ö TIE SILVER STACKEN!!
---
and I thought I was just a noob hunter... but now I know how buggy this class is lmao.
---
Didn't had much fun playing it from 1-14 in the Stress Test.
---
The alternative is them not doing it at all. So griping about their approach isn't really adding anything useful.
---
And they can always get more aggressive with taking down private servers (it is their legal right), if that is your retort.
---
They said it at the 08 blizzcon.
---
It was a shift of focus by Wotlk, probably happened after/at the end of vanilla.
---
That‚Äôs why divorce rates are high, people jumping in to marriage too quickly
---
At the end of the day though the product will be relatively unchanged. I personally will be playing around with graphics settings as I was never opposed to them, but I won‚Äôt get any addons to help with quests. It seems like a good idea when you‚Äôre struggling to find some mobs but I think it‚Äôs hugely damaging to immersion - wouldn‚Äôt stop anyone else from getting them tho.
---
This guide was out of date on NA launch. It mentions the old skill point system where you had to choose between stat boosts or professions, this was prior to the actual profession and talent systems.
---
If you actually believe you gave me "really good advice" you're delusional. I made this post because I wanted to spread awareness of these issues, not because I'm specifically invested in the hunter class.
---
If you want to be angry with me, that's fine. I'm sorry for not stroking your ego enough to make you happy.
---
How has your experience been in jumping back into code from 15+ years ago? With zero maintenance in that time? Also with being a different person and an entirely different team?
---
Ya ...all Orcs speaks German back in the day. In the gud days.  On my Server. For my Ppl...
---
Not everyone had a bad internet connection back in the day... and no it wasn't like it's in the beta. I'll add the link to a video if i can find it. (some shaman streamer(cdew?) got rooted an had a autohit range of like 20y or so. i'm not in the beta, but if that happens, then that's clearly a bug)
---
&gt;Realms that could be mostly empty a few months after launch.
---
If you look at private servers, people have no choice but to go on those available. Why would it be different here?
---
I'd say don't give out any Pve-rp servers, just give one choice and then let people adapt. It's when you try to cater to everyone you divide the players.
---
Le probl√®me c'est surtout qu'on ne cr√©e pas des liens aussi ais√©ment dans une langue √©trang√®re que dans sa langue maternelle. 90% de l'int√©r√™t de Classic √©tant le social, c'est vraiment passer √† c√¥t√© du jeu.
---
That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs dynamic. It changes based on how many people are in that plot
---
The answer is exactly what you expect it to be
---
I don't think it will.
---
Straight up. I think it's going to grow like the OG and then some with todays world as it is, and all the new people who never played before.
---
I believe this "it will fall off" assumption is dangerous especially when it comes to things like layering.
---
I feel like Blizzard are planning for failure/mediocrity. Just like Vanillas OG release and lookwhat happened there as they scrambled to fix their under estimation. Wouldn't be the first time a games company has made the same mistake twice.
---
You can say I'm wrong, you are entitled to your own opinions. But what if I'm right? What then?
---
upvotes eorlingas
---
Ahh i see someone else with great thinking not only looking a week or a month ahead but  years ahead
---
There's gonna be people that reach level 60 in less than a week. Layering won't be gone by then.
---
I think its safe to say not everyone will enjoy classic. I do think its gonna pull a huge crowd when it launches though so even if it loses a ton of players i dont think its gonna fail.
---
Yes please
---
Off topic but why has this webcam in vids and streams become a thing? I find videos and streams so much more fun to watch when I only see the gameplay. Why would anyone look at some dude who looks like hasn't seen sunlight in years...
---
The pvp I did a while back the battleground was the entirety of cyrodil... took 20 mins to run across on horse and pvp fights were 50v50 at the keeps... just a chaotic mess. Never felt like what you did mattered. It was each faction fighting for territory
---
This video was the only reason I created my PoM Pyro mage back in the day...
---
Accurate, since these little guys are very aggro
---
I don't know if I'd agree. 2004 was around the golden age of MMO's. In addition to WoW, there were SWG, EVE, EQ2, I don't recall if AC or DAOC were around that time, too... lots more stuff to play than today.
---
Fortnite is an extremely different game from VWoW. If there's any competition it's OSRS and the like.
---
The hardest thing is usually making sure the build/tool chain works. Blizzard already confirmed that they have that working. It's all down hill from there.
---
People in their spare time have updated DOS games to run on modern operating systems. DOS games. That actually required major work.
---
The 1.1.12 client doesn't even need that much work, really. Like people have said, even without modifications it still works on modern machines. The only significant changes would be integrating battle.net, making it 64bit, and adjusting its handling of aspect ratios so widescreen is horizontal+ instead of vertical-.
---
Not wrong, as much as id rather the true vanilla experience of no layering blizzard truly love to not listen to their fans so i doubt they will scrap the idea sadly. They wont take it out for like 3-4 weeks most likely which sucks. i dont want to be in an out of different layers and watch people exploit it. It sucks.
---
Ok
---
Yeah you have no idea. At the moment, more than half of the French people I've seen are just saying "fuck you blizz I won't play". Well, in French.
---
Did you even watch the video? In Provemore's duel clips he's losing a good deal against the rogue showing how fair a fight against rogues is. You lose some, you win some.
---
As shaman i would begin like this :   [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hZxi0dVM](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hZxi0dVM)

Thats if you want to keep playing Enh and focusing on supporting the warrior as you obvious primary damage dealer.  
---
Some people go Elemental at 40, but id say that better solo since they drink alot. With a warrior you want to non-stop pull.  
---
At 55, you can spec like this:  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hZtbbbZVcxzAxqo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hZtbbbZVcxzAxqo)

then continue   [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LMhxdIio0uE0zu0x](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LMhxdIio0uE0zu0x) 
---
Maybe you as a shaman want to go for Weapon Mastery and Stormstrike. I wouldnt - i prefer focusing on making my warrior better since they already do more damage, and its better for the duo to spend the mana on keeping the warrior near 100% up time on pulls.
---
Elaborate. How does this make that any easier or more difficult? If you‚Äôre not talking to non-English speakers, then your pool for communicating is smaller, which in turn would have made it it EASIER to find your friends, not harder.
---
The trick is to help him in the shower ;)

I never watched it as a kid, because I'm Danish and at the time I didn't know the other meaning of the word, so I thought it was about Danish players not being allowed to play :(
---
I really want to respond genuinely because I ag-SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE. Yeah I agree though! Ah well at least these good'ns stuck around.
---
You never read about it because it was a given for most people. Vanilla launched with French and German servers, and for good reasons.
---
Yes that happened. Did you also get songflower, dm buffs, zg buff and darkmoon faire and then log off for 3 days for the next raid?
---
Ahahaha, so funny :P:P:P;P;P;P;P 
---
/s
---
This!  A lot of players quit early on when phasing/sharding stopped them from being able to level with their friends.  
---
I have good memories of Wrath, especially raiding Naxx hard modes, Ulduar hard modes and Sarth 3Drakes, but the leveling and solo/co-op gameplay was suffering by this stage and while I have good memories of Wrath, I also remember harboring a lot of bitterness toward the game.
---
By the time Cata rolled around I qthink I made it to 83 before just giving up and leaving to play Rift: Planes of Telara.
---
And besides, let‚Äôs be real.
---
Chat spam in another language is MUCH EASIER to sift through than chat spam in your native language.
---
While the first part may the true. If the boss dies twice as fast due to worldbuffs any wipe that would happen below 50% can't anymore because the boss is already dead.
---
The real threat to the game isn't layering it's world buff stacking that trivializes and exploits pve content.

At least French and Germany, otherwise the other realms are going to be impacted badly. These two countries can turn many servers into German or French only.

so does blizz looking into any of those or?

No I disagree, I have no issue with other languages being spoken. It‚Äôd be a good opportunity to broaden your own knowledge and perhaps experience a bit of different culture. Besides, the vast majority of Europeans speak English well anyway, so what is the issue really?

&gt;Feign Death unreliable (FD doesn't always drop combat in PvP for some reason)
---
What are the circumstances? A resist? Should not be like that. A combat initiating event occurring in the same batch as your FD? Pretty certain that is working as intended.
---
Dude listen,
---
vanilla WoW was a game where it was all about communication and interaction with other people.
---
If you don‚Äòt care about people speaking a language you don‚Äòt understand you can still go on one of those EU multi-Language Realms. But there are many people that want the opportunity to talk with everyone in their language, and they also want to be understood by everybody. It is this simple.
---
They‚Äôre green, but cannot be disenchanted.
---
Good ol‚Äô Roll Sneed.
---
I did give you really good advice, I know 3 people who do this for a living, 2 of them at massive game studios. I know for a fact that telling you video evidence helps a lot when someone's job is to go through what could be 100,000 different lines of code to find an interaction that causes a bug, but let's put it clearer for you. 
---
Are you aware of the game Dota 2? At one point there was a bug that was causing issues with using an item whilst you were facing the opposite direction from where you wanted to use said item. Valve got literally thousands of complaints about this thing on forum posts, Reddit posts, YouTubers trash talking them, etc etc and for months they could not find it, it was really annoying as the item in question makes or breaks a lot of characters. The community was getting pissed "We've sent you loads of reports, you shouldn't be doing this job, you're useless!" Were some really common things thrown about on Valve forums, Reddit, etc etc. 
---
Then the magic happened, this bug appeared in a pro game that was being televised and recorded, physical evidence! It took Valve something like 48 hours to hotfix it and that bug has never appeared again. Valve released a statement about it explaining how much difference that one piece of video evidence made and to encourage people to use that medium as often as possible. 
---
When was I angry at you? (It was the other way around?) I wasn't expecting an ego stroking I was giving you advice, if you don't want it then I apologize.
---
Finally someone not afraid to post the truth on here.
---
no changes
---
arms warrior forever
---
Big brain op
---
But not everyone there is always killing every mob the second they spawn, so you could be low on health and mobs would spawn on top of you and attack you. It's terrible.
---
I almost haven't touched BfA during the last few weeks, I'm exalted with everything, ilvl 415, curve in the last raids and my season goal is always 2.1k in PvP, so I have everything done from my personal goals. I tried playing and gearing up some alts, but big nope from me. And I used to be a huge altoholic, but I guess BfA cured it. I've been having way more fun in Mordhau and other games than in BfA.
---
With that being said, I'm little bit hyped for 8.2. Class design, the thing I hate about BfA the most, still sucks. But there will be at least something to do, the content looks good as well as the new zones. Plus the new raid is coming out, so there will be stuff to do until Classic comes out. That's all I need.
---
&gt;Couple things you don't seem to understand though, it isn't going to be 5x the players farming, it will be a minority of players farming 5x the amount of resources, most of which will actually not be used, no one is going to flask for MC/BWL. This will enable the people exploiting layers to set the market for lotuses for the rest of the game
---
Unless it's really only 2-3 people out of the thousands of players per server, the market will not be "exploited". The amount of lotuses will be the same per person on the server so the price will "regulate itself", as if there was no layer hopping involved. There is the potential though that some individual persons get quite rich.
---
&gt; and also EVERYONE including Blizzard seems to agree that the playerbase  will dwindle... so if theres 5x the amount of resources being farmed but  half of the those players will be gone later... I don't understand  who's going to be using all those extra resources. 
---
That's a "classic hype" problem and not a layer problem. If there were no layers Blizzard had to create more servers that get merged in the end. 5 servers generate the same amount of lotuses than 5 layers, so the total amount of lotuses after the potential big drop in players would be the same.
---
There's really no "too many resources" problem but potentially a "some people get rich" problem. I mean, some people always get rich and have a bigger influence over the market later on. Our server had THE enchanting dude. Knew basically every recipe and had so many materials it wasn't even funny. No clue how rich the dude got by being online 24/7 and everyone going to him because his supply really was unlimited. But in the end, nothing really changed. I could see an issue if there are suddenly more resources than before, but that doesn't seem to be the case.
---
This really cool tbh
---
Don't gatekeep and pretend the people who still claim layering will ruin the game care more about the game than the rest of us.
---
Unless you want hundreds of dead servers a few weeks after launch, layering is a necessity to keep servers well-populated while still being playable.
---
The entire point of the beta was to test shit like this and see what adjustments need to be made. We've already made it abundantly clear that some adjustments do need to be made, so let them do their jobs instead of this sky is falling bullshit on a daily basis.
---
It probably has to do with spell batching yeah, but if this is working as intended it's a huge nerf to the hunter's PvP potential. Guess we'll see though.
---
But thank you, peepz. You do a great, productive thing in the beta!
---
You are not prepared.
---
&gt; re you telling me that they‚Äôre not used to people speaking in different languages in their every day lives?
---
Unless they live in the big cities, absolutely not. And even in the big cities, a lot of people are not used to that. People in rural areas often still have their regional dialects which may or may not be understandable by outsiders - and they often are proud of that. On the flip side, newcomers to countries usually fall into one of two categories: Either they learn the local language and integrate, or they form their own little sub-community and stay walled off (which is where a lot of the tension with immigrants comes from).
---
You gotta understand that unlike the US, the EU consists of a ton of different cultures that all *grew* there. I used to live in a house that had already been built when the US wasn't even discovered yet. There's tradition here that goes back hundreds and hundreds of years, and language often is a part of that - it lends identity to a lot of people.
---
Sure, younger people often are taught a second language, but unless they have reason to use it, they don't get proficient in it. And in many places of the EU, there is no reason to use a second language. Sure, we have open borders, but the EU is not the US - those borders aren't merely lines on a map, they're in people's heads as well. People visiting other countries usually do so in a manner that lets them be tourists without having to understand a word of the country they're visiting. They book hotels where their language is spoken, they use guides in their language.
---
And even those that do speak a second language well enough, they often find it to be stressful, and simply do not want to deal with that stress during their free time.
---
This is it.
---
I keep saying the same thing. Classic is objectively one of the greatest video games to ever be released. Your opinion doesn‚Äôt matter, whether you love it, hate it or don‚Äôt understand it. Nostalgia or not, facts are facts. 
---
I just want to ruin my life over this game again.
---
Yep. It was clear 3 months ago, it‚Äôs even clearer now. Turning one game into another file by file, number by number is just so backwards and dumb. Classic will be Vanilla 2.0 not vanilla. Many are fine with that, but I‚Äôm disappointed.
---
Adding things many people miss back into retail seems like a good thing to me. I'd love to see talent trees again
---
Calm down people, I‚Äôm quite sure this will get resolved one way or another, maybe not for launch, but sooner or later.
---
I leveled in classic as a holy paladin. It was challenging.
---
I‚Äôve bound every key to my spam ability and roll my face back and forth across the keyboard to maximise my dps....
---
I am The Mage...
---
this is literally a wowcirclejerk post but unironic, congrats.
---
So you can‚Äôt communicate and interact with people who don‚Äôt speak your language? How... depressing.
---
Gonna say that‚Äôs a likely no bud
---
Yes seriously, just play what you want to, the amount of time you'll spend looking at your character... it matters, a lot. There will be so many others min-maxing by playing dwarf, that fear wards will be covered in raids, you don't need every priest to be dwarf.
---
you are though
---
This is not far from reality.  Ironforge is usually a ghost town these days.
---
Honestly, given their approach to this, I would have preferred that they would have just ported the original maps/dungeons/data to new zones in retail and then given Chromie an option to send you back in time to those zones. 
---
They've already updated the old map and NPC data to work with the current client. 
---
Half of the reason people are nostalgic is because of how much shit Blizzard has REMOVED over the years. 
---
If I could play retail but port back to the original world and farm Naxx 40, it'd be preferable to this, honestly. 
---
They can always fix the game in a future expansion. Add talent trees back, don't give casuals the same loot as real raiders just with recolored textures, etc. The only thing that really kills retail is how much content has been removed. No reason retail can't be objectively better than the original game.
---
oh no mah retort
---
Even if he doesn't want layering. Most everyone else wants a playable game with other players in it.
---
Class glut is something poorly planned mmos suffer from. Each wow class has three specs which all play fairly differently. I can't think of what niche they might fill with a new class. I'd say a maybe melee caster but we already have shaman and DK kinda doing that.
---
Most of them won't announce it I imagine, since they want to avoid the streamer hordes more than anyone. It might be a while before you realize if you're not following along on twitch
---
i lied and said the grind was worse but fuck you and your game anyway im going to play classic so i can farm herbs for 20 hours for one molten core run
---
&gt;They fundamentally changed the way certain mechanics work.
---
Which mechanics?
---
I liked that short period where they gave holy Paladins a spam able range attack and I was a play dps caster.
---
Nah, someone old as you shouldn't get so over dramatic about a temporary mechanic in a pc game.
---
I think you don‚Äòt understand this. Is it this hard? 
---
Why would anyone refuse to communicate with anybody in a game where communication is the key to almost everything. Raiding, trading, befriending new people the list goes on.
---
Even if you don‚Äòt want all of this you still have the chance to do it.
---
This isn't spellbatching. Spellbatching was in vanilla.  Now they're just trying to simulate spellbatching, and it's not working so great. Like classic itself
---
Hey, thanks for the actual response. Very informative. You‚Äôve swayed me ever so slightly towards the other side. Great post.
---
1st crit gets it, so for large raids you want your most geared mage to hit a trinketed pyroblast, and sometimes you need to juggle between mages if threat becomes an issue
---
Ability queue. The fact that a lot of stuff that used to happen client side happens server side now.
---
You used to be able to do all kinds of weird shit in the original game (skip GCDs and get in extra attacks, and so on). Because of the impact it had on arenas and people started exploiting the shit out of it, they "fixed" the holes in ways that fundamentally made the game play differently.
---
It happened sometime during the second half of WOTLK. I remember when the patch hit, and everything immediately felt off for anyone who was really attuned to the intricacies of the game.
---
This makes blizzard totally useless in PvP. Please fix it. This can't be the way it's intended.
---
Dude you're obviously lying, it isn't August yet.
---
The zombie plague was fun - I remember it was the first time you could directly communicate through in game chat with enemy players and have them understand you. Then you'd run into town and help grow the zombie army
---
What a boss ass reply ty so much I think you are right making him be my primary damage for constant uptime on pulls considering he doesn‚Äôt have mana that would be better for exp/hr although my question is besides healing him when he needs it and placing totems what do I do with my downtime ? I don‚Äôt know if I should be just sitting around waiting for him to kill things idk lol
---
I logged into retail got half a level on my warlock only class I e never had at a max level sat in a queue for cata time walking seen the10 min queue went nope then shut the game down going I can't even force myself to stay here.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs weird, I saw it live but didn‚Äôt remember it being that long
---
1 layer per person for the first 2 months!
---
It has lower DPS and isn't mana efficient, while it technically has 100% scaling like fireball it is stretched over 5 seconds so it "expresses" your spell damage less frequently, it also doesn't have crit dmg bonus.
---
In early-game PVE using clearcasting with AM is the best flat mana to damage option. This is due to the fact that you plan to run OOM as a mage and so your real choice is about spending mana as wisely as possible and not about maximizing dps (spending mana wisely maximizes dps).
---
You say you have come up with a way to play with AM and make it deal good dps? Any resources you invest in AM when also invested in other spells cause the same discrepancy in performance, outside of maybe some cool tricks with the ZG trinket that gives crit dmg to AM (which wouldn't be enough by itself).
---
I would be delighted to be wrong but the truth is AM is an amazing push-back resistant and push-back causing damage spell, which snipes people behind hard cover, saying you can make it be a better "bread and butter" spell is like saying you found a way to add a dot to frostbolt and a slow to fireball, those mechanics aren't in the game files. How do we make warriors attacks count as all holy dmg and ignore armor? Prove me wrong, I'll be wealthier for it. :)
---
Trying to create a brand.
---
256 is pretty big amount. Might have to close chrome for it.
---
not true, right now you arent able to frost nova without getting hit, thats definitly not vanilla-like and it makes mages significantly weaker
---
Don't spew shit I'd you don't understand it. Because this isn't spellbatching. Blizzard are trying to simulate spell batching from vanilla and failing at it.
---
Tja isn't spellbatching tho. It's a simulation of what spellbatching was
---
https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/775511-Ability-queue
---
It was the Cata pre-patch. Basically ruined the game IMO.
---
Warrior tanking always felt like shit after that patch for anyone who was lucky enough to experience the original gameplay.
---
I agree that providing video evidence would be helpful but this is not my responsibility, nor is it something I'm even able to do because I don't have beta access.
---
Also, I'm not angry with you. I reacted to your first comment in a snarky way because I perceived it as critical of something that has got nothing to do with the post. This is not a bug report, it's a post meant to simply spread awareness. These bugs have been reported numerous times in-game by the actual beta testers.
---
i think that's a really rigged statement. high difficulty raids are a really fun way to play with friends and feel rewarded for working like a team. also i personally really like getting better and better at mechanics so i can focus more on filling my role properly. 
---
classic is basically a solo grind before you can raid, and raid mechanics are so boring that i wouldn't hesitate to call raid spam a "grind". 
---
finally i'd like to add that item level upgrades are worth fuck all in high raid difficulties and you'd know that if you did them. the most important thing is getting the right stats on your gear. in that regard, you're not looking for an arbitrary power number to make you feel stronger, you're actively getting stats which will noticeably increase your damage, health, and healing
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter, both versions are throttling, and its shit either way.
---
&gt;"You think you don't, but you do"... this is exactly what your doing and saying to us right now with this. Clearly you can see the flaws in layering.
---
Not having layering is way worse - it would mean after turists leave you just have a bunch of ghost realms. That will literally kill the game so they will then have to do mass merging, essentially destroying all community building that had been done up to that point. No, layering is not ideal, even Blizzard knows that - but doing nothing is worse. And you don't exactly come up with a better solution yourself. Actually, the most wildly spread "solution" on this sub is "just only have layering in the starting zone", which means after the first day when everyone is above level 10 you either get so massive queues that no one can play or you made enough realms to hold the people, bringing back the same problem as not having layering.
---
God sake, can't mods add a rule against making a thread about layering without understanding why it is here?
---
then dont use raid finder play with a guild
---
They are still very much up.
---
Looking forward to seeing the completed product.
---
stress test servers are, not the beta

My bf introduced me to wow and I'm happy to start playing with him now and that will be literally us playing in the picture above!

CLASSIC CALLS FOR AID
---
The layers will be automatically implemented, as the first layer becomes full
---
The lyrics havnt aged as well, but i remember this well, the good old days of youtube.
---
This means you cant see lvl 60 hordes pre 20...
---
Enjoy your private layer. You signed up for a beta you're agreeing that they get to test shit and it won't always be fun.
---
You Know you are german when you can pronounce "Tschechisches Streichholzsch√§chtelchen"
---
The problem isn‚Äôt about multiple languages in one server, it‚Äôs one language dominating that isolates all those people who don‚Äôt speak it and are essentially stuck in a community they can‚Äôt join. Even if a majority French (for example) accepts anyone, you‚Äôre going to feel very very left out if you can‚Äôt read 99% things posted.
---
Ah you right, first rank was 10 seconds, lvl 60 was 20.  But the tooltip on wowhead says it can only be placed out of combat?  Is this an error, because I feel like I‚Äôve been stuck in multiple traps in pvp settings? 
---

Ulduar hardmodes, heroic 25 man icc? Idk man Just my opinion but wotlk was still great. I do agree it laid the framework for what it is today but I loved wotlk. Cata was drastically different and was the first time i unsubbed after 6-7 years
---
I was in Stormwind when Kazak came. My frame rate dropped to 3 as the shadow boots darkened the sky. I was able to save myself, briefly, but I could do nothing for the others. From within my divine shield, I saw another wave crash down upon the lowbies and bank alts. I saw many more disconnect from the taxing of their RAM or internet speed. Some tried to fight. None succeeded.
---
My hearthstone was set to Light's Hope. Within my shield, I began to cast it. I wish I could have saved them.

Grizzly Hills
---
Id be fine with if it slowed 2/3 of the way inside the blizzard...
---
"  As he perilously assisted and drug these members into a guild eventually "
---
He WHAT?
---
Excuse me for beeing rather uninformed but I would like to know if one of you knows how far and if Activision is involved in WoW politics and if this isn't just some kind of   conspiracy theory
---
10/10
---
Playerbase: "We just the community feeling back and our time ingame to mean something"
---
Blizzard: "Hahaha ... You have no power here"
---
Improved sap in talents gives you a 90% chance to not break stealth iirc, so it's usable, just possible to fail.
---
A good opportunity to learn The Dominant Language. But this is a game. People want to have fun, not learn. I get it.
---
But you‚Äôre acting like they won‚Äôt have a chance. Guilds who speak their language will recruit them.
---
Let‚Äôs say you don‚Äôt speak French, but you speak German. Type something German in the chat, and you will IMMEDIATELY find others who speak your language. Instant friendship (generally).
---
It's definitely a thing, he says it on beta
---
NAW NAW NAW LETS NOT PRETEND BLIZZ IS NOT AT FAULT HERE
---
I smell a postponed release date..
---
&gt; Retail solo content has zero difficulty
---
Plays ESO ?????????????
---
That's for sure I suppose it could be much worse
---
That is not what would happen. Without layering (or something else) you got a few scenarios.
---
1. Realms have the pop cap of 3k or whatever it is, so they have to make *extremely* many realms. After a few months all the tourists have left and essentially you just have a ton of ghost realms and need to do mass merging.
---
2. You *don't* make a ton of realms, so instead you just have massive queues. As in, many people will not even be able to play properly for weeks.
---
3. You remove pop cap and get like 30k people standing in a starting zone, crashing the servers, causing 2 FPS when they are up and making any kind of leveling absolutely impossible until half the playerbase rage quit the game because "Blizzard utterly fucked up".
---
It won't be "epic" as you say, it would be a total shitshow. Even fucking Blizzard knows that, if they can realize it, you should be able to realize it too.
---
THEN BLIZZARD NOW ACTIVISION BLIZZARD
---
The real question is does anyone have the YTMND version now that it shut down?
---
TÃ∂hÃ∂aÃ∂tÃ∂ This sub is so pathetic, christ.
---
Even before the merger with Activision, Blizzard invested deeply in the trends we as gamers tend to dislike, if the EA, Activision and Epic memes are to be believed. The MMO subscription model is a rough predecessor of the 'Games as a service' model we see now. Blizzard was well on its way to polish World of Warcraft into a palatable game for as big an audience as they could find. Making games is risky, expensive, and beholden to all the rules of free market capitalism.  
---
Blizzard isn't your friend, it's just the culture has shifted, and games with them.
---
I never said it was your responsibility, I said it helps not just for you but for everyone who reads these posts because these lists on Reddit don't help as much as people think. They are well meaning and Blizzard would much prefer these over nothing but they are very lacking in the grand scheme of things. You don't have beta access, that sucks I feel for you. You could show some of them in the next stress test but it's also not your job so I understand if you don't wish to.
---
This post is a bug report though even if it's not intended that way it's a list of bugs on a Reddit Blizzard are known to read. These things will get passed on by the people who read them and I'll be honest, when the message gets sent with the list of 100 bugs that they've collated and all they are is words, the person they get sent to will put their head in their hands and sigh even if they know it's well intentioned. The second they get sent a link to a video they'll click it and the odds of it helping go up exponentially. 
---
Even if you don't want to make a video, encourage people to. Your post will do much more good if it just asks someone in the beta to reproduce them in video format. 20-30 words is all it would have taken to entirely change the odds.
---
&gt;Those of us who said this would happen got called haters
---
So you said that developers would use the beta to test various mechanics of the game?
---
There is no "looking for raid" in WOTLK, what are you talking about?  Ulduar is widely considered the best raid in WOW history.  WOTLK was the high point of WOW subscriptions and is generally considered a high point for WOW, not a low.  Some people like Vanilla best, some people like TBC best, some people like WOTLK best, almost no one thinks those were bad points for WOW.
---
There's one which opened yesterday so everyone's low level. Pretty fun
---
Im definitely for no changes, however artificially implimenting spell batching seems like they have overcompensated for the average (pretty good) internet connection these days and its just funky and feels like shit.
---
I dont see the majority of people enjoying this mechanic, i hope its removed. Its not what made vanilla special. 
---
Maybe just up the batching frequency significantly?
---
Damn, I almost thought this was unironic post, good stuff my man.
---
Someone give this man platinum. I would, but I‚Äôm poor as shit
---
It's also not just player falloff, but also playtime falloff. Lots of people are going to play as much as they can when the game releases, and then dial back their playtime to something more sustainable once they're through the initial phase. This too thins out average online population.
---
In Classic should only exist two teams: Alliance and Horde
---
God no, Blizzard won't have time to make another solution. Shitty as layering is, the alternative of nothing is worse. Depending on how many realms they decide to make you either get so massive queues you can't play properly for weeks or mass merging once the tourist leave and there are too many realms without enough players to fill.
---
&gt;I'm tired of people just giving up
---
And we are tired of people not being realistic. There are zero chance of layering being removed this close to launch, it is not giving up, it is focusing our effort where there is a chance. And even *if* we somehow got them to remove layering, above stated problem would just be present where we have absolutely no system to combat the mass tourist tour.
---
No you've watched some videos of players abusing the beta test of the layering. Notice the word TEST.
---
I don't think people have changed, we just pander more to the lowest common denominator. My sister and partner watched Jurassic Park at the cinema when it came out and thought it was incredibly boring.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3GH5cWPFOE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3GH5cWPFOE)  Meele leeway.
---
Not as dumb as your own comment though. Explain your position instead of being a toxic asshole.
---
You can FD and drop another trap, but fd cooldown is 30 seconds, I think.   So, I guess I was wrong about indefinite cc.  Though I think you could get close with talents.
---
Even if it's more popular over time, there will still be that initial burst of active players in the first week. There has been a lot of posts on here about how people are going to take time off work just to play on Classic's launch, so a % of the player base will be logged in for significantly more time at first.
---
Once people go back to a regular lifestyle in terms of time investment in the game, the amount of people online will drop even if only a few people quit.
---
Nothing, nothing at all.
---
bet it's day old bread because no one bought any yesturday.
---
I like your thoughts, and really hope you‚Äôre right!
---
If you think this beta is anything more than a streamer demo/advertisement you are kidding yourself.
---
Sure.
---
Tell that to the Loot Ninjas, Auction House Scalpers, Node Stealers, White Knights, and Power-Tripping guild leaders.
---
Or it‚Äôs a two way street - games shifted, and the culture with them too.
---
you probably want to post this on the blizzard forums and not here
---
Those darker shadows would be amazing in Duskwood!
---
Thanks I hate it
---
Sad but true
---
they are the buffed green versions on beta and all stress tests
---
Why not?
---
I played a couple of chars to 15-20 to decide what I'll play on launch and stopped playing  eta afterwards. I just don't wanna get burned out during the beta.. And I'm pretty sure a lot of people are having the same thoughts.
---
Wanna cry? Watch his Darrowshire video.
---
Lots of people think those were bad points for wow. Tbc killed the lore and wotlk beat the dead horse. We're not all clamouring for a wotlk classic.
---
Have you watched darrowshire? It will make grown men cry.
---
Don‚Äôt let this failure stop you from achieving greater things!

Classic WoW has ruined all other games for me. I was having fun on my Switch before I got all exited about Classic, and now all I wanna do is watch youtube vids about Classic. Makes me wonder how I'm gonna get through the next two months...

No problem!
---
Just to illustrate how deep-seated some of those borders of the mind are: My own dad used to be proud of the fact that the people in the next village over, not three miles away, could not understand *his* village's dialect. They had an generations-old rivalry ongoing.
---
People around here don't really think of themselves as "Europeans" or necessarily even "Germans" either; If you ask them their heritage, they'll tell you they're Swabian, or Franconian, or Upper-Palatinates (Upper-Palatinians?), and if you mistake one for the other, they will point that out to you.
---
Also - and this may just be true of German guilds, and not all of those either -, at least some of those see the guild as more than just a guild for WoW; They're a *community*, and that may well include real life meetings - which means in turn that they really want people that can show up to those meetings (summertime bbqs are a popular choice), so they're selecting guild members by proximity - which works much better on language-specific servers than on basically international ones.
---
Demanding those two leads to less spoken languages to demand theirs as well.
---
dynamic spawn is also very not classic like
---
Except it is still those new shitty looking icons. It looks like something made for a mobile game... Oh wait...
---
The real MVP, at some point I just forgot about it, but damn finding it again was gratifying.

Great, now Breaking Me Down is playing in my head.

And not really the most optimal spec for a rogue in PVE to begin with. Those are essentially wasted points for what a rogue brings to a 5-man. That and Sap Vanish is still a thing.

---
how does that change anything that i said? of course it's marketing. but you're retarded if you think any company knows all the bugs that are in their game without playtesting lol
---
Nice!
---
Activision itself? No relation at all, maybe they sometimes wings are called in to assist development on their projects.
---
But both merged way back and formed Activision-Blizzard which umbrellas both of them. They likely do have quite a bit of clout in how things are done, at least the deadlines/Monetization, and the culture over there has been shifting more Activision like (at least according to employees / former ones). Though this is slightly misleading, it‚Äôs less poisonous advisor and more willing servitude and a slow conversation to be more like them. Even if it wasn‚Äôt Activision, they probably would have done very similarly had they the power to do so on their own.
---
They are not your friends. They never where. Only recently that is being figured out.
---
Because Blizzard has great history with fixing critical bugs in betas. Oh wait, no they do not. They have a history of not fixing this kind of bugs for 3 expansions.
---
I'll always have fond memories of Halo 2 LAN, but even dealing with a fucking xbox was a hassle I'd never want to do again. The people that did PC LANs were ridiculous.

Don‚Äôt worry, man. BLIZZARD HASNT DROPPED THE BALL YET. I have 100% trust in them with this project. They will implement Layering in a way that will not break the game.
---
Hey I can see a few pixels in that picture!
---
I sat in a few queues in vanilla.. wasn‚Äôt the end of the world. I‚Äôd sit in more if meant no layering. Especially if they are anticipating the population to drop low enough to not need layering (which would be the same threshold of not needing a queue).
---
I feel you. I re-subbed just for the stress test and have been logging in each day just to see if maybe I'll have access again.

Shit like this be why some pserver guides say 'tank with da healing shield ya'.
---
I think you're mistaking time spent in the game with population. A man who returns to work and a kid who plays all day are just two tauren on the same server at 8pm in the evening.
---
But lets assume that people do leave? Do people think wrath of lich king (as an example) just held all the same players for its duration? No, it swapped them. The outgoing equalled the incoming which is why its sub count stayed level.
---
Now look at Vanilla and tbcs growth curves. People quit both of those. Yet the incoming sub numbers were greater.
---
Im not saying people won't quit or find its not for them. I'm saying the net sub count will be a consistent gain.

---
 "This is wrong, you don't even want to touch shadow until you're in your mid 40's"
---
Spirit tap is in shadow. The only 10 points that matter is spirit tap and wand spec, so I guess we are in agreement.
---
No, 90% of your damage is not in wand, although a substantial part is. Just the sw:pain you open with does more than 10% of a mob.
---
There's a much larger fight than the DM vs VC one coming to the EU servers.

---
Millions of other people agree with this statement.

The king of MMO‚Äôs will be resurrected on August 26th 2019.

Can‚Äôt wait to go back home!
---
I know where you're coming from, as I've started the same way. For doing these kinds of videos, try to set yourself apart from the rest and don't repeat what others have done. For example, the selling of junk or quest rewards are done with addons, this requires little research and is one of those points the "clickbait garbage refers to".
---
You're a native english speaker, that's a bonus! The intro is horrendous to look at. Not only don't the character animations synch, but also the framerate is very very low. The whole video is laggy and that should have to be fixed asap, either find a lower resolution or different capture software.
---
I'm on mobile, but voice sounds good enough, for as far as that goes with these speakers haha.
---
I'm a really technical player who loves information and numbers, so when doing these videos I'd like to see what class skips what spells and why. How much does it save and how much grinding time that equals to. Something to keep in mind is what kind of audience you're targetting. You said the beginners, but atleast quantify either through numbers or words what skipping spells mean and why you make the decisions you make. This makes it way easier to justify what you do and people will follow your train of thought.
---
For Top # videos you can organise it through a list that shows in the beginning what you're going to cover and highlights during the video where you are in the list. This is usually for longer videos where people can easily find what you're talking about. This refers to longer videos, but if you elaborate your decisions, you'll see the video length increase too :p.
---
This ties into viewer retention and view time. You'll risk people clicking away seeing the list of items you'll talk about, but gain efficiency and comfort for the viewer if they're searching for a particular subject.
---
All in all, I can say it's moderate start. Fix the framerate first and foremost. I think the voice is calm and has a nice speed. Start playing around with more transitions. Find a way to make a list and animate it. Play around with figures more and highlighting (look at how other content creators do it). Usually learning from others is the fastest way forward!
---
Using a red 'X' and 'O' to point stuff out is not aesthetically pleasing ;).

If you work with Adobe AE / Prem pro / PS and OBS I can help you out for anything. GIMP 2.8 too if you're F2P. Cheers!
---
No no no no. Pservers are accurate. They are so good they provide a 99% blizzlike experience. The meta will carry over 1:1. No problems at all.
---
Can‚Äôt spell boom without oom.
---
For what? PvE or PvP? Look at a bunch of videos on YouTube. See what wets your whistle. 
---
Look at classic hunters. You are wrong, at least for PvP. Hunters did lots of melee damage. They had no disengage, so they HAD to do some melee damage if a rogue or warrior was on them. 
---
Check out Corossity on YouTube. The first part of the video is all melee pvp.
---
As I recall the german client got the german Dungeon names in 2.0 or so. Prior to that we used the english names and abbreviations and even then people used the english ones
---
Would he make it through if he had runspeed on his boots?
---
Doesn't mean I have to be closed minded
---
There will be a drop off because players of retail won't want to actually take time to play. Who cares though, classic is going to be outstanding as along as there's realms to play on. The playerbase will be large enough for the game to be successful. The chance of this ever happening in our lifetime again is very slim. Time to live it up while we can!
---
If someone would send them a bunch of videos where these bugs are shown and explained in detail it could definitely make things easier for them, but I don't think it's absolutely necessary. It's not like every bug needs detailed video evidence before it can be fixed. Developers can test and explore these bugs themselves with the in-depth explanations provided to them.
---
I just hope they will solve most of these problems before launch because if they don't, the hunter will be severely gimped as a class.
---
I'm sure you realise yourself a huge reason vanilla hooked so many into its world is due to people playing half the day in it, engrossed in there "2nd life" as you say them kids/teens/students will be playing 2hrs an evening now if lucky, and if you feel like constraints stop you getting engrossed it can suck your motivation away in no time, 'what's the point I don't have time to get stuck in' its vexing more then fun, and almost a cock tease.  
---
Hope I'm wrong(and I'm sure the fanboys will state I am in 5mins anyways) and I'm glad you're old mates are coming back, that alone will give you few weeks of nostalgia fun. But after that, like most working adults I feel the realisation is that most if us miss 2005 wow in 2005, and we wish we could just recreate them times and importantly the free time we had, and less wanting 2005 wow in 2019.
---
What, don't you have a phone?
---
Then just set up the redirect in reverse if you prefer the other :)
---
I‚Äôm talking about small plots, not the entire map. If they aren‚Äôt there to kill mobs, what are they there for in the first place. 
---
And mobs spawning on you is part of the game anyway. Just die and go again.
---
Germans use english abbreviations except for very very few exceptions. WC is HDW for instance, cant think of any other right now. They use english for every raid and pretty much every dungeon. They also use a lot more english terms for CC than german ones, there are a few where people use both (never only the german one) and some are exclusively in english like sheep. 90% of the trade chat and lfg chat are english abbreviations like lfg lfm wtb wts. They use more english names for classes too. And its been like this since forever. I dont know about the french but the germans use the english terms mostly in anything that would be relevant to you. Thats how it always as been and how it always will be. Even a lot of items and spells that are posted are en english, i assume that like 50% of the playerbade on german realms use the english client. I used to have the german client because in every single guild i ever was i was told to do X or Y and i wouldnt know what it is because i was always told the name in english, so i changed to the english client aswell.
---
I hit 60 with all my pserver characters in less than 7 days playtime and went to every faction dungeon at least once.
---
I gladly change 2-3 days playtime for the fun and social aspect of the game. I mean, I will be 60 for the rest of Vanilla on that char, so the levelling process should be somewhat meaningful.
---
Also I want to feel the mmorpg... talk to all the npcs out there and stuff. That‚Äôs what I do, and I don‚Äôt t consider it a mistake. I‚Äôm still hitting 60 by the end of week 2.
---
But that seems not to work for you. But as always...whatever floats your boat.
---
Does t change the fact that divorce rates are sky high nowadays. You may just be an outlier
---
If it is to do with spell batching i am 90% sure it worked like that in vanilla and 100% sure it worked like that on all pservers i have played on. It is usually not a big deal because you will typically scatter trap so will not take an instance of direct damage from your target when you FD.
---
Dungeon names came so late?
---
I remember quite well that I cemented the foundation for my english skills with the decision to switch to the english client when they localized EVERYTHING pretty early in classic.
---
Why they had to localize NAMES is beyond me and I still think it was a terrible decision. Schlingendornental - ugh.
---
Are you sure Dungeons were exempt from this and came later? Not saying you're wrong I just think it sounds like an odd decision on their part to localize absolutely everything but dungeon names.
---
I love land parties
---
It took me like all of 3 mins one day when some dude was defending the 4k armor healing shield based off some alakazam archives to realize that the alakazam addon was being used on the fucking TBC PTR and was fucking up their database by going back and forth between the values depending on who logged on what server last...
---
Sometimes I honestly wonder if they put any fucking effort in.
---
But it‚Äôs so not vanilla....
---
Old Naxx still required a full raid + tactics at level 70.  We used to pug it at 70 on my old server.  US Kel'Thuzad for whoever remembers friday night Naxx pugs.
---
It was definitelly still during vanilla. But yeah we still use mostly english terms to this day.
---

---
Not working on mobile, but I think this is it
---
Man how pityfull the wow pvp is lol
---
Do you know if this is doable for firefox aswell?
---
Dunno. Sometimes they just stand there jerking off. Sometimes they're only killing mobs in a specific spot, while other mobs of the same area keep respawning.
---
The problem is they respawn way too frequently. You can't kill them fast enough on your own. That's the biggest problem of dynamic respawns, if you're not in a group you're fucked.
---
There‚Äôs always ways to tweak it. They may be there jerking off, then they die all the same.
---
I am sorry but your arguments starts to be pretty sad :) Me &amp; my wife don't give a shit about your high divorce rates.
---
There was a patch during vanilla that changed most of the names to localized names so they should be localized in classic. Most people kept using the old abbreviations though. I don't know many german abbreviations besides HdW for WC.
---
Yup.  In a vacuum each particular QoL change could be tolerated, but the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.  Once you add more and more "quality of life" changes to streamline the game, eventually you're just stripping away the game itself.
---
Pretty cool
---
Needs more jpeg
---
Yeah, I acknowledged that. Looks like you didn‚Äôt read. I mentioned how people will disappear upon grouping up, that‚Äôs an issue.
---
It's not edgy, this question has been asked a hundred times and almost every time it's by someone who hasn't experienced the clusterfuck of one language taking over a server thinking everyone speaks English and we can all get along fine.
---
I'd love to see you have fun on a server where only 10% speaks English, I speak 5 languages and it helped fuck all when my server became the unofficial Hungarian server. Good luck trying to make sense of that language. 
---
In 1 out of 10 groups you had 1 guy that spoke broken English and you were very happy until the last boss when they started talking in their language and kick you or just plain ninjaloot because noone cared in /general because you're not one of them. 
---
Finding a decent raiding guild was impossible since anyone who was serious about it left the server anyway so you only had some casuals international guilds left who couldn't get past Lucifron a year into the game and UBRS was their "raid".
---
Grouping was more rage inducing than playing a moba, that should tell you enough.
---
People like to connect to the human. You... are just weird.
---
Blizzard didn‚Äôt even have to make classic wow
---
vanilla's launch was a shit show.
---
Downvotes all around :D
---
Eh? Why should I care what you and your wife give shits about? I‚Äôm just stating a fact.
---
To the people saying this isn't how it worked back in vanilla:
---
With talents in improved blizzard there was always a delay to the slow from blizzard.  [Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMeBA0D1LJY&amp;t=3m45s)
---
Notice how the theres a delay between the first dmg tick and the actual blizzard debuff, which is the slow.
---
This combined with over the top spell batching and you end up with this. This is what you end up with when you insist on #nochanges with mechanics made for 2005 internet. The irony is that it will feel less blizzlike.
---
If some of these layer naysayers really played Vanilla they would know that as cool as it was , it was shit in the beginning.  I recall wanting to play many times and I would Que up, and it took hours, so long that it was formation (Marines)time and well there that goes ./
---
All programming is hacks upon hacks..
---
Are you just repeating what others have told you, like a mindless drone?
---
Well you really seem to care because my happiness with her could happen without waiting for 10 years to make "slow progress". Otherwise you wouldn't make your absolutely hilarious arguments how divorce rates haves something to do with layering.
---
How do you plan to spend the first week?
---
This seems like quite a good representation of the beta class data.
---

Other big polls have gotten quite the same results
---
This game manual made me play a paladin because I thought I could be a fighter with it üòÇ
---
The gaming industry really has so much to learn from the past.
---
Will the cloth rep hand in quests be available in phase 1?
---
It doesn't work like that on pservers because they don't have spell batching... Also, it is a big deal because if it's not possible to combat trap someone without scattershot it's a huge loss for PvP hunters.
---
Or like 3 golds minimum
---
That's not what you said. You said "most of these", suggesting that almost no bugs will be fixed, and now you're arguing that they can't fix ALL of them. And I see my assumption was right, no blue post to prove what you were saying. Guess I'll just have to take a random redditors word on it :-).
---
With your logic, no bugs will be fixed because if they can't fix one bug in BfA, how can they fix ANY bugs with a smaller team? My oh my, we're all doomed!
---
This dude is somehow right and wrong at the same time. 
---
Sap was never usable on targets mid-combat. But the reason it was never used was because sap broke stealth in vanilla so it was really hard to time it right to apply it before the mobs rekt the rogue and dropped the sap anyways. You could spec into improved sap but it was pretty far down in the Subtel tree (waste of a lot of points for pve) and still only gave you 90% chance to not break out of stealth.
---
You must be confusing me with the other guy, I wasn‚Äôt the one who instigated the argument
---
I think there will be lots of people giving it a try, but not at launch.
---
Launch is mostly going to be old Vanilla vets, people looking for a Vanilla style game, and some chunk of retail players (who should also know what they're getting into and tbh they'll have 8.2 to focus on).
---
Just fuck off and play a private server, it takes literally 10 minutes to set up.
---
Bruh, you are so mad. That story actually made me lol.
---
I would have fun on a server like that, if I was forced to play on it. Just play the game. It‚Äôs super fun.
---
Bedste jeg kan klare er 8 s√∏lv stacken

This is so goddamn bad kt turns me off xonsidering not playing classic. Is the community vocal enough about this?

We live in a society

I played Vanilla.

This is not how it worked in vanilla, and yes, I'll stake my life on it.
---
**BOTTOM TEXT**
---
Months afterwards too.
---
I enjoyed Wotlk very much, but your argument about hard content is the same that people use about retail. Mythic raids and dungeons are as demanding as ever. Although I think that the hard mode system in Wotlk was far more RPG-like / lorefriendly compared to artificial difficulty settings. But yeah, just wanted to point that out. The guy you replied mentioned queuing which did not exist, except for dungeons.
---
I REALLY don't want to be offensive but a comment like this shows pretty much no understanding about what Layering is there for.
---
Layering - BY NO MEANS POSSIBLE - is any way to safe money. The upper management literally has ZERO feelings about layering.
---
I feel so bad for the EU fans out there. Blizzard really made a point to shit on them this summer.
---
That is also a possibility but i am too lazy to investigate this horrible divorce rate &amp; layering problem.
---
There is absolutely nothing even remotely close to the complexity of Legion Surv hunter in Classic. Can‚Äôt really give you a comparison
---
Or just make the batching window smaller. It's literally numbers in code that they can change.
---
Why they dont is beyond my understanding. Batching was a thing in vanilla that much is clear, but surely they should know how large (as in MS) the windows ought to be.
---
EU is just for easy selling stuff to all countrys, they are far away from feeling like one country like the usa.
---
Most people/politicians still care only about their country and not for the EU as a whole.
---
This isn't how it played in vanilla. 
---
We want #nochanges that represent a change from how it played back in vanilla.
---
Most germans used the English ones back then, if my memory serves me right. But this was another time. Today I would say, if they don't use the English names it most likely indicates, that they suck anyway and you shouldn't group up with them. I had a german guild on a pserver and some of them declined to speak English (Because they couldn't). I did a dungeon run with them and it was horribad. If you encounter Germans that don't speak basic English, they are either very young or stupid/uneducated beyond imagination. You are better off ignoring them. This is coming from a german.
---
I dont know if it would have made any difference if the game was localized from the get go. I cant remember how it was after vanilla but i played again recently in legion and bfa which are fully localized and the english abbreviation are still the ones used.
---
I feel sorry for any unaware brit that will create his character on these "unofficial" german &amp; french servers.
---
Anyway, this inconvenience will be 100% Blizz fault.
---
Thank you for this information.  
---
I have a spreadsheet with a massive amount of ClassicDB links that I would like to eventually redirect to Wowhead once their database becomes more accurate. This will help immensely.
---
I'm well aware of the reasons for implementing layering. And you're right, both overcrowding and diminishing server populations are also serious, legitimate issues that are not easy to solve. In theory, while completely antithetical to the classic experience (and I hope we at least agree on that), layering is a necessary evil that solves both of these issues. However, the thing is that the current implementation of layering is easily exploitable garbage that creates more new serious problems than it solves, and the extent to which it is going to be used is quite unclear and has potential to become far too long.
---
So yes, layering for one phase is, in itself, an enormous issue. Sorry, not everybody wants to play a single player game instead of an MMO with other people who are a living, real, consistent and necessary part of the traversing world. If they do fix the gaping issues with layering I'm all for it for the first few weeks in the 1-20 zones, but even then we need to be very, very vocal about having this necessary evil removed as soon as possible.
---
Btw, "neck beard" is not an argument.
---
obviously, and you can just run 3-4 accounts on different high level zones and farming, obviously assuming you've leveled them all. unfair advantage? not really, everyone can do it. multibox 4 characters to lvl 60 and then farm em in different zones, double gathering on everyone.
---
You're seriously upset with them for attempting to protect the budding communities that we'll be building on Classic? Are you hearing yourself?
---
Yes Classic will see a massive drop in players. There's no way around it. The modern gamers (teens and whatnot) are looking for instant gratification games because thats what they've been raised in. Classic isnt going to be a lot of peoples kind of game which is totally fine, but to say its going to flourish without any evidence to the contrary is just unrealistic.
---
There was a major difference between EQ and VWoW, though: EQ pretty much demanded that you're in a party at all times (unless you played, like, Ranger iirc). I would say that's more significant than grind time. VWoW is very solo friendly early on, which I think is key.
---
Because as far as grindiness goes, I'm not seeing indication that people don't like grindy games. *ahem* OSRS *ahem*
---
It directly alters the image output buffer on a driver level from your GPU - which is exactly the way a lot of hacks like ESP/wallhack etc work. Hence why it's usually not allowed and automatically blocked (like PUBG) until it gets whitelisted by the anti-cheat used. (EAC/Punkbuster/etc).
---
But hopefully we can agree it's a necessary evil that needs to be temporary, right?
---
It's not necessary no, these things are extremely obscure at times though. Who's to say the intimidation bug isn't actually a Warlock Voidwalker sacrifice bug? It would be real easy to leave that specific piece of info out because the people reporting it are hyper focused on it being an intimidation bug, but without it the devs have realistically zero chance of catching it because it's actually tied to an entirely different skill. 
---
Long ago this would be pretty basic for beta testers looking for bugs, nowadays bug testing essentially gets outsourced to members of the public who have almost no experience in it and massively underestimate details or overestimate others. If you want a bug free game, always advocate for video evidence, always. A picture paints a thousand words.
---
90s to mid 00s was a golden age of gaming and movies when you take of the CGI or RTX tinted glasses of today.

---
Ah, I see. Thank you for the answer.
---
I loved dropping Flashbang Trap in small corridors in dungeons. Even though I was sacrificing my own eyes, it was hilarious to hear my party in Discord light up in sarcastic fury. Always dropped it when things were getting a little dry and quiet to keep us on our toes.
---
Yo american players, you might want to help us getting language dedicated Servers since a lot of people consider chosing us american over european Servers.
---
From our perspective it might be better to play on a server with 1 foreign language than 24.
---
Or you can help us anyway.
---
Subscription is one of only two viable option for MMOs, as the expenses are permanent and relative to the player count.
---
The other is, obviously, microtransactions. 
---
There is no such thing as a viable upfront-only business model for MMOs, unless you make the system ad-hoc (as in, the clients incur the hosting costs). Even then you need some way to bankroll development, which means expansions and/or DLC.
---
The real indicator they'd already regressed, is the merger happened at all. Their selling out was the point at which they literally sold out.

just ask someone to make you one. ill do it lol
---
&gt; layering (which improves the play experience for all) 
---
That's really not true at all. It solves two very serious and legitimate issues but creates some just as (if not worse) serious and legitimate new ones in the process. If you don't see what kind of issues it creates even on a PvE server, then you don't understand what it is about Classic that has drawn so many of us to it in the first place. Your inane insults, while they probably make you feel really smug, are shit arguments, by the way.
---
I don't like Activision's monetization practices because I feel they negatively impact the game, but let's not pretend like Activision is ordering anybody at Blizzard to fuck with class design, or abandon good systems simply because the expansion ended. Activision just wants a strong platform to milk money off of, and that has its negative influence for sure, but they gain nothing from having products that people don't want to play.
---
The real question is how exactly does this influence affect game design? How cynical does it have to be to no longer be true? Those lines are probably blurrier than you or I would care to admit. What I'm saying is: Activision almost certainly has a predatory influence due to their well documented implementation of monetization practices in their games, but that doesn't convince me that their absence alone would bring about the design philosophies, and frankly, charm, that the Blizzard of old had. Would probably be a great start though if I'm honest.
---
Sorry, but the real world doesn't work this way, in which every thing you don't like is the cause of some vague, singular evil entity. Might as well get religious if you're that gullible. Not that I'm discounting everything faith has to offer an individual, I'm just unable to see this comparison of Activision to Satan, and I really don't think it's that cut and dry like some kind of fairy tale.
---
Dungeon finder was a bad move but before that it was the peak. This is evident not only by the objectively best game design, but also that it had the peak subscriber count. Cataclysm and beyond is where the game declined, both in quality and playerbase
---
The implication was that over the multiple months it takes to reach 40 one would typically be able to ascertain which language their server is.
---
Most of my time on classic I spent pvping, because fuck spamming starfire on mobs as a druid. STV was the place to be lvls 30-45 and then TM vs SS past level 50. It took me around 2 months to get to 60. But am not gona do that this time, am racing to 60 for easier life and ganking in BRM beats all other pvp because there's no mounting inside and people jumped in the lava to run away OMEGALUL
---
I never understood the reasoning behind intentionally picking the least popular of anything. I wouldn't care if more than half the server were hunters, it could be cool, and I'd still pick a hunter and enjoy it just the same.
---
For me I'd rather not play at all if I didn't pick what I liked the most.
---
Improved sap is quality of life thing imo.
---
Play what you enjoy you will be with this char for months. I mained NE Priest and was in fairly good guilds on server most of vanilla and BC, cleared all raids except naxx and sunwell without anyone giving shit about race, there are people who enjoy dwarf and you have 4-5 priest slots per raid, probably best priest on our server A side was also NE
---
People care about games when they are new. The hype will be there at launch. That's when most people will try it.
---
I mean im not saying it should be a deal breaker but there are clearly downsides to playing popular classes, less raid and BG spots, more loot competitions and stuff like that. But i cant think of any upsides
---
There's always a reason behind the pop numbers. Is a class overpopulated? That means it's very fun to play. Is it scarce? That means many players dislike the class. You can roll a druid which makes up roughly 7-8 percent of every faction but you should absolutely make sure that you're gonna enjoy playing one at the cost of being a special snowflake.
---
Let me also point out that once you're level 60, being an overpopulated class has almost 0 disadvantages. More warriors or rogues in a server does not mean more warriors and rogues in raid cores for you to compete with. The numbers in raiding are mostly static throughout phases. Competing for gear will only be a problem during pre-bis. (And honestly, every single class has to compete. This is just a part of the game.)
---
We absolutely need all those classes to be overpopulated. Imagine a server with 50% druid characters and your faction only has 8% warriors. How painful would that be?
---
Layering allows new players to not be mobbed by 100,000 expert, practiced vets like you. Let the servers die down a bit. Let newbies go thier own way and find there own stories. The wall of text you posted is counter to your intent. No new player can compete on your level. Stop peeing in their kiddie pool.

---
This is all true! Since you obviuosly see all the benefits and flaws of AM I will gladly tag you in the post and I will indeed prove you wrong (but onlu to some extent thoigh since you are completely right in everything you write). :)
---
&gt; if there are 2x the amount of people playing there should be 2x the resources. To equal out the supply and demand.
---
I don't think you put much thought into this, but the resources will not be farmed equally by all people. When there is a higher potential for money making (more resources), there will be a greater incentive for the most hardcore players to control those resources.
---
So let's take Black Lotus for example. Let's imagine that they're so rare that if you put a concentrated effort into farming them, you make about 30 gold an hour. That's not very profitable, so the top players won't bother with it. They'll do farms that make them 50-100+ gold per hour, and then buy the Black Lotuses. In this scenario the majority of Black Lotuses will just be collected at random, by players coming across them in the field. This is a great opportunity for these players since they'll be receiving a large windfall of gold randomly without investing the time of actually farming them.
---
Now if you crank up the speed at which you can acquire the resource, it becomes one of the best ways to make money in the game. Now those top tier players who weren't interested in farming them will be controlling the resource 24/7 and cooperating to fix the prices.
---
We know this is true because we've seen the same thing with devilsaurs on private servers. It's one of the fastest ways to make money in the game, especially at the start of a server when everyone needs the gear, so we see unprecedented cooperation between the top tier players to control the resource and set prices on the leather.
---
So, it's not simply a matter of supply and demand. The supply has a massive impact on the players' actions, and those actions have significant consequences.
---
Also, layering has a bunch of other problems unrelated to the economy.

Player falloff mostly happens because the games suck, though, because they do not correctly understand what the formula actually was. Iirc, the games that grew over time were VWoW and EVE Online. Most of the games released after WoW look like they were designed by a raider, the people who scream "the game begins at max level", or that dude at Blizzard who was freaked out only 1% of people were raiding.
---
But that means the game is appealing to a 99% of the population doing *something else*. And I think the something else part is where all these games somehow continued to fuck up, repeatedly, because it seems they were not designed by people who actually played the game.
---
Pretty much every released MMO disregarded the leveling experience. It was uninspired and tedious and no bonds were formed in it. This extremely includes Wildstar. I was very excited for it, but when I played it, it was extremely obvious that the only thing the game was really interested in adapting from Vanilla was raiding. The leveling experience was gutted, cross-zone questing or class quests were not a thing, I don't recall grouping very often or forming connections, professions weren't interesting, and I do not recall significant skillup milestones, either. I have like no memories left from that game.
---
I have memories from every PServer I played.
---
The other thing that a lot of these games do is make it more fast paced or action-like. Wildstar was really bad at this where you basically have to keep clicking a button to do a basic attack (interestingly, BfA also has this). In VWoW, there's actually quite a bit of lul time, it's significantly calmer, and there's less of a feel of "oh shit I need to be pressing something". Why would you put twitchy combat into a game with long haul appeal? It's a contradiction. Keep it slower paced RPG style, please, or go make a Darkfall clone instead.

:^)
---
I was thinking of tanking all the way through vanilla with a warrior, but would i be able to pvp with him tho? Due to the gear, and respeccing i mean
---
I wont be wasting mana on launch
---
This is misleading - it was their parent companies that merged not Activision and Blizzard. The new parent company Activision Blizzard owns both.
---
I wouldn't dishonor Theoden like that. The more likely comparison is that Activision is Saruman and Blizzard would be Grima.
---
Tauren female Druids are 99% of the time played by women in their 30s
---
This is my prediction as well.
---
Breaking up overfilled servers will be fun...
---
A single dickbutt, FINAL OFFER!
---
Always remember, in a full 40men raid there will likely be 3-5 other priests beside you. Two to three dwarf priests are enough for a raid. There will always be a nondwarf priest in each raid. 
---
Also, there are only a couple of bosses who fear tho. So fear ward wont be used anyway at most bosses.
---
Omg I used to love his videos! So glad he is coming back for Classic!
---
You know what the problem is? That it's even worse, Blizzard is Activision, and Activision is Blizzard, it's as if he was fused side to side with that snake tongued devil. We're not getting rid of him.
---
Reddit and the various forums are much more polarised than if you just chill and play the game. Don't let the spergs prevent you from having fun
---
So you're a fan of retail 8.2 transmog changes hmmm?
---
This is not really a new game, though.
---
I expect people to be considerably more guarded and reserved on Vanilla. It's not even a remaster. It's an old game with a disclaimer attached. If people even notice it came out, that is, as I don't think it's actually very hyped.
---
was expecting more drinking.
---
No, I'm looking for a lvl35+ Wand.
---
Will roll a priest to keep my friends alive during our adventures. I have fancied Benediction ever since I equipped The Eye of Shadow on my hunter in TBC.
---
I have the same exact issue with how popular the class is. Not to mention how hard it will be to gear, as you'll be competing with 6-7 other shamans potentially. And if you want gear for enhancement, add in hunters, warriors and rogues (weapons) to the equation. Seems grim tbh. 
---
Druid otoh will compete with only 1-2 more druids. Ugh, decisions, decisions.
---
Thought I was already there at first.
---
Blizzards biggest mistake was listening to a bunch of kids when deciding what they should do.
---
The idea that people (especially kids and teenagers) understand the underlying nuances that make something great and that sometimes challenge, adversity or hard work are what makes the rewards great - not the rewards themselves - is just stupid. The community are not designers.
---
This whole approach of analyzing participation data and thinking "if they spend time doing it, they must like it" or listening to a bunch of short-sighted kids who think noclip (flying) would be the greatest possible addition to game is just terrible.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
And I'll be the first to admit that I was one of these short sighted idiot teenagers who couldn't see the harm in server transfers, name changes ... hell, even class changes (which never happened, but we got boosts now)
---
A game is it's designer's baby. Art in the way that it is a form of expression of what the creator wants to convey to the beholder. It's the artist's job to realize **their** vision and we get to experience it an decide if the artists vision resonates with us (and it's fine if it doesn't. I don't like all music, but there is plenty of music for me to chose from out there). And if the designer is talented and has an awesome vision to share, people will love it. Not everyone, but some, possibly many.
---
If, however, you always strife for the biggest common denominator, you'll end up with retail WoW. Something that is easily digestable, cause that's what accessibility means. We cannot do anything "fun" because some people might not like it. Streamline everything. We have the metrics, right?
---
Horrible design approach that replaces art with a streamlined product. Classic wow was art. Some people sat down and created THEIR vision of what they wanted to share with the people. That's why it was beloved. After that they increasingly strayed away from "what do we want to express?" towards "what do the people want to get?".
---
As much flak as "you think you do, but you don't" gets, there is a grain of truth in it. 
---
But the context is what made this quote idiotic. I know I like classic. I played it for years and again on pservers. Thousands of people have. Telling us "you won't like what you know you like" is different from "you lack design insight to realize the impact your demands will have in the future". It's hilariously ironic.
---
&gt;because they don't have spell batching
---
They observably do, just at shorter intervals than vanilla blizzlike batching.
---
&gt; Also, it is a big deal because if it's not possible to combat trap someone without scattershot it's a huge loss for PvP hunters.
---
It is still possible most of the time. It will just fail occasionally.
---
You always scatter trap good players to avoid getting frost reflector/skulled on your trap.
---
&gt; perma banned
---
&gt;several times
---
???
---
gratz guys, that looked amazing as fuck!
---
I can even hear the music
---
That's the point. YOU would have fun playing on a server like that (you think you would, but you never tried). Do you really think everyone else is like you? 
---
Do you think the people complain about EU servers just because they're bored?
---
There's a reason for that. If you want to find it out, just play on an EU server. But you won't, because you're not forced to be on one. But we are, and we don't have any other choice.
---
At least we might get our German and French (and maybe even more) servers then
---
For people that haven't played it and just want to try it is a new game. They hear people talking about it and fear of missing out kicks in. It's how a ton of people consume games nowadays. Play it at launch or toss it on the pile of shame that got bought but not played because it's now 2 months old and something else is coming out.
---
When you rode your wolf by here did you see a sign outside that said ‚ÄúDead Troll storage‚Äù?
---
Grizzly hills am I right?
---
&gt; with less people hitting 60 the materials found in the open worlds value will be decreased.. 
---
High level mats, sure.   This really has nothing to do with layering either...  This would happen without layering, except the server would be dead.
---
&gt;  3-4 times the availability and a normal amount of lvl 60‚Äôs to use them.
---
Except there's 3 to 4 times the population.  At least in the very early days, but most of those will be gone extremely quickly.  By the time most people get to 60 there probably won't be that many layers.
---
 There will be more mats per capita than there otherwise would be, but certainly no 3 to 4x as many.  
---
&gt; Hello 50g Blotus, 30s Ghost Mushroom, Fadeleaf, Grave Moss.. you get the point
---
This matters, because?
---
I've had the same experience myself on a pserver... and I must say I was willing to pay for a subscription to play Classic, but after watching the streamers show all the flaws and bugs that are there, well it just makes one sad and I don't see the devs working on Classic having it ready come August 27th.
---
And I damn sure don't see them having these bugs here fixed.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bwlfdu/the_definitive_hunter_bug_compilation_sheet/?sort=new
---
And so I will continue to play on said pserver and have the greatest time playing with a great community of some the friendly people you could ever ask for.
---
The upsides are why they are popular..
---
That's crazy. I was about to ask if you would stake your life on it.
---
Then go back to r/wowcirclejerk so you can talk about how Classic, Wrath and basically anything huge amount of the playerbase likes sucks and BfA is the best expansion ever. If you don't like it here you're free to leave, christ.
---
I don't mind circlejerk subs, but r/wowcirclejerk is just as pathetic as r/asoiafcirclejerk.
---
Seize the ass toucher!
---
Pfft, Race/Class combo rarity  is where it's at. Are Rogues popular? Fuck yeah they are, but if you roll a female Dwarf or a Female Troll rogue, everyone will stop and look and think "huh, that's neat".
---
Anyway, census data is to be taken with a grain of salt. People pick things differently when they know the meta is going to be 30 or 40 cap. Take that data with a big big grain of salt.
---
The issue is that a lot of these countries that have their own servers, usually don't speak english as well as the rest of europe. From my own experience that is.
---
I'm not sure where you got the idea that I work for Youtube, but unless you're logging out of your account constantly, there should be no reason that an account becomes unblocked.
---
All the hate on actiblizz but we‚Äôre all hoping their next release(classic) has millions of players. Maybe if it does well enough they can fire 800 people again.
---
yeah I mean we can keep playing on private servers
---
Don't give Blizzard a sub that they will add it to 8.2.
---
Just don't.
---
and what if the moon is made of cheese?  lol
---
I am totally casual today having a job, wife, kids, eSports amateur team. I will not play any near to the vanilla times. Maybe 10 hours a normal week and 20 if I get family on vacation. Guess what, I will not drop off.
---
Yeah ive heard hunters had to do this lol, ridiculous
---
You wont have any downtime. Youll be standing meleeing just like the warrior, putting down Str and WF totem, Only using Rank1 Earth Shock to interupt casters and Rank1 Frost Shock to snare in PVP if the warrior cant reach them to hamstring.  Between those points you will never need to have downtime yoursel. You will run like clock work
---
From a Horde perspective: 
---
Dwarves are often chill and cool. I feel the least amount of desire to pvp with them, rather I'm inclined to be friendly. 
---
Males NEs hunters I hate the most. They'll attack me at any point of time, they are very ugly and egotistical, and their atrocious bow animation is the finisher, the cherry on top, the last hit nail. In stead of rolling Tauren Druid, I'm considering going for a different main just so I can hard counter hunters, that's how I hate you male NEs!
---
I agree in general with your comments - but the reference client is unlikely to ever be accessible publicly, so we are stuck with some stuff that can be 100%  proven being proven wrong, and some stuff that some people think is wrong having no public data set to compare against.
---
the normalization issue was just a very short set of numbers to verify.  a number of other  things are also just numbers  to verify, but we have never actually seen those numbers.
---
You posted this twice
---
The heroics were a joke. Maybe not at launch, but they had 0 longevity. 
---
WotlK wasn't all out shit but as you say it laid the shit framework BUT ALSO already was shit in certain regards.
---
Multiple raid difficulties and sizes, easy heroics, way easier leveling experience, the desecration of Naxxramas, Dragon mounts for everyone (the artistic integrity started going down here. I miss when a WoW army looked medieval, with Horses and Rams. Nowadays it looks like a clown show with everyone riding spectacular dragons, flaming birds and battle mechs...)
---
Many of these weren't apparent as problems back then, but I for one stopped after Naxx (because holy shit I was not gonna farm that easy as hell crap for months) and when I came back was super annoyed by the easy heroics. These things were bad even back then.
---
Prot warriors are good for tanking the final bosses in AV matches and can be ok as flag carriers in WSG. Generally in PVP you are more of an annoyance than an actual threat though.
---
VanCleef pay BIG for your head
---
If an orc warlock completes dreadsteed quests, can he buy an epic wolf and just ride it at full speed or does it need additional training?
---
He doesnt get the Richard reference? 
---
OMG For Pony!
---
Sometimes these posts feel like astroturfing. I understand some people may prefer layering for various reasons, but straight up telling people "It can't possibly break the economy" is just wat.
---
He is the hardcore guy. The others are just normies.
---
Does Mages Icebarrier profits from spelldmg? And if yes, anyone got the coefficient?
---
They' merged there is no ActiVision and Blizzard there is ActiBlizzard ppl which worked on Blizz side left long ago
---
They've reset the forums a couple times and somehow I've managed to get back on the naughty list after a while each time... also, like many people, I had two accounts so I could talk to my horde buddies.
---
I'm pretty sure that Blizzard ruined wow on their own. Also, Activision makes single player games.
---
good riddance, go back to the pirated trash world buff meta.
---
so which 1 is correct?
---
Honestly? I wouldn't be mad if they did end up going with this change. If your bow is creaking and crackling when you draw it, your bow is fucking *busted*. I understand it's a fantasy world but jesus. Real bows don't creak unless you're trying to break them.
---
I don't necessarily disagree with you but then again I don't think the entire early game should be designed with these people in mind, these people who ARE tourists and ARENT going to be playing the game anyways, the real players are going be left with the potentially game-breaking after effects of layering long after the tourists have come and gone.
---
Blizzard priorities lie with the come and go gamer yet again, as we have seen countless times before they are not interested in the retaining players, they just want the quick in and out give us your money and fuck off.
---
tauren druides are stoned at anytime of the day.
---
always forget there buffmats
---
&gt;WOTLK was the high point of WOW subscriptions and is generally considered a high point for WOW
---
Could you maybe find other explanations for this that don't just confirm your views?
---
The story and the main villain were amazing and highly anticipated, with the Arthas story being the main focus of WC3 and very beloved. The increased accessibility also raked in lots of pop-culture gamers that would never have played classic, leading Blizzard to believe that there is money to be made by catering to the masses rather than their die hard fanbase.
---
The question is, if WotlK had been a later expansion, would it have been this successful? It greatly benefited from the popularity classic and TBC established and then sold those fanbases out for a bigger, more volatile audience.
---
Would you have liked WotlK if it hadn't been for Arthas? If you had the exact same gameplay in a different setting? Like literally the layouts and mechanics with a different story, villain and location?
---
from this subreddit‚Äôs perspective objective retail sub number is 2,5 whiteknights while vanilla is going to have more than 100 million.
---
Not my fault you don't know what you write yourself. But I'll spell it out for everyone to see.
---
&gt;it's unlikely that most of these bugs will be fixed at launch.
---
&gt;it's unlikely that they will be able to fix 43 of them
---
These 2 sentences are widely different, sorry you don't know how to read :).

Look...BfA sold those copies in 7 months, from January to August. Retail players, being dummies, were tricked by a CINEMATIC, that was full of lies...but, it looked pretty.
---
BfA is a massive failure.
---
It doesn't matter that it sold 3+ million copies, when less than 1 million are playing it.
---
That is a failure.

---
Well, case settled.

Yeah, will see :D
---
&gt;somehow I've managed to get back on the naughty 
---
You mean your "friend" did, right?
---
The big difference is that the top brass of blizz are now all activision guys. All the ones that had blizzard in them left because of the changes, so not really willing servitude imo.
---
This sub always out jerk wowcirclejerk
---
ohh man, not the gurubashi trinket....  Who gives a fuck about that stupid trinket?
---
I'm not entirely sure what I'll roll but if I end up doing mage again, I'm not gonna level with an utterly retarded spec again.
---
Harry even knew about classic before the original wow was even released
---
Only if you have enough gold to learn riding and buy a mount
---
Yeah, that guy! Not enough caffeine yet today...
---
&gt; Unless it's really only 2-3 people out of the thousands of players per server
---
I was thinking more like 2-3 guilds not players.
---
&gt;That's a "classic hype" problem and not a layer problem. If there were no layers Blizzard had to create more servers that get merged in the end. 5 servers generate the same amount of lotuses than 5 layers, so the total amount of lotuses after the potential big drop in players would be the same.
---
No it's really not because you are talking as if every single was made with the intention to be later merged, when in reality it's only a handful of servers that would be effected by merges.
---
Honestly I'm not trying to be a dick but it feels like you just don't know how this will play out because you've never seen it before, it's totally understandable but with all due respect you might have played vanilla back in the day, but people who have carried on playing it have it "solved" if you will and you shouldn't under estimate what these nerds are capable of. If what I say happens (and it will) to even half the degree that I expect, some servers could really have broken economies for the rest of the game and that would suck big time for those people.
---
Can Warlock be played using less dots as possible ? Like a mage ? Because spamming dots on every mob in a dungeon doesn't sound fun to me.

&gt; It might be more convenient for you if people adapt to your Language, but that would be inconvenient for them and quite unfair if you ask me.
---
I am sorry but I disagree. We are not talking about having conversations on a scientific level here. We are talking about basic communication in a gaming environment.
---
The case of French people who don't like to speak an international language in the gaming community is a self made problem. If you are not willing, for whatever reason, to adapt to the common sense that english is needed to communicate then it is your short coming.
---
For the people who don't feel comfortable to write English, there is always the possibility to get better at it by *trying*. But when people refuse to try they lost all my sympathy.
---
Upvote cause this is really important and needs a fix!

Is Phantom Menace *really* an all time classic, though?
---
How do you rate Hunter/Mage duo leveling? I see a lot of synergy in being able to kite enemies and having a fair amount of DPS/CC. I'm also assuming I can feed conjured food to my pet (providing they eat bread). This is 90% likely to be the makeup of my friend and I leveling together I'm just wondering if there's any quirks I haven't though of.
---
the big problem they faced with vanilla was that most of the "inaccessible" content was time gated and you needed to coordinate with at least 40 others for part of said content, it was a logistics problem for most people, that isn't the best game design for a game that would be inaccessible 2 years down the road and that requires a monthly sub
---
that being said, they went so far out in the other direction that now nothing feels nearly as rewarding
---
Yes, and shouldnt be excluded.
---
cause they identify with big fat ugly cows? lol
---
People like you and me are why the game will slowly die.
---
I have about the same amount of time available which means it will take me months (at least 4 but realisticaly it will be around 6) to get to 60. I can already kiss raiding goodbye and any kind of serious PvP.
---
And when people see that at max level you're either putting in huge amounts of time to get anywhere in the game or jumping around on Orgrimmar bank LFMing for UBRS it will turn them away.
---
Blizzard has introduced wellfare epics in TBC already and the biggest reason for it were players complaining they don't feel rewarded for the time put in the game if they aren't raiding at least 3 times per week for 4 hours. These issues won't go away, they will only be more aparent because of the change in culture over the last 15 years.
---
"HAHA NO U"
---
is this how americans communicate with each other? no wonder your politics are the laughing stock of the planet.
---
Well obviously. The real question is why does spell batching have to be a thing they bring back. I think the no changes crowd is retarded but insisting on it‚Äôs implementation, it sounds like way too much work and something that‚Äôs just going to be bodged into working.
---
He goes by Iron bladder.
---
Will this be fixed in classic?
---
Always running in stormwind doing a motorcycle sound when I get it for like 15 minutes.

Deadmines = TM (Todesminen)
---
WC = HdW (H√∂hlen des Wehklagens)
---
SFK = BSF (Burg Schattenfang)
---
RFK = Kral
---
SM = just Kloster lol
---
UBRS = OBRS (Obere Blackrock Spitze, although this one was quite rare)
---
These are the ones I remember definitely beeing used some times, but most people actually used the english ones, at least later on.
---
Your "authentic vanilla" is actually private servers.
---
Melee leeway, spell delay and spell batching were in retail vanilla but people suddenly don't want the vanilla mechanics
---
Either that or he and his friends are very intimate.
---
Because australia is so isolated from the rest of the world it makes for some really long freight routes so a lot of the glassware and tableware gets broken on the journey. This makes the glassware and tableware a lot more expensive so it's mainly rich families that can afford glasses. So yeah most normal people just use shoes instead
---
Sodapoppin is thinking about taking a few months off streaming to play classic wow in peace.
---
The quotes are most likely from his chat, considering the first and last quote are the same.
---
OP is farming karma
---
Why do people watch streamers in the first place? Honestly? You‚Äôre watching someone else play a video that you yourself can play
---
why did tbc kill the lore?
---
And how is a Mage surviving the Druid's opener without Ice Barrier or Ice Block? Druid will open with Ravage, then Feral Charge + Bash immediately after Blink. Mage trinket doesn't break stuns. Ice Block is the only way out.
---
Agreed, I know it's not 100% the same, but I actually like the sound of the "impact"!
---
leeway was in vanilla IIRC.
---
Try The Silver Hand my friend
---
It was already out of the game by 1.12 . Hopefully Blizzard will bring it back for a few days.
---
okay that hit me offguard too.
---
shamans &gt; everything..
---
THE SERVER ECONOMY IS DOOMED was one of your biggest arguments against layering, lol.
---
I might be a minority here, but I don't think this should be a them vs us thing. Personally I can enjoy both.
---
&gt;Don't gatekeep and pretend the people who still claim layering will ruin the game care more about the game than the rest of us.
---
Well thats why I said "Uhh could it not be that" I never said it was that, fuck me for being optimistic right? I guess it's easier to just make blanket statements like omggg these people are hatersssss fuck them all.
---
It would be interesting if we had some way to measure who actually plays/played the game and cross reference it with a list of people who are for/against layering. 
---
If I was rich i'd pay for that research myself.
---
You dont get it. Its ok
---
Because layering actually does ruin the economy, while merging does not? lol, too difficult for you to understand or what
---
&gt; was time gated
---
I don't get this one, tbh. What was time gated about vanilla? Talking about the scarcity of loot that you needed to progress? Attunements?
---
Outside of raid lockouts I cannot really remember any time gating off the top off my head.
---
Thats the same kind of shit you used to read back in vanilla to wrath (i quit in cata so I dont know for how long it lasted). Along with political and religious BS.
---
I never meant to argue it didn't thin the herd, I did use the word reduce which was meant to be solve.
---
I've made multiple posts about this and while you read reduce you sure didn't want to read solve in all the other comments.
---
My point still stands, layering does not solve overcrowding, it thins the herd (which is far from good enough.)
---
The only thing it accomplishes is removing server queues.
---
That cast bar went FAR too fast, it's a 3 year cast time c'mon.
---
I wouldn't say it killed it, but it squandered Illidan's story and potential to such a degree they had to retcon him and bring him back. His story in BC was basically "No one likes me so I will be brooding upon my temple. Oh no I am dead." Before they retconed a reason for this.
---
There won't be as many shamans as the polls say.
---
It's one thing to click on a poll because you feel like playing a shaman but it's completely different to slog through leveling with a class that isn't very fun to level and is forced to play support in endgame.
---
Same goes for paladins. Once they get to 30 and realize they're maybe 1/4 through leveling process they will reroll mages and rogues like they did in vanilla.
---
You mean realm 3 and not level 3?
---
A subscription based game needs to retain players. Making lots of great promises and leeching of the success of it's predecessor to get a big headstart means nothing if 3 months down the line everyone unsubbed.
---
They have servers to run and content creators to pay. Yea, they probably still made plenty of money but they also know that this is not sustainble.
---
The WoD/BfA team sucks.
---
Yes. Mobs usually dont live long enough for the dots to be worth it anyway, once gearlevels reach a certain point.
---
During leveling however Dots are highly recommended.
---

Aint nobody that can afford a mount at 40! Oooo ladida Mr Moneybags!
---
From lvl 60 on you spam shadowbolts just like a mage. Just having corruption up for Nightfall procs.
---
Warlocks (and Paladins) automatically get the corresponding riding skill upon recieving the mount spell.
---
So yes: you can buy your factions mount without needing to learn riding. 
---
Aside form mount asthetics it even has a small gameplay ramification: You are traiding an inventory slot vs using mana (and disrupting mana reg for 5 s) on the mount spell.
---
You can use a wolf, training skill is provided.
---
Ouch.
---
You have to take demand into account too. Yes there are fewer druids than shamans but the demand for shamans are 3-4 higher.
---
Bruh, get the sand out of your vagina before you input your two cents. There‚Äôs no reason to be a douche unprovoked. 
---
The trinket alone isn‚Äôt the issue, the fact that you can abuse layering is. All I did was provide a well known example. 
---
As far as the layering is concerned, given the amount of resources at Blizzards disposal I guarantee they could find a way to make it work given that the last time I played retail they already had a similar system already in place.

It is very complicated to asses the dropout rate for Classic, for a multitude of reasons. Generally speaking, most MMORPGs and expansions suffer a 50% dropout rate few weeks in. 
---
Classic is neither an expansion, nor a new MMORPG. It is a new MMORPG for players that haven't played it before, but it is an old MMORPG for players that did. I expect that for the new players, the dropout rate to be around 50% (the normal rate), while for old players I expect to be minimal, maybe 5-10%.
---
But, there is the BfA player in the equation. I expect a higher dropout rate for the BfA players that play Classic, around 70-80% few weeks in.
---
What we DON'T KNOW, is how many new players will try Classic, how many old players will resub to WoW to play Classic, and how many BfA players will play Classic at launch.
---
What we know is that there won't be that many new players, compared to old players and BfA players, so we can remove them from the equation.
---
The dropout rate will entirely depend on the ration between old players that will resub to WoW and existing BfA players that will try Classic.
---
And we have NO IDEA how many will they be. We don't even know how many BfA players are. We can assume, sure, but still we don't know how many players will return to WoW.
---
My personal opinion is that most BfA players will try Classic in the launch period. I will go and say that around 2 million BfA player will do it, and the rest won't...but I am assuming 3 million BfA player base. It might be 2 million or 4 million, and this changes everything.
---
I also expect at least 5 million returning players. It might be 1 million, or 2 million or 8. Or more. We have no freaking idea.
---
So, all we can assume is the normal dropout rate of around 50%.
---
The people who will be rushing to 60 dont need that tip and the people that are planning on enjoying the journey well.. they dont need that tip either. But because they should ignore it.
---
Clearly fake, NO ONE is safe from corrupted blood.

If you don't understand why spell batching was important to the feel of vanilla, you have no idea what you're talking about. Spell batching is crucial to the way vanilla worked - primarily in PvP. It raises the skill ceiling for so many classes. I, too, am annoyed at what I'm seeing in OP's vid, but that isn't spell batching, it's blizzard's crappy attempt at implementing it and no it isn't "too hard" to get done right, they probably just didn't account for certain edge cases or channelled ticks.
---
Flashbacks to calling up my friend with the better PC to turn in quests or learn skills for me in SW because it was too laggy for me to walk through lol.
---
Same here, the years turned me soft used to do nothing but PvP and now I just /wave and hope I don't get attacked. 
---
 Still it's a tricky choice going PvE or PvP server for classic. Even if you never attack someone it adds something when you always have to be aware of your surroundings and the possibility of getting attacked. Would feel weird running around without ever have to worry about anything. What to choose, what to choose...
---
Raiding Org/Stormwind as your own "rogue" faction was the best part for me.
---
I agree - solely on the basis that there is no fight at all. It is **clearly* DM ! /s
---
Simple as: pin the tail to the undead mage.
---
Most people will quit before level 40
---
Nah, you are just oversimplying the issue making your point meaningless. But it is ok.
---
&gt; How do you plan to spend the first week?
---
Just the first week? Powerleveling.
---
I'm aiming for a 30 hour play session on launch day.     
---
After that it‚Äôs six hours of sleep and leveling for the rest of the day all the way to 60.
---
I levelled three characters back in Vanilla and four additional ones over the years on private servers, so I don‚Äôt think it will take away much from my gameplay experience - I can still "enjoy the ride" with any alt characters after that. 
---
I will miss out on a bit of the social aspect due to that, but I already have a guild that I‚Äôll be rolling with and socializing at level 60 will still be fine :)
---
keeping spell batching while complaining about leeway is silly, both are outdated mechanisms
---
Because you cant get ganked at 60 right? üòÇ
---
Nahh, 
---
Since the sub is tied to a retail sub, there will be a ton of retail players that log in to try it out, and most likely won‚Äôt stay and will return to retail.
---
You are ignoring a whole sect of players; people who join game launches because they are exited to be a part of the social event. The actual game doesn‚Äôt matter, they just want to be there on launch when everyone is playing and taking about it.
---
I‚Äôd love for them to actually take a serious shot at making it a thing. Don‚Äôt instagib everyone‚Äôs low level characters, but make it a concern that needs dealt with (at least intermittently) on a community level. Might work better in retail than classic as it really is new content.

Man you would hate being a QA tester

We the hivemind...desire above average classic wow YouTube content, apparently. It's been stuck in my head for a solid 24 hours now.
---
I explain to you like your 5. It doesnt matter why the class is popular. If mages were the least played class would some of the upsides go away? No. Would some of the downsides go away? Yes
---
&gt; The trinket alone isn‚Äôt the issue, the fact that you can abuse layering is.
---
Abuse to what end?  to get a shit trinket?  lol  The horror!  think of the children.
---
I'm starting to feel like this. They are *coming across* lazy and apathetic, cutting costs at every corner and allowing so many game breaking bugs. Almost like want to say 'you thought you did but you didnt'.
---
Just look at Lightshope.org , they have at EVERY TIME more than 5.000 Players on prime time 12.000+ and the server doesn't lag. Beside that it's the old vanilla client. 
---
IF they have fucked up their game so much that they can't handle 3.500+ people on a server forked from their shitty fuck 8.0 BFA trash engine, we're fucked...
---
yes. it's 10%.

Also the most intimidating sight when you catch one running at you in  WSG
---
I'm afraid to see how you all look like after a couple of months, as this is how you all look at launch!
---
Layering will be gone by the time world bosses start
---
you think merging servers wouldn't ruin the economy... lol
---
layering actually doesn't fuck up the economy.  It would at worst slightly increase the amount of mats per capita.  But that wouldn't ruin the economy by any stretch.
---
We set up warning signs for rampant ovens, and then turn it into a holiday destination.

Stupid question.

Maybe the players thinned because it was the middle of the night? :P

Troll hunter.
---
&gt; Hell it happens for literally ever WoW expansion 
---
Ermm...TBC and Wrath had continuous growth. MoP had almost zero dropout rate.
---
Not mentioning Vanilla who had the highest growth. But you said expansions, and you are wrong.
---
TBC, Wrath and MoP had either growth or minimal dropout. Hell, even Cata had less than 10% dropout in the first 3 months.
---
The only expansions of WoW that lost a significant number of players, are WoD and BfA.
---
2 out of 7...that is CLEARLY not "literally every WoW expansion"...

Cannibalize is a great boon to any class in classic. Also undead are edgy and suit cloth well. Good choice

add it to the list

Lol you clearly didnt click the link. And wasted all that time.

As a spelladin if u get all your Pre Raid BiS. 
---
You wont need anything until t2. 
---
And thats it your done gearing for the rest of Classic (Unless you want Corrupted Ashbringer or something)

So you dont roll on ANYTHING a warrior would want, you bring strong dps without the loot competition.
---
Try again.

By time gating people often mean having to put 10+ hours a day for a couple of months to get rank 14

or the need to farm a shit ton just to be able to get enough stats to survive the final 2 raids specially
---
if you had a "normal" lifestyle, or rather, a healthy lifestyle, most wouldn't have the time to try for those things and that was a problem for a big chunk of the community, it wasn't mechanically challenging to raid, but you sure as fuck wouldn't go to Naxx if you didnt have the **time**

If I were I'd replace the new sound file with the old one? This is a low priority issue that might never get dealt with.
---
SFK was always BSF (Burg Schattenfang on my server).
---
&gt;No it's really not because you are talking as if every single server was made with the intention to be later merged, when in reality it's only a handful of servers that would be effected by merges.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Honestly I'm not trying to be a dick but it feels like you just don't know how this will play out because you've never seen it before
---
What are you even talking about? You have never seen it either, because the current situation has never existed before. This is not some random private server launch with a few thousand people. We're talking about WAY more.
---
One of the purposes of layers is to combat dead servers. Blizzard plans layers with the size of a full server, and multiple layers per server. Blizzard also plans to remove layering completely at a later time.
---
There's only ONE logical outcome for that: Blizzard assumes that 80%+ of the player base from the classic launch will quit. That's actually pretty likely based on the hype around it and the wrong expectations many people have about it. The game is grindy in the end and clearly not what many people nowadays want from a game.
---
If Blizzard doesn't do layering, they have to ramp up server amounts. Instead of one server with 5 layers, there would be 5 servers. Once the population dies down, do you think Blizzard keeps those servers at e.g. 600 players? No, there would be merges, maybe server transfers. It doesn't matter though, because the end goal would be again, one big server with 3k people, and these 3k people from 5 different servers had the same access to lotus than 3k people from 1 server with 5 layers. There is no difference.
---
Thanks, I laughed out lol
---
God you're an arrogant incel. This is obviously not intended, nor is it actually spellbatching. It's a bug.
---
What were the name of RFD? I cant remember.
---
Thanks for the link. Pretty useful. Saved. 10% is disappointing though.
---
If this stays in the game it makes my choice about rolling a mage or something else a lot easier. Thank you Blizzard /s

There might be a few more i cant remember. Doubt its more than 5 tho

yah, fking sux man.  I kind of wanted to play a shamn again, maybe as dps, but not if the population is that high.  saman aren't even that good...

I think the added puncture sounds from classic are making it better, personally.
---
&gt;This is what you end up with when you insist on #nochanges
---
No, it really isn't. The natural response to a wish for #nochanges isn't to enhance and break those mechanics.
---
"Oh you want the authentic experience even with all the flaws? Well alright, you can have the flaws. On steroids. Let's see how you like those #nochanges when the flaws are enhanced tenfold"

I played a human retadin back in classic, always waiting for it to get good, maybe its the gear i asked myself, maybe i need a super epic weapon i said.

I always hated and loved PvPing alliance.
---
On one side I hate dying to gank squads, on the other side I'd hate if all alliance players were passive people never engaging. 
---
Where is the fun on a PvP server when you only have pacifist people?
---
That's why I am rolling a warrior. Ni need to buy a mount, just charge from one mob to another.
---
Are you on hard drugs?
---
thank you i really appreciate the feedback somethings ill for sure improve on but generally I'm less of a numbers cruncher but ill try be a bit more original in future
---
I agree wholeheartedly with you. People argue back, that, quote on quote, people log off all the time and immersion isn't a good argument, but that's bullshit. 
---
That's the most important argument for an mmo. Otherwise, as you said, there's no good reason to invest time into the game. 
---
If someone I'm ganking disappears into thin air by being invited into a group, I'd feel cheated. 
---
If I aggro too many mobs and intentionally get layered away through an invite, and thus the mobs disappear and I just saved my skin - that's breaking immersion. 
---
If someone herbs a BL, then "teleports to another dimension" where he can herb the same BL, well though luck, to me this world's is no longer convincible.

---
correct spell batching isn't any better
---
Disagree on the raid spots.
---
Have you compared the numbers of Druids vs Warriors in a raid? I have seen lots of raids with 1, maybe 2 druids. Just as many raid sport 6 or more warriors in a raid. that still means the warrior population can be 3-6 times as high as druids and still find a raid spot just as easily.
---
That works pretty much til twin emperors.
---
Spellbatching is nice, being able to gouge a guy that blinks at the same time feels so good or other similar stuff. Problem to me seems that it's "way to slow" to react to spells with slows
---
There's already been so many changes at this point, that continuing to say no changes is laughable.
---
lol all big vanilla servers can take up to 12.000 without lag with vanilla engine.
---
If Blizzard can't handle these with their forked shitty fuck enginge 8.0 from BFA for Classic WoW we're totally fucked. 
---
Mayyybe they just have rewritten the vanilla client and take the mangos server (even cheaper as fork this shit).
---
Kill Kel thuzad. I only killed nef in vanilla. On pserver I have come extremely close, though.
---
Duels have been interesting to people for thousands of years.
---
&gt;New content is completely stupid and antithetical to the whole point of doing classic in the first place.
---
Why would it be? What do you think will happen after Naxx was released and ran for a few months? People NEED content over time. Either it's new classic servers from time to time, TBC servers or something like completely new content made from scratch. The amount of people willing to play classic forever without any new content is minuscule.
---
I think RFD was just H√ºgel.
---
jesus christ. this is 2007 in one video
---
The specific issue was player retention, which arguably was correct. Classic being this sought after is an extreme response to an opposite extreme where the game was way to ‚Äòaccessible‚Äô. Players want the polar opposite. You see the same mechanics pretty much everywhere, politics being an obvious example. 
---
Would love to play a game where they got the balance they were looking for exactly right, I‚Äôm thinking somewhere between tbc and wotlk for me personally. 
---
Not to say I‚Äôm not gonna play the shit out of classic.

---
The sentence before your quote strongly suggests they enjoyed the non-arthas bits of the expansion at least as much as the arthas bits.
---
Looks like you need some fallout in your life to make those specific nightmares into dreams :)
---
Why is it unrealistic?
---
&gt;Pfft, Race/Class combo rarity is where it's at. Are Rogues popular? Fuck yeah they are, but if you roll a **female Dwarf** or a **Female Troll** rogue, everyone will stop and look and think "huh, that's **disgusting**".

Most shortcuts were "english" on german servers, as the localisation of every name happened way later in WoWs history. The only differces I remember were:
---
- hdw (wailing cavern)
---
- bsf (shadowfang keep)
---
- tm (dead mines)
---
- db (dire maul)
---
There might've been some other, mostly low level, dungeons that used german shorts, but I don't remember these. What I do remember is that endgame dungeons and raids used english shorts. Nobody ever said "gc" Geschmolzener Kern) instead of mc. It has always been mc (molten core). Same with bwl or even dungeons such as ubrs, lbrs, brd. These days I expect everyone to use english shorts.
---
However, I am quite confident this'll be different for french people. French people tend to be very bad at english due to their educational system, thus it's way more likely they'll be using french shorts instead of the english ones.
---
Germans who played the game since eu launch used the english abbreviations mostly, for the simple fact that localisation was added patch by patch back.
---
I‚Äôm way for PVP, I‚Äôm against staking out an area where you out level and completely stopping people questing. For the most part, ally pick on weaker and run from even match. Sure, go kill um once, don‚Äôt camp. No honor in camping, but this falls on deaf ears, ally always attracts this kind of player and it is the way it is.
---
I never really got into how Vanilla's *structured* PvP was setup. I would get into WPvP skirmishes all the time, but once all the odd NPCs show up I don't really know what's going on.
---
Is structured PvP worth checking out during leveling? (I don't care too much about being super efficient, just if it's useful/fun at all) Where should I go at what time? Are there any good rewards?
---
Will some of this stuff show up only at Phase II, specifically?
---
"hundreds of dead servers", who's sky-is-falling bullshitting now? 
---
This is not retail we're talking about. Yes, many people will try it out and quit, but you're severely underestimating how good vanilla was. Regardless of commitment, the game feels so rewarding, in a way it's better for casuals than retail is (don't even get me started on hardcore players), cause everything matters, so even getting to 40 feels awesome. Compare that to retail, where a lot of people quit pre-max, due to leveling feeling so bad. 
---
My point is that a much higher percentage will stick around that anticipated.
---
PM'd
---
well this is what the beta is for finding shitlike this before the game launches
---
R.I.P in peace my dude
---
I agree. I enjoy both classic and retail but for different reasons. Classic will never have raids as good as retail for example, and retail will never have the sense of accomplishment you get from classic.
---
Bro, i gotta drink
---
Say no more, fam
---
&gt; Bottom line the hardcore crowd will hang in there, the casuals will drop like flies within 3-6 weeks. Once the hype/nostalgia wears off. 
---
This is the biggest misconception of Retail players.
---
BOTH hardcore and casuals, but ESPECIALLY casuals, will play Classic. And you know WHY? Because there is NO GEAR RESET in Classic, NO DAILIES, NO WQs, NOTHING that forces a player to login every day so he won't LOSE progress.
---
The progress you make in Classic IS PERMANENT, and not ERASED every 4-5 months when a new patch hits.
---
The casual WoW player will GO TO CLASSIC.

So the people in my guild were a colorful sort. Let's start with the GM, he was cool as hell, he worked for Google and also was fervently convinced he was a Bullshido master who could throat rip anyone to death. The Co-Gm, his wife was notorious, she was sweet but the second you logged onto Ventrilo she would unleash what she *thought* was a greeting at a reasonable volume often getting a "I have tinnitus now" groan.
---
Then the stoners, two of them, who psuedo-adopted myself and the gang of 13 year olds we ran with. They were beyond patient and usually just found it funny when we ruined runs with our ineptitude.
---
Guild Dad the Mage is next, insanely geared and just ran with us because they were practically family, we keep In touch to this day and I've known him for almost a decade now maybe a bit longer. He refused to be anything but frost for almost the entirety of the duration I have known him, that always struck me as funny. I felt betrayed when he went arcane, like he'd broken a universal rule made just for him.
---
There was also the typical promiscuous druid, the over confident hunter and the insanely entitled healer who would always threaten to sandbag.
---
 Can't decide if I should go PvE or PvP server. Always played on a PvP server and even if I never attack someone anymore I like the feeling of being in danger, makes the world feel more alive. Still it's annoying as hell a lot of times and really restrict your choices for how to level and grind. 
---
 Would be nice to do stuff like farming Timbermaw rep in Felwood as alliance. It's a good way to level. You get tons of loot and there are lower level Timbermaw mobs down south on the map and up north close to the entrance to winterspring there are higher level ones. So you level early on up until you hit 50, get lots of loot and at the same time push up your rep. Once done with that you can switch to Plaguelands and grind there for rep as you level. 
---
 Regarding character. If I go PvE server I'm rolling troll warrior I think. If PvP it's human warrior or orc/tauren warrior. Logic is troll warriors lacks good racials for PvP so I would regret probably rolling one for world PvP. Played alliance back in the day and on private servers horde. Prefer horde but maybe nice with a change.
---
‚ÄúThe lore‚Äù is going too far, but their story arc plotting for the raids that expansion was Blizzard at its worst. It was GoT season 8, except the players got the crown and then everyone forgot Outland ever existed. The whiny orc teenager, green jesus part one, illidan the emo kid, maeve the angry emo kid. I‚Äôd have to dig for more and I already have remembered more than I want to of that plot. 
---
I think it was better for alliance. Pretty sure they at least didnt have to deal with garrosh.
---
Was gonna say. Only the super gold savvy had mounts at 40. I had to grind a day to get mine. Thing I'd dinged 41 or 42 by the time I had the cash. And that wasn't an epic mount.
---
I rofled so hard laughing I almost fell out of my chair.
---
They were juste xamples and it doesnt mean that they apply all the time to every class in every scenario. Even with your example i wouldnt consider it an upside. Sure you need more warriors than druids but if i played warrior i would certainly like it if they were less popular because then i would have more guild options and more options in ehat role i want to play as a warrior because there would be more open slots overall.
---
It is crucial to the way vanilla felt though, and increased the skill cap of classes in pvp by a large margin, it set the good and the great apart. This is obviously a bug and won't be in the final product. It has nothing to do with the fact that it was used for 2005 hardware and has everything to do with why classic needs to feel like vanilla in-game. A rogue should be able to gouge a blinking mage if they time it well enough, they should be able to vanish a blind if they time it well enough. If those mechanics aren't in the game, many pro pvpers will be outraged and classic won't feel right. You'll end up with a pvp system akin to MOP onwards, which were garbage. It's akin to wave-dashing in super smash bros melee. There is still a huge movement of gamers who play it and are insanely good because of that mechanic alone. No other super smash has compared to it even remotely. https://youtu.be/p7TxKM_Ujgs

Female Dwarf Priest. I played Hunter in vanilla and saw all hard core content - but healed through tbc/wotlk. Haven‚Äôt had the chance to experience Vanilla as a healer, I understand it‚Äôll be different - but I‚Äôm also going to be super casual so I feel like rolling a healer will make it easier to get groups when needed. I‚Äôd probably prefer to be Nelf for shadowmeld (so I can walk away from the PC and play with the baby etc) but dwarf racials are too good to pass up.

Alchemy Herbalism without a doubt - altho will level a bank alt with enchanting to DE my greens to sell on the AH.

Just can‚Äôt wait to play again bro

It's mostly reported by hunters right now, but seems pets are acting dumb. I'm not in beta so idk specifics.

Costs money. You will get tbc.

Dwarf priest, not because fear ward but because i want to play a priest, and dwarf is my favourite race, even tho it fits the warrior or pally better than a priest

Bruh we have had so many amazing games in the past few years alone, there's no such thing as golden age except maybe the age where you were young enough.

I will likely use neither seals or judgements as 32/19/0 healbot. I appreciate the sentiment, though.
---
Honestly,  for all my characters in OG vanilla, I had enough gold around 42 when I was questing/grinding in tanaris. It was perfect because I would go for the carrot on a stick as soon as possible during that time as well haha.
---
I really wish that "mount" existed. Hes so fucking happy. I want to ride him!
---
ayylmaoing @ all the idiots falling for the bait
---
Private servers are a more accurate representation of vanilla wow, leveling on "classic" is so much easier because mobs have like no avoidance at all in the lower levels. In Vanilla it was, miss miss miss Dodge parry glancing glancing miss miss miss. But on classic almost all hits connect as a warrior/rogue

You get the training skill, but you would have to still buy the mount, which ain't cheap.   It would be like 100g?

yeah it's literally gonna be all shamans, warriors, rogues, mages, paladins, druids, hunters, warlock, and priests

another post compaining about layering, i liked the lamp part it was nice but a feew weeks of layering are not so important, by the time it could have a real impact it will already be gonne and you will start complaining about something else dont worry
---
What are you talking about, PST obviously means Pacific Standard Time.
---
What makes you think it's enhanced or broken? 
---
You understand that lag compensation mechanics from 2005 will have a very different impact on the game play in 2019 right? Even if spellbatching isn't on steroids, it will result in a different experience than what we had back then. What makes you think this isn't exactly the same spell batching as was used back then? The effects are just much more impactful and noticeable on a stable internet without constant packet loss.
---
The #nochanges notion is a good thought, but to simulate a 2005 experience you have to adapt for new technology. That means having to either replace, remove or adjust technologies based on 15 year old connection issues that are no longer relevant or to a much lesser degree.
---
Since we are going through acronyms, does WTB ‚Äúwilling to buy‚Äù or does it mean ‚Äúwanting to buy‚Äù 
---
(Same for WTS)
---
Just curious what YOU all say in your head when you read those three letters.
---
At it's high point, WotlK was a mixture of die hard fans that grew the game and stuck around and temporarily attracted players that either wanted to see the arthas story play out or were attracted by the increased accessibility.
---
Many of the latter people left after WotlK (directly and over the course of the years), because they were never invested in the game as the hardcore crowd.
---
Yet Blizzard kept catering to them and ultimately even alienated the former.
---
True? Who knows. But equally ass possible as "the high sub numbers shows that the game was best then"
---
I dont like camping on unfortunate guy as the one person cant get away. But saying: "today we let northern stv run in blood" is fair game in my book.

the opposing faction can either fight back or they can switch zones.

A zone like Shimmering Flats is so immense that you can easily pack up shop and leave without dying more than once or twice by bad luck.
---
No one says this.

I think this is a really good idea
---
You could carry the flag.  lol

If you are an OT then your spec would matter a lot less.

1. yes, they are locked to their specific faction.

2. Dps wise? pvp? healing? farming? hard to answer that otherwise

If you met people in Paris who didn't speak French they were likely tourists or newly immigrated expats. Even though the borders are open, it's very much separate countries with separate languages and cultures. A lot of Europeans live in communities where only one language is spoken and you do fine just speaking one language.
---
I've seen the movie, and I don't appreciate this
---
Wut.
---
No they just didn‚Äôt care. It would take a lot of time and manpower to get spell batching done correctly on a modern system and this is beyond the small Blizzard team they are using to make Classic WoW. Instead they opting for a much simpler feel of spell batching rather than actually how spell batching worked e.g. they are bodging it together with modern architecture. 
---
They‚Äôre way past the point that any mechanical changes can happen before the release date in less than two months. Right now they are just fixing bugs and quest issues the beta tester are flagging up.
---
Would be nice if you'd post how he achieved that.
---
TY
---
No...it's based on BFA.
---
That was the whole point of changing to the new system.
---
It's all running on 8.2, BFA AND Classic. Classic is a just a side-fork that only gets critical security updates and behind the scenes optimization. But will be updated server-side every time the retail patch gets a server-side update.
---
Since they're functionally running on the same server architexture now. And Blizzard is NOT maintaining multiple MMOs. they are maintaining one MMO, that just has two flavors available but behind the scenes is running on the same systems.
---
What is the quest log limit in the classic beta: Is it 20 like it used to be or due to the client is it different?
---
Doesn‚Äôt OSRS have half the player count of substantially more player friendly games, like retail WoW? Sure, it has more players than RS3, but that‚Äôs because runescape is only fun for a very tiny set of people and trying to split the difference between them and everyone else means you make something no one likes.

so true, i hope the "layer cryier" dies down soon and people comes back to talking about the "cool things" they remember/want to try in classic

Happy cake day

I don't like the retcon they did with illidan because it truly undermines tbc imo, and I think you can exaggerate anything to sound bad
---
yeah I mean crafting while leveling is a mistake you make the first time you play wow
---
Wow, I just realized that I forgot about the stress test cuz on Wednesday my guild killed mythic Jaina and I rode that high until like friday, I‚Äôm actually really sad now.
---
Warriors, rogues, mages, warlocks are best dps.
---
Warriors are best tanks.
---
Paladin, priest, shaman are best healers.
---
Druids can heal, hunters are there to tranq and kite stuff while trying to stay relevant on the dps meters.
---
Druid tank and dps, ret pally, oomkin, and enh shaman are meme specs for the most part.
---
Tauren Shaman. I plan to level resto.
---
As someone to actually leveled as boomkin cause I was retarded, I think you just triggered my PTSD.
---
/dance.
---
&gt; it doesnt mean that they apply all the time to every class in every scenario
---
&gt; Disagree on the **raid** spots.
---
I agree on other stuff, like loot competition. Druids/ hunter have it definitly easier than warriors or mages for example. 
---
&gt;Even with your example i wouldnt consider it an upside
---
You said less raid spots are a downside to you, but more raidspots are not an upside? 
---
&gt;i played warrior i would certainly like it if they were less popular
---
Everyone would love to be the only one of their class
---
Oh man, TBC. I would actually cry from joy.
---
I am upvoting this because people need to understand what exactly happened yesterday, and not live under the wrong impression that if Beta is dead , so will Classic.
---
1.Beta is CLOSED, LIMITED, and capped at lvl 40. Pretty much everyone runs out of things to do.
---
2.Most Beta players are from BfA, and 8.2 was just announced, and hits in 2 days. Ofc most beta players (being BfA players) will play BfA an prep for 8.2.
---
3.Classic had a 3 day stress test, than ended the say before yesterday. All beta players played the stress test for 3 days in row. ofc some of them didn't bothered to log into Beta server the day after a 3 days Classic marathon.
---
4.Blizzard, in order to boost 8.2, did not increased the beta lvl cap. We are 5 weeks into Beta Classic. First 2 weeks were lvl 1-30, the next 2 weeks were lvl 30-40. Normally, Blizzard should have increased the lvl cap to 50 last Tuesday. But because of 8.2, they did not.
---
Considering all of the above, there is no wonder that Classic beta is dead : there is no new content, most players are BfA players and 8.2 hits in 2 days, Blizzard did not raised the Beta lvl cap and the 3 days stress test just ended on Friday.
---
HENCE, Classic will not be the same, because most players will NOT be BfA players, there won't be stress tests, there won't be lack of content, and Classic players won't give a flying fuck on 8.3 or 9.0.
---
Dis you read the sentence I referenced? Would please you quote it if you did?
---
It‚Äôs vanilla. Every spec has a strong point and it‚Äôs not always raiding. There are pros and cons.
---
This posts legit need to be banned, there are literally more than a 100 posts about this same thing.
---
awww yissh this is the kind of information I am looking for. My memory is completely dumped from this era. I remember enhancement shaman being garbage. I need to find forum posts about this from that time period.
---
Nevermind, I misread that as the sentence I quoted. My bad
---
Both TBC and Classic+ are going to be released, so everyone will stay subed.
---
No way it's going to be only TBC or only Classic+.
---
It's going to be BOTH.
---
There were no transfers back then smartass and I did end up having to change servers that's why I'm so pissed when people like you dismiss this as just a minor problem or an easy solution. 
---
No you wouldn't have fun playing with people you couldn't communicate with, you wouldn't even get invited to groups because after you'd join the group they said the magic word "magyar?" and kick you if you said English.
---
&gt;Ninja loot them back
---
Yes it's pretty obvious you would do that but I wouldn't, I'm not such an ass to resort to this, not like it would help you in the slightest if you WOULD actually want to continue playing on that server.
---
I honestly believe you're just a troll because noone is that dim to not understand this.
---
roflmao
---
Because that‚Äôs what happens. The statement ‚Äúyou think you do but you don‚Äôt‚Äù isn‚Äôt exactly wrong. 
---
There‚Äôs classic heads like myself that will be there for years but a good deal of people are fed by the hype and fooled into thinking they‚Äôll actually get to 60.
---
New-WoW players will definitely try it but honestly I have no idea how they'll take it. When Blizz tried to rebalance Cataclysm's dungeons to old WoW type of balancing the new-WoW wrath babies HATED IT and Blizzard gave in to their demands ever since. Maybe when they go into Classic with vanilla expectations they'll be more open minded about it, but it's anyone's guess so Blizzard is preparing for the worst.
---
Sucks for oce players cause all their pservers are closed in anticipation of classic, so I hope it ends up being great.
---
Why do we need threads like this...? Are we so insecure in our love for Classic that we need constant reminders that we are right and "they" are wrong?
---
Ya know, people‚Äôs opinions can change in the 3 years since those comments were made, those statements were also likely made before anyone on the team even worked on trying to create classic, and over a year and a half before it was announced at blizzcon 2017.
---
Getting estimates on MMO populations is a difficult task but OSRS was quite large last I checked, and it's one of the games on par with a few others where I bump into IRL people playing it. It's rather low key but it has a presence, and it's a game I basically try to ignore lol
---
&gt;What makes you think it's enhanced or broken?
---
Well to start with, the very video link you posted. 
---
I understand what you are saying though. You are saying that the mechanics, if implemented like they were in 2005, will result in what we see in OP's video. I don't believe that this is the case here at all. Blizzard themselves have stated that the spell batching they are implementing is a simulation of the spell batching we saw in 2005. Just comparing the two videos in this thread shows they have their simulation wrong.
---
Do you want Classic to be as close as retail was back in vanilla ? Me too. And French / German realms were a thing back then.
---
&gt; Give us B.C for a time, hit us with Wrath, and then I'm going to quit in CATA like I did before. 
---
And this is the reason why Classic+ is 100% a done deal. Blizzard will not want people like you (who are many) to play for 5 years and quit. They will want US, all of US, to play as long as possible.
---
Hence...Classic+. But TBC and Wrath will also exist, to keep every single player subed.
---
You got bored of TBC, no problem, jump into Classic+ . You don't like Classic+ because reasons? No problem play some Wrath. Or TBC. Or BfA.
---
I see a Classic+ (the long term option for Classic), I see TBC (for many players that want to relieve it) and I see Wrath, for the same reasons as TBC.
---
Remindme!64 days
---
Lots of Retail-Scrubs will try it for the first time and after they died 100 times before Level15 they will quit. 
---
I'm sure only like 10-20% of all players who start Day1 will make it to Level60.
---
You could just reply with an answer, replies like this need to be banned
---
Adding on to this:
---
Druid tanking is more than viable in 5mans. 
---
On the topic of mediocre dps  (be it hunter, ret, Enh, etc). It depends on the mindset and composition of your raid.
---
These specs usually provide buffs to the group.
---
 So you would have to compare a rogues dps to that of an enh shaman PLUS the increase he gives to his group - which does not show up in his dps meter.
---
They still lack behind the top dps classes, but it is not like taking ~2 or more hunters or feral dps than the "optimal" comp recommends will hinder your raid in a major way
---
Retail bad, classic good. Upvotes to the left.
---
most of the heroic raids took longer iirc, especially ICC with OP lichking
---
First green. First blue. First world pvp kill. Lvl 10/20/30 skills?
---
I dont see much synergy for these two classes tbh. Hunter can afk farm while mage has to drink after every 2-3 mobs. The part might be that you wont compete for gear. If that's what you want to play, just go for it. Leveling can be done solo anyway, so any buddy makes it easier. Hunter and mage are just not really beneficial to each other.
---
lol you think you'll have the gold to get it right at 40....
---
&gt;You said less raid spots are a downside to you, but more raidspots are not an upside? 
---
No im just saying the more open raidspots there are the better for you, not how many there are total. I just mean that it doest matter if there are 1k raidspots for warriors on my server if there are 2k warriors and all the spots are filled. On the other hand there might only be 200 spots for druid but only 180 total druids on the server. Warrior have more raidspots but druid would have more open raidspots and therefore more choice. So in this case would it be better if there were only 900 warriors on the server instead of 2k? I would say so. Of course all those numbers were pulled straight out of my ass and serve just as an example
---

---
This is way worse than I though it would be. Are they going to be able to fix this?
---
shitty design like this will always be exploitable in some way.
---
more servers, dynamic spawns, no layering is the way to go
---
won't happen though - it's blizzard
---
This is what is insane to me. By creating layering exploits, the economy could be destroyed for months following the initial leveling experience. Yeah it'll suck for a few days if everyone is battling over mobs.
---
But having gold farmers with 10 layers worth of black lotuses and arcane crystals is far worse.
---
no idea why my previous comment gets downvoted, thats just my experience. i played in vanilla and several private servers, and i always had mount at 40. just sell everything to vendors and most important sell all low lvl greens via AH. also buy only the skills you need. go with lw and herb. for lvling. low lvl leather can be vendored.
---
Imagine going through the trouble or writing all of this out, without even once taking a second to stop and think about it.
---
i always thought it was "wish"

This made my day, I used to spend lots of time on ytmnd back in the day. Thanks for reminding me about it. You both get silver! :)
---
It's fucked, classic will be a far less attractive than pservers if they don't show any progress soon.
---
yes.
---
Druid healers kind of suck until later tiers, so you only want at most 3.  
---
Hunters suck at later tiers, so you only want like 3 for tranq shot.

Beyond that it doesn't matter.

When do rouge feel les clunky? I lvled one and they feel really strange pre lvl 10.

I've learnt english with wow, its now time to learn French I guess.

It means *want to* if you were merely *willing to* you wouldn't be advertising it.
---
;)
---
Oh, I don't think so. I was raiding quite a lot in the days and I am sure I will raid again. 1 - 2 days a week is enough for at least T1 and T2 + ZG when you have experience and matching gear. 
---
As content is phased I am sure it can work out depending on my time. And if not that's ok, too. I hate welfare epics. TBC had none btw. You had to do things for them. And in Vanilla there were Titanic leggings etc. They are catch up. But only a few, not your whole stuff. And in phase 5, not the next one (this is like BWL stuff so phase 2?). 
---
PvP will be fun, too. Dungeons, ZG... I will be ok. Farming rep if I decide to go enchanting. Still unsure. But whatever it is: I will have fun for at least 1 year, most likely more. That's more than legion or WoD brought me by alot. Even a twink my be worth it.

Enable classic water you heathen!
---
You are right but that also means you just broke the first and second rule of Fight Club.
---
Fuck the naysayers. After all shit the classic community had to take over the years it's justified to give the retards a jab once or twice.
---
In context I'm obviously talking about current wow
---
Its no secret the gaming industry is dirtier then it was 10 years ago. With companies only chasing huge profits instead of making good games. Oh and microtransactions, lets not even talk about that.
---
I wish you the best of luck! Being original is hard as it takes time to develop something, but if done well, no doubt you'll succeed!
---
That would be correct, but you also just broke the first and second rule of Fight Club.
---
I think you have no idea what you're talking about. System architecture does indeed play a role in how software is executed, but spell batching is purely a software change. They had spell batching in 2005 because the hardware couldn't handle a higher tick rate. Now it can which is why it was removed in MOP. Now they're keeping a general high tick rate and emulating "spell batching" by increasing the amount of ticks required for spell effects to occur. It shouldn't degrade its original functionality because hardware is now better, that doesn't make any sense. What we're seeing is a manifestation of a bug, and that's it. It'll take a developer or two maybe a day or three to identify the root cause of the issue and implement a fix. Snag fixing is definitely high risk because the problem might be hard to find, but that doesn't mean it's impossible or incredibly arduous. Don't be so pessimistic.
---
Thanks to the way back machine I can dive into the 2006 forums and read complaints about the classes. Shaman had a dedicated list of problems .

it has everything to do with phasing... that's how layers work
---
Structured PvP in vanilla is one BIG grind. You can get alot of gear from it, titles etc. You get a currency for winning BG's (battleground) which you can turn in at a quartermaster. But iirc you need a crazy lot of rep aswell. Warsong gulch is the first available BG available from lvl 10. BG's queue you up with people that are close to your lvl however, if u queue at lvl 10 you will have no chance against someone who is lvl 19. ( you get queue'd with people from lvl 20-29, 30-39 etc )
---
But its fun in its own right i guess. I'd rather spend my time lvling up to 60 before diving into BG's.
---
And make it double

&gt; I may make a Rogue first thing and spend an hour Pick Pocketing at launch, just to get a Gold under my belt and maybe buy my main a green weapon for level 5+.

I think that‚Äôs quite insulting to a lot of indie developers. The difference is that back in the day there were only indie developers, now we have these big companies producing AAA games that cost millions to make.
---
The issue is people expecting AAA quality games from indie developers with a limited budget. 
---
Yeah, we have had some terrible examples of corporate greed but we also have other amazing games (Dota 2, CSGO, Path of Exile) that show how things can be done.

I‚Äôve been a blizzard customer since the beginning. I‚Äôve bought ever game they have. I was subbed to wow for 12 years. I‚Äôve never once gotten into any beta ever from blizzard and I sign up for every beta always. It‚Äôs like they hate me.
---
Imagine actually...
---
No. No I won't.
---
This is basically how it worked. It was extremely rng to get a blizzard tick on someone not slowed and pretty much impossible on something like a sprinting rogue.
---
If you don't think they're amazing games then that's fine, but then I think you're just trying to get back to a feeling you felt when you were younger that is long lost now.

Same goes for movies by the way.
---
I guess its fine. 100% would be too powerful. Mage is strong enough.

I think we can both agree that we broke the first and second rule of Fight Club, and we should consider putting an end to it.
---
Not really. You'll get more tools as you level up, which makes the time between point builders more fun, but you'll always be energy starved.

So if you want to always have a hard hitting button to press, rogue isn't really the class for you.

As for enchancement it is quite a meme spec and doesn't really bring a lot to the raid. Your best bet is to heal in raids and just pick up enhancement gear that people don't want and like weapons from BWL that people are looking to get.

While I agree it was a milestone of the gaming industry, I also think that games have to evolve. It's a good think we moved on, I'm sure that now it's possible to recreate the classic experience in a more modern way and trying not to lose the magic feelings of vanilla in future patches.
---
&gt; If my server had Spanish, Vietnamese, Punjabi and Chinese speakers, I wouldn‚Äôt think anything of it; It‚Äôs normal.
---
The major isssue isn't the language they're speaking, it's them requiring you to speak their language.
---
Imagine when you had arbitrarily selected yourself and coordinated that choice with a bunch of friends.
---
Then after a couple weeks start noticing there's a log of Indians on the server, you think no big deal, doesn't matter, a few more weeks go by and you stop being able to join groups because you don't speak Punjabi, people will literally kick you from their groups simply based on that.
---
This was the experience for many Europeans back in the day I was routinely kicked from groups because I didn't speak Italian to the point where I basically stopped pugging and only stuck with my guild.
---
This. 
---
I love TBC and Wrath but I don't want to be stuck in an endless loop of F R E S H server memes like in the pserver community. Classic+ is the future.
---
Judge light? Missing out on a ton of healing if you do not judge light in raids.
---
They are using the old warsong map and so we can all have fun seeing terrain jump exploiters in every game

WoW Vanilla, Final Fantasy VII, Starcraft, Half Life I+II, Counterstrike 1.6, Unreal Tournament I-2k3, Battlefield 1942, Quake I-III, Call of Duty, Diablo I+II, Age of Empires I+II, KotOR, Max Payne, Pokemon,Street Fighter, Sim City, GTA, Civilization I-V, Warcraft I-III, Tekken, Super Mario, Mario Kart, Zelda, Tony Hawks Pro Skater, Metal Gear Solid, Halo, Monkey Island, Need For Speed, Resident Evil, Deus Ex, Silent Hill...
---
Sure everything looks ten times better today graphics wise, but every game that is still around today from those franchises has lost its soul and is in many instances a cash grab.
---
Please say male :3
---
I've been playing private servers (Classic, TBC, Wotlk) for the last 5 years. In my opinion no MMO comes close to WoW back then.
---
The games you are talking about might be good games if you're into that. I just play MMOs.
---
Following my goal for classic. No tryharding. Just having fun while my GF gets her first MMORPG experience. Also take the time again to do what I want without feeling the need to get maxlevel asap
---
Looking at your consistently toxic replies throughout r/wowclassic 
---
You should probably sort yourself out. No, a private server cannot be related to the retail experience. Don't be god damn ridiculous, you silly shortsighted toxic child. Think of it logically and maybe try use maths. Hurr.. Durr. Stop going and arguing with random people pretending to be some kind of WoW Jesus. The hell is wrong with you?
---
It's nothing special. You're not helping the mage aoe farm, so you're holding them back in some sense, because they could duo with anybody else and loose nothing besides utility, which every class brings anyways.
---
&gt; Rolling invites would have been a good idea imo
---
Hindsight is 20/20. They could probably find room for folks now. Then again, they may have the data they need at this point.
---
With nightfall, totem twisting improved goa and improved wf totem, then an enhancement shaman can earn his spot in the raid.  His personal dps will be bad, but once you add in all the additional dps he is contributing via buffs/debuff he would be middle of the pack.
---
You are right, because the last thing we need is breaking the first and second rule of fight club.
---
Are guns / crossbows any different sounding?
---
What you‚Äôre forgetting about is the mafias or more accurate word would be ‚Äòcartels‚Äô who focus on cornering the market by abusing layers to control resources spawns across multiple layers which gives them the ability to be price makers not price trees which directly interferes with a free and open economy
---
The other thing also is the markets are going to suck because everyone is starting at once, is flat broke, and is selling everything at firesale prices to put a few copper in their pockets.  Makes getting that 40 mount even tougher early on.
---
What he meant with queing was prolly the amount of pugs forming and stomping most content, an occurance that wasnt normal untill wrath, pugs happened during vanilla and tbc but wasnt nearly as succesful as during wotlk when normal pugs cleared content with same ease as guilds did it.
---
&gt; So you can‚Äôt/refuse to communicate and interact with people who don‚Äôt speak your language?
---
No, we can't interact with people who refuse to speak languages we understand, are you unable to tell the difference between the two?
---
&gt; How... depressing. Honestly. Think about that.
---
Yea, it's really depressing to think about people putting up strawmen
---
Agreed about artifact, I mean Azerite armor. I haven't even played enough BfA to have more than one piece of Azerite armor, I think. If I have more, I'm just unaware. I really don't care about the expansion. It's like they decided to just expand on everything I hated about the last three expansions.
---
I really just want play Classic. I'll always try the new expansions, but damn.
---
When people are trying to have a serious discussion I like to see their facial expressions, it's normal human behaviour.
---
It is, if it's the overwhelming majority.
---
If someone from Slovenia logs in a realm then they are forced to used English to get by.
---
But if you have 30% German, 30% French and 30% English you'll have plenty people using their mother tongue instead, even if they know how to speak English.
---
\#NoChAnGeS
---
I swear it's the only thing these people can say.
---
People want to save the experience for launch.
---
You are very ignorant. Language-wise, European countries are much more autonomous than US states and post-colonial countries. English might be the lingua franka currently, but except for the fact that a lot of people can speak it on a day to day basis, you can't do shit in France without French, in Germany without German, in Russia without Russian, etc. This extends to the fact that many do not speak it, precisely because it is not necessary. The reverse is true - migrants must know the native language if they want to live and work in the country. 
---
So why should a country of 60 million, with their own language, where +- 1/4 speaks English and, of course, we're talking about a B1-B2 level,not native, have to be spread around international servers, where they'll have to blindly hope to fall upon a countryman so they can play together? Just make a French server and let the damn people play together.
---
I can understand when it comes to Scandinavian states, and other low-pop countries like the Baltics and the Balkans, but you have 60 million French, 60 million Italians, 40 million Spanish 80+10 million Germans and Austrians. You really think these countries won't fill a few servers each?
---
What can be swapped during fighting?
---
I know weapon and shield slot can be changed. Anything else? Trinket or something?
---
GRATZ
---
&gt; which in turn should have made it it EASIER to find your friends; not harder.
---
You realize that language division within the EU is also largely a geographical division right?
---
You said you were from the bay area right? How many real life friends do you make on a "NA" server vs how many do you think you'd meet on a "Cali" server?
---
I loved getting those novel sized manuals back in the day with my game.  Now all you get is a advertisement leaflet and maybe a 2 page manual in 9 languages explaining how to remove the cd and warnings
---
I'm starting to believe 300 realms at launch isn't the *worst* idea. Layering IS the worst system. Node/NPC abuse will break the future of the game.
---
Makes sense, I guess your right.
---
The hit sound was not there in vanilla.
---
Try taking 10 seconds to watch the examples in the OP next time.
---
I, personally, want to play Classic+ more than TBC. However, I would lie if I'd say that I don't want to play TBC. I, 100% WANT to play TBC, for as long as TBC exists...but I don't want to be limited to 2 years of game play.
---
I want Classic+ because it is a long term option. I am not rejecting TBC, in favor of Classic+. I am rejecting TBC only, and only IF it's the only option after Classic.
---
Blizzard obviously knows that TBC is a solid option, but they also know it's a short term solution...and Blizzard ALWAYS plans long term.
---
This is why I see BOTH Classic+ and TBC after Classic. A solid short term solution that will keep a good numbers of subs, and a long term solution that will keep AND add more subs.
---
Missed opportunity to flip the image upside down.
---
of course it's dead, not enough people were invited and being so close to 8.2...in just a few days people are leveling up their alts and getting set for new live content duhhh
---
What do you mean when the community decides it? The community wants this to avoid the pitfalls already mentioned.
---
The French and German players will dictate a language server and flock in great numbers. None of us english only speakers can do anything about it.
---
You speak three languages? Good for you... I speak one. And alot of multilingual people still prefer a main language.
---
Again it's not about lack of respect, it's about being able to enjoy a social game without 75% of the text being utter gobelty-gook.
---
Tauren druid... Can't decide male or female
---
Changing outland into a mishmash of swamps and forests, retconning draenei into eiffel65 music video extras, making a central city where everyone gets along under the protection of some floating glyph, and so much more!
---
A lot of those games have recent versions that are just as good if not better.  
---
* CS 1.6 =&gt; CS:GO is huge right now and super fun to play. 
---
* Max Payne =&gt; Did you not like Max Payne 3?
---
* Pokemon is released super frequently still.
---
* GTA =&gt; I enjoyed GTAV. 
---
* Civilization =&gt; CIV VI is quite good imo, but these games always get hate on the next installment.
---
* Super Mario =&gt; Odyssey was highly praised, and there's the new one with level editor coming out. 
---
* Mario Kart got a release on the Switch.
---
* Zelda: BoTW is also highly praised, really fun game and people are so hyped for the sequel. 
---
* Resident Evil: Surely a lot of people liked the last Resident Evil?  
---
* They're remaking FFVII in a completely new game. 
---
* There are several new Star Wars games coming, while Battlefront 2 had its issues with the microtransactions, the level design itself was absolutely amazing.
---
Besides these, there are other games that are being remade by indie developers. For Diablo I and II you have Path of Exile, for Simcity you have Cities Skylines.  
---
How the fuck can you say that every game that is still around has lost its soul? I think maybe you're just less into games now than you were back then or seem to remember the games from then differently than they were.
---
I got bfa... didn't play it much but I wasn't very excited for it. I'm actually pumped for classic. Last night I saw that I could install the classic client and thought I had the beta my wife jumped over me to get to her computer and spilled her drink to check hers lol. Only to realize it was just the client
---
It's not like plenty of people, the classic community included, don't shit all over retail players at every opportunity. Given the amount of shit flung in their direction over the years I think they're well within their rights to toss a bit back. 
---
Frankly I just want us all to settle down and play the version of the game we like. We don't need to fight when we both benefit from WoW overall doing well.
---
Tauren druid and I would like to go leatherworking/skinning. Played one on the recent stress test and loved it. I want to heal end game.
---
Especially with the layers.
---
You could end up on a realm where you're language is spoken by a large group of people only to discover that over time and after the layering disappears you were wrong. It's the French who hold the majority of the playerbase. 
---
Like you said, it's just stupid to not inform the players officially what language the realm is supposed to be.
---
Still trying to understand why it wasn't easier to make the game from 15 years ago compatible with bnet. Guess i won't be playing hunter since they won't debug most of these before the release since you know.. blizzard.
---
This is so true. My wife took the baby on Friday for a small 1 night trip with her mom, I was so bummed the stress test ended at 5pm here. Would have been a perfect Friday night plan. I ended up downloading a TBC server ( I want classic to feel as fresh as possible come 8-26). Private servers just don't feel great knowing they aren't the REAL thing.
---
He was talking about the golden age of games and movies, so why did you even ask me which games if you were going to solely focus on MMOs?
---
There's a hitmarker sound when the arrow hits the target, that was added in wod or legion iirc.
---
I would lose my collective mind if enh shaman became a viable class for raiding.
---
&gt; You EU people are telling me you haven‚Äôt? You‚Äôre either liars or don‚Äôt go outside.
---
Or maybe, just maybe EU is very different from the US?
---
Unless you go to the ghettos filled with refugees who refuse to integrate into society, we don't have this kind of thing here at all, because unlike the US, we never had mass immigration from certain countries on a scale that would allow them to build their own communities without speaking the language.
---
I'v been in 3 betas (legion,bfa and overwatch) and can tell you that for normal gamer who doesnt do it for a living doing the same stuff twice in beta and then in live is really not that amazing. For overwatch it wasnt that bad cuz its fps, but for wow it made the content pretty dull in live for doing it already in beta.
---
Glad the majority uses google for trivial life questions instead of going to reddit.
---
When you hit 40 and have the üí∞
---
When I go into wow classic it says no servers are up? How do I access the stress test servers?
---
Or helm haha
---
They don't care about small things like wall climbing, bow sounds, backtracking/strafing animation etc etc... I just wish I could get to GM island, Old Ironforge, on top of Orgrimmar or into Caverns of Time... But it 99% won't be possible now :/
---
Praising state of classic is not useful either bruh... We are all just sharing our pointless opinions... Do you think blizzard actually reads this and cares or something? We will get their vision of classic no matter what...
---
If they "obviously knew shit was wrong" they wouldn't ask people to test for shit like this.
---
Iconic moment
---
It ist 20 in the Beta.
---
Why wouldn't they be?
---
* Highly Sought after
---
* One of the easiest classes to gear up.
---
* Great solo pvp potential as ele/resto
---
* Great group pvp potential
---
* quick leveling thanks to instant spells, enhancement, totems and ghost wolf
---
Literally the only drawback is that they can't dps in a raid setting.
---
ANAL [Insect Swarm]
---
Yes, but people on this subreddit frequently predict that by Phase 2 WoW Classic's population will be lower than the amount of players currently playing on private servers,
---
I've pointed out the problem with the math several times but it just ends up getting downvoted every time.
---
Conclusion: Most people on this subreddit are really dumb and will say anything to defend layering regardless of how illogical it is.
---
You'd have a couple of every class in a raid either way. With a ret or enh the fact is they could be bringing more to the raid as a healer.
---
It pretty much is, but only 1 per raid.   However, all you do is auto-atk and drop those two totems over and over.
---
It might not be a couple of weeks, it could be a couple of months too. 
---
But people don't play the same game forever, that's just how it is.
---
Dead game at launch.
---
You don‚Äôt. Those servers are down right now. Beta and Stress Test are not the same thing.
---
Clean your screen grub
---
Thanks. That helps a lot. Never really thought about what the Nvidia stuff could further enhance after the game settings are maxed out. I'm just worried  Blizz somehow could draw the conclusion that some particular shade settings might make enemies become more visible or something like that.
---
Agreed, I'd even take dynamic respawns rather than this shitty system. If layering ruins leveling then every "tourist" will quit.
---
Because they are the only games worth playing?

No it won‚Äôt.

http://www.wowclassicbis.com/ should give an idea.
---
Another hour, another retail boogeyman post
---
wtf dude?
---
What you are saying is: back in the day having a bad internet connection was better for playing WoW than having a good one. Which is wrong. Just because the hardware supports higher performing software doesn't mean lower performing software won't work as intended anymore.
---
Old vanilla WoW spell batching was designed around that the server loop to calculate spells won't drain as much server performance. This was 200ms or 0.2s in vanilla WoW. It got changed to 20ms or 0.02s at some point. I don't know when the changes were made but my guess is around Legion. It was raised to a higher priority loop, my guess would be to the same loop as movement.
---
So spell batching nowadays is still possible, just the window today is 10 times smaller to do so, which makes it way harder.
---
After all the years the hardware improved and the underlying software improved. The one thing that didn't "improve" was the Vanilla WoW game state. This is the state of the game that the #nochanges crowd wants.
---
I'm sad I didn't make it into the beta, otherwise I'd test myself.
---
In the beginning of beta start I was not in the #nochanges department, and was actually quite happy to get the new engine &amp; server software, **but** the more videos and streams I see the more I think I'll be frustrated about #thechanges.
---
# #NOCHANGES TO THE SERVER BEHAVIOR
---
# #NOPLACE FOR MOUSEOVER CASTS
---
I think it would be much better if layers were used to simplify server merges over time, by locking them untill it's time to merge.
---
The server list could look like this at launch:
---
* Silvermoon 1
---
* Silvermoon 2
---
* Silvermoon 3
---
* Silvermoon 4
---
* Bloodhoof 1
---
* Bloodhoof 2 etc..
---
After then initial release dies down, merge 1 and 2, and 3 and 4. Then, maybe by phase 1, merge them all.
---
It's kindoff ugly, it would still be relatively shit show at launch, there could be queues, but it would solve some headaches. Alternatively add sharding only in the 1-5 areas.
---
The layers share the same data, so it's still technically one server.
---
But idk.
---
Pet AI is broken, if you play retail (BFA) it‚Äôs also broken as a comparison. 
---
Here is a laundry list of Huntard bugs

---
... Did you play vanilla? You didn't get drawn in because it was ONE WORLD? I think you're reading into the "disappearing" too much, yes the points you mention happened but those were just nuances that obviously had to happen. Layering is going to have mid combat shifts in the world where there's 1+ worlds stacked on top of each other. People hate retail for sharding and layering in its current state feels like an equal culprit. It's literally no longer 1 world and that to me is a disaster.
---
Truth.
---
If she don't play, she don't stay.
---
You can Turn in 60 wool and Silk once for each faction in phase 1
---
Yes it is 20.
---
Agreed. This is one of those things like the mail system that they should change to the modern system. Their bullshit argument about higher skillcap in PvP is retarded.
---
&gt; they'll have 8.2 to focus on
---
It will be two months old at that point. Classic will release exactly around the time that people start getting bored of the new patch.
---
is there logs from private server fresh runs where theyre not overgearing the content? Feels like theres not much information regarding how much DPS classes do per tier for example? Or am i supposed to find spreadsheets per class and just insert gear and find theoritical DPS?
---
You can still use it in dungeons though. It is still really good.
---
Fun tip, you can charge critters as well
---
This is a good idea.
---
Monkeynews?
---
they are still bugged. really bugged.
---
Lol. The amount of retail fanboys infesting this sub is now at peak levels
---
As long as there's an exception for (a) words used whilst driving and (b) words used whilst engaged in PVP.
---
Glad to hear I wasn't an isolated incident
---
You need engineering on your main, but lets ignore that for a second.
---
Do you actually *enjoy* crafting and plan on using it to make money (as in, not just using it to turn the herbs you farm into whatever potions you can). If so, go ahead and level an alt to 35+ to do it.
---
If you don't enjoy it and just want an alchemist because you think alchemy and herbalism should go in a pair, then don't do it, it's so much time for very little benefit, just sell your herbs and buy your potions, yes it's a tiny bit more expensive but the opportunity cost in the time spent is huge.
---
Alternatively you could go with a middle ground, find yourself an alchemy friend and have him craft your potions for you and tip him a few gold or some of your leftover herbs you don't need yourself.
---
Since we're already getting some juicy changes, why not just allow shared mob tagging for at least quest objectives and quest items
---
By just rambling about a weak supply;demand incoherent paragraph nonetheless... Even though Frost, arguably the most influencial world economy / gold farmer has submitted a video echoing his concerns.
---
Some green items wont sell on the AH so you should have a level 5 enchanter to DE.
---
The gray cloth shoulders that you're super proud to have?
---
Ohh how do I play those? I don't see an option for them on my launcher.
---
Correct and I updated my post to say that, I forgot to mention it removes you from stealth that‚Äôs the key aspect.
---
You most likely don‚Äôt have beta access, so you can‚Äôt.
---
Hey man! My pleasure! 
---
What you are experiencing is actually a server-sided issue and nothing I can help you with. My conclusion is that whenever more than 100 viewers are checking out the sheet the ones who come in later are the ones experiencing issues. And the issues are never the same. 
---
However, I'm working on a solution, which I hopefully can get up and running soon.
---
Godverdomme
---
In order to have access to a lot of bop recipes your alchemist needs to be 60. However leveling an alt to 35 in order to sell arcanite transmutes every time it's not on cooldown is a thing. You do have to factor in the time it takes to get to 35 as well as the cost of leveling up alchemy for transmute. In time you will make your money back and then it's free money every time transmute is not on cooldown. Still it's a question if it's worth the effort. 
---
 Have done it on a private server but probably not doing it on retail classic. Will just focus on one character and play the auction house for gold, buying and reselling stuff.
---
Unless you're a hunter who can fd to get out of combat, only weapon slots can be changed.
---
yeah, but back in vanilla sometimes i was the only shaman in some raids cause our server had not enough.
---
i guess knowing the game and class makes it more balanced
---
No, it cant, because the cap was an intentional decision in vanilla.
---
I never saw that one, will be looking it up while bored at work.
---
 I think there‚Äôs some reputation potions you can only get at 55+. 
---
Other than that, (specifically) Alchemy should suffice on tour alt. Every other crafting profession seems to have essential BoP/Raid recipes.
---
You dont have a full server's worth of population in each layer though; you have one fifth of a full server's population in each layer, that way when the layering ends you have one full server's worth of players on one realm.
---
I think that's a better option than to experience phasing between worlds, and the potential exploits that comes with it.
---
I always found Salman a bit over rated. I told him so once during a talk he gave on a book he was pushing. Surprisingly, he agreed and said if the Iranians didn‚Äôt call for his execution no one would have heard of him. You gotta like a guy like that.
---
Oh wait...you meant shaman....ya..dey gud...even that good
---
Assuming you know the rogue is going to do this, I'm guessing the best trinket time is after the second cheapshot? Then immediately rocket helm/dot?
---
As a first character, on a fresh server, with no economy or gold, everyone broke, do alchemy and herb, making your own potions, like armor, health regen, agility, or stamina or spirit/Mana Regen will help you extremely when leveling
---
Ranged weapon also?
---
This is the perfect way to show a bug in Classic, good job hopefully more people pay attention to your detail. It would have been far too easy to just have a wall of text and nothing to go off of.
---
Man perplexity is doing a really going a good job testing on the beta, pretty sure he brought up the leeway issue too.
---
Thats exactly how it works right now.   
---
The game scales to your level.
---
So does everyone have "World of Warcraft Classic" as an option on their launcher now?
---
Undead Rogue, engineering and skinning. 
---
I‚Äôve played pretty much only healers since 2005 (pally and druid) and for once in my life I just want to kill things and not worry about buffing people and keeping idiots alive üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I believe so. I could be wrong. I think they gave it to everyone so that you can download it ahead of time, and also the most recent stress test was available to anyone in NA servers with a sub.
---
why are you so hostile to people who want authenticity?
---
I'm amazed I even made it to level 40 tbh. I just didn't want to burn out and took my time. Then I hit 40 and.....well I don't wanna burn out by playing anything else....if they increased level cap I'd be down to play some more though.
---
Only weapon slots can be switched while in combat. Though hunters can feign death and change other gear aswell.
---
That sounds like the best solution to me. If I understand what you described correctly it would be 1 server still so stuff like people having to rename themselves when merges happen will not occur. I wouldn't care that much if I had to rename my characters but there are a lot of people who do.
---
The reason why I bring up the Nostalrius launch is to provide proof that you can launch a server with 6k+ players without dynamic spawns or layering and still have a successful launch.
---
It doesn't matter though because most people here would rather trust their own illogical guesswork or their 15 year old memories over verifiable experiences that occurred within recent history.
---
Problem there is that when the layering ends you suddenly have 3k people online and 12k waiting in the queue.
---
A better way would be to have the servers be 4k capacity, with only starting zones and sub-lvl20 characters layered.
---
 This bug was in beta for ages and multiple people wrote reports n shit. Its very doubtful blizz gonna fix stuff like this, because it most likely has something to do with scuffed batching that they half-assedly implemented and will stick with it.
---
 overall state of mage is really really bad. 
---
 Game overall looks like privates from 4-5 years ago.
---
Imagine making this long of a post for a mechanic that wont be in the game when it matters anyway.
---
I dreamed a lot that i have beta acess resently then i wake up too check just to suffer
---
No need to insult friend.
---
You said that multiboxing would allow you to join every layer fast and farm 5+ nodes per minute, but how would they exactly do that? That means that every node of all of the layers had a 1 minute respawn time. If anything you are explaining it incorrectly.
---
This is literally the World of Warcraft community as a whole to any other MMO that is not World of Warcraft.
---
World of Warcraft fanboys don't know how wrong they are.
---
I think playing the same classes but without the same type of gameplay elements will be the biggest turn-off for newer WoW players. Like if you're a mage and your main damage spell is frost bolt, and it doesn't really interact with anything. If you're used to building up resources and using them on different spells and using other spells to empower them and stuff like on retail, classic combat will feel extremely dull, especially at early levels. 
---
Questing, dungeons, and so on will not be a big problem. Adjusting to the new player power levels (much lower) might be rough, but not necessarily something people will dislike, a lot of modern WoW end game is very difficult, it's not something new. A lot of the very casual WoW players might not get far in classic, I'm not sure how many of those will even play it past level 5 or whatever, so it's kind of irrelevant. They are the ones that are entirely stuck in the easymode world of modern WoW. But any raider or whatever will not have a problem with difficult content.
---
If you think microtransactions, Lootboxes, fake DLCs, Early Acces, less Content but more expensive etc. is just a small issue thats fine.
---
People who grew up without that dont like to get ripped of for even less fun though.

Telling that you mentioned FFVII Remake, a game which is, well, a remake and they desperately tried to get the old spirit back and can use the old story which they know is amazing and didnt mention the 10 other FF titles that came in between which got worse and worse.
---
If you think CSGO and the spawn of Satan which was its dad CS Source is better than 1.6 or the new Civ 6 and diablo immortal is better than any title I mentioned I dont know what to say.
---
No matter if your race class or spec id not the most efficient just go for it if you like it. If you play what's best and not what is most fun you just end up exhausting yourself and stop playing.
---
May I ask how it will break the economy? People talk about this all the time without ever thinking about it.
---
There's no unlimited amount of layers. Layers are based on the population. If there's more than 3k players on a realm, there are more nodes than on a normal server because there are more layers. That actually makes sense! There's no difference in the amount of nodes/mobs available on 300 servers than on 300 layers. The only difference is that potentially, people heavily invested in farming can become more rich while farming than otherwise. This is definitely a potential abuse, but it will neither break the economy nor will it make people stone rich. The amount of materials, and the amount of gold, is the same as without layers. And while retail is a bad example for a lot of things, server hopping to farm has never caused any issues on it.
---
The biggest amount of money is made by playing the market, not farming materials.
---
Lastly: don't get me wrong, I don't think layering is absolutely required. I could life with server merges as proposed by /u/_veggies for example. Or they fix layering by only allowing jumping layers in rested areas. But if you argue against layering, maybe the arguments should have some substance behind them (or at least examples why there are in fact issues). I mean, half the videos from OP are confirmed bugs or people accepting invites mid combat...
---
I'm willing to bet you aren't a very succesful person.
---
Well, the interesting part of that poll was that it showed distribution of classes by level so you can see who makes it through to 60. Shaman, if I recall correctly, were well represented.
---
It‚Äôs just there for correct delete
---
Ooh this is my favorite.
---
From the experiences I‚Äôve had on pservers and forums...
---
Undead rogues are the stuff of nightmares who will come up to your ear, whisper ‚Äúacksjfjwjfkqjf‚Äù then crit the ambush and oneshot you if you‚Äôre a clothie, then laugh, and do it again like 5 times.
---
Orc warriors will ALWAYS try to kill you under 0 exceptions, it‚Äôs highly likely that they own alliance symbols that they shoved knives into. 
---
Female Night elf priests, female night elf hunters, and female night elf Druids are the most typical e-girl combos you will come across, and you‚Äôre usually more often correct than not to assume that it‚Äôs a girl. 
---
Male troll priests are likely stoners, and won‚Äôt shutup about it.
---
Female Tauren Druids are 100% female, but they‚Äôre not e girls, they‚Äôre like older and more mature and know how to press innervate and rebirth so they‚Äôll contribute more to a raid then ~~fucking drak will when he plays feral dps in classic~~
---
All other Tauren combinations are all chill as Fuck, they‚Äôre the dudes that will tank strat for you so he can get righteous orbs for his enchanting buddy, whoop ur ass in a duel then bandage you and add you as a friend, and have some fun stories to tell before raid time. 
---
Human male Paladins with the guile/stroheim hair are like orc warriors but for the alliance, will likely try to play ret in raid, and spam /dance everywhere. 
---
And finally, male night elf hunters are all huntards, they will roll need on EVERY piece of gear, their pet will aggro everything in the dungeon, they won‚Äôt turn growl off, and did he just get the fucking left binding.....
---
Yeah what I'm saying is that even though they implement it exactly as it was back then it will give a different result because of todays technology. There is no way of knowing if this is the result of a bad simulation or simply a result of a good simulation of a 2005 technology used in 2019.
---
Thinking an exact simulation of how it used to be back then would result in the same gameplay seems a bit ignorant. This is where the #nochanges notion shoots itself in the foot. Mechanics such as this and leeway will result in a very different gameplay unless **changed** to accompany better connections overall. 
---
So the question is really. Is the goal to simulate how it felt to play vanilla wow or is the goal to have an exact copy of vanilla wow and its mechanics of the time, regardless of how it feels to actually play it.
---
I would argue the prior to be more important and to be prioritized above the principle of #nochanges.
---
Because it's pretty clear to me that the way leeway and spellbatching is implemented right now, is more out of the #nochanges principle rather than actually adjusting it to feel right.
---
Yes, that is correct. Layer's are basically a parallell world that shares the same data with every other layer.
---
Of course. Dungeons are a menial necessity in the grand scheme of things, though.
---
Whether or not some of the mechanics and numbers are off has nothing to do with how a community plays and interacts with each other. If anything it's a much better emulation than the vanilla launch, since people know a lot more know and have drastically different mindsets.
---
But it‚Äôs also a hardware problem because if you know computers it is a fucking utter nightmare to run any sort old content (like Atria games for instance) on modern system. Have you ever tried plugging a 6¬Ω inch floppy disks drive into MacBook Pro? Sure spell batching isn‚Äôt that extreme but in no way are they going to get it right. 
---
P.S. Holding a pessimistic view in life is a great deal better than holding an optimistic view because you can then be happy with what you get rather than disappointed with what you receive. I don‚Äôt give a flying fuck about recreating the vanilla experience, it isn‚Äôt like come the 27 of August, vanilla will only accessible by slowly installing the client over four CD and then waiting a day and a half for the client to update? No I just want a chance to play some WoW again with a decent lively community.
---
Best way to convince some friends to play even though they never played WoW before?
---
Look at this lamp!
---
And now an incoherent rant about layering.
---
According to this sub Classic volunteers in a soup kitchen while Retail did 9/11.
---
This would be the best way to do it for the sake of the players. A very similar experience to Vanilla with the only different being the possibility of a few merges seems a better compromise than a permanently compromised experience. I'd suggest that, instead of pre-planned merges, Blizzard should wait for two Segments within that Cluster to need it. Reason is that there are likely going to be Segments that would do lose many active logins.
---
Most warrs did it back in the day. I certainly did, first char back then was a warr
---
[Blizzard publish them](https://www.kotaku.com.au/2015/05/why-world-of-warcraftlost-so-many-subscribers/)
---
OP, at the high point there were over 10 million people playing the game. So even the rarest combo is pretty well covered. How you can best distinguish yourself is working your class really well or being an awesome person to hang with.
---
Thanks for answering all my question! :)
---
That's not phasing, that's sharding
---
Born in 95 yet has no google search reflex.
---
 Check the VOD later when he sprints through blizzard and doesnt even get hit once.
---
And in every single one of those 1000 threads that's the first comment and the op replies the same way. Just use the search function, people aren't your personal google.
---
Sign of simpler times.
---
I don't even know how they dedicated so much time already in a character that will be deleted, seems like common behavior.
---
You should if you didn't do professions, bought upgrades on ah. And picked up every grey that dropped. I always got my mount on 40 without using ah. And keeping up with profs. However i had loads of times i just took the best selling quest reward. Instead of the one that was an upgrade.
---
When you get around level 20 and get your poisons, you will have more fun.
---
Do we know yet if reputation spills over from quests? I'm wondering if it's worth heading to the orc/troll starting area as an undead if I want a raptor mount at 60? Thanks
---
This is a weak minded post. You would be nothing but food in barrens chat
---
Why are you blaming teens ? They are the players who actually put time into the game and dont have much money for shortcut like boost, race change and name transfer. The vocal people who asked for a more casual-friendly/ fast food experience are grown adults who dont have the time to grind or making raid group. They are the one to blame. Not the kids, not the teens
---
Who here actually got a mount at 40?
---
I actually did lol it was super rare. I ended up picking herbalism and would farm some rare herb, so I got fairly rich. Since levelling was so long I often took Farming breaks for herbs to lvl and for money. I even got my epic mount a few weeks after hitting 60.
---
Maybe how it is now on BAD MAN RETAIL, except maybe a priority system of sorts to determine who gets the non quest specific loot, if there is any
---
Farming will still be about rewarding the players that contribute more, if it's a competition
---
At least it works well in my mind
---
Are they though? Dungeons are always relevant especially as someone who has killed KT i still was helping people farm dungeons.
---
Unfortunately, my knowledge of horde specific information is limited. My understanding is that they have fewer quests overall compared to Alliance, therefore getting another race‚Äôs mount will take longer and require more cloth turn-ins. And I‚Äôm not sure how or if being neutral would affect getting their quests, but I‚Äôm not aware of that being an issue.
---
There really doesn't seem like there's much hunters at all. I mean, if you compare it to Lock, Mage, rogue, it doesn't even seem close.
---
Just main a warlock, then those apocalypse dreams *are* the fun dreams.
---
I am actually your guild leader.
---
Why are you linking TBC footage
---
I don't go back to the boring grind of the 7 relevant dungeons once I have acquired epics. There are far more interesting things to do. Maybe now and then but it's not important.
---
Congrats for being a knob.
---
Depends on the situation. During leveling you can handle more mobs at once with dots. In dungeons you have to get a feeling, how long a mob will live. Pulls of 3+ mobs usually benefit from dots, but the tank has to be good.
---
I'll be going at it during launch.  My only experience of vanilla is some pserver stuff as I wasn't a PC gamer back then when it was live.  I'm more excited for Classic then anything during retail WoW even though I said I may play it again if they brought the Old Gods back I'm at the point where I think retail wouldn't let me sate myself.  I mean I haven't played retail since the beginning of BFA (checked out the start of each xpac, lackluster) but I only subbed up recently to play Classic beta.
---
cant be true my guild leader is a mysterious maverick capable of ruling over servers and inspiring others to reach for the stars - An Alexander the Great type. You strike me more as that midget from 300.
---
Watch the old blizzcon raid panel with Jeff Kaplan. It was in 2006 or 2007 i dont remember before Burning Crusade annoncement
---
Why is he wearing BFA shoulders?
---
It was like this in vanilla pet passive feign death and trap worked only like 99 percent of the time (no dot applied of course).
---
Was always frustrating when it didn't work. 
---
This is still a bug tho just one that I remember very clearly from back in the days
---
You can't really make much money via LW, so what's the point?
---
This is fucking hard to watch.. Even the spell named after their Company is not working, says alot about the future
---
Since its releasing the same time globally, for some people it is the 26th
---
? What is wrong with this advice. In what situation will getting a loan help build wealth other than a mortgage?
---
Comes out the 26th for NA
---
You could argue it will actually lower prices since people will hop layers to spawn multiples nodes at once, there might be more supply available than normal.  Those nodes might sit unpicked for hours or days potentially without layer hopping.
---
If they are confirmed bugs and blizzard can implement a stable experience WITH OUT any way of node/npc abuse and random NPC phasing I will be fine with layering. My concern is that if you're able to abuse black lotus, devilsaur's, etc then yes that would break the economy. Even if one person could duplicate black lotus, that's enough for me to see the game as being extremely unfair and unhealthy, it would be too far away from being "Classic".
---
Luckily I was a mage and could just blink without the risk of entering combat.
---
Hitting 40... grinding like mad for the gold... days later a plain brown horse. And you were damn proud of it.
---
Hey mate, did you get around to testing it?
---
Gnome Warlock, Tailoring and either Herbalism or Enchanting
---
There is no need to spec into prot during leveling. You can tank anything in any spec, but keep your board and sword updated. From level 50 to 55 you can tank Sunken Temple and BRD, but if you don't feel comfortable, you can swap to a hybrid spec. You \*could\* even tank 60 dungeons, as long as the server is fresh and 60 DPS classes don't do insane damage.
---
For my time commitment it‚Äôs probably unrealistic. It‚Äôs also a pretty sought after weapon so they‚Äôll be a lot of competition provided my guild even makes it that far progression wise.
---
Funny how quick this community changed their mind about changes as soon as people realised what nochanges actually meant.
---
This looks similar to the issue priests had/were having with blackout procing on delay after SW:P casts.
---
It takes less time than you'd think. Use your time smartly.
---
many words, same thing
---
I didn't praise anything. Feedback about how things are vs how they need to be is fine.
---
Criticizing their decision on porting the client is pointless as it is too late to change their minds.
---
There's no content to develop for classic, so bug fixing is really all they have to deal with. That's about as good a chance as there will ever be to get classic up to snuff.
---
Won't be there for the first 2 phases.
---
Did I hit a nerve? Does it really matter? Having the community design the game is a bad decision because the majority of people don't understand design. There, no ageism.
---
What is this supposed to mean?
---
The question is whether or not they will actually remove it
---
As I am not rushing at all, I will probably play through levels 1 to \~15. Or will be rerolling until I have found my ultimate ERP race/class/faction combo.
---
Is this really an issue? The sound is literally the same except for a puncture wound which in all honesty could do nothing else but make the game more immersive. Hardly doubt it will affect the nostalgia of the game but I‚Äôm a paladin so I smack people with mallets
---
I think you make a good point. It could rather, potentially, become the meta to layer hop etc, for nodes, quest items, mobs, or other stuff around the world. However, it's also quite hard to tell because this is a system which we've never experienced with vanilla, and the potential problems/benefits have only started to scratch the surface. On of my worries though is the possible random world phases, where mobs suddenly come into existance. It would brake the emergion and also cause some problems like; say you're in an empty cave, get layered, now you're sorrounded by enemies.
---
Going herb/alc?
---
Apparently yeah
---
Melee hunter is a thing in classic.
---
* What is the maximum number of guild ranks? I believe the answer to be 10, but if anyone has tested and could say for sure, that would be cool.

---
Hey buddy, what server you playing on?

Uhmm, Silvermoon.
---
Okay, let me make a character.

Hey where r u at?

I can't find you

this lad hasnt met a proper woman in her 30s.

Everyone hating on the Pallys that got their class mount for 1G at lvl 40.
---
&gt; After all shit the classic community had to take over the years
---
Grow up
---
If classic isn't polished AF it's going to fail, because pservers will always be an option. They'll have to deal with more cease &amp; desists, but no ones going to pay $15/month to play a worse version of the game.
---
Badidididi
---
At some point you just need to take a deep breath and calm down.  It‚Äôs not going to be 100% true to 1.12, and that‚Äôs fine.  Game is going to be a riot and is going to feel just like 1.12 and that‚Äôs all that really matters.
---
Orc Hunter or Troll Shadow priest
---
You don't need or want engineering. For raids getting people to flask is difficult enough. For PvP getting a good premade is what makes the difference. Save your gold to be able to change spec for raids and PVP and buy your consumables.
---
I don't see the problem with this
---
/warrior
---
Damn dude, there is no need to be so aggressive and rude. Take a step back and look at what you're insulting this guy over.
---
Yea, that could potentially happen. But you would say you are playing on Silvermoon 2 for example.
---
Are DME lasher farms really possible on retail with a holy nova priest? I have seen those tutorials, but I am completely insecure due to the huge differences between Classic and private servers. Or would warlock be a better alternative as a farming char? I don't want to roll mage, thinking about it makes my wee wee go soft. Maybe other good farming classes?
---
Fun fact:
---
Germans don't look for DPS in lfg they are looking for a DD (damage dealer).
---
Don't know why that is since DD is also English
---
Engineering mining.
---
This sounds WAY better than the layering that's on the beta now. I don't have any problem with this.
---
The rare recipe are BOP? No use in leveling on an alt then.
---
Jesus good fuck! That's some bad shit right there.
---
Funny post considering you're the one who doesn't understand spell batching.
---
I thought it releases on the 27th?
---
Hype will draw in A LOT of people. Most of them will quit soon because they dont really even like the game.
---
even though blizzard already looked into it and tested it and said no you‚Äôre wrong this is how it was?
---
gold is much more valuable in Classic WowW than retail. There is a video with the Guild Master of one of the best private server guilds and he says "gold is the most powerful item in Classic WoW".
---
He talks about on a fresh private launch he was one of the first to level to 60 and he spent 3 days farming devilsaur leather and had enough gold to never farm again for the next 18 months. He did this on a single layer.
---
Imagine the hard core guilds getting to 60 in 7-10 days and farming every layer on the server for the next 3 weeks while most of the playerbase catches up. First they will get to set the economy price of expensive materials like Black Lotus, Arcane Crystals and Devilsaur and become rich enough to not need to farm gold for the rest of classic wows lifetime. Secondly, once the playerbase catches up, the valuable materials will either be crazy hard to get or worse compelety deflated in value so it's not worth you farming them any more.
---
With layering I'm sure by the end of the second week, every physical dps class in the top guilds will have Devilsaur set and I wouldn't be surprised if guilds have 100's of Lotus banked for the future raids
---
Never understood the point. DM is deathmines and only becomes sure mail if you say something like east behind it.
---
I plan on fasting the first 5 days of Classic. I'm barely going to be getting out of my chair anyways so no need for calories!
---
If they‚Äôre invisible issues, then nobody will know about it and what does it matter?  You‚Äôre honestly saying you‚Äôre not going to be able to enjoy Classic because of the possibility there is a minor difference from 1.12 that you don‚Äôt even know about?
---
What a shitty way to approach anything in life.  You seem absolutely determined to make sure you don‚Äôt enjoy Classic.  But why?
---
Silvermoon 2.
---
Okay, cool I see you, lets go.
---
You can farm on warrior of you have the gear. As always, hit up a friendly mage for a few stacks of food
---
Usually these AAA publishers are the most popular and therefore a huge part of the industry and they are the ones im talking about. Of course there is a bunch of passionate indie developers still, but i think its so sad how these triple a games have ruined a big part of the industry.
---
Could have made the rogue 50% transparent instead of covered in diarrhea.. but alright
---
Genuinely believe you don't know the answer to my question, obviously i googled it, found mixed and unclear answers. You look really inadequate right now.
---
Wc3 Reforged got its own icon because Wc3 is not there yet. I assume WoW classic will be in the same menu as the beta currently: just an entry in the version dropdown in the WoW menu.
---
21 comments and none of them about french abreviations.
---
They tried to listen to the community, its not a bad thing. But it backfired, shit happens. Of course with insight it's easy to say they made bad decisions overtime. No it doesnt matter, but blaming kids in your post doesnt make any sense
---
&gt; Imagine going through the trouble of writing all this out, without even once taking a second to stop and think about it. 
---
The irony
---
Uhmm, Silvermoon 2.
---
Okay.
---
nobody quits the game \\o/
---
I upgraded pcs in tbc, i could actually go to shatt and it not be a slideshow or a 5 minute load.
---
It might not be a competition, but it's a hell of a lot more than being alone, with nothing in your life besides vidya.
---
Sounds like you may have to make that guild yourself
---
IDK how you are going to make most of your gold. I mean you could farm sappers but for the most part engy doesn't make too much money unless you get some good reflector patterns.
---
ohh so your idea is even worse, because ppl get to choose.  effectively, 300 servers at launch, and then just merge them together.
---
Wait, what? You're kind of projecting here aren't you?
---
What sort of mentally challenged person sees a list of "Silvermoon 1", "Silvermoon 2", "Silvermoon 3" and says that he plays on Silvermoon without a number?
---
The internet in a nutshell.
---
They left it there so you can uninstall it properly.
---
Mining, grinding, playing the ah and from doing raids.
---
I've done most of naxx on a pserver without professions as they seemed pointless due to how close classic is. I will be fine.
---
Yeah. Honestly I don't remember the French abbreviation, I started when I was a kid and the names of the places were still in English (stormwind, ironforge, etc...) It got changed later on but I don't know most names in French.

I'd trinket directly after the first kidney shot to waste his ks cd, then put dots on him and he can't continue his CC chain.

Female Dwarf or Tauren female
---
I dont have problem with german people since they are willing to group with english speakers, but god keep those frogs out of my eng servers.
---
Out of curiosity, what was the price of the first wands that you can make with enchanting after a while of beta runtime?
---
Well it give us Classic WoW lol
---
What are they doing this time
---
Tbh I think it was the same in vanilla. I remember only starting to struggle in westfall on my rogue, just like in the beta. And the avoidance handicap is only level 1 - 9, after that it goes to normal values something I can attest to since I have a 18 rogue on the beta. It's parry parry Dodge miss. Only thing I seem to miss too little of are yellow attacks, can check my recount when I get home.
---
This is the most apt descriptions in the whole thread. I found the guile haired human thing to be spot on. Also couldn't be happier with rolling Male Tauren.

 I perhaps overstated it, after checking out the list it seems like there were less bop than i remembered. Sp perhaps it would have been more accurate if I had written that it's easier if you are 60 since many recipes are drops in dungeons. Also some recipes are from reputation grinds.
---
To be fair, those guilds will be min/maxed by week 3 no matter what but yes I agree this is quite possibly a major issue. It's essentially duping materials which I don't understand how anyone could argue that would be fine.

As said below, for levelling, a hunter's strong point is low downtime and ability to solo tough quests. A mage's strong point is its ability to aoe grind mobs, but they need to drink a lot. They're not a bad duo, but they don't really compliment each other at all.
---
Invite please.
---
But its not designed with these people in mind. Its designed for *us*, the people who want to build long term communities. Dead servers will kill that far more than layering will. It sucks, yes, but its a necessary evil and the best course of action we have so far. 
---
They might even take layering down after week one. Remember that the demo servers at Blizzcon had a time limit of I think an hour per person. Blizzard said they had to do it for all the people to be able to play. Everyone was pretty upset. Turns out after a few hours into the demo they didn't need it so they turned it off. I have no doubt that layering will be the same.
---
Whoa dude
---
I had to grind like crazy too, and I only reached lvl 40 in 2007, so it wasn't like EVERYONE and their mother was scavenging to get 90g for their mount training like they will when classic releases... I'm pretty sure a guildy even gave me 15g because inflation had already hit pretty hard.
---
I'm so set on playing an aoe mage that this would make the game unplayable for me.
---
Male troll hunter is pretty nice. Like the bow animation, goes well with the hunched over look.
---
So are dungeons.
---
Because having video evidence of something is just so worthless and does nothing right?
---
Yes it is atm, so probably after launch as well, they want to keep it as the same product
---
Totally neato dude
---
That's blizzard for you
---
you mean r/retailshills?
---
My original comment was removed for mentioning the names of the popular private servers? Lmao. Anwyho..
---
If they are confirmed bugs and blizzard can implement a stable experience WITH OUT any way of node/npc abuse and random NPC phasing I will be fine with layering. My concern is that if you're able to abuse black lotus, devilsaur's, elemental mobs, etc then yes that would break the economy. Even if one person could duplicate black lotus, that's enough for me to see the game as being extremely unfair and unhealthy, it would be too far away from being what it really is. 
---
Just a quick edit so you don't think i'm talking completely out of my ass. I'm not an expert on classic wow economy but every time I did the whole fresh experience with all of the private servers, i've managed to obtain close to 500 gold before hitting lvl 35 just by playing the auction house. But I also capped myself to lvl 35 so it wouldn't kill the end game for me when classic launched, so i can't speak too heavily on endgame but i've listened to days worth of podcasts involving the game in general.
---
I have to admit that some kind of new alternative future sounds interesting!

yes skinning mb fixed it.

This isn't spellbatching though. Blizzard tried to SIMULATE spellbatching, but it is NOT the same system. The current system is crap, rather no batching at all if they can't get it right.
---
lol at all the people that didn't completely read this and made reminders.
---
That sounds like a guild that gets founded later in the game, when leveling and getting EQ isn't the main focus of everyone anymore. 
---
If such a guild will exist from day one I don't know,  but after some tons m time you can surely find players interested.
---
And forgot the most important thing. People cant just leave duels by accepting party invites. You can only switch channels out of combat or maybe at the character selection screen. Also horde vs alliance wars on the same channel wont be layered so lets say a channel has a 40v40 battle, it will show 80 players on that channel.
---
God, you kids just don't understand life in general. Crying about layering is basically asking for a 2-3 hour queue for the first few weeks of launch. Or worse, dead servers after a month. Layering is honestly not a bad idea at all. You can't just have thousands and thousands of players for your "big event". That's not realistic, that would never happen, that's not real life. Get a grip
---
Yes it does because kids tend to be less mature and insightful when it comes to topics like game design.
---
They know what is fun to them but don't understand why it is fun to them. Design is a freaking complex topic and it just goes beyond what the average kid or teenager can understand, so it's a terrible idea to listen to them. That said, the majority of people never think about underlying design systems so they only see what's on the surface. They like what's on the surface but fail to understand that what makes the stuff on the surface great is the stuff below the surface. 
---
Everyone hates grinding but loves the rewards. The average person fails to see that being done with the burden of the grind and the fact that this burden adds to the scarcity of the reward (and scarcity is awesome when you're an owner) are elemental in why the reward is meaningful.
---
Look at the free stuff Blizzard handed out over the years. The rarer and harder to obtain a mount is, no matter how ugly, people will use it. Core Hound mount? Pretty awesome looking? Doesn't matter. Even though almost everyone got it (who played then), nobody uses it, because you cannot express your awesomeness with it. SoO Mythic Garrosh Scorpion mount? Butt ugly, but everyone who has it uses it to show off, because few people have it.
---
And yet, whenever Blizz adds something that is hard to obtain, the people who won't get it will whine about it, because they fail to see that a huge part of the value comes from the fact that not everyone can have it.
---
Just as an example of people not understanding design.
---
Listening to the community is not the same as doing everything the community says. You NEED to understand that they don't understand design. So when they say "I like X and want more of it", you don't just make more X, but as a designer think about what made X great and then recreate the experience behind X, rather than just copying the surface of X.
---
Yea it sounds assholish to people and their opinions, but WoW is the living proof that letting the playerbase design a game is horrendously stupid.
---
absolutely, duplicating items is the best way to describe it.
---
Of course the top guilds will be min/maxed early on but they usually invest a lot of gold into doing this which is great for the economy. Me on my fresh 60 waiting for my friends to catch up can go and get lucky finding a Black Lotus or try to tag down a Devilsaur spawn with a few other guys and share the gold and the top guilds are hungry for our mats because they want to clear MC before the reset.
---
With layering there is too much flexibility for those top guilds/players to not need the little guys because it can be more easily manipulated
---
sounds like the internet sucks out there though.
---

I want to do rank 10 for the full blue set. In my mind right now I want to continue to maybe 13 or even 14. I don't know if I want to when I'm at rank 10 haha. We'll see
---
Definitely the shoulders. Those grey bastards from trash in VC may not have had stats, but damn did they make me feel powerful.
---
awful idea.  People would all try to join server 1 or 2.  3 and 4 would be low pop dead servers.  If you made them full, then you would split up friends and family trying to play together.
---
This is how my brother and I used to talk...though i‚Äôm pretty sure we were doing that with counter strike closer to 2001-2003...fun times
---
Because we like to be as efficient and speak as accurately as possible. DD, damage dealer, describes the role perfectly. Someone is a damage dealer, he is not a damage per second. A healer isn't called HPS, a tank isn't called TPS.
---
When I started playing on private servers, that was a change I had to get used to. And I still assert that DPS doesn't make any sense, especially since DD is even one third shorter! And it is the same letter twice, so you save precious milliseconds while typing!
---
Yep,  effectively many server at launch but fewer over time. The merging would be obvious and easier to controll, and the merges would not result in name collitions.
---
Your original post was:
---
&gt;Hey buddy, what server you playing on?  
---
&gt;Silvermoon?  
---
&gt;I can't see you  
---
&gt;See you in 2 months  
---
&gt;/quit the game
---
Don't do it. I'm sure you won't even be able to get past the character selection screen.
---
so you basically want to replace layering with layering
---
Yeah, coupled with leeway there's no reason not to play a warrior or rogue.
---
This. When I got back from work I would immediately log-in and start up my 139 minute queue or whatever it was. God help me if I disconnected. It was appalling and it went on for months. That said, the game grew so fast I did not blame blizzard for it. The created a fantastic product that was over popular.

It's a cringe compilation of the past 3 weeks. All the clips have been laughed about to death and actual analysis has been sparse. 
---
If only people would continuously test edge cases of ~~sharding~~ layering, like they did on the first day of the Blizzcon demo.
---
And all that could actually be discussed within one topic, but noooo, every snowflake out there has a unique take on it, that can't be shared within another layering topic.

Please support this statement with a better argument.

Take your smart phone with you
---
I got my epic mount 2 days after 60. Played a mage and gold farming is easy once you play RS for years beforehand.
---
Will they change the current leeway bullshit or will everyone just roll a warrior?
---
I wouldn't say it's bad. We get 1.5 Go download speed.
---
I just thought about something guys, I think it is quite revolutionary, I'm actually shaking in excitement wirh this realisation. Listen now to what I am about to tell you in two simple but effective points:
---
  * Retail game bad
---
  * Classic game good
---
I hope others have seen the light as well.
---
I believe in classic, the mount itself is the expensive part. i.e. it will cost 1000g for a mount and say 100g for the skill to ride it (before rep and pvp rank discounts). So maybe you don't want to buy to another mount.
---
I believe in the 1.12 patch they reversed this so the skill was actually the expensive part. However, I believe it was Ian Hazzikostas who said that "as this was only for one final patch, it isn't really what you experienced in vanilla" -or something to that effect.
---
I recently realized my DVD drive is broken. No idea since when. I really need to check if there is still a disc in there before tossing it.
---
Since USB and super fast internet, physical mediums are really not needed anymore.
---
People against layering just aren't realistic. There's literally only 3 scenarios that happen without layering.
---
A) Servers capped, regular amount of servers, so the servers are stable. Mass people trying to join, huge queue times. Huuuuge. Bitching on Reddit about waiting 2 hours to play, and then probably disconnecting to back of queue.
---
B) More servers, capped, everything seems ok at first. Within a month there would be a dire need for merging already with tons of dead servers. Bitching on Reddit about game being dead already.
---
C) They let 10k people on each server to shut you all up and the game runs extremely poorly, you can barely get anything accomplished with so many people, and you're back on Reddit bitching again.
---
I think the order tends to be Mage, Hunter, Warlock. Potentially Feral Druid/Paladin also. 
---
I‚Äôd just pick the one you enjoy playing the most and make it work!
---
I played paladin a lot and kinda liked just to spam flash of light. Then I tried priest and holy shit it's so much more fun to manage several different healing spells and their ranks while also having shields, renew and prayer of healing. One annoying thing however is that because the paladins are so fast with their heals, you kinda have to rely on Flash Heal to snipe the paladins and that's very mana inefficient. 
---
I also quite like having the PI buff. Before every boss the whispers will start as the mages and warlocks are begging for PI's. At some point we had a mage who just flat out gave me 10g per power infuse. Made me a lot of money lol.
---
You said it received -1 class. You're obviously talking about the entire game.
---
A nice well put together compilation of highlights that pool together multiple different ways in which layer ruins gameplay and be heavily abused. Not everyone scours twitch for highlights so its a nice way to get the point across with video evidence in a single condensed video.
---
can I get one of those pm‚Äôs as well
---
1.5 Mbps?
---
I'm playing on a private server right now and I definitely notice an abundance of shamans. But on the same token I always see people spamming for shaman healers for all pieces of content. Totems are godly.  So godly that you want a shaman in every group of a raid. I would say on average, less people are inclined to heal at  end game than dps so being the most sought after healer will help your gear grind despite competition. If you make the right group of friends in classic and get in a guild you like, there will be a spot for you.
---
I second the opinion that you lock yourselves away together in the same home and just play the game together. Order multiple kinds of take out, get some drinks, and just baste yourselves in farts and gamer juices until the sun comes up the next morning. Then everyone can make the walk of shame back home to their real lives. Chances are good that they'll want to make that a regular event if able.
---
Reserve the best raid slots with flag-themed towels.
---
Yes you get a chat message when someone passes, greeds or needs.
---
Shoeys are legit, it's a love hate relationship. You hate when you have to do a shoey but you love when your mate has to guzzle one down from a old converse.
---
I forgot this picture still existed. Still funny tho.
---
What are you even talking about?
---
You can have English language settings enabled in client and still be on the German server. The language of the game is not the point here.
---
The point is the language the community uses. So you can speak English and you would like to have an English speaking community? Fine then choose an English speaking realm. You can't speak English? Then use the realm for your native language .
---
If no language specific realm exists people are no forced onto the same realms. Many who can't speak english. So they are starting their own communities on that realm and it gets fragmented. Suddenly you can't even understand half of what going on in trade chat. And then your English speaking capabilities will not help you since people are not speaking it
---
GTA V single player is great. Online is a pay-to-win hellhole.
---
What you see here is not proper spell batching behavior. Something is messed up on batching's implementation in Classic.
---
Classic is super hyped up and doesn't require a purchase or special subscription.
---
A HUGE amount of players will try it out. Everyone and their mom. I don't know why people would think it will drop below pserver levels (that's just fucking stupid) but it's entirely possible that many of the people coming to try it out won't stick around. (it's also possible that people will love it so hard that the population will keep growing - who knows?)
---
Classic is a special kind of game. As much as I love it, the slow, grindy nature of the game is not for everyone.
---
Not mega, giga. We've had it for almost 2 years now. Before that the highest avaible was like 250 mbps
---
I misunderstood. because you only had two bloodhoof servers, which made would make no sense given the way you were describing the idea.  So, I assumed you were putting the playerbase in layers and then locking them.  
---
This idea more or less has the same problem, because once a layer is filled, your friend can't get in.  And if you don't put a cap, then layer #1 will just become massively overpopulated.
---
If you intend to be *the* shadowpriest then you should probably start looking for a guild already now. Usually guilds will only take in one shadowpriest, especially in later content. If you show up every raid then I'm sure you'll be treated like any other raider and get tons of loot.
---
&gt;5th grade level rant
---
the irony
---
Yeah, loads of people are getting vacations or have decided to nolife the leveling for the first weeks. To pull some numbers out of my ass I would say after 2 weeks, average playtime per player will be cut like 20-40%.
---
It works the same way as in vanilla
---
No ganking low levels?
---
Nostalrius gave us Classic WoW, not some online petition.
---
The deal I made with several friends was if they started playing, I‚Äôd buy their mount at 40 and they could pay me back whenever.
---
Servers would still be the population count (low/high), and why would *all* try to join 1 or 2? And I'm not sure what you mean by it would split up friends, friends would still state what server they are playing on?
---
But yes, some population imbalance would occur probably, but atleast you'd never phase in between layers.
---
I do agree though it might not be the best solution.
---
:\^)
---
Add like a 10 minute timer between switches and this is the obvious solution.
---
As soon and Mug'Thol(1) hits 2k players then Mug'Thol(2) opens up. And people default login to the least populated server. Some will switch back over but some won't care and will just join right away. 
---
One problem though is that this give's the players control and blizz doesn't want that, they want control of how the layers are populated. Otherwise, you could have an organised horde population sieze control of Stv and force the alliance to log and switch to layer 2 to get their questing done.
---
So this could be detrimental to wPvP in its own way.
---
And then what happens if you get on layer 8 at a high peak time but you stay on for hours and the population drops. Should you be allowed to stay in an empty layer and have free riegn of the resources and mobs?
---
Or should blizz boot you back to the login screen? Maybe with a warning, "this layer will close in 5 minutes". Giving you time to finish up a mob and hopefully find a safe spot to logoff.
---
The semester starts two weeks before release. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm going to tell my professors there was a death in the family or say I have the flu, but I do know that I won‚Äôt be in class that week!
---
Exactly. I'm stoked for classic, and I'm so tired lf the bitching from these whiny unrealistic brats. Dead servers with no layering? Bitch. Huge queue times with no layering? Bitch. Huge server instability with no layering? Bitch. It's fucking pathetic
---
Terrible idea. People already use the current implementation of layering to hop around multiple layers for chest spawns, to avoid ganks or to mine a mining node 10 times. You're just making this abuse more convenient.
---
i rather have those quit who demand for a more retail version of classic than those who want a rough and edgy classic wow as it was with vanilla.
---
What he said, it pops up like ‚Äú‚Äùplayer x‚Äù need rolls 99 ‚Äú
---
i significantly remember improved blizzard for some reason proccing before damage even would occur
---
I meant his post in general.
---
I'll be rolling Hunter still because I want a Hunter and they will fix the issues in due course. Chill, guys.
---
He spoke in vanilla too. i have video of it and i just checked it.
---
From this post I'm convinced you never played vanilla.
---
Lmao, I am. I'm just constantly infuriated with the downright idiocy of this community.
---
\*Guffaws in streamer\*
---
I just can't wait to play with a mount again gonna be interesting
---
Well if you dont count not seeing people fading away, actually seeing 20 players in a 10v10 battle, people asking for layer invites constantly and the opponent just leaving you while pvping because switched layers. Yes its the same other than these.
---
Couldn't get a straight answer last week. Is there confirmation that vanish immunity is working. This is what allowed you to completely be immune to damage for a portion of a second when you use vanish, including PvP interactions like pyroblast and PvE interactions like damage and knockbacks. It may have been related to spell batching.
---
This is incredible
---
OMG my god, that's the joke, don't you get it?
---
I've only done to rank 9 on private servers, will be interesting to see if it'll be easier or harder in Classic. My money is on easier since you won't have 150k people on one server competing for the higher standings. 
---
Regardless I want to do at least rank 10 as I was sooo close on Nost but it got shut down by Blizzard literally the week before I would've gotten rank 10 :(
---
After that though.. I certainly have the time to go further but damn, I'm not sure I have the drive to play WoW 24/7.
---
Hey! Thanks, gotcha!
---
Would that be solved if we can safe your list into our Google Drive?
---
You can get a near identical experience by playing on one of the many private servers.
---
Private servers are actually better than the beta right now because people are actually on them and you can level past 40.
---
I did get it back I was very happy.
---
I mained a mage, and while I don't think it was this drastic in vanilla (even with the higher ping), blizzard was always pretty unresponsive and and this was why most experienced mages didn't take imp blizzard for PVP. I remember being hyped for it when leveling my original character but quickly found it to be mostly useless in PVP.
---
Anyway, here is a video of non-improved blizzard being used in actual vanilla.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7HJlsZGCm8&amp;t=3m25s
---
You can see the rogue gets pretty far (and he's in stealth, so moving slower) before the damage hits him out. It seems reasonable considering that Blizzard only ticks once per second, and doesn't tick at the start of the cast. There doesn't appear to be any extra delay though, by my estimation it looks like almost exactly 1 second of blizzard before he is hit out, so Perplexity's clip seems significantly worse, taking nearly 2 seconds from the time he enters what APPEARS to be the AOE (including the significant delay between entering AOE and gaining the blizzard debuff, which seems accurate).
---
Even if he's getting really unlucky timing though, running in right after a tick to get the maximum time before next tick, the delay seems too big. The only thing I can think is that he is running into the aoe before a tick, but not getting hit by it because the debuff hasn't applied to him yet (which is definitely something that could happen in vanilla) then getting ANOTHER FULL SECOND before the tick applies, then getting the maximum spell batching window to get hit. Doesn't seem that likely to happen twice in a row...
---
I would like to see more tests of this. How quickly does blizzard tick when used directly on top of someone? Is blizzard not ticking at the same time on all targets if they entered the AOE at different times?
---
None is predicting that ? lol
---
Yes the server caps will be lower, but there's only 1 of each pserver not 10-15 or whatever amount of servers blizzard is dishing out.
---
Do you think the people that are reached by this see it as that ? A put together compilation of a beta product. 
---
What will their reaction be ? What's the sentiment that they're going to echo back into the community ? I'm not sure that somebody that isn't obsessed with the game is going to sit through a 10 minute video for a bug either.
---
Lol no, you minority specs need to learn your place.
---
Now I'm off to raid thanks to my meta-privilege.
---
Macro'd in with a /pet
---
The popular SM/Ruin PvE spec for raiding has you cast an assigned curse, Corruption and Shadowbolt.
---
Sure this is endgame PvE but
---
I played a paladin in vanilla. It would have been faster and easier to grind the 900 gold. You had to complete a quest line that took you across both continents, and still cost hundreds of gold in mats and quest fees, and ended with a boss fight in Scholomance that required a competant team to overcome. 
---
Very rewarding when you get your kick ass mount, but it was by no means the cakewalk it is today.
---
Warlocks, on the other hand...
---
Nostal have a big role, but Mark Kern bring the petition to Blizzard's office
---
laughed out laughed out loud
---
Orc Female is bae! They have the best model in the game while wearing plate armor. Hence why i play one for my warrior.
---
That's very far from the truth. It's funny how you [accuse people of not understanding batching and vouching for it](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c401vo/you_can_run_through_improved_blizzard_thanks_to/erueu4j/) while being clueless yourself. Maybe [you are the one that's repeating what others have told you, like a mindless drone ](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c401vo/you_can_run_through_improved_blizzard_thanks_to/eruj10x/), whoops!
---
Yes, removing the part which allows people to layer hop in order to avoid pvp/farm additional nodes and breaks the illusion of a cohesive world makes it worse.
---
Because that's how it nearly always works. They have to use statistics and can't just "trust" classic. That's a huge fuck up to just toss layering to the side, and we have massive queues in the beginning and dead servers in a month. If they are wrong, then you guys get what you want anyways -- massive servers. It's honestly a win win, you just need to be an adult and have some patience
---
Ahh man Nostalgia trip complete with this.
---
Hopefully someone comes up with an updated version with epilepsy inducing flashing background
---
I do miss the awesome relevance mages had back in the day with their portals.
---
Female Dwarf. Easy.
---
Primarily because blizzard thinks this and making new games requires a lot of analysts to estimate initial playerbase and dropoff.
---
I wish I could play 1.6 5v5 with ranked matchmaking. Csgo is trash nowadays.
---
Classic WoW wouldn‚Äôt of happened without Nostal, it probably would still of happened without the petition though. It‚Äôs a nice thought but Blizz would have been monitoring Nostal anyway and seeing the amount of players it had, it wasn‚Äôt as though they didn‚Äôt know Classic would be popular
---
Because it's just how human brains work.   
---
There was a guy in my area that won a local election, because his name started with the letter a.  No one knew this person.  They didn't spend a dime campaigning.  
---
Also, people like high pop servers so they would be more inclined to go there.  
---
There's two possible scenarios,
---
1.  The 1st servers become overpopulated.
---
2,   The servers are capped, and the first ones become full, thus splitting players.
---
*guffaws in streamer*
---
You notice that the apes guild seems to be doing a lot of the deeper testing. Thank you apes for doing your job as beta testers. Unlike streemers it seems, every time I see them notice a bug I always hear "I'll report it later, it's been reported, I am just playing beta not testing". I know they are not really in beta to test but then get more people to test
---
No problem. Just spawn C'thun on top of them to cull the numbers.
---
Didn't know what "go" was lol
---
Every warlock and Paladin.
---
Oh and people hated them for it.
---
This is a work of art
---
I wish more people would read \^ this. Gold on your first character is more precious and scarce than at any time. Don't squander it on profs until you've invested into your main at 60. This could be Lionheart Helmet on a warrior, or Fecloth gear on a Warlock, or even just epic riding for gathering profs/PvP. Don't level crafting profs until you \*know\* there is an endgame need, and save yourself the literal hours of time and hundreds of gold.
---
I'm wondering this as well.
---
Like I really hope I'll be able to download the client before the 13th, otherwise how am I supposed to hope to secure my names.
---
What about protection paladins, tank shamans, spell powered rogues/warriors, arcane power hunters, melee hunters, tank hunters?!!!
---
I guess it's my french taking over. Its how we say Gmbps
---
I edited the post to clarify that list abit. As i stated in the post, the cap could be around 3k (or some other cpa). Once a layer (or server if you like) is filled, queues would be initated, but your friend would still be able to join.
---
But each layer might have population imbalance, that would still be a problem. So i agree, it wouldn't solve every problem, but it would defeat having to phase inbetween layers.
---
First thing I did was ride my emerald raptor naked into Stormwind...
---
Dunno why I thought that was a good idea. Still have the picture taken shortly before it somewhere where I was staging this stunt with some friends... That horde elwynn death run...
---
Hot take: if you need spell batching or wave dashing or any of those equivalents to be good, you were never good at pvp and actually were just good at exploiting a mechanic.
---
Hold on, let me just line up my Aimed Shot...
---
Ah dam, all good!
---
layering doesn't do that. say there are 3000 players on the server right now. all players can see each other and interact with each other. say 1 guy enters the server. now there will be 2 layers, 1 with 3000 people in it and 1 with 1 guy in it. the 3000 people will not see anyone fade away or notice a thing.   
---
people aren't going to be asking for layer invites on launch. people ask for layer invites during beta and stress tests because there honestly isn't a lot to do so you might as well follow the streamers around because they at least try to do things.   
---
the scenarios you've made up assumes that most players and their friends are fully coordinating between layers at any given time in a way that lets them bail out of  open world pvp-- like, get real.   
---
honestly, I like to think that it's more likely that the people who roll pvp server PROBABLY do it because it's part of the experience
---
Back in vanilla, people picked whatever they felt like playing since they didn't actually know the game. They didn't spend hours researching the classes they might be interested in, they didn't pick a certain class because of the usefulness. They picked them, because they looked like fun or they are familiar with the archetype from previous games or even movies like LotR
---
That's why Hunter (Archers), Mages, Warriors, Rogues, Priests and Warlocks (because they always attracted the edge lords)
---
No one is denying Nostalrius role in this project
---
Female dwarf...love the flying ponytails when she casts.
---
Agreed. The only people screaming to remove this are the back-pedalling casuals of WoW. Having a true and proper spell batching system is necessary for high end pvp.
---
Dude would be torn to shreds. Not able to walk for week either.
---
No, but I‚Äôm denying the petitions role in the project, it‚Äôs just stating the obvious that people wanted Classic servers.
---
It is.  Have you played retail lately?  Every single thing in the game has a 1 second delay.  Every time you loot, everything you say, there is a delay.
---
So true... It's hilarious!
---
And smite priest
---
I love healing in PVE but there is so much more to Classic than just raiding so sadly I'm going to not pick a healer :(.
---
LOL. Whatever man..
---
There is a private server that launched yesterday (not saying the name because it's against the rules).
---
They certainly had dynamic/increase spawn rates as mob respawned within 5-10 seconds of killing them.
---
Images taken from incidents during this video: [https://youtu.be/rrnw7XuGTJQ](https://youtu.be/rrnw7XuGTJQ)
---
Many other incidents happened to streamers who didn't have their faces shown, so no O-faces from them.
---
You should change title to 10 minutes of people exploiting layering.
---
This is so stupid. I play on pvp servers where i get ganked all the time so I went to group quest anyways to get exp and the main time I level in dungeons. 
---
This is exactly the bla bla fuzzzy comfort zone thinking that has ruined the game! Fuck this! Turn on your brain and think about alternatively leveling techniques...
---
Its a package, in the end it's the community will
---
Where‚Äôs my boy Stino
---
Not really?
---
Of the many things being requested to be replicated in Classic, this particular "feel" was never one of them. Things that were implemented to deal with old internet connectivity problems shouldn't be replicated in the modern day where those connectivity problems are greatly reduced/non-existent.
---
I feel like some times they overdue the "feel replication".
---
Fucking gold.
---
Wholesome.
---
I agree with you, however, most people would probably just say tvat they're focusing on the wrong things lol..
---
&gt;  For raids getting people to flask is difficult enough. 
---
What does that have to do with anything?
---
Flasks provide less benefit and are more expensive than engineering, if you even for a second consider flasking you should be an engineer.
---
Only the epic mount quest which arrives with dire maul.  The quest is really cool and the summoner mount looks amazing. The hardest part is it requires a lot of arcanite bars, but if you have access to mining it can significantly reduce your overall cost to get it if you farm your own.
---
5 minutes is the default. Some named mobs can have longer or shorter respawn timers. Each layer is the size of a full sized server so roughly 3000 concurrent players, only Blizzard knows the exact number.
---
I play like you. Almost sounds like I would have written this post. 
---
In an alternate universe yesterday, me (troll mage) and random orc warrior new friend were ganked relentlessly by two 19 twinks in southern stone talon while trying to do the grim totem escort quest. The graveyard runs were around 5-6 min to get back to our corpses. We lost almost 30 min of our time and we didn‚Äôt get to finish the quest before we gave up and hearthed back to crossroads. 
---
I am starting to wonder if I have time for this when Classic hits. I love the world at war and the dynamics that PvP brings, but I have such limited time as a 40 year old dad with a toddler and new born. 
---
I‚Äôm really torn.
---
Depends if the ratio of layers to population assuming blizzard knows what it is doing they will be close to equal to vanilla's average. If they are lower pop per prices will be higher and if they are having then population per they will be higher.
---
Because lag simulation isn't authentic?
---
If you want the real feel of vanilla wow, play on dialup.
---
So there is no point to playing private if it shuts down in 2 months? So there is no reason playing retail because there will be a patch in a few months? 
---
Also if it's fun, who cares if it shuts down? I use my time to just enjoy and sort of memorize quests so it becomes that much easier to level in classic, and so I know what I need to level professions to help me get mount. There are millions of things you can do on private servers.
---
And more importantly, I will reemphasize, you can still have fun.
---
Want to buy
---
Bruh yes! Thats amazing, what a flashback.
---
I wanted more faces. If you've got another link with someone getting layered I'd add them in.
---
Just vendoring greens is fine as well. Not too many will be buying dusts etc early on I'd imagine.
---
Retail is ok if you take the game for what it is.  
---
It's just a completely different type of game now from Classic.
---
&gt; They observably do, just at shorter intervals than vanilla blizzlike batching.
---
Yeah I know, I meant the fake spell batching Blizzard is trying to implement.
---
&gt;It is still possible most of the time. It will just fail occasionally. You always scatter trap good players to avoid getting frost reflector/skulled on your trap.
---
This is true but it's still a nerf. People are reporting that FD is buggy in general though, it never works in BGs for example.
---
You only YOLO once my dude
---
you'd be wrong.
---
The dot always applied in ticks on a fixed timer with the spell, so if you got lucky between ticks this definitely happened in vanilla too. 
---
Mind you, you would never use blizzard like this to slow someone in front of you. There were a million better options.
---
Inb4 "ducking american" comment , im a fellow european myself and i d like to see language servers.
---
however going all nut about it and everyone posting " i wont play classic ! " on the official forums and this reddit , wont help in any way :D
---
Shut up stupid.
---
Fallout is pretty fun.
---
Rogues are Scissors
---
Warriors are Rock's
---
Hunters, Paladins, Priests, Druids, Mages, and Shamans are Paper
---
Warlocks are Mushrooms
---
Paper beats Rock
---
Scissors beat Paper
---
Scissors also happen to beat Rock
---
Until Rock hits 60, at which point Rock becomes an Unstoppable Killing Machine. Then also beats Paper.
---
And would beat Scissors, but it can't find Scissors, because Scissors are invisible.
---
So Scissors beat Paper, and avoid Rock.
---
And that is called Balance.
---
That's not how it worked. Leeway wasn't 12 yards for melee either. That's all new trying to be sold as authentic. Melee weren't casters and you couldn't run through blizzard either
---
&gt; So there is no point to playing private if it shuts down in 2 months?
---
Not for me, no. I just got finished progressing from MC -&gt; Naxx on ND, I have no desire to immediately start fresh on a new private server when Classic is coming out in 2 months.
---
&gt;So there is no reason playing retail because there will be a patch in a few months?
---
That is a massive apples-to-oranges and you know it. Stop being disingenuous.
---
&gt;you can still have fun.
---
I have no interest in a private server that's shutting down in 2 months. Stop harassing me for having an opinion.
---
It turns out 'no changes' actually means 'just the changes I want'.
---
Guess all we can do is keep posting this shit and hope blizzard already has a bead on it.
---
You can always master loot of you‚Äôre concerned about ninjas.
---
neither of those are demonstrably game breaking issues.  You are trying to mae a mountain out of a mole hill.
---
The MOST* beautiful.
---
That's funny. But maybe a rather weak assumption in this case, but you might be right.
---
Some players might also understand that, and pick 4 because they want low pop servers, while players that want high pop server pay the price by having to wait in queue. The idea is that there would be enough servers for everyone to go around at the launch, but decrease over time.
---
thanks
---
Ahhh change.org where autist Karen‚Äôs and Chads shit into each other‚Äôs mouth.

Exactly what has kept me away from getting very involved with private servers.
---
I don't want to alarm you but the Pet behavior has been like thing since Legion
---
Hi, /u/SquilliePlays
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c44sof/is_there_a_simple_guide_somewhere_explaining/). 
---
I have over 1k gathers played in my esl account alone. every single game of those was more balanced, much friendlier players, not many laggers since no russians etc joined, incredibly fewer cheaters, no leaver...
---
&gt;You should if
---
you play exactly optimally and with the knowledge gained from years of rote memorization on private servers. So realistically, MOST people will not be getting their mounts at 40, because MOST people are not autistic min-maxers like us.
---
Not if you roll druid ;)
---
Some research won't hurt you : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rQRdHw8LgmiPEVc8ST-cwdD1kKkBwhwlK1f0eO45voU/edit#gid=0
---
I'm not alarmed. And this isn't Legion.
---
in a raid my friend. I said in a raid. Not pve in general because hunter in a 5 man or solo is very complicated I agree.  But in a raid you stand there and aimed shot, multi shot with auto shots, feign once.  Rogues are similar, build up combos, SND and evis, vanish once to drop aggro.
---
But rogues suck in the sense that  they have to avoid cleaves and they have other positional things to worry about and it ends up being stupid half the time and I like that part where I have to run around in the chaos of melee.
---
Ah the good old "wavedashing is just cheating" argument, still coming out of the woodwork even in 2019. I love the internet.
---
Do you really need me to explain to you the difference? Not really right?
---
You're just uh.. being the standard Reddit pedant, yes..?
---
And? its been out for so long, go watch it
---
Lol yes, they are using the Legion Pet mechanic -- you don't know much eh?
---
It will have little impact in normal gameplay, these people are all exploiting.
---
I personally like killing bosses.
---
I remember being quite amused by this. Kind of funny I apparently rediscovered Oxhorn a few years ago with his fallout videos and didn't even realize it was the same guy until this very moment...
---
Yeah idk, that‚Äôs kind of a big deal.  You‚Äôd have to contact all your friends and whisper them your new name.  You‚Äôd have to explain to people it was you.
---
How hard is it to get a group as a Druid healer at 60 since you don't have a regular rez?
---
Is shadow priest and frost mage a good leveling duo?
---
Depends on what you mean by break the economy, if you mean "not 100% vanilla" then yes it could if blizzard doesn't balance layers properly. But the chances of having a "100% vanilla" experience is impossible because of player knowledge. But it will trend it closer with a similar supply with an assumably higher demand per population(increased knowledge) 
---
A broken economy would be one with so many people wanting the same resource that is finite that it goes for an insane price. 
---
And "these posts" are 1 for 100 compared to people bitching about layering.
---
Because most of the people wanting "authenticity" want it based off their subjective memory, which in most cases, turns out to be anything but authentic.
---
Why do you think this is just a "simulation" of spellbatching? Who has determined with any degree of accuracy that it's wrong and how did they determine that? 400ms batching is a tremendous difference from the responsiveness we as gamers expect from games. Show some hard evidence that spellbatching is not functioning like it's supposed to and then I'll be on your side. Until then, I'll be hostile to bullshitters spreading bullshit.

When you hit level 40 and still don‚Äôt have enough gold to buy the riding skill and a mount

Tauren with Ashkandi
---
Those YT comments are triggering me
---
I'm not in the beta. I care more for the overall thematics of the class than knowing the intricacies of all current bugs/issues.
---
Same. None of these bugs seem to be that big of a deal, at least during the leveling process. I'd say I have a better chance of dying from trying to find the Cheeto I dropped than from any of these bugs.
---

---
Hunter
---
I was there and those dynamic respawns felt just as bad as getting layered or sharded away in retail wow. you stand there and fight the exact same mob or maybe 2 if you're lucky for 25-40 min get level 6 then move from one quest area to another killing a single mob at each that respawns in 5 seconds, it's jarring, not fun and most certainly not blizzlike or anything like how the game was supposed to be. Just sayin'
---
Thank you :D
---
You will also have a ‚ÄúWoW Classic‚Äù shortcut on your desktop as well, so you don‚Äôt necessarily need the launcher...
---
Ret paladin, I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs necessary though kids can figure stuff out pretty well.
---
He will be fine if you teach him and play together. Mage, hunter are easiest classes. I wouldnt recommend healer for him.
---
Not in my christian elitist tryhard guild.
---
Attack normalization was just fixed, which was a nerf ;)
---
I get retail vibes from this post. In vanilla there was certain things always in high demand and low supply because of their crazy respawn times, but with layer hopping you can avoid that 1 hour respawn times for easy profit. I have made already my plans to break the economy for myself to earn much gold as possible until layering is removed. Epic mount on 60 ding, here I come!
---
Yeah I agree with that :)
---
200+ IQ
---
Hunter is without a doubt the easiest to level.
---
Having mobs disappear in front of you randomly is an exploit?
---
As a dwarf master race, we usually get along with the Taurens.
---
That is 1 depressing list.....
---
Yeah but I'm not holding my breath..
---
How is XP split in a group? When Im leveling with a friend is the XP split 50/50 or is generally less XP awarded for a mob kill?
---
Half way
---
1. People want the gameplay to be reproduced, and that includes mechanics that affect class balance and the flow of combat.
---
2. "Why" a mechanic exists has exactly zero bearing on the fact that the mechanic did exist and affected the gameplay. There are tons and tons of games that were made richer by unintended mechanics.
---
first of all i d avoid classes that are a pain to level , healing is not recommended for a beginner and a kid
---
so i d say go for DPS ,as it might be more appealing to a tounger player i guess?  
---
 and i d advise hunter as DPS if the class fantasy fits what he likes. Not too hard to level , skill floor is low , skil ceiling is high so they re always room for improvement.  Also they re not gear dependant so you can have fun without waiting 2 weeks in order to get gear.
---
as for tank , druids might be the best bet , flexible , okay for dungeons ,and shapeshifting is fun :)  however pretty bad in raid IIRC but it doesnt seem to be an issue
---
hope you two can have fun together !
---
i feel you, i actually like the iconic one better too, however i like the original vanish sound more
---
Probably because the games they make are really still quite decent? Like Star Wars Battlefront 2, I never bought it because of the microtransaction stuff but played it at my friend's house and the map design was gorgeous, the audio too.   
---
And even when it comes to AAA developers there are great games imo, I listed them somewhere below.
---
I had my mount on my first playthrough in 2006 too. A friend of mine whom was 60 told me how scarce gold was and how much a mounted was worth. I leveled skinning and lw on a druid back then. I farmed every single material i needed myself. I wasn't 60 with 10days /played. But i could affort my kodo at 40. But ofcourse when you want to rush to 60 you will have troubles with gold. But thats personal preference. I rather be slower but be ready.
---
Ah...Ballad of Buster Scruggs. Great movie and series of short stories.
---
nah why ? baguette here
---
Ok. I just watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k01xsCj_m20) and there wasn't a single Blizzard used in it. My argument still stands: the spell batching here is working exactly as intended, and *if* there is a bug it's that the first Blizzard tick does no damage, which has nothing to do with spell batching.
---
Didn't leeway work exactly like it does now in Vanilla though?  I am positive I noticed it all the way back then, although I didn't know exactly how it worked.  I used to think if one character/mob was chasing after another, the chaser got extra melee distance.  Now I know that *both* characters get extra melee distance if they are moving, but it's something that was noticable back in Vanilla and I don't get why people think bringing it back is going to ruin the game.
---
Don't know why you were downvoted, it's true. You get a fraction of the rep for grey quests and you can't turn in cloth before the AQ phase. You can turn in morroweed for darnassus and TB rep and it's super inefficient.
---
Male night elves are the worst. Playing one is inexcusable tbh
---
The mechanic existed because a problem in need of a solution existed. By trying to simulate the effect of that solution on a problem, without a problem actually being there, causes more problems.
---
Why should I listen to the judgement of a company that has failed its fanbase time and time again?
---
This!
---
The trick is to only learn skills you are going to use for your class. For example, as a feral Druid - I opted to not bother learning starfire ranks/nature‚Äôs wrath etc. 
---
The more frugal you are - the soon the better. 
---
Always try to sell on AH with a mark up.
---
You can get to 100g easily if you plan for it, and be disciplined in your spending.
---
I'm gonna feel very conflicted if there wont be RP-PvP server... Do I stick with RP-PvE or do I have to go to PvP server to play with xxNoScopeGodxx people.
---
Gnome Warlock &amp; Dwarf Huntard.
---
What do you mean? With this approach the namespace would collide, so names would stay static from day 1. Or did i missunderstand your comment?
---
That's because wow difficulty changed drastically throughout the patches and it just so happens 1.12 is the easiest implementation. People who remember it being harder aren't necessarily wrong. 
---
I remember mobs being able to get a couple steps on you before being slowed by blizzard in vanilla, but I really doubt 2+ seconds delay is intended even when factoring lag and spell batching and anything else. I'm sure there is plenty of video proof that someone can dig through.
---
&gt; and retail will never have the sense of accomplishment you get from classic.
---
one can hope they learn though
---
Yeah, It can be really depressive reading this sub sometimes because of this.
---
Let‚Äôs be honest that‚Äôs much less likely to happen now that 95% of the player base will be experienced players. On top of which, there are a lot more tools like reddit to find likeminded players so you can form groups with people you know, or tools like discord so you can even easily voice chat with randoms....
---
One person farming mats at a faster rate then normal does not equal a broken economy. You might make more money but assuming a good schedule of layer removing you at most will just farm it at a rate equal to the amount of people who want it. 
---
Also there will be others farming as well. Possibly more people, you jump layers there might be someone already killing that mob or mining that node. 
---
As for the " retail vibes" comment that just dismissive nonsense, but for retail there is no fixed resource the way there is in vanilla so this argument wouldn't exist there.
---
I know right? So many people here have no idea what they're talking about, and instantly use this vid as an excuse to flame a group of people. It's childish that they're screaming "IN YOUR FACE NO CHANGES PEOPLE, THIS IS WHAT YOU GET YOU HAPPY NOW?!" Like fuck me, please see that this is obviously not intended and will most likely be fixed.
---
Did they say that about what we are seeing here with the blizzard? If so, please link.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt a guild that focuses on primarily one thing get boring after a while? From your post, it seems like you don‚Äôt want to get stuck in a guild that‚Äôs only focusing on a single objective. 
---
But don‚Äôt you agree that any single minded focus, wether it be PvE progress, PvP, oddities (like you stayed), crafting, or whatever would be just as ‚Äúboring/bad‚Äù?
---
I think all good guilds will want to progress on PvE/PvP paths (that‚Äôs how the game is designed in the first place), but will often do other things to have fun.
---
I don't think it's a small issue, but I also don't think the content of the game itself should be judged on that unless an important chunk of it is missing. Then again, I don't know a lot of games that I paid full price for that had DLC that I absolutely needed to play.   
---
And well, you just picked one example out my rather long list, FF is so debated I'm not getting into that.   
---
CS:GO is so different from 1.6 that it's hard to compare but I love playing it competitively and I also really like how big the pro scene has grown, seeing it grown into a full esport is amazing.  
---
Also, I never mentioned Diablo Immortal so you're just making stuff up now, I said PoE.
---
If you are rooted leeway shouldn't even happen.  It's supposed to only happen when both players are moving.
---
Faceit Premium is great too.
---
As a dwarf player I agree with all of this. 
---
I'll add mine Horde:
---
-Tauren could be a dwarf's best friend if he didn't get tricked into being part of the horde. I usually eave them be and even help them in PvD.
---
-Undead..as a dwarf Paladin I hate you. I will follow you to the ends of Azeroth. You are an edge lord who only cares about your racial abilities and I can smell your basement dwelling, hot topic wearing, tern angst through the screen. 
---
-Orc are a good mix from what I've found. Some can be friendly and some brutal. Most are probably gym bros wanting to live out their bodybuilder fantasy and they like drinking Natty Lite and scoffing down Bugels.
---
-Trolls are shit. They gank. They run. They gank again. Who rolls a Troll?
---
It's a shame blizzard caved when the community demanded spell batching.
---
Lol I had epic flying before I finished that quest, I just dropped my 1k gold and said screw the mount.
---
I mean, you're completely wrong, but whatever. There's no point arguing with someone who was never good at anything competitive.
---
What classes can use what weapons? For example paladin cannot equip daggers I think?

If I remake it with another video's worth of faces I'll integrate him in better.
---
That is very true, I just don't want him to be too overwhelmed with abilities on his first go. He will have a lot to learn already as he hasn't played a real keyboard and mouse game ever before haha
---
thats the entire point of no changes. everyone knows the game had its flaws back then. i have no idea why people are upset by things like this. it's literally what we've been asking for.
---
LFM le BRD
---
I'll stake my life on that you actually won't kill yourself if you are wrong.
---
Where the pic is from?
---
Oh look, another reason not to play a ranged class.
---
I'm betting these all wont be fixed by release. Its Blizzard we're talking about.
---
It's in my Launcher already, and I have a desktop icon. I also signed up for beta testing, so maybe that's the difference?
---
I what way? Are they going to fix it till release? Are hunter pets bugged to? Damn i gues i roll a mage instead then.
---
Enjoy your repair bills
---
My main was a female orc lock but I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôll play this time around. That was a fun toon and the class quests were epic but once BC came around I rerolled to a more active server and left locks behind.
---
I‚Äôm kinda drawn to it again but then I‚Äôm also really considering priest, warrior, shaman and mage to a lesser extent. I‚Äôm all over the place lol. 
---
Here‚Äôs my thought process for giggles-Priests are great but the idea of spending days pressing the same keys in the same order for every mob all over again is holding me back from committing tbh. Silver lining is I know servers will be busy so I‚Äôll probably be able to breeze through healing instances, etc...
---
Mage is great but still have scars from all the downtime. I remember working through highlands having to drink on only every second mob if I timed things right. I wasn‚Äôt doing the frost aoe thing then though.
---
Warriors have great quests too especially the ww axe. Leveled mine on pve, this time it‚Äôll be pvp and I‚Äôm kinda nervous about getting ganked while leveling. Haven‚Äôt decided on a faction but I‚Äôm not sure I can deal rolling a gnome warrior.
---
Shaman...was my main once bc came out. Can‚Äôt think of a bad thing to say other than the first 10 or so levels were kinda boring. I got in to a decent guild pretty quick in to my leveling and thereafter only have good memories of the class maybe there‚Äôs something to that lol.
---
After all that I think I‚Äôm most excited to play a warrior....but I‚Äôll probably wind up as hunter üò±
---
id be interested to see your proof that it's not the same system
---
If you feel that way that's good, but I was arguing that the golden age of games is not over which judging from the post I reacted to clearly did not just include MMOs, so you really did not bring anything to the 'debate'.
---
Atleast for when they they did the stress test you just clicked on where it said World Of Warcraft above the the play button on the launcher there was a drop down tab for changing it from retail to classic.
---
Had dwarf mages made it into retail I would have been Alliance. Would have changed my entire path into Wow and I wouldn't have all the long time friends I do now... 
---
...still though, if I could go back... maybe.
---
I wasn‚Äôt much older than your son when I started playing WoW. It‚Äôs awesome that you‚Äôre going to be sharing these moments with him!
---
Long answer:
---
I would say, let him pick what he thinks looks/sounds cool! Especially since you guys won‚Äôt be doing raids. Letting him experiment with the classes would be fun! There are loads of quick class guides on YouTube that you could watch with him. 
---
I started out with a rogue. Now, rogues have a pretty large toolkit and I definitely was not taking advantage of it for most of the early days. It took me quite a while to get what I would consider just below average at that class. Regardless I still had a blast the entire time I was playing. I had no idea I was terrible at the class, I was just enjoying being a sneaky rogue in Azeroth while playing with my friends.
---
Short answer/tldr:
---
Dps easy mode: Hunter. Easy to pick up and he won‚Äôt die much but has a high skill cap if he wants to dig deeper into it.
---
Heals easy mode: Paladin. At endgame they pretty much spam one heal. High armor, tougher to kill.
---
Tank: I can‚Äôt recommend a tank that would be easy to play in vanilla.
---
You‚Äôre the one that created the exact same thread that literally hundreds of other people already have and yet you‚Äôre getting defensive and trying to insult the people that call you out for it lol. Learn how to use the search function or just scroll for 5 seconds and you‚Äôll find several people asking the same thing.
---
Cool thanks, I may jump in and say I want to be a healer before he picks, but I don't think most little boys want to the healer anyway haha, but you never know i guess

Do you need Alchemy to get the recipes to drop?
---
Sure it was.  Many of the good classic pvp players do some incredibly twitchy things like vanish a death coil that's already in the air by recognizing the animation of it.  You wouldn't be able to so the things most people wont recognize without the batching.
---
That still sounds a lot to me. My first computer had 64kb.

Ill aim for 14 hours play per day or so. I really want to no life the fck out of this situation. Not gonna rush though too hard.

Awesome, thanks!

Might noot be a simple question; Rogues have pickpocket and lockpicking they can play around with while stealthing around waiting for an opportunity to attack their opponents.
---
Do Druids have something similar to do while stalking their prey?
---
Can you people please for the love of god stop making new threads about layering just to say the same exact things over and over and over. Just pick a thread and talk to each other in there for crying out loud. 
---
All this layering spam is doing is making people stop caring about it and stop taking us seriously.
---
Think you just missed the point
---
Proof? Blizzard literally said this.
---
It almost feels like most of the forum is planning on rolling casters, lol.  When spell batching was announced there was a lot of support, because it's benerally a nerf to melee since interrupts and stuns happening at the same time as a casted spell means the spell still goes off.
---
And then when melee leeway got revealed, most people were against it, and keep making up BS about kiting is impossible now and all this crap.  Maybe if you had Dial-up in 2004 you didn't notice melee leeway but if you had a good connection, melee leeway worked like this back then and kiting was still possible.
---
Now spell leeway is working right and people support it?  Makes no sense unless there is heavy caster bias.
---
Um, it's common sense that they can't just fricken remove layering. Changing the game vs raw statistics on population drop off are completely different. Go stamp your feet for you 15k servers, see how it goes
---
I was responding to the guy that said changing a player‚Äôs name wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal.  Not your post.
---
I had that sound clipped into a custom addon I wrote to go off occasionally when my warrior used Mortal Strike... It was such a stupid thing to do but I couldn't stop giggling every time it went off.
---

This is great, thank you so much!

Or just play at your own pace and enjoy the extra hours of suboptimal gameplay. I'll be minmaxing alot, but we can't expect everyone to do this. In fact,  not planning anything will give you so much hype on every little step you take!

Looks at me ! I‚Äôm the only one who got this amazing Idiea that must be shared to the world !
---
BFA revenue will always be higher than Classic revenue (until 9.0). It's just that simple.
---
Not really - just attacks and movement (Pounce/Ravage/Shred/Dash).
---
Maybe they should just implement a standard ~100-200ms buffer whereby newer skills cast gain priority effect if cast within that timeframe.
---
Surely they can do narrow the window down so that people can‚Äôt just avoid entire AOE effects simply by running through them.
---
Can I get a pm. Woke up wanting to play classic so bad :&lt;
---
Yeah everybody needs to chill
---
No chance
---
Private servers have all of that.
---
Handle it!
---
if you havent helped your friend out with "guidance" are you even really friends?
---
Right now, there‚Äôs a static 5 minute respawn timer on non named mobs. For named mobs, i.e. Hogger, Goldtooth, etc, the respawn is much faster. It felt almost instant in some cases.
---
Don‚Äôt look at or listen to the rates on private servers. They‚Äôre not what‚Äôs on the classic beta.
---
I would just take skinning. Had 50s by lvl 9. Just questing and skinning the random left overs some left behind . This was on the stress test
---
I'm sorry, i jumped the gun. I agree with you in that case
---
Great response
---
No he didn't. All of the suggestion were layering with some wack a mole type rules. If this then that. 
---
Layering is the best option with the launch day problem. It is now only a struggle to figure out the ruleset for the layering.
---
Interesting cause on the stress test I had a ton of fun on my 15 hunter destroying everyone in WSG
---
That's why you wait for everyone to move first and ninja with a need once you're in the clear to snipe.
---
Currently I am in the beta, and ran my warrior to the NE starting zone. I received Darnassus rep when completing their quests.
---
Perhaps not to you, but to the players who want to take PvP seriously and competitively, removing spell batching will significantly change the game. I main a mage and don't look forward to absolutely obliterating rogues if spell batching gets removed. It was one of the only ways to get ahead of a frost mage in a serious duel.
---
Spell batching was initially implemented because the server couldn't keep up with spell requests when large groups of players were casting all at the same time. So spell requests were placed in a lower synchronous-frequency band (or tick-rate, whatever you want to call it) so that the server didn't crash or games freeze when 40 people were fighting Rag. As technology got better, it could. It has less to do with internet connectivity and more to do with the server not crashing.
---
Of course the server can handle not using spell batching now, but if you do keep it as the same as current WoW, the feel of the game will be different and so many high prospect pvpers will be disappointed. The vid that OP shared is distressing TO ALL players because this is not spell-batching. It's spell-batching on steroids, no one wants this.
---
Anyone else use silencer sounds on guns in vanilla? Thought that was funny as hell and helped muffle the annoying boom sound. 
---
So my perception of "vanilla wow hunters" is totally messed up anyway. lol.
---
I don't think I will ever touch retail again unless the soft-reboot it or something like that. It's an abomination at this point that completely misses the point why WoW was fun in the first game.
---
Well druids do too much damage on pservers, my druid on a pserver is hitting for 800s noncrit before hyjal raid has even dropped
---
I'm curious about using engineering while shapeshifted. Are their any restrictions? Can cats throw bombs?
---
Probably the best idea proposed up to this point. 
---
The only issue I see with it is the period where you add another layer, in which the layer would be dead for a couple of minutes to an hour.
---
Deadmines = Mortemines (MM)
---
Stormwind Stockades = La Prison (prison is short enough)
---
RFK = Kraal de Tranchebauge (Kraal)
---
RFD = Souilles de Tranchebauge (Souilles)
---
SM = Monast√®re Ecarlate (Mona lib , cim for gy, armurie for armory, cath for cath√©drale)
---
LBRS = same
---
UbRS = same
---
BrD = same
---
Scholomance = Scholo
---
Strarholm = Strat Baron for shortcut entrance, i dont remember for main entrance.
---
Maraudon = same
---
Uldaman = same
---
SFK = Ombrecroc
---
Dire Maul = HAche Tripe (HT Nord, HT Est or HT Ouest)
---
Screams in newb
---
&gt; Escaping from ganks/duels 
---
realistically, who the fuck is going to be coordinating between layers with their friends just so they can escape ganks or duels. this is a really dumb take  
---
&gt; People fading away in open world pvp 
---
that doesn't happen.  
---
&gt; No "inv me to asmon layer" in general chat 
---
realistically, this isn't going to happen. it doesn't happen in retail and it's not going to happen in classic. we see it in beta/stress tests because there's honestly not anything to do so it's fun to follow those dudes around because they at least invite people to do interesting/stupid shit. 
---
I don't know what you mean with your last two points
---
Oh, BOB SAGGETTTT!!!!
---
My hope is that Blizzard takes notice and reduces the ‚Äúwindow of opportunity‚Äù, rather than be happy with the current state of it.
---
Just be a melee hunter in classic too. I know its a meme, but its viable for solo and 5 man dungeons. Just be very careful needing on melee weapons that rogues and warriors want. Because even if you are a melee hunter very few will be ok with that and you wont be liked. But roll a melee hunter. And go ranged for raids.
---
I believe it has something to do with the players and mob level.  For instance, your 60 friend can't just walk your level 20 ass over to a level 55 zone and level you up instantly, he will suck up most of the xp.
---
Cant for most afaik.
---
I think it does work. I saw Payo do it a couple of times in his stream. He vanished just before the spell hit him causing him to "dodge" the spell.
---
I know in retail if you fd while your pet is attacking or anything like that you don't leave combat. Or if anyone attacks your pet, you have combined combat systems
---
That makes sense. If Im questing with a friend who is exactly the same level then XP should be split 50/50. Basically meaning we have to kill twice as many mobs (and loot/pick up twice as much shit for quests) right?
---
I totally agree! I‚Äôd love to see content added, but it‚Äôs a double edged sword. I wouldn‚Äôt want blizzard falling into the same mistakes that they made with retail.
---
I‚Äôm with you though, I‚Äôd love to see content added to the existing world instead of us being hit with a loading screen as we travel to some ‚Äúfar off land‚Äù.
---
The reason it takes so long is that the first Blizzard tick only puts him in combat, but doesn't do any damage or slow him. Only the *second* Blizzard tick he's affected by does damage.
---
1st case:
---
Timestamp | Event
---
---|---
---
00:09.191 | The first Blizzard tick while he's in the AoE occurs, but the tick only puts the Blizzard status effect on him (no damage or slow yet)
---
00:10.209 | The second Blizzard tick occurs, putting him in combat.
---
00:10.494 | The damage from the second Blizzard tick is dealt, delayed by spell batching for about 280 ms.
---
2nd case:
---
00:20.886 | The first Blizzard tick while he's in the AoE occurs, dealing no damage as above.
---
00:21.905 | The second Blizzard tick while he's in the AoE occurs, putting him in combat.
---
00:22.189 | The damage from the second Blizzard tick is dealt, delayed by spell batching for about 280 ms.
---
Spell batching here is working as intended, giving things a 0-400ms delay. In this case it's about 280ms in both cases, which could be because Blizzard ticks are also calculated in a routinely manner, but that's beside the point.
---
The reason the delay appears so large is that **the first Blizzard tick both times does nothing but put the Blizzard status effect on him**. It deals no damage or slow. In both cases it's the *second* Blizzard tick he gets hit by that actually slows and damages him.
---
I don't know if this is working as intended but I do remember that rogues could still sometimes get openers on mages even if they were spamming Blizzard on themselves, so I think it's just as likely to be a feature as a bug.
---
[apparently, leeway works for ranged spells too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmirWTIx8e0)
---
And yet little communities formed on english server of french, german and italian speaking.
---
Source, please?
---
Orc female 2h animation are probably the worst in the game. Its actually a big deal for me, because i like the model
---
I hope you are ironic or you need a new pair of eyes.
---
You don't *need* to, but you'll want to. There's one phase where a gun is your BIS item at 60, probably plenty of instances where a gun will significantly increase your leveling speed, and unless you immediately get the other raid BIS, you'll be using several raid guns on your way to get them.
---
Those gimmicky guilds get stale really fast. Better of just making the occasional raid of Druids only doing MC or raiding goblin cities. Nothing precludes you from pugging that.
---
This basically. You can reduce damage against your team too, disarm ,etc.
---
In my suggestion people are only layered while playing the first 20-25 levels, after that everyone is on the same "main" layer. How does that destroy community for the food chunk of leveling? 
---
The numbered servers is impractical. Some servers will be dead for weeks before they merge wrecking the community and economy. People hate server mergers.
---
Redridge and duskwood. They're both so well fleshed out and full of character. I'm also partial to teldrassil. I know everyone loves elwynn forest, but damn if the music and ambiance don't just do it for me.
---
they sometimes wont attack or they will attack and then stop and start again. sometimes they will attack but move to a random direction and sometimes they dont stop. Also sometimes you get a new demon when you summon. So it has no spells and you have to rebuy the grimoires
---
I think the only zones I'm not looking forward to is dun morogh, loch modan and maybe wetlands though wetlands has a super cool soundtrack
---
I don‚Äôt remember much of Desolace/Feralas from vanilla, not even sure if I ever played there so definitely want to try those this time around. 
---
Then of course burning steppes/searing gorge since I can remember grinding on the dark iron dwarves back in the day. 
---
Any good hidden gems to try out at certain levels?
---
What does engineering sell for profit? Never actually leveled engineering.
---
To a point, if your content is so restrictive that a large portion of your player base doesn't see it, it basically doesn't exist to them. 
---
Now, it's really about ratios. If 50% of content is only seen by 2% of players, that's an issue. I think classic is more like 10% is seen by 20%. A majority of the content in vanilla is leveling zones which anyone can see on their own given a time investment. Even most raids can be seen via pugs. Really the only content most will miss is rank 11-14 pvp rewards and naxx for awhile, but even then there will probably be some pugs for it later down the line. 
---
You could make the argument retail is just as restrictive as classic, since mythic raids, mythic plus, and arena rewards are still hidden from the majority of the player base. It just seems easier to see it since you can click a button to get there rather than actually having to take the time to find a group to get there. 
---
Just my thoughts on it.
---
Leveling in the all-druid guild was already a lot of fun. We had a blast clearing all the low level dungeons.
---
Blizzard usually fixes all of their bugs before an expansion releases. This is not a simple release though, so I doubt they'll have everything from that list sorted out come August 27th. 
---
The community also has shown that layering is a huge deal to them so I'd imagine they focus on that for now. 
---
I'm sure the remaining bugs will be fixed a week or two after release.
---
No C'thun till phase 3 my friend.
---
I started playing WoW at a younger age than that. I picked a Warrior, and since I couldn't make friends (or speak english very well), It was a traumatizing experience to say the least :P
---
In general tho, Hunters, mages and paladins (Melee, and as healing, their rotation is mostly one button) are the easiest to pilot, to my mind. They can solo easily, and not very button-intensive.
---
YES! Thank you
---
As a UD player, Silverpine Forest will always be one of my favorite zones. But as far as the look of them, I thought Ashenvale and 1K Needles/Shimmering Flats we‚Äôre really good looking.
---
&gt;can you really say that players could run through the entire area of a blizzard even after the spell was already channeling and only get slowed once they got outside of it? By that time players would already be in melee range of the mage before blizzard started to slow them. Absolutely not the way it worked back then.
---
You definitely could get over halfway into the Blizzard before the slow was applied, but it was very rare and impossible to do consistently.  Like if to entered the Blizzard 1ms after a batch tick, the slow would not apply until the next batch tick, allowing you to freely run through most of the Blizzard (latancy adding extra milliseconds of freedom too).  But since 95% of the time you weren't going to be hitting the Blizzard at that exact window, you would get slowed at the edge or 1/4th of the way in.
---
In that video it looks like Blizzard (the company) is faking spell batching for some things by just adding extra time before some spells/effects take affect.  So with that Blizzard (the spell) clip, it looks like when the player hits the edge of Blizzard, a timer is started the moment the player enters the Blizzard, but the timer is all fucked up and clearly not working right.  Maybe since improved Blizzard is a another effect, it's actually running *two* timers back to back, letting the player consistently get all the way through?
---
So yeah it's not working right, but getting most of the way through improved Blizzard in Vanilla *could* happen, it was just very rare.
---
Yes. Not as good as druids, but will do. I always had fun in BGs as prot. Premades are recommended.  Also very helpful in AV.
---
Correct, but keep in mind you should be killing mobs at roughly 2x speed.  If the quest is just "kill 10 tigers" you'll both get credit. If it's something like "loot 10 tiger claws" you'll usually have to kill twice the mobs.
---
A big part of testing is playing, though. That's how you find bugs and that's why so many bugs get through the dragnet because they might only happen 1 time in 30 different play throughs.  Dudes like the guy in the video know what they are looking for but a normal player tester is just as valuable.
---
As a long time Horde player:
---
Gnome warrior- tend to be skull-stacking murderers and if I see one I'm expecting him to take no mercy.
---
Dwarf paladin- Chill as hell.
---
NE Hunter- Gankermaster and general nuisance.
---
NE druid: usually chill
---
Tauren druid: chill
---
Tauren shaman: chill
---
Troll rogue: chill
---
It's not really necessary for Druid tbh. The other classes benefit way more from this profession and you can't use many of the items while shapeshifted.
---
Lol this. Who the hell thinks that bleak grey is unrealistic? Unless youve been born in south florida and never left, or watched any movies, or tv, ever.
---
anything and frost mage is good.
---
Good. 50% is probably just the right amount
---
I think only losing 50% of the players in the first 2 months is actually quite optimistic.
---
Lol casuals arent going to hit 60 in 2-3 weeks. Nice bait buddy, go back to your instant gratification modern client
---
&gt;casuals are going to hit 60 in 2-3 weeks
---
It takes well over 100 hours /played to reach 60 at world record pace. Playing 5 hours a day is hardly casual so that's just mathematically impossible.
---
Good. Thank you very much
---
True but you see rogues with mask too early that is why I didnt go for it
---
When vanilla was out I was very young and didn‚Äôt have the focus to push to 60 very fast. I was also playing a warrior which made it hard to level. 
---
This time around I want to get two toons to 60 in a relatively short amount of time and get involved in some good pvp like the old days.
---
Most likely will reroll to mage or rogue.
---
Eh.  I'm bi and run around in a skirt sometimes, and I think it's funny.  Moral outrage is a shitty hobby.
---
At least 50%
---
Vanilla is grindy and often boring.
---
Many will get bored in the 30s
---
I don't think it's 5-10 seconds. Mobs may respawn every 5-10 seconds because there're a few of them dying and respawning in the area. But I think every specific one is 1 minute, or maybe 30 seconds.
---
It didn't bother me at the time. We were enough people to do small dungeons and Warsong Gulch PvP. It was just that our bigger activities were organised around these silly things. 
---
It's true though that even the organised activities were more diverse than just going into Booty Bay every day, but the goblin cities is the one I remember best.
---
Threads like these is why I'm weary of using Reddit. Most subreddits are echo chambers where the users just circle jerk and massage their egos all day. There is no actual room for discussion
---
Have they tested gouge + blink, vanish + blind, skull of impending doom + polymorph and other combinations?
---
Since there is so much people in the comments that obviously have never played vanilla or no longer have any recollection and neither understand the ramifications spell batching brings to the game and the skill curve it provides.
---
[Read this.](https://www.wowhead.com/news=290910/spell-batching-in-classic-wow)
---
&gt; Blizzard has released updates regarding how Spell Batching will work in Classic WoW. Their plan is, while Classic will still be running in an altered version of the modern client, to reduce how often the game processes spells, in order to have the same experience as it happened in Vanilla, with Mages able to  Polymorph one another, Warriors able to  Charge simultaneously, among other fun interactions that caused.
---
&gt; **What is Spell Batching?**
---
&gt;For those unfamiliar, Spell Batching refers to how the WoW servers process incoming interactions. Instead of processing everything immediately, the server creates batches of actions (attacks, buffs, debuffs, etc) in order to process them all together. This is done to optimize the amount of time the server spends processing those effects. The side effect of this is that actions in the same batch are considered simultaneous and don't affect one another.
---
&gt;In the past, back when servers had less computing power than phones nowadays have, these windows could be very large, with some games having up to 200ms windows of batching, including WoW. With better technology and servers, this system was improved over the years and, while it still exists, and effects from it can still be seen, the windows are much smaller, being 20ms wide for abilities in retail WoW. This means that abilities cast within 20ms of each other are considered simultaneous in the eyes of the retail WoW servers, while this window was about 200ms during Vanilla.
---
&gt;This large window leads to very interesting interactions, as listed below, mages able to  Polymorph each other at the same time, other classes being able to break CC like  Polymorph by using self-harm effects like  Dark Rune, etc. This happened because those abilities ended up in the same batch of actions, being validated before the other happened. These effects have very important repercussions in PvP mainly, so it is important that Blizzard is keeping the large window for spell batching to preserve the Vanilla experience in Classic.
---
&gt;**Blue Post**   
---
&gt; Since we first announced World of Warcraft Classic, we‚Äôve seen questions about spell batching. While we never really eliminated spell batching in WoW, we did change how (and how often) we process batches of actions coming from players, so you‚Äôre less likely to notice that processing in today‚Äôs game. We‚Äôve been working to ensure that in WoW Classic, the gameplay of activating spells and effects will not differ from the experience of playing original WoW.
---
&gt;It was relatively common in the original game to see a warrior Pummel a mage who simultaneously and successfully Polymorphed the warrior. The mage suffered Pummel damage but no spell-school lock, because the mage didn‚Äôt get interrupted. This could seem paradoxical, but it could happen because the Pummel and Polymorph were both in the same batch, and were both valid actions at the start of the batch. For the most part, things like that don‚Äôt happen in modern WoW, but they still can. We‚Äôve made improvements to batch frequency, and the game is much more responsive than it used to be. Still, if you manage to get both a Pummel and a Polymorph into a tiny processing window in modern WoW, you‚Äôll experience the same behavior as in original WoW.
---
&gt;As with many other areas of WoW Classic, authenticity is our primary concern. It used to be the norm that combat flow and PvP balance were defined and tuned in a game where spell messages were resolved less frequently. There was a single game loop that processed all messages sent and received every server tick. Nowadays, the game processes multiple loops for messages of differing priorities. Spell casts are high priority, and have been for a long time.
---
&gt;For WoW Classic, we‚Äôre moving spell casts to a low-priority loop that will cause them to be processed at the frequency that best fits how the game actually played in version 1.12. Two mages will be able to Polymorph each other somewhat reliably, resulting in two sheep nervously pacing around at range. Two warriors will be able to Charge one another, and the end result will be both warriors standing stunned in each other‚Äôs original location.
---
&gt;We think it‚Äôll be fun to see those sorts of things happening again.
---
Paladin &lt;3 We don't have this issue :)
---
Welp, I'm off to watch some Naruto.
---
&gt;Don‚Äôt look at or listen to the rates on private servers. They‚Äôre not what‚Äôs on the classic beta.
---
Of course, but I'm trying to compare the two. I know that the mob competition on private servers is quite brutal. With 3k-sized layers and 5 minute respawn, it's going to be few times more brutal on Classic.
---
I agree with you. On top of that; lets say I'm deep in an empty cave, then suddenly layered, now enemies are around me. Cases like that would be very annoying and break the vanilla experience.
---
Saving this image, super helpful
---
Memory can be hazy. Post legit proof (like a vanilla vid) or gtfo.
---
If you look at retail over the last several years for example, any time Blizzard releases an xpac or content patch they are known to push out fixes several times a week.  Where other dev studios might make you wait 2+ weeks to see a handful of fixes, Blizzard will have already released a steady flow of them.
---
Youre aware that that people who complain on day x, arent the exact same people who are cool with certain changes on day y.
---
Youre talking to a lot of different people, with differing opinions. Dont oversimplify and it wont seem strange.
---
Im cool with graphical updates because the social and rpg elements made WoW what it was (to me), not the dated graphics. Not everyone shares my opinion.
---
Isn't it fairly trivial to get exalted with every starting faction?
---
My skin would be the purest of all cause I don't talk to anyone on retail
---
For quite a while now Blizzard has been desperately trying to appeal to everyone, whilst making changes that run counter to that idea.
---
I have no idea what the thinking was being Mythic+ not being LFG by default when it has just encouraged the current "community" to kick/not invite people for arbitrary reasons.
---
Not sure what the plan is behind the threat changes either, outside of a premade no one cares if it's harder for the tank to get threat. I'd say this is fully inline with setting expectations of threat being trivial for years then changing it for... reasons?
---
The funny thing is you then see the fanbase saying "well people asked for heroic to be made harder so they did and people complained, make up your mind people!" and you just think you realise these are different people wanting these things?
---
You're missing the fact that Classic is actually rewarding... That's what keeps people playing for years. Has nothing to do with difficulty.
---
50%?! Pish.
---
Do not expect all game and class bugs will be fixed by launch, but a good number of them will be corrected by then. 
---
Most (75-90%), class/game bugs will probably be fixed within 1-2 weeks of launch. 
---
But in the end, just don‚Äôt expect a perfect game. People don‚Äôt remember/realize, there were bugs with vanilla when TBC was released.
---
Yes on both accounts, however, if you choose to do engineering/mining as professions you can make a new gun every few levels, make your own ammo (very useful if your in a dungeon and are running low), and make a site to buff your gun every couple levels as well. The sites work on bows also if you were curious. There is also a sound mod that can be used, if you get tired of the gun noise, that will make it sound like it has a silencer. Just my $.02.
---
I‚Äôm not saying you‚Äôre wrong but the human mind can manufacture memories and 14 years is a long time. Just look at how terrible eye witness testimony is.
---
Warrior: All weapons except wands
---
Warlock: Daggers, Wands, Swords and Staves
---
Rogues: Daggers, Thrown Weapons, Swords, Maces, Fist Weapons, Guns, Bows and Crossbows (no 2H weapons)
---
Priests: Maces, Wands, Daggers and Staves
---
Paladins: Swords, Maces, Axes and Polearms
---
Mages: Swords, Wands, Daggers and Staves
---
Hunters: Unless it's a mace or a wand, it's a hunter weapon
---
Druids: Daggers, Staves, Fist Weapons, Maces and Polearms
---
Close to same here! Never played a dwarf ever in 14 years, so I guess it‚Äôs about fucking time! And priest for ultra healing experience
---
True, just look what Stardew Valley accomplished in a 1 man project. It made me pick up some coding skills and gave me a new hobby :)
---
Fuck Activision, Upay, Todd Howard and the rest. Give your money to people that care :D
---
Any place Joanas tells me to go. Stonetalon maybe
---
Go Gnomish, craft everything but World Enlarger and Ultrasafe Transporter: Gadgetzan, then drop Engineering, level it back up, and pay the 150g to switch to Goblin.
---
I don‚Äôt see why they would keep it when enough people are ready to raid
---
Very true! In the crowded zones, I find it much more efficient to grind non quest mobs than wait around for the quest ones to spawn.
---
I consider myself as a casual. I get home to 6 pm plays to 10-11 pm with smaller breaks lets say 4hours in weekdays and i play 6-7 hours on weekend nights easily. With following a guide its pretty convenient to hit 60 in 3 weeks. Of course not those who are gonna play only 1-2 times a week
---
Thanksgiving dinner table space intensive. Huuuuuuuuge.
---
Same here. Same here. Hold on tight, we‚Äòre soon there!
---
Its true, I mean look at Nost it was dead in the 1st month and didnt grow in population at all.
---
Jokes on you, I am already ugly as shit.
---
Just do dungeons with a Paladin tank or DPS. Then it won't matter.
---
A physical disk format in no way is relevant to a programming technique. Queues and batch processing still exist in 2019, and work just fine on any hardware we run them on. Fuck you're dumb.
---
Where?
---
Aside from shared loot (both being clothies), it's a fine combo. Mage combos well with anyone, though, them being food and drink dispensers as well as uber drivers
---
eeew wtf clean ur monitor
---
Pretty sure Blizzard is experimenting with spawn rates so it's hard to say. The first stress test server I was on (4) had a very fast spawn rate. I believe the intention was for each server to have different spawn/layer settings to get feedback from players, but they condensed the test down to 2 servers.
---
On both of the stress test servers I played on (4 and 15) the spawn rates were much faster than 5 minutes.
---
It might be closer to 5 minutes outside of starting areas though.
---
The reward I wanted was the pvp mounts. That's why I stopped at 11. Plus the grind to 12,13 and 14 would have been unbearable. I was raiding at the time and couldn't play the necessary amount of pvp matches to get there anyway.
---
Dwarf priest. No min/maxing, just never played a dwarf and never played healer in vanilla. So it‚Äôs settled.
---
Finally someone who sees clear.
---
I would bet no.  Have they confirmed that the issues are bugs and they're going to fix them?  I've yet to hear that about anything being fixed...  all these "problems" people bring up are by-products of the modern shit game, so get used to it.
---
Illegal Danish is best danish
---
this post is better suited on the official blizzard forums I feel
---
Oh so you work there? That‚Äôs how you know all this for a fact. Not saying you‚Äôre wrong but when you talk like you know for a fact why they make certain decisions just invalidates your whole argument.
---
Yes they will. Im a casual and i hit lvl60 in just 2 weeks just by playing after work and on weekends.
---
OP needs math lessons. The record is like 120 hours by someone who knows how and where. So it is very likely a regular person would need at least double that so 240 hrs or 10 days played. A person playing 5 hrs every single day would need 48 days to level. 
---
My guess casuals will play less than 5 hrs every single day. That is why ppl put an estimate of about 3 month to level 60. 
---
Classic is an experienced most of the current players don't like hence the drop %.
---
only 50% won't be anywhere near enough to remove layering without major disruptions

The entire world population of RP-PVP players is smaller than the number of German players and they're not even getting a realm in their own language.
---
It's time to stop thinking there's any hope for an RP-PVP realm.
---
Are other classes affected by these bugs as well? Or every class is buggy at the moment in their own way?
---
i d say depeing on class , playing solo or duo etc , you can expect to be 60 in 7-8 days of /played with some knowledge about the game.
---
considering it represents at least 170h , and a casual wouldnt take days off to play wow.
---
so lets account 3h/day on monday-friday , and 6h/day saturday/sunday , which is already a big commitmen for "casuals" .
---
it would take those people at least 6 weeks to achieve that , without the consideration of not really knowing what to do , or slow class for leveling.
---
I‚Äôm the voice of positivity
---
God forbid you people get angry that the game is still in beta testing and are calling Blizzard names for an finalized system. Stay petty reddit.
---
actually, unfortunately the melee combat reach is in fact from the center of target for a normal sized hitbox. This means that from the formula MAX(player reach + target reach + 4/3, 5) would be = to 5, 5 being 5 yds from center of target. The dead zone is effectively doubled in this case. I don't believe it's correct but I have nothing really to back it up other than all things referencing the dead zone back then were stated as 5-8 yds. Whether it was actually 5-11 yds idk but if it wasn't thats a big deal.
---
Just because you can't immediately see this(prediction) doesn't mean he's wrong, because he's most certainly correct. You must be  new here.
---
Nope look at there track record
---
they will lose more before the game is ever released
---
no fucking way am I playing world of layercraft
---
You got a raw deal unless your staying with people you like, if it‚Äôs ransoms damn I feel bad for you son. My 1br is 1500 but split with my gf so it‚Äôs a great deal
---
I definitely would not want any rpg aspects lessened, nor flying mounts added.  If there was to be new future content for Classic, it would have to be fundamentally different than Modern.  No more "new" continents that are empty after a year.  The game should always stay hard, rewarding, and deep.
---
You‚Äôre out of your mind if you think you‚Äôre hitting 60 in 3 weeks playing 4-7 hours a day. It‚Äôll take you closer to 2 months to get 60 playing at that rate.
---
Lol over my dead body I‚Äôll be out in NoVA
---
It was not 12y in vanilla. Melee were not casters
---
[Sorry for eroding your retinas but here it is](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/james-franco-first-time)
---
As a rogue/rouge, where can I pick pocket farm at 40 to save for a mount? Best spot at 60?
---
you dont have to drop it in order to respec to goblin isnt it ? there is a book you can read to reset your spec only isnt it ?
---
Yea that makes no sense, i'm honestly thinking that's more of an unintended bug but either way the node exploit is very concerning. I really like your server idea stated above, it's very similar to an MMO I have played called Black Desert Online(BDO) except they allow you to switch servers but either way that makes more sense and stays truer to the classic experience. I'm not sure why Blizzard thinks this will be the right route. I hope they comment on it soon.
---
Nice map. I'm looking forward to leveling in westfall, thousand needles, tanaris, stv
---
male Tauren
---
Same. I ONLY played as a mage in vanilla and I would bet $1k that blizzard did not work like this at all. Dudes slowed down as soon as they stepped into that AOE field. It was a pretty critical part of AOE grinding, too. AOE grinding would not be possible if mobs did not slow down inside of the AOE.
---
You realize that‚Äôs between 30-40 hours a week, or the equivalent of a full time job and is hardly a casual gaming schedule, right?
---
I played as a Retropal back then and i am NOT going to do it again.
---
UD rogue. Played one in vanilla and have maxed it in every expac.
---
retail? sounds like its just you
---
Now all we get is fucking super hero movies and remakes.
---
Classic is going to lose a lot of players but not for the reason you state. Since Classic share a subscription with BfA there could be potentially millions of players jumping in to check the game out, a lot of them won't like it and quit along the way.
---
I think that the number of players from day 1 that are still playing when phase 2 goes live is more like 10%, 50% is incredibly optimistic.
---
most casuals don't have 4 hours every day, lol.  
---
I'm guessing you live with your parents or by yourself but most people with family, work and school can't just find 4 hours every day to play games.  
---
you can't really say "oh because I can do this so can everyone else"
---
did it in tbc was fine. i never understood all the fuss about having 2 starting zones in wrath. i was on a full server in tbc and there were no queues after 2 days. i think it'd be preferable to have a shit launch to months of layering, the layering in the test was god awful 50+ people in /who in westfall i saw 2 of them during the 5 hours i was in westfall.   
---
fighting over mob tags seemed like a daunting task but once i made a group me and another guy were just talking shit and ended up leveling together for ages fighting higher level mobs for chests.   
---
people who think 'experiencing classic' is getting your quests done efficiently are in for a bit of a shock, streamers do not represent the experience well lol.
---
I was telling my husband the same thing last night (about always trying the new expansions). He was like, 'that's part of the problem though' and I said I knew that. I just keep hoping the game will go back to being fun for me, and if I don't give it a chance I won't know if I like it or not.
---
The latest BfA patch they're releasing looks like it might make improvements, but it's too little too late. I'll probably try and play it...but only because I want flying (just in case lol). I'm worried the new mobs are going to be hard for me to kill because I'm so low ilevel, but ugh. I just want the game to be good again for retail, too.
---
All of them.
---
It still has some obvious problems that have been discussed already.  For example, you hear that alliance or horde are attacking your city so you go to defend but they are nowhere to be found.
---
You never slept in those 2 weeks? Because that's what it takes in order to mathematically even have a chance of reaching lvl60 in two weeks.
---
You are not a casual player. You are a hardcore-wannabe who either isn't good enough for raid guilds or can't commit the time.
---
Casuals don't play like you.
---
What if they just release The Burning Crusade servers and continued to develop and progress Retail.
---
That's what it looks like for people who have the closed stress test access.
---
The people who only have public stress test access don't have the In Development option so WoW Classic shows as a live game with no servers online.
---
Tempted to roll a paladin. How is Ret in all honesty ? Memes aside. Is it fun? Do you have big crit moments ?
---
That will get you half way to 60. After another 3 weeks you'll ding.
---
Now that I've had some sleep, I realize I never mentioned you only need 3/5 shadow focus realistically.  You don't need to max it, that would be somewhat wasteful.
---
Yes, you do. The book only works if you relearn the profession entirely and don't currently have a specialization.
---
It was added in patch 1.10:
---
&gt; Players that unlearn Engineering or Leatherworking may now respecialize if they decide to relearn the professions.

Casuals take around 10 days played. Thats what 16 hours a day for 2 weeks. Yeah seems casual to me ;)
---
&gt; The record is like 120 hours by someone who knows how and where.
---
It's also done at a time when there is little to no competition for mobs.
---
How many realms will there be per region? What do we know about that so far?
---
Except the person who was soulstoned... but in that case, I'd always have the warlock soulstone someone who can rez.
---
The client is already there for most of us. If you don‚Äôt have it yet you‚Äôll get it for the next stress test.
---
There‚Äôs not gonna be another icon, it‚Äôs just a drop down for wow.
---
&gt; To a point, if your content is so restrictive that a large portion of your player base doesn't see it, it basically doesn't exist to them.
---
I understand what you mean, but I do think it exists as rumor, as some cool, almost secret content.  It may even be a reason to keep playing.
---
Idk if it was mentioned, but basically because Classic will be given "for free" to those playing retail and it will be a huge hype, you will have a lot of players in Classic (the "retail tourists") that are not that much interested in the game.
---
In every game you have a player fall-off, but here it will be basically doubled, since in other games everyone who starts to play consciously buys the game, pays money or invests time because they really want to play. Here huge part of them will not and will join "just to try" how it was years ago.
---
Thank you! Good luck on getting that level 40 mount.
---
If they are actually bugs, then yes they'll fix them. If it's uninformed players thinking that they're bugs just because it doesn't work like it does on whatever scummy private server they come from then no they won't fix them because they're not bugs if that's the case.
---
We don't know that since all of his records were done on brand new servers. But it is safe to assume it wasn't that busy. Another argument for the 240hrs estimate I made.
---
Are those treants?
---
I never tried switching in Vanilla. I always went Gnomish and never looked back. They always had the best toys!
---
What a troll post
---
As hyped as I am for Classic, I really hope somewhere down the line they do a BC rerelease.  People bitch and moan about the flying, but I think BC overall was the peak of WoW.
---
Maybe. I plan on tanking so I'll be chasing Thunderfury until I get it or until new content comes out
---
I see. With this method, I get access to everything from gnomish engineering still? Do I not make these two things because goblin eng can't use it?
---
Yeah but it wasn't done on a brand new server when there were no other servers. Rolling on a new server wasn't really all that interesting for most people back in 2005.
---
When I was 11 I had already beaten Chrono Trigger and Earthbound and was super hyped for FF7. I couldn't imagine my dad coming in and trying to help me with characters to choose for my party in those games.
---
I just wanna do Felwood again \^\^
---
Leveling professions and speed leveling are mutually exclusive.
---
If you're on an established server, leveling and alt, then sure, whatever.  If you don't care about leveling quickly, then sure, whatever.  If you're trying to level as quickly as possible, dicking around skinning and herbing and shit is a giant waste of time.
---
The Jumpers can help avoid the long battle rez cooldown in dungeons. And I used the seaforium to blow doors.  The repair bots can also be great in raiding.   The only other thing I recall using at 60 was some ZG plan goggles
---
Later I dropped it and just did fishing, herbalism and mining with my Druid (PvP run speed gear) to supply other toons and make money
---
If you enjoy auto attacking and using Judgment, Ret is for you.
---
Correct.
---
I don't think pets eat conjured food.
---
Best thing you can do as a hunter is just pick up fishing and feed the fish to your pet.
---
Hunter pet does way more damage then voidwalker and since agro is based on damage hunter pet hold agro much better. 
---
Even a fully talented voidwalker sucks and you need to find a good spot of when to DPS in order for home to hold the mob
---
No i dont think so, they will roll out the game. You can say that the beta is the release gameplay.
---
I am not sure what you argument is. Are you saying my estimate is incorrect or .....?
---
Please fuck off with that rainbow propaganda shit.
---
Lol, so Blizzard are selling us non-static respawns *and* layering?
---
&gt; i was on a full server in tbc and there were no queues after 2 days.  
---
well hey, if you're fine with waiting to play classic 2 days after launch then be my guest. i'm not.
---
&gt;  the layering in the test was god awful 50+ people in /who in westfall i saw 2 of them during the 5 hours i was in westfall. 
---
sorry to say this but the beta is peaking at 560 players between levels 1 to 40 (both factions total, not each)  
---
that's 250 players on alliance on roughly 18 zones between levels 1 and 40 leaving on average 13 players in each. that's assuming an equal amount of people on all levels. you're not even experiencing layering because there aren't even enough people online. the reason you're not seeing anyone in westfall, stormwind, ironforge, ogrimmar, dun morogh, etc. is because the beta is dead.   
---
&gt; people who think 'experiencing classic' is getting your quests done efficiently are in for a bit of a shock, streamers do not represent the experience well lol. 
---
nobody is making this argument
---
Loch Modan. God, I loved that place. That‚Äôs vanilla for me ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Im not in the beta but ive heard leeway also applies to short range spells like frost nova
---
If they retrace their old steps, I think they will end up making the same mistakes.  If they were to reintroduce BC or Wrath, personally I would want it to be fundamentally different- built entirely new from the ground up and having no similarity to those original expansions.  The important thing is that any expansions are kept fundamentally Classic in design.
---
How do you define what ‚Äòobjectively is one of the greatest games to ever be released‚Äô ? 
---
In my opinion Warcraft 3 is one of the greatest games to ever be released because of how many games it spawned afterwards that later became huge, plus it was an amazing game on its own. 
---
Though I‚Äôm sure a lot of people would disagree, I‚Äôm not too sure you can say it‚Äôs a fact when it‚Äôs still a rather subjective thing. üòÑ
---
So, it seems to be common believe (and common trend, really) that video games have a LARGE influx of players in the begning and after maybe a month or less the player base essentially gets cut in half.  We've seen this ever since... Cataclysm? So what happens if Bizzard opens up more servers and spreads the palyer base so thin that on launch layering is not needed? Well.... once the hype dies down (Just like with the beta) a lot of those servers that were created would be significantly emptier, maybe even to the point where some don't want to play anymore. because it takes 45-60 minutes to get a dungeon group, or over an hour for a bg queue. They've done free transfers before in similar situations BUT they were transfers to the dying server. Layering is only the lesser of two evils. I'm not trying to be a fuck here, but if you don't like it then you can roll on a classic server with your friends.
---
1.5m is still very low from its previous highs and is very indicative of its shrinking base the fact that blizzard refuses to share sub numbers and related revenue even with it's investors means Blizz isnt proud of them. also I don't think assuming BFA revenue will "always" be higher is wise. classic and retail will share a subscription the player base however will only overlap to certain degree and because there are no pre-order statistics we cant predict how many will be logging in in August. We do know however that Classic will have about 2 or more years worth of content before phase 6 is at an end. That is massive players know exactly what content to expect and rough guideline as to how long it will last,  whether Blizz decides to extend classic into TBC or create original content is pure speculation and no one can predict that popularity. We also can't predict if BFA will retain its current subs or bring back subs. We also don't know what the longevity of retail is as it seems a lot of major plot points in the big story are beginning to get resolved. In short only Blizz will definitively know(based off which game has more active and exclusive player) whether classic&gt;retail and even if they decided to release revenue info in some way they likely would be vague as to not suggest which version of the game is more popular. As an investor I don't want to see retail completely fail. As a soon to be player I wish my sub didn't support retail, my $0.02
---
Hi guys, all of the guides for warriors advises me to be even level or higher than the mob im fighting. Is this only possible by grinding for a few hours between quests?
---
hi, the link is not working anymore, could you probably provide a new one? thanks!
---
Can't use consumables while shapeshifted, including stuff like grenades.
---
You must not have played on pservers because retail was bashed in /5 and /2  alllllllll the time.
---
&gt;  I also have an IRL group to play with, so wipes aren't really a thing
---
Then dungeons are fine for you.  I believe I literally addressed that in my other post.
---
&gt; (unless you have a solid group you can trust not to wipe).
---
Yep, I did.  If you *don't* have a group, pugging dungeons while leveling is a giant risk to your overall efficiency.  The rewards/experience are worth it, but not if you're going to wipe.  If you have a decent group, get in there, if you don't, I'd avoid it.  Now, if you aren't concerned with speed/efficiency, get in there!  Its never bad to go do that dungeon quest or try to get that loot if you aren't concerned about speed and just want to have fun.
---
Probably more.
---
No not at all. I'm just saying that the record was made under optimal conditions where there were very few people leveling and no lvl60s to gank you. 
---
120 hours should be virtually impossible at launch unless you're ahead of the pack and can play 15+ hours each day.
---
Cloth, Leather, and lower hp dudes I go with Ambush. There's no better feeling in roguing then getting a huge ambush crit. If they're not expecting you it will take them a few seconds to react so you can throw in a backstab and an eviscerate.
---
For warriors I use garrote. Sometimes for other rogues too to keep them from restealthing. I don't really use cheap shot unless it's group pvp.
---
If you take a person from each european country and make them communicate, what else are they going to use if not english
---
I think it is not the druid but the race. Both night elves and Tauren just feel weird paired with engineering. Imagine a wargen or a dwarf druid and all of a sudden engineering feels ok.
---
Thank you for providing the list. I just wanted to mention that Druids can't wield polearms until TBC.
---
I actually havent found anyone who never made it to at least an ulduar 10 man and raided at the time. The 5 man dungeons that were attached were also solid. Actually, most of the 5 man dungeons were solid that expansion. At least half the areas were extremely well done as well.
---
Wrath did a bunch of things right. Arthas‚Äôs story, on the other hand, was never that good, it had always been told in a slightly ham fisted way, and it was in a product that did well for a video game at the time. Which is to say that WoW crushed the base game on number of players, to say nothing of its expansion.
---
I'd say testing, it is a beta. Exploiting would be at game launch.
---
Naw, I'd still be ugly.
---
Agreed.
---
Thank you for informing me, what a shame!   
---
 I agree about resource waste -- however,  that's another great point in case of an RP-PvP realm. Automate the process as they are going to anyway, less tickets about grief on a PvP realm if there were less 'RPer's on my lawn'   
---
My thought: Give the players an RP-PvP realm
---
I dont think I am. Everyone should consider their moment to moment gameplay in every activity they want to participate in. Warlock, for example, feels very different leveling and in open world than it does in raid.
---
&gt; would you like to see a new original expansion for it? 
---
Nah, it would cause the actual Classic content to become obsolete and/or devoid of players doing it, because people naturally migrate to the new stuff.
---
Its true enough though. I dont care much about min maxing, but I'm sure as hell dropping early enchanting and taking leveling as tailor/skinning. Will get my mats from kills and sell what I can.

---
Can confirm -- this is not Kansas.
---
If you‚Äôre a warlock or paladin though...
---
as Oblivio summed up, since you kill mobs 2x as fast, the exp/h tends to even out. Some classes (hunters, warlocks) can push more exp/h, but not by that much, especially by less knowledgable players.
---
One thing I'd like to mention is, if playing on a PvP server, questing in a party gives you a layer of protection against gankers, such as rogues, thus indirectly increasing your leveling speed since you die less often to enemy players.
---
Plus it's more fun anyway, so an exp point or two shouldn't outweight that

I'll consider your opinion!

It‚Äôs small, your acquaintance group is distorting your perspective.
---
There will never be peace between these two communities. Retail only players will always want Classic to be a side game with their game being the #1 priority - and Classic only players will eventually be looking for BC or a hard reboot of the series with the Classic ruleset. Historically, retail players have been enormously insecure even about the idea of Classic and spent years attacking the suggestion everywhere it popped up. For now they have rationalized that Classic will be a tiny side game to cover content droughts. If that proves to be wrong and the population starts to equalize you better believe there is going to be an all out war for the future of WoW.
---
These are two completely different games now that play differently and have different, contradicting philosophies - that are serviced by the same team from the same pool of resources. This setup alone virtually guarantees conflict between these two communities.
---
It's a free game. You can do what you wish. My only question is would you be able to resist when a blue gun 3 times better than what you have drops. Or an epic one .... Would you maintain your character image?
---
It's funny that layering is supposed to solve the issue of overcrowded starting areas, yet it, like, doesn't solve it.
---
But ye would be even less playable without it.
---
Just loot everything, AH white items and above, sell greys, prioritize the expensive quest item to sell if you arent using the rewards. Get herb and skinning. GG.

I can‚Äôt speak for Horde quests, but I have tested nearly every single Alliance quest up through level 30 in the Beta while updating my quest completionist guide (https://shadowpanther.net/questing.htm). Only four Alliance quests in the level 1-10 range gave spillover rep to the other three factions. After that, most Alliance faction quests have given 25% spillover rep with a few exceptions. Occasionally I‚Äôve found Alliance quests that give no rep at all and very rarely a quest that gave full rep to all four factions.
---
Having said that, rep totals are lower than what is found on private servers, so even while completing every single quest to get maximum spillover, reaching exalted by 40, or even 60, may not be possible. I‚Äôm currently level 34, having just hit revered with Stormwind and Darnassus, and I‚Äôm about halfway through honored with the other two.
---
Mediocre duo. I mean, you probably won't die (you have a pet to pull aggro off of the mage if you overpull, mage can focus on slowing mobs so that the hunter can kite them), and you won't share gear. Those are two positives. I had no idea you could feed conjured bread to bread-eating pets, but that's a useful thing; you won't have to stop and fish or hit up animals for meat to feed the pet with.
---
I don't think there are any real downsides to playing these two together. At launch I'm betting most aoe spots will be camped anyway so it's not like the mage can aoe grind and have you hold them back. If one of you has alchemy that might be useful (as neither class has a self-heal)?
---
(I mean, they don't have \~synergy\~ but they're also not holding each other back. One time in BC my sister and I decided to level alts together, and we ended up leveling a fire mage and a prot warrior together and let's just say that their synergy was straight up \*bad.\* Hunter and frost mage? Not great, but definitely not that level of bad, either.)
---
&gt; You can get to 100g easily if you plan for it, and be disciplined in your spending.
---
Discipline?  Well that excludes 95% of the playerbase.
---
Yeah he has no idea.
---
Its probably cuz druids dont seem like the type of class that needs to play to extreme advantages like rogues do with cheapshot, blind, sap etc.
---
A druid can do fine without engineering but a rogue basically ups their advantages even more with the profession.
---
&gt; It is crucial to the way vanilla felt though
---
It really fucking isn't though, is it? You know what I loved in vanilla? The world, the overall classes (despite flaws), the dungeons, the raids, the pvp, the bgs, the *pace* of the game.. I couldn't give less of a fuck about simulating lag to be some sort of "accurate" to the time. I don't want an artificially fucked up game for the 5 autists who can't cope with improvements to the back end.
---
It's the gameplay that counts which Classic has in spades. Tech moved on, the client moved with it, why are we fucking up so much shit just to pretend it's 2004? What's the point?

BFA has already made more revenue than Classic ever will.

It made ~$170 million in day-one sales alone, not including any new subscribers or microtransactions.

That's 11.3 million NEW subscriber months Classic needs to compare, which is just not going to happen

---
As much as people talk about how Vanilla raiding was easier the whole endgame left you with more to do over an extended period of time and no efforts were made by the devs to cheapen the work you had put in.
---
Not to mention with the loss of sense of community you rarely feel like you are working towards combined goals and instead are just in it for yourself.
---
You can get a new character to a higher item level in two weeks(ilvl 385-390) than the main you raided for months in the previous tier(372). If that wasn't bad enough you get a lot of the gear from things like warfronts and invasions which are incredibly hard to fail.
---
In other words you can either have a continuous goal to work towards, including bettering your fellow guild members, or you can play in a system where spending ages farming the best of everything has a neglible benefit and will be wiped out within the first month of the next tier anyway.
---
&gt; It's a great gun for hunters.
---
That doesn't really matter, most guilds won't give it to you over giving it to a warrior when you get Rhok from the same raid even if it is much later, it really depends on how they roll out the phases but good luck snagging one I guess.
---
Ofc it will impact normal gameplay. And getting dropped during flights and mobs and nodes disappearing is because of people exploiting is it?
---
Do not level professions (excluding first aid and cooking) until you are level 60. It is a complete gold sink and you will not be able to maximize your profit until you are 60. Save that gold!
---
Inn or meeting stone would be the right answer.
---
The fact you keep coming back to toss insults because someone disagrees with you really shows how desperate you are.

Yeah, because automating a harassment reporting policy has NEVER been abused by players. /s

Just no.

In that video it takes 1.6 seconds for the rogue to get unstealthed after he casts Blizzard. I honestly don't remember if Blizzard is supposed to tick the second you cast it or only after 1 second after channeling (I *think* the first tick is the second you cast it, though), but if it is the second you cast it then I think this is evidence that the behaviour in OP's video is working as intended.
---
Assuming it ticks the moment you cast it, the timeline would be approximately something like this:
---
03:27.840 | Blizzard cast initiated, approximate time of 1st Blizzard tick, which only puts the Blizzard status effect on the rogue.
---
03:28.840 | Approximate time of 2nd Blizzard tick.

03:29.475 | Rogue is unstealthed after taking damage from 2nd Blizzard tick.
---
Considering all the netlag involved, this is *plausible*.
---
As for why the 1st Blizzard tick would be ignored, my theory is that it's a hackfix to stop it from ticking 9 times. It's a channel for 8 seconds that is supposed to tick 8 times. The way this is achieved is by making it tick 9 times, at 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 7, 8 seconds, but the 1st tick a unit is affected by just puts the Blizzard status effect on them, but doesn't deal any damage. This way a unit can't be hit by more than 8 ticks.
---
Well, Mark Kern mentioned that there was always a dynamic respawn system in the game, but I don't think it ever got quite at the levels that were present on the stress test. Who knows what we'll end up with in August though.
---
You should elaborate on the bugs. How are we supposed to answer your question without knowing what the bugs are?
---
Make it the meeting stone instead.
---
It provides some challenge way sooner than WoW, are you kidding?
---
Now, I'm not saying the dungeon bosses are Wildstar level difficulty or anything,but to think that ESO is training wheels *compared to current WoW* is ludicrous.  And the PvE feels more interesting than GW2, which has a similar 2-weapon style combat,but lets you customize every ability on those two bars, as well as has the 2 mouse attacks, blocks, and interrupts.
---
Maybe you just didn't get past level 5 or 10?  Because WoW is the *most* newbie friendly MMO there is.  If you're trying to flex thinking you're more of an MMO no-lifer than me, you better know what you're getting into.  DAOC popped my cherry.
---
Thirty hours on launch... I was just joking the other day with someone that I'll be half asleep within hours of the game launching because I usually go to bed early and get up early. I took off Tues-Friday for the ultimate fun vacation, but I won't get out of work on Monday until it's almost time to start playing, so no nap for me!
---
Maybe I'll have to time it so that I can come home and nap first... I'd really like to play for a long time right away, though not 30 hours.
---
I never levelled a horde toon in vanilla wow days.
---
So... Time to figure out this Barrens hype.
---
(4√ó5+2√ó6.5)√ó3=99
---
99&lt;100 so no, you won't be hitting 60 in 3 weeks.
---
i got beta access to every blizzard beta over the last 10 years but never used em cus I figured i'd play the complete game, now i am paying the provide for my indolence.
---
So a month or two ago I was reading posts about people recovering their old characters from when they stopped playing and I tired it myself.  All that excitement died when I found my rogue and realized I used those services to change my first characters name and race...  I don‚Äôt know when those services came available but I‚Äôm guessing to used them to try and spark interest in continuing to play...  oh well, I f‚Äôed myself
---
BC just had such an incredible way of progressing gear that actually took some time and I loved it. It also didn‚Äôt have dungeon finder so things like flying mounts actually had a use. Flying mounts now just feel like novelty and aren‚Äôt nearly as rewarding.
---
I mained a NE hunter all through vanilla and TBC and never once used a gun.
---
Honestly just skipping the bullshit skill ranks that don't apply to your leveling spec will save you a ton of gold towards your first mount.  Worry about that junk at 60.
---
I wouldn't call that "rote memorization from private servers" and more "I distinctly remember making that mistake on my first character and never made it again".
---
That'd be great, except the only plausible reason 20% of the EU playerbase isn't getting their own German server is because there aren't going to be that many servers.
---
2 PVP, 2 PVE, and 1RP realms. What languages get what servers?
---
Let me buy you ten thousand golds
---
assuming 3.000.000 players at launch (probably more), reddit makes up 3-4% of the total community. you're better off writing a really good post on the blizzard forums and hoping people keep it alive
---
Dont take my word for it, but i belive you should always kite kill stuff anywhere you go for max efficiency. Also grind atlest 1 level everytime you are "done" with a zone.
---
But yes grinding mobs is the way to go, and do dungeons only if you have quests to do so or if you really need the gear as dungeons themself dont give any xp besides from kills.
---
Opening day is August 27th and Classic WoW is already in the Launcher (possibly only if you signed up for beta). They used the Live Client for the most recent stress test as they were testing exact launch conditions. You click the little dropdown arrow under "Version" in the "World of Warcraft" tab. It's right above the Play button. There you will see WoW Classic and WoW. August 12th is my personal bet date on when it'll show up for everybody IF it only shows up for beta people right now. That is because August 13th is when they'll open the game up and allow people to create up to 3 characters to reserve your names, you just won't be able to log onto the character until August 27th.
---
I took off work (nothing else to spend my vacation on) so I'd like to get ahead of the pack quickly and keep on keeping on. I have issues with focusing for super long play sessions these days, though, so hopefully I can drink some caffeine and just power through it. I'd dearly like to play at non-peak hours to maximize efficiency while leveling, too.
---
Hahahahahaha
---
So after the Server Lists u say one of the pvp Servers will be a RP-PVP Server and post it here,Facebook,official Forums so hopefully alot Players will join this Server who want also Play rp pvp? Like an unofficial RP pvp Server?
---
PSA: I just got into the Beta this morning and have not had a WoW sub since 2010.

Well, hunter feels like the worst case of all but, honestly, it is the class with the most reliance on certain timings and mechanics. Deadzone is key, FD-trap or FD-trinket swap are bread and butter, kiting and pulling are affected as well...  
---
Locks suffer from the pet issues as well, melee are affected by the deadzone and leeway issues while having their own bugs (mostly animations, sounds and/or unintended effects due to post-vanilla changes to skills) but their current experience is not so bad since most of their basic stuff is alright. 
---
I'm also considering rolling hunter but it feels I'll wait a bit to see how polished it is on release. They have a lot of work to do.
---
The thing that messed up is technology advanced and they dont need spell batching anymore. People cried cause they liked buggy pvp and we get a half-cocked solution like this one.
---
Orc Shaman, looking forward to Mulgore, 1k needles, and Hinterlands.
---
Dreading Ashenvale though. The zone, all that running and quests put me to sleep.
---
Thoughts and prayers to you my friend.
---
it certainly was for the launch yesterday
---
I imagine it would be a great combo, and great aoe farm potential later levels, blizzard nova arcane explosion shadowword pain holy nova?
---
Inaccessible endgame content is a huge subconscious motivator. Think of Naxx like a lvl 40 mount. When i was lvl 9 back in 2004 I saw a lvl 43 riding a giant cat and I was like holy shit I want that. It motivated me to keep playing. Seeing better things that you know you might not ever get both legitimizes the game as well as motivates you to keep playing and that the game 'matters' enough to keep playing. It's moot at this point though since everybody knows the content. The wonders of the era before web databases were prolific are over. Now people can look up every single facet of a game instantly unless it's like under a week old.
---
Pm it please
---
The best thing to do is to let him pick the one that sounds the coolest. Kids have a great knack for picking things up easily, and there's no point in him having an "easy" class if he doesn't end up enjoying the class fantasy.
---
I started with Druid at 8 years old, arguably one of the more complex classes in vanilla and didn't end up struggling at all.
---
Warlock epic mount quest was pretty dope. Had to do a boss in Dire Maul.
---
üôèüèª
---
By time gated he meant naxx released and TBC was just around the corner.
---
Male undead, no doubt there.
---
I would love to see batching gone and leeway nerfed.  I appreciate that they are trying for the authentic feel but don't make the game worse to accommodate for outdated mechanics because of slow internet speeds 10 years ago.
---
Battlefront 2 looks great and plays like a generic shooter. Completely different from what Battlefront was originally about.
---
I played ret and did pvp but we had a group of friends, about 5 of us, and that can definitely change the dynamic of your day to day life - especially in pvp. Seal of command is fun. Very proc based but I always found it very satisfying. Just avoid Shamans. Purge is a b*tch! :P
---
I didn't say they should adjust it. I was just laughing that it's actually worse. Which is funny because it's not exactly amazing on PS. Pretty sure my sarcastic comment about the MIGHT of feral dps should have clued you in.
---
Making wild assumptions about what people are saying but not actually reading their posts. 1/10 /r/classicwow logic.
---
It is a great leveling duo, but if you know how to aoe pull you should spec into holy nova and aoe mobs down, only 2 mages can level faster then this comp. Level enchanting on one char and make low wands for both of you which deal more damage then any of your spells
---
No shit retard, this is patched together system blizz is putting into appease rogue pvpers
---
Finally settled on Night Elf Druid!!! Best heals coming to a dungeon near you!
---
Do you live in an alternate reality?
---
I dont think that would be an issue really, as mentioned some dps or tank classes might have rez, pala priest.
---
If the group is good wiping doesnt have to be a thing. And ye, its only a corpserun...
---
He means Retail Classic as opposed to Pserver Classic
---
I'm curious when or if people will ever realize that stereotyping and perpetuating a flame war like this is not doing the Classic communication any favours. There are those that play modern WoW and enjoy it, without bashing on Classic. There are of course people that will claim it's rose tinted as well.  The exact same can be said for Vanilla fans, both those that can find fun in Vanilla and bash Modern, and those that feel the need to display how 'hardcore' they are by bashing others.  
---
Quite frankly, you should be happy you got it, and just let people do as they choose without judgement.  
---
All this vanilla good and live wow bad circle jerk just makes the community look obnoxious and resembling every bad stereotype.
---
&gt; Fuck the naysayers. After all shit the classic community had to take over the years it's justified to give the retards a jab once or twice.
---
Oh no, how did you manage it? People on the internet disagreeing with you? That's tough. Especially when the Private Server community was such a bastion for civility and perspective, unlike those entitled retail players.
---
Your "1.12" video is from a private server. Discard.
---
Flask is a required by raid leader passed AQ, engineering is not. There is a bigger benefit from a flask with almost every classes what you are talking about. Using a flask does not use the universal cooldown or casting time. It's a straight up bonus. Engineering does not scale. Engineering is hugely more expensive, it is by far the most expensive profession. If you need it in any situation your doing something wrong. The only class that really benefit from it is the warrior. You do what you want but you probably never played vanilla if you think that min-max mentality is what wow is about. Wow is just a big grind fest. Your going to be disappointed if you think your going to win a fight with your grenades and your helmet. It might be good on a twink but you want a real helm and a real pair of boots, your hurting too much with two slots. Grenades vs potion I choose potions everytime. A faster run speed boots or potion of swiftness? A 200dmg grenade or a 2000 healing potion? Streamers who are engineering you see them farm? You don't think it's wierd that they have unlimited potions AND grenades and the best crafted gear? They buying huge amount of gold to min max and never have to farm. My choice is simple, potions and permanent bonus like devilsaur armor and good enchants. You won't be able to have it all. Make your choice and if it's engineering it's probably your only gold sink.
---
this is why i loved the game during Wotlk each class was good and uniq and no longer we had standing and watching white swings for most melee classes without much interaction.
---
yep, the "normal" leeway is functional while stationary- if you walk away after coming into melee range you can see it- but if you blink after coming into melee range or have 100% speed the auto won't go off because you're more than 2.66 yards away by the time the swing would go off.
---
Just don't put gear in rep vendors. Simple.
---
Can you do DME jump runs with a warlock and a healer?
---
Everyone was a retail fanboy at one point
---
Me and a bunch of my friends are very hyped about Classic but I‚Äôm quite confident when I say I‚Äôm expecting 90% of them to have quit in a month or 2. The game is tedious and very slow paced so you really have to like it for what it is and not for nostalgic reasons which all of my friends are doing. They don‚Äôt really know what they are getting into they all just reminisce about the good old times. A lot of them haven‚Äôt played a game like classic or just a mmo in general in many many years and that game is much different from LoL, CS, and PUBG that most of them play today. 
---
And if they quit I‚Äôm not too sure I can keep myself interested enough. I feel like any iteration of WoW is quite boring to play if you have no one to play it with, and on the other hand it‚Äôs amazingly fun IF you have people to play with, yes even BFA. 
---
I‚Äôm assuming I‚Äôm not alone on this, so I‚Äôm expecting a lot of people to quit, because it isn‚Äôt really the same as back then. I played a little nostalrius when it launched and I was very surprised how everything was, and I think a lot of others will be as well.
---
Besides Classic has generated a shit ton of hype so naturally a lot of people are going to try it and a lot of them will dislike it and quit and a lot will like it and stay.
---
A list would be great and the idea about using the first letter in the name makes claiming a server easier.
---
I'll roll a Rogue cuz of all this shit. For me at least, 50% of the reason to play a Huntard is because of all the QoL things. Having to wrestle pet ai and a bugged autoshot kinda crapped on that, and now to top it off warriors can slow me from conc. shot distance. 
---
What's the point in rolling one?
---
Well yeah, but Tauren can mel;ee from 9.66 yards on beta which gave you a .33 yard "deadzone" while moving to hit arcane explosion without getting meleed which, quite frankly, is ridiculous.
---
How are you disappointed, it plays so similar it‚Äôs uncanny. Did you play the stress test?
---
Well yeah when you can make a single enemy trash encounter 30 seconds long and each area requires 15 or so of these 30 second long encounters it can be quite easy to pad things out.
---
Compare say Destiny with WoW, a quest mob in WoW at the appropriate level will take quite awhile to kill whereas in Destiny it can be instantly killed by a headshot. The pacing is completely different so even if they had the same amount of content (which they dont, WoW has significantly more) the pace at which you go through it in Destiny is much faster.
---
Vanilla had batching. Blizzard broke stealth instantly in vanilla. Stop blaming batching for everything.
---
We need a working warcractmovies kind of website.
---
reee
---
I think Blizzard has made it abit confusing to what problem layering is suppose to solve. 
---
This guy made a pretty good video on it: [https://youtu.be/VhR7DYS0MFY](https://youtu.be/VhR7DYS0MFY)
---
I thought we were playing the patch where the skill is expensive and mount is cheap?
---
So you would save only 10g on mount but 100g on the skill? Or is i mistaken? If im right all the mounts will be 100g and 90 if you rep up.
---
I support this message.
---
Thanks for detailed response, much appreciated!
---
Smirks with wallet out
---
I've played WoW every expansion, and until Blizz announced Classic WoW, I never heard anyone on retail talk negatively about Classic, or even bring it up at all really. I can't believe some people in this community actually have a victim complex and are calling other people insecure... unreal.
---
Their damage isn't exactly considered "good" on PS. I don't care I won't be playing a druid. I was laughing about a bad spec actually being even worse. 
---
What Hyjal Raid are you talking about?
---
While I agree, modern WoW has its achievements in ways Classic didn't have. It's a vastly different game of course, but mythic raiding is definitely something to be proud of, despite the picture of it being easy mode. As a 15 year raider, I'd say the greatest difficulty of vanilla/TBC raiding was logistics and personnel. The mechanics themselves weren't on the same level. Not to say they were bad, absolutely not.  
---
At the end of the day, the games are wildly different now, and both have merits. Modern WoW players have pride and achievement all their own and it's just as relevant as Classic players and their achievements, no matter the path to get there.
---
Whats the point of this thread?
---
Daily quests weren't used for leveling.
---
Yeah it's hard knowing what to choose. For example I have always been a bit of a lone wolf in games. This time I want to really try and be very social. A PvP server is going to be better for that. You end up in more situations were you have to work together and get to know people. A PvE server I could see people just doing their own thing to a much larger degree. Also I plan to roll a warrior which is a sitting duck pretty much when leveling.
---
 Still I don't want to level on a "boring" server. As much as I hate being ganked, it adds a lot when you have to sneak around and hide, keeping a lookout etc, plus the community thing I mentioned earlier of course.
---
I really like Loch moden. However I'm gunna skip it this time round and head to west fall to level with my bros. And of course to get that defias mask for my dwarf badass
---
He is definitely doing g a really going a good job doing g a going doing going
---
What a garbage argument. "It wasn't important to me so what's your point?" 
---
The dude just gave you the point. It's because it's useful in PvP. This is beta, this is a bug. No one is saying release the system like this, we all agree not to have a system this fucked up. Who are you even debating?
---
I understood that reference.
---
I pretty much only played alliance up until wrathb before switching to horde, so I'm looking forward to all the classic horde leveling, Barrens, maybe Ashenvale, I don't really know tbh!
---
I guess you never tried asking for legacy servers or saw any of the hundreds of threads over the last decade.
---
To have a 60 and actually make time to both raid AND make twinks.
---
Personally I'm just glad it'll be one sub granting access to both because I like the two games in different ways
---
No...the genre killed itself when tried to REPLICATE the best MMORPG ever created (Vanilla WoW) instead of using their brains and come up with something different.
---
Repost, this sub has become a pretty low effort karma farm
---
There's a reason they haven't come out and added melee leeway to the "not a bug" list.
---
The thing you think it melee leeway is not actually melee leeway. Vanilla had a lag compensation mechanic for melee and ranged, but the melee range padding we see is NOT melee leeway- that's why it isn't ok.
---
This has little to do with the point above: That this is a simulation of the original system that behaves differently as opposed to an implementation that behaves the same as 15 years ago.
---
Your link merely states they want authentic spell batching.
---
The mage can go fire for more damage so you could kill stuff fast but the mage will have a lot more downtime drinking.
---
Regardless of how good the game is, way more people will play it at launch than a few months down the line. That's just how game releases work these days. They need measures to account for that.
---
&gt; Flask is a required by raid leader passed AQ
---
And engineering is required from MC and onward.
---
&gt; The only class that really benefit from it is the warrior. 
---
Okay you have no fucking idea about what you're talking about.
---
&gt;  200dmg grenade or a 2000 healing potion?
---
Imagine being so sure of yourself, yet not knowing that grenades don't share cd with healing potions.
---
&gt; You don't think it's wierd that they have unlimited potions AND grenades and the best crafted gear? 
---
No, because making money in games is easy if you have any idea what you're doing.
---
I had no idea what I was doing when I first played but I loved those deviant fish so I got stacks of them.  I then realized near level 40, they were with almost 1g each so mount money was easy.  That was always my advice for those who struggled with mount money.
---
I had original Vanilla beta, then I never got into another one until Legion, which infuriated me every expansion because I was a giant no lifer from Vanilla through MoP and goddamnit I'm literally an unpaid game tester for you fuckers who had endless hours of free time and yet you scorn me like this?
---
So much salt back then, I still am surrounded by pillars of it.
---
Going to say you're in an echo chamber friend. In all my years, I've never heard anything but good memories and wishes to return to the older times. Listening to the loud minority or the morons in the wowservers subreddit will always result in this. There can be peace when people stop spreading this hate mongering crap. There are always naysayers on both sides, but you could choose to not be part of that group.
---
There are some that won't shut down .
---
Their damage is godtier, its highest besides the good classes.
---
Also the battle for mount hyjal where you kill illidan in the caverns of time. It was in 1.12.9 bc pre pre post patch
---
Can‚Äôt get above 40 in beta yet, so population surveys there are skewed. 
---
Cap at 40 means that warriors are only barely getting better armor than shamans at the cap. Ten levels later shamans have a very tough time tanking. Right now they great compared to other classes. That will change.
---
Why the hell are people in this thread constantly repeating each other and getting upset about Blizzard "simulating spell batching" and using that as an excuse for it being bad. What does that even mean? It's literally just programming code for how many intervals before the game sends data. What do you think it is in Classic? Just because it isn't necessary for it's original purpose doesn't mean they're using magic to replicate it.
---
This is the 'recommended' macro for using a wand:
---
 `/castsequence !Shoot, !Shoot` 
---
I can't understand why this isn't EXACTLY the same:
---
`/cast !Shoot`
---
When I try them, the castsequence version keeps shooting no matter how many times I tap the assigned macro key. If I use the cast version, tapping quickly causes wanding to start then stop. This is confusing as that's the whole point of "!" I realize this is a low level question but there is clearly something important and interesting happening with /castsequence that I don't understand...
---
Because some people had no idea what they were actually asking for, and what they actually meant by #NoChanges was #NostChanges.
---
You can play the way you want to, destruction specc is not about dots at all. You have immolate but thats it. Ofc you can still dot but its not needed.
---
It will play similar to a firemage.
---
That map is incorrect.  Scarlet monastery starts at \~30.  GY wing mobs are 5-7 levels lower than cathedral.
---
OR you can have a friend/twink be a goblin engineer and still benefit from the tanaris port which IMO is more usefull than everlook  (easy AQ+noggenfogger access vs easier juju farm). 
---
But otherwise going from gnome to end up with goblin is definitly better than the other way around, since goblin engineer is the only one with consumables (zappers /mortar, rocket boots) while gnome only has trinkets that you will keep forever after crafting.
---
I'm so very sorry, honestly I didn't even realize
---
Haven't heard that even  once.
---
Lol. Oh right the illidan pre patch. How could I forget
---
I guess is modern water tech and not the classic water
---
Sounds unlikely to me that they will have that few, I think the reason for no language specific servers is to save money some other way. Maybe so people don't send tickets in German or something stupid like that.
---
If you have a heal, then cast it.
---
Lol this is great
---
Wow, what a nice and detailed map, I love it. Definitely will save it
---
You're talking about a tiny percentage of the overall discussion. And mostly only recently.  Not to mention that the classic community was one of the most toxic and entitled groups of people I have ever seen in online gaming as soon as Classic was announced and Blizzard was looking for feedback. 
---
Anyone who had any thoughts or ideas that wasn't #NOCHANGES was berated by a bunch of entitled private server players. Those people were a big part of why I never got more invested in Private servers even though I played them. They just couldn't stop talking about how easy retail was and how much better and harder Vanilla is. Its hilarious for people to pretend like it's just the retail players who are toxic and that somehow the Classic community is a victim.
---
What's wrong with layering as long as you restrict all characters over a certain level to the same layer? Sure there will be shenanigans at low level, but let's say at 20 all will be in one layer and can't switch.
---
So true
---
The same might happen to Classic after a year or two if it never gets more content.  It's entirely probable that Classic was always intended to be just a one-off place to satisfy the community's demand for the vanilla game.  There's been no indication to the contrary.  I'm just theorizing a what-if scenario to keep the core depth of Classic alive into the future.
---
And they all have tiny populations / bad scripting / pay2win / etc, and they'll still be just as irrelevant when Classic comes out.
---
Nothing really.
---
Maybe.
---
Then layered Classic launch will have not 2 but 12 times harder mob competition :)
---
I agree it plays like a generic shooter, but I think most Star Wars fans aren't looking for much more than that.   
---
And sure, if you consider The Last of Us and Red Dead Redemption 2 to be bad videogames we have opposed viewpoints.
---
I‚Äôm going to ban my kids from playing these types of games, personally. It detracts from their learning in academics and gets them addicted to gaming. 
---
Source: played rts, FPS, Arpg, and mmo in my teens. 
---
Notice how I wasn‚Äôt playing calculus. 
---
It‚Äôs your kid though so do what you think is right.
---
Feralas. It has been my favorite zone ever since the first time I set foot there. Camp Mojache is the most comfortable and scenic hearth spot (mage). The quests are really fun and the mob variety is huge. You get wolves, bears, yetis, ogres, sprites, Tauren guys, and more. Un Goro is a close second though.
---
Yeah, I'd explain what each class is and let him decide what sounds coolest. I think he'll have an easy time leveling almost anything in the right spec. If he thinks warrior sounds cool as shit just be encouraging and play with him to help him out a bit. :D
---
Please dont masterloot in pug groups outside of raids.
---
Damn hunters are kind of trash after MC, BWL
---
Lol, safespace? His comment is what you consider harassment?
---
You're completely right. Additionally, forcing everyone above a certain level to one layer would as introduce exploits, as people have mentioned above.
---
I'm no expert, but what I really think they need is something like forcing you to go to an inn, major city, or instance entrance before you can switch layers. This should greatly limit the exploits layering introduces and make the world feel continuous.
---
Leveling my priest as shadow and leveling mining, fishing, cooking and first aid.
---
Skinning levels itself. Also probably start with a bank alt or two.
---
Thanks for posting. I just love starring at this thing so much.
---
Pandaria
---
That‚Äôs so untrue. That‚Äôs your connection to the server you are on.
---
need everything
---
Razofen downs is H√ºgel der Klingenhauer
---
So, this is something you'll have to learn to readjust for in Classic. You can't just go ham on a mob as soon as you send your VW in to attack or else it'll not hold the aggro. Your best bet is going to be to send your VW in manually to let it pull, MAYBE throw a corruption on the target, then give corruption a couple of ticks before applying any other DOTs or wanting so that your VW had a chance to build some threat.
---
Alternatively, send your VW after one target, apply Corruption and Immolate or CoA, and DOT up a second target, and if you feel extremely confident and have good gear for your level, you can apply DOTs to a third and play "Fear Ping Pong" with a third while continuing to DPS the second.
---
Be advised, using the Fear Ping Pong method is not advisable if you don't have decent gear to withstand possible premature fear breaks, or in areas with tightly packed social mobs that will aggro even more mobs.
---
I agree with wetlands. Quests feel too spread out and it‚Äôs a prime spot for ganking. Some mobs are weirdly close to the road as well, especially near Menethil Harbor.
---
That's kinda unfair for Australians.
---
*laughs in warlock*
---
It‚Äôs gonna be full of gankers but I‚Äôm actually pretty excited!
---
Tauren female have great animations! Most of my horde characters on retail are Tauren female. Definetely going to play a Tauren female Shaman or Hunter in Classic!
---
I think you meant to reply to OP and not me.
---
Thanks!  I love when people are salty about PVP on a PVP server too!
---
I don't ever remember using dailies to level up with.
---
Yeah I edited/deleted and reposted as a non-nested reply. Sorry about that
---
Cool.

So now you're backtracking acting like your rhetorical and sarcastic question was sincere? Lol. I didnt make any blanket statements. 
---
What would be the point of that research? To try to prove that the people against layering are the only ones who actually played the game? You're trying to qualify a player's right to be for or against layering, and suggesting only those who haven't played are ok with it. That's the epitome of gatekeeping.
---
I was making a point that they removed a ton of buffs in retail.

You should level as feral, it's much nicer :)
---
Why? Tinker should have been a class all the way back in classic. 
---
Heck, they should have Racial classes TBH. 
---
Spellbreaker Blood elf. 
---
Shadowhunter/voodoo troll.
---
Fel infused Orc. 
---
Magus Human(mage that does melee)
---
Tinker Gnome
---
Demolition Goblin
---
Calvery Dwarf(rides gryphons, Gyrocopters, Tanks into battle)
---
Priestess of elune NE
---
Vindicator Draeni
---
Sabatour Gilnaen
---
Alchemist Forsaken

Some of them are similar to existing classes, but Im sure that a more creative team than singular me could come up with unquie ways of setting of the classes.
---
Another way to outlevel mobs is by completing all quests in all zones. If you bounce from zone to zone only completing green level quests, you‚Äôll find that you‚Äôll only ever need to fight green level mobs. The yellow/orange quests and mobs you left behind in the previous zones will be green by the time you return. With this quest completionist strategy, you‚Äôll hardly ever need to grind mobs to level up.
---
I stopped playing on pservers a month ago. Come late August I want it to be F R E S H
---
you mean to say that goblin shamans with mechanical like totems dont seem off?
---
What did the classic community take over the years? Most of us had a lot of fun on private servers, and would've continued doing so regardless of classic wow.
---
I'm sorry, I can't hear you over the crackling of my burning demon horse.
---
Added this to the bug list after seeing this. :)
---
Or you could buy one, my friend bought a account that had Overwatch beta access for like \~800 euros/dollars... haha.
---
I've played in 3 different servers over the years since I started playing in TBC, around the ZA patch.
---
I often did see players in trade chat whining about how WoW was dying and how it was better in Vanilla, as well as I did see players tell them to shut up and that it was all rose-tinted glasses.
---
Around MoP, when I last transferred servers, that sort of stuff peaked due to Pandaren being controversial, but with the long drought after Siege of Orgrimmar, it started dying down, likely because unsatisfied players started playing private servers or just giving up altogether.
---
When they announced Classic I did see some discussion, and that rose-tinted glasses argument started disappearing after the Blizzcon beta and has morphed into: "I don't care to play Classic, I like retail/I like the characters and achievements I've had for so long"; "I like retail, but I'll check out Classic because it looks fun"; and "I can't wait for Classic to release - it looks/feels more fun than retail, and I don't think I'll play retail anymore." 
---
TL;DR I did see a back and forth of both "Live game sucks, if you like it you suck too." and "Old game bad. If you like it, you're bad too." 
---
I just think the dynamics changed recently.
---
&gt;  There's one phase where a gun is your BIS item at 60
---
nope.jpg
---
No, they're still supporting all the languages they already do, they're just not getting their own server.
---
It's not about cutting costs, it's about ensuring every realm has a sustainable population.
---
Reminds me of FF7, but they are fucking it all up.  It is my favorite game, I have been a huge advocate for the remake, and now I will not be buying the train wreck they are turning it into.
---
If I can't AoE farm in WoW Classic, I'm staying on pvt servers
---
Could have typed this into Google and immediately found your answer
---
unless they make an old latin speaking server i aint paying a dime
---
I just can‚Äôt see Classic having 1mil active players after a year, I just can‚Äôt. Everyone who played back then is an adult with responsibilities and possibly careers so probably won‚Äôt play much of the most time consuming game on the market, and so there is the new generation, and I really really really don‚Äôt think kids will play much Classic at all. It‚Äôs so different from LoL and Fortnite that many of them play these days and a thousand times slower gameplay wise. Most kids I‚Äôve spoken to at the age of 9-14 don‚Äôt even know what WoW is. When I was 10 WoW was THE game. If you talked about gaming you talked about WoW, every boy in school played it but in secrecy, because you would be labeled as a nerd if people found out. 
---
So we have a young generation who won‚Äôt play, and an older generation who will play casually now and then because life. 
---
Besides you have been able to play Classic via private servers for many years, and they have never reached anything close to a million ever. Why would Classic after a year? I assume if you really want to play Classic and think it‚Äôs the better game you play on a private server?
---
I could be wrong of course, nothing is set in stone before we get to see the numbers.
---
Man, I loved the Mage Tower back in Legion and the thrill of finally managing to unlock that impressive skin while your guild mates were still trailing behind and being able to show it next time you raided was amazing.
---
I love how it's always you who pops in to these threads to shut them down. Why do you have such a personal vendetta against RP-PvP servers? Really got nothing better to do?
---
Making gold is easy, you can spam potions and grenades and have bis and have big bags and have enchants and have world buff and have maxed professions and respec for PvP and be rank 14 while playing only 6-8 hours per day. 
---
Your going to be disappointed. Your the reason layering exist.
---
 The shittier one. If you‚Äôre asking which two pf anything is the vanilla one, it‚Äôs always the worse one.
---
Programmers are just machines that turn time+coffee=code.
---
DM comes in phase 2, so only the first phase.
---
A cow on a dinosaur... Nice
---
That's how it worked in vanilla lol
---
I think they have an internal Version where Most Bugs are already fixed.
---
In that case, if players below level 20 invites someone above 20 to a group, the one below 20 *has to* be layered to the same layer as the player above 20. If it's the other way around, it's still open for potential abuse.
---
Implementing sharding from 1-20 would effectively defeat the prupose of layering in that case.
---
Nah, we call each other Mograine_Lefay
---
just seems like you don't want to actually play any and you're on the fence about it, not sure where you're getting your info, but I've played on the high populated p servers, and the  other once with about half , and it's the same.
---
Goblin shamans are a no-no. Just doesn't fit. Imagine a Tauren rogue, I know it is an extreme example but still. 
---
Some classes and races just don't work and yet Blizz made it for some reason.
---
More importantly how are the crab people considered humanoids. That's a bit of a fucking stretch.
---
That's a revelation, upgeraldos to the left
---
bobby b, any input?
---
DO YOU THINK IT'S HONOR THAT'S KEEPING THE PEACE?! IT'S FEAR! FEAR AND BLOOD!
---
Daily was used for sick ass squid mounts and world pvp
---
The spell gets 100% reduced mana cost, not crit.  The 100% crit one is a 3min cooldown for one cast.
---
I want what's best for Classic WoW. Siloing the playerbase into separate niche realms is not that.
---
Join the club. Been signed up for them since the BC beta, never got a thing.
---
Actually the next revolutionary mind of this generation
---
I understand and empathize with the idea here. However years of playing the game with people who play the game "however they like" has shown the average person instead complains about being broke and unable to improve their gear due to that bottleneck. My post was an attempt to warn as many people that squandering your starting gold has a real cost, and can lead to some people burning out/getting bored faster.
---
Winterspring was always refreshing and you could almost taste the end of the grind.  I enjoyed the snow which was not common as a horde player.
---
Yeah why do people care about old baseball cards that can be worth thousands. Is just cardboard.
---
Did you even play vanilla?
---
How would pulling a low level into a main layer could be abused? Sharding is terrible, I think they had it on during the very first stress test and omg it was horrible, ppl popping in and out, mobs, it completely wrecked the immersion and consistency. 
---
Layering is more persistent.
---
Feralas the absolute most.
---
Where can I find the official statement where Blizzard state that it‚Äôs only going to be 5 realms in EU?
---
Bots in Chinese
---
People on retail complaining that "this xpac sucks WoW is dying" isn't the same as a discussion on Retail vs Private/Classic servers. Of course no one wants to listen to someone whine and moan about how the old game was better and how the current game is dying... on that current game's chat. Especially when Classic wasn't a potential reality up until a few years ago.
---
If someone goes on the Classic realms in a few months and just constantly complains about how Retail is better and that Classic will be dead soon, people will tell them to fuck off just like what happens on live chat.
---
This is exactly why my first character will always be a Warlock. Not having to worry about that is a big burden lifted off your chest. And then by the time my second character gets to 40, I'm making enough money from the first to buy mounts.
---
yup. 
---
I won't be getting my fire skills as a mage, I'll drop several skills like amp/dampen magic, and maybe even some of the frost ones. (im looking at you frostward)
---
I ain't gonna waste my time trying to change your mind since your comment shows that you are obviously clueless on the topic. 
---
You don't understand technology, networking or why spell batching was originally implemented. You don't understand why people "cried" about the lack of spell batching. Hell you can't even understand that spell batching is used on retail to this very day, why it's still being used or EVEN what spell batching actually is and how it feels.
---
I was able to install Classic WoW this morning. Does that mean anything?
---
Charge didn't work in combat, did it?
---
Enchanting is pretty much a noob trap anyway. You need the right recipes to make any money off of it and competent guilds will have their own enchanters so if you aren't your guild's main ench you're gonna have a harder time finding "work"
---
**DED SERVER
---
Can you give a TLDR for the 3 points of things you learned?
---
Sounds are client side.
---
We should discard your comment.
---
What problems are you talking about specifically,  what systems?
---
Pretty sure if they did exactly what you asked you roll your eyes and say YEAH RIGHT I DOUBT IT.
---
But this beta isn‚Äôt close to no changes, as they‚Äôve specifically changed things and say things are staying that way.
---
As a counterpoint, I've been here longer than 99.9% of people and I've never seen people saying the pops would get that low. Like I've religiously perused this sub before there were 1k subs.
---
Might want to explain exactly the problem with the client is.
---
Well you won't be getting that one!
---
[These](https://imgur.com/a/zZokfiX) are your options, with the Black one being from Rank 11 PVP.
---
&gt; while playing only 6-8 hours per day.
---
You're not going to be able to reach rank 14 playing that little anyway.
---
&gt; Your going to be disappointed. 
---
Nah, I'm not, because I have several months to make incredible amounts of wealth before the honor system is implemented anyway.
---
&gt; Your the reason layering exist.
---
What does this have to do with anything?
---
Not really. I raided a bit of MC, kara, and a bit of ST. Other than that I did dailies on the island.
---
where in gods name did you get 20% from?
---
Multi billion dollar corporations do not make moves or investments in products without a large chunk of data crunched and parsed multiple times.
---
The problem with offering server transfers is that it doesn't work. You get a few people off the server but all it does it doubles down on the issue. Some people are attached to their guild, their name, etc. And short of shutting down the server, you're essentially starving anyone who wants to play on those servers of content. So many small, dead servers due to transfers is what resulted in the fusion of server clusters in Mists.
---
Also, having low population servers isn't good for business. Servers with small loads still cost about the same amount of money in resources to run. And of course, when you multiple language support you also have to have customer services agents available for that language. Assuming they launch 5 additional language servers, they hire two people a piece for classic CS, and give them a dogshit salary of $30,000 a year, that's an extra $300,000 in overhead, not counting things like benefits.
---
I get that it's fun to be mad and to think a corporation is just stupid, but the corporate culture of Blizzard has been profits and data fueled. There are logistical concerns that need creative fixes for the niche product their launching, and I'm willing to bet the calculated PR cost of this was probably lower than the cost to bring up and maintain servers for a product they don't think will generate that much money for them.
---
Hey buddy! I was wondering the same thing. I looked and it seems like in the us it varies around 3-7 (3 being California time).
---
I know a lot of people think it isnt that big of an accomplishment, but at that point we had been in DM for almost 8 hours, and the servers were 45 minutes away from shutting down, so it felt pretty epic at the time.  Plus we were all level 15 so in a sense it was an actual accomplishment
---
YES 100%  
---
That is the intended purpose! To get the word out on what server the community may call home!
---
no ivory raptors in classic though
---
i don't think you know what the client is
---
You want what's best for you, not Classic WoW.
---
~100ms to Chicago on retail, I'm on the east coast.  65ms to France on pservers.  If it's my connection, how do I get 65ms half way around the world?
---
A very vocal minority would get upset at something being called "gay" while most people would either laugh if they thought it was funny or brush it off if they didn't.
---
Trick is to pick up skinning and vendor all the skins, easy mount by 40.
---
For epic mount, play aoe mage or hunter. You'd farm 1k in sub 3 days after hitting 60
---
Boh those are all the ones I am looking forward to!! To each their own I guess :)
---
Are you me? I have like 8 friends playing at launch so we are going to spam dungeons.
---
Wrap it up boys, we got em.
---
TLoU aged horribly and the newest one is the same old shit. RDR2 isn't any better than the first, and the first was terrible. 
---
Glad we're on the same page
---
Um, if you've never seen the wall of no then I guess you weren't looking at all. It was infamous enough in 2013 that there were general discussion threads on the blizzard forums asking about it's origins and history. https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/8198732508
---
A literal copy pasta that's nearly a decade old used as a dismissive handwave to anyone who even thought the words "retro server." So don't give me any of that "no one in retails history has ever pushed back against the idea of retro servers" crap you're feeding us.
---
Nice to hear I'm not the only one
---
Definitely Dun Morogh, Loch Modan and Redridge
---
can i have your reshade file
---
They make it silent only for you.
---
I don't think that's generelly True anymore. A game like assassins creed odyssey has so much fucking content that most People will only See a little of it. And also arent companies spending money on multiple endings and stuff like that because most People wont play the game more than once. Hell most People dont even finish games at all.
---
Give them a break, they're an indie company taking a shot at mmorpgs
---
Not even that, the raptors were only Tauren-able from the TBC pre-patch and forward.
---
Mandokir's raptor is the only avenue into lizard locomotion that I am aware of.
---
In personally excited for Mechagon, but I love all things gnome. Everything else is pretty meh though. I'm really looking forward to meaningful professions in classic.
---
insane gold farming capability that other classes (minus mage) can only dream about.
---
It's true...all of em.
---
You could have stopped at "thank you apes for doing your job as beta testers". The rest was unnecessary toxic rant.
---
Meh, just like the white knights that conveniently assume bfa population sucks because we all got married and settled down and had kids right around content gaps and complaints being made. 
---
 I'd love to see people's time played this year for retail, especially the dude who said he didn't have the time to play classic yet wrote 8 pages of text for a reddit opinion lmao!
---
Reading comprehension
---
I think people are just posting it for karma now
---
All you have to do is /s invite me to jump layer.  All the streamers are already doing it.
---
It's not for the gold savings, the epic mounts for different factions require either exalted with that mounts faction or to be the right race. So from my understanding you need to either be a troll or have exalted with darkspear trolls to be able to buy a raptor
---
you will probably end up going to the Loch anyway at some point me lad. there is usually a level gap in westfall where around level 15-16 or so you go to tha Loch and the ol Redridge
---
/say goes across all layers
---
That‚Äôs where we started! 250k+
---
It wasn‚Äôt until around when Classic was announced that discussion of Vanilla was even openly allowed here and on the official wow forums. Threads would be locked, wall of no copy pasted, and flamed by people telling us that we don‚Äôt really like what we like. Then Blizzard themselves came out with the whole ‚Äúyou think you do but you don‚Äôt‚Äù shit, which just added smugness to the anti classic trolls. 
---
I don‚Äôt advocate mocking people for enjoying modern WoW. But I‚Äôm not surprised there‚Äôs quite a bit of hate towards a group that spent the last decade literally celebrating that an entire group of players didn‚Äôt have what they wanted.
---
Game doesn't even start until you get Hillman's Shoulders and a long cape IMO.
---
Pet ai has been notorious for being spaghetti code. Ask any pserver dev. Even blizz has a rough time anytime they play with it. The engine is 15 years old with a ton of changes put into it. Any little change can completely break something unrelated. Took them 15 years to add extra bag slots lol.
---
I only know I paid 15s for my first want with Level13 I think.
---
I don't need them anyways, reee, trade war is bad enough
---
I understand what it does. But I thought any client modification was against the TOS.
---
I loved when they added northrend in patch 1.15, I think it really changed the gameplay for the better
---
There are no green offhand frills with those affixes. The best you will get is "whale" with +10/11 Stamina.

The mods here will close threads talking about important issues like the EU language server situation but will happily keep up blatant retail player bait threads like this that server no purpose other than inflaming the relationship between our two communities.

Top notch moderation.
---
Lucky. I have no one who will be playing with me at launch so I'm gonna be running away a lot lol.

When removing Russia, characters created on German realms constitute 31.29% of the EU pool. https://realmpop.com/eu.html

Mage, can‚Äôt wait to start up my ports &amp; snacks business again.
---
There‚Äôs a reason hunters were referred to as huntards
---
Player retention was destroyed because they started per-patch invalidation. WoW playerbase was going nowhere but up **until** Blizzard turned expansion cycles into patch cycles in order to increase addiction to the game. 
---
When a patch invalidates all progress made until that point (oh Trial of the Champion (a 5man) is out? Whelp time to abandon Ulduar!
---
When the content becomes accessible, people sub for patch, play for 30 days, then quit. For every step Blizzard added to accessibility, it further polarized player retention.
---
fkn kidding me?
---
Depending on what faction I play it will be either Silverpine forest or Duskwood. Just love that spooky forest undead theme.
---
What region will you be playing?
---
I didn't say there was never any push back. I said that in the game I never heard people talking about it. It wasn't an issue for the large majority of players. Things like the wall of no happen because that's what the Blizzard forums are. It's a small subsection of the playerbase that likes to troll and get in arguments and sling shit, and when Classic discussion heated up on there, that was the response.
---
I'm NA.
---
ohhh yeah right, i don't know the wow stress test client which they said will be the one for launch.. get lost idiot
---
Wasn't the game borked as hell when it launched... And accumulated millions of players after that first impression? Also, aren't we still months from release? Also, we don't deserve shit.
---
Tldr: go away, scrub
---
When you learn to spell rogue. 
---
But seriously, you're going to judge a class by it's level 10 play? The toolkit constantly expands throughout the leveling experience. They most efficient leveling build (combat) is also just not the most fun (you can respec for hemo around 30 just to mix things up). At 60, there are many valid builds to go with (combat swords or daggers, seal fate, hemo). All with difference play styles.
---
I agree, having people pop in and out of existence, suddenly be surrounded by mobs which initially weren't there, is a huuge mess. However, the problem is that layering is not suppose to midigate this problem. Layering was suppose to solve the problem of dead servers months after launch, and this is abit confusing, because Blizzard has already stated that both might be the case.
---
But as long as there's no way for player above level 20 to layer hop, I think capping it to 20 is a very reasonable idea.
---
Please make a note in here somewhere that this is post processing and impossible to do in game via /console or something.
---
Guess what, you can only make a male or female character.
---
Lol ‚ÄúI demand blizzard reply to us and tell us how and which issues they are fixing‚Äù
---
Yea. That‚Äôs not how you get what you want.
---
Northrend patch was bad man. There wasn't any reason to go back to MC. Everybody just did BWL, sunken temple and Kara
---
Yeah, a pirate server client. This is the same error the "gnomes are too big" guy made.
---
Humans are the most popular race for the alliance. If you want to level fast I would stick to NE starter zone. You should also learn how to abuse layering to get yourself on an empty layer. Watch monkeynews on how to do it.
---
Well shit, message me tonight and I'll add you on Bnet. You can play with us if you don't have friends playing.
---
IF this happens. Yes the common trend is for games to be popular for a short time and then have a huge drop off. But we're talking about Classic WoW not just any game. Classic is designed to (and managed to back in 2004-2006) hook people long term. The older Vanilla got the larger was the player base. 
---
Yes there will be some players who will leave Classic pretty quickly because they think it is boring. But I would totally not be surprised if except for a drop off at the beginning the game will grow over time like it did back in 2004 to 2006. Classics appeal is community and people will want to stay a part of their community which leads me to believe that Classic will keep most of it's player base.
---
Blizzard sees this as a project that, for the most part, will only attract a small player base long term. Now, I personally think it will be much more successful than that because Classic has an appeal that most games don't have which will lead to a steady growth of the game over time.
---
When the fuck did you rely on daily quest to level up? This is why blizzard ignores the community.
---
Yea, guesswork versions of it.
---
Which is why it feels off when you try to play the real vanilla with blizzlike leeway, delay and spell batching
---
Even more important, why can't I skin a tauren? It's perfectly fine to literally eat another player's corpse but God forbid we skin a man cow
---
That sucks hope the private servers work out for you.
---
What are your favorite UI changes?
---
&gt; If that's true
---
Deserve to know.  Entitlement is at an all time high, it‚Äôs amazing.
---
Blizzard doesn‚Äôt owe us anything, especially for a game that hasn‚Äôt even been released yet
---
Yeah because comparing the launch 15 years ago with completely different problems is accurate. How much of a fucking retard are you?
---
Dude, your guides and spreadsheet back in the day helped out so much. Welcome back!
---
They will be updating loot tables to add newer items when appropriate, but all items will be in their final 1.13 state
---
Are Cloth Quartermasters going to be available in the game from launch or added in a later phase?
---
I'll do that. PM me your bnet and next chance I get (might be a couple days) when I'm off I'll add you :) and thank you.
---
This is the classic you really want and need
---
Hueeeue
---
Thanks, now how do we get it to the developers?
---
Ha, classic...
---
Well okay, we clearly look for different things in games then :)
---
Goblin for nukes, gnome for (sometimes) useful items
---
Those aren't the people who belong In Classic wow and who will quit after a few months. I don't expect much complaints about any of the authentic mechanics. What you see is what you get. Knowing this should be enough to realise that complaining won't work.
---
I mean, they're getting buffed compared to their previous beta state(which was a nerf)
---
WoW has been going on for 15 years now, I'm not worried about my characters on BfA going anywhere any time soon.  A private server could decide to shut down tomorrow and never come back and all my characters are gone.  I could have quit WoW back at the end of Vanilla, and come back and my characters would still be there, waiting for me.  Massive difference in my confidence of my time/progression still being there in 1/5/10 years.
---
TBC was fun, but it set a terrible precedent. Basically, this is what happened. The game launched and the devs said, "people really seemed to enjoy leveling up, then doing dungeons, then doing raids... So let's do that again." 
---
So they added a new content and just started everyone back at square one. And they do that for every expansion.
---
tatical comment.
---
Can never blindly believe something you read on a Reddit comment.
---
Yeah but once ICC dropped and you needed lava cores to melt the ice wall, people still farmed mc so I didn't mind it
---
Agreed. The petition may have helped SLIGHTLY but it definitely didn't play a significant part in us getting WoW classic.
---
I hope so, I plan to play it.
---
How much does it actually cost a paladin? Just do the quests, no gold involved?
---
The cloth quartermasters are currently implemented in the Beta. In Darnassus, Raedon Duskstriker in the Tailor tree in Craftsmen‚Äôs Terrace accepts A Donation of Wool (60 Wool Cloth) for a one time rep reward of 150 Darnassus rep (165 if human). Beyond that, he also offers the quest A Donation of Silk. I haven‚Äôt gathered enough extra Silk to complete that yet.
---
Warlocks can do them on their own so adding a healer just makes it easier.
---
SSShHHHHHHHHH
---
Will do! I'm at work the next 10 hours and I'm kind of forgetful, so toss me a message later if I don't remember to do so when I get home!
---
I did this on the stress test. Where did it say I was on a Pserver?
---
I think it just means pssst like a whisper as it‚Äôs called in the game
---
This entire thesis revolves around the idea that a buggy launch will sink the game. And the first wow launch proves this wrong.
---
Also, this current version being tested is not the release version. 
---
Also, this post doesn't point out a single bug.
---
Also, you dumb.
---
Sry for my spelling. I didnt judge the class, just asking for some experience. Probably sticking to the hunter anyway, but thanks for your feedback.
---
Ah, you're right!
---
I'm about to walk into work myself! Will do!
---
Talk about it 'till their ears bleed! :D
---
Balance druids(not moonkin) are actually great in PVP
---
I've spent the last 4 years playing private servers. Why would I want to start up on a server that's literally shutting down in 2 months?

I don't want to play more buggy and glitchy pservers, I want to play Classic.
---
I did this on the stress test and was getting anywhere from 10-20 copper + grey items and the odd Malachite.
---
Shame for some of us who had awful skins in the spec we liked but oh well.
---
1000000th post on that topic. Don‚Äòt spam or you will be suspended by reddit rules lol
---
&gt; If I can see the content without effort in 10 minutes, I have MUCH less incentive to go out of my way to see it again but with.... bigger stats on loot? Why?
---
That same exact argument can be asked of why anyone would run it a second time (which you need for a healthy game)  Why do it?  Do you really want a bunch of people going through the trouble to join a competent guild only to later just run the raid once and be like ok done nothing else to see by?  You run it again for the loot and the fun.  There are players that want to see the story and theres nothing wrong with that.  
---
&gt; If everyone can see the content, it trivializes it.
---
That's some stupid elitist bullshit talk right there.  Me being able to beat LFR jaina does not in anyways trivialize mythic jaina kills or de incentivize anyone else from doing it.  
---
&gt; ‚ÄúThe world is a lot bigger if there is unbeaten content out there‚Äù will always hold true.
---
Thats why LFR comes AFTER the content has been cleared already...  Its been cleared its not a mystery by the time LFR comes out.  
---
Actually rereading what you said it sounds more and more like a the world feels better to you if you can experience content that you can then gate keep from others out of some kinda I need someone beneath me to feel cool/accomplished.  Which if that's how you feel that's fine but in reality it's a negative experience for the overwhelming majority of players.  Side note having spent most of my hardcore bleeding edge raiding days in vanilla I can safely say the people with the attitude of "look how bad ass I am with my raid gear on" were generally our worst raiders and the ones likeliest to guild hop.
---
That‚Äôs a cool look...but it ain‚Äôt classic.
---
The music and ambience will draw you in.
---
The shitposting will get you to stay.
---
This was on Stress Test...
---
i'm pretty sure all nelf females are traps
---
When I was like 12-13 I got into a raiding guild that did not require teamspeak, as only the officers and raid lead where allowed to talk while in progression. MC / BWL / ZG / AQ cleared except C'thun... 
---
As a frostmage I had the most complicated rotation, but still got fairly high on the damage meter :)
---
He is 11, not a potato. Don't worry.
---
that‚Äôs actually really cool
---
The boomkin can stay in the mages group. Everyone else get out.
---
I had this song in my workout play list back in the day.  lol
---
I'm not denying it happens on both sides. But don't pretend like the private server community was a victim. WoW up until recently was just Retail, that was it. And when private server players would come into that space to complain and tell people who were enjoying retail how shit the game was, it was annoying and people didn't want to listen to it.
---
I say that as someone who prefers older WoW (I'd rather have TBC than Vanilla), hasn't been happy with retails direction for a long time, and has played on several private servers. And even for me it was still annoying to see people shitting on retail or talk about how WoW was dying and Vanilla was better. The way this community went about getting their point across was extremely toxic and entitled. Maybe that attitude is what it took and is a  part of why we have Classic now, but it doesn't change what it was, and those people aren't victims.
---
Absolutely agree. If you can manage a group for all the elite quests that temple is worth a whole level itself if I recall. Plus the design and ambience of the zone is top notch.
---
Hey I'd smash regardless, they may as well consider me a trap, they can be the moose that gets stuck in me
---
Disclaimer, memory is quite unreliable. I was a rogue on Gorgonnash EU (Narkerrit) with around 2000 hours played. I stopped very early into TBC. Never looked back until private servers.
---
I would not bet money that this is wrong. Blizzard was not always used on my server but it was in AV. It was usually no issue stealthing in for 1-2 seconds and opening.
---
I would not bet money here either way. But I am surprised by the extent of the reaction here. This seems like it could work exactly like it did back then. Again, I would not bet money on anything here.
---
I currently wake up around 5:30AM for work by 7, I'm thinking now I might start waking up around 4 so I can game until 6 every morning.  I remember waking up about an hour earlier than I needed to for school when Vanilla came out, so why not do that again?  Now instead of falling asleep in class, I'll just fall asleep driving home from work.
---
&gt; I think you're mistaking time spent in the game with population.
---
The number of people that matters as far as server population goes will always be the amount online. The difference between 10k people playing 8 hours a day (launch week) and 20k people playing 2 hours a day (regular work-life hours) is pretty big. Even if the player base increases in size over time, most people will be playing less amount of hours after the first week. This will be a major factor when it comes to dropoff alongside day 1 "tourists".
---
I think it's a bigger shame that Blizzard removed it rather than find a way to make it last.  
---
(Bring it back pls)
---
Smart marketing on their part. Get some spur of the moment PC sales by advertising Classic to people who may be unaware it‚Äôs coming out still.
---
That's exactly what I needed to know. Thanks!
---
StVietnam gaaaaah WTF gank QQ
---
I honestly can‚Äôt say. I never did the cloth grind back in the day, so I don‚Äôt have anything to compare it to. Following this quest completionist strategy seems to be about 2-3 times as slow as optimal speed leveling.
---

---
What particular animations are you thinking of? I‚Äôve avoided those ugly race/gender combinations forever, but could maybe get convinced to try just for the heck of it. Female tauren warrior? Could be fucking killer
---
Ok, i thought ot was only a gold save thing. But they did make it so in late vanilla or early tbc if im not mistake?
---
If you hijack a server that is supposed to be international, then you're an asshole. How do you think everyone who can't speak that language is going to feel then?
---
And where did you get the idea that the retail playerbase is comparable to the classic playerbase?
---
Nah, what's best for me is giving me GM powers on the sly. That would not be best for Classic WoW.
---
I knew people that would lug a reclining chair to LANs.  Computer tower/peripherals are just a given, dragging the chair and cooler with drinks/snacks made you the real deal.
---
Didnt play too much in vanilla, nor have I played much hunter... can I ask why hunters aren't gear dependent as other classes?
---
they‚Äôre not using 1.12 loot tables. Loot tables are updated in the patch (phase) they were updated originally.
---
I don;t know. You can skin yetis from what I remember, and they're humanoid. I think you could pickpocket them too. And what about gnolls? I'm getting mixed signals here.
---
If you honestly think his opinion changed, I have a bridge to sell you.
---
I know what an employee looks like when they're doing something they don't want to do, and it's all over Hogger whenever they talk about it.
---
What's the problem with server merges?
---
Healing can be difficult to pick up in your first exposure to the game especially for a younger player. Hunter is the most forgiving class and doesn't have many advanced techniques aside from keeping enemies out of your dead zone. If you aren't worried about doing anything high tier, ret pally is probably the easiest melee class to pick up since stance dancing and solo leveling on warrior is brutal and rogue has a higher skill curve
---
All of them, except maybe desolace and Silithus.
---
First off, I am 100% sure that blizzard doesn't tick immediately, there were no DOTs that ticked immediately in vanilla, I don't believe any did until Wrath with Penance which was purposely designed that way.
---
It's almost certainly not a tick of blizzard that is applying the debuff. The blizzard cast is putting a persistent aoe on the ground for the duration of its cast, and there is a delay upon entering that AOE before the game "realizes" you're in the AOE. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yYUDTS5ock&amp;t=25s This video is quite old, from early 2005. Watch how long the consecration debuff remains on him after he leaves it, between the server delay and the good ol' 2005 internet. The same thing can happen in reverse.
---
I do think the blizzard hits faster in the Gegon video than in Perplexity's clip, though, but my guess is that because Gegon's cast started with the rogue in the AOE, so there was no delay for the game to realize he's in the AOE.
---
Another thing to mention is that the APPLICATION OF THE DEBUFF actually knocked rogues out of stealth, it didn't require the damage to hit (evidence: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgV-FPWuWQk&amp;t=2m45s twice in one clip). In the Gegon video you can see the rogue's name BEFORE the damage hits if you slow it down, and there was typically a small delay before other players could actually see you when you leave stealth. I was mainly considering the speed at which the damage tick applies, though (split second after the rogue appears), because the IMP blizzard talent only applies on damage.
---
Betas are not about playing stuff early.
---
Actually, the average cost was around 500g for the paladin mount quest. 1.12 was also the introduction of gold rewards for max level quests, making it much easier to acquire gold at level 60.
---
Yes while I had a semi competent guild that helped me with the Scholomance part, it wasn‚Äôt completely difficult by any means.
---
# skinningequality
---
Great answers!
---
But again, I think there's a balance. If only one guy had a mount out of hundreds of people, some people will find it motivating, but a lot will just be frustrated. Mounts are good example of something attainable but challenging. The winter spring mount is probably too inaccessible that most would even consider attempting it. But it's also entirely cosmetic so people don't go for it unless they want to. If the entire end game was winter spring levels of closed off, more people would quit than be motivated. I hope that makes sense lol
---
It remains to be seen if I really actually manage the 30 hours session. I‚Äôve done it before, but it‚Äôs been a while. I'll try take a nap before the servers go live for sure :p
---
Getting ahead of the zerg in the first two days can really pay off big time for the rest of the journey. 
---
I‚Äôm aiming for 30 hours on launch day but if I happen to be too tired too early I might cut it short at around 24 hours. If my brain somehow happens to still work properly after 30 hours I might very well push it to 35 too, but I doubt it‚Äôll come to that. 
---
While getting ahead is important, making mistakes due to tiredness can make things really inefficient and one is better off to just get some sleep instead of pushing through.
---
Usually for stuff like this the hype alone helps me stay awake for quite some time, so I‚Äôll only resort to caffeine in the last few hours of the day in order to avoid crashing hard afterwards.
---
Skinning and leatherworking for me was always a good idea. Got me tons of good gear while leveling.
---
As do I, man. I'm as excited for Classic as I've been about WoW in a very long time. And if retail players feel the need to troll or whine on Classic chat, I'll be right there with everyone else to tell them to fuck off back to retail. I just get irked by the victim complex some in this community have.
---
What?  Warlocks are the second fast leveling class behind Hunters!
---
&gt; he‚Äôs single and i live with my girlfriend
---
OOOHH, yeah....Sorry about that.
---
The raw numbers are not comparable, but the percentages are relevant. There's no argument to be made that any one country will see a significantly larger margin of returning and new players to Classic than another.
---
Orc Female in Plat Armor does look pretty good.
---
Actually the quests themselves were gold sinks. You‚Äôre paying either way.
---
The entire chain is on YouTube
---
Content wasn't anymore accessible in TBC though. Not many people so much as beat a single boss in TK or SSC.
---
The accessibility thing was a shift in focus in 3.0 when they went nuts over badges, but they went absolutely crazy in 3.2 when they introduced Trial of the Champion that gave better gear than Ulduar. Meaning fresh 80s are going to be raiding Trial of the Crusader, and Ulduar/Naxx/Malygos are now achievement runs. That's when the accessibility BS really went too far.
---
Yea they must really have some high IQ person working for them. To advertise the next Blizzard game took some real guts and quick thinking. 
---
Totally spur the moment as we are 2 months from release.
---
Can we have a 1.12 client as comparison ?
---
does this mean I have beta access? [https://puu.sh/DJJrX/1e05626657.png](https://puu.sh/DJJrX/1e05626657.png)
---
You must be fun at parties.
---
I had 1000+ gold before I hit 60 (epic mount + devilsaur set) from LW thanks to an insane amount of afk-crafting with netflix. Once you get alts involved and a couple of rare recipes you can easily make 200g a week with hardly any effort.
---
LW will be my first choice profession no matter what class I'm rolling, not sure yet if I'll take ench or engi as 2nd profession.
---
SHIMMERING FLAAAAAATS!
---
The rest of 1k needles can heck right off though.
---
Nope, everyone has been able to for a week or so
---
No, retail is trash.
---
Absolutely this.   
---
The only way to know whether you've gotten in or not is to check your e-mail. It generally arrives \~24 hours after you've been flagged for access.  
---
But everyone still thinks that littering this sub reddit with threads asking if they got in is a good idea xD
---
Definitely fucking leveling to the Naruto theme song now on repeat.
---
I never use 2h on my warrior DW all day. So i don't really see it ever. Especially as a tank and fury tank i will hardly ever see it aside from when i decide to go and rank.
---
Why... why skinning when you go engineering?
---
/u/_Falathrin_ wants to get hammered.
---
I'm out of the loop. Could you explain
---
Coming out of retirement to revisit Stranglethorn Vale.  Leveling there before there are a bunch of 60s running around is going to be lit.
---
 Sure you won't level as fast, but it'll be fun. Or horrifying. Depending on your PVP acumen.
---
See you there, you bunch of pansies.
---
THRILLHOU
---
I did it back in vanilla. Looking up the requirements for what you needed.
---
5 Stratholme Holy Water - Free from instance  
---
10 Arthas's Tears
---
40 Runecloth - Free  
---
6 Arcanite Bars - 1 Thorium Bar, 1 Arcane Crystal, 1 or 2 day cool-down.   
---
50 Gold for a quest.  
---
Pristine Black Diamond - Rare drop. were around 200+ when I did it back in vanilla.   
---
Azerothian Diamond    
---
In theory it's possible to get the mount for only 50 Gold if you are an alchemist/herberablist and have friends. If no friends I'd say 200-300g for the Azerothian Diamonds and Arcane Crystals that you get from mining.
---
This
---
This is such a simple thing to see it actually worries me how foolish people are. If they think the amount of people gaming today is the same as in 05, they are insane.
---
Not a retail fan but just wanted to point out stream viewership has already died out, only been a month lmao
---
You sound salty.
---
Also he didn‚Äôt even say that was his purpose, just that if you‚Äôre not used to doing it, it definitely can dull content for you on live. 
---
Wrath/WoD betas for myself.
---
How is it irrelevant? Doesn't the fact that they are putting Russians away prove the point?
---
And why exactly should the classic community care?
---
Classic players are under no illusion that retail players crying foul over jabs being poked at live will not make any difference in whether they actually will play classic, because if you actually were passionate about it you wouldn't be whining about fee-fees being hurt or toxic communities because every community is toxic, like what large community doesn't have toxicity? Especially on Reddit?
---
It may not be doing us "favors", but it certainly provides us with humor, and let's not forget the erasure you're engaging in by completely forgetting to mention the years upon *years* of being told in to a corner by shit like the wall of no copy-paste and Blizzard themselves "you think you do but you don't".
---
The classic community deserves a little bit of a victory. Poking fun at retail leading up to release where we will all surely be too busy to do so anymore is like our version of a pride month. Retail players *was so sure* that we were just noisemakers, fighting for something that will never happen, it's not profitable, too much overhead, etc etc etc blah blah blah and in the end all those people are eating crow like you haven't seen.
---
So I say relax bro, it's normal for people to be proud of what they fought for and tease their opposition a bit for finally being right.
---
and rogues can vanish. yes 5 min cd, but still...
---
I'm currently at playing in a private server and I killed mobs between quests even when I was level 2. Pure grind might be the best solution
---
&gt;      
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I understand what you mean, but I do think it exists as rumor, as some cool, almost secret content. It may even be a reason to keep playing.
---
That is the whole reason I was playing in TBC. I wanted to have that gear, to see those raids, to know what it was all about. All I knew about the Black Temple is that it starts in the sewers--how does it go from there? The Eye looks so damn cool, what's beyond those pack mobs sitting at the entrance?
---
I snuck in to see the entrances of all the big raids once their attunements was removed. I didn't even know how the entrance to BT even looked like since you needed to kill Kael'thas! It was just a mythical hole in the wall, at the other side I knew was waiting the hardest content in the game. And that's what drove me to beat Karazhan, to jump ship to a TK/SSC guild, and then jump ship to a BT/MHJ guild, where I fought tooth and nail to beat those raids so that I can at least kill Illidan, and beat Sunwell Plateau.
---
In the end, I didn't even kill Illidan, or so much as try to raid SWP, missed out on the Hand of A'dal. But it's that restriction that drove me to be the best I can be. It's the desire to reach it, to claim the gear, to claim the prestige amongst your server and friends, that's what drove me and what made me fall in love with the game.
---
Um, maybe because there's WAY more people playing now? Why is that so hard to see? The gaming population is probably 100x what it was in 05.
---
Fear Ward is a single target spell, you cannot fear Ward everyone in a raid and despite what everyone is saying you need more than two.
---
What? I‚Äôm agreeing with you. Best Buy must have really had to fight hard and tough to get this ad in. Props to them. This was a really bold move.
---
Why are you re-posting exactly the same thing??? Should I report it? 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c3wieh/the_problem_layering_has_atm/
---
You're not paying attention to the important part. Blizzard considers those server mergers a failure. They haven't done them in years. They're not going to do something they saw as a failure over again if they can avoid it.
---
Darkshore and Ashenvale most of all. Cata completely ruined them.
---
tfw when your knock off card game has more interest than apparently whats just the game of the century
---
I still have them at my house from time to time. And there are still plenty of LAN that are going around across the country.

Winterspring Frostsaber.
---
The server I played on anounced the shutdown for August, 25th.
---
Didn't log in since 2 months.

I wish I would have checked when I was in the stress test.  You say the guns are the same?  The good old loud bang sound?
---
My bad. I took it as snark.
---
There is actually a movement going on in europe between  German and french players to distribute servers.
---
There was a meeting of  about 50 german guild Leaders today with about 20-30 members on average.
---
If u are interested look for it in the forums or answer.
---
Csgo is at least the best fps since 1.6/q3 cpma.  Is it better than 1.6 from a gameplay standpoint?  No.  But it's better than source or early versions of csgo.  If your expectation is that csgo literally had to be the greatest fps of all time then it's a disappointment, but I don't know many hardcore can players that aren't really satisfied with where it ended up.
---
Same with StarCraft 2, it is easily better than any rts since wc3, and you could argue it's a better 1v1 rts than wc3 in it's current state.  Today's sc2 shits all over the versions from 2010 - 2015, it's way better.
---
Some of the games from that list I agree.  But considering what fans of quake, Diablo, melee have to deal with (waiting literally 20 years and never getting an acceptable product) - trust me there is no reasonable cs fan bitching today.  The series could have just collapsed in 2011 and never been anything.  Instead it's one of the top competitive games of the decade in popularity and gameplay.
---
Can't they farm darkspear rep?
---
blizzard stated no language specific servers for EU , and its now a shitstorm on the official EU forums.
---
a lot of ppl are stating they wont play classic if there is no language specific servers.
---
the decision is probably financial , and so ppl saying they wont play comfort blizz in their decision that classic wont be successfull enough to support language specific servers cost
---
so the actual rant from EU players is actually unproductive
---
Funny how you‚Äôre acting like an authority on the topic but a few months ago you chocked it up to the just being a ‚Äúno changes‚Äù feature. Here‚Äôs you from a few months ago:
---
&gt; that's just how the game was working for roughly 10 years, intended or not. 
---
Now back to speaking about Vanilla specifically. Vanilla sure does have a lot of things that do not make perfect sense and spell batching is definitely one of them. I do believe however that making sense should not come at the cost of authenticity. Anyway that's how i see it. I really hope it makes it's way into Classic. Otherwise lots of things will be feel different/stronger/weaker (rogues for example will be much MUCH better and stronger without spell batching).
---
So essentially your opinion on batching is ‚Äúlol it doesn‚Äôt make sense but without it classic just won‚Äôt *feel the same* and some classes *might* be stronger without it‚Äù. Yep, a very technical standpoint, thanks for enlightening us.
---
Feralas had some of the better quests and atmosphere now that I remember of it.
---
Classic community already sucks.
---
Oh, damn ah well
---
No you‚Äôre not, you‚Äôre being a sarcastic ass.
---
Okay, how about Joana's guide? Stop talking shit.
---
https://youtu.be/jTSyexUNN9E?t=146
---
LCD panels were out then. Granted I started on a 15" CRT on release and moved to a 17" Samsung 4:3 panel at Christmas.
---
I'm confused. Not a native English speaker, but it seems like you're saying you had 40 FPS in Dalaran... that's bloody fantastic. I fell to 6 fps in Shattrath.
---
Anrcdotal, doesn't matter. Blizzard talked about raiding participation and I'll believe their numbers over your anecdotal experience, sorry.
---
And yea, the dungeons were solid when they launched and then became loot pinatas because the gear outscaled them so hard. The dungeons themselves were initially okay. Not TBC heroics but alright. It was scaling that went to shit in wrath.
---
Whether or not you liked Arthas story is also irrelevant. People were hyped up for it because the wc3 buildup was brilliant and people were hyped to see how it turns out. The wotlk story telling was not oscar worthy but interest was huge and it anything but terribly done.
---
Sometimes anticipation can be as important as exdcution. Just look at bfa. After Legion, anticipation for the next xpac was huge, even though the expac was shit.
---
As for WotlK vs base game that's not a fair comparison. Classic came out of nowhere and was absurdly popular. WotlK benefitted from classics and tbcs popularity. You cannot give all credit to wotlk. It sure was popular but I'm trying to make you understand that there are more ppssible interpretations for this other than 'best xpac ever'. If you look at 'players added' rather than total players (which, i know, is also not a fair metric) wotlk is suddenly way less successful compared to classic.
---
WotlK had a lot going for it that wasn't content (gameplay wise). Timing, highly anticipated story arc, 2 amazing preceeding expansions, casualization to reek in more players (paying for short term success with long term damage). To say that the high sub numbers are unambiguously because it was the best version of WoW is a bold statement to say the leasrlt. Just think of the amount of people who got addicted in the previous 2 expansions and would've played the third one no matter what. Just think of the ppor addicts still playing even though they have no fun and are just complaining (please nobody twist my words here. I'm talking about a subset of players, not insunuating that these are all thats left in bfa)
---
Oh, thanks for clarity
---
Yeah I saw that. I'm just saying that reasoning doesn't make sense to me. The only place in the game a user would see a different character set is on the realm list. Maybe that's enough for them?
---
Humans and NE are the same, there is practically no benefit of playing human compared to NE from a healing perspective.
---
The comment didn't sound critical to OP to me.  OP doesn't say they didn't participate actively
---
They're bringing up the point that all these people begging for Classic beta are begging to play the content.  When beta needs to be about discovering bugs and making the game better for everyone on launch.
---
It's fine to enjoy the content while being useful in the beta but it's not fine to just be in the beta for the selfish reasons these people seem to want.
---
Rip my mottled red raptor... no reason they couldn‚Äôt leave them in the game permanently instead of having them in for the first patch or not at all.
---
1, no they're exclusive to each faction.  2, every class had a use, it just depends on what circumstance you're in
---
Reported.
---
No need to throw insults. Thanks for doing the proper research this time, remember when reporting bugs to always use source 1.12 evidence and avoid pirate servers.
---
i dont know the math , but pet damage doesnt scale with weapon , so it might be a thing, like base lvl 60 pet damage might be high. 
---
what i know for sure is hunter do really well without any gear compared to most other physical damage dealers. as the pet damage is static , they do fall off on later content tho.
---
Well I once tried to recover a deleted char and it's just not there anymore. Super sad about this. Seemingly everyone gets 12 year old chars recovered but my old lvl40 priest is just gone and apparently never existed.
---
Whatever, classic is gonna be fresh chars anyways üòâ
---
I'm in the Beta since Week2. I was in the BFA Alpha every early on, never even bothered.
---
The Beta is pretty dead. Layering completely killed it and I dont want to play too much so I spoil the Release for myself.
---
Emojis = Downvote, sorry
---
I was with you besides the rotation part. If anything, retail had these long elaborate annoying rotations. Most of Vanillas class rotations are one button.... Sorry to break it to you. Lock, mage are literally 1 button. War, Hunter, Spriest, Shamans have a few buttons, not many.
---
 Don't get me wrong I like it better, but it's kinda ironic that you said it like that.
---
Probably, if you can have decent uptime
---
I remember hitting 40 very clearly. I played from release day and had no idea I would need a lot of money for riding training plus mount and developed a very bad habit of hitting up the AH in Ironforge every two levels to buy all new gear. At level 40 I had 15 silver. 
---
I did not get my level 40 mount until I was level 53. 
---
:(
---
They can, but the raptors are only usable by Troll, Orc and Undead \^\^
---
NE Druid, still not sure if Resto or Feral.
---
I agree, winterspring was one of the most memorable zones from back in the day. A lot of awe playing through it for the first time.
---
Would taking gather professions be enough to get enough gold? I'm already planning on having a warlock as Enchanting / Herbalism for making money.
---
Oh ok that makes sense.  Thanks for replying!
---
Classic newbie here - what skills would you say are absolutely 100% necessary for each class? This is a big question, I know, so an answer isn‚Äôt necessary, but I would appreciate it
---
BIG True üôè
---
Someone that clearly didn‚Äôt watch the video.
---
When people say this sub is toxic, the title of this post is an example. You can think Classic is great without creating an outsider or other to demean and insult.
---
You were talking shit, sometimes Private Servers had it right, you can't disregard it. 1.12 Clients for Private Servers are 1.12 clients that, if Blizzard released a 1.12 server to connect to, would work. Nothing's changed.
---
Judging by his own explanation that's not what he meant.
---
But I get your point. Tbc release timing was stupid. Especially since classic content was much more durable than todays wows content. They couldve easily let classic run another year or two
---
Guns sounded the same but I'll need to recheck. Sounds fine to me though.
---
You also assuming beyond the promised "ideally 2 weeks layering will be gone" as well.
---
I'd imagine that as the game releases, there will be A LOT of layers but there could only be something like 2 or 3 layers in a couple weeks. Sure, they get extra layer, but it won't be like release where there could be 10 layers.
---
The thing is, nobody knows the inrush of initial servers, and I'd rather have layers for a few weeks and let some poopsockers get rich, than stick people in queues for hours who don't care about those 1% rich folks.
---
Ahhh, gotcha
---
&gt;It is crucial to the way vanilla felt though, and increased the skill cap of classes in pvp by a large margin, it set the good and the great apart.¬†
---
I'm not going to argue that it shouldn't be in Classic, because it was in vanilla, but the skill portion of this statement makes no sense at all. 
---
Let's say you're a rogue fighting a mage -- you anticipate that they are going to blink so you use gouge. Your gouge and his blink get processed in the same batch, so he ends up blinking away from you and sits in a gouge. One of two things just happened:
---
A: You used gouge a fraction of a second before he blinked. Good for you! You are the more skillful player. Unfortunately, even though the mage now sits in a gouge, he *still* gets the benefit of gaining distance away from you, even though you acted first, and you now have to spend time closing the distance between the two of you. Even though the mage was the less skillful player, he still rewarded to an extent by creating distance between himself and your rogue. The less skillful player gets rewarded to an extent that they otherwise would not. With no batching, or very small batching windows, the mage would be stuck gouged right next to you, because you got your ability off first.
---
B: You used gouge a fraction of a second after the mage used blink. That sucks, you weren't quick enough to get your ability off first. But guess what -- you are still partially rewarded because the mage has to sit in a gouge after they blink away. Even though you are the less skillful player in this scenario, and you didn't time your gouge to land a fraction of a second before the mage used blink, you are still rewarded to an extent. Without batching, or with very small batch windows, the mage would blink away and be free to take further actions instead of sitting in a gouge. 
---
In either scenario, the less skillful player is rewarded to an extent that they should not be. Timing an action to land a fraction of a second before your opponent's doesn't matter -- you can be slightly late (but within the same batch window) and still be rewarded to an extent, even though you were in fact late with your ability. 
---
Again, I'm not going to argue for its removal, but batching does not reward skill to the extent that you claim. In fact, it does the exact opposite; it rewards the guy who was just slightly late with their key press. Just because two (semi) mutually exclusive events happening looks cool, that doesn't make it skillful play.
---
I see that as an absolute win
---
The Tanaris + Un‚Äôgoro shitshow should be fun times.
---
Trisfal / Silverpine even tho I plan on playing an Orc lock i'm running my ass to trisfal on launch since I just love those zones way more.
---
Yeah this is probably the best idea. I'd even be satisfied with the cap being at 30. It need to change at least, the system right now will inevitably lead to more trouble for Blizzard, not less.
---
I guess he's saying only buy skills for your spec / rotation. Like if you're gonna be a frost mage, skip fire skills.
---
Changing a number that affects quite literally every single spell and action in the game. Might introduce a few bugs.
---
And food. Dont forget the fiod. It actually is needed in classic.
---
THRILLHO
---
What are those 2.0 items that are in?
---
- it was just a placeholder "do damage" spell and they always intended to remove it and fully flesh out the "seals, judgements" rotation, but didn't have enough time to do so and were not happy with paladins
---
- all specs should've been viable in all parts of the game, feral druid have been basically on par with prot warriors, as well as prot paladins. They initially thought something like "90% of the viability of the optimal spec", but that turned out wildly not enough, as everything even 5% less optimal than the best choice was deemed "not optimal" and not taken into raids
---
- they basically tried a lot of crazy shit, not knowing where it will lead to, so that people have the freedom to explore, try and combine and so that everything is not clear and streamlined. So basically the fact that some lvl 40 items are BiS was "intended". Also the existence of purely bad items because "if everything is great, nothing is" is true. Also later in designing tier sets they had to make them for the "optimal specs" and not for example for ret paladins, because that became the majority of the hardcore playerbase and the most vocal part of community and the most vocal people who complained the most always got the most
---
still using 1337 as my phone's screen unlocker code
---
It's people like you that don't understand basic gaming that are complaining. You can't POSSIBLY just leave the population because it's "high enough". You can't allow 20k people to log into a server. One, it wouldn't be able to support it. Two, you wouldn't get anything done at all. No quests, no farming, nothing. 
---
You guys are crying for a non issue. Do you think Blizz wants to put layers in and listen to the constant bitching? No, but they have no choice.
---
Orc Hunter. The stun resist is broken so I‚Äôll counter rogues even harder. The bow and crossbow animations are super crisp. I like the death animation so feign death looks neat. Increased pet damage is just a free bonus. I love the starting zone as well. Also... shoes that can actually cover the feet of my character model
---
They are just not a top DPS.
---
Tabard of Frost and Riding Turtle are the ones I've tested on classic, according WoWHead added in 2.0.0.5462
---
&gt;Having a gf that doesn‚Äôt play with you
---
Rough one, bud.
---
Weren't you just hating on his last video?
---
100 hours to 60 is entirely possible, especially if you're using Rested XP, but let's call it 5 days /played (120 hours).
---
Using national averages:
---
* 44 hours a week of work
---
* 27 minute commute
---
* 6.8 hours of sleep per night
---
That's ~192.2 hours, leaving 143.8 hours. If he spends no more than 1 hour and 42 minutes each day showering, eating, doing chores, etc, that leaves enough time to get to level 60 in 2 weeks.
---
That's roughly 12 hours every weekend day and 7 hours every day after work.
---
I like the level cap idea, best one so far and probably easiest to implement, lvl 15 or 20 would work out fine and at these levels I'm fine with layering but after that I want nothing to do with it. It is a game breaking mechanic for me personally.
---
Pretty sure he talked about pre-BiS. Dwarven Hand Cannon.
---
Because half of the idiots who play retail are under the impression that people can't function in a game that doesn't treat its player-base like 5 year olds.
---
&gt; You get a few people off the server but all it does it doubles down on the issue.
---
If some people want to remain on those servers, let them. If they prefer a dead server rather than a free transfer away: let them.
---
&gt;  Servers with small loads still cost about the same amount of money in resources to run.
---
No they don't. If only 5 people remain on a realm. That realm costs practically nothing. Where do you have that information from?
---
&gt;  And of course, when you multiple language support you also have to have customer services agents available for that language.
---
They already have that for retail. No need to hire additional staff unless there is a large influx of players in which case they make a profit.
---
&gt; There are logistical concerns
---
No there are no concerns in that regard unless they actually want to remove language support for retail as well. 
---
&gt;  lower than the cost to bring up and maintain servers for a product they don't think will generate that much money for them.
---
Again, do you have some special inside information? Server does not equal realms. Additional realms does not mean additional servers if there is no load on those realms.
---
O she plays just isn't as excited as we are. She started during legion
---
Dailies weren't used for leveling. They were added in TBC as either as motive to complete a level relevant PVP objective, or to grind reputation with a few selected factions.
---
But does it have to be once or twice a minute?
---
No it isn't. It's completely different. Time to trade in your ears.
---
Spell batching is stupid. It is a technical solution to a hardware problem that no longet exists. The game should be responsive, find some other way to reimplement the old behavior of overlapping CC.
---
Because Blizz is in a tight spot. If a queue is brought back, the little brats of today will cry and wet their fucking pants. It will be FAR worse than the posts now. Whiny gamers who can't play will lose it, not to mention those who took vacation will lose their damn mind.
---
Layers are literally the only option. You guys are really annoying and I'm sick of seeing these stupid ass posts. You don't know what you're asking for, and one of the responses here is clear of that. "If the population is high enough then there's no need for layers". Literally doesn't even know why layers are a thing, yet is probably going around bitching about an "authentic" experience. 
---
Let me tell you, back in Vanilla I didn't wait 8 hours to play. I also didnt fight 100 people to tag a mob in every area. Or to gather herbs or ore. That's not even close to being authentic.
---
Classic WOW had the best rites of passage when leveling. Level 40 mount probably being one of the best first time achievements to get.
---
yes of course. if not on release it will be fixed until the majority of people will start raiding. blizzard will always ensure high quality games, thats what they are known for.
---
The ones where if I want it. It won‚Äôt drop. So I‚Äôd say the accurate ones.
---
That‚Äôs not nice. I‚Äôm being serious.
---
I read the fucking post. Nothing in my above statement is false. You want T2, but you also want off pieces that casters highly covet like  **Neltharion's Tear.**  
---
Again,  no link to a parse. I wonder why.

---
&gt; It's almost certainly not a tick of blizzard that is applying the blizzard debuff.
---
In the OP's video the debuff application matches up perfectly with the Blizzard tick going off. Whether this is how it worked originally or not is another question, though. As for the Consecration thing, I don't think leaving the AoE is quite the same as entering it. The debuff could be intentionally sticky to prevent people from dancing on the edge of the AoE, for instance.
---
&gt;The blizzard cast is putting a persistent aoe on the ground for the duration of its cast (like consecrate or flamestrike)
---
Don't all these AoEs work by putting a debuff on you? I believe this is for technical reasons, to keep the AoEs performant. Something along the lines of every tick of the AoE it checks if there are people in it and puts the debuff on them, and deals the AoE's effect to people who already have the debuff.
---
&gt;In the Gegon video you can see the rogue's name BEFORE the damage hits if you slow it down, and there was typically a small delay before other players could actually see you when you leave stealth.
---
This is a good point. It would be much easier to check this from the rogue's PoV because of the lag on leaving stealth.
---

okay

&gt;pre-TBC 2.0?

wat
---
contrary to popular belief the best lvl 40 mount in vanilla is the dwarf's ram.   while waiting for party members to run to an instance you can quickly tap the w key to make funny sounds.
---
Yea yea. Blizzard bad. We know.
---
FWIW I have no problems using uBlock origin.

Did that go how you thought it would? Nope - Will Ferrelll

Ok.

Aaahhh.

Thanks

Does going into Ghost wolf remove Noggenfogger &amp; Savory buffs?
---
"Those people" include my personal friends whom I've gamed with for 15+ years, so I'd like to help them where able. I thought an attempt to help others avoid pitfalls and gold sink traps would be useful.
---
Classic is not even close to blizzlike. It‚Äôs a botched version of Classic running on a Legion client.
---
Wp old man.
---
People like to be useful. Its a public service for a community that you enjoy taking part in.
---
Everything has been theorycrafted and nitpicked to death from Vanilla and on Private Servers for years. I doubt there are going to be any surprises in Classic WoW.
---
Thank you so much, making a profile right now \^\_\^
---
I don‚Äôt know why but this comment finally made me realize why people want rp-pvp servers
---
i actually think thats true, but those classes have to put in double the effort to be compareable to a pure dps class putting in no effort. if you can farm the consumables then you can raid. if you cant then you should go for your heal spec
---
Barrens(chat), Desolace
---
Just some summaries of the data available from [wowclassicpopulation.com](https://wowclassicpopulation.com). Some obvious caveats are the site relies on people running an addon in-game to capture characters. Also it seems there is no data for Alliance on Classic 12 from the June stress test, I assume because nobody there happened to be running it.
---
Also noteworthy, only about 10% of characters reached max level (currently 40) in the closed Beta. Only 6.5% hit level 15 on the stress test. Around 1/3 of characters were played for a significant amount of time in the stress test (at least to level 15), and around 25% have been leveled substantially in the closed Beta (30-40).
---
Stormx has some great usage of engineering items on YouTube. Pop out of shapeshift, nade, rejuve, bear, charge, etc. Rocket helm too, as an extra stun. It's a weird combo for sure, but if you want even more utility in pvp I think it's necessary.
---
Warlock didn't have a quest for a mount on release.
---
He put up a good fight at least! Eventually all the retail players took him down.  Jay will be the one to do the snap...lol
---
/leave general

As NE, easily enough at mild inconvenience.

Dwarf has one sticking point with Rok'delar, not having that bow while farming chrom for Ash will be a pain.

Nope

Besides Warrior on top and Druids on the bottom these are certainly unexpected results.
---
Interesting...
---
Pissing off the hashtagnochanges crowd but getting a black war raptor in return would be worth it.
---
Pretty sure this points to a deliberate change and so isn‚Äôt ‚Äúincorrect‚Äù or a ‚Äúbug‚Äù but a feature. Honestly the change sounds good and gives weight to your actions. I doubt once you‚Äôre arcane shotting and freeze trapping and kiting in general immersed in the gameplay that you‚Äôll really notice the change. It‚Äôs only super obvious because you‚Äôre level 1 using auto-shot. 
---
All of the various shots had hit sound effects in vanilla so it makes sense that auto-shot does too. Interested in the gun shots now.
---
Layering is dog shit = cheap way for money mogul
---
Actiblizz so soak more money.
---
I plan on playing a balance Druid 0/1/0. Is this viable to solo naxx week 1?
---
Anyway I could get the info on how to play on that server
---
Absolutely, just line in Vanilla some ppl were able to use some "unconventional" specs. But it is unlikely for the meta to change since Vanilla was played for like 15 years (2 on official and 13 on private). 
---
The content will be much easier for the general population so it is very likely the spec requirements are not going to be that strict for 99% of Guilds.
---
How is pvp gear done in classic? Are there pvp gear? Does everyone that queue up for bgs use their pve gear?
---
i really think about rolling on a rp-pvp server aswell. not because i like roleplaying but rather because i dont want to play with a toxic community of elitists
---
same
---
" That's not how its gonna be today. Nor how it is going to be in any future MMORPG that gives players access to beta testing. "   
---
This statement kinda contradicts what you said in the rest of your reply. Vanilla wow had beta testing.
---
This right here. I have a problem with this being all I make on horde with a metal jaw and Mohawk
---
Maybe those particular individuals aren‚Äôt victims. But even asking for legacy realms very respectfully, or simply discussing design principles from the older expansions got you attacked. Literally was told ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you‚Äôll never get what you want‚Äù by someone a couple of years back. Dozens of other similar things, but that particular one stood out to me.
---
Idk but tht rogue would definitely enter combat before the sap got off. Stealth in Classic is very poor. Rogues basically don't have cc especially in dungeons when the mobs will atk when u get into sap range.
---
So Activision is paying Best Buy for marketing and this is somehow a surprising result? You do realize Best Buy is not giving Activision free publicity, but actually sells the display screens on their site as ads?
---
What's the big drive that so many want a RP pvp realm? Is it really that big of an rp community in the game, an on top of that including with the other faction? Do you guys RP fights too and all that too
---
OP you have this resolution of the map you can link? Reddit app won‚Äôt let me save onto my phone.
---
It's way too precise to work in practice. What about those really popular servers? Can we expect layering forever there? 
---
Layering at its core is the definition of anti-Classic. Classic is all about the server community. If you only see a third/fourth/fifth of the people on your server playing, then what's the point? You just cut of a big chunk of the appeal. Not to mention how immersion breaking it is and all the inevitable exploits.
---
There have been many methods suggested at this point. The fact that's they're still holding on to layering is just extremely lazy and cheap.
---
It will not be hard - healers are always in demand.  Early on in Vanilla there were PUGs that would not take druid healers, but this faded over time as druids got buffed and people learned how to play.  Classic will start with patch 1.12 and druids were in good shape at that point and people today understand the game much better.  The lack of regular rez was never a major issue anyway - groups that died a lot often disbanded
---
&gt; There's no difference in the amount of nodes/mobs available on 300 servers than on 300 layers
---
Yeah, the difference is that I, on my server, can't hop over to another server to farm nodes there.  I can however, hop layers to farm nodes.  Thats the potential for abuse, and it will absolutely fuck economies up.
---
&gt; The amount of materials, and the amount of gold, is the same as without layers
---
No, it isn't.  Its multiplying it by however many layers there are.  You can hop layers, you can't hop servers in Classic.  Its completely different than retail where you can hop servers and its all irrelevant (though realistically, it *is* abused even on retail, ie farming Time Lost Proto Drake that is supposed to be ultra rare but can be found much easier by hopping servers rather than being forced to get it on your individual server).  The potential for abuse by farmers before they (hopefully) turn layering off for good is high.  There are only so many mining/herb nodes in the world, and they're all on certain timers, being able to hop layers to get more than you would on just a single layer/server will screw up the herb/ore economy.
---
Go ahead and shard/layer the starting 1-12 zones, but once people in the "open world", that shit needs to be turned off.
---
Fight hard? Lol. What happened was Activision bought ad space from Best Buy. There was no convincing being done. It is ad space and sold accordingly
---
Yes but enchanting won't make you money. At least not for quite some time. It is also a pain in the ass just to level up. You have to disenchant everything and you can't make any money.
---
It's all I care about when it comes to playing world of warcraft. I'm just trying to help the community I love and play in to come together and get organized!
---
Riding turtle and Tabard of frost were in the game before 2.0. You can go to old alakazam and see people talk about how to get it on november 1st 2006 and 2.0 was only released in december.
---
If it's red, it's dead.
---
Most things that people thought were off so far has actually been correct, and blizzard showed proof of it.
---
Remember when everyone said that the elites were doing too little damage? And then Blizzard pulling up the 1.12 in house client to show that the values were actually correct.
---
Private servers are done fully on guesswork, they have no numbers at all, they only rely on faulty memories and scrambling to find video examples of mechanics.
---
Classic will be a hella closer to real vanilla than any private server could hope to be
---
What's less shit about 8.2?
---
New to reddit too?
---
Druids are among the classes least reliant on engineering. For some classes its absolutely necessary.
---
If nothing changes on Blizz side the Language division will occur naturally like it does in any other MMO (Final Fantasy for example). Some servers will be predominantly one language or the other.
---
No need to be a sarcastic prick.
---
Maybe a week prior to launch
---
I could have put faces like Ion‚Äôs on here to make it more comical but I respect him and all the work he does for the game.
---
You're doing exactly what I said. I get that you won't convince everyone, but you're living in an echo chamber. You hear that the live game is trying to shut you down at all costs, and yet there are all kinds of people saying they've never heard it. I don't doubt it's there, but it would be a loud minority. And in this case, you're just as bad as they are. You're spreading hate and instigating conflict because you *think* everyone is out to get you.  
---
Cool man, you can live that life, but you're wrong for spreading your hate simply because you feel like you deserve a victory. Victory over what? The live game? It won't happen, there will always be fans for both.  
---
I agree there is toxicity in every community, but I've gotta say the entitled  crybaby attitude here is monumentally worse then most. I would say the closest thing would be the League community, and you guys trump that. Can't say I'd be proud to be that toxic.
---
I‚Äôm not. That‚Äôs not a very nice thing to say.
---
You need to listen again then buddy, as i'm pretty sure you're tone deaf. It's literally **exactly** the same sound effect; just with the volume toned down.
---
well put stranger.
---
Naxx was Wotlk! huehuehuehue
---
i feel like players really DONT know what they want after all. those who cry about wanting to play the endcontent without putting in effort are the same people who quit the game the next expansion. also i feel like the imbalance of vanilla makes it so interesting to play.
---
Anyone know the respawn rate of weapon/armor crates?
---
I mean sure, things won't be the same, but when raiding gets going and your guild is stuck waiting for more healers and your enhancement shamans are doing 1/3 the dps of the other dps classes, that's when things will start sorting themselves out.
---
Make sure to ask where mankriks wife is
---
Yeah you are. Anyone with half a brain can tell that your comment was made with sarcasm. Stop kidding yourself.
---
You act as if its just americans wanting english only. There are groups in other countries wanting their own language servers..... dont act as if if its just english speaking people. Thats rediculious.
---
I remember still being able to edit your client to look like the Lichking (only visible for you).

Back in Vanilla you could get away with much more crazy shit and scams :)

It's like people whining about things instead of explaining. \^\^

Why do you keep using insults?

I wrote the comment. Pretty sure I know what my intentions were more than you.

Orc female and undead female. Most of the male races are huge hulks or slotching with horrible posture. I like to play agile classes and the female models are the only ones that fit the class fantasy unfortunately. I‚Äôd love higher customization on models.

I‚Äôm not sure this is completely accurate. It would mean the Majordomo Executus encounter in Molten Core gives no loot until Phase 2.

dude, let him pick what ever he wants. if he picks the most complex class and enjoys to play it then he will develop himself and his mind.
---
stop sugarcoating your kids
---
We need a single place for the RP community to find the Announcement of what the server will be. Maybe there can be a website.
---
This is very interesting, I'll have to d/l that add-on. Can confirm that there arent many level 40's running around on the PvE server. I didn't realize it was that low though.
---
I'm unironically planning on maining Balance for raiding, screw the haters, it can actually do decent dps if you know what you're doing and brings nice utility
---
I mean realistically what is the difference between RP-PVP and RP? If you want to RP the PVP just turn on the PVP flag.... if someone want to take a break from PVP and just do their RP boom turn the flag off.
---
A couple hidden quest chains throughout the game but one that stands out is an area in arathi highlands with a bunch of pirates. The quests weren‚Äôt quite in line with the level of the zone if I recall correctly, but hidden and fun!

When he does pushups, he doesnt push himself up, he pushes the earth down.

2.0.1 was in December but 2.0.0 was prior, dont think they were epic until later down the line but not sure
---
unexpected if you expect it to be the same as classic live
---
Gunna have to go with ungoro always my favorite place.
---
well.. it's not even out yet, and the beta content got exhausted pretty quickly because we all already know what to expect. The community should turn around when it's finally released. There will be more to talk about and more people contributing meaningfully to the conversation. Classic vs. retail arguments will definitely persist, but I'm optimistic they'll fade into background noise.
---
Imagine being so insecure about your favorite game's longevity that you have to keep spamming Reddit with shitty memes.
---
You know that is circular logic? No server, no EU, no EU, no server.
---
Love the quests and the just the area overall, just such a great atmosphere.
---
Man i can really see how misinformation spreads when people like you say ''Classic+ is 100% a done deal''. No it isn't. Moreover, you have NO SPECIAL INSIGHT whatsoever that would make it true. So formulating your speculations as fact. Say ''this is why I BELIEVE it is likely for them to make Classic+''. Cmon dude.
---
People are fucking blind if they don‚Äôt think layering is going to affect gameplay.
---
SHARDING 2.0 leggggoooooooo
---
honest question, what am I looking at?
---
So people just *pretend* to enjoy Classic? Ok
---
Because you‚Äôre blatantly lying. And it‚Äôs obvious to everybody, hence the downvotes. 
---
If you genuinely weren‚Äôt trying to be a douche, then edit your comment so you don‚Äôt look like a sarcastic prick. Read your original comment yourself, it spews sarcasm.
---
Came to write this, great watch.
---
2.0.0 never made it to the live servers.
---
Yes, but it's a fundamentally different way that people lack access to raid content. Compare Naxx to Dark Souls. Way more of the playerbase has completed dark souls than naxx, but naxx isn't as hard in a second to second sense as dark souls. I don't think it's wrong to think that there's something wrong with that kind of game design, actually. But it's hard to fix without creating new problems.
---
I agree! Everyone has the right to go out in the open world and kill whatever mob they want without dragging down others!
---
I have been playing on rppvp and will want to in classic as well. However none of those rules you mention exist anymore. They cant be enforced with the amount of people so they removed them. The one and only rule on rp servers is the naming rule thats all
---
You don‚Äôt front load your damage. Use your dots first and let the VW taunt. Immolation and SB spam should be your closers. 
---
When you do it right you will pull aggro and the mob dies at your feet.
---
They are doing exactly what they are invited for. Stress testing, population testing in subzones etc. Stop with the bashing for no reason. They won't influence your game one little bit.
---
Sorry for double replying. But I wanted to address the no changes thing. If those threads were all started in good faith that would be one thing. But the majority that I saw seemed to be started by anti classic trolls. Their world shattered when Blizzard announced classic, so they went to the forums suggesting ridiculous changes to try to make it seem like the classic community really didn‚Äôt want classic after all. 
---
So for better or worse, anyone suggesting changes for any reason got associated with those cretins and here we are. I imagine the same thing is what happened to the perception of anyone who wanted Classic because of the private server crowd you mentioned. 
---
But even in that case I have to point to the virtual prohibition of that game once TBC was released. Anytime you drive interest in something underground, you concentrate it‚Äôs negative elements. If Blizzard has kept legacy realms from the start..well, there‚Äôd still be animosity between different groups, but at least people wouldn‚Äôt have been barred from playing their preferred expansion.
---
Thanks, I'll hold off on Enchanting then in favor of something else.
---
Where before each pull all recite a prayer?
---
I use to play on Emerald Dream (RP-PVP) in retail. I had so much fun joining a World PvP and RP Guild. I really hope there‚Äôs at least one!
---
Uhh that‚Äôs not how you talk to people. Have a good day.
---
You also need an alchemist station to craft some of the higher level stuff, which is inside scholomance.  You'd have to get there and then also find a cleared instance to use it.
---
Classic ruined retail. Layering ruined Classic.
---
How come the hunter's pet's damage is not included? Or am I missing something? See  [https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Viewer/Default.aspx?id=33866&amp;exp=0&amp;upl=53798](https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Viewer/Default.aspx?id=33866&amp;exp=0&amp;upl=53798)
---
So you agree with "you think you do, but you don't." Gotcha.
---
And to be fair, you're probably right.
---
It still completely defeats the purpose of classic.
---
What happens when people get sick of BC? And what happens when people get sick of WOTLK? And what happens when people get sick of Cataclysm (1 day after launch)? 
---
Nope. 
---
The only possible way it could work is to just stick with classic forever. Releasing BC and WOTLK would fragment the retro community too much and there wouldn't be enough people left to do the high end content in vanilla, which it depends on.
---
If you're just going to keep releasing expansions, you might as well do seasonal retail servers/fresh realms. 
---
Really, the best solution is to simply make people want to play the latest retail game with no downsides. They need to restore all the content they removed from the game so that's no longer a motivator and then improve the systems so the game is more fun than it ever was.
---
All these threads really sell the whole "its not nostalgia mom!" arguments.  Literally nobody is debating the sentiment in this post, thats entirely historical and doesn't mention gameplay at all.
---
Guy makes a thread saying pick your class on what looks cool and feels fun in the first few levels and you burn hundreds of words on gameplay and raid viability, a 180 from the spirit of the thread.
---
Playing the ‚Äúpitiful me‚Äù act after you‚Äôre the one who comes into this thread being a sarcastic dick? Hilarious.
---
I love classic and can't wait for it.  Doesn't change the fact some of it's stuff is outdated.  Lets be honest late in classic molten core was basically LFR anyways.
---
might still early to call defeat, they might hopefully pull something out at the last moment.
---
It's called marketing
---
There are new specs discovered and theorycrafted almost weekly.  
---
Spelldamage DPS paladin, melee debuff hunter etc etc
---
God Bless.
---
As a Warlock, would you recommend tailoring or enchanting at end game? Im planning on going engi then picking one of these two after. Ill be doing every aspect of the game with raiding, pvp, farming and money making, etc. Also does this discussion change for a priest as opposed to a rogue?
---
Maybe he uses "high IQ person" unironically in a Trump way.
---
thanks for the big green circle, wouldnt of seen it otherwise.
---
&gt;Do you guys RP fights too and all that too
---
back in my day hillsbrad was all the RP PVP we needed!
---
Are RP-PvP servers just like the regular PvP servers in which you are restricted to and can only play one faction on the server?
---
Since I will be playing both once I resub, I'll join in to say something positive about each.
---
I enjoy retail environment creators. The zones typically look really nice, and I've enjoyed leveling even in the worst xpacs. The environment artists really do seem to be pushing their craft forward every time. It's pretty amazing for a game that can run on fairly weak computers.
---
In classic, I enjoy that leveling is an adventure, and often dangerous. It's not just a means for me to reach the actual game at the top. In classic I'm not the hero, commander of armies, that has saved the world several times over. I'm just a little guy starting out from humble beginnings, finding my way on an adventure.
---
Why are you booing me? I'm right!
---
im 100% rolling a druid as well. enchanting/skinning while leveling, drop enchanting at 265 after crafting  [https://classicdb.ch/?item=11811](https://classicdb.ch/?item=11811) for mining. drop skinning at 60 for learn engineering. get mining to 300 and engi to \~260 so you can use the reflectors. 
---
engineering isnt pvp only, goblin sapper charges are really good for aoe damage when tanking or dpsing. you can use them before the fight and pull them through or let the tank pull them through.
---
duskwood i can agree with but what was so fleshed out about redridge? i honestly dont remember besides the orcs invading and something about a blown up bridge or one under construction or something (like this big ass bridge leading to the lil dinky ass town)
---
I bet you'll play male as well just to be a special little snowflake!
---
You must be great at parties
---
Jeez dude you need to calm down. 
---
All I said is that‚Äôs not how you talk to people and you think I‚Äôm playing ‚Äúpitiful me‚Äù?
---
backtracking : the zone
---
Gotta imagine low level scaling and short window to level spiked the hunter compared to what we'll see with classic on launch.
---
For sure. So much value in having a mage in the party that was stripped away as the expansions rolled on.
---
damn gators
---
You're in a classic wow thread, friend. You're not going to meet any resistance to the idea that Warcraft 3 was amazing.
---
Ah that might be it then.
---
I wonder if they will add obtainability for the TCG items in Classic. Perhaps a contest, perhaps like the OG CE you get them if you have them on retail, or just leave them dormant.
---
Maybe they will use the love in the air shit, maybe they wont.
---
&gt; Blizzard usually fixes all of their bugs before an expansion releases
---
Every single expansion has been a dumpster fire of bugs and/or exploits at launch. There have been no exceptions.
---
You're a prick
---
Hand-Cannon is pre-bis, Blastershot Launcher is Phase 1 BIS because Rhok will not be in Phase 1 most likely. If you dont have Cromag Xbow by AQ, one of the guns is an alternative.
---
&gt; It's funny that layering is supposed to solve the issue of overcrowded starting areas, yet it, like, doesn't solve it.
---
layering literally has 0, nothing, to do with overcrowded starting areas.
---
That was sharding.
---
Nobody wanted sharding.
---
Layering is all about the server population health weeks after launch. It does nothing for starting areas.
---
I believe this is because Castsequence waits until you complete your cast to progress the macro to the next spell, whereas cast just keep hitting that spell which turns it in and off.
---
Guess I better go and fucking kill myself
---
Azshara. By the time I'm on sufficient lvl for azshara it will be lovely autumn where I live, making classic wow lvling ultimate cozy experience.
---
Yes, that‚Äôs exactly what you are doing. You knew your intentions when you made that comment. Don‚Äôt get mad when people call you out when you‚Äôre being sarcastic and rude.
---
If you think posting an innocent silly meme is "perpetuating a flame war" and poking fun and having a calm discussion is " spreading your hate" we sinners are all very sorry, but I dont think any gaming community can uphold such high christian standards you are used to ;)
---
Where do NE go after Ashenvale? Desolace through Stonetalon?
---
Feralas felt like a most abandoned plase in whole Azeroth at that time.  Being in that zone felt like you where alone in whole world ))
---
Why?
---
From what Ion said they have no intention to give another opportunity to get them. You can use the old codes in classic though if you have one that hasn't been used.
---
I loved Teldrassil so much as a kid that I wanted to pursue environmental design for video games as a career. I learned a lot about the video game industry in the following years and wound up in generic programming (with an underutilized skill set in AI) instead, but I still credit Teldrassil with kicking off my career. :)
---
Yep
---
But doesn't that make you somehow feel that you're forcing them into playing something that isn't their thing? The few extra days it will take them to get the same result aren't gonna make the difference in how they will experience classic. This is just an opinion. I started with 'Or' which means they can choose. No need to start a downvote war lol.. keep the classic spirit alive &lt;3
---
You throw another change at me, and I'm gonna lose it.
---
That's for the stress test. Everyone with a live subscription can get in.
---
Nobody on German Realms uses German Names.
---
They won't disappear when you're in the same group. W/o layering it would actually be harder to play together, because some can be unable to login on the same server
---
Not a batching issues. It seems like it's doing the damage in 1 second intervals relative to when the rogue entered the area of effect, rather than dealing the damage in 1 seconds intervals relative to when it was cast by the mage.
---
Can‚Äôt be surprised by information that doesn‚Äôt exist yet
---
Yeah that's what put me off leveling any more alts after Cata, ruined the whole of darkshore
---
&gt; means that every node of all of the layers had a 1 minute respawn ti
---
Each layer has a separate node, and separate re-spawn timer. There will be 100s, if not 1000s of layers. So at any given time, 1 node could be spawned and available to loot 100s or 1000s of times. All they need to do is swap to another layer where its current spawned. The re-spawn timers have nothing to do with this. If you still dont understand after this explanation im giving up.
---
Cute Human &gt; Cute Night Elf.
---
&gt; The server list could look like this at launch:
---
&gt; Silvermoon 1
---
&gt; Silvermoon 2
---
&gt; Silvermoon 3
---
&gt; Silvermoon 4
---
&gt; Bloodhoof 1
---
&gt; Bloodhoof 2
---
&gt; Bloodhoof 3
---
&gt; Bloodhoof 4
---
&gt; After the initial launch hype dies down, merge 1 and 2 to 1, then 3 and 4 to 2
---
So... layering?
---
I don‚Äôt have in on Mac. But on PC is there. Same account on both. Weird.
---
I‚Äôm not getting defensive. You guys are attacking me with name calling and I just don‚Äôt see why everyone is upset when I said my intentions are good. 
---
I don‚Äôt see why everyone is so mad when I have said countless of times I was being serious. I made the comment. I know what my intentions were.
---
For deep wounds you cant use it in a raid because it takes a debuff slot
---
THAT IS A 50DKP MINUSSSS
---
I've been using my quiver as a melee weapon with my pet having ADD and my feign death not working since Beta launch 
---
None of these problems have been fixed except the literal game breaking autoshot bug which only took a week
---
Blizzard clearly gives no fucks about hunters as was the case back in retail vanilla #nochanges
---
Majority of people posting won't make it past level 20. General chat is going to be fun.
---
What feels fun in the open world with infinite debuffs isnt what's fun in a 40 man setting. I'm not refering to viability at all. I wouldnt suggest ret or feral have good gameplay if I was just refering to viability.
---
Winterspring :)
---
&gt; players who want to take PvP seriously and competitively
---
Almost every serious pvper/ranker thinks spellbatching is retarded. No reason for artificial lag lowering the skillcap. There's a small minority that still believes its good but few people buy it.
---
Why is there always such a high warrior population? Does this count all characters created or only after a specific level?
---
You'll have to use macros for this.
---
Just about every one of them except Desolace and Blackrock Steppes. I hate huge dead zones with seemingly random placement of mobs and outposts that lack any kind of theme.
---
Server queues then
---
I was only getting 1-4 copper from em on test.
---
I played from the beginning of Wrath til the end of Cata, with very minimal raiding involved. I remember a fair amount about late Wrath as a DK and a warlock (I know DKs won't exist in Classic) and I remember a ton about my hunter throughout all of Cataclysm.
---
If I could go to a nonexistent Cataclysm only server that somehow wasn't dead, I'd do that in a heartbeat, but I want play WoW again in Classic because I miss the game overall and just can't see myself tolerating most of the new expansions. 
---
My question is, where would be the best source of information for me, for differences between Cata and Classic, and Wrath and Classic?
---
This needs attention ASAP
---
Not so much anymore but yes people did say this.
---
Yea, if they were not fixed back then, then don‚Äôt count on them being fixed.
---
I bought your Colgate toothpaste with tartar control and it make me feel, like a piece of SHIT!
---
Then edit your comment so it doesn‚Äôt look like you are being sarcastic. There‚Äôs a reason you‚Äôre getting attacked and downvoted. The original comment spews sarcasm. So edit it and try to make yourself not look like a dick, perhaps? Easy fix.
---
&gt;Their world shattered when Blizzard announced classic
---
Hyperbole much?  I think you may be overestimating how much people care about this.
---
&gt; I'd say the greatest difficulty of vanilla/TBC raiding was logistics and personnel.
---
100% the case.  The biggest cockblock in all of vanilla for my raid team was do we have enough warriors for 4 horseman and if not is there a guild we can borrow/steal from?  That and when c'Thun was mathematically impossible but I don't count that.
---
Yup didn‚Äôt even notice I typed layer.
---
Hahaha I like how that's 1 point feral but "balance druid". Nice touch.
---
The meta is known. What isnt known is how determined any particular guild might be to clear content 'hardmode'.
---
If private serve guilds are clearing every raid on the night they release, there is scope for a group of odd specs to clear everything while it is current.
---
Just have to realise that wipe nights happen and not be discouraged when they do.
---
Also remember than in vanilla you could only track one type of node at a time, so double gathering isn't as easy as it is in retail.
---
Humans need to release aggression against the out group. Better we invent harmless release valves like this than literally fucking murdering each other.
---
Google is a mighty and strong tool.
---
I am not sure about teh Raid tank.... I would definitely go reduce cool-down on Taunt and increase duration of Shield wall. I am not sure you need tactical mastery at all..... I dont see you much stance dancing.... maybe for fear??? but Dwarf priest or a tremor would do the job.
---
desolace and feralas
---
You're saying 'some will find it motivating, but a lot will just be frustrated' as if it's a bad thing. That mindset is exactly the problem. Frustration is a good thing. We live now in a culture where complaining gets you what you want, so if you complain there's a &gt;0% chance you might get what you want sooner rather than later without any effort. Those frustrated people are the ones that whined to Blizzard, and the problem is that Blizzard listened to them and as a result made all the shitty changes that ruined WoW to accommodate. The people that love vanilla/TBC still get super frustrated by the game, but they still play it because they also find it fun and they fight through their frustration and are rewarded for their effort.
---
And the people that get frustrated to the point where they quit, well I hate to break it to you, but it just means they didn't like the game in the first place and would have quit for some other stupid reason sooner or later.
---
Think of the Dota2 and the fact that most people that love it also fucking hate it. It's one of the most frustrating games ever made. But they still play because it's fun and fighting through that frustration is incredibly rewarding. The people that can't handle that frustration just don't find the game fun enough. The core of the game shouldn't be changed to accommodate those people that are on the brink on quitting.
---
Gold farmers will be back in business when WoW classic goes live.
---
Tauren male, orc male, human male
---
In TBC you had the introduction of a lot of catch up mechanics as well as isle badge gear giving damn near BIS items. I would say that is a shift in accessibility.
---
how about a warning for a 12500x8400 image...?
---
&gt; I remember Wildstar release
---
That‚Äôs because the game sucked and wasn‚Äôt at all as revolutionary and genre-changing as it was described, and the allure died off. 
---
We pretty much know how classic will play out already.
---
&gt;Historically, retail players have been enormously insecure even about the idea of Classic and spent years attacking the suggestion everywhere it popped up.
---
This isn't true. Most of the time the community response to the idea was indifference with 2 equally bitter fringe audiences who either insisted Classic is the greatest game ever made and has no flaws or that Classic is a waste of time and would kill the playerbase. The majority of people who post on r/wow, and you can go back and look at the annoucement thread as well, are some form of "cool, I'll try it out."
---
Any post on r/wow about Classic is mostly positive towards the game, meanwhile this sub has basically turned into "DAE hate retail and think Classic is the greatest game of all time?"
---
&gt;that are serviced by the same team from the same pool of resources.
---
They aren't.
---
I agree with your points. I will say though, that I don't think anyone can really blame Blizzard or the players at that time for wanting to move on with TBC and beyond. Legacy servers weren't really on the radar of the larger player-base back then. They make sense now, largely because of the state of retail, the age of the game, and for Blizzard, the declining sub numbers.
---
From Blizzard's perspective, it would have been crazy to try to juggle expansions and legacy servers when your game is growing at a crazy rate and people are buying up TBC/WotLK in droves.
---
And from a player-base stand-point, I'd argue most players saw TBC and Wrath as improvements on Vanilla, and private servers didn't really pick up until after Cata or even MoP. As far as the company and most of the players were concerned, legacy servers didn't really make sense until relatively recently.
---
&gt; increase duration of Shield wall
---
A minor buff to a 30 minute cd aint the way
---
It is a lowest priority debuff so will never push others off. Just leave one slot for all your warriors and you good.
---
You need impale for dem crits ......
---
Why don't they just make unofficial servers for each language? It would suck for the few people not paying attention but I don't see it being an issue with some organization.
---
I‚Äôm gonna assume they want it for the same reason a lot of people like PvP servers: the ever looming threat of your enemy faction ruining your quest or group‚Äôs adventure gives the RP side of things a constant uncontrollable variable.
---
Damn alliance dominated the population on the PvP beta server
---
Durids get two meme specs, not fair
---
Imp shield wall generally not recommended for a main tank
---
I'm sorry but it's unlikely there are more players now than back in vanilla. Towards the end of vanilla start of BC there was 6 or 8mill+ I believe. Now we're lucky if even 3mill are subbed world wide.
---
Asking the real question
---
Don't worry. Apparently PS have been over estimating feral damage. So that one can just be considered an ultra meme spec in its own category.
---
You should be able to. I already downloaded it.
---
Maybe you should just read it differently or just block me. I‚Äôm not going to take advice from someone as toxic as yourself. 
---
I‚Äôll take the downvotes because I said what I said. If you want to get that mad about a comment that‚Äôs intended for good then that‚Äôs on you.
---
No, you know what I meant. So I'm not going to.
---
I just want to say thanks for the balanced reply and I'm in agreement with you on that too.
---
&gt;let's not forget the erasure you're engaging in by completely forgetting to mention the years upon years of being told in to a corner by shit like the wall of no copy-paste and Blizzard themselves "you think you do but you don't".
---
God I remember those times. They rounded us up like cattle, put us on trains and sent us to work camps. Why? Because we wanted legacy servers.
---
Get a grip dude.
---
No, they aren't gonna fix anymore bugs, the beta is finished. /s
---
It all depends how popular Classic is. If it turns out that Classic causes a 1 million sub count increase and sustains itself for 2-3 years then I absolutely believe you're right. If however it middles somewhere around 50k, which is entirely possible (just under half this sub) then I wouldn't be so sure about it being a revival of MMOs, merely it would prove to Blizz that they can run their old content alongside their new stuff so we would probably see TBC realms, Wotlk realms, etc etc.
---
I get sick when I see this flag
---
I personally think vanilla WoW was one of the best experiences overall if you don't play it like a full time job and expect to "dominate" the game.. because it's actually fucking easy if you play it that much and there is almost no competitive aspect outside of first to clear Naxx maybe. The PvP is almost entirely "just for fun" and rank 14 is mostly controlled by people exploiting the system and has very little to do with skill and just playtime.
---
TBC will be a much better experience for streamers and no life types because of arena I think.
---
Layering is here to help with overpopulation and your idea makes sense if everyone play alone and just pick one of those servers randomly but in reality silvermoon 1 will be streamer server and 90% of all silvermoon servers will be there.
---
I would drop imp shield bash for imp taunt for the dungeon build. You are going to be speaking taunt a lot.
---
I agree. The thing is most people bring up private server launches as if it's indicative of the Classic launch experience with a multitude of servers compared to the one or two that private servers launch with.
---
 If they keep layering in the game till phase 2 they will ruin the community aspects as well as the economy.
---
It increases the oh shit window by 50%. From a pure mitigation build I don't see any other talents that would help you "mitigate"
---
It gives the raid an extra 5 sec of enrage DPS. or Healers to recover mana.
---
I wasn't aware this conversation was about how to server first lvl 60 priest.
---
Which by the way I have done the race to server first 60 priest (i got 2nd, cry).
---
In any event if you're going for server first you aren't solo lvling on priest unless you're an idiot.
---
Ugh no i don't think you understand it xD
---
Lol the snap was sent to me otherwise I would‚Äôve posted the source material
---
disclaimer:  Battlegrounds and the honor ranking system won't be available until phase 3 when WSG and AV are released. If you're interest is in PvP right from the beginning, your best bet is to get pre-raid BiS gear and raid.
---
disclaimer 2: there is gear that can be acquired through PvP. However, resilience wasn't a stat at the time, so the stats on pvp acquired gear don't give any inherent advantages.  Except for trinkets, those are pretty much necessary.
---
Once the honor system is released, you'll be able to grind through the ranks and unlock some pvp specific gear. Reputation grinding with the battlegrounds will also allow you access to some gear.
---
At the beginning, I think the PvP grind will be worth it. But once people start doing battlegrounds with AQ40 and Naxx gear, it'll be harder to compete.
---
grizzly hills
---
High five. Sorry if my previous reply sounded condescending, it wasn't meant to be. I was actually typing up as many as I could think of in the original comment then just decided to make a lame joke
---
i think you really need to be a mage to solo naxx
---
Jokes on you, I'll be playing a Ret Pally and running a Catholic guild
---
The have a sweet 2h 360 animation on specials, fem tauren war is bis
---
Absolutely if we are looking at main tank threat builder there are better point spenders..... the OP indicated this as a max mitigation build.
---
Every expansion after wrath experienced tourist fall off. Stop being a smooth brain.
---
Cut the batch length in half. We'll still get double polymorphs (although fewer), but it was noticed the batches are too large *very* early on.
---
But they're always random right?
---
I'm not sure what you're trying to say.
---
God this shit is old. Get over it. Or wait til layering has been removed to play. The rest of us will enjoy playing instead of being stuck in queues eveey day at 3pm
---
There is a massive RP community.
---
 I'm not sure what you're trying to say.
---
not everyone has gotten an email, have multiple friends that got access confirmed it. 
---
Also "xD"
---
Shield wall is already 10 seconds long, which is plenty long enough. Tanking isn't all about mitigation, anyways. No one takes imp shield wall.
---
&gt; Why should I listen to the judgement of a company that has failed its fanbase time and time again?
---
Then why are you in a sub based on the game that company (the one you think has failed you time and time again) is releasing?
---
Move on.
---
Thank you
---
The classic community definitely needs to be more progressive and inclusive.
---
Roffle Mayo!
---
You're describing layering with more steps.
---
For complexity feral druid might be, i havent played one myself but heard they can go real crazy with the rotation, need confirmation tho.
---
Mindsets back then do not equal mindsets now though. The majority of people back then had no idea what to expect at all, now however there usually isn't anything that drops in an MMO that really surprises anyone and we get the general idea of min maxing even in a game we've never played and don't know the specifics.
---
ü¶Ä$15ü¶Ä
---
Who is asking for 5k plus? High pop servers and full back in vanilla were 2k to 2.5k. That's more than enough to populate a realm. 
---
I played at release on a high pop server. Day 2 when we could finally play there were 2k people or so on the server. I never had much of an issue as a night elf hunter. 
---
If they keep layering in the game till phase 2 they will ruin the community aspects as well as the economy.
---
Nah that‚Äôs overplayed, it‚Äôs more the preparation required,
---
Yeah but retail people love to act like they know for a fact we will get on classic and suddenly realize oh wait I actually don't like this. They ignore that we played vanilla in its entirety and have played private servers multiple times in the past 5 years. We KNOW what it's like and that's what we want and those retailers just don't get it
---
I haven‚Äôt played beta since hitting 30, and I won‚Äôt log on again till it‚Äôs live. 
---
I leveled up the class I know best, reported bugs. I don‚Äôt want to spoil the game for myself or a temporary character
---
dude can we not trash people for what they like to play
---
Voila the server communities that might have been built won't ever get a chance. We get BFA problems in a Vanilla game. 
---
True dat my dude.
---
They said you are assigned a layer upon character creation, but there's a bug where you create an alt which if it goes into another layer, you can switch your main character to the alts layer, but a bug, nothing more. So the only legit way to switch layers is if someone invites you from there, and you move back to your own once you leave the group
---
People aren‚Äôt attacking and downvoting you for no reason. Your original comment read like sarcasm, looked like sarcasm, and sounded like sarcasm. To multiple people. If it was intended for good, then word it like it was intended for good. Or don‚Äôt, i don‚Äôt really care. Just trying to help you out on the slim chance that you don‚Äôt understand sarcasm and had good intentions. No one in here is downvoting you for no reason.
---
This video being posted is one of the harbingers of the apocalypse.
---
Fake news
---
I thought he gave loot prior to 1.3 just no quest items.
---
Where do you get that from? High pop servers back in the day were 2k to 2.5k. The only reason people think 5 or 10k is normal is because they've never known better. The only people advocating 10k on a server are people who've only played Nostalrius. 
---
Look at the points I made instead of this point you keep wanting to argue. 
---
When you want to join the discussion other people are having, let me know.
---
I haven't heard this anywhere yet. Is this speculation on your part based on private server launches or do you have a source from Blizzard?
---
Oh you don‚Äôt really care? 
---
Just trying to help? Yea keep calling me names. Good help.
---
That sounds good to me. Thanks.
---
Oh boy gaslighting. This subreddit is famous for it. You think it's poking fun, and some of it might be, but every problem starts somewhere all all the gaslighting, passive aggressive comments and full on admission of looking for a 'victory' over live WoW players says that it's not just poking fun.  
---
Careful of that first step off your high horse, it's a doozy.
---
That's irrelevant.
---
&gt;I know it won't be as smooth when there is 1000's of people trying to do the same, which is why this is a video that show you the quest I plan to do and in which order.
---
Issue #1
---
- the first quest you pick up, Coldridge Valley Mail Delivery, is not available from Shen Stoutarm until you complete Dwarven Outfitters, which will be camped as fuck.

Please don't use incorrect private server quest databases to plan out your Classic leveling route. It's just not going to work out well.
---
In middle school I wasn‚Äôt allowed to play wow. I would buy a four pack of monster every monday then mon-thurs I‚Äôd wait for my parents to go to sleep and escape downstairs to play wow with a cold monster. I‚Äôd stay on til 3 then sleep all throughout class. This is how I developed my wow and caffeine addiction.
---
Hunter is an easy class plus he gets to tame his favorite animals throughout leveling in the world
---
People going to exploit it big time that will have lasting damage to the economy of the server.
---
haha it's COMPLETELY different. I actually extracted all the sounds from that MPQ unpacker.
---
IIRC, TCG rewards won't be in-game. So don't do it. It will only be usable in retail.
---
Most of the streamers will be on before most of us I bet. So if that's the case you could always chose a different server.
---
Always need BoE blues, and tell the group that at the start.
---
I enjoy retail and imagine I‚Äôll enjoy classic. Probably play both.
---
I literally just tried to help you without calling you a single name. You didn‚Äôt take my advice. Have a good day.
---
Druid has to farm all the same consumes as every other melee dps AND the crowd pummeler, not the same thing .
---
I know how you feel
---
Isn't that a bit defeatist? I have a very hard time believing that there'll be less than 20k playing this regularly. 
---
Even medium servers back in the day with their 1k to 1.5k concurrent players had healthy economies and communities.
---
No, the quest items were added the same time his reward chest was, in [patch 1.4](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.4.0):
---
&gt; When Majordomo Executus submits, a chest is spawned next to him. This chest should only spawn the FIRST time he is defeated in a saved instance. If a guild tries him a second or third night, no chest should spawn.
---
Since content from patches 1.3 and 1.4 are being rolled into Phase 2, Molten Core and Onyxia will either be missing a lot of loot, or they'll be using Phase 2 loot tables for all content available in Phase 1.
---
\#1 thats not what he said. im specifically referring to his statement.
---
\#2 i agree and disagree with you
---
While hardcore gamers are going to research and look into games long before they come out.... you are forgetting the silent majority. I call them the silent majority, because they arent on reddit, they arent googling all the info they can find. They are joining communities to discuss and theory craft.... they might be what you consider "casuals". So yes, the mindset of the live for gaming gamers is changed, i wouldnt agree that it has changed across the board onto the "casuals"
---
Again, I am working within the OP parameters. Yes I agree raid main tank should worry about threat more, but OP asked a particular question I am answering it.
---
C-C-C-Combobreaker!
---
Skarm has an excellent video about this, which also covers Shaman tanking...
---
https://youtu.be/tmlcHhlDLVw
---
You will not be getting 30k players per server. That's insane. That's over 10 times the highest pop servers in vanilla.
---
We should have a rule on the sub not to start petitions imo.
---
I'd let firstly him choose himself, but make sure to inform him of the inns and outs of that class. There's a ton of great videos that go into this on YouTube.
---
I know you said you just found it, but its been shared around this subreddit a ton.
---
Just FYI.
---
Khaz Modan was my first server too! Didn‚Äôt start til TBC but I started with The Blood Angels
---
Was healing much weaker in vanilla pvp?
---
I tried some healers on these instant 60 servers. The damage seems so high, everything is just blowing up or i go oom.
---
I was going to say that the people who download an addon like this probably aren't representative of the actual population, but I see it just regularly runs /who queries and consolidates the info of everyone it finds.  In that case this is interesting information!  
---
I'm not surprised that only a small fraction of the beta pop hit level 40 already, as that is definitely how it will be come release with higher levels.
---
Is it not a "low priority" debuff?
---
You dont think people will do that? Remember in Legion when people completely DESTROYED the leather markets on servers? That's the problem with layering. It's going to destroy the economy and will dampen any community.
---
Let me just go through and count all the insults you called me before you ‚Äúliterally tried to help‚Äù
---
But you said you don‚Äôt care. But you‚Äôre trying to help. Interesting.
---
At least you realize it. Hopefully that makes you have an objective opinion. Not just here but everywhere. 
---
The other big problem is the mass downvoting that occurs ...
---
Yeah, feels like an action game nowadays. I absolutely love playing my demon Hunter and I think it's the most fun I've ever had in combat. But outside of m+ and heroic/mythic raids it is way too easy. They storyline is better I'd argue and the lore is great...but the community rpg element is gonezo. Nothing is as immersive as classic wow and it'll always be my favorite. The combat isn't the best or most balanced, but that's part of the fun once you learn your limitations.
---
This is why I ask, I am not sure how useful it actually would be? (especially if alliance?)
---
It ruins immersion
---
Good call I think actually. Shield Bash seems decent, but will need to taunt more in dungeons! Thanks.
---
If you avg the dps of hunters warlocks and mages throughout the content, it's about even.
---
Odd Groups got left, Even Groups got right. That means 1,3,5,7 left; 2,4,6,8 right; 7&amp;8 are whelp groups. I know the whole thing it‚Äôs scary.
---
Man, I've already explained this to you in another comment. Why are you so insistent 
---
&gt; first Blizzard tick only puts him in combat
---
Look at the second example. You can see "+Combat" appear exactly one frame AFTER he takes damage.
---
&gt; Spell batching here is working as intended
---
Still, as I said to you before. Unless you work for Blizzard, I have no reason to believe you.
---
RP-PvP'er here. Roleplayers are extremely elitist about RP'ing, just FYI.
---
It will. However, it will affect less (for non-streamers) than server merges or eternal queues or dead servers.
---
When people say this, or, this question gets asked all the time, people fail to realise that not everyone spends as much time on Reddit to see every single post, I spend a lot of time on here and this is the first time over ever seen it. :)
---
It's all about longevity. The more packed the servers are to start the more likely they are to still have 2-3k players 2 years from now. 
---
There are two ways to go at the launch rush, which will be compounded by BFA players having a look around.
---
1. Loads of servers that end up dead in less than a year, followed by server mergers and people losing names as the are doubled with other servers.
---
2. Layers, we put up with a sub par plan for a couple of months till the "look about" players drop out then we carry on with our lives in busy servers that feel alive.
---
Do I like layering? No
---
Is layering the best of a shitty situation? Yes.
---
I had Mandokir's raptor
---
It most certainly is?
---
Go under the hunters damage, all the damage from "autoattack" is from the pets.
---
Thank you. Seems pretty similar to what I was going for!
---
*95.468%
---
Badges were ridiculously slow catch up mechanics. Vanilla also had catch up mechanics, that's what Zul Gurub and Aq20 were. 
---
Badge gear was never bis. The gear was slightly better than kara gear iirc. There was no content invalidation in TBC, you had absolutely 0 ways to skip Karazhan entirely.  There was catch up, in no situation can you, a fresh 70, be more qualified to join a TK SSC guild than a person who's been raiding Karazhan. 
---
Even MGT which awarded tk and SSC gear was only unlocked in the final stage of the Isle progress and again it was massively time gated. I only ever remember being able to purchase the robes.
---
Because the last time around you were wrong, and this time around you're still wrong. This thread is just less of an echo chamber than the last one.
---
Plus, admittedly, in the last thread I initially missed the fact that the first Blizzard tick does no damage, which is what's causing the apparent delay.
---
Are you saying most of the players will play Classic because they want to play with their favorite streamer? In that case, there will be queues on Silvermoon 1...
---
You and your friends could perfectly pick one server and play on it, so I'm not sure what your argument is.
---
Layering is there to help with overpoplation, but Blizzard has also shifted their focus to also use layering to solve the problem of overpopulated areas. This is why exploiting, or random layer hopping has become an issue.
---
Correct. I think a lot of people think it will push others off from private servers but it is a low priority debuff and basically every warrior should eventually be using it.
---
Orc female has the best proportions, but not very good hair options. They're all variations on bald, and the knee full head of hair has tons of clipping issues.
---
Undead Female have the best animations period though. I think if I were to pick one based solely on animations it would be this one.
---
Where do you get that from?  In the second quarter of Vanilla there was 3.5 million players. Quite likelt that's more subscriptions than are currently active in BFA. 
---
But okay cmon.
---
Except multiple of the biggest streamers have already confirmed they will be attempting to hide the server they are playing on. So when that gets leaked a day or two later and you just so happen to be on their server, have fun.
---
There were more active subs in wow in 2005 than there are in 2019. So not sure what you're on about.
---
That‚Äôs cool...but mandokir‚Äôs raptor didn‚Äôt look anything like that.
---
Dip sets while you wait for BG queues
---
IIRC: trinkets yes, everything else no.
---
Boom added
---
ANAL [Destruction]
---
Or are talents not allowed?
---
Could you explain how that justifies anything?
---
Faster cast time and base damage is higher until more spell power plus he uses earth shock right after so EM affects both chain/shock.
---
I thought so. It seems a solid threat increasing talent.
---
Thing is they're all going to be on the same server. So the likelihood of that happening is low. Regardless a quick /Who Asmon/Soda/Chance and you're good.
---
I was a lock, all my friends were so jealous lol
---
I started when I was 9 years old in early 2006/ late 2007. I played a hunter because my big bro did and I played a shaman because I saw the unbreakable pvp video lmao. Neither of them got 60 but I was close! I used to listen to the unbreakable video and PvP back in the day and hope for windfurys. I just had fun playing the game back then and I bet your son will too :).
---
Just tell him what each class does and let him pick and just enjoy your time together!
---
No, but it did math my dps warrior clownsuit + hand of rag combo well.
---
I've seen it linked, and I have linked it myself when I see threads based around "looking for old friends"
---
Or if someone comes around and goes "wouldn't it be cool if there was a way to find old friends".
---
Eventually, this site gets linked.
---
But now you know about it, be sure to share it! Spread the word!
---
As an aside: I do the same with the [Classic WoW Guilds](https://discord.gg/dGbTtEj) discord.
---
You make some good points. For one, a lot of people complain over momentary frustrations. Secondly, some frustration is good. Overall I think classic does a good job balancing effort with rewards. On the other hand though, there is such a thing as over doing it and when you're running a sub based mmo, you've got to fo what it takes to keep the lights on. Blizzard's biggest problem was two fold: their core base was getting older and their competitors were trying to snag the lions share of casual players from underneath them. As the core base aged, many of them lost the ability to keep up with the demands of old school RPGs and thus wanted a way to be a part of the game they enjoyed while scaling back the time commitment. This lead to dungeon finder, heirloom items and eventually spiraled out of control. 
---
Meanwhile, every mmo that came out innovated on wow's design, but they could never compete with the attachment so many people felt to wow already. Even popular universes like KOTOR couldn't break wow. It's been 15 years and only now is the game really starting to stumble. 
---
I don't disagree at all about frustration=satisfaction, but everything has limits. I like to play some games on max difficulty, but some games are more enjoyable to just coast through because their difficulty levels go from challenging to micro seconds to react or you die. I think classic is challenging without having to have a PhD in wow to enjoy the game and retail in pretty sure people routinely put themselves in follow on raid finder :)
---
Wrong. Melee leeway does not apply to deadzone.
---
Players who invest more time into the game should be rewarded for it. This is one of the problems many players have with modern wow item-wise, as it can forge and whatnot while little time has been invested.
---
What is the best website to download add-ons for Classic?
---
Have you never heard of privates servers?  This stuff is all figured out, unless those servers got it significantly wrong.
---
L2 search has been well documented

I see you never did isle badge gear. It was dam near BIS. The only weapons better than the isle gear dropped in SWP iirc.
---
Actually after SWP and isle, you could skip all of t4 entirely and go straight into t5 content. Granted you‚Äôre right it was time gated but it was very possible to level and gear a new chat and skip the first raid tier collectively.

Frost mages literally just frostbolt...
---
Asmon and Soda have both confirmed they are likely to be hiding their identity and which server they are playing on, which means that they aren't going on a dedicated streamer server. And just because someone has the name Asmon or Soda on a server doesn't mean it's them. That name is going to be taken and used on literally every single server.
---
&gt;In the OP's video the debuff application matches up perfectly with the Blizzard tick going off.
---
While I'm not writing off the possibility that this is what's happening, I don't really see why or how this would be the case. I'm at least somewhat certain that Blizzard does and always has functioned as a ground AOE that only exists while you channel it, so that the application of the debuff is caused by the ground effect, not by the actual player directly. So basically even if blizzard ticked once every 4 seconds or something, you'd still get the debuff upon entering, but the game doesn't check your position instantly so there is some delay upon entering or exiting.
---
If it is in fact waiting for a tick to apply the debuff that is a problem, and it's possible that is the case, but I'm not entirely convinced yet.
---
What do you have against emojis?
---
I mean, I'm fairly certain I'll be able to get my mount at 40 and I've played very little on private servers and haven't memorized shit. You just have to be willing to learn.
---
Nope, none of that will happen. Communities and the economy will be ruined without layering because there won't be enough people on the server to make it function properly.
---
Well yes and no. I'm describing a way to use layering in a different way that might be more appropriate. The idea is that you *cannot* switch in between layer's, essentialy making each layer a *virtual server* that shares player data with each layer on that server.
---
I plan to play warrior and shaman with my friend pulling elites and killing them using windfury totem. Although not quite sure where we shall do this yet.
---
Is this a good idea with regard to levelling fast than us both playing solo/ out of group.
---
Even pirate client side data can't be trusted. See: [Gnomes are too big thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bs1eyk/gnomes_are_way_bigger_than_vanilla_and_i_hate_new/) and blizzard [proving it wrong with the true client.](https://www.wowhead.com/news=291928/more-entries-for-the-wow-classic-not-a-bug-list-gnomes-and-tauren-correct-size)
---
I'd like to know this too. All I see in the launcher for WoW is this:
---
https://i.imgur.com/zaeJp8g.jpg
---
A few things to note:
---
- I do not have a current active sub.
---
- I do not currently have WoW retail installed.
---
- I am in the EU region, not US.
---
- I am signed up for the beta (although I understand I will probably never be invited without an active sub).
---
Any ideas which, if any, of these would be affecting my ability to see the option to download (or at least see) the classic client?
---
Sometimes when I hit that gap I try to finish the Defias quests anyway and repeatedly die.
---
Thats exactly what I am doing :)
---
It‚Äôs a great tool. I reunited not only with my old guild (30 members) but also with guilds from my old server, both from horde and alliance.
---
Anyone from the Tarren Mill EU is welcomed to join our discord(sent me a PM if interested)
---
People keep talking about tourists and BFA players. Do you really think out of the 1.5million active subs currently there's going to be that much of a problem? Vanilla had 3.5mill in February 2005 and climbed steady. 
---
I wouldn't have so much of an issue with Layering if they fix the massive issues with it. Which I doubt. The Legion trading materials crash is a stark reminder of how this will affect the economy.
---
Hunter‚Äôs are broke, no faith in blitz to fix, pet AI has been broke since legion/bfa and it‚Äôs still broke. Does that answer your question?
---
Nope, back then in 1.3 the chest only dropped 1 item. And none of the items on his current loot table even existed.
---
My memory is fuzzy but I believe he would just give us a piece of tier gear back then. They are going to need to change something. Using 1.3 loot tables creates a lot of design holes/problems that would need to be addressed and is just horrible for raiding in general.
---
And how's that gonna work exactly? Are you under the impression that there won't be tonnes of players not knowing/caring that will play on it and using the general chat etc for whatever type of conversation they feel like?
---
So have they confirmed they won't be streaming? It'll take 5 minutes to find them if they do. There's literally no way to hide it if they're streaming it.
---
So I dinged my rogue on the beta server last week, and was able to get my mount the very next day. The lockpicking grind alone generates a fair amount, but most of my mount money came from selling loot on the AH and questing. It's amazing the difference actually knowing what I'm doing has made in that regard. I ran multiple pickpocketing runs in SM to get lockboxes with Master if Deception spec'd, it just didn't seem as lucrative as knocking out some quests would have been. 
---
The issue is when you get Lock Picking up to about 155, it takes multiple worn lockboxes per level. Mobs at 40 start dropping sturdy lockboxes that require 175. It's quite the grind.
---
I can't remember about what to do at higher levels. I do remember you can pick the SM doors at 175, which will get you a few more levels.
---
hunters are so much fun in pvp, leveling, and the vibe of the class is sick af
---
stop thinking so much and have fun
---
I didn't create WIM for vanilla, only made some minor fixes and improvements. The codebase is huge (much larger than it needed to be imo) and rather spaghettiish so I'm not masochistic enough (or have enough time, frankly, to port it. Besides, there's WIM in retail too which might be even easier to port (and might even be ported by its author).
---
Because Warriors are Gods in Vanilla.
---
The threat a warrior does isn't based on AP at all almost. Rage generation &gt; everything
---
All of which are most definitely shite.
---
Shimmering flats is mostly just a huge open area filled with beasts. Great for skinning, and not too dangerous since there are so many non-aggressive turtles.
---
It's a great place for skinning.
---
I love the pirates in Tanaris
---
Tanaris. Dunno why but I had the best time there and zul farrak was great!
---
I don't see how that makes sense. Even low pop servers back in the day had healthy communities and economies. Do you really expect there to be a multitude of servers with sub 500 players playing? That's extremely defeatist and plain ignorant in my opinion.
---
Except the moonkin... after a few spells they kinda just stand there
---
Even with the best efforts you're not gonna suddenly push a 400 DPS class on par with other 1000+ DPS classes I'm afraid. There are only so many consumables you can use to try and patch the holes in the vanilla balance.

---
It's actually  "Uber 1337 h4x"
---
&gt; Look at the second example. You can see "+Combat" appear exactly one frame AFTER he takes damage.
---
The damage on his unit frames and damage text is desynced, yes. I didn't notice that before. I don't know what this exactly means; it could be that he's using a battle text addon that has some delay on it, or it could be some quirk in the spell batching implementation. Either way, the majority of the delay here is caused by the first Blizzard tick not dealing damage or slowing him.
---
But that's what I'm saying, his statement is right even if a little under explained. You don't honestly believe the average gamer in the Vanilla beta had the same understanding of the context of min/maxing as the average gamer these days do you? When people play betas now they want to be competitive, lots have dreams of being the next big star even if it's just dominating their server. Back in Vanilla beta people were just dumbfounded at the scale of the game.  
---
To continue my point about the average gamer now vs back then, now it's real easy to get the odd pieces of trickle down knowledge from other players. That is to say general conversations that let them know "This is really good for your class because your class does/needs X/Y" We have Reddit, WoW forums, Discords, Twitter, Youtube (Youtube content now is not like Youtube content then) so even if you're a complete casual who only sits in guild chat and reads absolutely \*nothing\* about the game outside of the game, you will gain little bits of knowledge in guild chat, party chat, /1s, etc because this knowledge is \*\*everywhere\*\* in Vanilla it wasn't really something you would just stumble upon. You had the WoW forums, a handful of external forums (Elitist Jerks, Thottbot, suchlike) and that was really it. A lot of video content focused purely on the wow factor of WoW, big raids that nobody had ever really imagined would be a thing, and funny machinima videos, stuff like that. Now if you search for WoW on Youtube you will be hard pressed not to stumble upon a video that doesn't mention some form of concept like min/maxing.
---
Great ideas!
---
TIL: there are no PVP servers in EU any more on retail. I just wanted to kill some time until classic so I was planing leveling a warrior to max level with only doing battlegrounds. I was told this is possible but yeah. I was looking for a pvp server and wtf...there aren‚Äòt any?? Only pve and rp-pve
---
Yup, it works. Usually in PvP I'm so DoT'd up by $#@!'ing warlocks that it doesn't help much. I'm really missing CoS...
---
Your plan will fail.
---
Can we get a source on this? 
---
Last I checked frost tabards were $1k+ but now sold out
---
But might have to stock a Flame code
---
for me it was the fact that someone in 2019 cant rotate an image. borderline retarded.
---
Except it can't be exploited in order to avoid pvp/farm additional nodes, and you don't break the illusion of a single cohesive world. You know, the two most malignant aspects of layering.
---
Congrats, your static layer happens to have 90% player drop in week 2.
---
A second static layer has only 10% player drop.
---
With layering, you'd have 100% pop server.
---
Instead, with static layers, you're spending the next X weeks on a dead server.
---
I plan on running a guild. I have progression raiding experience from wotlk, but not in vanilla.
---
I hear a lot about resist gear in vanilla. Who has to get resist gear, and for what encounters?
---
WHELPS, MANY WHELPS, HANDLE IT
---
&gt;I see you never did isle badge gear. It was dam near BIS. The only weapons better than the isle gear dropped in SWP iirc.
---
&gt;Even Isle badge gear which awarded bt mhj gear was only unlocked in the final stage of the Isle progress and again it was massively time gated.
---
Can charm pets above level as well..that was never in vanilla.
---
Yeah yeah yeah, say something to the Shaman though. You wont. They never do.  No one dares face the Winds Fury.
---
I dont remember a german saying TM... they either said DM or Todesminen.
---
You'll level a bit slower than you would as a solo but you'll have a lot more fun doing it I'm sure. If nothing else you'll have a friend beside you to chat shit to whilst you level and break down the tediousness.
---
you could have just kept this sarcastic comment to yourself, no need for that
---
I think that PoM Pyro is the ultimate glass cannon.
---
The funny thing is, once they announced layering this sub totally flipped on this message.
---
Before layering, If you thought the game would lose a lot of people after the first two months you were hater.
---
Once layering announced, this sub started saying "No guys layering is great because the population is going to die off after two months so it's not even a big deal they won't need layering after the first couple months!"
---
It's still going to have battle.net integration so it wouldn't be THAT much of a hassle though.
---
Soda said he likely won't be streaming. Asmon has said he'll be attempting to hide which server he's playing on, not sure if he will stream it.
---

And fixing the stuttering and fluctuating frame rates on modern hardware

There aren't that many great places yet, there's a website called: [willitclassic.com](https://willitclassic.com) that is updating it's database on what add-ons do/do not work.
---
Pvp on a huntard with leeway and DR on scatter and trap. Oh almost forgot pvp FD is resisted in classic. 
---
Hunters are broke.
---
Which will be necessary for the realms to have healthy populations long term when 90% of the launch day players quit.
---
Omg, had me going for a while and then it was just another post about layering, dammit!
---
1.5 million. What's the source of that estimate? I can't find any agreement on a number. 
---
That aside, I think we can agree that busy servers are better, with that in mind and the fact players do expect different things from games now, I'd opt of crammed servers at launch. 
---
I'm sure blizzard are looking at layering in depth during beta for the very reasons people are arguing against it, to iron out these problems.
---
On the contrary! Both melee hunter and spelldamage paladin has higher uptime on debuffs and such than regular debuffers.
---
Mainly talking Nightfall.
---
You were probably going up against people in high tier/R14 gear, the stat differences are huge and you couldn't really be expected to keep up.
---
I see you're a fellow Trogg murderer.
---
Talking about retail classic right? Should probably just use classic
---
I haven't looked up any guides but want to try warrior. Is this a good strategy to leveling? I'm not sure how good green-level XP is in classic.
---
It wasn‚Äôt sarcasm
---
Probably Youtube? You'll have to click a lot of the clickbaity videos but I can already see the thumbnails for "TOP 10 DIFFERENCES IN CLASSIC WOW YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO KNOW"
---
Since BFA with the introduction of warmode, all servers are now both pve and pvp servers with the push of a button. You can find it in the pvp tab.
---
Why‚Äôs that?
---
Being in the military and a fitness junkie I like this idea a lot. PvP scenarios won‚Äôt effect me a lot since I PvE, might add something for wipes per dungeon = xx. Maybe add different values for different reasons.

~~orangemanbad~~ twitchmanbad

Paladins and hunters using nightfall has been the meta for years. Paladins and hunters just refuse to ever do it and would rather be useless attempting to do DPS than contribute to the raid.

---
I've seen a blue post somewhere that confirmed there is no wall jumping, can't remember the exact quote but it was something to do with the systems they use nowadays for anti cheat.
---
I love the zones that are a bit out of the way like Feralas, Azshara and if you are alliance, the Swamp of Sorrows. Also really like the Wetlands, great ambience and music.
---
I think you are confusing toxic with normal.
---
You have no idea what toxic actually mean.

Ha I thought it was only me. I understand engineering is meant to be great, but I really want to herb/alc from a character point of view. Might just do it, I mean, I'm leveling balance so . . .
---
I love Winterspring. I was playing Vanilla with my roommate and my GF and we had been in the plaguelands for what seemed like forever. 
---
The GF said "I don't want to play here anymore, it's so ugly". Okay cool, let's look at the other zones.... hey there's a high level zone all the way on the other continent we can check out. So we trekked across the world and eventually made to to Winterspring. It was so peaceful, tranquil, and beautiful. We stayed there until we hit 60. It is a fantastic zone.
---
No information has been given out about this yet
---
Because it would be really hard to send a message saying they can't join now because they're in combat and to try inviting them later, and sending another saying so-and-so tried to invite you to a group but you were in combat.
---
If they‚Äôre broken does it mean pets _won‚Äôt_ continue to chase rogues after vanish?
---
I'm quite sure that it has been said somewhere but I can't really remember where. But there is also a [forum post](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/tcg-mounts-and-pets/199459/39) that states that there won't be any tcg items in classic it seems. Just seen it mentioned somewhere else. I'd trust that for now.
---
ppl saying they wont play confirm blizz idea that classic wont be sucessfull enough to financially justify language servers, as it might be the main point for them not planning specific language servers
---
They were out when Vanilla released but they were still expensive as hell relatively speaking.
---
A lot of people started it on a CRT and went to a LCD within a year or so. It was right during that transition WoW released.
---
And I heard alliance had instant BG queues while horde had long waits. How does that work out?
---
Which is still a good thing. 
---
If this is the case, it‚Äôs the first real-world marketing for classic that I‚Äôve come across. If anything we need more of this.
---
Also what is the rotation of a nightfall tank? DPS moves?
---
Sounds about right. Every single post I've seen about layering fails to come up with a better solution that addresses ALL the problems layering attempts to help fix. Usually they don't offer ANY alternative solution.
---
The primary thing is how easy it is to slap (German) behind a server name, compared to how much it would benefit some players. 
---
I speak English at a serviceable level, so it won‚Äôt bother me much whatever they choose to do, but some people who lives in countries that translate everything to their native tongue (including wow), resulting in them hardly understanding english, could end up having major problems. Why not help those people out when it‚Äôs so easy?
---
The mount is expensive and the skill is cheap.
---
80g for mount, 20g for skill with no rep. 100g total.
---
72g for mount, 18 for skill at revered. 90g total.
---
64g for mount, 16g for skill at revered AND level 3 PvP rank. So 80g total.
---
I found out the hard way because I had forgotten that your PvP rating deteriorates. I degraded to level 2 to right when I dinged 40, and saw my mount was costing me 8g more. Was not a happy moment...
---
Hey do the work out or run on foot xD
---
semantics
---
omg thanks for that summary, unfortunately it does...that's terrible!
---
I guess all this stuff is broken because they ported over the Legion/BFA Hunter? But Blizzard can not seriously leave a whole class in such a state, isn't that kind of Major? But well... let's see.
---
Hunter was never my main back in the days, but I seriously consider it as it was fun to play on private servers. Well back to the drawing board then... but closely following the status nevertheless, it's 2 months to go still.
---
Interesting the things you remember and things you don‚Äôt. I recall tier not being faction specific and getting shaman drops as alliance. Don‚Äôt recall him not rewarding any loot though.
---
Which I‚Äôve been informed the faction specific tier was changed in vanilla didn‚Äôt think it was though.
---
If only you‚Äôd seen just how obsessive some people would be about shitting on vanilla and anyone who wanted it lol.
---
Not to mention hammer of justice, bubble, blessing of freedom, judging your seal of command on top of your previously applied seal for more damage, to name a few.
---
You either didn't play ret or you didn't play it well.
---
On the other hand they might realize how much they lose over it.
---
Same for me, even for french people, I think I was already 60 when the names got localized.
---
I immediately switched to EN client as it was so weird to have all names changed suddenly ;)
---
Hahaha, they'll keep you on your toes!
---
I am indeed!
---
Could say the same for EQ1 yet, I don‚Äôt see this same self-gaslighting. Weird.
---
I love that you think anyone was buying their level 40 mount at level 40
---
In BFA the beta never ended.
---
At what level can a paladin bubble hearth?
---
I was always into Strangle Me vale
---
I was a paladin. The camaraderie of free mounts was real.
---
Because a HUGE amount will start playing. I think you are underestimating how many people will give it a shot. And a lot will probably quit.
---
Why do you think they are doing early name reservation? To be nice? HA!
---
1) they get to see how many people are going to try to play at launch.
---
2) they get two weeks worth of subs before the game is even out.
---
To be honest, even though I defend the frustrations caused by 2004 WoW, I somewhat hypocritically have a lot of issues that I think should be changed in 2019 with hindsight and am pretty avidly anti-nochanges. Though unfortunately I have to resign myself to the fact that nochanges is the most fair and reasonable expectation to maintain the historical legacy of the game as it was.
---
For example I personally think 50g respec is dumb and that the argument of spec identity isn't a viable counterargument for the sheer benefits of what spec fluidity has on overall experience of both you and the people around you. Though it's important to know that I'm not saying it should be cheaper. The gating aspect is important, but farming gold just to respec isn't an ideal gating system. I'd rather have it so completing battlegrounds or doing dungeons takes a portion of the price of your next respec off so you don't just feel like you're being taxed and are forced to mindlessly grind gold JUST to play.
---
Also in 2019 I think weekly lockouts are stupid. The term raidlogging was coined BECAUSE of WoW. There's honestly not even a lot of content once you reach endgame. Once you've hit your raid lockout for the week, you can either do BGs or log off. And like you said there's a balance to frustration. When you're doing MC/BWL for 7 months straight and none of your gear drops because of shit RNG, that's just not good design. I don't know what the solution is, I just think there are a lot of ways to improve it while maintaining the integrity. Though again even though I'm complaining and wish these changes existed, I still think the game should exist how it was.
---
Why gaslighting ? In what form would that benefit someone in a gaming forum ?
---
Or do you mean childish trolling with the means of gaslighting ?
---
Then kill them.  Boomkins and shadow priests did back in the day why can‚Äôt you do it now?
---
&gt;Ni hao!
---
Right?! It was like the Rogue Bible. Glad to see it return!
---
I'm going to have to ask for a source here because I can't remember a single bug from Wrath, Cata, WoD or Legion on launch :\^) 
---
&gt;inb4 server downtime = bug
---
Great ideas, another comment I have: 
---
Your physical appearance (fatty/thin) is 80% diet / 20% exercise.
---
Try not to become so focused on WoW that you end up eating low quality foods too often and pack on the pounds, I was guilty of it as was my friends and family when we were big into the game.
---
Meal prep has changed our lives a lot.
---
With the right food choices and portion control, you can loose weight without exercising (but you should find some way, even walking a quick mile around the neighborhood )
---
Yup! You needed a bunch of materials and time. The farming you had to do was on par with grinding for gold, but had the bonus of being more straightforward.
---
Most shadow priests were pressing rank 1 mind flay to increase damage for warlocks and oomkins were there to give priests innervate.
---
Because if you want to fill up your account with 10 rooms to reserve names or fuck around, they‚Äôll usually be warriors. A lot of the excess is lvl 1 warriors who‚Äôve been logged into one time.
---
The majority of the playerbase will be made up of BfA players just checking the game out because it's free. When they leave (which they will) every single server will be dead without layering.
---
Then that  90% player drop layer could be merged into the second one that week, that's the whole idea here. With the second static layer you could wait before merging, because it doesn't have that problem. By phase 1 (Or whenever it is appropriate), all layers would eventually merge, anyway.
---
The [problem](https://youtu.be/VhR7DYS0MFY) with the state of layering, [as we've seen in the tests/beta](https://youtu.be/rrnw7XuGTJQ), is that it can be potentially abused and also abrubt the classic experience.
---
But I'm not saying this idea is a perfect one, and if Blizzard figures out how to fix these problems stated above, then my idea would be unnecessary.
---
Kalimdor: Tanaris and Stonetalon.
---
EK: West/East Plaugelands.
---
Same! I loved Teldrassil so much, it was such a great place to level. I stayed as long as I could. I loved it. I went to Darkshore for a bit but thought the ambiance was too depressing and ended up making the trek to Loch Modan, which I loved.
---
Why do you guys keep telling me what my intentions were? I made the comment. I know what I was trying to say.
---
That's the thing. There are more and more guides coming, more and more theorycrafting. And specs that were once horrible get new light with new gear and some talent switches.
---
Take  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bxj3pz/spelladin\_the\_new\_retribution\_meta/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bxj3pz/spelladin_the_new_retribution_meta/)  for example.

Alliance seeing Shaman tier sets and Horde seeing Paladin tier sets only happened after the pre-TBC patch on 5 December 2006. So it was only a problem for 6 weeks.
---
TIL I‚Äôm autistic
---
Im the one who made this exact meme over a year ago and people repost it once in a while
---
I think it was more relevant when there was a loud population of people salty that classic was announced
---
What is the point of this comment?
---
That may be true, but they were raiding weren‚Äôt they ;)
---
Then why did Blizzard make some dungeons Mythic-only in Legion? Why not just have them in LFG/LFR too?
---
Why did Blizzard suggest Pristine servers without LFR/LFG?
---
wow if this shit is in on the release pvp is going to be dumb as fuck, no dead zone for melees and melees running through aoe's, yeah... if you're going to play, play a warrior.
---
Honor system is phase 2, AV and wsg phase 3.
---
Undead rogue, I‚Äôm gonna be an edgelord ganker
---
If you think pressing rank 1 mind flay then using rank 2 heal is raiding as a shadow priest then yes.
---
22-26 for SFK? That seems off
---
As much hate as cata gets. At launch it had harder heroics than any other xpac (at least imo) they were definitely harder than any heroic in wotlk. Pre nerf cata is probably my favorite WoW period. Sadly it only lasted about a month before blizz caved to everyone and nerfed heroics and raids.
---
Good advice!
---
Yeah the issue is really too complex to place blame on one particular party. And I think you‚Äôre right about then private server scene from Cata and on. But Cata was released December 2010. That was almost a decade ago, a very long time for demand for a game to go unmet. Plenty of time for all that negativity to stew on all sides, fostered by Blizzards prohibition of the discussion and not modee
---
Hunters spamming wingclip with nightftall isn't exactly a new, and I am certain spelldamage dps paladin sucks donkey dick.
---
&gt;‚ÄúMom the mean man on the Internet said something about my favourite sub where me and few dozens of other idiots sit in a circle and hate on good things because it's cool!‚Äù
---
u/DaenerysWasRight
---
Because you don't read? You also state because it's buggy. Well classic is buggy AF especially for hunters. And I also offered a p server that isn't shutting down.
---
Uhh I never said I remember them healing.... the ones I was with did a full dps rotation they just downranked so they didn‚Äôt oom as fast
---
I get the intention, but I think the generalization is a wrong approach. I'm one of those retail players, but I started in the open beta of vanilla, and saw almost every iteration of the game along the way. I agree that somewhere in the process it went too 'player friendly'. 
---
Everyone just needs to accept the fact, that not everything is black and white. And chill out a bit.
---
In all seriousness, it's clear that Blizzard is not saying anything until they have an answer or solution ready to go. The hunter problems are just more complicated ones that are naturally going to be harder to solve and so following their pattern up to this point, it makes perfect sense that they have yet to comment on it.
---
Oh wow. Nice bandaid for a completely unnecessary wound. Still breaks the game
---
Then you would know smite priests are technically better than shadow priests, because we had a holy disc priest who shit on shadow priests constantly.
---
it's not much, but it's an honest days work.
---
This still has the problem that you need to know beforehand how many servers you need. Starting with Silvermoon 1-300 is a possibility, but the merging would be insane.
---
&gt;So I know this is gonna get shot down
---
You will. Best place to ask this kind of questions without getting shot down is on the classic discord server of that class. They have probably all the info there already so you might not even have to ask
---
They never figured out how to fix it on retail, don‚Äôt count on it being fixed in classic. I play lock and it‚Äôs actually atrocious how bad pet ai is compared to the pservers I‚Äôve played on
---
Level 34 since that's when you can train [Divine Shield](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=642/divine-shield).
---
[Divine Protection](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=498/divine-protection) - which you can learn at level 6 - only lasts 6 secs and therefore doesn't last long enough for the 10secs cast time of your Hearthstone.

---
*Resist*
---
Seems evident that you aren't aware of the meaning of gaslighting.
---
I guess, it's just that I know there's probably been a ton of changes since I stopped playing all those years ago, so those differences videos will probably be about a game I hardly recognize
---
It sure is doable there! Check out the Firefox section of the OP for instructions (I did not test them on a Mac though).
---
No. Cats and bears cant even use potions
---
I disagree, without professions you won't have enough gold by the time you hit 40. However if you keep buying gear off the AH every few levels then you're setting yourself up for failure.
---
Reminder that ret pally is absolutely horrible in PvE content.
---
How much would it hurt a warlock to level tailoring and enchanting considering my lvl 40 mount is free?
---
They never said they‚Äôd keep layering in until phase 2.
---
Does it matter if he‚Äôs good? I started playing at 11 and picked druid
---
I had no clue what I was doing, and the class was probably beyond me, but I was left to my own devices and had a ton of fun in the world. It felt like my character, because my choices were entirely mine.
---
I would just let the boy pick whatever speaks to him at character creation. That‚Äôs what worked for millions of kids before him.

Those normies taped him up there though!

It‚Äôs not the end of the world...but if everyone knows you as ‚ÄúTupac‚Äù and then all of a sudden they get whispered from ‚ÄúBiggie‚Äù asking to do SM...they‚Äôre gonna be like ‚Äúi don‚Äôt know you BLOCKED!‚Äù
---
Hunter pet's didn't chase after rogues that vanished in vanilla. Only if you enter stealth normally the pet will chase you.
---
&gt; You also state because it's buggy.
---
Way more buggy than Classic even in its current state. Missing scripting. Scripting that breaks half the time. Incorrect numbers. Incorrect mechanics. The list goes on.
---
Classic devs will fix these; pserver devs won't.
---
Why are you so desperate to try and make me play a private server when I've said multiple times that I don't want to and will not be doing so?
---
I'm leaving any 5-man that masterloots.
---
&gt; CHINA NUMBA ONE
---
obvious, troll is obvious
---
I'm going to be all over the place.  Redridge and Duskwood stand out to me early on.  Tanaris into Un'Goro Crater late.
---
That's a whole lot of optimism you have there. You can't really expect people to share it and be willing to risk the death of realms for it. And after all it makes better headlines when a new release gets more people then expected and they have to create additional realms a few weeks later to accommodate the players than if they become spread too thinly, making the game feel empty and seem like a flop.
---
tanking a joke? Sounds like the type of tank who demands everything except skull is ccd and waits 30 sec inbetween every pull.
---
Certain triggers are known to be wrong. Onyxia's deep breath trigger is not known, but it works in a way that is not distinguishable from vanilla. Backend calculations and triggers will never work the same way, that‚Äôs the nature of emulation, however the goal is to deliver the correct end result.
---
Kill speeds for hundreds of parses have been analyzed, damage values tuned to represent what it was like back then. If your SS hits for 550 after mitigation, and it hits for 550 on the same boss in a parsed vanilla kill, who cares if the calculations made in order to receive that number is different, as long as the end result is the same? Because it is. It‚Äôs been proven too many times to count. Basically every time some piece of evidence shows up, be it a grainy video, combat logs or old archived sites, the numbers match up in such an accurate way, you‚Äôd be a straight up idiot not to be impressed by the work these people have achieved.
---
The truth is, by analyzing the data, the one realistic theory is that melee classes are under-tuned on private servers, bosses hit harder than they are supposed to and many bosses who had seemingly random casts (onyxia for instance), use their abilities way too often.
---
Dun Morogh, rugged land well designed for drawfs and 1 of only 2 snow zones.
---
yeah it‚Äôs fun when the class is working
---
Aw dude
---
Lemmie see your CAC card.
---
Exploration leveling is not new and has been around literally since vanilla.
---
100% truth.  I seriously believe that batching was something that had to be done because of the average level of PC hardware and internet bandwidth at the time.  Artificially doing it now just feels stupid for all the reasons you described.  If Player X casts his ability first, he should reap all the benefits of it.  Even if it's a tenth of a second quicker.
---
Yeah, gear chasing can vary a lot on rng. I honestly think tokens was an okay system, but there was still good stuff that had to drop from boss
---
I played in vanilla around 12 years old, I started as a hunter, it was very easy and I'm sure I played it like a moron, but I sure did love doing it.
---
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID
---
Already have; you take gear which other classes could've used better, and you have to max out on consumes to be able to compete with other classes' baseline.
---
Also MCP lul, though proof is in the pudding I guess.
---
T R I G G E R E D
---
Actually it happened earlier as well. Was fixed and reintroduced.
---
A spec sucking so much that you're not getting invited into raids except if you're in a meme-guild or you're friends with the leader is not "not optimal", it's just straight up not viable.
---
Yes this is true, they would need to predict the amount of servers, atleast at the first day of inital launch. They could alternatively open up more servers as the launch goes on. But silvermoon 1-300 could not be succesfully merged in terms of namespacing and people still wouldn't know what layers that would be merged in the future.
---
More people pvping on horde side?
---
Wow. The guy who had wart problems calling others trolls. How ironic.
---
They even taught us that in medical school now...which previously was devoid of a lot of useful nutrition stuff.
---
I'm not subbed and so didn't get into any stress tests.
---
Above my big blue Install button I have a drop down menu to pick between accounts but that's it, can't choose a client type.
---
&gt;  looks weird and good at the same time
---
was my impression too
---
Nope! That was for the previous stress test, as it was for their live release candidate.
---
Supposedly we have 1 more tress test, but I am not 100% sure about that, you would need to do some digging to verify that.
---
&gt; compared to the pservers I‚Äôve played on
---
Ouch that is just plain embarrassing!
---
Why is MCP bad when you don't care for the DPS of the weapon?
---
A lot of money is made from unhealthy people, but that‚Äôs a non-WoW conversation with a deep rabbit hole
---
Honestly I don't really like spell batching. All it does is add artificial lag to the game and cause things like this to happen.
---
When a pserver on the other side of the world with 150ms feels significantly less laggy than an official server at 50ms, something is horribly wrong.
---
*eyes closed with fingers in ears* Yeah there are no bugs!!!and even if there were there‚Äôd be no place to find a list of them!!!
---
Wouldn't that just create a living hell for anyone that isn't either rushing ? Anybody that has an average speed is going to hit a massive wall of players once they reach 20, anybody that's slower is suddenly thrown into a world that's vastly overpopulated for the game.
---
Tauren = your best bro, even as Alliance (ever seen a Tauren rogue gank you? no and that's why...).
---
wow forgot how soy reddit was holy shit. guess its back to 4chan.
---
Gross.
---
I do not think the intention of this post was to inform blizzard of a want for RP-PvP servers. My understanding is this is to rally a community to make one PvP server into a place where RP-PvP players can call home. Although the OP is asking for a server with moderated rules, which no server has truly ever had, I believe the intent was still to enlighten players of a possibility. We know (or at least we think we know) blizzard will not supply RP-PvP servers on launch, as Ion said, but that shouldn't stop the community from forming.
---
That's awesome man. Thanks for the guide
---
if they have that and won‚Äôt give it to us...
---
Obvious troll account is obvious.
---
&gt; Don't all these AoEs work by putting a debuff on you?
---
No, none of those effects cause debuffs. Blizzard only causes a debuff if you have Imp Blizzard.
---
Yea, and remember all the dead servers after?
---
Well first off you don't even get the nighfall debuff, second of all I shudder to think of the amount of MCPs you need to get for raiding, especially progression. You can't even farm it easily like ferals who just stealth past the entire instance.
---
they just don‚Äôt have the man power for this project. they came so close to giving us what we want but it‚Äôs only about 80% of what we asked for.
---
Man, anything stating the truth nowadays is toxic and gets you bashed. Staysafe, asmongold and tipsout do this constantly.
---
On every 1.12.1 private server I've played, savory and noggenfogger were not removed by ghost wolf or travel form :)
---
Not sure about beta though, or if they plan to change it during release
---
Besides the need for a load balancer (which causes issues with friends), the main issue with this is, what if we find out we need more than 300 realms ? Do you split an already existing one up or do you create new ones (causing people to fall behind in progress) ? 
---
Increasing the server number to absurdum would actually create layering again, because you'd phase in and out as the server would need to merge.
---
Hope the door hits you on the way out.
---
No it's not semantics.
---
Phasing is not cross server and only targets a few areas that change when you do a questi line, so when you're in that area you can see only other player who are on the same step.
---
It literally has nothing to do with layering or sharding.
---
You would need more. There will be wayyyyy more than 90k people trying to login. Could even reach near 1 million during the first few weeks. 
---
*However* many of those will just be tourists who leave the game, which would leave tons of dead servers. More servers is not a solution.
---
Balance isn't exactly BAD for leveling, you just have to deplete your entire mana bar for 1 mob and then spend 20 seconds drinking.
---
....so yeah it's bad for leveling.
---
I'M AT THE ASS END OF THE FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH
---
Same with paladin, but we're talking about level 40, which is way more impactful a change for most classes.
---
got it. so you‚Äôre mostly noobs.
---
It does? That doesn't make sense because where would the chat bubbles come from? Also you'd constantly see people asking for help when there is no one around.
---
I wouldn't be too stressed about it. When Blizzard allows you to download the client, you can log in after downloading a few 100mb. They have this system where it downloads all necessary files first, then allows you to log in while installing the rest. If you have recently fast internet, it will be seconds until you can log in.
---
That's pathetic and terrible. Maybe it was to early to get excited about the game lol
---
Wow, leeway sounds worrisome.
---
Will lvling a druid solo and duo with hunter be an abseloute grind like I've heard? Would like to go feral
---
PvP Can be done in two ways: Stack up on damage or stack up on Stamina. The PvP gear we can get later on is focused on stamina, but raiding gear, with focus on damage, is also viable.
---
The fact that you care so much what others play other than, say, a leveling partner of yours, means that you should probably just poll your class or go with the classic hardcore = warrior / casual = mage-hunter  
---
(not saying mage and hunter are for casuals, just saying that most people that know the game well yet have little time to invest in it roll these classes for very good reasons)
---
Seriously, how in the hell did they pitch this to you? 
---
Quit justifying Layering. Just don‚Äôt. 
---
We lived without it in Vanilla.
---
The latin of the internet
---
I think y'all need to chill. We still have nearly 2 months left until launch, and we're not even halfway through the beta.
---
Of course, I wouldn't bet my balls on those bugs being all fixed by launch time, but again, read paragraph 1. What good does it do to suffer in anticipation, and start saying you're rolling another class? 
---
I think it's another case of "boredom pre-launch". There's still 2 months left and people have an itch to play they can't scratch, so they start freaking out about related stuff.
---
Do what you can effectively do in the meantime, and report these bugs to Blizzard. Then chill, there's (unfortunately) still a long time before launch. They're probably up to their necks with bugs to fix and other stuff to do, you can't simply expect whatever bugs bug you (heh) the most to be fixed by the next day.
---
I will be buying an under desk elliptical somewhat soon.

I don't exercise at all. So that and keto should help me lose plenty of weight.... Again. Hopefully I don't gain it all back again
---
People that go on the servers and cray aren't the people you need to worry about.
---
The Barrens!
---
I think you are mistaking gloating for insecurity.
---
that‚Äôs about the softest claim to stand for possible lol. 
---
Boomkins should be brought along! It‚Äôs not impossible to clear raids with them there!
---
You're missing shamans..
---
Shamans: Axes, Daggers, Maces, Staves
---
Yea namespace issues aside, I think you'd need to restrict flow of players pretty hard. Once Silvermoon 69 is full, you can't let any more players on it. And that could mean some people couldn't play with their friends. 
---
Creating new servers would lead to potentially giving up progress, which isn't a nice thing either.
---
Oh yeah I'm not too stressed yet, but if it's August 12th and I still don't have the client installed I'm gonna be losing my mind. I have really slow "I live in Canada and it would be faster to tether my phone" internet. 
---
Will probably have to go camp out at a buddies house and log on my account on his computer.
---
Yes, but my point still stands. If EU isn‚Äôt getting more than 5 realms, then it‚Äôs unlikely NA is getting more than 6 (3 for each coast).
---
So there‚Äôs no point to rallying all the RP-PVPers to pick one realm. All PVPers will be picking that realm.
---
Quests award the same amount of experience and reputation whether green/yellow/orange/red. I‚Äôve been developing an Alliance quest completionist guide (https://shadowpanther.net/questing.htm) specifically for Rogues, but the same route would work for just about any class, minus the class-specific quests. It‚Äôs a slower, laid back way to level, with less unintentional deaths.
---
Stranglethorn Vale without a doubt!
---
I'm not much of a pvp'er when it comes to battlegrounds, but I absolutely LOVE world pvp and some of my most fond memories while lvl'ing in classic (or in all the expansions I've played in general) is in STV due to all the tense ganking moments - both on the receiving and the giving ends.
---
Tinfoil hat: Blizzard made most hybrid class specs expect healing specs nonviable because they thought they would need to essentially force/trick people into healing end game content.
---
It‚Äôs useable for threat but I personally don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth the investment. I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs the meta for deep prot tanks.
---
To answer some other questions, yes, of course you can drop anticipation when you‚Äôre defence capped. Or even before that point - anticipation is best at fresh 60 and only gets worse as you gear up, while toughness gets better. It‚Äôs definitely worth taking early on though.
---
Improved revenge is basically godlike for dungeons since stun is so valuable. If you want to run your own prebis farm groups for 60 dungeons up to UBRS and get known as a great tank early on, I would take it. 
---
Basically worthless in raids but I think the points are still worth keeping, even after you begin raiding it‚Äôs quite likely you‚Äôll be doing dungeon runs for some months after. Even if you have EVERY prebis piece (easier said than done even after being 60 and raiding for weeks) if you‚Äôre an MT you should be running guildies through dungeons for attunements and gear, especially fresh 60s and new recruits.
---
Which zones are the best for leveling 45-50? I am following the vanilla guide addon and it seems like there are barely any quests and a lot of them are absolutely awful to do. I ended up grinding literally 3 entire levels on pirates in Tanaris and Oozes in the Hinterlands because of that.
---
Can someone recommend other zones for that level than that addon?
---
*their
---
back in 2003 we have had a completely different mindset though.
---
The whole min-maxing aspect wasn't as big, we didn't start looking up quests the moment they started taking 2 braincells to complete. We played what was fun and enjoyed the journey instead of seeing everything below endgame as a waste of time
---
So you are getting offended by the most innocent meme and someone that very politely and jokingly tells you that its just fun and even puts a freaking smiley at the end is hate mongering ?
---
This truly is 2019
---
I don't sit to play until after workout.
---
The gold miner story and the story about the wagon trail were my favorites. Great movie
---
The main problem with layering is the constant barrage of layering posts, every few minutes.
---
&gt; layering literally has 0, nothing, to do with overcrowded starting areas
---
Not nothing clearly :) 3k in starting zones vs 15k.
---
Smite priests OOM even faster than Shadow; it's a meme spec that really only works for when Ony / MC are on farm and bosses die in under a minute.
---
Stormlands, Dorne, Iron Islands and The North.. Can't wait to visit Kings Landing at level 10 and head over to Essos at 55 - 60
---
scratch that, this lad hasnt met a proper woman who wasn't his mother.
---
&gt; Apparently PS have been over estimating feral damage
---
We think.
---
The difference at 40 is lower than the difference at 20, so it might just be a scaling issue.
---
Even if Feral does ~5% less damage, they're still the most viable hybrid DPS.
---
what does having a wart on my thumb have to do with calling you a troll, lol?
---
...but what about your battlenet friends!
---
So gaslighting followed by calling me a puritan with my Christian standards is just erased because you out a smiley face? Difference between a rib and trying to cover up for being a douche.
---
Gankers are a pleasent part of the experience in my opinion.
---
I know it can sound weird - especially when they're corpse camping you - but idk... Ganking the opposite faction (and being ganked) is just the quintessence of WoW in my eyes, at least while lvl'ing.
---
This is so true. I used to always think losing weight was purely exercise.
---
Went from 194 to 155 in 2017 and didn't do any supplemental exercise. Still blows my mind that people think they can eat whatever they want and do a short walk and think it's burned off; but I have to remind myself I thought the same way.
---
This is not really a "them vs. us" post, it just highlights the fact that blizzard found the magic recipe when they made wow, the impact wow had on the MMO genre is the same as doom/quake on FPS. I do think it's a bit annoying when people use the "rose-tinted glasses" argument, vanilla (up to wrath)  was a masterpiece and that has nothing to do with rose-tinted glasses 10M people played the game because it was a really good game.
---
That simply means that if you had used keybinds you would have been carrying 100% of the time, instead of literally being average at best (by your own estimation).
---
I am leaving these unpopular posts up so that people can see the zeitgeist of underperformance.
---
And yes, I regret not binding Rebirth - a spell that requires fast reaction if ever there was one.
---
Ya I mean we don't know yet. I just said "apparently". Im just making a joke. Thought this was supposed to be a silly thread, not an actual discussion about hybrid viability lol.
---
&gt; Why did Blizzard themselves say that ‚Äúthe world is a lot bigger if there is unbeaten content out there‚Äù?
---
I don't know why you keep clinging to this.  I already addressed this and agreed with it.  It has no bearing on the discussion at hand though as LFR comes out after the content is beaten.
---
&gt; Then why did Blizzard make some dungeons Mythic-only in Legion? Why not just have them in LFG/LFR too?
---
Because it was an experiment they wanted to try out to cater to the more hardcore anti LFD groups.  They tried it again in BFA.  Then changed it because it was an irrelevant pointless chunk of blocked content.  Side note I'm not opposed to having harder dungeons that you can't LFD for the first month or so.  Then open it up to the masses.  That seems perfectly reasonable.  Getting rid of LFD and LFR and claiming they are the root of all evil is my problem.
---
&gt; Why did Blizzard suggest Pristine servers without LFR/LFG?
---
Sauce on this?  I'd like to give it a read.
---
the post will live longer than the layers themselfs
---
Not enough yet.
---
Its possible. You dont need to raid 5 or 6 days a week to see all content.
---
I'd expect the deadzone range bug fixed by launch date.  Pet AI, not so much.  That shit is notoriously hard to fix
---
you can't be serious...
---
No, any combo of DPS and heals or DPS and tank will work. He can pet tank, or you can depending on situation and macro heal.
---
But which layer is the dead horse in?
---
They think it's retarded? Provide some proof please.
---
Yup this is correct, thread over
---
You will be absolutely buffed after finishing STV.
---
A diet isn't for a while, it's for a lifetime. If you eat 3000 calories a day, you're going to have the body of someone who eats 3000 calories a day

---
The axe that sends you to flavor town.
---
This subreddit unironically believed blizzard when they re-branded sharding as "layering".
---
Can you give some example ? 
---
I don't find a lot of usefull thing that would be strong enought to bother about leveling engineering twice :(
---
Diy treadmill desk. Lost 60 lbs in two months. Total down 80 in six months
---
If they do the next stress test available to all subs like the previous one, just sub for that. It's only like 2 weeks prior to the early name change. So you're essentially just paying 7.50 to download the game a couple weeks in advance, might be worth a little peace of mind. And I totally get those issues with living somewhere sparsely populated and lack of internet. Northern Minnesota here, so pretty much an honorary Canadian.
---
15K was never going to happen.
---
Layering solves the problem of 3,000 on a server (three times) vs 3,000 on three servers.
---
Yes. Some people absolutely are.
---
But with your luck:
---
Newwwwwww
---
Ooh, Ugh, Awgh.
---
Barrens and salt flats will be a good time.
---
UHHH  no not in in this server you cannot pay for gear or characters. I don't give a fuck what you do. I just said there's a  p server that isn't less buggy than the current beta, massive improvement? PETS DON'T EVEN WORK IN CLASSIC WOW RN L0L. THE WEPS DO MORE DMG THAN THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO ,  the list goes on you ignorant fucking idiot.  Fucking wow community man.
---
Whatever one he thi is is coolest
---
I'll be a hunter, everything belongs to me anyway
---
Yep. This isn't my first rodeo. Got major depressed from some bad news and only thing that made me remotely happy was eating. So that's what I did.
---
clubbing a dead horse?
---
is this implying that druids are the big gay? Twice as gay as the regular gay?
---
Because I find that egregious.
---
I thought you could only roll one faction on all PVP servers
---
Quite likely.
---
Wooa... Come on now. The way leeway is, nobody is running from anybody.
---
Play p servers.  Played last night and it was glorious. I'm so mad at myself for not playing p servers for the past 10 years
---
Then silvermoon 69 would initate queues, and in reality this would be more or less the exact same system they had back in the day so this isn't what the idea is about. But i think your argument is quite strong against this type of system
---
Unless you are a mage, hunter, paladin, shaman, rogue, warlock or druid :)
---
If you ignore it, it won't go away. You can suck Blizzard's dick all you want, layering is still a shitshow.
---
I wasnt attributing it to wotlk but its simply part of the wotlk raid tier-structure, copy-paste is probably better than making a new dungeon which might have been alot worse.
---
How is it watered down exactly? as i said we are talking about structural design and naxx has never been changed in that regard. Doesnt matter if you played it during vanilla or wotlk, it still has the exact same type of layout. No pathing changes, no different corridors to run through and even no different QoL-changes...  all the teleport-things at the end of a wing were there in vanilla too.
---
Literally nothing changed in naxx from 2006 to 2008. That was also a problem mechanic wise but i never said im talking about boss mechanics.
---
I think you didnt read my entire comment since i clearly stated im ONLY talking about STRUCTURAL LAYOUT. It has nothing to  do with difficulty of a raid.
---
Theres a reason why i dont want to talk about difficulties because its highly opinionated discussion and as expected you shat on wotlk-naxx as per usual... im well aware naxx25 was cleared by a raid team with level 78 players which made it a disappointment from a challenge perspective.
---
Doesnt change the fact that the raid layout was awesome...
---
The class itself does a decent damage it just doesn't have two things level 60 spells, or books at increase the damage of chain lightning and lightning bolt at 60 or the mana sustainability. You just cant last long enough in long fights to be considered a true dps. I can see bringing shaman dps to like ZG and maybe AQ20 or farm MC/ONY but outside that they aren't going to be able to last long enough. Sad to say, and as said before ask on the official class discord, they will have more information for you.
---
Enjoy the ban :)
---
Shit bro. If you need something else to make you happy; walking dogs from the pound gives you a happy feeling like you wouldn't believe it
---
I am against that too  but people did it to me so i will do it to them
---
Not playing your game. You know you're a cretin
---
Every time someone mentions a streamer 20 squats
---
You'd always be squatting
---
Thanks my dude.
---
This is the kinda behavior you can expect if you are in a streamer guild, there is going to be about 500-1000 people with the exact same mentality as him poisoning your realm.
---
Honestly, I guarantee that was paid for. Some random dude wasn't just like "hey I'm going to put WoW Classic on there!". Ad real estate is ad real estate, and they wouldn't just put it there for fun
---
I only RP walk.
---
You'd legit never stop doing squats as people spam INV TO ASMON LAYER PLS
---
Yup, HE's the one who looks inadequate rn..
---
Exactly!
---
Im ne too I can't wait use gun
---
That sounds like fun actually. Problem is I work nights so it'd be a weekend thing but thanks, I'll check the nearest pound
---
It ain't much  of an adventure is every person you run into is lawful neutral.
---
Look at this guy, putting the TLDR before all the math mumbo-jumbo
---
We assumed the implementation wouldn't be this poor. Blizzard need to either remove batching entirely or change it so it works correctly and doesn't affect everything in the game like it does now.
---
That‚Äôs the plan!
---
What is the recommended way for locks to farm
---
At 60? I played rogue in vanilla, and did rogue shit like pickpocket and stealth runs etc.
---
I played lock in TBC so not sure, never really farmed.
---
Which is more effective at endgame
---
If you wanna stay updated about it, you can join the project discord: [https://discord.gg/EhWEHR](https://discord.gg/EhWEHR)

Burpees from Teldrassil to Silithus is going to be brutal
---
Cow's can't ride raptors outside of the black war raptor or the one from ZG. I checked on the vendor in the beta, only said  Undead, Troll, and Orc.
---
If he does want to play warrior play something that can heal and you‚Äôll have a blast!
---
Stress test is over, only people with a beta key can get in now.
---
Yes, you sure are going to use Hammer of Justice a lot on raid bosses.
---
Oh I came here to ask stuff but this is a question I can answer.
---
Tanks need resist gear.
---
For others, varying degrees of resist gear/consumables are useful to smooth out certain encounters on progression. Especially true for more casual guilds where everyone isn't wearing close to BiS pre 'that raid' gear and some mistakes are expected. After gearing, up dps and heals can usually manage to forgo the FR gear except those required for Onyxia and Nefarion. The Ony attunement quest gets you started with a nice neck, the quest for killing her grants another piece (ring/neck/trinket) and the Ony back are all pretty great anyway.
---
Going forward nature and frost resistance are vital for AQ and Naxx.
---
For agreeing with OP? I‚Äôm sorry, I guess. 
---
But you going around throwing out insults doesn‚Äôt make you better.
---
The guy is asking because the Hunter bug list is like 100 bugs deeps. It's pretty damn serious and most issues haven't been fixed since it was posted over a month ago. 
---
It's a genuine concern, because there's loads of other bugs as well. Many are things that are pretty damn necessary to fix and there's been no communication on most of them so far.
---
You can be sarcastic all you want, but I'd say it's absolutely a valid concern that many of these bugs remain in the game at launch
---
If i recall correctly the Black war raptor is also rideable by tauren.
---
I remember those levels being tricky, usually trying to do grinding and farming instances to boost gear and make some gold for epic mount
---
How long does a typical run to lvl 60 take?  Not speedrunning but just playing normally, checking out different zones, pvping, doing dungeons, etc.
---
&gt;  This is obviously a bug and won't be in the final product
---
This and many other bugs like the strafe bug have been known since day 1 of beta and they haven't been fixed/adjusted yet or as far as I know even addressed yet with a forum post. It is very unsettling and has me worried about the final product.
---
Hate mongering lmfao. You spend too much time on Reddit buddy. Go outside once in a while.
---
Ele shaman is for pvp, and they are gods there, you are a healer in raids, just embrace it and stop trying to theorycraft stuff that has already been figured out for 15 years.
---
I mean we knew this would happen. 
---
People called that we would end up blacklisting streamer guilds instead of them blacklisting us.
---
I don't see how it could hurt unless your constantly buying enchanting mats. Tailoring should be a mostly free profession.
---
Sticking with the vanilla UI, can't really switch from it when I'm playing classic.
---
Bro lol MC and ZG are some of the first ones that require that..fire for Mc and nature for zg. I wouldn‚Äôt worry about that for a very long time
---
I personally refuse to quest in Ashenvale. Would rather run instances than deal with that BS.
---
I don't think you realize the amount of issues hunter has right now. I don't even play hunter but I absolutely empathize with these people. 
---
My main has a few bugs, but only 1-2 or super important to get fixed. Hunter is a totally different story right now
---
Locks can do the same DME farm that mages and priests can do which people say is pretty good money, like 50-100/hr.
---
You can make anything seem insignificant compared to Nazi concentration camps. Not an argument.
---
People who say ‚Äúomg leet mounts expensive u rich man bro!‚Äù always confuse me. Did anyone else actually play Classic and the gold requirement really wasn‚Äôt as hard to get as people make it sound? Maybe I just didn‚Äôt go full idiot with my gold while leveling up. I had earned around 400 gold by level 40 on average on every char I made. 
---
What was actually less common was having enough gold to finish your epic mount quest right at 40. It wasn‚Äôt hard to have enough, but you did have to make sure you were actually making money instead of just leveling‚Äîbut you didn‚Äôt need to make sure you put time into making money until like level 37/38.
---
STV. 
---
Ah thanks for the info! Sucks only having beta for a week :/
---
It's ok, you've made me no longer want to post here, I'll stick a different community. I'll just come here to read on any news that comes up. Can't help stupid.
---
The whisper is gonna be from the battle.net thingy so it wouldn't be an issue. Also noone has ever blocked someone for asking them to join a dungeon run...
---
A month or two generally speaking
---
&gt;  removing spell batching will significantly change the game
---
I believe most pserver pvpers from guilds like APES would have rather have no spell batching than what is currently in the beta because of how poor the implementation is.
---
No argument to make? Better make a comment assuming someone doesn't go outside. You're a joke bro'.
---
smh
---
The big one is Goblin Sappers. These are used throughout the whole game in PVE and PVP. Their cast time is 60 seconds per sapper, so it's nice to not have to rely on guildies to do this annoying task for you.
---
Whether its worth taking Gnomish just for the few trinkets and then unlearning it for Goblin is up to you.
---
I grinded 45 to 51
---
Just tested on my server, the limit as of Patch 1.12.1 is 10 ranks &amp; 15 characters each

You're going to enjoy having your mob de-spawn, people sharding to avoid world pvp, and the countless node exploits that will ruin the economy?

Spoken like a true retail baby.

Maybe cause of asmonmald
---
NoRmIe
---
Honestly I think the best fix would be just making it where layering stops after level 10 or 20. 
---
Sadly, none of these fixes are going to be implemented because it's too late. Had this sub caused an uproar about it when it was first announced there would have been a chance for a different style of layering - but instead this sub defended layering through and through
---
What he says isn't even ninjalooting though lol.  He says "go ahead and ninjaloot because you will have better gear for our raids".  If the gear is an upgrade for you, then you aren't ninjalooting, so this doesn't even make sense.
---
Oh yeah Minnesota you guys feel free to secede from the union and rejoin the Queen's good graces any ol time you like, we'll take ya.
---
Played with TukUI during Stress Test, but waiting for ElvUI to be updated for Classic as I always liked that one better.
---
Darkshore, Ashenvale and 45-50 have been by far the least enjoyable since there are way too few quests. I even did most of Westfall and still had to grind a ton to keep up with the guide. Everything else has worked like a charm though. I did this as a Mage so I am dreading to do that once classic releases on my priest.
---
Definitely gonna look into doing dungeons as a healer then. Thanks for the advice
---
Unit frames in the clip?
---
Would be pretty awesome but highly unlikely. Don't know how they'd translate the controller. Ideally would use a mouse and keyboard, but can't really sync them to the handheld unit, so you'd play docked only, at that point just play on a laptop or your desktop.
---
You still arent making any sense. Nobody asked that and youve picked a very small part of someones comment. Thats fallacy of incomplete evidence, you are pointing at a very small part of something bigger to make it further support your standing.
---
Are you sure you understood his comment in the first place?
---
Hes clearly talking about how wotlk dungeons were easier than any dungeons before it and blizzard made cata dungeons harder than wotlk and then people whined.
---
Theres further evidence that cataclysm dungeons were more difficult  than wotlk dungeons. (read the entire comment, its a comparison not a statement specifically about cataclysm)
---
And that evidence can easily be googled and found on many many gaming news-sites who made a post about blizzard nerfing them.
---
So no matter what you say you cant fight facts... they were harder than what people were used to. Doesnt matter if you were carried through them by raiders or anything like that.... top end raiders arent majority of players unfortunately.
---
https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;q=cataclysm+dungeon+nerf
---
I would start with showing him the opening cinematic. Hopefully it sparks a natural desire to play. Then I'd find some good class videos or short guides and let him play. He'll need his own account for you two to play together, and he'll have 10 slots, so he's not stuck. You can remind him that if he dislikes one class, that's okay. Not every class is for everyone. He'll find one to fall in love with.
---
Man I loved the troll temple in Hinterlands.

99% of this sub could not do 100 squats. Anyone who argues this point has not done 100 squats.

Reality will be nothing like those retarded servers. Healing is fine in PvP except mana is tough, a lot of drinking
---
Cant forget the Internet Is For Porn Video
---
There is no conflict. Classic wow subs will pay for future expansion releases for retail - its all one company and really one game.
---
Death ray, Shrink ray and Net-o-matic projector.
---
I loved the temple. Get some friends, treat it like an instance!
---
Are you dumb? So if there is other people in the party that needs said item wouldn't that b3 considered ninjalooting???
---
yeah but for example as feral you buff 4 other melees with 3% crit. their damage gain is not visible in your numbers, but its there. i dont say you should raid with 10 ferals, 5 enahncers and 5 moonkins. but they definetly add big value to the group.
---
also feral dps is actually real, watch "shedo the druid" on youtube
---
Exactly, and honestly layering is better than no layering, without layering they will have to create tons of more servers early on and we already know how that looks if we take a look at retail, theres about 10-15 servers out of 100 EU servers that are High or Full, the majority are Low pops
---
Although I cannot say I know how many servers will come into play and I'm not sure how you know, I can say that US servers are by time zone not coast. It is highly unlikely that blizzard would put out one of each type of server by coast. It is a lot more likely that it would be per time zone.
---
And even if we do have a limited pool of servers, I think community building is important regardless.
---
Winterspring. By far the best zone of all time imo.
---
The uptime of SS isn‚Äôt the issue, it‚Äôs the fact it takes up a debuff slot. There isn‚Äôt enough nature damage in a raid to make full use of SS, which is why it‚Äôs not used. That further makes elemental shaman not as viable.
---
yeah but as long as i dont participate in it it doesnt affect me, right?
---
Insecure? Most people here have played private servers for the last 10 years. If anyone is insecure its retail players who know their servers will be dead come August 27 ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Most people take between 10-12 days /played for their first 60, depending on class
---
&gt; Your physical appearance (fatty/thin) is 80% diet / 20% exercise.
---
Exactly this.
---
No amount of exercise will stave off a bad diet. Well, to an extent. Losing weight with a bad diet requires many times more exercise than a good diet. And you might end up just gaining more muscle instead of losing fat.
---
100 non-weighted squats isn‚Äôt hard. If you argue this then you haven‚Äôt done 100 squats without weights

---
Not if it is an upgrade for you, the reason you literally roll on gear, that isn't ninjalooting.
---
&gt;I've played WoW every expansion, and until Blizz announced Classic WoW, I never heard anyone on retail talk negatively about Classic, or even bring it up at all really. I can't believe some people in this community actually have a victim complex and are calling other people insecure... unreal.
---
I don't know what to say if you didn't see the vitrol. It was vile from the retail community. Every single thread started on the warcraft forums about rebooting vanilla was a wall upon wall of text of "No". No constructive discourse and players shitting on those that liked classic. It was bad.
---
I didn't say WOTLK wasn't successful, I said that I didn't like it and I certainly didn't like the direction the game was going. I quit before Ulduar, as I mentioned. My guild had 3 drake Sarth on farm, and Ulduar wasn't being released for a while, I sold my account while it was at peak value. This was a long time ago, I don't remember the specifics to every little detail, but things were implemented in WOTLK that removed faction interaction (such things as raiding horde/alliance major cities) almost entirely, content was very easy at least up until the point I couldn't stomach playing anymore, prot warriors in greens were 1 shotting anything in cloth PvP gear or not, I enjoyed the grind to 80 and the questing, the constant presence of horde/alliance in each zone. That was the highlight for me. Once I hit 80 it ended and everyone sat idle in the dual faction cities waiting around for whatever. 
---
It wasn't for me. If it was for you, fantastic. They made the game more appealing to the casual player, there are more casual players than otherwise. The problem with a lot of casual players is they lose interest more easily because they are less invested. WoW died a long time ago, Wotlk imo was simply the beginning of the end. Does this mean Wotlk wasn't a great expansion and didn't have a high playerbase? No. That is not what I'm saying. What I am saying is that things were implemented in Wotlk and BUILD ONTO in further expansions, which were the highlighted issues people had with the game moving forward.
---
That is what I'm saying. Again, if you love Wotlk that's fantastic. I didn't.
---
It seems to be a nasty bug to fix, as it's been affecting Legion/BfA for years too. It's pretty important that they fix these bugs. 
---
It would be a huge boost of faith for the dev team too, and would get me optimistic that they will also fix the bugged spell batching and leeway systems.
---
Thanks that helps a lot and I really appreciate it. Now don‚Äôt take this wrong, but what I was having an issue with was... I would send in the VW first on a mob and wait for it to get threat before doing anything else. Then somewhere around level 13-14 the mobs would frequently ignore the VW turn to me and start running or firing before I even dotted them, and the VW would just turn and come back to me like the mobs had somehow simply rejected it and said go home.
---
Also, then just don‚Äôt mention a streamer if you can do 100 squats
---
A Few questions:
---
In the version we are getting is down ranking skills possible? (e.g the kind of thing that allowed 3 man ony kills)
---
Is haste a thing and if so, does it increase damage/heals per tick on dots/hots or give extra ticks?
---
What classes were capable of soloing raid content or even just fun dungeon kills? I have fond memories of killing zg tiger and raptor with my lock and runing in semi circles in brd for shards and profit.
---
Yeah but what do you mean abusing layers to get more herbs? You do realise theres gonna be herbs on every layer? if someone snags 7x Black Lotuses by swapping 7 layers, thats just 6 other black lotuses 6 other herbers wont get. its not like swapping layers are gonna generate more herbs, theyre always there to begin with.
---
every single issue in this video would be solved if they locked layer switching to rested zones
---
Only class I care about playing is hunter so if it remains broken I probably won't even play tbh.
---
Warrior is brutal for grinding
---
We can‚Äôt answer that question. Every guild has their own schedules and rules. Find a guild that works with your schedule.
---
It's probably too late. Instead of realizing how problematic layering is this sub decided to upvote 15 8 page posts about how layering is actually the best thing to happen to this game. 
---
That would have been the best time to bring attention to it, but instead we bent over for blizzard and now instead of fixing it they'll point to the posts this sub upvoted and say see it's now so bad!
---
You're just throwing out random numbers. Hunters have had a lot of pet/AI bugs in BFA for years now without them fixing them, and thats the version of WoW that is supposed to be constantly updated.
---
We have no idea when/if theyre going to fix these bugs that were NOT in vanilla wow.
---
Like, where are you seeing this negativity? All the wow content creators and streamers are going to play classic. Comments from years ago are not relevant, this community has a retarded persecution complex
---
I mean unless you‚Äôre preparing for a duel tournament or just enjoy grinding gold, there‚Äôs not much to do at 40. If they raised the cap there would at least be more content to do until it becomes the same thing as 40.  
---
Only way to have more players playing is to send more invites or raise the cap. I‚Äôve been tallying the amount of players each night and it‚Äôs been hovering a bit below 500 online which kind of sucks considering there‚Äôs also 2 layers.
---
Not shitting on you but if you didn't overdo the photoshop effects it would have looked awesome. Right now I can't tell if that's a real room with real props, or if it's just drawn on photoshop. I want to believe in that window but I think that's also a fake prop.
---
Otherwise it looks cool.
---
Well, I might be able to read German, but I sure as shit don‚Äôt want to be forced to use it to play a game. It takes way more mental effort than using English or my mother tongue, and it‚Äôll suck the fun out of the game for me. Sporadic use of a different language, sure okay. But constantly? I‚Äôd rather just play a different game to be honest.
---
feral druid and hunter are among 2 of the fastest classes to level, you should be absolutely fine
---
Thank you, that helps... more time to practice on ps before release.
---
Crossed wires. Didn't realise you were talking about easy mode. Pvper here. But since your mentioned it, repentance is useful for trash control (very important in vanilla). As well as utility such as blessing of protection to save the healer at that crucial moment... Or bubble and hearth when all is lost... Lol :)
---
Pre nerf Cata was awesome. They revitalized PvP for me with RBGs (never liked Arenas personally), the release heroics and raids were awesome, people were back on Kalimdor/Eastern Kingdoms rather than some far away land that consists of 5 zones only... pre nerf Cata was hella fun.
---
When they nerfed the heroics I instantly quit. From then on I've been an on and off player and with BfA I decided to quit for good (unless they make sweeping changes to the game)
---
The continuous sub drop started with Cata's heroic nerfs. Let that sink in. May be coincidence but fits my personal view. It never recovered, either. Sure a short bump at the start of a new expansion, but the final decision to go full blown easymode and accessibility marks the time the subs started and never stopped dropping.
---
Okay I have been hoping to roll on an RP PvP server since Classic's announcement but bruh you are hella extra. No OOC talk what so ever? Even in party chat? Sooo extra.
---
So you can guess the number of hours you play per day
---
Speed running is ~115hrs /played
---
An experienced leveler that is focused is ~150hrs /played
---
An experienced leveler doing stuff like professions and a bit of early pvp is 180hrs/played  Example, phase 1 there is no pvp rewards, but back in the day if I leveled an alt I would do some STV pvp or Q a couple of mid level BGs to make sure that I was rank 3 before i hit 60 so I could buy a pvp trinket and not have to try to pvp at max level against geared players to get it.  
---
I think my first character was around 10 days so 240hrs, but it was my first MMO I suspect if you've played retail you would be on a pace faster then that.
---
I‚Äôd argue that most classes and professions had their value stripped away.
---
As a young kid back then lazy as hell I definitely bought gold for my mount. I‚Äôve never been good with making cash in WoW and I‚Äôm not ashamed of it. I get why people buy gold and now that I‚Äôm older I hate it but can understand why people do it.
---
Yeah his scenario doesn't really make sense without further context. He clearly seems to be condoning selfish play though.
---
Yea but is it common to find such guilds?
---
&gt; as long as you restrict all characters over a certain level to the same layer
---
That's even worse than what we currently have. Sorry Tim, can't play with you even though we're on the same sever because you're on layer 8 and I'm on layer 3. Oh also this streamer is on layer 3 and it's chaos
---
Obviously I know what I'm talking about
---
Got a link to the one you used?
---
**wipes tears from eyes** youll never know the sacrifice and heart ache this community has gone through man! Lets pour one out and give a salute to all the classic soldiers we've lost.
---
All servers are hosted in Los Angeles or Chicago.
---
It is unlikely that there will be any realms with Central or Mountain time.
---
You wont even notice the phasing lmao, if you just log in in classic, invite ur friend ur lvling with and bam, both in the same layer, and will remain in the same layer until you log out which is most likely the next day. Unless you actually abuse the system you will hardly notice it... the layering is MADE specifically to make it so it wonk break immersion.
---
If you want to do everything, youll want to go tailoring at least until the bop robe is crafted (robe of the void I think), which is a BIS for a while.
---
On the other hand, enchanting can be expensive and difficult to gather all the lategame recipes, but if that's your endgame then go for it, but I'd only do it after tailoring robe.
---
That's like PvP servers not existing in classic and telling people to just tUrN yOuR fLaG oN.
---
&gt; Why? Tinker should have been a class all the way back in classic.
---
How do I say this is really dumb without hurting your feelings?
---
What are your thoughts on Enchanting? How do you plan to level it? If you DE quest stuff, that's a lot of passive gold down the drain.
---
Lmao if your rotation was complicated as frostmage you did something very wrong
---
[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5K2NrSZvO4) shows how well WoW can be played with a controller using an addon.
---
&gt; Retail game bad
---
&gt;Classic game good
---
All I needed to hear. Have an upvote.
---
You are correct. I play(ed) RPPvP because the role players added to the ambiance and immersion. You'd see people in all sorts of places just doing their thing.
---
Got involved once or twice but mostly it was nice to make the world feel more alive. Turns those "oh this is neat" locations to roleplay locations, and adds a lot of busyness to the major cities that isn't just people jumping on and off the postbox.
---
Leveling professions during leveling or at 60?
---
I'm confused by this. So instead of removing melee leeway, they added spellcasting leeway?
---
Now people are saying leeway always existed in Vanilla. Whereas before people were insisting it wasn't added until MoP or maybe even WoD.
---
see u on the battle field critting you with an aimed shot from far fam 
---
i‚Äôm abt to be balling out
---
One of the lead designers actually said that they addressed things people were complaining about. He literally said "complaining is actually how you get things changed"
---
Walked into an instance portal once, character got deleted and WoW auto uninstalled.
---
Never made that mistake again.
---
I haven't seen this in so long... yet every time I see ROFL or LMAO i immediately sing this song in my head haha
---
Also people asking why the play button isnt lighting up when they clearly have classic beta.
---
All these countdown posts are making the wait seem even longer, stahp!
---
A neutral city and faction interaction died in TBC when we got shatt and pallies and shamans on both sides.  You played the first tier, of course content was easy, it was watered down Naxx that Blizz wanted everyone to experience and beat.  You didn't see Ulduar and ICC or their hard modes, you missed the meat of the expansion.

Pirates?

I would say let him read the class descriptions and pick. It‚Äôs more important that he enjoys it right? He should know what he likes.
---
I started playing MMO‚Äôs around that age. Didn‚Äôt know how to play too well at first. I knew what I liked though and was able to make and build a character based on that. Granted it‚Äôs quite a bit different in a classless, non level based mmo. However he should know if he likes the idea of being a caster or a melee. Whether he knows what the word melee means or not.

Turn about is fair play.

Yikes. It really makes me not want to roll a mage if they don't fix this.

Yes, just because you are stating the truth doesn't mean you are not toxic. It is not WHAT you say, it is HOW you say it.

There was no bashing, just stated my perspective in a polite but assertive manner.

Then Silvermoon 1 won't ever need to be merged and 2,3, and 4 can all be merged together down the road.

Like clockwork.

Bruh my wow account is from 2004, i played the game then. Spellbatching was stupid then (though perhaps necessary), its especially stupid to recreate it now.

You never had beta

You could probably replicate this with Nvidia game filters, using Alt + F3 to bring up the menu (must have the overlay enabled) and then adjust the brightness / contrast filter. Within that there is a highlights and shadows setting.
---
How did I not even see those?! marvelous! thanks a bunch :D

&gt; Starting with Silvermoon 1-300 is a possibility

They still have player limits...

I was 13 when this came out... my hair line is now receding.

Can confirm, am getting old too
---
I'm sorry that I don't understand basic gaming.
---
Explain to me how servers worked in 2005? How about any other MMO? 
---
Make more servers, if someones on a high pop server thats their own choice.
---
1st of all, by putting specific lvl ranges into specific layers ur gonna empty the whole server outside of those 2-4 zones people lvl in, capitals and lowlvl zones are gonna be completely dead, also lowlvl mats are gonna be so easy to farm because all the lowlvls doing copper/tin veins and peacebloom/silverleaf are gonna be in different layers.  
---
Having set lvl requirements for different layers are gonna also completely empty the world at the higher end making 50+ worldpvp dead, highend materials will be abused to heck because people will be alone.  
---
theres just no advantage to it when it comes to having a healthy realm.  
---
Literally just having good ole whole realm layering \~3k pop for each layer is the best thing that could happen, tinkering with it wont do any good.  
---
Its as organic as it could be
---
My argument was that calling this meme ‚Äòhate mongering‚Äô deserves ridixule. Anyone without severe autism would‚Äôve been able to deduce that.

Stolen from [my old post](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9ihwsx/the_classic_wow_exercise_program/), my plan is going to be 3 of these bullet points for every death or flightpath I take:

* 10 push-ups

* 10 curls  
---
* 10 tricep extensions

* 10 bent rows

* 10 squats

Westfall, Duskwood, Western Plague Lands, STV (for the quests not the PvP)

Yea it was seriously disgusting. I tried to explain to people how it would be so easy to exploit and got downvoted as a hater.
---
What I don't understand is what's causing the mobs to disappear if these people aren't getting invited to a group? Is it actively changing what layer you're on when you're just out farming mobs? If so that's ridiculous
---
Not stolen at all! Lol! It must be stolen if two people out of billions of people have a similar thought. Good one dude ;P
---
everyone had T2 and or rank 14 gear
---
Do savory deviate delights change hitboxes in the beta?
---
Don't be such a cocky shit. You argued that you don't know anyone who hasn't done Ulduar, I replied that your anecdotal evidence means jack shit.
---
You argued that the dungeons were solid, I agreed but laid out that the problem with them was a scaling problem
---
You argued that Artha's story was badly done (which I can only assume was meant to relitivize my argument that the Arthas plot played a substantial part in why there were so many players) and I said that your personal opinion on this does not reflect the general opinion on this matter, as most people really loved the character from WC3 and thusly wanted to experience how it plays out. 
---
Then I assume you argued that WotlK crushed the base game (you wrote WoW crushed the base game but that was likely a typo because that sentence makes 0 sense) on numbers, which is an entirely asinine argument since WotlK had a huge headstart through classic and BC and barely got any new players to play. Vanilla went from 0 to 8 mio players, BC from 8 to 11.x mio and WotlK from 11.x to just under 12.5. Arguing that WotlK somehow raked in so many players is just contra fact. It barely improved on TBC.
---
Whatever makes you think that I'm not adressing the stuff you argue I don't know. But it's kidna aggravating to get that thrown in my face when it's evidently untrue. Fucking rude, man.
---
I don't know why I do it, but I constantly jump everywhere, even just walking.
---
Lol, make more servers. That brings you to DEAD servers.
---
Oh boy mages and warlocks start off really low...
---
Did you not watch the video?
---
There's not infinite layers, but there's multiple layers for sure. That's all it takes. Instead of one Iron ore node, you can get multiple. That's all it takes to effect the economy
---
If you don't believe me, go to youtube and search "supply and demand"
---
Right there with ya... although I still dabble on BfA granted not to do anything other than farm not or mounts.
---
I heard that there arent any feasible feral specs, but that you instead run restoration, any truth in that? I would love to do dungeons too, either tank/dps or if resto, healer.
---
Thanks for your answers
---
Good list! Every should get in on it to be healthy while kicking ass in Classic WoW
---
I see RP a bit different. You are role playing so if you are role playing a PvP scenario you turn PvP on otherwise you keep it off. 
---
I am not claiming to be an expert on this, hence my language in the post. PvP servers are by far the vast majority of the game and provides a different kind of gameplay. If you can explain what the difference is between role playing and PvP role playing I would love to understand it.
---
Jewelcrafting/inscription first came in TBC so you can scratch that.
---
Would layering affect this? Honestly if they will corner a single layers market will it not be the same outcome?
---
Strat phalange (pour Phalange √âcarlate si je dis pas de b√™tises)
---
Wow great analysis.
---
Assuming that means you're in T2 as well? If so it should have been fine, some classes did have high damage (Mages with trinkets and arcane power hurt) but a lot of classes could play around it, in fact most could in some form if they saw it coming.
---
The intention is for likeminded players to be put into a single server so as to have an active community.  It‚Äôs not like we‚Äôve never seen a troll before.
---
It‚Äôs a mod that has been around since early Vanilla and does not go against the TOS in any way. I used it from Vanilla through Cataclysm without issue. When I renewed my subscription recently it was one of the first mods I looked for.
---
I used to recommend it to anyone that disliked the gun noise, because you don‚Äôt need to be a hunter to use it.
---
&gt; If they are confirmed bugs and blizzard can implement a stable experience WITH OUT any way of node/npc abuse and random NPC phasing I will be fine with layering
---
They aren't confirmed bugs dude. This is exactly how layering is supposed to work. It will not change before launch. THIS. IS. LAYERING.
---
Exactly. Do I like layering? No, of course I don't. I don't see any other solution, and I have yet to see any realistic solution. Just a bunch of crying and whining.
---
If layering stops us from having 5 hour queue times at launch, aren't we just pushing that problem down the road?
---
If we have a server that would have had a 3k pop cap but instead can have a 30k pop cap, with 10 layers at 3k a layer. Sure we won't have queue times at launch, but come phase 2 and layering is turned off, if even half of the population wants to come and do some dire maul or do some wPvP... That's 15 thousand people trying to get on a 3k pop server, you're going to have worse queue times, especially on a weekend.
---
And this time you don't really have the option to go roll on a lower pop server instead of wait in queue, because they've got your 60 main held hostage behind that queue.
---
I understand the benefits of layering, but is queue times really one of those benefits? Or aren't we just shooting ourselves in the foot to save a headache?
---
There's another two quests that require 150g each, plus argent dawn mana biscuits for a couple gold.

That's what they want. They want you to sub right now and play 8.2 in two days. Blizzard has planned all these dates really carefully to get people to sub 3 months before Classic.
---
Being slightly harder than just mashing buttons does not constitute difficult.
---
try searching its literally getting posted every 30 minutes
---
Female Human...god the things I would do if they were real.
---
That seems like a bad guide for 3 full levels of grinding or one specifically incorporating mage grinding spots.  
---
Demon Quests in southern desolace is like 44-46 range
---
Feralas is 45-50 quests
---
Azshara doesn't have a lot of quests, but the archmage line is a lot of xp for just running around at around 47-48
---
All of hinterlands in late 40s
---
Searing gorge is 47+
---
Priate, the island with the monkeys, and elite giant quest in southern STV are late 40s
---
if you did the chicken escort in tanaris, feralas, and hinterlands then you get a giant bonus for doing all 3 that turns in in booty bay
---
Southern Tanaris noggenfogger+silithid quests is 48-50
---
Also you can get the quests for ZF in this range, and the quests for mara as you approach 50.  Spamming dungeons usually isn't that effecient, but if you have all the quests a single run is quite good.
---
Someone needs to tell Best Buy that not very many people have computers that won‚Äôt run a 14 year old game.
---
i'm getting a slight suspicion that layering is just a word blizzard came up with to fuck us. under the hood it works exactly like sharding in retail wow.
---
man, i don't know if blizzard understands the importance of realm communities and that sharding/layering is completely ruining that. not even mentioning the idea of a persistent world which is another huge aspect of the classic experience. if something as simple as a group invite can bring you to a different version of the world, where's the persistence?
---
blizzard's fucking this up for themselves. layering, non-language specific eu realms... what's next?
---
Honestly this is the best suggestion I have ever seen to fix this broken shit system.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unusjpGt8bY

That's a video of Imp Blizzard in aoe during Vanilla. It does look like there's a slight delay before the slow debuff appears. Doesn't seem as long as what's in the OP though. Maybe someone could take a more thorough look at it and compare the two.
---
Ahhh that's a real shame then, it definitely spoils the whole idea of "Classic WoW" and them quoting at blizzcon that they wanted "someone from 2004 to play the game and to not notice a difference."
---
WSG isnt even in phase 1.
---
But I always found it fun to pvp a bit in every bracket.  The class balance always changed and it was fun.
---
not just this subreddit.
---
How the fuck can you say first few weeks and dead servers (months) in the same train of thought. Are you mentally unwell? No one is attacking layering in week 1 or 2. You just lack intelligence and experience that Blizzard will keep it for months on months and ruin the classic experience. It's not our fault you have the memory of a goldfish... Or maybe... Just maybe... You're a retail baby disguised as a vanilla player.
---
Classic vs retail already? Classic isn‚Äôt even released üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Yeah man, you got the beta for sure. Congrats! The people who made the other hundreds of posts about the same thing didn‚Äôt get in, but you did. Make sure you sub for 6 months though, it‚Äôs the only way you can login.
---
I hear it runs on the same engine as BFA so not exactly a 14 year old game.
---
drep
---
The expectation is populations will fall off pretty significantly by then. I suppose if it doesn't it will cause problems but a potential problem down the road that isn't expected isn't a good basis to throw out a temporary system. At least some of the arguments like economy are based on problems that will exist, although the scope of it remains to be seen
---
Which will probably be true at the end of all of this, which is why LAYERING is the only solution. There will be millions trying classic out, way way way more than 05. However, not even a fraction of those people will stay, I can almost guarantee. What does that leave you with if you have no layering? A lot of Dead servers, or few servers with massive queues.
---
"Waaah I hate that there is a simple fix to my complaint!"
---
Any list of the best druid macros and such?
---
I don't really like elv/tuk ui, nor the default blizzard ui. I much prefer modular, simple, minimal ui built from assorted add-ons, with class colors and pvp bars as well as cooldown counters etc close to the center. Much like perplexity's setup.
---
Day 1 without layering trying to tag a boar
---
As I said in my other reply to you, more people will try it today. Doesn't mean more will stay subbed, but I can almost guarantee the amount that sub will be far more.
---
What's going to really suck is all the chatter on pvp realms about enemies lurking around and they aren't even on your own layer.  You won't even know what fucking layer they are on or be able to come help without dropping group and joining a new one.  Layering is a hard no for me.  I will not be playing if it is in the game.
---
I'd much rather see multiple name reserved servers that can be merged down the road if the drop off happens.
---
are you actually that dumb.
---
Anyone that isn't part of the hate mongering hivemind wouldn't use autistic like it's an insult. You offer nothing to this community except now this new level of idiocy and bigotry. Can only hope the mods step in.

1000g
---
Back in the day, after buying a new video card, I took my mage to Feralas just to look at the lush green.  Reminds me of rainforests in Washington state.  Absolutely beautiful.
---
That's awesome, I'm sure as hell going to be trying to do that!
---
But I will never shard hop to take advantage of the situation. It's clearly an exploit and I hope Blizzard will take it seriously and ban the people abusing it hardcore.
---
I think if you had a timer, like a hearthstone timer, to switch shards, but it lasted 1 or 2 minutes then it just wouldn't be all that feasible to use it. So hopefully they can just make a change to the *ease* and instant speed at which a shard can be jumped to.
---
You really want to believe that don‚Äôt you?
---
Why so hurtful
---
With the spawns being random will layering help? Jumping layers will not be like jumping shards in BFA where you can quickly get the same node. 
---
Spawns for these will still be few and far between difference is more people could randomly stumble on them. 
---
As for the 2x resources for 2x the players. Assuming all things are equal there will be 2x the raiders 2x the farmers 2x the causal. If this shifts dramatically it will change the economy regardless to a point it is no longer recognizable and the layering will not be the cause. 
---
Also the economy will be more akin to private servers then it will be to original vanilla, or some hybrid in between.
---
You can buy the mount, but it costs 1000g.  The training is inexpensive in vanilla/classic.
---
You need level 50.  Divine shield and hearthstone are both on global.  so you need the rank 2 of divine shield at 50 that lasts 12.
---
Poke fun at the people that shat on the classic community. Where have you been? This has been going on since the subreddit was created.
---
Classic good. Retail sucks. Give me gold pls
---
What if I am a mushroom?
---
Surprised i haven‚Äôt seen Un‚Äôgoro mentioned.
---
Tanaris, Un‚Äôgoro and Winterspring for the ‚Äúend‚Äù of the grind is beautiful and some very fond memories.
---
The massive wall will only be up to level 10 maybe 15. After that ppl will thin out. Some will leave, some will go to sleep, some will switch character.
---
The level 20 can be semi dynamic. The server can look at the top level 3k ppl logged on and force them on the same layer so for some servers the cutoff may be level 23 or 25. But there is a cap, say everyone past level 25 will be on the same layer. The chances of overcrowding are small and the world is big enough to spread out.
---
OPs insecure

**God wills it!**

The emoji movie

They did make an uproar, that's why Blizzard rebranded sharding as layering

I found some of my old screenshots from vanilla. I was very interested in unfinished and closed off content back then and spent a lot of time exploring. I couldn't find any screenshots of the "regular" destinations like Caverns of Time, Hyjal and the dancing troll village, but I'm sure most of you have already seen those numerous times. Hopefully the screenshots I did find is of interest to someone.
---
I know people are going to rage at me for saying this, but I'm going to play Gnome male warrior (tank). I truly love the looks of gnomes - especially in plate gear and with swords and shields - and adding to the fact that Gnome warriors are a rare breed just adds more excitement to me. 
---
My dream is to have a Gnome male warrior in full t3 with Thunderfury and Elementium Reinforced Bulwark (Chromaggus, BWL). Ooohhhhhhhhh!! Can't wait! :D
---
Fair enough. But shouldn't the "!" in !Shoot prevent that from happening? I'm clearly missing something simple
---
Lol I don't like retail, and haven't played WoW consistently since BC. And what the fuck do you mean? I gave alternate examples. Servers will be dead if they compensate for the people and make MORE servers, and then the player count drops off.
---
Servers will be over populated, massive queues and instability if they just leave it as is and allow 10k or more per server. As it is now, it's 10k PER layer. With multiple layers per server. Vanilla servers had a capacity of about 3k active players max. You think 20k players is going to be the same feeling? It's going to be insane, and you will be on here crying about your 4 hour wait.
---
Elites are usually not worth griding for xp.  The xp boost is not worth the extra downtime they incur.  It would maybe be better to target something that is equal level or lower level then you by a bit that you are able to pull multiple of at once and let the warrior aoe them with whirlwind/cleave.
---
I would think mostly harmstring.
---
I leveled a hunter in real vanilla, so I can happily skip it now, since I dont wanna do that again.
---
Just didn't enjoy the gameplay at all. BfA felt like shit. I never agreed with people complaining about loss of power at expansion launch, because it was mostly bearable and only short term. In BfA the power drop was SO MASSIVE (evident by how lvl115s could easily beat lvl120s).
---
And since my class is crit reliant and for some reason there was no crit gear and I never got crit drops in the 2 Mythic dungeon IDs and world quests and whatever I did, I had to play a different spec which I find horribly unfun and repetitive and too reliant on circumstances. 
---
The dungeons were nothing to write home about, everything just took forever to kill. I'm not saying I want super quick kills, but TONS OF TRASH that has boss like HP is just ... ugh. And then grinding..
---
IDK, I haven't had too much fun in this game for a long time (though Legion Mage Towers were awesome) but BfA was just nothing. The cumulation of garbage expansion design imho (although the art direction is beautiful! Props to the art team).
---
And I really don't see why I should waste precious life time farming tmog and mounts for a game that I no longer enjoy when I can just as well waste my team arguing how shit the game is on reddit. Seems like an addiction more like a hobby to me.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs meant to look like it‚Äôs in the game? I doubt it‚Äôs meant to look realistic
---
Guess the ‚Äúhumor‚Äù flair didn‚Äôt give it away huh?
---
That‚Äôs Endgame talk, where druids generally go resto and barely get an dps spot.
---
But for leveling feral should be fine.

If you're in a race to 60, then no. If you want to have fun while leveling, yes

I dont think you know what ninjalooting is, he isnt talking about rolling need on something and winning the roll. He is saying go ahead and steal loot from your party or raid as long as its not guldies. Random epic BOE drops? Ninjaloot that instead of greeding.
---
Haha my post is moving up the controversial list pretty fast
---
It's actually worse than sharding. Layering affects the entire continent and is bottom heavy leading to many copies of empty, high level zones. At least with sharding it's confined to whichever zone it's in.
---
What do you mean by region locked? Continents or countries?
---
I agree 100% im just making the community aware about this mentality, hate to see someone waste days of time on a realm they are not comfortable with

Dont want to spam more offtopic here, so I hope you get better whatever your issues are.
---
The meta is already known as the game has been out for so long. Also we have already seen that pservers had inflated values with mobs and I'm willing to bet raids were over-tuned there too. P sure MC is gonna be cleared the first week of people hitting 60.
---
Skinning during leveling is easy to keep up with. The rest I'd ignore until you get your first mount
---
Resto is by far the most viable druid spec for raiding/PvE at 60, as owl/cat dps falls behind quickly and bears are outclassed by prot warriors in almost every regard. but for leveling feral is always the fastest :)
---
during the early levels as feral you can still heal dungeons with int gear, I would only level as resto if you had a dedicated group of 4-5 that intended on mostly leveling via 5-mans.
---
Actually they did once in a while.
---
Jumping ftw üòÇüëå
---
I certainly don't advocate throwing out layering, I just think it should be changed so that changing between layers is more manual and has some sort of lockout period.
---
But I just worry about this problem of layering allowing servers to acquire absurdly bloated populations during phase 1. Then when layering is deactivated and we get player spikes during new phase releases and weekends, we will be dealing with queue times in perpetuity. Nobody seems to be taking this into account and talking about it.
---
What is the approximate cost of the warlock lvl 60 mount? I know it‚Äôs a quest but I can‚Äôt remember it. Is it soloable (don‚Äôt think so), and what are the associated costs. Or a link haha
---
Me sorry, me warrior. No talkie talkie.
---
Continents, like how it is now with retail. My question is that if I have a US sub for example can I play on all of the classic servers (except russian because of the different client) or just the US ones?
---
Does classic have in-game voice chat? do people use it? do most have it disabled because I never hear a streamer's teammate in battlegrounds
---
best time to do another extended fast.

powerleveling makes me forget everything.

Seriously, go outside. You seem to be unable to formulate a thought without buzzwords like ‚Äòhate mongering‚Äô or ‚Äòbigotry‚Äô. This is what too much Reddit does to your brain.
---
It‚Äôs not messed up that an element of vanilla gameplay was preserved. Just like with 16 debuff slots, it‚Äôs a technological limit for the time, but raiding was oriented around it. 
---
Spell batching is a good thing to have, imo. It just seems like their batch window is 30-50% too large.
---
Down rank yes, haste is a thing but very limited and hard to get and it doesn't increase dot ticking, just cast speed and doesn't effect the gcd.

The servers don't even have to have the same names as long as the player names share a reserve list.  You can merge Silvermoon and Bloodhoof together, keep the login exactly the same, and nothing would change.  People that log onto Bloodhoof would enter the same server as the people that log onto Silvermoon.
---
That it's not supposed to trick you into thinking it's real...
---
What happens if a big streamer and all his fans roll on Silvermoon 1, and some big/ popular guilds roll on Silvermoon 2, and after several months of play, when the other the Silvermoon realms need to be merged, #1 &amp; #2 are still so full that they can't be merged with any of the other Silvermoons. Do you then merge the other Silvermoons into Silver #3, and keep Silvermoon #1 and Silvermoon #2 as separate entities?

It's weird to see all these posts downvoted. Is there some small army of pro-layering posters downvoting anyone who criticizes the system?

Why is every class I actually enjoy playing in any MMO ends up being the most neglected or broken class....le sigh.
---
I'll still play hunter though....never give up!
---
If someone knowingly rolls on a streamer realm and doesn't expect this kind of behavior then they're an idiot
---
Yes this is just the economic argument, assuming population disperses the same more population means more people farming. If the dispersion of players are different the the economy will be different, I.E. if normally 50% never make it to 60 30% never raid at 60 and 18% raid and 2% grind resources the total number of players doesn't matter as long as the resources properly scale. Now if there is suddenly 55% that raid and 1% that grind resources the economy will take a violent swing anyway.
---

I am also looking for this, or a resource to help build my own. Never had to use macros before.

another one of those things you just have to keep saying because everyone knows it isn't true
---
you don't have to constantly repeat things that people already believe
---
Some of these are new to me. There's also the city of Ahn'Qiraj, can't remember how or when I got to it, possibly in tbc when I went pro with exploration. I think we could've went through Feralas and walked all the way, there was a neat house on the way
---
Great video. I would rather sacrifice a few days of launch than have this type of stuff anywhere in the game.
---
Probably like 600g? That's roughly how much it would cost a paladin I think, so maybe it's similar
---
Pves difficult, haven't found a solution. I've always been a big fitness guy/gym freak too, so I lift while I play usually. I rely on dying in a BG, going and hitting a set, and playing. In pve it just takes too long and gets me out of my rhythm
---
He already said warlock!
---
He wouldn‚Äôt have to ‚Äúthink‚Äù if he wasn‚Äôt spending so much mental effort wrestling with the pet AI. Something like that can totally ruin the fun. It‚Äôd be like warriors having a bug where they have to keep applying auto attack. It‚Äôs not the literal end of the world, but I can‚Äôt imagine anyone would play a warrior in that scenario.
---
Healing is just boring at low levels when you only have 1 ability. Just like most classes
---
This is why I mostly watch the Cat Danny highlight videos. Cut all the BS our.
---
People are extraordinarily over geared on private servers if you did any pvp.  They have better gear then typically ever existed on a live vanilla server.  
---
Early on healers dominate damage dealers in a pure race, and healers only lose to running out of mana or getting controlled.  
---
For example in pve pre-raid bis, most damage dealers will be doing 300-350 dps to start off, and maybe a bit less.  In pvp gear with higher stamina expect even lower dps numbers, although it might be a bit more bursty.  
---
Priests and shamans start with flash heal and lesser healing wave respectively.  In moderate pvp gear it will be healing for around 600hps.  
---
Paladin flash of light is a bit weaker, but it scales massively with +healing.  They do have another heal, holy light, that is on the same hps as priest and shamans, but it is slower and often heals for the targets entire bar in early gear so more difficult to use in pvp.  They make up for this by having bubble and other tools that make them harder to control.  High base defense+no pushback on heals+blessing of sacrifice making them break poly, blind, traps, and seduce.  
---
Druids healing is a bit odd, but it still high enough to outheal any 1 dps in a pure race.
---
Because what else am I going to do until launch? Already got my hearing spreadsheets ready, questing route mapped, profession gathering guide and crafting guide pit together...
---
Tank resist gear is most dark iron set which requires a blacksmith with thorium brotherhood rep which takes a while to farm. Rag is the first fight that tanks NEED fire resist. Dint forget the lbrs mind control trick to buff 60ish extra fr to the raid
---
Oh damn, you're right! 
---
Totally forgot about the global CD for both of those.
---
Yes tanking is a joke. If you think it's even remotely hard you are bad at the game.
---
Hunter pets never chased rogues after they vanished. It's when you see them in stealth and you click send pet to attack and they'll chase your ass like John Wick after you messed with his pooch. Or getting sapped on mount and there's like 1-2 seconds where the rogue stays too close and you can see them in stealth....dismount send pet to attack and /lol
---
Every portal even the portal create by mages !
---
Ah, yeah, I see what you mean. I expect that the kind of spikes it takes to get queues will probably not happen very often at all after layering is removed. Server architecture has improved, so I imagine blizzard has some flexibility as to how full full really is. The downside to that is competition will increase for farming mats and gold, but it's still less of a problem once a majority of people have hit 60 as opposed to launch day. 
---
The other side is that a dead server 90%of the time is worse than a over populated server 10% of the time. Classic depends on community involvement to work and blizzard can't afford to let that aspect falter. 
---
But I don't disagree that over population largely gets ignored. Part of it I think is that the issue right now is focused on whether layering should exist at launch and this is more of what happens when we remove layering. The merits of this point though is that it's part of the system, rather than someone exploiting the system.
---
As long as your name is RP and everything you say in /say is RP, you are fine
---
Then the people who complain about not being able to kill mobs can go there.
---
Except it wasn't. 
---
Spell batching is still there on live and you can definitely experience it's effects in some rare cases. It's just much less likely since the spell batching window was reduced during WoD pre-patch as you said. It was NOT removed tho, and probably will never be due to the technicalities.
---
well, sacrifices have to be made. the trinket is way to good to not get it. when level 60 i will go 0/30/21 specc which will make me a viable tank and viable healer, so getting the trinket is unavoidable for me
---
This was on the stress test, correct? If so, there are definitely issues with pet AI and threat issues that have been submitted. Unfortunately, while it's mostly been hunters submitting the reports, pet issues affect all pets, including Warlock demons. I did notice a weird stretch in the early to mid-teens when my VW was having issues with threat, but once you spec into Improved VW you shouldn't be having quite as many threat issues, and getting the grimoire for Torment Rank 2 should clean up most of the remaining threat issues.
---
As far as the pet AI issues; sadly, pet AI has been a sore point for Blizzard for the entirety of WoW's lifespan and I don't hold hope of them ever getting it 100% perfect, which is why I've gotten pretty used to macroing pet attack to all of my offensive abilities once I hit level cap. It's annoying as f*ck but it's an ongoing issue that I don't see ever getting truly fixed.
---
I came here to say the exact same thing.
---
That would also be an option but people would complain about that too. I think people like complaining
---
Uh... yeah it is and it‚Äôs valid... you don‚Äôt have to min max to have fun and include people in raids.  It‚Äôs funny because people like you are the same one who like to talk about how easy vanilla raids are.  Haha.  ‚ÄúVanilla raids are easy AF.... we need to min max then there‚Äôs no reason to bring non optimal specs‚Äù.
---
Ok bud

For me, always UnGoro for dinos and Winterspring for the snow.

It's not shadows. It's post processing. Generating shadows causes the straight. This simply increases the saturation after the processing is completed.

Alliance 30-40 is 16% Warriors, Horde 30-40 is 17% Warriors.

Are they done fixing bugs? =/= Do they have time to fix a massively bugged system, when the beta is over halfway done?
---
Lol what? Are u 8 feet? I can't see anyone needing 6k calories to maintain weight. A 6'5 behemoth muscle wise would need maybe 3500 calories to maintain. I'm 5'10 184 with around 10%BF and need about 2900. 8k calories will make you fat as fuck, and you can only gain a certain amount of muscle. The rest of your caloric intake is going straight to fat.
---
I‚Äôm super excited to do silver pine after undead starting area, then transition to barrens around 14-15 and doing the whole thing a little over leveled. Then pathing back to Hillsbrad Foothills for a bit... and once I grind through STV and thousand needles I can wait to grab my mount, get some plate gear, do some SM/RFD and finally do OG Tanaris for the first time in forever. Pvping all the way through
---
Oh my god, haha, I did too. It was beyond horrible, I was a teenager trapped in the "not like the others" mindset and I just refused to try any other spec. I wouldn't even heal dungeons! Those were dark, dark times.
---
Nothing will happen.
---
Blizzard would have let us know their intentions long ago when the outrage was at it's worst.
---
At this point we're going to have to accept we're going to have sharding for at least 2 months.
---
You can farm eyes of shadow and runes in winter spring from the demons

I like the art and story. Most of the gameplay was just legion 2.0 and yeah 2 expansions of the same crap... no thanks.

Defence cap isn't something you'll normally go for, and even when you do it's pretty damn hard to reach. I guess in a pinch I'd pick the armor, but I haven't done the math on that.

Improved SW is incredibly useful in a few select circumstances - when you need it you really need it - but oftentimes the points are wasted.

Thong is, you can use them as goblin spec, they require eng not the spec, thats why you craft then change to get all gadgets and better bombs.

The best way to be offensive is to talk about de fences

I can‚Äôt vouch for everything they‚Äôre saying, but I remember WotLK being particularly light on bugs at launch. Of course there were a few, though. But on the scale of 1 to BFA, Wrath is like a 2.

If you don't jump into it you get teleported to an anti-realm kinda like the dark multiverse where your group wipes multiple times.  "Damnit Carl we wiped cause you didn't jump into the damn portal you normal walking weeb!"

That was them saying they realized there was a market for vanilla WoW that was nostalgia driven.  This was clearly talking about vanilla before they had officially announced they were working on it.  It was in no way saying they would make a retail WoW without those things.
---
It even states in the opening line 
---
&gt; So what can we do to capture that nostalgia of when WoW first launched?
---
Again and again your defending vanilla like I attacked it. I didnt.  I like vanilla hell i spent far to much time playing it.  It was far from perfect then and retail is far from perfect now.  My point is and always has been LFR and LFD are non issues in there CURRENT iteration.  You honestly seem like you just want to pick a fight about classic with someone who doesn't like it.  If thats the case you wont find one here.  I myself am going to be playing retail and classic but I honestly fear for classic in 2-3 years.  With no new content things get stale.
---
Deus Vult!
---
Okay man. Was a conversation about there being no need for a battle between modern WoW and Classic and you got super upset and used autistic like an insult. Doesn't make me a snowflake, makes you a pretty horrible person though.
---
Retail is a clown game

you mean discovered 15years ago but some youtube/stream whore makes a video about it like they just discovered it (what they probably just did) to cash in on the hype with clickbait titles

I‚Äôm not playing a hunter, but the pet AI is in a really sorry state. And it‚Äôs not as though Blizzards always had bug free launches.
---
Live is 9 weeks away. There's plenty of time to make changes. 
---
Blizzard has been making a lot of fixes, and say nothing about them, so they're actually being quite *un*vocal about bugs/problems. They just fix them and move on.
---
Anyone who seriously pvps will want engineering.  It is like having an entire set of new abilities.  
---
For Priest(assuming healer), truefaith robes are extraordinarily good and will last you half of vanilla.  So I would recommend going tailoring on priest.  The good news is that, you do not need tailoring to use them, only to craft them, so after you get them you can drop tailoring for anything you want.  So I would level tailoring first, then mining as 2nd profession, as soon as I got truefaith crafted, droop tailoring and do engr with the ore/stone I had been banking from leveling mining.  
---
For warlock, there are robes that are supposed to be equal to truefaith, called robes of the void.  However they are not nearly as good, only a tiny bit better then some other boe crafted roibes, and therefore frequently skipped.  In the ZG patch there is a set that gives a setbonus of +hit% only if you are tailoring.  It is better then anything else for warlock for quite awhile, so a lot of warlocks will go tailoring for this, but it wouldn't be a day 1 requirement.  Maybe start with a gathering profession and just bank up some cloth until you get to the ZG patch.

Normal people and even normal people with a high metabolism can get away with eating way less. But I eat like crazy just to keep myself in this weight range, otherwise I end up staying around 120 lbs and I hate the way I look when I weight that little.

You talk about coordinates, so you were using private servers to teleport and most of this stuff isn't on official servers right ?

This is dumb. All WoW expansions have had much much wider beta access than this. Classic Beta is extremely small.

Dkp. There are different dpk rules but in general the more you raid the more you get.

But you got me, I did call you whiney and entitled. You're acting like you're owed something. You also made a post, deleted it and then remade your response. Why? So you can insinuate I have some sort of mental issue? Classy.
---
That appears to be a TBC era beginners guide
---
&gt; If you look at retail over the last several years for example
---
the pet bug has been there since Legion, now it's in Classic. It's not the only example, but it is an example.
---
&gt;Most of the gameplay was just legion 2.0
---
That's the most positive thing I have heard about BfAs gameplay yet. All I have seen (and agreed with) is BfA being a watered down version of Legion gameplay. It's Legion, but less.
---
That, and I love how many quests I can pick up in that zone and just do almost at once.
---
Yes, I find this to be true in most subs as well. I'm mostly here for the memes and because 4chan is completely overrun by incels and shit. 
---
I know for a fact I'm going to love classic because I literally daydream about it and I revisit games from 10-15 years ago all the time and still love them. The whole reason I'm stoked for classic is just so I can play the game as it was when I first played it, just like the first Witcher, several Total War games, and even stuff as old as Bauldur's Gate. 
---
People just want to shit on everyones parade because they're empty little teen/college kids who missed out on the golden age of gaming, and thus has no nostalgia for it.
---
Yea got em
---
Legit üòÇüëå
---
probably some bugs will be fixed, but tbh there's way too many bugs in the beta currently to be fixed in 2 months, there will definitely still be some issues @ launch.
---
Still gonna be fun tho
---
He's obviously joking, if you don't understand his humor and are posting this shit you probably only watch his stream to hate
---
Don't you have better stuff to do than watching someone you don't like ?
---
The beta had ingame party voice chat for the stress test
---
Well it‚Äôs disingenuous to say that sharding and layering are the same thing. But it does seem to have the same problems. I was happy with the ‚Äúwe‚Äôre sharding starting zones‚Äù plan they had. How the hell did we go from that to ‚Äúlayer the entire planet‚Äù. Just seems so overkill and sloppy.
---
almost as much shamans as warriors?
---
its so weird because back in vanilla i remembered looking hours for shamans for our raids.
---
is it because of all the enh meme rollers?
---
maybe it'll be fixed a few months after the public beta releases on 8/27/2019
---
That‚Äôs normal though...I do it in every game whether it be Mario to Halo i jump when i don‚Äôt need to all the time...and when you play one of those games where you can‚Äôt jump (like the tactical shooters where there‚Äôs a climb button) it feels totally unnatural and limiting.
---
Undoubtedly. It will make hamstring kiting almost impossible, as hamstring is not enough of a slow to allow you to walk backwards out of combat. 
---
In all, it will make regen much more important and armor a lot more relevant, if it is not changed before release.
---
Are you SUUUUUUREEEEE?
---
I mean I get what you're saying but there are some crazy mofos in the classic community and I'm not sure that this monitor space is necessarily sold as ad space. I could totally see one of the crazies here having sneaked that in and I kinda love that thought.
---
pm please as well if possible &lt;3
---
The stress test was designed to test layering they made small and big layers on purpose shoved people between layers on purpose for there data. It was not made for you enjoyment it was made to help give a better game
---
Name me one (1) layering / sharding fix they have implemented.
---
"""prvserveres think fury will be viable """

No clue, wasn't actively watching yesterday, scroll back and check for me

[unexpected as in mirrors vanilla wow population](https://web.archive.org/web/20050811003859/http://warcraftrealms.com/census.php) (with exception of shaman and orc populations), and not the RedDIt PolL?
---
Big True üôè
---
Every guild does things differently, the two most popular ways are probably DKP (points based off of attendance) and loot council where a group of the guilds officers will discuss who deserves/needs the loot the most, who shows up the most, who contributes the most. There are other methods but I‚Äôd say those are the two most common
---
What's it with people like you insisting that they know better what a post means than the author of that post? Why are you so hell bent on attacking that guy?
---
Guilds usually have a DKP system.  So you get Kill Points for each boss your are part of killing, and perhaps every X hour spent in raid, then you use those points to bid on gear.  This is to reward loyal players with attendance.
---
You also have a loot council. Which is more normal in a guild that has been together f√∂r a while where everyone understand and agrees to allow certain players dictate who gets what.  Based on either performance or simply what benifits the group most.  This may be more comon in a hardcore guild where people agree that things like Ret paladin and Enh Shamans arent really something you give gear to when a warrior/rogue needs it. 
---
In a PUG you will 99% of the time see simple /roll  - highest number wins.  Of course make sure you know the rules beforehand. So you know nothing is reserved or you dont lose Helm of Endless Rage to a paladin collecting ‚Äùret gear‚Äù.
---
nothing, this guy is a delusional BFA fanboy retard that needs to be put down like the degenerate he is
---
Oh shit, well I take it back. I was gonna say, there's no way any human needs 6k calories. But I don't know much about gall bladder issues. That's very unfortunate. I always have to force myself just to bump up to 3500 calories to bulk on muscle, so I can't imagine eating that much. Sorry man
---
I haven't been able to get hamstring to work on the beta outside of escaping death by running away
---
I think that‚Äôs cause artifact weapons&gt;Azeroth armor.
---
Kung foo panda kick to the face, I lold
---
You can mimic that by enabling PVP flag for yourself and if someone wants to foil your game they will. 
---
But sometimes ppl want to have just an RP event so most of RPers would roll on RP server...... I honestly don't see RP-PVP being more than a niche. 
---
In my opinion RP servers should be very flexible when it comes to rule sets to accommodate for all types of RP.
---
You're excused
---
On one hand, I‚Äôd say no, because that‚Äôs how it should be. If you rush into an MMO at launch, you have to expect competition.
---
But then again, Blizzard is inflating the FUCK out of servers, so it‚Äôs not 3k people competing, it‚Äôs 10-20K. That wouldn‚Äôt fly, and I feel like Blizzard thinks they‚Äôre too cornered to change their minds on this.
---
I can't imagine that they wouldn't have them fixed.
---
What‚Äôs this got to do with classic ?
---
Aye, going Warlock when I played rogue/hunter back when the game released. I never really got into playing warlock all these years I‚Äôve been playing but figured I would try something new
---
I agree with most of what you've said in this thread. But I think it would be good if we weren't so hyper focused on the launch of the game and considered what the after effects of layering could be.
---
I know for a typical mmo, the launch pretty much dictates if the game will fail or succeed. But classic is not a typical mmo, even if launch is horrendous with crazy queue times and such, I think it will still succeed. Because it has a diehard fanbase that will put up with it, and sure some new players may be turned away but they could just go try bfa. Afterall, classic is just a free add on.
---
But yeah I think the no-layering crowd is out to lunch, as we aren't getting dynamic respawns. I truly think the people who think that way believe they will be in the lucky chosen 3 thousand who will get to log on first and play for 72 hours and get ahead of all the plebs. That's why they want no layering.
---
I think layering needs to be fixed, and I think blizzard needs to be more vocal and transparent about it. If they said they've seen all the problems and heard our suggestions, and they're changing layering in such-n-such a way. That would make people around here much happier.
---
But as it is, their silence makes it seem as if they know of the issues but they aren't going to do anything about them because they're a nessessary consequence of the system. And we the players just have to deal with it.
---
Ah yes good decision. Guess that limits the amount of questions you would raise in here. Were you able to complete the next challenge too?
---
Jesus christ what did you write to generate that much hatred and what is wrong with these people insisting that you must be an awful person?
---
Do you mean layering? Classic doesn't utilize sharding.
---
That being said I don't think you should be able to switch to a different layer unless you're in the same zone as the leader.
---
thank christ
---
Was this supposed to be informational?
---
This. Only buy the skills in grind rotation while you level to save gold for mount at 40.
---
probably right, felwood is so easy to catch people because of how narrow it is
---
Why are the recent collector editions  ruining this maserpiece ?
---
Classic-BC-Tlk is all you need.
---
I hope so. Dual wielding is more fun to me for some reason and I remember leveling as DW fury back in the day. I wanna do it again kinda.
---
Yes, layering, thanks.
---
If this were the case, with Blizzards current plan, it would still be a problem because they have stated they'll drop layering altogether around the time of phase 1, potentially having supercluster servers by the time layering drops. Now, they might keep layering on these servers, but that smells like big trouble to me.  
---
It's an interesting edge case, and I think i'd approach it the way you have described it. If eventually Silver#3 get's very low, it wouldn't be a problem to merge them into either #1 or #2.
---
Wanna join?
---
I'm guessing he says that because vanilla wow takes a lot longer to get anything done. So to play vanilla wow and retail is essentially playing neither. Like me personally on another game that is very similar to vanilla world of Warcraft, but specifically not world of Warcraft, I've got about 36 hours in playing a very casual pace and I'm only level 30 on a night elf hunter. 
---
I couldn't imagine trying to hit 60 and crush content while upkeeping another online game.
---
I don‚Äôt have any numbers, but my points are:
---
#1 the game will never be ‚Äúperfect‚Äù or bug free
---
#2 they will address the majority of the bugs/issues in the first couple of weeks of the launch
---
I like ‚ÄúCarl‚Äù throwback
---
yep. it's a really beautiful zone too, besides all that.
---
roll
---
yeah, this really brought a tear to my eye. So many memories.
---
I hope more old videos will be brought up here.
---
Pets were pretty useless in vanilla as I recall. Never played a hunter though so I don't know any specifics but they definitely weren't easy to deal with.
---
Yes, this is literally the answer.
---
Started as a hunter in wrath. Probably going to main a warrior and mage alt. I just want to be able to do everything the game can offer so those seem like the two best classes for that.
---
the game will never be ‚Äúperfect‚Äù or bug free
---
they will address the majority of the bugs/issues in the first couple of weeks of the launch
---
That image is freaking amazing. If you ever find out how the person got the game to look like that with what ever source please let me know with a reply :D &lt;3
---
But what if I am ü§î*\*audience gasps*\*
---
Isn't the whole point that it will affect gameplay, making it actually playable until the tourists leave and it gets disabled?
---
Anyone find it funny you can just 1 shot Hogger at level 60 in Classic?
---
You're being super toxic right now, could you please not?
---
There was a period of time (a couple weeks maybe) where they released the 2.0 patch with unranked arenas and the TBC talent trees before the game was for sale and before the dark portal was open. The level cap was still 60.
---
Yeah so
---
Totally was. That, and ‚ÄúYou there, Check out that noise!‚Äù from Mr Smite has been burned into my eardrums since 04.
---
I think ppl dont understand Asmongold character...... it is satire. It is something like Stephen Colbert on Colbert Report. Similar idea, over the top, with a hint of himself for authenticity.
---
The amount of people that cant appreciate the clear and very obvious design choice of this picture is shockingly high.
---
It works for me. Whatever the experience difference is, you can usually get green quests done a lot faster. Faster combat, less dying, faster experience.
---
You'll spend more time traveling, but I think that it still ends up being faster than struggling with orange quests.
---
Maybe this is me wearing a tinfoil hat, but I honestly feel these dates aren't intentional. I even fell for the first hype sub, and almost the second one (since the stress test was open for any person subbed).
---
The two most common methods of determining loot rewards are Dragon Kill Points and Loot Council.
---
In it‚Äôs simplest form, DKP is like a currency you obtain and can use to bid on items you want. The person with the highest bid wins the item and has that amount subtracted from their available pool. You obtain DKP through various means, but the three most common are: showing up to raids on time, being available for the entire raid time, and being present during successful boss kills. 
---
This system can often lead to people colluding together to keep bids low and people being forced to take loot they don‚Äôt want to spend points on while they wait for the item they do want to drop.
---
Loot Council requires guild officers the raid team trusts. When an item drops, the people that want it put their name in for consideration. Then the officers discuss amongst themselves who should get it. They usually consider past raid attendance and performance, along with what gear has been previously given out. 
---
This system is entirely subjective and can lead to drama, but can lead to gearing up key players much faster.
---
Personally, I prefer [Loot Lists](http://onslaught-wow.com/about/), which didn‚Äôt gain popularity until Private Servers because it requires you to know all the available loot ahead of time.
---
In Loot Lists, every member ranks the items they want (one for everything before ZG, one for everything after). There are certain restrictions on what classes can rank what items, but ranking items for an offspec is allowed. There are also certain types of items that are considered of great importance that have restrictions on where they can be placed on the list (as a Rogue, you can‚Äôt rank 2 weapons in the top slot, for example).
---
Once everyone makes a list, those get fed into a public spreadsheet. You get a little bit of extra ranking for attendance, but it‚Äôs not enough to make someone that misses a couple raids a month to care. You also get extra ranking anytime there‚Äôs a tie and you lose the roll. Offspec items get ranked slightly lower.
---
This way, everyone in the raid knows what happens to every piece of loot before it even drops. Giving loot out takes seconds and is entirely objective, leaving no room for drama.
---
I don't see anything about loot tables in there.
---
Without even looking at your diagram, I completely agree. 
---
However, considering we don‚Äôt have to pay for an upfront cost for them to work on and bring back Vanilla (or as close to vanilla as we can get them to bring back) for no cost other than a monthly subscription, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a bad deal.
---
When you play Skyrim, you are only given a basic outline for what your character is. By whatever circumstance, you are a prisoner, and you discover you are the Dragonborn. Any other details you are free to fill in. That internal story you create in your head-- Your character has no magical aptitude, so you don't use any spells. They are a knight, so you use heavy armor. Or maybe your character is an asshole, so you use stealth. That's what people call immersion. You can do this in WoW too, and as such you aren't *only* RPing your character when you stop to type out an RP scene.
---
You can do this kind of RP on any server, and no one judges you for it, because it's all internal(ideally, please don't RP in dungeons,,,). But let's say you're on a non-PvP server, and you want to play a character who hates the opposite faction... Blue walls! No one is flagged!
---
So now we come to RP-PvP servers, where you are able to play out that passive, immersive storytelling *as you quest*, as well as being able to stop and actually RP whenever you want. Also, it might help to *not* think about PvP encounters while writing out RP on RP-PvP servers that much. The introduction of flying in the world played a huge part in the death of retail RP-PvP servers.
---
Shouldn't you not be able to also charm a pet on the *same* level as you?
---
20 pushups for getting ganked.
---
Don‚Äôt hate me for camping you; I want you to get fit.
---
No, everything is 100% done on live servers. You need to know a bit about coordinates to reach some of the places in the album though. I never used private servers, but prepared using a tool called wowmapviewer (?)
---
We will have to wait and see. Blizzard doesn‚Äôt really have the greatest track record with fixing bugs in a timely manner. Like I said, a lot of the hunter AI bugs have been in retail for years.
---
I think thinks it‚Äôs ingenuous to say they will for sure be fixed within a few weeks.
---
There are several systems in place and it depends on the guild what they'll use. Back when I played DKP systems were the most common. The idea is that you get DKP (Dragon Killer Points) for attendance, downing bosses, performance, whatever. Points perhaps weighted based on whether it's a progression run or a farm run. Then when loot drops, there is variance in the systems used. You either bid your DKP and the highest bidder gets the item. Or it's a fixed-price DKP and whoever has most DKP of the people who want the item, gets it.
---
There are many variations of DKP, bidding, fixed price. Zero sum. You can read more on any wow wiki.
---
I've seen some use EGPG system, which is not entirely dissimilar to DKP. You get points, you spend points, there is some fine-tuning in the system to prevent some of the unfortunate aspects of DKP systems (mostly inflation) and make it "fairer" to some degree.
---
Then there is of course Loot Council, where some of the officers are in charge of a council who decide to whom a given piece of loot goes. Optimally, this is done so that any loot benefits the guild most.
---
What is most common? I don't know what is currently most used. I imagine it's either some form of DKP or loot council. What will be most common in Classic? Who knows.
---
br?
---
I mean to have that many concurrent you probably need well above 20k per server. I really don‚Äôt think classic wow will be huge long term. The playerbase back in its prime was big because that generation of gamers was into RPGs and had the free time to play. Myself included
---
You guys clearly never played a rogue in classic or BC, hunter pets DID continue to chase you after you vanished, sometimes. It wasn‚Äôt fixed until wrath or cata where they just made it that vanish couldn‚Äôt break for 2 seconds after vanishing. That shit was absolutely the most annoying.
---
Implying you have the money at level 40 for a mount
---
I think this idea is better than levelcap but I don't really know, levelcap is better than what's on the beta now for sure. I don't think it's too late for them to change it, we just need to keep voicing our opinion. I'm not worried about any of the other changes they're making to classic but there are people who complain about everything. And then there's the other extreme, that defend classic no matter what. And that's how you end up with the state retail is in now.
---
I hope the layering problem gets more attention.
---
Ping is more than fine. Finding a raiding guild that doesn't raid when it's night time in EU is harder plus you have to deal with streamers and their fanboys, EU doesn't have that problem.
---
The pvp system in vanilla is grindy and convoluted.  TLDR is the more you pvp the higher rank you get, higher rank gives you access to buy pvp designed gear from vendors.  
---
After the pvp system launches in phase 2, every time you do some pvp action like kill a player or are involved in a bg(phase 3) you get some number of honor.  
---
That honor is estimated live, but tallied at the end of each day.  This is done because killing the same player over and over has diminishing returns.  You will have an honor tab that shows you the full number.  
---
At the end of each week you are ranked and given a standing among every other player on your server on your faction.  Standing 1 being the most honor gained the previous week.  
---
There are 14 pvp ranks, starting at Grunt/Private and ending at High warlord/Grand Marshall.  There is a maximum amount of rank you can gain in a single week, such that it takes multiple ranks of high standing to get to the top ranks, but eventually Standing 1 will be the highest rank, and each rank under that will have more players in it.  With the majority of players at a low rank.  
---
Ranks 1-5 are typically gotten on accident, from world pvp or by just doing a few BGs.  Ranks 5-10 require more consistent pvp with ranks 10-11 require multiple hours played in BGs per day for several weeks.  Above rank 11 requires a full time pre-made group that is designed to powerfarm honor as fast as is humanly possible.  By this point there are so few players with high rank that they will organize and create a Q system for the order of each player getting rank 1, so that they do not have to compete between themselves and only have to pvp as much as it takes to beat any rival teams.  
---
There is also reputation based gear from each of the battlegrounds that is typically quite good, this just requires you to do the BG a certain number of times to reach exhaulted.
---
I mean why wouldn't they? It's great for sales
---
Ive been ranting about this for months. Completely agree
---
It‚Äôs all good, it‚Äôs actually quite nice. It‚Äôs overly expensive but I enjoy all of the food I eat and have a large appetite for it all. When I first got my gallbladder removed and for the following 2 years after I had 0 appetite and would have to force feed myself just to get a couple meals down, I suppose it‚Äôs just nice knowing that now I can eat such a large amount of food and enjoy it. Sometimes the little things are the things that stand out that most people take for granted and prior to having these issues I most certainly took it for granted haha
---
True but tbh I mostly subscribed Early, because I was gonna sub for Classic anyway and might as well clean up my Retail acc before launch
---
I'm too expecting a lot of competition and I don't mind that. But this launch is an unprecedented event and, like you said, 20k on a single server for the 1-10 content would be insanity.
---
You're ignoring the July 19-20 NA + EU stress test.
---
I don't necessarily want an answer until it is actually an answer. Like here's the fixed version being pushed to beta, please try and break it. Otherwise it's just PR. But thanks for the cordial conversation, kinda rare on this sub lately, especially if you're 'pro layering'. I think the no changes crowd means well, they just don't understand how sometimes it's okay to change the architecture of the game while leaving the actual gameplay alone. But everyone's entitled to their opinions and hopefully we can all be one big community after 26 August and put away our opinions on layering and just play the game :)
---
I rarely spent much time in BGs when I was levelling. They're just not fun at level 10-17, 20-27, etc., and I wasn't usually at level 19 or 29 for all that long.
---
Dropped a ring in there last night
---
Bless up Bless up
---
BR?
---
lol I love the fact I'm getting downvotes my retail kiddies
---
It's too risk averse for the average person if you take into the average age of a redditor. Just google it for the finer details, but you're likely going to leave a lot of money on the table and lose flexibility when putting 20 percent down. It obviously depends on the situation, but for most buyers it's sub optimal.
---
Different, because you cannot recreate the same feeling in my opinion. Classic wow wont be the same as vanilla, the game will be different, you will be different, and the community will be different. Trying something new, making new friends, learning a new class/role is my goal and I think it is the best way to enjoy classic.
---
You misspelled Pussies
---
Mummm bathroom BATHROOM
---
I seem to remember never using the bosa again after getting the sfbm on my orc twink. It was more convenient, and the output was higher (crits).
---
I would definitely go for the bushmaster again but I doubt it will easy to find. 
---
Just out of curiosity, what made you decide on 39? This is the second twink query I‚Äôve noticed and both were about 39. 
---
I played in that bracket tons back in the day.
---
Hey!, I made this!
---
I don‚Äôt think raids past mc are easy at all. i spent a lot of time wiping in then when I was a kid and I expect to wipe a few times in classic too. Would rather have less moonkins and less wipes and preserve the already limited time i‚Äôll have to enjoy raiding again by playing with a team that wants to succeed and not waste time.
---
I've been tinkering with prot paladin a lot. I'm almost ready to release a video on it. This is a lot more viable than what has been claimed and many weak points are total myths. I've been able to tank all of MC, most of BWL (need a warrior to use mocking blow instead of taunt on bosses like flamegor, and chrommagus is not tankable by a paladin) and most of aq 40, I'm able to tank the magic twin more than any warrior ever could. Etc
---
How does it compare to mages? I remember leveling a mage and having to drink after every mob leveling
---
Hahahah
---
Thanks. What ever is chosen for launch, it'll be a compromise in one way or another. I just hope we can help Blizzard find the best method.
---
Of course they are intentional. Dude the second they announced the stress test dates I said ‚Äúwow they are like 31+ plus days apart, thanks blizzard you greedy fucks‚Äù.  They wanna milk the stress tests for every buck they can, which I honestly think is gonna give them some bad numbers. I got atleast 6 friends who didn‚Äôt pay to play the stress who have every intention of coming back. Blizzard should do one single non-sub stress test
---
Absolutely nothing
---
Well Done
---
See this is bullshit because nobody would ever know what happens if you don't jump in. Never happen.
---
What does being an incl got to do with classic?
---
Trust me US realms are worse than EU
---
Blizzard be good at marketing yo
---
What makes me think it‚Äôs not ad space is BB isn‚Äôt going to be selling the game so why would activision pay for the ad space so BB can push hardware?  I see this as some marketer thinking ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs hot coming out soon we can paste it on this monitor‚Äù
---
Kinda looks half assed too
---
It's probably not as easy fix, like changing the range a mob/player can attack. Doesn't mean they aren't listening, aren't concerned, and aren't working on changing it.
---
Guarantee a guild full meme specs and regular specs gets through naxx. Its really not that hard man
---
Yeah imagine the backlash if they charged full price for Classic. Lol
---
People are morons, they'll do it anyway.
---
I like playing retail. I like the conveniences. They could use improving yes, but I remember the alternative. I'm going along with this Classic thing mostly out of morbid curiosity.
---
Gonna roll a Retadin or a Warlock.
---
What's spell batching?
---
I started the week tbc came out!
---
Mine too, exactly like my very first character. But with all the hunter bugs I'm thinking about something else :(
---
Backpedaling the new meta!
---
Well if you honestly think the raids are hard enough that you will wipe with having a moonkin or two, you are going to wipe just as much without them.  
---
I mean honestly I was just get good, but that‚Äôs just me.
---
Dwarf Priest 
---
Night elf Druid 
---
Human Mage 
---
Mage will be my enchanter and tailor and will supply water for my other toons. He will be on my wife‚Äôs account so I can trade to my priest . 
---
Druid will be my farming toon.
---
Priest will be the main character i Raid with
---
You need an Americas subscription to play on any US, Latin America, Brazilian, or Oceanic realms (unlikely there will be any but US realms for Classic).
---
You need a Europe subscription to play on any EU or Russian realms.
---
You need an Asia subscription to play on any Chinese, Korean, or Taiwanese realms.
---
Artifacts just offered so many things that just got stripped. Not baked into the classes, but just tossed out of the window. It's hard to imagine what made them make that decision. Azerite doesn't hold a candle to what artifacts offered. And it also killed raid sets (which I like from the standpoint of not having to do raids for the best gear as someone who prefers dungeons, but I also understand people being upset about it)
---
Of course they kept the fucking mission table and the AP grind.
---
&amp;nbsp
---
I just don't get it. Legion was so succesful with few flaws (early expansion AP grinding, way too impactful RNG legendary drops, mission tables... ? I'm sure there was one more major annoyance but that's kinda it). 
---
How do they fail to replicate this? How do they bring back the sucky scenarios from MoP (island expeditions basically) but not the awesome rares? How do they bring back mission tables but not the mage tower? How did they not bring over the early high secondary stats to keep secondary stat reliant specs functioning early on but took away all the stuff artifacts gave us?
---
It's like ... are these guys literally mentally challenged?
---
That is an awesome reply, I never saw it that way. I agree with you there is a place for that type of RP story my concern is it enough ppl though. I mean There has to be a reason behind Blizz not having one. Maybe they have analytics that in original Vanilla they noticed a lot of ppl were re-rolling on regular RP from PVP server... I dont know.
---
Another point is it may actually be diluting regular RP servers themselves, so maybe RP ppl are complaining they dont have dedicated RPers and it feels empty.
---
At least the chat won't be full of languages I don't understand
---
Despite knowing that a modern potato can run Classic I'm still itching to upgrade my rig for no reason whatsoever. What's the matter with me?
---
Cringe
---
I like spell batching. I like spell batching with a server tick rate of 32 or maybe 16 ticks a second. Spell batching with 2-3 ticks a second is moronic
---
World enlarger is good for pvp, such that they nerfed it some time after classic.
---
I've been playing retail wow in US realms since WoD. Ping for me is around 150ms and on really bad days it's 200ms. It's worth noting that my internet sucks and I live in a rural area, so for anyone with a decent connection, it's probably going to be around 100ms.
---
Even with that ping, it's totally fine unless you plan on playing competitively. Also, WoW has spell queuing so even if you are lagging, you can queue up actions and it should be fine.
---
Every time it's brought up people shittalk it? Idk what more to say. Very few people want pvp to feel bad. Vanishing attacks and gouging blinds is still possible with a higher server update rate, but more importantly it avoids every other aspect of the game feeling slow and laggy.
---
Jesus christ people are overreacting
---
Were The Eternal originally Alliance on Boulderfist-US before going Horde? I might be thinking of something else entirely.
---
Lol ‚Äúmain‚Äù
---
I‚Äôll be lucky if I get anything to 60
---
Even if it was just a "We hear you on the layering issues guys, we're working on it, hang tight." That would go miles to easing people worries and frustrations. 
---
And hey no problem man, I come here to talk to people, not fight them.
---
Unless of course you're Alliance scum, in which case Fuck You and For the Horde!
---
jk
---
What's that?
---
I am you from the future. 
---
Do not level as Balance. It is not interesting. It is tedious, slow, and you have 4x as much downtime compared to leveling feral. The only excitement you'll encounter is how close to death you'll be in otherwise mundane and manageable situations. 
---
You'll be destroyed in wPvP because you'll constantly be oom when you need to heal or shift to run away. Int leveling leather is rare beyond rare, so you'll either be wearing cloth or your mana pool will be a puddle. Cloth wouldn't be a problem if you were in bear form, but you won't be. So it's a problem. 
---
You will either heal 5-mans or your invites will be few and far between. You'll roll against pure spellcaster classes and/or the healer for gear, and they will hate you for it. Your utility in groups will be in the toilet because, again, you'll be too oom to throw out that big heal or battle rez. 
---
You'll be slow. Instead of getting Feline Swiftness at 21, which increases your cat move speed by 30%, you'll be prodding around at slow-ass running speed until 30. Having Feline Swiftness also makes you unkillable in wPvP while you're leveling - again, less downtime. 
---
And speaking of talents, Balance talents are so bad for leveling, that the entire early talent tree incentivizes you to play feral. 
---
You'll be broke. You'll need to buy water - a lot of water. Unless you have a mage friend, that is. But of course, you won't, because you're rolling against the mage for gear. 
---
Everyone will resent you. You might see people here saying "Oh, I love those furry lightning chickens! Of course I would invite them to my group!" And they might, to a raid, as a joke. But leveling? They won't. Because almost every single dungeon group needs one of two things - a tank or a healer. And you're playing a class that can literally do both things. *And you're doing neither.* 
---
I'm you from the future. I leveled as Balance because I wanted to go against the grain and stick it to those min-maxers. It took me three times as long as it should have, I had a difficult time finding groups, and I was ganked relentlessly. It almost killed my love for the game. So now I come to you with this warning: DON'T DO IT!
---
Not in the same way, but you do get track humanoids in cat so you can "hunt" and you can tiger's fury aka do that cat wiggle, right before you open for some extra damage.
---
What are you on about? The lower level zones will be empty for high level players, sure, but not much of note happens there anyway. The worst you can do is farm copper/tin/etc. more easily but for the first few weeks that this system would be active for people are gonna be preoccupied with more important things anyway, and the AH will be flooded with genuine low level players harvesting the stuff anyway. Low level materials being easily available is far, far worse than high level materials being easily available to begin with.
---
This suggestion isn't creating a layer for every 10 levels, I did not mean creating a layer for 20+ and a layer for 30+ etc., just pick one of those as a singular cut off point for EVERYTHING above that. That means that 50+ world pvp would also just be busier. Instead of spreading out the higher level players over many layers, all 20+ players will be on the same layer, making the higher level zones considerably more packed.
---
That, my good sir is your doom!
---
I‚Äôve heard of some guilds aiming for MC clear on launch week although we‚Äôll see if it‚Äôs possible when hitting 60 maybe takes 4 IRL days.
---
11 isn‚Äôt little. Let him pick what we wants to play. He‚Äôs nearly a freshman.
---
Nothing.  An urge to get the new shiny thing is nothing to be ashamed up.  Just don't be that person that can't afford it, gets it for no reason anyways, and the bills, rent, kids, etc suffer for it.
---
You spend your disposable income however you want if it makes you happy.  Just don't dispose of your income for no reason. :)
---
The thing they judge interest by the most will be the name reservations in early august. Stress tests help too but are primarily to stress test the servers.
---
I cringe at you just typing cringe
---
First I was focused on the creaking part and didn't get it cause I didn't read it well enough (tired) but yeah, the lack of "hit" sound is pretty sad, it's satisfactory to hear the arrow hit the target
---
Ha gayyyy
---
I believe gouge works but you had to unselect the target in order to leave combat in time
---
I'm not against them trying to recoup money spent on development and server/network infrastructure for WoW Classic.  Like you said doing it this way inflates their sub numbers by giving people access to play Retail WoW.
---
What could the alternative be?  Possibly an optional relaunched Classic Deluxe/Digital Collectors edition.  Some pets and tabards, access to beta and whatever else.
---
Level 18
---
Lok'tar Ogar! I'm playing orc warrior lol
---
Most of the prot tree helps very little in pvp.  I have seen arms warriors don their resist sets if a team is caster heavy and successfully tank enemy teams.  Fire resist set if enemy team has multiple mages, nature for a elemental shaman heavy team, and a mix-match of tier pieces for shadow resist against a heavy warlock/spriest team.
---
Wrong sub buddy
---
Yeah... I'm planning on playing a warlock, but right now I'm not all that confident in classic wow. Why pay $15 a month for an inferior product compared to private servers?
---
Your Classic release needs it‚Äôs own box.
---
Yeah let us just source some scientific literature for you ü§£ü§£ü§£üëåüëåüëå
---
Would love to see that vid, what‚Äôs your YT?
---
That not how you debate, you dont bring a video and say "watch this", no, you explain the material of the video so that i DONT have to watch it.
---
yeah launch week idk man unless they have plans to pull out the adult diapers and spend money for doordash
---
This. Vanish was broken, not pets. I played a hunter and had this happen fairly often.
---
This! This right here! :-)
---
&gt; Perhaps not to you, but to the players who want to take PvP seriously and competitively, removing spell batching will significantly change the game
---
Hard to find players more dedicated to high end PvP than Perplexity (OP's clip) and with this and the leeway vid he did, the implication certainly seems to be they'd rather not have it than these shambles of mechanics.
---
You know I couldn‚Äôt tell you if I work there or not due to the NDA right?
---
How it wasn't an instance I'll never understand. It has the perfect dungeon flow of trash mobs and bosses culminating in a big fight at the top.
---
Stranglethorn Vale.  That place has so many memories for me, of both Horde and Alliance.
---
1.Barrens. Because it's fucking big and the chat rules.
---
2.Ashenvale...because it's damn amazing.
---
3.STV. Because it's life and death
---
This is some good quality shit posting!
---
If Classic roughly follows the timeline of vanilla, Phase 1 and 2 will be 3 months each. Phase 3/4/5/6 will be 6 months each.
---
No I don't. They couldn't fix it in Legion, so I doubt they'll manage to fix them for classic.
---
If you're interesting in a more blizz-like experience, there's always private servers.
---
So you are saaying everyone who has played hunter for the last 15 years has shot them selves in the foot? DAMN, if only they knew they aare not having fun!!
---
This.
---
Well said. I can afford it but I have 4 year old i7 with 16 GB of Ram and $400 video card...definitely a want. Maybe I'll scratch my itch with a legit monitor. Have a 23 inch Pavilion xi that isn't anything special.
---
Hunter felt really good on Nost. It's shameful how bad they feel in beta. It's not even just a single thing but a collective of a bunch of different broken things. :/
---
I just imagine the Dr. evil time machine scene
---
Is that the sword of a thousand truths on your left?
---
Warrior as well my friend. May the winds guide you.
---
The best candidate I've seen is the nvidia filter. People are using thag for live wow and not getting banned for it.
---
Its smart. And if its worth the shot at beta thats personal.
---
The fact you wrote this whole essay and don‚Äôt realize how great it is for a rogue that they have five seconds to run and reach you to reopen and you won‚Äôt have your blink is a little embarrassing
---
By the way spell batching should be a thing (there really isn‚Äôt a game I can think of that doesn‚Äôt batch) but the tick rate should be bumped from the absurdly low value it is now to something reasonable
---
Warlocks are also one of those types of spellcasters that can pop up in a population that has absolutely no tradition of warlocks. All it takes is a single person that desires to make contact with the burning legion who can then be taught. There are even night elf and tauren warlocks, but very rare and arent represented in game. 
---
My original question about mages was posted because "mage" is kind of the opposite. While there are other types of spellcasters that channel arcane magic, "Mage" is a very specific tradition of arcane spellcasters that ultimately draws it's earliest roots from the pre-sundering night elf civilization, which was carried on by the highborne who eventually became the high elves. They then brought humans into their ranks. From what I can tell though, the "mages" never made a concerted effort to bring any horde races into their fold. 
---
Though, the existence of the forsaken should be enough to bring mages into the horde, and with TBC the blood elves are an obvious influence. 
---
If I had to guess, I'd say any mages in the horde not drawn from the forsaken the tradition is just a gameplay consideration, they're just "arcane" spell casters from different traditions that the game labels as mages for the ease of gameplay. Some of them are probably even shaman by lore.
---
You completely misunderstood the purpose of gouging the blink. Rogue benefits in both A and B, he wants to waste blink cooldown which happens in both scenarios and therefore mage doesn't benefit at all. Skillful move in this case is predicting the action of your opponent. If rogue succesfully predicted blink, he had already reacted in his mind before mage used blink despite pressing gouge button a fraction of a second later. Batching is all about predicting.
---
I understood what you are trying to say but you should have used a different example. Like 2 mages polymorphing each other, one of them was faster and doesn't gain any benefit from it which I agree shouldn't be the case even if it means no predicting possibilites.
---
Are you EU?
---
I plan on either creating or joining a late-night raiding guild because I'm up late anyway. I've seen them around so it should be fine. Worst case scenario you can make your own guild.
---
That is correct, but OP did not specify Phase one only or release content only. Just covering all the bases regardless of when they unlock.
---
After 15 years of elemental shaman maining I decided to roll mage because I like a serieus raiding guild more.
---
Choises had to be made.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Formulas:Mob_XP
---
&gt; Assuming everyone in the group is the same level
---
&gt; XP = MXP/numberOfMembers * modifier.
---
&gt; Modifiers:
---
&gt; 1 person group = 1.0
---
&gt; 2 person group = 1.0
---
&gt; 3 person group = 1.166
---
&gt; 4 person group = 1.3
---
&gt; 5 person group = 1.4
---
&gt; Example:
---
&gt; 1 person = 100xp
---
&gt; 2 people = 50xp each.
---
&gt; 3 people = ~39xp each.
---
&gt; 4 people = ~33xp each.
---
&gt; 5 people = ~28xp each.

&gt;The Silencer
---
ok so basically the calculation is you multiply the dps by the attack speed and add it to damage and just add it to dps? How do you calculate the +14 attack power? 
---
Thanks!! so basically the gun hits a bit harder but imo its negligible.  And if I can get my hands on uldaman arrows its best
---
Yes, everyone else is. There is no game to play right now unless you have the beta, which you do not. Sorry
---
you guys take this way to seriously and are missing the point imo lololol
---
This is me with Shaman.
---
Its not even that..you could always get into beta without sub.
---
Have you known them to ever do anything but?
---
I honestly can't remember. I think maybe the Gnome-&gt;UD change was part of it...? It was some of the last exploration related work I did, so if I completed it I didn't participate much in the next tier. 
---
Did you get far in the challenges?
---
14 Attack Power is equal to 1 DPS.
---
Are you in the beta? The game isn't released yet.
---
It still amazes me that private servers have managed to produce a more Blizz-like recreation than Blizzard can.
---
I'd bet that the twitch client will be a good resource for managing add-ons.
---
Let him pick whatever, maybe he‚Äôll goof around until lvl 10 then change his mind and stick with whatever he choise then. That‚Äôs what 10 year old me did back in early wrath andeventrually I made my paladin that I mained for 3 1/2 x-pacs
---
This isn't entirely true. There are ways to move at full speed backwards while remaining facing the enemy. Hamstring kiting will be harder, but not impossible.
---
BuT hAvE yOu EvEr GoUgEd A bLiNk
---
Even though hunter owns at 19 and 29... 39 seems like the best compromise.   19 is just a gimmick imo... no abilities.  29 is a little better but to be honest Hunter is just an unstoppable machine with the quest bow that does 20 dps... other classes are still gimped.  
---
39 just feels like the best compromise... no mounts for unique pacing... most classes have come online so its more fun.  I dont want to just faceroll.  Also for hunter specifically you get feign death, scatter shot, and flare.  Being able to trap in combat is just an essential mechanic that would feel shitty to play without.  I would honestly maybe go 29 if we got feign death at like 28 and not 30.
---
I personally hope so too, hamstring kiting just isnt a fun way to play the game.
---
Thats a pretty obvious out I overlooked haha
---
90% of the modern wow content is only there for transmog and mount farming. Thats one of my issues with modern wow because I have zero intrest in transmogs or mounts. Stuff I'm intrested in is M+ and serieus mythic raiding. But I was on a point of having to reroll classes to stay relevant. And thats also something I'm not intrested in.
---
I played a Rogue during Vanilla.  Probably the worst Rogue ever, I was such a noob.  Looking back and comparing my knowledge of the game and skill level its like night and day.
---
That being said no, I will not be playing the same class.
---
&gt;The key thing about vanilla and TBC it even drove casuals to progress.
---
I'm sure their internal metrics say the complete opposite.
---
It's like having two pets.
---
Engineering can help as well.  It gives you jumper cables so a 2nd chance at rezzing someone.  If the group is good, often the lack of dispel matters more then the lack of rez.  Also there are certain pulls where it is basically expected that a mage tanks for aoe, that can be quite spiky to heal.  Druids can somewhat struggle with healing a mage compared to other healers.
---
Your
---
Can we please get this? I can't join an NA server because of the timezone difference.
---
Jesus and I love you.
---
I understand the pattern. But I've never seen an interview, announcement, or confirmation that they use two design teams. Nothing other than every other expansion for 5 expansions is bad. I'm not saying it's impossible, but they don't have two design directors. It all goes through Ion. So even if they had two teams, I'm not sure why they aren't consistent.
---
Yea but you can't learn ice lance at level 60.
---
Of course they don't want what was shown in the video. No one does. It's not spell batching. It's spell batching on steroids. Read what everyone else has posted, jesus christ.
---
Yeah I get a chuckle when I see people posting like "will my 2013 Intel laptop CPU be able to run this ok?"
---
I dont know man. The batching is done on network packet level. I dont see how it would affect abilities in game appart for the obvious ways that batching work.
---
On top of missing the joke completely, you can't even distinguish the difference between "your" and "you're". Pathetic.
---
Fix it by removing it.
---
and they have 2 months left to figure it out then right? it's fucking BETA for a reason.
---
It's called RAS Syndrome! 
---
RAS stands for Redundant Acronym Syndrome.
---
oh yeah awesome dude, I'll take the anecdotal evidence of some moron on the internet over literally every well known pvper ever.
---
Same goes for jumping out of the AB gates or down the WSG graveyard. It requires you to do a 360.
---
The group with the most 360 jumpers is the group that wins 95% of the time.
---
Its a dedication to skill on the smallest levels and shows movement control and focus.
---
While this is an excellent answer, I think my main issue with it is that "mage" is a very specific cultural tradition. I don't think the arcane spellcasting done by the trolls would resemble it. 
---
But, I think that would work as a handwave for gameplay reasons. The troll mages probably aren't "mages", they're probably troll arcane spellcasters closer to shaman, but I don't think it would've been acceptable to make a specific spellcasting class for one race when they could just shoehorn in mages like they did haha.
---
Guess i got some youtubing to do, thank you kind sir or madam.
---
I laughed a little too hard at this
---
From what I have been told, melee leeway is triggered by the mode you are moving in, not your direction of travel. The reason you can backpedal away without triggering melee leeway is not because you are moving away from your opponent, it's because you are using a different run animation (according to north the mage, who has discussed this at length on reddit and on the magus cast.
---
If there is a way to strafe or jump out of melee range without triggering melee leeway, I don't know it. I look forward to your explanation of how to do it.
---
When they cannibalize it's just downright gross. Their asses wiggle
---
Spellcasting leeway was always in: look at [patch 1.3](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.3.0)
---
&gt;Spells in PvP now have a slight increase in range and area of effect when targets are moving.
---
The thing people keep saying is melee leeway is not actually leeway.
---
YES, leeway existed in Vanilla- but that's not the movement based range padding that exists currently for melee.
---
It's further confused by the fact that spellcasting leeway essential works the same as this melee padding, but there is a difference- one is blizzlike the other is not.
---
I think the haste buff I'm thinking of that made it relevant for dots must have been the legion prepatch (Insanely OP fun).
---
I'm glad we still have a bit of time before live as I'm less decided on class than I was when they made the announcement.
---
Hi, /u/SomebodyTookMyUser1
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c4a655/will_mr_chilly_be_obtainable/). 
---
Exactly.
---
Pservers ran with multiple language servers, virtually no GM staff and corrupted admins leaching cash from the projects ... yet there was barely any issues in chat because everyone knew the main channels were English only.
---
As long as players can create their own chat channels, everyone will adapt. Add to the fact that unofficial national servers will spring up immediately. 
---
I don't think anyone views this as a perfect solution but Blizzard is obviously on a budget crunch for this project. One thing they could improve upon is working with their fans who could help with regional translation of the client. Other companies have done this but Blizzard fans have been coddled children throughout the years and the separation between company and customer is too wide currently. It's why this reddit has gone to shit and why Blizzard main forums are a collection of adolescent whining.
---
You gotta admit, the colour scheme matches...
---
PvP or PvE? That‚Äôs a lot lower than a lot of ‚Äúpolls‚Äù have been indicating, where we regularly see 20-25% warrior representation.
---
16/17% is actually very reasonable and doesn‚Äôt feel overpopulated. If it‚Äôs representative of live classic then that‚Äôs quite reassuring.
---
So what is that?
---
&gt;at 0:50 you can see the rogue throwing shitloads of CDs into the fight and in the end it could've gone both ways. Later on he PvPs a lot against a rogue and the sham stood his ground.
---
Look at that. It's like I exactly explained how the shaman was able to fend off the rogue and how both have a fair shot at winning. :O
---
But telling somebody who thinks Stoneclaw totem is useless in PvP is probably a fruitless venture anyhow.
---
 I'll stake my life on that you actually won't kill yourself if Kinetic\_Wolf kills himself.
---
Is Vanish being used to completely negate projectile spells/abilities like Fireball and Death Coil after they're already cast intended and how vanilla actually worked? Do any other abilities (like Shadowmeld, normal Stealth, or Blink) have this behavior? I watched a ton of rogue pvp movies back in the day, and can't remember this being a thing at all.
---
Uh..... 100 squats burns pretty hard. 
---
Are you going all the way down?
---
Yeah, sure. The representation we got is obviously a lot more homogenized than it would have realistically been (and if you look at retail, most classes have entirely dropped the cultural elements). They went out of their way with it in the case of priests, and even then some of it is dubious at best. A Darkspear Troll Priest also would be far closer to a Shaman than what we got -- or specifically Voodoo Doctors and Shadow Hunters, but it's something.
---
But...neither one is inherently positive and negative.
---
Probably Pendulum of Doom

FACTS &gt; FEELING. Fuck off
---
Layering is sharding, it's just for the entire world instead of per zone.

I've just been telling people to use BFA, if you can run BFA on minimum settings, you're probably fine for the recommended on Classic. There's no way it's got higher specs that's for sure.

---
Layeing is good so you can beat more dead horses.
---
As the Rogue, you want the mage to waste his blink cd and be stuck at the other end blinded. This can't happen without batching because he either blinks and gets away, or you get the blind off and he has blink for the second you break the blind. Not saying one way or another is the best way when it comes to batching or no batching, just from a Rogue perspective in this situation, you want batching.
---
yes, but (FACT + FEELING) &gt; FACT.
---
Paladin and shaman tier items only started dropping for the other faction when the pre-TBC patch was released.
---
Once a Warrior always a Warrior. Nothing as satisfying, not even close.

Yeah, but dude, the bow sound. Classic is dead, or something.

Spell batching wasn't changed until WoD.
---
Spell batching definitely sucks and any PvP with it is buggy PvP. Worst times in WoW for sure. /s
---
The highest points of WoW PvP ended in MoP before WoD. I guess that means the best PvP expansions all had spell batching. All of them.
---
His original comment was 
---
&gt;	Yea they must have some high IQ person working for them. To advertise the next Blizzard game took some real guts and quick thinking. Totally spur the moment as we are 2 months away from release.

Maybe don‚Äôt comment on something when you didn‚Äôt even see the original comment. It was quite obvious that he was being a sarcastic ass.

There is such thing as Female Humans bud about 50% of the population

I'll probably end up using Caith UI v2.4 and just edit the code accordingly to work with classic. It's simple and did the job when I played back then.
---
Silverpine forest is my all time favorite zone.
---
Yeah can't believe I forgot that
---
I'm not subbed either but I was able to install the classic client when the recent stress test was going on.
---
Do you know how many priests were level 15 on Classic Realm 3.
---
Cool I guess. You going Horde or alli?
---
but did I get the beta? if i copy paste the last thread that was made 8 minutes ago maybe someone can answer me !!11
---
Have you restarted your launcher recently?
---
Gratulation, this is the shittiest post i have read this week
---
You, once again, devoted the majority of your post to a complaint no one here is talking about.
---
No shit, but what's good for blizzard and what's good for consumers isn't always (or often) the same thing.  And if blizzard prioritizes their money then that's understandable. But for me a release isn't as fun without the issues of so many people trying to play at once. It loses it's charm.
---
It's not just what made Vanilla special, it's what made BC, WotLK, Cata, and MoP special too. 
---
This thread is so disconnected/clueless it's kind of hilarious.
---
I hope you're right but I guess time will tell how the community will be a few months in. 
---
It's entirely possible this game is going to be as toxic as LoL or DotA2.
---
Not if you've got a minimum of financial sen... Aw shit! :'(
---
Barrens for the highest nostalgia levels.
---
Feralas because Ive never quested there pre cata I think.
---
EPL and WPL becuase I only leveled there in TBC. ( was around lv 50 when tbc arived )
---
Cake for everyone.

Somewhat. Tanks are very strong versus physical damage dealers, but if the enemy team has enough casters it's over. Tanks don't really have that much health in vanilla compared to later expansions, so without armor/defensive doing work, they die pretty quickly to casters, and warriors don't have that much mobility unless if charge/intercept is used wisely along with anti-cc abilities like paladin freedom or FAP. Definitely not recommended for premades but for fun games it works fine.

people like to REE, just give it a few days and we'll be back to "WHAT CLASS SHOULD I PLAY" being the most common thread topic
---
The highest points of WoW PvP ended in MoP before WoD. I guess that means the best PvP expansions all had spell batching. All of them. Not like those are considered the golden times of WoW PvP or anything.
---
But my toaster can run classic WoW no need for a new pc lol
---
&gt; N-no, y-you are the one tossing insults! Ha, gotcha!
---
Why are so many people on this website like this?
---
100ms is 0.1sec. Fyi
---
This is a non-issue for at least a couple of reasons:
---
a) He seems to be joking, by which we can dismiss this out of hand.
---
b) If it is an upgrade it isn‚Äôt considered ninja-looting. Caveats to this would be rolling for off-spec or master looting the item without prior warning given to the group.
---
c) If this is public knowledge it will be easier to avoid people who exhibit that behavior, if they are members of his guild.
---
Every expansion up until WoD had batching
---
If you're in the beta, it says "Beta: World of Warcraft Classic." If it just says "World of Warcraft Classic" that is the stress test client and those servers are down until the next stresser.
---
Agreed!
---
Also let‚Äôs try to convince everyone that aoe grinding is bad mm k? ;)

Hahah üòÇ

DIY? I was thinking of getting an adjustable height desk and an under-desk treadmill, but it's pricey. How did you DIY it?
---
Self fulfilling prophecy. If they cheap out on resources and force layering on people then there will be a drop in people, and then they'll point to that to justify cheaping out on resources and forcing layering on people.

I played a Rogue from late Vanilla to early Cata, had like 250 days /played on him.  At the very end of WotLK I got my Warrior to 80 and fell in love with tanking, so this time I'll be leveling a Warrior main.
---
So much this. 
---
And happy cake day mate
---
You were advanced for your age.
---
You'r apparently out of arguments and have resolved to trolling me with stupid accusations while totally ignoring any attempt by me to rescue this conversation.
---
Have a good day, anyways.
---
br.
---
Outdated system got way better after that! /s
---
If you think the problem was ever solved you're in a different world. Problems like this still persist in retail to this day.
---
Thanks, you can have a slice.
---
As long as you understand Spanish.
---
There won't be rp pvp. They don't care enough about server pvp. Which is why we get dhk right off the bat. Terrible last version of AV for the entire game. And crossrealm bgs.
---
I thought you said little one? Dude, he's 11. Let him play whatever he wants, and if he sucks then let him suck. Kids can get good at games really quickly at that age.
---
It's almost as if spell batching was removed in WoD and everyone is using it as a scapegoat for problems that may or may not be even related.
---
Circlejerk thread.
---
This is maybe the third time this has been posted?
---
That book has such a low droprate that its considered effectively impossible to farm. It's usually much quicker to just farm the money to buy it.
---
If you put in the work guilds will be happy to have you. The real challenge is finding one that plan on bringing an enhancement shaman, and are willing to give up a debuff slot, probably won't be a problem in the 20 man's. 
---
Keep in mind boss resistances are a real grey area right now. Some bosses apparently having 300 shadow res cause.. fuck warlocks. Luckily you can just heal a ludicrously high nature res fight.
---
Mhhm a tasty mouth full of r/wowclassic, thanks!

Glad you took it literally, no irony intended.

No, no. This is me with Priest.

Now dont eat any more. Wait atleast 2 hours before having a second slice, it diffres between people how long it takes.
---
All of it. I want to experience the whole game over again. I'm dying to go to tanaris and Arathi Highlands. I want to do everything and take my time doing it. I have no need to rush to get to the end game, I already did it all. Now I want to fuck every dwarf I meet.
---
Only Beta I ever got into was Wrath of the Lich King because some guildie hooked me up somehow I don't even know. 
---
But anyway a top 5 wow experience for me has got to be completing hellfire ramparts with 5 DK's on the beta. Blood self healing was so clutch.
---

Yea and i commented based on that, so whats the problem?

yea someone forgot a skill for 15 years WHAT A NOOB! get over your self.
---
That‚Äôs fine, so I can scroll through all the shitposts that repeat for months now
---
Two that won't work: burpess while on flight path because fuck that nobody can do burpees for 20 minutes and whenever you gank somebody because you won't have time to do it between ganks but I guess it can build up?

I remember getting a level 36 paladin transferred to my account from my brother, i bought a cool looking sword on the auction house and auto-attacked raptors for hours, cant wait to do it again.
---

---
Dude, you‚Äòre everywhere. Happy cake day!
---
Idk what to tell you; viable and optimal are 2 different things and you can easily complete all the content will multiple rets/hybrid dps. It‚Äôs funny how people bitch about how piss easy all the raids are, those same people would rather wait an extra 2 hours to form the raid instead of taking 1-2 non optimal specs. Its absolutely retarded.
---
This argument could be said for any role though. Most of it entirely depends on the class. Holy paladins in PVE for example aren't particularly engaging. You buff people and spam flash of light majority of the time.
---
The only retail baby is you. I've probably been playing wow longer than you've been alive. I lived through the shitty Vanilla launch where you were stuck in queue (not playing), crashing servers(not playing), roll backs(not playing and losing progress) and overpopulated zones(playing.. But barely since it was a lagfest)... Notice a theme here? You guys want to basically not play. Who fucking cares if a 15 year old game has a shitty economy or a few asshats exploit layering, its a 15 year old game thats been "won" a thousand times over over a decade ago.
---
I'll be enjoying playing, if you want to not play, go for it. Wont affect me and neither will layering, a temporary measure that will allow more people to play. I'll see you in January when layering is gone I guess.
---
Stop trying to fix a system you don't understand
---
Maybe he's socially inept. Some people have terrible communication skills.
---
I can see why you'd think he was being sarcastic but what's the point in bursting into a flame war with him when he says "that's not how I meant it"? What's your ultimate goal with continuously abusing him?
---
If he's telling the truth and just worded horribly bad, you're making an ass out of yourself.
---
If you're correct and he's trolling, you're just feeding the troll.
---
Alternative approach:
---
&gt; *seemingly trolly reply*
---
&gt; Are you being sarcastic?
---
&gt; No, I mean it as I said it.
---
&gt; Alright then, have a good day
---
**end of discussion**
---
Instead you have a huge flame war in which you either continuously berate and insult some kid with poor communication skills or feed a troll.
---
hi I'm Katy *holds up arcanite fishing rod* but you can call me the pendulum of doooooooom!!!1!hehe

Maybe it's not everyone else, maybe it's that everywhere you go, you say stupid stuff and people disagree with you? And we know, when someone disagrees, you lob insults.
---
I‚Äôd fill my bags with the Expert First Aid book (1g each), and sell them on the AH for 2.25g.  It‚Äôs been a while since Vanilla, but I remember they sold very quickly, not much competition, and I‚Äôd have to restock every day or two.
---
What \*is\* your point? Somebodies saying that if a pretty bad bug isnt fixed, they're rerolling. Thats not overthinking, thats wanting to play something that works like it's supposed to. lololol
---
The fact that you took the time to bitch about me not using google speaks more volumes than me taking a second to ask a question on a reddit.
---
Then perhaps we have different definitions of progress. Obviously most of the max level population beat Dragon Soul...because it was raid finder. Raid finder and difficulty levels discourage racing to beat the content, and per patch invalidation trivialises previous tiers. What metrics? The current raiding format is completely and utterly different. There are no relevant stats in retail to argue one or the other because the systems are so different they are basically different games.
---
Only if the colors will match the arrows.
---
I organized one at the office once when we were having a party. All non gamers had no idea what was happening and thought it was going to be dumb but then by the end of the night they were sadz0r and felt left out. 
---
It was epic
---
I couldn't remember if the Paladin one came out later or if it was there on release. I played warlock im Vanilla.
---
I guess I was thinking epic mounts but my point is still valid. I never actually did the quest for the warlock mount because I liked my skeletal horse.
---
The issue is that every server becomes full of non-intersecting micro-community's. 
---
Without a server for each language, you're left with three major languages being spoken. English, French and German. It's not that we don't want to encounter people who speak other languages, but these micro community's end up not interacting and it makes the servers feel smaller.
---
Add layering on to the first few months and it's likely that most people you encounter won't speak English as a first language. Some of them, not at all.
---
You can get by, sure, but it prevents effective communication.
---
&gt;Tanking and dps is fun but nothing beats being the healer and saving people from mistakes ***knowing you're the only reason the boss was taken down.*** 
---
This is just ignorance/arrogance at its finest. Without proper "GOOD" DPS, healers would be going oom...
---
Hillsbrad is the fuckin bee's knees
---
Get outta here Mr. Cake!! :D
---
Tell them you want them to play with you, and you'll buy the first month for them.
---
I don't think many people are too opposed to 1-10 being sharded, though. That seems totally reasonable. It's just the fact that it's the entire 1-60 experience thats a bummer.
---
Yea, another karma grab title, man, sure is fun to bash games these days, enjoy your layering and extra juicy leeway. 
---
Jeesh, just enjoy the game without this artificial hype shit
---
You know it‚Äôs ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt have‚Äù, right?
---
I will roll a hunter regardless but I am really having my doubts that they will get it down. I bet they can fix the auto shot bug but pet AI might be a really nasty bug.
---
Undeads the better pvp, troll is better pve. Choose which one you wanna focus more
---
There is a big difference between beeing pvp flagged forever when stepping out of the starting zone and manually activating PvP flagging!
---
Manual flagged screams into every  other faction player which sees you that you maybe attacked an NPC or that you have to be hunted, because they are able to. On PvP servers on the other hand it puts much less desire on you specifically when you are flagged, because everybody is.
---
Also RP can SHINE when you DO NOT attack the other faction player as soon as you see them. There could be multiple RP reasons to not attack each other. This is nullified if there is not even the chance to be attacked because the flag is off by default.
---
they can with macros
---
We can‚Äôt give the sword of a thousand truths to a noob!
---
Early on I'd always hit the AH and buy a long cape, regardless of stats. Tauren + Hillman's Shoulders + long cape?  That was all that mattered, haha.  Well, that and the Red Defias Mask on my rogue.

---
Your idea of spellbatching, server ticks, and my idea of spellbatching, the actual gameplay mechanic of spellbatching, are completely different things. Before from one unit to another unit all the spells made in the window would go off simultaneously in 400 ms intervals. After WoD every spell goes off as fast as possible between 1ms and 10ms from the server recieving that spell. You can't anticipate and "batch" a gouge in the same 400ms window as a mage tp. You have to hit it at the same exact time given equal latency to the server. This is because technology advanced like the other guy said. The guy you were a dismisive asshole to, and threw an "ain't" in there just to look extra smart about online video game network code.
---
So leeway affects you hitbox wich would result in a bigger hitbox for your Charakter if you move. So i guess yes it effects hamstring kiting
---
I think it was considered an outdoor dungeon by blizzard actually.
---
If you read the entire comment thread, that‚Äôs exactly what I did. I tried to help him on the slim chance that he didn‚Äôt understand sarcasm and had good intentions. He did end up editing his original comment, so good on him.
---
I really have a hard time believing surveys like that. The people who would take classic surveys are more likely to be vanilla veterans than not so they're going to reflect that
---
Maybe, but it's also hard to say how lucrative keeping that many server groups open and creating a new MMO(ish) on top of it.
---
Will they really have enough people to maintain all that? Seems like eventually you'd have TBC and Wratha dn other groups shutting down permanently over time.
---
Do it how you want to. If you want to mark down all of your workouts while you‚Äôre playing, then do them all after you log off, or before your next binge of playing!
---
The AI worked perfectly fine. The only trouble with pets was that they could aggro other mobs by being slightly beside you, like when you weave through Molten Core trash packs, or sometimes if you jumped a ledge, it would have to take the long way around and train a bunch of mobs onto your group. The AI was perfect and responsive, though.
---
This made me laugh :D
---
Once you find a good diet and foods you like that are low calorie, losing weight feels soooo easy. Sure, it does suck at first to say no to a lot of junk, but it's not too bad. Personally I think it's harder to gain weight than to lose it. Following diets are okay, but it's not the end of the world to substitute something you like that's also low calorie.
---
 Then once you lose it, you can eat whatever you want, but just take note of select food that are incredibly high in calories. For example, pizza is very very high. You can basically eat your full days calories when you eat pizza, so keep in mind if you want pizza maybe go a little lighter that day. I also would never eat fast food just because I think it's disgusting putting that in my body.
---
Also water only makes it easier too. Sugary drinks / milk add the calories on *fastttt*. For some people drinking only water can be the key to losing weight. Hope any of this helps.
---
This guy is driving me crazy.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if it was considered. Zul'Farrak was another outdoor instance but there's not many others. Could've been nice but because it wasn't an instance I made some good friends that I eventually raided with.
---
Low DPS rarely wipes raids, people fucking up does. And if you say low DPS leads to longer fights and thus more chances to fuck up... Well, true. But also, just git gud. Healers going OOM is the only valid need for high DPS but bringing 1, 2 or 3 more exotic specs in a raid of 40 people just doesn't matter.

That shits honestly way more fun. Everyone wants to rush through everything. So what if it takes an extra 5 minutes.

Yea, I hate power. Ever one shot a mushroom then eat that shit, hard?
---
The two obvious options are to kill moonkin for eggs in darkshore, or to save bear meat from darkshore for loch modan, and kill spiders in loch modan to catch up to the bear meat recipe (this will probably mean skipping the strider stew quest). 
---
Or, you could buy small spider legs off of non night elf players, where they are near worthless.
---
If I want to clear all raid content as a tank is going Night Elf Warrior really going to gimp me that much compared to a Human warrior?
---
I like the NE animations more and general aesthetic plus I plan to go herbalism which kinda fits the elf motif. I know the dodge isn't as good as the swords bonus but I also enjoy shadow meld during leveling and world pvp. But I'd like to tank raids too so.
---
You post insults like this:
---
&gt; Thank god for PvE servers where I don't have to contend with little man syndrome with a bunch of manchildren whose entire sense of self worth is ganking a half health mage ten levels below ganking while he's grinding panthers.
---
And then you get called out on it. But no, it's all the other people who are petty and toss around insults.
---
Sounds  cool :-) Not sure I can walk and write (am a tech writer) so probs need to stick with adjustable sadly.
---
Yw, I will be doing the same also. 2 months and counting down.
---
Here's the classic you asked for
---
Best game ever!
---
He obviously plays on an Rp-Pve server as an Alliance Night Elf Priest healer called Yelaeth
---
I still see it as a huge utility boost. Especially given that we'll have near instant powershifts in classic meaning we can use the instant speed engi items easy!

I mean... what are people comparing to before that they have done like this? Unless something huge breaks when trying to remove it, I doubt they'll keep it longer than that. Also, a lot of people assuming they won't ban people for cheating in live like this. Wouldnt they consider it exploiting? Also, I'm pretty fucking sure this used to be a thing in the past. Am I wrong?
---
Tauren Prot Warrior.  Be big.  Protecc your frens.
---
I played a nightelf in vanilla. There wasn't anything a human could do that I couldn't. Bonuses are nice but for tanks its far more important to do things well than to be X race. A good tank is a good tank.
---
That being said, I'm going human. I'm not happy about it but I want that extra threat.
---
Undead Priest is great for PVP because of Will of the Forsaken. Troll Priest is great for PVE because of Berserking.
---
Going more in depth, Undead Priests have the Priest racials Touch of Weakness and also Devouring Plague, while Troll Priests have the Priest racials Hex of Weakness and also Shadowguard. 
---
**Touch of Weakness:**  The next melee attack against the caster will cause 8 Shadow damage and reduce the damage caused by the attacker by 2 for 2 min. 
---
**Devouring Plague:**  Afflicts the target with a disease that causes 152 Shadow damage over 24 seconds. Damage caused by the Devouring Plague heals the caster. 
---
**Hex of Weakness:**  Weakens the target enemy, reducing damage caused by 2 and reduces effectiveness of healing spells by 20% for 2 minutes. 
---
**Shadowguard:**  The caster is surrounded by shadows. When a spell, melee or ranged attack hits the caster, the attacker will be struck for 20 Shadow damage. Attackers can only be damaged once every few seconds. This damage causes no threat. 3 charges. Lasts 10 min. 
---
Hope this helps make the decision easier.
---
Sounds...exciting!
---
Thank you for compiling all these videos together. Really setting examples of how this can be a terrible thing if it's not fixed and used correctly. I hate watching this shit! So ridiculous. The worst one was the gnome meeting his friend at the MAILBOX IN IF!!!  FFS!!

Kalimdor ones like stonetalon, ferelas, desolace, ect. Leveled alliance and spent most of my time in eastern kingdoms. I want to explore kalimdor for the first time.
---
I was just testing this yesterday. Farming Spider Legs is the best way IMO. I did that until I got the [Strider Meat quest](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?quest=2178) and then leveled up from there.
---
The website shows 122 (both factions).
---
Can you PM me too please, thanks
---
Thanks for the detailed reply. I hear Shadowguard is best in class because it procs blackout
---
I'm going to roll horde this time but Loch Modan used to be one of my favorite places.
---
What would be your go to main tank raiding spec?
---
The bear meat doesn't start until 40 cooking. That is the big problem. After that things get better with clam meat coming on board at 50 cooking etc. The difficulty is getting to 40 as a night elf where mats are sparse. Eggs go yellow @ 45 and spider legs go yellow @ 50 so essentially need 39 drops between the two to reach 40 cooking. That is a LOT of eggs or spider legs, especially on a launch where everyone will be killing the owls and spiders and owlkins for quests.
---
THANK YOU! I intend to do that because animations and f Tauren in plate is magestic, the most beautiful thing in WoW
---
THat sounds like scientific proof that shadowpriests are unplayable in raids. Thank you for your contribution, now see yourself out?
---
Gnome Druid
---
Just go by gut feeling man. I played a troll warrior back in the day and loved it because I was pretty unique since everyone was tauren or orc. You won't regret going with your gut I say.
---
sometimes though people just add characters in-game, not battletags.
---
This is the point I don't feel is being emphasised enough!
---
Layering, leeway, shitty pets, sharding
---
It's okay it's not going to be released for like a year
---
or 2 months
---
No it isn't. Wow vanilla isn't multi-threaded. The modern engine had to be retooled to use the old assets.
---
Multicore processors allow the use of layering whereas old server technology had to use sharding. It's all a matter of IO. Layering is far superior because it allows more assets to the players in a fairly transparent fashion
---
Getting the quest is easy, only requires 10 cooking. Getting all the way to 50 to cook that recipe is hard and even if you go there, its easier to level through clam meat at that point.
---
Oh god, how did i manage that. Consider me embarrassed
---
 Mindblast has a decent CD, and that's the only cast that berserk will affect. It's incredibly small. SG is useless in pve. Imo, troll is the better PvP choice. 
---
DP is nice, but in BGs it's very situational. You'll find yourself saving it for a 1v1 you come across so you don't waste it. Wotfk is decent, but you won't see many alliance locks anyways to be honest. It's still good, but I just think it's way overrated.
---
 SG on the other hand scales better with gear, and you can keep it on basically at all times, and it has a low Mana cost.
---
Ah, another altoholic, I know the feel
---
Is this guy an idiot? 99% saying they hate it is a blatant lie. Also, the reason for layering is to prevent lag and the struggle to get your quests completed against everyone at lvl 1. 
---
Idk if the video further in goes over that but the first minute is just click bait and lies for views.
---
The only way joanas record is obliterated on launch week is if there is layering abuse to avoid sharing mobs with the pack.
---
I seem to remember a lot of people were very against sharding due to how many characters would regularly disappear on zone borders and whatnot, although I admit I may be mis-remembering. I figured that's why they went and came up with layering in the first place, was to remove the random switching of shards from sharding.
---
druids don't need sharpening stone
---
This alone is making me less excited to play classic. Like that guy who was just clearing centaurs and suddenly got layered and it put him in the middle of three+ of them? I would be so tilted if that happened to me.
---
Hunters being partially broken at release is part of the vanilla flavor.
---
I meant more talking to people in game and reading trade/general chat.  The official forums are always toxic no matter what the issue is, because it's a very vocal minority mixed with a bunch of trolls, so I generally ignore them.
---
 I have no specific love for the retail community, and I very much prefer old WoW, but I also saw the classic community behaving the same way. Even in private server general chat while leveling, it was regularly full of people bashing retail, calling retail players trash.
---
Throughout the course of actually playing retail every xpac, legacy servers were almost never discussed in game, in my experience, until the last few years. 
---
It wasn't until Nostalrius got huge, then got shut down, resulting in a lot of private server players flooding the WoW subreddit and the WoW forums looking to bring the issue to light, that I started seeing talk about legacy servers. And the way a lot of those PS players went about getting their point across bred as much toxicity as the response did.
---
My point wasn't to say that retail players are good and classic players are toxic, they both have vocal, toxic portions of their communities. My point is simply that this community isn't a victim and should take as much responsibility for the quality of discourse as anyone else.
---
In Classic, if you don‚Äôt into the portal, you end up in Retail.
---
Epic. Which one are you?
---
when all horde got to shame alliance is garithos from wc3 meanwhile horde kills everything they see and be the victim
---
IMO, it's more optimal to kill striders as you move between quests.
---
Without classic Ill play reddit 12 hours a day.
---
I GOT A MOUNT!
---
Wrath had that arms warrior deep wounds things for a while, was redic. But you're mostly right, legion especially, I've never seen such a smoothie launch of any game/expansion.
---
Leveling will be a breeze, questing will have 0 downtime.  As feral you can tank/dps 5 man dungeons all the way to 60.  You can heal lower level 5 mans with a bit of int gear easy enough, higher level 5 mans(\~55+) will be easier with a resto spec.
---
End game is a bit different.  Feral dps can work but it takes a lot of grinding on the side (Manual crowd pummeler's, Pots and misc buffs).  With proper powershifting you can do some competitive dps but it's a lot more effort than some other classes, quiet rewarding when you pull it off.  You will also bring in some nice utility with Brez, innervate, occasional heals and maybe the odd offtank here and there.  I don't have much experience with dedicated feral tanking but it can work as well. 
---
A good Feral druid can hold his own at end game just fine with effort. Resto is the standard and a bit easier if you ever want to swap, then Moonkin is that meme spec that people only take because they can't fill the last slots.
---
China has it's own Region.
---
toxic thread is toxic, mods need to ban these threads and the OP
---
True. That's why you SAVE the bear meat until you start killing large quantities of forest lurkers in loch modan. 
---
Really, at some point, you have to either buy cooking mats, fish for them, or kill mobs that give you cooking mats. 
---
Personally, if it were me, I would probably just buy the fish recipes, do about 10 minutes of fishing to hit 25 skill, get my cooking sorted, and then go to darkshore and do the 2 fishing quests (darkshore grouper, then the 1-2 follow ups that require you to fish gears or something), because on a crowded server... there is no competition for those quests. No matter how many people are fishing, you can still fish quest rewards just as easily.
---
My shit has that too very upsetting
---
Remember when King Thoradin built that huge wall to keep out Amani Trolls?
---
Yes, Shadowguard can proc Blackout which is a 3 second stun I believe.
---
Yeah, I don't mean to say that people *like* the idea of sharding. But it was like, whatever, it's 2 hours of sharding and then it's over with. Now it could literally be *months* of layers, if the population doesn't die as fast as Blizz thinks.
---
That's what hes talking about, not clearcasting
---
A male orc warrior with mining and blacksmithing fucking a female gnome priest with engineering and alchemy. I'm into smart, petite girls.

i think you need to look inward. i made a little joke and everybody gaslights me? and the other guy calls ME the dweeb? jesus talk about zero self awareness. total yikes.
---
Maybe pets aren‚Äôt restricted in levels?  That would make more sense to me
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs petty. I main ally now and wouldn‚Äôt care in the least if the downvote was an ally symbol because either way it‚Äôd be cool as shit. But totally sick of seeing the other shit too.
---
You got a lol out of me, here's an upvote!
---
Get feared into whelps: 100 burpees
---
You have a dead horse you want to beat, you keep shoving it in to the conversation, and no one else is talking about it. That‚Äôs not rescuing.
---
I really don't recommend doing this. Clam meat is very useful for a level 15 food that is well worth saving it for. If you are constantly robbing peter to pay paul like this, It will likely be much easier just to farm or fish at the very start to get on a decent footing.
---
While leveling without fishing, 40 cooking skill is not small. If you don't intend to eat what you cook, I really would not bother with cooking until about level 30, as you can just auction house all this stuff for very little money on even established servers. Let alone fresh ones.

BLIZZARD CAN GO TAKE A 2 HOUR SHIT AT JOLLY PIRATE DONUTS FOR ALL I CARE!!

Former resto shammy main rolling priest because I've enjoyed my shadow alts and priest endgame healing appeals to me most
---
Ya, that actually isn't a terrible idea.
---
Devouring Plague is underrated.
---
While I agree since the upvote is red and the downvote is blue it would just be a cool little feature. I main ally but would have no issue having ally be the downvote since it‚Äôs true to color.
---
Was Rogue from Vanilla to wotlk, then went Enhancement from wotlk to BFA. Enhancement in Vanilla is subpar as fuck, so I'm thinking either Hunter or Shadow Priest. I'd rather not heal, so leaning more towards Hunter but we'll see
---
Yes but you still have to get to 50 cooking for the strider meat to mean anything
---
Don‚Äôt you love it when people claim something ‚Äònever‚Äô happened?  How arrogant do you have to be.
---
Idk man. It‚Äôs the internet. They kept telling me what my intentions of my post were and saying I‚Äôm wrong. /shrug.
---
 lvling my Pala in Redridge back in the Closed Vanilla Beta for the first time was an eye opener. I felt like i arrived in the game. 
---
Never played much alliance after the release but i might go back just to Enjoy some Redridge/Duskwood lvling

For a second I read that as "metal"
---
Backpedaling is so metal.
---
That might be an improvement, but it could still be annoying. LF1 person for Mor'Ladim! "Hey, i'm down, give me 10 minutes to get there, im in town.  they /invite, and then you're in a new layer, potentially swarmed by mobs and a Mor'Ladim in your face.
---
That is a concerning possibility, although personally I'm with Blizz and I don't really see the average server pop staying high enough to need layering past week 2.
---
I'd imagine they'll just turn off layering as whole once a certain threshold of realms are low enough and then activate queues and possibly free transfer off of the big realms, like wherever the streamers end up.
---
Still, it'd be nice to hear if they have a concrete plan for if realm pops don't drop as quickly.
---
I mean if you know the mages potential, it's kinda self explanatory. Mages make free water whenever they want. They have mana gems and evocation, mage armor. Those examples alone are enough to see the difference.
---
I test the game by playing it. if I had come across any major bugs or flaws, I would have dedicated a large portion of this post to that.
---
Guess what? I literally ran into one or two things that were so minor I can't even remember what they were and were totally not worth mentioning. So ideally I just post nothing?
---
Not going to happen because of the quests involved
---
And today you killed the English language, my friend.
---
Cheers! The more people steering away from the hunter class the more thing we can need... I mean greed on. ;-)
---
This is a major motivator for me to roll Troll. Just want to make sure that I‚Äôm not missing out by not going UD.
---
I intend to use as many meat recipes as possible for my pet / me.

Especially shields, they make for nice decoration.

Have you been watching the ebb videos too? He posted a video the other day about going LW and enchanting until pvp releases then going engineering and blacksmithing
---
Haha I also can't remember. I was so young back then, I don't know how I was able to complete the first part. So no, I sadly didn't get far. I remember having no idea how to even start doing the first one.
---
MC attunement can be done in less than an hour.
---
Yeah I really didn't post this with "sticking it to the alliance" in mind.
---
I though it would be cool instead of the plain ol arrows
---
Youre still shapesufting out, consuming it and shapeshift back. Its just a lot faster with macro
---
Ah shit, here we go again.
---
Once again you misunderstood the entire comment.
---
We are COMPARING wotlk dungeons to cata dungeons... not talking exclusively on cata.
---
You didnt answer my question from earlier... "are you implying cata dungeons are easier than wotlk?".
---
The word "difficult" is an adjective and can be used when comparing 2 different things, it usually also involves the words "more" or "less" to constitute the level  of significance in the meaning.
---
More difficult = higher on  the scale of difficulty.
---
Less difficult = lower on the scale.
---
Even still nobody has ever claimed in this specific thread that cataclysm  dungeons, specifically, were difficult (thats an opinion). The ONLY thing anyone has ever said here that involves cataclysm dungeons is the expansion cycle and how blizzard's design has changed between them... in this case: wotlk vs cataclysm. (thats a comparison)
---
It cant be this troublesome to understand this?
---
I dont care what experience you had in cata, nobody does... the only thing that matters is how does that compare to wotlk. Or did you not play the game in Wotlk? That would explain why you cant compare the two.
---
They have made compromises before, like with loot trading. This seems like a much more stubborn issue, though. They think they'd look stupid if they did a 180 2 months from launch. Perhaps we'll see improvement, but it doesn't look good.
---
I love the fact that you already before launch "know" for a fact that all EU-servers gonna be shitty?  
---
You are a "glass half empty" kinda guy right?
---
Yeah I hate that too
---
And you don't want to farm spider legs?
---
IDK, that seems just like the standard Tauren hit range to me.
---
Always go on private server if you can't keep hold of the itch to play
---
Warriors were stronger than private server players realize.
---
UUUUUUUUBER UBER LEEEEEET UUUUUUUUUUUUUBER UBER LEEEEEEEEET
---
???   
---
ROFLMAO 
---
\*both dies
---
fkin lel
---
It's still possible to hamstring kite, it's just less effective. Like you said it lowers the gap between 2h vs dula wield leveling. The hit rating system also seems different on Beta. You miss way less with 1handers compared to private servers.
---
I think the raids in both vanilla and TBC gave people something to strive for and the fact that not everyone completed them made them special. Blizzard removed anything special about them by making them something easy that anyone could jump in and complete.
---
I mean im comfortable enough in myself to not make comments like this, so yeah.
---
What do you want to do end game?
---
Spiders are heavily farmed for quests. There isn't an area I can go and just grind reliably on a launch... unless you know of one
---
How is it any different than how it works in Beta?
---
Dude, if you want to play retail play retail. Don't come into Classic with this attitude.
---
Coming for you Mor'ladim you fast hitting bastard!
---
Yes thats why I wont roll engi, although I will pvp.
---
Just watched the CS tournament grand final. Team Liquid won. The final was in France. They even translated the fucking winner interview.
---
Man this is gonna suck. It's not that I don't wan't to play with a french player. I don't like people who chose not to communicate. English is not my first language, but when I play on a English server I expect world chats and everything to be in English.
---
If that's the thesis of this post, you need to start over.
---
That's Frostmourne, the [Sword of a Thousand Truths](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Sword_of_a_Thousand_Truths) was The [Hungering Cold](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=23577/the-hungering-cold) (or at least that model).
---
I call posting this tomorrow!
---
Stay away karma whores! I called it!
---
Do you know that tauren have a larger hitbox? Do you know that that hitbox makes their auto attack range larger? That is what you are seeing in this video. If a gnome warrior was hitting people from the same distance, then it would likely be leeway.
---
I am not saying leeway was or wasnt in vanilla, just that this isnt a concrete example due to taurens having extended reach, so to speak

Originally, Hunters were barely finished in time and were broken right up to release. So it seems very authentic to me.
---
Ok Data
---
I always liked the Incendius run. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zqPR59cduw
---
I'm not sure how instance resets will be handled as you could simply invite a friend/guildie, promote them and leave group to get kicked to outside the instance portal after the boss was down but this was a nice 4-6 minute run depending on spec and gear (the vid above should have sacrificed his sucubus for buff and crisscrossed the boss room while flinging an occasional bolt because that boss isn't great at turning).
---
I'd always kill the two door guards because I was collecting soul shards but they drop decent BoEs too (CoD #1, Banish for 30 seconds, start killing #2, lower ranked banish for 20 seconds). Boss gives a large brilliant shard and the occasional Ace of elements.
---
Once ZG hits you can farm coins there (and the two mount drops if you aren't planning on using your guild's raid lockout)
---
it has nothing to do with being comfortable, it has to do with being a sensitive little ninny who downvotes and insults somebody because they said something crass. grow up dude.
---
Luggage Island in LochM is where I levelled skinning/LW, good times.
---
I agree with you. Still, even the slightest mention of "We hear you, and we're working on improving layering. Also, this is *exactly* how it works, so you know whats a bug and what isn't."
---
Theres tons of ways they could easily improve it. You can only swap layers in a rested zone, for instance. It still would be a bastardized, layered version of Vanilla. But I don't think it's likely Blizzard would go back on their idea for layering. Unlike how they'll easily go back on their idea of 2 weeks.
---
Is your voidwalker out of mana? Do you have the max rank pet spells from the pet trainer?
---
I‚Äôve only played a rogue on vanilla. Rolling shaman now. Basic questions:
---
Does +critical strike % / crit rating work for spells/heals too?
---
Does +chance to hit /hit rating mean for spells too?
---
Does attack power do anything for casters?
---
Please pass the salt
---
I would think that would depend on how many skinnable things they killed.
---
When you realize that the game is not easy and you won't be able to get everything you want, you will quit.
---
It wont be easy but its possible.
---
Worst case, spending a little time grinding mobs will catch you back up.  And if you are planning on leveling as a duo the whole way, you'll probably have to do a bit of grinding anyway.
---
Feralas, only because when I was leveling my toon during BC this is where I was when I upgraded my graphics card and I'll never forget how cool it was when it started raining.
---
Human warrior with engineering.
---
How feasible is it to make enough money by level 40 if you go double gathering professions?
---
I guess worst case I'll make due with aspect of the cheetah + the talent that boosts it for a while
---
So I can push a button and flag every player in a contested zone?
---
None of that was directed at anyone personally. Do you identify with being an entitled Manchild? Did I upset you by speaking about your people without consulting you first?  
---
I think you're looking for a reason to be upset. But because you made a fuss about it, I'm sorry. I was out of line talking about others in that way. In the future, I hope both sides of a discussion can be amicable.
---
SHAMAN! Its soooooo much fun to level you actually have to press more then 1 button to kill shit
---
That's fair, we're thinking of going NE, I know that zone has fewer then like, mulgore. Will we have to grind it out a fair bit?
---
Schroedingers horse.
---
fuckin give me STV and all the wPvP that comes with it already. As a filthy hunter i absolutely love that place
---
Dude, look at the range.
---
First talent point

I built my PC just before the Classic announcement. 7700k and a 1080, then my girlfriend became obsessed with competitive  Overwatch and wanted a new PC, so I upgraded to an 8700k and a 1080ti and passed on my ‚Äúold‚Äù parts.
---
We always find a way to bring happiness to our lives, if upgrading your PC so classic runs at 300 frames per second is your happiness, fuckin a man do it.
---
New York: 85ms, that's pretty decent, right?

Can you remember your first instance? What an experience!
---
I want to roll horde again for this, the nonsense and Ally attacks at XR we‚Äôre hilarious.

Can‚Äôt wait to hear about Chuck Norris and my Mom.

are u stupid. these clips are not even close to what we have on beta lol
---
that's not how things workout sometime.
---
What could be morally right may be illegal. What could be legal is morally wrong. Stating Truth won't always be nice to hear.
---
Phrases like - you can't handle the truth exist for a reason because there is no soft way of putting things. A NO means NO. A rejection is a rejection and you can't / shouldn't sugarcoat certain things w/o misleading them or giving them false impressions. Nothing in what Sivart33 said was toxic at all either. He used quotations on his statement that many others have witnessed. There is no round way about it. you're just being a snowflake in this instance. 
---
wait maybe I shouldn't have said snowflake, let me rephrase it, a nanny? a baby? pussy? a bitch? regardless what adjective I used, it's gonna hurt your feeling.
---
Wise words, my liege
---
He's joking... Also, can we not just post "This streamer said this!" in this sub? Talking about the concept of streamers, or their effect on the game, or some kind of cool *event* or *bug* that people should see is totally fine. But r/classicwow would be pretty hellish if it was just a Streamers fanclub/complaint forum.
---
if you go mining/skinning or herb/skinning, is it likely you'll have enough gold for your mount at level 40? I've never been too into the crafting professions
---
What because I actually want to play? The vast majority of people posting here aren't going to make it past level 10 yet they are all losing their minds about a temporary feature that will actually allow them to play the game instead of sit in queue all day.
---
As a mage, blinked through every one
---
People in that video are lagging all over the place, thats why leeway was needed. The 32:14 whitehit had a ridiculous range though, i think that was partly lag aswell.  
---
It just doesnt feel right to have such an unresponsive melee feel in 2019. Even if it was in classic.
---
Are you daft? People are not arguing that leeway wasn't real. Infact they are arguing that it was used in 2004 to fix issues in netcode that do not exist in 2019. 
---
The concept is it fixed issues that no longer exist, thus creating new issues.
---
You don't leave a band aid on a healed wound.
---
Reminds me of my old priest partner puukie. A good priest is worth more than gold to a rogue at least mine was to me great pic.
---
I feel like this is the answer. When you have to grind just grind skinnable mobs.
---
Toss up between Female Orc Shaman and an Undead Warlock.
---
Because, when layering is removed your on a non English speaking realm LOL
---
Ahhh thanks for the clear up
---
Thanks!  I'm the rogue! The priest was my best friend in game.
---
I‚Äôll pass the message onto my buddy that sent me the snap. You are a true god among men, he will heed the criticism I‚Äôm sure.
---
Just because you vanished didn't mean we couldn't still see you.
---
Between hunters mark, flare, and track hidden, classic hunters had your number. Zero break in visibility most of the time as I recall my experience.
---
I'll be honest, I would probably like to see some patch to talents/spells later on (after a good amount of time on pure vanilla) to accomodate for more viable specs.
---
There are higher level spiders to the east side of Teldrassil that people won't be killing for quests.
---
We all have to draw the line somewhere.
---
This is the comment you're looking for.
---
Classic projection.
---
Call the cops
---
And it's going to suck when layering is removed and your server speaks french or german.
---
Is it possible for an addon to just cycle between track herb/track nodes every 2 seconds or so? That seems like it'd still be almost as effective
---
I don't personally think so. Spriest don't scale well with gear. SG scales very well itself, so I think it helps offset that as well. I've played UD Spriest for a while and I found myself saving DP for like 10 minutes for a situational fight, whereas SG I'd be using it constantly. Not to mention the hex is good in PvP. Neither have anything special for PvE, so that doesn't matter. Like I said berserk is negligible considering it only affects MB.
---
True.
---
Does retail even have physical dungeons you can walk to if you wanted to for some reason? Feels silly that they'd spend time developing that if almost no one would use it.
---
I always wondered why Blizzard would discipline players who got caught in areas they weren't supposed to be in, like GM island.  It's like they are punishing players for being curious and for the designers not doing a better job of making them more inaccessible.
---
The best thing you can do is FOOD PREP!
---
Food prepping can take anywhere from just 20 minutes - 2 hours and you can get a weeks worth of food ready.
---
If you have an Instant Pot, it can be incredibly easily to meal prep. You'll have food waiting for you and you can just re-heat it if it's a warm meal.
---
Then again if you're going to stick together and duo you may as well pick up mining or herb to make use of more resources
---
It's a horse with 2 months left to live still.
---
It is ad space for sure.  Thats why new release movies are always on the TVs in ads.
---
I get right click report was exploitable, but I still don't get why Request to Join Group was bad, besides the "no changes"thing.
---
WHERES THE PAPER TOWELS?!?!?!
---
that's not spell batching. Blizzard ticks once per second. look at the timestamps of entering Blizzard and taking damage.
---
/r/classicwow : is this spell-batching? ü¶ã
---
Dont forget the 360
---
Fantasy: UD Paladin
---
Realistically: UD Mage
---
I'm going to roll Orc Rogue though
---
Ironic isn't it, that you are the one who thinks I have to realize stuff when you're the person who clearly demonstrated you have no idea what you're talking about.
---
But go ahead and think that after 4 years of playing vanilla I'm suddenly going to realize I was wrong about everything.
---
But it's not a troll. It's literally thousands of players that don't know about or don't care about your unofficial ruleset. How are you going to deal with 90% of the server population not caring about naming and being in character?
---
&gt; are u stupid
---
no need to get insulting kid, did u actually watch the video?  
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/p2sWF9v](https://imgur.com/a/p2sWF9v)   
---
thats the 10:33 hit, definitely more than tauren melee range.  
---
but we cant search for proof in just one situation, lag was omnipresent back then!
---
The differences between the two are very small. Undead is better for PvP, but not by much. Troll is better for PvE healing, but not by much. Really it's just down to what mechanics you find more fun. I personally enjoy the gameplay of shadowguard and beserking more than I enjoy the gameplay of WOTF, it ultimately just boils down to what you find more fun, because the difference isn't that big. Or which models/animations you prefer. And I'm not one to typically say things like "just pick what you like lol", but in this case I feel like it's true.
---
The lamp is nothing more than glitter, a red herring, misdirection, etc.
---
"LOOK AT HOW CLOSE WE ARE PAYING ATTENTION! HAVE YOU SEEN THIS LAMP?"
---
How about those damage modifiers?
---
"DON'T PAY ATTENTION THAT CLOSELY".
---
Since 'leeway' was only added after all classes had deadzone removed and the first class had deadzone removed in patch 2.3 - why is it in Vanilla?
---
"OK I SAID DON'T LOOK THAT CLOSE. WE HAVE A REFERENCE CLIENT."
---
Ok that's all well and good but then why can I get multiple kills on the same player on a dead corpse but thanks to batching he can self rez with a late heal after I already killed him twice in the exact same attack?
---
"LOOK WE HAVE A REFERENCE CLIENT. TRUST US IT'S COMPLETE DESPITE WHAT EX DEVS HAVE SAID."
---
This NPC didn't act like this at all in Vanilla, the behavior was changed in Wrath. Why does he follow his Wrath AI?
---
"OK LOOK, WE WILL LOOK INTO THIS WITH OUR 100% COMPLETE REFERENCE CLIENT"
---
Etc. Etc.  Wow folks with some simple tech talk on how they are going over everything with a fine toothed comb while the rest of the team is out back trying to figure out what to do with all the missing data they need numbers for.
---
They can phase between layers at will.
---
FUCK SALT
---
That's what I think I'll do, prob Herb+Alch
---
And the whole reason the High Elves chose the Horde was because they caught so much racism from the Humans, it drove them out of the Alliance.
---
Just pick a regular RP realm, use `/pvp` and shut the fuck up about this tired topic already.
---
I wouldn't count this as "listening to the community" when there are much bigger things to listen to other than "suggest invite"
---
Who cares?
---
I don't know, maybe the targeted audience who have wanted this since 2006 idiot?
---
I doubt that. I live in the US with 400/20 mbps internet and my ping during the stress test was 70-80 ms.
---
Ah yeah u right üòÖ
---
Orc shaman wielding a hammer and shooting lightning bolts just like thrall in Wc3 =)

If you block people for asking you if you want to run a dungeon then I think you're not really gonna have a lot of friends anyway :)
---
Dear RP-PvPers,
---
If there aren't any RP-PvP servers, would you prefer rolling on a PvP server or an RP server as the unofficial server?
---
RP server has all the rules you want but no contested zones, and the PvP server has the contested zones, but not rules to support RP
---
All undead players are now in prison.
---
Ahhh good old days üòÖ
---
why are alexensual fanbois obsessed  with asmongold?
---
Vanilla WoW was designed in an era where 200 ping was common place, and it shows. NA has played with 150+ ping for years and it's mostly fine. Obviously it's less of an issue if you play a caster, but with the leeway mechanics Classic has I'd say it seems like even melee is fine at 150+ ping.
---
First Deadmines run, ahh good times
---
Well deserved, you absolute weirdo.
---
that's the kinda range a non-tauren gets on beta
---
Hahahah best comment üòÇ
---
You have to walk to mythic dungeons.
---
Y‚Äôall married now ?
---
The ones that are by the little pond / dock? I remember there being 3 of those that I can run by two or three times. Good memory
---
You can push a button to get phased over to the other people who have pushed the button, and yes, over there everyone are flagged! Thing to note is that the button can only be toggled in Orgrimmar and Stormwind.
---
Blizzard makes polished games. Bugs will be fixed.
---
I leveled as resto... Lol
---
This comment section is gonna be great.
---
Blizzard doesn't have servers in New York, just Chicago and LA.
---
PvP because the lore is two rivaling factions. Not friendly snowballs that put on sockem boppers and have a pillow fight.   I want those annoying nights where I say fuck it and start an alt toon.  I want to relive those moments. It‚Äôll be exciting.
---
Find the classic druid discord channel.  Has all the information you need.
---
You ever gank a river lands girl? We called it making the eight.
---
Which part you doubt? I played the stress test as well and it was fine.
---
At least once every day yes.
---
&gt; take PvP seriously and competitively
---
there is no competitive pvp in vanilla.
---
And druids only have innervate, which changed a lot through the expansions but was really really good for a time. Unlimited mana while active but while on CD you're fooked.
---
Can someone share a leveling spec for hunter and warlock? We'll be leveling together and we'd like something that might sinergize and that can be useful while questing and in dungeons
---
ive not downvoted you or insulted you. Sorry others have upset you.
---
The cc break racial undeads have must make them better for pvp?
---
Yes you can account for names. When creating a character, check if name exists on Silvermoon1-300. Blizzard can modify the systems however they want, they have total control.
---
Having a 100 ping from Europe to the US servers.
---
Perfect!
---
They are all over the west side
---
Of course you will be able to. Racials make minute differences overall. If you‚Äôre good, you will be in demand. People always love competent tanks. Warriors are the most played class, but there‚Äôs always a shortage of good tanks.
---
actually im suprised he sees it this way.  
---
his opinion isnt that valuable per se, but hes influencing ten thousands of others, so it still has an IMMENSE weight.
---
There are no servers in New York.
---
Because the ‚Äúmuh nostalgia‚Äù fucking idiots don‚Äôt realize the amount of players that will be on during release, without layering it will be unplayable. Completely unplayable.
---
Thank God Blizzard isn‚Äôt listening to the entitled shit lord man children and are moving forward with layering ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Are there any good pvp videos where someone plays bgs and actually explains while they play their current raid and class strategies?
---
There are literal old gods breaking out and fucking dragons trying to murder continents 
---
Factions can fuck off. There's bigger things to deal with.
---
You should be grinding anyway. In all likelihood the starting zones will be mobbed at launch and quests may be difficult to do so your best bet is to grind.
---
I just see it as having something to look forward to as you progress through content
---
Miracle Rogue
---
..but this one happens to collect both?
---
True,but still a beginning is a beginning
---
People walk into portals?
---
Holy gnomadin. That extra int / heal crit.
---
It's pretty hilarious that you can just layer hop solo by logging in and out. That's the first thing anyone would think to exploit and it works. I think a lot of what you've described is how the sharding system in BFA works, which is why it's surprising that they basically just left all the exploits that they fixed with that system in the layering system. Guess I shouldn't be surprised that Blizzard forgot about a problem they already solved years ago considering how they've designed the last 3 expansions.
---
Look at the 2nd swing that dowsn't con ect at 13:10
---
"will not differ from the experience of playing original WoW"
---
How does that clear cut make them better? Everything is situational, and I've found on Horde that SG was much more useful than wotfk and DP put together.
---
Rating doesn't exist. It's flat % crit or hit.
---
Anyway, there's a difference from spell hit and normal hit, and spell crit and normal hit. If the wording doesn't include spell, then it's physical crit. Here's some examples: 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=17103 Mage blade, says with spells 1%. So this only works on spells.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=12640 Says crit chance and hit chance, no spells involved, this is for physical attacks only.
---
I bet you‚Äôre bedroom is baby proofed so you don‚Äôt bump your head or catch your fingers in a drawer.

Haven't played WoW in years, was easy to edit the image I found into this.
---
Congrats on the weight loss! I was the same way and blew people's minds when I told them I never exercised during my weight loss. It's all will power.
---
Leeway benefited warriors more than other classes. They way they were on EU private servers seems to have jaded many.
---
&gt; So I‚Äôd love to play on a PvP server to add that sense of danger, but I am afraid it will get frustrating over time since I play mostly solo. 
---
I think its exactly the opposite, the frustration by getting ganked is TEMPORARY, the sense of danger as an additional layer STAYS, world feels more real! :)
---
Asmongold has been bought and sold.
---
Oh we do, and we have a much better solution:
---
Release 3 versions of every server (eg. Illidan A - B - C) and then merge them into one (eg. Illidan) once the tourists have gone away.
---
Restrict character names across all 3 versions so there would be no issues with naming once the merge has happened.
---
But then fanboy whiteknights dumbfucks like yourself will defend Blizzard at any cost even if that means a lesser Vanilla experience, so here are.
---
the implementation is actually great if this is how it originally worked. if you want everything to make sense and work in a polished, logical, balanced environment go play retail.
---
Imo doing leveling if feasible(it doesn't impact your leveling speed. Examples are skinning and herbalism for example), if not then at 60. There's so much downtime at 60 waiting for dungeons and stuff that skilling up professions there won't feel like wasted time
---
Im yet to see a game breaking problem with layering and as he said people are just complainging for the sake of complainging
---
I'm getting 153ms on Stormrage and I have a super shitty DSL connection. Proof: https://imgur.com/qruD5TK
---
I'm guessing someone with fiber can reduce that.
---
This is only for raiding.  Feral is amazing for dungeons.
---
There's a lot of zones, but Feralas, Desolace, Alterac Mountains and Winterspring are up there.
---
I don't care to weed through the actual bad posts to find the good posts that were unfortunately downvoted.  So whether we should sort that way many of us won't.
---
But I'm also very aware of the echo chamber problem.  I'm not here for a balanced discussion of the merits of BFA and the downsides of classic.  I'm just here waiting for classic.
---
&gt; There's bigger things to deal with. 
---
Yeah, what do you do the other 6 days in a week? :D
---
\[Insert streamer\] said something objectionable, you clipped it, you circulate that clip, he gets attention, more people click on his stream, more ad revenue, rinse and repeat. These people make millions of dollars off of saying things that get you to talk about them. You might as well just donate to them, I'd be willing to bet you're making them more money by advertising for them for free like this.
---
Look where he is trying to swing from.
---
Not hard at all.  As a druid healer I was always sure to be the one making the group, that way I could bring a shaman or priest for dps, just in case.
---
Suck my ass kid, layering is here to stay ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
---
&gt; Unlike streemers it seems, every time I see them notice a bug I always hear "I'll report it later, it's been reported, I am just playing beta not testing". I know they are not really in beta to test but then get more people to test
---
The negative bias is showing right away. "Unlike streamers" right after praising someone plus a generalization to avoid nitpicking. "it seems" to avoid fact checking. "every time"  and "I always hear" very categorical but can get away with becomes of the "it seems" in the opener. The knowledge of them being in the beta for promotional purposes only is presumptuous.  
---
Example. People a great unlike these white guys that seems to always get away with almost every crime. 
---
It is a factual statement put the generality of it together with bias makes it toxic as the only reason for it to exist is to bash someone. It adds substantial nothing to the conversation.
---
Does anyone know if Blizzard has confirmed how long they intend to use layering?
---
I understand it will likely be necessary at the start, but long term it is going to really mess things up. It can break world PvP, and also be used to camp special nodes (Black Lotus and thorium comes to mind)
---
There‚Äôs footage of people doing this currently on classic wow. Sort of game-breaking
---
I like PvP servers because very quickly you start to get tense/nervous scared or an adrenaline rush when you see the opposite faction. I played Horde my whole life. I started play Alliance for a bit and it took 3 deaths before I started to see Orcs and Undead as enemies.
---
I'd see Orcs in Redridge and I wasn't sure if it was mob or a player cause it was so far away and I'd get off the main road for a second.
---
The ganks aren't really that bad. And I'm playing on a pserver where 60's have nothing better to do but gank because progression is meaningless in the wake of Classic.
---
STV is kind of a hell hole, but other than that I get way more fun out of it then the graveyard runs irritate me.
---
Fucking elitist here lmao
---
I did the Dark Souls workout years ago (10-push ups per death and other fun stuff) and got into the best shape of my life.
---
I dig these ideas.
---
Oh god I hope BG3 is good.  I loved Larian studios DOS1 and DOS2 so hopefully it's in the right hands.
---
WoW Classic I know will be good.  I've been playing it off and on since I quit in CATA.
---
Eastern plague lands
---
&gt; we have a much better solution
---
"we" being "you", and "much better being "my idea so obvs way better than anything Blizzard could come up with" and "solution" being "ill thought out but I'm sure 10000% better"
---
I didnt (and many others as well) had no idea the batching was this significant. I thought it would have been much much less noticeable. Kinda like when in some shooters when you end up shooting each other at the same time and both die. It happens but its not too common of an occurrence. I thought it would be similar to that but happen more frequently but more importantly wouldnt be "felt". It just feels bad to play , who the hell enjoys playing any game with lag?

I don't want to deal with dragons, I want to corpse camp lowbies. Dragons don't make forum threads about me QQing. They are hardly entertaining.
---
Gotta be honest, if the words I spoke appeared on my skin, I'd be one gigantic 6'4 tattoo of various ways to say Fuck.
---
When you guys mean "pvp realms", this pvp is everyone against everyone, or just Alliance versus Horde? I mean, can someone from my faction attack me (besides dueling of course)?
---
Stormstrike taking a debuff slot is only half the problem. Stormstrike charges would be instantly consumed by the rogues in your raid. An elemental shaman wouldn't get to use it at all.
---
THEY DIDN'T FIX THE HARDER THINGS THAT TAKE MORE TIME AND EFFORT AND TESTING YET
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
All specs can be played, but don't expect to see a boomkin, enh shaman, shadow priest or ret paladin decked in greens/blues raiding. That won't happen.  
---
All we know is that **PServers** got scripts wrong, so we know nothing about raiding till now, some strats like skipping some trash in MC might not work, who knows...some bosses can do other spells, can summon more trash, we don't know anything.  
---
We have no idea if mobs have other spells, you can see the classic streamers finding mobs that have random soft enrage and skills, an example would be some troggs that soft enrage, birds that do some fire shit and many others...  
---
As Drakova and Esfand were testing, Retribution paladins using seal of command are doing more damage than in pservers, SoCom can proc % chance items , there is still a lot of testing to be done.  
---
Class roles are there because they are the most beneficial for the raid, they are the recipe to success.
---
1. Duskwood. It's just so damn immersive. I can't wait get back into it.
---
2. Westfall. I played half of it (maybe a bit more than half) during the stress test and it's just as fun as ever.
---
3. Elywnn... Even though I'm a dwarf. I just can't get enough of Elywnn, I might just start out and take the tram over right away.
---
Great rebuttal, you sure showed me.
---
Reminds me of the ultima opener where you're at your computer and you notice a moon gate open in your backyard lol.

PepeLaugh Don't worry it's just a Beta... they said

Oh boy. Trying to drag social issues into this sub. No thanks!

looks like shorter range than non taurens get on beta  [https://www.twitch.tv/perplexitycya/clip/ArborealSpunkyBeaverSMOrc?filter=clips&amp;range=all&amp;sort=time](https://www.twitch.tv/perplexitycya/clip/ArborealSpunkyBeaverSMOrc?filter=clips&amp;range=all&amp;sort=time)
---
Layering is here to stay baby, we win and all the loser neckbeards lose.
---
I‚Äôm the winner.
---
Very good, except 3).  
---
So when you need help with a rare / player ganking you (and many other things in the open world) you cant invite anybody, cause you get ported to a random layer and even if u leave the group you wont get ported back (not getting ported back is important &amp; good though imo)  
---
thats like, "hey i wanna deal with this problem, lets invite a friend! oh the problem vanished!
---
Don't worry, they have 2 months, they have time :^)
---
$100 says you're subbed to BFA.
---
Min maxing doesn‚Äôt really matter unless you‚Äôre going for world firsts and need that extra 0.1%
---
Play pvp for the danger aspect. If you think there‚Äôs no pvp on a pve server I remember that not being the case; it‚Äôs just mostly at max level. 
---
I‚Äôll probably end up on a pve when all‚Äôs said and done because I‚Äôm a slow leveler that‚Äôs not going to be able to play for the first month. I have no interest in getting chainganked by the bored 60s trying to grind rep in early P2 when I‚Äôm in my low 50s, and when I want to experience wPVP in places like STV I‚Äôll just flag myself and get ganked  (I don‚Äôt like ganking others anyway unless they ganked me first).
---
That being said, pvp servers are very fun in their own right for having danger, organic combat, and arguably more meaningful interactions with both factions. I just wouldn‚Äôt recommend it if you aren‚Äôt going to get to 60 within the first month or two.
---
This... does put a smile on my face.
---
Only thing I‚Äôm subbed to is pornhub and Asmongold.
---
I believe this has been there since Wednesday. I updated my client then and had access. I had access until last night. It is probably part of the stress test group.
---
id say let him pick, i took a friends suggestion when i started and he assured me it got better and i hated it
---
Just against the opposing faction, Horde vs Alliance.
---
I thought I was the only one!
---
Yep, 1-60 as Balance, then when TBC came out I switched to feral and never looked back.
---
Just Alliance vs Horde. There is no FFA pvp server mode in WoW at all.
---
You can make thorium ammo, it‚Äôll get to a point where thorium will sell for vendor price on ah but the ammo a bit higher.
---
You would be surprised how many of these are dead when you run around in that area. I always kill every spider I run past and since classic has like 5 minute respawns on mobs, it isnt worth camping these spots IMHO
---
Why would it be painful?
---
Used to do this with dark souls. 
---
10 pushups for the first death and add 1 more every time you die. My friend and I had just started playing so we were terrible.
---
By the end of the day we were doing 90 pushups apiece and absolutely sick of the game.
---
It is because of Firefox's new WebRender which they started rolling out to some users with the latest Firefox about a month ago, disabling it fixes the problem for me.
---
Or go to a gym and eat right.  Christ.
---
Ok as excited as I am for Classic, you're fucking high if you think it's going to pull any dangerous numbers from retail, especially for more than maybe a month.
---
There wasn't spell batching for looting in vanilla like there is on beta. The implementation is not how it was in vanilla.
---
You have to jump in it like Dr Evil.

---
You‚Äôll both be able to level skinning fine with grinding, but honestly why bother? If you guys are leveling together anyway it‚Äôs not like more resources are magically gonna appear.
---
I don‚Äôt think anyone is claiming it won‚Äôt affect gameplay, however it will tremendously help the launch experience. Not sure why people are so unhinged about it.
---
Probably because the stress test was for Americans only.
---
Facts
---
i think the range actually looks exactly the same once perplexity shows off leeway. check the white hit 32:14 in the video.  
---
anyway, what are we debating in this thread? if leeway was real?
---
It is not about making 90% fit a ruleset, it is about that other 10% who want to RP on a server with the PVP rule set being on the same server rather than across all the options.
---
Not that simple .... You are assuming that Illidan A - B - C will have tourists and you can merge them .... what if they don't but Anub'arak A - B - C has 95% pop leaving. Now you have interesting situation.
---
Second you start on Illidan A ..... you friend want to join you a week into the game ..... Illidan A is full for character creation because of the POP restrictions .... what do you do???
---
Third .... Illidan C is extremely under populated ..... ppl are farming reagents like crazy because there is not competition .... once you merge them all Illidan A and B have their economies wrecked by an influx of materials
---
Forth  Illidan A has a cool community we all know each other and leveled together .... overnight we have a huge influx of new player we have no idea about .... ruining my experience ...
---
There is no silver bullet but layering with some rules and restrictions is less painful way of dealing with the "Tourist" issue.
---
Get baited
---
I thought you couldn't get in unless you jumped through?
---
The Louvre called, they want their masterpiece back.
---
From a PVP perspective;
---
**Undead racials**
---
* Devouring Plague - awful for BGs as it either uses almost 1k of mana or wastes your Inner Focus on an ability that can't crit. It will then inevitably be cleansed by their paladins plus dwarves can stoneform out of it and non-shadowform priests will cure themselves. Great for 1v1 wPVP in a lot of cases.
---
* Touch of Weakness - trivial damage reduction (20), awful damage (64) and a 10% chance to stun melee attackers via a blackout proc
---
* Will of the Forsaken - brilliant extra CC breaker, will help vs fears, seductions and mind controls
---
**Troll racials**
---
* Shadowguard - hits attackers for 3x118dmg plus gives three chances per cast of stunning any attacker via a blackout proc (27% chance of at least one proc landing). Nice to use vs rogues but generally a decent ability.
---
* Hex of Weakness - 20% healing debuff, but doesn't stack with mortal strike or wound poison. Not terrible if you're defending a node without a warrior
---
Playing Undead will help you vs shadowpriests and warlocks trying to fear or mindcontrol you and they're arguably the two overall strongest PVP classes. Shadowguard will help you a bit more against every class but works well at interrupting rogue's CC chains and rogues are the kings of 1v1.
---
In my eyes, Undead wins if you're planning on playing a shadowpriest while Troll wins if you're plan on being a support/healer in PVP. I'm still torn on which to play, but will probably go for Troll for aesthetic reasons.
---
You got a business license there? Let‚Äôs see some paperwork
---
Um...yes, I'm sure.
---
posted on /r/wow
---
I was part of the stress test already, at that time it was called Beta &amp; Stress Test and not only Beta thats why I'm confussed
---
Supposedly it will be completely gone by phase 2. Also happy birthday!
---
not MC attunement, summoning Rag. Take a lot longer than an hour to get that completed
---
&gt;Of course Balance LEVELING is a different story, but I actually might try that too because it seems more interesting than Feral leveling, regardless of the constant drinking.
---
The only way Balance levelling is enjoyable is if you do a ton of dungeons and switch it up by healing a good chunk of them. But even though, I find feral levelling to actually be a lot of fun.
---
Classic can't come soon enough. The memes are getting real stale.
---
Pretty sure totems in vanilla are on GCD and can't be dropped all at once, even in a macro.
---
Some of you really don't deserve Classic WoW.
---
Ain‚Äôt nobody got time for that
---
Really honestly thought you'd have taken it to the next level with Mograine Legay.
---
Shaman has 3 distinct play styles: melee dps, ranges dps and healing. In raiding it‚Äôs PRETTY much just healing but you can heal in an elemental hybrid if your group doesn‚Äôt need mana tide
---
Skankhunt42 is that you??
---
This was definitely a thing. It was even a thing in Warcraft 3
---
What's wrong with the auto shot? I only played on the stress test to level 5.
---
Sooo... it's like flagging yourself without any of the bullshit people can do with flagging on and off. I mean, I guess that's better than nothing.
---
Forget stormstrike, it's a wasted debuff slot that would be consumed by rogue poisons before you used it. Don't plan around nightfall, uptime on the nightfall debuff is very low.  
---
The only advice I can give you is to grab the spell penetration trinket from WSG. (Note, your damage will still suck, and you'll be using tons of consumables in order to *still* be the worst DPS in your raid.)
---
Were you a part of the level 5 and level 10 invite only stress test??
---
Thats inposible because they are all on the global cooldown.
---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs possible, I believe you could have it so every click cycled through the 4 you wanted to drop like a rotation, but you can not drop 4 at the same time
---
Blizzard, yeah they DID until they went out of business. Activision-Blizzard, no they won't. I seriously expect Classic to launch with most of the bugs still in.
---
Look at that range at 32:14 on the dwarf paladin!!
---
Only if horse means downvoted and alliance means upvote üòÇ
---
Yet it wasn't an issue in vanilla lol...
---
Never played shaman, but I remember them being decent levelers (albeit arguably worse than wand priest) and having a lot of flexibility in dungeons (you can tank low level instances if you‚Äôre over leveled and able to help out with healing). End game you‚Äôre pretty much just spamming chain heal in raids and popping out totems (someone more familiar will explain totem twisting, not sure if that‚Äôs something Rshams do). In pvp you‚Äôre scary as fuck especially with gear as an ele.
---
Priests level decently well and are arguably the best healer in the game (paladins and shamans both offer more utility I‚Äôd say but priests heal way more). Very mechanically complex in terms of vanilla healing, lots of different levels of spells to use. Cool racial identity with each class, making them feel special (a blessing and a curse depending on how hard you want to min-max). Spriests are monstrous in 1v1s but go oom very quickly, but if I recall healing priests are especially desirable for horde pvp as you offer a magic dispel.
---
Indeed, who cares what this guy thinks?
---
2 things that are 15 years past their prime and will be forgotten in a few years. Classic wow and best buy.
---
Of course they do.  BFA was so polished on release, right?
---
Yes, this essentially is layering without being able to move through the layers. Initially i thought this was a better approach aswell, but in reality you will see server1 getting SWAMPED because everybody wants to play where their friends started playing and thats most likely Illidan A.  
---
So a lot of people wouldnt consider Illidan B or C, because they dont want to wait 2-12 weeks till they can play with their friends AND they dont know how populated the server will be. People tend to rather play on a full server than on a lowpop server.   
---
This all comes down to a diminished version of not-layering:  
---
VERY high queue times on Illidan A, to such an extreme degree that casuals with only 2-3 hours per day cant even login without prequeuing via teamviewer.
---
If you were part of the first two stress test you had that pop up, if you uninstall it it disappears. It‚Äôs just there cause blizz wants you to uninstall it.
---
Dropping multiple totems at the same time didn't come until Wrath I think. Are you thinking of /castsequence macros?
---
It was already removed on the last stress test but I guess no one paid any attention lol
---
And this dick
---
That's actually hilarious
---
That is the same argument against spellbatching. Both leeway and spellbatching were part of Classic WoW. they were core aspects of the combat.
---
yeah, that's nothing.  perspective can be kinda tricky, but look he basically starts right ontop of the guy, he's slowed and jumps away for like 2 seconds.

---
Poor boar
---
What a wonderful feeeeeling I‚Äôm pwwwwwning agaaain :)
---
&gt;Not that simple .... You are assuming that Illidan A - B - C will have tourists and you can merge them .... what if they don't but Anub'arak A - B - C has 95% pop leaving. Now you have interesting situation.
---
I didn't understand, elaborate on this.
---
&gt;Second you start on Illidan A ..... you friend want to join you a week into the game ..... Illidan A is full for character creation because of the POP restrictions .... what do you do???
---
You're releasing 3 versions of every server. The chances that a version will be full is going to be much lower.
---
&gt;Third .... Illidan C is extremely under populated ..... ppl are farming reagents like crazy because there is not competition .... once you merge them all Illidan A and B have their economies wrecked by an influx of materials
---
The exact same can happen with layering. You can be on an empty layer meanwhile the other layers on your server are full. On top of that, it can be abused on a much larger dynamic, which is not the case with have 3 versions of ever server. You cant hop whenever you wish.
---
&gt;Forth Illidan A has a cool community we all know each other and leveled together .... overnight we have a huge influx of new player we have no idea about .... ruining my experience ...
---
You'll get to know them over time.
---
Layering is even a much worse solution when it comes to "ruining the experience" and immersion, so pls.
---
Troll female or bust
---
mate, please read my comment.
---
Yep, engineering is easy, cheap, and necessary. Making gold is easy. Flask are cheap but you don't even need it when you have engineering. You don't even need world buff. It's better to have grenades than consumables in raids. You tell that to your raid leader. With you shit attitude know it all after you don't even need friends because you have engineering.
---
I think the reason Asmongold feels this way is because in today's age, he isn't as much as a try-hard as he used to be.
---
People were surprised he didn't care about Vanilla WoW experience on his guild application. He also doesn't care what professions people are, while the hardcore of the hardcore will demand all their raiders have engineering.
---
Too complicated with too many rule sets .... more rules more ways to abuse them.
---
My suggestion is simple. Lock all character past a certain level to the same layer. Say level 20 or 25.
---
Yes I think its really nice actually. You also get bonus xp and world quest rewards from having it on which increases the number of flagged people
---
Like others have stated, ele is fantastic for PvP, because of their huge burse potential! This burst potential is just as big in PvE, but sustaining it over a long period of time is very hard. For the full burst (using shocks and chain on cd, and lightning bolt as filler) you are burning mana like a madman. In typical short fights like in MC for instance, ele can definitely do amazing dps! But in fights like Rag, you will be so oom it hurts, even with mana pot and rune used on cd!:(
---
However, it's very common for hardcore guilds to let resto shamans do damage in the very short fights, because so little healing is required when the boss dies in 20sec. So even as resto, u get to play dps some times, which is really fun imo!
---
Calm down, you act like I just committed tax fraud or some shit lol. Do you honestly think they would've given me the time if they weren't allowed to? As I said above, you accumulate trial time the longer you stay innactive. You're given the time. Long ago, once you accumulated 7 days time they'd send you an email where you had a time frame to activate the trial time. They stopped sending emails back in like MoP or WoD, but the time accumulation system still exists you just gotta be more proactive about using that time. I do appreciate the guy who gave me the time though, I kinda doubt he or she was dull to what I was doing. In fact, that's probably why  I was only given enough time to play the test for the first day. Which, FYI, I didn't waste that time, I gave feedback and reported bugs which I'm betting a lot of those people who paid their way in didn't do.
---
As for lying? Fuck yes I lied, all acting like how shady I am when the multi billion dollar corporation wants you to pay *THEM* to stress and beta test their game, let alone for 2 days like..lol. Common sense mate, people hate BFA, they've been bleeding subs like a waterfall since Cataclysm. Can't imagine their sub count is doing too well, they're desperate and doing scummy shit like banking on peoples excitement to get people to resub so their numbers look better to their investors this quarter, they're probably in full panic mode. If what I did above was in bad taste, fine, at least I wasn't dumb enough to pay 15 bucks for a months worth of a game that I have access to for 2 days all of which is gonna be wiped to boot. As if I'm not gonna have a consistently dedicated sub for the next sum years again now that the games worth paying for.

It's not only healers mana issues, many fights have enrage mechanics or gets much more difficult if you let it do another phase. 
---
But I'd rather have someone good playing a worse spec than someone bad playing the "best" spec.
---
I upvoted you because from a raid and bg standpoint you're right, but the one aspect you great underplay is the time being NE priest saves you. 
---
On a PVP server you can avoid many ganks with shadowmeld. This is far too undervalued compared to the MC + shadowmeld combo. 
---
For casual priests who suffer the occasional wipe doing dungeons or if you just got ganked, wisp form cuts off a lot of time. In many dungeons you can use shadowmeld and mind soothe to avoid the respawned mobs and rez the group on your own. I definitely remember doing this in mara when I played back in the day.
---
Fear ward is good for one of the priests in your raid to have. However, the 3rd, 4th, and 5th priest definitely don't need it. There should be enough dwarf priests playing to not really need to worry about it. Desperate prayer is good, but you have enough other heals in your toolkit. This really only helps in pvp when PW:S is on cd and you're about to die.
---
I guess I should've said "formed a group at the entrance of RFC in Ogrimmar". I'm used to playing the current version where you do queue up for dungeons.

Long nose tribe sure do make Grug think.
---
And make sure you leave VW Torment on auto-cast. Assign a hot key for ‚Äúpet attack.‚Äù While you recover mana/loot, you can send your VW in on the next mob. With Life Tap a warlock can non-stop grind pretty effectively.
---
Bias is Bias - outside of the scope of psychology (positive/negative bias which is of different manner), bias is neutral in this scenario. 
---
if we ignore that - another way of perception then would be - for many of us readers, we don't see the negative bias. What we read is something that many of us FEELS it to be true. so, technically it is those who agree - be both Fact And Feeling of truth. 
---
perhaps in the scope of psychology, you're just experiencing your own personal negative bias?
---
Outside of 1v1 vs classes who aren't paladins, priests, iceblocking mages or dwarves it's great. Against those or any class with a paladin standing behind them, it's pretty useless.
---
All of your concerns would still be issues existing in layering, as if layering worked (as intended) it would essentially have one realm split up into several virtual realms. Solutions like the one above just take the virtualization of the realm and outright acknowledges them as real realms marked for future merging and prevents you from jumping between them.
---
Holy shit that's record turn-around for a repost. We'll be flipping same day shit before long
---
Downvote really lol. Sigh. Catch u Azeroth lol
---
Played a shaman during retail Vanilla. Played a mage for my first Vanilla private realm. Played a warlock for my second. Played a rogue for my third. Etc.   
---
I might double back and try shaman again -- but only because I've thoroughly played most of the others.
---
Laying is gonna ruin the start of the game completely, just remove it 100% its not needed at all, they are literally adding it so the virgin bfa players wont scream like little girls about too many players... legit have you ever played a video game on launch day befor?
---
O.G for life. I also couldn't bring myself to play something new. Hunters are full atm too but have a feeling that might change and I'll get back to you if so
---
Warrior will come out on top thanks to the +5. But don‚Äôt let that change your loyalties. Dwarf can do the job just fine.
---
&gt; But then fanboy whiteknight dumbfucks like yourself will defend Blizzard at any cost even if that means a lesser Vanilla experience, so here are.
---
You can have a point without being a cunt, ya know. Reporting even though I completely agree with your original point.
---
They are both good for their own reasons, I would go with dwarf mainly because stoneform is incredible in both pve and pvp situations, while human weapon skill and the stamina is good as well. Humans also have perception which can be useful in PvP as well. For vanilla wow I would go with Dwarf personally.
---
What made vanilla fun for me was the newness of it. How everyone was so helpful and no one was an expert at anything. We were all boobs and we all traded ideas in chat because there were no 3rd party fan sites.
---
I made some really awesome friends and was in the best guild ever and we had a blast struggling our way through dungeons and raids, but those people are gone, the guild is disbanded, and those old feelings will never come back with the same intensity they did then.
---
I'm definitely going to play Classic when I'm bored, but I have no delusion whatsoever that it will fill the emptiness I've been feeling when it comes to WoW these days.
---
Yeah, I've seen them. It's probably OK, but with how crazy your skill bars can get. FFXI did a decent job where each face botton was your bar and you add layers hitting shoulder buttons.
---
How is this all on live servers when you literally completely change dun morogh?  Those aren‚Äôt just a model changer you added like a million trees.
---
God, WoW apparel is so awful.
---
rather have that than this  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnw7XuGTJQ&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnw7XuGTJQ&amp;feature=youtu.be)
---
That was even worse though...they weren't easy because Blizzard started to have multiple lockouts for every raid zone with normal and hard modes. It was the beginning of total raid burnout.
---
At the start of patch 3.3 I was running ICC10, ICC10H, ICC25, ICC25H. Eventually after getting the gear I was after, I cut it down to ICC10H, ICC25, ICC25H.
---
The same was true for patch 3.2 and running Trial of the Grand Crusader in 10, 10H, 25, 25H...but that wasn't quite so bad because of how fast you could clear the raid.
---
But never before in WoW was I having to clear bosses up to 4 times every week on a single character in order to have optimal progression.
---
What a terribly destructive design that continues to this day. It induces huge burnout, it cheapens the feeling of getting big kills...back in TBC and Vanilla, the big kill was the first time you've ever killed the boss and the first time you've ever been able to see the next room/wing of the raid. Utterly epic experience. Now? You've already killed that boss a dozen times on easier difficulties and seen the entire raid zone many times too. Those "big kills" only carry the sense of achievement now, not the feeling of seeing the boss die for your first time ever and being able to keep progressing through the zone.
---
It has nothing at all to do with the money Activision paid them for advertising...just believe it is hype.
---
Tanaris, Winterspring, and Badlands. Guess I like the mostly wide open spaces and sense of scale.
---
You can tell the players that are raiding at a high level because the gear almost matches.
---
Human if you want to be a min/max slave
---
DWARF IF YOU WANT TO BE A MIGHTY MAN
---
does anyone actually do these
---
Can you not read or are you just being intentionally dense?
---
Tamar is, elwynn forest, and dusk wood.
---
In the N64 Zelda games they give you roll instead of jump which suffices.
---
First in regards to layering. What if you lock all characters past a certain level say 20 or 25 to the same layer ..... no more hopping and by level 20 or so ppl will kind of spread out.
---
Now to your questions.
---
You assuming Illidan A - B - C can be merged. What if the population drop is only 5% on each server due to name nostalgia or something. Now you cant merge them.
---
Second. Human psychology suggests ppl will always choose the first or the last on the list. So Server A and C will fill up faster. What if your server is full and your friends want to play with you. 
---
The layering hopping would be addressed by my first point at the top. 
---
In my suggestion layering will only affect lower levels and because it is not sharding and more persistent it will have some sense of immersion.
---
He isn't really impacted by if there is an absurd amount of devilsaur leather/mats.
---
He doesn't care about people's Vanilla WoW experience in his guild, while most private server guilds do. He also doesn't care about what profs his guild uses, while most are going to demand engineering.
---
Clearing the game itself (If you define that by clearing Naxx) is pretty easy all things considered. You don't need to min/max to "beat WoW"
---
So, in his mind.. Who gives a shit if the gold economy is fucked, it doesn't impact him "beating" the game.
---
Their point is it has nothing to do with hype or Best Buy's interests as a hobby. It was a transaction where advertising space was purchased....and that advertising for both Activision and Best Buy are being passed around by the consumer. 
---
Talk about value for your advertising buck.
---
Well, that was underwhelming.
---
The way stealth works is there's a sight level and a stealth level. If your sight level matches or exceeds the enemy's stealth level, you can see them from a distance inversely proportionate to the difference between stealth level and sight level.
---
Vanish grants you +1000 stealth level for 10 seconds. There is no real way to see through vanish since you can't gain +1000 sight level, but you can do all the usual stuff to cancel an enemy rogue's stealth like aoe them, flare them to dispel stealth etc.
---
Showed naked feet pics pretends to be a girl laugh
---
"In that area" the entire west side and bottom of Teldrassil?
---
You also have the option of killing owls if the spiders aren't spawned. Or, if you have skinning, there are cats you can grind in the worst case.
---
If you have some other alternative that is more effective for leveling your cooking I'd love to hear it.
---
I pressed 5 buttons every pull when I leveled my priest.
---
This jumping into portals OCD must be a residual effect from playing so much Mario64 in my childhood.
---
Not if you lock every character above certain level (20 or 25) to the same single layer.......
---
I swear ill kick a spell out of someones hand and then a full second later it casts. it definitely feels like the window is way too wide for certain  things.
---
"save some pussy for the rest of us."
---
Human if DPS.
---
If strictly tank then go Dwarf for stoneform. Dwarf really only comes out on top for tanking.
---
Yessss
---
You cant deny it still has beautifull art

No you weren't. That was in wrath.
---
Why do y‚Äôall take everything so seriously?
---
The Barrens.
---
BUT IT SAYS I HAVE THE BETA SO LET ME IN THE BETA BLIZZ
---
Paladin is the best class in vanilla at Not Dying, so they were never allowed to have amazing damage as well. Buuut their burst damage as Ret is pretty good. I don't know if you're talking about leveling/pve/pvp or what. All I know is that I'll be leveling as Ret, until probably around level 40, where I will switch to Prot and tank dungeons/aoe grind mobs faster than a ret Paladin would kill them. I will then want to tank raids at 60, but realistically I'll be a cleanse and heal bot ;D
---
Seeing the true nature of life is living with eyes open and shouldn't be diminished because another person believes we should live in ignorant bliss.
---
The problem with Vanilla talents is that it's very easy to determine the optimal min:max talent builds. In an objective sense, you can determine what is better, and even by how much. To a serious player, there are no "real" talent choices. You're either spec'd optimally, or you're not.
---
&gt;Each time someone mentions a streamer: *20 squats**
---
No thanks, I'm not interested in dying.
---
Or you can do a full workout before you play.
---
The voidwalker on private servers is insanely strong compared to classic voidwalker. The numbers are just off, it's way too tanky and does way too much damage.
---
A lot of warlocks are in for a surprise when they find that the traditional advice of taking your voidwalker from 10-60 without issues is only the private server meta. You'll find particular issues as your voidwalker's torment becomes more and more outdated (levels 15-19, levels 25-29, etc.).
---
This sub really struggles with tongue-in-cheek humor... I think that's a symptom of something but I'll get banned if I mention it.
---
No, because Classic isn‚Äôt out yet :P
---
Do you have any meal prep advice for work lunches? I have a good diet, but I really let myself down for work lunches often choosing a big  share bag of crisps/chips and a meaty sandwich plus flapjack!

Resto druid does very well lasher farming, with the added benefit of stealth farming the herbs as well.

Ok, delete your reddit account and go spew that shit in a coffee shop.

I was expecting a video of an enhancement shaman auto-attacking someone 11-times in a row. Exciting!

Speedrunners do not class assisted runs as a record within the community.

I never had any formal education past PSY 101 so I can't agree or disagree with what you said as it is way out of my scope of knowledge. Sorry.

It‚Äôs a toss between a rogue, which was my vanilla main, or try something completely new.

I'm heavily considering rolling a different class to start and watching to  see if Blizz actually fixes the class.

My buddy‚Äôs brand new to WoW. We‚Äôve gamed together for years, but he‚Äôs keen to play with me on Classic‚Äôs launch.

He‚Äôs selected to play a Night Elf Rogue. What‚Äôre the best leveling combos with a Rogue?
---
Fixing spell batching takes time:)
---
Lol some of yall wouldnt be able to go out in public ever again.
---
I think Perplexity's videos are misleading, because the target being attacked is running in place.
---
If the target was running away from the enemy, I am not sure that the attacker would land as many hits using leeway.
---
If someone were to read out a sample of Mien Kampf and use the word "Streamer" in place of the original term to describe a certain group of people that the author of the book deemed the "Enemy of the State". It would be this Reddit post.
---
Played a Rogue till level 41 and then a mained a Mage till WOTLK came out. Planning to main a Hunter now, or maybe a Priest or Paladin if the Hunter remains as bugged as he is right now.
---
Easy there, lets not make this political .......
---
I am projecting a 49.888 (repeating of course) percentage of horde to the 50.222 (repeating of course) percentage of alliance.
---
Ask them to go Alliance and explain exactly what you‚Äôve explained here to them? Maybe give them a few incentives to do so.
---
since they were acquired by ACTIVISION this is something new we are talking about here. Blizzard was never out of touch with their fanbase, activision is
---
&gt; Yes, removing the part which allows people to layer hop in order to avoid pvp/farm additional nodes and breaks the illusion of a cohesive world makes it worse.
---
Layer hop cool downs is 100% better idea, without locking you into a layer, where you can't play with friends.
---
Your pretentious reality is so warped that you think my previous comment was an insult? I get it, you think you‚Äôre an intellectual and can‚Äôt grasp the basics of reddit humor.
---
There are more people that disagree with that and would call Joana a legitimate speedrunner than would agree with you.
---
Meh, his fans and haters are all insignificant groups.
---
Just add layer hopping cooldown. Boom, can't be exploited.
---
In what way is the hunter bugged? And are you talking about on the normal client or the classic beta?
---
Real talk tho, I think it will be pretty balance. PvP will swing Horde more times than not and PvE will swing Alliance more times than not. I dont suspect it will be too bad tho, we will see tho
---
&gt; if this is how it originally worked
---
Except it is not in many cases.
---
I'm sorry for having common sense
---
It wont affect you if you play horde. Onyxia, Ragnaros, C'thun and Kel'thuzad were all first killed by horde guilds. Somehow alliance managed a lot more world firsts but when it comes to the actual final bosses of the raids somehow horde was always first except for nafarian
---
Not in the speed running community, I can assure you
---
Im not a fan or a hater but i do love the slogan and the idea that wow can be great again (I know its been around as a guild name and a saying for ages anyway) ill put a picture up when it comes lol!
---
I don't know if it's the best per say, but Druid Rogue is fun. Both having stealth. Having heals is a game changer And you can both start in the same zone.
---
Sleep also plays a massive factor in weight gain and weight loss because your body produces HGH and HGH regulators during sleep. Too little sleep and your hormone balance goes out of whack, leading to significant weight gain.
---
Diet and exercise are important, but so is sleep. It's no coincidence that the biggest WoW addicts who regularly sacrifice sleep are also usually the fattest.
---
This is a good example of why they don't need more people in the beta test.
---
Wow you just missed the point hard man. It's a little embarrassing.
---
Another rogue or a druid. Without stealth any advantage the rogue has is gone.
---
i'm torn on this. first day i thought non-language specific realms would destroy the classic experience for me. the next day i thought it'f philosophically the right decision to not have language specific realms.
---
i think i've seen some good arguments that not having language specific realms will cause some real issues that may really hurt not just the classic experience but the gaming experience overall.
---
i think it would be best to have servers for the major languages spoken in europe. and for those who don't want to or can't speak those, there should be international european servers where any language can be spoken.
---
not having servers for the major languages like we used to have and most still expect, because that's actually also how retail is structured, could be a real deal breaker.
---

Orc resto shaman through t1/2 and meme elemental through 2.5. Back to resto for naxx.

Well the world's a lot more racist than it was last time, so I think we should expect more Alliance than Horde.
---
These graphics take me back to the good ol days
---
look at it again in slowmo if you wish mate, thats windfury animation being funky and not a white, you see a fireblast hit the mage as he turns camera, it displays he crits for 440 damage but thats not a white for 440 damage hits the mage for like 10% hp.
---
Leeway might be wrong, but this looks like windfury animation being stupid instead to me
---
Ah what a fool I am
---
Ah, the good old CRT monitor.
---
&gt; People are fucking blind if they don‚Äôt think layering is going to affect gameplay.
---
It might affect my gameplay, but it won't be a negative. It will be positive.
---
I'll be able to log in. I'll be in crowded zones, since layering is world wide, all players will be in the same starting zones.
---
I can't see anything negative that will affect me.
---
Any class will be completely fine.
---
right.

I wanna see what all the hype in STV is about

What about warlock?
---
I'm a Canadian baguette.
---
Is there a similar list for other classes?
---
Lol what no. Each layer has 3k people, and each server has like 5 layers. That means you could change between 5 layers for nodes. Do you honestly think there would be 300k+ people per server???
---
True bro:D
---
If it's gray you're gay.
---
how can anyone downvote this thread... it's the ultimate proof that layering does have bad impact on the game

Haha!
---
Haha true. Usually never on pc and monitor is 10 years old.

Yeah, just  looks wrong.

I'm still planning on rolling hunter, but if the bugs persist into later phases I'll need to find something else I like to raid with in vanilla.

I believe the regular owls in Teldrassil drop eggs, too. I'm playing on a private server so you'd have to test this otherwise.

It has potential flaws, it also means more monitoring from Blizzard's part, but i'd say it stands with what Classic should be about, which is one cohesive world we all play on.
---
I logged in at the IF AH to find myself completely alone, I then ran to the mailbox and into the bank and still didn't see anyone. Layering makes me feel like I'm alone on the game and when it comes to the beta maybe I am

---
People are complaining they can't play **the fucking beta**. What the fuck do you think it's going to be like when they can't play **the actual game**?
---
LMAO
---
It's because in vanilla a pet's level wasn't linked to your character's level. Blizzard has only locked character-level, allowing pets to keep gaining xp after you hit the level cap.
---
I'll chime in with a defense for PVE servers. For context, I'll have a lot of time for a few days on launch before being reduced to a more limited playtime. My favourite PVP is dueling and battlegrounds. 
---
Personally, I've found that the expectation vs. reality of PVP servers is pretty different. 
---
People expect even skirmishes with more and more players joining the fray. That's, at best, 10% of world PVP interactions. The other 90% is being ganked at lower health and low mana while you're fighting a mob, or being oneshot and camped by a bored high level player, or being killed while AFK.
---
Additionally, if I wanted the thrill of being constantly at risk of ganking, I can just flag myself on the PVE realm. If things get too annoying (hugely outnumbered, massively outleveled), I can wait 5 minutes and go back to what I was doing. 
---
For me, since I don't enjoy ganking people who don't want to be PVPing, it's all benefit and no downside. I prefer fairer fights, where both players are ready and willing.
---
There are other bonuses that are potentially controversial here. In my experience PVE servers are a lot more relaxed, less elitist, and generally more mature. You tend to avoid the edgy characters who take pleasure in ruining the gameplay of others (eg. corpse-camping low levels, ganking at the end of escort quests). Let me be clear that this is on average, and that there are obviously mature and fair-playing individuals on PVP realms. The PVE realm just gives the toxic players less ammunition. 
---
Finally, my guess is that Horde will tend to outnumber Alliance on PVP realms (vastly better PVP racials, generally the more warlike faction with much more faction pride).
---
You said you hate being ganked but you enjoyed war mode. PVE realm is basically made for you. Flag yourself until it gets annoying or you feel like playing casually while watching something on your other screen.
---
2 misses in a row pretty much GG
---
Those are all pretty reasonable
---
I don't agree with that, being able to sneak to the back of the mob and sap potential ads is still very useful.
---
I wanna be a Gnome fury warrior, because I wanna be tiny and slay dragons. How gimped will be dps be if I'm not human and don't have access to edgemaster's

Check out  [https://wowclassicpopulation.com/](https://wowclassicpopulation.com/)  to get an idea of server/character populations.  It definitely needs more data but it's a good starting point.
---
Not true, rogue + 1 will benefit greatly from backstabbing. So I would say anything that will be tankier than the rogue is great. Warrior, paladin (best), druid, hunter, warlock, shaman.
---
English isnt that difficult to learn.

---
Human will come out on top for threat generation but not by much. In all other cases Dwarf is better.
---
As to yellow attacks, weapon skill helps with Dodge, Parry and Miss as well since it is driven by the difference between target defense skill and attacker weapon skill. And since Parry gives a 40% haste on the next attack technically humans would take less damage in the same gear.
---
I will play. I want to play clasaic hunter. Even if it is broken
---
Wait, you guys are getting mounts?
---
Also having video on what happened before, during and after is super helpful. Easier then trying to describe everything in detail, and what a engineer is looking for.

So I was able to download classic WoW and under "live" on the bnet drop down menu i can choose World of Warcraft and World Of Warcraft Classic. I do NOT have beta access right? When I downloaded World Of Warcraft Classic and ran it, it said there were no servers available. I do NOT have an active sub. thanks!
---
I never knew there were flair options for this sub, but I'd love to see them! Is there any reason why they don't work here, but if I click over to r/soccer I can view all user flair without needing to switch to old reddit? Problem is consistent with Chrome and Firefox.

Good luck to you to, hope to gank you a few times :)
---
Do you have access to a refrigerator at work? I meal prep lunch and dinner 3 days at a time. Right now it‚Äôs just seasoned pressured cooked chicken and oven roasted veggies, you could do something like that, maybe add rice or sweet potato in the lunch dish if you want some more carbs.

Your screenshot shows nothing useful regarding leeway either in vanilla or in the beta. The fact you think it does, means you have no idea of even what the problem is.
---
You must be new to the internet and the age of social media. We all live in little echo chambers and we Jack each other off ideologically.

I plan on playing a night elf rogue in classic, I‚Äôve read a few things where people were against daggers; should I not run daggers? Also, as far as professions, which would be best for rogue? Thanks in advance!
---
It's not going to be a massive difference unless you're really trying to Min/Max your PvE DPS. The passives and little buffs like that give minor bumps, but nothing significant that will put you crazy over the edge.
---
If you have an itch to PvP, Gnome is actually pretty good for their racial.
---
What are these bugs?
---
Haters will say its photoshop...
---
Barrens (home)
---
Desolace (soft spot)
---
Hinterlands (Jintha alor)
---
Feralas (explorer's eyecandy) 
---
Eastern Plaguelands (following the scarlet courier wrecking crew with popcorn)
---
In wc3 blinks also 'disjoint' though, afaik this wasn't the case in vanilla.
---
Grinding for Dragonscales in Azshara without that ridiculous Goblin monorail.  That over the top pop culture tropey goblin shit is the biggest buzzkill of retail.
---
master hunters rifle, or master hunters bow
---
It's still kind of crazy that there advertising classic. That's not something most people expected.
---
Yes, yes, yes. You expected this. Of course you did. You're like super smart and realistic and in tune with the markets and stuff. Good for you.
---
Rogue + 1 will benefit greatly from backstabbing, so I would say anything that will be tankier than the rogue is great. Warrior, paladin (best), druid, hunter, warlock.
---
Druid is great as you can start in the same zone, you have heals, you have both stealth, but! You will compete for gear, so I would not recommend.
---
Paladin is imho the best as the only think paladin lacks is damage, you won't compete for gear and you have heals, sustain, tank, everything.
---
Warrior is good too but no heals so no sustain, you will have to pause a lot and you won't solo that much as with a paladin.
---
Priest is good, hunter is good (pet is tanking), mage is not so good, another rogue is ok, warlock is good.
---
Duskwood. And at some point to do Tirisfal Glades again, haven't done that since actual vanilla I think.
---
Daggers are viable but it is more of a pain to level because backstabbing is not possible
---
No Druids, as it should be.
---
Wait he had an argument? 
---
Oh look it's you from the other reply who also didn't have an argument to begin with, lmfao.
---
Read what I wrote again, I guess.
---
Oh absolutely. Got a modmail as well saying that if I did it again I'd be banned, completely fair and understandable as it could result in the universe exploding.
---
Because lots of people don't want to sacrifice gameplay for convenience.
---
I definitely think horde will have the higher pop this time on average while alliance will be better geared as a whole.
---
O M G I got a mount! O M G I got a mount! O M G O M G O M G I got a mount! that music is top tier 10/10
---
Does anyone remember if there are bg battlemasters in major cities this early into the game?
---
Ass to mouth machine?
---
A few %.  Skill will cover the gap.  Plus it won't really be noticeable til you get AQ40/Naxx gear anyways.
---
I would typically, join in the conversation, with you but you seem very militant and angry. The bottom line is your idea is bad... I am sorry to tell you that, it just is. You also don‚Äôt seem to understand the business side of game design decisions. I don‚Äôt like the idea of layering, but it is probably the cheapest/best solution blizz could come up with to achieve a smooth roll out. It will be fine in the end, so I wouldn‚Äôt waste you‚Äôre time getting worked up about this and fighting strangers on the internet.
---
Simple enough. Thanks mate
---
Especially considering there‚Äôs no way layering is cost cutting.
---
unpopular opinion: suggest invite was kind of nice and i wish it stayed
---
I'm getting so tired of it lol. The worst part is that it's even present out in the real world. I know it's human nature and maybe it's just me, but it feels like it's around even more so nowadays.
---
People see things on the internet and think it's ok to do the same thing in real life or they see these things happen on the internet and they just assume that it must happen all the time in real life.
---
We can't just think for ourselves and we seek out validation for our own beliefs from people we don't know nor care about
---
PvP for sure. I'm only wanting RP-PvP realms to keep pepegas and monkas out of the damn chat, and as a general deterrent for the TYPE of player that would think it's a great and oh so funny idea to name their undead rogue faceystab.   
---
But the non-consensual PvP while in contested zones is the most important part. I'll grit my teeth and bear the burden of having to look at xxlegolasxx if it means I can teabag him.
---
Most of this video issues are bugs rather than the intended layering feature though (you shouldn't change layer while fighting and so on) and some were recorded in the very first weeks of the beta...
---
Would be nice to have recent footage from the beta outside of the stress test
---
No I can read just fine. I linked the tweet in  your post. This doesn't say anything about loot.
---
Zug zug
---
if this is the thing you need to finally get into shape, I got some bad news for you.... u fukt
---
ok
---
What is the correlation here and why do you think the world is more racist now? It's much more likely the world has always been this racist, people are just more out in the open about it now.
---
TBH my best QoL change was a gym membership to a nice-quality, low-traffic gym, and going from 6:45-7:45 before work and again during my lunch break. Super easy to read through forums during rests, and it means I'm getting 10-12 hours in the gym every week
---
Ban someone for posting a YouTube video? Ok, glad you're not a mod here then.
---
It's actually the 7.3.5 legion engine, they don't have the multi threading support or dx12 improvements BFA one has. I'm sure they will figure a way to add them in the future though.
---
I know! It's going to be awesome leveling on a pve server after 3 years on private pvp servers.
---
So people will be more openly choose Alliance then, so they can wave their racist flags.
---
I'll be playing. I'm not going to not play because of "OMG LAYERING!!!1"
---
Normally and not rushing it, probably 3-4 months.  Lvl 50-&gt;60 will be a real slog.
---
*Cheers in farmer*
---
But they do... you can see it in all of the videos. IIRC the buff says something like "Taking *n* damage over 8 seconds." for Blizzard.
---
:( Trolls are stoner bros tho
---
Does it work just like it sounds? Group lead gets a pop-up or something? That does sound convenient if so.
---
Yeah, you have to be subbed.
---
I made a spreadsheet to factor in spell power coefficients for various healing ranks with an optional field to add +healing power to see how the spell efficiency changes.  By my calculations, Rank 6 doesn't overtake Rank 7 for efficiency until you have a whopping 405 or more +healing on gear.  The coefficients are fairly easy to calculate.  You can make your own spreadsheet if you want.  
---
I used the following calculations courtesy of research:  
---
SP coeff = SpellCastTime / 3.5  
---
Downranking Coefficient =  = Min(1,(SpellLevel+11)/PlayerLevel)   
---
(We can ignore the level 20 penalty because you'd have to be stupid to use a spell below level 20).  For those curious, the level 20 penalty formula is  =1-((20-SpellLevel)\*0.0375)   
---
The following numbers don't account for talents because that's pointless for these two spells -- flat healing increases or cost reductions   
---
This gives ranks 6 and 7 of Flash Heal both a SP Coefficient of 0.42857.  Rank 6 is 315 mana, Rank 7 is 380.    If you take the average base healing amount, at Rank 6 it's 704, at Rank 7 it's 885.   This gives Rank 6 a healing per mana of 2.23 and Rank 7 a healing per mana of 2.33.  The break even point is at 405 +healing, when both ranks attain a ratio of 2.79 healing per mana.  
---
Healing Touch is a similar case.  You need 351 +healing for Rank 10 to become more mana efficient than Rank 9.  Once people get Rank 11 from AQ, it's so far beyond Rank 10 in terms of healing-to-mana ratio that you need 720 +healing, by which point Rank 7 becomes the most mana efficient.
---
Gives away Heroes 3 vibes!
---
&gt;Now to your questions. You assuming Illidan A - B - C can be merged. What if the population drop is only 5% on each server due to name nostalgia or something. Now you cant merge them.
---
And the exact same issue can be applied to layering as well?
---
If tourists don't go away then layering will persist - you're not solving anything.
---
Second. Human psychology suggests ppl will always choose the first or the last on the list. So Server A and C will fill up faster. What if your server is full and your friends want to play with you.
---
So you would rather be okay with the exploitation of layering across multiple aspects of the game, abusing world pvp, destroying the economy, and what not...but you're not okay with your friend sitting in a queue? Okay then.
---
&gt;The layering hopping would be addressed by my first point at the top. In my suggestion layering will only affect lower levels and because it is not sharding and more persistent it will have some sense of immersion.
---
That's what they claimed. Unfortunately that's not what we have seen so far from the videos, betas and stress tests.
---
No. Basically nobody will care. The racial difference is so minuscule so I absolutely wouldn't worry. 
---
There are 10000 other more important things based on which to choose a tank for your raids than race.
---
I never noticed it before but The Barrens has a kind of facial profile where Ratchet sits between the upper lip and the nose üßê
---
I want to play too, but not if it sacrifices the game's integrity. I'd like to play Vanilla, not Diet Caffeine-Free Vanilla.
---
Wish they taught us that in school gym class.
---
Please let me know when you ported it. I‚Äòll tried to edit it for the stress test but got way to many errors.
---
&gt; I think you are overstating the number of people that would both have the resources and the will to spend $50 on the regular to move servers.
---
People spend way more than that on F2P games. 
---
As an adult with a job, 50 bucks every few months would be a small portion of my entertainment budget.
---
\*Insert finger tapping temple meme here\*
---
unless your michael phelps who eats 12000 cals a day because he swims often.
---
He just white hit killed a mage from narnia? let me guess it was latency. the endless examples from warrior pvp videos are all due to latency.
---
Pretty sure onyxia world first was alliance.
---
Strange, I'm not sure how I missed that reddit post.
---
 Thanks for linking, I was genuinely curious btw, wasn't trying to be bashful.
---
"  did Blizzard address any of these bugs, are there any fixes on schedule etc? "
---
Afaik they did fix one of the hunt bug where you couldn't use your ranged weapon anymore. Not in the beta so dunno much more though.
---
Same. Played 2005-2011 and 1-60 hunter on 1x pserver. Been campaigning for classic since nost.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt mind playing a rogue or whatever but I‚Äôm not resubbing if they ship the game even close to its current state. Sharding and hunters gotta be fixed or it‚Äôs just not worth it. Seems like a Vanilla skin put over retail with some values adjusted
---
&gt; who can't afford a realm transfer 
---
If you can afford a WoW sub, you should be able to afford a transfer.
---
Pretty cool actually. Still waiting for a commercial acknowledging classic's existence.
---
This guy rick'n'morties
---
Nope, watch the clips in the spreadsheet linked above. You can tame any tame-able beast in beta as long as the color of the level is yellow, green, or grey. Mobs that are 2 levels above you are still yellow.
---
a screenshot aint gonna do it lmao
---
This will be you by the time you reach 60 https://youtu.be/A1PAO3jgmXY
---
Yes, it's 3 per active account.
---
Alliance Rogue, but mainly excited for STV. I know its a gankfest but that's what i look forward to. I'm not a big fan of classics instanced PvP, and there aren't arenas (I don't think so at least), so I plan on enjoying the leveling experience to its fullest and get a ton of PvP in during later leveling.
---
yeah dont go demo. just go regular affliction leveling build or if you really want look up "vanilla warlock drain tanking build" , its an affilic leveling build that lets you basically keep your imp up instead of VW, facetank a lot of mobs, and gives you a lil more defense in terms of PvP.
---
however, in my opinion, unless you get like 3v1'd or ganked by someone way higher than you, you should laugh any time someone tries to fuck with you. vanilla warlocks were great at 1v1 or even 2v1 with fear, self-healing stuff out the wazoo, soulstone, etc etc.
---
what i'm trying to get at is, don't slow down your leveling a fuckton and go demo because you're afraid of getting ganked. people would be dumb to gank a warlock leveling unless they gang up on him or outlevel him a bunch.
---
Clams.
---
Well, there's a lot of conflicting information going around. I think at the very least Blizzard should make a post detailing exactly what Leeway is, whether it was in Vanilla, and if they're still working on it and fine tuning it for Classic.
---
Yes, you need a sub.
---
What if your friends or guildies are on another layer?

---
Agreed, and often a very overlooked part of the whole process
---
Oh im well aware of people doing this on the beta, first and foremost theres not enough people to occupy all the available layers on the beta, as its intended for testing. You wont be able to take gurubashi chests on classic because they will already be taken before you even get the chance to layer in.  
---
and for PVP how are you supposed to layer on command while being ganked UNLESS youre a streamer with people watching you or you have it coordinated in advance thus abusing it urself, organically nothing will be noticed.
---
Welcome to the WoW community where there are a lot of over the top crazy people who take everything way too seriously and personally. Never go too the blizzard forums that's where most reside, unless you want to laugh at them.
---
Im always DPS, im not the tanking type so im going to do something completely different from my play style and roll a Night Elf Priest. 
---
Healer is going to be really fun and something i have never thought to  main before.
---
Gnomes can be priests...
---
Quite frankly it's crazy you get to play classic. Retail is specifically for *people like you*.
---
Wait okay, I'm sorry. This is being too mean. I love you, please come again.
---
You guys don't moonwalk into them?
---
Every private pvp server has been almost 50/50. As others said pve servers tend to be more weighted towards alliance.
---
It's pot luck what happens on any given server. While most will be fairly even various factors can skew it either way. A popular streamer/guild or national/language community could tip your server far enough it isnt enjoyable.
---
Not until phase 3
---
Gnome.
---
Now this is /gatenkeeping done right
---
Agree with the first point. No way around it. As to the rest. The level lock I explained would address the issues. I do not believe Blizz has that mechanic implemented.
---
You‚Äôre welcome
---
Lol if it‚Äôs anything like this thread chain, I‚Äôm all set.
---
You know it never occurred to me that I haven't walked into an instance in years. I stopped playing in mop and by that point you either got teleported in or you zipped in with an epic flying mount.
---
The weird one I noticed was the noise of the arrow hitting the mob. That was DEFINITELY not in vanilla, I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs a legion thing. Really granular I know but it‚Äôs something I noticed.
---
Also lose 50 DKP for not being where the fuck you were supposed to be
---
what about this

Incredible story. 11/10
---
The European reaction to this subject is the most hypocritical thing I‚Äôve seen from them in a while. It‚Äôs a funny day when us Americans can say we are more cultured than they are.
---
Yeah no wonder 80% raid Dps is affliction warlockck if all that counts is the raw damage nowadays.
---
Hate to roast myself like this but I was doing ret pally when I was 10 in 2005 and having a blast. 
---
Apparently it resonated with me because I still have a blast lol
---
You invite them to a group and you are on the same layer ...... just like it works right now .....
---
Again.. no one is denying that leeway existed in vanilla wow.
---
Yup! Never leveled a priest past 40 in any expansion but always been interested in doing so. Maining a priest.
---
This is great, nice work!
---
latency shouldnt matter cause both have roughly the same amount.
---
There were quite a few guilds like that back in vanilla. There was one on our server, their name escapes me right now but as one would expect it was a joke about their height.
---
They were quite casual but still farmed MC and BWL without problems when top guilds were doing AQ40 and afaik they didn't pursue any further raiding.
---
You should read everything... "saving people from mistakes" or did you not read that part too? No shit every role is crucial, you can't run into a dungeon with all healers. You're showing true ignorance and irony.
---
So there is an option to create characters if you're subbed on 12th of Aug?
---
who snapchat this?
---
The one you like the look of. Both make fine priests.
---
Right click reporting is so easy to do that people do it for any small minor infraction that doesn't matter. People fear being mass right-click reported by an entire group of people that they've offended.
---
In my opinion, if what happen isn't worth writing a paragraph detailing what happened then it probably wasn't something worth reporting.
---
Is that a hunter?
---
Arguably worse just watch this and skip to 22:24 https://youtu.be/pSMa9vw8zTc

Dog, this was posted not three days ago. This is a good community. Please don't ruin it.

---
Everything you hear about "not feasible specs" is basically only applicable in high-tier raid content.
---
Absolutely everything is viable while leveling.
---
Guess I was misremembering it as a talent. My memory of this must have been from early TBC after all. My mistake!
---
There is a subset of people who think making it to easy to report people is bad. They complain that if its easy to report then they will be reported for ninja looting and in general being a dick. They want to be toxic and see it as part of the game. However if its easy to report then they will get banned for the things they want to do.
---
Tldr: they are toxic players that are afraid of being banned.
---
&gt;The bottom line is your idea is bad... I am sorry to tell you that, it just is.
---
You've totally convinced me, thanks.
---
&gt;but it is probably the cheapest
---
And this says it all.
---
Funny, incendrius was one of the things I would farm as a rogue. I think he dropped the ace of elementals. Been a while though, my rogue was the first thing I ever played and even with almost full bloodfang I‚Äôm not sure I knew what I was doing lol
---
This is actually a pretty helpful image thanks saved
---
He isnt a hardcore gamer, "clearing the game itself" is not a major goal for him. He organizes events and collects things, he always was a HUGE advocate for one consistent, coherent world, thats why im surprised. 
---
but honestly, i really dont care. Layering will be in the game, hopefully with as many limitations/anti-abuse-mechanics as possible :)
---
I started casting starfire in vanilla...still waiting
---
Also the birth of no interaction wq add-ons :)
---
Invite
---
Kill
---
Leave without goodbye
---
Now
---
Be polite
---
Get invite
---
Say goodbye or you might not get a invite in the future.
---
It's not much, but it's honest work for interaction.
---
On paper that sounds great, but that's totally not how downranking works under the hood.    
---
Basically, first up, the only heal off the top of my head that gains the full 100% of spell power (IE a coefficient of 1) is healing touch.  Most spells actually gain only a fraction of your +healing.    
---
secondly, any spell whose rank is learned at a level greater than 11 levels below your level suffers a penalty to this coefficient.  So basically if we take Flash Heal as an example, Ranks 6 and 7 (available at levels 50 and 56 respectively) both gain their full  0.42857 coefficients.  In short, if you have +300 healing stat, you only gain 128 healing on top of the base healing for that spell at Ranks 6 and 7.  (300\*0.42857).    
---
Because Ranks 1-5 are taught at levels that are more than 11 levels below a level 60 player, a 'downranking penalty' applies.  This means Rank 5 has a coefficient of 0.39286, Rank 5 is even lower at 0.35, etc.  In other words your 'bang for buck' of your +healing stat becomes lower, the lower the rank you go from your current level.  A further, extremely steep penalty exists on spells whose rank is learned at a level below 20.  For example Rank 1 of Healing Touch has a coefficient of 0.024.  I'm not even joking.   That means only 7 of your +300 healing power stat would apply to HT rank 1.
---
there's that little castle in redridge which requires a group to get to the top of and kill the bad guy. there's also the big castle in arathi highlands which has the same thing.
---
I do it only because you couldnt jump in SWG, my first mmo lol
---
Devilsaur leggings - pre-bis
---
Shoulders from maradoun I think
---
Everything north of stormwind is a good time for me
---
No :)
---
If they give any indication they'll play long enough to make it to at least phase 2, always choose your friends.
---
Yes, you can make up to 3 charaters 2 weeks prior to launch, so if you want to save/get a special name this is your chance.
---
I was looking through some of my old harddrives, and found a few old screenshots. This one is from ‚ÄéMonday, ‚ÄéMay ‚Äé29, ‚Äé2006. I believe my rogue (Manamar - Nordrassil EU) was around level 54 when this picture was taken.
---
I recognize Phytoskin Spaulders, The Devilsaur pieces, and Barman Shanker.
---
I also don't see the problem but hell #nochanges.
---
I understand there are going to be some changes but the fewer the better. Suggested invites is just one of those that i can't see a real negative effect to.
---
i'm not sure i ever set foot in that zone.
---
Thinking warlock. Warrior rogue in vanilla. As others have said, I was on the hunter train but cant be bothered if they are broken. Lock was a close second anyway.
---
What I feel is the biggest problem is it kills the immersive part 100%. Huge fight in Hillsbrad is being broadcasted in server comunity channels. I go there and it's empty. Someone want to meet up at a location. Can't see one another.
---
This shit is one of the reasons retail wow is dying. If this is what's it coming down to, I rather have 2 hour queues.
---
&lt;Region&gt; Oceanic **New Zealand** and Australia (and around about there)

Loot will be a mixture of loot council with monitoring system
---
Looking to Level Semi Fast 4-8 weeks on average but casuals are more than welcome

The server we are on will be announced in the discord
---
We aim for a super fun raid environment with lots of banter and shit talking while also getting all content done in a fast time. When you get to the boss everyone shuts up and kills it!.
---
We expect all members to play fair and well with all players on the server and not be a troll or ninja you will be kicked, guild reputation meant something in Classic and must be maintained.
---
Come join and talk shit with us until classic is out!!
---
But does the collection with a group actually go faster when 5 people can tag? Early in the stress test I was collecting faster after my buddy got online and there were 2 of us to compete for tags. We could cover more ground. Maybe a group of 2-3 is best for collection quests when tags are the biggest issue. 5 people just feels like too much, too spread out.
---
You just have to set the correct filters to get more meaningful data.

how the heck does training pet skills work as a hunter? do i need to keep abandoning and retraining pets as i get higher levels?
---
It‚Äôs about more than just the eu. This is about participating in the global culture. By practicing your second language you could communicate with not only Britain, but the USA, Canada, NZ, Australia. On top of that English is a 2nd or 3rd language that people in almost every country around the world have been exposed to through conquest or pop culture. This refusal is ridiculous and hypocritical considering they claim to be all about cultural appreciation. I guess they just want people to appreciate their specific culture and fuck the rest. NA servers have already shown coexisting is possible.
---
bruh just face the truth instead of trying to desperately find excuses for this broken system... I don't care if I'm not able to get grubuashi chest, someone else will, and it will be abuse of the system, there will be more chests and nodes and devilsaurs in the game than there should have been... It's not about me but integrity of the server... for pvp you can simply spam guild channel for inv and u have a big chance someone will phase you...
---
bruh üçëüëÖüíØüëèüòùü§§
---
Knocking people off their flightpaths in the middle of nowhere and sometimes dying in places they cant reach isnt game breaking?
---
The ability to reset your layer and farm multiple veins in the same spot in different layers isnt game breaking?
---
The ability to literally remove yourself from any form of pvp by simply being invited to a group and being put in another layer isnt game breaking?
---
The ability to basically make an endless stream of valuable mobs(aka devilsaurs) by flipping through layers isnt game breaking?
---
They say people went AFK waiting for the swingtimer to reset.
---
Ok see I thought world buffs were just the ones that would apply to everyone in major cities when activated. I see now it includes buffs you obtain from the world; world buffs lol. Yes I agree that one is clearly broken. Totally agreed man apologies for arguing with you.
---
If you take a bit of time to make sure you are high enough level before going to the next zone you should be fine. If you are both high burst damage classes you can assist each other and be high enough level with maybe an hour extra effort.
---
Precisely why many of us don't care about beta invites.  Too much beta testing = burnout for the live game.  But for all of you beta testers with high tolerances for repetition, enjoy!
---
Greedy shits
---
Ok, 3k in starting zones vs 9k.
---
How can layering be completely unrelated to starting zones overpopulation on launch? It literally splits the server population into smaller chunks.
---
It may humor but its translates to people actually doing that shit and being toxic as hell
---
Swedes are very conflict-averse in real life, so I'd figure it needs an outlet elsewhere.
---
I love it when people are proud ganking low levels, it says a lot about their pvp skills
---
it's an outdated system though, it's as much as an artifact to compensate lag as leeway is
---
it makes no sense in modern gaming to reward slower reactions, I get it that there's a meta around it, but it's an unreliable RNG based meta because you're never on point with the batches every time
---
it's much healthier to not use that batching system in my personal opinion of course, am I wrong? maybe, I just think it's not good design to reward slower reactions in the current day and age
---
I'm playing alliance for the first time ever. I'm looking forward to experiencing all that new content, but with the comfort and familiarity of the original mechanics
---
This and being with friends helps because you can take on slightly hard enemies that most people won't be able to solo. Thus less people to compete with on pulls.
---
Game design decision, create lore to fit it.

They wanted to give horde needed a "pretty" race.

Would've been godly before weapon speed normalization

The data for [both beta realm only level 40 characters](https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?maxLevel=40&amp;minLevel=40&amp;realm=Classic%20Beta%20PvP&amp;realm=Classic%20Beta%20PvE) or [all stress test realms only level 15 characters](https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?maxLevel=15&amp;minLevel=15&amp;realm=Classic%20Realm%202&amp;realm=Classic%20Realm%203&amp;realm=Classic%20Realm%2015) has some significance.
---
But yeah, I agree, more samples is always better :D
---
I played as a healer on a PVE server from day 1 and have also played a bit of warmode on BfA and agree with everything you just said and so intend to play on a PVE server in classic.
---
I did consider playing a PVP server for classic but I remember enjoying some really fun opt-in world PVP in vanilla and never felt like I was missing out.
---
People talk about the added danger and that's fine but I'm not the type of player that enjoys ganking or griefing others that are just minding their own business so it simply doesn't make sense for a nice guy like me to play on a PVP realm.
---
*Thank You! That was exactly the kind of thing I was looking for, but every search result I got for the Wiki gave me post CATA numbers.
---
*For curiosity's sake, do you happen to know if Random Bonuses on Offhand items always had limitations on which affixes (also thank you for reminding me of that term) they got or if it was a later change? I seem to remember the occasional Tradechat spam of strange item affix combination
---
*Maybe "sucks" was a little harsh, fair point. I was hoping for a lvl 60 green offhand with 1 stat affix like Agility or Stamina existed and might be situationaly better.
---
Is there an armory or anything that I can use to at least search if any retailers will be after my names?

anyone in a group can invite someone, and it just tells the group lead that [x] member suggested it, yeah its nice

So I‚Äôm considering flying out to an old friend for launch so we can play together, but I can‚Äôt stay for too many days due to other stuff. How long time does it take too reach for example level 20 or 30 as a duo? Not decided on classes yet
---
The fishing started way back when Beta was announced, then invite only stress test, then all active accounts stress test. Look at the timing in-between, it's ingenious.
---
What are the social benefits? Also EU or US? PvP or PvE?
---
Yeah I love Deathknell and Brill just as much as Silverpine. I'm hoping to be playing undead priest but its dependant on rl friends, I will have to settle for Duskwood in that case for my undead fix.

I like how universally people agree that druid players are chill

That's been me for the most of  BfA. Really want to play wow, but not BfA...

Oh no we may be mildly inconvenienced by not being able to play a video game the moment we want to! We may have to log off and like.. log on later D:

‚ÄúI want my instant gratification mini dopamine spikes and I want them NOW!

Let‚Äôs ruin the entire economy of the game for its lifetime so that &gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt; don‚Äôt have to wait 15 min to log in :) I will have quit by the time this is affecting people but who cares, as long as I‚Äôm not mildly inconvenienced on day 1, fuck everyone else!
---
those addons existed before the suggest invite, theyre completely unrelated
---
i mean you would do nothing but squat the entire time
---
First time ever trying WoW, what servers should i be looking at as an OCE player? At what ping would you say the game is good to be played in? 100ms below?
---
Would like a server thats majority english speaking but also not too high ping. From my experience (Overwatch) the Asia server has the best ping but is mostly Koreans. If its US servers ping is roughly \~150-200 but at least they speak English. Is there a US/EU server that has been community dubbed as where most OCE players play?
---
Just hopping in here to say you need to not worry about DPS, especially in PvP. You need to look at the top-end damage of a weapon and the weapon's speed. You want the hardest hitting, slowest weapon you can find in your bracket. Since most of your pvp gameplay as a hunter is kiting, you're only going to get actual weapon-scaled damage on target every now and then. You want to make sure your shot hits real good.  
---
In PvE you need a weapon with at least a 3.00 attack speed to keep from clipping autos when you're casting aimed shot.
---
The thing is, these are very minimal problems except for the first bug. Herb / mine / devilsaurs will be farmed by multiple people on each layer after the very first wave of 60s. Hopping layers to farm multiple herb / mine nodes will not be efficient when every layer is being camped for resources 24/7. So the very first level 60 hunter will get a bit more devilsaur leather. He farms his first set extremely quickly before the rest of the server catches up and he can no longer farm every devilsaur on every layer, as they are all being camped. How game breaking. Get a grip
---
I don't necessarily disagree with you, but I feel I must nitpick this a little.
---
Layering by definition is continent-wide - you can't have layering only in certain zones.  What you want is sharding in the 1-10 or 1-20 zones, which is what they originally planned to do before they came up with layering.
---
I don't know what the best solution is, whether it's planned server merges, sharding in the early zones, fixing the layering system, or something else entirely.  But I'm glad people are making noise about it because this needs to be addressed.
---
Thanks guys

Thats a whole lot of if and maybes not he best argument.
---
I was level 31 and my friend was level 30.  We were ganking people level 28-35.  Guess I didn't make it clear that we were going for fair pvp?  Ganking greys is boring and a waste of time.

Better gear systems with one almost 100% rng free where you upgrade your pieces with a currency you farm, which should take you about 2 months to max. Also they all have some effect like 2% frost resistance working in the raid &amp; Nazjatar, drop fish from mobs or increased mount speed. For raids there'll be some pretty interesting items, like a set of items which have a powerful effect customized and buffed by how many people in the party wear one of those items (each item add one thing to the party wide effect and they stack)
---
Essences, no matter how bad azerite may be, are a non RNG, long term reward system. Each rank has a requirement (kill Azshara in the raid for X difficulty, reach X arena rating, farm X amount of honor, be exalted with rep X, do a mythic +X in time and so on), once you complete it you can use it like a talent &amp; there won't be a catchup for those. 
---
Mechagon is one of the best outdoor content they ever made with nice rewards like a fully customizable trinket or a set of rings where one gives you how it'll activate and the other what it'll do. 
---
Overall, it gives you goals to work forward with minimum RNG involved. TF is still a thing, the mythic + system is still the same but you can already know what you'll need in 8.2 and exactly what you need to do to obtain it. 
---
There's also flying for those who like it and a WPvP event which may end up being a lot of fun.

---
What are you sacrificing besides a smoother launch?
---
Thats the most pessimistic way to look at it. 
---
One, it rewards loyal patrons who already are subbed.
---
Two, its $7.50 to reserve 3 names. $2.5 per name. If that cost is too high for you thats fine, but lets not act like its a ridiculous price.
---
Three, it increases some server stability. Its tens of thousands of people who aren't sitting in a character login screen deciding on their name and hairstyle etc. 
---
There are benefits to this beyond just "herr derr blizzard greedy".
---
The fact that you didn‚Äôt put the Warcraft 1 poster in between the two faction emblems is a crime on par with human trafficking.

I wouldn't even be mad if BfA wasn't such utter shit. But I'm not gonna pay 7 bucks just to reserve a name (or 15/month for a shot at beta access)
---
Activision is truly like a cancer tumor.
---
Yeah I can say that I'm one of the players they are currently looking at other classes to play now after deciding to play hunter at the release, it's not enjoyable at all to play on the beta and it sure as hell removed the hype for me to play hunter...
---
Go priest. Theyre super fun and have great spells. Shaman is nice too but it will be heavily overpopular
---
Cat, I'm not ruining anything. Please chill.
---
Looks to me like there are 44 curent bugs. Still a lot but IDK where you are getting 53 from.

Perditions and CHT. Split of the tier armor to get the bonuses. Looks almost exactly like mine until we rerolled at TBC. Cold blood ambush-&gt;backstab

The leeway mechanic existed entirely to account for latency was my understanding.

Perhaps my understanding is wrong.

Every single effing zone that has Horde-eligible quests in it.  Seriously, I hit them all.  No it's not efficient, but I enjoy experiencing as much of the world as I can while levelling.

Upvote: Omar face

---
This so much LOL
---
Banter definitely lost in translation. Saying you wont pay them money every month is the only thing Blizzard understand or care about.
---
Its almost as if its beta, a tool used to test and fix things  with 2 months till launch.
---
Think I watched a vid from that wall walking-event with ‚ÄúShakawkaw‚Äù as soundtrack, that got me into the wonderful world of Infected Mushroom
---
They'll matter when Wow classic launches, until then it's whatever.
---
But if I hop layers to kill the horse again then its always fresh.
---
Payo: AAAAAHHHH
---
For me, layering is acceptable if it is not long term and only if the gathering exploits get fixed. I want classic realms to have solid population and I want people to be able to play. I think it is important for the long term success of classic to have a good first impression. Launch should have competition for tags and some queues for items, but not a complete standstill. Give the folks who haven't played vanilla a chance to see why it's a better game.
---
I mean apes pretty much did that already lul
---
Yeah i already re rolled on the beta, i'm not waiting to classic for that
---
I love that you think no druids would be an issue
---
The lack of apparent progress is not good.
---
Shadow priest really buff a warlock group though. Buuuut only 1/40required
---
Aye, on the spreedsheet it's 43 listed, but there is some "really minor" ones that are not listed on the document,  but aye..
---
Feralas, something about it was always fairytale-esque
---
You shouldn't go NE warrior because it's not the meta and min/max.
---
Best advice I could ever give would to naturally find a guild/players you enjoy playing with in the server you roll on.
---
I know, but the bow is only .1 second slower than the gun and actually has better top end damage.  The main difference being the ammo which I think my stats are wrong.  I think the mithril slugs are 12.5 dps and the best non uldaman bow arrows are 7.5.  Im just not sure how that affects top end damage was the main question.  I assume a 5 dps diff on ammo is a big deal. 
---
also no ranged weapon has more than a 3.0 attack speed in this bracket.
---
Retail cannot into portal

---
Vanish immunity was a thing until LK I think. It was definitely there. I asked about it early today to confirm it still works. It is useful in PvE and PvP. Regular stealth and shadowmeld don't give you any immunity. It unfortunately doesn't call off pets either.
---
Exactly, build some muscle!
---
I heard the hunter population was mostly due to people wanting a ranged way to tag mobs during the stress test. I doubt they‚Äôll be that high during classic launch.
---
Last expansion I purchased was MOP. So I am very excited for Classic but yeah name and beta thing is just smart business.
---
Cooldown is not a bad idea, but what if I join a group doing a quest, I get layered and now I'm on cooldown. Now lets say the same scenario happens minutes later, but I can't join them because I can't join their layer.  
---
The question i guess would be, what's the conditions of getting a cooldown and for how long would this cooldown take effect.
---
Well here we are in 2019 simulating lag into our games...JFC what a shit show
---
&gt; Just because you vanished didn't mean we couldn't still see you.
---
That's exactly what Vanish meant.
---
ED Brothers, a support group for erectile dysfunction meets HERE on Wednesdays at 7pm

What is an if and maybe? That people upon hitting 60 will farm for resources? What do you do when you hit 60 before pvp is enable. Grind gear, grind resources. The cutting edge always get an advantage for being first, just this time its a bit more lucrative before the server catches up. A few people per server will get quick epic mounts because they were 60 first, how game breaking. 
---
Like actually think how these "abuses" actually change anything, Who is leaving a fresh respawn of herb nodes to try and find a new layer that they hope isnt farmed, and lose their path in the process. In what world does that make sense.  Literally just fear mongering without any critical thinking.
---
Totally agree.  Simulating lag into a video game because #nochanges is fucking stupid.
---
Hunters complaining.
---
This definitely is Classic Wow!
---
Remember that some of the best PVP gear is PvE raiding gear.
---
Now that you mention it, i think you're right. I played a Mage in Vanilla but admittedly my memory isn't the best
---
120 ping vs 20 ping tho :(
---
The spell or company?

Things like is what I was worried about
---
And it was very effective for them to do so
---
Damn. Thats epic.
---
Redridge for the the elite Orc compound. Now that that's out of the way, can we talk about this map suggesting Stockades was a level 29-38 dungeon?!
---
If you're trying to get a super popular name like; Executie, Swifty, Asmonbald, Oprahwindfury, Beefcake, Unbreakable, etc. you're gonna have to forsake looks and just type it as fast as possible.
---
Anyway, I don't think an addon exists for this as addons change the functionality of the game and I'm not sure the character creator functions the same way, but idk.
---
Either way I'd be shocked if this existed.
---
Works fine on Android
---
No, Addons run when the game runs. Character creation is not the game.
---
Blood Elf Protection Warrior (With the double blade and shield all the guards have)
---
The details of what bugs are irrelevant, I‚Äôm not addressing what bugs there are rather I‚Äôm seeking to know if they will be fixed by launch
---
&gt;Thats the most pessimistic way to look at it. 
---
BfA is a shitshow. They're literally trying to lure people to spend sub money on that shitshow for a shot at beta and being able to reserve char names. Don't suck up to them like that. I've been a Blizzard loyalist for years and their decisions in the past couple years that have been driven solely by greed don't warrant any further support. The people who pay for this crap are the reason why they think they can get away with it. What they're trying to do with beta access and name reservation requiring an active sub is nothing short of a scummy cash grab.
---
&gt;Two, its $7.50 to reserve 3 names. $2.5 per name. If that cost is too high for you thats fine, but lets not act like its a ridiculous price.
---
Apologists like you are the reason why the gaming industry is plagued with scummy publishers doing greedy cash grabs all over the place. "Just 2.50 to reserve a name. But only if you wanna reserve 3, otherwise it's up to 7.50 per name. VALUE MATE. 2.50 for something that costs us literally nothing to produce? Pure value."
---
&gt;Three, it increases some server stability. Its tens of thousands of people who aren't sitting in a character login screen deciding on their name and hairstyle etc. 
---
This is a decent argument but this could have been achieved without looking like greedy cash grabbers. Is (slim chance for) beta access exclusively for people with active subs also with the players' best interest in mind? Or are these things just ways for Greedyvision to increase revenue without offering anything substantial in return?
---
It's unfathomable how after years of Blizzard selling out there are still people who'll pay them to suck their dicks and vigurously this as some sort of benevolent act by Blizzard.
---
Hey you did it too
---
I can just I imagine you sucking spit through your teeth while saying this.  Flipping the pages of a comic book with Cheetos stained fingers
---
Rofl it took me a few seconds before i realized it wasn't real xD
---
It's not layering, it's sharding. The clip from Asmongold's raid killing that elite showed it wasn't layering. They SHARDED into a different shard, no group invites transpired either. They put too many people into one area.
---
Layering is a lie
---
I have never played on a PvE server but am considering it for classic. Had two questions for you, does it tend to always be very chill without any pvp between the faction or is it common to run into people who are flagged for pvp or is it super rare? Also do stuff like attacks on the other sides capital city happen?
---
 Personally I like how world PvP makes the world feel alive and I have to be on the edge always. Myself I never attack anyone but I find it can be fun if people attack. What I dislike are unfair fights and people corpse camping. A dream server for me would be basically a PvE server but with a couple of areas were everyone flagged themselves. So if you wanted some PvP outside a battleground you just headed towards the designated PvP areas. Never going to happen of course but would have been nice.
---
It wasn't my post, I just have the reading comprehension you lack apparently.
---
Asmon didn't take part in Alex "takedown" of Staysafe and after that the usual happened and Asmon become yet another grand enemy of Alex. In some later videos Alex did cut Asmon stream out of context too so it look like the tensions are high so I doubt Asmon an every other Classic player will have any respect for him. Plus Asmon plays with Esfand which is also Alex grand enemy (anyone remember how Alex took down his own podcast due to MarkyMark not banning Esfand on his own Discord due to Alex request? :D)

Won't work at launch though.
---
You can check the dressing tool on wowhead site but i don't know if there's a way to have classic settings only.

oo, thats a good idea, might hope that works and do it
---
in the stress test i reached level 5 before realizing i picked the wrong face :/

The Alliance in WC3 and the Alliance in WoW are not the same entity.

This. It's also impossible to get to the part of Karazhan you screenshotted(without teleporting).

meanwhile Sylvanas enslaving whole races in death and killing civilians who just wanted to see their relatives smh.
---
Did you say he didn‚Äôt say or didn‚Äôt he say, would you say?
---
&gt;This is a decent argument but this could have been achieved without looking like greedy cash grabbers.
---
They're a company. They exist to make money and they offered a service which some people might pay for, but its intention is to reward players who are already subbed. 
---
Either way to get upset at a company for trying to make $$ off of something like a character name reservation seems a bit much dude. 
---
You seem really angry about this though. Sorry for being a Blizzard apologist dick sucker lol
---
Realist.
---
From what I remember, you talk to a Pet Trainer in capital cities (nearby the hunter trainer) and they can teach you new ranks of spells to teach your pet. If you go to your spellbook (P) you can find the Beast Training panel, where you can assign your current pet spells based on what type of creature it is.

You‚Äôre asking if some ‚Äúgamebreaking bugs‚Äù that another person made a post about are going to be fixed before launch.  That‚Äôs barely even a question.  I‚Äôd like to answer yes but I‚Äôm not a blizzard employee. This post is just like asking ‚Äúis beta for bug testing or nah‚Äù?
---
They also scammed Vancleef and cause all that shit with the defias [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaoJehKqQK0)
---
Yeah I‚Äôm fairly certain OP is full of shit
---
I mean to me it's not about whether layering good or not, there's just no alternative. You cannot just have no layering and launch it. There's way more problems that way than with layering.
---
And the difference is how hard it hits and how sustainable the damage is. Warlocks and mages can generate mana.
---
Thanks, do you know if my level/rep will affect the rep reward. ie. can I do the wool quest at level 40 with revered rep and still receive the full benefit?
---
Warlock laughter intensifies

That's dark ahahaha

Dismount from flying is a bug not a feature of layering so should be fixed or facepalm.
---
As for farming - you may get more wealth but the resources in the end are distributed among much higher playerbase. With extreme abuse a small group could acquire way more wealth though - depends how fixed it will be and how short they manage to run it. If they limit it to like 2 weeks max and move level 40+ players onto always one layer then abusing of valuable resources will be limited.

3) I'm lazy as fuck

I‚Äôve been advocating for this.

Have separate smaller servers that are linked. Character names, what factions you pick and guild names get shared across each so when a server eventually needs to merge, boom, no issues.
---
If the servers end up merging, you can either stay on, or transfer to another server of your choosing.

 Enables you to create characters and check out all the animations. Can zoom in as well and also check out various armors how they look on the character.
---
That's a matter for personal reflection. You don't "need" a pummel er to druid tank, it only helps on 2 or 3 bosses anyhow. You do just fine without it. Sure you may not "feel" 100%, but you are just fine to go. Get a good damage weapon, the speed doesn't matter for druids, and you can handle 99% of the content with no issues.
---
Tanks need a couple of things that are not really in the guide book. You need a thick skin, Attitude, and a confidence that might not always be placed correctly. You are the lead of the group in this game, so all responsibility is on your (furry) shoulders. Own it and walk proudly.
---
Nightelf. Shadowmeld + Charge is always a party.

Warlocks are great too.

You do you man :)
---
&gt; But what if I join a group doing a quest, I get layered and now I'm on cooldown. Now lets say the same scenario happens minutes later, but I can't join them because I can't join their layer.
---
But how is that any worse than permanant layers that you can't change. In both cases, you can't join that second group.

That feeling when you've nailed down what class you want to play months in advance so you can watch all the peasants running around trying to figure out what to play...only to realize your class is broken as fuck and it might be worth it to go back to the drawing board and choose another.
---
Then let stupid people be stupid.
---
It's like 10 days played time to 60
---
Let's call it 1  hour per level idk
---
Someone else might know better
---
To me, the game can be enjoyed to its fullest below 100-150 ping. Raiding and higher level dungeons will be harder though. Am I correct that you will Play classic as your first wow experience rather than retail?
---
That might happen a bit, yes, but it's not the end of the world.   It's still the same number of spawns per capita.  
---
Let's say there is 3 devilsaurs.  
---
2 Servers = 6.000 plasyers + 6 devilsaurs.  1 Devilsaur per 1000 players.
---
2 Layers= 6.000 plasyers + 6 devilsaurs.  1 Devilsaur per 1000 players.
---
This is the best solution I have seen since so far.

I'll try to stick more to default as I can, all I'm planning to do is:
---
- Move the player and target frame a little bit closer to the middle (monitors are way bigger now so they are out of the way, but I dont like them on the bottom center like modern UI-s have it)
---
- Use a bar addon only to move the 2 side action bars on top of the 2 extra action bars in the middle as an extra layer (same reason, bigger monitors, I like seeing all buttons in the same place)
---
- Make chat windows really big :D
---
[Even one of the admins of the classic hunter discord is thinking of re-rolling if they don't fix these issues.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/470717264707190794/592428521935339539/66e0970067764d474eb82e860493fe3b.png)
---
I'm in the same boat, I really want to play hunter, but not if I have to deal with all these bugs and various issues.
---
I've read a lot of of ideas on layering, but this one...
---
Layering os there to prevent overcrowding. If you put all lvl 1-15 in the same layer, layering becomes redundant.
---
Holdover from the stress test this past week. A limited version of the game, capped at lvl 15, became available to every user with an active sub on Wednesday afternoon. They shut the servers down Friday, but left the option in the launcher. I predict this is how we'll be able to access it at release.
---
&gt; They exist to make money and they offered a service which some people might pay for, but its intention is to reward players who are already subbed. 
---
Nintendo is, too. But they don't greedily try to scam you out of your money. You always get value for the money you spend on their products. The company argument is a little tiresome. Yes, they need to make money. A proper company does that by offering good and needed or wanted services. A shitty company will come up with schemes and scams to make you pay money for something that is not worth that money, through false advertising, custom currencies (yes custom currencies are cash grabs), omitting essential parts and selling them seperately or tying a much wanted product to a much more expensive shitty product that nobody wants (what Blizz is doing here).
---
As a consumer I have every right to complain about such shady/shitty business practices and people who apologize such behaviour are nothing short of the catalyst that makes this behaviour possible.
---
As a consumer it is as much my right to complain about this shit and try to raise awareness as it is their right to try it out. But if we don't penalize shitty business practices but instead apologize them, like you are, all we achieve is that the companies feel reassured in their scummy tactics.

I believe most doctors and medical professionals are truly advocating for good health, but there have been cases of big pharma paying bonuses to doctors pushing certain meds, people doctor shopping to abuse pills, etc. An unhealthy person that may require daily meds and frequent appointments (through conditions caused by their own actions, mainly dietary in this comment thread‚Äôs focus) certainly generate more income to the medical industry than say someone who has taken care of themselves and not currently needing medicinal assistance. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm being too conspiratorial here.
---
Also the comment you made about physicians being one of the first to bring up the new medicine or preventative measure is accurate, however dietary knowledge in my opinion is lacking in today‚Äôs education and increasing the amount of dietary induced negative medical conditions such as the beetus, strokes, arterial plaque buildup, excess fat, it goes on.
---
Oh god now im cringing at me writing this comment right now about cringing. Whata cringe!!!!!
---
Daggers has a less exciting (simpler) dps rotation than swords/maces.
---
Non-human rogues do very similar dps whether dagger or sword spec, however humans will prefer swords thanks to their racial. Most of the time, the most important determination of which spec is the most DPS for you is what weapon you have.
---
Agreed, that is why you don't put them on the same layer. 
---
Please re-read what I have written.
---
Platinum WoW makes some good skits
---
12 days played
---
You are 100% wrong lol. Whether there‚Äôs 3 layers with 9000 people or 1 server with 3000 people the amount of mats per population is the exact same.
---
Stop.
---
So what's your alternative? Let's hear it. I'm sick of reading the same bullshit, at least post what you'd do about it, and don't just say SIT IN THE 8 HOUR QUEUE.
---
9,000 without means:
---
- 1,500 per starting zone
---
3,000 with three layers means:
---
- 500 per starting zone (three times)
---
It's simple. Would you rather fight against 499 others for the 25 wolves in Northshire Abbey
---
Or would you rather fight against 1,499 others for the 25 wolves in Northsire Abbey?
---
A realist would acknowledge that people will play shadow priests their own way and not go smite build because it‚Äôs better, but stay shadow because they find it more fun. It‚Äôs not a big deal and these people won‚Äôt impede on your personal fun

It‚Äôs not nostalgia driven, private servers for classic have run overwhelmingly successfully for YEARS
---
Thank you very useful thread
---
Sarcasm? He got rich by spending his energy on videogames...this dude got rich by doing nothing that matters.
---
To add some extra flair, if you die in the game, drink a beer prior to resurrection (does not include BGs).
---
Its classic, everything will be overplayed lmao
---
People like this don't have solutions.
---
They will just bitch and bitch without providing an answer.
---
Do you want 8 hour queues or to deal with layering for the first part of the game?
---
I wouldn't trust this much, I get around 150ms in-game and this website is telling me 200+ ms.
---
A big reason for it is because they are actually testing the tech right now and even though there are only about 2k players they are split onto multiple layers to actually test the thing. You won't have so many empty layers to exploit on the real servers.
---
A realist will tell you if you want to raid you won't be doing it in a meme spec unless you have an in group and that if you want to raid you will bite the bullet and play your classes best spec. 
---
Because in reality people want gear for their effort, not to die on simple dps checks.
---
its been years for me, but why is some spots of the map not shown, like browned out? are there no places in those spots on the map or what?
---
I‚Äôd say focusing on a career that earns you multi millions by the time you‚Äôre 30 matters quite a bit.
---
I'm not keeping myself that up to date with all this as i think i should but my plan has been on going hunter since i played that in Vanilla back in the days. Is it really as bad as everyone makes it sound? And if i would play again should I as well look to play something different?
---
2 dps and 1 heal spec vs 1 dps and 2 heal specs. Do you  want full on healing or partial healing with great group utility? 
---
Both classes are great imo and believe me, I‚Äôm in the same boat.
---
The real problem is that of those 3 layers you mentioned (3k each, 9k total), probably 2 of those layers will quit before phase 2 starts. Which leaves 3k people with 9k people worth of mats. It fucks the economy. 
---
Now, here me out, I am totally on board for layers and do not think there is another option that is as good. But this problem is the one I am worried about the most.
---
Let's just put it like this: people have been put in jail for less. You seriously **must** jump into instance portals.
---
In my experience, if you flag yourself in a contested zone on a PVE realm you will often be jumped by bloodthirsty members of the enemy faction. Running flagged through PVE Stranglethorn Vale will still be stressful.
---
Attacks on enemy capitals happen just as frequently in my experience (this is more of a PVE activity with a sidedose of PVP anyway). 
---
Based on what you've described it sounds to me like you'd prefer a PVE realm where you flag yourself for the danger/excitement but have the option to opt out when things get frustrating or toxic. There's also the bonus that PVE realms don't tend to attract people who like to corpse-camp so you'll generally get less of that anyway (even if you remain flagged). 
---
It also sounds like you'd enjoy Gurubashi Arena skirmishes.
---
Should change that 21 to 19
---
Yes smoother launch will result in healthier games ..... history shows that terrible launches kill games.
---
STV!
---
I'm probably going to look for a PvP server that is established as the unofficial RP-PvP server. If I can't find it, I'll just go PvP, and try RP later on.
---
Who said anything about server firsts?  Its about efficiency, which can be pursued at literally any point in the games life cycle, how dense are you?  I'm not trying to attack you here, but you're being moderately stupid about this, we're literally agreeing on like 75% of what we're talking about.
---
I think we were basically thinking the exact same thing with our comments. Agree completely.
---
That's because bg's (AV,WG) are released in phase 3. AB will be released in phase 4. With no bg's no battlemasters (:
---
It‚Äôs blizzard not activision but nice try
---
That‚Äôs not any different than merging dead servers once people leave, which is the only alternative to layering.
---
Reported
---
Agreed, also layering is going away after a month (possibly sooner), how are people still bothered about it
---
I'm not trying to respec priest twice before endgame. How much of a pain is leveling into the meta endgame build? I intend to heal in 5-mans, not super concerned about raiding but I do want the best healer possie in case a guild actually takes me in.
---
Beta doesn't run till the day the game starts. If you change something that touches damn near everything in the  game a player does then you probably want to be testing it for quite a while to find each of those little bugs that come out.
---
We'll see how awesome you think it is when the aimed shot doesn't kill someone and your autoshot is broken.
---
Duskwood. Played on that server and love that zone. It's home
---
wow there is so many bugs on classic wtf
---
I backpedal into those
---
The good part about druid leveling is that it is lest gear dependent class in the game for leveling purposes. You scale off stats so there is no HUGE spike with one piece of gear.
---
Launch queues for new MMO's are 1-2 hours. Yeah that sucks but it only lasts a few days in most cases. I'd rather have 1-2 hour queues for a few days than weeks of phasing. At least when I finally log in, the game is actually good.
---
In my experience, the only ones flagged for pvp intentionally were the ones that would beat you in a fight.  Only sometimes you get the poor fool that was flagged for helping someone else in a battle.
---
In vanilla, bliz did eventually give us oceanic realms (though I'm pretty sure they were US East servers with our timezone.) When I last played wow they did have server farms in sydney so I'm assuming we'll have at least two local servers at launch with more rolled out as needed.
---
If that isn't the case, casters are much easier to play. I still have terrible memories of *must be facing target* or whatever the error message was that meant you just did nothing to the enemy on your screen while your health dropped to 0. More of an issue for PvP but it also means less time to react in raids etc and ranged dps/heals usually are dealing with fewer mechanics.
---
Ashenvale, STV, Un'Goro and my favorite, The Barrens.

It's activision Blizzard and there is a huge correlation between Blizzard becoming greedy sellouts and them merging with activision. Whether or not that's really the reason I don't know, but Activision is shitty enough either way so I have no remorse in putting the blame on them (and the Blizzard guys who decided to sell out to them)
---
Please prove them all wrong!
---
Make a guild allowing only off meta specs as raiders. I'd like to hear how it went!
---
that one actually is a "consumable" that any min/maxing raid feral druid needs to use. Not really a leveling item. But good addition to OP's knowledge bank.
---
I can only speak to my experience in the original PVE server (Aerie Peak - US) I was involved with, and I am certain this varies by server:
---
&gt; does it tend to always be very chill without any pvp between the faction or is it common to run into people who are flagged for pvp or is it super rare?
---
It was pretty chill most times. Generally what would happen is that battles would occur from time to time and get announced faction-wide. Anyone going there who was not just leveling would flag themselves by joining in the battle (generally this happened in two places, Tarren Mill/Southshore or Winterspring, from my recollection).
---
This sort of changed through time in one spot: STV. In STV, there was a sort of "unwritten law" that you flagged PVP at all times while questing there. I wasn't sure how this came about (it had to do with a forum post on the server at the time), but you'd generally get harassed *by your own faction* if you weren't flagged for PVP in STV. This was not representative of any other PVE/RP server I'd been on prior.
---
&gt; Also do stuff like attacks on the other sides capital city happen?
---
Yes, when players were bored. Also, we'd have 1,000 level one gnome raids on crossroads/Orgrimmar occur from time to time, or other strange events which were coordinated on the Realm forums.
---
&gt; What I dislike are unfair fights and people corpse camping. 
---
This was the complete extent of my experience leveling on an RP-PVP server in TBC. There was no quarter given, and most of the time the opponents were bored level 50-60 players who took perverse joy in repeatedly murdering lowbies.
---
Then, higher-level players from your own faction would wipe them out. Then, for a brief time, there'd be an equal battle, before some people lost interest and everything quieted down again.
---
What professions should I take as a wanna be feral OT? I know enchanting is basically required for the Smoking Heart of the Mountain trinket but I hate leveling enchanting while leveling. My original plan was herb / alch.  
---
I plan on leveling an alt as well, either a mage or warlock. My current plan is to level my druid with enchanting and either herb or skinning for extra gold and then my Mage / Lock as tailoring + either LW or Alch depending on what my druid takes in order to send over completed stuff. The benefit of tailor + lw would be to make greens for my druid to DE.
---
Any thoughts? Anyone with experience with feral know how important engineering would be?
---
Who had that kind of equipment in 2004?
---
Actually, this $1,400 monitor is pretty compelling for WOW. 
---
WOW Classic supports 32:9.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BE5AzaSv_vI#t=3m16s
---
So you really just gonna try and remake this server like that after you had a damn meltdown and deleted the first one because Europeans wanted to be included?
---
You need to not be leading any damn thing, you caused enough confusion and wasted enough peoples' time with the first server.
---
You can level just fine with PW:Shield, SW:Pain and wanding, zero downtime.
---
Layering: If I were to play with a friend, we could end up in two different layers. But forming a group would transfer one of us to the other, correct?
---
That's what makes it that makes it much more likely to introduce bugs. It's right where 2 systems, not on the same client, interacting with each other with very specific assumptions made about each other. There is probably plenty of code on the client side of spells that says "hey this is going to take some time to be recognized so do A and B until I'm processed".
---
You poor precious snowflake
---
You dont get why people dont want to be playing the game already?
---
Got nothing better to do OP?
---
Shamans won‚Äôt be more popular than mages, warriors, hunters and rogues. Shaman will be middle pack with priests and warlocks. Druid is always dead last mainly because of the Tauren only restriction. 
---
That said - shamans have 3 distinct roles, 1 of which (melee) is best suited 1-59. Ele is best suited in a group PvP setting. Resto is best suited as a raid healer and buffbot. 
---
Shaman imo is more visually exciting than priest and generally has less talent leeway than priests making them easier to heal with. Essentially, priests are the best horde tank healers and shamans make for ideal raid healing.
---
When I played vanilla back in 2006 I rolled on Demon Soul as Alliance, one of the first horde dominated servers. It was bad, every interaction was getting jumped at low health and never being able to go to half the quest areas due to overwhelming opposition. After dealing with that for a year I no longer play on PvP servers, although I still love BGs, and RvR style MMOs.
---
Does he know what he‚Äôs playing come live yet?
---
Gotta love America, old enough to get sent over seas and die in a war, but not old enough to drink alcohol.
---
I'll be enchanting on my druid as well. You can make gold on a fresh server by crafting the low level wands (which are BiS and pretty much essential for leveling priests). Have an alt level tailoring or something and you can send your crafted green/blues to the druid to DE for easy leveling early on.
---
It actually has good stats for leveling too, just don't use the charges.
---
Any 2 handed staff with good daamage should do ya, as weapon speed isn't an issue for druids. Get stats if you can, but it's not really necessary.
---
Your best piece of gear for quick and easy leveling is a Priest partner.
---
Big True! üôè
---
Yeah, I agree that if you spend more time playing, you should be rewarded for it, and thats coming from someone who used to no life the *fuck* out of the game and can't anymore.  My life changed, I can't play for 16 hours a day anymore, boo fucking hoo, I'll get over it by playing way more efficiently than I used to.
---
Back then, I could brute force the game and just trade an immense amount of time for results, now I'll be more methodical and calculated in my play to get the best results out of my limited time frames.
---
Adapt and overcome.

Your pet training is actually thrown in your general tab.   It's fucking dumb.  You have to go there and find it, and then you can train your pet.   The first pet you get won't have any pts, but you can still teach it growl.    After that it's a matter of stabling the pet you want to keep, going out to find a new pet with an ability that you want, and then tame him.   After that you just use that pet for a few minutes until you learn it's skill.   Then you abandon that pet, if you don't want it, and go back to get your pet.  Then you can teach it the new skill, assuming you have sufficient points.

I don't care I just want to play bugs and all.

Ok? It has a horde logo next to it and the linked video is from the pov of a shaman
---
Really hope they can fix this shit. Classic WoW will fail only due to Blizzards lack of attention to detail and inability to fix bugs.
---
I feel like this may have been answered before. Are there a list of potential servers and what play styles they will be. I.e. used to play on Altar of Storm which was a PvP server.
---
Honestly probably around 20-30 ingame hours. An average time for a competent leveler to 60 is about 5 days played or 120 hours. Half way to 60 is around lvl 42 or so (time wise) so if 42 takes 60 hours then you can guesstimate maybe 30 or so hours for lvl 30. Lvl 20 would be much more achievable obviously in a shorter amount of time.
---
That staff is the main reason I want to roll priest, so cool.
---
You don't even have to eat healthy to lose weight. You could literally just eat ice cream, and though it would be awful for you, it's definitely possible to lose weight.

The thing that people get caught up on is that you have to eat below your TDEE, and that's it.

You are confusing marketing marked as beta to an actual teat of the game. This beta is pure publicity. Ibdo not think the intention is a well poliahed game for beta and it never is. 
---
Blizzard going silent on things is typical, if you have no new then there is nothing to say. I know you want a " we acknowledge there are issues and we are working on them" but that just creates a perception of bias to a class, "Why are hunters getting so much attention us &lt;insert class&gt; are justvas broken!?" Is the line of thinking.

You know you made it as a priest once you get that staff

i'd have to agree. it's just the retail system

I don't remember how STR translates into Cat AP. I just remember I always wanted AGI.
---
Thank you very much, ill save that one
---
I'm willing to bet the top guilds will have a dedicated large group of players possibly taking shifts to get 40 toons to lvl 60 asap.
---
You could just do the sensible thing and move.
---
nostalgia
---
Yeah you will have to sub for it
---
I was a furry warrior born in a hunters body that's why I need priority over that 1 handers than the rogue
---
immersion during leveling which to me is just as important if not more as endgame
---
I see 49 on it, but i don't know if it got updated or not but still it's a hell of a bugs...
---
This seems very much like it's caused by testing parameters and lots of manual debugging. They could have numbers and limits and whatnot deliberately low for testing purposes, so that they can different variants of layering mechanics repeatedly to gather as much test data as possible. At least that's what I hope it is.
---
The xp curve is pretty gentle early on so depending on your classes 20 is achievable in a few hours (first two zones) just casually playing. 20-30 is comparable to 1-20.

weapon damage doesn't matter for druids, just stats.

Not going to play hunter, but i'm going away on holiday at release for a month so hopefully when i'm back all these bugs and other gameplay/quest bugs will be fixed so i can actually enjoy the game hah
---
It needs to be PvP realm
---
Yep. From streamer demonstrations it occasionally requires one of you to relog, but grouping seems a guaranteed method of getting on the same layer.
---
You want just whatever has the the most stats as the weapon damage doesn't affect your feral damage.

Bingo
---
ding ding ding!!! Correct!
---
I've subbed for years and years, since launch all those years ago, and to me (and as was stated above but ignored by you it seems) this is a reward for that. So was my beta access.
---
 I'm sorry people can't handle the idea some of us enjoyed retail wow enough to play, and while I admit BFA is bad and I still haven't hit 120 as of writing, I have had enough enjoyment up until now to justify my sub and while I haven't touched retail in months in a serious way, I am happy it allows me to save my names that I desperately want and pick a server ahead of time so that any of my old friends who join me know where to go before launch hits. 
---
If you don't want to pay then don't, wait and hope. If it matters that much to you, sub on the 12th of August. Either way it doesn't matter since it seems you will be subbing on the 26th.
---
oh yeah, english is not my first language and i got it wrong
---
Duskwood has some of the best questlines in terms of writing. The atmosphere is so good as well.
---
You say that till one of them ninjas something you've been needing

All those boxed CE‚Äôs gave me a :‚Äî
---
I never stated it was neither better or worse. But the inital problems would still revolve around what the conditions of how layering would take effect and what the cooldown time would be. If layering can take effect at random times because the server decides *it's too crowded here*, the problems which are shown in this post is still relevant. 
---
&gt;   In both cases, you can't join that second group. 
---
The difference is that with the cooldown scenario is that were still in the same "world", i would still se your message in General chat for example. I could still join your group. With my idea, you effectively are in a different server completely, and I wouldn't even know you existed.
---
I have no biases, your idea might be better than mine
---
Weapons are just stat sticks for feral druids.
---
Agi = Crit, Dodge, and AP in Cat
---
Str = Armor and AP in Bear
---
Stam = More heatlh
---
\+AP, +Hit, and +Crit are very good too.
---
Thanks for the reply. Only problem for me with Gurubashi Arena is that it's so remote from the capital cities. Don't think I would have the energy to go there just to experience PvP. Also more fun if it's only horde vs alliance. Fighting your own faction isn't as fun.
---
Let him choose class on what he relates most to. He‚Äôll figure it out, explain the classes but dont do it too much mechanically
---
no i dont watch his videos. i have been playing druid on retail vanilla until MOP and started playing druids on undocumented servers in late cata. I disagree with some stuff he says.
---
Human is the best, because of sword skill.   Even if yo want to play daggers, you typically end up switching at some point, because a good dagger just doesn't drop.  If you want to just stay daggers, or pvp, then it doesn't matter much.  Gnome might be better for pvp.  
---
Professions.  Herb and Alchemy or Engineering and mining.   You might want to try herb alchemy to level, and then switch out either herb or alchemy for mining.  Then level mining to 300, and then drop mining to pick up engineering.
---
Personally I think this game will be 100x more fun with friends. Try to convince them to roll alliance even though it's not as cool as horde. Just explain that you don't have good taste and they, as your friends, will forgive you!
---
Thanks for the reply. Sounds like a fun server with that unwritten law.
---
phase 1 will offer me enough time. thank you :)
---
Doesn't everyone who raided WOTLK Naxx know this? It is not some obscure fact.
---
It‚Äôs been shown it can be done and it will be done again. We know it‚Äôs not optimal or the best way to play. We know that‚Äôs not a big deal. Get off your high horse, let people live a little.
---
i always play alliance
---
I've noticed in general that I missed less often during the stress test compared to private servers. Obviously I couldn't test dual wield since the level cap was only 15, but using a 2-handed weapon or sword/board, I still missed less often than using a 2-handed weapon or sword/board on a private server.
---
I can lie, you are not wrong about hte marketing beta thingy, but it still is a test of the game at the same time, and atm they are not doing a good job of showing it...
---
RP-PVP region locked, english language only, streaming forbidden
---
1 str is 2 AP IIRC. But agi is only slightly better in terms of stat priority.

How else are you going to farm old content for transmogs and mounts?

I should have clarified - I meant the dungeons from recent expansions. I figured you could just queue for any dungeon you want.
---
The undead ain't a flower to be smelled even in Vanilla. They may whine how the humans rejected them, fair play, but they are still working on a deadly plague, using live sentient subjects as test rats.

Orcs alternatively are invading night elf territory to cut trees.

It makes total sense. You're in denial and don't want to admit it's pay2win. You're gonna do you and think it's fair no matter what I say, so w/e.

Are they even aware of this list? feels like there's too little noise going around for such a large list tbh.

you really think they will limit servers to 15k people? that seems oddly low.
---
True, it‚Äôs a number game: calories in vs. out as far as losing weight goes. For proper nutrition it takes a little research and balancing

pp lol
---
He mentioned a lot more than Mages but okay. Mages, Warlocks, and Druids are the only classes that can reliably beat a Warrior that's leveling up. 
---
I've leveled up multiple warriors and I'm not scared of Rogues, Hunters, Priests, Shamans, or Paladins. If I have FAPs I'm not scared of Mages either. Then once you hit level 60 and start getting some gear, it's a completely different story.. Nearly every class will be afraid of a geared Warrior.
---
Fair, but the point still stands because they have to put a portal somewhere so in future releases the current content can be farmed by higher level characters. At least it still seems use instead of being just for leveling. 
---
I'm surprised they just don't teleport you at will to any dungeon now though, I mean hell, why not at this point.

Proof?

No elves, the root of all problems in azeroth.

This one as well.

The First Horde did that, led by Blackhand/Gul'dan and influenced by the Legion. Thrall's Horde is a completely separate entity from that Horde. 
---
But the Alliance when going to Kalimdor was not tolerant of any of the natives, and they instantly made enemies with the Tauren. Thrall found the Tauren and helped them rather than kill/subjugate a race in danger.

It's because reddit is full of snowflakes who cant handle another's opinion.

Yes, but that's simply the reason it's in the launcher. The game was made widely available, and I'm sure it's have been a pain to code in "Option will only appear to active subscribers" or whatever. Imagine subbing to WoW and having to download an update for the launcher just for the option to appear.
---
Most likely I'll be playing a durotar hunter, depending on pet AI issues getting fixed up before launch.
---
Well it doesn't help that I have a scar that used to be at the hair line, now a good inch ahead of it :/
---
Maybe because we don‚Äôt need a thousand redundant layering threads.
---
People are creating a ton of threads about the same exact thing when other threads already exist. I'm guessing mods are just getting rid of the thousands of 
---
"MY IDEA TO FIX LAYERING" or "LAYERING IS GOING TO RUIN THE GAME" threads. It gets kind of exhausting when every thread is about the same thing.

At least this sub isn't as crazy as the official. Any heated discussion you pretty much get perm banned over there.

 I played on dialup until 4-5 months into BC

No you don't. Your clear and present vendetta against the mod team is obvious and I suggest you reconsider your position, lest you find yourself at the receiving end of the banhammer.

Your post was low effort, the mods are doing a great job, deal with it.
---
Its not consistent because Ion is a stupid piece of shit with zero concept of what makes a game good.  He relies purely on analytics to tell him anything, as if pure analytics means a damn thing.  This is a guy who in dev watercoolers talks about how player time investment must equate to players having fun, because why else would they be playing if they weren't having fun? He can't recognize that people nowadays log in, do their daily bullshit, then log right off because theres zero depth to the game outside of "do dailies/weeklies for max rewards, log off, repeat".
---
Back in Vanill/BC/Wrath, shit even Cata and MoP to a degree, I could log in, go grind some Timbermaw rep or whatever I wanted to pursue, I could go do it for 20 minutes, or 20 hours, or anything in between.  Today, there is a cap to how much rep I can grind for a faction thats important to me, and its capped by how many daily quests are up for that faction, how many world quests did I do with a stupid inscription buff item that gives TEN FUCKING REP per world quest.  So my only incentive is to log in once every 24 hours, bang out a handful of WQ's, then log the fuck off, because what else is there to do if my raid is locked out and my friends aren't on for PvP (as if PvP is even good right now)?
---
If I miss a day, I'm forever a day (or two or three or whatever) behind, I can't spend extra time on Saturday to make up for being busy Monday through Friday like I used to be able to.  Its awful design, and I place the blame entirely on Ion's shoulders, because he was the final sign off saying "Yeah, this model is good, lets shift the game to it".
---
I realize this rant has nothing to prove that there are two design teams, but I've had a funny feeling ever since WoD, and especially post Legion launch, that there was just no way that they could make a totally boneheaded game decision, completely reverse it next expansion and make the game feel "good" again, then totally backtrack the very next expansion for seemingly no reason.  What else could it be other than an entirely separate group that fucking *sucks* at communicating with each other?  It literally doesn't matter if every decision has to be ran past Ion, because they can show him a pretty graph and some other data their godawful analytics told them players will like because "derp, they spent a lot of time doing this, so its super popular with the playerbase".
---
More food for thought, activi$ion Blizzard sucks SO much at making fun games nowadays, their most popular/hyped content is a Starcraft: Brood War remaster, a WC3 remaster, and WoW Classic, even Diablo 2 has a larger active playerbase than Diablo 3, and their newest Diablo announcement was a [total fucking flop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50KBNQe5hTM).  Let that sink in.  Remasters of 15+ year old franchises are the most hyped thing coming out of Blizzard right now, over newer shit.
---
I've only played mage from these classes so I was just speaking from my own experience. Yeah if you have FaPs you have a better chance, but you're probably not gonna spend a lot of gold on that while levelling cuz you need gold for your mount.
---
How do you beat a hunter as a warrior tho? They're masters of kiting, how would you even get close?
---
I was 6 in vanilla and played it. I was mainly an altoholic but would get chars upto around lvl 35 or 40. My favorite was rogue because my dad played one so i did too. TBH just let him try them out or do whatever sounds cool. My favorite part was exploration of everything from the world to the various classes. Now that im 21 and classic is being released once more im planning on going back to my childhood rogue but instead of being am altoholic, imma raid and do all the things i never did before. Hope this helps.

Cause he tells his viewers what to think, and they go parroting that and all of the sudden you have the very vocal minority that makes devs think the changes they want is what everyone wants.

More like it's so ripe for abuse it's not worth it when you can just ignore those people. It encourages a new subset of people just as toxic as the ones they call toxic. They lack any sort of social acceptance or the ability to understand and tolerate other ideas not their own. No one liked the tattle tale in grade school who told on you for whispering damn to your friend and no one likes them now. Trying to police language is a futile attempt and positions you as a rock in an always changing sea of language. More often than not these people think everything is offensive to the point of ad nauseam. 
---
I like how Esfand puts it. Right click reporting doesn't do anything besides fight gold sellers. By the time you write out the paragraph you probably have cooled down and realized it's not a very big deal. Otherwise you're the guy going "ummm Mr.Blizzard this guy called me a poopy face."
---
They are deleting them because we the users are asking for it to be done through reporting. We have grown tired of the same shit about layering being posted every few minutes. What is really unfriendly to the users is content spamming of the same information and subjects that pushes and buries all other posts.
---
I farted
---
If 99% of those threads were about the same thing and there have been 9 million threads on the same subject already -
---
Good.
---
If everyone did what they were supposed to and keep the discussion about stuff like, oh I don't know -LAYERING- in its own thread, upvoted and continued on, we would be fine.
---
But this is Reddit, where everyone has to make their own thread thinking that is contributing to the discussion because they are too afraid that their useless comment will get lost in a mega thread because it more than likely is yet another hot take with little to no grasp on the subject that surmounts to nothing more than REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.
---
Sound about right?

summersault heroic strike ftw

Are all fights required to have a hunter that need tranq shot? I'd wonder if hunters are required, that leaves orc and troll and NE and dwarf that would be the only successful ones.

And the endless cycle continues and you black out until the end of Cata and, poof you realize you wasted another 5 years of your life and still can't use all your abiltiies without looking at your bindings.

&gt;How do you beat a hunter as a warrior tho? They're masters of kiting, how would you even get close?
---
If you manage to get a charge off then the Hunter will probably be dead however if the hunter is good and doesn't allow you near him then you're probably going to die.
---
&gt; I've subbed for years and years, since launch all those years ago, and to me (and as was stated above but ignored by you it seems) this is a reward for that. So was my beta access.
---
But literally everyone can get that. Your constant sub changes absolutely nothing.
---
You know what would've been a cool way? Give players who have an account since classic a chance to reserve a name. There. That'd be cool. No, instead it's anyone who's willing to pay them 7.50 for almost nothing in return.
---
I could make a fresh account right now and get the same "reward" that you get for your 15 years of loyality. I don't quite understand how you can understand this as a reward. 
---
&gt;I'm sorry people can't handle the idea some of us enjoyed retail wow enough to play
---
What does this have to do with anything? Where did I complain about people who are subbed to the game because they enjoy it? Are you just looking for a reason to be offended? 
---
&gt;If you don't want to pay then don't, wait and hope.
---
Is there a problem with me complaining about a shitty business practice on a forum designed to discuss this game?
---
Well thats how layering works.
---
What level should I get to on beta to see if I'll enjoy the class? I was planning to get to 20 on lock, rogue, and priest. Will I get a good idea of how they play?
---
Planning on playing unassisted or with help?
---
At least those think they are adding something to the discussion. I agree they are out of hand but they are trying.
---
Do eeeeet
---
  IDK, I think WC3 explained the faction switch fairly well.
---
Excuse my ignorance, but we're they in vanilla or on private servers. Never heard of them.
---
Came here to confirm this. Ganking is not that bad. Now run through Deadwind Pass Human, dont worry I'll be nice :)
---
You talk like a forsaken
---
Kill their pet and don't step on their traps. If you get the jump on them and get a charge+hamstring its GG. If they get the jump on you its a lot harder but a well timed intercept and trinket out of scattershot can get you back on the hunter who will be in a tough spot without the range advantage
---
Should [this active meme](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c48qed/instance_portals/) deleted or is the moderation arbitrarily picking when the rules apply?
---
I don't think they are required by any means unless you can't cleanse poison and curse. Paladins and mages from dwarves and gnomes could handle it.

Sure, that's a problem to talk about. This is clip is obviously highlighting extreme behavior that isn't actually part of the issue (because we won't see it live). I think it's important to focus that criticism, instead of people thinking this is what layering will look like.
---
Really easy to overlook if you're Alliance
---
Incoming lock
---
The difference is fairly marginal. Just go whatever you want to play the most.
---
Why do we need all these numbers to simply agree that layering reduces the pressure on starting zones? I'm not even discussing pros and cons of layering atm. I'm just trying to understand what you meant by
---
&gt; layering literally has 0, nothing, to do with overcrowded starting areas 
---
even though layering is directly connected with (slightly less thanks to layering) overcrowded starting zones.
---
Which is the stuff that will keep people stranded on low pop servers, while high pop servers continue to grow. Then you try to merge the low pop servers, but unless you can perfectly fit those server pops together to form nothing but other high pop servers, they'll continue to not grow at a pace that will keep up with attrition.
---
Boy
---
Being tankier isn't useful if they can't hold aggro from the rogue.  The rogue will likely get threat from the warrior as soon as he ambushes.
---
Very similar. In WC3, it's basically all the Human Kingdoms, High Elves, and Dwarves, most primarily led by the Kingdoms of Azeroth (Stormwind) and Lordaeron.
---
Come WoW, the High Elves have seceded and Lordaeron has fallen. Night Elves join most likely for an Elven race, but also because Grom killed Cenarius and the Night Elves needed an ally. Gnomes make their return. Humans and Dwarves simply continued the Alliance from WC3.
---
I thought this is how it worked initially. I might be wrong but i think i might have heard it at the time in a preach video, so this isnt anything new really. It would be the obvious thing to do i guess
---
Yup pretty much. I actually think that "you think you do but you don't" was far more correct than anyone is willing to admit yet. 
---
MMOs need a steady stream of new content or they get stale. I just don't see it working in the long run.
---
Leveling is boring as fuck, too. The vast majority of tourists are going to nope out fast, and it really makes me wonder whether servers will have the population to sustain a healthy number of raiding guilds. Without that, the game is basically a wasteland.
---
Horde is red, so it's upvote. 
---
Alliance is blue, so it's downvote. 
---
~~But this all just proves that the horde is better~~
---
This weapon is very good, bought this on my last private server as a feral druid at level 30.  [https://classicdb.ch/?item=13045#comments](https://classicdb.ch/?item=13045#comments) 
---
 It will last a very long time for a feral so a good investment. On a totally fresh server it might be possible to get it fairly cheap. Lots of people will probably have no idea how good it is for a feral. If I had an option to get it at level 30 I would buy it even if it might make me get the mount at level 41 instead of 40. Travel form makes it not a big deal.
---
The moderators decided that discussing layering isn't allowed.
---
This is not how it works. It is currently worse than this
---
Yeah we won't see multiple layers dissolving back to back like that, but we absolutely will see what's seen in the first layer, which shows a pretty empty looking capital city when in fact it was actually filled with players. 
---
Layering needs to be fundamentally reworked because everything I've seen of it has been horrible.
---
Okay, now someone come explain why it *wouldn't* work.
---
&gt;It can break world PvP, and also be used to camp special nodes (Black Lotus and thorium comes to mind)
---
The negative aspects are insanely exaggerated.
---
This is the reason I started playing WoW
---
Oh really? I didn't know I just thought this was a really good idea
---
I love levelling the human and Night Elf zones. 
---
Elwynn is kind of the perfect starter zone. Great pacing and layout, rich personality (but not *too* rich), very pretty, and amazing music. Then you have Westfall, which also has great pacing and a seemingly idyllic atmosphere, but it jolts you with how weak Stormwind actually is. (It also has one of the best dungeons of all time.) And finally, Darkshire, which while not laid out the best has crazy good atmosphere and really nails home how far Stormwind has fallen. It also has one of the most iconic quests in the game. 
---
Night Elf zones aren't nearly as well laid out as human zones. But the aesthetics, music, and general vibe are unparalleled. Teldrassil is definitely the most atmospheric starter zone. Even in retail, only a few, like Eversong, are competitive with classic Teldrassil.
---
Oh ya, I absolutely love keto. The problem is that first week it's so easy to get a craving for some shit food and being like "well it's only 3 days in I can cheat it won't matter"
---
Then it continues on and on. 
---
The first time I did keto and omad I lost 50 pounds in a month and a half. Second time I lost 30 in about the same time. Easy as fuck diet if I can get past that first week.
---
Just a pserver guild that doesn't play human because they are pvp focused(but also clears raids). They did have a druid and their hunters were NE's but close enough.
---
It's shaping up to be an Undead Warlock. I've played Warlock before and always enjoyed the class but I'm excited to see its roots and have some unique utility. Orc Shaman is a close 2nd choice.
---
"bugs" lol that was how it was in vanilla...lmao noobs

they can't

Dwarf Prot Paladin AoE vs UD (including stoneform/Holy Wrath)

Snack on veggies when you can instead of chips and heavy carbs. Jokingly my friends called it the "World of Warcraft diet"

Great, thanks :)
---
&gt; You don't "need" a pummel er to druid tank, it only helps on 2 or 3 bosses anyhow.
---
It doesn't ***just*** help with 2 or 3 bosses. You typically farm 3-5 for the entire raid night. 
---
Rage in Vanilla is generated when you hit, not when you take damage. This weapon increases you attack speed which increases the rage generated.
---
Point being, it's the best tanking weapon a druid can get and if you want to be "the best", you have to have it. 
---
&gt; Tanks need a couple of things that are not really in the guide book. You need a thick skin, Attitude, and a confidence that might not always be placed correctly. 
---
Bruh, I'm not talking about attitude lol. I'm talking about things that are not in the game that should be. I'm talking about bad class design that most new players or average players may not know about.
---
Hopefully they will consider this alternative it has been catching traction lately

Nope lol

Bah was worried about that. I had to take a loan from friends back in vanilla to buy it for 1500g. Spent a ton of time farming herbs and ore in plaugelands to repay that debt. Was hoping to avoid it.
---
That's the Cluster idea that gets thrown around here. Seems to be a a mostly player-friendly way to do it since static server populations are key to building community.
---
So people are supposed to figure out what realm a big stream is on and choose something else?  I feel like too much power is being given to these people.  They are Monetizing the game and dictating social behavior.  Why is their $15 more important than everyone else's?
---
I suspect "first" doesn't really mean anything. I'd wager the guilds that got firsts did so because they were the most hardcore, not because of faction balance.
---
That castle and Loch Modan are why I'll level an Alliance to 30 and no further.
---
Unfortunately didn't see any homies :(
---
Just know, this won't be possible on launch. All these fast leveling guides will be useless.
---
Jump and spin, baby.
---
Yes just like black desert online. A lot easier to moderate and stop the exploitation of the layers
---
Plaguelands.
---
That's odd the linked video is an EU horde guild though.
---
Mostly looking forward to duskwood and wpl. I also want to level in the nightelf/kalimdor areas. As an exclusively alliance player, almost all of my precata old world time was spent in the eastern kingdoms. I want t ok try something new.
---
Insects
---
What if Illidan A and B are still super packed after a few months because they have celebrity players or big, competitive guilds, so they can't take any more players at all, but Illidan C is completely dead and really needs to be merged with another server due to its unhealthy population?
---
vegan too
---
Grabbing multiple gurubashi arena chests in 1 minute? If you saw that and still say you didnt see anything game breaking you are literally retarded.
---
This is the best solution offered I have seen since Classic was announced. Mods, pls leave this thread up.
---
My first character was a Night Elf druid. Teldrassil absolutely blew my mind. Especially how much more immersed in the lore the game was back then. Doing my bear spirit quest to unlock shapeshifting still stands out in my memory.
---
Doing burpees for an entire flight path sounds fucking impossible to most of us üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I don't really have to. Obviously blizzard had considered this idea, it gets spammed everywhere and it's super simple, but they decided to go with layering instead.
---
Here's some issues that I'm just guessing could arrive:
---
a) With a steady decrease in pop the 3 servers would have to get dangerously low in population before blizzard actually merges them. 
---
b) Merges take time, downtime and could cause issues. 
---
c) The system would be hard to adjust as need be.
---
There is a lie somewhere in your story...my guess is the top 5 dps line
---
I want to make a framed fake window print and treasure chest cooler now.
---
You could solve a lot of that by making it possible to switch from Illidan A to B on a fairly long timer. 
---
Having layering will also not solve the issue of overcrowding if tourists don't leave.
---
Exactly. Pick your layer upon character creation just like you would lick a server. Your character stays on that layer. Until they collapse. No phasing in and out of layers.
---
You don't deserve to enter any instances through portals so they just give you the menu that does it for you.
---
Mods need to stop deleting threads the second they read layering and look at the context first.
---
What's life like as a pylon?
---
You are angry about your low effort meme being removed, you couldn‚Äôt care less about the moderation in general. They are doing a great job deleting threads like yours.
---
this is actually a really good idea.
---
Oh hey it's the OP, Love your idea :)
---
Yes it should as well. 
---
You are the person who got a speeding ticket complaining that he/she shouldn't have because other people are speeding too.
---
You put effort into it. It was actually funny. Kudos. I see why it got deleted, however, and wouldn't cry foul or question the moderation of this forum based on that action.
---
I didn't realize how large the photo was. I double tap like I always do and I was pleasantly surprised.
---
Well if you plan on playing a rogue this time around the biggest dilemma playing rogue on a PVP server is the slow leveling process, you‚Äôre just simply too busy murdering people.
---
Barman‚Äôs Shanker on MH
---
&gt; If someone ***knowingly*** rolls on a streamer realm
---
Don't jump to conclusions without reading everything sweety.
---
There's a site dedicated to where streamers play on for a reason. You can avoid or go there, you do you. 
---
Also they aren't monetizing the game. They aren't paid by Blizzard everything is a donation. If you want to fight streamers and think they're bad then go after the fans, the ones who donate and enable it.
---
I cant judge since i didnt see your comment but apparently he did since you deleted your comment
---
Imagine being such a pick-me bitch.
---
They're trying to censor posts about layering because activision is mad that people saw through their bullshit.
---
Mankrik*
---
There's a really helpful demo talent for that iirc
---
*lick a server*
---
More than three Segments would be needed to offer some flexibility in this. I think seven is the sweet spot. If some Segments never need a merge then just leave them alone.
---
So this all makes senses but it seems like you glossed over gold sellers as if it‚Äôs not a huge problem.
---
20 squats anytime someone mentions a streamer? Alright boiz turn off tradechat
---
I didn't delete my comment?
---
it's been posted a lot.  they won't
---
I just scrolled through and saw one person in 'Passeiv fury' They mispelled it, but there's one atleast.
---
Not where near game breaking
---
You realize blizzard has never ever merged servers before, right?
---
Leeway! Jenkins!!!
---
They decided making the exact same thread every couple of hours isn't allowed. I've seen those bullet points in many layering posts now.
---
If you could all just stop making the same post and start posting in other peoples threads, maybe we could have a good time lol
---
It's a trend in every video game subreddits. Important issues that reflect badly on our emperor (giant corporations) are not be stated. Please, enjoy some bread and circus in the form of memes and nostalgia posts.
---
As long as nothing is game breaking I vastly prefer scheduled release. Like the saying goes. There's only 2 certainties; death and bugs.
---
Ya but ice cream
---
That's why both my girlfriend and I tested this exact route I'm doing guides on for 1-15 during the stress test. Even with hundreds of people in the zone, the route worked extremely well and we were able to get far ahead of the pack.   
---
When I hit lvl 6 there was only one other person above level 4 before blizzard deleted the server I was playing on, my girlfriend's server stayed up and she was the first player to hit level 15 using this route.
---
lol that was me, hope I can edit.  
---
 First day i the game, my bro in law and I span invited people until our charter was signed.   Still have ownership of the guild, launched on 5/6/06.
---
Well it shows removed for me. I guess a mod has then
---
I'd rather have the game be perfect but that's not gonna happen. Realistically we could sit here for over a year and probably still find bugs at max level.
---
They merged servers back in vanilla...
---
Why are layering posts being locked?
---
Thx for that, I'm almost in tears seeing all those familiar names
---
Thanks Einstein
---
No they didn‚Äôt.
---
You could have saved some money not buying the new expansions' CEs and place a map up there instead. Well-done though hehe
---
The biggest reason is because Realms 3+ will be graveyards until the server merger. People will tend to fill realms 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 will be dead.
---
With layering everyone gets a booming bustling high pop server and then the layers merge and everyone still has a booming server.
---
Mods love silencing posts and comments about layering. And for some reason will not make a megathread. If you are opposed to layer, expect to get shit down and/or downvoted. 
---
Its sad considering how the current state of layering is game breaking.
---
Same, going to be going from undead area to barrens, can't wait.
---
This would be great and Blizzard should do it. What's nice is that sub-servers which stay healthy can just be renamed as standalone realms, giving the game a chance at long term growth.
---
It's probably a pipe dream though. The game would have to be delayed to accommodate developing any new ideas, and they will not do that.
---
The problem with this is that some classes fundamentally change after certain talents are unlocked/for raiding. Priests are healing only at 60 unless your guild allows a shadow for debuffs or you pvp. Warriors change their entire tree at 40 because of the 31 point Arms talent. 
---
However I would say 20 is a decent level to get a basic feel for how a class is.
---
Will be attempting to be the first to reach 60 playing "unaided" by others. Also playing on a PvP server come launch, so it will definitely be a challenge.
---
This is really good. More stuff like this please.
---
Pretty fucking bigoted if you ask me.
---
Good luck üëç
---
This idea is perfect and there's no logical reason outside of censorship that the origional post was removed.
---
The biggest issue everyone has with layering is the fact they can abuse it to switch layers at a whim.
---
Spot you're wanting to quest in full?   Switch layers!
---
Black Lotus spawn not there?  Switch layers!
---
Oh shit im going to get ganked by a group of ... no wait... i can just Switch Layers!  
---
Outside of the above Layering is also scary as hell because its been proven by all the strummers that it's literally just sharding.  IT has not been setup to be continent wide "shard / layer / whatever"  it's still zoning people / switching shards / layers  when they hit existing shard barriers.     People are not locked to the layer unless they join a group, they're bouncing layers when they hit sharding boundaries. 
---
It would make perfect sense and remove all chance of abuse if the OP's model was enacted.
---
We'd coordinate as a guild and roll on  Server  X  1/2/3 
---
We wont be able to group, talk to (without using battle net) interact or see people on the other servers until they're all merged into a single server,  which would happen at the same time that they would have turned layering off.
---
But because this plan is not Layering / What has been endorsed by blizzard / the influencers  it's going to get censored into oblivion.
---
Shush
---
Yeah I actually didn't know about private servers until blizz shut them down or I'd have definitely been all over that, I first quit after BC. My wife and I used WoW to "hang out" when we had to live in different cities for a while during WOTLK. We both quit shortly after cata was released. I'm excited for her because she's never actually played vanilla. I'm hopeful for BG3 as well.
---
I didn't gloss over it. If there was only rick click reporting to report gold sellers it's fine. But when you can report anyone for anything and it's triggered by an automated system after only a small handful of reports then it's a problem. Right click reporting for gold sellers that's only put into effect from an actual person rather than a script would be great. As is Blizzard has only had all or nothing. I'd rather have nothing
---
Like i said the video from the WF (i edited my post) still doesnt change the fact that the actual guild has the horde logo next to it and that will be proof to me unless you provide counter proof. Again, i dont know nd im happy to be proven wrong but the source seems reliable since other sites i looked at link to methods site too like icy veines, at least more reliable than a random stranger on the internet.
---
You‚Äôre reposting a completely unoriginal idea that we‚Äôve seen countless times before, why shouldn‚Äôt it be deleted?
---
I mean, it would be kinda funny to see all the powergames ree as their carefully planned vacation days are ruined by a delayed release. 
---
For me it doesn't really matter since I'm in university and the classes this autumn are filled with useless humanities studies that I won't need and don't even have to pass.
---
Yeah, that's kind of the draw. The game is broken, in some glaringly obvious ways, and we just deal with it.
---
A druid tank usually has issues getting RID of rage in a fight. I usually use Swipe to just dump rage when Maul is on CD. But...part of the draw is that there isn't any really wrong way to do it.
---
She is pretty! I would give her a bigger cup, though.
---
I like that she has tattoos. Every time I see Night Elf girl without tattoos my heart gets sad.
---
This has been debated abit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c43elu/10_minutes_of_layering_affecting_gameplay_classic/ervgjvt?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)
---
Ah..thanks.
---
Not saying its balanced but you certainly wont miss out on anything PvE because you play faction X or Y
---
Thanks. 
---
While I'm confused about my deletion still (you say you see why...please tell me what you see because I still don't understand after two moderator explanations) this is not about my post. 
---
When you are deleting 39% of your users' threads there is a problem somewhere. 
---
This is about the second post today that I was replying to being deleted as I hit "submit" and my post being deleted to. All substantive-enough threads that I'm confused by the moderation and hoping to encourage them to have a Discord pow-wow about how aggressively they need to moderate this subreddit.
---
Yeah but is it really okay for the game to have **more** bugs than it did twelve years ago?
---
I hear you. But throwing in a really clunky version of something that was in the game 15 years ago doesnt re-create what it was like. 
---
If they can get it right, and have it feel exactly the same then im all for it. But if not then it was a nice try and id rather it not be in the game.
---
s e l l s  i n  g o l d  f a r m e r
---
If you're not having a hard time killing mobs 1 on 1 and you can find a mage friend to give you free food/water it's not the worst thing in the world to just level with your imp pre-VW talents. The time you save by bursting the mobs down compared to waiting for threat mostly makes up for the time lost sitting and healing.
---
It's been suggested literally since sharding was confirmed during Blizzcon last year.
---
I doubt it, like i said im pretty sure i heard it in one of preaches videos. Im sure blizzard thought about this a long time ago and decided not to do it.
---
Ok so maybe not in vanilla. But they basically connected servers back in mop to help dead servers.
---
Didn't think anyone would have the number of characters. Thanks :)
---
I really want a door like this at home.
---
Or maybe they‚Äôve decided that the 500th incarnation of 
---
&gt;LAYERING BAD, WE SHOULD JUST HAVE 500 SERVERS
---
Isn‚Äôt necessary.
---
5 wpn skill for a tank is pretty huge.   Threat will be much more of a issue than on the pirated servers too.  If I make an alliance warrior, it will be human.
---
Blood elf priestess. Plz be real
---
Adding to the top here. Vanilla wow allowed for hunters to have an "all-in-one" macro for a lot of things. For his QoL if he goes that route you should try to set him up for a few. Hunter's can literally go from 10 - 60 off a single keybind and it's still pretty efficient.
---
I'm up for the challenge too. I like having to prove my own worth.
---
Yes, and CONNECTING isn‚Äôt the same as MERGING.
---
Is there any other way?
---
The 5man ToC rewarded garbage compared to Ulduar.
---
I think this is a great idea, I hope this is the way the ship sails personally. Not only would it eradicate exploiting, but also server population without having to abrubt the immersion of one cohesive world
---
/r/iamverysmart
---
Dude. It‚Äôs just a video game.
---
IT BASICALLY IS! THEY CONNECTED TWO REALMS INTO ONE WORLD. WHAT WOULD YOU CALL THAT?????
---
It's so weird coming to Reddit from Voat and seeing how much the moderators control the discourse.  
---
Shouldn't the community decide what they want to talk about?
---
I think they're aware that the subreddit has rapidly become a bit of a circlejerk.
---
Very surprising in deed.
---
That‚Äôs the problem. They ‚Äúthink‚Äù they are adding something. But they arnt.
---
9999 of those posts are people overreacting or not understanding that layers only increase as the player numbers do.
---
If there is 6000 people fighting over 100 lotus spawns, it's no different to 3000 people fighting over 50, it doesn't affect anything in a meaningful way.
---
Yeah there may be a few turbo nerds on each server who have a lot of it, but so what, people are going to stockpile for future patches regardless.
---
Thanks for this
---
Even with 3/3 Improved Voidwalker it can't hold threat like it can on private servers. This also doesn't make it any tankier or do any more damage, so it's still much weaker than on private servers. You can try and fix this by pouring points into Fel Stamina and Unholy Power but you're still just chasing the dragon. 
---
The general vibe on the classic warlock discord is that drain tanking will be a more effective leveling spec once you hit a high enough level to make the switch.
---
2.4 if you spend talents in feral. I can't remember which off the top of my head though.
---
In before deleted
---
I think I just got a beta invite, it appears in my battle.net launcher and I can download it, but everytime I launch it the same message appears: "No servers are currently available".
---
Is this because my sub is not active or what? :(
---
Get better friends! 
---
Be what your heart desires the most! Except a giraffe, or a basketball, you can't be those.
---
Now do that Night Elf, and lets gank them!
---
Oh I'm aware.
---
Karma whores have no shame.
---
Yeah that makes sense. A gold seller quick report would solve both problems.
---
bruh
---
What happens when you slam two servers together and you have 3 characters on server 1 and ten characters on server 2?
---
The character cap is 10, so what happens to every character above that number?
---
What happens if segment 1 and 2 are super populated but segment 3 is dead? Do you pick a random segment to stick 3 in or do you distribute them evenly?
---
I used to TP through it with my mage back in the days.
---
I always jump into the portal and watch my character stand there for a brief moment before the loading screen pops up. My internet sucks.
---
Can you explain how this model change works and why the /who is relevant?
---
There's a staff called Warden Staff which is essentially the BiS tanking staff until regalia in AQ40. It's a level 40-ish epic world drop so if it drops definitely need on it.
---
I literally tested this on a real environment during the launch of the stress test :/. It worked just fine for me haha.
---
How did you do all this without getting banned..? The last picture in particular.
---
Undead shadow priest, tailoring and alchemy
---
Damn that looks good enough to be used as an official promo for the game. The 90s desktop is a bit of an odd choice though considering all the WoW expansions are also there.
---
Doesn't surprise me. The group picked for beta seems to have been heavily biased towards 'influencers' and other internet leeches. Since they only have loyalty to what they are getting free, and then only when it's new, the population is actually surprisingly robust.
---
I totally agree. I was really looking forward to playing a hunter, but it's just not worth it with all these issues. I'm sure some of these issues will be fixed by launch, but at this point I highly doubt that enough of them will be fixed in time to make a difference. 
---
Now I'm back to square one. Deciding what damn class I wanna play.

---
Bugs/exploits/hotfixes, whatever way you want to frame them.
---
There were plenty of issues with player characters not phasing correctly.
---
The smart ass in me would argue that dks, pals, and hunter TNT were all bugged for a long time into the expansion (people were clear to point out just how imbalanced these things were, yet they weren't addressed prior to launch)
---
Can you level via BGs in classic or was that something that was added later?
---
What utility do Hunters bring to dungeons and raids? I remember a lot of stuff from my playing days (classic to early Cata) but it's all a blur when they were added. 
---
For example, misdirect and freezing trap come to mind.
---
The ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù doesn‚Äôt decide what‚Äôs talked about if you give everyone free reign, the loudest/most obnoxious do.
---
Not even close
---
its the same reason why people put /s after comments on this sub
---
Yeah, id rather no changes than changes but I agree. Suggest invite if anything embodies what mmo grouping should be.
---
I prefer to have games be finished when I get them. However, what we want is largely irrelevant. As a business they need to hit their quarterly numbers, so it's going to get released when they feel it provides the best impact on that.
---
 Would rather it was released when most things were fixed. What worries me the most at the moment is the melee leeway that's in the game. Sounds horrible if you are not going to be able to do stuff like hamstring strafe kiting mobs. Wouldn't have cared as much if I hadn't played on private servers and experienced classic fresh in memory without it. WoW has always had good controls, melee leeway sounds like it would ruin a lot of stuff. Being able to kite mobs is a very important mechanic. Also seems like layering could use some more thought as to how to implement it. Hopefully they have time to fix both things.
---
That was something added later, around patch 4.0 iirc. Some of the quests and miscellanous mobs in AV can give experience, but to level 51-60 just from alterac valley wouldn't be viable xP

A great deal of us in the Beta have done the 1-40 stuff like 30 times already one more time won't kill our interest it's just a refresher. 
---
What I love about this beta is we've gotten to spend some time in a lvl 30 meta where BIS means something completely different than at any point in the game. PvP is completely different at lvl 30 cap and lvl 40 cap than any other time in the game. 
---
It feels like a totally unique experience.
---
Sadly at the 40 cap the beta is quite dead now.
---
Maybe if you're doing raids? But five man's and pvp have more options and I'd disagree on that

Almost 25 here and my shits thin as hell and receding. I used to have the thickest hair out of everyone.

Can someone summarize what battlenet will look like in Classic? If my friend is on a PvE server and I am on a PvP server, can I invite him to a WC run?
---
What are you even talking about dude? The numbers are even. Why does everything have to do with streamers?
---
I may not be the most qualified to answer this as I didn‚Äôt play Druid in Vanilla - but I do plan on playing one in Classic. I plan to level as herb/skinning. At 60 I‚Äôll drop skinning for enchant. 
---
I don‚Äôt think LW is super necessary gear wise, and it doesn‚Äôt make a lot of gold. Herbalism is always useful and druids can farm herbs in travel form.
---
I would like to use this comment as an opportunity to help clarify that this *often* the case with many removed posts. Reported posts/comments will show up automatically in the queue. However, we will get modmail messages with highly reported posts. We get hundreds of posts and thousands of comments a day so we can't cover everything. The community here does a good job of reporting rule breaking content and just because a rule-breaking post is not addressed immediately does not mean that it is never addressed.
---
Paid mods.
---
&gt; We were all noobs and we all traded ideas in chat because there were no 3rd party fan sites.
---
Yeah that is one thing I know we'll never get back, but I'm okay with it. My favorite things to do were socialize with my guildies, farm savory deviate delights, level trade skills, and explore. Plus we were all stoked to be experiencing the world that many people had already grown to love from playing the RTS series. 
---
My biggest boon for classic is that my wife and I used it during college as a way to hang out every night because we were a few hours away from each other back then. We tried playing retail a few years ago and we were just crushed by how different it was. Then a few months later classic was announced. I know its not going to be as special as it was back then but I do have some faith that it'll fill the MMO void in my life for at least a year. I'm actually really excited to see how people socialize under similar conditions compared to a decade ago, its kind of a social experiment in a way.
---
You should take heart in the potential to form a new guild with new friends. Its always sad when a game breaks up a special group like that, but those interactions are ultimately what I believe the majority of people are craving. Plus adding streamers to the mix will give Azeroth a kind of weird social caste, almost like nobility, and I'm eager to see how the younger crowd reacts to playing WoW the way we all did.

no that mage was in range the entire time. the screenshot is a bit skewed because he jumps and gets rooted in air. When you watch the video it is clear that he is in range the entire time.

pulling, kiting, tranq shot are the main ones

At our core we are a group of lifelong gamers dedicated to taking the game seriously while balancing a work and life schedule. A majority of us will be spending the largest part of our free time playing the game and anticipate clearing current content as it becomes available. The core 15 of us or so are in the age range of 28-33 but by no means does that mean you must be in that range. We currently sport about 28 dedicated players.

Red is dead
---
I like this, but you should increase reps as you level up so you progress with your character, so something like:
---
 Each time you die to an NPC: (2\*LVL) pushups, so if you die at 15, no big deal, 30 pushups, but if you die at 50 you're going for 100
---
isn't this essentially APES?

waiting to trinket out of the first KS seemed to throw alot of them off their cycle and i could fear&gt;DoT etc...
---
Personally, I think the "retail bad classic good" threads are a lot more exhausting, not relevant to classic, and don't add to any discussion.
---
But those don't get removed
---
And that would be with succy/fh?
---
everyone sees the "World of Warcraft Classic" on the launcher now, it's the client that was used for the latest stress test
---
Yeah I know, everything in the post was from retail, cant say im looking forward to playing frostbolt simulator but oh well

There has been a law in the works for a while (doubt it will ever pass) that will allow service members to legally drink under the age of 21. That way you can at least drink and get sent overseas to die in a war.

There are probably hundreds of things that werent in vanilla. basically classic is a mutation between real vanilla and BFA. Spell animations are different, mobs are slow, you disconnect when falling through the ground etc... its an abomination. BUT its still the best option we've got i guess. I mean i am never going to play retail wow at this point.
---
Female Human mage. Profs. Enchanting and mining.
---
Alt, male gnome warlock profs herbalism and alchemy
---
Bank alt dwarf warrior. Profs blacksmithing and skinning.
---
Player names?, guild names?, economies, progression, people who got server 1st achievements are now what?... theres a lot of problems with server merges, for you to not be able to think of any of them shows you havent looked into it enough.
---
Incorrect.
---
Thing is, you can't act stupid on a troll post, if that'd be plausible, people could act stupid all the way, i.e.a my post being even more sarcastic.
---
I like the idea of my human warlock originally being a mage who was a bit too curious about the "forbidden" knowledges of magic so he got kicked out of the Kirin Tor and joined the undergound warlock community in the basement of the Slaughtered Lamb tavern.

CS go is ass bro lmao
---
What about after Blizzard nerfs the pummeler?  lol
---
Succubus &gt; Felhunter, because they can function as a mana battery with Dark Pact. The Imp needs mana to do damage, and tends to have mana issues anyway.
---
Stop projecting please.
---
Imagine Nelf males with good attack/cast animations -- a whole new world
---
but why? don't you want the person with faster reflexes to have their ability come out first? i dont get it, pummeling a polymorph but still getting sheeped sounds like a broken interaction, and blinking while getting gouged sounds like bullshit for the mage
---
You‚Äôre a bit late.
---
Yeah the layering absolutely sucked any fun I was having in the beta. Now I'm basically not playing much less playing and submitting bug reports. Since layering drove so many people out the AH is so dead even ore won't sell right now. 
---
I get that they need to heavily test layering, so it's super aggressive, but at this rate they won't have any people testing anything in about 3-4 days. Layering got aggressive as fuck on the patch that went down Jun 10. Since then we've got from roughly 600 online on alliance  6/09 to under 100 this weekend. Killing the beta servers during the AV test also tanked the population 
---
The people in Alpha Beta Fish and MAGA make up basically 90% of the people online on alliance at any given time. How can we test/find bugs in instances if we can't even run them? 
---
I sure hope they don't plan on raising the level cap, because it'll be too late soon for new invitees to manage to hit 60 or even 50 in time unless they nolife it. By this friday I'd expect to see less than 120 people on in total between both factions.
---
Fucking toxic
---
I don‚Äôt think Str increases armor, pretty sure that‚Äôs agi. Str is AP for both iirc.
---
True, true... then maybe really another rogue or druid.
---
You're an idiot.
---
No but a lot of these world drops go unnoticed because people don't know the true power behind them. Every time a private server launches you see some poor unknowing newbie selling edgemaster's for 100g when they actually go for like 1500g.
---
Imagine caring about how a random person plays a video game.
---
Good idea! I like the idea of increased reps per level!
---
Certainly, here's a link to the vod from when I attempted this route at the start of the recent stress test.   
---
 [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/441401757](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/441401757)   
---
The route takes a few more minutes with a ton of people in the starting area, but I'm still able to hit level 6 by 24 or 25 minutes at which point I would have had almost 0 competition for mobs/quests around the bloodhoof area, which actually slows me down later in the video guide, so the total 1-10 time would have been almost identical.
---
I'm cool with this.
---
I'm on the same spot ... I played a hunter in vanilla ... I hyped to play classic ... hunter was my choice ... but now I'm thinking ... damn ! ...
---
Yeah, batching and pet behavior look to be the two issues in which Blizzard's "You think you do but you don't" was actually true.
---
You‚Äôre describing stealthing too close to the view cone of a character. Vanish was supposed to do exactly that: vanish, break focus but not remove from combat.
---
yeah of all the races the Undead are probably the only true evil one
---
Hunters gonna hunter.
---
Thank you! So it wasn‚Äôt just me... I thought it had to be a bug, glad I reported it even though it probably won‚Äôt get fixed before the release.
---
You also could do layering and refine it. Make layers sticky so you always belong to the Layer where you created your char, that way you see your own people. CD on Layer-switches, restrict the conditions on when switches will actually occur. Right now in beta it works exactly like sharding does on retail, hope it doesnt go live like that.
---
btw if there is a possibility of Illidan A B C not getting merged people wont use a transfer i think.
---
We will see how well blizzard will estimate the player retention, and therefore how many players they will allow per server (or how many layers they will be on a given server).
---
Its a difficult balance act. Lets hope their estimates are accurate.
---
I get that It's insanely aggressive for testing purposes, but it completely nuked the beta population. Soon there won't be any people left to test their beta. They're not gonna get a ton of data particularly on instances when there's only 50 people on per faction.
---
I'd recommend checking out [Kargoz Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxOd0DPfBmSpf70PQe5_MBw), he does a pretty good job doing overviews of everything.
---
Shaman and Pally will be used overwhelmingly for heals in PvE. Pally's can potentially tank lower end content, and both can be good in world PvP.
---
Tank, 3 DPS, Healer (Warrior is best Tank, Priest is best healer).
---
Know what race/class you want to play, know what professions you want, know what you want your focus to be (PvP or PvE)

2. MadSeasonShow and Kargoz are who I'd recommend.  
---
I'm not really experienced enough to help on the other points.
---
What does this have to do with spell batching? A 2 second delay for a rebuff to hit is way to long to be a batching issue.
---
I still would rather have layering than wait in queues. Not an issue to me.
---
I only played the stress test but I was very sad that private server hunter and warlock pets are crisp and responsive and just messing around with simple pet controls for a few days in classic was super disappointing.
---
Look at my many leather bound books
---
Ah yep, been too long
---
I think the 5 man speed clears and the pvp meta will go through some changes. 4 arms warriors and a shaman healer is just stupidly good.
---
Samoflange
---
The community will decide what is successful and what isn't.
---
&gt;It gets kind of exhausting when every thread is about the same thing.
---
There'a a setting in your Reddit profile to hide posts you've downvoted.
---
I'm super torn.
---
My main in Classic was a Priest who I did everything with.  By the end I had also levelled an Elemental Shaman but I never really raided or did much with her until TBC.  At that point I also levelled a Feral Druid.  
---
All 3 I would heal with as necessary in TBC and Wraith but the Priest was still my main and almost always heals (I would often have both spec's a healing spec), the Shaman was primarily Elemental DPS and Druid was primarily a tank.  I managed to level a mage and would occasionally play my husbands warrior or hunter in order to get certain quests done when he wasn't around but they never grabbed me.
---
Healing and Horde are the only definites.
---
If I can convince my husband to play we might duo level as warlock/priest which means I will probably end up with the Priest as my main again.  But I will also probably want something to level solo since I tend to play more than him.  From that perspective I prefer levelling as a Druid but I prefer healing (especially endgame) as a Shaman as it is more similar to a priest and you don't have the handicap of only 1 res.  I also found I was a little to skitz to probably pvp as a Druid.  Part of me really wishes I wasn't as Druid pvp looks amazing.
---
During levelling, should a Warrior/Rogue Human focus on getting Swords+Maces or is the +5 Sword+Maces Human racial negligible?
---
OP did.
---
&gt;I recognize Phytoskin Spaulders, The Devilsaur pieces, and Barman Shanker.
---
When you log in and you find that you've lost your dank name to a server merge you're going to fucking *rage.*
---
Holy shit I miss the misc
---
I think wand spec and spirit tap is a must, the rest is not too important. So you should aim for at least 1 respecc. As a heal priest most guilds will want you buddy
---
barrens questing is life
---
Not out of mana and max level for that level. You couldn‚Äôt buy the grimoires for the VW until 16 or 18 so basically they weren‚Äôt available in the stress test due to the level constraints.
---
I think it‚Äôs most likely one of the same pet issues the hunters are having.
---
What timezone is this?
---
For sure! I had a friend who let me play on his very geared mage back in the day and he was "elemental" spec which I think meant you had ice block and blast wave, I was HORRIBLE at the game but he was so decked out I would just run around killing people with pretty much only instant casts. Ahhhh I was real bad.
---
You sir are absolutely correct!
---
The answer to this doesn‚Äôt exist because it depends on gear
---
Do you have a site for guides for hunter, similar to Joana? I'm really impressed by some videos but curious if you have a written guide/ set of macros posted somewhere ?
---
Please dont tell anyone. I need a job to pay for my classic sub.
---
Classic will be using legion client macro format.
---
If you hate them so much, why are you here on a sub about a game they produce?
---
player names are nothing compared to the drawbacks of layering, could easily be solved by limiting names by server group, the rest are all hurt worse by layering. I have thought about it, your points are pedantic at best.
---
Fuck memes
---
In the defense of orc warriors of which I am one, if we don't get the jump we get smashed so it results in a Chihuahua-like aggression lmao
---
Ohh ok lol
---
There's nothing wrong with that but actually you can see one name, FuryXD, that was an Orc female. Screenshot from moments earlier proof: http://imgur.com/gallery/4E6CkY9
---
What‚Äôs layering?
---
We have had sharding/layering megathreads [in the past](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bom0y2/beta_release_date_shardinglayering_megathread/) but unfortunately we only get two stickies so it is not always easy to put another thread up.
---
But if the meme is getting reported a lot then they should be able to.
---
UGHHH, I can‚Äôt decide between these EXACT classes. I‚Äôve played both in Beta (Rogue to 30, Priest to 40 recently) and I still can‚Äôt decide. My gf is going to probably play warlock or priest (if I go rogue). 
---
I can‚Äôt decideeeee...
---
Could you suggest a place were I could find info on that kind of build and play style? I‚Äôd be interested in reading about it.
---
There‚Äôs going to be so many people on a server I won‚Äôt even notice. If I want to see friends I‚Äôll group with them.
---
Its not about getting stupid titles or ratings its about being the best noob u dont even know
---
I think it has something to do with cake
---
I remember when hunter pets could keep target in you through vanishes and take you right out
---
I would like it removed completely
---
Extra screenshot of party: http://imgur.com/gallery/4E6CkY9
---
That's how I remember it as well, this was why the terrain exploits in TBC warsong were so devastating. You could hide yourself on ledges, stumps, or behind walls, and nobody would get an indicator for where you were, even if they knew the common hiding spots they still had to check them one by one.
---
There is no cross server grouping in classic.
---
Honestly, good. I'm sick of every other thread being about "grr layering"  when all I really want to do is feel good about my favorite game coming back in a few months. I think its totally valid to discuss issues and problems with the game, but 50 unique threads per day to talk about each issue is just nauseating and makes me want to not even visit the sub anymore.
---
he main problem with layering is the constant barrage of layering posts, every few minutes.
---
A nice bunch of alpha friends on a beta server, cool
---
It seems from your comment you quit playing shortly after vanilla? I've been playing the whole time. The changes for me have been more subtle than for you perhaps. My brother quit back in MoP and when we see each other and talk about wow, it's like having a conversation with someone who's never played before.
---
I think my biggest issue is I'm an older player. I mean I still remember when the guy at Babbage's recommended Warcraft Orcs and Humans to me. He had it installed on his computer there in the store and I watched him play for about 20 minutes and knew I had to have it. That was my introduction to Azeroth. 
---
The player base now is way more volatile than when I was younger. Quicker to be rude, try to ruin your fun. Dungeons are way different than they were back then. We went from slowly making our way through a heroic, marking targets, cc'ing targets, watching aggro and mana to pulling almost the entire dungeon and getting pissed when someone doesn't do top dps or dies. It's a whole different animal.
---
I still have fun playing the auction house and making gold. Farming pets and mounts, transmog, the occasional battleground, but the group content, dungeons and raids, what made wow so fun, that's changed forever it seems. The elitism is more than I can take. People don't want to be patient with new tanks and healers. Dps can't use the excuse that they're trying a new spec or class, you should be doing top damage no matter what and if you don't then you suck. I see people get kicked all the time for shit reasons and it makes me not want to log in anymore. I haven't tanked or healed since MoP. I don't think I ever will again. 
---
The game is still fun, it's just the people that are killing it for me.
---
&gt;I think it has something to do with cake
---
Yes and no

Nice, always love having the cc bot
---
On the picture its UTC+2, but when on the website, it picks yours.
---
Just spitballing here...but maybe not build 1.12 into legion frame and that wouldnt happen.
---
I don‚Äôt click on links.
---
It only makes a big difference when attacking things 3+ levels above you, so generally not that useful while levelling because 99% of the time you shouldn't be doing that.
---
I hope so. If I can pick up one of these world drops cheap that would be cool
---
They are internet janitors, they do it for free
---
Elwyn, westfall, redridge, deadwoods &lt;3
---
I wish we could layer this subreddit.
---
Google then.
---
This has been posted a million times already.
---
Just /Target and use mind vision.
---
1 million and 1* now
---
This is a lot tougher if you want to raid and also have odd times you are available.
---
I would rather had it a month ago, without changes. But we dont get what we want so ima have to go with release date set already.
---
Top zones for me are Elwynn due to the new character/starter zone feel, STV for the fun times, Duskwood for the spooky things, Winterspring for the refreshing end, Ashenvale for the colorful forest and amazing music, and I love Hillsbrad for that northern forest feel that starts to introduce fun wpvp! I like Tanaris/Ungoro and Feralas as well
---
Have been watching your streams and VODS for a couple weeks now. Great content!  The new addon for time tracking was a great find. Thank you for sharing your great knowledge. :)
---
Tauren Shaman will be my main.
---
Plus a crap ton of alts that I will funnel crafting materials to and a bank/AH mule.
---
Ok but the entire point of this discussion is mods removing posts in a matter of minutes, seconds sometimes. That doesnt happen because of reports, it happens because they dont like the post.
---
Human Warrior. I‚Äôm really going for that high fantasy aesthetic you know?
---
Hogger raids bro. Also shortest walk to a major city is humans to stormwind
---
As much as you people prattle on about garrosh. He was a bloody Idiot. 
---
Now you can blame this on writing , but all the same an idiot
---
Most hunters were shit back in vanilla, Blizzard is just going for authenticity.
---
Aziz vs HW hunter(backpedals) lol
---
Wow didn't expect to see a thread full of wrong reccomendations. Listen man, a little Strength/Agi does nothing for your dmg while leveling as a Druid. You want Stam/Int so you can shift and heal more.
---
Thanks for the response!
---
Nah he‚Äôs pretty well known.  Biggest meme before the meme generation.  Truly ahead of his time.
---
Well.. Technically you can.
---
*laughs in frost mage*
---
"Hurr I hate funny pictures"
---
Go drink your Ensure, gramps.
---
Excellent essay, well-substantiated, I hope Blizz see this.
---
Strongly dislike it, but not as much as I'd dislike heavily underpopulated servers a month or two after launch. I prefer the server cluster idea that's been bounced around, but since blizzard aren't going to do that it seems layering is a necessary evil, let's hope it doesn't last that long.
---
Its an odd zone in classic. Most people don't like it apart from the grinding in the salt flats zone. 
---
I find I have a lot of fun killing the tauren, centaur and everything else even before I touch the flats. 
---
Only thing I hate in this zone are the water elementals. Mages will hate them :P
---
I got my first gold at lvl 18 with my druid in redridge. I was so proud.
---
For Rogues, yes, its a lot harder to make use of Backstab since most often you cant get behind mobs youre fighting, so Swords/Maces are the only things youll ever equip. 
---
For Warriors, unfortunately, most of the best 2Hs you level with are Axes, so no, you dont really prioritize based on weapon skill.
---
You give a handful of people power to delete things they dont like even when it doesnt explicitly violate rules. What could possibly go wrong? Dont worry you'll do the same with a loot council and drop a shocked face when they ninja your shit.
---
I don‚Äôt even know what that is. 
---
But it‚Äôs not that I dislike funny pictures, it‚Äôs that they don‚Äôt (or usually don‚Äôt) provide worthwhile discussion to the sub. Go post epic memes on Facebook some more.
---
Bruh, your post wasn't sarcastic lmao.
---
I read a suggestion on layering but it got removed ???? it was a good idea....
---
Good wording and deduction. Post it to the forums if you haven't already.
---
Nor was his.
---
There's only two hitboxes, tauren and normal. If a tauren that deviates will have a normal hitbox yes.
---
Oprahwindfury. First time i seen that and it is glorious.
---
I always did Westfall, Duskwood, Redridge when I played Alliance and Barrens as Horde so I'm going Dwarf and trying Loch Modan and Wetlands for a fresh experience and to recapture that wonder exploring new places.
---
For end levels I always did Tanaris and UnGoro so I'm trying Ashara and Winterspring this time.
---
NE Druid. Probably alchemy and herbalism. But possibly just herbalism and skinning.  I know I‚Äôll be a healer but I was a tree back in the day and loved it.  I also plan to level each secondary very much except maybe first aid because my first alt will likely be a enchanter/ tailor. 
---
I loved being a tree and I know you aren‚Äôt one in classic. So I want to see what it was like before i played which was BC-Cata.
---
* Badlands
---
* Barrens
---
* Silithus to some extent
---
It may be something with the color pallet there. But I'm planning to also get more things done in EPL/(WPL) for quest gear and some rep as well as rep related Searing Gorge (Thorium Bros) and Timbermaw related Felwood and Winterspring. WPL don't have the best colors but there are nice mage AoE opportunities there. Un'Goro isn't bad either - in terms of quests and visuals, although the crystals cave is the best.
---
&gt; should it be in launch? 
---
Necessary evil. Maybe not necessary but Blizz think it is, so it's happening.
---
&gt; Should it be limited? 
---
Absolutely, and it will be. I hope it'll be gone ASAP.
---
&gt; should it be removed completely? 
---
Out of question (unfortunately).
---
So let‚Äôs stop posting discussions about the same things.
---
For raids, Tranq, TS Aura, Furious Howl, kiting, long pulls, better DPS on certain fights.
---
For Dungeons, mainly; DPS, pet OT, Freezing Trap CC, kiting, self OT.
---
Funny enough, pserver values were off but engine was not. Now that blizzard is going public with the actual values from their 1.12 client, private servers can make those updates and actually have a flawless product likely before blizzard can, lol
---
Haha not quite. But we are planning on remaking this exact combo for release!
---
Then perhaps stop deleting new proposal threads that seem to get. Silencing issues regarding layering while keeping shit meme posts , when release is 2 months away, will do no one any good.
---
Haha i did that with my xbox too. Also when they would take my stuff away during the day I told em I was going to the library to do hw. I‚Äôd just play runescape on their shitty computers
---
Any chance you move forward with the warrior guide past level 10?! That was some good stuff  and I was able to hit level 10 in an hour and 46 mins during the stress test
---
I don‚Äôt know about that chief
---
Do it for him
---
I'm certain you could see the flag carrier in vanilla, but I believe it was at a minute timer.
---
The hell is wrong with you kid?
---
Delete this.
---
The namespace would be shared between all layers, so names would never collide
---
It‚Äôs r/classicwow, what do you think this it?
---
So your reasons are 3 things that arnt even in the game?
---
Me and 95% of this subreddit do

You're absolutely right. We were an unstoppable duo. Thank you!
---
You'll be there day 1 like the rest of us!
---
You'll be there day 1 like the rest of ys!
---
Because leveling along with questing is absolute dogshit gameplay and dungeons/raids/pvp are the only things that matter in this game.
---
(wow look opinions are cool)
---
Let‚Äôs be honest. Hunter pet AI has been broke since legion/bfa and still hasn‚Äôt been fixed. Given this fact I won‚Äôt blindly believe in blizzard. 
---
Hunter‚Äôs being vocal about being broken is warranted. If someone want to make a post for another class being broken and can state facts with data, no one is stoping them. This isn‚Äôt communism. We are allowed to voice our opinions, maybe I‚Äôm being cynical. However with 64 days I will monitor the situation and make my decision accordingly.
---
Did you read the post? The 45 second timer was added in 2.4 which is late TBC.
---
Not really. That's the hot topic. So people are going to discuss it. Let them.
---
Reddit users seem to have this really weird urge to stifle discussion when it grows too large. 
---
Users (fanyboys?): "Everyone is talking about this important thing!" 
---
Mods: "I guess we'll delete threads about it then."
---
It's an insane mindset. If you don't like threads about layering, don't click them. If there are a lot, it's because we want to talk about it.
---
There isn't even a megathread for it, which is also another way to stifle discussion but that's beside the point, so deleting threads about layering is asinine.
---
The mods in this sub are biased as fuck and have ulterior motives apparently.
---
Well, I guess F for you and 95% cause I‚Äôm gonna post what I want.
---
Dope people vs literal nazis
---
This is a bad philosophy. Unmoderated communities are never successful - the sub reddit would be a complete shit show. The fact is that on a large scale, people love low-effort, low-engagement posts and will upvote them more than high effort posts that require discussion and engagement.
---
It would solve the problem and then people wouldn't have nothing to bitch about.
---
Too sad when people leave young, kids steroids are dangerous to your life.
---
Probably lmao. But seriously I'm not about to reroll and settle, I will have a hunter main warrior alt or I will not play at all.
---
Don‚Äôt forget the stupid humans have reputation gain bonus too.
---
Sounds to me like you can‚Äôt be bothered to put the effort in to farm items in the game that are not exploits because you want the easy WotLK experience.
---
Ding ding ding. You know it! Those were the good ol' days.
---
Then enjoy the downvote and the report for spamming the same stuff as everyone else.
---
‚ÄúOh let‚Äôs talk about this thing like it hasn‚Äôt already been discussed to death.‚Äù

Was having lock pet issues on the stress test also.  Similar deal as you. When the pet would return and I hit the pet attack command sometimes the demon would just do nothing
---
Its ok, be with bugs, ill just play other class but hunter, maybe tauren warrior... 13yard melee class
---
That is literally your argument. "what if the economy is ruined and my precious community is split???"
---
I know you don‚Äôt but you want to complain about it so it‚Äôs clear you aren‚Äôt prepared to put in any effort for the minimal experience you‚Äôll have playing feral tank
---
Princess Huhuran in AQ40 is a boss that does tons of raid-wide aoe nature damage. And the whole raid is going to need some nature resist gear for this fight.
---
Doubtful
---
Various blizzard employees have said on several occasions and also implied with other choices that there won‚Äôt be any changes/nerfs to classes or items. So you don‚Äôt need to worry about that shit.
---
Apparently pservers overtuned feral damage as a whole, so you do need to worry about that shit
---
You will never reach Naxx so don't worry about it.
---
If he's with a hunter he won't even need VW.  Might be better off with any other demon, or even demonic sacrifice.
---
For tanking:
---
"Totem of Affliction" is one of the best and early weapons (off-hand), its a must have for me.. This pre-bis is phase 1, parred with "Rubidium Hammer"..
---
Its so good becouse nothing else have armor (besides a gray item)
---
This item gets even better in lvl 40, with dire bear form
---
Reminds me of shadow clan!
---
Desolace, i remember my first time traveling there through stonetalon mountains it felt like a epic journey, i enjoy the grind on the centaurs too.
---
Just because there wasnt an actual achievement system in the game doesnt mean there wasnt server/community knowledge on who did great things such as be the server first lvl 60, or best of each class, or first to get "x" weapon, etc...
---
This speculative question has been asked over and over, check for other posts before you post.
---
Seeing as how Warsong Gulch is my favorite thing about World of Warcraft, thank you so much for putting my thoughts into words. 
---
Really hope they fix this, as it doesn't make sense to be a smart hiding flag carrier when the enemy can see your every move.
---
Every few minutes, largely repeating the same thing. That's not stifling. 
---
But, to each their opinion.
---
It will almost definitely work.
---
I‚Äôm going to assume that the same name locking stuff on retail will be in use on Classic. So once you use a name simply deleting the character won‚Äôt unlock it.
---
If the interest is high enough and people are subbed for Classic only I think they will eventually expand as before. I absolutely adored TBC and Wrath and once Cata hit I lost interested.
---
3 years from now Burning Crusade reboot.
---
No it won‚Äôt, it‚Äôs just another clever use of game mechanics.
---
It only states that there is now a 45 second timer. That doesn't mean that there wasn't one before with a different time.
---
They already rolled out the fix actually, it will arrive during the next batch window
---
Warden staff is better, but costs alot
---
You probably don't need to be too concerned about it really. At 60 a weekend of playing can easily net you 100+ gold if you just do some dungeons and win a boe roll or a righteous orb or something.  
---
So while yes gold is hard to come by in vanilla, 5-10 gold is still a fairly trivial amount to a level 60 and you shouldn't be worried about not burning respecs early.
---
Lmao what?? Dude you‚Äôre being an idiot I‚Äôm sorry. It would be pointless of me to list out all the bugs in this post, because I‚Äôm simply trying to find out if people believe they will be solved. Im not here to educate people on what the bugs are.
---
You predict 100.111 (repeating of course) percentage population?
---
It will not it‚Äôs simply just another clever use of game mechanics
---
You‚Äôre reporting for literally nothing. And your downvote does either as I don‚Äôt really care if I get upvoted or not.
---
You're probably right but still I like a populated world while levelling through the 20's
---
Hot
---
I love playing druid, its the best excuse not to have engi
---
You don't farm sharpening stones
---
What? 49+50 = 99, .888+.222 = 1, 99+1 = 100
---
r/gatekeeping
---
not really
---
I got the staff and never got out of MC, matter fact didnt even get more than 3 pieces of tier 1
---
In my opinion, merely noticing layering is probably the most benign drawback it has.
---
It's when layering has negative, unintended, not readily apparent consequences on gameplay and game balance is when it's at its worst.
---
People will be using it to farm rare stuff in every layer as if they are playig runescape and hopping servers to mine rune ore.
---
Pray for slight buffs to shaman pve offspecs so that we're not forced to heal.
---
I‚Äôm reporting for it being a spam / repost. Seriously, this happens dozens of times an hour, and it just bogs down the sub. This needs to stop
---
1. I don't use social media
---
2. Facebook memes are shit-tier anyway
---
3. There's nothing to talk about right now, we keep getting the same threads everyday. If anything we need more memes. This sub is stale.
---
That's not exactly true though. With respect to wsg jumps like [alliance fence](https://streamable.com/0w6o2) - human and undead females can jump through, other races can clip and jump up/over, and gnomes can't get through regardless in that specific spot. 
---
The issue is the person in the video is an undead female so I'm wondering if a tauren/gnome ate a deviate fish would they be able to jump through. 
---
I realize it's a specific issue but I missed too much of the stress test to figure it out myself.
---
too many people are crying, need just a megathread for a topic
---
Dude, stfu with that bullshit.  It's a straight exploit.   It is unintended for a fucking level 30 blue to be BIS for druids, and therefore an exploit.
---
Alright, since you want a serious answer... They're going to release all the expansions again and do a complete rerun.
---
Always jump so your buddies dont trip you on the other side
---
Well after a quick browse of the subreddit I saw 20 posts with nothing about layering. And nice, enjoy your targeted harassment report
---
Explain him the classes in a way that makes him able to choose in relation to who he is
---
Does it speak to lead, charging at his foes shouting a fierce warcry to rally the loyal troops behind him in a fearless attack - then maybe Warrior
---
Is he intellectual, cunning, and feels the best way to master a situation is on top if it, picking it apart slowly with domination and control and having strong dark magic tricks up his sleeve, then a warlock.
---
Is he swift of thought with trance-like reactions to his surroundings and with the blink of an eye tale control of a situation by freezing his foes and making the look like fools as they twist their ankles trying to reach for you - a powerful mage, cannot be tricked.
---
Does he like to lurk in the shadows, watching his opponent cluelessly go on with their business thinking theyre safe, only to break their will and spirit with a sudden deliverance of death in cold blood, only to quickly disappear in the shadows..
---
Im no writer but get the idea, I mean this is the magic that made the game a wonderous place where you can teleport into a different sense of being that speaks to you. This is also how companies would sell the classes in the game. I think its better than like explaining how warlock has to keep soul shards in his bag and that could be annoying for a kid or that hunters are ez to lvl and that would be good
---
Everyone keeps talking about how hunter pets are broken now and how they were perfect and not bugged in the least in Vanilla and I'm over here scratching my head thinking, "What the fuck are you guys talking about?"
---
Hunter pets were pretty shit for quite a while and as a marksman hunter I never really used my pet, especially in PvP.
---
He doesn't need a source to say specs/items won't be receiving balance changes. Anyone that's followed Classic development for the past 6 months knows that.
---
But they can decide what‚Äôs low effort
---
Can't post it to forums because it has links :( 
---
Is there any way around this? Hard to make the same argument without video evidence.
---
Right but that won‚Äôt have any effect on me or majority of other players. I don‚Äôt care if someone wants to spend hours farming layers for an item.
---
Great, thanks. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you report for something that isn‚Äôt happening ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Aware
---
That isn't a balance change.  It's abolishing an exploit.
---
Same here. Most druid stuff is pretty boilerplate. 0/30/21 can solo lashers and maradon for money when gold farming falls off. With minimal gear they can do a couple brd bosses.
---
When you vanish hunter's mark is removed.
---
Seriously, it gets so old.
---
Ironic because I‚Äôm not spamming either. Lol
---
Perdition's and Core Hound Tooth. Grin and his vids come to mind. Good times.
---
&gt; and the Blizzard guys who decided to sell out to them
---
I've never understood "sellout" as a criticism of someone.  Do you work a job that pays you?  Literally *selling* your time?  Just about every human who has ever lived is a sellout.  Complaining about when authors or artists or game makers do it just reeks of envy.
---
Probably classic TBC if they are feeling lazy or an all new expansion if they are feeling ambitious.
---
Format, yes. Restrictions, not so much. This type of functionality should be doable even if the language behind the script changes.
---
I really remember the flag carrier being able to completely hide themselves.  Once we found him (on the roof, roof ramp, or sometimes even the healing/damage huts) we‚Äôd yell it out for the rest of the team.  This would have been right from launch...i played less as we got closer to TBC.
---
even with overtuned feral damage on pservers, warriors are so incredibly better at tanking, if you're in the position of caring about viability, your whole post was already fucking pointless.
---
uhh... no... sorry to break it to you, but 0.888+0.222 doesnt equal 1...
---
Just think about it for a second.
---
All memes are "low effort". They a few minutes to make tops. How much effort you put into a meme doesnt determine how funny it is. 90% of memes are just a line of text over a picture.
---
bruh 0.888+0.222=1.11
---
Druids raid tank dont need nerfs they already are. Inability to push crit and crushing off the hit table makes them to risky in raids.
---
If they just said Illidan A will be merged with B and C with D, with a possible merger of all 4, people would be more open to the idea later on. Layering doesnt eliminate the possibility of server mergers later on.
---
Yeah I was talking about from a combat perspective. If you mean glitching through gates/secret areas (or fitting through doorways/bridges on a mount) that's different yeah.
---
Honestly the chances of Blizz addressing the pet responsiveness before launch is pretty high. Leeway however is a completely different story and I anticipate it to be in a similar state on launch. Leeway for me was enough of a deterrent to the class and I have since decided on switching  
---
I pray for you hunters come launch
---
I'm curious as to what the refresh rate is for using an ability in World of Warcraft and how it works with monitor refresh rate and latency anyway.  I can definitely notice the difference between latency in an MMORPG like Guild Wars 2, ESO or Rift compared to the WOW Oceanic servers but getting down to 178ms/200+Fps it wasn't as noticeable in the beta compared to BFA.
---
Pros and cons aside (they are pretty even), make sure you are happy with your hero‚Äôs casting animations and how they look in general. Easy to over look that aspect when trying to min/max every detail.
---
Innervate was a resto talent for a long time.
---
Yes, this exactly. That‚Äôs what would happen to me and what I‚Äôve been reading about in the hunter bug list. I‚Äôm guessing the pet problems in general are similar if not the same between warlocks and hunters.
---
true, lol
---
I generally put imbalances in a different basket than actually broken game elements. Classic is probably gonna be different from most launches, where it‚Äôs going to be entirely bugs, and no balance issues, since were static at 1.13.
---
They turned out pretty cool! FTH!
---
If you are refreshing the new page of classic wow every few minutes, you might have a problem lol
---
Posts that nobody wants to talk about will be downvoted and become less visible, posts that are popular will be upvoted and become more visible 
---
That's the way reddit is designed to work
---
Deleting every discussion about layering because its too popular of a topic, while not providing a megathread to funnel discussion into, is insane
---
It's either plain and simple bad modding,  or a more devious attempt to censor discussion that is critical of our corporate overlords, a trend which is heavily documented to happen to many subreddits across this site
---
Keep the downvotes coming guys
---
is this gen or just speculation?
---
Wait, transmog was only introduced in Cata..
---
Some people just dont know how to use TÃ∂hÃ∂oÃ∂tÃ∂tÃ∂bÃ∂oÃ∂tÃ∂ wowhead.
