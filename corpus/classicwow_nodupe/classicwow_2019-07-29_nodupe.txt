It's as true for the rogues who don't get TF as it is for the tanks who don't get TF.

Wish I could give you gold for that comment.
---
Fuck yeah dude this is my life's meta
---
And this post is sick cuz im a rams fan :3
---
Upvoted for the lullz
---
Once the tank and offtank have it, I'm not particularly concerned with one person leaving.
---
The honorbuddy law suit happened because detecting bots is a game of cat and mouse thats unwinnable. WoW tokens became a thing because battling those gold farmers just isn't practical. D3 removed gold and trade because its just not winnable in the traditional stance. There has yet to be an mmo that has dealt with gold buying in a non invasive way. The best tactic I've seen  has been WoW tokens (which have downsides), but gold buying still exists even with tokens due to the sale limitation.
---
Pvp
---
Really pretty easy. Wool is in a bit tight supply since you level through the mobs that drop wool pretty quickly.
---
Also you want stacks of wool, silk, mageweave, and runecloth for the cloth quatermaster quests.
---
But you should get at least most of what you need just through passive play, and then either AH or grind for the rest, but only if you find you've out-leveled the appropriate mobs which won't happen much.
---
You shouldn’t need to buy mats. It levels pretty easy and will give you gear along the way
---
I forget, is Thunderfury usable on Twin Emps?  Or does the proc aggro the neutral bugs?
---
Looks like it's time for you to create the guild with the raiding time frame you would like to see represented
---
What are the cut off dates again?
---
Leveling only with a fully rested xp bar makes for less time spent per level however since you can only earn rested xo when a toon is logged off your irl time to reach cap is greater. 
---
This was an effective and common strategy for active gamers that leveled alts in their off time.
---
A person replied who did the research and cited his sources and you got angry and set I'm not responding instead of citing yours. 
---
You're just a troll who is too stubborn to accept they were wrong.
---
I'm just comparing the two end of tree talents. If you want to add in others, survival loses hard to Trueshot Aura which scales with ALL your crit in addition to your pet. Survival pet dps is pathetically bad.
---
Does it only work whilst stood still? Or is it overall stealth rank increase? I forgot
---
True, they're great at that
---
They didn't mean to do it and returned it to the beta before it finished, it will be there on release.
---
It's a significant gimping.
---
Orc get bonus pet damage, and Trolls get bow specialization and beserking, both of which dominate what Tauren has to offer.
---
On the plus side of the ledger for Tauren you get a stun and more HP, so if you want to PvP then Tauren isn't as bad a choice as if you will be PvE focused.
---
Like... it's a terrible idea go Orc or Troll but you'll be unique and there are some small upsides.
---
No one *ever* hung around in small cliques talking in /s.
---
the worst thing about the male night elf for me is the run animation feels so much worse, can't get over it.
---
Yes.
---
I'll basically focus on one til 60 and then think about if I wanna level something else up. I already know there's no way I can only play one character throughout all of vanilla.
---
Thanks!
---
As a level 40 mage in the beta, I’m rolling Druid first in retail so it’s 1000% accurate but great info! Thank you!
---
Are those modifications there from the start of P1?
---
He also got proved wrong with cited sources and refused to cite anything and I stead said "me and my community are done with this I am not longer responding" lmao.
---
Then MM is even better, because you are giving any melee in your party 1-2 items of AP. And like the commentator above talked about, you can get the talent with MM anyway at the cost of pet dps. MM/BM always wins unless you go for control, then you go intimidation/scatter and have fun with DR.
---
Not to be a dick but wouldn't this be better suited for r/wow? What does this have to do with classic?
---
This isn’t accurate. Even with all consumables in use mana is an issue and on some bosses you don’t have mana for any dps outside of keeping stacks up and mind flay. In that circumstance starshards might have something to offer.
---
I'll be leveling two characters. One when friends are online, another when friends are offline.
---
My vanilla experience was ruined by my boneheaded friend who pressured me to hit 60 as quickly as possible. Terrible experience for a new player.
---
 He also got proved wrong with cited sources and refused to cite anything and instead said "me and my community are done with this I am not longer responding" lmao
---
I hear he does push ups on Mankrik’s wife.
---
The single best thing you can do is watch Joana's unedited leveling runs.  Don't worry so much about his routes, just watch his gameplay.  He will show you how to Classic Hunter.
---
I mean, back in 2006 people just went for tiers, we were scrubs (well, me and my guildmates at least) and had no idea what a bis was. Bosses still died, so I guess it's viable. Still, I'm a bit worried that pugs will be just as demanding as in retail.
---
Idk, somehow t1 and t2 are such a big deal in my memories, I feel like I'd lose something by skipping them.
---
I think it's more that character creation hogs the login server resources, and they'd rather get that zerg rush out of the way.
---
Today I learned better graphics means catering to everyone LOL.
---
So close it's hard to believe it's almost here, what's the latest update on layering/sharding? And when are they released the server list/pre-creation?
---
Looks like she couldn't handle the Chuck.
---
&gt;if I got anything wrong let me know!
---
If you're so sure you could easily have posted your cited sources and ended the *discussion*. Instead you ran away with your bear tail between your legs.
---
Just a heads up, if you are 300 tailoring Bloodvine usually will be better than Robe of Volatile Power. It takes some really big crit items from Naxx before breaking Bloodvine is worth it.
---
I worked at Gamestop when we phased out strategy guides. and when things are meant to be thrown out, they got "penny'd out" boss kept them knowing I would use them
---
I have all the time in the world with just a full time job and no other responsibilities. Still only going to keep a single Lv 60 unless I decide to splurge on a farming alt.
---
you don’t really need to embrace a full ‘raid spec’ until the content becomes actually difficult (which is to say: c’thun and naxxramas), but be prepared to endure some complaining from narrow-minded guildies. 21 resto plus healing gear is sufficient for most of the game’s raid content
---
ele is great for fresh pvp because spell damage is much less gear dependent. you’ll do fine
---
A weapon designed as a tank weapon (deliberately high threat on proc)  
---
A class designed as the main tank  
---
Therefore it's a main tank weapon, aka, warrior weapon.  
---
What part do you disagree with? Also, can you tell me your IGN so I can make sure you don't raid with me?
---
wow tokens are blizzards modern solution to gold farming. You can buy a 20 dollar token directly from blizzard and either redeem it for 30 days game time turn it into blizzard balance which you can use to buy other blizzard games and loot boxes etc or you can sell it on the auction house for a blizzard decided price that fluctuates based on supply and demand.  
---
Basically you buy gold directly from blizzard instead of gold farmers or you're buying the tokens off the AH for gold and using them for game time. It's a decent system has no gold created so there isn't massive inflation that comes from gold farmers botting. The tokens just move the gold around rather than inflating prices.
---
Was this on the bingo cards?
---
Cry me a river you little Murloc tantrum having ass bitch. Wait, let me speak your language "Guahahnffhhdhagagasn" 
---

---
Is there a full list of changes/planned changes? I know they are going to fix some glitches like wall climbing, some blink stuff, and the availability of unarmored mounts. Spell batching is also being tailored to be close to original, but isn’t there yet. I’ve also heard things like “hunters didn’t scale properly” is that a real glitch that they might change or is that still part of the game?
---
I've done the same in the past year. Part of me wishes i would not have tried pserver, but in the other hand i would have been such a noob at classic without it.
---
Actually it was on first week of bwl, so mostly with mc gear, speedrun by progress
---
Top comments are right, but tbh enhance benefits the most from it. Druid? lol. Warriors? Nah, they rarely if ever use 2H weps (except for that occasional 2h fury person) in PvE and as far as I know, prefer an axe/sword for PvP. Enh Shamans? SICK WINDFURY CRITZZZ. It's probably been mentioned but enhance is really bad for Nightfall, as well.

the stats on the items are a big clue as to whether or not they’ll sell on the auction all. str+agi cloth isn’t going to be in high demand for example. also, weapons and shields tend to vendor for higher values than armor pieces.
---
I went on last night to just run around the starting zone getting nostalgia big time. Planning to go priest this time i think, went arms warrior in the long haul in vanilla. Know for a fact everyone will be either rogue or warrior or at least 40% of the server.

The armor dif is gonna play a way bigger role then some extra parry %

---
I'm sure we will have one or 2 but they won't be your Sodapoppin's / TipsOut / Esfand type people so it won't really matter.
---

---
There are no achievements in Classic
---
yes, P1 will have 1.12 talents and itemization.
---
Something makes me think there won't be that many more servers of each type.
---
With Layering and the inevitable huge drop in players ("tourists") within the first few months I don't think there is a need for more than 3 of each type and I think that will be the number we will see in most bigger regions.

True. However, I want to get one for my rogue at some point. I know it won't be for a long time but I don't see why we have to stop running MC just because its on farm or we are in naxx or whatever. People have alts. If I agree to take my main along I don't see why I can't have a chance at TF assuming the tanks already have theirs.
---
&gt;I don't think the spammers are the problem…
---
It's the buyers that are the problem. Apparently Blizz do not permaban anymore.
---
I tried it but found the normal shapeshifter/swiftmend spec far more durable and powerful in pvp, and a better healer in PvE. I guess it depends on how much the ability to tank 5 mans is important for you. I found splitting yourself over pve/pvp healing and feral just too much a pain gear wise as well. Maintaining 3 sets of enchants is not fun, and it takes up huge amounts of bag room.
---
If you're raiding 5 to 6 hours in a single night, you're doing something wrong. We routinely cleared all relevant phases of content in that amount of time *per week*, including the rotating cycle for shortened reset timers for some raids.
---
Planning to, yes. Going to, no.
---
I've basically got everything down except what class I'm going to play. Heavily torn between warlock and mage, and I have no idea which I'll go with.  
---
But, I am extremely hyped nonetheless.
---
&gt; now this is not OG Vanilla mechanics
---
Yes it is.
---
I too pick the dead guys wife
---
It depends on how quickly you level. The biggest issue is not having first aid or cloth for turn ins. As others have said, wool can be difficult to get thru. You could try offering to craft 8s bags for people in crossroads. It’s possible to get some quick skillups that way.
---
If you've ever seen that cringey twitch chat on popular streams, it will be that incarnate as a huge group of people following around their favorite player (and getting in your way).

Some guilds run multiple raid groups and gear does need an admin to divy out.  Not sure how you do things in your raid finder groups though.  You very clearly did not raid and clear mc through naxx in vanilla.

Didn't they said there would not be language specific realms on EU?

&gt;tailor
---
Here is some information on leveling tailoring. The most balanced way to approach leveling professions during leveling is to take it as far as you can in terms of skill points and then collect materials using a bank-alt, preferably just for that profession's mats, or, just collect mats from the beginning and follow up with targeted grinding at another time (i.e. max level with a mount).

**\[EU - Horde - PvP\] Player looking for a cozy home.**  
---
Hello there!  
---
I suppose a bit of background information regarding who I am will probably be pretty beneficial.
---
I'm a way too old Scandinavian, specifically Swede who's been playing this  game since a month after EU launch. I originally played a warlock and rogue back in the day and sunk an extraordinary amount of hours into it. I've done every single raid on heroic/mythic up until Legion and I've always strived to be the best that I can be at whatever I decided  to play, and always put my best foot forwards.
---
I love challenge, I love long and grueling grinds where the more I die,  the more determined I get to down whatever content is giving me a hard time. Though despite that, I'm very easy going. I rarely get riled up,  I'm naturally very calm and logical and I'm always down for a good  laugh, some sick bants or other shenanigans.
---
I've set my sights on playing either a **Mage** or a **Warlock** this time around. I am still a bit undecided as to which I'd prefer.
---
Bit of a tl;dr of what I can offer the guild:
---
* Driven and determined old man that thrives off of challenge.
---
* I've  spent the majority of my online days talking to americans and brits so  I'm pretty well-versed with the bants and I'm always up for a laugh.
---
* I have absolutely awful one-liners and dad jokes and I **will** end up laughing at them.
---
* I  do a LOT of research regarding my class and the content I need to be  doing, as I like to immerse myself fully in what I decided to put my  time into.
---
* I'm very laid back and calm as an individual so you won't hear me tilt beyond the sun on a hard boss.
---
What I preferably want from your guild:
---
* Semi-mature preferably
---
* 2 to 3 raids per week sounds like a good medium to aim at.
---
* Driven to clear all content eventually.
---
* Liking and/or loving Bob Ross. I like them happy little trees so it's a big plus.
---
I'm going to be doing as much PvP and PvE as I can possibly fit into a human solar cycle, if this old man sounds like something you want in  your guild or if you want to discuss something regarding my post or simply get to know me a bit better, feel free drop a comment down below with contact information and/or sketchy links to your guilds, or you can simply PM me or reach me at ShankRage#1528 on discord. That also works.
---
Mind Soothe is a great spell for that. On mobile rn, just Google it.
---
1. Dungeon xp is the same as original vanilla, I’m not sure how you could compare it to joanas run when he never did dungeons.
---
2. Eye of Kilrogg transferring aggro and having actual hp are bugs that got fixed.
---
3. Pally tanks might be okay in a aoe spellcleave comp but they’d likely slow down a melee group significantly.
---
It's because you can't stand upright huh... its ok you can admit it :P
---
I'll leave you a downvote when I get around to it. /s
---
Resisted your mind control. Nice try.
---
I CAN'T DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO GO MAGE OR WARLOCK, AND I HAVE YET TO FIND A GUILD TO CALL A HOME. :(

Making a druid as a main and will limit myself to one alt.
---
I don't think making classic is an admission of failure of retail (which is bad). Nostalgia releases are popular right now (looking forward to spyro but it comes out right after classic), are cheaper to make than a new game, and have an established fan base.
---

---
What is your understanding of the hunter dead zone. Because from my memory there was always an 8-10 space that was extremely exploitable for hunters in vanilla PvP. 
---
Hunters where hard as fuck to play back in vanilla and the few good ones that made it work where heavily respected particularly in PvP.
---

---
As far as I'm aware (someone correct me if I'm wrong) it was never officially changed, different people seem to draw it differently. Either way it's always been basically the same in most mediums.
---
Sorry to hear, man. Thankfully you'll get this second chance to rediscover the game.
---
If you want to be dps, about 400g+ devilsaur set, 800g+ lionheart, epic mount 800-900g to be able to PvP in the upper echelon (warriors with 60% mounts are rarely invited by rankers). For tanking, grand marshal Morris amulet 100g, stockade shoulders 300g, 600+g for dark iron set rag tank. Warrior is VERY expensive. I'm strongly considering going mage first to start aoe grinding cash so I don't have such a brutal farm on the warrior, and still probably level off rested to 20-30 while the mage gets to 60.
---
The fully updated guide is the 1-60. 
---
The sample is a bit older.
---
can you? i tried and it didnt work on pservers
---
I TOLD MYSELF I WAS GOING INTO CLASSIC TO ENJOY THE GAME AND THE JOURNEY. I WAS GOING TO PLAY THE RACE AND SPEC I WANTED. WHY DID I CHOOSE NOW TO START TO CARE ABOUT ENDGAME PVP MIN-MAXING?!?
---
Worked in the beta with a macro.
---
I think there was a blue post where they did say they’d have language specific in Europe
---
Fuck that was funny. Good job OP
---
I have no running subscription, but I was able to select classic from the dropdown and install the client.

There are like 3 jokes I remember. That one, the one that goes like: "A rattlesnake once but chuck norris on the eyeball. After 3 hours of intense pain, the snake died."
---
And one about like jesus and water walking.
---
That’s literally an answer.  How is that no?  Idk maybe because they literally said no?
---
Just keep one bag full of them and you'll be fine. You need less at the lower levels so having less overall stocked up is fine. Have a macro for your soul drain that will delete one if you have a full bag. You can get the first soul bag at level 20 from your succ quest.
---
Yeah no shit you can't just turn up to a raid in shadow spec all of a sudden. You have to make it known that you would prefer shadow spec and the priest CL with then see if you are determined enough to actually pull it off.   
---
If your CL tries to force you to drop your most important talents to buff the warlocks then you can politely decline and stay as disc or holy, or offer to go full shadow dps. If that's not acceptable then honestly it doesn't sound like a good guild. 
---
It's pretty clear that you've never tried raiding as PI/SW. It really fucking sucks and nobody wants to play it.   
---
Your heals are too slow, they are too expensive, they don't heal very much and you'll probably get items last because why give a BiS item to a severely nerfed priest? If the guild actually decides to give you some items there will be big questions asked from the rest of the healer camp. Why when finally after months a Rejuvenation Gem drops does the guild give it to the worst priest in the raid? Just because he's buffing the warlocks? That won't fly in any serious guild and it's bad from a guild investment perspective too.   
---
The gameplay also sucks. You have no chance of landing any Heal or Greater Heal without being sniped so you're reduced to spamming Flash Heal which is ridiculously expensive and you also have to keep up SW on the boss, while having shit gear so you have to spend a shit ton of gold on mana pots and runes. You don't even get Holy Nova which means you can't do any type of solo farming at all. So you're sacrificing your talents, your healing which is not only on the meters but the gameplay as well, and your BiS items to buff the warlocks. It's a horrendous spec and forcing someone to play it is pretty fucking retarded. The PI/SW priest should also be a regular because you always want the warlocks to be buffed. Which means you are forcing one of the high attendance priests, i.e. very valuable member of your guild, to nerf himself for the sake of the warlocks. You think that guy thinks it's fair for him? He turns up every raid but sees items passed to priests with lesser attendance/DKP because he's being forced into a shitty healing spec. I have seen a few of these PI/SW priests and they all skip guilds fairly quickly, nobody wants that shit.
---
Lastly, it's much easier to squeeze in a sub-par dps than a sub-par healer. You don't have many healers and consequently they are much higher valued than the dps. You'll notice 10% of your healers being trash a lot more than 4% of your dps being trash.
---
I didn't fall in love with paladins until BC when I could actually tank.
---
nope wow is like riding a bike for me.
---
What finally made my decision for what class to play was my current knowledge and skill. When I played Vanilla, I was 10. I had no idea what I was doing. I didn’t know anything about rotation or what talents to use. I’m playing Classic for the nostalgia sure, but I always want to play my class with the knowledge and skills I’ve gained since then.
---
Ah, so the glasses aren't helping...
---
Freewind Post
---
But why male models?
---
Yes, that's generally what people say. This assumes you've got the inspiration 25% armor buff and maybe that your using the 450 armor elixer and 2k armor potion. Frequently when people are taking less points or not taking it they're trying to fit in more cat talents.
---
Yeah for the 40 people who get to raid, I can imagine it being pretty annoyed to be benched because your guildies are joining another guild's raid. But idk, I've never actually been in that situation.
---
What if you guys have different, subjective opinions on what constitutes a "cool" name?
---
Hunter is fine.
---
Melee Leeway always existed as it is now.
---
Warriors were alway able to charge over traps.
---
DR existed between Wyvern/Trap/Scatter Shot in 1.12
---
Pet responsiveness was always that bad.
---
Classic is classic, Hunters are how they were.
---
They talked about a few weeks or months ago. They're not going to offer them.
---
Na they are pretty decent except on fights like Patchwerk. They also don't really share loot with anyone else.
---
There will be guilds that allow for less optimal specs. You clearly won't participate in them, but you really don't have any authority to speak on behalf of "everyone" like you so clearly seem you can.
---
*audible shrug*
---
TP was added to address a problem with late game levelling; items like PB were added for a very different reason- to help people progress through lower tier content quicker to get to the current stuff, and to encourage guilds to still run the lower tier raids.  
---
  
---
It makes sense to put TP in, but hold back items like PB until the content is where it was when it was added originally.
---

---
What's wrong with someone rushing to 60 if that's how they want to play the game?
---
Maelstrom card? Musta spent a fair bit on that.
---
Sure. Like I'm not excluding that at all. But the Thunderfury's that matter are the first two which for sure on tanks. After that it's whatever. Give it to a Paladin.
---
But I was mostly focusing on making sure the general public (all 12 people who read the thread) knew the situation, and that a dps has zero place in the conversation for Thunderfury unless you've got 2+ already.
---
lol so you couldn't cut 1-19 out of the updated guide and just use the up to date one? That's a bad way to market your product

This wins

they won’t

There is nothing preventing an imbalance nor any way to predict which side will have more.
---
40 Pallys vs 40 shamans on RP- Scarlet Crusade US.

---
The running of the gnomes actually originated on Scarlet Crusade as well.
---
Six years ago, I texted this total hottie and asked her out to dinner and a movie. Still waiting on her answer, tho.
---
lol what happens when someone prefers bands like Arch Enemy?
---
I saw a post the other saying saying something sells for 4s instead of 45s. It’s a very common white or gray item that you vendor. 
---
It really hurts the run’s profits.
---
But again the choice is either some people raid or nobody raids.  If leadership can express it in those terms no reasonable person should be upset.  The goal should be to raid with your membership alone, but partnering with another guild is a great way to get your members some content they wouldn't be able to do.
---
Some of this crew worked with me at Circuit City in Muncie, IN. It was HILARIOUS at the time. Scatman for life
---
I suppose that's true.
---
I'm not sure of your tanking experience, but in 5 mans you rarely need or use taunt, especially if you're group is good and can focus target.
---
The regret will start creeping in when you see other classes do what you do - except much better.
---
I legit thought it was appliqué and that you'd actually burned it at the bottom a bit! Well, you got the image very well! I was thinking of making something like this for work; my coworker across from me is Horde and I'm Alliance... It'd be fun! ;P How long did it take you?
---
Oh that's cool WoW can be a platform for people to grieve as I'm sure many couldn't make an IRL funeral or be invited anyway but they should have expected griefers.
---
If you want to be efficient you should rotate between alts so that you are always playing on a toon with rested state!
---
If you just want the alt for crafting professions they don't need more than level 35!
---
Funny enough one my mains during vanilla was sedated on thorium brotherhood. But not a fan of that name anymore.
---
You can't just say, "I've done the research", in all manner of things that's not how it works. The way you're behaving to me seems indicative of missing some kind of basic sense of awareness. Do you live in your own private reality bubble?
---
if my gf did that i would fuck her till she screams tbh..
---
Probably... Four hours total?
---
Ya BFA isn't WoW imo either.
---
Hey, that's not bad at all! Maybe I'll give a go at it sometime. I like the way you went about it a lot. :D
---
Must suck to fall from grace - I never got to "grace" anyway so there is nowhere for me to fall. Going in cold turkey - not even going to bother with guides.
---
His response to me seems to show a lot of self awareness, probably trolling. Darwin wins either way.
---
PvE and RP will be heavily favored in alliance
---
PvP will be more even, with slight variance server to server.
---
Both will be in demand, but shamans slightly higher. Just play what you will enjoy the most, if you are dedicatedyou will get a raid spot regardless.
---
Alexensual is going horde?
---
Haha beautiful 😁
---
Watch Kargoz he did tons of testing in beta, and he compared it to other speed running dungeon vids.
---
Everyone always says this but I lack feeling in some of my fingers, so unless those buttons are textured the way placement of the home row key is on a keyboard, I think I could use at max mayyybe four buttons on the side. I like the idea of the round panel (less buttons) but the placement is horrific.
---
Someday I might give it a go but I can't justify the cost of a thing like that when I'm not 100% confident it'll fit my hand and I can actually feel the buttons. Someday I'll have to hit up a like best buy or something and try one maybe? Do they still have that there?
---
Priest is easier on a fresh server.
---
Rogue is super easy on an older server.
---
Rogue can be easier on a fresh server if you're very lucky with your item drops.
---
Ultimately it still comes down to player skill and having a good route.
---
Dude same story except ele sham right before and through bc. 
---
Strongly considering going warrior again though.... or right back to ele?
---
Thank you!

Apparently honesty is *not* always the best policy
---
You will find friends to play with when you play the game. 
---
I know a lot of people are doing a lot of pre planning (forming guilds beforehand and preparing) but it’s really not necessary. 
---
When you go out there whatever server you are on you will make friends before you even leave the starting zone. And you will continue to find friends throughout your whole journey.
---
I'm still kind of torn. On one hand, I'd rather not spend the time playing to level multiple alts. On the other, I really want a holy paladin, too. And a hunter. And—
---
But I may just roll a mage for the conveniences they offer, and try not to get sucked into Classic too hard. I've got a lot of other more deeply personal projects to work on at the same time, so divvying up time means I'd be way better off if I only level and play one character (with maybe a bank alt).
---
Unfortunately there are still items in at phase 1 that because of 1.12 item stats will be almost as ridiculous as the turban. This progressive/non-progressive itemization is just as confusing as what pservers did.
---
I used to hang out around there too since the Hydraxian warlord guy was sorta close. (vanilla mage) \[ [https://i.imgur.com/p9gMLlq.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/p9gMLlq.jpg) \]
---
Hunters were overpowered on pservers for various reasons. They were always supposed to be the noob class and they're back where they belong.
---
See I actually thought that's what it would be, but I didn't see it on there.
---
Now he can ride into battle with his drapes. 😆 Kidding aside it looks very cool.
---
Man bad company 2 doesn't feel like it came out that long ago. Now I feel old.
---
Yeah but 7 of their guild will, which like I said is better than nothing.
---
If you can access a friend’s healer to multibox your farm potential skyrockets. With heals to top you off on lifetaps you become the fastest farming duo in the game.
---
only works on humanoids. so 98% pointless in maraudon
---
T1 is like the best tier set for pvp out there. The team alone carries you. The lock spell mechanics are good enough on their own.
---
That's an Prc banner, the horde one is more angular iirc. Nice work though
---
Honestly I think that Rank 14 is insane and should be one of the few things that get changed. 
---
Why have an armor set that'll be outdated after BWL and weapons that only .003% of a servers population get to wield. That less than probably 10 people per faction.
---
Missed that. Damn. Lost opportunity for sure. I bet they'd retain a lot more old players if they brought back original servers.
---
forced toggle/cast via !
---
/cast !Eagle Eye
---
Share your wisdom
---
Rank 10 and raid weapons for me kthxbai.
---
People hate on pservers a lot but it happens even on pservers. Actually, I like to think pserver players have preserved the community feel of vanilla. There's gonna be a lot of retail players with a retail mindset. We can't let them change our community. I made a friend in the night elf starting area and we quested all the way through the night elf starting zone. We remained friends all the way to 60 and when he eventually made a raiding guild I was able to raid no problem. All because I made a friend in the first 5 minutes.
---
Well they did announce the time and location for the in game funeral on the forums so . . .
---
not really all that reset was raid lockouts and pop ranks where awarded I think
---
I've heard plenty of hunters meme about survival in Naxx but never have I seen one ever lol.
---
Did he drop any good loot?
---
Illidan is not prepared for Chuck Norris
---
It's like riding a bike... itll come back before you know it. Also, Retail and Vanilla really aren't comparable. Those skills will come back a lot faster in classic.
---
I agree but I know that my original server was garbage and everyone there also new it was garbage and that we were to garbage to spend the time trolling or pay For a transfer .
---
Obviously I exaggerate, onyxia had some cool people, 1 or 2 that I would love to connect with again. I want to repay that one guy who straight up gave me like 5k or some shit Haha.

Not quite .003% in total. Every 3 months slots for bracket 1 will open for a new round of players and not every person with a Bracket 1 spot will need it for the 3 months since they’ll stop at 13.
---
Not everyone should be capable of getting such a grandiose title and weapon, it’s what makes the challenge so worth it. Certainly not for the faint of heart, or employed.
---
You don't need to buy retail to play Classic.

and last but not least. From patch 1.10 onwards Traps shared DR in vanilla . So traps lasting longer than 10-13 seconds after a scatter shot were simply not a thing after that patch anymore. Examples are the video above or Vurtne 2 whereby it's also showcased in 1.10 footage
---
2.0.1 removed the shared DR between traps and scatter - That is correct - But it also added the capped 12 second duration on PvP CC. So it didn't matter. Traps still only lasted 12 seconds regardless whether you had clever traps or not.
---
Just one of the many many - countless - examples of crime servers being a burning pile of ....
---
Keep convincing yourself your “class officer” status means literally anything besides being a socially awk dweeb on a 15 year old insanely easy game.
---
We’ll see who downs Rag first m8, I’ll have a screenshot for you with a special message in game... in under 10 days from launch, just like I did on Northdale.
---
That's not what they said. It was that only PVP, PVE, and RP are planned for launch and when asked about RP-PVP they said no plans for launch but are happy to talk about it after.
---
Nelf warrior, for the synergy!
---
IT'S FUNNY HOW COMMENTS THAT AREN'T IN ALL CAPS STAND OUT HERE
---
This was always my favourite spot too. I always felt kind of bad but not enough to stop doing it. It's just too damn satisfying, lol
---
Funny and sad.
---
&gt;  it’s what makes the challenge so worth it.
---
its not much of a "challenge" considering blizzard have quite the reputation for not banning account sharers both back then and now
---
Not enough tearing. What is this, the ALLIANCE? The edges should be shredded as it appears to have seen BATTLE!!!
---
I do think it'll be difficult to find a pug group that is willing to run dungeons constantly for many hours in a row. That's why it's smart to find your group before launch.  
---
On that note, if anyone on NA PVP Horde is looking to do hardcore melee cleave dungeon grinding on launch, send me a message here or on discord Morph#4209. We're running two groups of 5, with group 1 going 24 hours then 16/8 until we hit 60. Group 2 hours are undecided atm.
---
Unlike wow expansions you don't need to spend $40 to try classic. The barrier for entry is much lower and the game runs on literally a toaster. If you want to play retail you need atleast a decent PC. Vanilla was once the biggest game on the market and word of mouth spreads quick. Completely anecdotal but I've had various people who no longer play or are interested in anything Warcraft question me about classic and I'm sure it's happening in other social circles. Plus the classic beta had more viewers than the mythic Azshara world first race. At the very least launch day will have nearly as many players as your typical wow expansion launch.
---
The regret will start creeping in when you realize that your habit of never reading a full comment before you start typing how wrong someone is made you completely woosh over the image of a male tauren dancing for tips in Stormwind.
---
Rank 10 with raiding gear is my goal. Warlocks T1/T2 are basically pvp pieces anyways.
---
It’s nigh impossible to prove account sharing... even still in phase 3 that won’t help you at all... it’s your ability to join a group of dedicated rankers and execute your specific tasks.
---
While it's true that it will take you a long time to ever reach a state of BiS, it's also true that there's going to come a point where your character cannot get better gear outside of a raid. At that point you can do other things still, but playing an alt won't be taking away from progressing your main (unless you are trying to get high honor ranks then RIP all your time and life).
---
i.e. by finding 4 people willing to put up with extra mana breaks and slower kills/stricter threat control
---
I get you 100%, the way it is now if someone is willing to play longer, sleep less and politic more they win. Capitalism at it’s best. Work harder get the thing. Merica.
---
I'm looking for something to kill a couple hours a few nights a week, maybe binge on a bit on a lazy weekend day.  Not looking for a 2nd job.
---
Yo when that rogue opened up on the person In the front that was doing that sermon or paying respects or whatever I dropped my balls I laughed so hard.  XD
---
You should rough up the sides a bit
---
I joined a semi PUG on my hunter, hadn't had time to find a raiding guild and the guild I ran with hadn't even filled all their raid spots with guildies yet because people hadn't even hit 60. I recorded the run because I KNEW if somebody fucked up they would try to blame it on their PUGs and OFC the first person to get blamed is the hunter. It's always the hunter who gets the blame.
---
https://youtu.be/nV4QMrdYnu4?t=102
---
Pretty self explanatory what happens next. People complain about hunter life because it really is a shit experience. I am not a thick skinned person and honest to god I am so glad I stopped playing that class because the non stop remarks about huntards fucking everything up and low DPS got old so fucking fast.
---
Except a frost mage, apparently.
---
Make it 3
---
Now he has to put a banner he doesn't actually like because he values your happiness more than the horde itself. Thats why I had to make a choice between having a family fourteen years ago and self-castrating my dick for the horde.
---
Does he demand that his guild give him HoR too?
---
Yeah 3 is good in case any fucky shit happens.
---
A while back in an interview, Blizzard said that players reformed more when they were temp banned instead of permabanned. Players that were permed just bought a new account to repeat the offense.
---
PvP server with cool name. RPPvP auto choice, if there is one, otherwise whatever floats my boat upon server selection
---
Lol ok now you’re just not reading. Why would you check old major cities but then when I said check the new ones you said that doesn’t matter because people shouldn’t be in the same 1 or two spots?
---
You do realize this whole thing is about people hanging out in one spot. Ironforge. You get this right??
---
Huh, I didn't even know shield slam did that in vanilla! Nifty.
---
Supposedly it's sm/ruin best all around.
---
You can't use dots in raids so a lot of people will go DS / ruin, besides the designated imp person who goes SM / ruin.
---
Can confirm, I met likable people in just a day on the stress test.
---
we speak English in Australia...
---
Video can mean many things to many people, and I think having a heartfelt get together for another player and friend is respectable and kind. I wouldn't have done this.
---
But, video games are many things for many people, and if you're playing on a PvP server... Expect PvP. This is fucking hilarious, and a great way to start some shit. Come on, you really think if you announced a funeral to the warring faction in any time throughout history, this couldn't have possibly happened? They played the villain and it's amazing.
---
Yep, it is very easy to find friends in WoW when you are leveling. Should be even more easier in classic because of the lack of cross server shenanigans.
---
For priests, wands do more damage than spells at early levels. Lmw is better than the first quests wand. It's only replaced about level 15-18ish.
---
If you think about it, only warlocks, shamans and hunters don't have a way to mitigate falling damage.
---
That's an issue though. They continued to expand the distance between new characters and end-game to the point even HAVING a leveling system is pointless.
---
"My wife doesn't even play WoW but made this horde cake to celebrate classic's launch.
---
\*I roll my eyes so hard that they fall out my head\*
---
This is the kind of guild I want to be in.
---
\*slow clap\*
---
I finally just locked in my choice of Horde Priest, now to avoid videos telling me how good other classes are.
---
Race on the other hand... Troll for unique, Undead for Min/max
---
I mean, it's really one of the most memorable things to happen in *any* video game in all time.. that's really saying something.  In fact nearly all of the most memorable WoW moments happened in vanilla.. wonder why that is?
---
Man...someone needs to get that guy a thesaurus.
---
surprised no one has said STV arena yet.  if you duel near it, you can MC and throw them in.  
---
dick move but funny
---
I was planning on going for whichever rank gave you access to the sweet mount (rank 11? Rank 12?) but after reading up and finally fully understanding how the honor system in classic will work I realise that's a pipe dream for me.
---
You're utterly insane in my opinion for shooting for rank 14 and I wish you the best of luck! What class will you be playing?
---
&gt;  BURYING THEIR HEADS SIX FEET UP VAN CLEEF'S ASS FOR HOURS ON END
---
I HEAR VAN CLEEF PAYS BIG FOR THAT.
---
Is the intention of the spell to use enslave demon on it after you summon it?   Planning on playing a lock and I was reading about farming by enslaving elite demons
---
shammy have worse HPS but great reaid utility. Another downside is that you have to be a filthy Horde
---
Priests have great healing, second only to pallys, but not as much utility outside of MC and dispells
---
Yes
---
Cheers for quick amswer, will jump into the discord to evolve even further
---
DS/Ruin is top dps but very poor in PvP  
---
SM/Ruin is good all round spec    
---
SL is a duelling spec    
---
Conflag is a viable pvp spec with good gear
---
You act like that’s a bad thing. You ever play a game for 15 years? A game that’s always changing and is still changing so much that they have to make a whole new game? How is that bad?
---
Completely disagree. I would never want to be on a steamer's server and I think it breeds toxicity in a community to have a big central figure.
---
That big central figure brings in lots of active players.
---
It really is the only way to 100% make sure you are picking an active server. Otherwise its a crap shoot.
---
I'm a paladin.
---
Aaaand I'm a paladin.
---
The leveling resources and the FAQ channels just contain a bunch of links. Super helpful
---
Those will be your best friend. not to be rude, but what you're asking has been discussed like so much on these various mediums that people will get annoyed if you ask again. Following the links will probably be the best use of your time.
---
That's my entire point however, shadowpriest is so laughably poor in regards to DPS compared to any of the pure DPS classes that taking one is far from a good idea.
---
Secondly, I'd argue a fair bit that anyone who's "extremely skilled, knowledgeable, communicative and consistently dependable raider" isn't someone who'd try to strong-arm you into letting his shadowpriest into raids.
---
That's the type of guy who'd roll PI/shadowweaving.
---
SORRY MY FRIEND, I AM EUROPEAN BASED.
---
But Mankrik is alive. It's his wife that is dead...
---
Yeah, I am saving this post to bust out the jokes contained herein when I hit the barrens next month.
---
Yeah that was my mistake. There was some doubt, but I’m sticking with Tauren Hunter.
---
Commenting to save for later, thanks!
---
The ranks are out of reach for anyone who doesn't dedicate their lives to it.  Even back at vanilla I already had mostly better gear than what could be gained in the rank systems when it was released.  I of course liked the weapons and started to grind towards them without realizing deranking was even possible.  The day I deranked was dissapointing and soon learned I would never be able to play enough.  I stopped caring shortly after, and the PvP wasn't half as good as DAoC anyway.
---
Darkspear was also cordially known and referred to as "Dramaspear".
---
Well to be fair, a lot of guilds are going to give prio to the one or two enhancement shamans in the raid since warriors have better options (like 1handers for fury or Bonereavers Edge for 2h fury). 
---
If an enhance shaman is dedicated enough that they're willing to level BS/hammersmith to 300 to get the recipe, as well as farm for most of the mats themselves to craft a sulfuron hammer (with a little help from their guild as far as ingots and fiery cores are concerned), I don't see what the big deal is.
---
50% chance to remove a beneficial enemy spell.
---
I have played as a PI/SW priest, and I've also played as a resto/Imp. Weapon Totems shaman. I guess having the mentality of wanting your raid to be as successful as it can possibly be and realizing the value of the position I hold is something most people don't have.
---
If you have the mentality of solely wanting to play a specific way and outright refuse to do anything that the guild might require of you then I'm not sure what to tell you other than have fun trying to find a guild with that mentality.
---
Chuck Norris once challenged Lance Armstrong in a " Who has more testicles?" contest. Chuck Norris won by 5. 
---
I think I agree with you. A lot of points people make can be twisted to benefit both arguments. I think everyone should just pick a server, and if you happen to be on the same server as a super popular streamer, though titties.
---
Having a guild that solely stacks boomkins, ele shamans and resto druids is a bit counterintuitive to the word "competent" which I specifically used in my original post.
---
full, go to tich
---
Observant question! This will become more clear as we approach the launch date.
---
 **\[EU - Horde - PvP\] Player looking for a cozy home.**  
---
I'm  a way too old Scandinavian, specifically Swede who's been playing this   game since a month after EU launch. I originally played a warlock and  rogue back in the day and sunk an extraordinary amount of hours into it.  I've done every single raid on heroic/mythic up until Legion and I've  always strived to be the best that I can be at whatever I decided  to  play, and always put my best foot forwards.
---
I  love challenge, I love long and grueling grinds where the more I die,   the more determined I get to down whatever content is giving me a hard  time. Though despite that, I'm very easy going. I rarely get riled up,   I'm naturally very calm and logical and I'm always down for a good   laugh, some sick bants or other shenanigans.
---
* I've   spent the majority of my online days talking to americans and brits so   I'm pretty well-versed with the bants and I'm always up for a laugh.
---
* I   do a LOT of research regarding my class and the content I need to be   doing, as I like to immerse myself fully in what I decided to put my   time into.
---
I'm  going to be doing as much PvP and PvE as I can possibly fit into a  human solar cycle, if this old man sounds like something you want in   your guild or if you want to discuss something regarding my post or  simply get to know me a bit better, feel free drop a comment down below  with contact information and/or sketchy links to your guilds, or you can  simply PM me or reach me at ShankRage#1528 on discord. That also works.
---
Yeah. I think the issue is that every guild has its down identity. X person is our raid leader, we use DKP, we raid every Tuesday and Thursday, etc.
---
When you merge you’re pretty much screwing with everything and people start to quit. I always vote to stay separate but work closely together.
---
Shit like this makes me glad I'm not playing Horde
---
Password is definitely: Gnomelover69
---
Joana and Zygor are both releasing alliance guides.
---
think that's why he capitalized "Blizzard"
---
but yes
---
For horde, priests are definitely "the healer", druids and shamans pack a ton of utilities.  On alliance, paladins pack a bunch of utility and can easily rival priests as "the healer".
---
@ 1, i always liked the hunter version of this where you tame a beast in the opponent's starting zone and then hide behind a rock or something and eyes of the beast, and put your pet amongst the actual mobs of that type.
---
I LOVE CLASSIC, I WILL DITCH RETAIL TO PLAY IT, BUT I REALLY HATE HOW THIS COMMUNITY IS SO MISINFORMED ABOUT RETAIL. IT HAS PROBLEMS, SO MANY PROBLEMS. BUT WHEN YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT HOW EASY ENDGAME IS DESPITE HOW MYTHIC IS FLIPPING DIFFICULT AS BALLS IT GETS ON MY NERVES AND I CANT COMPLAIN WITHOUT EATING DOWNVOTES BECAUSE "HE OBVIOUSLY DIDNT MEAN MYTHIC, THATS OPTIONAL" YEA WELL HITTING THE INSTALL BUTTON ON BATTLE.NET IS OPTIONAL
---
YES FLYING SUCKS, BUT STOP YELLING AT BLIZZARD, THEY REALLY TRIED TO GET RID OF IT AND HOLY MOTHER OF GNOMES THE COMMUNITY WOULD NOT SHUT THE FUDGE UP UNTIL THEY PUT FLYING IN DRAENOR, THEN THEY WOULDNT SHUT UP ABOUT HOW IT SUCKS THAT THEY PAID SO MUCH MONEY TO HAVE TO WAIT SO LONG TO FLY. I THINK THE CURRENT PATHFINDER SYSTEM IS THE PERFECT MIDDLE GROUND AND PEOPLE STILL WONT SHUT UP AND HAVE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT BEING GROUNDED, AND THEN COMPLAIN THAT THEY HAVE TO WORK TO FLY

CLASSIC WONT BE FOR EVERYONE, STOP THINKING THAT EVERY SINGLE SOUL AND THEIR GRANDMA IS GONNA LOVE IT, I BET ALL OF THOSE GRANDMAS ARE THE ONES THAT COMPLAIN ABOUT HAVING TO JUMP OVER TREE ROOTS INSTEAD OF FLYING OVER THEM
---
EVERY TIME I SEE A POST WITH A NEW MODEL MALE NIGHT ELF I KNOW THERE WILL BE COMMENTS ABOUT HOW UGLY HE IS. I AGREE. BUT STOP SAYING EVERY NEW MODEL SUCKS, MY NEW FEMALE GNOME IS CUTER THAN YOU WILL EVER BE. AND I KNOW NIGHTBORNE NEVER HAD AN OLD MODEL BUT I LOVE MY NIGHTBORNE AND I WILL FITE U OVER IT
---
RETAIL IS ANNOYINGLY FILLED WITH INSTANT GRATIFICATION AND JUNK BUT I STILL HAD TO WORK TO OBTAIN 427 ITEM LEVEL WITH GOOD STAT WEIGHTS, IM STILL WORKING ON REDUCING MY HASTE AND UPPING MY VERSATILITY. YES TITANFORGING SERIOUSLY MESSES WITH EVERYTHING AND I WISH IT WAS GONE, BUT THE FACT IS 99% OF PEOPLE ARENT WALKING AROUND WITH MORE THAN 1, IF EVEN 1, LARGELY TITANFORGED ITEM. THE LAST TIME I SAW SOMEONE WITH FULL TITANFORGED ARMOR WAS THE LEGION PREPATCH EVENT, THAT GUY WAS THE LUCKIEST BEING IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE, IT DOES NOT COMMONLY HAPPEN
---
I ALSO HATE HOW AUTOCORRECT BARELY FUNCTIONS WITH CAPSLOCK ON DESPITE MY TABLET BEING NEWER THAN A GNAT STRAIGHT OUT OF THE EGGSACK
---
BRING ON THE DOWNVOTES YOU ANGRY LOK'TURDS
---
Didnt they remove it
---
I think you raise an interesting point about 'repeatable content'. 
---
Any PVE in WoW is doing the same thing over and over.  The progression system is what varies.  IOQ allowed you to get a guaranteed reward based on (x) contribution which is vastly preferable to any non-raiding player who rarely or ever goes into (at the time) 10/25 man content.  TBC also did that in general with lots of top-tier rep rewards of the heroic faction reps or other grindable world factions like sporregar. 
---
Classic doesn't have as much guarantee- other than PVP rewards or grinding out a ton of gold/profession mats for a top-tier BOE off the auction house.  
---
I think that system of allowing a casual player base viable access to end-game (or at least close to it) quality gear was a big plus for WoW overall in the TBC era.  Not a popular opinion here though =)

Aaah the days of minstrel’s leading you to glory in realm ranking!
---
Damage dealer and if you want to heal, then play as a priest. The priest can heal pretty damn well while being undergeared, so you can make up the difference by playing that class.
---
You need to remember that you are older now and can control your life to an extent (better than at 16). If raiding means a lot to you, I’d have that discussion with your SO. I’ve already told mine that I’ll probably be raiding one night a week and will need to jump on early and play a little late. I’ll more than make up for it on non-raiding nights.
---
lol really you gotta bring this faction bullshit into it?  do alliance touch kids and kick dogs too?
---
mage and rogue is pretty close representation-wise, you can check censuses of the last few vanilla servers, but warrior will be the most common yes
---
Not for Classic because it isn't out yet so it might be different, but streamers usually get priority by the games company. I have seen streamers get people banned, I have seen streamers not get banned for things, and the company usually prioritizes anything that happens to them over normal players. Streamers are advertising the games so the company tries to keep them playing more than normal players, even at the cost of normal players.
---
The large populations warp servers. The economy can shift instantly at streamers mentioning something because of the hundreds of in-game investors and people who want to aid or hurt the streamers. For example, if a major streamer says they need a pristine black diamond, you can bet the AH will be sold out with people trying to trade him one, mail him one, or people profiting off people trying to help the streamer. So if you needed one in the next few days, good luck, they shot up to 300g.
---
Everything gets handed to streamers. The only people on the server that will have better gear are the people that are clearing MC week 1. Gold, mounts, gear, runs, quests items, everything will be handed to the popular streamers. Add on top of that they get to play the game as a job and you probably won't be able to put as much game time into Classic as they are. AQ opening is probably impossible for people outside of the streamers groups.
---
Good luck with the fanbase/anti-fanbase, just one example in Runescape is one of the streamers being followed by random people in white robes and you can only guess what they were saying/implying.
---
That being said, streamer servers will be VERY active and have a ton of events and things to do on them over other servers. Those moments that people say make PVP servers special over PVE servers, streamer PVP servers will have in spades. With starting a full time job soon, I don't know if I can dedicate enough time to do the things I want like banging the gong or getting legendaries or anything like that and events like what streamers host (going by other games) are going to be very appealing.
---
Same here, but with a Paladin.  I never played a priest in vanilla, and want to be a healer, but rolling a paladin again would be like putting on an old, comfortable pair of shoes.
---
CAN SOMEBODY PLEASE DRAW SYLVANAS FARTING INTO A WALKIE TALKIE NOW? THAT PICTURE IS BEST IN SLOT
---
I will be playing 5x warlocks.  The dots will be many.
---
Of course, that's the part to focus on because there's no defense for the rest. Feels good. Yes, as a matter of fact, they do!
---
Eh I see where you're coming from. I played a warrior in Vanilla and for years I stood firm in my belief that warriors should get prio. But back then, I think I was so taken aback by the crazy top end damage on HoR that I wasn't quit seeing the bigger picture. 
---
For one, warriors really do have better options. If you're 1h fury, you're never going to have use for it. And if you're a 2h wielding MS or Fury warrior, you really do have better options, such as Bonereaver's and Ashkhandi. HoR may have a much higher top end than Bonereaver's, but sword specialization, as well as the insane armor pen proc, more than make up for the loss in top end damage. Just my two cents.
---
rp fag
---
One of the reasons for layering was to counter "dead" servers by essentially soft-merging multiple servers together after the first few weeks. This shouldn't be an issue anyway, since instead of starting on a server that maxes out at 5k people and dies in a month, you are essentially starting on a server with 15k people. Even a large percentage of people who stop playing would leave a lively and populous server.
---
Fall semester starts? Dude be happy its university. I have to move to another city and start a new harder job 2 days after classic comes out. Timing is everything I guess
---
Was it once you killed a boss though for Classic? I’m thinking that I remember killing a couple ZG mobs and got stuck on that raid ID for the week.
---
I could be wrong though.
---
Women shouldn't vote productions, classy.

I’m in Japan but (GMT +9) and it is hard to find others that are in a similar time zone. I suppose I could try an Australian guild but still about 4-5 hour difference. 
---
I’d be willing to join up with that, assuming I could use English.
---
There is absolutely no difference, but blizzard should just make one so people can stop crying about it.
---
You better be selling them!!!!

I can't find the video online, but there used to be one called Dwarves Can't Dance, set to AC/DC's Highway to Hell that had dwarves doing this dance.

YOU SEEM TO OF NOT UNDERSTOOD THE POINT OF THIS POST, UNECCESARRILY DRAMATIC A N G E R CAPS
---
people like you made me glad this video exists
---
First off, great job, this is awesome. If you want to go a little further, since you decided to go with some battle damage you might also want to wear it out a bit. Right now it looks like a brand new banner that someone cut up. You did a good job of not making the cuts too regular, and I love the partially stitched together parts, but the rest of it still looks new. Just leaving it in the sun for long periods of time will fade the color a bit, or taking it out and putting it on the ground and stomping on it for a couple minutes. There are some more artificial and faster methods to do this sort of thing but I don't think the end result is ever as good as just beating it up.
---
I've been doing a lot of research lately and I found out you can simply throw the baby away and free up some time to roll on a pvp server.
---
May the light be with you, brother
---
I went PvE for all of Vanilla and regretted it. It's harder/slower to level maybe, but I think it would be way more fun to actually go out into the world and fight in a higher stakes environment than a BG.
---
Weeeeeee
---
I am only playing one character as well, but not because of time restraints. I want to master the mage class. 
---
When I started back in vanilla, I only played a rogue. I loved being a rogue, learned everything I could, and played him everyday. I had very good mind and muscle connection with him. Then, after the expansion I started rolling a bunch of alts like everyone else and my rogue got put on the shelf. I was decent on my alts but never really connected with any of them. 
---
Years later I decided I wanted to main my rogue again and I put a lot of effort into re-learning to play him, but I couldn't get anywhere near how good I was before. Looking back, I wish I would have just stuck with my rogue and never leveled any alts. 
---
This time I look forward to putting all of my time and attention into one class in hopes of really mastering it, and building a memorable reputation among the people I'm fortunate enough to play with.
---
So your existence is enriched by others finding things distasteful or repulsive? Your base level of joy must be in the gutter as is. I hope you get better.
---
Raid gear is too easy to get in comparison.  R14 just isnt worth it.
---
If everyone had the mindset of doing the best for the guilds we wouldn't have PI/SW priests because we would only have one warlock, one druid, 2-3 priests and the rest warriors/mages because that is the best setup for a raid. Luckily most guilds think it's more fun to not min-max like that and so we have more warlocks, rogues, hunters etc. in our raids. 
---
As long as that specific way is good I don't see a problem with it and neither does any other guild. There's a difference between only wanting to play ret paladin and only wanting to play disc or holy priest. 
---
And btw if you like to gimp yourself like crazy to carry others then that's fine, you do that. But if you tell me that I *have* to gimp myself to carry others then I will say no. And if that's an issue then I'll find another guild, no problem. If I play DS/Ruin and there are no other warlocks in the raid I will bite the sour apple and summon that useless imp to carry the tanks. But that's one raid. I don't have to use a weird spec that sucks for everything except carrying the warlocks, I just have to do bad dps for the night and that's fine.
---
theyre fine at tanking 5mans, its slow as shit though and they have no taunt
---
Reporting is a good thing. I want to play a video game not visit a kkk rally
---
Out of the loop a little... So did beta only go till level 40? No end game beta testing or what? (although seem rough to coordinate)
---
Plenty of sites where the seller doesn't even have to advertise in game either, they just pay a small cut to the site and they do all of that... right click reporting isn't going to do much like this reddit thinks lol
---
Aside from the cool mind control priests can also levitate and mind vision.

It’s pretty great in wpvp when you can fear someone,sw:p and nope out off a cliff or across a lake.

---
You know how to tell when you lost an argument and are only humiliating yourself?
---
When your position is so weak that your only response is to argue against assertions your opponent never actually made. 
---
I will feed your sense of self righteousness though, because i want to see you keep waving that retard flag in this thread. 
---
Unlike that other guy who was only embarrassed an idiot like you agreed with him.. 
---
I actually think this video is hilarious.
---
Yeh I’m feeling that lol!
---
That's asking ALOT of the internet friend, so I'm gonna repeat if you dont want your funeral crashed then dont roll on a pvp server.  Shit they could've all made chars on a pve server for this event only and then went back
---
Tbh, it may be nice for a lil while not worrying about min maxing. But after awhile everyone will be doing it. Its just how the gaming culture is these days. If you arent putting in effort you feel like you're letting your team mates down.
---
Titty sprinkles
---
Pretty sure there's a misunderstanding going on here. You didn't have a question mark in your post, so it sounds like you're stating that "spellsteal isn't in vanilla" which is already what he said. You seem to of meant "Whattt, spellsteal isn't in vanilla?". To be fair you still might of gotten downvotes because r/classicwow

Every server thought theirs was the one with all the Drama. In reality every server had this nickname. Dragonblight - Dramablight checking in.

That was something I noticed on most private servers I played too. Some of them would trigger instantly everytime, some would only occur in the last 2 seconds, some just wouldn't work at all, etc.
---
they wont and shouldnt do anything about it
---
outnumbered? deal with it, go full gorilla warfare, gank and run, make a name for yourself.

never liked kids that went and cried to blizzard cuz "waah waaah ders so maaanyy hordeeee waaaah"
---
There needs to be bad loot in order for there to be good loot.
---
Which servers would we be rolling on?
---
Note that having the mindset of doing the best for the guild doesn't mean a completely min/max, it means doing the best you can with the tools you are given from the class you've chosen to aid the raid composition. If you already have, as OP stated, 4 - 5 warlocks then it's HIGHLY beneficial of you to run PI/SW and it gets even more beneficial the higher tier you get.
---
And I said, if you want to completely ignore any and all requests to alter your spec to fit the raid better then yeah, you can surely find a new guild. Not even sure why that's even brought up as a discussion point because it doesn't really matter at all.
---
THANK YOU MY OCEANIC BRETHREN.

One step closer to becoming r/wow
---
I cant say where id be without my wife. I can say, though, that i would never stop taking agency for myself, never settle until i had an alignment with my life and my views. I would never give up, and id also avoid doing anything to permanently screw me.
---
I am very fortunate to have my job but i do every thing i can to make the most out of my life’s opportunities, which a lot of people dont do.
---
I agree. I plan to min max with the exception of playing a female orc warrior. I’m not gonna compromise playing the race I want to play. As far as gearing goes I will absolutely put effort into getting BiS.
---
I think that the community at large will hopefully be a little more lax in that respect though, above all I hope that people come back and enjoy the game. 
---
I was absolutely a noob back then, I had a lot of epics that were horribly itemized but no one seemed to care in fact I was praised for my gear even tho we would all lol real hard if you saw my sham at the end of classic.
---
Idk, whenever I get on retail if and sw are both busy...
---
I think they will be equally in demand for healing dungeons (tanks and healers are in short supply)
---
this image is so stupid, "omg everyone moved on and I'm the only one still playing, this is so sad "
---
Are you saying that you know of a guild that will clear Naxx with stacking boomkins, ele shamans and resto druids?
---
Because in that case I'd be extremely happy if you'd follow up on that with their logs and videos, since they'd achieve something that has never been done.
---
Also to chime in on your personal attack, if you have a raid leader that welcomes any and all people aiming to play specs that aren't suited for raiding, he isn't competent. A raid leader is supposed to make sure that his guild clears the content by any means or tools he has available to him.
---
Having an entire raid full of off-specs that doesn't function in PvE raiding wouldn't achieve that.
---
I mean a lot of warriors don’t even want it at some points. We had a eye given to a resto shaman because the warriors present said basically what the dude above you said in that theyre holding out for a different weapon. (Even for PvP)
---
&gt; Thank god we weren't on a PVP server.
---
Donnie, you're out of your element.
---
You are like a vegan complaining about how under cooked the steak the guy at the table next you ordered is.
---
Ah yes, every single guild will be the most hardcore, optimal only, farm every day for raid night guild!
---
Or, y'know. There'll be guilds with a more relaxed approach to things catered to the people who don't have as much time and don't mind as long as it's viable.
---
You are absolutely right, but that doesn't excuse them. I can still express outrage and disgust. If I found it funny in the past, I can still look back and say "You know, those people were really shitty. I don't approve of that."
---
I am not calling for consequences at all.

Don't worry you can still play your twinks and feel powerful as you shitstomp unwitting new players inti the ground in WSG. Don'tcha worry bud there is always an outlet for people like you.

if that can drain my asshole, looks great
---
This one at least in my experience transcended just the server itself. Later in my life I moved factions and servers, and when I told people there I transferred from darkspear they said "oh you're from dramaspear" lol
---
and ill still play a game every now and again and ask myself why do i play this shit game
---
So troll does more dmg than orc?
---
Yes, I intend to main a priest. Although I will roll a hunter for farming gold, and a rogue for PVP, oh and I'll roll a warrior for the times the guildies need a tank, also a paladin and a druid to have all alliance healers, and I think it wouldn't be a bad idea to have a mage for aoe farming when I want to shake things up. but definitely wouldn't level a warlock I'm sticking to one class only
---
No non-meme specs, other than possibly 2h fury slam build, would ever use HoR in PvE. It is almost exclusively a PvP item.
---
Their racial is better for threat.
---
I plan to pvp a lot so orc stun resist is gonna be invaluable to me.
---
thank you
---
yes, players could only level to 40
---
&gt;The Final Pre-Launch Census:
---
We previously held two large census/surveys: #1, over a year ago and #2, a few months ago
---
They were well-received and provided quite a lot of data to the community (and possibly Blizzard?). However, as new information about Classic WoW has since emerged, and more people are on-board the hype train, we think a third census would be of use. We plan to release this census about a month before release of Classic… so we’ll be waiting on a release date. But, in the meantime, if you have any broad questions you’d like added to the census, please comment below and we’ll add what we can without making the census incredibly over-sized. We’ll sticky the census when we’re ready to release it closer to launch, and we’ll leave it open 1-2 weeks, giving everyone a couple weeks before launch to digest the results.
---
[They said](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bb9nu8/state_of_the_subreddit_onward_to_victory/) they intend on doing a third official subreddit census one month out from release.
---
Answer the fucking question, which does more damage?
---
Fair point, you have the right to react as you please. Although, at the end of the day it’s simply a game so I’d say don’t lose sleep over it.
---
I rly hope barrens chat will be fun. In the end its a running gag from 15 years ago. It can turn out like a complete cringe fest in the end

Okay? What are you trying to say here?
---
"Always be on the attack" is nice, but sometimes you need to elaborate, or the conversation is nothing You've basically said nothing at all so far, so I question the point of anything you posted.
---
Yup, just a matter of time before every raiding priest/hunter has those weps.
---
They changed their minds and there will be French and German servers as well.
---
and "bad" loot = enchant mats, or very fun niche build items like reflect paladin, etc.

That axe spec though is pretty damn good for tank threat.

This is diabolic. Have to try it out

I do really hate it sometimes that we can’t celebrate our accomplishments without being considered “bragging”

Shadow bis requires few of the naxx loot, you are right, many bis slots like snowblond shoes, firemaw belt come from phase 2-3, lol.
---
Shadow priest is definitely easiest to gear.
---
Afaik it was the same 10years ago
---
Yep, exactly my point. Your ability to get in a raid can be heavily dependent on your standing in a guild, and so therefore you can't claim you'll never get into a guild. But the point is that you DO need to get into a guild early and establish a relationship. You can't just join some random guild and go "let me in, i want to shadow"
---
Blizzard historically overprepares for launches. The problem is ALWAYS the things you can't prepare for: the unexpected. That's WHY they overprepare. They over prepared for MoP and boom they made one simple stupid mistake on one of the first alliance quests and MASSIVE bottleneck insues. WoD had multiple bugs related to the Garrison, mostly combined with an item from wrath called Haunted Memento. Legion went well, TOO well, they sharded it so heavily to avoid another WoD incident that I didn't see a single player for hours. Then Legion ran into an issue with thousands of skeletons in Dalaran Underbelly due to the PvP there. Sadly I missed BFA launch so I don't have any stories there, but I noticed the day before launch they made the starting neutral camp a Sanctuary, that was almost a hilarious disaster.
---
I have confidence that Blizzard knows how much they'll get and are preparing for more. The problem is that they can't truly overprepare due to having to make sure server pops stay solid after the launch, it's something they are probably still discussing. It'll be a poop fest, but they know that
---
It's bad because it splits the community on a community driven game. You never run into people, you're never challenged while leveling. It's such a chore Blizz is giving people gear that'll last them for 100 levels just to make it less shitty.
---
The only reason modern wow has a leveling system is because people pay by month. More time it takes to do something, more money they make. I don't play a shooter to chat with people and make friends, I play it to shoot people. In the same way, I don't join a Massively-Multiplayer Online community to never SEE or interact with said community.
---
It's not all that hard either. Mobs in vanilla 60 dungeons had like 5k hp. All you'd do is wait for the paladin to set down consecrate then kill the skull, then the x, etc. 
---
I remember doing a timed strath where all the paladin had to do was use holy wrath and lay down a consecrate. We'd just pick the mobs off 1 by 1 ezpz. The only time you have to wait for the paladin to establish aggro is on bosses and those aboms in strath.
---
That’s warriors.
---
Are pallys good at tanking or healing in bgs? (I've never played one so tbh I don't know what they do)

I'm sure with determination and skill you'll get to rank 14. If not then find a group of people who can help boost you. You got this buddy. :D

Literally the part of WoW i am most excited for. It’s one of the things that gives horde its identity, it’s like sure, blizz spent more time on alliance zones and cities and all that... but horde got barrens chat. Evens things out. Also it’s nice knowing everyone who passed lvl 22 or whatever and has left the barrens still went through the same grab-ass shenanigans while they were stuck in barrens purgatory, horde is forged in the fires of Chuck Norris jokes and chat spam.
---
That is all.
---
shouldnt have done it on a PVP realm in a PVP zone.

the only disgusting thing is that I wasnt there to join in on the fun

Person who played in 2006 reporting in.

This video was met with about the same criticism as it does to this day. Many people thought it was funny, and just as many thought it was disrespectful. Throw in groups of individuals claiming they should have known better, done it on a PVE server, or that PVP is the spirit of the game and you can recreate the moment.
---
Deep troll? That’s a pretty big issue with this sub in general.
---
Too many of you are holding the private servers as the Bible, when on countless times blizz has told you guys ‘nah, they got it wrong’
---
How many ‘not a bug list’ bugs are from people comparing the beta to private servers incorrect info.
---
I’m not claiming to be an expert, it’s just my opinion and what I’ve seen from the theory crafting community.
---
Warlocks can play multiple specs in pvp.
---
Delving into the destruction tree allows locks to play a burst mage style. I watched streams of the AV beta and Kargoz was rocking top 3 kills that way.
---
Of course I’d love to as well! Send me a PM and we’ll keep in touch!
---
I disagree, there were achievements but they were more subtle, like PvP ranks and titles, thunderfury, the AQ and winter saber mounts, max reputation for certain factions or all of your really dock.. etc.
---
Not gonna lie there's def better ones online, but you're sweet
---
For raiding? Was deep elemental for a long time during MC/Ony (because like the most, I didn't know what I was doing). Then by the time we got to Rag I was deep resto, and stayed that until I decided to go for High Warlord by the time AQ was out for a while and specced Elemental (and a bit of Resto up to NS), after which I respecced Resto for Naxx. Shamans should always just spec deep Resto (including Mana Tide) for raids, with a little bit of Enhancement for better SoE and GoA Totems. And There's little to gain from Elemental, and Purification is a must (they're not like Priests that should at around AQ migrate talent points from Spiritual Healing to Disc for Power Infusion).
---
I’ve always been disgusted by this. One of those things you hear about and lose faith in humanity for a bit.
---
Look, I don't know if you're just trying to give realistic advice, or if you're saying that the people who crashed a funeral were stand up human beings. I'm just saying that if you do crash a funeral, or support the people that crashed a funeral you're a huge asshole. Like ya, I get it, people are huge assholes on the internet and you're not going to stop them from being assholes. I just really want to make sure everyone knows they are assholes.
---
Ahh, sorry, no idea then.
---
That is too far of a stretch, the meta won't change drastically, private servers aren't closer to Minecraft servers than to classic wow, they are literally the best copy ever made until Aug 27th.
---
I agree that it was disrespectful, but I'll still defend it. For me, the reason WoW is enjoyable is that I can feel invested in the game and its characters. It's hard for me to imagine that someone who wanted to have an in game funeral wouldn't feel similarly. But I am only so invested into the game because within it actions have consequences. Maybe it's the part of me that's sympathetic to RP speaking, but I feel like someone wants to have a memorial service in game, they should either recognize it as a logistically intensive endeavor and act to secure the area, or go to a non-intensive spot. To insist otherwise is to deny the logic of the game world, which seemingly defeats the point of wanting a memorial within the game at all.
---
Actions having consequences goes both ways, people are entitled to feel that this was a dick move. Particularly in light of the commentaries we saw coming from this guild, I feel that's a fair judgment. But on the other hand, imagine if there had instead been a server wide armistice on the day of the funeral. Wouldn't that have been awe-inspiring? We can't have the possibility of such positive events without also allowing the possibility of negative ones like this. That's a trade I think is worthwhile.
---
I never know how to feel about this. It’s both awful and hilarious, and I can never not watch this video when it’s posted... and with this look on my face 😱. 
---
Great song as always though.

No one with a job basically

If they don’t have it the rp-pvp community is going to takeover one of the pvp servers.

Honestly I’m waiting for the drama when realms are released, y’know there’s gonna be some over that.

I don’t see what one has to do with the other.

---
Thanks I hope I get my form back, jelly of those of you who pick it back up so easily. 
---
Also, I was never a bully, not in world pvp or with my twink. I really enjoyed fighting other very strong alliance players and having a long drawn out nail biter of a fight. Thats what im looking forward to. I had so much fun with the shammy in those fights, he wore a shield and a 1 hander byt would basically paper cut you to death before you would be able to kill him. Heals, shocks and totems were so disruptive and controlling.
---
I think blizz should change the R14 grind so that 100 people can have the title but the armor sets and weapons are available to anyone that can pull a solid 30 hours a week. 
---
BTW I had a nice laugh with your joke about the engineers and such. they don't kill themselves for months at a time.
---
You also get an upvote

Me and a buddy were looking through old loot tables for the world dragons today and it was amazing how some of the gear isn’t really built for any class at all, so nobody could actually use it efficiently. It’s not bad but just odd and it was so fun to look at gear like that. It was almost like they built the gear before deciding how the game would work and it ends up feeling so much more unique and interesting. Not great to use, but super fun.
---
Thank you for actually responding instead of trolling. I am agreeing with you mostly. Actions do have consequences, and that includes setting up a public event on a PVP server, albeit this was the first time this sort of thing ever really happened. I heard about another memorial service in Booty Bay that got raided to hell and back, as well. Pretty fucked up stuff.
---
Your points are all well made. I do still take exception to the conflation of planning an event on a PVP server and having it be raided, disrespected, and destroyed. I also have such disdain for the pessimism implied in expecting such a thing as a near-certainty.
---
Yin and Yang philosophies are certainly relatable, and the presence of the negative does make the positive feel like even more of a victory.
---
Anyway, as careless as it was on the part of the organizers, I feel sympathy for their betrayed trust, and the memories of their friend being tainted by this having happened. I am sure the regret is only all the more bitter in retrospect that they didn't do things differently... which is all the more reason to believe that those who attacked them are detestable.
---
Nice POV. And like I’ve mentioned and been downvoted for so far, private servers get a lot wrong. It’s possible for BiS lists to change when we get back to legit numbers for things in the background like proc rates and actual boss stats without all the guesswork they’ve done over the years.

The problem is if this options waits till later, players will end up with models that look completely different from their original intended chosen look. The two modes do not result in similar looks. So the sooner they implement this the better. Unless they let player redo their toon’s appearance from the login screen once this becomes available as an option.
---
&gt;Retail itemization is nearly perfect, but at the end of the day they’re all the same, same stat choices, just different power levels.
---
&gt;Having terrible itemization kinda gives the player agency in being able to decide which piece is better for what they do.
---
Yeah, this is why I really really really despise terms like 'good game design', or whatever.. they're 'good' only with respect to a certain philosophy of game design, and one that's not always the best for all people.
---
Yes, in current WoW items are 'well-designed'.. all classes and specs are viable, and everything works.  But that comes at a cost of nearly nothing having any sense of identity and there being almost zero creativity in item builds.
---
It's *interesting* that Edgemaster's Handguards are BIS for a long time.. having random items be so good, but not immediately obviously good, really rewards players for being creative, exploring item options and learning the game.  While it's ultimately pretty awkward, the creativity and subversion of the mechanics to achieve better ends is an exciting part of the game.  Once everything gets *too* neatly tailored, you lose out on such experiences.  And I think that's a big part of games that are missing nowadays: a sense of niche knowledge that can give you advantages.
---
EU accounts don't have it unless you have been in beta or stress test
---
Three gnomes pretending to be a good race.
---
Yeh, like having to guess wether or not that item will be an upgrade, and spending dkp on it. Was probably an upgrade overall but not amazing? Who cares. Get them  purples
---
It wasn’t a funeral though. It was a bunch of people moving their in game characters to a certain spot in the game because someone they used to play with died. Don’t act like people “on the internet” would support it If 40 people got together and crashed the actual funeral.
---
Hrmmm, yeah... three is going to slow things down crazily I suppose! Well, I guess that leaves sham' 'n' 'lock, which covers almost everything I want anyway. I just like the story I thought up for my priest, heh.

---
This is the wow classic sub. There's a sub for D2 where you can argue about this ad nauseum.
---
I think that itemization is horrible in BFA because it's boring. You at least cared about items in classic, whereas bfa has multiple mechanics that invalidate gear as a concept: replacement raid tiers instead of progression tiers, lottery bonuses to gear, ilvls and all gear essentially having the same stat formula, no set bonuses, custom visualizations so you can't even tell what items someone has.
---
Currently there is a /console command to double the ultra setting resulting in even nicer looking graphics but that does not affect models, only the environment.
---
&gt;	But now, I'm married, full time job with long hours.  I'll be able to play maybe an hour on weekdays, longer on weekends.

Isn't autolooting a change?
---
Skills and talents are set at 1.12. Raids and loot are being phased in (6 phases total)

To answer: you can‘t, need to be subbed.
---
He's right
---
This, you bring mages for utility (water, portals, sheep, burst aoe, slows/roots, intellect, amplify) and to not be too melee stacked for things like kt/cthun etc. Also there are fringe cases where mages are actually good like damage amplification fights like thaddius.
---
Making a character on multiple servers to see how they pan out after a week or so. If the one I start leveling on ends up with streamers I’ll switch. I’m willing to get a bit behind the curve if it increases my chance of landing on a better server
---
Please explain to me why survival is good in AQ if you have enough hunters using TSA, because my calculations show that MM is going to outperform Survival even on personal DPS throughout all Vanilla content.
---
Truly. It’s too bad it really can’t be recreated because it’s so obvious how a lot of the original itemization is a product of ignorance. 
---
They really didn’t know how to make the best items in the game they just kinda guessed and littered the world with items with random stats. Sure there are some examples of knowing they were making an OP item but they weren’t making OP items for every slot for every class and spec, they’re just kinda sprinkled out here and there.

I played pretty hardcore from vanilla-wotlk. After that I was on and off and truly gave up in pandaria. I will need friends to play with preferable on a pvp(alliance).

In 2019, I still think it's awesome.
---
Are you healing or playing shadow?
---
No, it works fine. [Video here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Rsx2ARJyXY). 
---
It has been reported (by Tipsout) as not working, but until I actually see video of him attempting it and failing, I am putting zero faith in that claim.
---
You're in the wrong thread, this point is irrelevant.
---
I do not think that the memorial or positive memories were destroyed by this. Additionally, though it gets to our differing assumptions on trust, I don't think that it really constitutes a meaningful betrayal of trust, since these are groups nominally on the opposite side of the game.
---
I think that this is bad, but bad in the same sense that stealing a $5 from a little kid is bad, but not in the sense that spitting on someone's corpse is bad. If anyone was traumatized by this, or had their memories tainted by it, that's an overreaction on their part which I'm not inclined to give much deference. We can safely use this event as a diagnostic to tell us that those of Serenity Now are callous towards others, but I don't think the raid on the memorial was a moral atrocity, I only think it was in poor taste. Sometimes people move from seeing death itself as a tragedy to seeing anything bad peripherally associated with death as comparably horrible in magnitude, which I think is a mistake.
---
what a bunch of glorious bastards =)
---
I would have to assume Troll would be better for healing because their berserk racial gives you a bit of haste on demand. None of the other racial abilities or racial spells of either troll or UD really benefit PvE healers very much. PvP is more complicated.
---
You got downvoted for wanting a high pop server. Welcome to r/classicwow.
---
PvE, Troll. Actually relevant racial.
---
PvP, Undead probably takes it because anti cc.
---
Lol no, payo knows its shit weapon for rogues
---
&gt; Video can mean many things to many people, and I think having a heartfelt get together for another player and friend is respectable and kind. I wouldn't have done this.
---
Having an in-game funeral is a joke in itself.
---
or we can just not add it, it has no place in classic.
---
There is going to be so much account sharing going on, I ain't even going to worry about it.
---
I’m pretty sure only top end guilds will really care about this sort of thing. Most will just be happy to have 40 people.
---
Thus also presumes consumables usage and 100% uptime on inspiration... which is hardly guaranteed.

Taladril does note it's 5.06 with Thick Hide 5/5 in his almost too thorough Druid tanking guide:
---
https://classicwow.live/guides/22/treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla
---
And he's primarily a pserver player(obviously, since classic won't exist until 27.8)
---
So it's more likely that most pserver players simply don't know how Thick Hide works.
---
Spinal should be in at launch no?
---
Either way I’ll still play classic as my main game :)
---
Maybe you had a stroke recently and didn’t notice? I jumped back into vanilla after 9 years break and after a few hours it feels like i never left.
---
As another guy wrote it’s like riding a bike.
---
Maybe it’s retail and your just not used to it.
---
Account sharing people won’t get away with it unless the Bracket leaders allow it because of discord... it’s just not going to happen. Take it from me, it will be pretty rare for people not to take notice.
---
Don’t let anything discourage you, I’ve dealt with a few account sharing people and they still could not out farm my friends and I.

I actually used some other sources to get the right damage values of a shot rotation, but nice assumption - good day.

I believe this is what caused the completely lopsided faction imbalance on Illidan we still see today as many people wanted to take revenge on SN and alliance on the server in general. 
---
Talk about winning a battle but losing a war.

There are few quest hubs that have nice rewards such as a trinket reward and class quests in ST. Them and other largely added for extra quests for leveling.

“ORIGIN” will be an English-speaking guild based on the first listed Chinesse pvp server that is open for anyone and nationality, but our main language for communication is English.
---
We are currently recruiting to get enough members for 40-player raids in WoW Classic.
---
What we expect of members:
---
As a PvE raider: Achieving lvl 60 with raid-ready gear within 8 weeks
---
Currently recruiting all classes.
---
Our Raid Schedule: 2x per week, raid days to be determined.
---
As a casual member: Help out with recruitment, crafting , pvp intel.
---
ORIGIN is founded so that non-Mandarin speakers in the Asia region can enjoy WoW with low ping by connecting to the chinesse server instead of the Sydney and US West Coast servers. We hope to find like-minded people who enjoy WoW and are still looking to clear content + pvp.

Look forward to hearing from you.

I'm just saying allot of the charm of the old world was hand crafted, cranking up the GFX knob can really break the look of the game.
---
foliage is one example but there are others such as view distance, there was a comparison somewhere between the old teldrasil and classic teldrasil where the old purple fog effect and limited view distance made the zone look really cool.
---
the fog effect was less pronounced on classic and the view distance was cranked way up meaning you could see way far into the distance and it just ruined the look of the zone.
---
Gotta scroll to the bottom for all the Real Talk ^^

That, and

&gt;The people in here defending this are sick for finding any pleasure in this situation.
---
But if we can dismiss both of those we can agree on...
---
&gt;The single irrational thing I am guilty of is wishing for better out of fellow humans.
---
You and all the rest of us.
---
We just have varying definitions of "better." 
---
it core you seem to believe that the mourners "deserved" to be unmolested, after creating characters, leveling to 60, and traveling to a contested zone on a pvp server.
---
Because they were sad, they should have been granted special protection to occupy an area, which they had already agreed to being pvp enabled.
---
Despite already having access to perfectly adequate facilities like the stormwind chapel where they would have been relatively safe, or simply holding the event on a pve server in perfect safety. 
---
Or... best of all... not contaminating the game with their RL tragedy. 
---
Which yes I did phrase to be particularly abrasive and yet is true nonetheless. 
---
What I am trying to articulate is that their upset feelings do not grant them the right to trample on everyone else's experience of the game.
---
If you disagree please explain then why we shouldn't simply hold a contest of "who feels the saddest or angriest or most outraged today" every morning, and then whoever wins gets to decide what the rules are for today.
---
At the end of the day WoW is a *game*, and the assholes, are NOT the one's who were trying to bend it to their own will arbitrarily.
---
For me its the opposite i have been playing wow on and off since the start and have way more knowledge and skill than when i first set out on my journey. 
---
I mean shit i was a keyboard turner back in vanilla only way is up haha
---
Just watch a YouTube video comparing warrior race choices. There’s a healthy video by your private server god skarm saying as much.
---
The big things that are question marks for raids is armor values. Pirate servers were way off for parry rate for bosses for example.  They were pretty close with things like dodge and hit chance. But the way armor penetration stacks could have huge dps implications. Basically the things we do know that different vary wildly and we have no idea on all the other things in raids that weren't tested at all.
---
Oh cool ! We are a number of Swedes and a Dane, some dutchies etc. diverse group. Will PM you a discord link !
---
Use incognito mode.
---
He's saying it's really none of your business to be saying how people should feel about this. A PvP server is designed for...PvP. You made the choice to not be part of that, but everyone that rolled on that server knew what they were signing up for. Good on you for going PvE but that's irrelevant here.
---
trying to prove they can do good pve dps I Think.
---
Okey, trying to follow. Could you name a few of the core ones?
---
&gt;calling skarm 'god' at anything.
---
Oh and I am the pserver boy huh?
---
Please, provide me an example of the math being wrong compared live in a way what will benefit trolls more than orcs. Because surely it must be so for your claim to be correct.
---
Sure, the only price is removing the most enjoyable aspect of classic :-)
---
Awesome! Thanks!
---
Ah I think it's the wording in the title that makes it hard to understand it that way. He put the meme spec part directly after the high warlord claim. I'd be interested to see an enhance shaman do great dps. It doesn't even look theoretical possible so seeing in practice would be sweet.
---
&gt; I'll also point out one last thing: That I do not play on PVP servers does not mean that I can not or should not comment about them
---
&gt;I'll also point out one last thing: That I do not play on PVP servers does not mean that I can not or should not comment about them

Yea gatekeeping is like slippery slope both things are real but they are not usually applicable where people try to apply the words.

You don't like pvp in general. 
---
You are loudly proclaiming that pvpers pvping, in a pvp area on a pvp server are sick immoral cowards.

I think it's fair to say you don't have an unbiased opinion.

Is there a way to have them swap every time you jump by pressing space?
---
2nd BIS pre-raid Mage robes require 4 and the BIS pre-raid Warlock robes require 12. BIS Phase 2 Warlock and SPriest gloves require 8. The Phase 5 BIS glove enchant for both those classes requires 6.
---
Engineers only need 5 one time (Shadow Reflector and Death Ray).
---
Not to mention they can be turned into Essence of Water, which are worth about 3x as much.
---
RP and PVP shouldn't even be in the same sentence.  How can you roleplay when you are getting ganked?
---
&gt;Shamans are around 13-15 % of the horde population, which makes them one of the most played classes, way more popular than priest.
---
Lets see how that goes in L60 raiding scene. In private servers, when we were on horde side, we CONSTANTLY we short on the number of shamans we wanted to raid with. We couldnt recruit fast enough.
---
Its one thing to tick a box in a survey and another thing to raid for 2 years.

Never played WoW for more than 1 day (48 hour free trial i think it was) and im extremely interested now. Do they plan on coming out with expansions for classic wow?
---
0 Blocks, 0 Misses, 0 Parry, 0 dodge... wat
---
That just changes shaders, shadows lightning etc. New models use entirely different animations, it’s not as simple as just flipping a switch. The old database has naturally nothing related to these new models so blizzard would have to backport every spell animation and similar from future expansions. 
---
It’s not just switching on a button.
---
Why before AB is out?
---
I can still remember TB talking about this in EPIC back in the day.
---
Classic raids are definitely not Heroic. If your job is just to show up on time, it's only slightly harder than LFR. The real difficulty in Vanilla Raiding is a separate game only guild leadership has to play.
---
Yeah, me for sure. I barely have time for one toon.
---
Your kind of really bad at trolling man. 
---
As another user said you can snapshot low hp rage gains with troll to spam more heroic strikes. 
---
This is actually not a case of private server math being incorrect causing a discrepancy. Those examples I already cited.
---
I actually offered to him to make it look more beat up, but he said he likes it this way. Thank you though! If he changes his mind, I've got a bunch of suggestions for how to make it look more weathered, which is awesome.
---
Troll and Undead are both excellent in their own ways. Personally I play Undead because that's what I played in Classic. Knowing what I know now though, Troll is *probably* the better choice for both PVE and PVP.
---

Yeah i really hope they put a large and decent staff in place to handle reports and other support stuff properly. They don't seem all that committed to classic tho, so i have my worries :\[
---
ah yes i too remember my vanilla assassination rogue with only two weapon slots
---
same
---
one for guild and raids during normal hours to level with them, and other for fun and wpvp when im a work at night shift and got no one to play with

this is where the privilidged bois go to play WoW, i still got my goold ole sock n bucket
---
Follow these simple steps! Classic players will hate you! You won’t believe number 7!
---
1. Chop off dick. Distraction and time waster.
---
2. Put catheter into dick hole and pipe out window.
---
3. Use portapotty as sear and plumb additional storage. Maybe throw a cushion on that fo yo ass.
---
4.  Hire a hooker to come force feed you. Any health professional will refuse. Have plenty o canned spam on standby.
---
5.  Remove eyelids.
---
6.  Drugs. All the drugs! What drugs are you even on? You don’t know!
---
&gt;You were loudly proclaiming that pvpers pvping, in a pvp area on a pvp server were sick immoral cowards.
---
Now now, that's a gross mischaracterization of what I said, but it sounds great so I'll claim it. These particular ones were definitely... well okay, immoral cowards is not at all wording I'd choose. Good lord, I'd at least say "sick sad sacks of shit" for the alliteration.
---
Not really. For any healer class, the items you are going to struggle to get is neck, rings, trinkets and weapons. Every single one will get the tier items and most of offpieces they can ever want. Shaman T1 and T2 does have great bonuses, so you can use those with other BIS blues from 5-mans.
---
And example in naxx you share the tier token with DRUIDS and HUNTERS. You will be seeing 1-2 of both of those classes. Compare that to Priest/Mage/warlock token...

Well my guild is planning to raid 9pm-12am EST. I am from Australia so thats around 11am start time for me. It works well when I have a day off or an overnight shift as it doesn't affect my private life at all. If it gets too hard I am sure that finding an Aussie based guild that starts around 8-9pm wont be an issue.
---
Just have to find something that works for your particular situation.
---
Chuck Norris once peed in the petrol tank of a truck. That truck is now known as Optimus Prime.
---
Truth is we don't know. Blizzard prolly doesn't know either, for now.
---
Game design as a whole really has gone in a full circle. Nowadays, you have people trying to optimize things. Like for instance in PoE if you go a spec you gotta go in that one spec fairly hard. RPG's or anything of the sorts tends to promote going hard in one way just due to the nature of maximizing stats.
---
However, as games developed over the years it was like a anticipation of trying to outsmart players. By instead applying variety of ways to maximize. This in turn kinda made things very generic. the idea of Arcane shot on hunters and how it scales with spell damage, or how mend pet scales with healing, would make someone LUL. But really it should ultimately be up to the players to bend stuff, and developers to try to maintain that idea of creating unique ideas. Not the other way around.
---
&gt; That big central figure brings in lots of active players.
---
i really dont wanna play with ppl that are there just because of one ''big central figure''
---
Sadly they are a joke. They really should buff it all to make up for better PCs and better players ..
---
I used to do the farms in plaguelands. You could pull the whole farm in one go and just melt it down with imp blizz.
---
Base game is free nowadays, so just subscription. FYI "base" game includes everything except the latest expansion (BfA at this point, when the next one releases BfA will roll into the base).
---
It sounds a bit more challenging than mindlessly blizzarding mobs in DM.
---
I found Thrash Blade + another good 1h to be slightly better for me at 45+, kill time was nearly the same but I had less downtime as fury with bloodthirst (could kill 1 or 2 mobs more before bandage/food)
---
I didn't get any Stoneslayer or Rockpounder though.
---
I also like fury for tanking dungeons more than arms while leveling.
---
I spec 2h fury for leveling to 40, stay fury while I do Uldaman, if I get the sword or mace I would spec into arms for MS but if it doesn't drop then I will stay fury and get Thrash Blade from Mara and use that to 60 (no IBS to cheese 50-60 on release)
---
Yeah wf has nearly 500 less ap per bonus swing in 1.12 than it did at the start. Used to be 811ap and now its three hundred something
---
Chuck Norris once had sex with a bus full of nuns. Those nuns gave birth to the 1985 Chicago Bears.
---
Back then it was Chuck Norris jokes. Nowadays it will be a whole lot of edgy alt-right and incel bullshit. At least if pservers are anything to go by.
---
Stating that vanilla raids are a joke is a stupid statement when the game has LFR. LFR the majority of players can AFK the entire time and get loot, that is a joke. Vanilla raids are much, much more difficult than LFR.
---
and it wont be funny
---
Ah shit I didn't think of that. One of my mates wants to play druid too. I guess he won't have a trainer either
---
I would do something like [(24/27/0)](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxubgoZVGt0Mux)
---
"only" missing the 5 crit from holy so decent for healing.
---
The only dps grinding that you can do well is probably aoe grinding like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFkZjEml6GU), so blessing of sanctuary helps you out there (and being the bosanc buffer in raids)
---
You can watch [drakovas vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qodXtYwTZuo) on holy/reckoning for more infos.
---
you will get to know your enemy. the only difference is you have a large pool to pick from.
---
Badge of the Swarmguard for example will not be nearly as powerful with classic armour values
---
Still have them in retail.
---
The only people I knew who legitimately did it (most people shared accounts for it) quit wow within a week of hitting rank 14.   They destroyed their enjoyment of the game chasing horribly painful goal.
---
They can't. OP doesn't really know what he's talking about.
---
Goddamn, Gnomeland Security is a great guild name.
---
me brain good
---
WHY IS CLASSIC PRETTY MUCH THE ONLY GAME WHERE PEOPLE EXPECT YOU TO JUSTIFY YOURSELF FOR LIKING IT? THE CONDESCENDING ATTITUDE TOWARDS IT PISSES ME OFF, I DONT NEED TO FIND A REASON FOR LOVE. ALSO ENDING YOUR BASH AGAINST THE GAME WITH A SMUG "BUT IM HAPPY FOR THOSE THAT WANTED IT" DOESNT MAKE YOU SEEM MORE REASONABLE, YOU KNOB.
---
Personally, I think it's more devious of them to let us reserve our names 2 weeks early. The day before BFA release. I wouldn't be surprised if classic numbers are used to showcase how great BFA is.
---
Im not sure, maybe there is a trainer in stormwind, wouldn't be perfect, but it,s not that far away.
---
That’s all personal opinion though. It’s also something that only affects the person who changes it.
---
I don’t see an issue with allowing people to have the models/graphics they want in classic.
---
I just cant handicap myself in early raids for a mediocre leveling advantage. aoe grinding is op. mage ftw
---
That’s sad to hear man. Good friends of yours? Or just people you met in-game?
---
wouldn't retribution tree parry boost, mana reduction and vindication boost sustain? also mount speed is not something to ignore.
---
Oh so you're just a troll. Have fun.
---
Am I stupid or is this a retail screenshot (versatility didn't exist in classic?).
---
One of the guys we leveled together to from 45-60 in the same guild. Had a lot of good times with Damnation.  He never returned.
---
I am in the same situation as you: Full time job, wife, kids. I'm dedicating myself to play a shaman, but knowing myself i will create an alt to use as not only a bank character but also something completly different to play if i ever get burnt out on shaman.
---
Kinda like how in BfA you’ll get an item that is 20 ilvls higher but not really an upgrade cause it’s not your best stats...
---
It's nit well crafted (I think like 75 tailoring), but it got something no other banner would have: a sentimental value for that one person you made it for
---
Farming strat live orb runs as a tank is easy gold. Just say tank gets the first orb then rolls and you're assured 20g per run + trash drops. This is also a good way to get rep for Naxx.
---
Druids at least get tele moon glade so can train there
---
kveðjur náungi Íslendingur!
---
This man priests
---
I am at work and haven't actually looked over the video but I can't imagine he's going to get close to 1,000 dps. I'll have to look when I get home to see what he attributes to the spike from other extremely geared enhance shaman. It's not like there haven't been BiS or near BiS enhance shaman and none of them have been competitive.
---

---
Seems like I might need to do a third Bingo card for pre-release and release topics. But it's a little too soon for that :P
---
most things tbh, they were pulling things out their asses when it came to the values of most things they could not confirm and made guesstimate that were wrong either by a little or a lot, but that is how they remember classic being.
---
For most of the posts during the beta, any that claimed something being wrong with it and the only thing they could do was say the private server was different was generally ignored unless they could come up with a whole lot more proof
---
It is plain to see. Good night sir.
---
Shimmering Flats, was my fav area. Just vast, nothing there and all quests involved killing tons of mobs.
---
Also Hillsbrad and Hinterlands are close second/third :)
---
1k needles. I fucking hate what Cata did to that place.
---
&gt;Three gnomes pretending to be a ~~good~~ race.
---
RNG is not bad in a game of loot. The problem with retail RNG is that it is overused. You need to luck on the piece, then on the titanforging, then on the socket. If you want your BIS piece you will need insane amount of luck. 
---
Instead, in Classic, loot are rare but you only need to get lucky once. Not 3times
---
I can't wait to join a guild that has as a main focus "we're acting like it's 2004 all the time", haha. Classic should be a world stuck in the past, I love it &lt;3.
---
I think so! This is a popular topic and the other one was a little too easy.
---
Impossible!
---
Actually, spriests dps is poop. Watch meters for pathwerk from a youtube video. Spriest was lowest, just above the tanks. Sitting around 410 dps.
---
Mulgore, Durotar, Barrens, 1K Needles, Tanaris, Badlands, Un'Goro, Blasted Lands.
---
I like big ass deserty lands and an excuse to kill lots of things.
---
That explains a lot :)
---
I’m hoping we only get one of each, my biggest fear is having like 3 pvp servers and I somehow reserve names and roll on the one that will die out.
---
Criiiiiiiiiinge
---
The lead vanilla class designer was on ClassiCast at some point &amp; he had some very interesting things to share. He fully admitted they've failed on the class fantasy aspect on some classes &amp; specs, but some decisions that many players rioted against were fully deliberate. 
---
For example, the famous paladin rework right before launch, that stripped them of Crusader Strike and made all their damage passive (Seals) was done, because paladins were first and foremost a support class, so they didn't want to gCD cap them - they needed to be able to throw buffs, cleanses, the occasional heal while hitting things. Interesting stuff.
---
I always only had one char (bank alt aside), that's just what the game is about for me. I play my character, progress my character, and that's what the game is about for me.
---
In classic especially, I don't think I would ever find it relevant to spend time on an alt, even if I did have all the time in the world. 
---
There's ranks to grind, raids to clear, reputation to increase, off-specs to gear for and try, gold to farm, world PVP. 
---
I'd feel I was compromising my main from the sake of the alt. 
---
MAYBE, if you were a pure class, had your BIS gear for the phase, including PVP items, your epic mount, and there was a long time until the next phase, I'd consider it. 
---
As a druid player with family, full time job, and other hobbies, I have won't even have to consider it ;)
---
People talk like inflation is a bad thing.
---
And some stonescale eels to boot ;p
---
Eh. People develop actual connections online, regardless of how stupid you think it is, and it's not exactly feasible for all of them to go to the actual funeral. This is still insanely funny though.
---
The thought process being not wanting to end up on a server with people who have not played classic and will quit by level 20 leaving a  dead server behind
---
I did a bit of fooling around a private server. It was slow at first, but my old skills returned.  Around 42 I killed 50 hunter.  She SS out of stealth while I was mounted, put me in a trap and lined up for an aimshot.  Which I delayed with by sicking my pet on her.  I then FDed before she got the aimshot off, and hit a pot, and beat her with about 100hp left.  I out thought and out reacted her, just like the old vanilla days.
---
No, if pure PvE you go Nelf for the agility. No other race gives a nonsituational dps increase.
---
Well, many players coming back has families and you know, a life. So I dont mind raiding with a guild that dont expect me to be on 40 hours a week.
---
Enh shamans wouldn't use edgemaster's handguards because they don't work on 2 handers
---
Descolace, Ashenvale and Tanaris
---
Spoken like a true cata baby
---
Im hoping for rank 10, rank 14 is impossible if you have a job. If I got paid to play WoW I would go for it.
---
Pretty sure you wouldn't get banned for this. As others have pointed out it's not like they are actually breaking any of the games rules. It shouldn't be up to Blizzard to enforce a moral compass, but who knows in this day and age.
---
There is no non-meme spec that would use that in raid
---
No it’s not. After 7-8k armor you could add 50% more armor and no only get like 2-5% dmg reduction. It’s something but is it work 5 points?
---
Yea, will be the same for me :D
---
Desolace, silithus, winterspring i havent touched these zones since the dark portal opened.
---
I hear you man!
---
Thunder clap can only be resisted I think, and it can crit. But not cause deep wounds
---
Ah yes. The ol' fuck his raidbuffs classic
---
Oi, what’s the biggest fish ya ever caught
---
Vindication won't boost sustain more than extra damage. Yes your reducing their damage but you reduce it even more by increasing your kill speed. I experimented with these kinds of builds and you can't really grind well. I'd go deep ret and grind while still being able to heal. Then when you have a few thousand gold just swap to your more heal/tank spec for dungeons.
---
Except for data from vanilla, retail, pservers and beta..
---
The alliance will be a little more popular overall. Horde will be a lot more popular in bgs.
---
You mean a great excuse to start leveling alts.
---
1kneedles for sure, The pre-cata version was one of my favorite zones to level in
---
Exactly. If a bunch of dudes carrrying alliance banners started beating the shit out of real people at a funeral you think people would be giggling about it?
---
But killing people's characters at an in game memorial? That's funny as shit. Liking black comedy doesn't make you an asshole and neither does not taking an in game memorial deathly serious.
---
That does make it all good. Shit. Checkmate, me. Three words that destroy my entire position and make me rethink my life. If I could afford gold, you'd have it. Three cheers for Penenenen for teaching us all how to not care.
---
&gt; If an enhance shaman is dedicated enough that they're willing to level BS/hammersmith to 300 to get the recipe
---
why would he need to do that? Somebody else can smith sulfuron hammer and afaik it also doesn't require hammer smith.
---
I have heard about this before. First time seeing the video. Rather torn... to say the least.
---
weapon skill provided by edgemasters only apply to 1handers.
---
Eeven more ppl are grown ups and wont play at wll
---
What classes look like shit in BiS and what classes look dope?
---
sulfuras should be phase 2 though.
---
Thanks. I am finding a similar result, testing right now. I have failed to get any dodges, but I HAVE procced deeep wounds. That's on a private server though, so it may be wrong.
---
So people who are disagreeing with you have to be trolling huh? Typical. 
---
'snapshot low hp rage gains' , what in the actual fuck are you talking about? You didn't cite jack shit, you are peddling your own bullshit opinions as facts.
---
BERSERKING LASTS 10 FUCKING SECONDS. An orc with an axe has +5 weapon skill the entire fucking fight.
---
'hurr but with thunderfury he doesn't get +skill'
---
No, but the offhand Crul'Shrouk does, LOL. Not that you will ever see that weapon, or get in a guild with TTK low enough where Berserking wins out over +skill.
---
Why? Sulfuras is bis for enhancement shaman until dark edge of insanity. Warriors get a better weapon right from the same boss in form of bonereavers edge. And even then, Ashkandi at the latest is better than sulfuras.
---
But baby, I'm rolling Paladin...
---
Hillsbrad, ofc. The PVP there was immaculate.
---
Ya I keep forgetting all the phases.
---
The original had the Beatles track «yesterday», while showbil the forum posts. That was superior to this version of the video, but I guess copyright strikes or claims made them change it.
---
there are no useless specs. Every spec has some kind of use
---
In the context I used it in, it would be an opinion on blizzard given solely by software developers.
---
I've been tasked with tanking a melee cleave group as a druid by my friends, I know a little about tanking but I mostly played resto. I'm trying to find info or tips on the more advanced mechanics, anyone have advice or a guide I could read?
---
Do you know if fear and seduction are on the same DR in the classic patch?
---
you used it as an adjective now btw
---
You can use [https://www.wowdownrank.com](https://www.wowdownrank.com) to find the HPME of each rank 1 spell with your amount of spellpower. That should give you an idea of what spell is most efficient at each level depending on what you have in your spell book.

They can't, end of argument

But two-hand hits harder?

This subreddit: girlfriend posts are cringe.

Also this subreddit: 1k upvotes for a horde banner that gf makes.

Good god this last month is going to be a long one.
---
Modifying .MPQ files is a bannade offence.
---
Is it just me or are “MEME SPEC TOP DPS” videos just fotm clickbait since so many people want to justify playing these specs ?
---
No offense to your friend he’s a beast, but these keep popping up to give folks false hope.
---
Hm, spellpwoer shaman would likely use mcp, as wf is a fixed % procchance, isn't it?
---
But still, that's basically copying spelladin without SoR, Consecration and judgment.
---
Ron fcked hermione Kappa
---
The trick is to keep prior expacs available and gibing you an option to transfer. They could keep people in the cylcle forever. Imagine having option to play characters on a Vanilla, TBC or Wotlk server. I'd basically never leave my gaming room for the next 30 years.
---
Sadly that might be me. Im gonna sub for the first month and see how it goes. But Im not exactly hard planning on anything, just to damn busy.
---
Chuck Norris can slam a revolving door.
---
Paladins don’t suffer as much because they don’t provide dps in the first place.
---
50% Is 25% more uptime from 40%. That’s significant
---
I mostly agree, not with the easiest part though (e.g. Mage seems way easier than tanking imo) but I do agree it's the most boring role. 
---
I'm inclined to play a DPS Warrior but tanking my way to pre-raid gear just sounds dull. 
---
I'm glad some people enjoy it but in every MMO I try tanking because it's always the least played class and it always just feels boring to me, at least less interesting than the other roles. I think this has as much to do with the lack of tanks generally as the responsibility/leader issue does.
---
Yeah I think it's a nice way for the people who cant be at the funeral to get together and remember him/her
---
I got my 3 characters planned out, questing routes are pretty much locked down from 1-55. 
---
The biggest unknown is running a guild for world economic control/pop amd raiding after about a month or two to allow for me to get my priest done after my rogue.
---
I assume so. The slow will be sufficiently powerful, and if you run around in a wide circle, you should be able to keep the mob within 10 yards of the totem. I don't play shaman though.
---
Not OP, but I would be interested. radiopunkt#1109 on bnet.
---
Sorry, autocorrect doesn’t think “gating” is a word. I meant to say that anathema/benediction would be gated just like TF
---
I plan to start two, one with my SO that had never played wow but wants to try Classic with me, and one on the side if she doesn’t want to play as much as me after a while. Hopefully the first one will be the first to hit 60.
---
Generally you'll want one "main" heal, a small heal and an "oh-shit" heal. You may also want to build a healing set for lower levels that has a lot of int and spirit (if you're levelling shadow spirit works well with spirit tap).
---
Realistically until you start getting +heal items you're going to be using your max rank and the one below of whatever spell
---
Looks alright I guess, bit tattered though.
---
So you don’t have twitch, have a fam, and you still caught wind of the release? And people still make these posts. I’m in the same boat, older now and no relation to retail and I still found out as well. Their target audience is being hit. The main population who will play Classic are the people who have been asking for it for a long time. People thinking they should be blasting out ads are not thinking.
---
You don't need to be fury-prot to tank 5mans and occasionally offtank raids.
---
If anything, not having tactical mastery makes both dps and offtanking clunkier. It's a dedicated high TPS tank spec.
---
You just kinda awnsered your own question there. I would take anything from wowhead with a grain of salt
---
&gt;What classes look like shit

New copypasta
---
I just got a level 21 priest on a pserver this week. I mained priest in TBC, but the aforementioned is all my experience with priests in vanilla.
---
Use your highest level heal spell (AFAIK the highest level one is always the most HPM while leveling). At low levels this is normally heal. Greater heal when you get that.
---
Lesser heal for topping up out of combat where my highest heal would overheal, and for healing DPS, or even renew so you can keep moving. If you have a mage with you or don’t mind keeping a lot of water, I would generally do this, move my priest in between the current team fight and the next group of mobs so I can immediately drink when out of combat.
---
PW:Shield is for emergency on tank/DPS, or for when you anticipate DPS are going to take damage (like sending in the Hunter pet first to the little lasher dudes in WC while everyone burns them down then focuses on the elites). Generally you want to avoid shielding the rage-based tank as they can’t generate rage when the shield is on.
---
The main thing you want to do while healing your tank is loading up your biggest heal and watching their HP. If it’s dropping accordingly to when your heal will go off, let the heal continue. If they’re not taking enough damage, interrupt your heal and immediately recast it to have it loaded up again (I normally interrupt just by tapping strafe).
---
Use flash heal for emergency fast healing as it is very mana intensive.
---
That’s about all I can mention. Make sure while you’re doing nothing and the tank is managing well to be wanding the tank’s mob. If you’re lucky you can get the last hit to activate your spirit buff.
---
Wasn't that the guild where all the hunters named their pet the same as the priest to deliberately fuck with people?
---
Why are Horde players so cringe?
---
I love that the itemization is ultimately "if you know, you know". Anyone can go after Sulfuras, but only people who have been told or who have looked up guides would know that the best shoulders for fury warriors would be a set of leather shoulders from UBRS.
---
The game would be wildly drab if all the best gear was from one or two raids or dungeons per phase. The fact that one piece comes from a long questline in EPL, one comes from a random world drop, and one comes from the final boss of Strat UD makes the content so much more fun.
---
I'm also on the mage train...
---
this makes me want mac and cheese
---
Im going dagger rogue too just not sure if elf or gnome
---
When I was a bit younger I thought this was hilarious as hell. PvP happened on a PvP server and all that. These days I'm a bit more mellow, just feeling a bit bad for the family who didn't get to see the video of the turnout showing how much the player was cared for to its completion. My opinion hasn't really changed overall -- they should have done it somewhere with more control, even if that does limit where they could do it, a bit less symbolic for the girl who died. 
---
Though one thing I always find funny about the video was all the popups of "+honor" they got for killing everyone. Gameplay mechanics are truly ruthlessly heartless.
---
Considering it'll take me ages to level even one -- yes.
---
I recall seeing a priest MC an elite guy in front of Alterac Valley entrance and his cleave did something silly like 3k.
---
11g seems legit
---
Raids may be easier, but finding 40 competent people to run them is harder. Or was, anyhow.
---
Oh shit, I totally forgot about that.
---
Yeah I agree haha. For single player games like.. Subnautica for example, you can have a good experience playing through without looking up guides and looking at a wiki. But it's very normal for someone to start up the game, look in the wiki for the most efficient foods, water, etc etc. The issue is that with online games you don't have the luxury usually to play at your own pace (just the community atmosphere)
---
Eh... I think the itemization in TBC is miles better than vanilla, but oh well.
---
That’s how I felt in Silithus. I farmed those rep sheets for mucho dinero. Also summoned mad elites and solo’d them lol
---
Horde status: BTFO
---
HAHAH
---
I hate pvp now, but I used to be quite a pvpers back in TBC times. I also saw my skill degrade over even a short period of not playing. Have to constantly keep it up. If I wanted to, I'd get back in top shape eventually, but as I said, I can't stand pvp now.
---
Not a big fan of griefing, but I feel a little sorry for those who do! ;)
---
Definitely, I've had so many alts you have no idea how maddening it can be.
---
But this makes the problem of picking the right class so much harder. I don't want to make a rash choice and then spend a year regretting it.
---
You're kind of all over the place, you say that's the standard rate of pay but then you say it's not really, you only make so much because of OT from being shortstaffed.  But you also say theres 200 people working there making that much. 
---
Either way, yeah good situations can be found like that, where for some reason you get lots of OT pay, but tell me this, what is your hourly rate and how much would you make per year with zero OT.
---
I don't have a source right now, but didn't the Devs state that BGs would only be against the own server?
---
Yeah that’s highly probable. I miss the days when companies had (and even made a point of) real effort behind their community management.
---
Of course there are things like best in slots. But I think most people will just enjoy the game and you will be totally fine with just going for the tier sets (as it was back then). Only if you play a spec that is not the mainspec of your classset you have to get creative.
---
I actually dislike the itemization in BfA. I just can't care about items at all in modern wow. To me getting a new item with +5 itemlevel just doesn't feel like progress. Also you usally bring it to the transmog guy asap, besides the minimal plus of your overall gearscore everything feels the same.
---
Holy shit never thought I’d see someone from khadgar
---
Yes it is, because more damage reduction you have more effective Hp you get from each 1% of additional damage reduction. If you have 0% DR, then by adding 1% you get only 1% more effective HP, if you have 98% DR then by adding 1% you double your effective health pool.
---
I see them all over the place. There's always one parked right outside the great seal in zandalar. Always one in mechagon and nazjatar. It's like people buy these things to become vendor NPC's and auctioneers for everyone else.
---
There will probably only be 1 RP PvE server in EU, so I will be on that one. If there's 2, I'll pick the one that has the nicest ring to it.
---
nope, already planning first 4 lol
---
Title may as well be: "opposite gender that the majority of us are attracted to did something related to gaming, upvotes to the left!"

Looks like we found the first ever instance of somebody being carried through nax! He can achieve this again for a small price for 2000 gold to our guild leader. 
---
Thanks
---
This place will be overrun as shit, I'm not even gonna set foot there personally...
---
time and time again during the original era - the horde and alliance are in a state of cold war with a few minor factions in active conflict.
---
yall people need jesus
---
this reddit community has gone to the bin
---
I just remember all pre nerf raids, since PTR didnt test bosses enough and players had no idea what to do.
---
Pre nerf Ragnaros and C'thun were disgusting.
---
Just r8 for me I think. Just need the movement speed bonus and I'm gucci with the rest being PvE gear.
---
General private server consensus is 1 crit = 30 spell, 1 int = 1 spell, and that mp5 becomes mostly useless endgame. So the bracers are basically a push, just as Mish and T3 are basically a push.
---
But I can't see why Amulet of the Fallen God would be ranked over Vek'nilash. Just about every other holy paladin bis sheet also has Fallen God as bis.
---
The other half "I don't think that's funny. At all"
---
She's never played wow on a pvp server. 
---
Seriously though this is always a mixed emotions viewing. But I always watch...
---
Oh yeah, definitely. I think the Classic loot RNG is what you need in PvE to keep the content longer and have it exciting. While in PvP I don't want RNG (which is why Vendors are better) as you fight and compete with people directly.
---
Sometimes the intemization was kinda useless. Their were other cases with item that seemed useless but were pretty OP in the end. Thats the magic of a not 100% fleshed out game
---
From pure pve perspective, yes, you should get sulfuras prio, as it's your bis pve weapon, whereas for warriors it's purely pvp.
---
But keep in mind that Sulfuras is also a prestige weapon and it really depends on your guild whether they go with the traditional method (i.e. giving it to the person willing to farm and who deserves the prestige) or the person who would gain a pve boost from that. And you plan on playing enhance in raids, which is even among the suboptimal specs on the weaker side. you also want to nightfall as well. Those may be more reasons for the guild to not see a point in giving you sulfuras.
---
That said, I wouldn't recommend nightfalling as an enhancement shaman. Enhance has a by far worse uptime on the debuff than any other class able to use 2h axes.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/398065947?t=2590s
---
This shows how easily rogues can be seen. Mind you all rogues in TBC arena are Sub Hemo spec with 5/5 MoD. If you go back to about 10:02 you see his detection vs a druid who doesn’t have improved stealth.
---
Umm, and why should tanks use sulfuras when not tanking instead of, you know, Nightfall?
---
Oh, you can tank them juuust fine... for a while. In fact, it's the only thing you can do!
---
Shaman is probably the most in-demand horde class.
---
I work for Fedex and started by loading trailers for 5 years.  We pay these people a competitive salary (though the positions themselves are mainly part time) due to that exact fact, that they are physically grueling and not easy.  But 50k a year for what you described just seems ludicrous, but after you said it's from the OT where you make the money it makes more sense.
---
My point is that most jobs like what you are describing do not pay that well and it's not a real reflection of what you would normally make.  That's why I asked how much you would make without OT.  ( I dont really care, I was just trying to make the point)
---
Have you gone to the website and enabled participation in the beta tick box
---
Haha that's the trick I guess. I'll exactly do it like this:
---
1) Hope there is only 1 german Realm
---
2) if 1) doesn't apply - Check the german Classic Discord/Forum to see where people want to flood the Realm.
---
3) Be on the wrong Realm and switch after 3 days
---
&gt; Of course some random ass will trash the event.
---
The difference is this wouldn’t happen IRL because disrespecting a group of grieving people would have actual consequences.
---
I'm not commenting on whether it was likely to happen or not. In my opinion 99% of simliar event weren't disrupted and while you can say they could have expected the worst scenario to happen and say they were a bit naive, it doesn't change my point:
---
Why do you think it's hilarious?
---
Like I said, it's the level of humour of prank videos: people being asshole on camera and doing awful things because it's unexpected. Do you like this kind of "humour"?
---
I’ve worked at UPS offloading trailers and while I’ll agree that it’s a pretty physically demanding job, it wasn’t as hard as what I do now, the days were shorter, and it wasn’t an overnight job, so I guess all of that plays into it. Shipping is totally different then distribution, especially when you start dealing with refrigeration units and shit. There’s a lot of regulations which create a bunch of extra work on top of the manual labor aspects of it.
---
Bosses don't respawn, but Mizzle the Crafty will disappear in less than an hour. He's the guy that gives you the gordok king buff, which you need to get raidbuffs from talking to each Gordok guard boss.
---
yeah, locked behind real or metaphorical gates (the gates in this case being phases of content)
---
Thanks, I agree
---
you and me both
---
Now THAT was a funeral.
---
That's my thought. I mean the issue with shaman is mana and debuff slots, not something BiS will fix.

There's a difference between having bad itemization and having [Boots of the Elements.](https://classicdb.ch/?item=16670)

Hi, /u/Auglyn

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cj8lxb/consequences_of_ganking_lowbies_in_classic_wow/). 
---
People rolling ret are relying on Esfand and McConnell in the first place.
---
So listening to this I realized something i misheard YEARS ago, and it's the line "Strength. Honor. I see them in you."
---
Back in the day I misheard this and legit thought he said "Strength. Honor. I've seen the menu." and it always struck me as weird that he seemed so dismissive of new heroes, like he had "Seen it all" in different people and wasn't impressed by your approach. "Seeing the menu" would then be the same as "I've seen the qualities you proclaim before, why do you consider yourself more than others?". 
---
But yeah I was wrong all those years ago. Guess it happens when you're 12, english isn't your main language and you kind of fill in the blanks.
---
yeah, for example teaming up with a buddy that's farming ore or something in the world is perfect. You party up, you clear whatever you want in the instance, you leave party and re-invite -&gt; it's refreshed. And your buddy isn't impacted other than beeing your party bitch.
---
seems you do not comprehend what i wrote but that is fine... every now and then there are simpletons who speak before thinking...
---
And bosses do have a respawn timer however it is rediculously long, no one waits to re-kill and that is not what i wanted to have it tested for but rather how long it is possible to keep a dungeon like TRibute cleared for looking aside from the trash spawns.
---
Yes, it's when you kill a boss.
---
That's not quite it though. Current wow has bad loot too, doesn't make the good one better. What makes vanilla itemization great, is the unique items. The good one is not good because it has 10% more stats, but it does something different. Also things like hit/def cap means some items become, or stop being bis when you swap your other items, so it is more interesting than "bigger ilvl is better".
---
Me not that kind of orc
---
People were mourning a real person who really died. The ceremony might have happen online but it's not like their feeling were virtual like the pedestrian in GTA.
---
Don't you understand the problem is not the killing of online avatar but the fact that those people thought it would be a cool idea to bother and anger people mourning?
---
It's like saying that online bullying is not bullying because it's online and not real life
---
To add on to the many other posts above me: 
---
Str+Stam Mail (Pre40-45) = AH
---
Agi+Stam Leather = AH  
---
Str+Stam Leather = AH  
---
Int+Stam / Int+Spirit = AH   
---
++AGI / ++INT / ++STR / ++SPI / ++STA -- AH after doing research. 
---
In general, most classes prioritize 2 stats, and all of the combos of those stats I listed above. There may be one or two I've forgotten (didn't play a lot of melee, so I probably missed one or two there).
---
So all of the weird combos (like + Agility / + Spirit) just aren't going to be prioritized by most players because they'd rather have a better combo of their 2(or 3) preferred stats. 
---
Warlocks and Warriors are the only two weird ones that come to mind that break that trend. Some warriors will do a Str/Spirit build that lets them regen loads of health outside of combat. Warlocks are weird because they have 3 main stats (Stam/Int/Spir) instead of the normal 2 for casters -- Int/Spir. Since Health==Mana+survival they value Stam  much higher than other casters. 
---
Anyway, there will surely be an AuctionHouse mod you can install that will tell you whether or not to do that thing, just wanted to shed some light on the reasoning behind it all (as poorly as I may have done so). 
---
Cheers bud.

Oh but the [drama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYSSiHh9ShU) never went away ;o

I would add Loatheb to this list. It’s also worth noting some trash pulls are harder than bosses
---
I swear, people are so blinded by nostalgia and a disdain for Blizzard that they're misremembering things. Look up the old models again, they look like emotionless pixelated potatoes. I know these things can be kind of subjective but I don't see how the new models aren't a MAJOR upgrade over the old ones.
---
Note, I'm not saying that the new models don't need improvements (night elf eyebrows anybody?) But when compared to the old ones they're an obvious improvement.
---
ALL THE FUCKING PEOPLE WHINE ABOUT RP-PVP WHEN IN REALITY NOBODY REALLY ROLE-PLAYS THE GAME! ALL THE FUCKING PRETENTIOUS MORONS EVEN THINK PVP IS THE ONLY SERVER TYPE THAT CAN BE ENJOYED. JUST STOP FUCKING ADVERTISING HOW FUCKING GOOD YOU ARE GANKING LOWBIES BECAUSE YOU FAIL IN REAL PVP ON THE BATTLEGROUNDS YOU FUCKING MORONS!

I know it could be suggested that what these people did were; nasty/unsympathetic/in bad taste, but think about how long this has been remembered for, this person has been immortalised by this event. If there was an after life and he/she could see the result and people Still! debating it today, they would be smiling, I know I would!
---
No. I did not bother because it’s fanboy bullshit. Even Boralus is dead compared to what Ironforge was. At best i can find 20 people lmao. Even in Zandalar on Draenor i can find 30 people pretty much all cross realm.
---
Queues for pvp and pve take longer than ever before. Even a basic island expedition for 3 people of any kind takes a solid 10 minutes lmfao. Mate it doesn’t take a genius. Wow is dead. Not even Vanilla can save wow. While it’s way better than retail everyone moved on and got a live by now. Besides it looks crap and everything is just so boring compared to fortnite and any other games really.
---
When you have a job you want a game to relax not a job simulator. Wow will sadly never be a popular game again. And back in the day it only was because gaming was popular only among nerds. As we see now when gaming is mainstream actual fun games pop up such as fortnite. Not this grind for 100 hours to get fuck all.
---
You can't raidstack to that extreme without running 2-3 splits.
---
How do you plan on gearing those 10+ warriors and 13 mages with the drops that are available, while you have warlock, druid, hunter etc gear just being disenchanted.
---
Wait, what? So with MC gear, SF pulls ahead, but in between falls behind again? The critchance threshold would be nice to know! If you find out, would you let me know please?  :)
---
Dragonblight EU here!
---
Thank you man! That's perfect. Legend.
---
&gt;I suppose for paladin it'd be self bubble and **heartstone**, blessing of protection/freedom/sacrifice. Which all make the paladin the incredibly good support class it is, especially in pvp.
---
"Too big for kodos"
---
Lazy peon it is.
---
When you have a really hard day and want to play wow to relax and you get gank 10 time this is bullying too :(
---
Some times I play arena and get killed and loose the match my opponent are bullying me :(
---
Omg people are so mean :(
---
Yo dawg you have some many bags in your bags.
---
The thing is a number of people won't even understand it until something similar happens to them.
---
How would they feel if their best buddy that the knew only online passed away and they couldn't due to distance etc attend their funeral but the possibility of it being done online allows those they knew online to come closer to closure.
---
Such a toxic raidleader, would this stand in today's age ? Would people play with a person like this leading them ?
---
As a ret paladin, I want to go for rank 10, becuase 2 pieces of the pvp set is really good gear till phase 5 and especially in the shoulder slot nothing gets close to the rank 10 shoulders.
---
Technically adding in the rank 12 gauntlets and leggings would also be a noticeable improvement, but I feel that's just too far out of reach to get for me.
---
Lol fuck you retard. Can't even 1v1 me. U just gotta cry for your jungler to gank you cause ur bad. LOL MAD ? Yikes. REPORT THIS IDIOT. WTF IS MY TEAM DOING. ok gg retards im afk. GG EZ GG EZ GG EZ.

How can you regret playing this garbage, game after game, season after season ?
---
EU RP-PvP server.
---
Don't give a damn beyond that.
---
So? They still gathered for him, which is the point and Serenety Now just acted realistically within the game, albeit with bad manners. For all we know the guy who died might have found it hilarious also.
---
Death contains much more than sorrow, it contains humor, celebration of the person, memories and such. Me and my father played "always look at the bright side of life" at my mother's funeral for that exact reason. Death and grief is absurd, and treating it as purely sorrow is missing the point.
---
Yes a PvE server :)
---
I can see why you never responded to my other comment on this thread. Get bent muppet.
---
Still better than waste 3h for your perfect prot warrior that will never come cause he doesn't care about 5man.
---
Yeah and  Devouring Plague gets dispelled.  Will of the Forsaken is useful in only a handful of situations, since warlocks are fewer on alliance side, and the 2 other fearing classes needs to get in range to fear you.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but don't you need the bank alt to be atleast lvl 35 to fully level up alchemy? (or any other skill)
---
Nothing beats entering Orgrimmar, pc freezes and 30 secs later it unfreezes and you are running towards a wall at the bank 😂
---
It happened on pservers as well. Like I said, even though shamans are one of the most played classes, they are still in demand.
---
Chuck Norris challenged Lance Armstrong to a "Who Has The Most Testicles" competition. Chuck won by three.
---
Chuck Norris does not teabag people, he potato-sacks them.
---
But they also have higher gear competition.
---
But still the most valid point is, be in time and prepared and everybody will love you
---
This answer doesn't even make sense....
---
Or in an area that wouldn't have faced such a disruption. This guy is fucking clown shoes and gas lights like a bitch.
---
Yes, I didn't know about the existance of these and many others.
---
I think the only regular armor-item, except of trinkets, rings and weapon with bonus-armor that I had were my shoulder-pads, that had about double of what regular leather-shoulders of the same level had.
---
I alwayes eyed how much armor certain pieces had. And from the content we mostly did it was rare to come across over items with highly elevated armor-values. I remember seeing much more of that once we did AQ20.
---
You mean the past right?
---
back in vanilla days the top guild on our server did both hwl farming and pve content. they would give HoR to enhance shamans and throw them in the hwl premade. I remember being so jealous seeing the couple of them that had it
---
Well, good luck! I’d be up for it if you managed to get it up and running 🤘🏻
---
I tried to run nef on my 120 pala and died at the egg boss because I couldn‘t remember what to do. So hard I guess?
---
Pls be gently that was meant to be a joke
---
You have to use different levels of the same spell in order to save mana. Power word shield is only used when you think they will die before you can get the next heal off otherwise the mana is better spent on a healing spell also tanks hate it when you shield them in classic btw so don’t unless they ask you to or a boss calls for you to(can’t remember if there was but I’m sure there is atleast one where you have to). It’s a lot of  lesser heals and renew that lower levels.
---
Whatever you do, just focus on healing the tank (pretty much ignore the dps mostly, keep them alive, but they DONT need to be full health) and try to go as long as possible while not casting at all (5s regen rule). When you DO heal, do multiple casts in combo, like max rank effective heal that will heal to tank full HP and throw a renew on him on top of that. Then wait until he gets low enough that your biggest heal will fill his HP bar \~fully.
---
Renew isnt that great hpm (heal per mana), but combined with big, efficient heals and out of the 5s rule regen, its worth it. The idea is that renew heals the tank a little so the time between your big heal casts is maximized. And as a priest, STACK SPIRIT. Dont cast renew on anyone other than the tank. Shield should be casted only when you are literally out of options. Its HORRIBLE hpm, (warrior/druid) tanks dont like it because it prevents rage gain.
---
And when the tank starts getting lower, precast the big heal (use addon called HEALCOMM to show you how much will the heal actually heal) and cancel it before casting if it heals more than tank to the max. Keep precasting and canceling until you can actually get max usage of the heal.
---
Additionally if you are at MAX mana, put a new renew on the tank, so you arent losing regen time. Even if most of the renew ticks doesnt even heal him, its better for you to lose bit of mana and regen it back than sitting at full mana while tank doesnt get any heals.
---
Optimally you will do Heal+renew... wait until renew is dropping off. If tank is taking less damage than the biggest heal, you might consider doing lesser heal + renew. But usually its biggest heal+renew and about 10-12 seconds later you need to cast another combo. But it means you have gotten 5-7 seconds of full regen between the casts. All of that 10-12s you should be WANDING your ass off to the lowest target. Try to get spirt tap talent procs to futher increase your regen.
---
Following this style, you can go through nearly all of the trash packs without breaks so you will only need to drink after bossfights. In bossfights usually you will have to heal a lot more so conserving mana really isnt a option. Still, same basics apply.
---
This make sense nobody will come to kill you because you cannot and guess what stranger doesn't give a f about your friend dying...
---
If I had a dead friend I won't make any post on reddit or make a public funeral this is next level karma whoring...
---
Any event on game it's karma whoring and stupid if intended to be "serious" and equivalent to RL, yes. Funeral, weddings or grandma birthday.
---
Lmao "Wait and ask if they're going to mine that node" Bro ima be yoinking that instantly,
---
That's not true. I re-installed Bnet launcher last night after building a new PC. The option to download classic was there and I haven't been invited to either the beta or stress test.
---
Mine is Tanaris, that's the first time I felt like I was at a "high level". Also loved the zone for what is was and I've so many fond memories of the place.
---
I would love to see Northrend connected via long-ass bridges to either continent.
---
Thank you very much! :)
---
Yep. I used to enjoy Barrens chat back in the day, to a certain degree. On pservers now it is the worst thing ever.
---
I'm not aware of anytest results specifically, but the current expectation is that nothing scales except for lifesteal procs.
---
Beta didn't have any lifesteal procs avaialble (lowest one requires lvl 44) and there were also no endgame relevant items with procs available.
---
What we know is that fixed bonuses don't scale (eg rwhlep gloves or weapons with +1-x shadow dmg)
---
I didn't really have time for alts for a long time in vanilla wow, and I imagine it will be the same with classic. There is so much to do, and I don't like playing alts while I still have options on my main.
---
Pretty much this.
---
Honourable mention for gluth and viscidous.
---
This is why Night elf &gt; dwarf priest.
---
Sorry Dwarves. Fear ward is great and all but the satisfaction you get from it is nothing like basking in the rage your victims will feel being mind controlled to their deaths by a priest they couldn't even know was there.
---
Also to contribute a MC spot - outside the BRD entrance, throwing people into the lava.
---
Those items make it feel like an actual RPG. In old school CRPGs like Baldurs Gate you'd sometimes get items with a certain effect and they'd remain relevant for the whole game. I get why Blizzard is trying to move away from that sort of thing, but it makes them special.

---
Make sure you contact Vordel throught discord after you made your application, for a brief interview may be necessary.
---
[https://discord.gg/Ccgw74n](https://discord.gg/Ccgw74n)
---
You're making jumps in logic based on datasets/results that don't actually apply to the scenario that you're (trying) to apply them to. You shouldn't extrapolate/interpolate values in this case, especially since it's been established that it isn't beyond Blizzard to throw in random hard-coded modifiers, or have equations that only hold true within a given bounds.
---
Until they actually test each specific level of weapon skill no definitive conclusions can actually be made. They've tested +5 weapon skill (and have data around that value) and that's perfectly fine, but until they test +8 and +10 (and + any other combination) it's speculation based on numbers posted over a decade ago on a site that could be freely edited without a supporting data-set.
---
If you hold the 'Beaza' numbers to be the absolute truth and using the following 'caps' (for the softcap)
---
+ Low end: 1.3 - 0.05 * (defense-skill) capped at 0.91
---
+ High end: 1.2 - 0.03 * (defense-skill) capped at 0.99
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
This would mean that
---
+ 308 weapon skill is the point where you could not negate the 'glancing damage' penalty any further
---
+ You'd always assume that glancing hits only deal 91% of their white-hit potential (the low end) no matter how much more weapon skill you obtained for any theorycrafting on performance (i.e. the people who are pedantic about spreadsheet DPS).
---
Edgemaster's Handguards (obviously not usable by a Rogue) give +7 skill and their low-end value would be 90% (of their white hit potential), and given that moving from +7 to +8 (if the cap is valid) only shifts them from 90% to 91% (of their white hit potential) seems to be a fairly reasonable stat allocation.
---
Like I said to somebody else who said the same exact thing: if you think that online funeral are stupid and karma whoring then you reaction that it's hilarious is sad but logic.
---
I work shifts, so this is definitely something I'd be interested in!
---
Now I want to know if mind controlled people could use portals from the opposite faction?
---
Rogue will never be easier than priest
---
I’m not sure what you mean? Didn’t play cata. Started in vanilla went to the end of wrath. I just have realistic expectations on my time now that I’m older.
---
There is a enormous difference between a real wedding and an in-game wedding where everyone is aware of the context. Again, if they didn't want it to happen they could have just held it in a friendly zone. I didn't hold my parents funeral in a busy shopping mall and yell at kids to be quiet, context matters.
---
your priest mechanics are probably bad then
---
Never ever am i going to run a Pug, in Classic, with 40 random peoples.  
---
Maybe fill up the raid with 1 to 5 people, but thats it.  
---
40 random people, all claiming they know the mechanics, is just a wild gues.  
---
Just going with my Guild, where i can rely o the 40 people.  
---
And a minumum to meme specs ( 1 enhanc and 1 boomkin)
---
You're right. It's even the case on the 'more hardcore' private servers.
---
Where are those millions of alts that people have? Let's assume that their max lvls are in Boralus or w/e, even thos pics from Boralus from many realms, show empty deserts at peak hours.
---
But where are lvl 50s? Lvl 70s? Lvl 90s? 100s? Where are those toons? Everyone in BfA have multiple alts, and a lot of people gave 10+ alts. 
---
It's been a year now of EMPTY areas and cities, across the old AND new zones, exception being the first 2 weeks of a new patch and the first 2 weeks of the new raid.
---
Don't try to minimize the disastrous numbers of BfA, which is probably around 2 million subs, with less than 200k active players, coming up with stupid excuses.
---
Except a handful of realms, all the other 500+ are empty AF. And not because of sharding, but because NOBODY is playing BfA. Well, not nobody, by 200k players is basically nobody for what WoW was.
---
You want me to make preparations for your requiem?
---
***&lt;Trouble&gt; [EU-Horde-PvP]*** is a community-driven, progression-focused, English-speaking raiding guild. We've been playing online games together for upwards of 15 years, and we've picked up a whole bunch of great players and good friends along the way. We have a wide array of players from all across Europe, and beyond, with varying different levels of experience. 
---
We have players who have reached high heights in both PvE and PvP across various expansions, but also others that have never even played vanilla WoW before. With this in mind, we are creating an inclusive guild where everyone is welcome, as long as they're enthusiastic and willing to play with us to the best of their ability.
---
***Leveling*** - 
---
There will be no rush to level 60. We will begin raids as soon as we have the force to do so, but if it takes you a couple of weeks longer than other people, nobody cares. You will probably be able to join the early birds once you get there. Take your time; enjoy the experience. 
---
***Raiding*** - 
---
We will be raiding two nights a week (all times are in **Server Time (CET)**):
---
**Sunday 8:00-11:30 PM**
---
**Tuesday 8:00-11:30 PM**
---
Come Phase 3 (BWL), an additional raid night will be added to revisit older raid tiers:
---
**Wednesday 8:00-11:30 PM**
---
All participants are expected to bring their own consumables. You don't have to be doing top tier DPS/HPS, but you do need to respect the rest of the guild enough to bring what you need to be functional in a raid.
---
**Loot System** - 
---
Our loot system will be a very simple, closed bid DKP system with partial decay to help deter hoarding. Name a more iconic duo than loot council and drama.
---
When the third raid day is introduced in Phase 3 (BWL), it is worth noting that it will NOT use the DKP system, and all items will be rolled (main-spec priority, as usual) between raiders who want them. The reason for this is that a lot of people in the guild can only raid two days a week, tops, and they should not feel like they have to come to this raid in order to keep up on DKP for the main tier raids.
---
**Classes** - 
---
Like any other guild, we would prefer the dominant classes with meta specs. However, we do believe that the player comes above the class and spec in a lot of circumstances. If you're dedicated, positive and willing to listen, those things go an exceptionally long way.
---
With that in mind, we are willing to give most people a shot, with the caveat that those classes and specs with a generally weak performance may find it harder to earn a permanent raid spot. If you are very confident in your ability to play an off-meta spec that isn’t listed below to an acceptable level, feel free to contact us:
---
**Druid** - **OPEN (Restoration)** //
---
**Hunter** - **OPEN (Marksmanship)** //

**Mage** - **OPEN (Frostbolt spam)** //

---
**Shaman** - **OPEN (Restoration)** //
---

---

I play horde on private server to keep alliance fresh for classic and fuck I want it.
---
First of all, not all kids require the same amount of care depending on their age. Secondly, a lot of households with small children/newborns tends to have two parents. In that case they might have a system that makes the WoW player in the household to have 2-3 evenings free of work. That could be a system were the WoW player does most of the tasks before 7 (picking up from school, making dinner, driving kids to activities), and maybe do extra those evenings the guild doesn't raid.   
---
What I'm baffled about in general is how hard it seems it is for "new parents" to manage their time. I have so many friends with one child that whine about everything, and has to make a point about them having a child if you ask them anything. Example: "Hey, wanna go for a swim next week?" "dude, like common man, I have a child and shit, cant be swimmin', don't have time. There is just no time".   
---
So, the best advice is to either plan your time. Figure out what you can do in order to free up a few evenings pr. week. If you can't, well then don't raid, don't play WoW. Stop complaining!
---
Absolutely no adult with job or family or social life.

Harrys parents dies.
---
I honestly cannot believe someone would do this and admit they are simply assholes when people are trying to pay respects to someone who actually passed away. Don't get me wrong I'm all about laughing and having fun but there are limits... They even said they wanted to create a video to show the family I mean wtf...

Gold has a direct impact on your gear from obviously buying crafted gear to buying your way into raids this “in so far behind it doesn’t matter” is 
---
A. Laughable 
---
B. Just shits on the spirit of vanilla. 
---
You are the exact type of player retail is tailored for
---
Man just seeing the only stats of your character be Agility, Stamina, Armour is just so depressing.
---
&gt; I do not support flying mounts and never will. I assume many others agree with me.
---
I think flying mounts have it's place. It's the "take of from anywhere, go anywhere" that cheapens the game. 
---
If you could only take of from a "stables" building (i.e. a type of flightmaster) I think it could sorta work in specific zones.

**EU Horde PVP Leveling Partner Shaman/Priest**  
---
Hi,   
---
I'm taking two weeks of vacation upon launch and I'm rolling a Warrior.  
---
I'm looking for a Shaman/Priest to duo level fast and then continue to farm together.  
---
It would probably be beneficial if you have a similar schedule in mind and can dedicate a lot of time during the first week or two. My current plan is doing a 24h session on launch, followed by 16-18 hour days the first week.  
---
Please reach out to me if you're planning to play Priest or Shaman and find my proposal interesting.
---
U mad bro?
---
WOTLK was 50% good, 50% the beginning of the end.  
---
I would love to play proper Ulduar again without a fucking ToC coming in, destroying progress and being a really shitty instance.

#  &lt;Singularity&gt;
---
**About Us:** On the spectrum from Casual Raiders to Hardcore Raiders, we are positioned somewhere in the middle. We will strive to be the most efficient raiding guild on the server to minimize the weekly time commitment for our members. Many of our founding members have been raiding in WoW since 2004. We are also an avid World PVP guild that will plan weekly events to put our hard-earned epics to good use. In terms of server location, we plan to be on a US East PvP server to provide reasonable ping to North American and European members alike.
---
**Loot System:** Loot Council. With a specific emphasis on rewarding high performing dedicated players to drive rapid progression. Additional measures are in place for fairness and to reward up-and-comers.
---
**Raid Times:** Will be Saturday &amp; Sunday morning from 9:00 AM - 11:00 AM Eastern Time. Once we have MC &amp; Ony on farm, we will be able to get this down to a single day, two-hour commitment per week.
---
We are currently recruiting all classes with an emphasis on ranged DPS and heals (shamans in particular), but all are welcome.
---
**To Apply:** [https://singularity.guildlaunch.com/](https://singularity.guildlaunch.com/)
---
If you have any questions please contact me or you can contact Silverback#8426 or BuffGamer#3520 on discord.

Agree. Seeing skull mobs was so exciting. My first encounter was running north in redridge seeing some demons or whatever when crossing the border to the burning steppes.
---
Girl: Me and friends want icecream  
---
Mom: No, but if enough of you really want it, ill go buy some  
---
Wow community: Everything is bad, leeway, layering, hunters, bugs, no advertisement, loot trading, progressive itemization, wrong sound when you shoot a bow.  
---
Mom: Shit ! Okay kids, i dont have time to go buy icecream. Maybe later.
---
Haha haven't watched this for a while. Well within their rights.
---
🤷 Did not realize this post would piss people off so much. I was just pumped with how the banner came out, and this subreddit was where he suggested I post it.
---
I honestly used to think it was like troll pve and ud PvP. But there was a great post a few days ago that laid out an amazing argument for why you should always take troll even if your shadow. Also I enjoy their casting animations.
---
I think alot of people are gonna be disappointed/don't know what they're getting into with regards to a druid. I've been testing different builds on a private server to make up my mind, and while I thought I was doing "okay" as a high-effort somewhat geared feral druid I then went in as a starting.gear elemental shaman and stomped people left and right using 3 buttons.
---
But still gonna try to stick with it, too bored of pure and simpler classes even if it gimps me.
---
Currently going for 1/29/21, best mix of role variety as well as PvP utility.
---
Chuck Norris' tears can cure cancer.  Too bad he never cries.
---
Maybe! I was 10 when classic came out so it's a little blurry.
---
As someone who played League since beta, I can tell you that there is very little left from the original release.
---
S1 and whatever it's on right now are as similar as classic and retail.
---
&gt;  And as a priest, STACK SPIRIT. 
---
This is terrible advise, at least until high levels. 1 point of INT gives you flat 15 mana. For most of your leveling life this is much more useful than the additional regeneration the small amount of SPI on low level gear gives you. 
---
For dungeon healing, that is. There might be a case for SPI when it comes to more efficient grinding.
---
For example, let's compare 2 cloth chest pieces that can be worn at lvl 19: 
---
(1) Corsair Overshit (11 SPI, 5 STAM)
---
(2) Tree Bark Jacket (10 INT, 6 STA)
---
(1) Increases by ~3 per tick.
---
(2) Gives you 150 additional mana
---
Which would you rather have as a healer in, say, BFD - considering that there won't even be that much regeneration happening during a fight.
---
What is “a mechanic”?
---
They’re in the beta/stress tests
---
That's my plan also. I'll wait until DM:E is out and I can farm with a priest.
---
Of all the things going on in the world, not experiencing a fake launch of a 15 year old game should be the last thing to cause someone anxiety
---
And you’re point is the public are entitled to have no respect for the dead? Easily the most morally bankrupt and fucked argument one could make.
---
A normal-difficulty raid in pretty much any expansion since the end of MoP is easier than a spaghetti-damned quest in vanilla.
---
I feel like ya'll are giving Women Shouldn't Vote Productions entirely too much credit.
---
That's you mate haven't you heard
---
Meld also adds to stealth in vanilla, so that your harder to detect. In fact, as much as people harp on how good pvp racials are for horde. Rogues are actually weaker on horde vs alliance. the perception ability on humans makes it really hard to sneak up on you, and is useable while stealthed, and nelf rogues will usually see you first.
---
(I can confirm from woes of arena players in TBC private servers on the pvp part)
---
**&lt;Rapid Evolution&gt; OCE - PvP - Committed Casual** 
---
**Rapid Evolution** was an original hardcore vanilla PvP and raiding guild on Frostmourne(A) that is making a comeback for Classic WoW, though this time **For The Horde!**. The core of the guild are all vanilla veterans and would love to find some old vanilla friends, though we welcome all that wish to join us. 
---
As 13 years has passed since RE first grinded through the PvP ranks and raid content, we expect Classic to be a little bit more casual and relaxed. We harbour no dreams of server domination but we will be pushing through all that classic has to offer and reliving the vanilla experience.
---
**Raid Schedule**
---
We will be raiding 2 nights per week, 
---
Monday and Thursday evening 8pm - 11pm AEST. 
---
As we will only be raiding 2 nights a week we plan to pack as much action with a little downtime as possible so we will expect those that wish to raid to be well prepared and reliable. 
---
**Loot Distribution**
---
We will be using a combination of EPGP and Loot Council
---
**Recruitment**
---
We are welcoming all to join us for Classic WoW - though please note that we have no raid spot availability for Enhancement Shaman, Shadow Priest or Main Tank as these roles have been filled! We would love more primary dps to join us as we continue to fill out our raid roster. As we only have a few select raid positions locked in so far, if you you are active and reliable you will give yourself the best chance of securing a raid spot with us. 
---
While we don't expect to participate in the High Warlord grind this time around, I'm sure many will be PvPing regularly, particularly large scale world PvP!
---
Come, Join our discord and introduce yourself! 
---
[https://discord.gg/s2ymuX6](https://discord.gg/s2ymuX6)
---
I guy that fixes cars and other stuff
---
That’s ok you’ll still equip it because the only metric to get into stuff (except perhaps the very top end, as it’s not automated) is itemlvl, not merit.
---
I am, but you're going to need to be OCE (and alliance) for that to even matter.
---
It's also going to have a very relaxed time-line (compared to the majority), so whilst I can promise your opportunity that's still subject to getting enough people onboard.
---
Its what you do on boss besides DPSing. One of the most simple and used mechanics is "don't stay in shit"
---
Well I can’t really be telling people that in a subject called “Etiquette and Courtesy” now can I?
---
&gt; considering that there won't even be that much regeneration happening during a fight?
---
It really depends how you actually play. If you just spamspamspam, obviously you want to have int. But if you play smart, you can regen ALL the mana used in trash. Guess why the instance melee grind groups want a priest ? Because its the only healer class that can go without drinking.
---
And its sure as fuck isnt because he has so much int, that he never runs out of mana.
---
People underestimate the power of spirit all the time, so if you dont believe me, i really dont care. You can keep playing the way you prefer.

---
Depends on who you ask. People tend to look at difficulty based on their subjective experience. In the case of Classic, most people active in forums today are experienced players, hardcore players, players that never raided in Vanilla past MC and 20 man raids, Retail players, and very small minority if players that raided in Vanilla and on pservers, in various guilds.
---
The vast majority of forum users will say that Classic raiding will be a joke, because they, personally, experienced it as easy. Or because they are Retail players and the simple mechanics of Classic raids compared to Retail are a joke. Or because they have seen videos of a top guild steamrolling in Naxx. Or because BiS twinks clearing SM Cath in beta.
---
The Classic player base will be pretty much like this : 10% hardcore players, 10-20% semi-hardcore and the rest 70-80% casuals. Realistically speaking, the first 10% will have zero challenge in Classic. They will be farming MC to Naxx with ease. The following 10-20% will still be hardcore enough to make it past AQ40 and clear Naxx, even if not with same ease as the first 10%.
---
And than comes the 70-80% casual players. They can be the most skilled players on Earth, they won't go past BWL, and this is because they lack organization and commitment. They will be clearing and farming Ony, MC, ZG and AQ20, with their guilds, or in PuGs. They will attempt BWL, but they will not clear it even 1 year after BWL is open.
---
Vanilla raiding is not mechanically hard, but becomes extremely hard in BWL if the entire raid is not on point. You cannot afford failures in BWL. You can afford failures in MC and ZG, because those raids were designed for casual players.
---
It doesn't matter than we can play today with 60-120 FPS and exceptionally low latency. It doesn't matter that we know all the encounters in detail. It doesn't matter if the mechanics are simple : most players will not clear BWL, because what matters is guild organization and coordination, which most players, being casual, will not have.
---
I cannot compare Vanilla raiding with current Retail system of raiding difficulties. What I can safely say is that the majority of players in Classic will not clear BWL.
---
cross realm will happen it is already decided and stated by blizz

**&lt;One Up&gt; Semi-Hardcore NA-PVP Alliance**

---
Raid Information: Raid times will be 8:00-11:30 EST Tuesday/Thursday. We firmly believe that all 40 man content can be cleared in two days. With that being said we may add a third night to progression weeks in order to speed up the farm process if necessary. 20 Mans Will be done on off nights weekly.

THEN HANG IT ABOVE THEIR BATTLESTATION AND POST WITH THE TITLE “READY FOR CLASSIC”. HAVENT SEEN ANY POSTS LIKE THAT IN AT LEAST 4 SECONDS.
---
did someone say thunderfury...
---
&gt;There's a big difference indeed but the concept is the same:
---
I mean, sure the concept is the same, but as said the context is fundamentally different, which is the whole reason I don't see these players as assholes. One is real life and private, the other is virtual and public. If people in the virtual world feel disrupted they can just log off and either create new characters in a friendly zone to continue the symbolic ceremony or just continue on the voice-chat. The same is not available in real life. 
---
It's your opinion that they are assholes and it's unfunny, but that is in no way some objectively "correct" moral opinion (not that mine is either, and not like objective morality exist regardless). The humor comes from the juxtaposition of the music/actions with the seriousness of the ceremony on one hand, and on the other hand for pulling back the curtain on the absurdity of having such a ceremony within a game, expecting a absolute seriousness in a context which is far from it (it's a game, it's fun). To me this is a large difference from prank videos, which basically just exist to annoy people, this is an almost Nietzschean critique of actions within a virtual world if you will.
---
Its so watered down its insane...
---
From an individuals point of view, none, there is no fight that requires you to be do anything flawlessly or you wipe, the difficulty would come on some fights of managing 40 people.
---
Paladins are not tanks. Go holy.
---
Ok so here is something fun from my past...
---
I used to have such bad FPS in major cities that I turned click to move on, because right clicking to move meant that even with 1-3 FPS I would eventually get to where I needed to be accurately without having to use movement keys.
---
I still use click to move even to this day, its a quirk which has kept with me since late 2005. Although today I use it mainly as a way to auto auto / fly whilst tabbed out. But still, that's where I first started using it all those years ago!
---
I still don't get how everyone had issue finding her... Right along the road, right at a little bend... In a hut.
---
Learn to abuse 5 sec rule. And heal only what needs to be healed (the dps can eat between pulls if needed).
---
You're right, but not because the content was mechanically difficult, but you need a certain gear level to do higher bosses, and most players don't have the time to invest.
---
We gave two HoR to our top consumable contributors, which both happened to be paladins. The reward system can be different from guild to guild. There are also some slam PvE spec’ed warriors who may be interested in this hammer.
---
Looks good, easy to read. For additions maybe add AEP/MAEP values, then maybe a filter option so people can sort what is best overall vs individual stat gain etc
---
Vietna... Strangelthorn Vale!
---
Teldrassil, a hundred times.
---
It's a good thing for newer players who join late.
---
Mage for portals isn't a bad idea. 
---
Honestly I'd just pick whatever class you plan on eventually bringing to 60. 
---
At 35 you can get the cooldowns on professions (like Alch/Tailoring)
---
Well mc and onyxia are going to be piss easy.
---
It becomes more difficult after that.
---
But it is nowhere near the mythic level of difficulty in modern wow.
---
The thing is vanilla raid fights as well tbc (a large majority) were not difficult in terms of the sheer number if mechanics that have to be executed by everyone. The difficulty lies with how punishing the mechanics were.
---
Sure there are some fights that are quite complex but for the majority they are not. To compare it, take a boss from modern wow and check his abilities in the journal, you know how each ability has a small label as to how dangerous it is and the ones with the skull are the mechanics that can cause a raid wipe? A raid bosses in classic would equate to taking out all the abilities from a boss in modern wow and only leaving the abilities with a skull next to them.
---
Tbh i prefer it that way. I don't like how convoluted the fights have become on modern wow with too much happening on screen. It feels to me more like i an playing diablo with the amount of effects all around me at the same time.
---
But its all up to personal preferences.
---
Gotta try that now
---
Lol, it's like alliance is missing half of the classic content.
---
Hi, /u/iamstephen

---
I remember when this was first uploaded. The swaps between shots, with The Beatles Yesterday playing for the funeral, where eagles Dare by The Misfits for the gank group rushing in, and then of course Scatman Jon for the destruction. Classic video, with classic PvP trolling.
---
Sure but so do a lot of odd items too
---
People under estimate stacking +HP as a BM hunter for world PVP. Attack me all you want, it's the pet that's kicking your ass.
---
Not yet
---
This is mostly a minmaxer post Vanilla thing. I could imagine in a few servers in the US who in average people were more hardcore that it could happen. But in EU and language specific servers I've never heard of hybrid bad reputation, neither BiS. Everyone was just trying their best with what they had and what they believed. There was more arms than fury warriors in my raids.
---
Its shit.
---
I understand, but with the information that we have right now, there is legitimately no way of knowing. We don't even have enough information to even begin speculating on which servers will be successful.
---
God they're not doing us any favours are they
---
The editing is just so on point. The cuts between the tunnel and the memorial with the music just make the entire video
---
This is more important than anything else. Renew might seem like it's not worth to use, but it allows you to play around more of that 5 second rule for regen, unlike spamming lower rank heals or simply just topping the tank whenever it's possible, which literally gives you zero manaregen from your spirit.
---
Haha, nice try!
---
I've heard many hilarious racist/nazi joke in my day so I still think this holds true
---
&gt;  Would this be hilarious? 
---
doesn't it work like that automatically?
---
@OP. Another challenge you’ll face is gearing. Starshards doesn’t benefit from +shadow, and some of your best items are +shadow. Anathema, the Kazzak leggings, glove enchant, and I think there was a BWL ring as well?
---
Its a great tank weapon!... a rogue tank weapon.
---
Thats it, I am rolling dwarf hunter.
---
Yup. Just because it's not optimum doesn't mean it shouldn't exist.
---
sadly people did that and blizzard counted on it for the 333k mounts too
---
That might be the greatest sentance I have ever seen on this subreddit.
---
Blizzard fans have always had many polar-opposite personalities.   
---
I mean, look at retail and Classic...it's basically night and day with lots on each side, yet the same game/company's fan-base.
---
Personally, these posts don't bother me, but I'm also not in the business of looking for things to hate...there's enough of that already. :|
---
This is wrong. CastSpellByName doesn't exist in classic
---
you want
---
`/cast [target=harm] Healing Spell`
---
Barrens chat is retarded and the worst part of vanilla.  Id keep it.muted but vanilla keeps you in need of playing with other people.
---
&gt; can never find a tank for dungeons. 
---
Thats my real fear. Getting to 60 with limited playtime and never able to run an instance because Hunter/warlock(whichever i end up chosing) won't be needed in favor of mages and rogues ...
---
But i don't have enough time to play a tank and I already healed in vanilla ...
---
It’s been a default option since I believe ever.  Just turn ‘self cast’ on in the options.
---
The point is not 'how likely this was to happen' because yes you can say it was a possibility and maybe they were a bit naive (though I'd say that 99 out 100 times, event like this are happening peacefully) the point is that I fail to see how this can be described as hilarious.
---
Personally I consider that it's 'prank video' level of comedy: there's nothing funny but just asshole doing something so assholic that it's unexpected. Have I the right to forbid people to do that? no as long as it's legal and not breaking any law and I'm not telling it's the worse things I've seen in my life by far but at the same time it won't stop be to point how stupid and lame this is.
---
But in the end, through the conversation with 2-3 people and you, I now understand why: people finding this hilarious are the one who think online funeral are stupid and karma whoring (to use the words of somebody who answered me) or at least such insignificant event that trashing it is similar to trashing a tournament organised by the opposite faction or a roleplay event. I find it sad that you (and other people) don't seem to understand that such event can have a lot of meaning and treat it like a bunch of nerds gathering but at least if you feel that way, then your reaction is logic.
---
No
---
Some pretty kewl guys if ya ask me
---
They were the good guys the whole time
---
found an old comment stating r1 ignores 100 r2 200 and r3 ignores 300 armor.
---
this is actually quite decent as it makes up 3-7% of the dmg reduction that remains once all other possible reductions are on including annihilation.
---
[I don't think that's accurate telling me it doesn't exist in vanilla.](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/API_CastSpellByName)
---
It’s not true. I haven’t been subbed for months now and I have the classic wow tab. I also haven’t been in the beta at all nor did I interact with anything blizzard related in quite a time until now. So idk why some people have the tab already and some don’t.
---
HOW DARE YOU EXPRESS A PREFERENCE FOR A RETAIL CLASS ARE YOU MAD. THATS LIKE COATING YOURSELF IN PEANUT BUTTER AND RUNNING OUT INTO A GANG OF RABID RACCOONS NAKED TWIZZLING A FEATHER BOA.
---
yup, it probably some weird empty realm everyone moved away from.
---
WASH YER BACK
---
&gt; Are you mainly/strictly going to use lesser heal, heal and greater heal?
---
Short answer: Yes
---
The highest rank of your big, slow, mana-efficient heal is basically what you use about 90% of the time and everything else is just very niche.
---
You'll also want to have a lower rank that heals about half as much for preventing overhealing on non-tank targets, who don't have all that much HP.
---
Other than that it's mostly about timing because of the 5-second-rule.
---
Try not to heal for as long as possible and then do all the healing at once so you, once again, can stop healing for as long as possible to maximize the mana-regen that kicks back in after 5 seconds of not spending mana.
---
Shield, Renew and Flash-Heal are of much more importance in PvP, where stuff needs to happen on the move and where being interrupted is a real risk.
---
In the midst of "pserver values vs. classic beta values" debate your ignoring classic's upcoming launch and just publishing data you gleaned from a buggy PTR?
---
Feels like your slacking... this is a PTR yet your not using curse of elements on a dummy? That is just a GM command.... If this isn't your PTR you should setup a repack, it would give you more control.
---
The way you "correct" this attack speed bug is very problematic to. You've added new unknown variables to an already very debated topic by attempting to create equivalent DPS.
---
This needs to be completely redone using the correct gear, buffs and debuffs, I'd reccomend using the Silver Hand repack since that has some of the new classic values implemented.
---
Oh such repartee! I'll try to bring myself to your level: NO U!
---
Amazing. This pretty much confirms that they're more than likely to be included in phase 1, thanks :)
---
Ok stop dots.
---
Thanks for the input, totally changed my view.

bad items made the world feel hand crafted. i liked seeing absolute dogshit made it feel less like a spreadsheet simulator

---
Billion dollar company branch led by a man known to trash anything he touches (Star Wars Galaxy) is being petty about a game 'you think you do but you dont'. Just a reminder he didn't join Blizzard until TBC, was working on Wrath the majority of his early days, probably the reason we kept flying mounts in Northrend and the addition of pet battles, summoning stones, achievements and pushed heavily on pay for convenience services such as the first mount you could buy in game store that was cross account shareable. NAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH we don't need him to help advertise our game. We want him to suck our collective cock and we'll show that either way when the game is released but i would like to state that this fucking pathetic ponytail wearing cuck should shill out some bliz bucks for all the bullshit he tried to pull and derail our game in lieu of BFA and w/e bullshit expansion they are planning to announce at Blizzcon this year.   
---
Side note instead of trying to sound apologetic in the view of 'who cares' attitude why not instead ask something more pronounced like 'If Classic WoW is successful @ launch do you think they'll start advertising then?' to which you'd get more positive responses.
---
Not visc... c'mon. You just need NR shit for the fight and frost wands/ oil and some melee may go overboard with on hit frost dmg weps
---
I'm frustrated just reading this
---
I'll accept any and all specs in my 5-mans, but not all people. It'll be interesting to pick people based on who they are rather than Ilvl...and I can't wait. 
---
One thing retail misses (sorry for beating a dead horse,) is that an MMORPG is meant to be a **world** where you interact with other people, and not some perfectly balanced action-game. We have enough action games, and it's a pity that Blizzard has decided that the best MMO of all time needs to be an action game over an MMO.
---
Who knows if they'll fix the game with 9.0, but from what I've seen Ion say, he just genuinely doesn't know how to design the game around anything other than numbers. I'm not insulting him (or trying to, anyway,) it just seems weird that they don't have someone else in charge, and leave Ion to make raids...since I think that's his speciality, and the only consistent part of WoW (outside a few spammy bosses.)
---
But I digress... MMOs are best when they emulate an immersive world, and those worlds are far from perfectly balanced. Weird stuff happens, and that's only possible when you haven't 'decontaminated' every possible cranny.
---
Also, I just realized I tend to make these posts when waiting for Classic becomes difficult....so don't mind me.
---
It's coming after Mythic Azshara world first. They don't want to interfere with that.

---
Mc cap, eyes of the beast???
---
STV, Tanaris, Un’Goro I’d have to say..
---
Honestly looking forward to all of them tho.
---
C3. I'll likely just be doing one character (undead rogue) as I do still play bfa and a few other games on the side, so going ham on some alts likely wont be a thing for me this time around.
---
To be honest, The guy is probably thrilled in the afterlife that this happened. He obviously loved pvp and the game. Best way to say peace out-
---
Honestly the easy mechanics can carry an unintended consequence of making people complacent, thus making it harder in a roundabout way. Its really easy to tunnel vision on your rotation, and you might be able to do it for 30 seconds or more, so your brain starts slowly shutting out the raid warnings until BAM deep breath and you are fucked
---
Serious Bricktop vibes from this
---
I am planning to play only one character, but that might change if my brother decides to play as well. Then I will want to get an alt that can play with him.
---
...
---
...or maybe east coast pvp with the blandest name to avoid streamers? XD
---
15 years on and people still remembering the death. Serenity Now did more to immortalize her in WoW than any in game funeral could have. I still laugh at how inappropriate this raid gank is. We'll be playing in fuckin 20k resolution and ill still see this 480p potato vid and chuckle.
---
Unless you post a link there’s no list.
---
No need to shit on people for being excited.
---
Exactly one of my reasonings aswell.
---
What's your view on old friend list vs b.net app? Was easier to be more Anonymous in the early days.
---
Good idea!! “ I joined copper node, nice pvp server”
---
Character creation is on the 13th, so i doubt that we'll have a Server list the day AFTER o.O

Going to play a priest and i want an dps alt to farm and maybe do some pvp.
---
People like having locks in their groups. 
---
You're basically the insurance guy.
---
SS the healer in case of a wipe.
---
And you can summon new people if someone leaves the group.
---
D3 pvper, I'll be focusing on rogue to start with but by the time people are running around in AQ/Naxx gear I'll start to really struggle as I won't have epics that aren't from reputation or the AH. In phase 6 I'll switch to my mage where I'm likely to do better in the blue PVP gear than my rogue will be able to.
---
Blizzard has never missed an announced launch date, so I wouldn’t worry. It’s definitely weird how silent they are - likely until the mythic world 1st race is over so as not to distract from the main game. 
---
It’s tinfoil hatty, but I don’t think they realized just HOW popular the game was going to be, and probably just needed a little time to prepare for that. I do think it’s going to eclipse retail.
---
IT'S WITH THE IN-LAWS, I'M BEING TAKEN AGAINST MY WILL!

SEND HELP!! \*

It's likely that there wont be aonther stress test.  At this point my dude I think a stress test so close may dampen the exitement a bit for the real release.  Just hearing the music/seeing your first load in screen/killing your first mob all of these moments will be better having done it for your "first" time on real launch.

How about Xilmi and Xilmii then? You'll be able to make a name for yourself twice, *and they'll stack!*
---
So i sign this but never would i play on a rp realm. How fo you know that there is enough pop to fill a server? I dont understand
---
Hum. Un'Goro and Winterspring for the ambiance. And I know it's kind of weird, but the Thousand Needles for questing.
---
2,5k population is definitely more than enough for a server 👍
---
Once I started playing vanilla and comparing to the 30 hours I played retail. I understood the longing for vanilla. It's a much much better game imo. I never felt such character investment and such danger in a world. I'm always watching my back and slowly approaching mobs. And I'm always ready to start running if I pull too many mobs. In my opinion it has the best progression of any game I ever played. There's more I could say, but I don't want to go into too much detail since this is a rant thread.
---
It’s there bro.  Try deleting your cache folder.

---
We aren’t planning on having it when dinner starts but maybe after it starts we will if a lot of you still want it.

And yes that’s is a no for “will there be desert at the start”

How ISNT that a no for you

A GUILD BUILT AROUND ONE PERSON GETTING A FANCY SWORD IS GUILD THAT WILL FAIL
---
OH GOD IT GETS WORSE. THE IN LAWS NOOO.
---
I don't know, It mcan be in the game, I am not sure if that is a problem. I remember playing on some private servers, using some client that is not related to their server with WOD models, so that might be an option I would not hate.
---
But man, srsly.. did you have to use the N-word to describe people who don't want visual changes? Just.... don't use the N-word.... srsly.. makes you look stupid
---
I dont think any of the IF ... THEN macro's work in 1.13. Because they made it possible to do automated stuff, like autodownranking of a spell. I was in the beta, but didnt test out most of the macros, i was waiting for some kind of information what was taken out and what isnt.
---
And just figured that those are automatically out.
---
PS. He did say "does't exist in CLASSIC"
---
Ashenvale as Horde. First PvP experience and such a beautiful zone.
---
From what I've seen on retail in the past they always have.  I think the new models they started introducing since Legion though changed that.  So to answer your question they probably do considering it was in retail all the way through up to Legion.
---
Private servers like Nostalrius were grossly overtuned, you cannot compare it to Classic where the bosses will have 2000 less armor and will deal much less damage.

**Focus-** Experiencing the World of Warcraft while obtaining fortune and glory with a motley crew of hard lifes, lowlifes and no-lifes.

Come on by and say hi
---
I'd also consider myself C+2.
---
I have embarrassingly vivid plans for WoW Classic which entails a single level 60 Main (Mage) with eventually 2 level 39 alts (Classes TBD) for the purposes of supporting the mage via Artisan professions and bank space. Along with the occasional flurry of twinking if endgame content is at a lull for me.
---
On a typical work day I can get an hour in in the morning, and then anywhere between 3-6 hours after work depending on the day (raid days would likely get the 6 hours fairly often).
---
If those 2500 played 24 hours a day, yeah i guess it would be enough then.
---
Was? Does it no longer exist?
---
Yep. Op you will want to have enough mana regen to apply your air totems over and over. Also use nightfall to keep the buff up.
---
You won't deal a lot of damage, so go for hybrid gear.
---
I'm an altoholic but from what I've heard about Vanilla it's brutal if you are.  I'll have a main I focus on and one alt.  This doesnt count my bank/aunction toon.
---
Well, it can be safely assumed that for each person that signed there is at least another one that didn't bother to (or didn't even know) but having the possibility would indeed choose an rp-pvp realm. So probably we'd still have at least couple thousands players.
---
"Some parry". Right.
---
We'll see once people start raiding.
---
mixed opinions from the wow community? all I heard is bad stuff tbh :D
---
Annihilator is in day 1 though, you can get one of those and still provide a useful debuff
---
D3
---
No-one expects this to be a short-term investment (and we'll be royally pissed whenever the servers go down, even if it's a decade from now). I'm not a coffee-drinker, so this is essentially the cup-of-coffee my govt. keeps wanting me to reduce and donate to charity/taxes/etc.

**&lt;The House&gt; - Horde | NA-PvP | Raid Progression**
---
**&lt;About Us&gt;** &lt;The House&gt; is a guild of friends and colleagues, mostly in PDT and CDT time zones, that are excited to come back and experience Vanilla WoW over again. Our members have a wide range of experience with WoW, from little to no experience with the game, to being part of hardcore raiding guilds, along with experiencing many expansions throughout the lifetime of WoW. Many of us played Vanilla WoW back in the glory days.
---
**&lt;What we provide&gt;** We want to build an inviting environment where the guild can grow together and foster the mindset of constantly improving yourself and your character. We are accepting of all experience levels of Vanilla WoW, it’s a game, we’re all here to have fun.
---
**&lt;What are we looking for&gt;** We are actively looking for members that want to progress through end game raiding content, but not at a hardcore pace. Our members have lives outside of the game, so we want to build an atmosphere of a consistent progression-based mindset, but without the 14hr a day dedication it takes to clear world/server first content. This would mean making an effort to obtain appropriate enchantments, bring consumables for fights we may need them on, taking advice from more experienced players to improve your rotations, and overall have a positive attitude.
---
**&lt;Raiding&gt;** Loot system: Primary focus utilizing DKP EP/GP, but with loot council when appropriate. 
---
Our raid times are tentative, but this is our current plan: 
---
Running 20-man raids on Tuesdays @ 6pm PDT/8pm CDT
---
Running 40-man raids on Sundays @ 10am PDT/12pm CDT and Mondays @ 6pm PDT/8pm CDT
---
**&lt;PvP&gt;** Many of us are interested in running some pre-made BG's when we hit 60, though that isn't the primary focus of our core members.
---
**&lt;Recruiting&gt;** We’re actively recruiting all people who are passionate about what they play. Our current roster is available here: docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11SwJzLCkaBUkC-kSb4CgqUHf3Kzp8bguZ230MyBYQ70/edit?usp=sharing
---
Tank Demand: Low

DPS Demand: Medium

What do you mean by start of server? The honor system won't be out for the first few months anyhow and it'll probably be half a year at least before bg's come into play.
---
It will be slower. But if you are not in a hurry, then sure.  
---
If you have a friend to level with you, beeing healer is a bit more fun in the leveling process
---
I really mean it, i tried a warrior at a pserver. But i really suck. Through all expansions i have played every class exept warrior.
---
Why does this hunter have a pig as a pet?
---
And i can tell you, as much ive played a priest. People have been amazed what a difference a player can make. Joined a guild tank to SM run, i was 2-3 levels lower level as their previous priest and while the previous priest had to drink after every pull, i could go on from boss to boss with him just chainpulling.
---
This is a more advanced way of playing and maybe the OP is better off doing the int strategy. But if you ever levelup a priest again, try it out. You will be surprised how fucking OP it is.
---
PS. if spirit is great when you have +15% regen from talents. Its the same thing if you can get 100% regen ~1/6 of time in combat. Think of the 5s rule, if you get 1 tick / every 6 seconds, thats same as 15% regen.  So do your casts, dont cast anything for 6 seconds and you get the same regen as the 3p talents.
---
'..I said that. It doesn't work in classic' ==  "it does not work on 1.13."
---
I even supplied the version that works in classic.
---
STV, Winterspring, and Searing Gorge / Blackrock Mountain. I can’t wait...
---
So 4 more weeks to think About the class I want to play.... paladin or druid...
---
Don't brother to shield warriors or druids. If you do you will be costing them rage from being hit. Try to get a feel for how much you're greater heal is healing for on your tank and walk the line with it. 
---
Only throw renews mid combat never at the end or between fights. If you have a hyper tank pilling while renew is still up guess you will have threat
---
Not true. Most of them have the vanilla report function, that works. The teams running the game are too understaffed and the menus are too cumbersome to navigate.
---
Long term alt goals. 
---
I’ll have my one 60 main plus a 39 twink for max professions and a lvl 20 hunter bank alt. 20 for aspect of the cheetah for those speedy trips between the AH and mailbox haha.
---
... less than 24 hours ago
---
Blizzard doesnt have a dad. Its run by bitches and retail is the proof.
---
I don't get it
---
All I got to say is  Westboro Baptist Church.  Also, like another said, if they did not want PVP to happen then have it in a zone where PVP is not toggled on by default.  Something about piss poor planning!!!
---
Id say 2-3k online is a must. But im sure an rp-pvp server would have those numbers if they were to make one.
---
THERE’S NOTHING WRONG WITH GETTING ENJOYMENT OUT OF DOING THINGS WELL
---
That dwarf looks very.... bitey

---

---
&gt; Not sure how you can say that someone thinking those people are assholes is an "incorrect moral opinion".
---
I did not say that anywhere, I said it isn't an objectively correct moral opinion, big difference.
---
Again, if the arrangers of this memorial did not want it to be disrupted, and they insist on doing it within a virtual world, then they should have just done it in a friendly zone, it's really not that hard. And that is if you regard the importance of the memorial to be the actual virtual characters to be together as opposed to the individuals behind the characters being together (which they still are, whether their characters are dead or not).
---
Also, I don't see this as a desecration, it is rather just some players who put the memorial in the context where it was held and in my view helped celebrate the deceased just as much, since a large part of WoW is PvP and AFAIK the deceased enjoyed PvP herself.
---
i don't think they would ever consider delaying release. rather release and continue the fixes than push back when the game is already this close.
---
All the people who are planning to hardcore it, already booked their vacation days, some had to change them when they announced the release date.
---
But 1 month before launch, they wouldn't delay it.
---
2500 is not enough for a server. That's not the number of characters allowed on any realm, it's the number that can be logged in simultaneously. People play on different hours of the day and even on different days of the week. I'd say you need at least twice that amount for a decently healthy server.
---
Eh. It's still barely worth it. You start your mana regeneration 3 or 2.5  seconds earlier. That's 1 to 1.5 ticks. 
---
That kind of makes up for some of Renew's comparative inefficiency (it's actually not THAT terrible) but it doesn't give any appreciable advantage either, especially at higher levels when you take mp5 regeneration from items and the Meditation talent into consideration.
---
Franky, Renew is mainly nice because as an instant it can be cast on the move, so it's nice to top off party members while moving to the next mob group. That's it, pretty much.
---
Servers are gonna have 50-100k. A couple thousand is not enough.
---
Gotcha! Do you have an example of a boss where you need to care about the mechanic? All bosses I’ve met in wow is just dps-tank-heal and perhaps survive some kind of stun or super attack.
---
People will not give enough fuck to justify the risk. People die or develop mental conditions that are very damaging if they don't sleep.
---
Hey, sorry about that! Completely forgot to follow up. As far as I'm aware, clearcasting will proc on Arcane Missiles, but only on the Mana expenditure. Individual ticks won't contribute.
---
Not necessarily.  There has been some other gear that wone be coming out until a later phase which was also on Stress Test.
---
Kil’jaeden is down
---
Dedication on the bank alt! Haha.
---
You didn't just say that. You said "that's wrong" if someone says "I think it's X but it might not be due to Y"
---
Saying that's wrong doesn't make any sense at all.
---
Loved this!! I'm too ready for this.
---
First off, never use PW Shield on Warrior tanks, as they need to be taking damage to gain rage. PW Shield makes it so they don't gain any rage and really makes it harder on them than it needs to be (doing their rotations and holding aggro etc). Always keep your highest ranked Renew on your tank during every pull, and if a party member pulls aggro go ahead and renew them too. Use your longest spell-cast heal (greater heal or heal or whatever) on your tank when he gets to 50%ish HP, depending on the strength of your heal and his HP pool. 
---
Always bring lots of water (at least 2 stacks) to every dungeon run. You probably won't use it all (or even half), but better safe than sorry. If there's a mage in your group you can disregard this. 
---
But yes, you will be oom like every pull, at least until you start getting some good +int gear rolling. Don't worry about it, just bring lots of water, and if you have to drink after every - single - mob, then do it. It's annoying but you do what you gotta do. 
---
Use Renew to heal up the party in between mobs too.
---
Priest for me it is. Never played the Claas in Classic and haven‘t played it After.
---
It’s not the fire resist gear you have to be worried about. It’s the nature resist gear for AQ and if I’m not mistaken shadow and ice resist for Naxx? I may be wrong on the Naxx ones though. I only killed Razuveus.
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Trisfal Glades
---
Regular questing at 60?
---
Not really sure what you mean. There's no daylies and no XP-to-gold-conversion in Classic.
---
Most quests for level 60 are dungeon or group-quests. And you'll eventually run out of them anyways.
---
You're not gonna get it with that attitude!
---
I'm with you man.  Thousand needles was one of my favorite zones, and it's been gone from the world since cataclysm.  I remember running around down there on my tauren warrior in my green iron crafted BS gear (it was hideous).  I love the shimmering flats on one end, and how it blends into the lush forest land of feralas on the other end.  Man I can't wait to trudge through that zone again.

---
Iirc there was a pvp video in the early days of &lt;PALS FOR LIFE&gt;, before their infamous Leroy Jenkins video, where they were MC throwing hordies out of the elevator to the Horde base in thousand needles. 
---
The video was memorable because it featured Tom Petty's "Learning to fly"
---
Now tell us dishonestly
---
Even if animations changed, only the person who enables HD graphics would have to put up with that anyway! I’m sure such people don’t care about the animation difference.
---
I really wish i had more upvotes for your post
---
I remember this video, I found it comical and yet horrifying at the same time, which I believe is the appropriate reaction. Loved the music and editing and just the build-up, it was artwork.
---
Thank you. Nobody here has calendars, so we can’t keep up with dates.

We have a group of 15-20 players who are aiming for 1 night a week raiding. Most of us are 25+ so it’ll be a pretty mature and relaxed environment. Alliance, NA. Let me know if you want more details.
---
You think it will be, but it won't.
---
I wonder if Blizzard would even allow something like this in this day and age.

For me it's Darkshore. I always loved the dark, foggy and mysterious ambience it had. Auberdine is my favourite hub in WoW and I can't wait to just chill its shore fishing and enjoying the rainy ambience and music :)
---
Thats a direct self-contradiction. If items are all the same in the end with just different power levels, then the itemization is absolute garbage. Thats not "nearly perfect", its nearly non-existant.
---
And how is that bad? Thats EXACTLY what good itemization is supposed to do, give players choices in what to equip for different scenarios, or possibly even giving items which give new abilities or which can change your style of play through some effects. Obviously theres going to be a meta eventually with everything resolved and the "best" for each purpose figured out, but those were still all figured and decided by players.
---
Not getting hit by fire is a pretty common one. Enrage timers could be considered a type of mechanic as well. Generally not standing in front of the boss as to avoid frontal cleaves. Dispelling debuffs. Kiting adds away from the group. Hiding behind objects to avoid one shot mechanics. Swapping attacks between tanks to avoid getting x amount of stacks/debuff. Focusing down certain adds before they do a thing are all mechanics.

---
Well, it’s accurate. Alliance is the homo side.
---
AWF WITH YA
---
Why the fuck would a shaman use 1h in classic when you can't dual weild, and windfury is a fixed PPM?  With fixed PPM you don't get more procs for faster weps, therefore 2handers do more damage since their procs hit a lot harder and proc the same number of times on average.
---
Honestly the video is more about utility than dps
---
No. Not me. Job, kids, life say no.
---
Well its classic so it's more like xp to silver
---
Or a second sub
---
I think that too, but I hope I still enjoy it.
---
I don't get it either,  like it's so awful it induces a humorous response in some people? Ok weird coping mechanism but not funny
---
Battlenet cache folder? Where should i be looking then??
---
Edit: instructions unclear, got dick stuck in ceiling fan while larping as an orc.

There won’t be an RP-pvp server. Roll on a pvp server like a normal person.
---
I mean there were a shitload of ret pallies in raids back in the day too - doesn't mean they're good.

---
AB nets you more honor / hour. A domination victory is super fast there and you don't run the risk of a x-hour long battle vs competent teams.
---
As hunter your job changes to surviving a drawn out fight instead of peeling people off your flag carry / stopping the opposition
---
The SV reason for that is that wyvern is instant 41y crowd control. Peeling off your flag carry or sleeping one / their respective support so your dps can catch up. (Though for obvious reasons wyvern is still unpopular among solo players because it means they can't get a scatter for their 1v1 gameplay - which ought to be irrelevant while you are part of a properly organised farm team)
---
Thousand needles is one of my favorite zones becuse you can stay there from 28 to pretty much 32 without leaving.  Desolace is also pretty awesome as a rarely contested zone with a good amount of quests and no competition, because everyone else is in STV.  Feralas is nice to go to for a quick spell.
---
Sure, if you’re a sexual deviant.
---
30/0/21 would be ideal. And more than enough for healing PvP, dungeons and raids.
---
If you go full resto then you're going to struggle with lvl 58+ mobs. A lot.
---
Telling someone to watch their back just means to be careful. I’m sure it’s been used as a veiled threat but that’s not what the default meaning of the phrase is.
---
So many have passed.  In Australia,  Suicide remains the leading cause of death for Australians aged between 15 and 44.  I am certain that WoW has saved a lot of people from that.  I know a few.  The connections made online are real and keep people real, often.
---
LOL
---
well, that's basically a phase 5 and 6 strategy then. Flametongue is useless in the early raids. 
---
But might work. Flametongue is bascailly SoR, so you'd be a spelladin without consecration, so should only be 100 or so dps less.
---
None of them. Never played Horde in classic. Will mostly be running dungeond with my mates because we all suck at questing

You need Frost 110+ for Sapphiron. That's 3 items and the frost resist quest ring.

Nature is for Huhuran in AQ40, you need to be fully decked out.

are you trying to say that classic is just nostalgia?

I'm not getting nervous over a stress test... Seriously can't you just wait for the game to launch? They're not changing the date. What other companies do you know that get on Twitter every single day and go, "out game is STILL coming out."
---
Just calm the fuck down and wait for launch.
---
Feralas - a grinder's paradise
---
Jesus the low quality crap is really out in full force now.
---
I'm personally curious about whether the delay is something to do with layering. It's really the only thing left that the community is still at least somewhat up in arms over, and that can't have escaped Blizzard's attention. Given how much they've tried to accommodate the community's wishes thus far, I do wonder whether they've been spending this time trying either to deal with the potential exploits caused by layering or removing it altogether and going with something different. 
---
Before someone says "Well it's not like it would be hard to launch with more servers", I do think the question of what exactly they're going to do would be a major debate in the Classic team. There's people working there who were around for the original launch, which was a total trainwreck from Blizzard's perspective. They'd want to avoid that at all costs, and it's that memory that I believe drove the original decision to go with layering. That being said, there'd likely be people on the Classic team who don't like layering, and who could point to the community backlash as proof that it would be better to just roll the dice and launch with more servers, doing merges later if required. It's those debates that could take a lot of time to have, and what could be holding things up. Bear in mind that the closer to the release date, and the name reservations, that they hold the stress test, the better idea they get of how many people are going to come back for Classic, which in turn might give them an idea of how many servers they'd need if they went for dropping layering.
---
Change the hair to black, and the hood makes it look like Matt Mercer. Lol
---
Cant wait to quest at grom gol instead of that shitty alliance camp.
---
Do you know the feeling when you are doing a dungeon and during the dungeon you become so tired that you'd really like to go to bed but force yourself to finish it out of responsibility for the others?
---
What usually starts happening is periods of Microsleep.
---
Had this happen to me several times and also seen signs of this in others.
---
If you somehow force yourself to stay awake at all costs, your cognitive function will decline more and more. This will go to a point where you will no longer be able to perform your task of playing the game in a way that actually grants you XP.
---
I'm going to bet that you won't make it. I think the chances of you falling asleep or dying are higher than the chance of actually making it to 60.
---
Ahh the old "classic is just nostalia" trope.  No, you're wrong - it's just a better game than retail period.
---
Retail player alert.
---
Why are you using that as an excuse for unwarranted anxiety? Don't they teach you in therapy how to recognize emotions that are brought about by your mental afflictions and quell them with rational thought?
---
There are so many to choose from, however, since I plan on playing a Human Paladin I do have a special place in my heart for all the beginner zones; Elwynn Forest, Westfall, Redridge Mountains, Duskwood and so on. 
---
Later on I look especially forward to Hillsbrad Foothills, Arathi Highlands, and Feralas.  
---
During the later levels then it's definitely The Plaguelands, I remember feeling especially powerful during my early 50's on my first character, when you come to the zones making up "Old Lordaeron". It was a that point I began to realize that the end/max level was near.
---
They’re all gonna be on 1 or 2 servers.
---
Its quick but you can easily get mauled by some ?? Bears or Wolves, undead are easy to avoid though.
---
My favorite pieces that are itemized weirdly is things like 2H swords with loads of spirit, because back in the day the sucked and now they're great for leveling.
---
so true. HWL is literally only playing an absurd amount, nothing else
---
Stonetalon mountains are awesome.
---
STREAM BAD
---
Ofc it is, in one way. It's using the games resources to role play, which you could have done in pretty much every other circumstance and not even need a game for though.
---
D and 2,5 I guess. 
---
Will play for 1 hour some days and other days I might play a lot more. My 2nd character will be a hunter I'm leveling up to 35 for alchemy so not going to have two 60 toons. Level 35 shouldn't be that much of a timesink. 
---
For the alt plan is to either clear out the starter zone quests right away day 1 and log out in the first inn. Alternatively I will skip doing any quests and just run as a level 1 to the first inn and log out, backtracking later. 
---
Will play the hunter like 1 hour every week or so. It's no rush to hit level 35 since before you get anything out of it you must have gotten enough gold to powerlevel alchemy.

 Morning Raids (EST)
---
&lt;INFORMAL&gt; \[NA\]\[A\]\[PVE\]\[SEMI-HARDCORE\] MORNING EST
---
We are looking for dedicated people who want to get in and clear content. A new or old player, if you are dedicated, we want you on the team! &lt;INFORMAL&gt; is a brand new guild created from the ground up with Classic in mind.  We are on a PVE server with a PVE focus.
---
GOALS:
---
We will strive to provide an efficient raiding environment for those who want to achieve steady progression through all six phases of World of Warcraft: Classic.  To that end, we are aiming for:
---
\-Week 3 Molten Core clears
---
\-Split-Raids as early as Phase 2
---
\-Clear current content in 1 raid night
---
\-Clear Naxxramas and obtain full Best-in-Slot for our members.
---
With these goals in mind we hope to create a positive and mature atmosphere within the guild. We are not hardcore in our raid schedule nor do we expect players to put in extreme hours prepping for raids.  However, we do expect reasonable investment from our members.  You must want to contribute and help the entire team succeed. We value maturity and honesty above all else. Every single member is expected to set an example for our server on how quality players should behave. All raiding members should be logged on and ready 15 minutes before the raid start time. During progression we expect our raiders to show up with full consumables to help us get the kills we need.
---
RAID SCHEDULE
---
RAID TIMES - Eastern Standard Time (U.S., Morning)
---
RAID DAYS - MON/WED/THUR 
---
Wednesday: 7:00-10:00 AM EST 
---
Thursday:  7:00-10:00 AM EST 
---
Monday:  7:00-10:00 AM EST 
---
The raid schedule shall include world buff acquisition if practical. We will strive for one-day clears, and we will never require raiding on any other day of the week. However, depending on our needs and progress, we may utilize planned raid-day extensions to complete specific content. The intent of each raid day is to clear content and fulfill everyone’s BiS. If there is interest, we may designate optional raid days for alts, or squeeze in an additional farm raid, but not to the detriment of our purpose.

As you can see, recruitment is going well and many raid roles are already closed. We are always very accepting of casual players looking for a morning home; so even if you don't have time to raid every week, we would love to see you join our split-runs on occasion and even grind dungeons! As always, any exceptional players are welcome to apply as positions in 40-man raids often open up.

Our Raid Roster:

Our target is to maintain a single raid team of 45 members minimum. We plan to fill our roster with the intent to minimize wasting loot.  
---
&lt;INFORMAL&gt; is focused on clearing all content classic has to offer in a timely and efficient manner. All while having as much fun as possible.
---
Let's create a great environment for all people willing to play with us.
---
Probably gonna do a little RP in my head and play as a Paladin in Kalimdor. So being one of very few humans who is accepted by Nightelves and who knows that continent very well.
---
No even 10+ I get routinely denied for not being 440+ Ilvl.  I actually got lucky in EP this week and hit 428, still can’t get invites.  I don’t use IO, so I don’t list it or have any idea what mine is.  But I’m also not a pleb, I raid lead pugs for full clears every week including on my alts, I’ve played a paladin main since TBC, been in some very strong guilds that have some impressive kills over the years, I feel like I’m still a very strong player and the inflated requirements people ask for is just waisting their own time and mine.
---
What you are describing is called pscycopathy
---
The fuck is this low effort shite?
---
Bosses don’t respawn until the dungeon gets forcefully reset at the daily reset (aka once per day). You’re the one that has no clue what he’s talking about.
---
Appreciate it! I'll see if I can't get something worked out using these.
---
I'd still play Rogue because they play exactly the same no matter the faction.
---
Noi, I'll have a bank alt and a secondary alt.  And then more.  But I get the idea of all in.
---
Wait is this quest for real? I've only played Horde.
---
Not only that but League is constantly bringing new things out, once the phases have all been dished out classic will have nothing new. Some people will like this, but its likely that some people will grow bored and want a new challenge.
---
And you can easily browse the reddit without complaining about it. That’s just the way it is.

Because it wasn't roleplay

Duskwood Mor'Ladim questline.

its sunday there.... no cunt would be in the office
---
It's settled, ill roll one too.
---
Underbitey.
---
Do you know what would happen if you had a funeral in a paint ball field? If you really did? They would hold off with their game till you were done. Stunning, shocking, unbelievable! Yet that’s what would happen.
---
Everyone who has played retail in the last few years knows exactly what you’re talking about. Just ignore this zoomer - read his history. It’s some kid who comes here to post negative shit because retail is circling the drain.

This is a long-standing concept in collectible card games. For a detailed explanation see [this article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/when-cards-go-bad-2002-01-28) and [this followup](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/when-cards-go-bad-revisited-2012-10-22).
---
Collectible card games print bad cards because it's part of the learning experience of the game. New players might see a card and think it's great, experiment with it in a deck, and then come to understand why the card is bad. The player comes out of the experience with greater knowledge and a greater understanding of the game than if they had just been handed a top tier deck.
---
There are also cards that may not necessarily be terrible but also aren't necessarily competitive, but are fun to play and build strategies around. Some players enjoy experimenting with these cards even if they're not "best in slot."
---
MMOs should treat loot the same way that card games create cards. There should be gear that appears good but is actually outclassed by similar stuff, and gear that opens up some interesting gameplay opportunities that the player can experiment with but still may not be the best available in the game.
---
Honestly vanilla World of Warcraft feels pretty streamlined to a player coming from EverQuest. In EQ, your raid gear might have completely useless stats, like [Intelligence on Warrior armor](http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=4917). Some "basic" players may just wear their raid set, while more enterprising players might decide to wear an [alternate option](http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=3312) that drops from a level 35 mob because of the Dexterity boost will help them hold aggro better.
---
In fact, classic EQ doesn't really have agreed upon BIS lists like you see in WoW for these sorts of reasons. Although as you get further away from the vanilla game, you do see a lot more raid items that are so good they're obviously the best choice for many classes.
---
Anyways, this greater player agency and freedom to decide on your own personal best gear out of many options is one of the many things I dearly miss about the design of classic MMOs.
---
No, you cannot.
---
I said that. Also why not both?
---
You realize that a healer's farmer alt doesn't need bis to farm?
---
The problem is forcing your opinion onto others:
---
If you prefer funerals to be a big PvP event or if you think that online funeral are stupid, then it's your opinion and I can't change it but disrupting the event that friends of the deceased decided then it's being an asshole and being an asshole isn't funny in my book
---
Lol be prepared to receive hate. I’ve met people who leave stuff on dead mobs on purpose because why should I get to skin their mobs?
---
*Swoop there its is!*
---
Dude, i feel you so hard on this.
---
The worst part is it's not even an arbitrary absurd amount. It's basically a ranking system and you're in competition with other people playing an absurd amount. For the last couple of ranks you literally need to be #1 several weeks in a row to keep progressing.
---
Which means either some idiot who literally plays 24/7 can make it impossible or there's fixing and choosing who gets to be the next HWL.
---
Yay!
---
But then you think to yourself, "if I had better gear, I could farm faster..." and then down the rabbit hole you go.
---
isnt it saying that the player doesnt really want the game, but to be back in 2004? yea idgi either, 2004 fucking sucked as a year
---
yes, the last stress test launches were so smooth i think they've ironed out all stability issues. 
---
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
---
I mean, the rank 14 system isn’t skill based at all. So rank 14 means less to me. But some things should be like that. It’s like scarab lord imo. Though, you have more time this go around.

🌘 **About**
---
Hi! We are an Australian based group of nerds that like to play vidya and get loot. We are originally a group of friends who have been playing WoW together over a span of 15 years and have regrouped to experience its golden age! We welcome new friends to join our friendly, fun and competitive community and experience classic WoW together.
---
🌘 **Endgame**
---
*PvE*: Eclipse is primarily a raiding guild; our main goal is to clear current PvE content and stay highly competitive. We have decided on a semi-hardcore approach, to experience the best without the headache. We all have jobs, family and commitments, therefore our aim is to strike a balance.
---
*PvP*: With former QueueQ premade leaders in our midst, we have goals to provide regular organised world PvP and premade battlegrounds.
---
🌘 **Yourself**
---
We are looking for efficient raiders that want to play competitively but in a relaxed environment, who understand the community aspect of vanilla, have a team-work orientated mindset and want to contribute to the guild’s welfare. We also look for light-hearted players – we make raiding fun with humour which can often be dark humour – we hope you have thick skin and will laugh along too! (Also, sick cunts.)
---
🌘 **Applying**
---
While we do have an application form, at this stage we are happy for potential raiders to just join our discord, introduce yourself and chat with the others. Once classic drops, a more formal approach will become more appropriate - but until then we would love to meet you.
---
\*\*Note: Please check our discord FAQ channel and google doc guidebook for further insight into our guild.\*\*
---
You're right, it's worth haveing something traumatic happen of it gets you fame. (Note the sarcasm)
---
I'm not the sort to post questions that would obviously be answered by a simple search, unless I already did a simple search and either didn't find the info, or found conflicting info.  
---
Even the responses to my own question here have provided both yes and no answers.  
---
Not trying to be a dick here.
---
Went from Dwarf hunter to Troll hunter for my main.
---
Shadow priest is pretty much undisputed #1 at solo pvp in classic.
---
I'd still start with the wand. Simply because the first two wands are totally OP for the level you can get them.
---
Almost the same DPS as casting for 0 manacost.
---
Spirit-tap starts overtaking the usefullness of wands when you already have both anyways.
---
Not getting both is something I would consider as gimping yourself.
---
/&gt;"I've the finest wares in the land"
---
/&gt;mfw when it's just goblin buttplugs
---
Everyone thinks this is about nostalgia but it's clearly about the crippling depression of adulthood.
---
Same. I know we’re all in it for the easy access to the Buttplugs
---
no, "a couple of hours a few nights a week" is not enough to get r11
---
Being an adult is a liberation.  If you're really depressed as an adult,  you should probably seek serious help.
---
Also has a bunch of obsolete poison items.
---
It's a shame the Bloodvine set is good till like AQ40 due to the hit rating. Only thing I can see myself using Felheart for will be PvP due to the high stamina.
---
Some aren’t. But really that’s not so bad. We get to play on a server where most people play at the same time. We have to be the ones to carry over the vanilla mindset. There’s a lot of people already trying to turn it more retail.
---
My GF has off from school those two weeks.  I took the 27th off from work to play and that's the only day.
---
I have two weddings the two weekends in a row right after launch and a final for my online class due the Friday of launch week.
---
Alchemy/Herbing is always a solid choice as a Shaman, But if you plan on PVP consider engineering.
---
How about we start a thread where someone posts proof that they are sending Blizzard a gallon of Vanilla ice cream in a small foam cooler packed with dry ice?
---
Yeah, but the issue is that they did overdo it. There was no niche for *support* classes, full healer specs had the same amount of utility (or even more, RSham having their unique mana tide totem). No encounters were made with that in mind. Little gear was made for it as well, and the scaling was quite poor due to too many mixed stats needed.
---
THE ACTUAL ANSWER IS RACE SPECIFIC SPELLS LIKE FEAR WARD THAT ARE HELPFUL IN PVP AND SOME BOSSES. THERE WILL BE MANY DWARF PRIESTS IN A RAID, PLAY NIGHTELF, YOU WONT REALLY SEE A DIFFERENCE.
---
So true. I remember our guild had a melee Hunter and nobody even had a problem this that. Good times.
---
yes
---
That ui is absurd, I assume most computers today can handle that with ease right
---
Tiberium and Chair still live on in memory

---
Sure a calculator would be more accurate but it's also more work.
---
What I'm suggesting is a general guideline that is easy to interpret for people that are not intimately familiar with the loot tables of Classic. It's not a new idea, the values have been out on the internet for over a decade.
---
which is really nice because they can spend 5 subtelty talents somewhere else (if they are pvpers)
---
There’s more difficulty in doing 5 man dungeons in BFA than there is in 40 man raids in Classic. But raiding is often needed to gear for pvp, so what can you do but raid to get geared for the real fun in the game?
---
This is the one I remember most fondly.
---
Yeh thatd be perfect. Itll be an accomplishment of its own!
---
I will have one lvl 1 main  (the CEO of my bank syndicate), one level 60 alt (to do the mundane things the lvl 1 can't be bothered with to do, like killing dragons) and a legion of bank alts.  
---
This setup has been working perfectly for me in the past few years on Kronos. 
---
And yes, I am serious.  As I type this the lvl 1 has  37 days, 19 hours and 17 minutes.  The lvl 60 (who has been all the way to Kel Thuzad) has 35 days, 15 hours and 52 minutes.
---
nahhhh WoTF is too good for rogues, one of their only weaknesses was warlock fear and WoTF is just too good for that
---
perception is a bitch but its also a 3m cd and you need to know roughly when a rogue is stealthing towards you
---
What if I think khazz garoth is cooler sounding but you like the sound of amanthul
---
Liberation comes with responsibility and that's what has people feeling depressed.
---
Doesn't prevent dodge nor miss.
---
&gt;k so.. if I were to try and take my time leveling up, I would spam run dungeons that give me really good gear and semi twink myself out every 10 or so levels. Then I'd try to find good opportunities to fuck around with world pvp and bgs while doing quests here and there when its convenient for me.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;In another world where I rushed to 60, outside of doing raid lockouts every week, I'd be doing the same shit. I dont really see how being max level takes away from any content you can create for yourself. There isn't magically
---
You keep saying your going to do dungeons and bg. Theres no BG for at least 6 months and the dungeons in vanilla are not meant for level 60.

We are a HORDE progression raiding &amp; casual friendly guild rolling on a PvP server. We are building a fun community that already has a good time just hanging out &amp; playing other games while we wait for launch. Progression Raid times are Tues. and Wednesday 7-10 CST. Eventually we also plan on implementing a weekend casual MC raid that will PuG as necessary when we have the roster and demand for it.
---
SENSE OF HUMOR REQUIRED TO CONTINUE.
---
We run a unique Democratic Loot Council System where the raiders will vote for their class officers Jump in discord for more info! The weekend raid will use a casual loot system that is TBD.
---
What we offer:
---
Laid back but competitive environment. Leadership has cleared content thru Naxx in vanilla. We might not be server first, but we will certainly push for it and we won’t be far behind. We aim to clear all content in a timely manner while having fun and hanging out with friends; That being said having fun is not wiping 17 times on trivial content so don't expect the progression raid to be filled with boomkins &amp; enhance shammies.
---
What we expect from you:
---
We expect you to have fun playing this amazing game with a group of dedicated and knowledgeable gamers. Having a sense of humor is required as stated above. We expect you to be prepared for the content. The guild will help you as much as we can to make sure you succeed. We will provide the knowledge and resources necessary but ultimately it is your responsibility to know the fights and the appropriate gear and consumables for your class.
---
If this sounds like your cup of tea please contact me on discord carl#1501 or jump in https://discord.gg/nFt3qqj

Diablo 3 was announced in 2008, then not released until May 15, 2012. They pushed it back several times over those 4 years. Then when they finally released the May 15th date they were still wrong. It wasnt until later that the game became actually available to be played. So while that *probably* wont be the case here, you can't say that his never happened to a Blizzard game.
---
lol the eyes
---
They would never allow a RP PVP server as this would allow a few normal players to roll there and dominate everyone trying to /bow /wave /question /getwreckedtryingtolevel

---
Lol it’s a ridiculously long time because it’s however long you have until reset. Bosses don’t respawn aside from that.
---
I think you overestimate the shadow-priests advantage at soloing over a holy-priest that has imp-wand and spirit-tap.
---
When it comes to mana-efficient and smooth-mob-grinding it is barely any worse, so it really depends on how much time you are going to spend in dungeons.
---
I'd say going a wand+spirit-tap-holy-spec is preferable for anyone who wants to hang in dungeons most of the time.
---
One might think that as long as nobody died, it is good enough to heal a dungeon. And that's true. But dungeon-runs are also slowed by how often you have to sit down and drink. If I can speed up the dungeon not only for myelf but 4 other people on top, I feel that has an overall better impact on the well of my faction than me being slightly faster while soloing.
---
I feel someone should actually make experiements to quantify all of that with actual numbers. :D
---
&gt;&gt; after building a new PC
---
&gt; Gotta try that now
---
Keep us updated just in case we all have to build a new PC. :-)

This is not the original soundtrack to this video. They definitely played yesterday by the Beatles while showing the forum post section.

\#Header1**GLAMORAMA** **(Alliance EU - PVP) is recruiting!**
---
\#Header2**Classic is coming! We are already over 60 people but still recruiting 1X holy paladin, 2X Warlocks and (surprisingly) 2X rogues!**

Finally, we will all be able to play the best game ever made. And we hope you will do it with us!
---
We are a group of friends who played the original vanilla wow from near launch up until patch 1.12. We want one more stab to **clear all raid content**, enjoy and compete in world and BG PVP and just mess around in Azeroth.
---
**Our background:**
---
We used to play in a server first guild, clearing everything from Hogger up to Four Horsemen in Naxx.
---
**What we offer:**
---
\-          Focused 40 man raiding Tuesdays and Thursdays at CET 20.00 -23.00
---
\-          Knowledgeable and experienced raid leading
---
\-          Balanced raid groups
---
\-          For those interested we will run 20-man PVE and PVP content on other days
---
**What we require of raiders:**
---
\-          Average attendance 1.5 times/week 40-man raids
---
\-          Suitable PVE spec, consumables and knowledge of encounters
---
Guild language is English.
---
We have no age requirements. Everyone is welcome to apply. We will not stand for any harassment or discrimination within the guild.
---
We want to create a guild for those who can commit to twice a week raiding. We **strongly** believe we can clear all raid content, including Naxxramas. We also believe it is important to not fall too far behind in progression as you risk losing players to other guilds. We thus aim to be **“geared and cleared”** of current raid tiers by the time the next raid tiers are released.
---
If you wish to join as a social or pvp player you are most welcome!
---

The problem is that it's not like they hold their event at the entrance of Blackrock mountains at 8pm and decided that in memory of their friends, nobody should make any PvP for one hour and annoyed everybody who dared so no it's not vice-versa. Their action had absolutely no impact on the rest of the server and people have to actively go after them.
---
Then I think the social norm of people holding a funeral should be left alone peacefully also work online especially, like I just stated, if they go in a remote corner and not bother anyone. I mean it's the kind of events that trample the barrier between online and real life as people were not crying on the fact a player quit the game but the real loss of a life.

Rather take rank 2, the debuff will last for 6 seconds, not just 4 :-) Even though the cast time is 2 sec instead of 1.5 sec

I know what you mean.  It has a lot to do with what you had going on at the time you were there, making the memories.  One of my favorite things is when I have a bunch of time to play, and no responsibilities ahead of me for a couple days.  That was my situation when I first stepped foot in thousand needles.  There was the sense of discovery and amazement all rolled up with my days worth of coming free time.  Man it was awesome.  It doesn't happen that much anymore - as you get older and get weighed down by more stuff.
---
Yeah the dogs in DM:N can be killed for trash/greens, then skinned and then the 1st boss can be solo'd for a blue item. 
---
DM:E you can drop down at the beginning and kill the lashers for trash/herbs/items, and then you can also find herbs down there if you have herbalism as well as the class books. The trash sells for a considerable amount, and the herbs you can put on the AH which sell good (Gromsblood, dreamfoil etc). I've also had a couple of epic BoE's drop from them which are basically the jackpot if you get the good ones.
---
All easily done by mages due to their aoe damage/slow/root through blizzard,frost nova, cone of cold. Other classes can do the lashers quite easily also since IIRC they're only lvl 54 or so. Not sure which classes can solo the DM:N dogs/boss easily though.
---
Worst year of my entire life. Everyone has a different story.

I've used to have that Mr T Vs Chuck Norris, dropping jokes on barrens chat like a boss, glad I wasn't the only one with this strategy.

nah man if they REALLY loved their friend they woulda all rerolled on a pserver and leveled to 60 IMMEDIATELY

---
To be honest I think Burning Crusade was the perfect itemization between everything being useful to someone and each class having unique flavor based on the stats. The prot paladin implementation of BC is still my favorite implementation of a tank in an MMO. 
---
I guess vanilla is really just more so bad spec design than items maybe? They really got the world, social, and many other aspects right.

**Solace | NA PST - PvP | Community First, Always.**
---
📷 Mature Community📷 New &amp; Old Player Friendly
---
Solace is a Community First guild that places an intrinsic value on its *people.* Many of us have full time jobs and families, but we strive to be an efficient, organized group that never loses sight of the community and friendships that make Classic special. We will always help our own, never use buzzwords, or treat people like meat to fill a raid group. **We are the masters of our own fate.**
---
Raids are anticipated to begin in November/December. They will have a 10-15min Break partway through, and a third day, Saturday, is reserved for World PvP and Premades. I’m looking for community oriented people with a serious mindset that want to get in on something that’s just a little bit different. There are no cliques here, no previous guilds, and no group of real life friends that have been gaming together since the third grade - It’s just us. And we’re going to have a good time doing things our own way.

GET HER TO PLAY WITH YOU
---
I think Retail itemization lacks the unique hang of it. I think it's sad that when you join in 5 months after an expansion hit you don't have to do the first Raid anymore and nobody will play it. Raids should always grant a few special items that are still useful for 1-2 upcoming raids. An Addon should be a story/gameplay as one whole thing and not 5 shattered pieces that are connected only by the location.
---
Im C and a mix of 2 and 3. Which is how many hours Im looking at per day. A really good day I might get 4 hours.
---
You can clear LFR with just the two tanks you get queued with. It's not quite *that* easy.
---
Up the irons!
---
The other piece, besides using the biggest heals-per-mana ratio, is the "five second rule". For 5 seconds after your character spends mana, you don't regenerate mana. So e.g. if you cast-wait-cast-wait-cast-wait, you will run out of mana faster because you never get out of the 5sr to regen. But if you cast-cast-cast-wait-wait-wait-cast-cast-cast-wait-wait-wait, you will get some regen in.
---
In practice, what it means for me is: I wait as long as I can (safely) wait to heal, then do two heals in a row -- my biggest / most efficient heal (e.g. greater heal) and then, immediately after, some prophylactic heals like a renew or a shield or both. Then you wait again. The renew and/or the shield mean that it takes longer for him to get back into danger, so you can regen for a couple of extra seconds before you need to cast again.
---
Similarly, if there is some DPS who needs a heal, I'll try to wait until I heal the tank. So i'll do like wait, wait, wait, greater-heal-on-tank, renew-on-tank, renew-on-dps, wait, wait, wait, wait... 
---
In other words: try to batch up your heals, so that you can wait longer between heals. Because if you wait more than 5 seconds, then you'll get some mana back.
---
(An important detail: the 5 seconds starts when your character spends the mana -- i.e., at the end of the case. So if you start casting a greater heal, say, and then just before it goes off you see that you don't need it and you cancel it (e.g. by moving or jumping), then it doesn't "count" and you are still regenerating mana for the whole time.)
---
Warlock
---
Aside from a few obvious games(classic wow), I've shifted away from online games just for this reason. BoTW and Mario Odyssey are two fantastic single player games that create an unknown world just like how vanilla felt when I was a kid. I remember asking my friend who was further in FF8 than me, how he got that cool summon and he would ask me how I got this awesome deck. Just like in vanilla when you would ask "where does my T0 helm drop" or "how did you become a ninja!". The mystery is gone in multi player games but at least in single player you can isolate yourself.

Generally bullying can only happen in places where the person is obligated to be which forces them into a situation they can't readily escape from without other repercussions. There can be some slight variance there, like if the person would otherwise *want* to be somewhere and they have every right to be, but their bully is often there and will make it bad for them instead. In comparison, the internet literally isn't even a place, it's just a channel of communication that any given person has complete control of.
---
Cyberbulling and actual bullying aren't even vaguely the same and acting like they are is honestly pretty despicable.

You didn't know. Many of us knew. I had a BiS list by late 2005.

Ah yeah, mixed those two. Its decent skill, but i think the meta is more PI spec in general. Healing usually isnt the problem early on. You carry more heals than you need in MC and BWL ( to have them in AQ and naxx ).
---
Fear is not as good as sheep, but it's better than most other CCs, you just have to be smart about it and have curse of recklessness ready. 
---
There's also plenty of mobs that you can banish in higher level dungeons.

An host of lectins, inflammatory compounds and mold and pesticides. Nuts are not health foods, not at all. The food pyramid is gimmick for the ignorant masses while the elite (not the pawns) enjoy meat and animal products en masse as they are the most bioavailable and nutrient-dense foods on the planet. Meanwhile they want the "slaves" the eat grains and shift toward poorly nutritive plant based diets.

Probably a bit over explicative but hey I've got to help. Nuts suck.

**&lt;The Crimson Knights&gt;** [Horde] [NA] [PVP] [Casual]
---
__**Guild Information:**__ We were a relatively small guild in retail that disbanded. It's now just me and I'm looking to build a completely new guild for classic. I have a discord server set up and a website for use, but now I lack people. If you've ever wanted to build a guild come fall in on my existing tools and lets build one together. Through recent recruitment I have **20** confirmed for release.
---
I want to re-create that **community** feeling of vanilla, I understand people are older now, and a lot of us have lives outside of the game. That being said I hope to gather enough people and push leveling, assist where we can and push end game content. We're not going for world or server first. Put simply a group of people, wanting to build a community first and have some fun playing a version of wow we want to play.
---
__**Our Mission:**__ To Focus on Community First! I want to create the old guild feeling of a “family” away from family. I want to help new people who never played vanilla experience it for the first time, and give veteran players a more casual experience from some of the more hardcore guilds out there. A group of people that first and foremost enjoy playing the game together. All of the raiding team politics and such comes second.
---
__**What I'm Looking For:**__ I'm looking for patient people who wants to build a guild up from the start, really have it be their own. People who are more excited for the hardcore experience of classic and who remember what community in this game meant. People who agree with the statements above and actually want to work to make it happen.
---
__**How to Reach Us:**__ If this is something that seems appealing to you, you can reach out to me on discord [hotkarlprfc#5722] with questions or simply join the guilds discord. I hope to hear from you!
---
**Discord:** https://discord.gg/9DbzhEm

All you need is one glancing blow to occur that doesn’t fall into the flat rate model to ruin the flat rate model. Which they have had happen. That is why Beaza’s numbers are accepted as the numbers. It’s the only model that isn’t flat rate.
---
It’s not a jump it’s just how it works. If you choose to use hardcoded flat rate, anything that happens that isn’t flat rate ruins that model.

Invictus Now Recruiting PvP/Alliance/NA/Semi-Hardcore/EST
---
Introduction
---
We are long-time MMO/ WoW players that are new to the vanilla WoW Experience and are looking for more similar and likeminded players to form a community experience with.
---
Member expectations
---
We understand that some members have jobs and schedules that may prevent them from regular participation. However at this time we do expect some level of activity, we do seek to accommodate players who may find themselves unable to frequent scheduled guild activities.
---
Atmosphere
---
We are a laidback and chill guild looking to build up a community  to play Classic with rather than play the game as a 2nd job.
---
PVP
---
For phase one we will be encouraging WPvP and city raids while we build a repuation as a notorious PvP guild in our server’s community. For Phase 3 and beyond we would like to begin farm rank 10s through premade bgs. Should there be a demand for it then an Elite placement team pushing for ranks 11-13 is to be expected.
---
PVE
---
Our events schedule includes phase one raiding and beyond. Our goal is not min maxing but a fun raiding experience in our own time. We will be using the loot council system in the utmost fair way possible for efficiency and fairness.
---
Schedule
---
Raiding on Tuesday and Wednesday 8:00 - 11:00 P.M Eastern Time. PvP events will be spontaneous until further notice (Phase 2)
---
Recruitment
---
We are currently looking to recruit a warlock and mage class lead. Please be knowledgable about the specs and be able to help others with performance and be able to work with others on the loot council. We also have open slots on our raid team.
---
Message me or an officer to get into the discord or for any additional details and our special organized guild events.
---
Our GM Valdaram can be reached at Valdaram#1800 on bnet or if you prefer Discord you can reach Valdaram at Valdaram#7767. Our recruitment officer is also available Fenix#2358
---
Yep. I still have my Hydrocane on my original hunter. It was cool as hell to bust out a level 27 staff to fight underwater monsters at level 55. That thing meant something to me. It looked cool. I felt like I had worked hard to get it. Even though hundreds of “better” weapons had dropped since the then, it was still useful enough to carry once all the others had been vendored. That was back when blue weapons actually felt “rare”.
---
It's interesting that they split the player base in half for all pve content. 
---
I guess I'll take Druid off my short list then. I don't care to be pressured into roles. If the group needs someone to fill that role occasionally that's fine, but if it's gonna be the expectation whenever I play that character I'm not even going to bother making one. I won't enjoy grinding a character to 60 and then not playing it.
---
Thanks for the breakdown of everything! It's all super helpful knowledge to get me started.
---
I will have both an alliance and horde character in order to gain access to all the lore
---
i remember the grind ... think i hit GrandMarshal once and never touched pvp again
---
pen and paper, haha
---
??? ???
---
Literally nowhere did i say we shouldve informations by now just because azshara is dead. Thats what you people implied.
---
Jesus christ people are just waiting to nitpick on anything anyone says to get offended and Start argueing.

He asked me to make it for him, and we had a lot of back and forth of "How does this look? Should I do XYZ?" while I made it. I actually spent a lot more time on it than he expected, and I offered to do more (I'd like to make it more tattered) but he told me he really likes it as is.
---
Is it possible to go to the quest in Blade Edge Mountains where you have to collect the plagueheart lookalike helm, shoulder, chest pieces and equip them and never turn in the quest to keep those pieces forever, like if you wanted to look fancy while fishing?

Took me about 20 mins for movement to feel natural, I forgot a and d weren't strafe by default.

**&lt;That’s Rough Buddy&gt; |A| NA EST PvP** Is a group of individuals who have a deep passion for World of Warcraft. Some of us even meeting back in 2005 creating great friendships that have lasted 14+ years. Currently our roster is sitting at 30+ dedicated members who are active on discord or playing together on private servers to pass the time waiting for release.
---
We are looking for all players who want to be part of a Semi-Hardcore guild planning to be in the top 5 for our server to clear Naxxramas. This will mean raiding 2-3 times a week with attendance needing to be on the high side as well as knowledge of your class or willingness to learn to help us get over those hurdles on tough boss fights.
---
Raid Schedule for Phase 1:
---
Tuesday - 7-10pm EST (Molten Core)  
---
Wednesday - 7-10pm EST (Molten Core if not finished, Onyxia’s Lair)  
---
Monday - 7-10pm EST (Optional day if we need for Molten Core clears)
---
Our raiding philosophy is to have fun while staying focused and clearing content at a fast pace. Watching boss strategies, proving you understand the boss encounters and your role will be required to join raid groups as well as a minimum gear level with full enchants and consumables. Once those requirements have been met, mistakes won’t be punished, we’re here to laugh, to cry, to kill and get killed by bosses as a team.
---
Loot will be Loot Council based:
---
We will be keeping track of attendance as well as amounts of gear acquired.  
---
Loot will be dealt with a couple things in mind by our council members:
---
How has this person contributed to the guild?  
---
Does this person show up on time and regularly to raids?  
---
Does this person know their class and perform?  
---
Who will this piece of gear benefit the most to help the guild as a whole?
---
Currently recruiting every class besides fury warriors.
---
Please add me on discord @Smalls#5019 for more information!
---
KEEP YER FEET ON THE GROUND!
---
I never understood this.
---
it's ppm? The skill description says 20% chance.
---
We did the WW axe quest on beta at level 30 with only 3 people including our warrior. It’s not hard at all. We easily killed the mobs as Warrior/Enhance/Priest. You guys vastly overestimate how hard this game is when you know what you’re doing.
---
Dwarf priest, because the alliance doesn't have shaman and dwarves are always drunk.
---
You two aren't using the same terms.
---
When you say "good itemization," you mean, "A healthy mix of items for the player to choose from."
---
When he says "good itemization," he means, "Items with good, useful stats to the class."
---
Personally I judge his use of the term to be more common/correct.
---
I read somewhere that many streamers will opt for PvE servers - take that with a grain of salt
---
R14 weapons are BiS until Naxx for rogues and Warriors. Getting R14 as close to server/honor system start as possible lets you reap that benefit the longest.
---
The dictionary counts how people say it and English speakers don't know about the Tsu sound. In Japanese it definitely isn't silent.

It's kind of like how the dictionary now lists figuratively as a possibly definition of literally.

Mmmm I always played balance druid but want to give holy/Prot a try :p
---
Also iT sounds cool to me that ill be a masterwork hammersmith as a paladin.
---
lemau 1/10 troll
---
He doesn't want me to 😭 If he changes his mind and wants that though, I'll totally do it.
---
I played beta rogue, and I was pleasantly surprised the tooltip actually worked, because like you, it always displayed 0 for me. However, on beta, at level 40 it was showing like ~77 armor reduction (could have been 60, I'll have to check my screenshots/vods when I get home). But it did definitely display a value on the tooltip.
---
This. I’m not looking for changes overall, but if they did decide to tweak Paladins to make them (better) viable for tanking, I would not be upset.
---
DM lasher runs 
---
DM hyena runs 
---
BRD hound/spectator farm 
---
These dungeons are good to farm because there is obv no competition when you phase into an instance.
---
The higher level zones such as Eastern Plaguelands, Silithus, and Burning Steppes can also be farmed. I like to target humanoids more so than beasts when I’m rounding up a bunch, because humanoids can drop cloth and potions. Beasts tend to drop a lot of gray scrap items, but those can also be lucrative when you have a few stacks to vendor. However, you will most likely come across direct competition/PvP farming in the open world.
---
My favorite part is always getting to Steamweedle Port and I don't really know why. It's so cosy and it starts you off on the second part, of your journey to 60.
---
I feel you man, im in the same boat and will be playing a priest or pally.
---
Just have a similar naming scheme to all of your alts IE Peonjim, Glipglopjim, Serfjim, Nwordjim, Slavejim etc
---
I played an SM-Ruin lock in vanilla and i thought it was loads of fun. never recall being that far behind on the meters at all. you get your set items quite fast as you will only be 1 of 2 (maybe 3) warlocks in the raid and because warlocks scale so well with gear because of lifetap and obviously damage you notice a strong increase every time you get a few upgrades and it really pushes you forward. 
---
the soul shard issue everyone bangs on about is not an issue, takes 5 minuets to full a massive shard bag up before a raid and it will probably be full after the raid too because of all the trash.
---
also alliance always have a shortage of warlocks.
---
a mage is expected to win every duel and top meters, go stand out and do that but with a warlock!
---
Those teeth.
---
&gt; you can deal 1.6k sustained dps on feral druid on a 0 armor boss for 5 minutes.
---
I'd like to see that. Not only is this 500 dps higher than the highest recorded feral dps on legacyplayers. 
---
But I'd also like to see the boss fight, which lasts 5min with people doing that much dps.
---
People who don't understand the concept of guilds yet join anyway and cause constant bullshit
---
Always was like that in classic.
---
That people will join mostly to horde because they are playing there in current wow
---
I miss old Scholomance so much.
---
I've played on private servers, but haven't done anything past level 40 (not to spoil myself too much) and Scholo and eastern plaguelands are what I'm most looking forward to!
---
That people will join mostly horde because they are playing there in current wow
---
Let me know what server you plan on. Ill be playing heals on alliance.
---
No doubt!
---
rep grind for another factions mount
---
If you had an active sub in NA, during beta and/or stress test, you have it.
---
If you are in NA and have an active sub, you should have it. Reinstall Bnet launcher.
---
If you are in EU and don't have an active sub AND you didn't had an active sub in NA on another account on same Bnet launcher during beta / stress test, you don't have it.
---
If you have an active sub in EU, but you didn't participated in beta and stress tests on NA, you won't have it.
---
It really sucked to lose that. I'd love it if someone could fix that and re-release this.
---
Steady Shot
---
Spellsteal, ice lance, vampiric touch, pain supression.
---
I like Tauren a lot... but i would prolly play a troll priest since taurens cant be priests
---
I applied! Didn't make it. 😞
---
That’s a good one.
---
Totally agree, SL is best spec for bad gear !
---
Aka head out of the clouds
---
Came here for this; such a key part of the kit. Either that or Cloak which is going to make clean vanishes that much harder.
---
That is a horrible idea.
---
As a Tauren I agree. I think thats why I like the twin colossals so much. It reminds me of the towering mesas of Thunder Bluff.
---
Strength and honour friend
---
A good priest will be happy to do it.
---
They didn’t do anything the first time, so why change it
---
Most of those accounts will pay the $15 monthly charge so blizzard won’t care
---
enjoy death
---

**&lt;IRONFIST&gt; Horde &gt;&gt; NA CST &gt;&gt; PvP &gt;&gt; Tues/Thurs 8:00-10:30 Raid with Sunday Cleanup**  
---
I'll make this quick... **IRONFIST is an adult community**, by this we mean that it is understood everyone had Family, work and other obligations in life. Things come up and shit happens, so you are not punished if you cannot play WoW: Classic 24/7. We also get that your escape from things is playing games, and nothing is worse than some toxic troll of a player. Those toxic people, yea we remove them.
---
**Raids:** We raid on Tuesday and Thursday from 8:00 pm to 10:30 pm CST. We have a Clean up raid on Sundays but the time is announced by the raid leader. 
---
**PvP:** Yea we PvP, we are on a PvP server. We protect our own.
---
Questions? message me here or hop onto our discord: [www.ironfist-gaming.com](https://www.ironfist-gaming.com) (link brings you to discord)
---
 **&lt;Relapse&gt; \[H\] US East-PVP**
---
We are a Horde based guild, specifically catering to those who want to raid casually, but just don't have the time anymore to commit tons of hours into the game. The bulk of our group is "9 to 5ers" who work, have families, or other commitments that prevent a more hardcore schedule.
---
We want to be an effective and efficient guild, clearing what we can, when we can. Make no mistake, we will experience all content of Vanilla, simply at a slower pace.
---
**Raid Times:**
---
Our Official Raid Times are as follows:
---
**Tuesday:** 8:30PM EST - 12PM EST
---
**Thursday:** 8:30PM EST - 12PM EST
---
There is a chance we do cleanup on the weekends and possibly 20 mans, but that is up in the air and dependent on if people want to/are available.
---
**Loot Rules:**
---
We will use EP/GP. We will use NO loot council (outside of very specific items, such as Thunderfury for the main tank) as it lacks transparency and perceived fairness.
---
**Recruiting Needs:**
---
We are currently recruiting players who want to roll Mage, Hunter, and 1 Druid (Resto or Feral DPS). We are also always looking for exceptional players!
---
If a casual guild for you "9 to 5ers" sounds enticing, please PM me and I can send you the Discord link.
---
Only 2 things can really stop them.
---
No one buying gold and WoW tokens. Since there will always be people who will buy gold the only thing blizzard can really do is add WoW tokens. No one wants that though so we’ll probably just have to deal with the farmers/bothers/phishers.
---
Unless you are the tank you don't really need any resistance gear in MC. Fire resistance could be useful on a fight like Rag but isn't required. There is a drake in BWL that you'll probably want to use some FR gear for (I want to say I used 100-150 on a mage) or you'll have very low dps uptime - also may not be necessary anymore.
---
Nature res gear is the important one for AQ40, but that is also class dependent. You only need ~20 people iirc, including tanks, with NR and most or all of that will be your melee. Everyone will need Frost Resistance at the end of Naxx but I believe most of that comes from patterns gotten from the raid itself.
---
That helpless feeling when you want to do a dungeon -- but you're at the end of a gaming session and don't have enough time to complete one.
---
I consider the time where LoL was my main-game one of the lowest points of my life. The game made me so miserable but I couldn't stop.
---
Arms Warrior? If you think you gonna get BRE without respeccing 2h fury, think again. Its BiS for fury too and arms is not pve spec.
---
It's a tough wait. One thing is certain, I have never planed my character and leveling route so thoroughly as for classic. Played on some private servers as well as original classic, tbc and wotlk. I just rolled a character and off I went for those. For classic I will have a lot planed out because of the long wait and anticipation. As long as the zones are not heavily overcrowded it will be smooth leveling that is for sure.
---
I do love myself some pvp
---
The vanilla experience had gold farmers.
---
Sure, the gold farmers are increasing gold into the economy, but they're not injecting it to every player which would cause a real inflation.  You're not going to see Zimbabwe levels of inflation.
---
Late game content is not limited to gold purchases either.  It's about having 39 other people to raid with to experience that content.  Also, it's about having time.  Players can farm 30-50 gold an hour depending on the class and/or class combo.  More than enough to "experience late game content".
---
I HAD DECIDED TO BE A NELF DRUID BUT NOW MY FRIENDS AND I ARE LEANING HORDE SUDDENLY TO PLAY WITH MORE PEOPLE AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO, I WANT MY CHARACTER TO BE PRETTY NOT A DAMN COW.
---
&gt; Like I said to somebody else: it's like saying that online bullying is not bullying because it's virtual.
---
This is a ridiculous comparison.  PvP'ing in a PvP zone is not bullying in any way.  It's literally just playing the game.  No one's under any obligation to care about what activity you're trying to accomplish - the whole premise of a PvP zone is that you can be attacked by any member of the enemy faction for any reason.
---
I used Chromium browser automation to take a screenshot of every page, followed by taking a rectangle cut by recognizing the dimensions and location of the icon and tooltip based on pixel values. 
---
The last step was to modify the alpa channel for pixels matching the ones that should be deleted.
---
They can get quite annoying spamming in Ironforge. Just add them to your ignore list and report them as spammers.
---
Can't do much else.
---
Once the newbies get a taste for old orgrimmar, and see the fancy pants alliance hanging out in castle town, some will stay and many will jump ship. On a serious note picking horde just for some random pvp dreams is just silly. Pvp is a small section of the overall game and requires real effort in pve to get the gear needed at high level pvp, and without arenas retail pvp players will get bored quickly.
---
Hehe. Just you wait until Cthun where you have to trust all 40 or some tard is going to wipe the raid :)
---
I'm fretting over picking my main so hard because I'll only have the time for the one character. Never been huge on alts anyways.
---
I think he wants to 100% heal during raid, but play elemental in down time in bgs/world pvp. Which is doable up to and through BWL.
---
I always thought it was because dwarves, in a lot of fantasy settings, absolutely *hate* flying or not always being on the ground. Because they come from mountains and such
---
Running to dungeons.  Now don't get me wrong, I hated LFR, LFG and I don't want them at all.  But if the summoning stones worked it'd be nice.
---
I don't think OP asked you for an opinion of paladin tanks or your group preferences? 
---
You do however sound a bit like a self-important dick when you try to tell other people how they should play or enjoy the game, based on your own exaggerated experiences.
---
 **I Need Friends** **~~to Play Classic With~~**
---
It changes if you're leveling with someone else. The reason paladins do ok solo is because they don't have to use a lot of mana to expend damage and they can utilize spirit regen particularly well because their damage is mostly auto attack based. So basically they just minimize down time really well because of their healing and mana stability (and superior armor). However, if you have someone else doing damage, the balance is thrown completely out of wack and you'll have nothing to spend your mana on because your damage intake has been greatly reduced because mobs are dying quicker.
---
The bottom line is that most other classes translate their mana into damage better than paladins can, so when the name of the game is expend damage quickly because we don't have to worry about self-sustain as much, paladin's speed contribution suffers greatly compared to the other classes.
---
&gt; This means ~46 auto attacks in 120 seconds
---
No, a 30% attack speed bonus means weapon speed/1.3 attack speed, not weapon speed * 0.7. So, the atk speed with flurry is 2.85, not 2.59. So only 42 attacks with 100% flurry uptime, that'S 48 total, so 9.5 expected procs, which means 4 extra procs over those 2 minutes, still 40% higher than the expected number and that's with  100% flurry uptime, which is unreasonable.
---
&gt; You forgot the 5% bonus from talent + his own Agi totem
---
I did add the talent, but I forgot the totem.  The gear lsit shows 20.8%. Considering he loses 4.8% crit agaisnt bosses, his crit chance owuld have been 25% chance then, so 38% is still far above the expected crit chance.
---
&gt; AA are at 550 dps, meaning with flurry and WF something around 1k per white hit (mean for crit and non crit)
---
Windfury has an AP bonus, so deals more dmg than a standard white hit. At 800 AP and Sulfuras Stormstrike should do around 500-550 dmg against a 0 armor target. 1k average is way overboard.
---
Super Best Friends - Alliance US (EST) PVE - Family/Raiding
---
Synopsis: Super Best Friends was originally created in TBC to house real life friends in our new leveling experience. During a Zul'farak run, where my prot paladin had a newly-acquired Flurry Axe, I impressed some randoms with my 1337 Dps and invited them into the guild. This bloomed and soon we had many friends of friends of friends! Now I come back 12 years later, having tracked down a number of those friends and decided to try my hand again at running a guild.
---
Focus: Leveling and PVE - While we don't frown upon PVP, and frankly I probably enjoy it the most out of our team, we will mostly be focusing on raids, using a system of DKP which fits our playstyle.
---
Playstyle: Casual/Raid Focused - Let's be honest, we're not in college anymore, and most of have full time lives, working or taking care of our families, or both. I know I have a daughter on the way, and plenty of us have responsibilities. However, we are all WoW veterans and have a good understanding of Vanilla raiding. Wed/Thurs 6pm-10pm(11pm if progression) EST.
---
Motto: "We'll make it work"
---
Are we a good fit? - We are a guild with realistic outlooks towards the game. We all want to raid and enjoy the magic that is Vanilla WoW together, but within the appropriate scheduling of our real lives. We are also older now, which isn't a requirement, but understand that most of the guild to start will be around 30+. We are not going to have squabbles over nonsense, be relaxed while enjoying what the game has to offer. We will joke and kid around, but if anyone starts to bother another, it will be dealt with appropriately.
---
If Interested Contact Me Directly. Thank you for reading this post.
---
Thank you. So I do not have to install standard WoW?
---
Don’t buy all the skills. Just the ones you need to level which saves a ton of coin. 
---
Get a gathering talent and gather. Add skinning for more. 
---
Vendor everything. 
---
Don’t buy stuff on AH. 
---
You’ll have the money right at 40 or darn close if you follow these rules.
---
Yes, the original video kept getting copyright strikes so it was re-uploaded with different music.
---
BASED ON MY OWN CALCULATIONS, EVERYBODY IS AN IDIOT, INCLUDING MYSELF
---
Don't train unnecessary skills (in the 30s range they're all 1g+).
---
Don't buy greens/blues from the AH. (seriously - resist - RESIST).
---
Grind mobs whenever you have a chance, and don't be afraid to vendor greens or trade goods if you know you won't be making it into town anytime soon.
---
Skinning isn't a bad shout. Just vendor the stuff until hard leather as it'll be ultra-saturated on the AH anyway.
---
Mining and sell the ore
---
FUCK MAGES
---
This man speaks the tru tru
---
This is Roy D Mercer.  Do ya'll got butt plugs?
---
There is only one correct answer to that... 
---
"Omegalol"
---
"Kappa"
---
"F in the chat" 
---
The name asmund
---
Or any other streamers name that brings attention seeking weirdos with them.
---
And any other "twitch chat" lingo.
---
&gt; I want to monetize videos
---
You need to get something along the lines of 20,000 viewed minutes of video a month to be eligible for monetization.  Making an hour long video doesn't help this is people watch it for 1 minute.
---
Therefore, don't just make the same content everybody else is.  You'll likely never reach that goal to actually monetize videos.  You're better off just trying to get a patreon going or something.
---
Auto shift when casting spells, being able to drink pots in form, or talk to npc’s in form.
---
The one mod I wish I could remember the name of (or if it is even around anymore) is one that tracks all the kills you've done to each mob/level.  In the tool tip it would put the mob info, but also say you've killed this specific level and mob type x amount of times.
---
Just loved seeing how many times I've killed a spider, or murloc.   "Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds"
---
It depends on the situation, obviously, but in general I don't think this is true. I used a genetic algorithm to optimize the healing over a given duration, (for a druid, but it's the same idea), and it seems to have homed in on this strategy of putting a rejuv on the tank after the big heal lands. e.g. here is some output: [http://drmathison.org/git/wow/output/healing-rotation-blues-90s.txt](http://drmathison.org/git/wow/output/healing-rotation-blues-90s.txt)
---
Too many to count, really, but I'll try my best:
---
&gt;Sap never breaking stealth (even imp. sap still had a 10% chance to break)  
---
&gt;Combat traps for hunters  
---
&gt;Life grip for priests  
---
&gt;Crusader strike, or an actual taunt on paladins  
---
&gt;Combat charge for warriors  
---
&gt;The preset totem placer for shamans (whatever it was called)  
---
&gt;Drain soul doing more damage in execute phase for warlocks  
---
&gt;Bleeds actually being good for druids (I hate shred/F. Bite spam)
---
Leveling a warrior as arms, horde side. 
---
- only learn important skills and skillranks. 
---
- don't buy anything from the auction house whatsoever
---
- take skinning + mining. I'll send the mining mats to an alt, sell the leather to an NPC and later on on the auction house. At 60, unlearn skinning and train engineering.
---
If that's not enough, I'll go ahead and grind a little at 40. For my 60 mount I'll do strat living runs and sell righteous orbs and flask recipes my guild doesn't need anymore.
---
It's going to be so much fun watching the LFR horde of players of retail meet Vael/AQ40/Naxx. Sure mythic raiding is hard. Sure theres more mechanics in dungeons. Whatever, see how you like the 10th full consume pull on Cthun because tards keep chaining.
---
There is no difficulty slider in vanilla, and some people are in for a reality check as you say. Sure, not everyone is. Good guilds will PTR and faceroll instances, clearing in 2hrs after launch. But where there's winners there's also losers, and I can't fucking wait to see people/guilds crash and burn on 'easy vanilla content'.
---
But the XP gainz!
---
# &lt;Get Off Our Lawn&gt; [Raiding/PvP | Semi-Hardcore | Alliance]
---
Why the name? We’re a bunch of working adults with families, coming back to a game we loved. Our guild is full of moms and dads, and therefore, understanding of the difficulties an MMO presents a (somewhat) responsible adult. That being said, there is no minimum age requirement as long as you are mature. Evening Raids are scheduled after Dinner Time, no pushing for server firsts, etc.
---
**Loot System:**
---
* EP/GP. EP will be rewarded only for raid-relevant actions. The moment something drops, it’s checked in loot tables which classes are eligible for it. Then it is checked who out of all these classes has the highest priority. Then this person is asked if he/she wants it. In case of pass, the next person is asked. If at any stage there is more than one person with the same priority and desire to get the item, these people roll. In case of tanking gear, MT and first OT have priority, regardless of EP/GP Priority. Priority is the following: Class &gt; Main Spec &gt; Off spec
---
**Raid Details:**
---
* Tuesday &amp; Thursday, 7-10pm EST. Hard stop guaranteed by 10:30pm. We plan to Raid twice a week, three times only if the members of our guild can swing it. Two is the goal.
---
**Who We Are:**
---
* We are focused on PvE progression, but all of our current members enjoy both BG PvP and World PvP. The focus might be PvE, but there will be plenty of opportunities for PvP, ***including organized guild events for it.***
---
* We want to invite a friendly environment full of people who love Classic WoW. We aren’t interested in drama or the people it attracts. We’re here because we want to be. You should be, too.
---
* ⁠As mentioned above, we’re all working adults and have families. We understand if you have to go change a diaper. We get it if Soccer Practice was rescheduled.
---
* ⁠DKP is based on Attendance, time spent in the raid, and boss kills. This is a better motivator to show up, than punishment, in our eyes.
---
**What We Bring to the Table:**
---
* We already have \~50 active members on Discord.
---
* ⁠Experienced leadership. Our guild leaders and many officers cleared MC/BWL/ZG/AQ40/Naxx before Burning Crusade.
---
* ⁠A social experience. We love to joke, have fun, and sarcasm is our love language. We encourage people to laugh at themselves.
---
* ⁠Helpful members who will join you for Dungeons, help on a difficult quest, or come rushing in like a flood if you’re getting ganked in STV. There’s nothing quite like riding in with 15 guildies to punish some poor Shaman who thought the leveling Priest would be his bitch.
---
* ⁠Our discord is already full of pinned messages with resources for leveling, dungeons, gear, professions, add-ons, etc. This Discord server is live and if you join us, you will be added now, so we can get to know each other.
---
**What You Should and Shouldn’t Bring to the Table:**
---
* ⁠Racism, Sexism, and Homophobia are offenses deserving of an immediate ban. No second chances.
---
* ⁠Attuned by first guild raid.
---
* **⁠Discord – this is mandatory**. You don’t *HAVE* to talk all the time, but coordinating in raids requires that you are able to hear the Raid Leader call the shots. All pertinent guild info will be on the Discord. A Website will be created and live before launch in August.
---
* ⁠Again, we know that life happens. But if you can’t make it for Raid night, please give us as much of a head’s up as possible. If there is a family emergency, it will never be counted against you. I truly, truly, don’t want to have to deal with the possibility of someone abusing this policy. So don’t make me.
---
* ⁠There will be a lot of rolling for loot in the early raids. Expect it, and expect to go awhile without getting much. As people get loot, their DKP will be lower than you, effectively pushing you up the list and making the next piece more likely to go to you. Be patient.
---
**Possibility for Promotion and Guild Advancement**
---
* We have been recruiting for a couple weeks. Currently, half of our leadership consists of RL friends, the other half has been promoted from people we have met on the forums and this Classic WoW subreddit. We will be looking for more Officers after launch, as we have a healthy-sized leadership team currently.
---
**Class Needs**
---
We are still recruiting for all classes. That being said, I have marked below how I would define our current needs, by class:
---
We have our Main Tank and Off Tank. They were recruited a few weeks ago.
---
* ⁠Druid - Low
---
* Hunter - High
---
* Mage - Medium
---
* Paladin - Medium
---
* Priest - Low
---
* Rogue - High
---
* Warlock - Medium
---
* Warrior - High (DPS); No Prot Needed
---
If you are interested, please feel free to message me here or add me on Discord. I will respond as soon as I can.
---
Also we all have jobs, so, we may not respond right away. Patience is appreciated.
---
My Discord: Shyfty#0901
---
Co-GM: Nankersore#2668
---
At that point, I would just main the Mage. I love Classic but I really don't see myself making the leveling grind twice just to have a gold farmer on the side.
---
&gt;what do you think of this kind of build?
---
&gt;build is a tank build
---
Well, it would seem that you are just plain wrong. Reading is hard.
---
But, I reckon going straight to the ad hominem has worked for you instead of reading before.
---
Okay thanks, that’s what I kind of figured as a basic start for sure. I think it might get a little trickier at higher levels when they start vendoring for good  silver/gold as well?
---
I think yall are right on not wasting gold on spells/ranks you know you’ll never use. Maybe a guide should be made, per class, on how to level effectively with a minimal toolkit.
---
I sure as shit am!
---
As a warrior, having the mobility of an out of gaz truck
---
As a rogue, having to wait to DPS because I don't have ToT
---
Undead Rogue,
---
would roll Human Rogue I guess..
---
Omg yes.  There were 2 things I wanted in wow that weren't there.  I wanted bloodlust and a log on my Tauren.  Never got the log.
---
C1 on weekends, C3 weekdays
---
I plan on making one main, and I'll have a bank alt. If I find myself having some extra time maybe a year into it, I might make a lowbie twink. I definitely will not be making another 60 however. I really just want to focus on my main this time.
---
Yes!  It will be interesting to see how people handle dungeon runs not being so short and sweet.  Most of the videos I've watched say skip dungeons while leveling unless you are there to knock out quests.
---
If we love vanilla so much, why would we give it away?
---
I think you have to only play one to be able to max out the good stuff
---
It's not really about the name. Maybe more about identity.
---
I've tried almost all classes on a Pserver and the characters are called:
---
Veganora, Vegania, Veganero, Vegany, Veganelly, Veganori, Vegandrea and Vegandhi
---
I guess people might be capable of recognizing some sort of pattern there aswell. :D
---
That's actually wholesome.
---
The pvp rank system. I liked the token system in tbc better even though they killed bg‘s with arena
---
Fine by me.  It was that way in vanilla and I was getting instant BG queues.  It was great.
---
&gt; "Join my discord"
---
Hopefully there's going to be an "unofficial realm server" so you only need to join one discord for LFG.
---
Hi, /u/igotbannedsoimback
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cjbffo/guild_recruitment_thread/).
---
My hardcore friends never ran dungeons while leveling until they got within 5 or so levels of end game. I love dungeons but they are a time sink 9 out of 10 times.
---
Parts of the loot system honestly. 
---
The retail loot shower is obviously way too much but I though BC made some nice additions with tier tokens and a bit more loot per kill. Gear was still prestiguous and desired but you had a lower chance of getting screwed by bad luck over time.
---
Heroic Leap maybe
---
Done visc over 100 times and never used sapper charges.
---
100% correct.
---
It is silly but think about people that at the beginning are searching on google things like “which class is the best/faction” of course 99% of them will not be even close to high pvp/high over level but it will be like snowball that will
---
get more and more people just like it was with current wow=more professional guilds on horde side (like 70%) no wonder that obvious answer for new player question is too join horde at start because it offer more than alliance and I’m scared that it will affect classic wow like “ohhHhHhh I’m playing horde in current wow so I’m going to do the same in classic”
---
 **Killswitch - NA Horde - PVP Server**
---
**Raid Schedule: Tuesday - Thursday ; 9 PM ET - Midnight ET.**
---
Tuesday’s main raid night. Wed/Thurs for Progression. Likely only using 1 night a week for a long time as most content can be completed in a few hours.
---
**About :**
---
Our guild is comprised of a core of raiders from various WoW Classic Servers. We enjoy raiding, BG pre-forming, and wPVP. We are looking for players who want a stable environment with a semi-hardcore raid guild. We don’t enjoy waisting our time, or yours for that matter.
---
We believe in smooth and efficient raiding. Our guild has proven experience in all raids (except for Naxx).
---
**Our accomplishments:**
---
1. Multiple Rank 13 and 14 players
---
2. Experienced Leadership with pre-made BG groups
---
3. Experienced Core clearing everything except Naxx
---
4. Veteran Leadership - our leaders have been there and done pretty much everything in Vanilla
---
5. Active, friendly core available upon launch!
---
**What we expect:**
---
1. People who can make our raid times
---
2. People who want to devote time to improving as a player, but also their character
---
3. Show up for raids with consumes, enchants, and having read/watched strats
---
4. People who enjoy ranking and PVP - note this is optional
---
5. Must be willing to show up for 90% of the raid and have 300 engineering.

#Justpaladinthings
---
That’s nice
---
I'm rolling a warlock.  That helps a ton.
---
Even though people will easily cheese it with wbuffs if they have problems, Loatheb remains a hardcore dps/consume/healer brain check.
---
Easy as it might be, it's the most expensive boss in the game, and nothing breaks a raid night quicker than a 1% Loatheb wipe :D
---
it's not fun and those men have no soul .
---
I originally played a gnome mage and orc fury warrior, and I plan on playing the same 2 classes again. I tried the others and these 2 always are most enjoyable. The main difference this time around is that I will main warrior this time around instead of mage, and hopefully find a guild to tank for.
---
Right now it looks like most of my friends will be horse so I'm going Tauren warrior and undead mage. I think I'll probably create an undead rogue to play with my brother. If we ended up going alliance I would pick human, gnome, and dwarf respectively.
---
When you have just enough time to do a dungeon, but someone ends up having to leave half way through! Looking at you WC
---
No joke, the first real bonding experience I had with my new born son was when his mom went to bed and I sat and held him with his boppy pillow and played path of exile. Grats dude.
---
Someone did actually make a guide for this and they posted it here, I'll see if I can find it.
---
Just go watch Drakedog 1-5.  He plays multiple specs, and its mostly WPVP.
---
We should see if Dairy Queen caters. Have them all get free vanilla blizzards.
---
Under normal circumstances, in a normal guild, you won’t be able to use stormstrike though
---
Summoning stones may lead you down the path some would could “retail”...lol
---
Nope.
---
Ya I'm hoping to find a list of what servers streamers are going to, so I can avoid them
---
No thanks, I choose life.
---
I see you using Joanas guide. I too am a man of great taste.
---
I dont trust those reddit surveys, they are polling hardcore playerbase
---
Baby looks like it’s lamenting over another corpse run, get used to it BABY
---
No, it's really not.
---
Compare it to a warrior. A paladin has judgment as instant dmg very early on and seal of command is basically an extra hit starting from lvl 20. A warrior reaches parity with this on lvl 40, when he has both whirlwind and mortal strike. 
---
It's deceptive how powerful seal of command can be, because it's just an auto attack buff, not an on demand instant attack. And judgement is very often neglected, even though it can deal quite a lot of dps.
---
Well I presume we are also talking about 1.12 itemization. At release there were a lot more weird dead items because of changes over the course of the beta. TBC was also kinda nice for introducing the new three-stat affixes for greens/blues and having affixes for resist+stamina.
---
No one is pre-downloading anything.
---
Pretty cow
---
0/21/30 is a good spec when you have the gear for it (AQ40&amp;NAXX)
---
Grind from 38 to 40. Gimme dem panthers!
---
Ahh a fellow Speedrun-Route Tester.
---
They have said time and again server lists comes out the day of name reservations.
---
They are, i've seen people talking about it multiple times here.
---
One example that wiped my guild was Magmadars (second boss in MC) mass fear. A feared Tank cant tank so the boss just runs wild killing healers and DPS until the tank can break fear with Berserker Rage or by having the Fear Ward buff.

Honestly, from everything that has been seen on just this subreddit, it's going to be about 50/50, with a maybe a 1-2% margin of error.  Still pretty good.  I image some servers might tip one way or the other over time, but that's just something that naturally happens.
---
The responsible thing for dps to do is chug Fire Protection Potions. Also have some arcane protection potions for Shazzrah fight. They really go a long way, dont be lazy!
---
Thanks man, my wife and I are splitting the night shift baby duties. This was my 5am bonding time before work after a night on the couch while the wife slept
---
The funny thing is that totally new players would be better off picking alliance: easier questing routes, easier to navigate zones, and later on paladins are a huge boon to the parties/raids.
---
It means "Stay Alert"
---
She caused it, she thinks it’s a game being that cute
---
That’s for sure

“Maybe I should not make pointless threads.”
---
Bingo. We are a month away, stop stressing yourself out over nothing.
---
 I guess I missed that memo as well, thanks for the heads up.
---
&gt; But it evolved, in time, into BfA. 
---
I'm not sure BfA is the worst expansion in that regard. Wrath could very well have been the height of "dailies" and what not. 
---
Mechagon and Nazjatar in 8.2 brought a lot of that back to some degree, but before that we only really had world quests and stuff for AP, which was not really time gated in the same way as actual dailies. You could just farm it for hours each day if you wanted and be done much faster (and some hardcore players did). 
---
Aside from Nazjatar I was hoping Blizzard was sort of on the right track in this regard, but now I'm not sure. Although it just feel like copy-pasted daily content from previous expansions. So it might not be too indicative of Blizzards current design direction. Mechagon, while full of similar dailies and stuff, is at least almost purely cosmetics and toys, not stuff you actually "need" to do.
---
Are you EU? Think it’s US based client accounts only atm
---
Any updates yet?
---
Ar you kidding?  that mic probably cost at least $30 or so.  Tech was just shit back then compared to what we have now.  I didn't even have a headset until TBC, and just used a standing mic from walmart.
---
We don’t need word on servers. They will be there. Some people act like it’s going to take a month to decide what server to play on.
---
Wow the currency from a videogame mostly played by middleclass first worlders is worth more than the currency from a country in economic collapse.  What an insight!
---
Can't find that with a quick search, but thanks. Seems weird to make people have to coordinate which realm with so little time.
---
Not sure, but it will take some time to grind out the 400+ runecloth stacks you need.   I recall it taking me 2-3 weeks of grinding outside of raid times.
---
I thought that too but Iron Forge has an air force. Maybe the pilots don't say it though.
---
Yeah uk, but people from eu have pre-downloaded
---
Nost wasn't the first pserver you know.
---
going to work for 8 hours before playing
---
I assume your bnet account is not an us account. So you were not part of a stress test and you cannot download the client.
---
You should be able to preload either on the global stress test or on 13th for the character creation.
---
This is what I was looking for, thank you
---
More likely late at night. Everything is sharded so there is not really "realms" any more in the world. Outside of guilds and mythic raiding, everything is just one big server for each region.
---
Technically he’s not wrong. An announced release date is vastly different than a timeframe. Blizzard also pushed back D2 and BC. None of these were ever given an announced release date.
---
I have it downloaded from the Beta period, even though I had no active sub.
---
Damage will be more than sufficient and healing kinda okay.
---
For farming the lack of Spirit-Tap will probably be missing the most.
---
My plan is to barely do anything solo at all at 60 and instead do 5-mans as an enchanter, where I'm likely to get a fair share of vendor-items, enchanting-mats and cloth to sell.
---
Are you me? That was my plan excatly. Lol
---
Penance :(
---
You make it sound so easy! You still have to.... ....errr..... Walk to Ratchet!
---
Yep this. You don‘t need to „play the AH“ or grind hours and hours of mobs. Just don‘t waste your money. Another thing is low level dungeons. I have seen plenty of people running dungeons low level because they wanted to kill the bosses for loot. They die often and repair bill is stacking up

**Pantheon** | NA PvP | Horde | US East/Central | Dedicated Raiding
---
**About Us:**
---
Pantheon is a Horde guild that will be forming on a PvP server when WoW Classic goes live on August 27th, 2019. The core of our guild is a group of friends that have been playing MMO’s and various other games together since the early 2000’s. We’re looking for mature raiders that are willing to progress through all the content WoW Classic has to offer. Our primary focus will be on PvE/raiding, but if you’re mostly interested in PvP, there will be officers heavily involved in that as well.
---
Tuesday/Sunday/Monday - 8:30-11:30 EST (This is still being discussed)
---
We will be running dungeons, attunement chains, and any other quests to help everyone get pre-raid best in slot prior to raiding.
---
**Loot:**
---
We will be using a loot council system for raid gear that drops. In our opinion, loot council is the best way to gear a guild for progression through every raid tier. The loot council will contain the GM and all class officers. We will be using the following priority: Tanks -&gt; DPS/Heals. Please understand that you will not get gear every run; however, if you’re consistently raiding with the guild, you will be rewarded gear to help with our progression.
---
**Needs:** We have a solid core of 3 tanks and 5 healers.  We're going to need DPS and a few more healers to complete our core group.  Current roster sits at around 25.  We plan on recruiting heavily once the game launches.
---
**Contact:**
---
[https://discord.gg/eqNdJu](https://discord.gg/eqNdJu) \- There's a guild app in our discord. Post a message and we can talk.
---
You gonna regain your Skills due to muscle memory and getting your brain used to WoW again.
---
I did play CS:S on a pretty high level and afterwards went with Mobas n MMORPGs. 10 years later I've played Battlefield/Overwatch and after a few weeks everything comes back.
---
&gt; Grind mobs whenever you have a chance, and don't be afraid to vendor greens or trade goods if you know you won't be making it into town anytime soon.
---
Make yourself a bank alt, friend.
---
Dual wield on shammy
---
Hunter weapon
---
They will introduce WoW tokens in the last phase or two of Vanilla if the gold farming gets out of hand (and it will). 
---
They know how to deal with gold/economy a lot better than the old days and I'm guessing they will be monitoring this closely.
---
I HAVE 9 FRIENDS THAT I WILL PLAY WITH.
---
4 OF THEM WANTS TO ROLL HUNTER JUST LIKE I WANT TO.
---
PROBABLY AM FORCED TO ROLL SOMETHING ELSE TO NOT INFLATE OUR GROUP.
---
Bro ZG isn't that hard. You can run it every 3 days. You'll get them again.
---
People will be trying to make characters with their favorite names soon. Imagine scrambling to grab your handle and your friends do as well, but on different servers because there wasn't time to coordinate...
---
I don‘t think we will ever make money on skinning. Everybody and their grandma know about it now and AH will be so damn oversaturated
---
On a side note you not scared at all? I fear the day I have a tiny baby in my hands like that, so delicate. Scary stuff.
---
You did not understand what he was saying at all. It was a "funeral" where some people wanted to pay respect to their irl dead  friend. For people to disturb that funeral is shitty thing to do. Try to imagine you were in a funeral of a dear friend(if you have any) and some assholes came and disturbed that funeral.
---
I’ve always been one for playing everything, Paladin is definitely a very fun class though. So if your looking for something a bit different, give it a go. Everything’s fun though!
---
They say: "Keep your feet off the ground!"
---
It should have only been possible to preload with an us accout because of the stress test. There might be people that created an us acc for the stress test even from the EU.
---
I think the pvp meta is going to change by phase 4. You have a lot of R14 teams win trading and queue dodging. If this gets addressed(as it should) and R14 teams can no longer avoid playing each other it will force the horde to adapt to counter the BoF+Warrior centric style. I think horde mages will opt for fire over frost for heavy burst. Warlocks will be more popular, possibly destruction. Can't heal what's already dead. No need to struggle to CC when they can't kill you anyway.
---
Human 1-30 loop to the end of Duskwood.  All the private servers I've played on have been Horde, but this was by far the most fun leveling I every remember having.  I feel like I still remember the first time running from Redridge into Duskwood and just having my eyes light up.  Then you see Stitches and he beats the shit out of you.  Duskwood is my fav in the game.
---
you lost me at (including resists)
---
As piss easy as 1337 heroic raiders will find Vanilla, there is also the zerg of LFR tards which will run into Vael/Cthun/Naxx and fall flat on their face. There's no easymode, there's no difficulty slider, and many of the guys coming in to 'finish' the game will never complete Naxx.
---
I have my popcorn ready, every time we remind ourselves how easy vanilla, its even more salt in the wound for guilds who can't clear. It's going to be hilarious.
---
&gt; Looking at VIDs of our first Ragnaros kills hurts so much..
---
My buddy showed me his old first rag kill and he was mouse clicking skills.  And he was one of our best priests in the guild as well.  Also, we weren't some chump group doing Rag a year after release, we were doing it in the summer of 2005 so it was peak of progression raiding.
---
&gt; The real challenge was getting 40 People together at the right time / correctly prepared.
---
That's the whole thing.  We figured we had somewhere along the lines of 15-25% dead weight in our raids.  More or less they were just soaking up DKP and under performing as their class.
---
No thanks... Time to research a different class so I can at least be a troll.
---
I don't really see an issue with WoW Tokens without other MTX. If Blizzard doesn't do it random scammers will.
---
Its still funny, though
---
Warlock Shadowfury.  This was by far my favorite ability in the game and was awesome with Demonic Circle.
---
Indeed ;)
---
Watching the state of Gnomeregan I wouldn't trust that guild a lot.
---
I have a wife and she is just as hateful as me.
---
Been mentioned a dozen timeso on Reddit and is potentially under the FAQs.
---
Hate&gt; (EU, Horde, PvP server) is recruiting knowledgeable raiders !
---
~ Open for (almost) all classes ~
---
​
---
About us:
---
Back in the days of glory, &lt;Hate&gt; was one of the top dogs on Boulderfist-EU (2006). More than a decade later, we are excited to announce that &lt;Hate&gt; is still alive !
---
Having a fine legacy in both Raiding and PvP, &lt;Hate&gt; scourged Boulderfist-EU, being nicknamed the “High Warlords Guild”, since we had the biggest amount of R14 players (names like Quatro, Zoby, Efe, Artificial, Hiphopyoyo, High come to mind). On the PvE scene, we almost cleared AQ40 and reached Naxxramas, and if we wouldnt’ve been a bit late to the party, with TBC around the corner, those raids would’ve been toast too. On a side note, we invented several strategies that are used even now, ahh, the times when everything was at first hand and you couldn’t possibly find tips and tricks like today...
---
Our plan is to rebuild &lt;Hate&gt; and push the envelope even further, aiming to assemble a very competitive raid that will last from first UBRS raid till Naxxramas. However, should be noted this time we’lll use a slight different approach and not go for the full hardcore experience. Instead, &lt;Hate&gt; will start as a semi-hardcore guild, thriving to build a really tight community of talented players that will be able to overcome everything. Now that we are older (but wiser!), we are fully aware that WoW Classic is a game that doesn’t evolve around who clears Molten Core fastest, but around which guilds still exist by the time serious stuff like AQ40 and Naxxramas is released. And as you probably know by now, statistics are quite grim: over 80% of the starting raiding guilds fail at clearing Blackwing Lair. Hence our approach.
---
​Intended raid/play times:
---
&lt;Hate&gt; is going to raid on Mon, Wed and Sun, from 19:00 (CET Timezone). Each raiding session will last around 3-4 hours.
---
Aditional info:
---
- While the guild will be very active on the PvP scene, &lt;Hate&gt; will remain a raiding guild at it’s core;
---
- Regarding the loot system, we intend to implement our own DKP system, however Loot Council is still not off the table yet. It all depends if we can finish in time our custom DKP addon.
---
Bottom line:
---
​So, if you trully know that you are a talented player, don’t be shy and apply at https://www.hate-guild.eu/ ​ or check our Discord here https://discord.gg/8HqvwAK
---
May this be the start of something truly spectacular.
---
*​P.S. Here it is, for your viewing pleasure, our first Nefarian kill, 2006 Boulderfist - EU.

Those guides seem to show all available skills at any given level, not which skill should be purchased and which should be skipped.
---
yeah you're probably right, thanks for being helpful
---
Ew. No Way. Please say you're trolling. That thing is cancer. 
---
"We're running content that drops 410 gear but you must have 420 gear to come"
---
With zero interaction ahead, during or after you actually party with them.
---
Do something wrong? KICKED! You're expendable.
---
Gold farming and selling was huge back in the day so it won't ruin things anymore than it did in the past.  Only real question is wether or not blizzard will allow tokens, which would at least put a floor on the price and encourage players to not deal with gold sellers.
---
Imagine stressing out over a hypothetical situation.
---
They’ll probably announce servers that morning and then open up name reservation.
---
Here’s what it will take:
---
“Oh look, servers are posted.”
---
@everyone on discord: we are on server X
---
Done.
---
Dps is not everything, this was a milestone in style!
---
Boring,  dank memes wannabe.
---
This is the only correct answer.
---
Having to wait potentially hours during off times for a BG to even pop.
---
Running the same instance 7 times in a row and still not have my obscure mail/leather Spell Power gear in phase 1 drop.
---
Well it always bothered me that an Elf who lives for who knows how long, probably running around there whole life in teldrasil and the woods, being one with nature and everything, has worse running form than my grandma. I don't think the Elves having bad form had anything to do with blizzard trying to do it on purpose.
---
The entire Dwarf 1-20 experience. I made so many alts back in the day and they were practically all Gnomes and Dwarves so Dun Murogh, Loch Modan, and Wetlands are particularly nostalgic for me.
---
I'm guessing if you had stress test or testing access you get to download Classic. I'd be surprised if devs wouldn't let people pre download so you shouldn't worry about it.
---
Duskwood
---
Really thematic zone. Creepy atmosphere, graphics, music, undead mobs, etc. Great quests (best in the game imo), both from a story perspective and a gameplay perspective.
---
What class are you playing? Because my guildy made a guide just like that for Druid, and he based it off a pre-existing mage guide that I could dig up as well.
---
look how pretty you are
---
Dont try and keep everyone topped off. Wait for the tank to get low and hit them with your most current ranked heal. Dps get heals if they are low and the tank isnt. But do not try and top off throughout the fights or you will go oom very fast.
---
are you sure? DBM is the highest selection. Downloaded it and the first folder is called Azeroth - BFA and there is a zuldazar folder. Doesn't look like classic to me
---
You want to ask whatever it is you're trying to ask in English. I can make an assumption but I'd like to sertin.
---
I don't know. I'm not sure what classes will I level in classic, but probably I'll be leveling and testing some of them until I find myself leveling a main.
---
My options are
---
Alliance:  
---
Male Nelf -&gt; Druid
---
Female Nelf -&gt; Hunter
---
Male Human -&gt; Warrior
---
Female Human -&gt; Warlock
---
Male Human -&gt; Paladin
---
Horde (all male):
---
Tauren -&gt; Shaman
---
Orc -&gt; Warrior
---
Orc/Tauren -&gt; Hunter
---
Undead -&gt; Rogue
---
Undead -&gt; Warlock
---
can't they mark the money as black, which can't be used to buy stuff??
---
It's still the best thing we have in terms of basing our estimates on.
---
What difference between people on reddit and people not on reddit would warrant to expect a significantly different thought process on picking their class?
---
Literally no one is saying you can't pvp as enhance, it's well known how strong WF + Frost Shock is
---
1. Freaken adorable
---
2. Reporting you for account sharing with a new born, trying to get any advantage you can I see...
---
That’s the dumbest shit?  That’s literally what they fucking said you moron.  They said no for launch but they will add it later if people still want it.  That’s your answer.  Why is this so hard to understand?
---
Really, C'Thun itself was pretty straight forward once they did the hotfix change.  It was more of a coordination fight than anything.  Naxx had a lot of gear checks from Patchwerk, Loatheb to buff up on consumables/buffs, Saph for resist gear.  There were lesser guilds on our server that were clearing the spider wing and the first boss or two in some others, minus Patchwerk.
---
Going to play Orc Hunter. If forced to switch (gross), I would play Dwarf Hunter, I think.
---
Cloak of Shadows. Obviously. Get dotted, die.
---
I'm bifactional as a matter of course.
---
I mean, I'm sorry if you have so few friends that it is easy to coordinate. But maybe others have multiple friend circles they would ideally all like to be on the same place, and *gasp* not all of them even use discord.
---
Yeah tokens are really the only realistic way to put a dent in the blackmarket.  Classic is going to be super attractive to gold farmers and hackers if they don't add tokens.
---
I didn't know this subreddit was a blog now. That's great dude, I'm really excited for you.
---
Word. The jabroni I was responding to is a troll. Nothing to see here.
---
You and me both, brother. Thousand Needles is damn near sacred for me.
---
Yep!
---
um...... you know that RP PVP was a thing already. And it wasn't like that.
---
Real gold is better than everything.
---
It'll probably be there on launch.  There's no reason for them not to be.
---
Vael would probably be the one exception.  Such a short, fast-paced encounter, that punishes any screwups.  Also on a 1 hour timer each week?  There was a reason why so many guilds (mine included) couldn't get past him.
---
Mounts/pets/toys taking space in bags, stacks limits to 20
---
Walk?!?  I'm paying the 2s or whatever for the flight!
---
What class?
---
No doubt, if people treat Classic raids like LFR they will fail. LFR has more complexity than Classic raids, but they are tuned such that you can ignore the mechanics and still survive most of the time. That won't work with Classic raids - simple does not mean ignore.
---
New dad here. Seriously the most incredible moment of my life. Holding my little girl for the first time is a moment I'll never forget. And I'm a 6'6 260lb guy, so she is soooooo tiny in comparison.
---
Is that true? Lol. Funny either way. If not, 0/10 cannot play
---
That sense of achievement tho
---
Omgggggg thank you!
---
Skilled raider looking to play shaman, comfortable healing and pvp, planning on taking herbalim + undetermined second skill
---
Available two, maybe three nights a week NA servers.
---
Well its for the best I guess. Was really looking forward to it.
---
Iirc they said the server list will be out before the character creation but this could mean hours before.

\*\*Wiping with Friends \[H\] | EU-PvP | Wed &amp; Sun | 20.00-23.00 CET | Semi-hardcore | Loot Council\*\*
---
\_\_\*\*Introduction\*\*\_\_
---
&lt;Wiping with Friends&gt; is a two-times-a-week raiding guild with a strong core of raiding veterans with experience from vanilla to BFA looking for like-minded raiders to fill the remainder of our roster.
---
Our officer team has years of experience leading guilds both on retail and on private servers to server first kills, rank 1 dps-parses and everything in between. We recognize the difficulty of leading 40 raiders to victory in an efficient manner, thus we diligently make use of infographics and other tools to become one of the top raiding guilds in our bracket.  
---
Our ambitions remain high, and we aim to clear all content Classic WoW has to offer on a tight schedule while still maintaining a friendly and fun raid environment. If you love the glory days of WoW raiding and have a competitive mindset – but don’t want to sacrifice real life to find raiding success – consider joining &lt;Wiping with Friends&gt;.
---
\_\_\*\*Member expectations\*\*\_\_ 
---
We are looking for players who:
---
\-    Can maintain 90% raid attendance
---
\-    Will show up prepared every Wednesday and Sunday night with the needed buffs and 
---
consumables\*
---
\-    Can stay dedicated to the improvement of a single character
---
\-    Are mature both in age (18+) and mentality.
---
\* Required world buffs and consumables vary between raids.
---
\_\_\*\*Raid schedule\*\*\_\_
---
We raid Wednesday and Sunday nights with first pull starting at 20.00 and raid ending at 23.00. This is a strict schedule and we will never add extra mandatory raiding days, nor will we ever ask our members to stay after 23.00 – therefore it is very important that all members show up prepared.
---
\_\_\*\*Applications and contact information\*\*\_\_
---
To apply we ask you to fill out a short questionnaire at \*\*&lt;[https://forms.gle/rWAsEWAKg82RDrHT9](https://forms.gle/rWAsEWAKg82RDrHT9)\&gt;\*\*
---
For any questions contact \*\*Jemzy#4449\*\* or \*\*Bloo#2047\*\* on discord.

This is why I will roll a warlock. Summon incoming bro.

So I told my wife about this post and she sends me this pic, apparently, my memory is pretty good. This was 4 years ago. \[Father Son bonding\]([https://i.imgur.com/iZ5vRjs.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/iZ5vRjs.jpg))
---
oooo a realm discord would be neat
---
People may have already had it downloaded from beta or previous stress tests but no one is currently downloading it.
---
You have misunderstood me or I have not expressed myself well enough: I understand that I shouldn't be stressed out about a game launching but I am because I simply put care for it and feel personally invested (especially that I already have put most likely double digit of hours into preparing some background data for myself like learning dungeon quests or what items I should try to fetch along the way).
---
I feel like I've been stripped from checking if my routes are correct before the actual launch because I was expecting there to be another stress test, which for now it seems there won't be.
---
Being an aspie isn't a mental afflication, that's one and second - I'm not going on any therapies because I don't need to, I'm doing well in life which both ability to keep my job and having a wife for several years confirm. I have my quirks still, though, and that's just one of it, unfortunately for myself.
---
I didn't make it! But everyone should give huge probs to do the dude at the top of the website for taking on this hugely important task.
---
Nice day for a memorial
---
Is there any way to remove talents on that one? Or do you have to start over to do that?
---
Yeah probably not, but skinning is probably best taken to just vendor the skins rather than sell on the auction house. It allows for grinding of beasts, if you find a decent spot, without feeling bad about not getting cloth from humanoids.
---
Solid plan for the most part, but there is a LOT to do for a fresh 60 in Vanilla. Especially on a new/fresh server. You can party up for most of it, but that'll often be inconvenient/annoying to rely on 100% of the time. That's why I feel something like this would be pretty invaluable for the first few phases, for stuff like farming, attunements, gold making, endgame quests, etc , all while being able to confidently heal all the content along the way. 
---
Losing Spirit Tap is annoying but I feel like the damage output of Force of Will and Searing Light more than make up for it; you'll just need to keep plenty of (mage) water on you.
---
Lol, I like how you try and make this personal by assuming I have no friends. I’m coordinating with 15-18 people on where we will be starting out.
---
Let me try it your way:
---
I’m sorry you have such piss poor planning capability that you can’t figure this out on your own.
---
Continuing from above, I’ll add step #2.
---
Create a group text. “Hey, we’re on server X.” Done.
---
Or make it even easier. Have those folks, gasp, download discord.
---
**&lt;Completion&gt;** Horde | East Coast NA | PvP | Semi-Hardcore  Sixty iterations off the central finite curve, there's a semi-hardcore guild named &lt;Completion&gt; that will dominate world PvP, raid Tuesday/Thursday 8-11pm, and create a family like community. Our discord has collections of all of the top class guides, profession guides, and BiS lists. Come home to the impossible guild of your own completion.    
---
**Who are we?**   
---
Our guild is run by experienced and skilled players that have played since 2004-2006. Our raid leaders have raided in vanilla through Naxx, and have raided through Naxx on private servers. Others have achieved PvP ranks ranging from Rival to Gladiator on retail, and raided at a mythic level with exceptional parses. In short, we raid to gear for PvP. We are looking to min/max our characters at a relaxed pace to dominate all aspects of PvP and PvE and have a blast doing it.    
---
**Who are we looking for?**   
---
We are looking for more like-minded players with character min/maxing aspirations with a passion for PvP and raiding to join our ranks and fill out our 40+ man roster. We are accepting all classes at the moment, but know you may be put on an "alternate" role initially, but everyone that joins will have every opportunity to earn a raid spot. We are also accepting any casual players looking for an active community.    
---
**What will we be doing?**  
---
 We will be raiding Tuesday/Thursday, 8-11 EST and will use a 25% weekly decay DKP system for loot. There will likely be a 3rd optional day added in the future during BWL progression and onwards. We also will be doing many world PvP events and PvP raids, as well as an extensive amount of premade BGs. We will make a valiant attempt at rank 14 without killing ourselves in the process. Also, we will have other weekly community events such as dueling tournaments, "where is X" events, and weekly bounties against certain Alliance players, all with gold prizes.  
---
[https://discord.gg/mZBCXmY](https://discord.gg/mZBCXmY)
---
No. The classic client is a flavour of wow client just like the PTR for example. You see the PTR in he list do you?
---
Orc hunter
---
So I mention the mana sustain/expenditure dynamic of paladins compared to other classes and you bring up the one class in the game that doesn't use mana and has infamously bad leveling? Assuming of course, you're not going to claim paladins out-dps rogues when they're not leveling solo.
---
Being next from last is not average.
---
Yes because ganking people in a video games is exactly the same as causing the death of millions.
---
And they don't sound hyped, this is an awful chore and they already know it.
---
Yeah exactly. Not to mention we're limited to 3 names per account, not per server. Knowing the realms prior to the 13th is kind of essential.
---
Hurr durr I have 20 kids now and I can't play WoW 20 hours a day anymore, show some empathy for me guys, will ya?
---
NA.
---
&gt; No, a 30% attack speed bonus means weapon speed/1.3, not weapon speed * 0.7. So, the atk speed with flurry is 2.85, not 2.59. So only 42 attacks with 100% flurry uptime, that's 48 total, so 9.5 expected procs, which means 4 extra procs over those 2 minutes, still 40% higher than the expected number and that's with 100% flurry uptime, which is unreasonable.
---
We forgot a SS, but whatever, you're right. Either we forgot about something, either he was lucky about his WF procs, either his server is way off.   
---
&gt; I did add the talent, but I forgot the totem. The gear lsit shows 20.8%. Considering he loses 4.8% crit agaisnt bosses, his crit chance owuld have been 25% chance then, so 38% is still far above the expected crit chance.  
---
I think here the problem is that pservers have the wrong calculation about crit loss vs bosses. Plus i dunno if his dummy is considered as a boss, even if it's a level 63.   
---
   
---
&gt; Windfury has an AP bonus, so deals more dmg than a standard white hit. At 800 AP and Sulfuras Stormstrike should do around 500-550 dmg against a 0 armor target. 1k average is way overboard.  
---
You forgot Strength totem, crusader buff. This is ~200 more strength (with talent for strength totem)
---
Exactly, why do people these days think that they have to Entertain their children 24/7?  I don't get it.  Let  them entertain themselves for once.  It helps a hell of a lot more than you being there all the time.  They need to stimulate that brain with their own imagination.  They also need to learn to think for themselves.  Just my two cents.
---
Aside from resilience, the world(too damn unfriendly/dark), I agree.
---
I think the people on classic wow sub are gonna be alot more prepared for the game than people going in cold Turkey that find out about classic right as its launching
---
My guild during WotLK had a very hard time finding Warriors, so we literally started calling recruits "Brown class" since they came and went like the wind. 
---
One guy stuck around for like 2 months... we started calling him by his name by then, and he changed it to "Brownclass" in-game just to fuck with us.
---
He was a great guy.
---
D1 - probably play 3 characters at launch. 1 character with the majority of friends, 1 character with my brother who has much less playtime available, 1 for solo when no one else is around. I envision that last one being the first to 60 and my main to be honest...
---
I never said it was online harassment, I'm talking about cyber bullying because somebody put the subject on the table (in a message that is now erased because there was racial slur in it) and the other guy is also talking about it.
---
So y
---
I'll have one of each class, for sure. Characters depend on which names are still free on launch.

It was scary at first, she came 6 weeks early. But now she’s finally is 1 month old and I trust her and myself a lot more. She has overcame so much and proven to be such a strong girl! She gets fussy alone, but sleeps on my chest really well. I have to give a shoutout to my Gesture chair with adjustable everything (really saves my arm and back).

Definitely, also one of the things I'm not looking forward to on classic
---
Nobody asked.

\- ETS will be a newly formed Semi hardcore/progression Alliance guild come Classic Launch (PvP server to be announced) I personally have been playing since Vanilla. Clearing all content from MC-Nax 40. 4 horseman was where I hit my first wall with both raiding guilds in classic. I was in a top US 50 guild from BC-Cata. 12xGlad across 3x multi classes. OG rank 14. I will be building a strong raiding foundation going into classic. At this time my main focus is get people who are serious on hitting max level relatively quick. Ones that are interested in taking part in officer roles even assisting or main raid leading. I am not recruiting a full roster at this time as lets face it. Most people will not level at the speed I would be happy with or just plan on being casual which is not my focus at this time. Raiding schedule will be 4x a week. Raiding time will be 8:30-11:30 Eastern time Tues-Friday

&lt;Unlucky&gt;**[NA][H][PVP][Casually Hardcore]**
---
**Timezone:**EST
---
**Raid Times:**Tuesday 8pm-11:59pm until phase 5 or when a second raid day is needed (vanilla is easy) Wednesday 8pm-11:59pm
---
**Server Location:**Chicago
---
**Loot Method:**We will use a 5 person loot council; 3 are static officers with an additional 2 rotating raiders weekly for transparency and so people have a voice and are involved.
---
**About &lt;Unlucky&gt;:**We aim to enjoy vanilla wow in a casual hardcore way, a chunk of our core comes from pservers and dislike the sweaty egotistical scene. Vanilla is a 15 year old puzzle thats been solved and we feel that if you want to play some meme specs, then you should be able to. We expect our raiders to show up consumed/enchanted/geared and push their buttons in the right order, but won't be enforcing or kicking people out of the guild for making mistakes or missing a raid because real life.

Hi, /u/Saturos47

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cjbn8b/2_weeks_to_character_creation_still_no_word_on/). 
---
You just vendor the low leathers and only Keep the higher ones for later sells.
---
True, here's a more realistic setup  
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F57_ZEzw_GM
---
Yeah money on the vendor will be the same but the AH will be no place for skinning for a long time 😅
---
Start 'em young.
---
It's not a true "set", but the Shadoweave set begins in the late 30's and is fantastic for leveling.
---
play paladin loooooooooooooooooool.
---
for real theres mobs you can grind (beasts) that drop grey items that vendor for a lot.  
---
or, dont buy any loot from the AH and only buy the spells you need and you will never have a problem.  (e.g. only buy rank 1 frost nova as a mage)
---
Risky as fuck too. Imagine you’ve cornered the market on flasks, then slipped into the ZG (1.7) patch notes is “Black Lotus is no longer soulbound.” Probably not a factor in classic though, but who knows.
---
Basically anything is worth more than those currencies in free fall. Sand have more value when a loaf of bread cost trillions.
---
Big brain play: roll warlock and get your leveling partner to roll paladin.
---
**Burning Steppes**, i am a big fan of the Second War and Third War lore. And also the fact that is was a troll zone at one point in history.  
---
This zone beeing so rich in "forgotten" lore makes it very dear to me.
---
3 sec cast I actually like it. Mounting feels more something you do for long runs. I wish they did a 30sec casting time on flying mounts, that would have put it more like a traveling tool instead of "my character basically can fly like superman". Or being able to cast flying mounts only when you're close to a flight master, that would have made totally sense.
---
Retail loot is atrocious. Name three items you currentluy have equipped.  
---
Individual pieces of gear are meaningless nowadays. Ilevel is all that matters - since primary stats follow ilvl. No choices or sacrifices to be made. No sacrificing agi or sta for +hit or somesuch.
---
According to most polls I've seen Shamans are basically the second most played class on Horde behind Warriors.
---
You have to remember that on those polls Shamans end up looking really low (~7-8%), but only half the population can pick the class so you have to double the number to get an accurate representation in comparison to their faction. Shaman will be an extremely popular class.
---
That said guilds will still always be looking for more shamans. Totems are crazy.
---
hey mate, you can apply here  [https://discord.gg/dK6JqMx](https://discord.gg/dK6JqMx?fbclid=IwAR2xLdzBUKeDfHk4hp_wdVJhXefmzKrQrkazcSOZoCFCvgkjTM_BMAz15dc)
---
Comic relief
---
Like I asked many times: what is funny about it? do you find prank videos to be funny?
---
its vendor trash, adds up if you kill a lot of beasts
---
I don't think there were any Cloth sets from dungeons until like...Scholo(?) with the ironweave set.
---
&gt; We forgot a SS, but whatever, you're right. 
---
Yeah, we both initially made the msitake of adding stormstrike to the AAs, This makes the ratio even worse, I edited my post. It's 7 more procs than expected even with 100% flurry uptime. So, insanely lucky.
---
&gt; I think here the problem is that pservers have the wrong calculation about crit loss vs bosses. Plus i dunno if his dummy is considered as a boss, even if it's a level 63. 
---
A good testing dummy sohuld be considered a boss. Yes, pservers are off, but only by 2%, 3% crit reuction is there, so we have 27%. He is still more than 10% above the expected value and 75 AAs isn't a small sample size. That's insanely lucky again.
---
&gt; You forgot Strength totem, crusader buff. This is ~200 more strength (with talent for strength totem)
---
Fair enough. Assuming crusader is up for 50% of the stormstrikes (which is generous), we'd get 590-650 dmg per stormstrike. Against 0 armor. That's still way below 1k average. Pretty much at least 4 of his stormstrikes must have crit to achieve that.
---
I forgot about Thandol Span! The statue in booty bay and the doors of uldum in Tanaris really stick out for me
---
Duskwood. Hands down.

    [H] Cerberus - Hardcore PvE Guild - PvP Server - US East () 
---
While wanting to relive  past heroism's at a competitive level, the goal of the guild is to  progress at a pace that suits the core of the guild. With only two days  in our raid week, the core of the guild will be held to high  expectations to maximize the time we spend in raid. These two raid  nights will have minimal downtime and minimal tolerance for repeated  poor performance and coming to raid unprepared. Ideally, we seek to  recruit the top 1% of skilled players who no longer wish to commit to a  4+ night per week raiding schedule.
---
Off  nights are to be spent farming consumes, gold, pre-raid BiS, 20 man’s,  and, of course, doing other things you love/need to do. The last thing  we want is to burn out our core and, with a more intense raiding  schedule, farming consumes, gold, and pre-raid BiS can be very volatile  to the turn over rate of players.
---
Maturity and respect is very important. Drama of any kind will not tolerated.
---
Leaders  of Cerberus have countless hours, accumulating to years, of leadership  experience throughout retail WoW and other games and MMO's.
---
**Raid nights will be:**
---
    Tuesday and Wednesday evenings at 8:00PM - 11:00PM (EST)    
---
    Invites will begin 30 minutes prior to raid to ensure we start AT 8:00PM SHARP! 
---
    Loot Council 
---
**Our Goal:**
---
    To progress at a competitive level, on a casual schedule, in a hardcore and mature raiding environment. 
---
**Requirements:**
---
    18+ years of age (some exceptions apply for mature/outstanding players)    
---
    Minimum of 87.5% raid attendance (~8 raids a month - 1 missed raid per month AT MOST)    
---
    Showing up to raid on time and prepared for encounters being executed that day  (including proper add-ons, consumes, etc)

"HEY BARRENS WHAT'S UP PLEASE FOLLOW ME AT twitch.tv/LeetWarrior PLEASE MAKE ME FAMOUS"
---
Read the whole question...
---
fact
---
I know engineers too, From Marquette University, Georgia Tech, Purdue University, and Kansas State University, and I know your spouting BS.
---
Addon sources?  just noticed that curse client has been bought and integrated into twitch, but a lot of addons people are talking about are missing. 
---
Is there a neat way to download and prepare addons, ideally with also something that auto-updates them when they get patched?
---
This is incorrect, there is no official post stating the exact date.
---
All we know so far is that the list of server names gets released 'before' name reservation happen, whether that means minutes, days or even a full week ahead is unknown.
---
Is /r/classic the new facebook?
---
Unfortunately you would have to be Alliance in that situation, and that's worse than paying the gold for the mount.  Makes me shudder just thinking about it...Ugh.
---
Weren't those added as part of the AQ war effort?
---
It's the intent of the changes, and overall objectives that are different.  
---
If the intent is to smooth and streamline, giving everyone the ability to play whatever and feel like they have the same ability and utility to play, that was what the designers felt was "better."  
---
If you want uniqueness, class identity, and the ability to rise to the challenge, that's what many of the players considered "better."
---
The coastline of Azshara, with special mention to the westfall coastline as well.
---
Oh God that should be reportable lol
---
hopefully we'll get the spamthrottle addon for classic pretty quick.
---
It was an example of how it compares. Rogues are a bad example, because their dps shifts heavily if solo or not. But paladins can certainly keep up in dps with priests, enhancement shamans, solo rogues and solo druids. So, I'd put that as pretty average.
---
My over confident friends who aren't going to give a shit about agro management in 5 mans and will make my life miserable as a tank.
---
well since we dindt get a spanish servers we form a collusion of all the spanish guilds to go to the same server, tested the server host for the best ping overall and we are basing ur desicion on that while avoiding streaming servers ofc
---
A lot of people level with shield + dagger + Flametongue + spellpower/fire gear even once they get Windfury. Not sure if it's actually better than Windfury at that point, or if you can get close to those damage numbers he listed, but just wanted to say there IS a legitimate reason to play shield + 1h. The on-hit with a fast weapon hits really well and consistently, for leveling at least. Maybe there's some end-game application with a specific set of gear or something, but fuck if I know lmao, I've only ever seen Windfury shams
---
Tbh it's not that hard to get mountmoney passively. I've never had problems with not having enough money at lvl 40 from either retail or private servers. Create a bank account and mail all your greens etc to sell on the AH, always pick the more valuable greens from quests and pick up everything to vendor.
---

If you want to be one of the millions of streamers out there and even monetise on it you should be able to do proper research on google.
---
Makes more sense to come here for more specific questions on different softwares for capturing/editing or camera suggestions...
---
I’m fucking vomiting
---
With the crossrealm BGs which were in 1.12, BGs should be popping relatively frequently.
---
Be aware of what transpires outside of your field of vision.
---
but a fun time sink, which is what we are all here for haha
---
But we're not talking about solo, we're talking about with one other. That was the entirety of my first post, I even said that paladins are pretty good solo because their uptime.
---
&gt;priests, enhancement shamans
---
If the priest were shadow, the paladin will get one or two auto attacks off per mob, one will proc every now and then, and then the mob is going to die with the priest having done well over 70% of the damage. Shadow priests simply translate their mana into more damage much quicker than paladins can and they don't even need to oom themselves out to do so.
---
Also why would you change the shaman to the worse leveling spec for that comparison? Obviously SoC is going to carry that comparison until level 40 like with warriors. The shaman should go elemental instead so they can better utilize their mana, just like priests going shadow.
---
Timbermaw repuation farm raids, this is one of the most boring aspects of char progression but sadly needed for anyone interested in doing proper pvp.
---
That's really sad, especially in ARPGs it's all about the theory crafting imo.
---
Having a game where lead devs can't come to a clear conclusions sounds fucking fantastic.
---
(Sure the game still has to be designed correctly and the insecurities should come from all the possible ways to play the game instead of unclear &amp; random effects..)
---
You are correct, I was more making the joke that even though May 15th was the release date, no one was able to log on the first few days, so it was pushed back until the 16th or 17th.
---
I guess I am just repeating what others have written here already. Personally I would skip Renew all together, not needed for dungeons or leveling alone. You can save a few copper, silver and gold along the way until 60. 
---
At level 20 for example I'd have Flash Heal for emergency healing, Lesser Heal Rank 3 for base healing and Heal for large damage on the tank while not being in an emergency situation. 
---
Shield is usually not needed in leveling dungeons as well. Take time away during which you could have cast a Flash Heal if someone is in dire need of HP.
---
Never said that every guild will, but the vast majority won't turn down an edge if they come across it.
---
Rogue is great. I don't particularly care for pvp in this game but even I had fun importing a rogue to test servers and doing some PVP. Plus rogue can be good without any gear.
---
Rogue, you can pick your fights
---
Honestly, it's the current gamer mentality carrying over into classic.  This idea that if you don't minmax, full consume, world buff, max dps, top the meters, world first; then you are trash.
---
I get that a certain amount of elitism existed in vanilla, but I'd much prefer that over what we have today.
---
Blackrock Mountain, specifically the giant chains holding up the rock in the center.
---
You know respecs are available in Vanilla, right?
---
Also, I think most raid leaders would rather have a healer doing about 70% of normal healing and buffing the 5 warlocks you have, instead of a DPS doing 35% of a warlocks/mages DPS.
---
&gt; We figured we had somewhere along the lines of 15-25% dead weight in our raids. More or less they were just soaking up DKP and under performing as their class.
---
Oh yes! Lemme get our old man sticks.
---
**Back in our Days...**
---
we didn't even know DPS numbers (a working recount came months later) so we just had to assume that the mage with 2x unique items did more DPS than the green/blue geared Rookie.
---
A boy were we wrong...once recount got released abd the veil got lifted:
---
Suddenly the all Blue Rogue was at the top, and some Guys who have been with the raid since Day1 and decked in all the shiny Purple were actually Shit-Tier at DPS.
---
You can imagine the Drama that followed...
---
Bench the guys with all the Equip? Who have been there all the time and formed Bonds with half the raid, or lose Progress?
---
Raids got Destroyes by that.
---
I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR CREATING A SPACE WHERE I CAN BE COMFORTABLE SHARING MY ANGST AND INQUIETUDE.
---
I FEEL YOU BROTHER, FINAL SEMESTER OF UNI WILL BE SPENT STUDYING RAID COMPS INSTEAD OF NETWORK SECURITY. SEE YOU IN AZEROTH PLEASE REMIND ME TO GO TO CLASS
---
YOU ARE WELCOME.
---
Yeah, I hate people that join a guild and don't understand the concept of "You get back what you put in". People bitching that nobody in the guild is helping them, or that a piece of gear didn't go to them when they haven't done a single thing for the guild at all.
---
All true given certain variables- a seasoned, consistent group being the top one. A solo player joining pug 5 mans will have a much different experience than a member of a dedicated dungeon group.
---
Because you get that quest in Xroads and it's all the way the fuck down near Camp T. Like a 10-minute run lol

**Who are we?** Here at **Imperium** we believe in **the journey and comradry** that vanilla offers. We share the long-time goal dream of thousands of players that wanted to make retail classic servers a reality! Since we all now have achieved that goal it is time to take the next step! **In our guild we want to encourage the social aspect of the game**, aswell as playing every bit of variety it has to offer. (PvE, PvP, wPvP, Grinding) Of course this doesn't mean that we want especially Grinding and Raiding to be a mind numbing auto-pilot experience. **We like to keep things fun and challenging!** Putting all the above mentioned things together we created Imperium with **a simple vision**: **We want to create a mature raiding and pvp community, we want to endure throughout the whole journey and we want to have the most fun possible while at it!**   
---
**Who are we looking for?** We are looking for a variety of people, no matter the vanilla background you have, no matter the schedule you might have, we want you to be a part of our awesome community, to enhance your and our vanilla experience, together, no matter the time you will be able to spend in the game!   
---
**What are our goals?** We want to clear every vanilla content and acquire all the awesome epic gear that is there. While we are at it we want to have as much **fun** as possible also doing wPvP and PvP so the Alliance will get to fear us! We want to create a strong bond between our members **making the journey an unique experience**!   
---
**What do we expect from you?** We want to create **a mature guild environment**, meaning you should at least be 20 years or older. **You do not need to have played vanilla to qualify for joining us! :-)**  If you are new to the class you will be playing on retail classic that is totally fine. It would be awesome though if you are **willing to improve on your class**, this can of course be done in conjunction with your respected **class-leader, who will be able to guide you**.   **Participation** on our scheduled raids and if you so wish, PvP and especially wPvP activities.

&gt;I'm honestly getting anxious about the last stress test due to [...] 
---
Do you whiny people ever listen to yourselves? My God, how do you babies function in every day Life?
---
Yeah that's basically what I'm trying to decide between.
---
Warlocks have the scaling, the cool gear, a huge toolbox of fun stuff to mess around with, some cool specs to choose from.
---
Mages are good from the get go, scales well, has the QoL and ease of farming etc.
---
I think my absolute favorite would be something between TBC and Vanilla design.  In TBC, you still had some random stuff, but I think the combat rating system was very helpful in making it so that level 20 gloves weren't close to pre-raid BIS at level 60 (which means once you get those gloves, no upgrades while you level matter).
---
By WotLK, everything was too formulaic.

&lt;Charlie Sheen Gave Me HIV&gt; [H] | NA-PVP | semi-hardcore
---
Hello! We are mainly a group of coworkers looking to get a solid core going into vanilla. I have led guilds before (mainly during Cata) and played as a tank during vanilla/BC. We have open recruiting for all roles at the moment, though I will say main tank is solid. 
---
We all work professional jobs, so at the moment the raid schedule is looking like 2 days a week sometime fri evening and sat or sunday early day to evening. 
---
We plan to have fun, clear raids, and just be a good community to enjoy the game we're all either coming back to or are excited to try out for the first time after joining in later xpacs. If you're interested send me a PM and we can discuss!
---
No they say "ON the ground"
---
This is a bit of a tangent, but god I hate the term "meme spec".
---
It implies people only play it to troll, or that they're somehow inconsiderate.
---
I'm not going shaman but if I did I'd be playing enhance because that's what would be fun. Especially for PvP. I know everyone on reddit thinks of themselves as a hardcore min/max PvE legend who will be clearing Naxx, but the reality is most people likely won't raid much beyond MC.
---
This (inadvertently) happened to me in TBC. Had a guild going through SSC and BT, and though I was on the raid roster, was never given gear.  
---
I went to the loot tables, tracked down what would be good gear for a sword spec rogue outside of the raids, and ground those pieces out. Whenever I was put in raid against those rogues that have regular slots, I'd constantly be #2 pushing #1 on damage among the rogues.  
---
Understanding and balancing of stats was more important than just simply taking raid gear.
---
1) a guildmate died during my wow years, so I know how they could feel  
---
2) I wouldn't do a virtual "funeral" for my dear friends' characters, I would attend their funeral :)  
---
3) I would totally have done the same thing as pictured in the video if I had the opportunity back in 2006. Awful but fun. Now, probably not. But 23 y old me? fuck yeah.
---
I'm probably going to turn chat off for the first 20 levels or so, honestly.
---
As many others say, it sounds like rogue is just up your alley.

You know, I definitely didn't come here to say Shimmering Flats, but now you've got me thinking about it. The absolute emptiness of it...the flat, dry, kind of grindy area that I always thought of as miserable.
---
It is sort of perfect atmosphere for the level. You are midway through the leveling process, likely don't have your mount yet, and are sort of just in nose-to-the-grindstone mode. It's slogged out and every level is hard fought. Its awful, and I'm suddenly really excited to go through it again.
---
Hunters want the main hand but the dagger from hakar in offhand not both warblades.
---
Horde did it just fine without Fear Ward. Its not mandatory, just something that makes it a bit easier.
---
yeesh. time to avoid this sub for a few weeks.

VICTORY OR DEATH BROTHER
---
Getting consumables for raids... Flasks, eko's, food... I could join a more casual guild, but that's just not me.
---
Depends what you like.
---
I dont like roaming around the world looking for herbs. Buying them for crafting isn't much profitable.
---
Lw/skin is nice. I like the dragonscale with 15% mana regen in combat. Most will tell you to "just" farm the bis in dungeon because it is better +healing. But hours of farming to get a few clothies bis is boring. The dragonscale set is a sure thing.
---
The Clippy inclusion is absolutely perfect. This is proper art
---
I will level a Priest first and that will take most of my time, especially in the beginning. From the experiences on private servers I do want a second character though for farming / having something to do on the long run. 
---
But with leveling, gearing, grinding gold and consumables the first character will see the bulk of my playtime.
---
Abuse the crap out of the 5 second rule.  Don't heal the tank when he's at nearly full health.  Let him dip to a comfortable level, and then spam heals until he's topped, and then renew.  That renew will not affect your 5SR (since it happened at the same time as your last Heal cast), but will keep the tank topped off while you regen your mana.
---
Depending on how well you know the tank or dungeon, that comfortable level may be around 40%, or it may be around 20%.
---
*Cries in female Tauren Druid*
---
Not sure what your definition of common is. Doing "/who vegan" on L********e I've not seen all that many others sporting it. And usually they had it at the end of their names, not the beginning.
---
Maybe you ran into my various alts all the time! :D
---
Who names their kid Razor Naga?
---
NPC by dungeon entrance: Did jerry send you?
---
Player: Yup he said something about a reward.
---
NPC: Yup got them right here.
---
Player hands in quest.
---
NPC: Now that that's been taken care of can I get you to enter into this dungeon again and loot a tiny object off a mob that's completely off the regular route and return in back the the dwarf from the original quest?
---
This isn’t a private server subreddit, try asking on r/wowservers instead.
---
Someone did a extensive post on here recently who was in beta an did various tests using like 5 different spec computers.
---
Basically even a 10 year old computer can run it decent 1080p as long as you're not running all sorts in the background.
---
Itemization sucked the second I stopped knowing the names of items I had equipped.
---
Sounds like you're gonna get wrecked no matter what you go.
---
Thanks daddy
---
Which=objects and ideas, who=living things. “My GF (who will play with me)”...etc.

Otherwise the rest of your English is perfect. Have fun with classic!

&lt;Moderna Misstag&gt; [EU-PVP] Swedish Semi-Hardcore Raiding
---
About Us
---
We are a group of friends that have been playing WoW since Vanilla Beta and day 1 on the EU launch back in 2005 and now we turn all of our attention towards WoW Classic and we want you to join us! 
---
We want to establish a Swedish speaking guild that will be highly respected on our server and have a great community who realise that real life responsibilities comes first and gaming comes second but who still want to have a great time playing WoW Classic. We offer a mature and relaxed raiding environment where everyone feels welcome. 
---
First and foremost we want to enjoy our time spent playing the game and if we ensure that we and all of our raiders have a great time playing together then raid progression will follow. Besides having fun the goal will always be to clear all raid content at a steady and reliable pace.
---
Raid Times
---
Wed/Sun: 19:30-22:30 CET
---
We plan on raiding twice a week for the initial phases and then likely add a third raid day as we progress into the later phases and additional raids are added.
---
Loot System
---
A DKP system will be used, exactly what version of decay/closed/open bid etc is not determined yet. Certain items will be separate from the DKP system, such as gearing up tanks but everything will be done with transparency and fairness in mind.
---
Expectations
---
Attitude, Attendance, Performance
---
To us player attitude and behaviour is the most important aspect of being a good guild member, both in dealing with other guild members but also with the rest of the servers community. Poor behaviour on your part will not only tarnish your own reputation but also the guilds reputation and we will not tolerate that. That being said as long as you treat people with a nice and respectable attitude we will not have a problem. 
---
Besides having a good attitude we want you to have as good of a raid attendance as you can manage, but it is our job as a community to provide you with an enjoyable experience so that you want to log in and attend raids and perform to the best of your ability. It does not matter if you have previous raiding experience or if you are completely new to the game as long as you are a team player with the mindset that the guild itself will always be more important than any individual member.
---
Please contact us for more information:

this man speaks the truth. if you're low on gold around lvl 37-38, just grind high value mobs and make a few gold an hour. but do not pass up bis twink stuff if you see it for low prices!
---
The run backs to Twin Emps and C'Thun give me nightmares.

---
W/EPL questlines are *so. damn. good.* Everyone reading this who cares even a little bit about lore should do themselves a favor and get really immersed in the quests there. Take the time to read them, understand what you're doing and why. There are several epic length quest chains in those zones; take the time to savor them.
---
My strategy is to be a paladin.
---
**Guild** : Ascension  
---
**Raid Times :** Tue/Thu 7-1030pm Central (Sundays on an as needed basis)  
---
**Loot System :** DKP Hybrid (you wont find a better system anywhere). More details in discord
---
**About us :** I was the GM / Raid lead of my guild during vanilla. We were the top guild on our server or vying for it throughout all of vanilla. I got talked into building the guild for Classic. I went PI mode and found 15-20 guildies from back then. We have a very strong core group. We plan to clear the raids in a day (might take a couple days the first week or so). The rest of our time will be spent stomping out horde and farming for raids. I don't like long winded posts. We are pretty much full on all classes. Im not a fan of long winded recruiting posts.
---
**Playstyle :** We arent going to no life the game. Been there done that. We will get shit done though. We will progress. We will progress at a decent clip. We arent "lololol hardcore" though. Vanilla/Classic isn't rocket science. We aren't requiring everyone to go engineering or be 60 in 3 days (i know, shush), but our priests wont be skinning/mining or anything like that.
---
**Currently Needs:**
---
We are sitting around 36-40 players right now. We don't over recruit. The most we will have is about 55
---
* Druids : 1-2
---
* Hunter : 2-3
---
* Paladin : 1 Retadin (yes we need 1 very active meme pally)
---
* Priest : 1-2 Shadow (will heal til they have gear enough to go shadow)
---
* Warlocks : 2-3
---
* Warrior : 2-3 (FURY ONLY)
---
Please join discord and DM me ( BDJosh#7103) if interested. When you join, DM me for access to the WoW channels.
---
Dead character. Much more of that to come :p
---
I'm right there with you! Only had three days off this year so far and I've got several deadlines looming before launch, but the only date that I can keep on my mind is August 27th. 
---
What's that? Have I booked a room for my work trip next month? How about the one for this week? Nope. Shit....
---
30 second cast time on flying mounts isn't a bad idea, I always like the one where you can only mount a flying mount when you are near a flight master.
---
Hello, I'm looking for an A/H guild that raids on Sat/Sun PM. I plan on playing a healing spec but honestly could be swayed to play anything if the guild has weekend progression. So, please PM me with inquiries.
---
What player agency? 
---
There's really not much choice when it comes to gearing even in vanilla, because there's always going to be a bis list.
---
In fact, you often have less choice, because itemization is so bad for some specs they aren't even close to viable, and only become somewhat viable until aq40
---
There's going to be even less choice in classic, because we now know what is good and what isn't
---
Let's talk.  I'm looking for a warlock buddy to duo level with.  Easily the best leveling duo.
---
Holybfuck what a dick move by the content creators lol
---
https://youtu.be/qeN-CzudUgU
---
/r/buildapc
---
All your various alts in all different kinds of games I've played in the past decade?
---
It's a no lol
---
Layering shouldn't work like sharding (in most circumstances, we've seen some issues in the beta).
---
Basically you have a Realm A with 50,000 players total that can only support 5000 players layer. Realm A opens up and fill Layer A with 5000 people, once Layer A is full it opens up Layer B and fills that to 5000 people, etc etc.
---
Layer/Shard hopping issues still exist though.
---
When you log in on launch you'll see (likely, unless you're the 1% of players in that last half-full layer) hundreds and hundreds of other players trying to do the starting area with you, it won't be a ghost town like sharding/warmode is in retail.
---
Basically 1 Layer is 1 full server of people (across 1 full continent), not phasing/in out random sport in the map/right in front of you.
---
We Facebook now
---
You can download classic now on the client but I’m sure it will be patched before launch.
---

Be a paladin 👍

**&lt;Nemesis&gt;** Horde - NA – PvP – Semi-Hardcore w/ Loot Council
---
Raid Times: Monday, Wednesday at 8pm CST. 
---
**&lt;Nemesis&gt;** is a brand new guild created by long term players who raided into Naxx when Vanilla was live. Lately we’ve been on private servers. We are older now and realize that life sometimes gets in the way of this game we love so much. We can’t play at all times like we used to so we need to make the most of it. What makes Vanilla WoW so special is the journey and the community you enjoy it with. We are building a family and we hope you consider joining us if you’d like to be a part of our team.
---
**&lt;Nemesis&gt;** will be focused on competing with three day guilds while maintaining a two day weekly raid schedule. We are taking a few days off for the initial push to 60. We are currently planning to do Ony/MC exactly one month after launch. We will make the most of our raid times and expect all of our members to be prepared and consistent. We may not exactly be a server first competitive guild for phase 1, but we plan to clear all other phases within the first lockout they are released. As we evolve we will rival most hardcore guilds through later phases while keeping our raid days to a minimum.
---
**&lt;Nemesis&gt;** is recruiting both extremely experienced and newer players who are willing to grow and develop with our team. All members are expected to handle coaching well, and be patient with loot. It comes so slowly in vanilla but it will come. Every person in the raid team will be expected to come with consumables and flasks for progression. We also anticipate having some newer players in the guild so we need patient members who are willing to help guide and assist our newbies.
---
On our off nights we plan to do 20 man raids or PvP. We love both organized battleground teams and world PvP.
---
If you’re interested in joining our team please contact us on discord for more information.
---
Kasualty#3759, Spartda#7299, Stolas#6827
---
I used to subscribe to that logic until I realized that more often then not the group never made it to SM since the place was littered with Horde and that a group lacking a healer was just going to get killed a hundred times before even having a chance to summon.
---
Plus as a paladin and my unforunate need to do SFK I was usually one of the only people in the group that had a flight point to Hillsbrad already.
---
Fair point!
---
I don't even know, 'll look at shaman first.
---
Every time.
---
2. Genuine answer to your question, I know two hunter players that like the gimmick.
---
FUCK HUNTERS
---
I'd rather have a fear break than a lame root break.
---
So is Classic going to be flooded with Venezuelan gold farmers?
---
I'm sorry you are humorless
---
Economic collapse created by Muirica spreading "freedom".
---
Basically keep your head straight
---
But once Classic is available to buy and play from Blizzard, won't it technically also be retail?
---
I would go 2/2 Healing Focus and 3/3 Imp Healing so you are more efficient and useful in dungeons / raids. There is not too much farming where you will need to kill imo, unless you want to grind gold heavily alone for which you should go Shadow anyway I think.
---
What professions do you plan on? If you go Herb / Alch the only killing will be a mob here and there to get to a herb (where Fear will also work) or to farm a specific recipe. 
---
The only thing where being able to farm properly matters is to get Runes, unless you run a lot of dungeons and get the one that drops on dungeons which you could theoretically also purchase from the AH. For the BoP Demonic Rune in Felwood it makes more sense to team up with a guild mate.
---
Very likely every single one of them, considering they are experiencing the death of at least a million people.
---
I'm going to make a female troll and dance on top of the Orgrimmar bank
---
Have they said 5000 is the layer limit they're going with? Nost felt really good to me population wise with 10k.
---
what i really hate is that there aren't any items with 2h axes and 2h maces weapon skill thus making enhancement shamans incredibly bad since they cant itemize against glancing blows
---
So interesting to hear all these responses. I seem to remember "100 FR!!" being considered mandatory to be a part of our raid Ragnaros attempts. I'm not even saying you guys are wrong.. way more likely it was my guild / raid leader with no idea what he was talking about. But when we killed Raggy, you bet your ass all 40 of us were wearing the stupidest imaginable gear to get that 100 FR.
---
R/thisguyfucks
---
I never took the black PvP mounts.  Don't get me wrong I thought they all looked great but I loved the White armored Kodo and nothing in the game was keeping me from my beast of choice, not even Baron Rivendare's mount could sway me.  (Though that was more because male trolls looked janky as hell on horse's.)
---
Buy it from the chinese
---
What issues were for hunter on the beta? I was so excited to play hunter and then posts like these happen :/
---
r/classicwow is turning in to r/wow by the day...
---
Just don't die
---
real fury warrior use 2h, pleb
---
Lake Everstill in Redridge. So many memories from hunting murlocs to diving for the necklace to diving into it in order to escape from the elite orcs. I nearly shit myself the first time 12 year old me saw the ?? elite lake monster
---
I never understood this
---
Honestly it is far worse on ally side with ret pallies and Esfand. So idc let em go enhance and be useless to their faction :)
---
I think I'm probably going to take skinning and herbalism at the start, and eventually go herb/alch. Skinning is basically a little free extra money from a vendor whenever you kill a beast, and that adds up over time
---
Or just asmongold
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVMRsZbxxccrVxx](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVMRsZbxxccrVxx) ?
---
The main thing is dropping 5% spell damage and 5% spell crit (force of will). I also feel like the 10% increases mana from Mental Strength makes up for lacking Spirit Tap.
---
Of course, your build would have a lot higher healing with Spiritual Healing, and I suppose Spiritual Guidance can kind of make up for lack of Force of Will, while adding even more healing.
---
I thought it's was pretty awful until he gave the eulogy  at the very end stating that she (the deceased) liked fishing and PvP. That was really funny. 
---
In a way they did contribute to the whole general idea of the event.
---
Girls are like unicorns (at least, on EU servers) in my personal experience. I've only ever been in 1 guild that had more than one, and I'd say more than half of the time when I meet one they are playing with their partner. I guess a lot never reveal their gender though to avoid weirdo attention. I'd probably do the same if I were playing a game with 90% female players, no one likes to be a minority even if the community is benign.
---
I like to consider myself 'not a weirdo' but even I initially react like "OH WOW A MEMBER OF THE OPPOSITE SEX. ON HERE. WHAT ARE THE CHANCES" whenever I play with a woman. Its just statistically unexpected lol.
---
Congrats!
---
Solo Priest healer is pointless. Healing is all about group playing.
---
Small price to pay for a proper education.
---
If you like duels and arena, rogue it is.  Good at smaller pvp engagements, not as good at large scale engagements like bgs.
---
lets not go political now
---
Bullshit.
---
thats not really the case though, the meta is ever evolving. wow on the other hand ..
---
Copy pasted gear that's shoved down your throat at every turn for everybody. It's the culmination of all the bad systems they've implemented over the years. Truly, a lot of their problems in the game stem from the loot and loot systems; they'd be so much better off if they still had a sense of character progression with loot, where loot is unique and upgrades are easily seen, but instead they just seem to want to continue down this lootsplosion road where nobody knows what's good and people get tons of gear for doing nothing.
---
There was a video of a former WoW dev at a conference explaining loot systems or something of the like, and he basically said that their loot design has become a monster that they don't even understand anymore.
---
Well Classic isn’t using the same version of the game as it was back then, which is why I asked if it has been updated.
---
Looking for a semi hardcore progression guild. I've been playing for 15 years on and off. Nowadays I Heroic Raid and dabble in some Mythic but have since quit retail.
---
Played Mage/warlock on and off for about 12 years with predominantly Mage as my main. I have not decided which class as my first, but it will be one of the two.
---
I will be playing Alliance NA and on a PvE server. I am looking for a guild with raid times EST 2 days a week in the evening (Tuesday and Thursdays preferable). I am open to having a third if we need it but it would need to be a weekday. I cannot commit to weekends as I have other responsibilities as an adult, however I'm sure there will be times that I can play on the weekend. 
---
What I'd be looking for as far as the guild values is like minded players who are adults and understand that our time is valuable and to progress through content as quickly as we can without sacrificing our sanity and real life responsibilities. I'm all for having a good time and helping the guild however I can, but when raid time comes around I believe it's important to not waste anyones time. I hope to be raid ready by mid to late October. 
---

Not really.
---
I mean sure, an experienced group will definitely go faster, but classic dungeons are so faceroll pretty much any braindead group will whiz right through it.
---
Did that and only made like 40g.
---
Shock humor is still humor. I don't know what is funny but first I cringed, then my mouth was wide open, then I laughed. 
---
Im not *proud* that I find it funny, but that doesnt change the fact of the matter.
---
&gt;I imagines this build as sword and shield, dont mind missing one extra attack in 1v1, my damage would come from on hit effects, reckoning auras etc. They will kill themselves
---
I guess sarcasm is an lost artforum.

And to answer the question I think he was asking: They were not roleplaying,  it was a real memorial.

# &lt;Regicide&gt; | Alliance |PvP | Semi-Hardcore
---
Regicide is a semi hardcore guild born out of a love for the game as it was. A group of people in love with the world and community that was created by Blizzard back in ‘04. We seek to be among some of the higher guilds on the server through raiding and in our world pvp. We are seeking raiders as well as some officer positions available. Socials are welcome, whether it be to be part of a community or you just need some help every once and a while with quests. Come join us!
---
Expectations: We expect that raiders keep up with the pack when it comes to early leveling and reach level 60 within a week or two of the first 60’s. You will get out of this guild and experience as much as you put in. If you want to be near the top then you are expected to help with prep as well as basic help around the guild.
---
The ONLY set in stone rule: Don’t be a dick. Respect one another, and speak with officers if issues arise. The last thing we need is turmoil that is hidden from everyone just to explode at random.
---
Raid Schedule: Tuesday / Wednesday / Thursday 6 - 9 PST, 7 - 10 MST, 8 - 11 CST, 9 - 12 EST.
---
RAID POSITIONS ARE NOT GUARANTEED
---
Recruiting:
---
Druid: Open (Healer)
---
Hunter: Open
---
Mage: Open
---
Paladin: Open (Healer)
---
Priest: Open (Healer)
---
Rogue: Open
---
Warlock: Open
---
Warrior: Open

Do some research (or better yet get an addon that tells you recent AH prices on item tooltip) and only mail stuff to your alt that will net you more profit than the 30c (I think that's the postage for items?) it takes to mail it.
---
It was pretty rough at start of beta, most of it got fixed by end of beta. The pet still wasn’t feeling totally responsive like it should be. Im sure it will be fine.
---
mine was Dwarvenizer/Trollizer. Loved that addon.
---
It's +30%, I think, but they get it at level 20, so you'll be playing catchup as a warlock for 20 levels if you duo with a druid. Shaman/druid is better if you are trying to match speeds because of ghost wolf.
---
Leeway
---
Hey, thanks for the suggestion! Someone else had mentioned something along these lines for trinkets since hunters can feign death swap and run a bunch of them. I'll give it some more thought.
---
You won't be dying in classic dungeons and those dungeons are probably going to be the best gold while leveling.
---
Is this why hunters always went with Engineering professions?  For the Gnomish Prostabrator?
---
God damn it, that video had me transfixed, but I'm at work and can't just stare at it :(
---
Just got a huge nostalgia bomb there. I told myself I wasn't gonna plan too much, but now I may have to plan out/contort my leveling route to make sure I hit all the zones I want to see again ASAP on my main.
---

From the movie Donnie Darko.

Buy Intel.
---
Yes, we all are very aware of when the release date is.
---
Resistances won't matter that much for most players. tanks might want it, that's about it. Min-maxing in general won't be important at all. In the past most of raiding difficulties came from the fact 30% of the raid group was carrying the other 70%T
---
the truth is classic raiding is very simple. Most of the difficulty back in the day came from factors that are no longer an issue. those factors were.
---
1. bad pc
---
2. bad internet
---
3. little experience with gaming, majority of players raided as clickers and mouse turners. it didnt' stop them from killing stuff.
---
By comparison these three things are virtually non existent now in gaming. Especially when it comes to running a game like classic wow. And people know more about the game than ever.
---
Aren't you a little old to be role-playing monsters?
---
A bunch of crybabies that tought they were good players because they were playing with overpowered Lupos pets and with non-DR-sharing CCs in private servers.
---
I'm rolling hunters and I never hated pservers/pservers players but honestly the hunter discord server is making me hate those people. The ammount of QQ there is really unbearable.

Looking for a semi-hardcore Horde guild that raids between 8pm-12am on weekdays with an all day availability on weekends (PST) or (MST) (Arizona boi)
---
Planning on playing a Hunter and will wanting to mostly do PvP content, but wanting to also fill up that extra raid slot if possible. My goal is to be the opposite of a huntard, so i have faith in my abilities to utilize the class the best i can. 
---
Been playing WoW since WotLK, never played a Hunter in Classic besides pservers.
---
How about I just buy you a beer?
---
Not really.  Barely more than vendor for, and when they don't sell you lose a huge deposit.

&gt; I was hoping to be able to get a full launch-day experience prior to actual release as a EU player so I can actually plan my in-game schedule for 27th - I took my vacation days to align with WoW Classic's global release so I can try to get ahead of the pack in the first week.
---
Their silence is strange for sure, but they have two full work weeks before that lockout. I'm pretty confident we'll hear something this week.

Clicking the sign in pane takes me to a login prompt but there is no way to register.

THESE ARE THE SAME FUCKING "PEOPLE" WHO SAY VANILLA RAIDING IS SO EASY AND TRIVIAL BUT YOU CAN ONLY PLAY IT MIN MAXED BECAUSE AS SOON AS YOU WOULD LIKE TO ENJOY A PROT PALADIN, YOU CAN'T BECAUSE THE CONTENT IS TOO HARD IT WON'T FIT IN THE RAID! LIKE COME ON YOU FUCKING IDIOTS, MAKE YOUR MIND UP!
---
Is it worth disenchanting low to middle level greens, rather than vendoring them? Do even low level enchanting mats typically sell well?
---
 It's basically just keep yer feet on the ground
---
I am pretty sure you can disregard beta values since the economy there was quite different. Unless most of what you made came from straight vendoring of items.
---
Without a doubt Tanaris, this is my favorite zone from vanilla. I have no idea why i loved it so much but i think it was because i had so much fun ganking in the open world outside around the pirates and other parts of the zone.

**&lt;Life Uhhhh Gets In The Way&gt;  NA // PVP // ALIANCE // Casual Raiding**
---
Raid times:  **Alternating Tuesday and Monday nights @ 6:30 PDT**   (To be clear – this means **ONE** night per week) 
---
The main thing to note about &lt;Life Uhhhh Gets In The Way&gt; is the raid schedule.  The initial group is comprised of people that played classic together many moons ago, most of whom are too old to play like we used to, but are also powerless against pull of nostalgia.  As such, in order to keep our wives happy we'll be raiding one night per week.  To begin with we will alternate between Tuesday to Monday nights.  This way we can run the same raid timer twice without playing twice per week.    
---
Because of the limited frequency of our raids I expect us to run MC/Ony exclusively for longer than your average multi-night raiding guild.  A subset of the guild is welcome to start attempting new content as it releases, but my primary concern is getting MC on farm.  Once we come to a consensus that MC has little left to offer, we will shift to BWL, and so on.  Members will obviously be free to pursue other raid timers during the weeks where we return to a raid on Monday before the reset.  Once Molten Core can be completed in one night (which I don't expect to take terribly long) we will raid every Tuesday instead, using each reset. 
---
DKP for the loot system.  Pretty basic, blind bid, 10% decay every week, the details are in our Discord. 
---
The tentative date of our first Onyxia, and hopefully subsequent Molten Core attempt, is before the end of October.  I realize that giving only six weeks or so to level is counter to the whole casual appeal of this guild, if a member needs more time than that it's not a problem.  Many of us, myself included, are going to attack leveling with an unhealthy zeal that will only be able to last so long before divorce becomes imminent.  Our first run may include a few level 58 healers, it may include a few PUGs, these things should not be a source of stress.  We are not going for any records, the most important thing to start with is to get in there and start teaching the fights.   
---
One note on the casual nature of this guild: it doesn't mean I'm looking for lazy raiders.  We are casual due to frequency, that doesn't mean you don't have to know your class / at least make an effort on consumables.  Molten Core is not particularly difficult, but I would like to get to Ragnaros as quickly as possible.  In order to do this we will need to remain focused during the raids.  That said, the core group is pretty easy going. 
---
On that same note, I would like to run this with as close to 40 active raiders as possible.  Seeing as we'll only be raiding once per week – my hope is that the majority of members will be at every raid.  Life is never so straight forward, so I will be recruiting some alternates, but for the most part I'd like to keep the roster tight. 
---
We're all very excited, this should be a lot of fun.  Here's hoping some of you join us in the Molten Core and beyond. 
---
PM me if you're interested.    Our Discord is now live, I'll send you an invite when you contact me. 
---
Right now we can still take any class.  If you're unsure of your class let me know what you're considering.  I am pretty close to full on Druids, Priests, and Tanks, so if that's what you're considering – best to hurry and apply.  If you need help deciding, I am a fountain of classic knowledge. 
---
Thanks for reading!  See you in Azeroth.
---
IMO you should go skinning engineering and then drop skinning for engineering once you have a wand or later. You'll have an extra 20s or so to put towards the wand by the time you've turned in the Meats to Orgrimmar or equivalent quest, and wouldn't have crafted anything meaningful with engineering in the meantime.

US, PST, Horde, PVP - Semi-Hardcore
---
Hello!
---
Been playing on and off since release. Was a healer / raid / guild leader from vanilla to MoP. Plan is to roll an UD Warlock with a Priest as my first alt. Looking forward to 20 &amp; 40 man raiding, World / BG PvP, gearing up, and leveling together.
---
Don't plan on speedleveling to 60, but I do plan on doing it as quickly as I can. Would love to find a guild that has members who plan on grouping for the zerg at the start and maybe later for instances. Can't really dedicate 10 hours a day to a speedleveling group, but would love to be able to run instances with the same bunch of people.

He means to say that you take the green/blue quest rewards that vendor for more money (e.g. a two-handed wep sells for way more than a 1-handed wep).

I don't play video games so I can pay money not to play the game.

Did you use PS just to select the colors and invert? Tried tracing it in Illustrator and it was a failure.
---
I didn’t use the AH at all. Mailed herbs to a bank alt and censored skinned leather.
---
I think you are underestimating the number of clueless players and folks who seem to have a million little things to do before they finally meet you at the dungeon. It was never a question of difficulty.

I'm playing Pathfinder Kingmaker right now, and the wiki is far from complete. It's been a lot of fun figuring stuff out, although there are definitely also cases of reading spoilers later and being like "my choices are going to have an impact down the line?"

---
&gt; you're not getting crit in pve from enviromental / periodic aura damage, such as on vael 
---
In a raid environment sure, but you'll be taking plenty of melee's from 55+ mobs out in the open world if you plan on using this build for what it's meant for. Like I said, you could go  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVMrsVVqobxxcMb](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVMrsVVqobxxcMb) and drop Holy Nova.
---
&gt; 1 point in blessed recovery is often used as purge protection for your real buffs
---
Ok, that makes sense.
---
&gt; Deep healing specs do not struggle with killing, they struggle with kilspeed 
---
Yeah, the point is more like "I plan on killing these mobs asap, and moving on". I also suspect a wand spec hybrid build like shown above would have less down-time than a full pve healing spec, when solo'ing mobs out in the open world.
---
&gt;  Also,you only get 5% more spellcrit *and spell damage* over healing builds from Force of Will. 
---
FTFY. 5% crit AND damage is quite a bit. Ofc, you lose Spritual Guidance and Spiritual Healing as trade off. But for a Hybrid spec it's worth I think. 
---
You won't be topping the meters here, but for MC/Ony and perhaps even BWL (though by then I will have a 60 alt for farming anyway I'm sure), I'm sure this provides more than enough. If you're wiping in raids, it won't be because a priest is missing Spiritual Healing. Obviously by the time you're hitting AQ you'd have respec'd full healing.
---
The first time I ever stepped foot in Azeroth was with a dwarf hunter. I've since become a horde boi, but Dun Morogh will *always* have a special place in my heart for that, I love the snow and the cozy feeling og the dwarf buildings, especially the inns. And IF blew my mind.
---
Fair enough. Being a Hunter for most people hardly means spamming Wingclip in melee range and dealing less damage than a Shadowweaving Priest
---

hey remember on elysium/lightshope when you were the GM of the worst guild on the server &lt;Immortal Lords&gt; ,who could barely keep a 20 man roster, and pugged the rest and never progressed. You tried to make your own premades but you were so bad no one joined them. Then you afk'd BGs for like a year and got R14....pepperidge farm remembers.

Of course man, I will. You planning on PvE or PvP?

Well then it's what I'm saying: it's the equivalent of 'prank videos' nothing funny but the shock of seeing people annoying other people for fun.
---
&lt;No Plan Required&gt; is an EU PVP ALLIANCE guild that intends to aim high in Classic. If you're looking for a relaxed raiding environment with a pinch of competition involved, or a social enclave to hide from your severe depression, then you've hit the jackpot.
---
What to expect
---
The main idea of the guild is to create a community where casual players and hardcore players can co-exist and succeed - but the utmost importance is that we all have fun doing it, and we do it properly. We hope to establish an atmosphere where the raiders will not miss out on the end-game experience and have the opportunity to show their capabilities. Although we hold heavy emphasis on PvE content, PvP will not be absent from the guild's many activities. As for our activities, our members are not expected to, but are encouraged to join us as we embark on many open world journeys!

Depends on your friends. I've never seen an issue with it, all my friends will be rolling the same server even if we aren't in the same guild.
---
Hahaha, why not?
---
At some point after the announcement of classic, a dev said that the hunter class would require the most amount of work. Interestingly, the hunter class was the final class added to the original beta in 2004, indicating that it requires more effort on the devs part than the other classes.
---
On my multiple p servers buffs didn’t go to an Ally if self cast was activated. Don’t know if they got it wrong... even with adds s it didn’t work.
---
The she's will be equally bad.
---
yeah and dont foget cooldowns with Execute, thats where warriors do their damage.
---
Hunters look weak, because they don't benefit nearly as much from the world buffs.  That will be fixed in classic.
---
In 2005 my guild required every raid member (even ranged DPS) to have 100 FR to enter Molten Core once we were on Rag progression. 
---
In today's game, you spend 4 gold for 2 Greater Fire Protection Potions and call it a day. No FR needed.
---
Do you have push notifications on for my comments so you can come and try to start something? I’m flattered, but not interested.
---
Everyone calm down and play what you want to play.
---
depends on your rage. if you lose rage -&gt; dont use them
---
The point is, if a green will sell for more on the AH than it will to a vendor, you mail it to a bank alt who lists it on the AH with out you having to return to a city on your main.
---
Well the Mana Cost was never an issue because everyone used Inner Focus before they cast it.
---
Fully regenerating the mana back is exactly what I'm talking about. Druids/Priests get spirit regen on top of mp5 and when you factor in buffs and consumables you rack up quite a lot of regen.
---
Vanilla is very much NOT casual friendly.
---
I'm in the same guild with him. He's likely to get HoR first.
---
As already linked in the [beta test benchmarks](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cgwjuv/i_benchmarked_the_classic_beta_to_help_you_assess/) you don't need anything crazy to run.  
---
The question is, what's your budget?  Do you already have a monitor/keyboard/mouse?  Is this really the only thing you want to play?
---
I would say the biggest things that you should look for
---
* SSD for faster load times
---
* Dedicated GPU (although a Ryzen with integrated APU is pretty good option)
---
* 8 GB ram minimum
---
I'd go for [something like this](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/mFjtcY) or [this](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/Hx8nWD) if you want a little more oomf.  This can get you going pretty well for $500 range and that includes a $100 copy of Windows 10.  The 570 will be a SIGNIFICANT boost in performance if you ever want to do more gaming.  You could also throw something like a 1660ti in there for a hundred bucks more. 
---
* You can definitely save some money, go to some site like Kinguin and get a $30 grey market windows key, 
---
* You can cut your 660p SSD to 512 for a bout 30 bucks less (but I would suggest having the 1TB since you don't have a supplimental platter HDD.  To get a 512 SSD + 2TB HDD ended up being the same price to just get 1TB SSD, why I went with it. 
---
* You can save a few bucks on slower RAM, but Ryzen chips like higher RAM speeds.  It's really not worth it IMO.  You could also got for 2x8GB sticks, as your APU will share RAM with your system.  I would suggest it if you were doing other gaming, but for WoW: Classic, you won't need it.
---
* You can cut to a lower power supply in the 450w range, but I put in the 600w in case you want to put in a GPU later, you won't need to buy a new PSU potentially.  But if you're not planning to upgrade, can just drop the PSU. 
---
All in all, you can have a system for just over $400 if you look into cutting corners mentioned above, already have a monitor/mouse/keyboard.  Should play WoW: Classic more than fine.  The base/cheap system does give you good upgrade path to just add a GPU and you're golden.
---
Any good raid has plenty of restos that can totem twist. Enhance is a wasted  raid slot.
---
You can do PvP, you might get your ass handed to you more than usual but wouldn't bet on raiding as guilds progress there is no real catch up mechanic so a guild would need to run you through older content to hear you up and if you are a casual then it is a non starter
---
So I shouldnt worry and roll a hunter? I mainly like to duel
---
Happy cake day!
---
Orcs are the original warlocks.  Everyone else is a copycat :)
---
 [https://pcpartpicker.com/list/bWFzzY](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/bWFzzY) 
---
There's a lot you could cut back on as well, but this would provide you with a pretty solid foundation to upgrade on later if you wanted.
---
I did no investigating on an optimal case, but have had great results from the corsair carbide series myself. The same goes for monitors. I'm a PC gamer and have 2x 1440p 144hz monitors. What's selected is something cheaper (1080p 144hz).
---
You could look into getting used parts as well if you know someone who is rebuilding their PC. It's always nice to snipe a good deal on a GPU, CPU or whatever from someone you know.
---
This includes liquid cooling (I think the price is worth it) that may not be at all necessary if you're only running WoW Classic, but is likely a must to get the best results if playing other games.
---
What NOT to skimp on: Mobo, CPU, GPU. As buying lame parts in these categories may make your PC a pain to upgrade or just not run games as well as you'd like making the whole endeavor a bit pointless.
---
Spriest not a meme spec
---
Age is just a number!
---
I'd say it is beyond that. This is like holding a KKK rally in Sierra Leone and being surprised when you get gunned down. 
---
The biggest surprise out of everything to me is still that people thought this wouldn't get attacked. It is like some people get so caught up in raiding that they forget what people are like on pvp servers
---
I've got a razor Naga with them bound to my mouse.
---
&gt; I would go 2/2 Healing Focus and 3/3 Imp Healing 
---
And drop what? 10% spell damage from Searing Light? Or PI, which is your main contribution to a raid? 
---
The point of the hybrid build is being able to handle your end game solo content ~~without wanting to kill yourself~~ with ease. Including rep farm, endgame quests, attunements, and farming in general. I agree, most of it can be grouped up for. But sometimes people just aren't interested in carrying your ass around, and at least with this build you can handle yourself for a bit if you have to, without having to rely on somebody all. the. time.
---
Personally I'm going Mining/Skinning to 60, then dropping Skinning for Tailoring. Once I got my Truefaith Vestments I'm dropping tailoring for Engi.
---
Having to run DMT all the time to get world buffs before raids was really the only thing I didn't like.
---
They've said that they will release AQ20 &amp; AQ40 at a later date. I assume this includes the War of the Shifting Sands questline.
---
There are very few items that they don't already share with the locks and rogues respectively. Warriors have a few more pieces than locks I believe so maybe we can add in a few rogues, but come Naxx they will use T3 while the furies use off-sets.
---
ITT: People who did not watch the video arguing points he addresses in the video.

Yup, he power leveled my Necro in Diablo 3 a few months ago from my wife's computer. He gets bored and wants to go explore though.

D2, will be playing on a pvp server with RL friends. I’ll need a few alts to work on if my friends aren’t on or if I’m getting hard camped by a filthy alliance dog.
---
Damn, you are tracking the comments and behavior of most NA players to see how they are acting like the game will release? Or...maybe...is this post baseless speculation.

When I was a teenager me and 6 other rlfs played in same guild for over 5 years. It was great we played very different classes made more friends had a large circle. 
---
These days some would be more committed than the others due to life which is chill. 
---
Never had a problem playing with rlfs  I think it's more defendant on how dramatic your rlfs are or yourself. 
---
Another pro was buying weed for gold back in the day.
---
He was 3 days old in this pic :)
---
Pretty much.. 
---
I inversed the entire picture to figure out what the reverse colour (it was a blue) of the continents was, then I undid the inversion to reset the image 
---
I then changed the hue of the image to the exact colour (blue) - 
---
Since the entire image is black except for the continents, only the continents turned blue since I just tweaked the hue. 
---
 Then I hit the inversion again. Voilà. 
---
Took me about 3 minutes. 
---
It’s just about as stupid simple as it gets, but it kinda worked, didn’t it?
---
Why would you be concerned that random people might be at worst 1 day late to play classic?
---
Is this really that big of a deal?
---
I think that the potential to be screwed by RNG is part of the reason loot feels so valuable. If you don't have that danger, it's harder to appreciate the strokes of good fortune.
---
I'm looking forward to it.
---
Oh man. I all random SCII, WC3 and make alts like a madman. I've planned a 3 character roster this go around. D:
---
Still get your 30 percent from meditation talents .  and blue dragon I guess if being pedantic, but yeah.  5s rule is good knowledge.
---
Theres like this one spot right by the zone boundary of Duskwood and Redridge, just off the path theres a pretty waterfall and a little abandoned cottage. It's also cool because it's right on the edge of the zone boundary, so if you stand on one side of the waterfall you get that nice brassy late afternoon Redridge lighting, and if you stand on the other you get the spooky scary Duskwood lighting.
---
I would always pretend that was my characters house and would chill there from time to time. I never really saw anyone else there: no one uses the path from Lakeshire to Darkshire.
---
It'll be out one month after launch, and anything a priest can farm prior to DM launch will be a rounding error compared to what a priest can earn after it launches.
---
Robe of Aragul is fockin bis muate
---
As a horde player, the bridge in the south of Arathi Highlands. I rarely ever had to cross it, but when I did it always felt magical for some reason.
---
So we made an alliance finally understand!
---
Maybe if you're playing with a group of good players with a good comp. It's really easy to over-pull in vanilla, particularly at lower levels before people have a lot of gear or abilities to help recover from mistakes.
---
The war is over.  Is it not better to kill 100 at a funeral than 100,000 in AV?

Get ready for alt-right edgelords spamming the fuck of barrens

They have a life? But apparently not enough of a life that they can choose what to do with their free time? In my world having a life means being in control of the majority of your time. Working all the time, taking care of kids, having dinners all the time, being dragged out to whatever brilliant idea the SO has every week means you have no life at all.
---
Don't get me wrong, it's fine to live like that, but calling me a nolifer because I choose to have control over my own life is pretty stupid.
---
Looks like the portal icon 🤔
---
Alliance? NA? If so let’s talk!
---
Fuck I can't believe I missed that opportunity.
---
That's entirely subjective on what you want to get out of the game.
---
You can certainly do well enough if you only play a few hours a week.  However, classic is all about time-investment; those that have more time to play, WILL be at an advantage.
---
Logging off
---
Eh.  They're going to spend a lot of time outside of instances and spirit tap is still amazing for leveling.  It's not the worst thing ever.
---
Honestly this is when I plan to play more. I don't make any plans for the first week of a new launch. I'll still jump on launch day of course, but I'm not putting any stock into getting anything accomplished.
---
Rogues are so hard to gear that I wouldn't hang my hat on being one or the other, you're really at the mercy of the rng gods. 
---
If you get super lucky and grab a sacred charge during pre raid gearing then it would be silly to keep using daggers.  
---
I prefer daggers as well though, you can at least Respec and own in PvP with them.
---
Patch is literally their worst fight because you have to unload from the start.
---
That riff raff is so fucking fun, though. It's such a unique moment in an MMORPG's life to really experience the "massively" part of the acronym. 
---
I can't fucking waittttt.
---
Gonna have 1 main Priest and 2 other warlock alts. One will be used for (level 20) soulstones, the other will be used for professions / summoning (level 35).
---
No BFA graphics.  No way to buy gold for money or sell gold for blizzard balance or game time.
---
Quite well, actually. I could be better but I most certainly could be much, much worse.
---
I am in the same situation.
---
I have a group of around 7 RL friends who have never actually played WoW together but have all played WoW and we will be setting up to play together and I can already tell that all but one other person amongst the group is in for the long haul.
---
I already know I will easily outpace the group and when the time comes to find a guild and raid I will be hunting on my own even if the other continue playing at max.
---
Good post, OP. Newcomers might not know this info, and it's important to start your Classic experience off on the right foot.  💕
---
You gents have it good , I need to pretend I sprained my ankle a day before it to have zero partner aggro for a week or two
---
Funny how spending a few thousand hours subconsciously committing something to muscle memory *works so damn well.*
---
Mage
---
Everything you do is directly impactful.  No dots to manage, no ramp up, no combo points, no debuffs(well until you spec fire, WC is incidental)
---
I felt out of love with mage when they gave it pets and the bomb series in wrath and of course ignite tracking for combustion
---
The conveniences(food, water, teleport) just make it all the sweeter.
---
That's a good point, I should have a link there. The only link on mobile right now is at the bottom of the home page, which isn't obvious. I'll make some improvements there.
---
So medium to big cliques?
---
Several things. The reason I think hunter is bad in classic is mainly my comparison to retail vanilla. People didn't play in your deadzones so mages, warlock and to some extent priests was killable back in 05' but they all just stomp while laughing at you now. Even warriors utilize the deadzones to chunk you down whilst you got nothing to defend yourself with.
---
Hunter is probably gonna be as strong in group pvp when they can get every aimed shot off with the follow up auto-attack damage/multi shot. But in duels I don't see them winning with 1 trap. 
---
I was rank 14 on my hunter in Vanilla and I crushed just about anyone except the other rank 13+. Some mages I could beat, others not but from my experience barely anyone used the deadzones back then and thats the real big difference why hunters were great in vanilla retail and suck in classic.
---
Indeed, and as a warlock I have no qualms of passing some items to the shadow priest. I'll even pass the Kazzak leggings even though they pretty much are game-BiS for me with Thadd legs being a minor upgrade.

---
Nothing in this game clears the WSG midfield like Elemental Mastery and Chain Lighting. Toss on the Gathering Storms set for extra fun.
---
&gt;It'll be out one month after launch
---
Wait, do you have a source for that? 
---
Regardless, it's also still up in the air how effective DM Lasher farming will be in Classic. It's obviously very good on pservers, but we have no idea how Blizzard will tackle it, if at all (let alone just how *good* it will be in Classic, with possible changes to drop rates, Lasher hp/damage/resist/armor values, etc etc etc etc)
---
Probably expecting login issues that first night. And then even if you get in you have to deal with extreme crowding. I know that I'm debating whether I'm actually going to log on that first night or just wait until the next day and hop on early in the morning to avoid that initial rush.
---
But you should save that so you can buy your mount
---
Makes sense! Thanks for the response :)
---
Ill take a 6 digit discord code over a teamspeak or mumble address and port number anyday.
---
WELL MET
---
Got my bow ready for shazz.  We've got enough damn ranged!
---
I'm mainly trying to figure out how I want to put in my talents while leveling.
---
As for your build, if you plan on raiding you NEED 5/5 shadow weaving, since that's the only reason you will be getting a raid spot.  Shadow reach is a pretty important pick for pve and pvp alike.
---
MC was hard back then too.  It's just a different time now.
---
I fuck around on this talent calculator every day. Even for classes I don’t play haha. Sometimes I just see what different classes would look like at 60, or at twink levels.
---
Yea that’s like saying heroic raiding is hard because you do it with 5 people. Not my fault you don’t know enough people to fill a 5 man group. 
---
But sure. Brag about doing a 9 when pugs were doing 10s 😂😂😂
---
As long as you don't speed level, you will have all the gold in the world...because if you don't speed leveling, you will gather stuff, skin, travel 10 times/day to sell your crap in the bags, instead not looting/throw them away because "muh speed leveling".
---
Get a carrier, both my kids loved sleeping in that and it unlock both your hands.
---
Preventing a second submerge and more sons is far more important than fr on dps
---
Pretty sure all mounts can be interrupted if you're attacked.  Mana is a non issue since Life Tap exists (for warlocks anyhow).
---
Pet control was wonky, and auto shot was weird. Afaik
---
Troll is way more min/max for any caster
---
I just remember wiping there for months with my guild until we succeeded to clear Zul
---
Good Folks here... !
---
People pushing their glasses up whilst telling me my gear is not BiS and my talent spec is suboptimal while I try to play the game organically rather than automaton based on internet Wikis.
---
*Looks at druid tag.*
---
Have you heard about about our lord and savior melee balance up till 20?
---
If I had an in game funeral for WoW, I would LOVE if the other faction came and tried to crash it. I guess not everyone agrees but I do not think it was as heinous as it appears.
---
1. Having barely any gameplay as ret pal.
---
2. Hunter bugs. Until cata, the class was plagued with bugs.
---
3. Job or PvP weapon : you can only have one.
---
rogues have expose armor also.
---
it's not very good, but they have it.
---
If you take damage, yes. But only lock and pally mounts can be interrupted when you get hit with a Counterspell. Or any other non damaging interrupt.
---
Its depending on your gear, spiritual guidance scales better and you get more out of the spirit on your gear.
---
The extra mana wont make up for spirit tap.
---
Basically his spec makes spirit very strong.
---
This comment just shows what a low tier pleb you are. 4dd is faster than 3 and 1 heal. If you all have a brain it’s better, i said try it because most of you suck so horrible that you need a healer for heroics even
---
Percentage of people that speak english on France and Germany: \~50%.
---
Italy, Poland and Romania \~30%
---
Spain, Portugal, Bulgaria, Hungary \~20%
---
what could go wrong?
---
I'm not signing shit related to bringing more PvP to the game. PvP belongs in instanced battleground settings only.
---
Boo!
---
&gt;LaurentianGames
---
Sent you a DM
---
Don't be ridiculous. What kind of Horde would accept elves?
---
What do you mean in pve or pvp?  For example, if you are an ugly person, and you go out to the bar with a bunch of haggardly looking friends around you, then you will look like the diamond in the rough.  But, if you step out of your bubble and compare yourself to others, maybe you will change how you dress, smell and act in public.  Same thing can be said about raiding as enhancement, oomkin or retardadin.
---
You're speaking the absolute truth lol. Anyone who disagrees can talk to my 7/8 Nightslayer, 6/8 Bloodfang rogue with a Lobotomizer and Glacial Blade lmao...
---
But what if 10 or even 100 gold sellers ruin the game for thousands of players who then cancel their subscription ? No worth it for them. I'll just wait and see tho, maybe there won't be any gold sellers.
---
I leveled several characters to 60 in 2005 and 2006. I can confirm that this strategy does work without piracy.

Oh okay because it's a pvp server that means it's okay to on purpose fuck with people who's friend actually in real life just died.
---
Hunter are great for duels. You’ll get dicked down by casters, but you have good matchups into rogues, warriors, paladins, shaman and possibly druids.
---
Gear is important but its not everything. In classic you can outplay a lot with engineering. Also the blue pvp set is more than enough.
---
It’s so fast that you didn’t even do the minimum. Ok. 
---
It’s so much better that you are getting worse loot. 😂😂😂
---
Go horde.
---
IF you plan on raiding, resto shaman is always in demand.
---
If you plan on going 5 mans, pvp, or w/e else, ele resto is the end all be all.
---
Well its not that simple. Depending on your AP( changes when crusader procs) You may execute or bloodthirst instead. If you have proc weapon or windfury you should use hamstring over heroic strike. You often will have too much threat to use HS. Threat management is huge in Vanilla. Swapping to overpower is also a thing. Slam spec is an option. Pooling rage to dump on crusader procs or execute phase is another technique.
---
Paladins truly have the best of both worlds
---
Would be Darkshore for me too. Also collecting all the shored creature remains.
---
But that just means that you can sell the highest value weapon you dont have the skills for. That shit sells for 1g 5s.  *An entire gold and 5 silver*
---
PLUS the reward money. That's value my guy
---
Shield + dagger + flametongue is about efficiency, because of block+armor from the shield, and fast attack flametongue damage.  Not about higher dps than windfury.
---
You most likely wont raid with PI. It doesnt do enough.
---
Youd be better off going half way into shadow to buff warlocks in the raid.
---
Biggest problem with LW on resto is that your harvesting of leather is a function of your kill speed, and you're kill speed is....less than stellar. Frankly it's to the point where once you've capped your LW you might just want to drop skinning and pick up Herbalism or Mining to farm cash and just buy mats off the AH or do combines.

**&lt;Calamitous Intent&gt; [NA] [PvP] [Alliance] [18+] [PST]**
---
**Guild Type**: PvE (Plan to clear all content)
---
**Time Zone**: Pacific Standard Time (PST)
---
**About Us**: &lt;Calamitous Intent&gt; is currently being built by a group of friends who dearly loved World of Warcraft in its heyday. With the announcement of Classic, our worlds were turned completely upside down and we are ecstatic to begin this journey together with all of you. &lt;Calamitous Intent&gt; will strive to be a mature and respectful group of people, yet still encourage (*cough* require) silly behaviour and plan to have tons of laughs and fun in the process. All of our founding members are 21+ and have raiding experience during various stages of the game.
---
**Our Goal**: We aim to be a semi-hardcore raiding guild. What does semi-hardcore mean? It just means that we want to take raiding seriously while we are doing it, but at the same time we have real life responsibilities so we cannot raid as much as the most hardcore of guilds. What this amounts to is a reasonable schedule for raiding with the expectation that our raiders will be as prepared as a hardcore raider.
---
We are looking for both raiders and casual members to foster a strong guild community. We expect casual members to help out with farming on rare occasion when needed to aid the raid team.
---
**Requirements**:
---
You must be 18+ years old. We will most likely make small exceptions to this rule but only once we spend time playing with a person in game and feel that they can adhere to a raid schedule and mesh well with the guild.
---
**Raiding**:
---
* Schedule: M, Tu, Th (Optional Wed depending on progression) from 8-11 PST
---
* Loot System: DKP
---
**Recruitment**: 
---
* Currently recruiting all classes/roles except for Main Tank
---
* Excluded specs for raiding: Prot Paladin, Ret Paladin

It's basically the opposite of "THE FLOOR IS LAVA"
---
I think you got those level requirements from retail.
---
Travel form is not learned until 30; i don't play shaman but i believe it's the same for ghost wolf.
---
If you have all quests you can just steamroll them with your friends. Its a nice boost and the gear helps with leveling.
---
The Dreamweave set is VERY good, and will last you to 58+ pre-raid BiS easily. Available @ lvl 40.
---
Shadowweave and Red Mageweave sets are also good.
---
Most decent Cloth 1-55 come from tailoring, and only really start around lvl 35+. Until then you're basically stuck with whatever you can get out of SFK. 
---
But the Dreamweave is available early on, mats are cheap, and they are very good pieces of loot for any clothie.
---
Havent even thought about how discord might affect WoW. Do people do this in retail? 
---
Hopefully people just allow in-game chat to suffice.
---
I would drop the 1 point in renew as it is completly useless, and maybe 1 point in inspiration if you insist on the rest of the points to get healing focus.
---
You did not read my comments. We got 3 chests so a +12 key but that cannot be done without healer, i can’t tank that at least. So faster and faster loot. Healers are there to do dos too not to heal your mistakes.
---
Make female NE and talk using lots of emojis.
---
Since it was build for casuals, yes. 
---
You will /droll on mighty raiders decked in T2/T3, mounted on epic mounts, if friendly, or getting roflstomped by them in the open world, if opposite faction.
---
But that doesn't mean you can't enjoy Classic. It just means that you should understand and accept your limitations, and as long as you do, the game will be enjoyable.
---
I'm hoping for TBC and WotLK legacy servers as well down the road. If I could live in WotLK WoW forever I would.
---
Nope, thats part of the weapons.
---
I've been thinking about it for a while, and I'm not sure that the Abyss Shard is the optimal choice of reward from the warlock quest after all.
---
The trinket's benefit is that it saves you a soul shard and 60% to 100% of your base mana, depending on the choices you made for talents. But, by taking up an additional slot in your bag, the benefit of eliminating the soul shard requirement is negligible. There should almost never be a situation where you go a half hour without getting access to a new soul shard, unless you've planned very poorly. And, is depriving yourself of another trinket to use in some given fight really any better than saving that 100% of base mana, when you could be using the lengthy cast time to cast other spells instead?
---
Untalented, you benefit more from the free mana cost, but have to put in additional time casting. In the time it takes to summon your pet, you could be casting two mana drains instead. Talented, you've got an easier time casting quickly, but are only getting a one time 60% of base mana cost reduction, which seems much worse than using a mana trinket over the duration of the fight.
---
People say that the trinket is irreplaceable, but from where I'm sitting that doesn't seem at all true. I admit that the trinket has unique utility starting from an emergency situation where you're out of mana and can't afford to wait for it before you need to summon your pet, but with a lengthy cast time such situations are going to be rare, and you'll probably avoid getting into such situations in the first place if you pick a different trinket and cast different spells instead.
---
However, I am new to the class and have no experience with it, so maybe this is all me being an idiot. What are your thoughts?
---
Draenor-Eu was just drama-eu.
---
PvP belongs in instanced battleground settings only.
---
Warlock and paladin summoned mounts cost mana and interrupt the 5-second rule. If you're trying to level as fast as possible as a warlock you should still buy your level-40 faction mount.
---
Shamans dont compete with other clothies for gear!
---
Chuck Norris punched himself out of his mother womb. Hence the term C-section
---
Ehh I kinda get the last one, because that's a legit problem. The guild to member relationship has to start somewhere and obviously any player is hesitant to start putting in major effort based only on the promise of future rewards whereas a guild is hesitant to award loot to a new guy based only on the promise of future effort. It's a bit of a game of chicken.
---
Sounds like you’ve been playing on some really scuffed private servers.
---
View spiritual guidance a different way. It makes spirit extremely strong.
---
Spirit tap, spiritual guidance and the passive spirit regen.
---
You are looking at a gimmick hybrid spec when it is already there with spirit stacking
---
You shouldnt need to grind 100g. You should have 50g by the time ur 38
---
I kinda like just hanging out around the mailbox in Crossroads and healing people after their duels.
---
Hey I didn't know R Kelly played on Horde
---
How is it faster when your group is done after one key?
---
Why would you bother doing something that gives you loot below the cap? This is like doing lfr when you’re raiding mythic. Sure it’s faster and you get faster loot. But the loot is shit. 
---
Or maybe it isn’t. If you’re stuck doing +9s I assume you’re not a cutting edge raider.
---
I’m not looking forward to Barrens Chat. 
---
Back in the day it was meme-y and funny (Chuck Norris jokes etc) but I think how the gaming community has grown it will probs be full of people making racist remarks as if that is humour and anyone that doesn’t like it is a ‘snowflake’.
---
Nah, then you clear all mobs and as soon as you pull the last one someone walks up and mines it.
---
Zoomers complaining about graphics. Imagine that.
---
Hello Sir!
---
Do you have a moment to talk about our lord and savior, Druid?
---
Experiencing The Undercity for the first time. Just nothing but ruins and you get underground and there is a whole ass city just chillin there. I also can’t forget the cockroach vendor.
---
Thing is, nearly all guilds will be running old content for alts, new recruits and those few ellusive gear pieces their prime raiders need. In many cases guilds will take on "second string" members to fill in these raids to hedge against attrition and burnout.
---
I dont know who you are
---
YOU'D BE SURPRISED HOW FAR THOSE PAYCHECK GO WITH ALL THEM ZEROS
---
Well if your feet are under the ground instead on it... your dead.  
---
So basically... "Don't be Dead"
---
You think you do, but you don’t.
---
You would in a vacuum, yes. But this is a real person we're talking about. Asking them to respec every raid means that they're going to need to spend hours upon hours outside of raids farming gold in order to do something that does not benefit them personally. They're not going to do that for free. They will want something (probably priority on loot) in return.
---
If you want the best healing loot to go to the best healers first, then an actual Shadow Priest is a better option.
---
Literally been doing the same thing
---
Naxx with the screams of women and children until you kill Thaddeus... yeesh, what an awesomely creepy ambient sound!
---
Hunter is better for nightfall anyways
---
I'm playing a Human mage (probably...), if I were Horde i'd play Tauren or Troll Shaman. 
---
Shaman (Alliance) has been my main since TBC, so i'd just go back to the old faithful.
---
you can stack up shadow weaving by just spamming rank 1 SW:P and it's not like it's going to fall off with an 80% chance and a 15 second duration. I can definitely see how useful shadow reach is but ugh, I really want blackout.
---
?? One key, we have 5 of our own than when they are past 9 we get a guild healer and continue. This xpac not indeed bfa sucks way to bad to bother. Raiding is way to slow and way to much depends on other people which is bad.
---
I'll probably be doing a similar thing (though I'm pretty set on druid as main), but will get plenty of lvl20s I imagine, and might push some of them slowly to 60.  Let me know if you wanna coordinate servers.
---
Kek
---
I'm just debating if I want to respec at 20.  For Druids, it not as important, since you can get so much out of travel form without a mount.  Staying full feral at least gives me some value with the talents for bear form; which helps if I want to tank RFC or WC.
---
I'm not looking to speed level, so max-efficiency isn't something I'm worried about.
---
If you want to do everything you mentioned, you'll need to switch specs a lot.
---
Someone linked a holy spec that has spirit tap and goes to disc for the mana regen. That will give you the closest thing to what you want.
---
Unless you just want to play deep disc. Then just do you and play disc.
---
Because I always was the most inefficient leveler ever for many reasons, dungeons were actually what gave the me fastest levels. I always looked at them as a chance to catch my breath and relax a little bit (aside from the inevitable dungeon pains). Once you got rolling though it was a breeze.
---
Compared to me reading a quest log and going the wrong direction 3 times before finding where I need to be lol.
---
You respond to my comments every single time I post one.
---
Being poor.
---
Mild nostalgia for my old farming spots is one thing. Multiple days of grinding to support one night of raid/PvP consumables is another.
---
The only point I would see is, the guy is too poor to keep speccing between pvp and pve.  His guild needs a warm body that will cast windfury totem and heal himself through encounters.  In pvp as enhancement you had to heal yourself a lot or you would die in tons of 1v1 because you took so much damage as a front line mail class with no shield.  So, having a person that could think might be a good addition to a raid line up of people laying down in fire.  
---
Would I ever ask my raid leader to pick up an enhancement shaman for a raid? Nope not over elemental (more int and mp5 gear) and not over a pure resto raid specced shaman.
---
No epic mount, no dinner
---
I’ll have at least 4 characters before the first one is level 10.
---
yeah you just wont have it for Ragnaros because of the amount of MC mats needed.
---
Wut lol?
---
Do you want to heal and drop totems or would you prefer to spam shadowbolts?
---
Keep your stick on the ice
---
WHAT A COINCIDENCE IT IS ALSO MY LAST YEAR AND I ALSO STUDY COMPUTER SCIENCE. ROCK ON BROTHER PLEASE GRADUATE.
---
It's like saying "here's a video of a kid with no vaccines that turned out fine so vaccines are worthless".
---
I just want to get ZinRohk on my Warrior this time around.
---
Tried to get it for XMog for a while before it was removed. Then over 1000 Archeology Troll finds and still no sword.
---
It's my White Whale
---
Not the first few.  The rep alone is a bitch. But eventually.
---
Mostly just my husband this time...but I played with RL friends and family in the past and it was the best time I ever had in the game. It can definitely work with the right group.
---
Then I turn on them and hit em with the dots + fear.  I don't run from fights in general.  I am stubborn.
---
Disengage that actually moves you
---
that's pog
---
A shadowpriest is pretty much never the option, no matter how much you spin the narrative.
---
A healer doing 70% of normal healing &gt; DPS doing 35% of normal DPS.
---
I can't imagine how frustrating being an Alliance lock is on a PVP server with so many Undead to deal with
---
[Knock Knock Knock](https://youtu.be/5wJpdA-LE3o?t=18)
---
Had this on my Tank with Draconian Deflector for everrrrr.
---
This is painfully accurate. Combine with the "go get me 37 boar assess" quests, low level questing is amazing lol.
---
I don't look forward to getting my rock fury bracers...
---
Plus these were one of the only 1h swords sheath on back
---
Grats on the gaming buddy.  I wish I knew what I did wrong my kids all prefer roblox and minecraft even though we did the same thing as you since Wrath.  Maybe cause they never played classic?
---
The question begins with terminology. What does casual even mean?
---
If you really play only occasionally you'll probably be totally destroyed by high geared endgame players who team up using TeamSpeak and so forth. The game really hasn't any mechanical to mitigate that. That's why I loved it so much back in those days.
---
God I hope to hell this doesn't take off, but I'm sure it will. I don't want to listen to randoms in my 5-mans just for a "sense of community" or something. If there's an LFG discord, you can bet it's going to include voice or "join this other discord server for voice before I invite you" crap. If the in-game LFG channel is barren of useful groups because everyone is actually using a Discord LFG, that will kill my desire to play classic.
---
Then again, my classic experience wasn't the same as others apparently. I didn't keep some list of names for good and bad players. I couldn't tell you a single name of anyone on my original server or guild. We raided, chatted a bit, and did our dungeons. "The community will blacklist ninjas and jerks" or "Everyone will know if you're a pillar of the community" is 180 degrees from my experience back then. People wanting to randomly group up and chat while questing *at level 4* are just... weird.
---
I’m using vacation days, but working that Monday because it doesn’t come out till 6 est and no point taking the whole day when I’ll be done at 5 anyway
---
I think the purple glow was also an enchant
---
Oh okay, that makes a lot of sense. I wasn't sure because I've seen a few people randomly advocate for spellpower enh shaman in late Vanilla PvE, but haven't seen it in any capacity other than pre-40 leveling.
---
That analogy doesn't work, because you are comparing an RPG with enemy factions to a gathering in a park. The social dynamics are completely different. 
---
I'm not saying it wasn't a dick move, but the same thing would have happened on any other pvp server. I was also a lot more roleplayish with the whole "alliance are my enemies" thing, so attacking any event from the other faction would have been a plus.
---
Former Grand Marshal and I’m only going for blue set for pvp. And mix in some raid gear if I’m lucky enough to get stuff. Hell a lot of pre raid BIS are heat for pvp.
---
Engineering...always engineering
---
Well at least we don't have homework to do now
---
People annoying other people for internet fame might have fun but they are certainly not funny.
---
Back in the day I had no clue what I was doing. Managed to get the entire eskhanders set on my rogue. Did decent damage until I finally got my perditions/CHT for a proper dagger build.

---
roast me
---
Yet another reason why I'd love a toggle for old and new character models. Less nightmares.
---
I would try it, but if I ended up as a troll or gnome I don't think I would play long
---
I played an ele sham on the equivalent of phase 1/2 on a pserver. They shred. You can burst for over 3k in dire maul gear. LB + CL + shock crits. Talents give you 11 crit on lightning. That's huge. I was dumsptering people while I was in greens/blues as 30/021. They are fantastic all stages of the game and just get stupid good with tier 2.5+.
---
DAMNIT, I LEGIT MADE THAT UP SINCE I COULDNT REMEMBER, BUT FOR OTHERS I GUESS THE MEMORY'S AS FRESH AS IF IT HAPPENED YESTERDAY ^^
---
Its not that I didn't have a clue though, is it?
---
Not having a clue would be making something up. It's not a private server macro. It's a 1.12 macro. No I wasn't wrong either, deal with it.
---
Oh glad you explain that, I thought you were really waiting for Jesus Christ!
---
&gt; certainly not funny.
---
Well that's your opinion.
---
After the first pull of the dungeon, I always pre cast shield then drink to fill my mana.  Heal with a flash heal, then see what damage out put looks like before shielding or continue healing the tank to full.  I use renew when running from pack to pack and someone is not topped off.  If a mob leaves the melee range of the tank go ahead and pre cast fade, because it is likely to be heading your direction instead of a hunter, mage or warlock that crit hard on a secondary kill target.
---
Exactly. Comedy is comedy. Nothing is off limits.
---
UNFRIENDLY REMINDER THAT HORDE AND ALLIANCE CHARACTERS CAN'T PLAY ON THE SAME SERVERS.  AS IT SHOULD BE HORDE SCUM
---
FUCK THAT WAS A GOOD CLAPBACK!
---
Step 1: Be paladin
---
Step 2: ???
---
Step 3: Profit
---
This is so wrong. How do you 1 shot someone in mail?
---
In a raid, that will never be an issue.  There is also he fact that as a ranged character, you have to exceed 30% of the tank's threat in order to pull off of him.  If the pulls are handled properly, this will never happen.
---
Pulling threat as shadow will only ever be noticeable in 5-mans, or with low geared/skilled tanks.
---
Considering the avg American I wouldn't be surprised if people got the date wrong
---
Instant lvl 60 servers?!?!
---
Too many memes in one post
---
It's basically just "keep your shit together, get a fucking grip on reality and keep pushing forward in life ".
---
In only dosent work if you plan to level at the same speed, unless you all have 100% free time you'll never be km the same quest at the same time etc, I'm playing with RL friends but we all know that we'll out level each other, ultimately we'll all be 60 and be doing end game content together
---
Are there any other abilities that can physically move an enemy player like this? Like is there an engineering bomb or something?
---
Is it fun? No. Is it nostalgic? YES.
---
Cheer up we still get darkmoon and midsummer flame
---
Thanks for breaking this
---
You never skip execute but yes with high ap you prio BT over execute
---
If you're playing with a coordinated group, you might want to invest 5 points into Spirit Tap (shadow), so your teammates can let some mobs live for you to finish off with wand. This helps A LOT with mana regen.
---
Don't attack with physical damage :)
---
I need you to clarify something. Are you a virgin who loves dildos, or are you a lover of virgin dildos?
---
wouldnt "all Leroy" be modifying "go?"
---
there is an ignore list and if it gets full there are addons
---
That’s what I’ve been reading. If you’ve got a good 5 man you can rock it pretty hard. I’ll be doing that with my buddies.

Dwarves without beards were a mistake

Dead Weight [H] - PVP
---
Hello There Reddit,
---
I work in marketing so when I see all of these super structured guild recruitment posts my training says, do what stands out. 
---
Our guild wont be a family. I'm always skeptical of that workplace coolaid that pretends at being more than what it is. We are going to be a casual guild that will raid and clear content on the first try - we are going to do this by following our guild's only rule... To not be Dead weight., to not have a single person that is being carried to gear.
---
With us your time will be respected, we will raid US EST times 8pm - Midnight probably Tuesday / Thursday but I'll make a poll once we fill our last 15 or so members so I can make a more informed decision. 
---
The guild will use loot council with a transparent list system where you can basically see what you are going to be getting next when as drops occur. The final say will be up to loot council, which will be composed of four officers and a rotating member for as much transparency as possible. 
---
So yea, Dead Weight will be a place where we respect your time, most of us are in our late twenties with jobs and responsibilities and when we aren't raiding we will likely be greifing the alliance. Because whats the point of all that gear if we can't make a few people miserable right?
---
PM me with any and all questions! Fuck guild websites.
---

He didn’t mention LFR lol.
---
If your tank is missing health at the start of the pull, renew will make the mobs run to you since you now have more aggro than the tank from being the first target of the mobs.  The tank will need to chase them down and the pull will be messy if you start off with renew or a heal on the pull.  PW:S is very valuable here to keep the pulls organized and calm, even if you don't love the effective health per mana.

**&lt;Live Die Repeat&gt;** | Alliance NA (EST) | PVE | Semi-Hardcore/Partly Casual
---
**Goals**: Progression in a friendly environment without huge time commitments.
---
**Raids**: Tuesday and Wednesday from 8PM-11PM EST
---
**Loot**: DKP + Loot Council
---
**Expectations**: We expect all of our members to be excellent to each other and to our fellow players on the server. There will be zero tolerance for toxic players both in and out of guild.
---
**Philosophy**: We believe progression raiding can be achieved without giving in to bad behaviors or raiding 5 nights a week. Players are expected to come to raids on time, prepared, and knowing their role in the fights ahead. Players are also expected to be kind and helpful to each other in raids. Loot will largely be DKP/EPGP (with some constraints on class/spec) with the exception of class/game changing items which will be Loot Council. 
---
Discord - DM me for an invite.
---
WebSite TBA!
---
DM me here on reddit for now!
---
Boring History: I've played since vanilla but never raided until TBC. I am very much looking forward to this! I have played tank since TBC between warrior, paladin, and monk and am excited to be the MT and raid leader of a guild again. The guild structure will have class leaders and officers and I will be the GM.
---
You should drop Shadow Affinity plus Silent Resolve nevertheless. Remember, it's ALWAYS tank's fault if he is unable tohold aggro.
---
Five seconds of fear immunity every two minutes? With a paladin leveling partner, LIPs, and engineering, I'm not worried about it. Fear isn't the only effect that makes warlocks hard to deal with in PvP.
---
Lw isn't worth it.  Early on the devilsaur will be a big item but as the server ages the LW isn't used very often
---
When it's your first at that age they're hard to put down. You just love soaking up all them cuddles.
---
Sounds like Uldaman
---
Or BRD
---
Didn't we all agree no wholesome posts?!
---
Fury warriors have three fear breaks already. Judt saying, you will rarely use WotF. But fem undead is BiS front flip animations which is whay really counts.
---
Hah funny I am in the exact position. A month away
---
&gt;Which means either some idiot who literally plays 24/7 can make it impossible or there's fixing and choosing who gets to be the next HWL.
---
The first being literally lethal to sustain for more than a few days, the latter seems more likely. That means the skill required to succeed in high-level PvP is organization and cooperation, the same requirements needed to succeed in high-level PvE. Seems right to me.
---
Grats on the baby dude!
---
A lot of the playerbase will be players that hasnt played for like 10 years. Also playing casually, maybe 15 hours a week. Im not seeing it happening, unless you get into a really good guild that has done it all on private servers and happily take you along.
---
You mean Durid.
---
Again, I'm not arguing that point. It is better (although it's debatable how much better - Shadow Priest can meet the minimum DPS needed on any boss in the game, which is all that matters).
---
Gear progression matters. You will progress faster if your healers that actually put out 100% healing get the best gear first, not the hybrid Priest you're showering with gear to get him to play that spec.
---
the mere thinking of it is divorce worthy, get the papers, paper boi!
---
I used to use the offhand one on my dagger rogue in vanilla.
---
Is it optimized for that extra 1.89% damage output of X other offhand? Probably not. But it's a jagged, glowing back-sheathed sword, so who gives a damn.
---
As an alliance player; that's the spirit!
---
Seriously, /u/MrBrorito, do you think anyone gives a fuck?
---
Kinda like saying don’t be an airhead, or keep your wits about you.
---
Well they should
---
No, the server called WoWScape was mentioned in many news outlets due to the massive fine they were hit with. I would argue that one was really well-known, and was nearly a decade before Nost.
---
It doesn't take luck to get zg weapons.  This would be easy to get again
---
Im not sure how much I will PvP yet. I did pvp only in tbc, not a single raid. But bgs has never been fun to me, I prefered arena.
---
Greens will sell if they have a desirable random enchantment. There are some greens that are legit pre-raid BIS for some classes (+healing power notably) 
---
At lower levels, good greens with a required level of 19,29,39... will also sell since people will be looking to gear out their twinks.
---
Don't blame Razor, you should have kept it in your pants and no-life it like the rest of us deplorables! 
---
Gratz mate ;). Get one of those baby holding slings, babies love that, and they are very secure.
---
They will. On the release date.
---
100% agree with this.
---
Gaming culture as a whole is different now than in 2004 and honestly I'm not sure some of it is a good fit for WoW as it existed back then.
---
The only real money making I have is at 40 farming SM pick pocketing just long enough to get my level 40 mount should I be short while frugally leveling.
---
And of course if I need to grind, grinding high value gray mobs like the cats in STV and Swamp of Sorrows.
---
Pulling threat is hardly a death sentence. They hit like wet noodles.
---
Berserker is a nice racial for both PvP and PvE tho, so troll is solid. Unless you really want to no life PvP, then go undead :)
---
We all know you'll at least try to log in. As least I am!
---
No Transmog
---
min-maxers will min-max.
---
They stack resto shaman for the totems.
---
That’s why I roll tank, so I don’t have to deal with that.

I had a RL friend once.

# &lt;Dark Spirit&gt; [H] [PvP] [NA][US-East] 
---
Seeking to establish a guild that is **fundamentally about PvP**, and **ignores PvE raiding**. Dark Spirit seeks to recruit primarily those interested in Druid, Priest, and Shaman classes of all specs. Ignore raid drama, forget heal-botting, and kick in some alliance teeth. **Rank, not Raid!**
---
**Faction**: Horde
---
**Servertype**: PVP
---
**Time Zone:** US East (EDT/EST)
---
**Event Time**: Every other day, primetime
---
**Main Classes:** Druid, Priest, Shaman
---
**Alt Classes:** Any
---
**wPVP &amp; BGs:** Yes
---
**PvE Raiding:** No
---
**Optional Twink Bracket:** 19
---
**Phased Progression**
---
* Phase 1: Core Quests &amp; Dungeons for key equipment quest rewards. Twink prep. wPvP zone control &amp; town raiding.
---
* Phase 2+: sPvP Reputation &amp; Rank 10+ gear progression
---
**Events &amp; Schedule**
---
* Guild event every other day, loosely primetime EST, as strict scheduling is not as necessary as PvE raiding. As such, other NA time zones may not be a problem.
---
* sPvP/BG , wPvP zone/town raid, key quests, etc.
---
**Interested?**

No, because I don't want to account share and rank 14 isn't actually impressive
---
Get one of those mechanical swings for the baby and put it down next to your computer
---
&gt; Yeah after your guild has farmed  it enough toss one to the shaman, but first one needs to go to a non-meme spec.
---
There's absolutely no garauntee you'll see even one. Many guilds farm MC for months on end and see neither of the three legendary drops.

If I had a hammer

I'd hammer in the morning

I'd hammer out a warning

I'd hammer out love between

All over this land
---
easy solution if you cant decide. throw a coin: heads shaman, tail warlock.  if you are unhappy with the outcome you know what you want to play. if you are happy with the outcome you know what to play ;). most times when you throw a coin in the air you will realise that you will be more happy with one thing than the other.
---
if you want to pvp warlock on alliance side will be a pain iin the ass because of all the undead racials
---
OI!
---
dead gnomes on the land !! usually naked ones with pink and blue and green hair ...
---
Thats sort of the exact decision process I'm facing rn. I'm not speed leveling either, its just that low level balance looks so *fun.* And the initial respec cost is dirt cheap, like 1 silver. But I also probably wanna tank DM and that is made easier by 5 into feral...
---
repair bills when leveling is so trivial I wouldn't even considering it part of a budget plan for getting your mount.
---
Nobody played without addons even during vanilla.
---
Somebody's gotta do it, and there's passive income to be made just doing Black Dragonscale or Hide of the Wild combines. There's always new players coming up who want this gear.
---
How "worth it" every trade skill is really is a function of the supply of crafters. In vanilla there was a glut of crafters since most people decided to learn how to craft gear for their class. However today engineering is far more valued than it was back then, and double-gatherer is also very popular. This means we're going to see fewer smiths and LWers than we did before. I suspect there will be a better opportunity for crafters to make cash this time around since the supply will be smaller.
---
So the mage casts their damaging instant cast instead. You are greatly overestimating this "problem", it's very minor at worst, and only in PVP.
---
Probably an easier and more simple thing to do.  That being said though, lots of people over value their old hardware on something like Craigslist, so it's real easy to over pay for old hardware.
---
STV, world pvp paradise!! Might change my mind after experiencing a heavy corpse camp at hunter camp
---
Jesus! You have like 200 comments whining about this! Is this really what you wanted to spend your day on? Condemning the actions of self proclaimed assholes for something they did in a video game 13 years ago? Ugh people like you are the reason for the pussification of the internet.
---
Repair bills when leveling is so trivial I wouldn't even considering it part of a budget plan for getting your mount.
---
&gt; But in duels I don't see them winning with 1 trap.
---
Is Feign -&gt; Trap still busted? 
---
That sucks.
---
You seem to be under the impression that the priest somehow requires extreme compensation.
---
If you have to bribe a player to switch to a spec that would massively benefit the raid, I'd question as to why he's in the guild in the first place.
---
That's akin to having 20 mages and everyone of them outright refusing to play Winter's Chill.
---
Am I wrong? Did you know hit cap was 9% and willfully ignore it? Or  were you clueless like most in Vanilla? 
---
There was no reliable source for hit cap in Vanilla , so most ppl didnt know it. In AQ/Naxx gear, its very easy for a tank to hit cap and no reason not to. So you probably just didnt know.
---
yeah and if it’s all still too easy you gotta start clicking all abilities
---
Oh, I'm in the same thing. But that's why my suggestion to them was to build a $400 base system with Ryzen APU, which would play WoW just fine, if they want to later upgrade, just plop in a GPU and you're doing fine.
---
Thank you! Yeah I really would only use the machine for wow classic, console for everything else.
---
Tauren Hunter? Really?
---
So, I assume you'll be playing a paladin then?
---
Most guilds are aware they don't need to be fully optimal to clear raids. You overestimate how easy it will be to get a raid full of 40 people let alone 40 of the perfect class. People will be taking anything just like they did in Classic because a warm body is better than nothing most of the time. 
---
There's a reason they went to 25man in TBC. You don't even need 40 competent people to kill anything up to AQ40 and even that only requires competence so you don't spend 8 hours killing trash mobs.
---
Problem with Nightfall and Annihilator arguments is that you might aswell just spend those money on an offtank spamming a low-rage cost instant ability. They will blow your uptime out of the water and especially Annihilator is critical to stack up quickly.
---
Can confirm, flicker build is great when you need 1 hand free.
---
In was not aware, 6pm est on 8/26 huh
---
100% is gotta get that extra crit chance
---
Why beasts in particular?
---
Thats my dwarf rogues name
---
They definitely still do this even in BFA, I just checked in game and no helmet hides my majestic eyebrows
---
No shatter or imp. CS?  
---
I hope you're aiming to play on a PvE server.

**&lt;DPRA&gt; Alliance | NA PvP | EST | Semi Casual**
---
**Intro**:
---
Welcome to the DPRA! We praise our Beloved Leaders and fight for the the Party above all!
---
We are a new guild created for Classic with simple goals. The guild founders have full time jobs and lives outside of the game so we structure things around that lifestyle, but all are welcome. We want to foster a community of chill people, and we want to help all our members achieve their goals within the game.
---
We are accepting pre-release members who want to raid, PvP, or just have a community to level / run dungeons with.
---
Thursday, Sunday starting 8:30pm EST
---
We have somewhat casual raiding requirements, but a focused approach. We **accept raiders of any spec**, and we **do not require consumables farming or world buffs** for raids. We will begin raiding ~2 months after release so our members can have a more relaxed leveling experience.
---
Despite our non-hardcore requirements, we want to clear all content and be able to eventually farm the earlier raids. Prior raiding experience is not required, but adaptability and teamwork are key. We will be a tight knit team and feel the rewards of overcoming challenges!
---
For loot we use a custom SK+LC system.
---
**PvP**:
---
For us full time employed peoples, the grind towards R14 is probably out of the question. However, we still plan to have a dedicated PvP team. This group will strive to become a notorious pre-made BG team on the server with a solid win rate.
---
*If you think yourself a skilled PvPer, want a regular PvP group, yet don't have the time to go for high rank grinds, then this is the place for you!*
---
**Party Benefits**:
---
- Daily bread!
---
- Youth Development Program!
---
- Free Speech Commune!
---
*If you have dissenting opinions then our People's Counsel officers want to hear from YOU!*
---
**To Join**:

---
Naxx gear ruining PvP.
---
Yes, the longest, max rank heal will always give the best return with regards to hp/mana. You need a bunch of +healing before that stops being true. More than you can realistically get before cap, probably. Unless like the way you level is dungeon spam 20-60. In that case you might end up having a superior hps situation with downranks at like mid 50ies.
---
PW:S is strictly worse than flash heal as they both effectively take 1.5s to cast. PW:S is only useful when the target would not survive the 1.5 seconds of a global cooldown, or if for some reason you have to heal while moving. Renew + PW:S is not panic buttons, they're for healing on the move if you absolutely have to. 
---
Your instincts as described in the OP are pretty spot on.
---
The single best way to improve your hppm efficiency at any point is to avoid overhealing. At 20 your Heal rank 1 gives 2.13 hppm, whereas lesser heal rank 3 only gives 2.05 hppm. But that means that you only need to overheal by 4% of your Heal 1 for a Lesser Heal 3 to give better return. It's better to use a less effective heal than to overheal, almost always. If you can somehow heal more than the targets entire hp bar with your most effective heal, switch to a less effective one.
---
At very low levels, intellect is better than spirit, since you won't be recovering mana during the fight, and it is very possible to run oom before the fight is done. Intellect helps with that while spirit doesn't. Still, as soon as you can realistically get through a pull without going oom, spirit becomes better than intellect. There is a point where you're in shitty greens and whites, and the tank is in shitty greens and whites, where this won't be the case and int is better there.
---
This should go away pretty quick, but it's something to be aware of if you're doing a couple dungeons pre 20 or so.
---
What they do in speedrun dungeons on live is that you take a small sip of water every time combat drops and let it tick for a couple seconds before moving to the next pull. So while the tank is pulling and for a couple seconds into the fights, you're drinking, or walking over to keep up with them after drinking. That'll cut down downtime by like 80%, but it's expensive to do for classic. Still, there's little excuse not to do that if you have a mage in the party.
---
Once you get some gear, and the tank can take a beating without having a heal coming for them, you can start working the 5second rule a bit. 
---
When your tank is taking random ish damage, it can feel pretty dangerous to do a large heal, and more comfortable to use smaller, less effective ones. The way to deal with that is to use your largest heal even when the tank is at high hp, but when you get halfway through the cast, if you can't cast the spell without overhealing cancel it by pressing escape. Or have a /stopcasting macro that you bind to something easy to reach. Then cast it again, and repeat. That way, if your spell is 3 seconds long, you'll almost always be within 1.5s of landing it on the tank if he turns out to suddenly need it. Beginning to cast a spell won't trigger the 5s rule, so you can even do this while regaining mana.
---
Sorry if this was a bigger wall of text than you needed.
---
Alliance warlock PVP can be annoying for sure. Specifically because of that, warlocks are usually a very underplayed alliance class. The bright side of that is that it drives demand for them in raids.
---
What would be more "Horde-like" than to raid a capital city and kill as many alliance as possible in her memory.
---
Ferda!
---
Yeah I mean it took us a while to figure fire out, but now we have a handle on atomic energy. 
---
Can’t unlearn 15 years of games
---
I saw this book in an airport once, is it any good?
---
the weapon  specialisation was a thing in tbc afaik. in classic you only have armor7weaponsmith
---
Getting that first blue at like level 21 felt better than any epic from bfa
---
&gt; castle town
---
Ironforge was the place to be in Vanilla, not Stormwind.
---
True, I think we can still expect sunken temple class quests, starting silithus zone quests, jintha’alor quests, and really any quest added later with no tie-in to gated release content.
---
Quests we will absolutely have to wait for a phase: BWL quests, ZG quests, AQ quests, Naxx quests, DM quests, tier 0.5, BG quests, Darkmoon Faire quests, warlock/paladin mount quests, and silithus twilight cult quests.
---
I dunno man I certainly didn't speed level when I first played and I had nowhere close to the required gold for my lvl. 40 mount.
---
You need to be pretty actively trying to do something to make gold. 
---
Here's what I'll be doing differently in hopes of making a difference:
---
* Level with two gathering professions. I was tailoring/enchanting my first go-round and lost out on a lot of gold from using all my cloth and DE'ing many of my drops. 
---
* Not buy all my spells/skills. Apparently this makes a huge difference over time.
---
* Actually try to play the AH. I have a better sense for things with value now and how to make money there instead of wasting my time.
---
That dildo disarm is OP
---
I remember my guild had the same type of requirement. I hit 60 on my paladin, and was told to hit 60 fire resist even if it meant buying greens on the AH. Of course it was my first time raiding so I didn't question it at all and spent probably 10 gold on crappy gear for fire resist.
---
Looks good but honestly you're gambling trouble without at least some points in Silent Resolve.
---
I would swap the points in Mental Agility to Silent Resolve cuz nothing sucks more than pulling aggro in the middle of trying to save someone. Remember priests dont have an permanent aggro dump, Fade is only a temporary aggro reduction.
---
Addons and macros are a CORE feature of World of Warcraft and have always been part of the experience.
---
&gt;I too am a man of great **haste.**
---
I'll see myself out.
---
That's simply not true.  I'll grant that something like CTmod was basically universal for everyone that raided, but for a lot of players that was it.  There used to be a stigma against players that used things like questie.  Somewhere over the years that got lost and it became the norm.
---
I'm not suggesting raiders didn't use CTmod, I'm saying if you want a less faceroll version of classic raiding, you can always try it without addons that trivialize the encounter mechanics.
---
the beaches in desolace are pretty 🙄
---
I’m sure a lot of ppl did. Myself included
---
Seems like a lot of people have forgotten Vanilla did have tier tokens for all the set items past BWL.
---
I thought the initial respec cost was like, 50s or even 1g.  Either way, druids already require so many spell purchases throughout the leveling process, that spending more money on respeccing early is turning me off to the idea.
---
It's still possible in 1.12, just harder. You still get 3 swings with WF weapon and with the right gear and buffs + Stormstrike you can delete clothies and leather weathers with some luck.
---
Oof, this hits hard. I even made a pvp video of me clicking. My rogue class leader forced me to play combat daggers in MC and I had to learn to not click.
---
Yes but when people talk about "viable" in vanilla they're usually speaking about "optimal" as literally any class with any spec is viable. And enhance shaman is nowhere near the optimal line for raid dps.
---
I will look so fucking lame in pre-raid gear, holy shit.
---
Runs take like 15 minutes and it's a 20% chance on two seperate drops, they're easy af to get.
---
I don't get back from vacation until the 28th so I'm going to miss the initial craziness either way. At the rate I intend to play though I will probably still beat 95% of the population to 60.
---
I don't mind at all. Intra-guild drama is A-tier content.
---
Back in vanilla days I played with a ton of RL friends.  In the same raiding guild(s)  Most of my social circle were either fellow students or magic the gathering players  and the overlap with warcraft players was quite big.   Fast forward 15 years and most of us that still see each other have wives , jobs and kids and certainly not as much time anymore to play mmorpgs.   I still will meet a few of them in Azeroth, but this time we will be casuals , and if we end up playing on the same server our  warcraft lives will go in different directions.   But it will still be nice to do a dungeon run together, we don;t care if it takes us 5 months to get there.
---
What a madlad.
---
Someone stop him.
---
You don't have to join the discord to LFG, you can just use in game and if people say "you on discord?" you just type "no, I don't have voice chat" and then that's it.
---
Sure, Discord is going to have a "must have a mic" for some, but I think just having people in there to listen to the main tank and healer (can mute the rest of the dungeon group) is all you really need.
---
&gt;  If the in-game LFG channel is barren of useful groups because everyone is actually using a Discord LFG, that will kill my desire to play classic.
---
​I doubt it will be empty but you will likely have a chunk missing that only use discord.  You'll have groups that will favor Discord for LFG, but you also need to realize you're playing a classic game in a modern era.  We're dealing with discord, streamers, reddit, more integrated architecture, etc.
---
&gt; I didn't keep some list of names for good and bad players. I couldn't tell you a single name of anyone on my original server or guild. We raided, chatted a bit, and did our dungeons. "The community will blacklist ninjas and jerks" or "Everyone will know if you're a pillar of the community" is 180 degrees from my experience back then. People wanting to randomly group up and chat while questing at level 4 are just... weird.
---
If you were on the server forums in vanilla, you knew who the ninja looters were, who the jerks were.  That was the Discord/Reddit/Twitch of the day.  People grouping to quest, I don't see that as something bad.  I was grouping all the time while leveling up, mainly to share kills on a quest and then I'd carry on after that.
---
I'm not the OP but I've tried that multiple times and it doesn't really work for me.  
---
Deciding between mage or warlock and I'm okay with either result.
---
Yea at this point I would be okay with garbage memes just to help me get by
---
Makes sense if i typically disagree with a person
---
Yes!
---
Imagine wasting the counterspell cooldown on someone mounting up
---
BFA isn't WoW in the same way that Diablo III isn't Diablo.
---
Vanilla Swordsmith here. 
---
Sageblade was always a good money maker for me, but that being said most guilds prefer an axesmith because they want to make nightfall. 
---
Sword and macesmithing just don't offer that much that can't be found from somewhere else within the reasonable scope of most players. 
---
Axesmith's get guild assistance on TB rep because of the need to make nightfall. 
---
This time time around the wheel I plan to be an armorsmith.
---
I don't understand these memes. Why do pallies have easy profit?
---
Zulian Slicer
---
Not even close to the same situation. Mages can function just fine outside of raids with points in Winter's Chill. You can also request that every Mage in your raid puts at least some points in that talent to make it fair for all. This is actually preferred - the more Mages with that talent, the faster the stacks are up, and the less likely they are to drop.
---
You can't do that with the Shadow Weaving Priest. It's a job for one person and only one person.
---
Holy fuck I love you.
---
What can I say? I like to discuss things with people contradicting me and I was at work with nothing to do. You want to judge me more and insult me a bit more or are you ok now?
---
There's a big difference between intentionally misusing your keyboard and downloading software that performs actions for you or tells you what to do.

We are an up-and-coming guild quickly filling our ranks. We have extensive goals to be one of the top guilds on the server and will always be current on content. We fully expect to be ready to raid within a month from launch. We're looking for casual players as well has those as hardcore as us alike.

We're looking for players that can commit to the planned raid schedule. We will not have a "one and done" mindset in regards to missing a raid. But no less than 90% attendance is very much encouraged. And we don't just need a warm body to fill a slot on the roster. We need detail oriented players with situational awareness. And of course, someone that can work and play with a team. We don't just want people that will log in to raid and then be done. We want a community of players that get along both during a raid as well as after.

Wrong, weaponsmithing was further split into axe, hammer, and mace based on quests that started in Winterspring.
---
Sure it's good for one of your guild mates to have it but overall it's not a great profession to have.
---
Sleep is for the weak.
---
Exactly my point. I'm arguing that noone will be using FR this time around except tanks.
---
If you haven't gotten Viskag, Chromatically Tempered Sword, or Maladath, these two swords are your best option as a fury warrior or sword rogue and they are quite easy to get. Usually if you have one already the raid group will give you the other to complete your set.
---
Save literally everything you pick up and mail it to an alt. AH / Vendor everything and you will have easily enough gold for your mount.
---
Or scarlet monastery
---
That's a lot of competition. Better leveling up skinning and join the devilsaur mafia.
---
I don't remember Gurubashi or Warsong having a lot of drama...I think they ended up being taken over by BRs and Chinese gold farmers though.
---
Ha ha good one sir!
---
Yeah, actually.
---
Rogue has the most potential for customizing a build for what I want to do, but I eventually settled on 21/3/27 since I plan to use my rogue almost entirely to pickpocket/smelt/disenchant BRD runs, and to gank redridge inn.
---
My shaman I've actually decided upon a 31/7/13 build, that focuses on small group pvp and controllable burst damage.  Getting rank 8 or 12 boots is going to be critical, but no matter how hard I try, I can't get away from the utility of improved ghost wolf at 61% increased move speed.  It really does help in larger pvp fights where I need to gain serious distance, to the point of it reminds me of playing my druid in vanilla except with waaay more damage and offesive utility.
---
&gt; Repair bills when leveling is so trivial I wouldn't even considering it part of a budget plan for getting your mount.
---
Nah, you gotta do what I did when I first started playing.  Keyboard-turning with the arrow keys, and all my abilities bound to the 10-key.
---
Shaman get ghost wolf at 20 in classic
---
I think its actually a good rogue weapon, for a blue item. Decently slow, 12 AP and a nice damage proc, bonus if your a skinner and running ZG getting all those primal skins.
---
I wore these on pservers. The purple glow Is not an enchant.
---
We get that BUT we agreed that this sub should not corrupt into the mess that r/wow is, and these posts are exactly the kinda thing that turns the sub into an "LOOK WHAT I GOT COMMISIONED" and "MY BOYFRIEND SURE WILL LIKES THIS HORDE-THEMED COFFEE MUG". It's boring to see all these posts that have almost nothing to do with the actual game we are all looking forward to.
---
that guy with the bingo card really predicted what's going to happen on this sub.
---
I mean classic raiding is painfully easy. You just need people competent enough to do the mechanics and know how to gear their character.
---
Just there vendor loot is worth tons. Skinning is an added bonus. I grinded beasts from 28 to 40 multiple times and always had over 200g when I hit 40. One time I done hunter 28 to 60 just grinding beasts. Took 6.5 days played and had 1.1k gold when I dinged 60. This is all purely vendoring everything.
---
I played vanilla without add-ons, even raiding. And I played a healer.
---
It's an unfortunate side effect of an elitist community. You probably won't escape that in Classic since the core audience for this game are people who played vanilla and are still gung-ho enough about the game to still want to play today.
---
Also you can't just look at that item in a vacuum or without knowing how the player intends to play.  I agree that they reached the wrong conclusion.
---
NElf racial improved death automatically jumps to a tier 1 racial if you are a parent of a very young child.
---
Why do most people consider casual = bad. Casual just means you game less that doesnt mean you cant use your time efficiently. You can watch videos and guids even if you only play 15h per week. I dont get it. Vanilla raids are a joke.
---
They just said time playing servere. Didnt they? Not specefic pve or pvp.  Or am i Wrong?
---
Is it true that once you pick  a Blacksmithing specialization you can't get a new one, even if you relearn blacksmithing from 1-300?
---
Hence why I said "Alternatively in a seperate category"
---
Last time I checked, most of my old warcraft buddies had high paying ICT jobs.  I will tell you a secret:  smart guys who make bank have no   problem getting female attention.    Some of them have been overweight virgins at some point, that is true, but I tell you another secret, this is the Age of Nerds.  It might take them a bit longer, but they get on their feet and pick up their lives and have success.
---
I call Big McLargeHuge!

Again...that would be on a PVE server.

---
\### \[Mission Statement\]   
---
Lionheart is a newly made guild for players who are dedicated to achieving reasonable content progression without sacrificing a fun and social guild environment. Our goal is to clear all PvE content while it is current and to create a community of friends while doing it. We are not aiming for firsts, speed runs, or ranks.
---
\### \[Raid Information\]
---
Lionheart’s philosophy on raiding is simply to clear the content while it is current, and as such we are not concerned with pushing boundaries or hardcore min-maxing. Our raid times are from 9 PM to 12 AM EST on Friday, Sunday, and Tuesday. Friday and Sunday will be our progression nights, with Tuesday as a farm night as needed.
---
\### \[Loot Policy\]
---
Lionheart uses a Loot Council made up of officers to disburse loot in a manner that seeks to be fair to players while keeping the interests of the raid in mind. The decisions will generally be based on five criteria: Performance, Effort, Attitude, Group Benefit, and Recent Loot. Raiders may always request the reasoning behind a decision.
---
\### \[Member Expectations\]
---
Lionheart is seeking players who share our goal of clearing content while keeping a friendly community. The ideal member is friendly, reliable, competent, and willing to help others. For our raids, consistent attendance is required, as are basic consumables. More information can be found on our website.
---
\### \[Apply Below\]

I've just stumbled upon the Storm Gauntlets item that gives you 3 nature damage per auto. Apparently this consumed stormstrike till wotlk should comments be true. If that will be the case in classic will stormstrike be allowed in raids? Not sure how debuff slots are utilized, i.e. is there a place for a debuff that will be gone almost immediately? Windfury proc off stormstrike would consume the debuff automatically I assume. Moreover, you can use earth shock for that as well.
---
“modern problems require modern solutions”
---
The point is being able to heal in raids while being able to hop back into open world content without having to respec. Not exactly ideal from a pve raiding standpoint ofc, but that's not really the point.
---
But if I move with my mouse, how can I click on rend?
---
If you're hard pressed to never upgrade, I'd just go with the 3400G build.  I would also look if you have a Micro Center within a drive (one hour or less) from you.  They have the 2400G, which is about 7% less performance, but fine for WoW: Classic, on sale for $120 compared to the $150 for the 3400G AND you save $30 when you bundle it with a motherboard.  So you can basically get processor/motherboard for just over $160.  Plus they can help you out picking out parts.  But make sure you let them know a strict budget and don't bite on "well for just $X more you can get Y" and you should be fine. 
---
It's real easy to over build a system when you start looking at spending a bit more to get a bit more performance and before you know it you're at a $1000 PC.
---
A lot of it is cooldown/consumable timing - knowing at what point you can pop your Death Wish, Diamond Flask, Mighty Rage Pots, Juju Flurry and whatever else you might use so they overlap throughout Execute phase and as much of the rest of the fight as possible - keeping Boss mechanics in mind. This is also knowing when you can use CDs on trash and have them ready for bosses again (depending on how your guild values total DPS vs. Boss DPS). If you have a decent 2H, consider (spreadsheet) using it for multi-target fights, especially trash groups, even if you're DW.
---
For Overpower, it really depends on your gear if you should spec into it (and use it) or not. A spreadsheet can give you the correct answer, but as a rule of thumb I think for DW it's always worth it in pre-AQ gear and when at less than \~50 Rage not delaying your next BT.
---
If you are Threat limited, you can use Cleave instead of Heroic Strike to dump excess Rage. Sometimes switching to a fast MH weapon right before Execute phase increases DPS (smooth Rage generation). Know when to move into AoE/Cleave for bonus Rage.
---
There's also very situational stuff. Like, if you have time before a pull, you can get some critter to hit you to build/conserve rage and possibly proc Mark of the Chosen for you. Hardest part is getting the other warriors to not taunt/smack it.
---
As others have said somewhat correctly the rotation is very simple. 
---
If boss below health is &lt; 20% AND your attack power is less than ~2000:
---
Cast execute. 
---
Do not ever pool rage. Just execute as soon as you can. 
---
If you have more than 2000 attack power - blood thirst is your highest priority followed by execute (again just make sure you have rage to execute) 
---
Above 20%: 
---
You prioritize bloodthirst.  Your number one goal is to ALWAYS have enough rage to bloodthirst when it’s off CD. 
---
After that whirlwind on cooldown. 
---
Cast heroic strike to avoid rage capping. (Watch your aggro) 
---
If overpower procs and you have less than 45 rage AND you are not affected by flurry AND both bloodthirst and whirlwind are on CD - you can swap stance and cast over power.  You can safely ignore this shit by BWL as you’ll almost always be above 45 rage in which case it’s a dps loss to swap.
---
/flies away on a gryphon
---
Honestly it could have gone on forever
---
report them
---
Every server sure. But every realm no. 
---
If you wanna get specific.
---
99% of the time people's issues with gold in Vanilla was because they were wasting money buying shit on the AH, or were prioritizing leveling up professions. It's not bullshit.
---
If anyone is watching for this, I've also tried enlisting the whole of some photoshop skilled invidiuals.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/picrequests/comments/cjaccl/could_the_key_sticker_be_removed
---
Yeah but since there's going to be maybe 1 or 2 guilds per server chasing the optimal comp it doesn't matter to the majority of players. Let people who want to be optimal do their thing. The people who claim you can't possibly clear raids with some hybrid specs DPS'ing are just as bad as the ones insisting on bringing their shit specs in the first place. Enhance is "seriously bad" if you can field 20 fury warriors but since you can't do that in the vast majority of guilds it's fine if you don't have better options for DPS.
---
Can't wait to report
---
I remember wiping a lot in classic for really stupid reasons. Usually involving pulling a patrol as it passes the group we are pulling. 
---
Also if not everyones geared the bosses really can wipe the group
---
Keep your dick in the vise.
---
Slam is not really viable until you get into AQ40 level gear, in my opinion. You want to string 2-3 slams together without missing your BT/WW cooldowns in rotation and that is very hard to do without massive rage generation. And even then, it's not exactly an easy rotation to execute and it's even tougher on mobile fights.
---
Original warlocks are probably the eredar race, I think. Not to be that guy, I sometimes claim to be a lore nerd.
---
I did end up moving his pack and play right next to my desk when i played fallout 4.
---
Yup, I was either flicker strike or RF.
---
Just play nelf Hunter :-P
---
Just letting a guy that there is no reason in getting both. 
---
To save him the trouble.
---
My only gripe is people who think 3-sec mount cast time is too much, consumables farming is too tedious, or complain they have to grind for other faction's mount.
---
Never really got that far back in the day :P I do remember the ZG token-esque stuff now that you mention it.
---
Oh my god please that was obviously a joke! Although it's not completely untrue.
---
I remember when Lich King dropped and our server (skullcrsher) would have a 2000+ person wait list. Sometimes up to 2 hours.
---
I think they will need a lot of cloth healing gear, just like paladins.....  so they will compete with priests and druids
---
Without addons. Sure I am game for that. Without mouse macro. Not in a million years. I don’t want to return to click on screen lol.
---
&gt; a community where you make real friends
---
Yeah, within your own faction. Literally the point of the game is to be at war with the other side.
---
People will just to "LeetWarriorTTV" which is just as much and doesn't need a link.
---
Run away, little girl.  Run away.
---
I mean, the Wildhammer clan is all about their personal relationship with gryphons and their ability to fight from their backs as aerial troops, so maybe just the dearves of the Bronzebeard clan?
---
I'm rolling a mage. I'm going to whore myself out.
---
It is the same situation because it deals with the same mindset.
---
Are you actually implying that a full healing build is better outside of raids than a PI/SW priest? You do realize that they're both equally shit at dealing with world content?
---
As I said, no matter how you spin the narrative, you won't find a way to justify having a shadowpriest in the raid.
---
Oof I feel you.  Myself, I had a green chest piece until I replaced it with tier 2.
---
I have my doubts that "LFR tards" will make it past MC in raid progression much less to Cthun or Naxx. If they do make it that far, i'm sure they will have adapted by then.  Any guilds that have made it that far will have weeded them out.
---
optimal =/= viable though. And casual players are fine with viable and non optimal. Therefore there should be no problem having a few offspecs in most raids. And of course I don't mean hardcore / world first / speedrunning guild, which account for 1-5% of guilds probably. For the rest of people, it will just be a matter of having a full roster, and eventually be able to clear all raids. Several naxx bosses have been done even by non-full-consume guilds with some offspecs here and there in Vanilla.
---
Zones with low visibility. Ungoro, stv; places you can get surprised by people, mobs etc
---
If you don't think missing a white hit (don't forget the proc so 2 hits) is that important in a paladins ability to kill mobs, then you're in for a big awakening on how slow you'll kill stuff.
---
Normally with this build you would be using a 2 hander. If you want to level with 1h+shield and mobs to kill themselves on you then blessing of sanctuary is a nobrainer so you can aoegrind.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC89l2tyKKI
---
Is probably a good video to give you an idea what leveling with a 1H looks like, notice the difference when he's killing one mob or multiple.
---
Thanks, will do later tonight after work
---
Yeah but don't you see that it's even MORE important that Rag doesn't submerge a second time?
---
I think that group of people will be avoidable.  You should be able to find casual guilds that won't require consumables or raid buffs.  Having a guild min/max and breeze through content has no real effect on you, since all your raid experiences are instanced and separate.
---
It can be fun with friends. Locks of fun gimmick items in classic.
---
If you're a melee and you want to top the meters, have a fr set to switch into for imp packs, golemagg, and geddon. While everyone else is sitting on their thumbs you're still smashing away. Totally unnecessary, even a hindrance on imp packs and geddon, but you'll be top dps for the run assuming you're keeping up everywhere else. I've seen warriors with arcane resist sets for shazz too.  
---
Having that set will be really nice when you get to vael too. You'll be threat capped as mdps anyway, so you can alleviate some healing pressure without hurting your dps at all.
---
I laughed so hard that I literally coughed up my lungs and now they lie on the floor hanging out of my throat.
---
I was casual for the whole vanilla.....and casual ever since:) one might piss off ppl with being causal but the good thing about casual is that you don’t really read anything anyone write to you;)
---
this is amazing lmao
---
At the time the original iteration of WoW was very casual, it was made to be more beginner friendly than the current MMO's of the time.  Since then the genre has become so watered down that some will consider Classic a "hard core" mmo, but in reality it's very noob friendly.
---
My strategy of "play a warlock" gets me a mount at 40 every time :)
---
I've played on pservers a lot, and I know there will be a divide between those who are playing the game for the first time and those who have been playing it for years. Just because you've done a quest 50 times doesn't mean you should be a jerk to someone who needs help with an "easy" quest.
---
IF leveling as a duo, i always recommend the paladin level as prot.  Not only can they tank a few mobs at a time, but a large portion of their damage comes from reflected damage (blessing of sanctuary, retribution aura, and a shield spike; if a blacksmith).  Ret can have little down time, but the damage is most from auto attacks, and that can make things difficult when leveling as a pair.
---
god, i raided ZG twice a week every week for 10 months so i could get both of these for my fury warrior
---
worth it idc
---
back in vanilla i thought addons would get you banned
---
“woah just take it easy man “
---
but, macros and the blizzard API were in the game from the start. there is no wrong or right way to play.  The devs designed the game to give you all this information through an API. They could have not. 
---
I’m not against ya man. Just commenting and joking around waiting for classic.
---
You can still hotkey most actions so you don't have to click.  Not using a macro would just mean you have to press more than one key/don't get to press one button to perform multiple actions in sequence.
---
Wow classic won't be very demanding at all I reckon most if not all £300-400 pcs would be able to handle it 😁 just look for a half decent CPU, 8gb ram would probably fine and just a mid range graphics card, you'll run it just fine
---
I'm pretty sure they all came out of AQ. 
---
I know the improved rank sunder came out of there.
---
But you're also losing PI
---
No, I think he wanted a elaboration on why you didn't like the music...
---
Forgot about shimmering flats. One of my first exposure to alliance. Nowhere to hide either.
---
Thank god
---
All my friends are dead
---
That is how it was yes. What's done is done. Unlike engineering.
---
Can't wait for UBRS
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA LITERALLY FUNNY
---
So without the Rekbomb to level, is Rek still good to level or should one just go deep ret to level?
---
D1.
---
I will be focusing on two characters, but I have a full roster of alts (Go spreadsheets!) that I will play to around level 35 for crafting related reasons.
---
&gt;I will log in for the session with the expressed purpose of running that dungeon. Ill be tanking and my wife healing, so we just need 3 dps and were golden.
---
Compared to current retail its not casual friendly.
---
In 2005 wow was considered very casual friendly.  
---
In PVP you need a bit of gear and it is VERY hard to get the pvp reward gear, next to impossible as casual player.    If you enter the battlegrounds in greens and blue dungeon gear, you will be easily overpowered by players in epic PVE gear, because in vanilla the difference between pve and pvp gear was not very noticeable and many PVE gear pieces made excellent PVP gear.
---
But skill and teamwork can overcome some egar difference, if you pvp in a pre made team, you can still wipe the floor with casual pve  people in better gear,.
---
Yeah MH is 110 top end. 
---
Weapon speed is really only informative in the context of item level. If I had a sword that had 200 top end and 2.8 speed, and another better sword that did 200 top end and had 2.0 speed...I’m taking the faster one every time. 
---
It’s really top end damage you’re concerned with on the main hand. The offhand wants a fast one for more swings and more chances to proc your enchant/poison. 
---
Dalrends has 151 top end.
---
Doing 41 more per hit on every instant Yellow ability... ohya
---
At least that’s how I understand it to be for rogues.
---
My guild raid leader had a rule stating you could come and raid but if you didn’t have CTmod/raid installed you would not be able to receive loot.
---
If one side has queues, the other faction will have instant queues.
---
A sound plan
---
completed. interesting stuff. looking forward to the results
---
I will also be playing one handed, but it’s not a baby I will have in my master hand;)
---
I got $40 on it if someone starts a GoFundMe or whatever
---
This really is the only way to ever prove some sort of a point. One raid with the meta optimal comp of 20 warriors, one raid that is just pure memeing and with the same level of worldbuff/consumes coverage.
---
For horde it's that snake dungeon around lvl 20 in the night elf coast zone place
---
Do you think one should go deep ret to level? Since rek is less consistent now?
---
Leaving for a month long trip to Japan on release day.
---
Haha my inbox is alright, it wasn't shredded to pieces by the waves of guys :)
---
MM &gt; ALL
---
&gt;I'm not sure if this addon already exists for retail (hopefully it does!) but I'd love to have something that's able to tell me my session &amp; lifetime stats for pickpocketing, something I can keep up with through my entire WoW Classic career. 
---
Dude, sign me up. I would love a little tracker telling my lifetime gold value pickpocketed, or a "tetris sidebar" style type and number of items pick pocketed.
---
fuckin Joey whats his nuts always causing trouble...
---
Sorry, maybe I came off more enthusiastic than I intended.  I agree with you.  However I imagine from a game design philosophy standpoint they built the game to be playable without the use of addons.  All I'm saying is that the people worried about the game being too easy have a very simple option to increase the difficulty.
---
Playing a Paladin then?
---
i actually didn't use addons from vanilla till Wotlk haha. (in wotlk i got a dps meter and a timer for battlegrounds)
---
i much prefer the idea of 1.13 than them releasing BC. Sure there could be some crossover (for instance Kara being originally planned for classic) but i think that releasing BC again just opens the can of worms that will eventually lead to blizz rereleasing all of the xpacks.
---
Thanks, very helpful, will checkout video too
---
you crazy
---
People will be dying - a lot
---
It was all fun and games until you became a SrA and starting getting actual responsibilities.

I agree, but the video is clearly trying to compare with optimal specs, which just won't ever happen.
---
Why doesn't it work?
---
* We have a game with a set of rules that state that you can attack at anytime. (this is ok to attack)
---
* We have a case where people hold an event of a deep significance out of the game. (this is not ok to attack)
---
* People attacking are aware of the situation (so it's not an honest mistake)
---
Therefore you have a moral dilemna: do you put the rules of the game before the rules of the moral decency out of the game?
---
Trust me.  I went that way in Classic.  I know what will happen.  GLstaying Enhance when you have a massive problem finding healers.
---
I've played male characters in MMOs (I'm female), in part because I preferred the way they looked compared to the overly sexualized females. And in part because it's an easier way to meet people that want to be your friend for you, and not for your gender. I might roll a male troll for classic haha! The females look weird to me..
---
This is one of my favorite videos of all time.
---
Repair bills when leveling is so trivial I wouldn't even considering it part of a budget plan for getting your mount
---
I explained exactly how that situation is different. And yes, Priests that talent for healing are better at everything than healers with Shadow Weaving. PvP, 5 mans, 20 mans, farming gold in groups. It's just a bad build for anything other than 40-man raids with multiple Warlocks.
---
I am one of those ppl that can’t use hot keys at all. So I clicked until I got myself a razor hex with 6 side buttons. So I pretty much need macros hehe
---
Ignore that link. Those builds are pretty dumb.
---
Druids are vastly superior flag carriers.
---
unless they prefer boys, I am certain they have seen plenty of naked girls... isn't that what the internet was made for?
---

---
&gt;Vendor everything you can.
---
Oh well, if someone on reddit says so. Here bread merchant, hows about a Warden Staff for 3g 4s? I guess that's as much as I can get for it.

---
Im going to heal, its what i enjoy most, and people love me for it
---
or at least until one tiny thing goes wrong then everything is my fault and I should kill myself because i fucking suck
---
oh a healers life lol
---
Ahhhh karazhan.
---
lol yeah. It wasn't till TBC till I was able to equip an epic in every slot. The tokens made things a little easier to pick up a tier piece.
---
But yeah...in 2 years of running MC/BWL/AQ/ZG I only saw a Perditions Blade (sad story) drop one time, and the literal only other dagger I've ever seen drop was the gutgore ripper and I literally passed on it because "I'll get something better soon and it will be a wiser investment of DKP". lol.
---
“Meeting stones” but being summoning stones
---
Gear requirements in Classic are actually pretty low. The gap from T1 to T3 is *literally* 20ilvl and virtually no gear is particularly well itemized until AQ40.
---
You also had to wear resistance gear on a few fights. Sapphiron is going to require killing enough stuff in Naxx to gather materials to craft gear, not particularly good gear. Even 4HM is more about buying Titan flasks than having good gear... 2 of them hit for virtually nothing, and the third you get killed by a Meteor, not melee damage.
---
Knowing how fights work and having a good strategy will always be more important than anything else in Classic. There are like 4 DPS check bosses in the whole game, and 3 of them are in Naxx where you should have enough purple items on players by then to where it doesn't matter.
---
IT's actualy a terrible idea, he'll be so far behind that nobody will want to take him to raid.
---
If the mods think it shouldn't be on this subreddit, then they're welcome to take it down.
---
And I don't mean that grumpily or anything; I do genuinely mean it.
---
players asked about it and they said that they meant RP-PVE and they will include RR-PVP at later date, maybe. :(
---
Do you think it's possible to run raids without Arcane Meditation and/or Frost Channeling without being liability? Not quipping, genuinely wondering.
---
I know, SW is just easier to make fun of.
---
Yes, I'm glad you also read the part where I said "disregard all logic and common sense"
---
Possible...
---

---
Thanks for the reminder!
---
Only daggers to be sheathed on the back. They were daggers that looked like swords.
---
I wanted to go PVE alliance and make a human warrior. Literally, ALL of my friends want to go horde pvp, so, im going Orc warrior.
---
Clearly you're not grasping the actual argument.
---
Also, yes, since OP outlines SPECIFICALLY a scenario with MULTIPLE WARLOCKS, this is the best choice by far.
---
Do you not read the OP when you post or?
---
Ok... doesn't really change much.  You don't reward meme specs by giving away super valuable items.  Getting a raid slot as a meme spec is your reward.  I guess I always figured HoR was more common than the orange item name would indicate due to the ammount you see walking through oggrimmar on a mature server, but I suppose that is just selection bias.
---
Which is relatively unobtrusive. If they're not advertising their stream  and simply have it in their name, it's honestly reasonable. As long as it's not an RP realm.
---
Don’t have to buy a mount, same with warlock.
---
Do you like being in high demand, after tanks?  Do you want all of the blame, but none of the glory?
---
Then healing may be right for you!
---
Stop buying skills at lvl 20, only buy key upgrades like a new sinister strike.
---
Don’t worry, dwarfs are the cool bros on the opposing team you can respect. Gnomes, humans and nelfs are kind the douches.
---
Then you write there name down on a list and several months later kick them out of your UBRS group like “shouldn’t have stolen that Tin Vein my friend..”
---
\___________________________________________________________________________________________

THANKS FOR THE HELP WITH MY POLL FELLAS, SULELE WILL BE PLAYING WITH US.
---
More important, is there an addon that counts nelf salti in a row?
---
I just noticed for the first time that the person posting about the memorial event has the title "Drama Whore"
---
I think you're the one missing the substance of my posts :)
---
6pm on the 26th feels more like 27th release tbh last quarter of the day
---
I was always the warlock. This changes everything.
---
Winterspring rep.
---
There should be less raid drama.
---
The average player age will be older. And most people coming back are more experienced.
---
longest day of your life
---
In a vanilla raid everyone must pay attention, any damaging ability can one shot most classes or debuffs such as 100% healing debuff or a poison that if it tics all the way down can kill your entire raid. In LFR non of that happens, you can stand in the bad and not die the entire time its doing damage, healers do not go oom, dps never goes oom, only 5-6 people need to know the mechanics and a portion could even afk and clear it. In vanilla everyone had to at the very least participate on the simple mechanics to kill the boss unlike LFR.
---
Ehh.. bossmods became commen pretty quickly even in the most basic form for any serious raiding guild.
---
People dont forget
---
I can't wait to purge slowfalls when people jump from there. If it does till them at the very least I'll burn a reagent.
---
Just dance on mailboxes
---
A sense of pride and accomplishment.
---
gotta keep it petty as fuck
---
Yay
---
Same thing happened to me; got deployed during TBC, came home, missed all of WotLK launch and was suddenly alone.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/spell-books
---
Needlessly complex. It's pretty simple math.
---
A Heal or GHeal has a 2.5s cast time (given the right talents). One tick is 2s. So you're getting one a full tick of additional mana, while with casting Gheal you are only getting a partial tick of additonal mana due to the 15% casting regeneration talent. Just include this in your HPM calculations
---
I made a level 60 priest on a PServer und used the Theorycraft Addon to get some numbers. (the addon has presets for tier 0,5 to tier 3 sets).  With a Tier 1 set, Renew actually does end up being slightly more efficient than GHeal R1 once you factor in the additonal tick of regeneration (which is about 80 mana / tick).
---
The problem is: this benefit is reversed if you have to cast again before you get that additional tick, i.e. 5 seconds rule.
---
So sometimes you will be slightly more efficient, sometimes quite a bit less efficient. So overall, speaking stricktly in terms of efficiency, it's probably a wash. At best. There might be other reasons why it might be a good idea to hit the tank with a Renew after a big heal, though.
---
I'll be using a Naga as well, awesome shirt btw dude
---
Dwarves and Orcs were the min/max PvP Rogue choice.
---
Orcs sun resist gives you a huge leg up on your worst matchups (warrior, paladins, and other rogues). Plus a DPS burst for finishing.
---
Dwarf gave you the only blind and bleed removal in the game (along with some armor) which let you much more reliably complete stealth and vanish rotations. Their highest base stamina was a nice bonus too.
---
Healing is the best.  You don't have to min/max your character, so it's great for lazy players as well.
---
&gt;  Took 6.5 days played and had 1.1k gold when I dinged 60
---
Damn dude.
---
Appreciate the info.
---
Right?  It would be fantastic if you could also export the items pickpocketed data to an excel sheet!
---
airstrip above Ironforge
---
Hi, /u/Gurokaze
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cje2h6/which_white_items_usually_sell_for_more_on_ah/). 
---
They all came out with AQ, but not all drop within AQ20. Eviscerate one is from UBRS, I believe, and there are others.
---
Haha yea
---
I haven't played WoW for real since 2006 (did dabble with WotLK in 2010 for a few weeks - but only the same early game content as usual). Please humor me, but what happened that would make IronForge be empty?
---
Lol you sound like way too whiney of a bitch to be playing any online video game, let alone WoW.
---
Most did, but some were earlier like the mage water from dire maul, and the group buffs like fort, gift of the wild, etc were also book drops. 
---
But im not aware of a master list anywhere.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?items=9.0
---
welll then throw a coin if you cant decide. or play whatever youor guild needs more
---
This is just speculation but I feel like greens wont be worth much more than vendor value in the beginning since everyone will be very strapped for cash. The move seems to be either mail everything and unload it in a month or so, or just vendor it right away. Maybe Im wrong and Greens will be a early cash cow, but i doubt it.
---
for the latter half of legion i pvp'ed exclusively on my demon hunter, and, for those who don't know, at that time you would get a template with pre-determined stats when you entered a battleground. the amount of stats you got depended on how high your ilvl was.
---
i would get new gear and equip it right away. i didn't care what stats it had, i didn't know what stats i needed to focus on as a demon hunter... and i didn't need to know or care. it literally didn't matter. that's crazy to me.
---
Well at least there won't be any guild banks for them to raid then quit.
---
It's only 15% from Meditation.
---
We are the new r/wow
---
DM me if you want more info.
---
That sounds a bit drastic
---
"Check out My Twitch, Bro"  
---
 is the new   
---
"Check out my Mixtape, Bra"
---
This was how all the raiding content went for my guild in vanilla, and looking back, it was great. Wiping for hours about 3 to 4 nights every week on whatever we were working to progressing on, it really made getting the items feel so rewarding.
---
Classic will be fun but I bet that sense of struggle won't be anything like it was, but hopefully it won't be any less rewarding.
---
Late to the thread, but I'm an orc lock in vanilla. At 60, I would like to run a spec that actually uses a pet. I don't like the idea of sacrificing a pet. Is there a viable pet-using spec or will I have to kill my fren?
---
I feel it's more obtrusive.  They're name and knowing TTV is them broadcasting twitch.  Anything they say, LFG, trade, general chat.  Doesn't have to be "hey, follow me on twitch" but their name itself is telling you to go to their twitch channel.  IMO, I'd rather they spam chat, because I can ignore them and not recognize the name with TTV at the end.
---
Cut her some slack, probably just a retail tourist...
---
Going orc warrior, was debating on going human warrior but I don't think I'd miss the horde too much. I'll probably make a human paladin though as an alt. Protection paladin is one of my favorite PvE specs.
---
But then if you do any of those things you're an elitist tryhard.
---
Everyone worse than me is a noob, everyone better than me is a hacker or loser with no life.
---
I'm just gonna play while omegashitfaced.
---
I have played all healers in game and plan to have one alt that I will also level to 60 besides my long standing main Warlock.  That alt will be a Priest and will definitely be a healer as I found healing in RBGs and older expansions fun.
---
It's not great and it not terrible, worth buying if you see it on sale if you don't like it you can always give it away.
---
Yea for greens, vendoring is usually the way to go, especially at lower levels. White items that players need for professions and whatnot may be worth putting on the AH though. Still gotta do your research (addon assisted!) on each item to know if it's worth it.
---
I DON'T HAVE AS MUCH TIME AS I USED TOO SO I NEED TO LEVEL AS FAST AS I CAN WITH MY LIMITED TIME.
---
Your survey seems pretty flawed...
---
I'm currently waiting to play WoW Classic again, and have a history of playing MMOs, but I'm not "currently" playing anything, which makes a lot of the questions non-applicable with no option of zero.
---
Additionally, WildStar closed down like 2 years ago. If you're accounting for private servers, you're missing a *ton* of old MMOs.
---
We should deliver a loot box with a sticky note that says: looking forward to playing the the game before Activision.
---
Thiccmacrunfast ahahahaha
---
Lol until there's a wipe and they wonder why you're using a PvP trinket.   xD
---
Sure it's useful. I just would not specifically stack it to the detriment of INT, at least if you want to do some dungeon healing. Strickly for grinding for exp? Yeah, you can go batshit with the SPI.
---
Some specs not being viable, I shall miss you feral.
---
as I said ou are refusing to consider that it can be more complex than you basic notion of horde against alliance and since you’re starting to get insulting I stop the discussion
---
Elwyn forest. Although I wont experience it this time since im rolling horde
---
You will still have a fraction of the melee's dps man. World buffs or not.
---
Ranged Taunt
---
😂
---
No one buys shit on ah leveling up.
---
It may have been more popular with Alliance players because late game rage generation may have been more linear when compared to Horde's windfury rage generating insanity. I could see why bursty and less predictable rage generation would cause a slam rotation to be difficult.
---
Hold up...
---
How to players plan to have that for week 1-2 rag clears like everyone is saying will happen. At least for those really dedicated players, but it all just feels like nigh impossible to me.
---
that's... awesome!
---
To add, I've had some badass palis as tanks in 5 man's while I was healing. They took less dmg then a warrior, kept aggro on multiple mobs while the mage and lock aoe'd and did more dps. Only issue is Mana breaks but it's not horrible.
---
Congratulations! A future party member in the making.
---
I /played 20 hours in beta and I can confidently say very little
---
That's a fair point, and I'm completely subscribed to using the off-hand. But the spice just isn't quite as caliente without having both crossed on your back.
---
Please flag NSFW content.
---
"prove all the naysayers wrong"
---
....congratulations, you found a guild willing to carry your subpar memespec through Naxx, and you spend 12 hours a day PvPing on it.
---
Okay? That doesn't change anything, it's still a meme spec.
---
At launch there won’t be much of an AH, and since everyone is going to be poor, nothing will be listed for much. Not buying all skills and leveling professions (*not enchanting*) should be plenty.
---
I never once used addons or macros from Vanilla 'till I quit in MoP.
---
That’s what makes it special, 1000’s BG, 100 or so hit R11 and first phase will see 6-7 R14’s in Phase 2 - Early Phase 3.
---
Faerie fire is a skill that can be used on range. Well that's how I understood your question anyways.
---
My wife's son hates to see this kind of negativity.
---
what quest is this in reference to?
---
If blizzard changes the way atm speed works, it will be even worse.
---
Hey my name is Tom, I am a player from the UK looking for a EU Horde raiding guild  (on a pvp server)  that speaks english would prefer to find a guild with majority from the UK.
---
I will be rolling a Orc Shaman and taking herbalism/alchemy.
---
Ive raided mc,bwl,zg, aq20 and start of aq40 on a rogue during vanila.
---
Ive played a priest in wotlk, a druid in MOP and a shaman in WOD and raided LFR with all 3 so have a good understanding of how to play a healer
---
Ive spent the last few months doing research into the shaman class and i am a quick learner who is not new to wow
---
I will be taking 2 weeks off work at launch to get a head of the curve however after that will probably be able to raid monday to thursday and sunday from 7pm-11pm (gmt) max as i have early starts. Fridays and Saturdays are a possibility if not busy
---
Im looking for a fairly serious guild but not one that expects you to drop your life for a game as lets be honest now we are all adults with responsibilities and no way will i put a game above a social/ work life 
---
Im looking to raid maybe 2-3 times a week and do group pvp
---
Would be good to find a guild with like minded individuals with good banter and just level up and help each other as we get to 60
---
I mean, there's solo-farming Barman for pre-raid, right? Plus, I'm like 90% certain I'll be pvp focused, and daggers is 100% what I wanna roll with that, I'll eat being a little more under-geared to stay that way, if it comes down to it.
---
And then get called an incompetent cockhole for fucking up on something so "easy".
---
P.S.  addons were around from essentially the beginning.
---
**something happens in anonymous online game**
---
You: "well, akchtually, if you were playing tag with little susie and she was told she has cooties, you wouldn't still tag her would you? there are times you should pause. I'm so SMRT"
---
Has nothing to do with thinking past horde and alliance. You are being purposely dense. Should have just said to fund a sense of humor. That would solve this whole dilemma for you
---
Really?
---
Your wife and her boyfriend?? Confused.
---
Super late, but here's the answer: no, drain soul does not need to last hit. Any of your abilities can finish off the mob and it will still count. That said, *your* abilities have to do it, so it's got limited utility in a group/dungeon setting.
---
No dual spec
---
atm speed?
---
If you're going to get frustrated by something that small, that is what the ignore function is for. Not being snarky, that's a good opportunity for you to use it, as 99% of people won't care.
---
There is plenty of +Fire resist on gear, UBRS has 4 item just that instance, then you have enchants for a total of 50+. then 3 good trinkets with 15+ each.  
---
Before Dark Iron, HP is the issue, not getting the +fire resistance
---
This annoyed me too at first thought, but now I'm liking the idea better. It will make you value your spec more and make the best of it, and you'll get better at your role. You can't easily perform two roles optimally anymore, so it even encourages the idea of rolling two of the same class (which I plan to do eventually).
---
Paladins are better 5 man tanks than warriors. Take your downvote and go away
---
Darkshire in Duskwood. Love the eerie atmosphere.
---
**Benevolent Elephants**. US, Alliance, PvP Server, PST based Semi-Hardcore Casual Guild.
---
Our Plan:
---
* To raid in a Semi-Hardcore Casual way. What does that mean? Casual number of raid nights and length of raids. But hardcore when inside the raid. Progression is the number one goal.
---
* To build a quality team of like-minded gamers interested in everything Classic WoW.
---
* Progression Raiding, 5 mans, and some optional PvP.
---
* We plan to clear every raid in Classic, including Naxx long term. Given the mixed style of casual and hardcore, we don’t plan on being world/server first, and that is ok!
---
About Us:
---
* Goal-driven mature gamers. 
---
* We love gaming and enjoy accomplishing our goals with friends.
---
* Many of us play nightly while others play casually.
---
* We understand real life/gaming balance and work with all our members to ensure everyone has a place.
---
* We are parents, workers, family members, and of course, gamers.
---
* Experienced leadership with successful raid experience from vanilla, to current high end Mythic raiding.​
---
Who we want:
---
* Mature gamers driven by a passion to succeed.
---
* Gamers who want to clear content in a timely manner in a non-toxic environment alongside other laid-back adult gamers.
---
* Members willing to put real effort into their class/role and work to be the best they can be.
---
* Members who understand real life constraints, yet still desire to clear content.
---
* Members who respect and appreciate other people’s time by being Punctual, Prepared, and Motivated.
---
* Casual Members/PvPers/Non-A team raiders are always welcome. Likely to form a “B Team” more casual raid group.
---
Goals:
---
* Kill all the bosses, with a core group of “A Team” Raiders.
---
* Make new friends.
---
* Make LOTS of new memories and relive some past ones.
---
Secondary Goals:
---
* Build a successful pvp team during non-raid nights. (Optional)
---
* Build a “B team” raid group that is more casual once inside the raid(think little to no consumes required)
---
The Important Info:
---
* Raid Nights: Tuesdays and Wednesdays (With a possible Optional 3rd night being added once AQ drops, to be discussed with guild when the time comes.)
---
* Times: 8pm to 11pm Pacific time
---
* Faction: Alliance
---
* Server: PvP
---
* Voice: Discord
---
* Loot: EPGP with LC oversight for at least a few months to see how much the guild and the leadership like it. If EPGP is deemed to be not good. We will use Loot Council instead, decisions made public in a member read only discord page, to help transparency. Or publicly in the main discord voice channel. Exact details on the transparency to be fine tuned over time.

Good to hear. I like it better the other way round 👌

Hopefully I don’t come off as a snob here... Purdue, VT, KSU, very commendable schools. MIT, different level all together, I certainly did not go to MIT. Just saying, the curriculum is one thing  the extra curricular project work you do after lecture is another entirely.

What have i told you about stick tape?

He is alliance, so he happily lets his wife fuck other men.

Yeah, but, for me, hemo just isn't as fun. I wanna stab some motherfuckers XD.

In organized BG's, most of the time the battle is won or lost by the quality and number of the healers.
---
I love to DPS but find healing in pvp to have the highest skill ceiling, which translates into fun for me.

Your raid leader let's you use a Lobotomizer in raids?

If I recall correctly, devouring plague was an undead priest's racial bonus.

---
&gt;It's not a private server macro. It's a 1.12 macro. 
---
And where exactly can you use a 1.12 macro today? Only on a private server.
---
Did you just reply to say *"Well, 13 years ago you could use this macro!"* What would be the point. That just makes you even more incompetent because then you're willingly spreading literally useless information. You're grasping at straws and you know it. 
---
&gt;"For the record I don't know if that type of macro works"
---
YOU wrote that. YOU wanted your incompetence to be on the record.
---
But when you KNOW you might be wrong, why don't you just let one of the other 156000 people respond? And when you realise you were wrong, why do you keep arguing that you were right?
---
No need, put baby on desk and rest keyboard on top of baby.
---
Everyone wins!
---
Oh right i see. A beta male basically.
---
Dungeons are the best xp if you have a coordinated 5 man group with a dungeon farming comp. They're definitely not worth it for the solo leveler who has to sit in trade /general to find a group of pugs that will complete the dungeon inefficiently.
---
I had all 8 pieces of the Judgement set on my paladin.  My greatest fear about classic is not being able to do the same again.  Then I tell myself that if I could do it at 15 years old, surely I can do it now.  There should be WAY more guilds actually capable of running end game content considering its been around for 15 years, right?
---
I'm fairly certain they'll be in at launch.
---
This is my favorite comment ever
---
The very definition of a rebel without a clue.
---
Edited.  Haste change
---
Ppl downvoting u are jokes
---
Wait until she’s old enough to push the PC power button. 
---
I would be in a heated battle in SC2: WoL and all of a sudden the game closes and the shutting down screen appears. 
---
After a few times of that, I learned to change the power settings, press power button = nothing
---
Since it’ll be a few weeks for the masses to hit 40, saving greens and blues that are actually good (of the monkey, of strength, of attack power, etc) and listing them once you hit 38-40 should yield more gold than vendoring them ASAP. That will take up a lot of space, and you’d need an alt, but listing a green for 15 silver is way better than vendoring it for 2 silver 38 copper haha
---
In the late 30s you can grind jaguars in Swamp of Sorrows, they commonly drop items that vendor for 8 silver each, also you can grab some nice herbs in the area (fadeleaf, blindweed)

Circle of Shadows \_ Alliance US PVE \_ Friends/Raiding
---
Circle of Shadows is a casual raiding guild, that plans to raid on Sunday and Monday from 7PM E.S.T until 12AM. We played together since The burning crusade, and have a lot of experienced raiders in our core group and are looking to recruit even more people willing to work together to bring down the bosses of molten core, to naxxaramas.
---
We plan to be raiding within 3-5 months after launch, we will be running dungeons and doing group questing together the entire time to 60 so rest assured you will have help leveling. Our primary goal is to have a relaxed raiding atmosphere where everyone who attends consistently with a good attitude is rewarded with a satisfying raid experience.
---
Loot will be handled by a council of Guild leader, Raid leader and Officers based on the players attendance, attitude, and performance. We are currently recruiting for people willing to fill officer and leadership roles please join us at our discord server [https://discord.gg/mJjSfht](https://discord.gg/mJjSfht)
---
Hahaha haha sure buddy.
---
I feel bad for all the people who fall for your lies and have to reroll at 60
---
I was in the Crossroads at the time. Same infernals and such. Best memory is /spit and having the infernal turn to me and squash me like a bug.
---
Good times.
---
Nawh you gotta MC them near a portal they can use and send them packing.
---
Still hilarious when you GY camp a premade, stagger them and slowly "AFK" out the healers and FCs.
---
Should be awesome! Brings back a bunch of good memories. Looking forward to tuning in! Thank you!
---
No, Paladins can’t tank properly, they don’t have a taunt, they have awful mana consumption. You will drink after every pull. All of they gear you will acquire to ya Jp properly will be warrior gear with no +int. 
---
Paladins are Healers and meme spec ret no exceptions.
---
Well, you can report them like another said.  Racist comments are reportable.  As far as 'snowflakes', yes, there are definitely more of those these days.
---
My job lets me work from home 3 days per week.  My productivity is about to tank.
---
Vanilla is the most casual version of WoW.
---
People bitching about min/maxing when they aren’t gonna join a guild that does anyways.
---
interesting! ty for the info. the reason i asked was bc i don't plan to raid on that alt, so i was like... can i even do pvp on this toon or do i just hit like a wet noodle? so that's good to hear
---
It's all about calling in reinforcements and dungeon grinds my friend
---
Oh God. I'm cringing. Fuck.
---
There are probably less than ten pulls in vanilla dungeons that you need dps for (counting stuff like rend event and abom event as a 'pull'). CC yes, DPS no.
---
Spoiler for next expansion, new alliance race: borbs, new class: fairy
---
Having played a few priv servers it seems this is a big mentality of most of the players who play them.. you can even see it here on reddit. People thinking you can't raid as a Ret or thinking you can't tank as a druid or prot pally in raids.. you can fucking do all of that shit... sure it's not as effective and sure some guilds won't take you but people forget just how easy classic raids are compared to live.. every casual guild who has 40 players will clear all the pve content. play whatever the fuck you want and do whatever the fuck you want and have fun!
---
If nothing else it means you had skills
---
But what if the cake actually looks amazing and not like the usual trash?
---
I'm actually curious about whether the Arcanite Champion gets used more in Classic. In the original vanilla launch one of the reasons the Arcanite Reaper was so popular was the 3.8 attack speed compared to the Arcanite Champion's 3.0 attack speed. At launch we did not have weapon speed normalization on attacks, but Classic will have that normalization for it's entirety. I suspect the Reaper will still be the go to for PVP and horde players with access to Windfury Weapon/Totem, but I wonder if those crazy PVE arms warriors or ret paladins will find the Champion is better dps.
---
Sell my stout, muscular Dwarf body to some Night Elf hussies at the Lion's Pride Inn in Goldshire.
---
This guy vaxxes.
---
I did pretty well. But I also leveled to 60 as a holy priest cause I didn't really know what I was doing lol
---
sword? Oh, you mean the Azuresong Mageblade off of Golemagg .. Armor? You mean my robe? .. Than yes, I will dust them off
---
The only other 2 swords that had the cross on your back was the felsteel longblades in tbc and those were dumb expensive, as far as I can remember.  Nothing made you feel more badass than having those swords crossed on your back
---
Worst maintainers of the community? The funeral crash was an amazing part of the community and if you don't see that keep playing BFA please.
---
The black saber was my 13 y/o selfs mount of choice. This time around I'll be going for the more sophisticated black ram.
---
Yeah it's so weird. I never even knew that bosses had debuff limits literally until I started coming to this sub like a few years ago. I remember always thinking it was just my UI not showing every debuff. 
---
It makes me wonder if anyone knew lol. We still cleared up to twin emps in AQ 40 *shrug*
---
Hybrid lock. Nightfall/Demonic sac/Imp firebolt.

---
Buddy, you won't even have to get on someone's Discord to hear their obnoxious open mic. It's got voice chat built in!
---
Summoning stones were just as bad.  Don't let them be used please Blizzard.  All they did was make others lazy as hell.  It still takes more than one person at the summoning stone to summon the others and you will ALWAYS have that lazy person not even attempt to run there but wait for a summons.  This just breads resentment.
---
Doesn't change my point.
---

How long is the mount cast time on retail and when was it reduced?
---
One more person to stream snipe
---
It might be 1g first time, not 1s, idr. But it's not even close to 50g first pop.
---
damn bro. she cheatin' with that tauren dick
---
What do you mean "throws you back?" That's just insulting.
---
I have gotten rank 13 twice on private servers, honestly the timeline will be interesting, if I try again or not will depend on how long the only wpvp phase goes for. I am prepared to slam about 18 weeks of wsg but camping IF all day is boring

**&lt;Suboptimal&gt; - Horde | NA-PvP | Hardcore**
---
&lt;Suboptimal&gt; is a hardcore raiding guild seeking players dedicated to both PvP and PvE. 
---
**Schedule:** Split Raids (Sunday 12 PM EST semi hardcore/casual) (Tuesday/Thursday 7:30-10:30 PM EST Hardcore)
---
**Introduction:** We are a small guild coming over from the private server scene, that plans on being hardcore PvPers through the first few raids, and hardcore PvEers through AQ and Naxx. We have a dedicated group of officers and GMs that have all have years of raiding and pvping experience in Classic. We love really good players and new players that have a lot of drive.
---
**PvE Plans:** Suboptimal is looking for neckbeards and social players to join our ranks. We are a guild dedicated to promoting a chill atmosphere while still crushing all of the content. We plan on downing rag in the 3rd or 4th week, downing Nef in the first week, everything in aq(maybe not C'thun) in the first week, and progressing through Naxx at our own pace for fun! If this style of guild interest you please hit us up.
---
**PvP Plans:** With ranking coming out in phase two, we are going to be running a bunch of PvP specs through MC/BWL while still clearing it. Almost all of our officers and many of our core members plan on ranking between 10-14 and all plan to do it before AQ comes out, where the guild will shift more towards a PvE focus, but if you are a hardcore PvPer and like to win, you are going to want to be a part of our premades.
---
**Expectations:** We will have different ranks with different expectations, if you are a raider or a core raider, we expect you to show up consumed and know your rotation curses ect which will be assigned from your class officer. As a member of the guild we have some guidelines laid out, but pretty much just don't be a jerk. 
---
**Discord:** We are going to run everything through discord to keep it super simple for our raiders and PvPers alike, so no digging through or signing up for websites and all of that.
---
Thank you and we hope to hear from you soon!
---

---
They very much do. At least if it's cheap and has a relevant suffix for its kind.
---
As for time, the 10 minutes it'll take me to empty my mailbox and walk over to the AH and putting up auctions is worth the investment, I should think. I plan to log onto my bank alt once at level 20, 30 and every 5 levels after that, meaning I'm spending a little over an hour putting stuff on AH. IDK where you're vendoring stuff that there isn't a mailbox right next to it, but I'll be vendoring in town anyway, so that's not a time sink of any appreciable scale.
---
Given that I can't take time off of school to nolife it, that time will be a drop in the bucket of my push to 60.
---
It's not incompetence to clearly describe if you aren't 100% sure about something. It's literally the opposite.
---
Yes I did say 13 years ago you could, because this is a remake of a 13 year old game. Not really a difficult concept but somehow it eludes you.
---
Early on, greens easily sell for double their vendor value just using chat for the area you are at. Make sure any potential buyers know where you are at because spending 20m running to a quest hub and back can make it not worth it.
---
This is exactly how a lot of people already played Vanilla! That's not a "current gamer mentality". It's literally the oldest gamer mentality going all the way back to AD&amp;D. Just because you were an ignorant kid in 2005 doesn't mean everyone else was.
---
Here's a link to the spreadsheet, with all the other info.
---
[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uCXQni8Ndf0RuKfgNUlQ\_jzfKIYmsCVuYXS\_P3OaKUY/edit#gid=1879540205](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uCXQni8Ndf0RuKfgNUlQ_jzfKIYmsCVuYXS_P3OaKUY/edit#gid=1879540205)
---
Already ruined.....
---
Roll paladin.
---
You could get dual blades from baron:  https://classicdb.ch/?item=13361 they would cross on your back.
---
&gt;Once everything gets too neatly tailored, you lose out on such experiences.
---
This is why I tend to dismiss people who get upset at the idea of cloth or leather gear being the best for raiding as a holy paladin or resto shaman. If there's never a time when you wouldn't want to wear something other than the heaviest armor type you can use, then what is the point of even having armor types or gear that can be worn by multiple classes at all? Or for that matter items with a spread of stats that can be better in some areas than others. May as well get rid of all the stats for every class in the current game and replace it with one called gamer power that goes up a little bit every time you raid, wouldn't change a thing.
---
You can just reset your instances by right-clicking on your portrait and choosing Reset All Instances... no need for a script or a friend.
---
They surely did not expect every player that stepped into a dungeon or raid at 60 to have addons when they designed the game though, right?
---
'*I have a life'*
---
That is the worst cop-out in the history of any video game when it comes to a high level of play and I hate when people try and use it as a legitimate defense on why they cannot do something.
---
For example I was studying for my Bachelor's degree, worked two part time jobs ( equalling around 40 hours a week when combined) went out with friends almost every weekend and I still never missed a single raid my guild held during the entire duration of TBC.  
---
If that right there isn't '***Having a Life***' then I don't honestly know what I have been doing my 33 years of existance.
---
There are so many lower level dungeons and by rushing to the end you skip so much of that fun content and experience to just end up running molten bore for 6 months.
---
Stonetalon
---
Well I wore it on my rouge until I got the aq40 blade cuz you know weapon droop rates in classic and having 10 melee in a raid sucks.So it's pretty okish to have the set
---
how everyone and their mother played in nostalrius, usually the same people that think there was not a blizzlike vanilla server before that one
---
Keanu Reeves is the new Chuck Norris, gotta update the material.
---
Oh man nothing feels more like wow than the 2nd and 3rd war lore
---
F
---
Can’t have both on the same server, you’ll have to play on two different realms
---
Save this bullshit for your Facebook.
---
Are most people using q and e strafe and w move forward?
---
There is no priest racials that will help u as shadow in pve, you wont be able to use devouring plague cus of the extra debuff slot u use, same goes with starfall (ne). 
---
As for pvp starfall is actually extremely underrated, u get cs'd on ur shadow school and u can just stand there and fire off starshards which still does a fair chunk of damage.
---
Hah it’s just going to be me (warrior) and the wife (frost mage) as far as the team goes. Otherwise we’re going to be pugging everything else. 
---
From my adventures on private servers, there seems to be a huge range of competency that range from me being able to 2h tank uldaman in battle/zerker stance AoEing everything to 1h and shield in Prot having to hamstring kite most pulls because the team dps is too slow.
---
Id expect the general population on classic to exacerbate that range, so I’m not sure if I’m sold on pure arms just yet.
---
Winterspring and the Rakhelith (spelling?) questline. The 16 slot bag at the end of that with a sweet fight on top of a spire! Was dope.
---
Expect phase 2 or “wpvp” to take place Late Nov or Dec through March/April.
---
Wep speed normalization was certainly a step in the right direction, but through vanilla they kinda took one step forward and one step back. The move to making both WF and SoC PPM procs meant that slower weapons were still the go to thanks to getting more out of those skills. Fast weapons are sadly still the red-headed step children of vanilla WoW thanks to poorly thought out proc mechanics. And even though the slower reps no longer get extra attack power thanks to wep speed normalization, they do benefit for instant attacks like MS, WW, and SS thanks to their higher top-end damage numbers.
---
The strategy is rolling either a Warlock or a Paladin. Paladin if you're still single and looking for some hot p0rn action, Warlock if you want to enjoy some gameplay while you level up.
---
I've used this strategy since November 2004 and I've always managed to get a mount at level 40.
---
Ok. Grinding beasts sounds like a solid plan my man. Any preferable spots to grind at? Do have any got spots to progress through?
---
Thanks mate
---
Is that Charles Darwin with the boot print on his forehead?
---
Ok dude. You just keep imagining the interest for rp-pvp is much larger than your own numbers show. But you need to inflate your imaginary numbers a lot more. Currently your petition is a literal own goal.
---
Everything you want to achieve is possible, but you're not doing yourself any favors by rolling a NE.  Rank 11 in PVP in particular will be objectively harder than if you were playing an UD or Dwarf.  You shouldn't have that hard of a time healing raids/dungeons as a NE, but this will really be down to finding the right guild to run with and being a good player in general.
---
Gearing as a shadowpriest can be hard since you'll likely be rolling for off-spec since few spriests are even taken in raids and you say you'll be healing.
---
FALSE, that rule only applies to PvP realms. 
---
I'm picking a PvE realm
---
It’s very exhilarating to watch your wife cheat on you
---
I did axesmithing for my guild.  Getting the thorium brotherhood rep was expensive...
---
I'll just never understand either of these. Playing alliance = wtf....letting your significant other fuck different people = seriously wtf.
---
Most guild leaders and raids were ran by older people with kids before still back during the original classic years. It’ll just be more of the same.
---
Yeah OK, got me there.  Well I hope you at least have fun in other things in Azeroth.   Just tell them you don't have any reagents?!!  =)
---
I would probably have gone with a dal rends mainhand
---
Where do you see this info?
---
So you are saying.. you had sex once?
---
Seems more like they are made of rubber. Like mine just bounces off of stuff. And if they hit something, they check with you to see how to react to it. If you freak out, they will freak out, but generally they are fine.
---
Really ?? Didnt notice it after every time you looted ?
---
Just joined up and can't wait to hit it hard with these awesome guys and gals!

---
LEVELING AREAS:
---
1-30 = Quest + grind beasts and level skinning.
---
23-29 = Charred vale in stonetalon (harpy area) kill the fire elementals for a chance at elemental fire for AH. Herbing/mining is good here.
---
23-29 = grind whelps in wetlands (no armor and low hp) (small flame sac sell on AH) (skinning) (easier for alliance)
---
30-33 = Shim Flats South Crocs (skinning)
---
35-40 = Venture Co Shredders in STV for fused wiring to sell on AH (also sell the pages of STV from the goblins)
---
30-40 = Arathi Highlands mine tin ore for tons of gold for iron grenades
---
34-40 = grind jaguars in central swamp for vendor gold and whelps in western swamp (small flame sac sell on AH). (KEEP WICKED CLAWS AND LARGE FANGS FOR AH) (skinning) (herbing is amazing) (check the cave south of the whelps with the npc, a chest spawns often)
---
36-40 = elementals in arathi for the charms (needed for WW axe quest) and elemental air/water/fire
---
38-42 = elementals in northwesterns swamp of sorrows (they have 0 armor)
---
40-45 = whelps in east badlands. (south side first, north side at 42+) (small flame sac sell on AH) (skinning) (good for mining)
---
42-46 = STV crystalvein mine basilisks (they sleep so hunter/locks will get aggro) (skinning)
---
42-46 = Dragonlings in Feralas (highest epic droprate in game) (skinning)

---
57-60 = Ogres in south east deadwind pass, raw silver/vendor stuff and runecloth/potions. drops recipe for 9str on bracers.
---
Going mining + skinning at launch for a shaman. I think I should hit it vendoring skins and auctioning ores but worse case I have ghost wolf
---
I meant more in the case of like 5 mans. I'm envisioning PUGS being strict "Get in my discord channel for SM or kick!" 
---
Even in classic it was a requirement for every guild I ever heard of to have players in a raid be in voice.
---
Bags dropped 10x more frequently in classic.
---
And it's true. I was.
---
My reasoning was, if the game is already so clearly lost, that the only enjoyment left can come out of screwing around and flaming and the like...
---
But after realising League made me nothing but frustrated and angry at the game, I quit.
---
If pur gm or rl found out you would definitely get ax talking to
---
That's amazing! I'll add it to the post. Thanks for the read!
---
 No
---
I took that week off.  I love getting a 9 day vacation by only using 4 vacation days.
---
How? Warlocks don’t go for spirit, their mana regen is negligible
---
EU or US?
---
Shame on you dude...
---
The only statement has been that a sub will be needed for classic. I would hazard this may mean you won't be able to "try it" without a sub. But they can just buy 1 month of sub for $15. Not exactly alot for a game.
---
AMD is more in line with having future proofing of their motherboards.  They have had the AM4 socket last a lot longer than normal because, if I recall, you could go from non pre-Ryzen but for sure from Ryzen 2000 series and now Ryzen 3000 series without upgrading your motherboard. 
---
Intel on the other hand, you're not really getting much as far as future proofing for your motherboard.
---
Either way, sockets are sockets.  Paying more isn't going to get you a future proof socket.  What it might get you is better overclocking to inch out a bit more performance instead of paying for an upgrade or buying one later and other things like better network adapters, on board sound (honestly, buy a PCI sound card for $20 and you're better than any on board sound), types of expansion slots/size, etc.
---
If you're just looking for a basic system... CPU, single GPU, 2-4 sticks of dual channel memory, 1-2 storage drives, no real major overclocking... you don't need some $100+ motherboard or even pushing $200 for some of the boards for x570 boards.  Just need to make sure the motherboard supports your CPU and RAM specs.
---
The Hinterlands and Arathi are my favorites.
---
Is that a picture from Vanilla? I flashed to Northrend jungle when I saw that.
---
Blackfathom Deeps?
---
I'm not a professional priest player, but could you elaborate how 15% mana regen while casting beats spiritual guidance and +10% total healing combination?
---
Don't fret if you're lvl 39 and not quite there yet. Its not like you lose 'points' or anything if you don't have your mount right at 40. Also make sure to leave yourself a buffer...no sense getting your mount and not even having money for flights or the next line of skills.
---
The quest rewards and vendor trash get much better in the lvl 40ish zones so that will help you make up some time once you get there.
---
Great. Nice that we agree your post didn't help in any way. Making progress.
---
Can we also agree that 2secs googling https://www.google.com/search?q=wow+classic+macro would have prevented your post from being useless?
---
If your ability to hang in "proper" pvp rides on the offhand, rethink your gameplay.
---
I'll probably twink NE Priests, at 19 (for Shadowmeld) and 39 (for Shadowmeld mind control) .. But any 60 alliance Priest I make would have to be Dwarf. The fear ward is  just too valuable to consider putting that amount of time in to and not have it at endgame for both PvE and PvP.
---
I WILL NEVER ADMIT THIS BUT I ALSO LEVELED A GNOME ROGUE AND FOUND THE STORYLINES AND ZONES FOR THE ALLIANCE FAR MORE POLISHED AND FLESHED OUT.  BUT AS I AM A TRUE BELIEVER, I AM RIDE OR DIE HORDE.
---
You get the contacts at the end of the survey, mate.
---
That's pretty much exactly what it was.  vanilla is 14 years old, it's been theorycrafted to death in all that time, but it certainly wasn't back then.
---
Boomers...
---
You're right.
---
Why take shadowmeld over get out of blind free and a personal fear ward. Dwarf is going to perform better in pvp in my opinion but it all comes down to personal preference. You're just putting even more stigma on a "meme" spec by not providing fear ward to the raid.
---
False.  Every piece of gear could be viable if they were all differentiated with situational stats and abilities.  The items in Dota, which are based off the same WC3 items as WoW's gear, are all viable.
---
Dagger rogue mate.
---
My spots are:
---
Desolace - Hyenas
---
Swamp of Sorrows - Jaguars
---
Badlands - Whelps
---
Felwood - Bears

I've never heard of the reduced sub cost.  AFAIK it's $14.99/mo and you get BfA and Classic access.
---
Confirms two universal truths:
---
UD rogues are assholes.
---
Alliance is only played by kids.
---
:D was interesting to listen to. Sucks for that little fella though.
---
Probably not because dagger specs rely on you being behind your target and since you don't have a tank while you are solo, you will be slower than with swords. With sword spec you can just run up to mobs and kill them
---
Did you get any shards for deing retail?
---
D1. Will have a main ill play when friends are on. Another for when im alone.  Also plan to make one of each class. Probably more on other servers and evntually Horde. Plan on playing for years if they keep Classic  without expansions.
---
The trial was 15 years ago
---
Yea you arent going to be consistently above a gnome with daggers just cause you have a few agi points. Its just not noticeable at all
---
No no no, those were quality memes and funny. Kids these days...
---
Yeah I don't envy you at all trying to navigate that minefield. Just avoiding revealing you're a woman really just seems like the easier option all around!
---
It's definitely a good thing that games are starting to be more diverse. I don't think sexualisation has ever really been an issue for me. I guess it's equally present for men since most of the models are absurdly muscular, but maybe we just don't feel body related peer pressure to the same extent. My reasons for always choosing a female character are pathetically basic in comparison to yours: "if I'm going to be spending hours looking at a butt, why would I want that to be a dudes butt?" Is about the depth of my reasoning lol.
---
You're not the only one who thinks female trolls look weird. They freak me out. I think it's the tusks.

HYPE

and some screens from original release :D
---
 [https://incendar.com/other\_screenshots.php?game=vanillawow](https://incendar.com/other_screenshots.php?game=vanillawow)
---
The current model has been clear since May, I don't recall what you describe ever being more than speculation.
---
Wasn't streaming blizzcon though, so I might have missed something super early.
---
Ya in that case for sure... I misunderstood
---
Myself and 7 of my friends will be rolling up characters for classic.
---
Some of them never played WOW. I played the longest but quit in Cataclysm after Kung-Fu Pandas were announced as the next XPAC.
---
Classic is bringing in 7 new subs that are not even playing retail. 
---
I imagine my group is not the only one like that.
---
amazing!
---
Not official also it's ugly also this already exists
---
Answer my questions.
---
Remind me when naxx arrives. It will put a strain on many guilds.
---
Lol, paladins dont wear plate armor in Vanilla.
---
You'll be stacking intelligence cloth gear my dude.
---
Congratz :)
---
Dude, have you been in cryogenic stasis?! Beta's over for a month now or so already, been up for months.
---
Keep in mind that Renew is your lowest-aggro healing spell because the healing aggro is spread out over the course of the HoT. As you level up and acquire better gear, Renew will be worth using just for that fact alone. You'll also get into groups with godly tanks who never lose aggro and hardly take any damage. In those groups, you can often lazy heal your way through a dungeon with Renew.
---
\*someone's\* rolling on an RP server!
---
I guess you have the wrong definition of "official"...
---
Zg is catch up gear though. Just because there may be better options doesn’t mean its not your best option when it drops. Loot rng is fickle. Take it when you can get it. I once passed on stormrage helm and never saw it again.
---
I’m going to check this place out
---
Yup, it is
---
I think it's actually cool. When you finally get it you can show off and people know you grinded hard to buy it.

GREEN JESUS IS THE ONE TRUE LEADER OF AZEROTH

**Red Moon Rising** - Flemish (Dutch) Semi-casual Horde Raiding/PvP Guild
---
What's up boys, we're a group of friends, friends of friends and their friends. We're looking for pretty much anyone and anything who wants to have a good, lighthearted time come Classic release. I'd like to say we're all a bit older and thus more mature, but who are we kidding. We'll be exclusively be communicating in Dutch seeing as we're all Flemish. It'd be a major plus if you could actually speak the language, though I guess if you have a basic grasp of the language you'd be welcome to try out.
---
**Our aim** is to grind out some raids after a (semi-casual) amount of leveling time. We need at least 15 more active people, being a couple of healers and a bunch of DPS, who would be down to raid. Other than this we'll run world PvP groups until Battlegrounds are released, at which point we'll add premade BG-groups to rack up a boatload of honour. 
---
**We currently have about 45 members** and we'd like to pump those numbers up to 60ish. If you just wanna hang out and be ultra casual that's cool too, we'd love to shoot the shit with you on Discord. We'll be deciding raiding times once the leveling process is underway in a democratic way. 
---
**So**, PM me for an invite to our Discord (and possibly facebook group, if you're into that), and we'd be glad to have you.
---
There were really two choices:
---
1. WoW Classic remastered with updated mechanics and balancing and such.
---
2. A remake of vanilla wow as close as possible.
---
People wanted the second, so they did the second. They aren’t trying to make a good game, they are re-releasing an old game as it was as much as possible. That’s perfectly acceptable to a lot of people.
---
I literally answered it. But I guess you need it quoted?
---
&gt;Do you think that if a statement which someone has made clear might not be accurate under X circumstance, turns out not to be accurate under X circumstance that means their statement is incorrect?
---
You proposed a solution that doesn't work in classic wow, to a question in r/classicwow. Of course you were incorrect.
---
No it’s Blackfathom Depths
---
You will fail.
---
I will admit. Being a War with those weapons was jus crazy OP. In all epics while most only had a few blues. I killed people with the staff (of course I bought all weapons). Lol
---
Also, if you stop spending mana for 5 seconds, you regen mana. If the tank isn't taking a ton of spikey damage, you can wait til he gets a bit low, drop a greater heal + renew and then regen mana for a bit.
---
You'll need to drink less and your runs will go faster if you manage the 5 second rule well.
---
That's not answering it.
---
I said, if a statement is made in which X is clearly defined as a circumstance where it might not work, and it turns out to not work in that circumstance. Is that incorrect?
---
If you think it is, you're wrong.
---
When logging onto a pserver I noticed a corpse of a player that was in the same spot every day for like three days in a row...
---
If you'd expect the same game you should also expect spell batching :)
---
It was always present in WoW - they only decreased the batching time in the following years due to server architecture improving.
---
Oh totally. I won't be surprised when we hear about TBC servers. In fact, I'll be pretty excited!
---
Admittedly there is 1000 other things i would like them to work on. This is just not a big of a deal to me.
---
I did back during early access and "release." CSGO and Escape from Tarkov both have those twitch names as well. Steam allows all sorts of characters so its normally just the stream url while Tarkov players normally have TTV to start or end their name. 
---
Ive only checked out streams to see *how* I died, not to check out the streamer. I don't find it annoying in shooters, just pointless, but an MMO is a different story...
---
If you can't pay the small sub fee, you should go and get a job
---
I just don't see Discord as a problem.  It might actually make LFG a lot easier because there can be specific LFG areas for specific dungeons, level brackets, looking for quests like 40 minute baron runs, etc.
---
I just remember LFG you'd sit there spamming LFG/LFM every minute because it would get pushed off the general chat spam window so easily.
---
"I named my kid Razor Naga"  
---
-Swifty
---
Thanks, Love your site :) saves so much time trying to hunt down gear
---
I agree.  It probably isn't a good fit, but that also makes me excited for the future of Classic as it may weed out a lot of those people.  I'm sure some will stick around, but after they've "beaten" it, they'll move onto something else.
---
It's about the same cost as a movie and a small drink. 
---
I'm sure you'd spend at least 1 fewer night out as a consequence of classic.
---
It's the insensitive to order delivery that's the real threat personally. Gotta get my meal prep scheduled to stay healthy and frugal.
---
You need 1,000 subs and 10,000 hours watched in the last 12 months
---
shadow meld is the most underrated OP world pvp racial in the game (besides on rogue and druid). 
---
For pve, people will only care if you're good.
---
Can't wait to game like I did back then, and see these noobs being insulted by me not going BiS, world buffs, consumables etc.
---
Or the third option. Remake of vanilla wow as close as possible, while keeping the standards up to date. You dont buy yourself CRT monitor to remake your vanilla experience as close as possible. You will use 1820x1080 full HD monitor im pretty sure
---
Skeletons wipe on server reboots.
---
Servers were rebooted a lot during beta.
---
I'm not saying this should be changed, but I will miss some of the hybrid specs not really being that viable in PvE raiding.
---
I will miss being able to respec easily since my PvE and PvP specs need to be different.
---
I actually don't like the PvP ranking system in classic, but again, don't think it should be changed - personally, however, I do not like it.
---
Yea a mage in fire resist gear and dampen magic can solo multiple packs of these w aoe and it makes you so much gold from elemental fire. A warrior can barely kill one of these elites and cant even pull them ias they are usually spawned in a big pack.
---
These reactions make me proud.
---
Her, but yeah I agree. The family might not have gotten the "perfect" farewell from her WoW friends, but she became immortal in the minds of many many more people.
---
That was option 1 above. Basically, #somechanges.
---
But like I said, that’s not what was asked for, so it’s not what we are getting.
---
I laughed so hard that my lungs were launched into outer space and now they're orbiting earth, threatening to collide with the ISS, destroying it in the process.
---
Is what part of that equation do you see the word “good”
---
Twin colossus, feralas
---
2 days into no-living Classic all that has been forgotten.
---
You're baby looks like a gnome, may want a paternity test...
---
Ok got it, finally. Pretty embarrassing.
---
I just want to run circles on org bank
---
Seems to be multiple potential causes, changing your adblocker or disabling css with RES or similar should do the trick.
---
FUCK THE HORDE
---
&gt;I'm currently waiting to play WoW Classic again, and have a history of playing MMOs, but I'm not "currently" playing anything
---
That sorta means you aren't an MMO player, doesn't it? Rather a waiting-game player.
---
What did you expect it would cost? 10$ is okay but you can justify spending 15$?
---
because it doesn't like fire fox
---
This is honestly the best thing for me personally. When people have good gear you know instantly no need to inspect slutmogs to see if they are gonna whoop you.
---
You also get a free +83 FR from a mind control buff at the start of LBRS.
---
What am I looking at here?
---
Now I donät want to play anymore...
---
why would you not want world of warcraft reforged?
---
Leia Poppins was a tragedy as soon as it was shot.
---
AH, YES, THE ONE THING HORDE AND ALLIANCE CAN AGREE ON...
---
GNOMES ARE FOR PUNTING.
---
Would also point out enhance was not a meme for a very long time in classic. It wasn't until they made it so WF don't proc off of WF that it became a meme.
---
Reserving items in Pugs is the worst shit. You want me to come to your 2 hour dungeon and I'm not allowed to roll on the items? People are so clueless thinking this is acceptable.
---
FUCK WARRIORS
---
MOOOOOOOOO
---
I understand your point of view and I really see it as a logical step from blizzard to do this. It only proves to me however, they have no clue what is good for the health of the game
---
During first week or so, there will be plenty of toxic players from Retail. But they will quickly go back to Retail. Classic is not for them. Those from Retail that change to Classic as their main WoW, are old players, that lived through Vanilla and TBC, and they are very social. No issues with them.
---
Due to isolated realm community, toxic players will be "tamed" by the community, quickly find themselves on most people ignore lists, and will either start behaving, or quit the game. Same for ninjalooters.
---
The Classic community will be like it was in Vanilla : the overwhelming majority (90%+) will be nice, cool, sociable and helpful players.
---
Mannoroths broken war glaive at the spot where he was defeated by Grom Hellscream.
---
yes, now go away
---
Dude pick two.
---
One to main to 60 for raids and shit.
---
One to break up the severe and constant desire to become an altoholic.
---
&gt;  but you're not doing yourself any favors by rolling a NE
---
This guy doesn't PVP.
---
&gt; Rank 11 in PVP in particular will be objectively harder than if you were playing an UD or Dwarf
---
Your racial has zero impact on how long you have to grind AV to get R11.
---
I remember helping my brother's hunter with his quest for the bow/staff combo. Nobody else can touch the mobs you spawn or it will despawn and you have to wait (I believe) 8-16hrs for the trigger mob to respawn.
---
This. And it’s exactly why I’ll be playing one too.
---
Ive been messing around with the idea of a ret paladin that can also be proficient at healing, both in pvp and pve.
---
The build looks like this.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sE0uzxZZVfztrcqo
---
I do sacrifice 3% hit from the prot tree but I get nice stat boosts in both str and int, get that consecration, better healing that can cost no mana if crit (hello flash of light spam) and on top of that a neat 5% resistance to fears and blinds.
---
What do yall think
---
you jest now. but when they bring in instant boost to 50 it will be to late.
---
Yeah they were originally swords and were later changed when they revamped the instance.
---
My pants have been peed ever since the first announcement.
---
Not to set myself up to be accused of being a fanboy, but I think their intent with Classic is to give the fan base what they are asking for. And while many people would be fine with some changes, the vocal majority are not, and so that’s what blizzard is doing.
---
tl;dr - "Play a Dwarf because you *owe me* that fear ward, no one cares if you like NE!"
---
Not gonna lie, I'd never wear that.   Why would I want a wow shirt that looks like a coke shirt?
---
Looks horrible to me
---
**My source here:** [https://www.reddit.com/user/kakotiza/comments/cjffsp/tshirt\_source/](https://www.reddit.com/user/kakotiza/comments/cjffsp/tshirt_source/)
---
You'll be able to hit R14 on any class if a) you are good, and b) you have time.
---
If you are set on hunter, learn the mechanics and tricks and enjoy being able to shred through clothies in PvP.  The pet stuff isn't a big deal, and creating a simple macro to control the pet attack/follow is easy.  Damage falloff isn't that huge as you read about.  You scale slightly worse, but you're still needed for tranq shot.  For PvP you will still shread clothies and make rogues hate fighting you.
---
For race, I am a huge Troll fan for hunter.  The bow spec as well as berserking is top tier for PvE, but the Orc's stun resists can't be denied king of PvP racial between the races.
---
I forgot about Jaguero Isle in STV where you freed the Tauren princess from a giant gorilla on a jungle island. 
---
The whole quest chain started from finding a message in a bottle on the shoreline near Booty Bay.
---
&gt;you bet your ass all 40 of us were wearing the stupidest imaginable gear to get that 100 FR 
---
That's exactly the problem right there - when you're wearing resist gear, your DPS goes way down and it takes longer to kill the boss. The longer you spend killing the boss, the more damage you have to soak up.
---
Yeah they’ve already shown us their motives with the additional fee to the subscription to be able to play Classic! 
---
Wait...
---
This whole server rep thing is really overrated.  People talk about it like there's 10 people on a server.  There's tons of people and it's pretty hard to build up a rep one way or another.
---
In your haste to be offended on behalf of others, did you miss the part where the deceased loved PVP? How do you know she wouldn't have been overjoyed to know that this happened in her name? Just because you're not capable of taking PVP disruption in a video game as sporting fun rather than a personal attack doesn't mean others aren't.
---
She died almost 10 years ago and we're still talking about her because of it.
---
I was going to say. By all means please counterspell my mount so i can fuck you up with dots + fear.
---
what are you even talking about?
---
nah they are naturally purple glow
---
I agree there is a special 'attribute' and I like the term for it: world coherency.  
---
It means thing in world, the resources, are finite and tangible.   Mining nodes are not instanced.  Chests and loot are not instanced or personal.  Areas and mobs and bosses in the world are not instanced.    The resources are the same for everyone and they are fought over.  They are cooperated over.  It gives a sense of importance to your actions and roots you firmly in the story of other real players!  When you look that item or chest or node or mob, you are taking that loot away from the player right behind you.  Or you can share it with him/her.    That is really cool.  That feels real.   
---
World's without this (retail) instead instance everything separately for every player so it feels like everyone is always in their own instance and they don't affect anyone else... A single player game.  Lame
---
All these things were true for pservers as well, and yet pservers still had guilds that never made it past BWL
---
Because we actually had to put in effort to get anywhere, instead of just flashing your wallet as you do nowdays.
---
I don’t know how many devs you know, but they’re generally pretty separated from the business process and have integrity in their work. Not saying the business side can’t drive the direction of a product into the ground, just saying don’t lump the devs in with them.
---
&gt; it was rewarded by the game
---
But I mean, it was, it's in the game that killing the opposite faction in a contested zone gives honor. Is it optimal, no, but it would have been a wholly different thing if it was a bannable offence and they still had gone through with it.
---
&gt;And the thing it changed to have their character killed is that people in the event became angry at this display of trolling instead of having a peaceful moment.
---
They can still just log out or go to a friendly zone. Again if they wanted to be in a contested zone and not have the option of being harassed they should have cleared it with a GM or just not been there.
---
&gt;Is this funny? Not at all unless you think prank videos and trolling funerals are fun
---
I think prank videos and trolling real funerals are not funny at all. Do I think this is the epitome of humor, no, but I still find the whole ordeal humorous and very interesting in the scope of how people engage with virtual worlds. You don't get to decide what is funny or not, or how people are who find this humorous.
---
Speaking from my experience, our server had our share of known idiots and most worthwhile guilds would rather go in a man down then invite them to the group.
---
We still make fun of some of the more prevalent baddies to this day.

**/u/kakotiza is a fake spammer account**

**This applies to clothing/mugs/posters/etc...**

This listing was created today, almost certainly in response to this post. There are lots of people who trawl reddit for popular posts of graphics and funny pics. They upload low resolution images found on google or even cut and pasted from the reddit post’s photo, onto item preview images.  
---
The broken English nonsense description is also a red flag (even though it’s inadvertantly hilarious). When you buy the item, if you actually receive it you will very likely receive a shit quality item with a fuzzy blurry print. 
---
Be careful, friends! Please be sure and report anything you see!

Corpse and that explains it.  Poor fellow must've died to the darkhounds in Trisfal Glades.
---
And on a recent pserver there was a Tauren named "Basdnredplld" who would always leave his corpse on top of the Ironforge mailbox.
---
Now I'm dead and writing this as a ghost.
---
Follow the rules
---
I hear you, those kinds of places can really make you relax for a couple of minutes and realize just how alive the world can sometimes feel. It furthermore gives you a sense of accomplishment, but not in the here-you-go-here-is-an-achievement kind of way. 
---
It simply feels nice, and although I've never liked the bleakness of Desolace, Nijel's Point (I believe that's its name?) does provide a respite of some sorts due to its relaxed atmosphere, and we agree here as well. 
---
I also remember the first time I tried to find that settlement. I tried for what felt like a long time to climb my way up the cliffs, until I later realized that there was a road that led straight up to the settlement, not far from where I had attempted to amateur mountain climb my way, he he.
---
You might wanna look up "Holy-Reckoning"-build for this purpose, if you don't really wanna go deep ret.
---
I also get benediction in the ret tree because I would use blessing of wisdom basically all the time. Mana is so important for a ret pally and its important that its always regenerating.
---
Ye
---
Night Elf Warrior named Eldebaron. We met leveling and stuck together through all of vanilla, me tanking and him dpsing. He was also really into pvp and dragged me into a ton of BG’s!
---
He played some in TBC but that was when we got separated, I think he quit the game.
---
Good times though!
---
Hmm buddies and I rolling horde, might talk later!
---
Find another class to level with and it’ll be a lot smoother.
---
I like this! So much agreee
---
[This quest](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?quest=845)
---
I’m talking about the fact that this thread is ridiculous.
---
3 weeks paid time off, the wife and kids are at her parents house. It's me and the dog.
---
**Falloff:** you are mostly there for Tranq shot after BWL, the rest is gravey. That said you can stay above tank and meme dps easy during progression.
---
**Pet Management:** your main goal in raids is to stay out of the way and keep the bastard alive. Outside of bosses, dismiss. It's not your job to pull aggro off healz, don't try this unless it's been set up in advance (different in 5 mans.)
---
**Professions:** you're the gold farming class, just buy your BoE leather (devilsaur set) and get that vital Engi leveled up.
---
**Race:** you heard right. Stun resist is huge in PvP, but other orc benefits do little for a PvE hunter. Troll haste buff is great for a bit of extra nuke, and getting hit capped at 6 with Rohk gives you some nice flexibility.
---
I doubt the LFR tards will have the patience to show up every week to maybe get a piece or 2 of gear.
---
Sarcasm
---
It depends:
---
Retail wow over the years has narrowed (or disguised) the gap of achievement between casual and hardcore players - multiple gearing sources, titanforging, weekly rewards, etc. allow casual players a taste of the rewards of the hardcore.
---
In classic, it’s pretty obvious the difference between a casual player who doesn’t have time to raid or pvp to rank 10 for higher quality gear, and there are no real catchup mechanics between tiers like in modern wow. HOWEVER, the ‘rest’ of the game is IMO wayyy more enticing than retail wow: leveling is actually enjoyable, professions matter, community / guild is more impactful on your experience, and the world is in general much more satisfying to explore. 
---
If you only have time to play very casually, you would still have fun playing the ‘rest’ of the game because it’s an awesome game with a ton of content. You just have to ask yourself if you’re OK not achieving rewards that take more time as opposed to retail wow where the lines are more blurred.
---
Anyone else old enough to remember the people who were dying in gamercafe's playing wow back in the day?
---
Do not do this OP. I see you smarting off to the people telling you that you will die. Please, it sounds like you're in a bad place right now and I really encourage you to seek help. 
---
Call this number and just talk it out. 
---
1-800-273-8255
---
Joanas guide. Nice.
---
Nope. I remember everybody flipping out about it since it was more twitch and skill based PVP.
---
Lol you guys were right about the type of content being posted here.
---
Had me at goblin buttplugs
---
You clearly never played Vanilla. If you get blacklisted by a player that have plenty of other friends (which everyone basically have) you get on everyone's blacklist.
---
And god forbid that one of them is an Officer in a respectable guild. 
---
You will have to reroll another character, change name (pay for it) or change realm (again, pay for it). But you will pay for being a dick no matter what.
---
ya'll are taking this way to lightly. you don't like retail WoW but you're fine with the same devs doing classic and think that will work out fine..
---
I'm so happy about the dozens of couples I'm hearing about that are tank/heals. You are going to make a lot of friends buddy!
---
Absolutely true.
---
Than you weren't an asshole.
---
Show us on the doll where Uther touched you.
---
This is literally a thing asking for things you aren't looking forward to in classic.  I find the ______gaming, ______TTV, ______twitch, names are cringe enough.
---
Sure, ignore from general chat.  Can't ignore them physically standing in front of you or when they're sitting somewhere mid pack on a BG score board.
---
Will I deal with it?  Yeah.  It's not like I'm not going to play classic because some kid thinks their the next TTV star.  Spoiler alert, they're not.
---
Us
---
There’s going to be a lot of pvpers lying about how many gladiator titles they have and how god they are at pvp with no real way to verify if they’re bullshitting or not.
---
Watch me
---
Sure, your 1.12 macro is not incorrect in itself. It's an 1.12 macro. It is just completely irrelevant. Your macro is the incorrect ANSWER to OP's question. 
---
You want a cookie because you put it on the record that your incorrect answer might be an incorrect answer. Ok. Here is your cookie.
---
But fact is, you could have spent 2secs googling and given OP the correct answer.
---
Yep. Lots of "bad" loot is just things you don't feel bad about disenchanting.
---
When every single piece of loot is "good", you get retail where all the gear is the same crap with the same stats.
---
You think you hit it? Having to be #1 PvPer for like 3+ weeks straight seems like something that would stick with you.
---
LFR is actually fucking awful, in my (very limited) experience people wipe in there all the time. If you got 5 decent mythic raiders they alone could easily kill LFR bosses though, and probably do it quicker than 30 LFR-tards. 
---
So to be clear, I agree with you, I just wanted to rant about LFR a bit, haha. 
---
&gt;Not to mention in vanilla raids trash is often more difficult than the bosses and can easily wipe you in many ways if you pull slightly incorrectly. That element of raiding is completely gone in retail.
---
This got me thinking. I think vanilla raiding is actually very comparable to mythic+ dungeons. Similar amounts of mechanics, and Trash can indeed be more difficult than the bosses (especially if you try to do it quickly).
---
Azshara is great in Vanilla, it felt so autumnal and quiet. But if you got in the water it was a bitch to get back up to the plateaus.
---
For sure shoot me a dm on here or post I check reddit too often.
---
How I feel wanting to roll warrior
---
Yeah except.
---
1. Account sharing is a thing. It's easy (and unfair) to get a character to grind 24/7 if you share it.
---
2. The people grinding don't necessarily know each other. There is no organisation or cooperation or even negotiating with some idiot and his 3 friends who just started summer break and decided to ruin your attempt at HWL by grinding 24/7 on their fresh lvl 60 account.
---
it's literally the soulstone icon lol
---
OR YOU COULD USE YOUR LIMITED TIME TO ACTUALLY ENJOY THE GAME.
---
Sell all BoE items in the AH and pick two gathering profession (skinning and mining).
---
WoW is the only place where communism actually works, not only that, but it is the optimal way of doing things.
---
This is my second one, I know what you mean
---
Karazhan. It was mysterious and menacing. There was no actual direct game reason for its existence (or Deadwing Pass in general), and I wanted in there so badly!
---
Heh, fair point. Comedic value aside, i do think i rather like where they actually went with the character (in TBC, wrath and what not at least, a lot less so in legion bfa etc). Your thoughts ?
---

---
I play RPG's to gear other peoples toons aswell!
---
Discussion loot systems isn't inherently selfish and is important. The guild you join makes or breaks your wow experience and how that guild distributes loot reveals a lot about them.
---
For me, all the threads about loot systems are recruiting opportunities. Once you understand [Loot Lists](http://onslaught-wow.com/about/), you'll never want to use anything else, even in casual guilds.
---
Even in PvP though, how would Trolls fare compared to Orcs in terms of overall performance? The Berserking racial makes it seem like you can nuke in PvP too, they seem so equal.
---
Or the server hosts who would then ban you and resell your shit.
---
Another Chicken Little.
---
Yes even though the first sentence specifically states personal fear ward (for pvp). Reading comprehension is pretty cheap brother, you can get a Rosetta Stone or Hooked on Phonics for like sub 20$ these days.
---
But, the system a guild chooses has to be good fort he guild. 
---
/roll isn't good the guild. But appeals to alot of people because it on the face seems fair.
---
Loot council is in theory best for the guild. But doesn't appeal to alot of people because of the appearance of bias. 
---
So dkp or similiar systems are both good for a guild as they encourage participation and are fairer/unbiased. 
---
It's ok to want gear. Gear is a giant motivator for play. If you're in a guild and you never get gear.... you probably will leave. New guild members don't care about the guild. You have to entice them with the promise of gear to get people to come with you. The best for the guild mindset comes from longer term members who are friends with each other and can recognize that their friends/guildmates getting gear is better for them aswell. Culture like that takes time and effort to build and doesn't just happen because you say "gear for one is gear for all."
---
Well yeah, LFR is obviously a joke, but so is normal raiding in BfA, and I'm not sure classic is much more difficult than that. At least not the early raids.
---
Great to hear! Keep up the work!
---
Word, this was helpful and straight to the point!
---
The fact is that there is no standalone price.   You are just making excuses.
---
Man I have like 1700 hours of Rocket League on my main account and it just isn't the same once you get to higher levels. I have a few alt accounts where I just mess around to help noobs out, and their games are so much more enjoyable to be a part of.
---
The corpse would stay until you revived. Skeletons would spawn at that point and remain until a server refresh/reboot.
---
It's more like 10,000-12,000, to have a healthy population, since concurrent to total player is a 1 to 4 ratio.
---
So, to get to a 2,500 concurrent, you need 10,000 total, and for a 3k concurrent, you need 12k.
---
A minimum of 1,500 concurrent is when a realm still function properly, albeit with much longer times for forming groups, and an economy that is barely functioning, so a minimum of 6,000 total player should sign the petition.
---
Problem is that this 1.5k concurrent / 6k total,  would be at launch...adding the 60% droput in 1 year, you are looking a dead server.
---
So, to have 1.5k concurrent / 6k total in one year, you need at least 2.4k concurrent / 9.6k total at launch.
---
You aren't going to get a realm without a minimum of 10k signatures. I would sign it, but I won't play, so I would actually make it worse if I sign.
---
&gt; Reading comprehension
---
Pretty funny that you have none and can't parse a single sentence.
---
Ye sadly it's not the best system. I think TBC had a great PvP System, right?
---
How is it that this guy's vent rants are so available? This is the same guy from the Onyxia Wipe Animation and Ragnaros rant, right?
---
HAS THERE BEEN ANY MORE NEWS UPDATES FOR CLASSIC? IT IS LAUNCHING IN A MONTHS TIME OR SO AND THE CLASSIC NEWSFEED IS DEAD AND I WAS WONDERING WHAT IS GOING ON OK?
---
OH NO MY CAPSLOCK IS STUCK ARGGHH
---
Thanks! Yeah, he's so pumped for Classic to come out, and this was part of him getting hyped about it.
---
Can't watch the video at work but I think the topic you're talking about is related to what I've been calling "sense of place," which is the quality of *giving the impression that the virtual world is a place that exists*.
---
The zones in modern WoW are a little too "just so." The quests are structured to take you on a tour of the zone while you experience the story, and it ends up *feeling like* a tour and a story instead of like exploring a fantasy country. 
---
Some of the keys to making a zone feel like a place include having more space between the quest hub and the quest objective, making areas bigger than they need to be, having landmarks that don't relate to quests or other game mechanics, and reasonable mob placement. Also having quests that don't breadcrumb together *too* conveniently - having to go out of your way sometimes feels "realer" than getting everything done in one big shopping list.
---
Anything with nature resist will be worth a ton when AQ40 is opened, regardless of the level
---
If you get your mount cs'd it locks you out of shadow school.
---
Yeah, no stand alone price for a new game. That’s a good thing, even though you somehow can’t see that. I get to play at 0 additional cost. That’s not excuses, that’s simply a fact. I’m appreciative of the model.
---
Herbalism/skinning, and vendor virtually everything but mid level alch mats. 
---
I'll be leveling 1h/sheild shaman, which is incredibly non-gear reliant, so the need to upgrade won't be there outside of occasional Eagle pieces that nobody wants so they sell cheap.
---
It would be a fun experiment to see how many mechanics you would need to remove to make 40 man mythic difficulty on par with 20 man. 40 man Tomb of Sargeras makes me giggle just thinking about it.
---
People making comments about how the community is so different and how terrible it is now (apply this in any facet min max, loot rules, memes and jokes).   
---
How if blizzard really recreated vanilla how it would of been 1000x harder and that this is some sort of joke abomination.
---
It's close.  For pure damage Trolls will win out, but for surviving against (mainly) rogues, Orc will win.  Thankfully, hunters in general have a lot of anti rogue tools by default, so it's a toss up imo.
---
This doesn’t make any sense. If raids just didn’t drop gear, I know a lot of ppl who wouldn’t raid.
---
So in fact, a lot of ppl raid for gear
---
There 100% will be gold farmers, no doubt about it
---
42
---
How did this game ever succeed? Lol
---
I mean theres 3 iron maiden posters sitting behind them lmao
---
Not a good thing, stop lying.
---
Lmao, explain how I’m “lying.” It’s very obviously a good thing in my situation.
---
Was thinking of rolling ally this time, but barrens chat makes it a hard decision.
---
it is a big deal. Nesingwary won’t feel the same without it.
---
in retail vanilla no you couldnt, atleast not with default frames. I'm sure there were addons that added it though. On private servers that run on 1.12.1 client it's added in with the addon Luna.
---
You must have been on the best server in the game to have lesser guilds clearing whole wings. Only a thousand players in the world have ever killed Kel’Thuzad 40. The raid itself was only available for three months. And the coordination of forty people, as you stated, is far less easy than Most people truly remember. The other thing that is going to prove these raids more difficult than we remember is how much the community has changed. It’s younger, less patient. Players as a whole might be better now but no way in hell are the increase in want-to-be elitist mentalities going to make keeping a core group very easy. But what do I know.
---
2 handed dungeon tanking , sweeping strikes is BiS. Its just no good for anything else.
---
I’d say 5-6 days. Pala is still way faster than Rogue and Warrior.
---
As someone who's gonna be a GM in Classic, good news is i'm gonna be a mage. Whoever deserves the hammer the most and WANTS it gets it, honestly it is probably going to an enhancement shaman and thats okay with me, it is a meh weapon. Thunderfury is a different story, reserved for whichever tank deserves it the most.
---
Randolph the grey!
---
guy did it backwards lol 
---
leveled 1-45 as shadow and 46-60 as holy leveled solely in dungeons as healer were in super short supply 
---
said he never stopped getting invites and messages
---
This 100%. Not only do I have more time for hobbies when my GF didn't live with me, but I was nearly twice as productive doing nearly everything else as well.
---
Because of the MH’s attack speed?
---
Back then, yes definitely. This time around: Probably not honestly. Assuming you stack your raid correctly with only fire mages for ignite, as well as have your offtanks being fury-prot hybrid spec instead of pure prot then it's not much of a DPS check. The rest is just having competent healers capable of rotating their heals and having the raid pop their greater shadow protection potions at the correct intervals.
---
uldaman on alliance is like 100% this.  If you wanna do all the quests you gotta go run the dungeon like 3 or 4 times.
---
Well of course - people asked for classic, they will give it to them as it was. Except the layering. Except the modern client. Except some minor changes. Except all the bugs that were not present back then. Except the absence of unarmored mounts. Except modern macros. Except the original patch progression. They have already changed enough. But removing a feature, that were originally created purely to compensate bad internet connection, thats a big no-no
---
You don’t need to own BFA to play classic. You just need a subscription.
---
Drop rates mostly. I have this fear ill be in valley of trials for 500 years waiting on my turn to get one vile familiar head.
---
Have you actually looked at the definition of parse? Analyze (a sentence) into its parts and describe their syntactic roles. You're trying really really hard and it's just sad. Maybe pick up one of those old Brians Gamer Guides and get to reading before your family realizes you're retarded too. Have a great day!
---
The only way to do it to be worth it, is a dedicated group pf 5 players, dead set on leveling in dungeons only, all prepared for this with consumables and proper gear.
---
A random PuG for leveling will be worse in XP than a solo Prot Warrior grinding mobs for XP.
---
oh I dont see that happening
---
It's not silly, degrees matter.
---
Spell batching changed in TBC.
---
i think you misunderstand what people are getting at when they want a fair system, they ARE NOT being selfish, that want to ensure that other selfish people don't get picked out because "reason", i.e like the GM's best friend who just joins a random raid, dose nothing but die and wipe the raid then gets awarded loot via a loot council, or becuase you have a group of friends that manipulate DKP, forcing you to spend far more of it that anyone else in the guild would do for large upgrade so they can rake in all the items on low bids between them.
---
U r a minority.  More ppl are getting fucked
---
Leveling a paladin is truly a test of patience since the combat routine is simple and include lots of "autoattacking" / waiting for a proc. Also don't be fooled by the retribution spec, you won't be a juggernaut there. ;)
---
When i leveled my paladin to 60, the only thing that really kept me going was my determination for being a useful healer and protector at top level. (A little bit of rping an helpful knight).
---
The lack of unarmoured epic mounts.
---
Those logs are based on the current pserver armor values which are 4691 armor for most bosses, and 5591 for Patchwerk. In Classic the armor values are 3731 for most bosses, most probably including Patchwerk
---
You could also watch something that won't bore you to death.
---
Good way to put it. So simple yet somehow so forgotten.
---
`/cast Frostbolt`
---
Enter
---
alt-UP
---
Simple advice, don't be afraid to remove people that don't fit in.  I had to do it a few times running a raiding guild, it's not fun, it can be a lot like firing someone, but it's often better for the guild.
---
I think a lot of people will actually be in for a wake up call on MC and maybe even Ony.  
---
No, they arent super hard or demanding mechanically.  But they are also not going to be things that fall over if you run at them with 40 people in greens.
---
Also, a lot of people seem to think they'll hit 60 with a full set of preraid BIS by finishing their leveling in dungeons... good luck with drops.
---
You sick bastard
---
lol 60 would be way more 
---
right now its 0+sub
---
60+sub sounds way worse
---
haha it's ok, I didn't even remember the minutes to hours requirement.  Just with the miss matched gave me enough to go back and dig up what it was.
---
I always get little temperament in posts discussing spell batching or melee leeway, sorry
---
No, we knew.
---
Don't be retarded. Communism in WoW would involve taking the loot from the badass raider and giving it to the dad who plays 15 minutes a week.  
---
Doling out rewards responsibly among 40 people to motivate attendance and progression is extremely capitalistic.
---
Outside of my IRL friend who got me into the game, I made a lifelong friend in vanilla, even though he was like 13 and I was 17 at the time, we've stayed buds and played vidyas together since. I've even visited him and his family a couple of times, really nice people. We don't game as much anymore because his career is taking off and he's moved to a large city recently while trying to cut down on his gaming habits to focus, but he'll never stop being my friend :)
---
Thanks for quoting me out of context. This cesspool never changes.
---
Manually decursing all of the AoE curses/poisons in raids.
---
there is an undeniable enjoyment that comes from getting a good item earlier than everyone else
---
if you wanna be super logical and wait your turn, thats fine too. but if the guy that shows up to one raid gets the item you've been grinding for months and months, im sure you will be a little less than happy for them
---
yeah we already knew that a long while ago
---
He wasn't much of a character, just a stereotypical big game hunter that was a good, kind of tongue-in-cheek way to dispense fetch quests. So it was very fitting to put him where the beasts were in BC and Wrath. And the whole storyline about setting up his camp in Wrath was a great use of phasing - if we take it for what it is. Phasing of course is still not very good from an MMORPG perspective.
---
But as an actual character, I think he should have met the consequences of his hubris at some point. Otherwise it's just dragging on and on and on, like a lot of retail.
---
Yeah, but what happens when you hit the bach button?
---
we knew
---
And the set bonus
---
The good thing is it's a shared sub so you can pop into retail for some ram racing.
---
All good man, just making sure it’s clear I’m not arguing one way or another. I’m not as adamant as a lot of the folks on here.
---
that was clear some time ago
---
By speculation I guess that's true, I wish we  could get concrete timeline, I believe the phase 1 is going to be alot longer than people anticipated
---
especially if you are a warrior and want to do both pvp and pve. I hope they decide to lower it at some point. 50 g respec cap is such a pain.
---
Good point :)
---
You seem like a really nice person
---
You understand we didn't know if a game license will be needed, right? To sub to WoW, you need a WoW account. You get a WoW account through adding a game key to the bnet account. We did not know if a Starter Edition upgrade was valid. This confirms that.
---
Prick.
---
Like what aspects? doesn't really tell me much.
---
&gt;It feels to me more like i an playing diablo with the amount of effects all around me at the same time. But its all up to personal preferences.
---
I feel like all modern games are like this.  They shove tons of spell effects and lights on your screen that I can't see what's going on.  It also removes the impact to where I don't feel like I'm doing what my character is doing in game.
---
Pot, allow me to introduce you to kettle.
---
\+1 for Joana's on second monitor
---
I mean even these kinds of things felt pretty epic the first couple of times. After 10 times or more tho...
---
This is my issue, $15 a month for a 15 year old game just seems so steep. I loved classic, but there are so many other games that are newer I could spend the money on.
---
No, we didn't.
---
That sure was epic as hell. I remember being on an organized raid of 40 people or so from Grom'Gol all the way down near Booty Bay because a group of 10 to 15 alliance members were killing horde players that were just leveling over there. It felt so nice to avenge the fallen. I can only wonder how marching with that much people would feel like.
---
That was on an spanish private server, never had the chance to play retail until the end of WoTLK
---
No, no we didn't.
---
Yes but even in instances, the loot is finite and not personal.  If you loot that T1 chest, another player doesn't get it.  Obviously vanilla isn't TOTALLY finite and uninstanced and obviously some things respawn after a while but it's still orders of magnitude more of a 'coherent' world on a sliding scale.  
---
One game that has amazing coherence is EVE online as another example.  There is one single world and players actions go down as legacy and actually affect other players in HUGE ways - literally becoming historic and famous.
---
Playing horde as all my friends and I played allied in vanilla.
---
No, we really didn't (:
---
Talents give you like 15% of spirit regen while casting. With enough spirit you never have to drink.

here's the door
---
Azshara, the area looks like it got a long history to it. Crumbled statues and buildings hinting at a once flourishing civilization before it was all destroyed.
---
You forgot to *tip fedora*
---
no you didn't we did
---
It launches on the 26th for the UK too.
---
Considering you can clear Mc in under 2 hours with a raid full of blues if everyone is good, fire resistant gear isn’t as popular as it once was.
---
Why would someone want slow weapons?
---
I'm confused.
---
Try ironfoe or the epic chest from the same dungeon
---
you didn't 
---
look at all the responses 
---
we did
---
Shit, you’re right. I forgot when I called you a Mud-hut living savage without being provoked at all.
---
Oh wait...you called me that. 
---
Thanks for playing.
---
Most people won't down C'thun, let alone get anywhere in Naxx.
---
Hell, I probably won't even see either.
---
really
---
Blizzard should ban deadlyboss mods, weakaura, quest helpers, etc..
---
the MH sucks for rogues you mean
---
I meant as a set yes
---
I raided BWL every week for god knows how long and never saw one nerubian slave maker either. I did see two zin roks drop but ran zg an ungodly amount as well.
---
&gt; Skeletons wipe on server reboots.
---
&gt; Servers were rebooted a lot during beta.
---
there was a cap on skeletons in a zone. in the giant battle of arathi there was only 50~ish skeletons when over 500 deaths happened
---
old ones despawn when new ones are made in classic
---
was it quest helper or something then?  Whatever the popular one was back then, I didn't ever really learn the names of them.
---
Slow is a synonym for "high top-end" in this subreddit basically
---
Yes, for my priest I still haven't decided whether, after the initial 10 points in spirit tap and wand mastery, to go discipline for Improved PW:S, Inner Focus and Meditation, or shadow for +4% hit, and improved shadow word pain (which may not be necessary for leveling PvE).  Mind flay isn't all that great until rank 3, which is much later in my leveling career.   I'll be on a PvP server, but shadow doesn't get interesting again until Silence.
---
I'll need to figure which way to start going at level 20.
---
Then, at max level I will need to figure out whether to be tri-spec (really fun, but with no BGs yet, maybe now is not the time to use that spec), or holy/disc with mana burn.
---
Not with that attitude
---
from a purely business standpoint they will loose everything if they fuck it up.
---
The whole premise of classic is that you get what you had in the original version (or at least as close to it as they can) if they decide to make it some corparate cash grab instead they will not only loose millions of players and their subs but all the money they put into developing it.
---
It is in their best interest to just "do what it says on the tin" then they gain hundreds of thousands minimum players and their subs potential several million including old players that are lured back and new players that will flood in when it tops twitch (over $2 million a month subs minimum)
---
the changes
---
Does this actually happen in games today?  
---
I don't play many chat oriented games anymore.  Though, I wouldn't be surprised if it does happen considering the state of people anymore.
---
If you read what I said properly, you'd know I had looked online and found exactly what coopcooper said. that it was bundled in with the regular Sub cost.   
---
My question was more that I remembered them saying something different in the past, that's all... Not sure why you need to be such an ass about it. :)
---
I'm not surprised you didn't see Nerubian Slavemaker since it drops off Kel'Thuzad.
---
I liked having to actually head to and fight your way to instance portals.  Sometimes the opposite faction would be there, sometimes not.  Sometimes a silent truce would be made and parties would refrain from bloodshed and cooperate to get inside the dungeon faster, sometimes not.  The outside leading up to the dungeon was just as much a part of the instance to me.  Jumping down into the water at Blackfathom Deeps and swimming underneath into the twisting caves.  Fighting through the defias brotherhood to enter the deadmines.  Being teleported into the trogg ridden city of Gnomeregan.  The journey into the Scarlet Monastery.  Uldaman, ZF, Mara, Sunken Temple, Blackrock, Dire Maul, Scholo and Strath.  The journey to the instances forged more stories and fun than I could ever remember and I'm looking forward to doing it again.
---
i bet you could pick any class and i'd beat you in pvp with the "worst class in vanilla wow" 100% of the time
---
then i can call your class "the worst class in vanilla wow"
---
No, it's just you.
---
Yes, we did.
---
Because there is so many high IQ gentlemen on this sub reddit
---
Games have long tried to create virtual worlds. One of the classics in this area is Ultima VII, which did a great job at portraying a place that could pass off believably enough as a little world inside your computer. While Ultima VII was a single player game, this of course was a core feature of MMOs and also carried over into Ultima Online.
---
Our familiar concept of the world is not one of a myriad of parallel dimensions, so we of course will reject that per default. Would you accept NPCs and monsters in Skyrim constantly teleporting in and out of parallel dimensions this way? Of course not.
---
You can of course make exceptions in fantasy and science fiction stories. For example, a Star Trek episode can revolve around the characters finding a portal into a parallel universe. But this only works if the characters in the two worlds respond to it and if it makes sense within the specific story, and is usually best kept as an exception to the rule.
---
The community only exists because the game promotes social interaction. Retail is not more toxic, maybe even less.
---
I'd love that but alas we are probably in the vast, vast minority on that.
---
I used to not be able to load into Shattrath in BC when it was populated.  If I hearthed to take a portal to somewhere else while leveling, it was just crash the game and I couldn't log in for a bit.
---
thx for info
---
he must have a mouse in his pocket
---
Ayyy Scholomance
---
You thought we didn't, but we did.
---
Oh snap, meaning you once you hit the Execute % you swapped to these to take advantage of their... Oh man that's the clever min/maxing I live for!
---
Yea, I know it with happen but I'd love it. I would also love all raids to be buffed a lot and maybe even see rated battlegrounds. But again, a minority.
---
It's basically just "keep your head straight".
---
Would be really cool if Blizzard did a one-off actually difficult mini raid like that. Similar to Crucible for example. Just to see how the top end guilds dealt with it. Especially now with streaming and all that.
---
I don’t think this is correct.
---
The reason the pricing model is the way it is, is so retail players can fuck around in classic in between patches when they normally unsub for a month.  
---
It’s quite the opposite, it’s to keep retail players subbed.
---
Brings a tear to my eye... could just be that music also.
---
Kk thx, I haven't played Classic myself so I don't really know much of the old stuff. :)
---
It'll be years until naxx comes out
---
On the contrary, I think you've brought a lot of interesting points to this discussion and I'm glad you're making them. But on a pvp server,  red is, and always will be, dead. If people understood that it would save them untold stress and pain attempting to undergo the sisyphean feat of trying to take the pvp out of a pvp server, even for a righteous cause. Red is dead, now and always.
---
You didn't lie about it being extensive. I hope sitting through it will give you and your research colleagues some interesting data points to draw your conclusions from.
---
Definitely echoing someone else's statement about the better question in regards to how much time you invest, would have been: normally. I think on this sub a lot of people might currently be gaming a lot less than they regularly would, due to the fact, that we are all waiting for Classic.
---
Most people never got past BWL, so never even saw those tokens.
---
Lots and lots of people got into Karazhan, though.
---
As a paladin I'd roll a shaman I guess but I'd be fucking mad about it because holy paladins are &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shamans.
---
OrSacholomance - if you ran the quest chain outside scholo without an optimized run, you’d have to clear it like 6 times.  Even if you do, the chain has you killing Ras two times.  So wonky.  I love it
---
Every dude is doing this lol. Been doing nonstop work for months.
---
lol
---
This is just plain false. $15 a month is plenty of money, I paid $5 for Terraria like 5 years ago and have gotten a lot of entertainment out of it. That is factually a cheaper form of video game entertainment.  
---
Hell, free video games exist, where purchasing things is optional... Making THAT the cheapest form of video game entertainment on the market.  
---
If your argument is based on money paid to times spent playing ratios, then perhaps there is an argument. But the problem there is that the metric changes drastically depending on the player.
---
Orc Locks unite!
---
Literally unplayable
---
Isnt viper sting good against casters? This should  at least make it a 50/50?
---
Pics or it didnt happen
---
I did have both of these on my hunter at one point in vanilla, and they did indeed look badass.
---
Explain what dicking around means?
---
Yeah, because classic uses the Legion backend/API while vanilla used... well vanilla API.
---
Yup. They only get the "important" Feedback the EU CMs forward to them
---
To avoid rage capping and if you're high on threat you would want to cleave, right?
---
22.3 years to be precise.
---
This picture just gave me eye-cancer.
---
Even better: a screenshot of a snapchat of a photo of a screen
---
Yes really. They literally said all you need is a subscription to play classic.

Aside from the things mentioned there, the fact that no NPC exists twice comes to mind.

I actually did not know the answer to this question. So about 2ish weeks ago i googled it and found this answer about 5-10 times on google. 
---
So yes apparently everyone else did.
---
If your worried about 15$ a month, you shouldn’t be playing any sort of video games, you should be focusing on education, trade or whatever skill you need to train in, in order to pay the bills.
---
Roll a hunter!  Even if I don't have it, talented cheetah is faster then mounting up to get to a spot, what, 25 secs away?  This makes me feel a little better then stressing on my way to 40.
---
Wow what an original thread
---
A shitty loot system doesn't do much to progress your guild.  Also people aren't under some sortnof obligation to stay with the same guild from MC to Naxx.  A good system rewards people based on their contribution and  gives loot to those who will most help the guild.
---
Noted and corrected.
---
All the time, but I'm old and creaky.  I find it disrespectful to just call someone by their class names.
---
I dunno man, 50 cents a day is dirt-cheap in my book.
---
I hope either blizzard or some other company realize all the things wow classic nerds have been talking about is actually true and make a game for them.
---
Fuck that, i pve to pvp.
---
Honestly I’d prefer they use the chance to start fresh and give the whole expansion thing another think. Like what would they do if they could do it over? A whole new experience.
---
Read this in Hemet Nesingwary's voice
---
Tokens will absolutely ruin the experience. The money shortage is part and parcel of leveling up. Choosing to buy a new skill, or save for a mount. etc etc etc If tokens are available, there will be no real reason to farm rare anything. No real competition in the market. All sorts of horrid things happen to the economy, Gold becomes worthless.
---
Gold sellers, and more importantly gold buyers, risk a perma-ban (and yes...they did, and will, ban buyers), so it's on their heads. I'd rather just put up with the annoyance of ignoring someone than have tokens put in.
---
You need to outline a budget instead of saying medium quality build.  With a budget people can squeak out a lot more performance per dollar than just posting a build and then you short changing parts to try and come under a certain dollar figure.
---
What are you willing to spend, and what parts do you have already as well.
---
BRD for sure. I lost track of how many times you had to go in the instance then leave then go back in over and over
---
The problem would be the raid will have certain debuts they always want up and even it the stone strike debuff is there for half a second it will knock off a debuff they raid wanted up, so likely would be a no go unfortunately. I may be wrong though as I have never used this item
---
What is try hard about giving items to the people who can make the most use out of them?!?! People don't play for aesthetics they play for stats and there are much better weapons to give rogues.
---
If I was a tank and saw the guild give a Thunderfury to a rogue I would gquit. Not to mention thunderfury is impossible to get without multiple people cooperating for the sake of one dude. 40 people won't be willing to help one dude get an aesthetic upgrade.
---
It's actually insane how many do this. I can accept this when you name yourself like ttv.whatever. But the spam is just annoying. I think what game developers could consider is making digital adverts you can buy/rent. Like f.e. in Star Citizen there will be millions of km\^2 of walls n stuff you could place adverts on.  Then Streamers n stuff could buy those to advertise themselves instead of spaming your face.
---
I say this as one of them who will never do this spam stuff. I don't think it helps the Streamer on any reasonable level. Also there are enough places to advertise yourself without annoying people.
---
Then you vanish or fd or iceblock and when they get aggro you mine it.
---
He's Horde, they aren't known for their literacy.
---
looks like a real screenshot from back in the day, only better graphics.
---
Did you also pee my pants or was that somebody else
---
So I’m no pro but I’ve played hunter for 14 years and I’ll tell you a trick I just picked up- 
---
Binding pet attack/follow to mouse-wheel up and down, respectively.
---
It’s so smooth and feels so badass. As for the other stuff, it sounds like you’ve done your prep, you’ll iron out the rest once you’re playing. If the best hunter is still below the mages on an AQ damage meter, he/she  still may be a much better player. Apples vs oranges
---
MY STAFF IS A GOOD ONE
---
I DONT LIKE TO STRESS THE FACT THAT THE WARLOCK ROCKS, BUT HE JUS DOES,SO, FOR ALL YOU STAFF USERS OUT THERE, FEEL FREE TO COME IN AND POST, MY STAFF IS A GOOD ONE BUT HERE IS HOW IT GOES
---
1. POST MESSAGE IN THE ROOM
---
2. look it over
---
3. DONT REPORT ANYTHING, I MIGHT GET IN TROUBLE :)
---
AND 4. HAVE FUN!!!! 
---
\[EDIT -  OK, GUYS, HOW SIMPLE CAN YOU BE? ITS A %&amp;\*%ING TOPIC ABOUT STAFF USERS, IF YOUR NOT A STAFF USER, GET YOUR ASS OUT!!!!!! JESUS!!! \]
---
Settle down, I haven't entered a game key since 2008. 
---
I googled how much will wow classic cost....  $15 per month with the current game
---
The fascist guild leaders get shit done! I was in a friendly guild prior to the one I mentioned above and we didn't get very far. I'd rather be goose stepping my way to progression under the leadership of some conniving dickhead than languishing in MC / Vael for eternity.
---
It's from the old saying " Keep your feet on the ground, and your head out of the clouds." Be stable and realistic.
---
give this guy a silver
---
Link to where they will announce?
---
Newer doesn't mean better and those other games will always be around. Classic wow is the kind of thing you can miss out on as it won't be around forever.
---
Oh no it’s not just you. I remember to even join a raiding guild on my server you had to have a certain amount of FR.  Part of it I think was just a check box to see how capable you were.
---
The fact that you picked such a niche thing to not look forward to, such as the objectively more obtrusive “TTV” character names...which I’ve never seen in my life; I’ve seen link spamming and TTV names in CSGO or Fortnite but never as a wow name....
---
The only thing that will reduce toxicity in the classic community will be age of players.  Average age of a classic player is going to be way higher than most online games.  I've said this story before, but I took a break from online gaming then the first game I came back to was Overwatch and that was by far the most toxic cesspool of a community I have ever seen.  So I don't know if it's a generational issue or that game specifically, would be interesting to compare.
---
Dude.. that's the digital version of being cheated by your girlfriend/fiance/wife while deployed.
---
I agree but just for the increase in beard detail.
---
What!? I would get the bottle but never do anything further. 
---
It sounds like a great quest i missed out on
---
Reported for spam.
---
I'd rather be able to level up as a Warlock without getting fear broken and than have a measly 5% more mana I can life tap.
---
C2 for me.  I'll obviously have a bank alt, but I won't spend a tremendous amount of time on that character other that sitting there scanning the AH at the end of a session.  When time is short and I just want something to do before doing something else, I'll roll characters to get to level 5-6 before abandoning.  Most of my time will be spent on my main.
---
I’m expecting a MC clear the top 5 guilds, that should accelerate the timeline but without an official word it’s anyone’s guess.
---
From my original guild there was a core group of guildies that I kept in touch with sporadically. Just randomly contacted them again and a lot of them are coming back for classic so I’ll be playing with them again.
---
Lets face it, some of those guildies are going to be wankers though. Or mages even.
---
It's still OK to hate them, right?
---
One time a guy said he'd make sure I never raided with his guild because he didn't like how I priced something on the auction house.  That was pretty funny.
---
There was one server where hundreds of players went to the croc island in the middle or Loch Modan after Steve died.  So many wee little skeletons on the island. 
---
RIP Steve.
---
I want my silver back if this gets taken down!!!!!
---
I have 3 friends from Vanilla that spilled over to RL friendship and remain so today, but I would say our friendship really blossomed in TBC when 1 of them took over as GM and the rest of us moved into officer roles. We ran the guild together from early TBC through Wrath (they continued into Cata without me). The one who became GM was originally a hunter but took over our warrior MT's account when he quit in TBC (as well as GM). Eventually he swapped his main to druid and MT'd as a bear. Second was a priest all the way through. Third was the original OT warrior in Vanilla - he quit raiding early into TBC but because he knew the other 2 IRL we became good friends outside of WoW.
---
In Vanilla itself, I was closest with 3 other mages in the guild as we chatted ALL the time in mage channel, but I would say I was pretty good friends with about half the guild back then - I remember buying WC3 just to play DOTA with a bunch of them. I barely conversed with people outside the guild.
---
My favorite moment in all my time playing WoW was when I was tanking a Zul'Aman timed run on my paladin alt with the aforementioned priest healing. On the way to the bear boss our 2nd healer DC'd, but we couldn't afford to wait in the middle of a timed run so we tried to 1 heal it. Basically sacrificed the 2nd tank to the bleed and then 1 heal 1 tanked most of the fight by using stoneform and BOP to deal with it. That healer made it back online after the boss and we successfully finished the run on time.
---
I think your severely misunderstanding what hes saying or just fallaciously misinterpreting, resources do respawn meaning they are infinite but they arnt personal which makes them a much more highly regarded commodity and gives value to them. You can wait 5 minutes for a respawn timer if your goal is to mine the absolute least amount of mats in the same amount of time and people who are lazy will do this.            
---
            
---
You CAN go farm as much for as long as you want BUT unlike retail your also competing with others which means maybe you get 100x Thorium an hour, maybe you only get 50x, hell maybe your only able to nab 10x due to how many other miners are in the area. Where in retail there is zero competition for nodes and it's all just for you, which allows for multiboxing farmers to flush the market with materials which tremendously decreases the value of those mats and the items which require them.            
---
           
---
There are nodes in instances and also elite mobs guarding them so good luck solo farming them. Same for chests. Again when hes talking about mobs not being instanced hes talking tagging a mob/boss outside of an instance which rewards you loot even if you only do 1 damage to it which again makes those items more valuable and even the ones inside an instance is shared between 5 people (normally) I cant tell if your trolling or simply this ignorant.
---
Im sorry, but are you on 56k dial up and using internet explorer 2? This is something from 2 months ago...
---
But yeah. maybe they make it like it used to be.
---
I know this feeling. I'll safe them a few times. If they keep making the exact same mistake too many times I'll just whisper the heal to stop healing and wait.
---
Yeah, if I meet a person that puts vegan into all of their names, I'm glad BNet friends list is around so I can block the whole account and not just the one character.
---
Have we really not received a Blizz response at all on this one yet?
---
I mean it definitely seems like a minor thing but I agree - it really adds a lot of depth to the world. The ridiculous skelly piles on top of Nessingwary were always a great warning sign.
---

**[EU German Raiding] &lt;plaGue&gt; [Alliance]**
---
**About us:**
---
&lt;plaGue&gt; is a large **german speaking** group of friends that have been playing WoW on and off since Vanilla. With every reentry to WoW we have rebuilt the guild and raidteam, growing our group to a community of skilled raiders always curious of what new stuff WoW has to offer. We have a wide range of people, from old &lt;For the Horde&gt; raiders, all the way to world rank 1000 players.
---
**Expectations:**
---
With an experienced Leadership, who has raided in Vanilla up to and including Naxx, our number one goal is to build a community that enjoys spending the evening together, while clearing the raid content in a timely fashion.
---
We are recruiting chill experienced raiders, looking to have a good time. Lacking experience in Vanilla is no problem, as long as you have decent raiding experience in any expansion.
---
Currently our raiding roster is getting close to 40 people, but still has room for any dedicated player of any class. We are aiming at an active raiding roster of 50-60 people, to ensure a smooth experience for all of our raiders.
---
Wednesday and Monday  20:00 - 24:00

Do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.
---
Christ, that looks like a genocide.
---
It was more like guilds were blacklisted. 
---
Kinda like now people on proudmore avoid grouping up with Eternal Kingdom.
---
I would have made an effort to raid with his guild.
---
I don’t understand
---
Lol, I can't believe this received an award, especially after reading all the posts this guy made in here bashing people for knowing something he thought was previously unknown but could've been googled in 20 seconds.
---
It's not about being unable afford $15 a month, it's if that $15 is worth it for the product I'm paying for and if the product is arguably worth that much money. That's $180 a year on a single video game that is 15 years old... Anyone who says that isn't a pretty steep cost for what you get is hard into the rose-tinted goggles.
---
we had a Chinese farmer named skyboy that got blacklisted 
---
he was just to annoying 
---
we also received a ton of transfers from Arthas I think some of those guys got black listed because they just thought they were hot shit comming from a big over populated server to our little po dunk server
---
Just buy one of those slings to hold the baby to your chest and free up your other hand. 
---
Unless you meant masturbating to the old Sylvanas model
---
The slower the weapon speed, the higher the damage per hit. With classes like rogues that have instant attacks, weapon speed is negated.
---
Be a Warrior and get paid for every click I make.
---
&gt; Where in retail there is zero competition for nodes and it's all just for you, which allows for multiboxing farmers to flush the market with materials which tremendously decreases the value of those mats and the items which require them.
---
Ah.  I don't retail.
---
You keep doing you! I respect this guy’s opinion but appreciate you spreading the good word of etiquette. There will always be greedy scoundrels and excessively kind folks alike - never hurts to try to tip the scales
---
&gt; I googled how much will wow classic cost.... $15 per month ~~with the current game~~
---
FTFY
---
The AQ war effort had bandage turn-ins that gave various City rep for your faction, but there were also Cloth Quartermasters in each city that took plain cloth turn-ins for City rep as well. The AQ bandage turn-ins actually gave a bit more reputation than the regular quartermasters did, so you could do it more cheaply during that period, while also contributing to the overall war effort progress.
---
I'm not sure if your being /s or not. But it seriously is way too much money. lol
---
I would hope Blizzard has a lower tolerance for that shit than the pservers I was on.   I'll take the same 20 jokes about Chuck Norris over a sincere discussion about "The Jewish Question" any day.
---
Nelf priest is a lot of fun in pvp. I also played troll and UD, but nelf was the most fun. MC out of shadowmeld has a lot of uses.
---
&gt; Google can provide the answer so your assumption that it couldn't was incorrect.
---
That wasn't my assumption.
---
I'd advise you read what I said again, because if you start on a strawman (again) then the rest is automatically false.
---
Top 5 guild's is an incredibly small fraction of player pop. If they cared about progression for 1%ers they would have killed of layering sooner. Anyones guess though your confident reply just got me hyped haha
---
Pally is boring. BUT boring =/= slow. My last solo pally on Pserver was 114 hours.
---
This is heavily dependent on server pop. On low to medium pop servers it was exceptionally easy to build a reputation, good or bad.
---
I accidentally went to EU forums and stumbled upon it. Don't remember anything about this on the sub, neither on US forums. 
---
Maybe it's worth to repost the thread on US forums too, if Blizz doesn't check EU at all.
---
Same as OP's picture, Feralas. The Ogre ruins, yetis, the wild north with the (at the time) much higher level lobs really made it feel like a wild jungle to me. Also really enjoy dire maul as a bonus, the place got great loot and cool scenery. Plus the fact that it sports 3 of my favorite mobs, nagas, ogres and yetis, makes it such a great place!
---
where the FUCK is the stress test
---
So he pvp'd alot and got carried in the pve raids.  What is your point?
---
You are correct, I was actually thinking of Eye of Nerub. Got the names mixed up
---
No strategy; I'm a warlock.
---
Mind sharing a general rout? That beats my Druid time by about a day and a few hours.
---
I really hope I can stick to one Hunter. I’ll probably cannot avoid alts, but I usually end up with half of them being hunters.
---
Yeah, but don't you see that it's WAY more important they not let Rag submerge a second time?
---
When blizzard announced how you could access wow classic, they clearly said “all you need is an active wow sub and nothing else”. The nothing else part is the part I think you missed.
---
I sort of agree with this actually. Since blizz is making it progressive, you can miss out on certain aspects that made the game so cool... As opposed to old school RS which is just a game frozen in time.
---
I've got through 3 Nagas. The Venus reads '8' or '9' as '89', which basically means 9 is unusable. But it's still more reliable than a Naga, and half the price.
---
&gt; Gonna be really damn hard to justify spending the money on the full sub for just classic.
---
Don't play then if it isn't worth it to you.
---
Maybe people thought you were a hilarious asshole? You can be a total dick if it’s funny.
---
I watch Asmongold highlights and he's pretty cool.  His humor is kind of acting like an elitist and pretending he doesn't make mistakes.  Unlike Soda, Asmon doesn't look or act like he wants to off himself every other hour.
---
69 just blaze 420 YOLO!!!!
---
1g/5g/10g/25g/50g I think
---
You get legion access with a subscription, you have to purchase BfA if you want access to it.
---
This depends entirely on your group.  I was I'm some pug groups during beta where I ended up in the graveyard.  Now as time goes on it is less likely to happen, but early going you're still going to be dealing with players from retail who never experienced the vanilla dungeons and think CC is a dirty word.
---
Orc is superior in all ways
---
Holy shit I'm just going to play at night after my kids go to bed.  I will be doomed to mediocrity.
---
It's not like this sort of attitude didn't prevail through Vanilla as well. The only difference is now people actually know what they're talking about. Back in Vanilla Retail, people were elitist and trying to min max, but all they had to go on was "the guy in Guild X says to do this" and straight meter whoring. Now all the "semi hardcore" guilds full of min maxers who still suck at the game have 15 years of theorycrafting and youtube videos to parrot.
---
So you are saying that in order for it to be worth $15 I need to play **two hours a month**?  Where the hell am I going to find that kind of time?
---
If you all would stop arguing about semantics, and just speak to the point, you might not have to type so much for no reason. 
---
&gt; It's not finite because if I run it enough times I'll get everything I want. 
---
Correct, it's note finite, it's just restricted to the point that things become much more competitive in many ways, making it *feel* more like every item you farm is taking an item from another player. The *feel* is definitely different than retail, and world cohesion is about feeling, so I don't get why there's so much dispute about it.
---
Well done.
---
Nothing is a surprise anymore. My main issue is most games come out and i feel like ive already seen everything via trailers and demos. About 2 years ago i cut myself off from spoilers accross the board. (Working 60 hr weeks helps). I just want things to feel new and exciting and i feel like if a game doesn't release with trailers of what the DLC is going to be already on day one no one buys it anymore. Its too much information before i can take it in myself and dislike it heavily.
---
&gt; but there are so many other games that are newer I could spend the money on.
---
So do that then.
---
you are right, what am i thinking! we need more nostalgia screenshots instead! doh!
---
neither did he =P
---
Alliance used to be children but now we are adults and the Horde are the kids now.
---
I would argue rather than this girl being immortalized, the notion that someones memorial was crashed in wow was what was immortalized. Her death was merely an instrument that gave the event form, no one really brings up her memory specifically. 
---
It's probably more apt to suggest it's more of a immortalization of Serenity Now.
---
&gt; As a leader of a Roleplaying guild
---
&gt; None of you people have any idea what you're talking about :)
---
​&gt; Now I've made multiple posts explaining this, so don't mind me that I won't do it all over again. You are all flat tires and the sooner Classic rolls around, the sooner you can all shut your trash chutes.
---
Signs off his posts with "gg ez"
---
Man this guy is on another level LOL
---
Better a knife at home than a gun at school, amirite?
---
As someone who is going mage for the first time in classic, thank you.   
---
The doc sheet that was shared is incredible.
---
That baby is a heavy sleeper look at that face rofl
---
Its not common in 5 mans until it gets really hard so I think you will be ok. On the other hand, a lot of people are in their guild disc at the same time so chat is pretty rare too. I imagine chat will be better for classic at launch but slide to to more of the retail style over time as people learn the content. Just a guess though.
---
It's progressive but also people will grow tired of it in a year or two. The game will be filled with players at launch but those numbers will surely dwindle. Although I could see Blizz starting some fresh servers after a year or two.
---
To me WoW is the best game ever made and it is worth the price. If it isn't for you then definitely don't buy it.
---
Whats the correct 10%
---
See post 43 mins ago entitled "no game licence needed for classic wow" should answer your question
---
Why do you say that? Battle grounds weren’t even a part of the first iteration of vanilla.
---
The Shaman rock where u get your first totem. When they let you queue arena from anywhere that is always where I would go. No players ever there anymore so it was less lag and there is a 0.0001 chance of getting ganked there in between queues.
---
**[EU Alliance German] 5 man dungeon leveling group**
---
**Our goal**
---
We want push to max level in the first 7 days of the launch. The majority of our exp will come through grinding instances, 
---
while also doing certain quests/quest hubs along the way. 
---
You can check out this video for a ruff understanding of how we will level: youtu.be/GXPu3jEZ0-I 
---
We have done our own optimizations to that route.
---
We are a group of 4 friends that have all been playing wow since around TBC. 
---
Some of us have focused more on raiding, achieving multiple realm firsts and world top 100 ranks, while others have focused more on optimizing the leveling part of the game.
---
We are looking for a chill and experienced player, looking to have a good time.
---
Currently our group roster consists of:
---
- Warrior Tank
---
- Priest Heal
---
- Warrior DPS
---
- Mage
---
We are looking for 1 dedicated player. Class preference would be a Warlock, but other classes will also be considered, since the person playing is the more important part.
---
**Play Times:**
---
Launch day: 00:00 - 22:00 CET
---
All further days: 08:00 - 00:00 CET
---
Times may vary slightly, if all 5 of us agree on it.
---
Discord:      Cereal#8692

with 6 different watermarks.
---
Don't play then.  No one cares.  If it's unfair *to you*, vote with your wallet.  I'm going to vote with mine and play Classic.
---
Yes, but it's not a bad post until you see 60 other people doing the same thing...
---
I was like 14 when I started vanilla and I’m now almost 29. I more so agree with you that it’s probably how the game has drastically changed. But there’s definitely a different generation playing.
---
Playing a warlock
---
And you can easily just not install them and enjoy the game the way you want. I, however like those addons and should not be forced by Blizz to not use them just because some people don’t like them.
---
&gt; It seems that Classic Beta’s Skeletons/corpses work the same was as retail/BFA’s does, and obviously that’s not Vanilla.
---
So there's no actual proof other than feelings? Quality post.
---
Sure mc and ony will be faceroll once people are getting carried by their guild in bwl gear.
---
But when your raids shows up to mc in leveling greens with no resist gear you will not be having a good time.
---
Me neither but I learned quite a lot today about how the meaning of online space for different people
---
This will pretty much be STV in every PvP server, about two weeks after release or so. It's the BEST
---
Oh, we had some guy ninja baron rivendares mount on alliance side on Dragonblight EU, can’t remember the name though
---
You west coast? Im in need of a guild like this. Rolling a lock and a resto shaman. Primarily a pvp healer.
---
In aq40 and naxx which most people won't see.
---
**I mean either the entire** reddit is correct about “we already knew” and you were wrong. **OR** All 156,198 classic reddit users are wrong and you’re the only one that is correct.
---
Ill let you be the judge on this.
---
I actually got here from the Rams sub. I was super confused.
---
PvP in wow is one of my favorite things to do but I hate the ranking system in vanilla. It rewards time invested more than skill and the rewards aren’t even that great. I also don’t like that there’s a limit to how many debuffs you can apply in raids. It’s not a fun mechanic and it limits the game in a needlessly arbitrary way.
---
&gt; Is there or is there not a sense of "world cohesion" in vanilla WoW that is not present in retail?
---
How would I know?  I don't play retail.
---
I'm actually FAR better now then I was back then. Pservers helped with that quite a bit, but also knowing a lot more mechanics that go into each class.
---
Steady shot.
---
Yeah, if they have right click ignore my life will be so much easier, especially if they clamp down on spammers.
---
Winterspring
---
That's exactly his point, that's why no one will be using FR except the tanks anymore.
---
Exactly what I said, league of legends was a great game until the young trolls came through, same with overwatch. Wow was a great game too.
---
discord is often required in LFG postings for mythic+ and raids in live yea
---
It’s not a wash. Orc is superior all the way are you even kidding. Especially with rogues beeing somewhat of a counter.
---
It’s fine if you prefer UD. Personally i think UD fits way better to warlocks style wise. But there’s no use in trying to pretend that it’s because of racials.
---
It's a tough fight for both, but it must be done to show this man that his traitorous ways will not go unseen. Breaking the Rogue Code will not be taken lightly.
---
Right.. that's the exact same argument used for heirlooms, lfr, etc. " if you dont like how easy something is, just take the hard road". Suggesting that people won't always take the path or least resistance is stupid. No one is going to artificially put themselves at a major disadvantage in an online game...c'mon man.. also, what could you possibly need those addons for in classic ?
---
[Here you go fellow druid!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y-oXmau5zcI_hRD_Kt0XnwJV80gwUBLRwqNBaLoSKBQ/edit#gid=0)
---
Note it is a work in progress, and every other day my guild mate comes on the discord saying he added this or that. He hopes to have it done by launch. Loads of good information in there already, and if you bookmark it and come back later there will be more good info!
---
Thats kinda depressing to read tbh
---
There’s at least 2 of us Rams/wow fans!
---
Zug zug
---
I got field marshal rank 13 as a night elf shadow priest back then in the day. Personally I did it because I was like 15 and elves looked cool. But shadowmeld was extremely useful. Shadowmeld fear combo was a great opener in many situations. I personally didn’t mind elunes grace but it wasn’t really that great. Starshards was memetastic.
---
I’d go dwarf if I did it again because rearward, desperate prayer, and stoneform are too useful to pass up. But night elf got the job done.

If you want to tank as a paladin while leveling get consecration asap it is the only way for you to keep agro from healers in 3+mobs pulls. This however will gimp your levelling speed so consider respecing at 40 and tank from there you will probably be able to aoe farm at that level. Alsow to be a good tank at low levels you need engineering and a shildspike as for gear use your normal dps gear str/stam if you find some hig int gear you can wear a piece or two. In essence a paladin can heal in any spec do damage in any spec but you need to have a certain spec to tank.
---
To each their own I guess... but world PvP is much much more than “being ganked and corpse camped”
---
WHERE CAN WE WATCH?
---
Go shadowpriest
---
Well if it doesn't happen, that's great.  I see it all the time in games.  If you read into my comment, I'm not looking forward to a small and insignificant thing.  Ergo, I'm actually looking forward to WoW: Classic.
---
No one is saying you are wrong for voicing it.  There is just no benefit in doing so.
---
"EU": The sound Blizzard employees makes when they read a post on the EU forums.
---
This is just bad play. It would be much better to immediately activate WotF once they fear you - that way your immunity lasts longer and you get fear on DR.
---
Whattttt? No they didn't? Definitely never saw that on any of my Vanilla servers. And that's definitely not why it was changed. It was changed because popular world PVP areas (Hillsbrad mostly) became unplayable lagfests because the game was trying to render thousands of skeletons...
---
I don't like the current asmon , I used to love his YT videos before he became a twitch household name 
---
I've always loved soda but feel it's hard to continue to be yourself (even your stream self) with the type of Fame they receive just from playing a video game 
---
I would watch soda a lot more if I was interested in druid, but my main classic beta streamer was venruki then payo
---
Seconded. As a software dev, my team has a huge problem with last minute requirements being forced by the business side. I'm talking not just days before a release code freeze, but weeks after regression... right as Betas are going out. We'll finish the new work just a few days before the actual release. Business people be freaking crazy. It is rarely a decision made by the people writing the code.
---
Change to king looter?
---
Running laps around the race track in 1k Needles, driving turtles, basilisks and vultures to verge of extinction.
---
HUGE update is coming soon. Gear for every boss drop and how they rank for each spec. Here's a preview: [https://i.imgur.com/BLmao0I.png](https://i.imgur.com/BLmao0I.png)
---
Banish, healthstones, ...
---
The decrepit gates leading to raven hill.
---
Lol It's a joke. Calm down.
---
AWW!!!
---
The title is misleading. If you have a wow account with a subscription you have a game licence.
---
What would I not want those addons for? I plan on leveling as fast as I can to 60 at launch and want to do it with an optimal route so a quest helper will be helpful there. Deadly boss mods will be great for raiding for me. I played in vanilla but didnt raid at all until TBC so it will be nice to have call outs for what I need to be aware of. Weak Auras is awesome for watching my own buffs for timing abilities correctly, yeah I can look in the top right of my 30 inch monitor, or I can not have to look that far up and keep the buffs in the center of my screen so I can play more optimally.
---
Tokens don't remove gold selling, they only cap the price.
---
We as a community fought for spell batching and now when we won ppl start to complain. You needed to speak up when the issue was first brought up
---
Not really. It doesn't belong in any game. Only in instanced battleground settings. Period. Keep that shit where it belongs.
---
Disengage jump is going to be hard to unlearn. I have it bound to mouse 5 so I can quickly hit it to stop fall damage or when kiting
---
People that end every message with :) give me the cringies
---
Well. Ima play prob 15 hours a week.
---
So 23 cents an hour for entertainment- in fact does not seem ridiculous to me.
---
SoJ on Barthilas ninja'd the bindings someone needed for a set and then gquit. He pretty much left all the guilds in shambles where he went but you can always find someone new to raid with.
---
Nope. The very first thing I'll check in the setting is that voice chat is off.
---
I *might* go to the realm discord though. I just don't want to risk having the in game voice chat on, ever.
---
You should write an addon that makes pins on the map for wherever you have died.
---
We did. Last I checked the skeletons on beta were completely reset everytime they restarted the servers or took it down for some reason.
---
EVERY reset, EVERY time. Thats why skeletons in the beta never piled up. Once it goes live we shouldnt be seeing server reboots and hotfixes every 30 hours the way we seemingly did during beta. That should fix the skeletons.
---
Not sure why no one is pointing this out.
---
Whats an ez and legal way to making money without a job!?
---
His name was Robert Paulson.
---
That and gadgetzan, oh for the crazy days of finding all the little loopholes where you could get on the roof and kill people without getting one shotted by the guards.
---
Yes! I make specs over and over trying to theorycraft druids and shamans.
---
I love you, thank you for this.
---
Going to be super helpful.
---
It's been repeated a million times, especially in a forum where hardcore fans hangout. Been known for a good while. Thanks for sharing anyways
---
Yikes. Adding TTV to your name is a good way to get camped a lot I feel like.
---
That's my point about ZG.  You can run it all the time so getting the two swords isn't very hard to do.
---
You can have some really bad luck with the 1 time a week raids.
---
No problem butthead9181!
---
I just don’t follow your logic... I might get ganked so therefore No1 deserves to enjoy engaging in world player vs player combat?  You need your hand held too?
---
Now that's something I feel Discord would make it more of a pain in the ass because everyone wants to "grow their community" so you're met with a shit load of Discords. 
---
I still hope there's just one "catch-em-all" server that puts everything from PUG raids, LFG, specific core farming like Orb or DM Jump runs, BGs, etc.  I don't really see how all of those need to be their own separate discords.
---
I also feel that Private servers have a bit more global audience since it was one server across the world.  You also had more players in general on one single private server, so it might make sense why communities split up.
---
I have the same plan ;p
---
they had a contest to go with this where you were asked to send in a screenshot. I can't remember the requirements specifically, but I know if I search through my old gmail account I can find a picture of my lvl 60 undead priest /dancing with a random doomguard that spawned outside of orgrimmar
---
I filled a dps role for a bit in tbc, two patches in cata and during 2 short pserver stints. Other than that, healer through and through, same for classic.
---
Mages rush you down, warlocks and SPriests tank you out while outdamaging you.
---
We fought specifically for spellbatching there are loads of YouTube videos asking for it, lots of content creators made comments about it aswell there sould be a couple of old threads here aswell asking for it
---
That doesn't look like the Wailing Caverns pond.
---
Don't remember the names but part of the reason I got into the 2nd best guild on the server was a group of ~15 people ninja looted a few BOE's from MC and immediately transferred servers. It was during a brief window where Blizzard was trying to get people off high pop servers and onto lower pop servers. They were disgruntled about something and thought they could start their own guild there - which they did but never caught up to the original guild. I guess they would have been blacklisted if they stayed on the server.
---
Just start streaming ;D
---
Since the only game license you can buy is BFA, and we knew you didn't need BFA. We knew, close to everyone knew
---
I hope J Allen Brack reads this document and realizes the turd sandwich he's created.
---
I think people have had their accounts banned for stream sniping. 
---
There was some issues where a player would getting suspended/banned for killing/camping a streamer, even if that person had no idea. 
---
So it’s kind of grey area. I think as long as you’re not stalking the person, they can’t get you for harassment. 
---
I’m not sure what the “legality” of it is at this point. But personally, I think if you’re going to stream on a PvP server. You had better put a delay on. Otherwise you’re asking for it.
---
THIS IS WONDERFUL NEWS!
---
Unless you’re one of the best players in the world I don’t see why anyone would want to watch some rando play a game.
---
*Good news, everyone!*
---
2 of the same class is absolute lunacy
---
I went out of my way to help people get better at a video game, I'm not sure how much dopamine is supposed to be "rushing", but I suppose I did.
---
Sounds like you want to play BFA
---
Particularly for me the building southeast of Astranaar.  Such a peaceful little area.  Feels like a pleasant spring evening to me.
---
Sure, I'm not forced to use those addons so I don't care if they are around or not. [There already is an LFD addon by the way.](https://github.com/insaneKane/wow-classic-lfg-lfr). You're picking a fight you're not going to win here.
---
You do you, and I'll do me. If you dont want addons dont use them. But I'm gonna and I'll enjoy them.
---
By the way, discord wasnt intended to be used by Blizzard either, so you better not use that to talk to any friends while playing. ;)
---
Healing in MMOs is akin to the sails on a sailboat. Everyone loves to admire the woodwork/frame (Tank/Dps), but the boat isn't moving without the sails (Heals).
---
Healing is a pleasure in the right setting. In 5-Mans, you grease the cogs by allowing the group to move along efficiently and who doesn't love some efficiency? In Raids, like good tanks, you will always be desired and therefore never really stress about not getting an invite.
---
I levelled a dwarf hunter just to play through Dun’Morough and loch modan
---
Going to need a bigger map, imo
---
How is this at all relevant to this thread?  Stress test isn't designed to catch issues like this.
---
Do you want to raid or play serious/hardcore pvp? You need a mic. You can get a cheap one from Walmart for like $15.
---
Do you intend to mostly just level up, play casually, and not participate in end game content?
---
You probably can get by without a mic.
---
Itemization in vanilla is more interesting for a few reasons. But from an endgame perspective, vanilla nor live are the best it’s been. 
---
The wide variety of itemization in vanilla was fun because we were figuring it out ostensibly at the same time the devs were. 
---
Further, it was interesting cause once you figured it out, the gear wasn’t there initially to do what you wanted...you couldn’t hit cap, you couldn’t get enough crit to make fire worth it...
---
But as you played specs opened up...as you got better gear it made old items you couldn’t afford to wear equippable.
---
Personally, % points for crit, hit, parry, etc. are the most aesthetically pleasing. 
---
Finally, hit is a great mechanic. It makes items useful for long periods of time, constraints your decision making forcing at least an interesting choice...(do I sit at hit cap or go 1% below for 1% crit?—or later in WoW haste, mastery, Vers). That’s not only more interesting than do I take haste/crit or mastery/haste? But there’s no reason that discussion can’t also be happening on pieces that don’t have hit.
---
Finally, loot is rare in vanilla, 2-3 drops per boss 11 bosses in first tier. You’re not going to get BIS. You will probably not only use certain pieces for a long time, but some of them will even be suboptimal for when they were current.
---
The first time I saw Orgrimmar I thought it was a high level zone or dungeon. I was afraid to go near it.
---
It's also terrible advice to give to vendor everything you can. What you interpreted it as, clearly by your post, is "vendor all GREYS" but that is a significantly different statement. I chose an extreme example to prove a point, but a newbie will read his post and assume the best strategy when getting a 4str 4 stam green leather belt will be to vendor it, which is terrible.
---
At the end of the day you chose to post your spec here for anybody to comment on it. If you're not looking for criticism that's up to you, but we're allowed to have a discussion just like you're allowed to spec however you like.
---
I'm leveling using nothing but dungeons from 14-60.
---
For me, Classic WoW will be the best entertainment bargain available anywhere.
---
$15 a month? Daaaamn son thats @ 18 pennies AN HOUR if you play 20 hours a week. I'll probably play double that so...
---
Hurry up Blizzard, please take my money! While I'm at it, here's another $15 a month for a second account!
---
Amazing video. Worth the time.
---
Oof and I wanna play warlock..
---
If they blame the tank, sure, but if they are sorry then you should give second chances. Mistakes happen, sometimes you get carried away. Gotta go with the flow to some extent.
---
Sure, it was an hypothetical. The difference is, I, and everyone remotely serious about the game is forced to use these addons. Addons which did not exists remotely close to their modern functionality back then and will ultimately make  naxx easier than modern lfr... how fun...
---
sure...go UD warlock, but ill go gnome mage fosho.   
---
5% intellect is fucking huge in terms of dps, and lvling speed.
---
/raises hand
---
I cannot write WoW addons and Im sure I cannot create RL Addon which shoot pins on our canvas. But yea, that would be cool :D
---
Modern Boss-mods + Weakauras + 15 years of seeing every type of boss mechanic will trivialize so much. I see two things remaining challenging. First is just numbers tuning. Vanilla and BC difficulty was almost entirely a numbers thing. Just gearing for the dps/hps threshold was a much more time consuming chore. Second is threat mechanics, or rather lack of threat generation. While it can still happen, tank threat, especially tank aoe threat has massively increased. The reason Thunderfury is so amazing isn't just that it is cool, but the raw threat generation insanity it created. I remember when my guild's MT got it finished while we were in BWL progression. Broodlord's knockback that cut tank threat (and eventually was a soft enrage as the dps would overtake tank threat) became a joke where the MT would keep overtaking the offtank and threat remained high enough that the dps could go all out.
---
&gt; Getting a raid slot as a meme spec is your reward.
---
So you would seriously have a guy show every night for 2 years to do raids from MC-&gt;Naxx and you are adamant he should never get a single reward? That's pretty fucked dude, I seriously pity anyone who's in a guild with you
---
7th grade IIRC, all my friends were super in to Runescape. We went on a class trip to Cape Cod for a week, and I started talking to this kid I hadn't really talked to before. He starts telling me all about this crazy new game -- a better Runescape. Naturally as soon as I get home I start saving up my allowance to buy it ASAP, and we and a couple of my other friends end up playing together all through the rest of middle and high school. I remember friend #1 played a druid and would only play balance, some of my other friends played an elemental shaman, a warlock and an arms warrior, and I was a tauren hunter with a mulgore wolf that I kept all the way from 10-60
---
If they have a server named Cho'gal, I go there.
---
I had watched a video on the amount of time it would take to get R14.. that seems like it's full neckbeard status and yah there's no way i could put that many hours into the grinding of PvP alone... god damnit. Nonetheless, the goal is to be in a BG where the opposing faction is like.. "Ah shit... here we go again"
---
2?
---
now that i think about it you might actually be right.
---
Its 150x100 cm.
---
Then don't use an absolute term like "everything". What about green belts? Scorpid Blood? The plumes from deadwing pass? There's a ton of shit that's all the way down to white quality you would be a moron to vendor, so giving someone a tip like this without explaining it a little is pointless. Either a newbie reads it and gets the wrong idea, or a veteran reads it and finds it absolutely ridiculously simplified to the point of being useless information.
---
I'd say have everyone do their starting zones and make it to roughly level 10 and then journey to meet in a level 10-20 zone for group stuff.
---
Gives people time to get acquainted with their class/character and of your friends are missing out on their specific race leveling zones at least they will get a taste in the first 10 levels of their "people".
---
It all depends tho. For a true competitive esport, its important to have an equal playing field. I liked that about legion, it was the right direction for what wow arena pvp is these days. That is very much gone in bfa, as there is no transparency on how gear functions in pvp that expansion. 
---
For the sort of pvp that we originally fell in love with in vanilla tho, strenght increase in pvp is important aye, but that sort of pvp could never and should never be made a competitive esport. Or atleast it shouldn't cater to being such by design.
---
add a red string plotting out everywhere you go on your way to 60, so you just end up with a nice red blanket afterwards.
---
Go ahead and think you’ll have fun playing with the people who want to take forever to run a simple dungeon. 
---
You won’t see people who have raided naxx but maybe the people who are only good enough for farming MC will want to play with you
---
Yeah i don't have much to add to that, am in agreement with you. Would be interesting to see if they could do an even better job with classic+ content (something im really hoping for - down the line)
---
KRALNOR IS KING
---
MY STAFF IS ALSO A GOOD ONE
---
he is perfectly putting into words what i am trying to express to my friends for a long time. good job! ty!
---
For sure. It wasn't even as though people had a physical list keeping track. You would just remember these handful of people that seemed to get called out for ninja looting and ignore their LFG spam or ignore their whispers asking to join your group.
---
&gt;That's incredible, very well done.
---
I know right?  I messaged him stating how unbelievably clear and concise it was.  I struggle with organizing concepts, and he just hit the ball out of the park.  The Warlocks do have a really nice Discord channel, but nothing I've seen quite like this.
---
&gt;The doc sheet that was shared is incredible.
---
Yeah, the guy is just really well-focused or something.  Great work.
---
Warrior just synergises better with paladin though.  But of course you can level with any other class in duo.
---
Lookin like Pops Malone over here - really though congrats on your brand new Razer Naga
---
It's 1/5/10/...   
---
So if you respec to balance at 25, and then at 30 decide you want to go back to feral, that'll be 5g. And then if you decide you want to go to boomkin at 40 it'll be 10g. So yeah it adds up really fast while levelling. The first one is obviously cheap at 1g, but everyone after that is pretty annoying considering most people will be stretching hard to get a mount by lvl 42 (depending on how fast they level).
---
yeah that's where it's 100% ninja'd but if you were to roll and win nobody should ever blame for that
---
Apparently that's a Legion item
---
I've never had someone camp me.  Idk why that is, but it's literally never happened.  I get killed once and they usually move on.  If they're just killing people, I change zones and do something else for a bit.  It's really not a big deal.

**Risen | NA-PvP | Alliance**
---
**Raid Schedule:**
---
First team (Hardcore): Tues/Sun, 8pm – 11pm CST 
---
Second team (Semi-Hardcore): Wed/Mon, 7:30pm – 10:30pm CST 
---
Loot Council with Wishlist
---
**Introduction**:
---
Shard, founder and GM of Risen, has been playing WoW since February, 2005. In retail Vanilla he led one of the only 23 US guilds that were able to clear Naxx prior to TBC launch (Validus of Mal’ganis). During TBC and WotLK he raided in &lt;vodka&gt;, one of the most prominent US raid guilds that has ever existed. For the past 3-4 years Risen has been based on a private server where we quickly took over as the top NA guild in raid progression for AQ40 and Naxx, and built a reputation for world pvp dominance. Perhaps you’ve seen us in one of Pronker’s “Buff Watch” series of videos! If not, go check those out on youtube!
---
We have some pretty lofty goals for Risen in Classic! Not only do we want to be the dominant guild on our server but we also want to create the ultimate Classic community—a guild with 2-3 separate raid teams within it! Picture a guild where there’s always plenty of people online to do stuff with—that’s what we want to build!
---
•    High-end leadership with a long track record of success
---
•    The most well-organized guild you’ll ever be part of—ask any of our veteran members what they think
---
•    A fun, competitive atmosphere embracing the hardcore mentality without most of the silly no-lifer requirements
---
•    Dedication to server dominance in all aspects
---
•    2-3 raid teams within the guild, which means there will never be a shortage of activity!
---
**Currently recruiting:**
---
Team 1 1 Extremely Talented Dwarf Priest, 2-3 Warlocks, 2-3 Fury Warriors
---
Team 2 1 Experienced Resto Druid
---
Team 3 Looking for a guild or group of individuals to kick-start and lead this team!
---
Check out www.risencc.com for more info about us!
---
Some transferquests would cross the whole map xD
---
That’s true- the 25% is very strong (assuming 100% up time), but being /sit doesn’t work I don’t know you can guarantee it’s up all the time. 
---
The main draw for arms for me early on for me beyond SS is tact mastery and being able to stance dance with 25 rage. I’m going to cry when I start raiding and need to be fury and not have that talent. 
---
Maybe won’t need to dance as much given classic dungeons hit like a wetnoodle compared to K3 mobs though.
---
This is unbelievably incorrect.
---
I'll be going Orc.  The stun resist is too good.  Soul link Orc warlock is beefy.
---
The devs stated they literally designed the game to be used with addons, but alright.
---
Oh no, I completely agree. Besides, apparently the deceased loved pvp, so it's what she would've wanted. Instead of getting mad like a bunch of man children, they should've celebrated it.
---
Rewards based on contribution.  If you insist on playing a spec that does shit dps and doesn't offer some sort of increased utility, then yeah you don't get considered for the legendary hammer and you're lucky just to have a raid spot.  Obviously people who still show up in those instances will get some loot eventually. But the guild progressing &gt; your desire to play a snowflake spec.  And yes I know the hammer has little pve utility compared to other items, but you still reward your non memers first.
---
Doing world pvp in Ashenvale while leveling with that beautiful music in the background and not knowing who's gonna come out behind that tree and those hills. Ho man...
---
I got told my mouse was cheap when its 30 bucks, only because people compare it to razor naga. Which is just name brand expensive. After trying both mice, I absolutely prefer my redragon mouse.
---
yah it made a larger impact in TBC due to arena's, one of the many reasons arena was such a negative impact on wow.
---
Back then the game was new and people were genuinely in awe of its size and depth. You also HAD to make connections and be group-oriented to succeed yourself. The game was so huge and cool you felt inclined to be curious and friendly.
---
I’ve reread your post a few times and I have no fucking idea what you are referring to.
---
What are you talking about? I can absolutely vendor a Warden Staff just as easily as a Vibrant Plume or a grey. I just listed several examples which were *white* items but are terrible to vendor. If your idea of common sense includes inside knowledge of even all the white items, most of which are useless but some are very valuable, then for who are you even writing out these points? Who has that kind of intimate familiarity with the game but doesn't know to vendor grey shit?
---
Pugging? Fuck yes, it'll be slow. You'll be constantly hoping randoms don't need anything, or setting your own reserve runs to get anywhere.
---
Guild runs? Eh, you'll get it eventually, and other people getting stuff indirectly helps you since the group gets better DPS.
---
This is the reason I am going UD Priest. Tauren can't be priests.
---
What even is this video and why is it relevant?
---
Shadow word death, to break out of sheep.
---
If you're a progression raider in BFA, vanilla is going to pretty much be a joke. Everyone is worried about min/maxing their class and roles, but it won't be a problem mechanically. The problem is getting 40 people facing the same direction.
---
Only if your hunters and warriors are jerks.
---
Late SF daggers should be within 2% of combat swords. But agility matters at some level, if you took an average of all fights of dagger human vs gnome/nelf the nonhuman will hit harder and crit more. Minuscule but it's there. In a strict theorycraft environment nelf is BiS.
---
One healer to be the good guy and one rogue to be the bad guy
---
Sure thing. It's been giving me something to do while waiting for launch so mostly doing it out of boredom. lol
---
Thanks for all the feedback everyone. After reading the arguments, I decided to stray away from the pack and go for Troll. I never put much thought into devouring plague being dispelled, and that spell costs so much mana. Thanks again!
---
Agreed. but still BIG. Early on, who knows how many people will actually stick around. I feel like Blizzard knows it's in the best interest of the health of the game to have some slight regulations regarding servers &amp; faction balance, though. I do not believe they will willingly allow 20k+ people on one server where its 80% horde without incentivising some sort of server transfer. I do think by the end of phase one, the playercount will be much more stable and actions can be taken at that point.
---
It is and it’s still obtainable
---
Assuming you don't care at all about pvp, and just want a build that is good for farming 5mans/solo aoe/early raiding-  
---
You're basically spending 8 points in arcane tree just for arcane meditation, 15% mana regen.     
---
Personally I would drop those 8 points and drop down to 1/3 perma frost and pick up full shatter and imp CoC. This would make you slightly worse in raids, but having a a full strength shatter combo is going to make you way more powerful in 5 mans in aoe situations. You still have 5/5 clearcasting and 3/3 frost channelling for raids so I wouldn't be too worried about that.
---
I prefer the Logitech version.
---
Yea but not in classic
---
I'm fully remote. If you haven't already started preparing by slowly reducing your productivity over time to make it less obvious, then it isn't too late to start.
---
for pugs its just as slow as everyone else who is rolling for it no? i feel like rogues get a really bad rep for it when all the other classes that share the same loot dont seem to get it as much... if that makes sense
---
unless im missing something it should be the same for all melee that share the same loot pool
---
My 14 month old just discovered such a thing.......
---
Listen buddy. I appreciate the time you took to write this post and all your theory-crafting but I was actually there. I farmed R13 (fuck R14, not that useful for a caster anyway) and just wanted to give my opinion.
---
I also had no interest in sharing my account and did it alone. Make of this what you will.
---
Amen
---
LC ALWAYS becomes about the person, because people are selfish.
---
By the time daggers is outdpsing swords, you have beaten the game. I dont find that very convincing as a reason to play as daggers. And yes, in a vaccuum the agi does something. But it really is just a non factor when it comes to choosing a race.
---
I hold right click and then A/D to strafe
---
In AV you can jump out the windows of the bunkers as anyone.
---
If I remember correctly, the ones in Loch Modan were scaled slightly smaller and yes you could get stuck / not fit if you tried to jump out of the windows.
---
In the Shimmering Flats, grinding the Silithids.  Easy XP, and their trash items give REALLY good money for the level.
---
For a very short time.
---
I had a rogue alt which I took through bwl on our alt raids.
---
And yes it can be tedious you share alot of gear and weapons with alot of classes (dps warriors in leather was not uncommon) that said though I think once I hit 60 and did raids and dungeons it was 90% with the guild.
---
Wich made things very easy.
---
I think if you are there to help them and you build up a good rep in your guild/realm you will notice people come to you they will /w you and it will be fine, if you just come prepared on time and your sharp and consistent they will notice.
---
Then again I was our guild Mt and did help when I could so I'm guessing people were more inclined to return the favour.
---
Tldr be on time, know what to do, help when you can and you will build a good rep and people will help you as well.
---
Came here for that. MH isn’t good for melee
---
We had one named "Good Swimmer"
---
In the Shimmering Flats, grinding the Silithids.  They're super easy XP, and their trash items give insane money for the level.
---
Two kinds of people in this world... Wolves and sheep.
---
Its a fuckin' video game, lamb chop.

Showing up is contributing, you'll learn this when you start raiding and you realize 40 people showing up on time is absolutely not a given. What you've stated so far suggests that even with an enhancement shaman who has been raiding for years in your guild, you would give the item to a first-raid warrior because he is higher on the meters. That just seems asinine to me.
---
The problem is, say you're going for Hand of Justice.
---
So is every other melee.
---
You basically have to pray that the other melee already got it and are going for a different item, or reserve it and ML it to yourself.
---
There's a TON of items like this, since the loot pool is relatively small.
---
 Yes please let them continue to believe that, so delete this thread asap!
---
I’m in the same boat as you. Congrats.

My dps friend stealing a binding from whatever random tank our guild will have and causing our guild to become "the assholes who steal the bindings".
---
He has a lot of pull in our guild and could easily get it. I've been trying to explain why that's a bad idea but he thinks I'm just being nostalgic lol

Or just do this instead https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IA0buobZfxmzMZxxbp

It’s easy for us to make a dozen cookies and pretend like we have girlfriends, but I don’t know how to make a baby without stealing my sisters.
---
They're remaking a 15 year old game pretty much exactly like it was... It'll be fine.
---
Why? Without queues to push players into other servers, players will flock to the first 1-3ish servers that reach high and have no reason to roll on low pop servers, exactly like we did see in the stress test. Even then, long term servers cannot handle too many people. If you shove a ton of people onto layered servers and the attrition rates are lower than Blizz thought, now there's a problem that you can't disable layering without turning into an unplayalbe overpopulated nightmare.

I feel like people use mental illness too often as a defense mechanism when they can't possibly understand why people do or feel certain things. Says a lot, might even be a hint of projection. The fact is, they just don't want to think or understand people's perspectives. Boils down to laziness and childishness. These "insults" are mostly coming from one side of this controversy too. Honestly, I think these people are way too sheltered, kind of explains why people are legit angry over this.
---
Someone once mentions d it was like a battle between your mana bar and then bosses health bar. The tank and dps are just the means to an end. I thought that was a pretty I interesting g way of looking at it.

I’m going Druid and will have to heal at some point.

There is value in exploring the world and taking in the lore.

I mean Halo Infinite has been in the works for 5 years, but your point is still generally true.
---
There will be a lot less gold farmers this time around.  Blizz is a lot better at handling them.
---
Got better things to do with argue with this pedantic nonsense.

quest rewards can't typically be sold? so you pick the quest reward that will vendor for the most... but the boe greens that drop you don't equip you sell

I see, I guess I should find myself a guild then

thanks for the tips man! i appreciate it
---
ive seen this happen once out of maybe 10 guilds spanning all of classic tbc wotlk and vanilla pservers.
---
officers generally care way more about progression than personal gear

Most people don't even hit 60, let alone raid.

Cuts down on their sweet PvP montage footage as well.

I think only once I've actually came across someone in a game with TTV, went to their channel, and they were actually streaming.  But one time, I was playing PUBG and sniped a guy from like 500 or 600m out with a silenced SKS.  Went and watched his stream to see the replay, it was great.  Guy was just getting shot in the middle of no where and had no idea how he died.

Minor nitpick but - unbridled wrath is a very weak talent unless you're dual wielding with a lot of +hit gear. Tanking 5mans with 2h or shield you'll probably get a lot more use out of booming voice.
---
Blizzard has their own estimates of how many people will quit early. They also have the data from all their expansion and new server debuts. I doubt it'll be a terrible launch.
---
I feel like this term can still apply to modern wow though, and many new, souless MMOs.

Handicaps reduce your chances of winning, it does not make the game or activity harder. 
---
Considering add-ons are widely available to all players indiscriminately, they should be -and have been- accepted as the norm. 
---
Playing without them is to impede your convenience, but you could achieve a similar level of efficiency with a game guide and proper planning. But it'd be foolish to, considering add-ons exist. 
---
If you want to shoot yourself in the foot to play the game at an inconvenience for the sake of your perceived version of authenticity, that's you breaking from the norm, not the other way around.
---
It might not be ideal for getting raid epics. You be the judge.

My experience from vanilla was guilds seemed to always have a bajillion rogues competing for the same exact piece of loot at the same exact time and then on top of that sometimes other classes wanted it too.
---
I am also curious where this is
---
Such things still exist, such as

Fwiw, the only thing I find confusing is how an adult could find difficulty in understanding the spreadsheet. People are just lazy.

Ok easy fix, remove corpses of afk or disconnected players.

Its the skeletons that are important, not gold spammers useless corpse.
---
That's a lot of good boy points.
---
Well let's be clear, is it that the development went in a different direction, or that the development changed Direction at all? Because certainly, if burning Crusade was more like classic in design philosophy it would still be plenty of players would have found burning Crusade rewarding. But then what, should blizzard have kept that exact same design philosophy going on into wrath? And cataclysm? Because with every successive expansion that the design philosophy and game mechanics stay the same, a smaller and smaller portion of your player base will find the gameplay rewarding, because of burnout. It is in blizzards best interests to alter design philosophy earlier rather than later, because they knew from minute 1 they would be working against player burnout.
---
But ultimately we cannot predict what current retail population would be if blizzard had kept vanilla game principles intact through every expansion. We can't predict that. But we know for certain is the player increase we saw in burning Crusade at the increase in Wrath after that. Any players view anything after Classic under the lens of how BFA makes them feel, that flying is not worth it and flying ruin the game and every other excuse, but those players have clearly forgotten how they felt when after three years of ground transportation they got to fly for the first time in burning Crusade. They don't remember that.
---
How do you really learn to appreciate and enjoy something again? You go without it, and for longer than the first 6 months or eight months of an expansion as has been the design philosophy in the last several expansions. After two or three years of ground transportation from classic into burning Crusade, many players will find a version of that spark of enjoyment from first flying will return.

Over about 3 years of running a raiding guild I only had to do it a few times, I know 1 or 2 were instant kicks due to unacceptable stuff being said publicly in Gchat, and at least two other times I had to sit someone down and let them know they weren't a good fit, one I even liked personally, but everyone else in the guild did not, that one sucked.  If you're an active GM playing with as many people as possible, it's not too hard to nip a lot of this before it metastasizes into something bad.
---
I might be out of the loop - but isn’t layering going to stay in classic? Or what do you mean by that?
---
Yeah I was considering that myself, an extra rage point with a 2h is super weak. Especially when anger management gives you passive regen in combat anyway. Was debating booming or the one that increases demos AP reduction. 
---
The extra range on BS/Demo sounds super useful for maximizing bs threat output on &lt;5 targets , but I wasn’t sure if the additional AP reduction on demo would increase its threat gen at all or in any meaningful way - was going to test that when classic drops.
---
Also I feel healing has grown in popularity. It’s not the “bitch” role it once was considered by many back in the day, no offense. Won’t have too much issue finding healers
---
Its just high competition for instance and raid drops, really.
---
Be the best and get ahead of the pack.

IM INTERESTED IN THA PINT

Had it not been for this video, I never would have started playing WoW in the first place. I was in my dorm room when my buddy across the hall called me over to show me. I didn't know what game it was, but when he told me, off to Wal Mart I went and the rest is history.
---
Faction is just difficult if not everyone is already from 1 faction.. some players will want to play their own faction.. not sure what to suggest here. Server is just waiting on more info or a realm list. No idea on loot system, but loot council seems fine if no one is against it.
---
Elitism. 
---
I have the experience from doing all of the Classic WoW dungeons/raids. Of course, it's been years so I'm sure I've forgotten a lot. But I want to join a friendly, welcoming guild. I don't look forward to newer players being chased away if they don't know, in example, all the mechanics of a particular encounter or if they like don't have an enchant on a piece of gear or something.
---
I won't be joining a guild that's trying to world first with progress or something though, so hopefully it'll be a non-issue. 
---
I would much rather play with more friendly, casual players than min/max progress hardcore players at this point in my life.
---
Servers haven't been announced yet, if that's what you're asking?
---
I wouldn't say it's difficult.  Getting raid class sets is a guarantee eventually, if you're in a DKP raiding, use your points to buy cross-class upgrades and prioritize weapons.  I'd still say going daggers might end up being easier and less competition compared to swords, doesn't move you towards running a human for sword spec if alliance, but that's up to you.
---
Pre-raid, I wouldn't say it's that terrible.  Devilsaur is just farming gold, Dal Rends would be a pain in the ass and it might just be easier to craft a heartseeker, use BoE shadowcraft pieces.  
---
Rend Set, Mask of Unforgiving and Truestrike Shoulders are going to be the two toughest BiS to get but grind enough and you'll get them.
---
Happened all the time. People wouldn’t group with you. You wouldn’t get invited to guilds. Ect. Imagine living in a neighborhood and word got out that a dude is a total fuck so he never got invited to bbq’s or parties. It’s the same concept.
---
After playing through all of retail and then hard core raiding through classic and wotlk I can day that loot council only operates well in extremely well organized and dedicated guilds. In semi hardcore and casual guilds, it backfires.
---
The reason is because people want to be compensated for their time. Everyone showing up to a raid deserves to roll on loot. Maybe reserving a few core items is okay. 
---
Using loot council for every piece of gear is going to be a disaster. Severe attrition and turn over  will take place because people will feel cheated. And they are being cheated out of gear they get to roll on.
---
This has been the case in at least three hare core guilds I've played on.
---
I'll probably experience it again in a few months.
---
Place a pin for everywhere you kill a member of the opposite faction.
---
Geez the gatekeeping for classic has already started. ”Bandwagon” oh come on.
---
I'm going Undead Lock, got a friend going Orc Shaman and another going Troll mage.
---
It will be gone before phase 2 hits. At most it will be there for the whole duration of phase 1, but Blizz intends to limit it to a few weeks.
---
Release of P2 is their deadline though.
---
It only drops from Emp.  Also, not every guildie is equal.  I can do the run with a healer and a rogue in under 15 minutes if they know what they are doing and the rogue can solo Lyceum.  I can do it under 15 minutes with a full group as well, doesn't change the fact that you have to farm about a dozen of them for your 40-man raid so it's still be about 60 runs total.
---
Would like to se a dot in the open sea 😂 repost after leveling your way to 60!
---
Great, thank you for spelling it out for me this is fantastic news I was just confused because I know you need a subscription to play Classic just like you need a Subscription to play BFA but you DONT need a subscription to play the first 10 levels of retail, you only need an account that isnt currently banned so i was unsure if that extended to the soon to release Classic WoW as well, I will take you on your word for it.
---
Yeah I know that servers haven't been announced yet, but I was wondering if there's a webpage or something similar where that information will be posted.
---
Though I suppose it'll show up on reddit once they let us know the server names.
---
5 points in Wand Spec, the rest in Shadow starting with Spirit Tap. Respec full shadow @ 40 for Shadow Form, then respec holy/disc @ 58 for pre-raid bis farming
---
one of our hunters, got both of these in one run, but she hadn't trained one hand swords yet...

This ain't google.

All the time.  I log on at least once a day and plug the same points in the same place.  Then sit back and look at it and say “this is what I will look like at 60.”
---
Oh Nice! Thats really great! I thought they were going to keep it. Damn thats good news to me !
---
I think orc locks look cooler!
---
Whaaaaat!? I love UD zones! I’m torn between going Orc and running there or going UD and just being...
---
Very interesting question! I actually don't know if shadow reflector can reflect a reflected spell. My guess is that it can't, but I cannot verify that.
---
YOU FRIENDS ARE FILTHY CASUALS.    
---
IS PROT PALLY REALLY THAT BAD? EVEN TO TANK 5 MANS ONLY DURING LVLING?
---
Not sure if your aware but World of Warcraft has had a free trial since its inception and a bred gold spamming from the start, have you only started playing since the Token/Gold exchange curtailed it?
---
This is fine, just so long as you're not inconveniencing your guild or pug for doing it.
---
Like you can strength boomkin all you want. You're definitely not entitled to be part of group content doing that.
---
I think this is the most entertaining thread this subreddit has made so far hahaha
---
Sup Sup!
---
Classic also has open world dungeons, I know those weren't popular but I really loved those and I had hope to see the concept expanded on TBC, but it didn't happened.
---
It made the world a little more believable, you might be "in" a dungeon and suddenly you are fight PvEvP because a group of the opposite faction decided to go there.
---
Oh so not a blacklist
---
I am pretty serious about it! And yes. Definitely going alliance again.
---
Same here. It didn't seem right to me back then, and after all these years it still manages to make me wish all kinds of bad stuff to the organisers.
---
The many "for the alliance xD" comments make me feel like alliance is rigged with 12 year old idiot children and autistic virgin neckbeards.
---
"Hurrdurr she would have liked it, now she's immortal!". To me its like saying someone would prefer to be have a well known name after dying even though its because a bunch of moronic people came to shit on your grave and made a movie from it.

My brother.  I was around level 40 or so when he started.  I helped him out so much as he leveled.  When he hit max level he helped me out a ton too.  I remember helping him get his dreadsteed.  That thing was a pain in the ass.  But when BC hit he repaid the favor when I got Swift flight form.
---

---
It would probably not work anymore though. They suicided through literal cheats. Teleporting themselves up in the air and falling down. The anti-cheat is much better now, and is probably what stops it even on live.
---
I didn’t remember exactly because it was literally 15 years ago.
---
But I sure remember the grind and the bullshit.
---
On Bleeding Hollow I was leveling to 60 in a guild called Angry Conglomerate. I was never aware of the server politics until one day when I logged in to find the guild disbanded. Turns out whole server blamed the Guild Leader for harboring Gold farmers and such. He eventually rolled horde and recreated the Angry Conglomerate guild on the other faction.
---
IF ALL THE "GOOD" PVP PLAYERS ROLL HORDE WOULDN'T THAT MEAN ROLLING HORDE IS FOR BABIES WHO CAN'T DEAL WITH COMPETENT ENEMIES?

&gt;  You all know this is a video game not the cure to cancer so to put this much time and effort into the minutiae of racials is ridiculous

I guess we’d be considering it at the early 30s. so we could probably get to pretty close to permanent with the speed some of the mobs hit in those later dungeons. (GY nonelite pulls, Myrms, monks, troggs in uld all come to mind) 
---
It probably wouldn’t be as much of a benefit in ZF or Mara since swing speed becomes more a factor)

the OH is really good for rogues if you cant get brut blade or maladeths which are both from 40 mans with pretty low drop rates. The mainhand is shit for rogues even with the really strong set bonus .
---
Of course, as with anything. If someone doesn’t pull their weight the other people involved have agency to remove them. It’s a bit of straw man since nothing I said implied otherwise.
---
Everything in life that is good is consistent.  Humans hate change, so if you wanna change shit make a new game.
---
Rend is a waste of time. Sword of Zeal + Mirah’s Song is the way to go.
---
One big thing about running a guild is that it is herding a bunch of chickens.
---
Give leadership instead of democracy. Listen to their views, genuinely listen, but only one person should make the decision. If they are making terrible decisions then the guild should be allowed to choose a new leader (or they will leave anyway).
---
Loot should reward commitment. A lot of people hate DKP but it rewards consistency and it is easily understood. Loot council can work better for a group that is already tight and cohesive, but if you try to do loot council in a new or large group, then players are going to feel cheated simply because you made the best decision for progression (or perhaps because you are playing favorites). I'd recommend either choosing a DKP or a Soft Reserve system that falls back to loot council, since both DKP and Soft Reserve are simple to understand, and therefore "fair".
---
But if you are a tight group of already-friends, then sure go for loot council.
---
I guess it depends on what your definition of “blacklist” is.
---
Wow had a 14 free trial 15 years ago.
---
It's 2019, theybhave a starter edition that people can play to level 20.
---
If you want to go last 20 in retail you need a sub. NOT bfa...
---
So why would you or anyone think they could play to level 20 in retail for free but also play Classic to 60 - without paying?
---
Like I said - blactivision ain't giving out free shit when they know people will pay.
---
453 hours
---
I like playing as an undead more than I do Orc. The questing experience is smoother in my opinion. That's because I know Tirisfall Glades more than Durotar.
---
They did so it wont matter as much for sinister strike but anything that procs an extra attack like hoj WF or sword spec will benefit from a slower weapon.
---
From what I hear you want to put points in wand specialization, then go into spirit tap.
---
Cute
---
Classic doesn't have a community yet.
---
Vanilla ofc had a different community... first iPhone wasn't out yet.
---
I don't think i had that many "friends" in vanilla. I did stalk a few of my guildies that played the same class and role as me, as i basically made them my rivals, and they had no idea about any of this. I would try to out-perform them in every raid, keep a close eye of their gear progression and such.
---
Yeah get content out of here I want to bitch about layering
---
Iv raided plenty, shit I've been part of 100 man + raids in everquest that lasted 4 hours and dropped 2 pieces of loot.  There is such a thing as deadweight in raids, just showing up doesn't mean you're actually helping.
---
It’s been so long I can’t recall if he had a known presence in vanilla, but Racerx was pretty well hated on the Thrall server. Trade chat always blew up whenever he posted something.  He’d get called out for ninja looting, intentionally wiping dungeon/raids and his rants in vent. https://youtu.be/Vsf-qgghPdE

UK player looking for an EU Horde guild on a PVP server.
---
Going to be playing warrior and looking to raid as an **Arms offtank** , thinking maybe the old 31-5-15 build but also probably happy to go 2H Fury if necessary. Predominantly looking to gear up for PVP as this will be my primary focus in Classic. Hope to find a good guild of solid players to raid and PVP with.
---
Not looking for anything too hardcore, work a random shift schedule so hard to commit to specific raid nights, but will be playing fairly frequently and Im looking to compete.
---
MMOs are a risk to make, every MMORPG that was created after WoW was a clone, nto because they wanted to make a "wow killer" (you can't move a MMO population just because your game is WoW + gimmick), but because it worked well enough.
---
I also think its impossible, were are you going to find people that are willing create a project as risky as a mmorpg, and then make it more risky by not copying wow?
---
You pose a good example.

Same here. The downvotes you got are a testament of how immature and emotionally stunted many ppl on this sub are.

Unless you get an instant 60 to play with you will only get a feel of them at low level some classes (warriors druids shamans) change alot while leveling game play wise.

Symmetry wow is pretty decent if you still wanna try very low pop though.
---
I use It just to scout around remembering where trainers are weapon masters and so on.
---
Because large members of the server community were agreeing not to collaborate with someone based on their reputation and behavior. In vanilla collaboration was required or else they’d be stuck in shitty molten core or ZG gear for the entirety of wow or have to reroll. There was no meaningful single player content for progression unlike retail. Influential players agreeing to not work with someone was basically a death sentence. Particularly since most servers had less then 4 guilds per faction actively progressing. You’d basically have to reroll or somehow make amends or else you’d be stuck in trash gear getting dunked on. 
---
You can call it what you want. Everyone else that played called it a blacklist so when someone says that word we understand what it means. No one particularly cares what you think it should be called as an individual.
---
Handling loot in a 40 man raid is a solid mix of common sense and not being an arsehole, tbh. Whatever loot system you use it's pretty much that simple.
---
Any association with the pure luck guild in black desert online?
---
Jinth'a alore or however its spelled was one of the coolest fucking spots in wow ever. I loved running it like q dungeon and will be heading back for sure.

Any videos like this one but much shorter and with different zones in one clip?
---
why do people jerk off vanilla wow for things it deliberately set out to change?  wow has less world coherency than older MMOs because all of the important content is instanced
---
It's the reason we don't see the reason for a spreadsheet.
---
Cool, want to link up on discord in a couple of hours and talk about logistics?
---
If you are a minmaxer then planning your speedrun route to 60 on a pserver is quite useful. You find out what grind spots there are, what zones to do  what quests are probably better off bring skipped, etc.
---
If you are in it for the experience and the nostalgia factor, stay the F away. You want that feeling of "Oh my god I'm in vanilla WoW again and everything is awesome", you hold off for another few weeks until you can feel it for real.
---
Trust me when I say that feeling won't be quite the same if you try it out on a pserver first.
---
No, not really.
---
If the MT leaves, the OT is probably getting promoted. The new OT not having WF isn't the end of the world (and honestly, most guilds will only have one WF anyway). If the MT and OT both leave, something else is probably wrong.

If they do spell batching to make it feel like vanilla. Than this shouldn't be a problem for blizz.

---
Ppl want vanilla instead of what vanilla could had been after 15 years of knowledge so yes, no world pvp just farming bgs as fast as possible while on a perfect comp premade, for you, the players.
---
We know.  We don't need this topic again.  Do you know why?  Because they're not going to leave BGs out of "the recreation of 1.12 that is called Classic".
---
Nah, WoW is a utopia where no bad actors will ever exist. /s
---
I levelled up on an RP server (followed family) and it was honestly a frustrating experience because so many players complained about breaking immersion, or they didn't have time to do dungeons, attune, do raids....but complained of being left out or not having gear. I felt that created just as toxic environments as the pvp griefing teens do to you, and that was within guilds. 
---
I think a lot of nascent gamers learned to really hone in on making sure a group of friends or a guild closely align to your own goals. A one size fits all works very poorly.
---
Dun Modr in Wetlands.

Even tho its filled with dark iron dwarves its always been my favourite place in WoW, seems like such a cosy little village, just off the main north/south road, close to menethil harbour, it's a great village in a great location. When I quit at the end of legion its the place I logged out.

Well. I do have an ironman on osrs so that's already confirmed.

Swords skill was the set bonus. Mainhand was 28AP and 1% Crit. The offhand isn't terrible, but because the set bonus isn't very useful, there are better options available.
---
Glad I'm only slightly crazy!

Right I figure if there is a free trial for Classic with the level cap being double I am sure the level would be closer to 10 but I dont care if there is a free trial, I just know with the lack of token for gold system missing from Classic gold farming, spamming is sure to make a return as long as you dont have to pay to gain access to Classic.           
---
              
---
So yes Activision aint giving out free shit but are they willing to turn down possible cash from removing the free trial from Classic, it's not like gold farmers hurt them in the least without the Tokens.
---
oh god I love this LOL where can I get this map?
---
For sure I was just wondering. Never played before!
---
Sorry this is like the first time on this sub won’t happen again.

Awesome thanks for the feedback!
---
&gt; NOT ALL PALADINS ARE HEALERS IN CLOTH
---
I guess if you don't raid.
---
Been playing a lot of pservers. No one’s gonna use vocals for anything else than raiding and serious premades. Pretty much like it was in vanilla
---
Uhhh, kill a lot of mobs between levels 35-40? It really ain't that hard.
---
I have brought Up guildbank om each of these kinda posts. No-one as claimed they will be in. Can you find a link?

&lt;Moist&gt; PvE Horde NA Casual Raiding
---
Intro:
---
We are Moist, a collection of friends (and some significant others) having come together through the ages of playing WoW and still staying loosely in touch with one another. The goal is to find other fellow mature players with limited schedules wanting to make the most of a single organized raid night without the pressure to fully min/max. The core of us are laid back, mature players with busy schedules, but who have raided since vanilla. 
---
We are all excited for this release.  For some it’s about nostalgia, for others it’s about experiencing classic for the first time.  Regardless of why we are here we can all agree we are here to have fun.  We are a casual guild but that does not mean we aren’t aiming to succeed.  We want to create a comfortable atmosphere so we can all experience the game in a positive way.  Play what you want, play how you want, play when you want.  We are accepting and open to players of all types.
---
Classic WoW relied heavily on individual and guild reputation.  We will strive to make Moist synonymous with quality: quality players, quality attitudes, quality experiences.  Anyone who encounters a member of Moist should leave thinking that we are knowledgeable, respectful, fun, and all around awesome!
---
Expectations: 
---
Members should have a desire to learn and share knowledge to improve the guild. Seeing as we will operate on minimal organized raid time it is important that members be prepared and prompt for raid. The goal is to at least be farming BWL and 20 player content and pretty much see what motivation levels are like beyond that. We run a loot council but we try to be fair and transparent as well. We’re looking for people to help share the responsibility of running our guild community rather than focus too heavily on progression. 
---
Raid Schedule: 
---
We are planning to run two separate 3 hour raid IDs, one on Thursdays at 6 pm PST (9 pm EST) and the other on Saturdays 5 pm PST (8 pm EST), for targeting 40 player content. Currently we are primarily recruiting for the Saturday team which is fairly open to most classes/roles. By having two raid groups, we hope to be flexible for people’s schedules while also providing a large player base for smaller group content. Other nights there may be optional 20 player content scheduled as interest dictates given the shorter lock out schedule.  
---
Contact:
---
If you are interested and want to be part of our discord for release day organization, then please message Slaugth#9941 on discord or even a DM here on reddit with a discord contact (I don't check reddit as often so please be patient).
---
The guild leader wants to run for politics or something so now the guild is super PC so much to the point that atleast 4 raid groups have left the guild since legion because the whole “no swearing allowed” is kinda hard to follow when you’re a bunch of adults playing video games. 
---
Along with other things you’re not allowed to say, you are also 100% required to download an addon so that you can see all 10 guild chats linked together. Imagine how fun a guild chat is with 10 guilds linked and no swearing allowed.
---
There's a shut door there instead of a doomguard in the beta. The tunnel can't even be seen with clipping the camera around the wall.
---
Pretty much this.  I hate BGs and love world pvp, but how delusional to have to be to think blizzard would cut them out?
---
That’s a solid grinding spot. I think a lot of classes can skimp by with just a few key spells leveled up and some left at rank 1.
---
Also for speed leveling, being able to get mount ASAP is crucial- and if you are ahead of the pack speed leveling there won’t be anybody working the AH. So you have to get the gold yourself.
---
Plate is lvl 40. Warriors will be in mail
---
? Not a single person brought up YouTubers in this thread
---
For 5 mans you will be fine with anything really as long as you have a tank and a healer. I'd rather have a mage (polymorph, food/water, portals) than a second lock or paladin but it's not a huge deal I'm definitely in the play what you want to play crowd. With raiding in mind though a paladin will probably be strongly "encouraged" to go healer so if your paladin friend is ok with that cool or just find a guild that is super laid back about specs.
---
And a puppy filter.
---
Yikes lol that is really odd
---
It's Vanilla+.  Not quite Vanilla++, but not really its own game. It's got some enhancements and changes, but not really enough to be considered its own game.
---
I suppose I didnt clarify. I dont expect to hit 60 or either of my first two accounts. Maybe 40ish on the first and 30 for the 2nd.
---
The last (final) server will be hundreds of hours.
---
Though I feel you. I have a large game stack that needs some attention.
---
On another note what games are you excited to play/are playing?
---
[This spot in Ashenvale.](https://i.imgur.com/qUTKp2d.png) There's also some Gromsblood growing which is crazy for a level 30ish area!
---
Aidera on Sen'jin-US. We were both kids playing on an older family member's account. I was a human warlock, *Jackjack* of all fucking names, and he was a human mage. I think we did a deadmines together once and then wound up finding each other again in Redridge and decided that meant we were good friends now.
---
Gotta watch loot options as the pull for the boss starts in pugs sadly
---
That dude is crazy. Try lights hope, it’s virtually identical to the real thing
---
Mythic plus dungeons and i still enjoy raiding.
---
GG u deserve gold,  i spat milk all over my desk
---
I mean, they changed less in SC1 remastered. In classic they are actually changing the way macros and mods work. Some of the stuff you could do, you can't, and other stuff you can do now. They actually went further in some ways than a remaster would.
---
 Patch 2.2.2 (2007-10-02): Added. 
---
Source: https://wow.gamepedia.com/Brewfest
---
You will master the two-handed baby gaming possition in no time. Don't worry.
---
Grind beasts.
---
Yea I once got silenced for a week because someone asked me to link my legendary in gchat and people got upset because I had a legendary and they didn’t yet. I also got in trouble for saying “a-hole” in gchat because I was trying to get around the no cursing rules.
---
The funny thing is you don't even have to Google, you can straight search this subreddit and find posts you're looking for.
---
We really need to swap to using the term 'modern' since Classic will also be a form of retail WoW. I genuinely thought for a moment you were implying "don't sub at all," as like an opponent of Classic itself, because of the context with the above post.
---
Retail realistically describes any form of WoW sanctioned and sold by Blizzard.
---
Reagents bank.
---
Nightfall/Conflag gets juicy once you hit BWL+ levels of gear.
---
the problem is you can never be sure, you might be fine in a guild for a year or more only for it to go full retard with guild drama.
---
I think this was a patch to fix the farmers from creating ads with bodies.   I am pretty sure this was patched in vanilla.
---
Teach me bruh, clicker here looking for my 24 hour chip.
---
People have this weird delusion that ‘I put in 11 points in mostly damage talents in holy, I can totally heal!’. Get *at least* down to Illumination and preferably Divinr Favor.
---
Yes changing from ud to orc tho. I just love leveling locks too much and they are an awesome class to level first on a server to feed an alt. 
---
Will try a new class as my alt being priest.
---
Yes you are right. Probably wouldn't even think about playing if there wasn't a small amount of nostalgia. But for me at least my main reason is the game :)
---
It's absolutely original ofc they had to make some decisions about what patch to role with and what content to make available on launch. Yeah its not going to be a living breathing game like it was in 2004 with frequent balance patches and new content under development.
---
I feel this is how and why layering is going to fuck up Classic. I feel like active blizzard if they actually care need to attempt to keep realms laterally the same. So when you creat your character for the first time, you’ll see 200+ people too. It makes the world feel real, as of you matter.
---
You accuse me of " trying to force leveling slowly on people", and upon actually watching the video and finding out I'm not doing that, you accuse me of "trying to ride the fence."
---
Whatever dude lol. You're clearly only here to bark at people.
---
Sorry my main in retail is not a gnome makes it difficult to mail myself.
---
yeah definitely. Not saying otherwise.
---
Right on, remember the vanilla tv ads?  "Get World of Warcraft and you can be anyone you want"
---
[Hi, I am William Shatner and I am a shaman!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7Fs7IpNVCo)

I could develop my alter ego and totally immerse myself in the fantasy world (of warcraft).

Boring job? Annoying customers? Does not matter in 2 hours I am gonna be shaman again. That was great. I never had such thoughts about retail.

On Blackrock there was a notorious ninja named Iced, somehow people did not learn tho
---
I'm sorry  the 15 year old game doesn't have more new topics.
---
I'm going to be picking a central time server despite currently living in pacific time because off all of my IRL friends from back home.
---
I was rogue vanilla-wotlk then until the things i liked about the class were changed and have since played a new main every expac even if i dont like the class.
---
Will be going back rogue for classic, i miss it so much havent touched the class in 9+ years
---
AoE loot and achievements. Maybe some minor mailbox enhancements. I think some festivals came along in TBC that I’ll miss for ‘flavor’  (iirc brewfest and harvest festival). That’s about it. 
---
Eff flying mounts and the hand-holding bullsh*t. 
---
My WoWing slowed considerably a year after WotLK was released (about 10 years ago) and gave it another shot upon Cata’s release. Immediately said eff this and uninstalled. 
---
50 years old and can’t describe how excited I am for Classic.
---
I think he meant to reply to /u/Mjolnoggy comment.
---
Any idea if there's a version that works in Classic?
---
She’s savage! Loktar!!!
---
Seems like a bad plan at release.
---
Sounds like a waste of time personally I’d rather have 3 characters on a pvp server.
---
I have always played alliance I think I'll be starting horde for the first time but as far as class I'll probably stick with druid I love playing druid
---
I am in a try-hard guild.  We are leveling as a group, with a particular focus on BRD.  It takes just under 1000 dark iron residue.  We get about 100 per run, if not more,  per person (assuming we clear bar and spectators.  That leeavevesv 240 incindosaur scales and 60 stacks of heavy leather.  Nothing about that is impossible
---
What was your pet's name?
---
I think it's a bit of a stretch to call Classic "the real thing".
---
I played a warlock and a rogue back in the day.  
---
Going warlock main this time again, with likely a mage alt. Maybe a rogue alt again, who knows.
---
Im unaware of this happening for stats, however it is an issue for benthic gear because they borked the system and threw Raid/Vashjir effects on there that are way too good.
---
I think Balance druids have 4 benthic pieces as BiS
---
If you would be willing to do weekend early afternoon raids we could be a good fit. We already have a raid team together but are recruiting a few more to fill out the roster. We are a semi hardcore outfit that will be raiding 12-3PM Sat / Sun. We currently have about 42 players. 
---
Here is a link to our recruitment post: [https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/warcurse-a-na-est-pvp-recruiting-for-weekend-raiding/205176](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/warcurse-a-na-est-pvp-recruiting-for-weekend-raiding/205176)

You can find our website here: [warcurse.net](https://warcurse.net/)
---
You can add me on battletag @ Pterodactly#1732 and we can chat further if you are interested.
---
Paladin will likely be leveling as DPS.
---
Even if fake, that's some funny shit
---
U fucked up then. I have practicec 1-30 about 6 times in the past 3 months and average 25g by level 30.
---
Feral cat can be 30% with talents at lvl20 then at lvl30 travel form to 40%.
---
Shaman get ghost wolf at lvl20 and is 40%.
---
Druids and shaman really do synergize well.
---
I do like multiple classes but also I would rather have 3 alts of the same type on a server for economic collusion which imo is the main reason for me to make alts.
---
Hey, from the sound of it you would fit very well with us. We already have a raid team together but are recruiting a few more to fill out the roster. We are a semi hardcore outfit that will be raiding 12-3PM Sat / Sun.
---
You can add me on battletag @ Pterodactly#1732 and we can chat further if you are interested. I think we are a great fit for you by the sounds of it.
---
Probably just dual spec. Even though I wouldn't want it in the game, I do recognize how comfy it would be.
---
Paragraphs are pretty cool.
---
That sounds a lot like me.
---
Razer naga my dude bind your main action bar spells to the 12 buttons, use your WASD to move and Q + E to strafe
---
Paladin will likely play DPS/Support role while priest heals and warrior tanks.
---
I'm more worried about the 2 locks being a problem. If one of them were to change, whcih class would work better for our group? I'm thinking rogue/hunter/mage
---
&lt;**UNITY**\&gt; \[**OCEANIC**\] \[**Alliance**\] \[**PVP**\]

Leetvirtue was an AV wolf
---
The only hunter i played was night elf cause of shadowmeld, its just so great combined with a cat pet. I really got used to the night elf looks and having the shadowmeld ability. So i wanted to pmay night elf priest for a change. But the other priest racials seem so much stronger then the starshards night elf posses. Wish night elf had devouring plague instead of starshards xd
---
Alternatively, take more "meme" specs along.
---
This is really important for immersion. Blizz please don't ignore this!

Agree on 4.  Always hated when another Rogue joined my UBRS group...

Your formatting is terrible, nobody wants to read a wall of text, and I'm only responding to tell you that I didn't read your wall of text because it's such an eye sore and have come into the comments just to let you know if you want someone to read that much shit in one post you need to learn to use paragraphs and proper spacing or people are just going to skip your post.
---
I think so too.
---
Need this for showing off in IF
---
The name of your killer for vengeance.
---
If you are MT then Inspiration uptime should be guaranteed, even a priest can keep 100% uptime if they are on you solely. If you aren't MT, really doesn't make sense to take the 2 extra points in TH over 3/5 Feral Instinct for better TPS.
---
not really, its all I knew and its all I could do.  Was effective for me but the player base has gotten a lot better over the years
---
Which they did lol
---
Literally the only reason I’m goin horde is to not have to deal with freakin Hardiness. Fuck whoever thought pf that racial
---
I wasnt blacklisted, but Got kicked from several guilds due to my lack of game knowledge and immaturity
---
So i was 14yrs and a 100% huntard at the time and ran UBRS with a pug. The shaman dungeon sholders dropped and I won the roll. I only saw blue mail item and assumed it was a big upgrade (not knowing anything about stats). Hot kicked from grp and in rage ninja pulled next group.
---
A druid tok a big dislike to me and got me guild kicked from my current guild and several other guilds following. He stopped playing and i joined a New guild, and progressed in raids with them. 
---
Months later i saw the druid back online in IF. A few days later i was contacted by GM regarding complaints from the druid. Luckily, they saw it fit that i kept my spot. Stayed with that guild all the way through wotlk.
---
I only plan on playing with IRL friends. There's five of us and we already have our roles planned out. I never get to see them anymore because I live on the other side of the country, but the day it was announced we all made this pact and a year and a half later, one month from launch, and we're all planning on sticking to it.
---
I'm going to be the group's hunter with the offtank pet.
---
Main goal is to be the spriest in my guild, but i dont have a problem with healing if there is a way that i can obtain pvp dps gear somehow.
---
Lol. You think BiS lists are actually the best item? Try reading a tank BiS list, then ask yourself “How are you supposed to hold agro?”
---
Who's Ping and why is it important to him?
---
i was 13, and i met the gay dude in his 20's named Frypt. We played together for about a year. He opened my eyes to the fact that gay people are just regular folks who might enjoy the same things I do. Knowing my family had I not met this guy, I could have easily turned into a super toxic asshole
---
As soon as they revert classic to 5 pixels.
---
&gt;What am I missing?
---
Have fun
---
Yeah, log in to them and check ping.
---
forgot to add key bind your main cool down spells to a key modifier, I use alt modifiers to mount and pop cool downs

---
Everything currently open.
---
If you are MT and a priest is on you then you should have 100% uptime on inspiration, really isn't hard to keep up.
---
Thick Hide is a good talent for a number of reasons, yes, but I'd rather do 3/5 TH and 3/5 FI for better Threat Gen. Going 5/5 TH means at best you have 1 point in FI, unless you are going pure bear but imo bear/cat is best to maximize your value to the raid so you can do actual DPS when not needed to tank.
---
circumflex-accent two trademark circumflex-accent two trademark circumflex-accent two trademark circumflex-accent two trademark
---
Number everywhere you get a level maybe?
---
Trying to get on the Bingo board?
---
Will absolutely show determination. But reading alot of min/maxing on the sub gives me doubts. Like i read alot of times that certain class race combos are meme and not taken seriously. Wondered if ne priest is still able to wreck on pvp and get invited in raidguilds.
---
Thank you
---
Yeah I know, but maxing TH at any point means losing points in FI which means worse Threat Regen. I personally would never go over 3/5 TH as then you are losing 12% TPS which is way more valuable than 14% armor.
---
Still pissed off I've gotta buy B4A just to play Classic.
---
&gt;Remember bliz is still a corporation and their job is to make the game appealing to you therefore they make profits. Designers are simply reacting to player's desire and sometimes it is these desires that brings a game into a vicious circle. Now people want to go back to the time where drugs don't exist.
---
Okay.
---
Maybe he wants to mount it...
---
Mages go from 1 - 60 without leveling Blizzard once? Is this weird for anyone else?
---
For the lazy here is the [link](https://classic.wowhead.com/item-set=461/the-twin-blades-of-hakkari)
---
Damm I had these I should prob know that.
---
You lose a lot of TPS generation to do that, as you'll not be putting points in FI. Personally I'll be goign 3/5 FI and 3/5 TH, I value the threat gen a lot especially with the 14% Parry
---
“WF?” WHAT DOES IT MEAN? MY PHONE DOESN’T HAVE CAPS LOCK!!!! Argrgrgghhhgg

Pretty cool idea.

Is the blue pvp set strong enough for pvp 1v1 tier 2 enemies?

You just triggered everybody here.

Do you like really big crits?  There's your answer.

White shoulders
---
Well we do all have phones ;) ;)
---
I want to love this, but there are so many inconsistencies:  
---
1. You handwave away the "boar respawning" thing by saying "oh, a new boar just wandered in." How would you handwave away a node respawning? Mythril just... reappeared over time? At some level, you have to accept and admit that respawns themselves are world **inconsistency** but are necessary evils for the sake of producing a functional multiplayer game. Otherwise your very words ("that boar was raised invisibly elsewhere!") would be used against you to justify other inconsistencies.  
---
2. You complain about how pieces of gear have changing stats, like "why can't a mage put on strength gear?" But you omit the fact that in Vanilla there was a variety of gear that ONLY mages could equip, for example. What stops a warrior from wearing a mage helm?  
---
3. Your argument against transmog is self-admitted as "Something I dislike, and not related to my general thesis." But your thesis was, as you stated in the beginning, intended to be a **grand unifying theory**. If you think Transmog creates the same problem as numbers 1-9 (which I'd argue it does), then you need to unify your theory. If you don't, then you shouldn't have included it.  
---
4. Vanilla had the same problem with some NPC locations as live does. There was a quest for Alliance where Jaina would visit some NPCs along the road in Dustwallow, seemingly to just exist in two places at once.  
---
5. By your own admission, Vanilla had a lot of these problems (collectibles from Blizzcon, TCG stuff, class-limited items, ones I mentioned above, etc) and yet we all still love that game. You've handwaved it as "it happens rarely enough that we tolerated it," but in fact people went NUTS when they saw the Murloc costume and not many people were just bemoaning "the loss of sense of coherency."  
---
6. You don't directly address other core problems, such as multiple raid difficulties, although they technically do violate world consistency.  
---
7. The theory itself does not address other core problems, such as LFD or flying mounts, which **do not** violate world consistency but DO cause the same problems, once again failing to be the "grand unifying theory" you set out to be.  
---
8. The theory cannot be applied **universally**, as some things which violate world consistency (battlegrounds, instances in general, items shared amongst all auction houses, talent respecs, etc) are notably NOT bad instances of game design (or, at least, you made no case that they were despite them fitting into your theory).  
---
As a result, the "thesis" came out more like a 99 page rant of 10 things you disliked about the game with a bunch of repeating yourself over why it's a problem ("Transmog is a problem because it's a problem! Can you not see the problem???") without any clear reasoning. You kept saying things about how it makes no logical sense that a bag might contain 3 pieces of loot if there were 3 party members present, but you never stated why it must make sense in the first place or why that would lead to a better game experience.   
---
Next time if you want to put together a decent theory, you should start by making sure to include ALL of the problems, NOTHING extra, and unifying around that.  
---
In the end, this was just a 99 page rant about how you didn't like things that we didn't like either. Get an editor.
---
:o
---
Hahaha
---
There's no single answer to your question. It will depend on the guild you find. If that's part of your criteria, apply that to the guild you want to join.
---
Some will only raid weekends.
---
Someone will only raid once per week on weeknights.
---
Some will do either, and have an optional extra raid.
---
Some will raid as soon as lockout expires and demand constant attention.
---
There's no wrong answer and there will be guilds doing all of these. You need to find the guild that suits you.
---
pretty much man, also watch some of swifty's video on it man, that dude opens up a whole new can of worms for you to play with
---
this better be a fcking joke
---
IIRC the issue was that someone was claiming that damage numbers were off in the Beta, and Blizz hopped on their 1.12 reference client and proved that it was 1:1 the exact same.
---
Ah yeah Ony ty
---
Check the flair ;)
---
Solid response time lol
---
I’ve led guilds since Wrath, and will again in Classic. This advice is spot on. It’s both good and bad to have a core group that are all RL friends. For better and for worse, there’s an additional layer of social pressure when people are your friends both on and offline. That makes what this fellow said very relevant to you. I would have each of your friends write a brief statement describing their own personal objectives, and then goals they want for the guild to complete. Classic will be a marathon, and it will be very easy to lose steam if players feel like their personal goals have been accomplished and there isn’t an overarching goal for the guild. It will also help you to see where everyone stands.
---
I would also be very wary of completely pre-forming your leadership structure. There will almost certainly be players who are more mature, qualified, enthusiastic, and knowledgeable than one of your friends, and it will be very off-putting to them to feel like they are being led by someone who doesn’t care as much as they would. At the very least, I would suggest not having your class leaders already decided upon, and leave as much to merit as you can.
---
Just try to visualize your guild from an outsider’s perspective, and understand the hesitancy many will need to overcome to join a guild with such an established inner circle.
---
Good luck!
---
updated the druid talent specs check them out :)
---
People most def used/abused deadzone in vanilla. Maybe not to the same extent, but it was far from unheard.
---
Hello and thanks for reading.
---
I don't even know if the guild I am looking for exists, but here goes!
---
I am looking for a guild (EU horde PVP) which raids one night a week, starting at around 9 CET. 
---
I am a mature student at university and a father of three, which limits my available time. However, for the time I have to play, I am highly motivated and reliable.
---
I plan to a play a warlock.
---
My ideal guild would be one with a mature respectable atmosphere, hopefully filled with people in similar situations as myself; competent players who aged out of the hardcore scene but still want do play some WoW together. It's a fact of life, I am not in my 20's anymore and life has moved on from when I started my WoW journey. Other parent gamer's would be ideal.
---
I’ve had it happen for me a few times in BfA with just normal items. There was also a post about it in r/WoW the other day. Guy got a 20+ilvl upgrade to sim and find out it wasn’t an upgrade.
---
It is very class specific though as it’s all about stat weights. If your “upgrade” has your 2 worse stats and your current piece has your 2 best it’s pretty common. Especially where rings are concerned as they have 0 primary stat.
---
Me too.  I played without any addons for the longest time because I was worried about downloading viruses and Trojan horses.  Eventually I trusted curse.com enough to download from there.
---
People use that quote a lot for druids, but forget the second part: “oftentimes better than a master of one”. 
---
Versatility is more valuable to me given how I play, over outstanding value in a single play style. That’s why I’ll roll a Druid come late August.
---
Yup that was it, you jogged my memory. https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/elite-npc-damage-is-way-off-plausible-evidence/178518/78

Best zone and town in wow.
---
You want to be the main tank? I personally don't like the idea of raiding with a guild who's main tank isn't either the guild leader or a founding officer that's close friends with the Guild Leader.
---
Main tank is such a massive responsibility that if the MT's not there for raid night. Nobody raids. Guilds can't afford to lose their main tank at any time during classic. Nothing worse than the MT running off to another guild after getting geared.
---
As for days. Any time the guild wants to run a raid. Maybe the guild is on BWL and wants to run MC with another guild to get alts geared. Main Tank gets to run MC and BWL each week then.
---
Off tanks are also a big responsibility.
---
Should ping him on Discord.
---
I don’t have the answer as to why, but it’s the same for me. Any other subreddit is fine, but this one is slow or starts causing graphical dragging. I’m not even remotely interested in changing Adblock settings for one subreddit when I’m pretty sure the mods could fix this.
---
Lol, was this on draenor?
---
Booty bay, I used to stay there and jump around, chatting with friends!
---
Hunters are fine in early raids, but don't scale too well. Warlock are pretty much the opposite. Both are generally brought in small numbers because of "requirements" though.
---
It's really not that bad. I was an alcoholic in Vanilla and was still able to do most stuff. Just try to limit it to three mains or so with lots of other low levels.
---
We sported most of time during vanilla a pink tabard. Everyone wore it too.
---
Don't really get why people nowadays are so ticked by a pink tabard.
---
thottbot.com
---
I characterize posts such as o p as blowing off nervous excited energy in the form of questions that have no precise answer, that serve to generate the kind of discussion that maintains their excitement level until we get to release.
---
It was not. I don’t recall server names well like a lot of people seem to,  but I would recognize it and that’s not it. Though I wouldn’t be surprised if more than one server did this!
---
No, why would they bother?
---
Execute... it's all the rage...
---
Except for having to carry at last two full gear sets most of the time....
---
How hard was UBRS?  If you are in pretty decent pre-raid bis are you good to go?
---
FUCKING HORDE ONY ATTUNEMENT. You need to go to blackrock spire so many fucking times it's unreal. And it raises the awkward question of continuity because as far as the world is concerned, drakkisath was killed 2-3 times over by the time I even get the quest to kill him.
---
&gt;3 fears, of which 2 are physical and therefore undispellable.
---
priest and warlock are magic, warrior is physical. what was is second physical one?
---
And there we go, like clockwork, meme spec users flinging around the E-word at anyone they disagree with.
---
We are planning a week two MC, and once we have 25-30, we are just going to go in and farm some cores and leather from trash before the real run.
---
I know it consumes all my rage,my question was if it's better to use it ASAP or at way more energy.
---
I mean i'd take this over Azurite farming any day....
---
Just because druids are my favorite class.  You would also be getting motw which benefits every class no matter what class they are.  And you will have thorns for your tank which helps him generate threat every time he is attacked.  Druids are also the only battle Rez class in the game and innervate is great for battles that last longer than you anticipated.  The Druid can pop into any role no matter who dies.
---
I used to kill all my alts in IF in a near perfect line so they'd all be holding hands.
---
are you just making shit up that could potentially possibly happen? I don't think that's what the thread was about. I think you just wanted an opportunity to bitch about meme specs.
---
I'll cry as much as you want if you promise never to vote again
---
It's not modern Wow's fault that you have played so much over the last fifteen years that you are burned out and do not find the content fun anymore. There's nothing blizzard can do about how much you chose to play.
---
Managing a guild and tanking a raid boss are 2 separate skill sets.  Mt doesn't have to be someone up in guild hierarchy just someone that reliably shows up every week.
---
https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/7870

Chicago and Los Angeles for all US servers.
---
Paris for all EU servers.
---
Sydney for all Oceania servers.
---
First off cool thread idea. Personally my favorite landmark was the Stonewrought Dam (they made reaaaal sure to make sure Deathwing had a go at it in the cinematic). If I were to give a lesser-seen view that the average player didn't experience, I would say the view from Ironforge Airport overlooking Menethil was always pretty awesome (and I would slow fall down from time to time).
---
The truth is that  if a game doesn't change most players with start to consider it to be stale. Also players have been demanding changes on the fourms since ever. 
---
Now classic wow is old enough to be considered new to people who haven't played on legacy PS. 
---
Within 4 years classic will become stale for most players which will lead to tBC servers
---
Personally I'm excited for classic wow and hope it's as close to the original as reasonably possible
---
This type of disgusting comment is exactly why I wont hesitate to annihilate anyone who plays alliance
---
Damn that shit looks like a ww2 battlefield
---
It's a "change" only in the fact that the modern API allows way too many things (though not as brokenly op as the original wow API) and they wanted to better recreate what macros could and could not do in vanilla.
---
Well it is harder than your normal dungeons, and it's a 10-man, so there is more coordination involved.
---
Mobs do hit harder there, and you need to coordinate as a team instead of "cruising" in a 5-man, so yeah in that sense it's harder.
---
But it's not *really* a gear check. Decent gear, pre raid and some good leveling items, is fine.
---
I really think every death is too ambitious. I would do red for every time I’m ganked in world pvp and then green for each  first clear of dungeons/raids
---
&gt;Repair bills when leveling is so trivial I wouldn't even considering it part of a budget plan for getting your mount.  
---
&gt;Repair bills when leveling is so budget I wouldn't even considering it part of a trivial plan for getting your mount.

That's why I'm moving away.
---
I thought I read somewhere that stacks will be higher than 20
---
Not everyone wants to be the leader, also good guild officer or even raid leader =/= skilled player.  The best guilds dole out responsibility based on aptitude and playing time.   Its perfectly acceptable for the mt to just be a really skilled member who shows up every week.

Get a Naga Mouse or something similar. Get the Bartender Addon and lay your bars out to match the Naga Keypad like this https://imgur.com/VRgoc2r
---
As nice as a mage would be over a second Lock, its fine. Both will dps well, but if he choses to go hunter then there won't be any competition for gear against the mage.
---
If friend 2 doesn't want to go paladin, then don't force it on him. Paladin's are always forced into healing in raids and PvP, While Warriors get to DPS to their hearts content.
---
&gt; Handicaps reduce your chances of winning
---
By making it harder....
---
I honestly would say a minority actually knows that orc is the best.  The average player REALLY puts all their eggs in that WotF basket.
---
Thanks Brother.
---
Making winning harder =/= making the game harder. It's not like they break one of the horses leg or put weights on your golf clubs.
---
and that fearward tho
---
As a Warrior I got the Arcanite Champion instead of the Arcanite Reaper back in Vanilla, and I specced into some of the fury talents that restored health.
---
I was relentlessly criticized and mocked for wasting Arcanite on the sword instead of the axe, but I was purposefully trying not to be every other cookie cutter warrior out there. But yeah, all I ended up doing was proving that I did not have the best gear/talents for the job. But I still played the way I wanted and that was enough for me at the time.
---
Let us make a copy!
---
that's a great idea, might go for a little more streamlined look but awesome idea thanks my dude
---
Perhaps it's because your client has not yet downloaded the WDB?
---
The first thing you have to do is die in each corner of the map so that it doesn't fall off of the wall...
---
Private servers are around 5 gigs. Maybe they found efficiencies or something.
---
&gt; If friend 2 doesn't want to go paladin, then don't force it on him. Paladin's are always forced into healing in raids and PvP, While Warriors get to DPS to their hearts content.
---
He's actually leaning that way all by himself. I am definitely trying *not* to push anyone to play a class/race they don't want to. I know all too well how shitty that is. I'm just trying to help suggest since our people are still sort of on the fence.
---
But if he goes warrior instead of paladin then we've got two warriors fighting for gear, and three clothies fighting for gear.
---
Or, two warrios fighting for gear, two clothies fighting for gear, and a hunter just chillin.
---
I'm getting a notebook just for this.
---
Sort of, but I think good planning can minimize that.
---
Everyone gets orc crusher or the wailing caverns staff, that's a quest. then the drop rate on corpsemaker is REALLY high (50%).  Then at 40, everyone can get bonebiter if you are alliance.... that's almost home free right there. 
---
By 40+, I think your leveling rate will slow down so much that you can just run everything till everyone gets every 20% drop. 
---
I think there will definitely be a huge demand for blacksmithing though. There is a world of difference between a sub 1% drop and a 20% drop, and I can easily see people just doing bulk purchases off of blacksmiths in stormwind. or leveling a blacksmith themselves. 
---
Really though, sunder armor tanking looks to be REALLY practical for pre 30 content, and that means the incentive to build a physical dps group is pretty large. Both because it is needed for sunder to be any good, but because there is a positive feedback. When a 2h warrior is doing even 10% more damage from autos, that's roughly as much rage as anger management will give you. Just for having like 2-3 sunders on the focus target.
---
Blizzard propaganda! I want the world covered in bones and blood.
---
Throw that knowledge at him!
---
And at the end he will beg for dungeon boosts, because he will “rest”. Like a parasitic pest.
---
I've written about this [here](https://github.com/ppach/furyguide/blob/master/furyguide.pdf).
---
TLDR: You want to spam it and use up the Rage as soon as you can, UNLESS you're over 2000 AP. In that case, you want to prioritize BT and use Execute to fill in the gaps.
---
If you're reading the whole thing, I'm working on reworking the Weapon Skill math with the recent developments from the beta.
---
I logged in since I'm resubbed for Classic and I was running around ungoro crater and noticed how the mobs that spawn around me are fcking instanced, they just phase in 50ft in front of me then phase out as i run past them. It feels so bad.
---
Vanilla was originally 4 CDs, so 2.8GB base install. The patches probably stacked that up to like 5-6 GB. But if they can optimize the final size so that it’s just one patch instead of stacks of patches, nice way to shave off a few GB.
---
2 fucking weeks. You're a god among men. I thought I was sitting pretty with my solid 7 days
---
Accuracy? Authenticity?
---
You buy them much sooner than crowds.
---
its also pretty much mandatory for every class in pve
---
I didn’t play in classic but instead Wrath but if I could answer I’d say the special goods that restaurants would serve that no longer are around/discontinued.
---
Mine is 6 months old and now she likes to try to eat the keyboard and headbutt the desk so I can't even go one-handed. She's too powerful
---
What a shit analogy.  Comparing two completely different mediums.
---
Ahh so it's not a "change" to change the way macros work because they are trying to make them work the same. Makes sense to me.
---
Has anyone considered one simple fact: Blizzard should be paying us to play, since this bitch gon' be a full time job.
---
WF MEANS WINDFURY!!!
---
You're going to love me
---
That's where the majority of mine were, too.
---
gnomes and humans are both just pretty much inferior to undead and orcs, HOWEVER they do have shit they can do. gnomes can technically run away from warriors/rogues better due to escape artist removing hamstring/crippling.
---
And humans have a disgusting amount of rogue/druid detection. If you can get a 1.5 attack speed sword, humans can potentially do funky shit to as a melee demonology meme spec due to their bonus to swords.
---
However gnome mages and human mages both heavily outclass all horde counterparts. Due to evocation scaling off spirit in vanilla and how mana regen scales with int.
---
Well, we’re hearing it was a sick plainstrider.
---
If someone held my 2sons hostage and made me go alliance... 
---
i’d roll either gnome lock or dwarf pally
---
But i’d hate it, and would probably feel guilty absolutely murderizing my fellow hordies. But i would!... for my kids
---
Banging my girlfriend after school.
---
Now she’s my wife and we got kids and newborn so you guess how much banging is going on around 4PM.
---
Correct.  For example, in the legion client they used as a base, focus target existed, and you could macro @focus to cast an ability at your focus target without changing your main target.  In vanilla, focus never existed, so they removed the focus functionality from the legion client as well as the macro API.
---
Sci-Fi channel had a great sci-fi Friday run of Stargate SG-1, Stargate Atlantis and Battlestar Galactica. I forget when it started exactly, but they’d go twice through each so you could just pick up wherever they were in the showings and see anything you’d missed from earlier. Couple of friends and I would meet for dinner after work, we were young professionals just starting our careers then. We’d get back and dive into the shows. After we’d all disperse to our respective apartments, drink and play WoW until odd hours of the morning.
---
Good times. I will miss them. Both new Stargate, and being able to play WoW until stupid hours. Damn responsibilities and adulting.
---
I have flashbacks now.
---
Remember when our guild leader was so shit faced and screwed our dkp up and we had a one hour raiding break because of that.
---
Big deal
---
Is there a priest discord?
---
What are these keys you’re talking about
---
&gt; AoE fears like Psychic Scream are way more impactful than they are in 1v1s, because they affect multiple targets and are not dispellable.
---
According to him, Psychic Scream is physical. I have no memories of that being the case. I am absolutely sure that it was a dispellable magic effect during TBC.
---
Game development started 3 years ago. I wonder why the stress test was cancelled?
---
Do you work for Activi$ion m8? Some video comparisons would take like 10 minutes :^)
---
The horde side is pretty relaxed. The alliance one can be pretty anoying, but the quest line is more epic.
---
Nothing in business ever takes 10 minutes.
---
7 minute GY run in Ashenvale is the best though
---
Probably achievements (that black war bear for killing alliance leaders)
---
I’ll miss dual spec, but i’m glad it’s not in there
---
I wonder how many early 2000's computers just flat out died from all the stuff on screen.
---
Yeah the lizards tails are good for leveling cooking
---
Pfft, you think the plain strider would lower it's standards that low?
---
You really don’t even need that excessive amount of gear. As long as the tank has enough gear to not get killed easy you’ll be fine. Mostly just need enough cc.
---
Oh ok
---
Serious question: Why not "world coherence" instead of "world coherency"?
---
&gt; If they weren't disrespectful with words then I don't see an issue. Apparently it's what the deceased would've wanted because she loved pvp.
---
I find this claim fascinating because it is being repeated here as established fact, when the sole source seems to be the main dickhead's toon saying it over the deceased player's corpse.
---
Do you see that as compelling evidence? A massive dickhead makes their toon say it, therefore it is true?
---
In any case, "PvP' means everything from team versus team AB to a 60 rogue ganking noobs the second they leave the starting zone. Saying someone "loved PvP" does not mean they loved 60 rogues ganking noobs the second they leave the starting zone.
---
I think what is going on here is that the pretence that the deceased "loved PvP" looks kind of, sort of, just maybe like a justification and people who are desperately in need of a justification have leaped on it. But it doesn't even make sense. If I loved Monty Python that doesn't mean that it's okay to crash my funeral and yell Monthy Python lines. If I loved baked beans that doesn't mean that it's okay to crash my funeral and throw baked beans at people. There's no logical connection.
---
&gt; I didn't see anything disrespectful with words, nobody was trashing the deceased. That's all that matters to me.
---
Nobody cares about what matters to you. What morally normal people care about is the predictable effect of their actions in disrupting a memorial for a person who was really dead, held by people who were really their friends.
---
You are making up an extremely silly and arbitrary rule to get these people off the moral hook - "anything is okay as long as you didn't say a bad thing about the deceased, that is the only possible thing you could do that could possibly be morally wrong".
---
&gt; nothing is off limits on a pvp server.
---
Well no, not if you are a sociopath.
---
The rules coded into the server don't stop you disrupting a memorial service. But you are failing to understand that there is a potential difference between what you *can* do and what you *should* do.
---
I can now buy my gaming alcohol myself and it isn't the cheapest brand sold at the convenience store.
---
no dual spec
---
I like the idea of trying the one thing you didn't do. I did that on private servers for a little while and I still mean to try a priest at some point.
---
Clicking is the only way I know how to play. Haven't played WoW since MoP. Am excited to try Classic.
---
You don't think friends grieve when their friends die? Do you actually have any friends?
---
Yes. They also broke some functionality that existed. Targeting totems for example. Just how you couldn't target them in.... van... oh wait that's not right.
---
Doing Orc war myself.
---
The significant number of utterly under-powered specs. In dabbling on another server recently I have come to the realization that what I really want is TBC. Probably just going to be very casual and hope that there's enough steam to get a TBC Classic in a couple years.
---
We went from a dark blue/gold which looked good with my armor to this. That annoyed me more than the pink.
---
Very weird, I aoe level frost and spec heavy into it.
---
Understandable to say it's mandatory for rogues/warriors/hunters, and for mages/warlocks once they aren't using bloodvine, but I wouldn't ever say mandatory for healers.
---
Or just bind strafe to A and D. When do you ever need to keyboard turn outside of RP? Not hating, just curious. I like to bind Q E R T F Z X C 1 2 3 4 5 6 and shift and alt versions of those, as well as scroll wheel up and down and mouse buttons 4 and 5.

Anyone who is part of the classic wow community knows, but new players or old ones coming back who haven't kept up with the meta might not.

Retail makes sense when you're talking private servers vs official, but it could be confusing to newbies when talking private vs modern vs classic.
---
I dont see a difference between a free trial which can be abused by gold sellers and leveling to level 20 for free which can be abused by gold sellers, sounds to me like splitting hairs on terminology.

Damn this was too real, i didn't expect to be personally attacked like this today.

I wont be joining your guild. But Holy crap I loved following Risen's progress back in the day. I still have your old website bookmarked, too bad most the progress pics have been lost to time.

Similar but I lived in a house with 4 others who all played in the same guild. Sadly I think only two of us are going to give classic a whirl.

Ive been thinking about this same thing too and have been trying to prepare myself for it. I was a god in vanilla and TBC pvp but almost everyone was terrible at that time. It wont be the same, but I dont really think I even want to focus on pvp so much this time around anyways.
---
Why would you not use it on tanks and healers, it does the same dmg for everyone and by far the best for every class.
---
The only exception on pservers was alch because lotus were bound but classic they arnt.
---
good point each to there own my dude, I did read some reviews on both, I do own however the Razer blade 15 from last year as my gaming "rig" was trying to matchy matchy everything

Except not using add-ons and macros don't increase the difficulty of the game, just reduces mouse clicking, clutter and tedium. Vanilla WoW was an easy game with or without macros and add-ons. The 'difficulty' is from the time sink, the sheer number of spells, and the hassle of managing to get the proper number and set up of people together AND paying attention to clear content.

how exactly do you imagine I am 'asshurt' from my post?  I am more inclined to think that the excess of extremely hostile replies are coming from people who are 'asshurt' that some of what i said might have hit too close to home.

Whirlwind is between 5 to 10% of your total DPS. Slower weapons with comparable stats are obviously better, but weapon speed affects fury warriors way less than rogues.
---
The aesthetics and the music, it's just perfect tbh.

this comment oozes "i am a faggot"
---
Why should he? Honest question, is the game bad? I've not heard of it
---
My kid is not kindergarten anymore now he will raid with me and kicks my but in pvp. Been telling him to move back in so we can get myself rank 14 he just wont go for it. I was in my 30s during vanilla and could sit there for hours playing now not so much so i will be more of a casual player. On the plus side i can afford whatever pc i want now unlike back then.

This is a long shot but just throwing it out there. Looking for a guild that's active after midnight on the west coast. PVP relm, prefer alliance but horde is not a deal-breaker. Will probably main a warrior.
---
I agree with this. I leveled 1 back in the day and 1 on private servers. The pserver one I enjoyed WAY more than mage. Mage is horrible imo. 
---
Stealth is huge . Amazing for avoiding ganks or setting them up - sometimes you just stealth around following somebody until they pull more than they can handle and you just f em up when they are vulnerable. You get to really earn the hatred of other players as a rogue when you chew on their dead gnome feet.
---
I wouldn't say all of those are common. Yes you are usually meant to do your best in raids which includes playing a proper spec and using consumables when necessary.   
---
Topping meters is only really a tangible thing for very few people as vanilla is extremely unbalanced, most people don't care.   
---
The head/heart world buffs are really easy to get, just show up in SW/Org and you'll get them if you're on time. Some scheduling will probably happen on Classic though. The DM, songflower and DMF buffs are a bit trickier and consequently very few guilds require them. Actually I've never been in a guild that required them and I've been in several top 5 guilds on private servers. 
---
Few care about world or server firsts either. There will be a few guilds shooting for it but the vast majority will just do it on their own schedule.
---
Lastly, this mentality of min-maxing like crazy and spending a ton of gold on consumables really only starts happening towards the end of vanilla. You don't need these things in MC/BWL, but once you get into AQ and especially Naxxramas you kinda have to poopsock the raids a bit. That's just how vanilla is and it was the same back in the day.
---
How does a server's population inflating then eventually suddenly deflating by about 10% mean balancing out? The anti-fan to fan ratio probably isn't 1:1.
---
My issue isn’t really nostalgia. My main motivator is I’ve really been in the mood to play WoW for a while as have the rest of my friends. But every time we play retail it feels utterly unplayable.
---
T2 on a Warlock is one of the coolest looking sets in the game right behind T2 Paladin.
---
Or their aesthetics

I haven't played wow (or any computer games) in 8+ years, so i'm really worried about if my computer will hold up to 2019 graphics.  I have a 2018 macbook pro. Nothing special but it does all my daily non gaming tasks.  Is the main issue with lag basically the increase in graphics from 2004 to 2019? Cause I was running at like 20-30fps even in raids back in 05' on a shitty ass computer.

1 Elemental Shaman

1 Enhancement Shaman

3 Warriors, of any type.
---
Dishonorable Kills. I probably won't join any pvp raids, because of the risk of loosing hours or days of pvp progress, just becasue somebody in the raid killed a civilian.
---
Opens spreadsheet....

Slowly backs away....

As a hunter player, the only talents that I have to put any thought into are tier 2 and 3 survival talents in 2/31/18 and 0/20/31. The rest is very obvious.

Blizzard = Jody confirmed.
---
More like stocky gnomes than anything
---
&gt;Yes, I know, it’s a MINOR change, but please, we’re trying to replicate Vanilla to its core here.
---
I feel like we have very different definitions of the word "core".
---
Layering is a bigger threat to Vanilla's core than dumb skeletons.
