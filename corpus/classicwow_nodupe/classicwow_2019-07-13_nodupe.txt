I used to play Magic, but I had too many bad experiences with other players that I stepped away from the game. Cube and EDH were fun, though!

Maybe it wasn't funny, or maybe everyone else is the problem.
---
That would be a lot of fun. I've always wanted to see a GM in game
---
I didn't play a private server, but I did play a priest in vanilla.  I just think the deep holy is not as much of a benefit once you get some +heal gear.  You benefit a lot more from downranking, and the mana improvements from the disc tree.  And then PI is just icing on top, making one of your mage DPS go nuts for 30 seconds, reducing the amount of time the boss is alive.
---
I had almost forgotten about pyroclasm. Considering it only worked on the rank 1 variants of both spell till mid TBC it begs the question: Are they recreating that 'feature' as well?
---
I was handed nothing in life. I've had to work for everything. Enjoying my success is not wrong. And I still intend to play the game hard, to contribute to a raid team - I just have no desire to spend hours doing menial tasks just so I can go do the things I actually want. That's not what a hobby is supposed to be.

Haven‚Äôt played magic since around the time I played vanilla. The good old days.

I've mentioned it once and only to explain very large character flaws in my personality and my recent lack of career direction.

Go through life not caring what people think about you and not only will you be more fulfilled, but you'll succeed a lot more often.

This post had one purpose and its success can only be measured in the amount of players reaching out to me privately rather than publicly.
---
Shouldn't Sneezy be a paladin because of blessings?
---
I don‚Äôt actually have an argument either way - just wanted to drop the rep thing in there for OP too. 
---
I‚Äôm going to be playing a holy priest so I‚Äôm in a similar predicament to you - do I just heal dungeons all day and level that way or do I take the slower (and probably more painful) way and quest as a priest.  Given I don‚Äôt have the time I had back in vanilla I don‚Äôt intend on rushing to 60 and on top of that I‚Äôve not played vanilla since actual vanilla (never been on private servers) so questing for nostalgia purposes is appealing. I guess ultimately the decision will depend on each individuals own circumstances and what they‚Äôre looking to get from classic.

That would be never.

&gt; Literally only 2 specs in vanilla have 1 button raid rotations
---
And the rest have 2 button rotations üòÇ
---
&gt; After all that, every single raider in BfA uses an addon that tells you what button to press next, every second of the way. You never have to think for yourself. There is no skill needed whatsoever.
---
Now this. This right here is absolute gold. Weird how none of the players in the world first races used these. Regardless, assume it's true. It's still harder than vanilla where you have no choice but to use your 1-2 dmg abilities üòÇ
---
&gt; Keeps lying lmao. There is no complexity or challenge or skill involved in a rotation of "press the button that lights up".
---
Go ahead and describe a typical WoD fistweaving rotation then. I'm amused you think an addon can tell you have to properly use fistweaving in boss fights. Wish I had that one :)

He streams speedruns all the time, like he streamed this whole run solo. I can't tell if you are a massive troll or actually serious. Check up his old vods :)

No idea what post you're talking about I'm speaking about the one where you talked about your game day set up. In that one you talked about all the money you had enough to pay for your girlfriend and her family to go away on vacation so you could play. You're tiresome troll go away.
---
He's done One-Winged Angel and so many other crazy pieces.  I have no doubt that he could.  He's got a pretty big library of songs; he's just doing WoW stuff now because I imagine he's hyped about Classic.

Bank alts and mailbox storage manipulation are clearly not the essence of the design of alts nor the mailbox system.  As can be seen by the fact that you pay money to increase your bank and there is an ingame bank in the first place.  How do you justify bank alts or mailbox storage being "supported" or in the spirit of the game's designs when they gave us space constraints to work within literally called "bank" that you're byspassing the limitations and the spirit of banking via these other means.
---
I see it as the same type of play beyond the scope of design and spirit of the game.  Clearly they've outlawed neither so they at least agree that these are not exploitative in nature and are also allowable.
---
Lmao, I read it was 45 gigs?

This but with a spoon on the end

Have any links to watch the leveling route?

I just pay someone else to play. I don't even like this game, lol.

I have no idea what you're talking about. There's no girlfriend in my life, just casual dating. I think you're confusing me with someone else.

I just did. I'm not trolling the latest one was even slower than the one you linked.

A lot of pirates I've heard from won't like classic. But you might idk you.

They don't have to eat or drink but they still lose the same amount of time. Its just cheaper.
---
Makes me wonder if macroing a keyboard button (or even a foot pedal?) to right click might be a good way to reduce wrist strain.
---
I kind of wished they went more horizontal with trees allowing for more customization of talent choices.  You know how 5 points in a specific thing unlocked something on the next tier but then what if it unlocked two things but you had choose only one of them.  Could have been really interesting to allow for potential Tri-tree paths with powerful mid level unique unlocks but only single choice of each unlock in each tree so you couldn't just grab all the strong mid level talents.
---

Originally it was only 8 debuff slots. Then you had to prioritise even among the good debuffs. With 16 there's a bit more wiggle room and you can usually squeeze a couple of dots on. The debuff limit lead to the ridiculous way ignite works which lead to mages becoming even more dominant, so that's also why I hate the debuff limit.

Could just be lucky. You could have seen the same drops you did if it was a 0.1% chance to drop.

Classic is not balanced around what class is best it‚Äôs balanced around what class you enjoy the most.
---
TOO SOON
---
Speaking specifically from my experience on private servers:
---
It is a DPS gain if you do it properly, and have a good melee weapon. Another trick you can do with wands is as soon as the animation happens, but before the "Shoot" GCD begins, you can use a spell and both the wand damage will go off and the spell will begin casting.
---
So you want it made easier? No it was rare because of the rewards. To get those rewards you had to work extremely hard, this isn't retail where everyone gets the prizes for less.
---
Why playing on a streamer server is a bad idea.

You've had confirmation from Blizzard that Scatter Shot, Wyvern Sting, and Freezing Trap share diminishing returns in the 1.12 reference client and will share diminishing returns in Classic. Time to pick a new hill to die on.

Shaman don't cast with a Rogue on them. They drop Earthbind to slow the Rogue, then alternate between Flame Shock and Frost Shock while running away to prevent re-stealth + bandage. Trinket removes the first slow but the Shaman can remove Crippling Poison from himself if he screws up and gets slowed a 2nd time.
---
Takes 5 shocks (24 seconds) to kill a Rogue without any crits. No casting required.

Noted, thank you.

I agree with your sentiment and I think I'm approaching this is the least overbearing way possible. Simply looking for any big obvious tips that might help avoid her getting discouraged (like X specific rogue quest is actually located here and not where the log makes it sound.) That kind of stuff would be equally discouraging to her.

Can you make one for pvp gear?

I agree with both of you :) God I miss that amazing shit show.

You shouldn't be Bear between levels 21-29, cat kill speed is WAY faster even with no energy when shifting and only claw. It's not even close, it's MUCH faster. Leveling as Bear post 20 is objectively suboptimal. If you read the guide on [classicwow.live](https://classicwow.live) about staying bear after 20 it's just factually incorrect, cat dps is always better.
---
You still get furor by 44 even going deep feral, but it's only for 40 energy which again really isn't that big of a deal. 
---
I wasn't saying NG is insane, just that it's useful. You won't use it to start a pull, just if something extra aggros and you want to get away without casting. It's not game breaking but I'm just arguing it's utility as you said those 5 talent points would be useless.
---
Can you not read? The guy told you a Priest speed levelers name like 3 times.

Usually the guild assigns a char for the blacksmithing.  The price for you should be the mats (or a small fee to another guild who has done this)

I don't recall what the ore prices were in retail vanilla but they won't be very expensive compared to the herbs.  Mithril is the most used ore for engineering (sappers)

Most of your alchemy will be done for guild mates who don't pay a fee.  Most people in other guilds will buy the raw mats and have someone craft it for them

Nothing you posted says my point is wrong lol. Reread please and respond to what I said lol

I found that if you want to make raid bosses in dnd, moltencore is too simple, start with BWL, each boss has 2-3 mechanics which is pretty good for a small party to handle at a time.

There were thunderfuries (equippable) dropping in the beta event. The raid chat went NUTS the first time one dropped. Spam in your window of the entire raid rolling Need. I nearly choked laughing.
---
Mana regen. They are a caster class.
---
It was never intentional.  Blizzard has said countless times that it was due to tech limitations with how the game was built and they never intended the debuff limit.  The only reason people wnat to keep it is because the game was originally balanced with it in mind and people feel that removing it would make an easy game even easier.
---
It would be nice if it was removed and then the game retuned a bit, but #nochangers would rather shit the bed than entertain that notion, but the debuff limit really hurt some classes and specs needlessly.
---
Show them the old trailers for the game, the silly commercials of celebrities with their WoW characters.

In terms of leveling I'd say priest. renew smite/hfire/mindblast dot wand afk.

Holy fuck, MC can be completed by disabled monkeys with that value

If you want to do the fun quest in westfall, you have to go to...
---
Lakeshire, westfall, stormwind, westfall, in that exact order. 
---
In duskwood, you need to have been to....  darkshire, westfall, darkshire, goldshire, stormwind, eastvale, and duskwood.
---
If you want to get the best sword in darkshore, you need to go to ashenvale, then back to darkshore. and not like "the border with ashenvale". The opposite end of the zone.
---
simply put, you do not get to do all the quests in the game, without massively outleveling them, and a lot of the really cool, really epic quest chains with great rewards..... require you to not just do the zones in a specific order, but to do PARTS of the zones in specific order.  Sure, you could run through and do every quest in every zone, but half the mobs would be grey, it would take twice as long, and when you got the cool rewards, it would be disappointing as hell, because the last mobs would not be a challenge and the reward would be a sword that is 5 levels out of date.

Except armor mitigation is absolute crap, Warrior dmg reduction on tanking comes from Defensive Stance and avoidance, armor is the least valued stat.
---
Shaman will never be on full mail armor because most of vanilla BIS for any caster are clothes, and melee are leathers.

So your poor shammy with 3k armor and less HP than a priest is unable to survive a PvP rogue in blues, stunlocking you to death

---
Calling someone else butthurt after the way you've handled this conversation, LMAO.
---
Why base ranks on duels at all? In wPVP, Druids are dead last. Anyone and everyone can just get away from them.
---
&gt; This is technobabble for "we programmed it that way".
---
No, its not.  Blizzard has flat out stated that they never wanted the debuff limit.  They didn't realize the issue it would cause in raiding later because, like everything else in classic, the system was a bit wonky.
---
WoW was originally built in the same engine that used to make WCIII with some heavy modifications.  There were a lot of silly things, like the debuff limit, that came up and weren't addressed till much later.  They were never intended as a balancing issue and was simply a lack of forsight on blizzards part.
---
An example of issues they ran into with this engine were that mobs had no way to target spaces, only players.  This was fixed later, but as an example, for Onyxia, deep breath targeted the ground, not a specific player.  Do you know how they got around the engines current targeting issue?  They spawned an invincible, invisible chicken on the ground where they wanted deep breath to hit and she targeted it.  It didn't show up in the combat log and didn't have a portrait so it looked like she was targetting nothing.
---
There is a lot of really interesting stuff you can read about how they had to put the game together in really wonky ways for some stuff.  A lot of quest triggers involved spawning invisible NPCs and then kill them instantly to trigger certain quest conditions.  Players never saw this stuff, it was all behind the scenes.
---
Anyway, you can think whatever you want, but Blizzard has directly stated that the debuff limit was never meant to be a thing, but they didn't realize early on that it was going to make certain specs and abilities unplayable in most 40 man raids and was going to have a huge impact on balancing.  Blizzard had a lot to learn in those early days.
---
You're comparing apples and oranges.  Do moonfire without spell batching.
---
Well enh wants all the stats to play well if u are grabbing just str u are doing it wrong and for pve speed dosnt matter as much for shaman so with its good dps + stats its a great enh shaman wep since enh still cast a lot of spells so in other words shaman uses the whole wep unlike mage warlock which is just a stat stick
---
Didn't work like this in vanilla since pp wasn't on auto loot.  You would have to click the inventory every time.
---
Keep an eye on the AH. Prices on the lv5 and lv13 wands can get very low and therefore no need to spend the time grinding out tailoring and enchanting. I plan to use the vendor mats from skinning to help pay for em.
---
You dont seem to grasp what a stunlock means. You simply wont be able to drink any consumables
---
I literally played mage on 3 different servers. I beat rogues 99/100 times. Even in duels with FAP and grenades, mage is still favorite. 
---
If you're talking Perplexity tier players which are 1 in 50000, vs a mage of equal skill, it will be closer, but Mage is still going to win more. If memory serves me right, he actually has a mage-rogue duel section in Perplexity 2 so you can go see for yourself.  It's vs an elemental mage though, deep frost is stronger in that particular matchup and much more common.
---
People are also used to private servers.
---
If you're latency went from 200 to 20, you moved closer to the server.

Hemo is a very good debuff and will be used in most guilds since game debuff limit is higher in classic
---
Back in the early days of vanilla I noticed that mining nodes in instances respawned at roughly the same rate as ones in the world do. My main was a rogue, so I dumped a profession, picked up mining, leveled it quick, and started stealth mining our MC raid ID once it was cleared enough for the week to do so (this was still a pain because some trash still respawned when bosses were down). Got boatloads of dark iron ore, and could also stealth to the forge in BRD to smelt it into dark iron bars. Made thousands of gold doing this, and it pretty much floated me through all of vanilla. They fixed it in the next patch iirc.
---
&gt;Also is there any PvP gear in classic?
---
Yes bought from vendors once you have the prerequisite honor rank. Getting the good stuff is anywhere from tremendous effort to nearly impossible if you're not a neet. Raid gear will do ya fine.
---
While general wow related stuff, and love for the game should cross pollinate, please be polite to the retail raiders keep vanilla theory crafting out of /r/competitivewow. If there is a serious interest, a new subreddit resource should form.
---
Not everyone watches on a pc these days though
---
I was soloing BGs.  A lot of Arathi Basin because it was favorable to hunters/my play style.  I'm pretty sure if I was with a good group, we would requeue together.
---
Hell yeah Earthen Ring! Horde or Alliance?

Especially these days
---
Can confirm in vanilla I was good at AH and bought my pali tauren icebreaker. Regretted it on the first hit
---
No that's not how combat logs work.
---
Is that an official stance of the sub or your own personal preference? Not trying to start shit just generally curious

Like slow fall, levitate, ankh, blink, limited invulnerability potion, noggenfogger, bop, DI, soulstone, parachute etc.

I hit rank 11 as rogue just before the end of summer and beginning of classes. But I no-lifed wsg premades that entire summer. I don't remember it being difficult in terms of getting an invite or playing hard, but the commitment was tough.

Adding in 5 stacks of sunders, curse of recklessness and faerie fire (assuming those debuffs are present) would put his armor at 5656. Unless I'm forgetting some armor reducing debuff?
---
Found the pserver hero
---
I read earlier that, if you do this, you should make a macro to toggle between your two tracking skills and bind it to jump. Kind of a nifty idea.
---
Yes, this sounds exactly like my experience.  When you hit rank 10, taking a week off sets you back 1 1/2 ranks (8000+ rank point loss). You cannot take a break.

The rock should be a Nelf and Kevin Hart a dwarf (hes to jacked to be a puny gnome)
---
There are some guides online of expert Moonkins who have made it work.  Requires a LOT of extra effort, but it can be done.  The DPS of an expert Druid player won't beat Mage or Warlock, but can keep up decently enough behind them.  I am less knowledgeable about Paladins, but I'm assuming the same thing.
---
I cant believe it's been over a year since he passed
---
Yeah that makes more sense. -1 probably means infinite resistance or something.
---
I'll level Arms and then respec prot at 60 most likely. Since there's no BG's at launch I don't have to really think twice about specing prot.
---
Mobile gang reporting in
---
sorry i should correct myself, 3731 is his armor before debuffs.  the log may show after debuffs but rag  actually has 3731 before any debuffs.
---
I'm not religious by any means, I think that the quote fits well for how the gaming industry, and corporate America as a whole do things.
---
But warriors are the only class that can wear plate
---
I'd do something like [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxubxsZAGzc0ux)
---
You get the crit mana talent that's needed to heal and you get blessing of kings and blessing of sanctuary which you can slap on your tank. Then you get reckoning for sick solo farming dps.

r/foundthemobileuser

Youd have to do that no matter what class you play
---
Obviously none of those buffs were present... It was a level 63 mob with level 40 players. Someone got 1 sunder off (lowering armor by 270) and guess what the armor dropped to? Yes, 3461
---
Yes but the event in the combat log shows his current armor so if those debuffs were present we know that his current armor plus the amount reduced by the debuffs is his total armor.
---
God I hate the word viable now.
---
Ok fair enough then
---
Myself and 3-4 other priests horde side on our server hit rank 12+ doing nothing but healing.
---
There will be plenty. Along with raid spec shamans and resto druids
---
A ton of people (myself included) don't play retail wow, and are only subbing for classic. So we have nothing to "go back to."
---
Its just what Classic WoW demands.
---
Are you like a giraffe or something because those things sit so damn high.
---
u/uwutranslator
---
I like it!
---
Here's a giant ramble!
---
All of those will be great choices for that really. If you've got up to NS for either druid or shaman and you wear some healing gear you're good for all content healing (and expect to all the time). SL isn't really a thing for PVE, but SM/ruin locks can both raid and PVP reasonably with same spec.
---
Locks I'm more experienced with than druids or shamans. It will play more attrition based as SM/ruin in PVP, although your shadowbolts can still seriously slap since that's what it's built for. Without SL melees are harder but still very doable if you're prepared. Casters are my favorite target as a lock, though - tongues is deadly, fear is just overpowered, and you can nuke real good. Felhunter on top of this becomes ridiculous as you can nix any one buff, debuff, or kick their casts off GCD and simultaneously to your action. When you win as lock it feels often like you won when they were still 50% in that your kill becomes pretty much secured - but you often have to prepare ahead of time with conjured consumables and having pet out, and having shards for that as well as shadowburn spam in PVP. The only kills that are free are when you get a free fear or seduce and you can curse+soulfire. And every class has an out of this for the most part. Plus you shit on mages and their stupid face, little fuckers lol.
---
All three classes are very defensive in 1v1. Even ele sham, which has very explosive damage potential, spends a ton of time in the battle of attrition against a skilled opponent.
---
Ele shams always felt to me as if they spend 80+ of the time defending themselves frantically, then 20% blowing the opponent to smithereens in two globals. You require an additional axis of skill to combat - killing important totems means someone drops off the map for at least a moment while they target, send pet or melee, or whatever, and they don't much do that against other classes than shaman. When I play melee against ele I feel like I can't do shit because I'm slowing and they have armor and healing. When I play casters it's having to jump through a million stupid hoops of ground, kick heals, fail to blow them up, get purged every other global, and if you aren't carefully they freecast twice and you ded. And you'll be a much wanted healer in raids, and you're the only class rolling on some of the gear.
---
Druids I don't have a ton of experience in classic but they are probably the most attrition based. It's really hard to stick anything that will just kill you on the spot, you run away and beartank and heal almost simultaneously.  You can chain CC melee nicely and you have some tricks against casters too especially mages. If you kill someone in under 30 seconds I'll be surprised though. A good druid is rare but great to watch. I think they shine in coordinated teams since they heal still effectively, and they're hard to land a solid kill on if you position intelligently - plus you can peel for your team and be running in travel two globals later. Be aware shapeshifting takes a fucking ton of Mana even with healer gear, and that you'll practically never just blow someone up. It will take you forever and a lot of raiding+gold to have good spellpower gear for balance and your spells aren't really that impressive compared to a primary caster. Also you're the best flag carrier which is neat! Good FC is a whole other level of skill.

All the clips I watched on twitch had anything from 5 stacks of sunders to zero stacks of sunders so his total armor value could be anywhere between 3731 and 5656.
---
Good for you mate, the word has always existed
---
Not sure if you're trolling or not-Blizz specifically stated that "players" can at times not trigger traps when moving over them quickly, not NPCs. Normal pursuit speed used by the NPC should not fall under that category either way.
---
If its a consistent behaviour on both PvE and PvP then there is something obviously broken in their code. Do they have traps working in "pulses", meaning that if you run in between ticks you are unaffected?
---
I'll be there with you. In spirit.

Isn't there a group bonus

Fuck oath, that thing was not obvious.

Anyone who gets shot doing this will have to go above  and beyond the plan as I understand it. I'm with you on riot control, they will definitely be in place. Hopefully no one is both able and willing to make it past that point.

I see your points.  I leveled on a PVP server so it was constantly on my mind =P

Awesome! That balrog mat looks badass too

Oddly enough, you'll have a much easier time going herb, selling mats, and buying the mining mats then you will going mining and harvesting them yourself.

From experience: it's not.

Drink on the table! REEEEEEE
---
If it makes you feel any better, leveling up on a pvp server is better than leveling on pve even if you could transfer over.  Every time you get ganked, it makes the future ganks that much sweeter.
---
Depending on where you're drinking (bar vs club and quality level), 3-4 drinks could totally be 45 bucks.

Hence why I prefer to get trashed at house parties

Does area 51 even have enough weapons to deal with 800k people storming the base?

Also, you start counting to 5s as soon as you cast, but you wand for a good 20 seconds while SW:P ticks. You don't cast Smite the whole time, that's how you end up drinking every other mob like a mage.

Yep! Just ended.

Play on a PvP server. World PvP whether looking for it or trying to avoid it makes for a more interesting and challenging game.

They ruin every game they play, I remember when playerunknown was on the h3 podcast he said how like 95% of cheaters/hackers in his game were from China.
---
You're going to be doing substantially less dps than the combat rogues, this isnt about minmaxing its about pulling your weight. Why should you deserve any loot if you're getting carried by the other players in your group because you're too selfish to respec during progression? Maybe once content is on farm you can get away with it but I wouldn't want you in my guild if you refused to respec and still wanted loot.
---
Mage and Lock
---
You think character creation simulations are your ally?
---
I didn't see my characters face until I was already running dungeons... by then it was nothing to me but BLINDING!
---
Still more complex than a mage rotation
---
Good bot.
---
Looks good but doesn't seem practical in any way
---
Holy Paladins are very efficient and last a long time. I was lolret in vanilla and was efficient specced that way with heals. Holy is even more so.
---
This seems like it wouldn‚Äôt work in a bg? Not sure how fast mana burn can do the trick but I assume a decent team would come to aid the pally before he could be killed. 
---
But I guess draining all his mana makes him useless for a while so probably would be good for the team fight as a whole. 
---
But I wanna kill the light bois
---
That's great buddy! If we ever get TBC Classic, I'm sure that will be relevant.
---
Isn‚Äôt the bottom half from a WoW cinematic short?
---
Fastest speed run is like 4 days 20 hours or some shit so deff not
---
It doesn't matter what happened to it in TBC. We're not getting Vanilla: Remastered, we're getting Vanilla, warts and all. Bugs from 1.12 will not be fixed.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I hear. You don‚Äôt remember seeing a class or two that made you say ‚Äòaw fuck‚Äô?
---
What about in wpvp
---
This makes me want to taunt GMs whenever I have the opportunity.
---
I‚Äôve heard this won‚Äôt be as viable as the gear drop rate in the beta is much higher than on private servers
---
Orc Warlock in T1 with Soul Harvester!
---
For me it was Elemental Shaman and Hunters. They always gave me fits.
---
Why you bully us?
---
Two priests do scare me though.
---
What‚Äôs the pally magic reflect? I didn‚Äôt start til bc and didn‚Äôt get into PvP til later
---
Double elemental shaman for insane burst damage that ends the fight before they can even heal. Two earth shocks with 5 second cooldown talent will prevent a heal from ever getting off. And can dispel his instant cast buffs.
---
What does the gear drop rate have to do with gathering professions?
---
I'm one of these people.
---
I will no life the shit out of this game for a week, maybe two weeks. The thing that interests me about classic is the fresh server, everyone starts at Zero.
---
I've got 1 WoW token from retail left (haven't been subbed for over 6 months now) and that's all I'll need.
---
The only thing that would keep me locked into this game is server restarts, with balance and class updates that change the 1-60 experience each time, from lvl1 to lvl60 content. (But keep that same vanilla flavour).
---
Classics endgame content just isn't for me, and while yes I can no-life for possibly a week, my lifestyle doesn't cater for it anymore, and I'm someone that has to be in the top 1%, really pushing boundaries, if I'm not there I lose interest real quick.
---
And with Borderlands 3 out a couple weeks later, I'll be hitting that with my homies
---
[Done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Gb_4v45G2Y&amp;), and [done!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHJLdF2WNxI)

That's hilarious. What private server was this on?
---
I would be 100% okay with this dude re-recording all the wow music and replacing all the music in the game with that.
---
Self righteous lay of hands using bubble hearthing. And they seem like the natural enemy of the horde. (And warlocks which is the class I‚Äôm leaning towards)
---
dude, the pvp while leveling is the best part
---
Well I don‚Äôt exactly plan to be first to 60, I‚Äôm definitely leveling cooking, fishing, and first aid before I hit 60. Blacksmithing appeals to me but honestly I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôll be super useful. I *am* rolling a warrior but at least on the private server I‚Äôve had no trouble getting decent dungeon weapons. Perhaps that might change? Have you tired this? Does it work out?
---
You could go Moonglow + Swiftmend. For Feral, you could spec a little more optimally for both bear and cat.
---
There have already been changes and additions to classic beta in comparison to vanilla retail so that logic doesn't hold up.
---
I like this. Also has that nice lore horde v ally theme going on.
---
But what is his pet going to be called?
---
Your bag space is filled up with more gear that‚Äôs more valuable then the full stack of whatever leather your getting. At least that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve heard vaguely anyway.
---
We don't actually have confirmation on this. It's certainly likely, but all we know right now is that paid realm transfer will be in the game at some point. We also don't know if it will have the original 6 month cooldown, the 1 month TBC cooldown, or the 3 day cooldown that exists now.
---
Good job! You reliably can kill all but one class.
---
Macespec skillherald warriors who have Death Wish up and know how to pummel/reflect. You are a free honor kill to me in a 1v1 scenario, unless there is a massive gear difference.
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one that makes spreadsheets for my WoW characters.
---
Skip professions entirely until 60 if the goal is making money. Especially if you're going to take crafting ones.
---
Only 100% more effort as Feral DPS? I'd guess more than that...
---
I'm not sure Ublock Origin is on chrome, but it is on Firefox mobile.
---
Look up prices for downhill bikes. Mates go through 2-3 a year, I think I have the cheaper hobby of it's only 1.5k
---
For Ret Pally?
---
Awesome!
---
On a sidenote, this thread made me poop.
---
If you're planning to healing then your spec is certainly viable. The mana reduction on Healing Touch is the big pull here and raids will want you for your utility. Personally, I'd switch Moonfury with Gift of Nature for more healing power.
---
Oh shit so I probably shouldn‚Äôt soulfire them? Is it a passive or active ability which I assume has a internal cooldown? Well I guess I can look it up. 
---
Another reason to hate pallys lol
---
I like Retail. I like Classic. They're different games. Your hatred for one is not going to bring you more joy in the other.
---
Thats what happens when you hold your breath for 6 minutes

Clearly they've never seen a world boss get kited to a capital city in WoW.

Maybe look up when the government murdered a bunch of people in Waco, TX.  They weren't even trying to storm Area 51.  Nobody gave a shit.
---
I played on Moon Guard (NA) so to properly represent my Vanilla WoW experience, the cows should be fucking each other.
---
Does this mean the countless hours people like asmongold spent on their characters in beta are permanently deleted and aren‚Äôt carried over to live? cause if so that would suck
---
No, BWL Xbow is much better. Only upgrade after that is KT xbow.
---
Do you really think 800k people are going to show up?  I'd be surprised if 8 showed up.
---
TBH a private server GM would have been more creative with their punishment. This GM is weak.
---
This is such a stupid and toxic mindset. You literally want temporary bugs in the game because they existed during a snapshot of the game's cycle.
---
I bet you're the same kind of person who demanded progressive content and itemization even though that wasn't in 1.12.
---
Can someone link a video or screenshot that proves his armor is 3731. I beleive it, just want to see for myself.
---
You‚Äôre gonna be drinking a LOT of water...
---
Neither was progressive itemization or content release.
---
I still consider 100 ms to be good :(
---
I see a distinct lack of naked Draenei. This can't be Goldshire
---
Priest, Lock and Mage are all the main ones.  
---
  
---
Priest - mana burn, fear, dispel
---
Lock - curse of tongues, damage, silence, dispel  
---
Mage - counter spell, damage
---
Shadow weaving plus imp shadow bolt could be nice synergy

Stress Test 3: Thurs Jul 25‚Äì Fri July 26
---
They share a ton of data, but they do have large differences in many mechanics and graphics, so they have separate installations. All WoW installations share one folder now, it's very nice, but you launch them individually
---
Lmao
---
It's the journey my dude.üòä
---
LOL I'd understand his reaction if he actually got to keep the sword.  Last day of beta bro, I hope you didn't get too attached to it.
---
Can confirm.  Completed most Vanilla content (while current), all with a raid of retarded monkeys.
---
A secret Mom horde druid is stealth over in the back of this screenshot
---
If you're wanting to raid then you're probably looking at tank or healer for any tryhard guilds.

IMO there is no reason to get Natural Shapeshifter while leveling.

---
So WE can uninstall the bfa folder if we want to play only on classic ?
---
But it isn't "dog shit". It has far better and more challenging group content than Classic ever did and it just keeps getting better. Competitive arena has never been more balanced and the game has never looked better in art and audio direction.
---
You said you have the time and resources to play the game and yet you let the mere thought of paid character boosts and cosmetic mounts force you into a red faced tantrum on the verge of tears.
---
How many hours a week are you going to play Classic? 10? 20? more? Even if you bought every single thing in the shop and constantly bought enough WoW tokens to never want for gold, it's still an incredibly cheap hobby. And yet refusing to buy anything from the shop does not prevent you from experiencing anything the game has to offer.
---
Crippling slows more and you can kill poison totem before it removes either they die in opener or sit full blind.  With 40% dispell resist on poisons from pvp spec it makes the fight a cakewalk.
---
Engineering is a money sink, not a money maker. Grenades are only usable by other engineers, so being a goblin engineer means you're selling grenades to gnomish engineers. But since there won't be a lot of engineers, it's a small market, so you won't make many sales.
---
This.
---
I came here to say that! +1
---
Level 18-27 is done and ready to be implemented.
---
Hunter should be Dopey.
---
I get the lucky thing but 3 in a row at 1% is just unheard of and seeing them how often I did drop rate was either wrong or bugged.  On a side note I have never seen felstriker on a pserver with 100+ runs.
---
So are you also opposed to progressive content release?
---
Do you like the look though?
---
No, of course I don't want them. But if you made a laundry list of every single thing this community considers a bug and demanded they be fixed, we would never get Classic. And that's what you'd have to do, because fixing a 1.12 mechanic for one class means fixing them all.
---
Blizzard is making Classic because it's dirt cheap and has the potential to convert more players over to Retail, that's it. They don't care about you, they don't care about me, they don't even really care about Classic.
---
And now that we're ~6 weeks from release, it's far too late to change that.
---
I love goldshire but not this painting. The focal point is 3 random cows and some random guy in the bottom center. The in is far in the back, the movement of the people seems unnatural.
---
Have your opinion ill have my'n pal.
---
Yep - "Raids" is what we used to call it, because all it took was that one guy who was flagged, and soon half the raid had it.
---
if he was a mage he would've survived with slow fall or ice block ;)

---
\&gt;talks about how warlocks are weird edgelords
---
\&gt;Came to this conclusion because his character named "Bladewalker" was ganked by one
---
A progressive content release is the best way to give players an authentic Vanilla experience. Changing a Vanilla mechanic that one class feels is unfair is at best irrelevant to new players and not authentic to veteran players. And it's pretty fucking thickheaded of you to equate the two.
---
I'd like to say the moderation is good and I'm not seeing as many reposts of memes. But just the other day I got hit with a rule 7 on a meme that was fully unique and also had 1k upvotes on it within hours. It was a post on buying gold and I think a few people in the comments were getting bad regarding race/ ect. And even the mod was getting involved but almost seemed like they took the easy way out and just slapped a rule 7 on the meme and called it a day.
---
I forget, can't mages also blink before hitting the ground?
---
Dbs TCG :)
---
Do you have an actual source from Blizzard that ever called it a bug? Or are you just equating changes made from one expansion to another as proof it was a bug?
---
What would be better for a new player to WoW Classic? Having every single bit of content available to them right from launch and confusing the hell out of them when they hit 60? Or progressively releasing content as it was done previously?
---
Stop being a selfish prick.
---
I don't think there's anything racist about wanting to play a social game with people who speak the same language as you
---
This post will prob get removed by admins for shameless self promotion

Probably right but I'm also not the on writing a paragraph to someone I know isn't going to agree with me...haha!
---
Or maybe he wants to kill people in world PvP whenever he wants.
---
I mean, more people know English than Chinese so, yes. Put an american on a European server and I guarantee they won't have much trouble communicating with the players, but put a Chinese person on a European server (assuming they speak chinese while on the server) and almost no one will understand them. English is the lingua franca of the internet outside of China.
---
Although I am in love with the class and the stuff you can do with trinket swapping, I already had my day with it on a private server. It was awesome not needing to farm a flask every week and still be wanted every raid; what's not so awesome is watching all the shiny loot pass you by. I never made it out of T2. BWL xbow took 7 months to drop for my guild and I was the SECOND hunter in line, so I got it just as AQ came out. And you don't scale in AQ/Naxx whatsoever until you get KT xbow which will take months.
---
So I'm going to play a warlock and have an inverted powerspike. Leeway looks like a PITA, I don't get why rogues should be able to sprint through traps without disarming them first, and not having Lupos really makes our dps take a hit in early phases so you will be nothing special.
---
No offense, but I don't want to play with "dadgamers" 
---
I'm out.

Found someone who didn't play vanilla. It originally took 154 days to kill Rag. Obviously it won't be nearly as long this time around, but the challenge is hardly correlated to his armor value..

The discussions were good within the meme other that a few hateful people, but an entire thread shouldn't be deleted. Rule 7 seems like its thrown around for everything!
---
I spent 90% of my classic time here roleplaying. The feels are real!
---
A min-maxed Speedrun guide is "lacking userfriendliness for casual players"?!?!?!?! Im confused what your point is. Such kind of addons are just min-maxing your time, wich is by design a pro-player attitude. A casual would never even think of min maxing quest routes whatsoever. and im quite sure that not even 5% of the casual playerbase would know about speedrunning in the first place. The rest will just see a level 60 riding by and be like CHEATER WTF OMFG LOL!!!!11!111 So youre worried about those 5%? Doubt that \^\^

I think you can more casually get to rank 10 as long as you play a decent amount and don't have off weeks so you don't down rank. Even rank 11. But pushing for 12+ took even more grinding than I was willing to do.

That's actually really cool and fun :)

Most of the gear you want as a elemental shaman is almost free none in the raid wants it beside you. first of all all the tier sets up to T3 are spell power based and not healing based. The T2,5 is among the absolute best setts for a elemental shaman. in pvp elemental 30/0/21 shamans are among the best players 1v1 and really good in group pvp and they scale wherry well whit gear. Enhancement are good in the beginning of a server when none have high armour and high health and your rng can come to its fullest. There is almost no good mail enhancement gear after dungeon blues. and all of that gear will probably go to a warrior or hunter before going to a shaman. You will probably not be able to raid as an elemental mostly because of mana issues you are competitive up to 3 min fights and viable up to 5-6 min after that you drop of really fast but in all honesty i'd rather take a elemental shaman for a caster group then a enhancement for a melee group. plz remember tho if you ever get the chance to raid as elemental you need a vastly different spec then the pvp spec. As a side note sorry for the rant and sorry for the mangling of the English languages it is not my primary

Some people likes to mumble about "changes", even some Classic+ content. While it must not happen and is forbidden here in r/classicwow just like low effort memes are, it's a good place where to vent.

---
I'm in no way encouraging you to join this guild...but you are going to be neck deep in dad bod central when this game comes out.

You clearly don't play modern WoW. The group content there is 10x more challenging than anything Classic ever has to offer.

Culture does not equal race. This sort of rhetoric is why we can't have open discussions about cultural differences. Just because someone is of Chinese ancestry does not mean they are going to embody Chinese gaming culture, however Chinese gaming culture definitely exists, and definitely clashes with Western gaming culture in a myriad of ways discussed in other comments in this thread.

What Armor debuffs will be standard with this value? - Faerie fire, curse of recklessness, and Sunder Armor bring it down to 336. - there were some items that dropped it down further but what would most consistently drop it to, or near 0?

You don‚Äôt sit at your desk for 8 hours straight. People do when they play games. People have died playing games. Just because your ego is built around playing video games too much doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs okay to tell people it‚Äôs fine to stay up for 36 hours straight.

Early phases, you won't miss any tangible rewards. When battlegrounds open, you can get some good epic and rare items from each by reaching exalted status, but this can take dedication, especially in random groups. When the honor system is released, PVP will grant ranks that unlock gear sets. Alterac Valley actually has quests to complete, and it is an option to level up from 51+ there doing side quests that support the war effort.  That's the tangible stuff I can think of? It's also fun, and will improve your play in PvE somewhat.

Ehh, it's meh
---
Haha, I know you!
---
Even other MMO's like FFXIV and ESO offer content that completely trumps the mostly singular mechanic bosses in classic. Then you have the fact that nothing is a mystery anymore, builds and spreadsheets are everywhere, and that this content has been farmed to death and perfected on private servers.
---
Thank you! And you‚Äôre English is fine because I didn‚Äôt even notice until you said something
---
Yeah, people who literally sat down and didn't fucking get up for 2 days straight, no one is suggesting you literally ignore normal bodily functions beyond not sleeping.
---
I literally said in my first post 
---
&gt; don't be dumb about getting up every once in a while, and again, stay hydrated
---
For those of us who are capable of reading.  Literally fucking retarded.
---
That's exactly how I do it too. I actually know how all that works. Your I think confused about how this actually works. No ones saying they aren't efficient actually the opposite. Priests almost never have to drink. What you don't seem to understand is not drinking doesn't mean no downtime. You still need to be not casting after a targets death to gain enough mana back. Its called downtime.
---
That's exactly what you do. Why did you make it sound like i disagree with that?
---
Healing assignments are very important in Classic. People can't just spam their AoE healing spells that automatically target the lowest health raid members. (Except Shaman. They're OP.) You will want a healing lead for sure. 
---
In addition, you will want to have class leaders. In BfA, you might not have class leads because you might have one or even zero of most classes on a given night, But in Classic, you're virtually guaranteed to have multiple members of each class. A very balanced guild in Classic would have 5 of each class in a 40-man raid. For the most part, each class has a specific role in each encounter. Having one person of each class who can help point the others in the right direction will make your life much easier.
---
Yeah. It's called "seasons of war" it was the vanilla cinematic iirc
---
As someone who danced around trying to keep a regular schedule and not drive your significant other crazy - it may be worth playing in larger chunks but probably not every day. During vanilla I was playing basically infinite hours in the gearing up and leveling process, and then to keep my sanity and my old lady happy I was playing 4-6 hours on tuesday, thursday and saturday, sometimes i'd pop on for a little bit here and there if she wasn't home in the evenings but I always felt like I was able to be more productive with longer less frequent sessions. If you're coming in as a fresh player the trickiest thing will be getting networked with people who are playing on a similar time frame and investment, since typically if you level up running dungeons with the same people invariably one of them will find their way into a raid guild who could maybe use an extra healer, or dps, etc.
---
Nobody is trying to normalize this, its a one time release of a game, you aren't getting another Classic WoW launch that people are obscenely hyped for.  I'm not going to stay awake for 48 hours playing Pubg for some fucked reason, but you bet your ass I'll be awake for at least 40 hours come Classic launch, because guess what, I'm not retarded and I'm not going to die from being stupid about being sedentary for days on end.
---
I'm invested in pointing out your stupidity because you're incapable of reading comprehension.  I *clearly* state not to be dumb about *literally* sitting still for hours on end, point out *why* in this game in particular you actually have plenty of time to *get up and move around*, avoiding your ridiculous blood clot scenario (the people who have managed to die from this were actual morons, who just Darwin awarded themselves), and yet you insist "Nah bro, you'll actually die".  You can literally cook a fucking meal on some flight paths in this game, you have *so much* time to actively avoid being literally stationary for the entire time you're playing.
---
You're like the gaming version of the parents who worry about razor blades in fucking apples on Halloween.
---
We're they handing out thunderfury? Is that a hunter with on on their back?
---
Still more efficient to have an offtank spam hamstring and resto shammy with wf
---
tis nice got a custom Jaina myself was also thinking of an Ironforge one myself. Inked gaming does make some quality customs.
---
This is what I mention when people start asking for new classic content that was never in vanilla. If they break the seal on authenticity, then they open the door for an in-game shop too. But Ion seems to be squarely against adding new stuff to classic, at least from what I've heard up to now. So likely none of this will be in there, unless they start new servers that aren't vanilla-based classic.

You have to understand that out of the 39 people in the raid, only like... 20 people need to be competent. Even in pre-raid BiS.

Onyxia can be done with like 15 people.

Using the the the 75% average from a well known "blizzlike" pserver during the first few months of release:

* Rough Stone x 61 (61s)

* Copper Bar x 131 (5g 24s)
---
* Linen Cloth x 51 (20s 40c)
---
* Weak Flux x 30 (27s)
---
* Bronze Bar x 90 (5g 40s)
---
* Wool Cloth x 50 (2g 50s)
---
* Medium Leather x 20 (30s)
---
* Heavy Stone x 75 (7g 50s)
---
* Iron Bar x 59 (3g 54s)
---
* Silk Cloth x 10 (20s)
---
* Silver Bar x 20 (2g 20s)
---
* Steel Bar x 4 (60s)
---
* Solid Stone x 80 (17g 60s)
---
* Mithril Bar x 80 (12g)
---
* Mageweave Cloth x 10 (90s)
---
* Dense Stone x 40 (5g)
---
* Thorium Bar x 70 (9g 80s)
---
* Runecloth x 10 (1g 10s)

That's 74g 96s 40c

This doesn't include any training costs nor any items you actually want Engineering for.

I actually created an Engineering spreadsheet many years ago to help calculate that very value and came up with a rough estimate of 470g based on the average price of mats at the time.

They're hiding behind and inside the inn.

Why should anyone be expected to? Didn't have to do this in Vanilla.
---
He‚Äôll be downed by numerous guilds week 1.
---
Engineering is so popular these days there‚Äôs not enough copper ores in the world to fuel the market. The select few people who are just mining while leveling and not saving them for engineering/blacksmithing can charge whatever they want.
---
I keep seeing this over and over again on this sub. People want to go dual crafting without the gatherer to compliment, or many ppl recommend herb over mining. With the way ppl on this sub push engineering as the meta you‚Äôd think they recommend mining as a gathering profession. It supports two crafting professions over herbs one. Obviously herb is relevant, esp at end game, but IMO mining is going to be in huge demand.
---
It is not that easy first of all alot of ppl had little to no computer game experience and we where pretty new to the mmorpg scene. And sins raids where made for 40 ppl you had to tailor them to the least skilled persons in the raid. Sure there are mechanics and above all decisions that had to ben made in vanilla that are no longer in the game but the pressure on the individual is alot higher in modern raids whit less ppl in the raid everyone is more important. Above all the game now days are less grindy but it is hard to equate that whit how difficult the game was. In my mind if you look at raid difficulty the game had a big upswing in TBC and smaller upwards movement every expansion until legion (last expansion I played and have any ide about)
---
You just said it yourself that this is normal for you, you‚Äôve done it before. You feel like you have a process that‚Äôs ‚Äúsafe.‚Äù I‚Äôm going to go out on a limb and say you‚Äôre young. You haven‚Äôt had people close to you die. I say that because you act like it‚Äôs something you can choose or decide to avoid.
---
I‚Äôm telling you, staying awake and being sedentary for long periods of times is a risk. Things can happen in an instant to change your health forever. Your body is much more fragile than it seems when you‚Äôre a teenager. I‚Äôm not saying you‚Äôre absolutely going to die, of course not. But taking any risk just to play a video game that will be there tomorrow with or without you is a waste.
---
Lastly, you really should reflect on why you‚Äôre so angry all the time. It really weakens any arguments you try to make if you go straight to insults.
---
This is obviously a troll post.
---
I love this so much! I would honestly buy this as a print.
---
Hell no. I find it really hard to actually get to mining nodes while leveling, as they are often on the minimap and then you show up and it's like "oh, these are in a cave or something". Beyond that, fighting in enclosed spaces makes warriors sad. Even if I intended to keep it at max level.... I need to level engineering once, I need to drink elixirs every day. I would rather have herbalism. 
---
Also, because copper is expensive, it's tough to powerlevel mining, as the low level nodes are always contested. Because silverleaf/peacebloom are basically worthless, no one picks them on a lot of servers, making it easy to farm herbalism to 100, as no one actually wants the herbs, they just want the skillups from picking them.
---
2019, you can't even be happy anymore.
---
So im gonna play a priest, but looking at those axes makes me wanna go shaman to look badass
---
Alright, so in extension, would the average dps reduction derived from spell resistance influence the resist chance of a spell like counterspell, which starts at base 75% hit chance? From my understanding, the average dps loss from + resistance is the hit rating loss for spells of that same class.
---
Get lucky.
---
It‚Äôs all good my guy. Reddit brings out the worse of us sometimes. I wish you well.
---
Lol their strength is in farming loads of unnecessary consumables for easy content. The unfortunate part is it gets all the other rejects thinking everyone should be farming a ton of consumables.
---
The Wow TCG literally exists
---
Clearly the bear pet is from the other guy closer to the gate
---
Will RPPvP Vanilla players be able to return home, too? Or are they still refusing to launch with RPPvP servers?
---
Out of the loop.
---
Raiding guilds will sometimes coordinate when they turn it in to maximize the effect for their raid night and not end up blocking each other with the cooldown. Your best bet is 7-8pm server time on the popular raid nights.
---
This will be server and faction and mood of the day dependent. A courteous person would inform others. An asshole, which there will be many of, will orchestrate the buff to fuck over other people. Like the other person said, get lucky. 
---
But really, outside of a few bosses the buff is unnecessary. And all the drama about it comes from people being bored with a summer without classic.
---
Its cheap. Maybe 100-150g.

All you have to do is keep an eye out on the locations of the major raiding teams and learn their schedule.

I think people are consistent in skill from Vanilla to now. There are just less scrubs who still play WoW.  Classic will be a joke for the first four raids because of 1.12, not because people learned the game better.

This is exactly the type of video I am talking about if you want to judge skill on any of the participants you have to have atleast a semi eaven playing field or atleast know the circumstances of the fight if you find a non edited film of a bg whit 2 good premades then we can sit and analyse and judge skill it is impossible in videos like this

yeah, people die in their sleep every day from not moving for 8 hours too right?

Nothing wrong with RPing, don't let anyone make you feel bad bro.

I‚Äôve been running windows 10 for free for years and just deal with a watermark in the bottom corner. Was gonna buy a key once it bothered me but I never ended up caring. If anything, I look at it and have a chuckle.
---
Can you share your spreadsheet?
---
8 =/= 72
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs a fantastic mouse. As long as you insert the plates correctly, it works. The software is horrible but the mouse is perfect for my hand and looks great.
---
I don‚Äôt claim to have the best possible route to 300, however I do offer several alternatives for each level range to give engineers various options to consider, depending upon market fluctuations.
---
Looking at that guide you linked, I‚Äôm curious how you expect to level from 271-289 with just 10 Thorium Widgets. The math doesn‚Äôt add up. I noticed the same problem with Copper Tube, Bronze Tube, Whirring Bronze Gizmo and Hi-Impact Mithril Slugs. How do you expect to get 15+ skill-ups only crafting 10 items?
---
Actual actual start. Try to tag mobs for 1 hour, give up and do FedEx/exploration XP
---
I usually make back my gold spent on consumes for MC from drops in raw gold. but MC is easy i think later on your guild success is based on the effort of everyone to come prepared. The guild can help out sure and gold donated is something that should be used to lighten the collective burden.
---
Can we get a calendar with pictures like this in every month
---
Real excitement doesn't look like that. Bad acting looks like that.
---
How did you even get to that conclusion? I was only stating that this is how it was in 1.12. Progressive content release also has nothing to do with a specific mechanic being as it was in 1.12, especially when Blizzard has said multiple times that mechanics would be as they were in 1.12. 
---
I think it‚Äôs completely stupid that scatter/trap/sleeps/Goblin Rocket Helm all share DRs but hey, it was in 1.12, right. Still has nothing to do with progressive patch releases.
---
Yeah, but you don't stall out on Copper, you stall out on Tin and Silver and then again with Iron and Gold, etc.
---
even if you don't sleep for 3 days you are getting out of your chair to piss every ~2 hours and changing posture/moving your legs and whatnot. it is really not a health concern for anyone that already doesn't have health issues.
---
And on top having sweaping strikes.
---
The servers don't even exist yet. No one knows how they will do it yet. Best advice is communicate about it on server when they exist!
---
Possibly later, but it's just not in a state ready for release. It is just a list of abilites and I am starting to group them by potential shared hotkeys. Honestly, I am working on alliance warrior gearing at the moment, so it probably won't be next week. Maybe after that.
---
You only have to have 4-5 pots for MC for an average raid group... 3fire protection pots 1 fre action 1 arcane protection and 3 of this thing that cleanses for like 30s. The rest are just bonuses on the meters.
---
I can see that, considering how out of touch you are with it.
---
I agree! I intend to speed run (just for fun, i suck at it) my alt :D
---
Well it‚Äôs what I said: you were a super hardcore player then. You don‚Äôt get #3 on a popular server during first week by Accident  (I think I was around 300 and I thought I played a lot) and if you play 4 hours of PvP (after raiding Naxx each night of the week mind you) then you can‚Äôt tell to ¬´¬†normal¬†¬ªpeople that you don‚Äôt remind it to be that long.
---
(and I‚Äôm not even mentioning that when Naxx was released the PvP competition was easier than a year before)
---
Now don‚Äôt misunderstand me: I‚Äôm not blaming you for playing that much but take into account when retelling your experience that you weren‚Äôt an average player.
---
Thats more like 3.5 hours since you have to show up 30 min early for invites and summons. Hope your read lead can plan ahead so you finish on time and dont do another boss 5 min before it's supposed to end.
---
Yeah, I suppose if your intention was to pick up mining for 20 levels, then abandon it, there would be almost no cost to doing so. but if you actually want to carry a profession through to 300... stalling out is an issue. That doesn't in my experience really happen with herbalism. Maybe launch will be different.
---
wow, just wow
---
Yes
---
Talk shit get hit / Bitches get stitches
---
Dilly Dilly
---
Your memory is heavily flawed then. Arcane mage has to switch between arcane blast and missiles. The difficulty is not that you must not run out of mana, it's quite the opposite actually. A good arcane mage is completly oom the moment the boss dies. Because every leftover mana is wasted dps. It's by far the hardest spec to play in tbc pve.
---
And everyone thinks they are healthy until something goes wrong.
---
Hmmm can't comment on competition but if the cost is as high as some are making out then I would be up for that competitiveness of nodes.
---
Not the one you asked and I am sure he will give you a proper rundown but here's my personal experience or rather what I observed:
---
Chinese ARK Player and Legitimate non-exploity Base Raiding is an oxymoron.
---
&gt;All these speed runs of the the strongest leveling classes No one does the crap ones like priests.
---
This is my original post. Where do you read fastest. or anything at all about speed. I can't find it anywhere. Your talking about how i'm wrong about something I didn't even say.
---
The reason for that is some people can mine 20g worth of materials per hour, or farm 50-80 gold per hour, I would rather farm gold in a practiced routine instead of running around the world in some schizophrenic line looking for nodes.
---
Are you listening to me Neo, or were you looking at the women in the red dress?
---
Well yeah, if you play on an English server then you are kind of expected to write in English.
---
Truth to power. At some point you'll realize that popular opinion isn't always the right one.
---
The Nostalgia hit me really hard when I saw the screenshot.
---
I have recently been leveling a toon on Retail and everytime I encounter someone he/she is rocking the Heirloom set.
---
Here? All kinds of different armor with nothing matching.
---
THIS is the World of Warcraft that I play.
---
I didnt see any yellow snow in beta.....
---
The Guy in the Front - is it GoTs the hound? üòÅ
---
I mean I guess, but your tanks are going to be running FR gear on Rag which means Fire damage attacks are preferred over physical damage.
---
Having a mix of physical and elemental damage is really difficult for warriors to deal with as they prefer to drop armor to maximise slot efficiency when going for resistances.
---
Yes that is what downtime is and the fact that you aren't casting spells scares me. You shouldn't have full mana after a kill ever lol. I'm thinking speed runs i think your thinking afk mob grinding. Were on two different levels and I'll just leave it at that.
---
Can you maybe explain in short words what each add on does? üòä
---
I guessed the wrong date and my vacation finishes 1 week before classis launch, rip
---
2h‚Äôs without +INT are PvP toys. Everything gets replaced. Dual wielding warriors are dps warriors. If you are 2h you are PvP spec. If your guild is fine with that and not focused on PvE have it.
---
Wheres the raging infernal ?
---
2 different beasts **"cannot be tamed"**
---
I would be so pissed as a hunter to get that far and those not be tamable.
---
Like you aren't going to need roll all the good ranged wpns...
---
Yeah. that's why I don't necessarily want to be a miner. Because I expect a lot of people, like you, are rationally thinking the exact same thing.
---
5 miners still need to gather 50 copper each to move on.
---
not sure if you are trolling me, or legit don't know...

Never played DAoC and I couldn't listen to the whole clip of the kid screaming.

there is always a need to be mean

Sorry, explain me the 4 screens. One for Wow, another one for something that actually entertains you while you play and the other 2????
---
so do I but when I think of goldshire I don't think of cows or Moustache McPonytail
---
i started in winter 05 and it was definitely the 1 tank, 1 heal, 3dps meta by that point
---
I just got killed and camped by a high level druid, and I still regard the class highly. He killed me with such grace and majesty!
---
Oh it was on the classic client my bad
---
If stamina is the best stat, then you would still wear the blue PvP set because it has more stamina than MC/BWL epics :)
---
If you're going to say something as fact, then be consistent with it.
---
It's surprising they're sending all this data to the client. I guess it's not as hidden in the modern engine as it was in vanilla. Back in the day the client didn't even know enemy health (it was just a percentage), let alone their armor or resistances.
---
Who the hell cares about armor lol. Classic bosses aren't dps race (until Naxx). His armor value is literally irrelevant.
---
&gt; here are definitely barely any more seperations between the classes and that was much better in classic/tbc without question. 
---
More complex doesn't mean better, and every class having a similar toolset doesn't make them less complex.  
---
And I never claimed that retail is *hard* mechanics wise, just a lot harder than classic.
---
Destro Lock + Rogue,
---
SPriest + Rogue
---
They did dynamic respawns when they originally launched wow btw which has been confirmed by multiple devs
---
Mmyeeeahh did you get the memo?
---
Parry rating can affect on threat generates by the tank. If it is a big deal then dumping rage on hs can be ill advised.
---
Nobody thinks you need to farm consumes just to clear MC, but you need to farm consumes to clear MC in 35 minutes. It has never been about whether or not you're going to clear the content on Pservers, its about how fast you can do it.
---
Also there are potions that absorb 2k shadow damage, are you trying to insinuate that having one of those in a fight against a shadow priest wouldn't be an absolute game changer?
---
They are actually amazing with gear. Best PvP healers, 1st/2nd depending on who is competing with you in PvE (longer fights, never had a priest come close) but again, hard to tell with skill level/overheal. 
---
You only need 21 pts into holy tree in PvE or PvP which frees up a lot of talent points for you to do something else. 
---
Pretty great if you are looking to heal.
---
"Were you listening to me Neo or were you looking at the woman in the red dress?".
---
You trying to get an extremely common name? Depends on the name you want. If you make a unique name, there shouldn‚Äôt be anything to worry about. But if you‚Äôre going for something common then you just have to be quick I guess, that‚Äôs all their is to it.
---
I had an undead warlock on vanilla but if I had to go again, Orc hands down. With the sheer number of stuns you can resist and rogues being your bane, Id take Orc 10/10.
---
And this the exact reason the mmorpg is the laughing stock of the gaming industry. Blizzard was so close to completely changing the genre for the better again but blew it with layering
---
My best friends and I did this in 2004.  
---
At one point, we took an all-day hike to try to get away from our excitement for WoW planning, and all we did was talk about WoW all day in the wilderness.
---
Will classy Friday continue after the game is released?
---
You're missing the point. 
---
An offtank spamming hamstring has higher Nightfall uptime than an Enh shaman which also being actually useful in other areas. You can definitely take an Enh shaman if you want, but it's not better.
---
There is almost 0 overlap in BiS ranged weapons for hunters and warriors/rogues
---
More like Gay-shire \*laughs in horde\*
---
Just kidding you did a great job!
---
Im considering ordering pizza from Irvine add a note with my 3 names and my battlenet account then label it "For Ion ;)"
---
Or maybe you can stop being bad at mages and delay the blink, or Blink&gt;Iceblock&gt;Coldsnap, or Blink/LAP, and again beat the crap out of the sorry Rogue.
---
Stop wasting my time
---
pretty sure it's to get a green wand early and that increases your leveling time significantly enough that it's worth it to rush it
---
Doesn't matter what the requirement or decay is. You still have to have more honor than everyone else on your faction with vanilla/classic pvp.
---
Wow what a trip, I played on Dethecus with Bas and Sab in Months Behind and remember coordinating with our alliance sister guild (Bas had 2 wow subs and played as Sab as alliance) to grief alliance lowbies in menethil. It wasn't until much later that I realized Angwe's antics were known outside the server. Crazy to see these ppl posted on here lol
---
Don't give up on your dreams, man.  
---
They promised Oceanic servers -  you can flee to South East Asia and disappear.
---
This is not 100% correct. My brother got rank 14 as a Druid without a guild or pre-made. 
---
But it required a ridiculous amount of effort i.e. 12 hour days without missing ANY day.
---
Can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre memeing maybe meningitis
---
It would turn into TBC
---
haha, thats weird.
---
As long as you don't eat it you shall be okey!
---
Definitely a preference thing for sure I much prefer alliance races and cities
---
Yea....when I was a kid a long time ago they had not even invented clothes. I remember I had to roll myself in mud to cover up my naked body....and it was before food too. We had to eat churned up rocks...

---
yeah, that's pretty low iq
---
For PvE? Sure. But if you're trying for an Elemental set for PvP there's a load of gear available to wreck face.
---
[Example](https://www.classicwowtools.live/character/d12bca6e80be4965f706a27dd51f64ee2dd004e0879979e7d02fbee39460b56c95f2a6e5f5a664f68afe8032672e6544587ef643e61f72a5cc7ab7bbe6c2fd12902d466485814b0e627f91467501673bebf52c99f91c55957d9620a1821c750e9e5d1fc10c5641e349f96bd4d03ad1209ce78158b27981fc0c0fb642e5f7a7dc66078f2575e0104125280ccc468a9274e70e68bedce8f4a8cc282d8ee41ac1d62e278ebdaa14c8abb24268afa8ba697d738bb459cf4961f1fbc236a8f5)
---
Dwarf. Hands down. Free loot on a fresh server with treasure finding. Stoneform is OP in PVP, you can get out of pesky rogue blinds and crippling poisons with ease. Armor looks great on dwarves. You‚Äôll also be a more unique race.
---
A 3-letter name.. yeah I don‚Äôt give myself good odds
---
Blue PVP shaman set isnt bad, its HORRIBLY bad.
---
Despite having a good chunk of stamina, its a mess on stats for any viable PVP spec (I pity any fools pvping @60 as Enhancement)
---
Elemental wears a mix of mail and cloth items with caster stats, no piece of PVP set is useful to ele shammy.
---
Resto uses Tier sets, far superior than anything for a healer, and this is the only shaman clad in full mail.
---
Known vanilla fact for most classes is that PVE sets are BIS for PVP. And also have more Stamina than blue PVP sets
---
With talents, reviving a pet is 4 sec and can be done in combat.    
---
It can be a way of guaranteeing a boss kill, one pet dies? no matter, it's back in 4secs and another has aggro.    
---
Literally necromancers.
---
Lol really do you have the statistics to back that up, did you do a survey of the literal millions of people who are going to play and have never visited reddit or the wow forums in their lives?
---
I thought I was bashing stupid people?
---
All of the crying.
---
MC and BWL were always going to be easy.  This is on patch 1.12.  The gear buffs / class balances are all done.  For it to be any sort of challenge, they would have to buff the raids.  Period.
---
Dynamic respawns were present in the actual launch of classic, btw, as been confirmed by multiple devs who worked on it
---
She was 4 manned before TBC pre-patch and 3 manned during TBC pre-patch.
---
And why do you need to clear MC in 35 minutes exactly? I thought this was supposed to be a social experience not a silent race to the end like retail.
---
Any footage showing that 4 man? I hadn't heard of that.
---
yes, let‚Äôs find all these excuses on why this isn‚Äôt an issue with the underlying system &lt;.&lt;
---
Because you private server kiddos ONLY play on patch 1.12.1.  Please, by all means, go play on a 1.3 server.  Then get back to me.
---
Maybe in 2005, but the player today will be a lot more informed. If say a ret pala beats a rogue, then kick the rogue cuz he obviously doesnt know what the F he is doing...
---
What if I told you there‚Äôs a pservers which doesn‚Äôt allow Chinese ip addresses to play....
---
Imagine telling your customers "you don't want to wait in queue to play on this cohesive server, you want us to decide *for* you what it is you want!"
---
Long rant about these "no alternative" BiS Lists - I mean no disrespect to the creator of the site, it's well made and serves its purpose but don't just blindly follow one of these and regard all other loot as worthless - that is not the case, and even *if* the items are mathematical BiS for your spec, the upgrade from other, comparable items might not be as huge as you think.
---
**What I mean is:** It's important to know what your class/Spec wants stat-wise and not just blindly follow one specific chart. If you just want a convenient way to look at it, this site is brilliant, but don't follow any one BiS list unless it is 100% confirmed that the gear listed is mathematically *the* best. You'll most likely not get your BiS gear right away regardless outside of Pre-raid stuff, as there's so few loot, so rolling on nothing but "List X" gear isn't the smartest idea.
---
Do your research, know your stats and don't disregard all loot that isn't BiS. There's tons of good loot in WoW, many items which were underappreciated for years, so don't just try to get BiS. It might not even be that big of an upgrade, or even be the best item for you anyway if you just follow 1 list.
---
Week 1 seems possible with accountsharing or insane nolifing (think like 10 hours of sleep throughout the week).
---
Dwarfs:
---
 + have a magnificent beard
---
Nelfs:
---
 - don't have a magnificent beard
---
Dwarf hunter without a doubt
---
On a serious note: just take what is visual more pleasant for you or else you won't have much fun leveling your hero - regardless how powerful the racials would be.
---
thank you so much, this is exactly what i was looking for! really appreciate it!
---
I would be very surprised if the ST class quests were not in. I get why you cannot do DM, BWL, ZG quests. But ST is in the game and it is 1.12.
---
If they aren't in this means many other quest also may not be in the game or in previous forms (even bugged). Im guessing they are in otherwise its a ton more work for like maybe 2-3 items that are only good on a few classes. I mean they would have to remove many holiday quests as they were added, change timbermaw hold and quests, STV fishing wouldn't be in, Many extra quests that where added as the game developed... That is a ton of work. Instead if you just don't load ZG, BG, DM, etc. content and/or npcs it literally takes care of itself.
---
The other and you can get that for sure.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13965/blackhands-breadth
---
Pretty sure no raids will be open in phase 1, so have fun with that
---
Thanks for this, it's a fantastic read.
---
Never had this problem literally ever? Where are you playing???
---
Mauradon is a bloody mess, good luck getting through that
---
Russians in BfA are weird, they are either absolutely awful players and can't communicate, or they know a little English and are above average players, there's no middle ground from what I've seen. So joining a Russian dungeon group as a pug is pretty big gamble, haha.
---
well yes, ragnaros was cleared on pserver with level 58s  and supposedly private server had their bosses OVERTUNED.  Imagine that.
---
Only if it's on Moonguard.
---
Gun spec means nothing later on, but if you enjoy that sound then I'd say dwarf.
---
NE starting zone will be busy on launch day.
---
It is three names per account for the name reservation on the 13th.
---
Wrong again
---
Because the sheeple on twitch loves to mimic their streamers behaviors.  
---
Sodapoppin for example, was camped so many times by a few of them that he ragequitted his stream. Very satisfying.
---
So that person sat on this video for a month the uploaded it? 
---
Probably not.
---
In terms of classes for the raid, the weakest link will be Warriors as they're the slowest levelers. Hakurai's guide gets them to 60 in just over 5 days /played with 300 herb, 300 alch, 300 first aid plus I think attunements completed.
---
I think it's possible but I don't think it's probable.
---
Lol I enjoyed this
---
Tell me more
---
It is the same as it is at lvl 10.
---
Starts with 1g and caps at 50g per respec.
---
He was fishing all the time
---
Does anyone else think with all the weird combat calculations that are coming out of the woodwork that something might affect boss armor calculations (especially with armor pen).  Like boss armor cant be reduced beyond say \~30% or something or that there is diminishing returns so that it isnt just a flat boss has X armor - Y (sunders, faerie fire, etc) = final armor count?
---
because of "could've", which, spoken out, sounds like "could of" 
---
Still looks stupid.
---
Great evidence 
---
I like this one i think its from TBC - but i was told these didn't change by everyone.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBOCOfSyORc
---
This guys is using a different system (part of Mob AI) But with the current leeway he would have had his face kicked in. 
---
There is so much evidence proving leeway is totally different on classic than vanilla. The only other videos i have seen is when two people are moving away from each other you can find single cases of long distances (more consistent with an ACTUAL leeway system or latency.)
---
U dont know Payo
---
Yes he will, he was killed on the latest p.server with a bunch of level 58's. Why do you expect it to be any different this time? And Yes that guild was APES. The same one that will play on retail. Considering previous statement saying that p.servers had their dungeons and raids overtuned, it reinforces the idea that retail will be even easier.
---
The thing you have to realize is gold is only generated from 2 sources in-game. It either comes from quest rewards or mobs (through vendoring shit mobs drop or the actual gold the mobs drop). So early expansion there won't be much inflation because there simply won't be that much gold in existence.
---
Ill post post my same comment from yt on this video:
---
This really isn't content, this is a 1 min video and doesn't give even the slightest bit of depth. Do I enjoy BFA? Not even slightly. I went hard at launch of bfa I grinded high level keys and got bis gear I went balls to the wall. I realized it was crap before the first raid launched, but I had fun with hard content. I left and dabbled in vanilla pservers and it was hard and good and I enjoyed it as much. Just wait and shut up like the rest of us, this video is you trying to gain subs from outrage and its weak and unsophisticated. 
---
Show less
---
Don't think so.
---
As someone who has recently leveled a rogue on a vanilla server with a sleeping girlfriend, and a loud keyboard in the room rogue is a great choice. You spend a lot of time waiting on energy, and you will be if your playing it right, as a rogue you will be setting things up and if played right being tactical, and the payoff is fun gameplay while leveling. But do you in the end. Quick tip too for you "1 spam" problem Gouge is your fastest ability for tagging mobs on rogue.
---
I have great "3D vision" (as my geology professor called it), but the problem in ST is that everything looks the same on each level, so knowing where each important thing is and what you can skip when going up and down the stairs all the time can be really difficult.
---
It was done on retail. in 5mans  way back in the day
---
Difference is that I actually played TBC and raided on a priest, while you just throw some assumptions out
---
I was leaning on Night Elf until I realised how great T1 looks on dwarves. If we're talking about males then their bow animation is miles ahead too. Plus as a Night Elf I'd feel pressured to always use a cat which goes against the whole point of the class. So yeah.. I don't even know if I'm going hunter yet but if I do it'll definitely be a dwarf
---
Fair enough
---
R13 female troll priest with Benediction &lt;3
---
Social life?
---
I 100% disagree
---
Furor is critical to leveling, that's why virtually every guide says you need to get it early on.
---
It allows you to kill faster in cat
---
Gives you instant feral charge for bear or lead with a maul for a huge threat boost while tanking.
---
Wow. Just wow. It would be cool to see villagers in game to do some random stuff tho.
---
Now that's really nice! And I spot the Goldshire footman ready for action!
---
Yeah, streaming is all about that overreaction
---
It's a "whole" game, you will eventually get to your goal. There aren't patches that constantly make your progress useless. And if Blizzard is true to their word, the game will be a museum, therefore never changing. You will have all the time in the world.
---
You don't have to log in for mandatory content, there aren't dailies or world quests that "you better complete this", its a massive sandbox ladder progression system and the speed with which you climb that ladder doesn't matter. You will be fine, the only thing that will be a problem is raiding, but once it settles down and you are in a good guild, they will take you for the ride. There is no content that only hardcore players can do, except rank 14, but in this case all the time in the world isn't enough.
---
Supposedly they bought GM services for real cash on private servers. Manipulating the game so they got their way. This is just a rumor though, and I don't know if it's real.
---
Who cares about other people‚Äôs progress really. Classic wow is all about the adventure. Enjoy it when you can, you‚Äôll eventually get to where everyone else will be in your own set pace.
---
With all their cooldowns mage would be pretty good. 
---
I don't know anything about rogue talents, but 1v1 they could definitely be the strongest due to stun lock and stuff. 
---
Problem is that so many classes would have one-shot potential, that a bit of extra damage output or whatever becomes irrelevant.
---
tbf it was a lot harder at 15fps and 500ms connection, they had to keep the mechanics simple because you were predicting what moves you should do based on where your character hypothetically is while your screen is totally lockedu p because two mages cast arcane explosion at the same time and somene did an emote, overloading the server
---
You literally just explained why layering is pointless btw. If tourists won't want to wait in queues they'll just go back to retail
---
How do you pronounce it btw, Goldsh-eye-r or Gold-sheer?
---
Exactly, I am happy if I can play for an entire hour a day. And that would be generous. üòÇ
---
Yeah by people in Naxx gear. Which was... wait for it... 1.12!
---
And maybe 6-10 hours on weekends. Jeez that's not casual. Sounds like this dude will be fine.
---
Moon Guard is available right now. You dont need classic.
---
These 2 comments above mine make me cry.
---
Are you missing the part where the best private server speedrunners have demonstrated time and time again that they can consistently get ahead of the pack? All this on much bigger launches and competing with many more players compared to the layered Classic launch.
---
There's quite a bit of rng to it IMO and some things we just don't know. Like how big are layers going to be day 1, do you get in and on your layer there are just a bunch of noobs or people who want to take it slow etc? If you're playing alliance, did more horde get in on your layer than alliance? Did more humans get in than gnomes if your a gnome? The best thing u can do I guess is to try to coordinate with guildies to get in on the best layer possible for your situation, and continually swap if need be depending on the cooldown thing they are adding.
---
 You could play WoW with your gf that way she won't get upset if you spend a lot of time playing it.
---
I love it when people ride the hype train all the way to crazy town.
---
Ofcourse it is. You won't be as quickly geared as the hardcore but there will always be thousands in the same situation as us to raid with.
---
!RemindMe August 26
---
Shame that video suffers from the OMG what is that musack issue. :P
---
Saying that pservers are guessing is sort of like saying that when the weatherman tells you its going to rain tomorrow he's "guessing" even though there's a probability and a confidence interval associated with that prediction.
---
Oi! Give back my dildo!
---
Yeah man fucking retail crowd!!! Bosses like mythic Uunat is so fucking cake compared to the real challenge Onyxia!!1!
---
Agreed m8. Beta for ass a lot is the all time low point imo, and I‚Äôve played all of them at a mid to high extend. The wait for classic is gruesome, can‚Äôt wait. Glad it‚Äôs not 2 long now !
---
Yeah I know, they prouded themselves on being toxic assholes. I just don't mind it. In fact, i enjoy them being assholes. Drama is always entertaining.
---
Right exactly this.  Never had a problem in WC - but sunken temple can go fuck itself.
---
like one got stuck in his rectum?
---
Didn't the devs undertune/lower the lvl of Rag multiple times and respawn him each time? The even said it in the server announcement.
---
So which rag is this data from?
---
Yeah we could do that in 2005 with no world buffs, consumables or optimized specs/debuffs and at least a third of our roster was kinda bad so it shouldn't pose a problem for most players I would assume.
---
I think we all want streamers to be contained on one server.
---
And then at happened after you looked good?
---
I‚Äôve never taken a wrong turn in WC.  Fite me.
---
Imagine actually caring this much about what server streamers play on. There's no chance this will happen and even if it was possible this isn't the right place to ask about it. That being said I imagine a lot of them will end up playing on similar servers anyway since their communities have a lot of crossover and some of them seem to be pretty good friends.
---
You just made me want to roll a hunter called Legolamb. :D
---
I mean no, there‚Äôs 3 different bits where you can go the wrong way on the right side of WC alone.  It doesn‚Äôt matter that much if you go wrong though you just end up killing a bit more trash than you needed to.
---
omfg MORE OF THESE
---
You don't, I'm just pointing out that the hardcore pserver guilds aren't farming consumes because they can't clear without them. I got over the hardcore raiding scene pretty quickly, if you like your guildmates a longer raid night is actually a good thing.
---
&gt;More respected
---
Hunters aren‚Äôt respected at all, so don‚Äôt you worry about that part.
---
I‚Äôve never understood why people posted useless self-serving sidebrag comments like this.
---
hey guys follow my twitch channel !!
---
Lots of guys got wood at that Inn.

Said Johny the BFA player, leveled 60 after completing every quest from the list of leveling guide addon, with his talent tree copied from online guide, geared in online-found BiS list, listening to commands from DBM, using a boss kill strategy designed and perfected over 15 years by tens of best raiding guilds. 
---
So EZ.
---
Maybe try to play the game actually on your own instead of copying what other determined (by tial and error) as working solutions and then we can see your true skill.
---
In Stormwind‚Äôs Trade District.
---
Why don't you read phases announcement before making claims?
---
So bad, made me cringe
---
Ill get 2-3 hours once a week. Perhaps ill hit 60 sometime 2020...
---
Most people play games just to relax, just like some people like to watch movies, read a book, etc.
---
People were doing Ony in low group sizes before Naxx was released.
---
It's the curse of competence.
---
You know what to do to succede, there is no exploration and discovery. 
---
I have wasted thousands of hours in strategy games, until i suddenly knew what to do in any situation ingame. (against AI) therefore... i couldn't be bothered anymore, the best feeling, the feeling of building something. Disappeared when i so simply knew it only took time to achieve it, and that i could only do mistakes on the journey than achieve anything worthwhile.
---
Good point
---
Which is what im hoping for. The main reason why i quit wow in the first place is because my progression was destroyed by each new expansion, which felt like was every 6 months (i know it wasnt...)
---
This could make me a permanent paycheck for blizzard ;)
---
Nooo I've been rumbled
---
I thought you meant 30 - 39 the first time I read this lol
---
No as I think it'll require a log-in to the game. Plus it's also clearly a shameless ploy to get a free month's sub out of all the Classic players
---
What if 8 million showed up, all armed with weapons? Neither hypotheticals would ever happen, so it‚Äôs pointless to even make the argument.
---
This may be related to an unexpected location. Higher quality addons only load some parts after an event (such as entering an instance) to conserve memory/cpu processing
---
the fuck? What national secrets that could result in the deaths of millions?
---
OKAAYYYG GUYS
---
GUYS
---
LISTEN GUYS
---
WE ALL KNOW PALADIN IS A HARD COUNTER
---
GUYS WE ALL KNOW PALADIN IS A HARD COUNTER TO WARLOCKS
---
OKAY GUYS LISTEN
---
So excited for classic!
---
Make another tank warrior, but in shield block position.
---
The image was giving me weird D√©j√† vu vibes... I was watching Staysafe's stream yesterday for a bit and remember seeing your yell message for a moment as he was quickly running past you, took a second look at the image now and yep that's it. Kinda funny seeing it from a different perspective.
---
It really is, so much nostalgia!
---
Your'e criticizing a massive resource for research while simultaneously suggesting people do their research. I honestly feel like you are talking just to talk.
---
Yeah it really is, so much nostalgia!
---
Create character before launch
---
On an English server? If you run a Chinese guild, then by all means have a recruitment message in Chinese. Same for Swedish, French or fucking Swahili.
---
He's a real man and you're a fuckin weeb, how does it feel?
---
You‚Äôre forgetting about latency.
---
How many names can you reserve on 13th August?
---
I may get a friend to make my character and then delete it for me on the day
---
 For my warlock I will go for mining+skinning while leveling. Bag space is going to be an issue with having both of them on a new server without bags available. My plan is to basically not pick up skins and leather until I am at like level 35:ish. As a warlock you don't need gold for a mount so should be fine. When I am around level 35 there should be 14 slots bags available in the AH( I'm not going to level very fast). With 14 slots bags mining+skinning will become possible. At that point I will start saving leather and skins.
---
 I will keep both professions at 60 until the ZG phase. At that point I will drop skinning and get tailoring so tailoring+mining. Will keep that for a bit and eventually drop mining for engineering. Will have saved up mining mats on bank alts to make it possible to level "for free".
---
Hope that price holds, I‚Äôm going to be dumping about 1 mil I made during legion
---
I get the hate with the popular streamers, with the fanboy followings, but whats with painting everybody with the same brush? next people will want severs for the blacks, gays , french &amp; Germans....oh wait...
---
Nah you just seriously need to unwind. My pro tipp go full rp and sink into the game. If you walk in cities instead of running you start taking shit serious. Feel the safety of your capital. When outside feel watched by wildlife, enjoy views. Just caaaaalm down.
---
fair play to that sir
---
How much money can you save each month for your hobby before it meets your criteria of being rich?
---
Pronounced:
---
Gold-Sheer
---
I am skeptical. Most of the money, to my mind, is in elixirs.
---
First of all, you can't buy them for very cheap prices from vendors, like you can healing potions. Secondly, you can't easily farm them by opening chests. Finally, they are used at a much higher rate. An elixir, you use every hour, possibly more if you die. A healing potion, you could go a few hours without using them, and the ones that want them while leveling might know to check the vendors regularly and buy them for 3 silver each, while supplies last.
---
Bottom screen main game window, top screen divided by 4 or 9 with wow clients. 
---
Side screens spotify and guides on other or just internet or something.
---
If you were not biased you would add the patch when they added DR to CC and the date of release.
---
Patch 1.4 DR were added in May 2005.
---
For 10 months trap had no DR it was fixed in 1.10 Mars 2006
---
2.01 came out in December 2006.
---
Ok 10 months &gt; 8 months but it's not " vast majority"
---
Beside during this era, it was common knowledge that a hunter was shit if he was doing scatter/trap, good hunter managed just fine.
---
Yes, because OP was obviously the only player online during the event, the only player recording his combat logs and the only player able to read system messages announcing they were removing the current Ragnaros to spawn a downscaled one for lvl 40 players. My god you're dumb.
---
So cant a NE because that one opens first guaranteed.
---
Never.
---
Agreed.
---
Chickens are alive, can't be the real Goldshire.
---
Sure you can, if you get bursted down in the initial stunlock. Which doesn't even require that much gear in vanilla. Rogue duels are almost entirely decided by the opener.
---
What. Your statement clearly implies rogues are a fast leveling class. Youre either a troll or super fucking stupid
---
Love iiiittt
---
For me the worst part was feeling simultaneously starving and unbelievably nauseous.  The angry and taunting voices didn't help either.  Hope you are doing better, it's a struggle but I've not had an episode like that in years.
---
I was on Dethecus as well on Horde.  Didn't you guys steal a Nef kill from Watch Your Back?
---
So inefficient doing collect shit from mobs
---
Missed it by like an hour because I was playing Stardew Valley.
---
Time consumed does not equal difficult
---
Or when you could just throw some crushed fade leaf in their face... Oh that's right will be able to do that again.

I absolutely love it!!
---
&gt;That era of people being die hard dedicated to MMORPGs is long gone. The lack of subscription numbers for WoW, FFXIV, or anything really has little to do with the gameplay but the market. MMOs in general have been in a subscription decline for a while now.
---
Now this I don't really agree with. The only thing that has been in decline is subs for WoW, which, if anyone truly expected it to keep the 13 million constantly was just delusional, and even then it's still a success monetarily today. Everquest at its peak only reached 550,000. I've always disliked this idea of "Well it didn't reach WoW numbers, the genre is dying/dead"
---
When in reality MMOs as an actual genre, and not just WoW, are doing better than they ever did in the Everquest days. Yes plenty of mmos have closed down but a lot of that was due to that era of "We NEED a WoW of our own!!!" that every publisher/developer was pushing. 10 years ago the only mmo anyone cared about really was WoW, and every other mmo was trying to be what it was. Today you have WoW, FFXIV, ESO, GW2, and I'm sure there's the odd other one I'm missing. Even the only other sub based mmo I listed, FFXIV, is at double the sub numbers of peak EQ.
---
promoting inofficial servers isn't allowed here, is it?
---
I have no quarrel with playing resto however, if I wanted to pvp as elemental how much of an issue would that be? Considering gold costs and such
---
Despite not related to the topic, I find this stuff hilarious. Hence I must upvote it
---
Not sure yet if I will do it yet.. But I'll probably buy BFA on a new account for the stress test, my old account is lost to the time.. And I don't really fancy recovering it should that even be possible. So I'll have a month of BFA time and no classic-time. I'll check it out. If I like it I'll continue playing it, for the parts that I enjoy. If I don't, well then I don't, and will play just classic.
---
#BLOODLUST NOW!!!!
---
If I just did oceanic then is there a way to transfer my existing account?
---
Good glad you found you‚Äôre main! I‚Äôve decided on a Tauren Druid cause I‚Äôve never played a Tauren past level 10, been mainly on alliance side since 2004 and have never used Ferel Druid and also never healed so wanted to try something completely new. Feels good and I‚Äôm looking forwards to reliving my past years of WoW in a different light.
---
Yeah its, WASD.
---
The things you mentioned are mainly because i'm so used to some buttons. C for character window for example and mouse4 for charge. I tried to map the stances to my mouse but it did not feel right. I do think it would make the most sense to bind them to the mousebuttons. I' kinda torn on this.
---
Charge in vanilla is way less used as it is in the newer expansions (at least as a tank) so maybe i just need to relearn it on another key. Especially as it needs battle stance in vanilla.
---
As for berserker stance: i mainly do pve as a tank, so berserker stance is less used compared to a pvp scenario. The real used comes from pummel and berserker rage and i plan to use stance switch macros for those.
---
Yeah but it will be like a full raid group
---
There is an animation list in the bottom right corner.
---
Name checks out
---
&gt; This, along with the hope that this time round the player base will be more tolerant to non traditional end game builds, made my choice simple.
---
Wait, are you expecting to raid as ele or enh?
---
You can basically only get free game time if your time is worth nothing, it should not be the reason you play retail.
---
Someone salty over a tree?
---
I agree with OP in sense that modern gaming became more twitch action based. You see you cue and you press the right button
---
Strategic planning and preparation, resource management ... that is missing
---
But given availability of information, it wont take long for BfA kids to catch up... provided they make it to lvl60
---
It would be pretty good if they all went on the same server.
---
Then they can do "collabs" and interact with eachothers, so a positive thing for them. For viewers it would also mean they could play on multiple streamers server, since it would be same server.
---
It would also be good for all of us that don't want to have streamers on our servers.
---
The only issue I can see is that their servers would be very unstable. Imagine several of the biggest streamers going live at the same time and holding some event with the viewers.
---
Shaman cast Hooflust now!!
---
Oh fuckin' figure it out..
---
I asked this from battle.net customer service. This is a direct quite I got from the customer service:
---
This is xxxx from Customer Support at your service, I hope you are doing well.¬†
---
In order to be able to play WoW Classic on EU realms you will have to have active paid game time on EU retail servers.¬†
---
You can just create a new Starter account on EU realms and then add 30 days of game time and you will have full access to the EU WoW Classic.
---
I hope this information was helpful and I wish you a very nice day.
---
Yeah...I don't understand what that hope is based in at all.
---
Ikr is like I'm on my heals so trade/friendlist get other healers then tell trade 4 healers looking to stomp bgs
---
&gt; The idea of levelling as enhancement
---
&gt; The idea of moving later into elemental for end game will be where I want to end up.
---
I guess elemental.
---
Human? idk
---
I know a lot of people that just hated wow at bc so went pirate i bet they will come back to live classic.
---
Not sure about all the holiday pets listed on this page but [here](https://classic-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Companion) is a list of vanity pets available in Classic that looks pretty accurate.
---
Because i still want to do a bit harder pve content and classic doesnt have that. Thats also the only thing i will do on retail - clearing a new raid on the highest difficulty upon release.
---
I am consistently disappointed by seemingly all of these physical DPS guides and their failure to ever mention 'A Taste of Flame' that awards Wyrmhide Spaulders. 
---
Such an insanely budgeted item and it so easy to get and will serve you well through even really all of MC if needed. It would be good and worth doing even if it had only 1% hit to tide you over until you get truestrike or tier 1, but nope it just fucking goes way beyond that and gives you the entire 2% hit. 
---
Yes truestrike is an upgrade that you mentioned in UBRS, but it is such an incredibly rare drop that is so highly contested it's easy to do 50+ UBRS runs and not get them.
---
do you expect there to be a lot of english speaking raiding guilds on oceanic servers? or is it just going to be Aussies with piss poor connections?
---
Not in blues/t1 when content was current
---
Stress test is open to everyone with with WoW subscription.
---
The guy was a known retard on /r/Eve for the longest time. Also had a post history about chemtrails and cloudbusting type conspiracy shit.
---
It adds attack power. It is litteraly BiS for hunter in phase one. 
---
As a hunter who leveled up on a private server before I can tell you that for the most part we are courteous to rogues and warriors when it comes to rolling on this most of the time, but I would be careful with being an asshole to your hunter in a BRD run, they might just tell you to fuck off and roll on it.
---
That would explain it.
---
As far as I know pfUI is not planned for classic, a good alternative is  zUI [https://github.com/Ko0z/zUI](https://github.com/Ko0z/zUI)
---
Not for the same reasons as op
---
Roll rogue run to stormwind do quests to get the most hack level 19 chest in game stay 19 go to barrens with a nelf Hunter tame a lion and kill noobs.
---
Not to mention getting your tanks and melee 300 fire resist and casters 150 for Rag? o_O
---
NE Female are hot
---
Male Dwarves are majestic
---
Take your pick.
---
He didn't bug out and play the rising animation twice. This isn't blizzlike! #Nochanges
---
/sarcasm
---
Get out Chad!!
---
What you're missing, I'm saying the time I played week 1 was FAR less required and far less honor required to rank high.
---
I'm not saying some casual person playing an hour a day will get rank 1.
---
You really only need 40 players at 60 and tanks with Fire res gear.
---
The attunement is done in 20 minutes, and whoever isnt 60 will be farming mats for Fire Protection Potions.
---
As long as everyone is 60, it doesnt matter if it takes 10 hours to clear MC. It's not that difficult.
---
if you choose to raid ull be forced to heal, hope you dont mind
---
I‚Äôm having this same convo in my head about Priest. I think in the end Fear Ward is more valuable to me but I just love the flips and shadowmeld into mind control.
---
Nobody needs FR for Rag except tanks.
---
Hunters are lol you just distract and sprint they can't shoot you at all.
---
Name him/her  ‚ÄúShambulance‚Äù
---
That's over in Thunderbluff.
---
Sleep deprivation can lead to serious problems, physiological and psychological.  Not going to tell you how to live your life but you should be at least aware of what you are getting yourself into.  Genuinely binge alcohol use is less damaging, sleep deprivation ain't nothing to fuck with especially on a regular basis.
---
There's no such thing as negative resistances afaik.
---
Any Hunter is going to get squashed what are they gonna use raptor strike? Like that not shooting things in 10 yards really doesn't work against melee.
---
Sure but it‚Äôs not Magic.
---
Lmao leeway 12y range. Are they trying to fuck it up?
---
Glad thats only applicable in duels then and every 3 minutes, I guess.
---
"Geofram" in honor of the twice banned troll from this sub.

Do the last stress test would be your best option.

Hi, /u/NinePointEight-

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ccouvp/what_can_i_expect_from_playing_shadow_priest/).

Opening with every poison and icy weapon.
---
Well, Im just a big fan of the Crows in general, one of my favorite animals. In the Wild crows hang around wolves, and flies ahead of the wolves to locate prey for them. And in return the wolves leave some prey for the crows
---
So I would love to use a Wolf as my hunter Pet and a Crow as the non-combat Pet for the combination
---
How is it not relevant? You can reduce armor by 3995 with debuffs. The increase in damage from lowering armor by flat amounts are exponential. The boss having 0 armor is a massive difference compared to the boss having say 1500 armor.
---
This is why I quit retail wow (in cata), always felt I had something that just had to be completed. Usually this was dailies or getting through all heroics. Miss games that let you log in and just do whatever you wanted. Fighting the day away at tarren mill and still feeling like you accomplished something was great.
---
You lucky bitch.
---
Dwarf Female are hottest. Easy pick.
---
Diablo Mobile player detected.
---
Yeah, I had no idea what I was talking about.
---
Stress test would be the easiest option. Outside of that, during the August 13th name reservation, you can mess with some of the settings. You most likely won't be about to do any sort of Interface/addon customization.
---
Murlocs!
---
The awesome part about vanilla is you don't need to be competent to succeed. You can very easily ding 60 by phase 4 and still catch up to all the no lifers in time for naxx (assuming they follow an authentic vanilla timeline)
---
Take your time, smell the roses. Get lost in that cave you had no reason to explore. Discover the mysteries that nobody bothered to look into. The vanilla world is full of unexplored possibilities to this day.
---
This guide is specifically for non Hunter classes
---
And if you look at Joanna's guide, you will need to buy items as well. I usually just skip those quests as they aren't chains.
---
/train
---
More of an arena/duel thing but yeah, it happened a lot more often then you‚Äôd probably think. I regretted rolling nelf rogue relatively quickly but was too far invested to do anything about it.
---
Nobody does this anymore. You just need a couple fpps and you‚Äôre good to go. Tank needs a couple pieces. But the old method is gone
---
Doesnt seem to be the case. Look up the "Kel'Thuzad only has 3000 armor" thread.
---
Iceblock dispells both
---
and it's located in Sydney Australia along with retail ones.  
---
and I believe there will be 3, a PVE and PVP and a Moonguard server.  
---
 
---
and you ping will be fucking shocking mate, invest in a good tunnel or VPN, the game gets weird at 600ms.

That's my problem with Classic right now. Like atm I'm playing on a private server and have been for many years now, but I only ever log on to do something productive. I log on to raid, to check auctions, to do a scholo run for runes etc. If there's not something tangible to get then I feel no desire to play. It didn't used to be like this and I'm worried I'll burn out on Classic because now I actually have to pay for the game where at least on the private servers I could raid log for free.
---
When classic WoW was first announced all I wanted to do was race 60. I told myself I‚Äôm going to play on a PvP server and be the best geared hardcore PvPer and Raider. But I realized soon that I would hate myself. I‚Äôd constantly be worried about being efficient and not enjoying the game at all. So I‚Äôm going to roll PvE and I‚Äôll hit 60 when I do. You have to let yourself be immersed in the world and remember that the whole point is to have fun, not be the most efficient well geared player. There will always be someone better than you anyway.
---
Currently it's around 130k gold, at least on NA realms.
---
You can buy the token and just either let it sit there until you want to redeem it, or add ~$15 to your Battle Net balance and that can be used for game time.
---
If decay is lower, you can be in the top 5% instead of 0.5% and still make progress.
---
Numbers made up.
---
Nope, hemo will not be used, even with 16 debuff slots.
---
This hinges on the assumption that you even get an add phase. Which is doubtful given his current health and armor values.
---
Well, in this case it was said that 800k signed up, so it's not pointless as there is a basis for thinking if what people say, thst they all would just get killed and stopped, just wouldn't be true if all of the people who signed up did end up showing up.
---
Doubt it. Week 1 people will be struggling to get to 60 still. Even the most hardcore players are looking at 4-5 days solid play. With sleeping involved maybe by the end of the week you have a hardcore guild with enough 60's. 
---
He still needs gear, still needs resistance items. These groups you hear about doing speed runs, or very few people are not doing it in green gear.
---
I'd suggest an owl in the absence of a crow lol
---
Sounds like you are already burned out tbh. I wouldnt be hyped for a game i've been playing for years either, you're in that phase of an expansion where all you do is wait for the new expansion the X.3 patch and beyond.
---
Most people are excited about Classic because they havent played that version of the game in years, with you its the opposite.
---
This is incredible. I‚Äôd pay a hot dollar for a book of paintings depicting different scenes around Azeroth.
---
Not necessarily
---
This dude gets it!
---
?
---
They don't heal in bgs.
---
I won't be toting for a main healer role, I don't have that type of commitment. An off healer role possibly.
---
I think people need to just sit back and enjoy the game. Stop worrying about what's going to happen to the "end game" content. There is so much more to the game than raids.
---
I will be raiding casually and I couldn't care less how easy it is. I cleared half of AQ40 back in Vanilla, and even then, nothing was overly complicated.
---
Doesn't really matter how fast you hit 60 since you'll have like 4 months until BWL and ZG release and that's when i honestly think vanilla raiding actually gets fun.
---
Totally agree. Northshire and Elwynn are a dream man
---
Da stylish move, mon
---
Half a month :-) It likely has more to do with the fact that they can see how many people to expect 2 weeks later.
---
But a few bucks extra never hurt
---
Ew don't dungeon grind it is soo slow in vanilla.
---
No. I don't think any special accommodations of any kind should be made for streamers (or anyone else).
---
The game is the game and everyone from Blizzard employees to filthy casuals should be subject to the same conditions no matter what.
---
Also the 40 people dont need to be all from the same guild, the absolute hardcore players could coordinate to do it.
---
Without the cows please! Otherwise pretty neat
---
18-30 is done
---
30-49 is under construction \^\^
---
Hopefully well be able to test the AddOn on the global stress test properly :)
---
You can set up your entire UI (including addons) during the stress test and then just copy your WTF folder onto your character you make on the 12th/13th.
---
Any guesses on what will be tested or what max level will be?
---
Ofc, HoJ would be awesome to resist. Even though I would probably skip fighting paladins if I could hehe.  Thanks you.
---
Even then hunters needs bullets and lots and lots and lots of them.
---
From what I could find the name of the illustrator is **Phil Parks**, but I can't seem to find any info on him or more of his works. Anyone able to find more?
---
That's a nice meme. You can get 170 fire resist just from standard buffs btw.
---
&gt;so can‚Äôt be that much worse surely?  
---
HAHAyou're having a laugh mate.  
---
I get about that to Sydney on some days, and I'm in Brisbane, your ping will most likely be high, if you want an idea how bad make a starter edition and test it.
---
The fish on pirate servers are this big.
---
There's a deep and pervasive perception on the sub that things like 30/0/21 are going to be widely accepted, that you'll be able to do PvP and PvE all in one spec.  This just isn't the case except for a handful of exceptions.  It's not impossible to find a guild that will let you raid as 30/0/21, I did back in the day, but I also raided a bunch as tide before they let me switch.  
---
It's understandable though, there just isn't a lot of appreciation for how guild politics works or worked back in the day because people don't understand that even the most casual player on private servers is above average in terms of willingness to invest time improving their character and knowledge.  The number of shaman that actually raid enough to get geared is going to be tiny compared to all the interest in doing so.  
---
It was even like that back in the day.  The shaman forums were constantly inundated with people asking questions that lead with "switching to shaman" or "rolling a shaman alt".  They all wanted to know about getting geared and raiding while still being able to do pvp on off nights.  Virtually no one ever got that far.  My server was pretty small but we had a couple guilds eventually clear Naxx.  If you added up *all* the active and decently geared shaman you'd be lucky to have a list longer than 15 names.  There were easily 10 decent guilds active throughout, that's 1.5 shaman per guild.  And they *all* ran tide, at least for real progression.
---
Pretty busy for only an inn and a blacksmith shop
---
Or you can go with Option 1 (bind similar spells in different stances to same key) and then track cooldowns of hidden spells with addon such Weakauras. I would also throw some macros for stances switching to smooth it out further while keeping everything clean and compact ;)
---
Unfortunately the print version is way too dark, and even with lights on it looks like it's 90% black background  :(
---
I wouldn't call myself a hero ;)
---
yup, afraid of the ping as well. it's just that raiding is **the** reason I like wow, and I don't get off work until midnight, so finding a guild in my region is gonna be a bitch and a half.
---
Legit that is brilliant.
---
Would absolutely buy

I didn't realize those were social focused multi-player games

Some might...if you are charging them then eventually they will use someone else for free :)

Meant gear from leveling, BRD and such. But when sober, I guess you meant while leveling to 60.
---
 I'll be looking for these videos, enchanting and skinning was my plan. But was thinking of mining as well because everyone wants engineering.

Then doubled down on the post title
---
Awesome work.
---
Congratulations of missing my point by a mile.
---
People enjoy different things. A guild speedrunning MC doesnt affect you in any way whatsoever. Just join one of the non-speedrunning guilds.
---
Just create a new starter Americas &amp; Oceania account in battle.net account management... that's literally it.
---
Speak for yourself. I need everything pixel perfect and it takes me like 2h to setup my interface the way i want it
---
My thoughts exactly, don't just relive old memories but create new ones
---
Yeah but it just let's someone go stealth and reapply everything.
---
You mean **UNDERTUNED**, right?
---
Because, let's fucking face it man...the armor values dif between pservers and classic is NOTHING. Do you even know how armor works?
---
What is HIGHLY different : Parry chance, **14%** in Classic, 5.6% on private servers. Dodge **6.5%** in Classic, 5.6% on private.
---
Player crit chance on private around **30% HIGHER** than Classic.
---
I am sorry, buy higher armor on private servers where armor debuffs lower bosses armor into NEGATIVE vs Classic, where it cannot go under 25% of so, still means UNDERTUNED on private.
---
You people should really wake the fuck up.
---
**The bosses on private servers are HEAVILY UNDERTUNED.**
---
I agree. As a dwarf player pretty much 100% of the time I have been seeing more and more people choose to play the master race
---
I think you‚Äôre confusing 2s in arenas with duels. TBC warriors still get shit on by most classes in duels.
---
Add phase will be a joke in Classic.
---
The Graphics on the lowest setting are old but the engine is not.
---
That‚Äôs dope! Bloodfang rogue would be awesome
---
2h, then you are quick compared to me lol. Just figuring out how to write the macros I want is going to take a couple of hours probably( I have tons of macros from when I played on private servers but they are not going to work in classic). 
---
 Some addons are also very time consuming if you want to configure them to your liking. An addon like Luna unitframes takes forever for me to setup since there are endless options and I like to test many different configurations. 
---
 Other addons are a bit complicated and you might have to spend lots of time figuring out to set them up. Had some problems for example getting an actionbar addon to work correctly previously. 
---
 All in all not looking forward to setting everything up. Macros +addons is going to take hours for me until I am  done. Probably not doing it all at once though.
---
You're fun
---
DUDE I came in here to say the exact same thing! He even wrote it correctly, then erased and wrote it wrong.
---
Yeah man always buy Intel scrolls as melee it actually served a purpose it allowed you to learn to hit with your weapons believe it or not i think it got removed pre cata or during ulduar but it definitely existed.
---
Wind fury procs are not nearly as fun as you might expect only crit windfury procs are cool and those are mega rare. Most of the time you sit afk right click. Very slow very boring.
---
your ping will most likely be 200+
---
Get a healer and some melee with fishing poles. You should only need 10 or so skill with fishing to attach a proper lure and buy the pole with +10 fishing. That way you wont ever miss the mobs.
---
If you've played any time in the last 14 years though it will be similar just hit raiting will be a major point and expertise.
---
Stoneform removing blind is huge in duel. But shadowmeld being on a 10s cd is too good to pass on because you have feing death to drop combat. If you were any other class then yeah dwarf would be better.
---
I guess if you have a lot of times on your hands. That would make sense to play classic instead of an alt on retail.
---
Where is the infernal?
---
There's a smart guy who went by u/UbiGeofram on this sub, offering a lot of help and opinions to the users of this sub.
---
Unfortunately he's also a toxic POS who encourages cheating. Though I believe it was the references to sexual assault and nazism that did him in, in the end.
---
I noticed that all of his posts disappeared, yet on his profile the refrain of "Fuck u/iDylo" echoed Eternally.
---
But this was not the end of our fair hero, for he created a ban-avoiding account to post once more. 
---
Thus, u/GeoframThePriest was born. Once again he posted about how users aren't banned for cheating, once again he talked of assaulting fictional characters, once again he brought real-world tragedy into faction memes.
---
Now, now the profanity echoing about a reddit mod, echoes a duet.
---
(Shout out to our great mods, btw. Keeping the streets clean)
---
Highest IQ comment I've read in a while.
---
"Modern Players" AKA WoW veterans who played on pservers before.
---
Not *actual* modern players.
---
Sorry i'm too jaded to enjoy forced humour.
---
This name already is taken.
---
Wonderful so druids would be cleansing it all the time
---
Ahhh I seem to recall. You are my older cousin;)
---
I am 98% certain trees dont break los in Vanilla. Most likely done to minimize load on the server from computing collision detection all over the world.
---
Yea but we know what he's saying why be nitpicky?
---
The average casual guild today is way more skilled than any world class guild from 2005.
---
As I said, it's more to demonstrate that the gear exists for Ele PvP.
---
I agree about them being stuffed for PvE gear. No decent guild it letting a meme spec take needed clothie gear.
---
For some reason they tool away our few cozy places. And almost every chair. Apparently horde characters are not allowed to sit.
---
Can a pve build (swords, combat) be somewhat viable for pvp? I don‚Äôt want to keep respeccing
---
Is he actually this egotistic and conceited, or is it an act for his stream to boost numbers?
---
No? Why?
---
Bosses Parry 9% more often. Other than this, whats actually different? Everything also seem to deal a lot less damage so that makes fury DW tanking more valuable than private servers and threat shouldnt be an issue then.
---
I agree.
---
Dwarf paladin with Tier 2. Red dragonscale protector and Lok'Amir
---
Pserver have progressive itemization which means the gear people can get to clear MC was worse than what you can get in classic, items like Annihilator are not even in game at that point so there is no armour shred into negative. Then there are rules that you cant have world buffs for the first 4 IDs of content so the entire raid will play with 80 more fire resistance as they did on pserver which is a massive deal especially for the tank.
---
I dont know why you try to gatekeep so hard its fucking MC, its a joke, no matter what, its a glorified dungeon for 40 people.
---
All these comments and downvotes because people don't remember there's a mace called Taran Icebreaker: https://classicdb.ch/?item=2915.    
---
People always referred to it as tauren icebreaker though.
---
Maybe everyone was just trash in vanilla i think my first blue was feet of the lynx but i know i didn't get shoulders till like 30s even then the first ones were trash cloth
---
Does parry/dodge work from behind? Would this only apply to the tanks for the most part? Genuinely asking don't downvote my ignorance.
---
Are we sure that you can drop the armor values of bosses to 0 in Classic? Have Annihilator, Sunder, Expose Armor, etc... been tested to see if they stack?
---
Am i the only one who noticed the odd interface?
---
I think a lot of people are going to be quite surprised by the difference between pservers and Classics.
---
&gt;The Armor debuffs on pservers are lowering the Armor on a boss to 0.
---
&gt;Same for Classic.
---
I didn't know that, have any source? Sundars and some Annihilators lower *that* much?
---
I thought alliance just called every dungeon by the boss‚Äôs name..  ./2 ne hunter lfg Herod
---
Dodge works from behind for mobs. Parry only works from the front.
---
Yeah good question
---
We actually got to see him spawn because of that. Must more enjoyable for a viewer than watching the jump-spin-camera spin crap.
---
If you want to rush to 60 mining is awful since nodes are so out of the way, while herbs are everywhere, skining is good too.
---
There will be miners, but since this sub is filled by people that want to rush its not that popular.
---
Examples? Mechanics is something obvious in 99% of the cases (Onyxia threat being an exception). Were obvious in 2005 and are fairly easy to get right.
---
absolutely great

Holy Paladin, is so fun in pvp if you got friends to heal.
---
So your going to be an aes sedias warder? Don't remember exactly the term the dragon absolutely has to be a belf mage.
---
I PvPed to rank 10 as a 0/30/21 druid and my counters were warlocks and shadow priests. All other classes were a tie or a kill.
---
Eventually warlocks and shadow priests became easy kills, once I got my Naxx shadow resist gear. And fighting high ranked rogues/warriors didn‚Äôt become a tie until I got a 40 man tank set.
---
I suggest having rag throw Sulfuras at the ceiling, maybe sinking his lair  into the lava a bit more, reducing the area players can move without being burned.
---
As a adult with a job, I‚Äôll just wait for a Chinese farmer to sell 1k gold for 10 bucks. Saves a lot of time.
---
Just dump it now or right before name reservations, then turn the rest into blizzard balance and buy the game time later on.
---
Parry increase the boss damage thanks to parry haste and might lessen the treath of the tanks sins they will have more strikes not landing (might make it up in extra rage from extra damage but not likely). Dodges affect all the mele in the raid
---
Quite right, let's see how it plays out
---
It can be faster if the enviroment is right.

I need this

OP, would you take a commission? Rather than give it away, I have, you know, money. 
---
Happy to discuss further in PM‚Äôs
---
It is being added, along with a few other QoL features.  This comes from Classic being adapted from the 8.something client.
---
lol nice! I'm with ya.  I have always been partial to fantastical names myself.  Bigstacks isnt actually to bad!
---
Orcs are very good for their stun resist and both them and tauren look great in armor, I just wanted something completely new for me.
---
There is also the small matter of spell resistance that may or may not be the same/similar
---
Actually dungeoning gets you geared better than questing.

Repair bot my dude a raid must have like do you really want to walk all around that mountain inside with 40 damn people.
---
‚ÄúCome on. COME ON. COMEEONNN!!‚Äù
---
Oh gotcha, I dont remember that being much of a thing on my server. Was on an rp pvp server, and our guilds goal was to retake lordearon from the undead. So was doing lots of recruiting,, Training, and such.
---
Better than them seeing you coming a mile away.
---
I'm pretty ignorant to a majority of vanilla wows facts and strats. I leveled a nelf druid to 34 on a server, enjoyed it VERY much, and despite being constantly told that druids are trash, I'm excited to try to be the best of the worst. (Or class b rank 1, one punch ftw). 
---
That said I'm excited to learn, gaining proficiency, be that in a video game or irl,  is something that helps me with my mental health a lot. Feels good to get good. 45 days until I get to flollop around as a tauren,  see you all there ;)
---
They didn't stack in vanilla
---
Like a hobbit would. 
---
Unless you‚Äôre English.
---
Well, if you installed android on your dildo with fullhd display, I don't wanna know.
---
Hope you lighten up someday :)
---
I was considering playing a Paladin over Warrior this time round but I'm afraid I won't even get a chance at some good 1h/shields for 5 man's or a 2h for Ret PvP fun.
---
I don't mind healing in raids but my endgame goal would be running around in T2 with a kick ass Two Hander when I'm not raiding.
---
Which seems unlikely.
---
Good one bud!
---
Sitting is for the weak!!
---
Only the bottom table is from the combat log. The top table is from a database.
---
What classes synergizes better while leveling, Mage/Shaman or Mage/Warlock?
---
I want some thoughts and considerations on the topic of duo leveling, wpvp, and the occasional dungeon run with a mage (my friend) and me (either a shaman or a warlock) and what would work better together? From uptime, speed, gear overlap and valuable buffs/debuffs- there is a lot to consider and I can't seem to decide.
---
tyall
---
Cant wait for RP realms, many good stories lie ahead!
---
It also boosts levelling weapon skills
---
In full t2 and AQ gear
---

---
It is more than possible to raid with such a schedule.  There will be many, many, career professionals guilds that raid once or twice a week with attendance being fairly loose.  The only hurdle with that lower amount of play is leveling and preparing to raid.  After that, two hours a night is enough to farm and raid.
---
No, there was an actual maze portion, no areas to fall off there.
---
He's ragnaros dude. He isn't supposed to be hard for veterans.
---
I agree. We should be thanking RPers. They're some of the people who played table top games, learned to develop games, and gave us all the glorious games we have today. RP isn't my cup of tea, but I like seeing them around.
---

---
I believe they had ragnaros either target or use his magics on a warlock's Imp in Phase shift so they took no damage.
---
It‚Äôs gone!!
---
THE ELVEN BREAD!
---
HE TOOK IT, HE MUST HAVE!!!
---
I dunno. That‚Äôs probably why they‚Äôre secrets. But seems to be a lot of that mentality circling nuclear deterrence programs and such.
---
No surprise tbh. This applies to players from every country I encountered playing on EU servers. It's because the above average players put at least some effort in to get better and therefore know or accept that communication is important and then they are willing to speak english.
---
It really doesn't matter if someoe is from France, Russia, Germany, Italy or Spain. If you end up with good players then the communication may be a bit difficult or time consuming, but everyone tries.
---
The only exception are players from Northern europe. Even their garbage players are great to talk to.
---
While I'm not playing a warrior or tanking, I'd honestly be rather interested in seeing actual maths when it comes to how much the increased parry chance affects TPS due to attacks getting parried and how much more TPS you could put out considering the extra rage. Something really concrete. But I guess we'll see even more concretely when classic actually rolls out.
---
The best advice I can give is for people who don't want to play with streamers on their servers is to reserve streamer names before the streamers can.  That includes all variations of the name.  I highly support an orchestrated and surgical group effort to steal all streamer names and variations on all but RP-PVE servers.
---
Everything in this post is straight up false.
---
Almost zero and 0 is a massive dps difference. It does not take much armor to get 10% damage reduction.
---
Yes threat is certainly going to be interesting good thing im playing a rogue.
---
anyway the point was never that pservers are some sort of "hard mode" , it's just to show that classic raiding won't be much harder than pserver if harder at all. There's so many pserver haters that try to say raiding on pserver is easy and glorify raiding like it was some super difficult thing. Watch basically any youtuber nowadays and if there's some point where "this is different from pservers" they will try to find a way to say that "this will make classic harder"
---
If you look at time invested as a resource, then it's far from free.
---
The private server players will be surprised by how much easier Classic is for sure.
---
As far as pvp goes NE is arguably the best hunter race even taking horde into consideration. Feign death and shadowmeld lets you do some cool stuff. Every really good pserver pvp hunter ive seen goes NE. That being said if you arent trying to get rank 14 then just pick whats aesthetically pleasing. The gun spec on dwarf is pretty moot bc the none of the good lvl 60 weapons are guns. And everything else is negligible.
---
I mean the parry crit and dodge is correct. But yes all the talk about pserver is straight false.
---
Yeah private server bosses use their abilities way too often.
---
If they do manage to sell for that much right at the start, I doubt the higher price will be long lived. Going for 15s/60s seems like a reasonable price for things to settle to after a day or two. 
---
Ahh, market speculation.. how I have missed you Classic WoW.
---
I used to love when things without weapons would parry me.
---
Like parrying my sword with your head is the same as getting stabbed
---
I hope this is sarcasm üòÇ

On nostalrius I made friends with the Chinese mafia.  Basically they made sure I had anything I wanted because I showed a general interest in their culture and community. 
---
it's a two way street.
---
Not surprisingly, this is a draw (Which leaves me still undecided BTW).
---
If you look at the min max, best this or that lists that are everywhere, it's about 50/50 there as well. 
---
Do I detect a hint of balance between the races? Surely not!
---
Cant wait for a rogue to roll need on a cloth piece ‚Äúits an upgrade‚Äù

Thats what i call an addiction.

Its not about the fun anymore but rather the progress and the feeling of reward you try to get back.

My tip?
---
Just try to take your time and try to see the little things as the true content.

My gf is waaaaay better than me in handling money in game and at 40 she always ends up paying for both our mounts. I'm really bad at that part of the game :D I feel you

PvP server, nelf

PvE server, dwarf

It certainly does now.  Aside from a few massive flaws, Classic EQ is the best RPG MMO ever made.
---
wolf BLOCKS your attack (23)
---
That sexy Imperial plate armor. So wish it hadn‚Äôt been a mid-50‚Äôs set, but something to be wearing into 60‚Äôs dungeons and raids.
---
It was if you enabled the option to do so while Shift clicking. They're just removing the need to hold down Shift.
---
Lol 15 to 20 gold you realise training is like 300 right?
---
Yup, I can't believe people are forgetting that one of the "selling points" for WOW was that it would run on anything.
---
There were so many single digit framerate suckers playing WOW early on.
---
One of the really great things about Classic compared to retail is that you can play at your own pace. It doesn't matter if you play an hour a day after work or 5 hours on Saturday. There is no daily quests or heavy time gating. 
---
Others will be playing slowly too, probably most people, so you'll have people to play with. The idea that most people will rush to 60 in a week or two just isn't going to pan out.
---
I believe its a card artwork from the old wow tcg. One of the older packs too. I remember it being a quest card.
---
Catching up is no easy task in vanilla. No welfare epics. Ofc a guild can carry you for leftover epics but you are still bottom of the line ( months behind) for all meaningfull power items.
---
You're the one wasting everyones time by peddling bullshit like class hard counters. Skill is what matters the most, not your class.
---
this doesn't look right
---
Most of the BFA dungeons have bosses with more mechanics than most of the bosses in Naxx.
---
The game isn't hard.

Lucky me, on phone no ad

Sorry forgot to mention. On EU.

I remember seeing this interview back in the day.  So great :D
---
He‚Äôs a national treasure.
---
Wtf are you on about? Why are you telling this shit to me, I don't play PvP specs in a raid. Min maxing and pulling your weight are the same thing. Casual guilds won't care what spec you really run.
---
What is august 13?

'Fuck the alliance'

Moon cloth has a 7 day cooldown is on alliance territory and requires like 30 pieces for one bag.
---
comes down to the community you play with id say and the general metam Ive always found support the most inteeresting and also thr most surprising to other players eho go more glass cannon.
---
If you will put the effort into prepping gear for different loadout requirements then i think you haaave a  good chance at making it successful if you have a favourable community around you.
---
Played stress test and demo during Blizz on on arch Linux via lutris (installed battle net app in there and just installed wow from there). Not a single issue
---
Lol
---
Do you know when/where i Can install classic launcher then?
---
If they change the content at all it defeats the entire purpose of classic. The whole point of it is that it's a fixed slice of time that can't be taken away from you.
---
Loot acquisition is so slow and shitty in the original game even though it'll be easy it'll still take everyone ages to get all the gear they want.
---
You also dont have to kill any mobs until you reach the portal, right as you enter BrD you can run betwen the packs all the way to lord incendius and jump down
---
he's also got a horde tattoo on his arm which you can see here:

(pretty good concert as well if you're into this stuff)
---
One hell of a corpse run
---
Just mention human rights or Tiananmen massacre and they disappear on the spot. Chinese community in classic closed beta was super nice tho
---
&gt;..but you can apply this to vanilla just as easily. "you're forced to level 1-60 which anyone can do, even asmongolds mom, and run easy dungeons and raiding is just a choice.
---
But again, this is false and you know it yourself too. Statistically vast majority fail to make it to level 60 in vanilla WoW because it requires so much effort. The dungeons and raids are also harder than on the base difficulty of BfA, LFG and LFR.
---
&gt;Did you get kicked out of a BfA guild or something?
---
Why would I have ever played BfA in my life? I don't play kids games.
---
&gt;Imagine thinking that having to play well in PvP, instead of overgearing others, makes PvP easier.
---
It makes the game easier, learn English, 3rd worlder.
---
&gt;you're post history
---
*your
---
3rd world mutt incapable of even rudimentary English thinking he can win an argument, lmao.
---
So far you have not had a single valid argument, and I disproved every single thing you said, AND proved why vanilla is objectively a harder game.
---
Retail babies gonna rage no matter what I guess, it's just in your nature, after all you play a game designed for babies.
---
I see a mage that fights things level 30 and under at level 120.
---
I think it's fine, actually, because it makes pugging this stuff viable which makes being in a raiding guild a bit more optional which is just more flexibility for everyone.
---
I'll just hijack my own comment for this:
---
OP seems to be using a "write to external text file" functionality that's been added to combat logs at some point. Here's a description of the fields in modern WoW (missing resistances etc. because those no longer exist): https://wow.gamepedia.com/COMBAT_LOG_EVENT#Advanced_parameters
---
Going by this, here's my best guess at the actual fields:

By the time you reach level 60, chances are most of the raid bosses will be "figured out" and you going ta non-optimal route will not be the deciding factor of defeating a boss.
---
How does that get you a wand?
---
Ah, the enigmatic blade-parrying wolves.
---
Hope your friend was in the beta, I've seen most of those names in game already.
---
I‚Äôd roll dwarf for treasure hunting ($$ mount) and stone form
---
Plus, pet bear tank
---
So i cant work at almost any place what so ever, at all, in Sweden?
---
Hopefully they won't be weeks long and people falling into the sky or zepplins stopping.
---
Omar made it happen. But Classic wouldn't even be a concept without private server players.
---
And they are usually wrong about the weather. Just like pservers have been wrong about so so so much things
---
If you don't like healing / being support then don't bother paladin
---
FOR THE HORDE
---
What patch will be on?
---
Most fights need 2 tanks some need 5 or 8 that's the stressy part.
---
Yeah sorry man. I respect your opinion, but modern players are FAR better. I was a huge clicker as a kid, and I was actually very good at PvP. If I clicked now, I'd get my face ripped off. You need to be 100% on your game. Playing as a Hunter now is much more challenging than in Vanilla too. People are so much harder to kite, because they use their whole kit. I would play a Hunter like a moron back then and kite everyone to death.
---
Not only that, but the amount of knowledge available makes people better. Everyone is min maxed, best builds, best rotations, best stats, etc. I won't make an argument for mechanically skilled (although I do think people are still better in this area), but based on knowledge alone, players are *FAR* better.
---
Lol.
---
Nelf also has the highest base agility gain per level of all the different races so they will have the highest agility in same gear to all other hunter races.
---
It's still good advice. Can't let people walk on the rules
---
If you never experienced all of Mulgore, you're in for a treat. Don't rush to the barrens, friend. Enjoy.
---
This can't be pornshire? As I walked into the inn only to find that there was literally like 2000 people inside and 15 outside.
---
They're also abusing the world buff exploits, which increase raid dps by 50% and raid health by 30%.    That's a huge cheat that trivializes the game.
---
Also, I am fairly certain that the annihilator axe that they use doesn't work in classic.   It won't stack with the  other armor debuffs.
---
Because if rag has 1500 armour compared to 0 armour, he just dies a few seconds later. Not relevant because he's so damn easy.
---
You'll be waiting an eternity for prices like that.
---
so then play online against real people and learn actual strategy
---
what is that voice ?
---
It's a rumor lmao. There's always these rumors about top end guilds on every single server in every guild.
---
I have privacy badger and adblock plus but wowhead still causes issues no other website does.
---
negative resistance means the target is immune to that school of magic.
---
\&gt;  A DPS spec that mostly autoattacks and requires engineering/buff stacking pots/food to not be laughed at? 
---
Who said I won't laugh about rets even if they are pushing hard?
---
He has a character in Borean Tundra, Gorge the Corpsegrinder.
---
you don't need to go holy priest for leveling. you can heal all the dungeons up to lvl60 with a shadow spec. it would take a lot longer so there is no reason to level as a heal priest
---
Fun from different sources. Less emphasis on exploration, more on character progression and teamwork (helping your bros and brodettes in their character progression)
---
You can only reduce 3995 armor so shut the fuck up with this fake info spam lmao
---
there are situations you can skip ahead though like if a guild is desperate for another priest or warlock or something.   its possible to get carried through all the raids picking up gear the rest of the guild already have and dont need.  doesnt come in the form of welfare epics but this can happen, and zul gurub + aq 20 is a good catch up too
---
These sorts of shenanigans are exactly why I love wow. I think people need to step back and remember it‚Äôs a game tho. Calling someone ‚Äúa shitty person‚Äù for laming a duel? 
---
i mean, calling all alliance douche bags would be as ignorant as calling all horde douche bags.
---
    [H] Cerberus - Hardcore PvE Guild - PvP Server - US East (All welcome who can make raid times) 
---
While wanting to relive past  heroism's at a competitive level, the goal of the guild is to progress  at a pace that suits the core of the guild. With only two days in our  raid week, the core of the guild will be held to high expectations to  maximize the time we spend in raid. These two raid nights will have  minimal downtime and minimal tolerance for repeated poor performance and  coming to raid unprepared. Ideally, we seek to recruit the top 1% of  skilled players who no longer wish to commit to a 4+ night per week  raiding schedule.
---
Off nights are to be  spent farming consumes, gold, pre-raid BiS, 20 man‚Äôs, and, of course,  doing other things you love/need to do. The last thing we want is to  burn out our core and, with a more intense raiding schedule, farming  consumes, gold, and pre-raid BiS can be very volatile to the turn over  rate of players.
---
Maturity and respect is very important. Drama of any kind will not tolerated.
---
Leaders  of Cerberus have countless hours, accumulating to years, of leadership  experience throughout retail WoW and other games and MMO's.  
---
**Raid nights will be:**
---
    Tuesday and Wednesday evenings at 8:00PM - 11:00PM (EST)    
---
    
---
    Invites will begin 30 minutes prior to raid to ensure we start AT 8:00PM SHARP! 
---
**Loot System:**
---
    Loot Council 
---
**Our Goal:**
---
    To progress at a competitive level, on a casual schedule, in a hardcore and mature raiding environment. 
---
**Requirements:**
---
    18+ years of age (some exceptions apply for mature/outstanding players)    
---
    Minimum of 87.5% raid attendance (~8 raids a month - 1 missed raid per month AT MOST)    
---
    Showing up to raid on time and prepared for encounters being executed that day  (including proper add-ons, consumes, etc)

Depends what your goals are. We have got a casual adult guild, expect some people to level very slowly, yet everyone is looking forward to raids
---
Dudes out here down voting about bots i had a guild mate destroy a servers economy witch in turn led to extremity fast raid progression by a faction that was outnumbered 9 to 1, once gems and consumables sold for less than vendor everyone got geared fast.
---
 That would be rather difficult to do.    You would almost certainly need to simulate that to know the answer.   I certainly don't know enough of the values to even attempt it.
---
I Feel confident in saying you will generate a good deal less threat though.   Also, the DW tanking nonsense will be much harder to pull off.   That's doubly true if blizzard fixes the world buff exploit.    It still won't be impossible, but it should be hopefully be too risky to worth the effort.
---
You people? I think this man might be the only one who thinks this lmao
---
T3 ud mage
---
You should play on a pvp server then ;)
---
Oh, I know that, but the combat log parse still contains tons of stats that were not known to the client in vanilla. AP, armor, resistances and exact health had to be carefully reverse-engineered from large combat log parses because the actual values were never known by the client.
---
I didn't, but I suspect that Stunherald/Macespec along with being an orc who knows what to interrupt, reflect, when to disarm... and most importantly, what to save your trinket for helped quite a great deal.
---
Particularly the first two. I was one of two warriors that entire expansion who made my frost mage friend blow cold snap in a duel. 
---
I camped outside Orgrimmar a LOT. The two classes I lost consistently to were good frost mages and restokin druids. Everyone else was pretty much paper unless they knew how to juke reflects. Yes, SL/SL locks included.
---
Shitting on TBC warriors in reddit posts doesn't exactly change history does it?
---
&gt; Statistically vast majority fail to make it to level 60 in vanilla WoW because it requires so much effort
---
Effort? lol. It's just time. That's why asmongold's mom had like 40 days of played time. She hit 60 is among the lowest of the low in terms of proficiency. She probably can't even do *normal* raids. 
---
Imagine having to ignore 3/4 difficulty levels of BfA to make your case
---
Imagine being so unable to hold a civil discussion that your only retort is to yell at the other person to learn english 
---
Imagine having an argument so weak you have to strangely assume the other lives in a 3rd world country. lmao
---
I don't even play BfA, half your comments so far have been irrelevant
---
Because modern games have tricked you into thinking progress=fun
---
Thanks for clearing that up for me :)
---
I had a friend who made multiple paladins on the same account but on different servers, didn't max level any of them, and then wanted to "start fresh" so he paid for another account and made a paladin there... It made no fucking sense.
---
they do but just 1 so you have to be fast/lucky and at 8s there not cheap at low levels.
---
Night elfs do flips, dwarf got badass beards. Still a tie.
---
Still going nelf though.
---
someone else posted this on r/wow as well. they said it was from the TCG apparently
---
Yeah if you want to be a progression raider or try for r14
---
You can play for an hour a week and have fun for that hour. Boom, you just successfully played WoW
---
Yes!! This!
---
With all the reputation dailies, battlegrounds, and islands -- they're the same things over and over and over\* and then after I do them, I don't have much time - if any - to do other random fun stuff. I have little choice at all how to play anymore.
---
\*Yes, I know repetition is a part of the game, but anymore, it feels like so much.
---
We have no idea. We don't even know what Blizzard considers a "success" for Classic. It could be every single Classic player switching over to Retail within ~2 years.
---
I dont think there has been any official word on this. But it probably will happen if Classic is successful.
---
Well I was planning on doing this, I even subbed early for the stress test and ended up playing BfA for about 3 weeks now, got my mage from 110 to 120 and gave the Xpac a real shot. But man, it fucking sucks. It feels like I'm playing fake WoW. 
---
I want to play WoW, so i log in, realize I don't want to play BfA, so I log out. And my want to play WoW is never satisfied.
---
Nobody knows what's going to happen including Blizzard. It's too soon.
---
keep in mind on ur alt you have to mine silver nodes to level from 120-125 smelting wont lvl ur mining at this point. you could also make a mining helm +5 to mining or some enchant im pretty sure
---
Probably will be servers with both and the ability to transfer to new tbc if you want. I can‚Äôt see them forcing people to progress past classic... but then again it‚Äôs blizzard and they done it before lol
---
There are no resistances in this list, resistance 1 in your table is the mob level and the other fields at the end are related to if this SWING_DAMAGE_LANDED hit was blocked/parried etc:
---
https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Combat-log-format
---
Good point and I'm really at a x roads with how to play the game. I was originally going to make a hunter to farm gold then filter that down into my main for a smooth faster leveling process (holy pala). But now I'm wondering if I should just really go casual mode and level my 2 profs with fishing and cooking, while mixing in all alliance dungeons. I'm sure the 2nd way will have me making more in game friends to tag along with on the way.
---
I don't think loot ever *did* lag as much as it does in the beta. You can watch old videos (notably the Joana leveling videos) and looting seems a fair bit faster in them.
---
Log in? Make a character? 
---
It takes 2 minutes to customize the character, if your name is even remotely unique you'll be fine. Pick a different server if you're super into one specific name and it's taken.
---
Are you playing Classic?
---
Is it live?
---
Is it August 27th?
---
If the answer is no, well...how can you enjoy / not enjoy a game that you don't play?
---
Classic twink boe list
---
That's four words, and all you need to do is type it in google.
---
Well played
---
&gt; In fact, I think modern players are actually *less* skilled. 
---
yeah but these people wont be playing classic
---
They‚Äôve been layered.
---
Why no Carapace Spine Crossbow from Stratholme on the list? Its 3.3 speed is pretty nuts.
---
[Wowhead Link](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18738/carapace-spine-crossbow)
---
This link has it as the 12th best sustained DPS weapon available throughout classic.
---
[Link Here](https://forum.elysium-project.org/topic/31461-hunter-damage-cycles-breakdown-ej-repost/)
---
Perhaps you missed the part about health and armor values: He has really low health and armor values.
---
Members of the raid need to inflict an average of 25000 damage. That is a rather low amount.
---
Competent tanks who know how to stance dance negate the needs for fear ward.
---
Horde did the same content without it and even if tremor totem provided nearly the same effect it was never used because the tanks can avoid fear on their own.
---
On their own servers. Classic will always be there now.
---
He means without addons, which basically just keep a running probability of the mobs health through damage taken compared to percent of health remaining, there was no way to see a mobs health in vanilla.
---
You deserve to die in the opener if you fight a rogue without a pvp trinket on.
---
Thats not what it means at all. You used to be able to reduce resistances below 0 which meant your target had a chance to take additional damage beyond the full unresisted damage done.
---
Immunity would be the complete opposite of negative resistances.
---
With some luck the guilds will announce the drop in a popular channel such as /world
---
I just tried and found ton sir.  Omit the word BoE and you'll see a shit ton. I'm on mobile so can't link
---
No shit. I get the feeling that so many of the folks talking about speed leveling are going to get hit with the reality brick by level 20. Lol.
---
Flips &gt; Beards  
---
Also blue skin
---
My fear is that they are doing this to bring players back in and leave it. Once we finish naxx and start asking for tbc or FRESH or even new content, they will just say "you asked for vanilla, here is vanilla, if you want something else go play modern wow".
---
Gnome females united would like a word with you
---
Only one difficulty. 
---
The average trash pack in BFA has more mechanics than any boss in Classic.
---
Gnome Frost Mage is a great choice for a beginner.
---
Increasing your weapon skill reduces your chance to miss.
---
There will be boss mods in Classic and plenty of other raid addons.
---
Kinda. Boss mods existed in Vanilla but not everyone used them or paid attention to them.
---
Threat isnt really a problem for Ragnaros. Melee have to move in and out of melee range while a tank is always standing in range, generating threat. When the tank gets knock, the offtank runs in and Taunts, which transfers all the MT's threat over to the OT.
---
Blizzard hasn't said this at all. They could very well shut the entire project down after ~2 years.
---
Usually because you end up getting +hit or +weapon skill abilities a bit later with talents.  Also, apparently in *actual* classic, 1-10 mobs only have 1% avoidance (vs. Private servers where it was calculated normally at 15%+ between dodge, parry, miss, etc.).  I wanted to practice on a p server for classic and level 9 on my rogue was a nightmare.
---
"You think you do but you don't" next week someone shows pictures of a pserver with thousands of players and a thriving community on each server. Blizzard takes legal action and shuts down the largest server. 
---
Next year blizzcon is revealing classic wow.
---
why is that fugly human there ewww!
---
This is exactly what I miss about vanilla wow.  I didn't feel like I was missing out by not doing my dailies and just going off and having fun instead of trying to complete all my chores.
---
negative resistance is not the same as 0 armor. If your case was for negative armor then sure you can argue it since negative resistance was removed too. but yes assumptions are there, you pretty much have to assume some things if you want to make any sort of statement.
---
I still have allied races to unlock. I'll be spending most of my time in Classic, but still gotta hit the mission table.
---
I would agree. Transmog took a lot out of the game for me.
---
Well there is Vael, Supression Room and Chromaggus.
---
But when and if you factor in the fact how simple rotations are too classic raids are just so much simpler.
---
On a sidenote, is it really accurate to call it a rotation when you're spamming a single spell?
---
One difficulty, but some ways to change it up like the 3 bugs.
---
Mechanically simpler, but more out of raid prep. For example, resistance gear and the four horsemen tank abundance.
---
1 button rotation, good dps.
---
The more you use a weapon the less you whiff.
---
Yep.
---
Not really, your call.
---
hybrid items are basically uncontested and resto gear has to be distributed between the other 8-12 healers in the raid. 
---
i have played druid, paladin and shamans on private servers for a long time now and i always spent dkp for the hybrid stuff first. thats because i use that gear to have fun unlike the resto gear which i use to fulfill my role. the healing gear you get from dungeons will last you thorugh bwl and until then you shouldve gotten some items that noone wanted (t1/t2 items)
---
I'd love tbc classic without flying mounts and no change to the 1-60 leveling curve, If I remember correctly they adjusted it late tbc
---
You don't put many many millions into a project to shut it down. As long as 500K are playing it the servers will be there.
---
Awesome, do you have a link to that add-on or topic ? Thanks
---
Because you make items and disenchant. The poster above is talking about tailoring, and you did not complain about that, so I dont know why you cant make the connection that both professions are equally able to craft greens.
---
I was just suggesting leatherworking because skins are a lot more easily available than cloth.
---
Did so.
---
It is about the same level of mechanically difficulty as lfr , but of course one must remember the punishment for failing mechanics are higher which makes raids not nearly as easy as they are on LFR.
---
Just for those who don't see the difference.
---
Shutting down D2 saw a ton of people move to D3 where they made a lot more money. Shutting down Classic could see a ton of people move to 9.0 where they make a lot more money.
---
Kings honor, friend.
---
What made Vanilla difficult was that a 40 man raid had 10 people who had no clue what to do and another 10 people that had to watch the floor because their PC couldn't handle being in a raid, so you ended up with 20 people having to carry a 40 man raid.
---
They should release new content but keep the level cap and gear stats in check.  Like retune and release Kara, but make it drop T2 gear with cosmetic changes.  You could go to Kara to get new content and farm a black set of judgement gear.
---
This is when you panic click your minor health potion
---
It's not though. I played Mage for all of 2005, and then rerolled Warrior to join a new guild some of my friends were officers in which started up right before 1.9.
---
My mage's guild in 2005 indeed did spend months clearing MC. However once I rerolled Alliance and joined the guild where most players already had a years worth of experience in Vanilla, it took us no more than two resets to kill Rag.
---
People that think MC wont be easy in 2019 with the kind of access to information we have now, and the gaming experience of most players are delusional, or just desperate to hold on to their rose colored glasses of how hard vanilla was.
---
The game simply was never heard. It just turns out the game is more difficult playing on 800x600 resolution with 10 fps, 500 ms with no AddOns while everyone is wearing their Dungeon T0 sets. What a surprise.
---
Bloody brilliant that mate. I would take my family portrait down and proudly replace it with that.
---
Tanks don't need fear ward. 
---
Tremor wasn't used because it wasn't very reliable. 
---
Fear ward is very beneficial for alliance raiding, trying to argue that it's not the best racial ability in the game is just dumb.
---
There is. Guild wars still exists. It‚Äôs not like wow where it was updated so much that it is no longer the game that classic is.
---
That's probably true. I'm mostly excited that this time the "server" will be permanent and without corrupt GMs.
---
This post deserve more upvote than a meme

Wow dude you just blew my mind.
---
How many upvote that post got?
---
Someone sounds salty
---
Also, vanilla raids had strategic difficulty. Healers and dps had to manage mana. If you pull aggro on a boss, you will almost certainly die, and you will most likely get several other players killed. Lose enough dps/heals and the rest will run out of mana and tge tank will die and you will wipe... And there is nothing you can do to recover after too many mistakes. Even on "easy" bosses.
---
Sure, bosses didn't have terribly complicated mechanics, but the game is unforgiving. A single player (out of 40) can cause an unrecoverable situation.
---
...
---
I sorta did that with the priest on ND. I've never really played the priest before and I avoided the guides and tried finding stuff out myself. I ended up doing my own theorycrafting which helped me understand the class at a much deeper level than if I'd just watched a video on it.
---
I would have played on an RP server, but they are not making RP servers in classic.
---
&gt; Annihilator shouldn't stack. If it does, it's a bug.
---
Source?
---
Wowhead comments from 2006 say it DOES stack and it makes sense to me that it would considering the high cost in terms of materials.
---
&gt;As a personal note: It doesn't stack as much as you'd want. Once every Molten Giant or Wyrmgaurd would be a stretch.
---
&gt;**The proc does stack with sunder armor.**
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12798/annihilator#comments
---
I believe there will be a good number that don't get past level, but all the things that existed in this game that got people hooked in 2004 are still here.  I would guess a fair number of players who are just logging in to check out what the fuss is all about get hooked like all of us suckers who have been here since 2004.
---
wow you guys are already planning on working with other guilds to keep using that exploit.
---
We can always hope blizzard removes them in raids. They likely would have been if they where used like they are on private servers in vanilla. Alsow there might be some difference in how you get them take song flower for example let's say it doesn't give a group buff and has a 30 min cooldown getting it will be alot more coordination.
---
Oh definitely! I'm looking forwards to some real world PvP as it's not really something I've done before bar a few instances of running into a Horde guild in blackrock mountain.
---
They are making RP servers just not RP-PVP servers.
---
!RemindMe 50 days
---
they can still move their arm, which is the most important
---
So from my experience they've learned ways to dupe and cheat transferring characters from server to server, they go from official server to official bringing ungodly amounts of dinos and mats, they flatten everyone in sight if you arent chinese then leave and go to the next server. They do this and sell their tames and crafts irl and make money while ruining the game for all players present. 
---
If you want a better explanation I can do that I am falling asleep as I type
---
Sad thing is that I'd actually prefer some dailies like in TBC now. Well I say that but whenever I resub WoW I always get bored with it after a month haha.
---
No kodos, sadly
---
Druids makes one of each class
---
I dont care gor either when im on reddit. I appreciate the art on google images if im looking for a wallpaper. Otherwise i'll pass.
---
Tbh you can see the bosses are undertuned by looking at old nax dps numbers compared to pserver numbers.
---
A queue pushes people away and does not solve the issues of people leaving after a few months.
---
o look some more cringe from people trying to get attention from gms
---
Retail isn't fixable. The sub numbers are nosediving. It's why they decided to make Classic, and start anew.
---
Anything they do to Retail at this point won't work. Level squish would be a catastrophe. Further expansions without stripping players can only add minor content, or further add to creep, or be a content only expansion. WoW retail has run it's course.
---
That‚Äôs some serious hate towards alliance. I‚Äôve always played horse but I‚Äôm feeling an alliance character for classic. Although I won‚Äôt be playin no gnome either.. nah.. not for me. I‚Äôll be on that human rogue shit. Probably have a human warrior as well.
---
Keep in mind that most hunters spec into BM, where there is a talent that increases the speed bonus of cheetah. It would not throw off your calculations entirely, but it would probably tack on another 2 seconds or so to the ‚Äúcatch up time‚Äù
---
Definitely no.
---
Blizzard has implied they expect a lot of people to leave by or around the end of phase 1 so then.
---
Thank you for your time, I was just interested in the shenanigans they were up to.
---
&gt; a well known ‚Äúblizzlike‚Äù pserver
---
According to vaarsuv1us elsewhere in this thread: ‚Äúthat guide originated on a pserver where professions skill ups were x2 . So you make one widget and you gain 2 skill points.‚Äù If that‚Äôs the case, then your list, and the totals you came up with, are completely incorrect.
---
Awesome, thanks. Yeah definitely not ideal, but could still be handy in a pinch. I couldn't remember if they disappear entirely or show 0 after bought out. Didn't wanna waste time.
---
70% of players didn't make it past level 10 before quitting back in the day.
---
No
---
No I'm not. We already quit after Cataclysm. Retail offers zero appeal to us.
---
I spy The Hound looking for his chicken
---
Nothing at all, gonna level up alts and having a goooood time in CLASSIC, not a classic-ish or classic with newer stuff in it.
---
Great, so you'll be in the bucket they don't care about losing.
---
But they can totem twist WHILE adding nightfall up time, effectively adding DPS to melee and casters.
---
Lol blizzard is betting on a lot since they plan on removing layering. 
---
By November there will probably be 20% of the playerbase that start on August 26th left over.
---
The fact people are so upset at my request is astounding. 
---
It's not like I'm super butthurt about it. I return from a week of vacation, saw 3 days of wow gift, knew beta was at the end of it's lifecycle, and thought, "oh maybe blizz offering open beta for a few days for more realistic stress testing. Can't log in to beta. Okay moving on". 
---
You all make it sound like I'm crying and bitching because I can't get my way.
---
agreed
---
Thanks for the information. Even at x2 (which I‚Äôve never even heard of), you still couldn‚Äôt get 25 skill-ups with 10 Hi-Impact Mithril Slugs.
---
Lol the last question...
---
It's a 15 year old game...
---
2-4 weeks we‚Äôll probably see a drop in numbers... well ‚Äúsee‚Äù is a relative term... we won‚Äôt see anything. 
---
Essentially this is what layering is supposed to counter. Even with people leaving a server, the layers are supposed to prevent a server from having very few people. So hopefully we won‚Äôt truly feel any impact in game. 
---
Additionally, I don‚Äôt think they are going to release as many servers as they did in vanilla (I think there were ~230), so people leaving might be as impactful as servers should be pretty much topped off.
---
Also the lack of content at 60. Afaik bg won't be released until later on. The second big wave of people leaving will be a couple weeks after release. You need to like farming to enjoy the game.
---
I don't see that happening. Once Classic is finished it's only a hop, skip, and a jump away from TBC.
---
It'l be a why not moment.
---
I don‚Äôt expect the ranks to thin like people think they will. This is World of Warcrack not BfA dumpster fire.
---
Guess that it's okay, you can flag yourself for PVP on PVE servers, right?
---
TBC brought with it the ability to power level people extremely efficiently talking 35-40hours played for 1-70 with the possibility of faster with greater commitment, with the knowledge people have now it would be the go to leveling strat 1-2months in.
---
At least this guy is cool about it.
---
&gt;Is it a near certainty that Rogues will be extremely overpopulated?
---
No, it's not near certainty, it's not even very likely. 
---
You will maybe have trouble getting geared in dungeons at lvl 60, but other than that you shouldn't be worse off than many other classes.
---
Why not just have a restoration shaman? You will gain an extra competent DPS and only lose the agi on 4 people? 
---
The total DPS will be higher and if you have the OTs use nightfall then it will have plenty of uptime.
---
There will be less rogues this time &amp; more priests/warlocks/hunters mark my words
---
Rogue population hardly worth worrying about imooo
---
There will be far more than 4-5 miners per engineer. Some people simply don't care about PvP or the 1% of PvE minmax that Engineering gives to most classes. Many people will just run double gathering for the sole purposes of making a ton of money.
---
&gt; Dynamically creating and removing layers as needed is the most scalable, intelligent solution available. 
---
It also ruins the integrity of Vanilla and makes the game feel like shit.
---
RPers are the real legends tbf, giving no fucks having an absolute blast
---
Most will quit around lvl 30
---
They haven't said they will expand it after end-game, but they said it's not off the table. 
---
If they added tbc/wrath servers, I would hope it copies your vanilla character over or starts you at 60/70 with generic gear.
---
That'd be relevant, except you don't just gain skillups from mining nodes. You only need 50 Copper Ore to reach skill level 65 and start mining Tin.
---
Esfand is getting carried by his guild hard, and even then what he's putting up isn't that impressive in the grand scheme of things. Unless you plan on becoming a youtube star, I wouldn't look to him for the ret experience.
---
The paladin in vanilla isn't a poorly thought out class, it's a nerfed to shit class. Paladins were insanely OP early in development, the class was totally reworked right before launch with 0 testing and it shows.
---
What's left is....interesting. The holy spec is good, tough as nails healer with insane support. Prot is actually a great tank spec in 5mans, the problem is that your lack of taunt or direct fast threat builders means you need good group coordination, and most dps are pants-on-head retarded. Ret is also a great 5man class and strong in group pvp assuming the player pulls his head of his ass and leans more towards support than trying to do leet dps.
---
The problem really is the vanilla 40 man raid game, and how there's simply no place for hybrids in content which is made up mostly of single target endurance fights where you have a glut of specialists to fill extra roles as-needed.
---
As for leveling being boring, it is if your solo, but if you like grouping with other people, leveling as a paladin is tons of fun.
---
Personally I enjoy the class, not my favorite, but not bad. TBC's paladin was miles better.
---
first off fuck nochanges.  I never agreed to that stupid cult mantra, and blizzard hasn't either. 
---
exploits and bugs should be fixed.
---
Also, having blizzard perform a separate role is a change.
---
Definitely. We are using it directionally for our loot council. I wouldnt tie guild bank balance to DKP.
---
I updated my figures using a correct guide, you were still way off.
---
asking the real questions here
---
Add to it that not only EQ existed when they were making WoW, but also A LOT of other sandbox MMORPGs and Korean/Japanese MMORPGs: Ultima Online (wide professions and crafting system), Knight Online (faction system), Lineage II (Faction system and raids), Ragnarok Online (PvP Raids), Priston Tale (Hack'n'slash gameplay with diablo-like progression), and the list goes on.
---
What WoW did was take elements from a lot of MMORPGs from that time, and put them all together in a smoother way. Not really different from what they're doing in retail since MoP to be honest (rippin off world quests from GW2, and stuff like that), except that in Vanilla they did it very well in a way that felt like it was original.
---
A bit anecdotal, but all my friends are rolling rogues. I also think there will be a lot of rogues on classic. It really depends do you want to pve or pvp a lot of guilds will have 5-7 rogues in raids. But if you plan to pvp usually premades only want 1 rogue.
---
If that bothers you you could always play a druid. Feral has a niche place in raids and HotW ns druids are the best fc's in the game. Plus druids are the least represented class on p servers.
---
Of course. But unless I'm really overstating the general wow population, I think for the most part in 2019, people will be appropriately geared, enchanted, buffed, etc. It's not like how it used to be... there are detailed guides and such everywhere, and it's not like there's a significant difficulty in playing the game. You are ultimately right but point is I think the general populace will be a lot better these days.
---
damn
---
this shit is from TBC
---
I played wow BEFORE retail, closed and open beta.
---
I feel old
---
Or isn't acceptable. They better leave the Classic servers alone or there will be pitchforks.
---
This is likely to be true in the early levels, but unlikely in the later levels.
---
Ah that's what I figured. Thanks for providing the example.
---
A few have big ones have mentioned rolling on the same server, a handful for each faction. So that will be happening at least to some extent.
---
I always laughed when Shield Bash would get parried.
---
Everquest is the MMO with the best RPG elements, hands down.  City based factions, invisibility being coveted, masks of disguise, the loot, the world, the absolute danger and consequence of failure.  Dungeons could either be rewarding or result in a night where you lose two levels to catastrophic failure.  It is the better game.
---
However, WoW shares the game more than EQ ever did.  We like to joke about no-lifers and neckbeards on WoW, but when comparing no lifers in WoW to EQ one smokes their moms menthols and the other uses heroine.  The levels of poopsocking on EQ are fucking insane, and that single aspect ruins the game, no matter how amazing the RPG elements were.  
---
I don't think people on WoW could live with a world where Rag spawns once a week, non-instanced, and the first guild to kill him gets Rag loot and the rest get nothing.  The amount of skulduggery to train other guilds and steal a kill.  Just absolute nonsense.
---
But, EQ will always have the best RPG design, where the world feels relevant, and feels dangerous.
---
/r/classicplus
---
Yes. And on PVE servers you can have both factions.
---
Update: decided to just text him cause I actually couldn‚Äôt wait to find out, my buddy obviously has no idea though üòÇ I think part of me was hoping he‚Äôd say yes so I can try to recruit him to my guild
---
That's the right answer. This guy has played rogue.
---
My personal theory is that classic is just a distraction while wow2 is beeing designed.
---
[https://discord.gg/aAHcKDq](https://discord.gg/aAHcKDq) Classic twinking discord, can find the link also here on the subreddit wiki  r/classicwow
---
You can however have Mike, Miike, Myke, Mikee, but never two of the same name despite faction difference.
---
My personal guess will be Warriors&gt;Rogues&gt;Mage&gt;Hunter/Warlock&gt;Priest&gt;Paladin
---
Bro, I am fully aware. Spriest/boomkin/Ele/Paladin are a whole different ball game from Feral. Feral DPS has Powershifting which makes them actually solid, unlike the above 4 who will go oom or contribute actual garbage dps. Don't conflate the two, especially since it's apparent you have no knowledge on Druid at all.
---
You are making a strawman that because bad people might pick the class and do bad that we should just lie to them. How about we give them all the information and let them decide like adults?
---
You clearly know nothing, have a good weekend man.
---
Still not quite right. The RP server days of old are gone. Back then, you had to "stay in character" and not disrupt other players' RP. It was enforced by Blizzard in the Terms of Service. That hasn't been the case since 2012 and won't be the case in Classic. Today, anyone can do and say anything they want on an RP server without fear of punishment.
---
They actually had names set so it would just -servername at the end of your character name instead when they did merges.
---
ever heard of a vpn? most people in china on the net have one.
---
Most will be on the same server anyways, just pick another server.
---
I love how the pirated server trash gets upset when someone talks about getting rid of their world buff exploit crutch.  
---
You are scared shitless that they'll do the right thing and remove it aren't you?  
---
Which scares you more?  The fact that they might remove it, or that you might not be able to clear the content without it?
---
Not quite - there likely will be less hunters than before and not all that much more locks than before.
---
Flying was a huge focus of level 70 solo content.  If they release TBC Classic, it will have flying.
---
I think that the post-cata-BFA crowd will be most ready to pull the plug.  The lack of modern *conveniences*, that they have all become accustomed to, and the tedious game play (as some may see it) will more than likely see many of them packing it in before too long.
---
As long as the private servers exist they will always have an effect on the population of the Classic servers.  Why pay for for a game that they can get for free somewhere else?
---
Hopefully once layering is removed on the servers settle into some form of *'normal'* population we will have a better idea of how things are going.  The good thing is that even if the BFA players don't play on the Classic servers, their sub fees (along with ours), will keep the Classic servers paid for.  
---
Hopefully the Classic population will remain healthy enough to prevent large scale server mergers.  If and when that happens you just know people will pounce on that as a sign that Classic has failed.
---
It took a tiny team 2 years, Blizzard has canceled several projects they put the same effort into, so it's not like they can't just dumpster the project the second they think the profit isn't enough.
---
It ended with me learning hallucinating in public and a good friend taking me back to her student halls and making me sleep. Nothing sexual, just literally laid on a bed, and she chatted until I fell asleep.
---
I learned with her that I sleep really well with someone else in the room. She hated her halls, so she'd stay at mine a couple of times a week, was a plutonic but otherwise mutually beneficial relationship.
---
Snow White in this context would be cocaine though
---
You‚Äôll have over 200 ping playing on an oceanic server... really not worth it. Just play EU. People play at all times of the day and throughout the night, wow players don‚Äôt have normal sleeping habits. You‚Äôll find people to play with.
---
when playing 30/0/21 just dont tell anyone. some min/maxing idiots will bitch about it. just keep quiet and heal. there is plenty of ele gear in dungeons and raids from the beginning
---
A sacred 3 level of mess...that's like Hellgate london, or Battlecruiser 3000 level....definately over 9000.
---
The moss snake kicks you with the same legs he‚Äôs wearing the pants holding his silver pieces.
---
I played ark for a short time on basically an empty public server. Never met another player on my island. I was pretty casual but over time build a pretty amazing base on a river and got a lot of joy out of building and rebuilding while fighting off big Dino‚Äôs.
---
Then one day I log in and I‚Äôm getting 10 FPS while a giant Chinese army is ravaging my meager outpost, had already slaughtered the few Dino‚Äôs is tamed, and their numbers were just overwhelming.
---
They‚Äôre like the Zerg.
---
That's not how they do it.
---
That was when they introduced CRZ, not when they did server mergers.
---
I quote you:
---
&gt; I don't remember it being that long 
---
and that's why I think it was misleading as an answer to someone with limited time wondering how feasible it is. Now if you didn't mean that, then no problem it's just a misunderstanding.
---
Then you told me you raided 6 time a week and PvP 4 hours after that (and just to get a new mount mind you) if we put the consumable and gold farm on top of that, I think we can agree that you played hardcore and your vision of things is skewed isn't it?
---
My point is that normal player will have a very hard time reaching rank 11 (I know I had) because they won't have super uber gear to crush their opponent and win BG in 10min and if they can't play one week or two it will totally set back their objective so in my opinion it's not realistic especially in phase 2 and 3 where the competition on popular server will probably be super strong.
---
Like 70-80% attrition within the first 2 months.  90% within like 6 months.
---
When I raided on my mage back in vanilla, I always told myself If I could go back in time, I woulda rolled a druid, they always had an overabundance of dkp, and were the most geared raiders due to no competition for tier pieces. But, I'm not that smart and am rolling warrior this time around.
---
Paladins can tank tank just not as early as other tanks like warrior. And playing a paladin tank will require more effort, time, etc... to reach its maximum potential. Taunt is not a deal breaker for tanking.
---
Took me a while but i found the rogue.
---
its misleading. its far from a good route to 300, he has no clue.
---
I'm going mining+engi from day 1. Engi is GREAT while leveling. Goggle by level 10 or so. Trinkets before any other trinkets exist. Grenades! GRENADES! also green lens of shadow wrarh is pre-raid bis for lock (same with "of frozen wrath" or "of healung" as appropriate)
---
I'm not into watching streams, but I'd watch Corpsegrinder.
---
I'm going War. Going to dungeon crawl my ass off.
---
Epic mount sure, some people don't see the need to get one of those asap.
---
However wasting ur money before level 40 and then not being able to get a 60% mount as soon as you're able is definitely waste.
---
More like all people from your same class and level wear the same armor as you cause all comes from the same missions and dungeons.
---
That was obviously the context of this discussion, regardless of whether it applies to you personally. My point is if you want to contribute to the raid, you should at least have a decent PvE spec during progression. This is expected in most casual guilds and those that don't usually disband after the decent players either leave the guild or quit the game. Min maxing is more about having full consumables and world buffs.
---
Somethings. Its very fucky on uneven terrain. But mostly yes.
---
Missing shaman
---
Agreed on both points. People went from starting zone congestion to players quitting as if they are the same.
---
Ewwww alliance only bro.
---
He explained it allready. 
---
Is far from optimal but with these sheets I have the freedom to decide whats best for my own server economy/-situation.
---
Its very detailed
---
no noticeable delay.
---
What % of those were just alts?  90%?  
---
 I always have a shitload of alts that I make, and usually don't level.
---
Parry this you filthy casual
---
&gt;100%, 7 yards/second, normal run speed
---
&gt;14.3 mph / 23 kmh
---
So our characters are all Olympic athletes. Also, that means our horses run at 23mph/37kmh and 28mph/36kmh.
---
ah, i never payed attention to other peoples builds but I do plan to do this build

---
This build will make it so that i can both heal, farm, and pvp to a decent amount, the sacrifice to moonglow seems odd to me for that crit
---
The less gear, the more consumables required. Don't many of the recipes have rep requirements? It's been quite a while since I played last!
---
Zero. It's not 70% of characters never make it past level 10, it's 70% of *players* never make it past level 10.

Sorry it also doesn‚Äôt allow vpn

Sure. Just need to find others with the same schedule.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ccrb9c/-/) has been removed for Rule 7, because it was considered to be a low effort meme.

Sorry, I see what you're trying to compare here, but it's just a bit too unrelated to Classic/low-effort.

Spergs only care about being right; not about feeling.
---
Nah, he saw him coming and layered out
---
Well, it's simple if you know the math, true. But I thought it would be helpful to have a graph where you can quickly read it off. But I suppose you could argue that there are just too many special cases, so maybe the best thing would actually be some interactive tool, where you could enable/disable specific boosts. "If my mage, with speed enchant on boots and Nifty Stopwatch tries to outrun this hunter with Imp. Aspect of the Cheetah..." etc.
---
This should have been removed as being unrelated to Classic and better-suited for r/wowservers, but there's a lot of discussion going-on now, so it gets to stay.
---
Ya probably. I'm still very new at this. I'm a little low on cash and dont have the primer I want so I used lots of pant to mask some of the layer lines.
---
Difficult choice having to pick between a good browser with ads, or a sub par one without.
---
This is 100% my reason. I enjoy leveling in both, enjoy the quests, enjoy seeing new mobs/environments, etc.
---
You‚Äôre missing an important point for why WoW was so successful. It‚Äôs because the opposite of what you said. They did not make the most profitable game possible. In fact, they were worried it wouldn‚Äôt make any money. However, they made a game they thought they would enjoy in hopes other people would like it too. 
---
The WoW Diary goes over a lot of their fears and the risks they saw.
---
It's a specialty type of spec for high crit gear. It certainly doesn't make sense earlier on.
---
Your spec is a fairly typical Moonglow spec, from what I've seen, however:  
---
1. Subtlety is not super important, so perhaps move 1 pt of the 2 into Gift of Nature. This is admittedly a small nitpick.
---
2. Not sure what's going on with tier 1 in balance. If you're going to be casting Wrath, then drop Imp NG and put 4 points in there. If not, then max out Imp NG. Half-assing both seems not great.
---
Np. I shouldn't have been condescending. Thanks for elaborating :)
---
You're not wrong but the subject of discussion was how can an Enhancement shaman function in a raid. This is probably the best way one could.
---
&gt;What you do after that? 
---
Gear up, atunements, farm, raid. It's still not *a couple of weeks*.
---
I never quit wow. But I have more break time than play time since 2004. I expect I will take my classic break 2-3 months in.
---
Man, just +2 levels is scary as melee to start
---
&gt;Farm 
---
That's my whole point.
---
That could be useful yes, I dont have access to a computer for the next few days and am by no means a programmer or something but maybe I could create something in Matlab or Microsoft excel.
---
Horde Scum.
---
One month is pretty ambitious for the average player to hit 60 playing 3 hours a day, that‚Äôs like 4 days /played.  I think it‚Äôll take most people 7-10 days / played which is like 2-3 months.
---
And even when you hit 60 there's still a lot of content to do after you hit 60.  You'd probably want to farm your epic mount, level professions, and grind your pre-raid bis.  If you can play only 3 hours a day that means you can only do like 2-3 dungeons per day, so getting pre-raid bis might take awhile.  I'm sure once people start running out of things to do blizzard will release the next phase. 
---
Even if you do run out of stuff to do there's nothing wrong with raid logging and waiting for new content to come out.  People do it all the time in retail so why does it not work in classic?
---
It's still much closer to 100g than it is your 470g. And Thorium didn't even reach those prices on the beta where people couldn't get to most nodes safely.
---
Some brief story? Seems interesting.
---
yea your whole guild botted any your gm got banned LMAO
---
I think the tourist population is going to be less of an impact than people/blizzard assume it will be. I have a feeling that classic is going to attract a lot more subscribers that have never even bothered with bfa compared to the current bfa player base that might be interested in trying classic.
---
I don't think there were any gear catch up mechanisms involved,
---
I'd end up playing around with imp ng just to see what % i feel best with, on average something may hit me twice, so 65% would be all i need. That would end up playing.
---
As far as subtlety goes, I have no idea how threat is going to work in classic wow, so i dont know if i can ignore it, or put points in it
---
Maybe I woosh‚Äôd....Do mobs spawn per a quest here which you could get passive xp with? But also in Vietnam any passerby could rid your pet.
---
Look man, I'm on your side when it comes to no world buffs but fuuuuck. You sound like such a dick.
---
Cool off and present your reasoning better.
---
Cool. And cool friend
---
Oh no, a few players brought their virtual pitchforks, whatever will we do Mr. Kotick?
---
Well, we were going to let them transfer to a single Vanilla-only server before we push all servers to TBC Classic and then ignore them forever, but now I say fuck it, no more Vanilla at all.
---
Back in the wild west days of private servers, before getting as close to the original game as possible (blizzlike)  came into fashion (nostalrius and its competitors)   you had all kinds of boosted servers, some with rates as high as x10 or x15.  These were targeted at people who wanted to pvp as lvl 60s and not be bothered with arduous crafting and leveling.  (you also had servers that gave instant lvl 60 characters and many other variants.)  I don't remember which one had x2 rates, but I remember  guides especially made for that one.   And finally, people often just copy paste info from other guides, so the source of the guide discussed here could be that original x2 server, even if the server in question was not , somebody just copied wrong data without checking
---
The alliance was shitting all over us in STV. This was our cherry picked shining moment :D
---
..what
---
I think it'll balance out because you'll also be dealing with a fraction of the population of private servers. Less supplies but also less buyers. I think private servers had more tryhards than classic will have so probably a smaller percentage of engineers (still going to be a ton though).
---
Yeah sacrifice is just a health pool shield.
---
There are no "tricks" to do when you get opened ok by a rogue - you stated, before death coil? 
---
Fear.
---
If you can't get fear off, you probably lose.
---
Vanilla was a wonderful time :) before everyone had stuns and self heals.
---
I‚Äôve been trying to level a human warrior with herb/alc just to not have to care about hoarding anymore.
---
Rofl this guy's mad as fuck
---
Dwarf obviously
---
Check my other comment
---
I think more likely no TBC at all, but if it happens, I think all Classic servers will become TBC Classic servers, but long before the planned release, they release 1 realm per region with free one-way transfers that will stay Vanilla-only. And then they'll ignore those players forever.
---
Nice! Magic player here :)
---
This was the response
---
First off, spell batching. It's definitely not working the way I was hoping when I heard the idea pitched by Ohhgee before the launch of beta. The amount of artificial latency is definitely way too high, making plays that were oftentimes difficult to replicate, easier than ever before and giving the game a very unresponsive feeling. 
---
I'd recommend dropping this number down to 100ms to make it so that these plays are still possible, but require twitch reaction timing. As it stands, I'd venture to say my grandma (if she was still with us) would be able to get off a double poly while half asleep in her rocker watching a riveting episode of Dr Quinn: Medicine Woman. 
---
Next I think it'd be wise to remove spell batching off everything non combat related. Npc interactions, looting, etc have no positive impact on game play when artificial lag is introduced.
---
Leeway oh leeway where do I begin. Never in my wildest dreams did I think melee would become the new ranged. I've seen proof that taurens had extra melee range in TBC but I've yet to see anything that's proved this was the case in vanilla. 12 yards of melee range while both targets are moving is just... Baffling. Then also applying this to mobs is just insanity. The videos of mobs chasing down players and hitting them all the way from left field are horrifying as someone who wants to play a kiting class. 
---
I've heard countless players swearing off their mage dreams in exchange for rogue or warrior. With leeway increasing their ability to catch a kiting player, combined with a cone of cold that oftentimes doesn't hit their target especially when any sort of elevation differential. As well as blizzard where the damage and slow effects are on two separate batch calculations, targets can run through an already placed blizzard and not even be effected by the slow effect if they've any sort of speed enhancement (look at perplexity's test videos).
---
Read a post a while back about a blizzard dev posting anonymously about how much pull the content creators / streamers have had over to course of beta at blizzard hq. They were saying that there's a reason the major streamers are playing ret pally (lol), warrior and rogue and to fear the consequences of their influence. At first I shrugged it off and thought nothing of it. Now at the close of beta and seeing the state of the game, I'm starting to rethink that.
---
It's not too late to save this project, Blizzard. Ball is in your court.
---
There's not an ounce of hostility in that post, but you are just trolling, so w/e.
---
Ah, so that's an ultra nerd hordie.
---
I'm still slightly torn on playing Lock myself.. tough decision
---
People will still look vastly different due to random greens / blues.

Oh I did. Hopefully he gets convinced!

So yea 180k is for EU, Last xpac i played was wod half way through till i quit the game entirely

Ive been checking if i could redeem a wow token but No way i had that amount of gold back then :/
---
Kick and other CCs are not blocked by VW sac, that is working as intended. If you do sac your VW and use a healthstone and fully dot the rogue, you still stand a decent chance of winning or at least watching him die right after he kills you. If you manage to get a single fear off you should win easily unless it‚Äôs an undead rogue.
---
Without spell batching, people with lower latency have a huge advantage over with higher latency for any spell cast that isn't queued before the end of a GCD.
---
as will I,  lol what you consider content doesn‚Äôt concern me.
---
r/battlestations
---
You can look them up on sites like [wow.gamepedia.com](https://wow.gamepedia.com) and see the changes for each patch, gives you an idea of what was added and removed.
---
Except for skinning
---
*laughs in shadow priest*
---
Literally everyone used world buffs back then. I know we did, top guilds on the countdown podcast all talked about how they stacked them, blizzard isn‚Äôt going to remove them since they intentionally put them in.
---
&gt; News Flash: You didn't and don't need to own the latest expansion to play the game, nor did/do you need a subscription to reach level 10.
---
In 2010 like the article you linked is dated from?
---
[X] doubt
---
This is why I'm not rushing to 60. All the good memories happen while leveling
---
Only as a placeholder for Hunterfury, Blessed Blade of the Face Smorker of course.
---
They basically took everything that sucked in EQ and removed it.  Especially leveling.  In EQ certain classes literally couldn't level past a point without twink gear (very expensive) or being in a group.  You have 3.5 hours to play tonight.  Log on, spam "X LFG", no one responds, log off 3.5 hours later.  It was a cruel world.
---
how can someone be so bad at the internet that they cant find this? there are so many lists.... try searching this subreddit too.
---
The people who are going to unsubscribe either didn't play or played a long time ago.
---
He mentions one of the accounts, his 70 hunter, was his friends who quit playing so he just took it over.
---
And you could have specifically put this in the woe is me threads you talk about
---
But it's the internet, you aren't the only one.
---
If you roll a shaman plan on healing raids with near certainty. Some naive guilds might let you dps, but after not enough healers show up for your raid, again and again, the guild leaders will look at the abysmal dps shamans are bringing and make them switch to resto.
---
&gt;They are never going to force you to move to another expansion.
---
You don't know that Blizzard never said they wouldn't upgrade Classic.
---
I think you just dropped stink bombs in southshore on horde which would flag you. The alliance just had to get rid if them
---
&gt; Stop worrying about what everyone else is doing
---
The trial account back then was even better than the one today. You could even try out new expansions for 10 days: https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/10-day_Free_Trial
---
Better luck next time.
---
Hey atleast you alliance boys have some irl skills am I right? Hehe, loktar
---
agreed a little to much sun today, no bueno, update, [https://youtu.be/Ui7ME0glYGw](https://youtu.be/Ui7ME0glYGw)
---
Pretty sure Ony was 3 manned, then the 2.0 patch she was 2 manned by a hunter paladin duo
---
Why are you so worried about how other people are planning to play the game?
---
Right, you don't need Natural Shapeshifter with HotW. Just make sure to wear gear with intellect on it - 20% extra intellect when you're wearing 0 intellect is still 0.
---
This is the Restobear hybrid that I used for PvP, tanking, and healing raids on private servers: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxxRscMdxVxsofo
---
Only cat form talent that I take is Feline Swiftness (must have for chasing down Mages + faster movement speed while stealthed). This is not a damage build. It's a tank and utility build, so IMO it doesn't make sense to pick up cat form talents like Imp Shred. You're going to wear people down and outlast them. Not burst them down.
---
What class does this not apply to?
---
This is going to get removed by a moderator.
---
Makes zero sense that people who don't like the concept of wow would pay to play the game, and even less so that they would grind all the ways to level 60 just to quit.
---
But thay game sux
---
Even if they did, they would probably do it through server transfers, there is no way they would force people on classic servers to upgrade to TBC. I simply refuse to believe that.
---
you didn't get squelched or banned for shit like that back then
---
&gt;poopsocking
---
Absolute poetry.
---
How about you play your way and let everyone else play their way? You trying to influence people's decisions is just as bad as everyone else.
---
That too is not a logical argument.
---
Tis true, if you play alliance you probably are a homo.
---
His name *does* have explore in it.
---
I would imagine the level 20 poison quest would be enough to weed out some class tourists.
---
Then by level 30, be tired of spamming sinister strike and eviscerate. 
---
Its weird, as far as rotation is concerned I have more fun timing my auto attacks around my sinister strike/sword procs via swing timer on my  40 pserver  sword rogue then I do on my Outlaw rogue on retail.
---
Seems like every single class rotation on BFA is a priority system, and i fucking hate it. Let me look at the person im fighting not my fucking UI for a lit up button to press.
---
I find retail is good for playing specs that suck in classic though, like Ret paladin for example.
---
There are laws about playing with horses.
---
Lol really, what world do these people live in? Normal people wont even be able to get through the gates.
---
The question is really whether or not Expose Armor will prevent the **threat** from sunder from applying, or if it just prevents the debuff.
---
If it's the former, then expose wont be used in raids. If it's the latter, then possibly. Seems with the armor values of Classic you wont need Expose to get armor to 0. It's an advantage not having to get Recklessness on the boss though as that increase the damage the tank takes by quite a lot.
---
phase 2 pvp rankings without battlegrounds.  gonna be a damn bloodbath
---
You don't get to 60 just based on hype. At around level 35 it starts to get rough and 45 to 53 is the worst part of the leveling. If someone survives that and hits 60, I can't see them just quitting.
---
You're delusional if you think even half the Classic players on launch day will have played Vanilla at all. Only 67% people on this sub played Vanilla based on the massive survey in the sidebar.
---
I wouldn't say I'm "worried", but it seems like this sub has become unhealthy echo chamber, conflating what's possible with what's baseline to play the game. People think they are going to fall behind their peer group if they don't hit 60 in /4 days, clear MC in the first week, hit rank 17 and full clear Naxx. This sub is deluded.
---
Random note, i used to play magic the gathering with leeroy jenkins. dude was cool as fuck and has a super deep voice.
---
Well I have not a lot more to add: I was in this guy's situations back in the days and the grind to rank 10 (not even 11) was very long and hard and I have a terrible souvenir of it as near the end, it was a job and not a pleasure.
---
I find that your experience as someone who raided 6 night/week and added 4 hours of PvP on top of that (just to get a mount mind you) is quite irrelevant as you played with a totally different mind set and have a different relation to time.
---
(I mean do you remember the number of /played you had at the end of Vanilla?)
---
I'm so baffled by this post. You spend two paragraphs focused on how others are playing the game and end it off by telling others not to worry about what others are doing in the game. What the fuck?
---
Classic pvp disc also has as dedicated twink chan: [https://discord.gg/aGEJe77](https://discord.gg/aGEJe77)
---
I found it to be a way healthier place - and with much better knowledge - than the classic twinking one which was a good idea terribly executed.
---
I'm sure there many people that want to stay on 1.13.0 forever, personally I hope they release TBC and after TBC starts making new expansions maybe start with a remade version of wrath without all the mistakes they made in the original version.
---
I would prefer something like that to be a massive grind to be honest. Sounds neat (in CoH)
---
Hahahahha touƒáhe
---
Glad I could baffle you.
---
Judgement Paladin set with Lok'alir mace and Red Dragonscale Protector shield.
---
You have to keep in mind those servers are 10-15k *online*, so there is a **much** bigger player pool to form guilds, and be selective about picking and choosing higher end players. Assuming somewhat blizzlike populations, you won't have 30+ scarab lords, 15 guilds doing day 1 clears, etc on each server.
---
let's settle in the middle, so you guys can get on with your lives.
---
250g it is!

One of the first Ragnaros kills in Europe. People were just terrible at the game if we get right down to it. Most here are wearing their T0 dungeon sets which arent even close to being as good as having whats considered pre-raid bis these days.
---
If you're not into speedrunning, there's really no hardcore version of Classic.
---
Nowt. She's hawt!
---
I personally believe they are already planning to do TBC after. They set classic launch perfectly for it. Next year retail gets a new expansion, year after that we get tbc.. so new expansion every year, if you care about retail anyway.
---
I think an important part of competence is planning for things to go worse than expected.
---
Just do it when it comes out... doesnt take that long...
---
It's also the exact same number that is shown here:
---
 [http://www.kurai.com/wow/naxx/maexxna.jpg](http://www.kurai.com/wow/naxx/maexxna.jpg)
---
Imagine calling someone mentally disabled when you live inside a 15 year old game. Did i hurt your ego or something? Reality check: you're irrelevant.
---
&gt;The glory of week 1 Ragnaros is the crowning achievement for Classic. 
---
99% of the playerbase doesn't give a fuck about week 1 rag lol
---
Regardless of whether they release other expansion servers, they is simply no way they are going to obsolete the vanilla ones, especially since their main justification was to preserve history.
---
Doesn't stack with anything
---
how did you get a good weapon for ret pvp though?
---
???????????
---
The datamined, custom version of Ragnaros that they spawned in the middle of Orgrimmar had low health and armor values. Because they needed it to die to level 40 characters lmfao.
---
Definitely no. There's just no argument that multiple "blizzlike" servers had economies even 75% lower than Classic, let alone 25%. More likely is that SP didn't use enough data in his price estimates to accurately assess the economy of his realm.
---
there‚Äôs probably a good amount of people that are depressed and are looking at classic to be this throw back to a happier time in their lives and they just don‚Äôt want to mess it up. hoping the good times and memories come again, you know what i mean. 
---
then there‚Äôs people that don‚Äôt know classic and are worried it‚Äôs going to require a harder time investment than they think. my guess.
---
You dont. This guy's been spewing bullshit for months.
---
He's been stating bullshit for months.
---
The previous comments are correct. It's mechanically as difficult as LFR, but your class has less mechanics to use.
---
Where can I find information on base stat gains per level for various classes and races? I tried looking it up a while ago but could only find starting statistics.
---
So whats the problem, sounds like its easy to keep up in retail while playing classic.
---
So that just makes all ranks less of an achievement. Except 14 which can only be held by 1. What's this bfa attitude where you want pvp gear handouts?
---
The gear is a nice bonus, but you get rank 12-14 to show off. Gear and title is just a way to show you are the most dedicated pvp player on your faction, a literal high warlord who leads a team of the most hard-core alliance stompers on the server. It's not something everyone should have access too. Some things are in the game to honor the best, the most dedicated, and that's fine. Pvp is not a system for catchup gear in vanilla/classic.
---
Point was a weatherman is correct a lot more often than someone pulling post-it notes with random weather events written on them out of a hat.
---
I hope they move a new direction TBC was fun at the time but looking back it feels unsatisfying, mainly because of flying mounts and resilience. I loved in vanilla that you could get gear raiding that was actually worthwhile in PVP. I also liked bgs much more than i ever liked arenas.
---
phase 1 a joke, once layers are gone the real vanilla experience can begin
---
Maybe in 2004 when the internet didn‚Äôt really exist, but in 2019 1 YouTube video and a leveling build you will be surprised how easy this game is
---
&gt;Should I add the World Buffs AT ANY TIME on private servers, as opposite 6 hours CD in Classic?
---
The ONLY world buff that is known to have a cooldown at this time is Dragonslayer.
---
ZG buff and WCB might have (but there's no actual evidence they have), and DM-Buffs, Songflower, DMF, Silithyst, Zanza etc will 100% for sure not have a cooldown given how they are obtained.
---
I‚Äôm assuming he said he won‚Äôt be playing
---
Shadow Meld allows you to do DM tribute runs alone more easily too
---
Unless you plan on doing PVP then enchanting/tailoring is fine for a mage.
---
What is most important here is to decide if you want to be among the first skill 300  engineers  or if you are content to do it months later, when you are lvl 60. 
---
Prices for mats after 4 weeks will be quite different compared to  the prices after 4 months.   It will be cheaper at the start, but it will feel more expensive, because you won't have much gold yet.
---
It could also be dumb, I have just the one monitor right now and it cost me 1k usd, not something I should've bought but you gotta live a little
---
I do plan on doing pvp! 
---
I was originally thinking skinning + tailoring, and then drop skinning for engineering eventually.
---
They don't care if you want classic or retail. They want your money and a sub is a sub is a sub.
---
Sometimes its better to watch someone with unique personality and still some skillset rather than some wannabe experts in Classic Beta and failing to jump in WC constantly, yet still claiming themself as the best NA dueler warr. Hmmm
---
* People : I don't want any offspecs in my raid.
---
* Same people : RAID ARE GOING TO BE TO EASY. REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Sounds like you burnt yourself out playing private servers the past 6 years.  It might be time to find a new game to play.
---
So should you set up your keybinds and then make a copy of your WTF folder? I feel like the wtf folder for characters on the stress test would be deleted since the characters are being deleted
---
Dark Iron Bombs aren't used nearly as much as Sapper Charges. The Battle Chicken is also really great for melee groups.
---
Oh yeah. I'm not saying it's a bad thing. Makes the reward that much sweeter
---
One of my favorite movies is The 40 year old virgin. I think one of the most hilarious parts is where Seth Rogan and Paul Rudd play the "do you know how I know you're gay" game.
---
fth
---
Good point. 
---
No, Im an average Dad who will be just enjoying the game he played 12 years ago.
---
Private servers will go to shit, 90% of competitive/good players will leave for official servers.
---
There was the headless horesemen event in SM.  Maybe that was TBC?  There was the day of the dead, where you got the mariachi skeleton pet, that was only temporary, so fuck you Blizzard.  The whole grinch story line, the mini gnome slave presents.  The snowballs that would knock people down until they patched it to only be in AV:(  A stupid V day event.  The dumb fire one.  A lot of one's that really meant nothing.  
---
As far as I'm concerned only Christmas, Darkmoone, and Halloween were any fun.
---
Ah I see, good thing actually, everyone will be able to clear stuff they missed out on in vanilla. (Ofc a lot will still fail coordinating 40 people, but oh well)
---
Except a sub on Retail is only about half the revenue potential and even less when a new expansion comes out. Blizzard makes over half their revenue from microtransactions and the expansion sales alone from BFA have already made more money than Classic ever will.
---
EDIT:  Oh shit, they had the Halloween masks too!

There‚Äôs a video floating around on reddit where a dude dangerously close to a bear gets charged. He shotguns the bear pretty much point blank and then the thing runs away.
---
It's pretty obvious to me they are trying to diversity their offerings so that they are somewhat insulated from a bad content patch or expansion tanking their sub numbers.
---
Carry over from common complaints about Chinese students and Chinese tourists, rude, pushy, only care about their own and tons and tons cheating.
---
Yeah, fuck Blood Elves in the Horde.
---
&lt;low-key sounds of sadness&gt;
---
Mage over rogue
---
Pm them..
---
This isn't super comprehensive but I've been trying to keep track of addons, their current state, and people have been commenting/emailing me if they test an addon and it works
---

---
Then I would start with engineering and mining, you can always drop mining for tailoring later just make an alt to stockpile the cloth you find while leveling.
---
Wow was meant for the casual player so yes
---
That is true WoW fire, once he gets going over, like hypnotized by the topic. Back when representing your faction was a personal statement! Love the fire.
---
Probably going to herb/alc as well for classic, having swiftness potions and sprint all the time is too much fun.
---
Interesting, I'm a huge fan of Durotar personally
---
Yeah, the more I think about it, the more useful it seems to have something interactive where you could enable and disable that sort of stuff. Let's see what u/drife98 comes up with :)
---
Probably a cheese answer
---
but Classic is gonna be what you make it into
---
If you treat it like a game you just want to beat, then it wont be more than that
---
This comment right here Officer.
---
Except blink!
---
I don't accept your premise. Even if BFA only has ~1.5 million subscribers, those are worth twice as much as they were in previous expansions, which keep breaking sales records.
---
All that matters is the shareholder's bottom line and in that regard, Retail is far more valuable than Classic.
---
I recommend "Critical Role." It'll keep you in the fantasy mind set, it's a lot of D&amp;D fun, and the episodes are anywhere from 3/12 hours to 5 hours long. So plenty of farming time.
---
R14 can be held by more than 1 person at once.
---
It's not handouts. I simply wish pvp ranks to be more about skill and less about no lifing.
---
What are you plebs talkin about. fully enchanted/geared and a red mob still gonna bend you over.
---
Well said. And on this note. maybe your guild bank should be split up. Long term shit GM carries - like stuff your gonna save for a long time. And the short-term day-to-day stuff the CFO carries
---
What numbers?
---
This is subjective, but I can‚Äôt stand the NE animations. Their constant flailing and lanky arms just look so silly. They look like dumb clowns.
---
Can these be used while in bear/cat form?
---
The shield doesn't block kicks or anything. All it blocks is spell pushback by damage ( i think)
---
Wait, you think people are going to hit 60 in less than 100 hours played? nice joke
---
wow, I just played a M20 prerelease last night  (the store had some m20 boxes left over, so we could do it as a FNM event)
---
you make me curios about the makros now. Never really used makros in WoW. Mind sharing some of them and enlighten me what is the big advantage using them?
---
You forgot hunter cheetah talents
---
There's very few fights where it makes sense to spam bombs, sapper is used for big aoe pulls or the bosses with multiple adds which die off pretty fast when you use sapper.
---
the golden age of magic was 1993-1998 .  The silver age of magic was 1999-2005-ish....       
---
We are now in the 'lead age'  :(   So you haven't missed much and were there for the best times
---
Only 1 can earn it each week. But you, if you want skill then wait for the tbc servers in 5 years (maybe).
---
[These people](http://i.imgur.com/ezVsBzM.gif)
---
lol, death coil won't kill u
---
\*immolate* *tidal charm* *soulfire+shadowburn* *conflagrate*
---
And this is why streamers will be gank on sight if i somehow end up on a server with one.
---
Shadowmeld doesn't work in combat and dwarves have feign death. What advantage does shadowmeld provide?
---
&gt;Pre raid bis would look a lot different back then.
---
Not really. The prebis loot at that time would have been very similar to current prebis. Probably some slight changes due to talents being different, attackpower not being normalized and other such differences.
---
The main thing is that the current pre-bis lists for private servers has a LOT more total AP, Crit and Hit than what people used back then. It would mean a dramatic increase in DPS. The difficulty of dungeons were not really relevant since they had no cap on the number of players you could run them with.
---
&gt; Also note the complete lack of addons, minus dmg meter. 
---
Not related to the difficulty of the game itself.
---
&gt;Most guilds today likely use that Mind Control Fire Resist trick to down rag. What's that? Like a free 80 fire resist? 
---
83. And yeah its a lot more common these days but you still \*could\* have done it at the time if you wanted. What I am trying to say is that the game being harder back then was due to player knowledge being lacking, and not really due to the game itself like some people keel claiming :)

JTRHNBR
---
That is blatantly false. Look up how the system works.
---
Will there usually be only 1? Probably. But more can get it, if they're not on a low pop realm, and so 3 or more people get the highest tier cp reward.
---
I'm not put off by any discussion here or anywhere else. If the topic or tone doesn't interest me, I move on.
---
It's makes much more sense than inserting myself into the discussion and try to mold it to my liking.
---
Eh dailies are terrible because they become a literal chore, and then once you miss one or two you kind of let yourself off the hook and stop playing anyway.
---
I prefer the term "racial tabard," personally.
---
I can only speak for me, but I'm probably worse now than I was in 2005.  I was also 20 in 2005.
---
Is it really that good? I dropped it on like book 5, but I keep hearing I need to finish it.
---
&gt;In this case, yeah, it's fucking hard to enjoy it because, first, is not Classic, and secondly, pservers are irrelevant., because they aren't permanent.
---
Does it get anymore fanboy than this?
---
Yes it does...
---
Fo real. Just revealed names to the public? Good luck reserving them Aug 13th
---
One thing to note is that you can proc 2.9 sec windfury hits with sunder armor/revenge on your gcd. So the deathbringer axe orc tank can really run away with threat. Winfury is a bit deal. 1.3 sec dagger swings and 1.3 sec gcd makes the dagger attack and chance windfury every .65 sec, deathbringer 2.9 and 1.3 gives you an attack every 1 seconds to proc wf. So dagger guy gets 35% more procs but DB orc gets procs that are 220% bigger. Axe orc is alot better than people think
---
This is what made Starcraft so stressful for me that I had to stop playing and still struggle with extended stress. Its a great game, but the bar is set so high that I simply cannot play it any more.
---
Best Neck in Metal.
---
If you do it on the stress test, you won't have to copy anything since the stress test is using the "real" game in the \_classic_\ directory.
---
Oh very cool i didnt realize how good it is
---
This was taken during TBC tho.
---
I wasn't talking about pre-raid BiS, I was talking about BiS.
---
i like how he mentioned all these other things before he got to the real answer
---
It's the former. If expose is on the target you cant spend rage on sunder, it simply says theres a more powerful spell active. That being said it probably won't effect the guilds that use expose anyway
---
???
---
We are taking about hand of justice as it relates to pre-raid BiS items in phase 1. 
---
The delima is that that rogues and warriors are rolling on this Xbow while saying it's incorrect for hunters to roll on HoJ during this period.
---
I prefer making stupid amounts of gold off the twink community but thanks for the offer
---
They don't need an open beta to test the last 20 levels/raids, so they aren't using an open beta to test them.
---
depends on who you ask. My favorite books were several of  the first 5, so I guess not in your case
---
I recommend making a bank alt. That will give you enough bag space to just vendor the low lvl leathers.
---
Something in your post stuck out to me. Stating that hunters can take the same spec everywhere. I just believe this to be false, from my experience. My pvp spec is vastly different than my raid spec or solo spec.
---
Tell that to a warrior
---
I know they are testing them internally. I'm saying they obviously don't wanna test them on the beta because when kids full clear it in greens on day one, it's going to be a major hype-killer for the game for many.
---
I have a Dwarf Hunter on live and I loved her until the model update. Going NE Hunter for many of the reasons you listed and then some:
---
* Highest base agility, which shines at lower levels
---
* All of the racials are usable. Extra dodge, nature resist, and faster dungeon corpse runs all come in handy.
---
* SM is fun. SM + prowling cat = OP Aimed shot ganking, eye of the beats fuckery, eating/drinking while stealthed, point guarding made easy, hiding from pathing mobs and players, safer spawn camping
---
* Saber mount is the best Alliance mount
---
* Flipping when jumping
---
* Starts with a bow, bow sound &gt; annoying gun sound
---
* Starting zone will most likely be less populated and is lovely to boot
---
* Easy access to tons of pets for getting all the proper skills
---
* Easier access to Humar the Pridelord and Ghost Saber
---
Find Treasure is kind of useless on a Hunter, especially if you roll on a PvP server. I always keep track Humanoid up unless I'm hunting a specific mob. Having your pet be bigger or around the same size as you was always cool on my Dwarf, though.
---
I also had a really bad experience of people hardcore hitting on my Dwarf Huntress. Didn't get that on the NE, Tauren, Orc, BE, or Troll Huntresses but people were fucking thirsty for the Dwarf lady. One time it was so bad I logged off and didn't touch the Dwarf for a month.
---
Pretty obvious? Why?
---
Not everyone has been playing vanilla for the last 6 years..
---
The hunter can slow the chaser when they are not mounted.
---
So you know why they aren't, but you made a post asking why they aren't?
---
....
---
&gt;ez mode experience with the 1.12 talents + buffed itemization.
---
People wanted blizzlike and they wanted 1.12 talents, those two things does not make a hard raid and that's fine. 
---
Anyway beta testing is not required for small things like raids. in-house tester are more than qualified.
---
Yeah you‚Äôve never died fighting a mob because your extra WoW pro. Fuck off dude.
---
Thank you!
---
Where do you see a question mark in my declarative statements?
---
additive.
---
Yeah. Hell, I don't think it was vanilla. I played in wrath and I had no idea what I was doing. Hell, I used to think shoulders were a MINOR armor piece (by armor per slot, they are the 4th best: chest, legs, helmet, shoulders). I would routinely get to level 25 with leather shoulders as a warrior. It's pretty much the same, right? 
---
I have since, on private servers, picked up some stuff. 
---
I now have a great appreciation for what 20 strength will do for you, and have played enough to really notice when I am a level 22 player with a level 14 white set of bracers. (Clamshell Bracers, from Darkshore). 
---
I think that's why people are starting to do shit like post 25 minute deadmine clears at level 25. Hell, I have had deadmines groups where I was tanking, with no dps meters, and people have said "wow, that was fast. Under an hour".
---
People are expecting deadmines to take over an hour. And 5 level 20's in quest gear are clearing it in 25 minutes.
---
Because the vast majority of the games functionality is tested in the first 40 levels.
---
Except for some mechanics, it's all the same stuff with bigger numbers. They have those numbers from the reference client.
---
Ehh Classic raids won‚Äôt be nearly as challenging as on private servers.
---
Right. But it's not blizzlike... so yeah
---
Yeah and those mechanics are multiplied by 40 people doing them rather than 25.
---
Why would you think it'd be pserver/being cleared in greens? It could possibly seem easier because people have more knowledge on the mechanics etc
---
they are not necessarily more gold, at least not early game. At 51+ yes items are worth more disenchanted, but early levels usually not.
---
Both are a joke for the first few tiers because of 1.12 talents &amp; buffed itemization.
---
Unbreakable the shaman :)
---
Before the Orc refugees migrated here...
---
Time you enjoy wasting, isn't wasted.
---
Imo rather start tailoring(or preferably wait until 60 with 1 slot open), finish it and abandon than level something like mining+engineering then suddenly having to reroll tailor for gear and then back again.
---
Nope not a pro whatsoever. I‚Äôm just not retarded. 
---
I died when I rolled warrior.
---
With all the information out nowadays you really shouldn‚Äôt be struggling to get to 40 with 4 days plays even on a warrior
---
Where's your logical argument that there's a remote chance Blizzard will modify world buffs? DESTROY me with FACTS and LOGIC
---
I'm just gonna be enjoying the game at my own pace rather than trying for week 1 or world's first or anything
---
1.12 talents + itemization makes early content trivial/ez. 
---
There is no question here about it.
---
Oh you mean after you edited in 
---
&gt;Makes sense why they would only test it internally, since if it was tested publically and streamed
---
OMEGALUL
---
Gnomes in green hats
---
Alright. Thanks for the clarification. 3995 is the armor you can reduce in Classic then.
---
&gt; Do you own a legitimate copy of Windows 7, 8, or 8.1? Because if so, Windows 10 is a free upgrade for you. 
---
Whether you want it or not!
---
The original post had no question at all, it was a statement. I added for a different comment that thought I was saying it wasn't being tested PERIOD.
---
It happens with mobs who had multiple abilities.  It would attempt to use one that it thought was in-range, but it would stop fail the range check, then keep moving.
---
Phase 1:
---
* Warchief's Blessing - +300 hp, +10 mp5, and a 15% increase to melee attack speed (multiplicative) for 1 hour
---
* Songflower Serenade - +15 all stats, +5% all crit (additive) for 1 hour
---
* Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer - +10% spell crit (additive), +5% melee/ranged crit (additive), +140 attack power for 2 hours
---
Phase 2:
---
* Mol'dar's Moxie - +15% maximum HP (multiplicative) for 2 hours
---
* Slip'kik's Savvy - +3% spell crit (additive) for 2 hours
---
* Fengus' Ferocity - +200 attack power for 2 hours
---
Phase 3:
---
* Sayge's Dark Fortune of Damage - 10% total damage increase (multiplicative) for 2 hours
---
Phase 4:
---
* Spirit of Zandalar - increases movement speed by 10% (calculated *before* any temporary buffs like Sprint) and increases all stats by 15% (multiplicative) for 2 hours
---
Phase 5:
---
* Traces of Silithyst - +5% total damage (multiplicative) for 30 minutes
---
Phase 6:
---
* Lordaeron's Blessing - +5% total HP (multiplicative) for 30 minutes inside EPL, Strat, and Scholo
---
* Echoes of Lordaeron - +5% damage against Undead (multiplicative) for as long as your faction controls the towers.
---
I see. That answers that then.
---
Unless you plan on getting past the rush, it's going to be hard to effectively AoE farm.
---
Probably going to want to grind dungeons to avoid the competition.
---
Melee leeway is annoying on beta
---
That's a mentality thing on your part. You can fix it by reminding yourself that your free time is your to use as you please. If you consider everything you're doing is wasted if it's not towards a goal, then you're not going to enjoy it. Remind yourself that the gaming you do in your free time should be for enjoyment, not just checking off tasks.
---
I wasn't actually referring to the players I meant the mechanics of frost nova I heard some where it has like a pulse and can randomly break??
---
What makes you say it wont be blizzlike?
---
I played an enhancement shaman named Oprawindfury
---
To be honest early game can seem quite boring when you're just hitting boars with an axe occasionally hitting heroic strike, and that's if you even know how wow works, maybe a lot of these have never played an mmo, didn't take time reading quests and never understood basic mechanics
---
Ah yea.. Is there any news they are going to change that?
---
What path will you take this time around?
---
I like the challenge in a lot of areas, but it's annoying when you go somewhere for a specific purpose, and find out "oh, we don't do that here".
---
Like deadmines, I kinda like the entrance to sneeds room. kinda a wake up call. Like "oh, if you pull this wrong, even from range, you are fighting 4 elites with cleave, and if your casters stack up on you, that's a big deal". But silver stream mine is particularly annoying as it's..... kind of your entire game plan for getting a decent mail chest a lot of the time. If you avoided buying one as a human, and are over in loch modan at level 12 with a leather chest piece, or a grey mail one? you kinda notice when all of a sudden 4 geomancers are beating the shit out of you, and you remember it.
---
From what I've read its doable but with a few issues: frost nova has a max cap it can root, aoe leeway means sometimes mobs dont get slowed through blizzard and quite a bit of the favorite aoe spots have different mob Ai and new spells.
---
OwO what's this?
---
I watched the frost nova testing on twitch, I forgot which stream as I've been watching them all QQ. I think it was perplexity though.
---
When MC/BWL/Ony were the top tier raids, players NEVER had 1.12 talents &amp; super buffed items.
---
When MC/BWL/Ony were the top tier raids, players NEVER had 1.12 talents &amp; super buffed items. 
---
If it was blizzlike, we'd have NAXX available at launch.
---
Spirit I get, especially between mobs but is int actually worth it?
---
Also multiple bird type mobs have a quicker and longer lasting knockdown.
---
from all the people i've talked to, it's definitely possible it's just annoying and unfun to do with how shit the leeway is on mobs and how shit blizzard works.
---
Would you say it is better to start with mining + skinning to sell the leathers? And send mining stuff to an alt?
---
You had over 3 months to request the time off!
---
there's definitely no such thing as max cap on frost nova roots.
---
early leveling is surely easier but bosses being easier? IDK... well see
---
Rogue is a bottom tier leveling class.... Warrior is worst, rogue isn't THAT far behind. pretty much every other class in the game is faster for the leveling process, Including priest. it's not even close.
---
&gt;I am one of those individuals going for a week 1 clear, and I think I'll actually be done with the game immediately after that as I've been playing Vanilla in one shape or another for about 6 years now.
---
If I didn't know better from playing on private servers I would think this was parody.
---
Stoneform is one of the most powerful racials in the game, even in PvE.
---
Kind of but much lower level.. it‚Äôs often a place where most low levels 5-8 first learn there professions and class
---
I desperately hope so.
---
Mobs absolutely did NOT have a flat range increase when both player and mob were moving in vanilla. What they actually had with an attack buffer on their swing if you entered melee range and then left it. 
---
You could circle kite all day at close range and never be hit, but if you ducked inside their range, you'd take damage unless you instantly blinked.
---
You start with 5 higher, and can afk train weapon skills if you plan on killing reds.
---
And that‚Äôs how it should be
---
I felt the mild anxiety, this is a spicy meme
---
Ahh gotcha. I still think those advantages don't outweigh playing dwarf, the single greatest lifeform to grace the presence of wow
---
The Blizzard issue is is due to spell batching, and the possibly the slow aspect being applied incorrectly.
---
If I ended up dying I would go back and pop CD‚Äôs and I MADE sure it died
---
They probably don't want a server that caps at 700 concurrent
---
Wrong. Not even avail till p2 and you can easily get unluck and be stuck with it well into p3.
---
The principal is still exactly the same.
---
You're not addressing the argument. I said that A (increased demand from private servers) was necessary for Classic to be  approved for development. You are saying B (Omar coming up with a prototype) was necessary for Classic. Both are true, however, A caused B to occur. Talking about B does nothing to address A.
---
Guild bank and calender is something I would not mind at all. It doesn't really change how the game is played.
---
But to begin with, just start with classic as classic. When they have found a great sturcture to build around I would not mind smaller things added like that or some class balance changes to make more specs viable in PvE.
---
If there's one thing I've learned by rolling female characters it's that lonely dudes tend to think that I too am female. I'm a guy and don't like that sort of attention. Obviously, this is different for everybody, I just thought I'd share my experience.
---
More of a soft cap, Durning testing when too many mobs would be nova, a random amount of mobs would instantly break root right after but not all the time. This RNG made it annoying but still doable and the streamer couldn't nail down the the RNG but it was often enough to be annoying.
---
What is the point of this post?
---
GoReHaMMeR was the best guild to be a part of.
---
That we are getting ez mode / unblizzlike raids that will be LFR faceroll level ez. 
---
Classic will still be fun though.
---
K, so? That's hardly relevant
---
Blizz said Classic will stay up and running as long as Retail is.
---
Probably more like to plan the release better
---
Still doesnt change the fact that its still a blizzlike server.
---
Yes the 1.12 stuff came later and not during mc etc but people still ran mc and so on all the time. Would you be ok if blizz added the 1.12 changes later on?
---
I plan on doing something similar.
---
Combat medic, never a dull moment.
---
Even more of a reason to go NE. They‚Äôre feign death is over dramatic cause they‚Äôre acting.
---
Its not just blizzlike its blizz lol. You don't need the like part.
---
I‚Äôm on the same situation leaving the 24 of July and comeback 2 October, one month :D
---
cringe
---
What if you have a social life or don‚Äôt invest every minute of your day learning about 1 video game. What ‚Äúinformation‚Äù saves you from a mob getting a last second crit and killing you? Can to share with the rest of us, game master..
---
At release, the market is not going to be flooded with the mid-range mats, there would be an opportunity to make some gold.
---
I don't really care if Blizzard adds it, there will be already addons that do and you won't know the difference. The entire BFA interface is being ported over by player developers.
---
Hahaha, no they didn't.
---
Yeah you gotta be careful with the people on this sub,  some are great, informative, kind and patient but most are salty, just waiting to downvote and argue in super demeaning ways.  You can‚Äôt put forth enough evidence, because they don‚Äôt want that, they want to be shitty and berate others regardless facts while they reload the sub every 30 secs to shit on another good point.  Don‚Äôt worry bout em though, just scroll past and respond the decent peeps.
---
Time to find a new game then.
---
A friend just recently got fired after another friend in our group reported them for "verbal harassment". He was going to have 3 weeks off at the beginning of Sept. Now has to find a job instead. Guild drama already starting off stronk
---
As long as you're not causing any problems, what you do for fun shouldn't be judged by anyone.
---
It's NOT blizzlike though. That's factually incorrect. If it was, we'd have naxx available at launch. 
---
I don't think they should do rolling patch releases. It's too much work. 
---
Best solution would be to slightly buff / tweak all level 60 content up to the release of 1.12/buffed itemization content to account for the buffed itemization &amp; 1.12 talents. 
---
But stupid people will cry that it's not blizzlike... 
---
So what... what we are getting is no more blizzlike than that is. That would at least result in getting closer to an original blizzlike experience in a non-blizzlike way.
---
Don't forget the pumpkin bags that can randomly drop from higher level mobs!
---
i bet therell be a lot morr people creating characters at launch rather than reserving names
---
Hehe thanks...one day I'll try alliance...

Could use the 'default' for most lvl 60 in that list. Basic runspeed enchant on boots for +8%
---
Try immolate first. He might think it's fear. Once he uses kick then fear.
---
Yes.
---
3% off everything combined. Your base crit gets supressed by 3% and then your total +crit from gear, talents, spells, buffs, consumables, etc gets suppressed by 3%. So never more than 6% (2% per level the mob has above you).
---
get engineering! its like getting extra abilities! imagine getting 3 more talent points or something
---
A dial up connection can have better latency than a gigabit connection.
---
Yeah good idea, and I think I'll make the alt a class I've never really played like druid or rogue.
---
Once they're geared sure. The first month of Rag farm will 100% include add phase.
---
So salty.
---
Is it still US only?
---
So you knew a few characters of Mandarin and got a bunch of free shit from bots. Good for you.
---
This is why I played on hardcore servers. No transfers. That was some serious no lifting though.
---
Yeah, I just didn't feel like going through the trouble of explaining that. You're still going to want it. And I'm not sure the display bug will be in Classic, but we'll see!
---
I'm aware of when the leaf becomes available, I also doubt many people will be raiding for very long before phase 2 drops. Also nobody will be stuck with it well into P3 because its not even pre-raid BiS anymore in P3, the AV crossbow is.
---
thank god
---
Can confirm 1-10% being a thing for pservers too.
---
Entangling roots + shadowmeld + mount is the weiner way out but being extra slippery is a fun role to play. You can also down rank your DoT to keep rogues out of stealth. CC hunter pets. Warstomp choke points.
---
Thank you for correcting the error:)
---
It was still mostly part of the old world which I also consider wotlk to be.
---
Leveling 1-58 was mostly the same up until that point and was generally considered to be the bulk of the game as most people never maxed or experienced end game content.
---
Well its not about Engineering vs Crystal Charges. But Engineering plus Crystal Charges whenever you don't have a sapper timer rdy.
---
About the leeway, take a look at [this Vurtne pvp video](https://youtu.be/4sj21TAmQ-M?t=215), for example at 3:40 when the dw human warrior hits him, pretty long range

letting ppl stream raids kills hype massively. mc and bwl will be piss easy like theyve always been

so blizzlike? cool

Haha nice one
---
&gt; Edit: jeez, downvotes for this? Really? I thought people were exaggerating when they said this subreddit had turned into an classic wow pep fest/echochamber. Yikes!  
---
Lol nope. This sub has turned into a retail love affair. Sorry bud.
---
or a fucking twitter thread
---
Why would they open it to everyone just pay the damn month if you want to be a part of it.
---
Everything will be doable with pugs.
---
Cool, that seems pretty straightforward. Figured it would be easier with the new client to write macros. Guess it will be pretty quick to get the macros you need after launch.
---
 Curious, what do you mean with placing a reticle? I don't play retail so not up date. Also do you know if focus target macros will work in classic? Not blizzlike if they do but perhaps they are working?
---
They don't have the data for any previous patch. For you to say not blizzlike just does not make any sense. Blizzlike means that it is an official server run by Blizzard with their orginal data unlike a private server which is not blizzlike.
---
Leather doesn't sell for nearly as much as ore/stone. I would say just really stock up on more mining mats than you actually need, and sell the extra.
---
That‚Äôs enough
---
I think it happens even more now, but even 10 year old me had a few ps2 titles I never even tried and some I tried for like 30 minutes and hated it so I never tried again.. plenty of stories of friends doing the same.
---
u think a wolf can't parry your sword with his claws
---
turn the mob around so he flees away from more mobs, u gotta be smart while leveling warrior
---
I agree. I was just comparing the differences
---
All the "increases your whatever by x %" mean percentage points, not percentages. so if you have 8% crit and you gain an item that gives you 1% crit you have 9% crit.
---
Why would you downrank your dots vs a rogue? You want to take 6 minutes to kill them instead of 4?
---
Weapon skill also doesn't mean nearly as much with ranged weapons as you don't have glancing blows.
---
Rogue is actually not overpopulated. At least not if you're somewhat dedicated about raiding.
---
Wars will be plentiful, but also a lot of warrior slots in raids. Then again this means you gear up the slowest as a war.
---
Mages similarly plentiful. Warlocks may or may not be numerous on horde at least. Judging by census there's gonna be a ridic amount of SHAMANS. Avoid those and you're golden.
---
You will probably be vendoring most of your skins unless you are using them for leatherworking on an alt.
---
What makes a Dwarf better in PvE? I'll probably never use a gun except when leveling. Even then, it basically makes no difference.
---
On private servers people pug AQ40.
---
Johanna's guide, class leveling guide, BIS, spreadsheets for hit/defense etc...

I think Naxx was only cleared by 30 or 50 guild in Vanilla. On most/almost every servers Kel'Thuzad never died.

The nature of my job shafted me pretty early. I work in tourism so we had to subit summer vacation by the end of March. Since we didn't have a release date at that time I decided to gamble on July. I managed to get 15-26 off (2 weeks). Then not long after that we got with with August release...
---
But anyway, I wouldn't have been able to take off August even if I knew about it since it's the peak of high season.
---
Druid is free getaways....dont skip the water quest.  I cant tell you how many higher level ganks i survived because there was water nearby
---
I wouldnt be at all surprised if pservers were more difficult resist-wise. They were already overtuned in every other way, as people have begun to realize.
---
why would u use hamstring against a red mob, u need to use heroic strike only, if u really need to kill it pool your rage to 100 on another mob, heal up (bloodrage bandage) and dump all your rage onto the red mob with heroic strike, u cannot kill a red because of glancing blows on your white swings, so u can't afford to use rage on anything other than high damage yellow attacks (if you're level 36+ obviously use whirwind... mortalstrike etc instead of heroic).
---
So you are saying.. be a gay fish?
---
True, added
---
I don't care enough to make an argument about this so don't flame me for this. But ideally not since I enjoyed the need for guild websites etc in Vanilla.
---
Faerie fire is way more efficient than dots against a rogue.
---
That doesn‚Äôt necessarily make it true though unless they provide a source.
---
Mmm I can't wait to be invited to a gold selling webiste!

As a society we are better at playing video games plain and simple. How many professional gamers are there now compared to then? Oh gee wonder why

That's being a Ret Pally in classic ;)
---
This is why I expect people to get hooked. I expect that people quitting wont be nearly as high as they think. People get attached to their characters. Their character is an identity that matters in vanilla wow.
---
I have not read the WoW diary or heard or listened to any of the developer videos, perhaps I should.
---
I can see how WoW was trying to make the best game possible in Vanilla, their definition of "best" being a bit more inclusive than the EQ's definition.  Or said differently, EQ didn't know how hardcore or casual their game was (no reference point), so they made their game and it turned out being more hardcore than casual.  WoW had a reference point that they were able to work from.
---
WoW ended up being more inclusive and thus more profitable.  Then at some point the profitable part took over.
---
Good luck, enjoy it and take your time!
---
Hemo is a really good raid debuff if rogue is energy pooling and not spamming it.  16 slots makes room for it.
---

Warlocks make garr easy mode.
---
I‚Äôm aware that there are BIS lists for each class at each bracket, but what I was looking for was a combined list of high value items spanning all brackets. Should probably have been more specific in my post
---
I think they mean in the current game, since there are no missions in Classic. If you did to, I mean, people get rid of their greens and blues pretty fast at level cap, and even then, they normally all look the same.
---
I don't remember weapon skills being a big deal in vanilla.
---
Thank you, although I write it mostly as a way to preserve memories of the endeavours of four of us, I'm happy to know people enjoy it.
---
The early wand crafts are amazing. Apart from that, the few stat points you get on random leveling gear generally don‚Äôt make any difference at all. You can still DE anything as an enchanter. That means you can save up enchanting mats to level with later.
---
To answer the other part of your question: it‚Äôs not so much that you need rare recipes, it‚Äôs that you end up burning value for enchanting ranks. You end up either overwriting the same enchant for your gear, or give them away to noobs. Basically nobody pays for low level enchants, even on a new server.
---
Private server and Atlasloot is better. @ me
---
The week of August 19-26 is going to fucking *draaaag*.

Why exactly do you think how much you play effects your enjoyment of WoW? Do you have some weird mental hang up where you only enjoy something if you sink 40 hours into it a week?  
---
You must be the happiest employee in the office.
---
Oh well. I get where they are coming from. I wish things were a bit more relaxed in this regard. But rules are rules.
---
If anyone knows for sure of anything that was fixed not on this list, leave a comment and we might add it.
---
Don't forget Elune's Blessing from the Lunar Festival (10% stats increase, 60m duration).
---
I remember seeing a shaman by the name of Oprahwindfury.
---
On beta I'd be maxed about a bar maybe 2 in
---
Clearly not hardcore enough!
---
At the end of May you should have announced that an unexpected pregnancy had entered your life, that she was due in ~16 weeks, and that while you know federal law allows you up to 12 weeks of unpaid time off, you value your team at the office too much and only think you need a few weeks to prepare and get the baby settled in.
---
If you're married, you just say there were some complications that made you not want to announce until the doctors gave the all clear. Your wife can easily back you up with a few photos of a pillow under her shirt that you show off to the office.
---
If you're not married, you just say you're a man of principle and won't leave a child without a father just because birth control isn't 100% effective and she only recently reached out to you.
---
After hitting level 60, you quietly announce complications with the birth that led to a stillborn child on Facebook (name it after your in-game character) and then send your boss an email solemnly explaining that you can come back to work whenever. They'll probably give you even more time off to mourn.
---
And when you get back, not a single person will admonish you for being gone during a time when the company needed you most and they'll all be super fucking nice to you, probably resulting in less pressure/responsibilities and even a raise.
---
There is some confusion with the answers here, until you get to rugged/tough/hard?? leather you do not AH your leather, you vendor it. You will be skinning 10+ mobs per node you see, realistically 30-50 mobs per node.
---
Once you are around lvl 48 the beasts drop leathers that craft for more than their vendor price, so you can sell a stack of 20 for 1.2 or 1.25 gold to crafters, or craft them yourself when AFK.
---
If you farm mobs, and skin those mobs and vendor/sell their loot, you will make good cash at least pre-DM. When the server is fresh and gold travels further because inflation hasn't set in you can make tons this way.
---
I think it‚Äôs so they have a back up plan. When/If the population on layered servers are still at 6-10k a month after launch, they can open some rppvp servers, and people would leave the overpopulated ones.
---
Not like you won‚Äôt be invited through the mail anyway
---
Because a lot of stuff on pservers is broken. It was not like this in the beta.
---
The idea is sound.  Do activity x to obtain resource y.  Often you will see people spending twice the amount of time on x to obtain y directly, when they could spend half the time doing z, resulting in the same amount of y.
---
You just need to find what works based on prices.
---
What?
---
Not the original downvote, but when people complain about downvotes I tend to pile on.
---
Whatever dipshit.

---
Perhaps you might feel that way, but then we would atleast agree that small QoL changes are more impactful than we think.
---
I also think the game looks really, really good. The new zones are very pretty. But the game is so obviously crossing territory into the "mindless looter" genre along with warframe, diablo, destiny and so on. Which isn't bad in theory I guess, but it is horribly executed.
---
It‚Äôs not beta though. On the other hand, you get to be part of a ‚Äúfresh‚Äù experience, and maybe do a Deadmines run or something.
---
Great, good to know. I faintly remember shroud saying something similar in one of his streams.
---
Supply of the mid level mats will be low, but gold supply will be low too. It is not entirely infeasible to auction mid level mats,  but I imagine that people are underestimating how long it is going to take the market to pick up to create the income stream to offset the opportunity cost of a vendor friendly skill.
---
With that in mind, I believe it is fair to say that enchanting is likely going to slow you down rather than speed you up as an income generator early since most of the income is from other players. 
---
I'd love if you would share your insight.
---
You knew this already.... 15 year old game will be faceroll easy....
---
Honestly, leveling might be more tolerable then.
---
Probably because you didn't have to think about it that much because it was never so far behind to be noticable as levelling and capped quickly once you were 60. If you manage to keep it capped somehow while levelling though the difference is quite noticable.
---
Also if you switched weapons to something you'd not trained at all you definitely had to level it up to be at least near your level's cap before you started progressing again, unless you wanted to be low HP after every fight for ~20 minutes.
---
Do you have a link?
---
Nuclayer is right. The number of people who spread this "if you want to raid at all with Shaman you will be forced at gunpoint to respec to Resto" garbage is unreal. Plenty of guilds will just be happy to bring along someone who knows what they're doing and are contributing to the raid in some way. It won't matter unless you are in the top 0.1% of guilds.  
---
The average Redditor seems to live in a world where every single player is a min-maxing tryhard and because of that everyone just picks one out of six or so cookie cutter specs. Maybe it's the mentality of people who have been stuck in the private server bubble for so long? Not sure.
---
You'd only do this while being massively overleveled ofc
---
It‚Äôs not a waste of time if you enjoy it. If you enjoy dancing around and parkouring for 30 minutes, then it wasn‚Äôt a waste.
---
I am absolutely certain that we will see TBC and probably also WotLK servers. The model will probably be servers you can transfer your 60 to and others where you can‚Äôt but where you can start a new lvl 1 and level with the TBC xp nerf. 
---
It‚Äôs hard to say how long it‚Äôll take for TBC servers to pop, but my guess is 3-4 years. Hard to say, tho
---
Can someone e explain. Totem twisting g to me? I'm a shaman and I do t know this term..
---
I don't disagree, but that doesn't change the certainty that a TBC re-release will keep it.
---
But he says how much he hates Elves and Paladins on the Horde, so he's a Vanilla fan at heart.
---
It's all additive. Which is what makes world buffs so incredibly powerful when stacked.
---
thank you! i gave that a shot but i was hoping yhis might allow me to reach out to more of them haha
---
Horde is just green human, dead human, cow human and ugly human, plus their cities are made of sticks and tents and probably shit too
---
As a horde player I envy aliens for being able to do this. We don't really have anything equivalent to this as far as my IQ goes.
---

Haha, they are bit big/heavy for coasters. They are 10.5" x 1/4" steel plate, weighing over 5.5 lbs.

Have you ever driven into a boar at high speed ? Your car will look more damaged than the boar
---
got a bunch of dorks that wanna be Pat huh.
---
Considering that they're sitting on some steps made for human feet, those would be some massive coasters...
---
Exactly what this is.
---
&gt;The awesome part about vanilla is you don't need to be competent to succeed. You can very easily ding 60 by phase 4 and still catch up to all the no lifers in time for naxx (assuming they follow an authentic vanilla timeline)
---
Can confirm. I started out playing Horde in Vanilla, and rerolled Alliance right around patch 1.9 (AQ release).
---
Got 60, joined a guild and ended up doing 5/15 Naxxramas before TBC released.
---
most people won't be willing to buy and if they do it won't be for a lot
---
If we're lucky tbc won't be a real expansion but classic+. Wow classic design ideas mixed with bc content. Not very likely though
---
I think they will always exist
---
Agree, that's the only thing that's making me not to be too thrilled about WoW 2.
---
yeah this. I don't see how they think it's working the same, it's madness
---
You can do that and absolutely nobody can tell you which way save you more time and Which Way saves you more gold
---
I wish Blizzard would just confirm that this symbol is a Naaru the Draenor orcs saw in Oshu'gun already. It's really the only plausible theory I've heard.
---
just wait until TBC
---
I believe level 44 is the halfway point, xp wise.
---
Agreed. In Vanilla, the dailies are my own choices. If I need gold, I will run stratholme to get some orbs, or join a scholo and hope I win the flask recipe.
---
Dailies are the complete opposite. If I couldnt log in for a day it feels bad, because Im one day behind on my faction rep, and I missed out on 100g I would otherwise have had. It's not a good system.
---
Very well put good sir.
---
yup.
---
\*known fixes
---
We had warnings tho
---
&gt; jeez, downvotes for this? Really? 
---
The downvotes are for you making a bold assumption, and then starting it off with "pretty obvious that this is just a sham version of Vanilla". Then, they're gonna keep piling on when you make an edit saying, "wow, i got downvoted, so it's everybody else whos out of touch, not me".
---
Downvote bullshit aside, I think a bigger reason they didn't extend the beta to level 60 content is because they wanted to keep part of the game "mysterious". We all know it will be cleared week 1 in greens with level 58s in the group, by *some guild.* But keeping the content locked makes it more alluring in general. It's unwise to give streamers the full extent of the game. It's a stick with a carrot dangling in front of us, it's more content to *progress* to. 
---
Lastly, I'm kind of confused as to what you're bummed about. That they didn't release the raids in beta? Or that, if they did, they would be disappointing?
---
NE will be there least packed since more people roll human than NE and dwarves and gnomes share a starting area.
---
&gt;Pets as well as NPCs in combat will no longer ignore collision with objects/walls.
---
Did a ZF run the last day, and this doesn't seem very fixed..
---
I just did 9 flips in a row. Pserver though.
---
Pros -  you can min/max your gear by adding useful enchants on them. You can give free enchants to friends, guildies, and party members and they will like you more. 
---
Cons - Can't make significant money early on except for the wands, and also a likely money sink to level because you have to DE greens/blues that you would otherwise vendor/AH. Also, you won't keep up the leveling unless you run dungeons a lot. And even then, you'd have to go out of your way at some point (level 200 or so) to even find a trainer.
---
Personally I find discussions about how to play better a lot more interesting than posts that are complaining about people wanting to play the game in a certain way.
---
It's more like warrior, rogue=mage, paladin, hunter, priest, warlock, druid
---
From what I've seen so far...
---
People are only going to care about enchanting their end game gear, Pre-BiS and on.  As the economy grows some over time you should able to make gold farming lower level instances and selling mats on the AH as well.
---
Where's all the skeletons on the ground from the nonstop horde raids?
---
That's my plan, farm as many skins as I need to get my 40 mount and gather ore, then at 40 drop skinning and use the gathered ore to level engineering.
---
Seems fair!
---
&gt; small QoL changes are more impactful than we think.
---
If you are dumb as a rock then you might think that a simple guild bank will have a similar impact on gameplay as the dungeon finder tool. So ... you were saying?
---
This really does empathize what an incredible team we have working on our beloved game, happy to be part of this journey!
---
I would buy that
---
Down voted because alliance are bitches
---
I'm not trying to say enchanting is the best profession for gold making, gathering skills are better if you enjoy using them, enchanting is more a passive skill. Personally, I love running dungeons that just makes enchanting more useful than standard gathering skills.
---
I don't disagree... but AQ and Naxx, the actually difficult content, will be largely unchanged. It's really disingenuous to say that the game is easier as a whole, when only the easiest content is going to be easier. 
---
My ideal situation is to buff MC (10-15%?) and BWL (5-10%?) to compensate for the 1.12, but you have to realize that that decision is a huge can of worms. I think Blizzard is on the right side of things (in this case, anyways) with giving us the complete, most balanced version of the game, while not fucking with old numbers. Keep in mind, MOST people who did MC also did it when it was closer to 1.12 than 1.1, so it's more accurate to most peoples memories to relaunch with 1.12.
---
The best way to play resto in pvp is 5o heal your allies and basically be unkillable with bear, travel, stealth, and instant heals. Don't try to hard to kill other players (unless it's 1v1).
---
It‚Äôs almost always going to be a battle of attrition, which you should pretty much always win if played properly. If you‚Äôre not going to win, run away and stealth for a few. You can harass, dot, hot, and bear form melee your way to victory in most situations. Slow and steady.
---
Moot point*
---
Everything pre-AQ will actually be easier. I think a small tuning pass to adjust is the way to go.
---
I am the opposite and now I want to play with no time limits and the only goal is to enjoy the game and my time.
---
Wpvp implies the vast majority is 1v1s.
---
I am aware of how to get it done.. performance as a resto was and still is the question.
---
I'm bummed that we are getting a MUCH easier version of Ony/MC/BWL that we had back in the day when those were top-tier raids.
---
You just blew my mind.
---
True
---
That depends if playerbase would like the vanilla server to stay. If YES, transfering your char. should be possible without splitting servers for transfered and new players. If NO, just update servers with 2.0.1.  
---
Vanilla back then lasted for 2 years, so i think this time it will have simmilar or mbe shorter span.
---
If your argument is that you don't like how much time it takes, it's really not going to be as big a thing as most people make it out to be. Very few guilds are going go through the hoops of collecting more than one or two and almost all the ones that will are speedrunning guilds.
---
Some guildies will take the time to get the DM buffs before a raid. Most guilds will save the heads to get Ony/Nef/ZG buffs before the next raid. Very few guilds are going to bother with songflower, especially Alliance.
---
If your argument is that you don't like that some other guilds get them, well, I don't see why you should care.
---
Was the ground skeleton issue fixed? Where they disappeared top fast?
---
Where does it say that someone doesn't trust Blizzard here? Everyone knows how long it is until Classic releases and are very happy and excited about it.
---
Just because someone doesn't say it constantly doesn't mean that they don't believe it. So I suggest that you take you own advice and just relax instead of being annoyed over other people and what they think.
---
I never said classic raiding was hard. I said what we are getting is MUCH easier than it was for MC/BWL/Ony - which it is.
---
Where do you draw that conclusion from? As far as I can see, raids will be marginally tougher in Classic. Bosses have a higher parry chance, which means less TPS, and parry haste with some bosses. Some scripting will be a little bit tighter and less cheese-proof. Also, the Head buff has a 3 hour cooldown, and there will be less Black Lotuses to go around. 
---
All of that points to a harder raid experience in Classic, what makes you say that, out of curiosity?
---
Didn't realise it was 10.5" I figured they were like 4" haha either way still awesome man
---
Level 40 is 39% [if you level at the same ratio as Joana](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bfevz2/level_44_is_the_halfway_point/). So at that rate you would take 6 days to hit lvl 60.
---
I‚Äôm not complaining merely asking why
---
&gt;The leveling part is the best part of the game.
---
Let people decide what they think it's best.
---
I plan on raiding but I don't care how easy it is. That's like saying Mario Bros 3 is easy now because you know how to play it. Who cares? It's still fun.
---
Like I said, I also think that's ideal... *for me*... But you have to account for the fact that tons of people want their own version of the game, and Blizzard has to give us the version that is a healthy compromise, while still maintaining authenticity. 
---
I guess the biggest thing here is... we knew we were getting 1.12 for over a year now. It was a little bit of a disappointment, then, but I've gotten over it. Whether or not I clear MC won't be based on what our DPS is doing, or whether or not our mage has Mage Armor. It's not that it doesn't help, but thats not what makes or breaks a raid clearing MC. If your guild can do it, it will. If you can only kill Lucifron and Magmadar, you can only kill those bosses. An extra X% of DPS/survivability may have an impact, but it won't tip any scales.
---
Haha I killed him and one of the ooga boys just before shutdown. Probably the last two HKs of beta.
---
A lot of it just expectation management. If you expectations aren't for hunter to be a strong duelling class than yeah it doesn't make much difference at all.
---
I don't agree at all considering 16 debuff slots + having world buffs (now a days cuz we all know) + buffed itemization + buffed class talents makes things DRASTICALLY easier. There is no debating this.
---
I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs even horribly executed, I just think they were going down a different path for money. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a generational gamer thing but you don‚Äôt see very many true mmorpgs, or I just may be clueless. My opinion is that kids expect quick and easy gratification with everything even outside gaming. It has just leaked into gaming.
---
Me? I like the chill slower paced style, feels more immersive. APM is lower sure, feels better to me though.
---
Never said it wouldn't be fun still, just that it will be drastically easier than even how easy it was. 
---
I don't think that's a good thing.
---
5mans should always be doable. For raids you won't be as good as priests, but you're not really brought for your healing to raids anyway as much as for your totems.
---
If most casuals full clear MC early on, we are gonna get into a raid-log situation quickly, which is not good.
---
I'm a big fan of the high level dungeons (BRD, Stratholme, Dire Maul, etc.), of mass world PVP and the feeling of 40-man raids. My warlock accumulated 140 days played during Vanilla. Leveling was only a small percentage of it and, while I absolutely love the areas around Undercity and the process of leveling there, I can't say I have very fond memories of the process.
---
TBC and WotlK along with classic sounds far better than OSRS approach to me. I didn't sign to play Classic 2.0, i signed to play something as close to what it was as possible. Fresh servers every 3 years is enough.
---
If only the tier gear was actually good...unfortunately, for most specs, they'll only use a handful of pieces at best. But at least you can equip the full set and stand around in cities and look like a badass.
---
Great...now my neigbors think i watch porn on speakers
---
These would make incredible garden decoration
---
I always wanted elementals to take extra damage to opposite spells like Pok√©mon does now
---
BLAZING ELEMENTAL RESISTS FROST SHOCK LULWUT

* Scrolling combat text size and ‚Äústickiness‚Äù now properly matches classic damage numbers.

I am now convinced to resub for classic

A bit late to answer but we have been working on a tool for this for a few months now and it's not reached a "soft" launch in case anyone else is looking:

Oh my dear God
---
Lol this comment made my day. DON'T YOU KNOW I'M LOCO
---
&gt; (now a days cuz we all know)  
---
I'm disregarding this part, because Blizzard should never adjust the game based on the playerbase's knowledge of the game. Nintendo shouldn't make Ocarina harder for *everyone* because the hardcore fans know every corner of it.
---
The numbers are drastically improved. But the numbers aren't normally what make or break a raid night. As most people will tell you, the hardest part about MC is getting 40 chickens herded into the coop. Again, I don't disagree that buffing HP/damage to compensate is what *I would want,* but thats a huge can of worms for Blizzard to open, and I respect that they didn't.
---
Hahaha good one. Here's what you'll actually be wearing.
---

---
People don't argue that Vanilla raiding is hard. Sure, it was "harder" back in the day, but, unless you raiding AQ40/Naxx it was still "easy".
---
I would also send the leather to an alt until the market picks up. You're basically throwing money away if you sell anything on the auction early in the life of a server.
---
Dont wolves attack with their face
---
Very well worded! I don‚Äôt think it can be fixed. That‚Äôs why I I can‚Äôt enjoy playing new video games. I‚Äôm so focused on trying to be the most efficient and complete the game that I don‚Äôt take time to ‚Äúsmell the roses‚Äù.
---
People just use discord. Wtf uses guild websites anymore?  Tf.....
---
Which is why I am dropping skinning after my first mount and getting enchanting after. Save most of my sales for phase 2 anyways
---
It just needs a good backstory lol
---
Brd, Strat are level 50 instance. Dire maul is only release on phase 2. Same with 40 man raids.
---
You just proving my point again. Level 60 content won't be available at release.
---
Its pretty common to have herb + engineering because herbalism is a lot more profitable than mining
---
Then go look for it? It should be the same Q&amp;A where they say no RP-PvP servers at launch.
---
Wow.
---
&gt;HOW DID IT END I NEED TO KNOW?!
---
You gotta convince him to play and find out what server he plays on, and post it here!
---
It‚Äôs like Butters from south park trying to role play a paladin.
---
I think 30 is a good cap. Allows players who want to continue to level the ability to do so, you only get a few days or so.
---
Not a stun, but Imp. Shield Bash talent gives Warriors a Silence that isn't listed.
---
&gt;at times at times *at times* **at times**
---
Oooh, I remember that calendar. Didn't it show the PvP weekends too?
---
risky
---
Stoped reading at private server, good luck on classic
---
Do you really think anyone's going through this thread thinking "Oh yeah, that's genius! Now I'm gonna make 6 alts and name all of my characters after Snow White characters!"?
---
He's probably not gonna reserve them anyways, since you can only reserve three names per account and so you'd need three accounts to reserve all these.
---
You can main heal any 5-man in the game as an enhancement shaman provided you have a caster set. Speccing resto just makes it easier.
---
While we don‚Äôt have confirmation, I don‚Äôt see Blizzard using pre-1.4 loot tables for any Phase 1 raid boss. That would mean Majordomo gives no loot and that the entire T2 set should drop from MC.
---
No one knows. Personally I'm hoping for classic+ rather than tbc
---
There's no way it's going to be 30 lol, it's a stress test and it's only a day long.
---
What type of decks did he play?
---
World dragons!
---
I have the full purple version on my DK. c:
---
We have confirmation that items are gated behind their availability. They will have 1.12.1 state items. This means Onyxia's Head should not drop until Phase 2. If you mean we don't have a official list outside of Titanic Leggings then yea. You're right.  
---
This means no loot from Majordomo and only T2 Legs and T2 Helm available in Phase 1.
---
Let's be honest here, getting one character to 60 is a pretty big ordeal. Nevermind gearing it up if you're interested in that. Now imagine doing it eight times. I don't see this guy doing that, even if he thinks he's going to.
---
I hate pallies and they are boring AF to level and I still want to do it just for that set
---
Well classic wow is coming out shortly, smartass
---
Not saying you were going to play it
---
A once in a lifetime event calls for a once in a lifetime excuse.
---
Damn, that is sooooo many fixes.
---
No problem! Feel free to let me know if you have any feedback or see any errors.
---
No Mindtap Talisman (11 MP5 trinket, can wear 2) until Dire Maul, which makes MP5 harder to come by upon launch than pservers.
---
Try to avoid chain heal in 5 mans.  You usually don't have enough people low on health to make it worth it.  Sometimes you do, sure...but not usually.
---
Find a good place to farm cheap mana potions.  My favorite spot are the 5packs of imps in Burning Steppes.  They are not super camped usually.  They drop Superior Mana Pots, Major Healing Potions, Runecloth, Elemental Fire and items of course.
---
I will be in bed rest from surgery, planned it well i suppose.
---
Because they need more data, the last stress test was not as much as they expected
---
A bit late to answer but we have been working on a tool for this for a  few months now and it's now reached a "soft" launch in case anyone else is looking:
---
&gt;The console command that allows you to increase the range of nameplates has been disabled.
---
FFS - wait so we get new api graphics all that shit but we are going to make casters be on top of mobs before we can see their names.
---
Do you know if there‚Äôs a website to find players physically near you? Would be cool to find local players.
---
&gt;	Whatever dipshit.
---
If you are getting so worked up over something you desperately want to be true in a video game, perhaps you should take a step back and find a better balance in life.
---
Both the relevant private seevers have irrefutable evidence that those armor values are correct. And this one corresponds with the numbers down to the integer. You are setting yourself up for disappointment.
---
Mainly though, please revisit the subreddit rules. You would not talk to me like that if you were sitting next to me.
---
He had amassed 3 weeks of vacation?
---
yeah a warrior in full greens and no fire resistance will have zero problems tanking rag
---
Go Tailoring+Enchanting, it's the time proven classic. Skinning just slows you down without providing any benefit except for a tiny bit of money (which isn't really worth the time spent until you start skinning the 40+ leather). Tailoring helps you use all the cloth which as a mage you don't usually use to bandage yourself to craft and then DE stuff which can be used to craft wands early (not that crucial for a mage, but it can help) and some minor enchants. Bags are really nice to have in classic. But at some point your crafts are going to start lagging behind - at that point you should stop leveling them until you hit 60.
---
People play alts without ever thinking about getting them to 60. Some never make it past 5. The joke is lost unless he reserves all 8. $30 is nothing.
---
Yeah, current WoW definitely is focusing too much on Profit. It's ironic, too, considering how much less money the game is making nowadays. That's not to say they're not still making a ton, but ~3 million players vs. ~12 million is obviously a marginal amount less money. Turns out when the developer focuses on the game and not the money, the money comes from the people because they like the game! Who would have thought, right? haha

---
This is not classic wow content nor relates to it. Get this wow out of here mods.

That's a private server thing, on retail mobs were coded to flee directly towards any nearby ally of theirs (if there was one close enough to reach before their "flee" duration runs out).

Even still, he should have at least a 3 month buffer in savings on top of whatever he gets in severance/PTO. Plus, he should have already applied for unemployment.

Interesting theory, I never thought of that. It kinda looks like [Gift/Touch of the Naaru turned upside down](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/491016-gift-of-the-naaru-orc-disguise.jpg).

I was actually planning on selling the leather to the vendors
---
I don't remember the exact deck because this was like 11 years ago, but it was some sort of red deck focused around spells I think. I actually beat him in a quick match before FNM but I didn't even know it was him at the time. I didn't realize until a couple years after I stopped going to that card shop and saw him on stage in a video at blizz con haha.
---
The people who ask that kind of question are looking for others to tell them where the fun is because they are afraid they won't find the fun on their own. And they are usually right.
---
You‚Äôre arguing that they‚Äôre going to gate Onyxia‚Äôs Head to Phase 2 rather than have it in at launch because it will cause power creep in the Phase 2 content, which consists of Dire Maul and 2 World Bosses, none of which needs Rally to be trivial.
---
Trial accounts are free.
---
only the first and third thing you listed were correct :s
---
You won't be able to tell that until you are there and you see which profession earns more gold to pay for your repairs.

Been playing on a PS for several weeks and had this exact same feeling when fighting the enraged  panther in 1K Needles. I was kiting solo as a Hunter, all going well until I saw I was getting respawns. The panther was low, my pet dead and I went aspect of the monkey.  I died even after popping a health potion but it was really close. If the panther had not parried he would have died. 
---
My son was shouting at me to run away but I tried to explain to him the situation.  He just couldn't understand why I had to stand my ground.
---
Read on their website that at least one server will close down since they don't feel like playing huge server fees when blizzard start hosting classic.
---
That‚Äôs not how an argument works. You don‚Äôt claim to have a source that contradicts common sense and then say ‚Äúgo look for it‚Äù when challenged.
---
Do you have a reference for this? The blue post specifically stated that they wouldn't go into detail on how additional crit against +3 mobs is affected.
---
The secret sauce for warrior leveling is definitely alchemy and herb. It helps sooo much to have those buffs going, makes leveling really easy.
---
&gt;This isn't a gameplay chance
---
it is a gameplay change. it makes hiding behind terrain impossible in pvp.  it also allows for all the associated ui elements possible with nameplates (such as dot tickers and cooldown displays etc) visible from across the map which is absolutely ridiculous.
---
Read it again. He said all auras receive a total of 3% crit reduction.
---
At least on mobile that css sure gives off a vanilla feel
---
Goodness you're a triggered little ninny, arn't you? Go ahead and show us the video. Or explain how you cleared Rag, please.
---
Engineering and Mining to start with (assuming you don't have a mining alt). Once you do, you can swap it out for BS or Alchemy assuming you have ways of supplying resources to those.
---
Cya in 58 days darling
---
We're not quite sure at how much it is suppressed actually. We know that it adds every aura (crit through gear, talents, buffs) and then diminishes it by X%, with X unknown. I am not sure if they had time to do enough testing to check the X (it could by a bit variable.) in the example we had, a 5/5 cruelty in berserker stance warrior (+8%) only had +5% from the aura I think. So quite a big number already, and the gap will not be 6%.
---
Legit amazed I haven't got a storm of downvotes or nasty replies.  I normally don't troll but I couldn't help it.  Forgive me :)
---
I've recently relearned how to relax and just enjoy the ride.
---
I've been rerolling obsessively on private servers trying to find out what class/race I want to play in classic, I've made about 9 different warriors, and I've played through every starting zone, some of them more than 3 times. Somehow I've not gotten bored of it.
---
I'm probably going to end up rolling a warrior, despite playing it to death the past few months. It just seems like it's become easier to enjoy things in the moment, rather than worry about effectiveness or efficiency. Maybe my mass of characters that I end up deleting has caused me to lose a feeling of attachment to them and now I more so just feel attached to the game world at large.
---
/blogpost
---
Like you said, Engineering is a no-brainer. There really isn't another profession that locks the perks of it behind said profession. You can pick up a gathering profession as a source of gold. Mining and Skinning are good at the beginning, but drop off pretty hard once people outgear content. Herbalism will always be lucrative since demand for Alchemy mats will stay strong throughout the life of the game.
---
Yes, the Classic game being made by Blizzard to be as factually accurate to Vanilla at 1.12 as possible, is not blizzlike.
---
This is a terrible post. Also why do you care what other people are doing and how fast?
---
it's not an argument, it's an opinion.
---
BEWARE enchanting while leveling - I do not recommend it.  It is the most expensive tradeskill while leveling.  Much of your gold is made selling items and if you are enchanter you DE many of those instead of sell them.  This represents a big opportunity cost that people sometimes forget about that.  On top of that, you cannot sell your mats or finished product very well while leveling.  Dust and Essence doesn't vendor and no one is buying low level enchants - you change your gear too quickly.  A leatherworker can make 20 items and then vendor the to recoup expenses.  No such luck with enchanting.
---
It is good for making wands, which would do well on a new server.  But then on a new server no one has any money yet.  It is a great money maker at max level once you get some good recipes though.
---
Tailoring and enchanting are such a good match, but when I level like that the enchanting always sucks away all my gold.
---
As a gnome mage you will probably want tailoring at some point for the Bloodvine Set (ZG patch).
---
Yes and it counts as testing the game and providing useful feedback to the devs much like the beta.
---
Yes, the cap will be 6%, as confirmed by Blizzard. 1% per level for your base crit chance and 1% per level for your total aura crit chance.
---
Discuss throw one to my door please.
---
Scrub
---
Grenades and intimidation are both classified as a controlled stun. They DR with each other and all other controlled stuns. Cheap shot, kidney shot, charge and intercept stun, pounce to mention a few.
---
Rocket helmet is classified as a disorient and DRs with whelp armor, sleep, blind, scatter shot, repentance and freezing trap to give you a few examples.
---
AFAIK CC is divided into the following types in classic:
---
* Controlled root
---
* Controlled stun
---
* Disorient
---
* Silence  
---
* Fear
---
* Disarm  
---
* Random root  
---
* Random stun  
---
A few types were added in later such as horror, ring of frost, deep freeze and eventually, hunter scatter was assigned its own type.
---
How on earth is it blizzlike in any way? 
---
Stop with the emotional arguments maybe?
---
They are left over from another project, the outside edges were water-jet. I was considering plasma cutting the edges by hand to match the aesthetic.
---
Hmm yeah this is a good way to look at it.
---
I think I will go skinning + mining. Eventually drop skinning for engineering, and eventually drop mining for tailoring to end with tailor/engi. But leveling I'll do gathering profs to earn gold.
---
One I'm a higher level mage I can AoE farm and use that gold to buy up engi/tailor!
---
Probably 20, just as a bit of a sweetener to get people excited. They badly over estimated turn out for the last one and people are definitely experiencing some beta fatigue from 2 months of testing so I don't think it'll be just lvl 15 again because they won't get enough players to really make use of the test.

Except we know that's not how people play. Tryhardism, unlike economics, actually trickles down and infects all strata of playerbase. Shitter guilds try to get all world buffs just to wipe on molten core trash few minutes later. 
---
There might not be consequences for it - at least visible ones - but if 1 person starts doing it in your guild, soon everyone will.

I‚Äôm starting an internship (as part of an MA) mental health counseling teenagers with addiction problems (oh the irony) Day 1 is August 26th. When they announced the release date I pouted all day :P I‚Äôve come to accept it though - I‚Äôm no speed leveler so what difference does a few days make
---
Useful, and I took a SS. Hunter freeze trap counts as a stun, didn't know that.
---
No, they are separate. People have been in the beta fo months testing the game. Stress test is just for 2 days to stress the servers having higher populations on them. Hence why it‚Äôs called stress test.
---
Engineering is semi underrated as a tank. You get a bit of utility/aoe threat building from goblin sappers and such but later you'll need engineering if you want to equip a force reactive disk which is just about the best aoe threat tool warriors can get their hands on.
---
Nothing wrong with tailoring while leveling.  You can make bags and you have something useful to do with all that cloth.  I am usually easily able to level up first aid and tailoring through most of the cloth tiers.  Once you get up to Runecloth then you might have to let one or the other drop behind.  Maybe I subconciously go out of my way to kill extra humanaoids, I don't know.
---
Bags are good.  Making your own cloth gear is always fun.  Not always 100% most efficient way to gear up, but there is something very satisfying about making your own blue item.  Mooncloth is a good moneymaker at max level.  If you are a caster dps you will want tailoring for Bloodvine eventually anyway.
---
You can do tailoring and skinning, then drop skinning and pick up enchanting once you get your mount and have some extra money.  Tailoring and enchanting do complement each other quite well.  Tailoring being the only profession that does not require a gathering skill.
---
you cant shadowmeld while in combat

---
Have you tried oldschool Runescape? Sounds perfect for you. Game is basically from the early 2000s and kept that way in spirit.
---
Alchemy+herbalism is unquestionably the best if you plan on leveling solo. It isn't even close.
---
Reading this made me so happy I no longer play retail. So damn boring.
---
Hope you enjoy it, at least!
---
What? Freezing trap is a disorient effect not a stun. It says so right there.
---
That's exactly what I was looking for. Thank you!
---
No it‚Äôs counts as testing the servers stability with higher population and that‚Äôs it. They can give a fuck if you found a bug because there is a 99% chance they already know about it.
---
That is legit ok.  Most guides say sell to vendors.  Stacks of rugged leather eventually sell for a fraction over the vendor cost anyway, but that is late in the server after the economy is all twerked anyway.
---
To be fair, running in game is probably one of the most impressive things our characters can do. Plenty of npcs can do crazy shit, but from all the escort quests I‚Äôve done none of them can come close to matching the mach speeds I reach going from boar to boar when they aren‚Äôt pissed at something.
---
What...?
---
It's... Vanilla Warcraft. I don't understand what you're saying. Are you in a medical emergency? Do you need someone to call help?
---
This is pretty big news. I remember the sub going wild over this a few days ago. Everyone was really hoping they would use the original text.
---
Getting a guild as a rogue in TBC is a complete nightmare. It's nothing like that on classic at all.
---
High warlord undead warlock!
---
I just wanted my warrior partner the opportunity to go ham if he desired. I spose i could engance and switch later if itll level us quicker.
---
Why not take skinning and mining and just save all your mining resources and sell the skins then drop one for engineering later ??
---
I sham‚Äôd with a mage in vanilla... I‚Äôd go with skinning and mine/herb.  Mage with tailor and enchant.  
---
I had leatherworking and didn‚Äôt find it too lucrative.  I usually made one armour set for myself and maybe sold 2? It could have just been the server we were on.  
---
This duo definitely taught me to maximize my ‚Äútanking‚Äù ability.  I can‚Äôt remember exactly but I know it involved rockbiter, self healing, earth and frost shock.

I havent PvPd in a loooong time, so I sadly don't remember :(

Except CS doesn't share with KS right? I think CS gets a special except and only shared with itself. Possibly the same with pounce (doesn't share with bash?).

"Ranged physical attacks can now be blocked by players and mobs."
---
wait wut? players and mobs can stand in the path of a ranged attack and LOS the intended target so that he doesn't get hit?
---
Well they excluded EU and started it during US work hours. Probably not the best time for a stress test. If they really wanted to slam the servers, start it at noon EST on a Saturday. Not many people are going to take off work to get into the stress test.
---
I would say yes, I would like this feature added.  It doesn't affect gameplay in any way.
---
Something related, does anyone know what running speed effects stack? There is of the boots enchant, 2h sword from Rivendare, primal batskin set. That‚Äôs all I could think of.

Ah yes, I also miss making casual racist and homophobic remarks on a daily basis /s.

"President Bush, Osama Bin Laden is right behind you", a secret service officer stated.

Same oeople: yeah we know it's easy, but we don't want to spend 2h instead of 1h in this shitty raid.

Dunno. Probably less. If it only lasts a few days having it set to 30 would be redundant. Not many people would get there.
---

---
Would be sick if we could login our char to a blank screen so we could do all our configuration. Holding out hope for it.
---
Damn its true
---
Most efficient way to level professions is at 60, spending gold for low level mats. Farming low level mats is a time sink. It's worth so little gold why spend time doing it when a billion noobs will be running around at low lvl gathering everything you need and selling it to you for scraps?
---
actually good
---
I'm not arguing with you. I'm stating information I heard from a Blizzard Q&amp;A session about Classic. It's not 'common sense' that Blizz would waste all this money porting Classic only to drop it after a few years, either. That's your own stupid train of thought others are pointing out as daft for various reasons in this thread. You're free to go find and watch the Q&amp;A video if you like. I even pointed you in the right direction. I'm not here to pander to you, that's for Retail kiddies. :^)
---
&gt; buffed 1.12 class talents
---
people always claim this is a thing but theres never proof or even comparisons. tons of classes got worse from 1.1 to 1.12 and literally not 1 person has ever shown even a decent guess of the damage differences
---
poopsockers, ugh...
---
XDDDDD
---
I don‚Äôt understand what you mean? I just think learning from past shitty behaviour is normal and ‚Äòkinda missing‚Äô it makes no sense.
---
They can't force you to keep paying your sub, but that's how expansions work. If Classic is a prolonged success, there will be new content. The easiest content to implement, therefore the most likely to be implemented, is TBC.
---
KS is the exception.
---
It's not a big deal... do it while auto-running down a road between level 1-10, when it really doesn't matter.
---
Ol' Zenkiki will be takin' a break dis time. Gotta rest dese bones for classic. But be lookin; out for me old friend Necheka. He be a bull-mon but he be gentle.
---
I'd be fine with Guild Bank if there were requirements such as having 100/150 guild members and having a significant gold cost to unlock each tab.
---
That's a good point; Tauren is unpopular so the zone will be pretty empty for questing. I must be a contrarian because I dislike Alliance starting and questing zones, I've always felt like Horde's were better. Except the Undead zone.
---
Damn, where can I find it? Quite interested, it wasn't there in the original post on the topic.
---
Pretty awful. Shaman in general are the thirstiest class in the game. 
---
Solution: make your own groups, invite Mage.
---
Yeah, but classic wow is a re-release, so twice in a life time.
---
Intellect increases the rate at which you increase weapon skills btw
---
It's not accurate to how it was though, you can see vanilla mages aoe farm without the issue we have with leeway.
---
Link pls
---
I‚Äôll be at burning man :(
---
The lasher's in, I think it was Moonglade, that spawned endlessly were perfect for leveling weapon skills because they were high enough health they didn't die instantly and they pretty much stayed aggroed to the Night Elf NPCs so you didn't take any damage!

25,000 thousand years ago, Velen and the other Eredar that didn't join the Burning Legion fled their homeworld of Argus on a spaceship powered by the Naaru. The Naaru might as well be gods to all other sentient races except the titans. They've been around since the dawn of time, can travel through dimensions, and are responsible for the Light that powers all Priest and and Paladin abilities.
---
That spaceship was called Genedar and also inside it were a few Naaru. After visiting a dozen or so worlds in hopes of finding one they could hide on (which they did not find in those 25,000 years), the pilot Naaru, named K'ure, fell ill and forced a crash landing on the homeworld of the Orcs. The Orcs didn't have a name for their planet, but the Eredar (now calling themselves the Draenei) called it Draenor and the name stuck.
---
K'ure never left the crashed Genedar, which now resembled a giant mountain-sized diamond. For centuries, his essence drew all the deceased Orc spirits to it and eventually the Orcs founded a religion centered around their ancestors and this mountain they now considered a holy site and called Oshu'gun or "Mountain of Spirits".

As part of that religion, Orcs would hold a festival called Kosh'harg there. All the clans from across Draenor would attend and the spiritual leaders would all make pilgrimages inside the mountain to commune with their ancestors. They would add blessed water to a pool inside the heart of it and then have visions. That pool of water was actually all that was left of K'ure, who now depended on the Orcs to survive his illness and he was responsible for their visions.

[This](https://imgur.com/T3zZ3rm) is what K'ure looks like, which is pretty similar to all Naaru. So it's entirely possible that these ancestor Orc leaders saw visions of K'ure and came to recognize his appearance as a symbol that was later crudely drawn out for all other Orcs whenever stories were passed around at the festival and elsewhere.

So when the whole Gul'dan plus Burning Legion thing happened on Draenor that led to the Orcs slaughtering the Draenei, destroying the planet, and using the Dark Portal to enter Azeroth, they adopted this symbol they've known for centuries because it was respected by all Orcs and wasn't already claimed by any one clan.

Trolls have baller 2H animations so enhancement is a great choice. I'm struggling between Tauren and Troll myself. I think Trolls have the cooler totems anyway.

No. You need money for mounts and bis. Enchanting will cost a lot and give you less stats than cooking while leveling.

Did you even stop for a second and read the words? It's literally in the name. The name describes what it is. Stress test. If you think a one day stress test is about finding and reporting bugs, you should go see a doctor because you might be mentally challenged.
