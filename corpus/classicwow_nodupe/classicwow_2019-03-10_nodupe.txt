The last blue post still said release in summer. Therefore I’d guess August latest.

Love it!

Is this some melee question i am too ranged to understand?
---
It all depends on your goals.  For wpvp mobility is king.  Druids, hunters, mages, rogues dominate:. Even if you can't win you can escape. For bgs and larger groups you need anchors more.   Pallies, warriors, locks come into their own.
---

---
The other main thing to consider is the need for dispels.  Pally and priest (warlock with fel hunter is honorable mention) are the only classes with a defensive dispel which is pretty clutch.   Decurse is nice but not nearly as essential.
---
I think my choice for overall fun pvp is hunter/druid/SL lock.  Lock is not mobile but is a beastly anchor in wpvp and provides great damage and tons of versatility.  Druid and hunter have enough snares to peel and dictate the engagement.  Not exactly a low skill cap on that group though.  The newbie friendliest combo would be warrior priest mage or warrior pally mage.  Cc, DPS, win.  
---
It is funny that you mention getting lost.  This is one of the most immersive experiences you can have in a virtual world.  When commenting on new games coming out (Panth:RotF for example), I'm all over the boards beggin for no zone map with my location on it.  You want a fog of war map? - great, but don't show my location.  I want to get lost.  I want to have to remember my way around.
---
I had a cool idea for maps.  You buy them in towns near the zone.  You get what you pay for.  The 2 copper map you bought from the beggar has multiple errors because that beggar has never been there.  Maybe his map will lead you into a den of really bad monsters when you meant to find a quite pond.  If you want a more accurate map you can spend the 2 gold to buy it from a cartographer.  The map will be an item in your inventory that you have to click to see.  It takes up some of your screen (but not all) and doesn't show your location.
---
Character selection screen sir! They start at the character selection screen :)

Go play the very popular high rates wotlk server. Grind and gear up fast. Experience the raiding and pvp and heroics. Then get best in slot gear in no time. 
---
You will have scratched a tiny bit of the itch, experienced a great time in WoW history, and it will remind you why classic will be THE BEST!

I completely agree about ESO.  I really enjoyed it as a one-time play through.  I tell friends that ask me about it to treat it like a single player game.  The storylines and character voices (John Klese anyone?) are fantastic.
---
I didn't realize, but I will look into that.  Thanks.
---
I like that since you have so few tools, so few items, that your efficiency really comes down to your personal skill.
---
Grinding mobs and even running dungeons is my favorite way to level, especially in that range, and it feels very much like a test of skill.
---
Of course there are plenty of tests of skill every stage of the game but the simplicity and purity of those early levels involves a perception of... cuteness for me. I think a level 5 character is cute.
---
Are you kidding? Buff my warrior now or I'll right click report you!
---
That feels like one of those functions that wouldn't get changed over time.
---
huh? but maexxna is proven to have 3700 based on a retail vanilla screenshot where a hunter uses beast lore on it? And also from one of the old vanilla WoW game manual type books they show the stats of two bosses in MC (shazzrah and another one) and iirc they too had 3700 armor 
---
Neither works.
---
Be careful though, if you do your new friends for gold in goldshire, you could get banned. 
---
source?

I swear the conspiracy theories in this sub sometimes..
---
Yes, I agree. But how does it relate to the original part? Sorry I dotn follow :D

Yeah you'll max out your weapon skill after a level up very quickly it's not worth considering. It could be useful if you just got a new weapon and want to lvl it from 1 to 300, but for 5 points which takes maybe like 3 mobs, it really doesn't matter. 
---
That formula is something private server devs came up with. It could be true but just as well be completely false.
---
It's honestly not worth the mana cost considering the miniscule benefit.
---
Only the most hardcore progressives group swap. Casuals guilds aren't going to care.
---
If you have 3 Shamans without mana tide, and 2 with, then group them accordingly. 
---
The ship wrecked quest off the shore of azehera you can't complete b/c the entire quest line is incomplete...
---
Core class mechanics will be as they were. So whats with all the ranting?
---
Wow noobs need to know that every weapon is a hunter weapon.
---
Lol I remember logging in to play mage and int, frost shield and water would take you to legit 0 mana lol
---
we don't know if classic is doing 1.12 itemization or not. There's literally been no confirmation don't make assumptions.
---
And that justifies us giving ActivisionBlizzard our money to play that game?

Ya my mistake 3731 was the total
---
I know I’m part of the problem. I always have enchanting and I need on everything the game will let me
---
Some one made a forum post saying "I'm quitting the game because NhvK corpse camped me so much"
---
lol, /r/thathappened
---
You sound like someone who takes themselves a little too seriously.
---
These are the same picture 
---
I like leveling more than the endgame. There’s so many different dungeons to run, and I like to run every single one of them. Compare that to level 60 where you have 7 or 8 to choose from. 
---
Plus I really enjoy going through a zone and exhausting the quests, getting side tracked into PvP, and making friends. I think that’s why I always turn into such an altoholic in Classic. 
---
I really like 30-45 because of the dungeons. RFK and RFD, Scarlet Monestary, Gnomergan (sue me), Uldaman and Zul’Farrak are some of the best dungeons in game. 
---
I also like that everybody has almost all of their kit at this point, but you still look forward to new abilities every few levels. 
---
I have heard that warlocks are very good at both. There’s one talent build they can use (SL? I’d have to check again) that lets them do raid dps but still have the talents needed to survive in pvp
---
No, gild that one: ⬇️
---
Thinking sunder armor armor threat generation stopped at 5 stacks. I was tanking raids before I found out any differently.
---
Also, it took me until TBC to learn that battle shout was good for threat generation.
---
I think there’s a lot to enjoy in a low-stress MC, ZG or AQ20. These raids, even when pugged, are all pretty fun to run. I like to feel like I’m part of a team, but still be able to stand out from the crowd and have personal responsibility.
---
I remember 5 weapon skill taking forever if it was near your cap. I know that it takes no time on private servers. It behaved pretty much like fishing where every subsequent point was harder to gain if I remember it correctly. But maybe that was an earlier patch.
---
main ones i know of is SM/Ruin for locks
---
0/30/21 druid
---
I guess we'll find out.
---
To that end i wasnt sure if the video was implying that you could use all three debuffs at the same time to get the effective armor to zero. Was just making sure that i also remember it correctly the spell interactions from 12 years ago.
---
was thinking the same thing lol
---
I cant see Soul Link in this build.
---
You're underestimating how hard it is to raid naxx. To raid naxx successfully you need to be in a guild that has consistent enough and competent players. These guilds will be requiring autistic amounts of consumables because that's what private servers have conditioned them for. If you don't have the free time to farm consumables 24/7 and you end up in a more casual guild good luck ever killing KT. Ask any teacher how hard it is to get children to do their homework or show up to class on time. Is the content easy? Yes. But unless you're literally gonna buy your entire raid consumables for all of naxx you need a pretty dedicated team of nerds to accomplish it.
---
If the item is specifically suited to your class + spec, and it is an upgrade, then feel free to hit Need.
---
If it is for off-spec, then you check/ask if anyone else in your group needs it. I.e if you're playing Arms/Fury Warrior as DPS, and a tank item drops like a shield - the tank will get priority, but if it's not an upgrade, or he/she has it already, then you can ask to need it for offspec.
---
This applies to both BoP &amp; BoE. 
---
As for enchanters - their greed roll is just replaced by Disenchant, and they have to try their luck that way to get the item. (if you're doing a guild run and have a designated enchanter, everyone else passes, and the enchanter get any unneeded items to disenchant, but not for random groups)
---
If you are running some random low level players through a dungeon,  you can lay claim beforehand to a specific item - i.e a BoE drop, for one of your alts. This also applies if you're running low level guild members through a dungeon to help them out. They get the XP + random loot, except any specific item you're after. (which is usually BoE stuff)
---
Get ready to make some enemies lol...
---
Stranglethorn Vale.  Great artwork.
---
Seeing as you're the third different person to reply in this thread, I'm going to just lay all my cards on the table. I've never been the cutting-edge wow player. When I came back for legion, I had more options than just dungeons. I got to step up into heroics, to mythics, and LFR, normal, and even heroic raids. 
---
If the argument at hand is "vanilla casuals have more options", I find that mathematically laughable, given all the tiers that were opened up to me. +other things to do ingame that never existed before.
---
If the argument at hand is "vanilla pre-cutting edge is meaningful while retail isn't", I don't see why running &lt;current tier - 1&gt; is more meaningful for one side yet worthless in the other. It just doesn't feel rational.
---
If the argument at hand is "vanilla raiding is more accessible for casuals", I concede that it's more likely a casual is brought through nax40 than mythic Uldir. But that same (partially-raid-geared) casual is more likely to clear heroic Uldir, at the same input level, as seen in "raider" numbers.
---
But at the end of the day, I can't be arsed to argue 3 different people with 3 different outlooks in one smooth chain. Not like I can meaningfully right the retain-hate-boner this far down in the comment chain anyway
---
Naw, you right. It's pretty garbage.
---
And I think you're overestimating. I guess we will see.
---
CDPR are going to take their sweet time. I expect a 2020 release date but probably will announce the date this summer.
---
When grinding/questing, either would be an okay way to go- just try each spec and see which you play best or enjoy most. For even faster leveling, tank and healer lfm dps will get you dungeon after dungeon until you can't take another scarlet monastery run. That will also gear you better, and warriors are very gear dependent. Switching specs costs, so you may take that into account also. 
---
LOL Yeah you're absolutely right! I was mostly taking a quick jab at the Horde, but Thunder Bluff is rather serene.
---
They are drastically different
---
Those are all good things.
---
Hunter
---
30/0/21 Warlock
---
1/29/21 Druid
---
There is no any "armor diminishing", thats fake!
---
Tips should learn more about game mechanics or at least start reading patchnotes.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/yX1ppT9.png](https://i.imgur.com/yX1ppT9.png)
---
I’m confused, if the Shadow Fang drops from SFK, isn’t everyone supposed to need? It’s a BoE think item that goes for hundreds of gold on the AH.
---
They can't do that. The only thing you need to create a Bejeweled addon or whatever other single player game is the ability to draw things on the screen. Everything else is just generic background code.
---
Really depended on server. My server all boe got greeded unless you needed it and equipped it on the spot. Some servers all boe got needed on. 
---
&gt;As for enchanters - their greed roll is just replaced by Disenchant
---
Oh wait, is this actually done in the UI?
---
Un'goro. There's a [boat that you can click](https://www.wowhead.com/object=161505/a-wrecked-raft) and then I think you grab a bag of supplies from the water. Or perhaps it's the other way around. Either way you get it from near the linked location and then go see "Linken" in Marshall's refuge - the Un'goro quest hub.
---
That is not evidence. I know when my guild killed Rag at first we all had some fire resist as our gear wasn't great since it was early. I farmed MC a lot throughout Vanilla (My main was a priest), I ran MC in a secondary guild on my Rogue later on and and ran a pug MC group on my warrior after BWL was out.
---
The only MC raid we ever cared about FR was my main when we were first progressing in MC. My rogue joined the secondary guild later when they were doing progression in BWL and no one cared about FR and I certainly didn't care about FR in my PuG as we had a mix of players from fresh 60's with mostly pre-raid Bis to players well geared in T2.
---
My point is that you saying you guys didn't worry about FR doesn't mean much. I don't even know if it was better for the raid to have FR gear for early rag kills or not and we won't know in Classic until it's released.
---
Classwise id say anyone who hasn’t even tried a shaman is missing out. Quest or aesthetically... nah fam you aren’t missing much. 
---
Correct me if I am wrong, but I am guessing that a guild that had two MC raids per week was also working on BWL or AQ at that point?
---
Because it might very well be the case that you didn't need fire resist gear if the raid was getting into Tier 2 gear, but that at lower gear levels you did.
---
[removed]
---
Sure I never claimed it was hard evidence. My experience suggests better dps &gt; than fr if you execute the fight properly. 
---
I know on private servers people have done math but that's completely a moot point. 
---
Agreed that we wont know for sure until classic but I feel pretty confident saying the whole raid doesn't NEED it. Maybe its useful to sacrifice a piece here or there but I'm not even sure about that. Anyways this was so long ago, my memory could be wrong. 
---
He kind of is. Technically, hes strawmanning the private servers. Afaik, neither the values nor the degree you can stack the armor reduction debuffs are a part of the current modern private servers. I mean, he suggests some server got 2 DEoI, but Ive never heard of this before. 
---
Ahh ok. I'll definitely be all over farming my consumes etc. Only thing I won't know is how much time/effort that takes. It'll be interesting to learn/find out.
---
Yea, I'm excited about current BiS lists potentially being inaccurate and having to re-figure out what those lists are.
---
Not entirely. I may not have explained it too well i admit. But this is how weapon skills functioned in Wrath of the lich king, which has much better documentation. So i admit it may be incorrect, but it's not made up. It's based on how the system functioned, at a time when weapon skills were still in the game very well documented.  
---
It's a mess to be sure, and i don't claim pinpoint accuracy. But to be sure, weapon skill does matter and if the break off point was never changed between patch 1.12 and the abolishing of the system entirely. You would do well not to engage mobs with a defense skill of 11 or greater than your weapon skill.
---
no it was still greed.
---
Still totally worth it!
---
Yes that is true but we decided to ditch the fire resistance gear early on- during rag progression, based on the advice from a guild on another server.
---
Haha yeah. Mostly as a joke but in a priest match up if they are dispel prone just keep casting it to burn their mana until they realize they're wasting mana
---
SM/Ruin warlock with shadow burn works very well for both PvP and pve. 
---
When it comes to items, anything which is stated ON the item is known. Proc chance of hand of justice for instance. This means mostly all BiS lists will remain the same. If an item like thrash blade procs 5 times as much on classic, naturally it will be a bis item. Right now I cant think of anything else.
---
I fail to see the downside of this.
---
I was 15 at the time.  I don't want to relive the embarrassment of knowing the people who knew me when I was 15.
---
I'm not sure what you're talking about, Fury warriors were very capable of tanking dungeons and offtanking shit in raids, they threw on tank gear, went in prot stance and used threat generating abilities like sunder armor like a normal tank. Of course prot spec'd warriors will be the primary raid tanks, I don't think anyone has ever disputed that.
---
Still love your videos, I always level fishing for amusement but I didn't start that till wrath. So its neat too see the uses in vanilla.
---
Ironfoe

---
Feenix had all bosses buffed(HP/Armor/Damage/Cooldowns) 4H had 4 times higher HP and mark#4 kills low HP players(healers).
---
n ost (and other pservers) had buffed boss armor/resistances(the min armor was 4600), another one had AQ40 bosses armor buffed to 6400...
---
Dalrend's swords drop rate is lower than it should be by like a half...
---
It's pretty good later on in progression when you get a tone of crit. 
---
Dude...yes. 
---
Yes, anything with "chance on" which isnt stated on the specific item. However, these are few items in the grand scheme of things.
---
I guess we'll see when Classic goes live.
---
Is there any way of disabling right click auto attack?  I can't imagine I'll want to use auto attack as a warlock.
---
Priest is one of the best levelers, second only to warlock and hunter.
---
Yeah I was just naming another one - and a lot of people think that one is off on private servers. 
---
A page to wright your characters back story.
---
Who's Joseph?
---
What kind of macros for hunter and druid that are useful in vanilla can't be replicated with the new macro scripting language?
---
Why reply to people too lazy to look something up? Fuck you and the guy you think you're helping by babying him.
---
Idiot.
---
What?!  I learned about binomial probability hunting for a recipe with a 33% drop chance off elite giants.  After about 10 kills, there was a 99.98% chance, and I STILL DIDN'T HAVE IT!
---
I never knew why.
---
That was back in 2015.
---
Yea, but thats the issue with private servers. Even if they were to find a "true" source, anything with grants extra hits is bound to be very strong. So it really doesn't take much for it to become extremely strong.
---
Players who AREN'T twinks are no longer a thing.  I hated leveling up in Legion.  People one-shotting mobs with fancy swords they got from their mains, while I was using an obsolete green mace.
---
Hello
---
I'm quite confident that's not how weaponskill worked in vanilla though. There were changes to weaponskill in 2.0.1. It only refers to a change in glancing blows and critical strike chance. 
---
Reports from tests from actual vanilla speak from 0.04% hit per point of weaponskill.
---
My first MC as a level 60 fury warrior. Full 40 man raid. Clear the entire thing and get to Rag.  Everyone is circled around getting ready, some AFK taking a quick break. Like the curious noob I was, walked into the spiral and talked to what I thought was going to be some cool lore NPC.  
---
NOPE.
---
Summoned Rag. 
---
Wipe entire 40 person raid.
---
Instant guild kick.
---
It was an honest mistake.  No one told me he summoned the final raid boss!  Mixed emotions of shock and hilarity!  Ended up hearthing back to my home base Thunderbluff and laughing my ass off about it haha Joined a PvP guild and never raided again.  Got all the PvP blues and some epics though!  Av and Wsg 4 lyfe after that day.
---
I never had a character with enchanting in vanilla - if there is no disenchant icon when an item drops, then they'll just have to hit greed.
---
For what its worth, I played a Destruction/Affliction warlock all through classic. I was in the minority, and everyone asked me why didn't I just roll a mage instead.
---
But bear in mind, damage meters didn't exist yet. So you were judged on play style and skill than hard metrics. And my lock could do anything. Nukes, AoE, improved dots, improved drains and two fears. If I had my succubus out, the group had CC. If I had my imp, we got the HP buff. 
---
It was an absolute blast. I never had a problem getting into a dungeon group or raid. And I specced the same through BC and Wrath.
---
There absolutely are questions as to how stacking effects are calculated. Multiplicitave vs additive is a huge deal, for example the later patch changes to threat reducing effects.
---
Also, there are concepts in the game of buffs and debuffs that don't stack, for example you might have an Int Scroll and Arcane Int up. You have two buffs, however only the larger one takes effect, if it's dispelled or runs out then the smaller one kicks in. Some effects stack, some don't. 
---
So yes, there's absolutely a concept of "armor diminishing" in the game that is not readily apparent how vanilla actually worked.
---
It could be argued that things are easier simply because people know more and people playing Private servers are going to be those that are usually more informed. To that end people are more likely to play things that are more fun for that playstyle. As in less people are going to play MS spec to pve in order to pvp.
---
As someone who wants to collect mounts, this is one of the few reasons I will probably end up rolling dwarf over human...
---
I agree with the spirit of the post. But if a boe epic drops I would rather everyone roll need. If you don't someone will and it will lead to drama. 
---
I'm in the "keep everything as it was" camp, but this would be a delightful Easter egg. 
---
nice
---
If my character isn't leveling up, I stop seeing the point. Don't care about raids etc, because it all stops being important to me once my character is unable to grow.
---
Other people might say that equipment is the next frontier, but if I don't have active quests or goals, I just don't care anymore. That's when I make a new character and start all over again.
---
Old shadowmeld had 10 seconds CD and let you drink in stealth, so it could be used more liberally.
---
Those dirty mages will intentionally skimp on buffs at every opportunity to save on some mana had to join their secret chat channel and watch their assigns to punish slackers who didn't wanna spot rebuff.
---
It's 2019 download a buff tracker and save everyone around you the headache please.
---
I just joined the second best raiding guild on the server &lt;Adversaries&gt;. I was on trial, and was not scheduled to raid so I was out doing who knows what. All of a sudden I get told that the raid has room for me, and that they needed me to pull Baron/Shaz with my pet. 
---
I knew nothing of the pathing and had never been inside of Molten Core before. I go to pull the boss and.. my pet dies as Shaz and Baron are next to each other.
---
Sure as hell I see both bosses turn the corner and wipe the entire raid. I refused to feign death, and told them I deserved the repair cost. They all gave me hell, in a nice way, and laughed it off.

Wtf you would think blizz would have there shit on lock, if i dont have good ping and gm support whats the point in not continuing on private servers?
---
My guild used to use a bunch of methods to keep paladins out of combat so that they could res while an encounter was going on. This was really early wow and they had many patches where they "fixed" it but serveral times it still worked.
---
This included battle resing during Rag or in AQ fights.
---
Was pretty fun to be running around while your guild was killing a boss and you were just like don't mind me just resing here.
---
LFG is fine. LFG cross-realm is poop.
---
So to cap it off, we know 100% that weapon skill affected damage lost to glancing blows. Exact value to be determined at launch.
---
Weapon skill effect on hit is ambiguous at best, with no strong irrefutable evidence pointing either direction. It may be anywhere from insignificant 0.04, to a more significant 0.4 depending on player weapon skill and target defense rating.  
---
Most importantly in the context of this thread:
---
**What we do still know, is that Warriors and Rogues in particular will appreciate Arcane Intellect as they generally get very little or 0 intelligence from gear. Paladins, Shamans and Hunters on the other hand will have low intelligence compared to casters, but much more than Rogues and Warriors.**
---
Raid for Onyxia.  Before they started the fight, they reminded me to get on voice chat.  I failed to tell them that I was alt-tabbing to start it up.  I got back to the game and they'd gone in already.  I aggroed one of the elites that spawn after you engage, and a warrior came out to save my bitch ass.  The warrior died.  I died.  We wiped at 1%.
---
I buff everybody unless I'm actively fighting a mob or in a super crowded city.  Just seemed like the thing to do.
---
That addon was damn overpowered. Leveled almost twice as fast. Although I found a free one that was basically just as good. forget the name though. Most retail players probably use it now.
---
Item procs yes, but there's also examples of his with the rejuv spell for druid. Other class spells or abilities *might* change that re-adjust BiS stat weights which will change non-proc bis items. That's probably NOT actually likely to happen but we won't know until Classic comes out.
---
You proved the point in your own comment. Your first rag clears you likely had some raid members wearing crap gear like t1 sets. Nobody knew about all the rare drops in the game, nobody had spreadsheet bis lists. You got a purple and you assumed it was better than your blue. Dps was a lot slower. As a result the fight lasts longer and more healing is required so it makes sense for more raid members to wear FR. Modern raids are only taking minimal damage and are chugging fire protection potions.
---
Escort the chickens in Tanaris, Feralas, and Hinterlands. Receive permanent mechanical chicken pet.
---
Druids are currently spamming HT and FF. To my understanding no change to regrowth would change the BiS list. What do you have in mind? 
---
Just hopping around waiting for our raid to all get back from our bio break. I accidentally blinked into a trash mob pack and wiped us all. 
---
&gt; Sure I never claimed it was hard evidence. My experience suggests better dps &gt; than fr if you execute the fight properly.
---
Yup, and mine suggests the opposite but neither of us has enough actual evidence to actually conclude one way or the other :p
---
And yes, if you did it without the raid having FR then the raid doesn't need it, we don't know what's optimal though.
---
And to build on this, when you hit 40 and get that sweet talent. Now you're really wondering if you made the right decision.
---
To pretty say the same things as those above, yes you are but it isn't a big deal. If you prefer how the alliance side of the game feels, then you should just play Alliance. I'm the opposite of you: almost always played Horde, Alliance aesthetics just feel mundane and typical to me. Yes you are missing out on quests you haven't done Horde side, but things like Dungeons/Raids, PVP, Crafting, etc. are the same (except maybe aspects of PVP).
---
I would put it this way: You're probably *not* going to have a better experience playing Horde over Alliance just because you haven't played Horde before. It would just be slightly different IMHO.
---
Legion finally killed the game for me, I was done. Then bam the classic announcement and I'm building a new PC and watching hype videos. I thought I kicked this drug 
---
Ulduar is/was the best content in all of WoW.

Coefficients being different for spell and/or stat values for one thing.
---
My very first memory of WoW is approaching Orgrimmar for the first time.  I was stunned.  I was never particularly impressed with Alliance after that.

\&gt;\*reaches level 20\*
---
\&gt;Whew, finally level 20. I'm calling it a day.
---
\&gt;\*logs off\*
---
\&gt;\*logs on the next day\*

\&gt;\*looks at character selection &amp; creation screen\*

\&gt;Oooooh! A warlock! I totally wanted to be Drakedog in Vanilla! Now's my chance.
---
\&gt;\*rolls warlock\*
---
\&gt;\*shaman gathers dust\*
---
\&gt;\*reaches level 20 with warlock\*
---
\&gt;Finally level 20.
---
\&gt;\*logs onto warlock the next day\*
---
\&gt;You know, Vurtne was awesome back in the day. I've watched so many videos of him, plus I'm older and so much smarter now. I think I'm ready to be him now.
---
\&gt;\*rolls mage\*
---
\&gt;\*1x lvl 20 shaman, 1x lvl 20 warlock, 1x lvl 20 mage, 3x lvl 20 warriors, 1x lvl 13 druid, 1x lvl 30 hunter, and 1x lvl 20 priest later\*
---
\&gt;\*Blizzard announcement\* Heros of Azeroth, you've cleared Naxxramas. Some like strawberry, some like pistachio: we still like vanilla. TBC Classic will release soon!\*
---
\&gt;Fuuuuuuuuuuuck!!! Again I've wasted all my time rerolling like I did in Vanilla! 
---
I have a feeling good boe will be need by everyone. People will know what the stuff is worth. 
---
Damage meters were prevalent throughout vanilla...... 
---
The first rag kills for try hard guilds are going to see their members in crap gear so it might be better to farm some FR gear (like the fire guy in BRD that drops FR bracers) instead of another piece or two of pre-raid BiS gear. Even then it might make the first easier with some FR gear instead of pre-raid BiS, not undoable though.
---
Once you’ve finished all the zones, I’d love to have a folder of these for my desktop to cycle through.
---
But theyre already stacking +heal to reduce the HT rank they can use. How would a lower a higher coef change it? 
---
The first time someone mentioned such a thing on my server was during BC. Specifically in a Kara raid. We might have been behind.
---
If they really needed the resist they would go into UBRS and mindcontrol the one add for the FR buff. Really though it's not even necessary.
---
Great stuff - keep it coming! 👍
---
New one is also still great because you can do it mid combat to cancel enemy spellcasts
---
Don't you ever had multiple armor debuffs on you? Didn't you noticed its additive? 
---
Feralas? - Faire Dragons and Taurens combo ;-)
---
Also, if you're talking about "scrolls" and "the more powerfull spell" - there is a proofs that FF is works when Sunder Armor is up...
---
Or you want to say that Battle Shout and Blessing of Might don't stack? :-)
---
All that multiplicative shit with non-percent-based things(resilence,haste, arp etc) started in WotLK.
---
Also I have an evidence where with Sunder Armor+FF dmg reduce was 4% and when FF fades it was 12% ;-)
---
Sure. 
---
Also if you have good fire resistance gear (like with significant actually useful stats) I don't see any reason not to use it.
---
I think the major mistake is when you see people wearing a ton of green "of fire resistance gear" which tons of people were doing and I really think was a mistake.
---
Straglethorn Vale, AKA PvP war zone.
---
I can understand that.
---
Part of the reason I'm rolling an orc Shaman over a Tauren.  I really just want the undead skeletal mount, and no way in Hell am I trying to farm Baron's mount as alliance (aside the fact that they don't have shamans, anyway).
---
I don't think I'm going to get to raid, but it'll be interesting to see. I'm pretty confident 15 years of game knowledge is going to make a lot of stuff easier, but the videos I've seen from private servers are also trouncing stuff so I won't be shocked if it's still a bit difficult.
---
But really it's major speculation and I can't wait to see.
---
Being a tank and running WoW on a recycled library computer that took me 5-6 minutes to load into an instance.
---
And the elf is looking at the dwarf like "wtf are you holding".
---
Who cares I'm so over that fat fuck
---
/spit
---
Pretty much my macro limit.
---
Has the OP got a patreon?
---
&gt;If a BoE drops ~~and it's not an upgrade for anyone, everyone who wants loot should roll greed~~ everyone roll need, since it can be sold and another appropriate BOE can be purchased.
---
Yup. Everyone rolls need on BOEs.
---
If I can't use it, i can sell it and buy a different BOE that I CAN use.
---
Presence of Mind, Pyroblast. 
---
My brother got into the beta, I did not.  So we shared.  I moved my sleep pattern earlier so I could get up early and play before school.
---
Horde people aren't conservative they're stoners so I personally will only play alliance 
---
The have liquid weed now.
---
Well, not in game but...
---
After a really, really, really long grind session near the end of Vanilla, I remember stumbling out to a deli down the street at about 6am and asking how much gold my bacon egg and cheese was.
---
If your favorite perk about a class is running from a fight, I've bad news for you. 
---
* AI is an expensive, not very spammable buff
---
* To my knowledge, nobody actually knows how much intellect affects weapon skill gain
---
I remember watching a rogue tanking nef for a while when our tank went down... I was amazed. 
---
Wazzock is dead.
---
3.0 added a 2 minute cool down and removed the ability to drink/eat. They do technically still have it but it sucks. 
---
Its getting harder and harder to tell, tbh.
---
Is that a Seinfeld reference? Well done, sir or ma'am.
---
Am one of the few who thinks Orgrimmar is thematically and interestingly better than majority of the Alliance cities. Ironforge comes close.
---
You're missing out on playing for the best faction, that's all.
---
NO CHANGES REEEEEEE
---
Yeah no 
---
Okay... the whole point was that we don't know how much if any FR will be needed in Classic (if any at all) since it *might* be different than pservers. How you go about getting that FR is an entirely different topic.
---
Lower healing coefficients would mean +healing wouldn't be as valuable as other stats like spirit or int which might push some spirit or int gear ahead of some healing gear as BiS. That's just one example though.
---
I mean youre definitely correct, but int and spirit would only surpass +heal in value if your mana pools needs the extra regen. 
---
Ignore the wife, call in sick once a week, and don't sleep... Ever. Those are my plans. 
---
lol. So get fired and divorced. Thanks for the advice.
---
I’m conditioning my wife by playing my PS4 from 8:30 (time our 2 year old goes to bed) until 10-10:30 about 3-4 nights per week. I’ll just switch this to computer time once the summer hits and should be fine for the grind.
---
Only if you didn't grow up poor.
---
On netherwing the T5 bosses have something like 20% increased HP or more. They say it is to compensate for 2.4 talents but I think it’s a little absurd because there is 2.0 itemization so melee are pretty cucked. Particularly ferals. 
---
I’m kinda in the opposite situation. Never really played an alliance character and will use classic to do so.
---
I'm just really glad I didn't like shaman.  
---
What about adult “time”

Commander of the [Darrowshire](https://youtu.be/1dTxcHulFBI) militia.
---
So before patch 1.9 hunters could split pull last boss with their pet which would reset cho'rush. This made the last boss very easy to kite solo.
---
Once that is fixed, it's still possible to solo, but requires skill, as if you let cho too close to the boss then he'll heal him. 
---
Actually it's a little more complicated - cho is sometimes a mage, sometimes a priest.
---
You're right, there are some definite arguments for why they might handle things differently with BC. However, I still am far from confident it would be handled EXACTLY like it was with the private server, between itemization, attunements, and Raid/dungeon nerfs.
---
I don't believe a Nostalrius dev actually believes that on private servers Sunder Armor and Expose Armor stack. Even somebody who ran dungeons on there for a week or two would know that this is not the case. That claim alone brings this entire video in to question.
---
I was dead set on playing alliance when I got WoW. Since Warcraft II, I was ALWAYS humans... Boy I'm glad my friends were all Horde... Totally opened up the lore side of things in the game for me. Try it out. 
---
Did not know this thank you! I’ll make sure to throw them on everyone
---
Just Feign Death, duh :p
---
Delete spirit
---
I've never heard a miner or herbalist who mine a vein or pick a herb in a dungeon offering to roll for it, it's theirs and I dont expect them to. 
---
The reason that the active users / registered users is so much bigger is because this is a small subreddit.
---
Everything you've said and every conclusion that you've drawn as a result is meaningless.
---
I've been horde forever basically, but started to become a big fan of gnome warriors aesthetically. Fem orc or fem gnome, gonna be hard to decide
---
Druids are really fun and totems and pets are annoying as fuck imo
---
What about curse of shadows that buffs shadowbolt? The real reason warlocks are less powerful than mages in early content tiers is because they lack spell hit and threat reduction from talents.
---
Well my main can beat your main 
---
Omg, you just reminded me of the stun bombs I'd make for PvP as an engineer! Can't wait. 
---
Absolutely! I don't know anything about that private server so i can't really make an educated statement on it. I was just trying to provide some insight on why Classic is going to be a 1.12 iteration only.
---
Mad rush. They have never had name saving.
---
Disc priest, warlock, shadow priest. crazy synergy with lock/S Priest, dispells, CC. This team might be better in TBC tho, where resil is a thing
---
Played the demo, because I really needed to know then if it was nostalgia talking, or if Classic WoW would indeed be good as I remember, before I would waste anymore time following Classic development and stuff. The demo did not disappoint, and am looking forward to the game. Also I wanted to play the demo so that I wouldn't have to on private servers. Private servers I want to avoid. For me it is either Classic officially run by Blizzard, or Classic doesn't exist at all.
---
What if someone can equip and use that epic? If someone needs it that makes them a ninja if they don’t equip it right then.
---
With limited debuff I remember it being easier and more effect for locks to just help mages
---
Slice and dice just increases attack speed so it doesn’t break cc. 
---
If you are skinning you’re going to want finkles for skinning core hounds in mc and onyxia. You’re going to need a skinning enchant to gloves on a random pair of gloves to get that 315 skinning. 
---
Quest sharing will be a thing if you mean that you don’t have a quest and your friend does and your friend can share that quest with you.
---
Well I was just responding because I get alerted everytime someone posts here as I started the chain. I was just explaining what he meant because you asked. If you would like my answer for why classic is better then casual. I said it at the start.
---
Classic wow is amazing because it is very accessible and easy to pick up for new players. While also being deep and complex for long time veterans. Classic wow never put barriers between me and my friends. It never took the time to silo people away and seperate them by skill.
---
One of the best experiences of classic is watching 25 of your friends die around while the last 15 people killed the boss. It was so fun.
---
Now I know you may be thinking why don't all the best hardcore players just stack into the same guild and EZ mode content. The answer is pretty simple. A few will but most will not because of loot.
---
Loot is pretty rare and if you are in a guild with 45 other Mega try hards then you can't really justify why you should get it first. However if you raid with the donk squad in a mixed skill raid. You can go hey. Look at how much I contribute you should give me first loot. All of the casuals will be happy to get the left overs. 
---
Some of my best gaming memories came from there... A true masterpiece. Going to watch vid now. 
---
System of a down and muse during bgs or farming.
---
TIL wow has ewoks
---
Yes, that's why it's mentioned here daily.
---
The very second you get in, hit that create character button, enter the name as fast as possible then hit enter and pray it worked. You can worry about recreating the character properly in a few days after the mad rush has died down.
---
Am I an asshole if I try to reserve my names on as many servers as possible in case I want to switch servers someday? Are other people planning on saving multiple names on multiple servers?
---
For MTing troll is the best, beserking helps build threat and tank is one of the few classes that can realistically get the 30% haste buff out of it.
---
From on of my fav episodes of Futurama..
---
Slurm Queen:
---
Yes! Which is why we'll market it as New Slurm. Then, when everyone hates it, we'll bring back Slurm Classic, and make billions!
---
Spirit is a completely underrated leveling talent for characters like rogue and warrior.... it can be more effective than having strength/agility on your weapon/gear for increasing overall efficiency while grinding. There’s a YouTube video out there outlining all the math ... if I find it I’ll come back and edit.
---
Tl;dr: I would change nothing about it, spirit is useful as it was originally coded.
---
Everything is more fun than paladin.
---
I loved Peggle!!!! Personally I love addons and hope all the old classics make a return. I plan on playing a holy priest so grid will be a must. 
---
Huh.  Neat.  Might do it.  And who doesn't love a raptor?!
---
Aq chain will exist. I hope they change up some of the war effort mays though so we don’t fly through that.
---
If leveling is not your primary interest in WoW, then you shouldn't even consider the leveling experience at all when choosing a post-60 main.  
---
It's a minor inconvenience at best that you only have to do one time with that character.  
---
&gt; in a few days
---
LMAO no.  
---
Spirit increases your damage while in spirit form.  
---
Because reasons.  
---
You're going to get kicked from a lot of groups and waste a lot of time spamming LFG for new ones
---
They didn't. The ONLY profession item that caused drama in dungeons (outside of 40 mans) was the Pristine Hide of the Beast. The whole logic with that was the hide required the raid/group to kill the Beast so the "deserved" the right to roll on it (it was needed for an epic item quest). Where the skinners "believed" regardless of the Beast being a late raid/dungeon boss it is still their profession that got the item so only skinners who skin him "deserved" it. All the other profession drops were obtainable outside the raid/dungeon so people didn't care about it. 
---
The Hide drama got so bad that groups would just skip him to avoid the drama.
---
Shit talking some useless thot in our guild in private vent binds. Then realize I wasn't in binds because I was on a different PC.
---
I'm saying I'm planning on hitting 60 with all 3 of those characters (mage, warlock, and hunter). I am debating between hunter and warlock for my first toon, and probably won't know which will be my main till I've played both at 60. This is just to help me decide if it makes sense to try one out first, even if i switch over at lvl 20.
---
At least at one point or another the dal rends drop rate on Nost was super broken. They dropped on almost every kill. I got both on the same kill. 
---
Get SL with a Felhunter out and you hard counter them, though.
---
&gt;For example: Spirit now allows slight hp regeneration in combat. More spirit, greater percent of hp regeneration in combat.
---
Roll troll, mon.
---
Yeah, take your time and see what other people do sometimes. That's a tough situation.
---
In my opinion saving names on one server is fine but doing so on other servers is pretty scummy. If it's like 1 or 2 names on 2 or 3 servers that'd be fine, but people who save 10 names on their main server and another 10 on another server etc are scummy as hell.
---
Yes, in TBC too. I've seen people reroll to Gnome to be better in Arena. 
---
Escape artist is very good because it helps you with one of warrior's biggest issues: being kited.
---
Other racials tend to make you even stronger against classes you're already good against imo.
---
Yeah, there was no icon so you had to do it manually. If it was a BoP item they could d/e, you would let them need and then /roll on the mats.
---
What I've got is a list of the name I want for my main.
---
It starts with the name I want.
---
Followed by a variation of that name I want.
---
Followed by another acceptable variation of that name I want.
---
Followed by a silly but acceptable version of that name I want.
---
Followed by several more.
---
Then the name I want with the word mule at the end.
---
I checked the database and I really think I'm gonna get the name I want.
---
Depends on your playstyle. I prefer pally because I like to be a unkillable rock, which can turn the tides in pvp and is also fun to play in pve.
---
Priest is cool I guess, tons of fun heals and can do a lot of helpful spells with mana burn and MC, but shadow is cool for about 5 minutes. 
---
Just try them both and whichever one you keep leveling is your choice!
---
There’s a quest in the barrens that mentions Chen Stormstout. You find a barrel of ale, return it to an orc in Ratchet and he gives some cool dialogue. 
---
Back in Vanilla? Or are you talking about private servers? I think some people may kick you from a group for stuff like that.
---
Agreed. You're denying potentially great players from ever having those names.
---
I can somewhat understand if it's a screen name you've been using for 20 years. I really wish screen names on the internet could be unique per person. Somehow.
---
That seems odd to me. You could easily not have a skinner, and then nobody could get it, so I feel like the skinner should be able to loot it. 
---
I literally just watched this like 20 minutes ago 
---
Praise Hulu
---
Don't forget *NAMEmule* variation.
---
Heh.. you funny
---
Parts of this are quite painful to watch, especially the section on armor. He's actually saying the numbers are just guesses, what the hell. There are a number of ways in which we can know the values and mechanics, one major way is by analyzing old videos and doing the math. 
---
Did they always have the quest chain or was it removed in a patch?
---
I don’t remember doing it but I definitely did ony a few times in pug runs....I could be forgetting though...
---
yeah...i remember wiping on it when soloing it and it was the end of the fucking escort...bunch of coyotes came and got me
---
huggggee waste of time
---
I'm gonna try this...
---
[Deleted]
---
the guy paying 5 x as much as you wont be banned =)
---
HOW ARE YA?
---
Anything but resto.  Enhance will compete over 2h weapons, but that's usually a bit of an overblown issue.  I imagine enhance totems have more synergy with warriors than elemental totems.
---
I knew a 50 year old crackhead many years ago and she used the term *gank* in real life referring to someone stealing all your shit while you're unable to fight back.
---
Generally, I think it it does mean exactly what you think you thought it did mean.
---
I dont mind how it works now, but the best thing to do imo would change how mana regenerated in the first place. Balance the game around having 50% mana regen while casting or something.
---
They are easy to level, but have a high skill ceiling in pvp.
---
They did away with the quest chain at some point, to my dismay. I felt like it was a really good chain, not easy either, and really showed some of the lore.
---
To be honest, I not 100% sure the chain was still in 1.12, but I am pretty confident. 
---
It's equally valuable for someone who doesn't need it to sell it. I think everyone should have a shot at it.
---
You really think some random kid will be dedicated enough to repeatedly try, day in and day out, all hours of the day to create a character with *YOUR* specific name for a few days?
---
Oh.  That's much worse.
---
&gt; BoP loot trading
---
They've always had this, you just had to wait several days and get a GM involved.
---
I dont think they said, definitively, there will be "zero changes". IIRC the statement was "no changes is winning more than they think". And they said 1.12 is their "starting point". 
---
Unless I missed something, there's no reason to believe they will simply release 1.12. 
---
Dead. 
---
I wonder if people are going to take names just to sell them, if that would be a thing?
---
Log on ASAP and take names like Leroy, legolas, Aragorn, Mario, goku,Batman....
---
People are dumb and I guarantee someone would pay money for a name....thoughts?
---
I will play warrior, and I have a story behind it. I played WoW in 2005 very very briefly, and was young at the time so i didnt know what I was really doing. So I stopped. It wasn't until years later (MoP) that my best friend got me back into it. So i made a human warrior named Eragøn. Some irl stuff went down and I wasn't able to play wow for a year, and I lost my account! So, I decided the natural thing to do was to resurrect Eragøn, but as a Death Knight. Now its all I play. So, I'll play warrior and "begin" the tale from the start, origin story. 
---
Just the first thing that came to mind...  
---
Mana regen continues while in combat.Spirit increases the regen rate of all ability resources - rogue energy, warrior rage, hunter pet's focus, and mana
---
I think the point is having to wait a few days to actually play the game with the character you want, looking like you want it to look.
---
Make it improve your chance to break free from/resist CC and silencing effects. Nothing huge, something like a 10% chance for a priest that has a ton of spirit.
---
shay? shei? shae'?'s bell
---
in the top left corner of feralas theres a tree ancient and he wants you to find his little elf friend, but she always falls asleep so you have to ring the bell to make her follow.   completly random out of the way quest but i loved it
---
speed potion lets ou make the jump, theres a hidden quest somewhere there yoi gotta take some alcohol and run it to southshore in the time limit
---
Psychic Scream?
---
reminder to everyone that with the release of classic this could be the last chance to play on these huge single realm international servers.  with region locking and lower pop caps you might not get another chance to play like this in the future with classic.
---
I rarely check the trending subreddits, maybe a couple times a month.  One day I checked, this subreddit was on it.  That's the only way I found out about it.
---
Yep, it's [this one](https://i.imgur.com/LZys48Q.jpg), when you get sent to Elling Trias in Stormwind.
---
There's also a quest, in the Defias chain, where you get sent to talk to Elling Trias in Stormwind, and that one also has a big [piece of foreboding](https://i.imgur.com/LZys48Q.jpg) in it...
---
It's cool but it's just too chaotic and not really consistent.  You will 100% never use in instances, using it in leveling is ok but still sketchy, and most people trinket for it in PvP.  
---
  
---
Oh and it always seems to be my case they run the same direction as me in PvP, RIP
---
Frost mage was decent in PvP when setup for doing MC content. Not perfect for both PvP and PvE, but not bad. I think respec caps at 50g? I don't miss that much... 
---
&gt;Will some classes excel at this?
---
Yes, classes with an instant cast, ranged spell with no travel time are the best at this.
---
&gt;should i be considering this at all for who I make as my first toon?
---
Nah.  If you're struggling to tag a specific named mob for a quest, you can just form a group; you're much more likely to get it if five of you are trying to.  For "kill X number of mob Y" quests, people will be more spread out and it shouldn't be a *huge* deal once you get past the very first starting area (level 5 or so).  Again, if you are having a hard time, group up.  It's a multiplayer game, after all.
---
&gt;Is warlock worst at this?
---
Of those three classes?  Yes, probably.  Mage has Fire Blast, so you can make a macro that you can spam using a /target and a /cast command, so the second your computer registers that the mob is present, you will cast them and since it's an instant with no travel time, you should get the tag as long as your latency is good.  I used this on my shaman with Flame Shock and it almost always worked.  I've never played a hunter, but I believe they can use Immolation Trap to get tags if the mob has a specific spawn point.
---
That said, if you know where they will spawn, warlocks can make their voidwalker stand right on the spawn point and set them to aggressive, so as soon as the mob spawns, they vw will tap them, so they're not as bad as some classes.
---
Personally, I'll be playing a priest so I'll be grouping with others when I'm doing named mob quests like Verog the Dervish.  But, that's only a small part of the game play, so I wouldn't let that be part of my decision making process at all.  If you choose to play a class that happens to be able to tag mobs well, that's a bonus, but there are *way* more important reasons to choose one class over another.
---
Melee classes are ALWAYS 5-10 skillpoints behind their current level, if they're questing properly. Int buffs are a massive help for keeping your skill current and leveling more efficiently. 
---
Yep, and some totems had annoyingly short durations. Mana Spring totem only lasted 1 minute. Totems also had only a 20 yard range on their effect, although you could increase that to 30 with a resto talent, and 40 with the T1 3-piece bonus.
---
Do you have any specifics? I can't remember... 
---
Yup, I finally made it.  Really cool area.

The PVE spec has no frostbite, shatter, cold snap, or ice block; all 
---
of those are critical to bursting, controlling fights, and surviving.
---
Join a casual guild that is ok with progressing slowly and you can run your PVP spec in raids.

Stranglethorn Vale! :D

Depending on how they plan to handle honor calculation, you may get your wish.

IF puts Org to shame. You have to climb a mountain to get to it.

One  that happened in recent times was I was running a Dire Maul tribute run and we got to the chest and I just shift click and auto loot the chest instinctively and I just take all the loot by mistake. My group was pissed, and I was just shocked how I let that happen. 
---
Most of the boe epics to the average player, even one that could use it, are worth more in gold than they are as an upgrade. Alcors sunrazor for example. It's great tank weapon for mc and some of bwl because it's fast with fr. But unless you're a tank in that situation you wouldn't spend 1k or more for it. So imo it would sort of be a waste going to someone who's using it as an incremental upgrade. Freezing band is another example. Bis for mage in PvP, but way overpriced. I'd argue the money is worth more to the average mage. 
---
I guess I'd rather everyone need and then a deal worked out between the winner and whoever really wants it rather than deal with the drama that WILL happen when someone needs and everyone else greeds. 
---
Been there man... Lol 
---
I'm in the same boat. The Horde cities are just so ugly. After you've spent a few weeks in Ironforge and Stormwind, good luck wanting to go back to the mud pit known as Orgrimmar.
---
Ah yes. The soul link, siphon life warlock crushed pvp. 
---
Right. For me, just not getting worked up about it and finishing the run was more enjoyable than getting an epic followed by a trade channel flame war. 
---
Troll mah favorite mon
---
As Pally until lvl 31 when you can respec to get Reckoning it will feel extremely boring.
---
Priest probably isn't much better. Dot, smite, smite, wand, repeat.
---
Interesting idea, not my favorite cause it reminds me of resilience 
---
Pretty sure you can’t drink in SM. That’s some private server shit 
---
You say that because you've never played a Warrior. Imagine your mage had to skill up their schools of magic... And it keyed off Strength... And if you weren't skilled, you'd miss 100% of the time... That's weapon skill.
---
Maybe don't increase costs significantly but just have spirit increase these regenerstion mildly.
---
Wut
---
He is for sure overestimating. 
---
The only way to change weapons on a Warrior is to spend 1-2 hours grinding skill points. Once my warrior got to 60, I'd just roll on weapons and use them grinding AD rep. That way if I ever needed to hit with a quarterstaff, I'd have the skill already.
---
Priest because shadow wrecked in pvp. However you could only play holy in raiding 
---
I played both in vanilla.  Priest is the better leveler (smite until 40 then go shadow).  Priest healing is more fun in raids or 5mans because pally is literally a one button healer and priest has more tools and is more rewarding when you pick the right tool for the job.  But maybe 1 button spam is fun for you (then pally is cool).
---
PVP healing is the opposite.  Pally has a ton of tools (make friends with a warrior and blessing of freedom your way to victory).  Shadow is pretty strong dps in pvp.  Tried ret in PVP a few times but i sucked
---
IIRC the rate you skill up is partly based on enemy defense. If you have 250 weapon skill, and your opponent is level 40 (200 defense), then you'll skill up more slowly than if your opponent has 300 skill.
---
What is the name, so I don't accidentally steal it?
---
I had never played a warlock till a recent private server going live.. every single spawn point was camped by like 5 people..
---
Tagging mobs was the easiest part, spawn items not so much since my latency was not local to the states.
---
One thing I learnt wad how OP the voidwalker was for tagging mobs. Park him up on a spawn point, set him to aggressive and bam! Leave it up to the server calculation and not human reaction, worked 60% of the time all the time.
---
Warlocks are seem to be very versatile, tempted to roll one on classic.
---
I don't like it better but, I like it that it's a true part of your heroes journey. Rather then an afterthought you just need to slog through. 
---
Id say hunter &gt; warlock &gt; mage.. purely due to the pet advantage.
---
I'm not trying to be rude, but really, this is a subreddit of Classic WoW enthusiasts, who wouldn't recognize STV?
---
Got a source on this?
---
I don’t think the quest/attunement were removed until like WOTLK.  100% still in at 1.12.
---
Also, I always heard the Horde version of the attunement was noticeably easier than the Alliance? If anyone has any opinions on this id love to hear them.
---
you never see her without her knowing your existence or outcome of the events.
---
she knows everything at all times 
---
&gt; you end up in a more casual guild good luck ever killing KT
---
You'd be surprised how many casual guilds are consistently clearing Naxxramas. Albeit it took them longer to get the raid on farm, but Naxxramas isn't this scared place it was in Vanilla, where barely anybody set foot in there. The average skill level of all kinds of players, casuals included, is much higher than back then, resulting in casuals consistently clearing all content. 
---
I think you're widely overestimating the difficulty of something like Naxxramas nowadays, on private servers. That's my opinion, coming from a somewhat hardcore raider on a private server.
---
Vanilla will always be the best version of WoW until the end of time for 1 simple reason . . the map. BC was World of Outlands, a dark, depressing, hideously ugly continent built like a frisbee, with flying mounts it felt like an empty hell-hole. 
---
Vanilla map was perfect, and will never get old. 
---
Wrath of the Lich King Patch 3.0.2 (2008-10-14): Cooldown increased to 2 minutes, able to use in combat. Can no longer eat while in Shadowmeld. If you are eating and/or drinking and then Shadowmeld, you stop eating/drinking 
---
This is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.
---
The 40man issues are (likely) due to sharding, which Classic will not have (aside from maybe starting zones at launch. You dont want 1000 trolls trying to kill boars).
---
People overcomplicate this way too much.
---
**No Enchanter:**

Lmao what are you talking about. You make all the names you want. Then delete the name of your main and remake it instantly with the proper image. Better know ahead of time what you want your character to look like.
---
I died somewhere in the goldmine of elwynn forest when I first played.
---
I ended up ghost running into westfall and got lost so badly that I decided to make my own trial account *(Was using friends trial account)* and made a tauren hunter.
---
I feel so stupid because I must have spent nearly an hour in ghost form wondering how far I've come and how the world can be so huge. I remember I only went to about the farm with the mechanical golems lol. 
---
Oh. Thought that was added after vanilla 
---
Absolutely even in pugs it’s one of these mandatory addons even more so for horde side IMO 
---
Where the Curse of recklessness? coulda dropped bosses armor more...
---
You missed the point entirely, read what I wrote again... I know all that, I was saying you were acting paranoid about someone stealing your name because you weren't patient enough to wait longer before deleting the random character your created to save your name then recreating it properly.
---
Prooobably death knight.
---
You can't have both of those in vanilla.
---
Any knowledgeable melee will think twice before ganking you. It works REALLY well
---
This video is from around the end of Vanilla. Retail, late 2006.
---
In EARLY vanilla you could finish a cast in shadowmeld so hunters could open with aim shot or you could hearth in shadowmeld and you’d be revealed after the cast.  It actually got nerfed to the current state of being able to eat/drink in shadowmeld only.  Underrated racial to be sure.
---
Thank you for the original. It is truly a gift!
---
We got uh....no changes?
---
No? My original reply was meaning there's no way I'm waiting "a few days" to play the game. How did you miss that?  
---
I think your right about it being removed during WotLK. 
---
By playing another character instead?
---
####KEEP YER FEET ON THA GRAUND

, said the flight master after sending you on your way.
---
It may be 2019 but I'm fully ready to play classic with a 2004 mentality
---
&gt; As Pally until lvl 31 when you can respec to get Reckoning it will feel extremely boring.
---
Without the sit exploit, Reckoning isn't any better, slightly less damage (10%) than straight up Ret, and falling behind another 10% by level 40.
---
According to everything I've learned about Classic Wow, threat will definitely be an issue as it was in 1.12. With a good tank, maybe waited about 5 seconds to start DPS, and threat meters were a must for most raiding guilds. 
---
It might be that way with the 7.3.5 engine though, which I believe is that way
---
Yeah I'm firmly in Club No Alts, with the obvious exception for level 1 Dwarf Bankers. They actually make my character feel more like its mine, since I can horde my treasures.
---
There's WoWPro, a completely free leveling/questing guide addon. I think it's open source too, or at least anyone can submit guides to it. I haven't used it in awhile but it was pretty decent last time I used it.

TBF I had farmed FR gear, and made all the hit % gear. I was mostly there to help keep ignites rolling

No. I play my main first. Alts are a far away thought. Your advice is probably more appropriate for casual/alt extremists.  
---
ANY leveling gear is inconsequential ^in ^the ^end. I know any useful boe I get during early leveling stages will be saved for when the server actually gets more money
---
Pally is really boring to level I went prot at 35 or so just to break up the boredom that is ret.  Priest is not bad to level.  Healing in PvP I much prefered the pally to priest.  It's fun being a close to impossible to kill healer.

But what happens when the pet runs away because you forgot to feed it....then it’s 10/10 a waste of mana. Atleast buffing the hunter will be useful 100% of the time!

Yes, we'll see Paladins running around in Spirit cloth gear once again.

I rerolled on a different server...

---
On a pvp server, buff me over my pet plz.
---
Nah I spend most of my time in cities. I'd rather be in a gant town with a castle like stormwind or a Dwarven city in a mountain than be on horde in some mud huts with spikes or nasty green water and dead people.
---
No thanks. Horde is garbage, their races are garbage lol cows and dead people and ugly elves with tusks. And their player base is garbage full of edgy kids and people who get horde tattoos and buy horde merch and think wow is real life. 
---
You are missing out on the Horde Infrastructure. The biggest reason I don't like the alliance, those Zeppelins are too good.
---
It's embarrassing
---
This made me nut.
---
Why more for horde 
---
I thought pet attacks don't count as tagged 
---
You are hoping and dreaming that they are way way off. They aren't. You are simply spouting old biases and ignoring any modern theorycrafting of the game. And yes, bears and definitely furys will be a thing. Mark my words.
---
Of course some people like the leveling journey, other people like me like getting to the 60 content asap. Thankfully Vanilla lets both groups of people do what they enjoy as there's no right or wrong way to the play the game.
---
If you see me running around could you go ahead and buff both me and my voidywoidy.
---
I'll trade you a healthstone.
---
One looove! 
---
I never had friends
---
Only if you are forced to go melee but that hardly happens in a normal situation under level 20. Not gonna see any PvP 
---
I just wish there were rules on RP PVP. 
---
So bad when one tries immerse oneself in RP and Legolas127 runs by. Or ekjejedisowkdjdjs. 
---
if you showed this content to people during actual vanilla wow they would just laugh.
---
sure, BRD was a cool dungeon with a lot of time and effort put into it.
---
but a *ton* of people hated it because of how unnecessarily long and complicated the layout was. further, the developers who made brd weren't like some savants, with creative skill far above and beyond what modern wow devs can do. in fact quite the opposite.
---
vanilla devs very often just threw things together that ended up working out. for example, the most iconic raid in wow history, molten core, was built in just one week and was nearly scrapped entirely before launch.
---
brd was great because of *our impression of it*, in a time when nothing like brd's scale existed. this video is a classic example of tips content. good-intentioned, but in no way captures the thoughts of the vanilla playerbase at the time, and puts the vanilla game design up on a pedestal for all the wrong reasons.
---
Nah, i am from da past.
---
I guess I see ur point but I could argue my point just as well. Guess it’s a preference 
---
That jailbreak segmebt in the alliance chain is so bloody long, but the walk through SW makes up for it!
---
Got let into a MC raid with a pro guild then was bopped into the lava by a surger.
---
Smart Warriors and Rogues?  not on my watch!!!
---
Resto Druids using Shadowmeld -&gt; Drink was the entire meta in TBC arenas. That and Human Rogues with Perception to counter the large number of Druids.
---
Great to know, i was about to re sub since i quit on ending legion climax (Burnout), now i think i will just keep playing DS3 and wait for this.
---
There are only a handful of ranhed weapons that hunters should really care about. Stuff like Satyr's bow should be melee prio.
---
I'M YER SHOOTAR
---
14 years ago, I'd still have told you BRD was my favorite dungeon and it has stood the test of time. Yes, there was extra content added on to the end after original design, but it wasn't laid out willy nilly. There was planning and intent in the layout and the map was beautifully used by the designers who utilized it for quests and mobs positioning.  
---
For me, this video hits the nail on the head. Vanilla dungeons were dungeon crawls, reminiscent of table top rpgs. Contrast that with the guided tour dungeons that became very apparent in wrath and even starting in TBC. It's a paradigm that I prefer and greatly look forward to enjoying again this summer.
---
And private servers openly nerf gold farming techniques to make them more difficult. I mean, they say as much.
---
I imagine accurate classic will be a mix of some things being harder and some things being easier. But accuracy is king. So give it to me NOW!
---
Anything that is not accurate, is not good. Nobody asks for Funserver custom values... They ask for accurate vanilla data.
---
I know this is kinda only useful in the beginning of a server and pretty useless at the end but human mage with diplomacy 10% will be getting those sweet purples from pvp vendors before anyone else and you don't have to be a gnome lol. just wanted to throw that in here for anyone looking to play a alliance mage and perception can be useful when approaching a empty enemy base in AB. 
---
That typically stopped once 16 debuffs came.
---

---
Many are asking for harder raids, so that's wrong.
---
Lol. "Many". Nah
---
Overwhelming majority wants Classic as is. The rest can go play on custom tunes private servers. Blizzard isn't even entertaining custom values. They already said so.
---
TIA !
---
No, definitely many. Given you've never played Vanilla, you wouldn't really notice the difference anyhow.
---
Time to reroll
---
Only thing wrong here is entertaining shitty custom private servers. Begone thot.
---
Never played any.
---
druid moonfire is GOAT 10/10 nothing competes at mob tagging
---
Well the properly defined SL Warlock is a TBC pvp spec.
---
So... Kel'thuzad was replaced by Andross?
---
This crayola fad is quite fine. Fine indeed.
---
My first toon was a human warrior back in vanilla. I would eat and drink when I sat down, not knowing that the liquids weren't necessary for a non-mana guy like myself. I was just going with what people do! You have a nice roll, you want to wash that thing down! A nice husband and wife team  (a pally and a priest, if I remember correctly) found me dying a lot in the woods outside of Northshire, and took me under their wing. I soon joined a guild and learned that tanking was not for me. I became good at the mage instead, who knew how to pair food and drink more properly.

It's amazing that tips like these even need to be dispensed.

what about a website that would be able to get this statistic in realtime?
---
&gt;Also, I always heard the Horde version of the attunement was noticeably easier than the Alliance? If anyone has any opinions on this id love to hear them.
---
Quite the opposite, Alliance is centered on BRD, the horde on UBRS. BRD is the easier and more accessible dungeon. On top of that, the horde one then asks you to do a ton of stuff around the world related to Dragons. 
---
You can’t know. Nobody can know what the final ratio will be—especially with all the tourists leaving within months during the natural drop off of popularity after launch. 
---
You’d need a crystal ball to see how realms are going to settle. 
---
As a warlock I will be stabbing with my dagger to tag mobs :)
---
This is a huge problem for him guys, aw jeeez
---
the only grinding I actually enjoy is aoe grinding on a mage.
---
you're better off just following Joannas guide
---
i mean this totally right. people don’t realize hitting 60 takes on a limited schedule. average pace with leveling pretty seriously but also stopping to dungeons takes about 170 hours. if you play 10 hours a week, which is honestly quite a lot for people with families and jobs that’s like 4 months of leveling. 
---
video is gone
---
OP that is literly what spirit was going to do u till they changed there minds.
---
How? In what way? Spirit only effects mana regeneration and those classes have none.
---
How will the private server economy translate to Classic where the population will be significantly smaller? 
---
Sorry, you'll just have to wait a few weeks after the servers go up to find out any information about faction the split. Even if you found out IMMEDIATELY the servers will fluctuate so much on launch that it'd be useless information.
---
1% per point
---
You're kidding right?  New shadowmeld can be used in combat, it's like having vanish!
---
I still remember my raidleader's comment during a Hyjal raid: "I thought we only brought the spriests along for the mana, these guys are doing serious dps!"
---
man i just don’t get any of these. 
---
Both classes are quite boring during leveling. Paladins rely heavily on their autoattacks, since vast majority of their offensive abilities are tied to autoattacks &amp; it is uneffective mana-wise to judge all the time. This makes paladins reliant on their weapon. Priests usually end up wanding their way to 60, as spamming smite and casting shadow word: pain makes them drink a lot. While both classes aren't very enjoyable during leveling, they aren't hard, as their survivability is quite high.
---
Around at levels 40+, both classes will have gained enough abilities to actually do something effective besides autoattacking, but their rotation for leveling will still be very simple. 
---
In Raids, both classes are masters of what they do as healers. Yes, I said healers - you shouldn't expect to be damage dealer in raids as neighter of the classes. Priests are the best tank healers, meaning the healers who specifically focus on tank(s) rather than the whole raid. While paladins are good tank healers too, priests simply dominate that position thanks to their array of heals, ranging from slow to fast, to something in between, and even to AoE.  Paladins are the best raid healers on Alliance side, with Shamans taking the spot on the Horde. Paladins are so great, because they are extremely mana efficient with their flash of light, which is also the fastest heal commonly used in raids. I think you can imagine why it is great to have a fast heal just by looking at the typical character icons for 40 ppl with health bars, which healers use. At the end of the day, though, both classes can fill both roles. 
---
In PvP, both classes are beasts. As healers, both classes are considered the best pocket healers. There are people who prefer a paladin, and people who prefer a priest, but know that both classes are really good at being a pocket healer! As a paladin, you have your fast &amp; quick heals, but also your anti-cc BoF, soul link-like BoS (sacrifice), long stun, but most importantly, you are very T U F F for a healer, since you tend to have more health and you were mostly plate armor. That is, if you are geared. Otherwise you're a clothie. Pocket healer priest is so good, because they - same as paladins - have heals of different cast times, but can also cast instant power word: shield, you can provide a significant boost in stamina (up to 70ish I think!), and if you have the typical PvP spec for a pocket healer, you can also silence. Your survivability is lower for sure, but a skilled priest isn't easy to kill, as they can use psychic scream well alongside their heals, mind flay, and just stuff like that.
---
But not only are they pocket healers in PvP! Paladins are quite good as ret, because their survivability is incredible (I mean, you have plate armor, heals, bubble, anti-cc blessings, bandages...) and their damage isn't half bad. Warriors for sure are better at the dealing damage side, because they simply have more reliable abilities, while paladins kind of hope for seal of casino to proc, but paladins still are very hard to beat &amp; therefore good in PvP.  
---
Priests indeed can be great as shadow priests too. Shadow priests are good, because they have a solid damage base in addition to shields and even heals (usable only outside of shadowform). They can slow melee with mind flay, silence casters with silence, burn mana of casters using imp mana burn, and fear enemies in melee using psychic scream. In other words, unless the opponent has a strong burst or stong sustain, shadow priests usually end up winning. 
---
**BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING** when choosing between paladin and priest is their ultimate abilities. I am talking bubble-hearth as paladin &amp; mind controling people from bridges as priest.
---
Either way, I can't wait to brutally murder your character :) LOK'TAR OGAR!
---
Spirit changes HP regen too.
---
that dwarf bear man needs to be the new r/classicwow mascot.

I usually make it clear at the beginning of my group that everyone rolls need on BoE stuff. Everyone will profit from a BoE the same way. If they can't equip it, they can sell it and use that gold for an upgrade or whatever else they need.

Title of the of the video "15 Thing we KNOW will be different"
---
Proceeds to say "This may be the case" and "who knows if blizzard will change xyz."
---
For example - we have hard evidence via screenshots (hunter in spider wing and rogue on KT) that boss armor values were 3400-4200 and armor debuffs were additive.
---
Tips is a dude who is taking advantage of people who think they'll be able to raid as ret and balance.
---
The TBC specc is "SLSL" for "soul link, siphon life.
---
SL is just an abreviation of a talent.
---
There is absolutely zero information in this video that is quoted from a Nost dev.
---
He said "These are things that the Nost dev's DIDN'T know for sure."
---
He then goes on to hand wave and speculate on a variety of topics that he knows nothing about.
---
The good ol' days of beating hunters' aim shots by blinking then fireblasting. 
---
They refuse to change it on retail and it could potentially effect the world first race there, so I doubt they have any interest in changing it for classic either.
---
AKA It doesn't exist.
---
My enjoyment of a dungeon is not based on level of organization of the design effort, the time schedule in which the dungeon was constructed, or the designer's feelings about the finished product.
---
Much of reason I like vanilla and its components like BRD is because Blizzard did not know what they were doing.  The result pushed the limit of a finished world that still gave the feeling of true exploration.
---
Wish I had friends
---
This must be [verycoolguy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CG1I3Y-jUUI) back in the game of wow to fight orcs on his screen and be good at the game
---
I levelled a rogue to 40ish in early vanilla and then decided I didn't like the FACE of my human rogue and rerolled it. My 13 year old brain decided I couldn't possibly level to 40 again myself and so I paid a company to do it. I remember the price being about less than a pound a level so I used my saved up pocket money. I had a friend monitor the accounts progress and when it got to 40 they continued to play until I was actually 41 so I start to assume they stole the account.
---
I login to account management, change the password, relog in. I've got dungeon items and my professions are decently levelled. I've also got a decent amount of gold as well as my mount. I think great, really lucked out here.
---
About 30 minutes later, I get a phone call to my home phone which hugely concerns my mother - she tells me someone is talking about world of warcraft on the phone. I head down and in very broken English someone is asking me to log out. I explain and they tell me that they are unable to access my account and I reiterate my concerns. They tell me in vague terms that I had qualified for a bonus and they were levelling me to 50 free of charge. But now I've lost the bonus because I disrupted the service.
---
Very strange. 
---
It's old gameplay philosophy on top of nostalgia. I wouldn't be surprised if classic approached a few million or even matched retail. Graphics don't matter if the gameplay is good, Minecraft proved that.  
---
"You've ruined your own lands spryspryspry, you'll not ruin mine!"
---
Does Horde have any equivalent to the IF bridge? If i have nowhere to stand and be an elitist douche why even raid bro.
---
This is basic logic to be honest. There is no proof they are actually doing it, just that making the content harder would be more beneficial that making it easier.
---
No blessing of Salv from Paladins
---
It always bugged me how a group felt entitled to an enchanter's D/E but when mining nodes/herbs/locked chests came up "well you can't pick them or gather them". I won't be letting that double standard slide this time around. I remember rogues in SM picking chests, they justified it by saying they were the only ones who could open it. They were always silent when I said "could you solo kill the 2 packs of 3 elite mobs guarding the chest?"
---
Oh don't give me that bollocks. There's no place for that attitude here.
---
I've been playing on various private servers on and off for years and it's still better than retail - despite my minor gripes.
---
You could easily not have a group, and then no skinners could get it.
---
Blade Runner (1982). It is a fantastic movie.
---
I mained mage in retail vanilla, and have had a 60 mage on two different pservers. 
---
Blink worked more reliably on all the pservers I've played on than it actually did in retail. 
---
Warlocks scale better than Mages in terms of raw damage and pass surpass Mages DPS numbers in AQ/Naxx though
---
On top of Org bank or AH.
---
as far as I've seen,  pservers either accurately estimate boss armor, or over-estimate it, making melee dps do less damage. 
---
I raided in vanilla from MC (my first rag kill I was in half greens of the eagle) to Naxx. The theorycrafting knowledge that we have now was very much not widespread among the vanilla community. I'd say we almost never put up faerie fire on bosses, even though it stacked with sunder and was a big dps increase for melee. Most vanilla guilds didn't expect, let alone require, flasks for anything prior to Naxx. I vividly remember members of my vanilla guild bitching about having to flask for C'Thun. 
---
If some pserver guilds make the raids they do look "too easy" these days, it's because the level of play expected in leading guilds is much higher than the level of play actually achieved by most guilds in vanilla. I don't think I ever used a fire prot pot in my vanilla guild for Rag. 
---
"When selecting a realm, how will we know that the alliance and horde ratio will be even"
---
We won't. Like we never did bevore.
---
Spamming rank 1 serpent sting on a fact low lvl white or grey sped things up a lot for hunter ranged weapons.
---
I understand that there is the dead zone to manage, the traps to take advantage of, the variety of shots that you have at your disposal, but the flavor for me is less appealing than say, warlock, where my pet is enslaved, my utility is eldrich and fel, that's just my preferred flavor.
---
&gt; You'd be surprised how many casual guilds are consistently clearing Naxxramas.
---
on private servers....
---
Unless you are experienced vanilla nerd, you won't notice any difference in mechanics between pservers and Classic.
---
This. For the longest time KT had like x2 or x3 HP and some bugs like teleporting making it virtually unkillable
---
Paladin tanking was completely unviable in vanilla (for raids) because they would go OOM faster than an OOMkin, and once OOM, would have no way of generating threat. Also, the gear available for paladin tanks was pretty lousy. 
---
Druid tanks were perfectly viable in vanilla (with post 1.8 buffs to bear/dire bear form armor) because the drawbacks to druid tanking were manageable- they could be crit and crushed, but they also had higher HP and often higher physical armor than a warrior in similar quality gear, also, their threat was not mana-dependent and was quite high. A druid tank can sustain higher threat per second than a warrior, until they die. As long as the healers in the raid can handle a little bit more average healing (boo hoo, shut up and drink your major mana pots you slackers) there was almost no fight that an appropriate-geared bear tank couldn't handle. 
---
That didn't make them the best tanks, and in general they were uncommon. but, they could work. 
---
Prot paladins couldn't effectively tank anything harder than UD strat. 
---
I played Human Rogue in vanilla and had 0 problems with warriors. 
---
&gt;Sharded questing zones so you don't need to compete for tags.
---
Insert Activision Blizzard Blood Elf pointing.
---
Fuck that, gild OP - its his birthday 
---
the 2.0s cast got 2/3.5 of your +heals and the HoT got at least the remaining value, but I think actually more- Regrowth in total had a higher than 100% coefficient for +heals. Like Pyroblast getting 100% up-front and an additional 75% on the DoT. But, it was still rather mana-inefficient compared to downranked HT, and because different druids couldn't stack the same HoT on the same target, was rarely used. 
---
\/y how i mine for fish?????
---
This is why it's good that pservers are there, to keep up some form of competition.
---
I sincerely hope Activision Blizzard doesn't fuck this up.
---
Can't wait to fish again!
---
Even if private servers were getting raw numbers wrong and increasing dps of the raid by 20-30% that is objective proof in my eyes that Naxx isn't the monolithic raid it was made out to be when the only different between the best and the worst was optimizing dps. If the mechanics of the raid are working properly that proves more people have access to it. Some of the fights were not hard, heigan the *uncle* was mostly a dance check.
---
That's terrible.
---
Twice on a private server I CoD something to two different players both +50g value, but I forgot to make it CoD! I whispered them and they both sent me the 50 gold anyway.
---
I was buying Bloodvine set pieces and someone sent me two pieces in the mail forgetting to CoD! Each piece ~200g. I paid them anyway.
---
Feels like to not get screwed or not screw people.
---
Fortunately all my experiences on pservers have been like this. I wonder what my eventual retail Classic server will be like.
---
time for a change then
---
Lmao get horde tattoos 
---
totem management is a big hassle so its not that much of a biggie
---
stormwind tho
---
&gt;STACK ON ALL SURGERS or you will get LOOT BANNED!

The name doesn't check out, girls don't look at hentai. Alex Jones has debunked that numerous times.
---
then you can finally play the game =))
---
I absolutely love the Horde.
---
gearing a priest for shadow pvp may be quite tricky tho
---
Sorry for your loss, I really hope you enjoy classic to the fullest!
---
I'm excited for vanilla, but I loved the zones in outlands. There's a lot of things I liked in BC that others disliked, like arenas.  
---
I guess flying mounts were the beginning of something bad, but they weren't completely un-fun back then, they were new and exciting. It's hard to judge, I had only briefly played vanilla at level cap and had never experienced TM vs southshore pvp. Even if i would agree that BC killed world pvp, I'm guessing I'll get my fill of it in Vanilla, and will feel pretty comfortable making the trade-off after a couple of years. We remember world pvp as this great thing, and I mostly agree, but world pvp had stayed the only real pvp option the past 15 years, it wouldn't be held on such a pedestal.
---
My mt was eng and mining 
---
I was enchanting eng 
---
We would two man farm dm e with two rich thoriums at the end. He mines, I DE all the non weapon blue BOP items. Good money. Idk if this will work on classic servers 
---
I was one of those people who, for the longest time, only used a bear pet and guns for my dwarf hunter...
---
plenty of good guilds will take a shadow in raids
---
but only 1
---
I knew someone who paid for a lvling service in wrath, once they are finished leveling you up, they take your gold and all the extra items they gathered. You only paid for the lvling up process, not the blues etc. Not joking when I would try to talk to the guy lvling he wouldn't respond.....But if I sent him "Ni hao!" he would send me back some Chinese and then I didn't know what to do lol...
---
Also if you use these services or buy gold do not use your real email as these shady businesses will sell it out to other companies that send spam email advertisements. I don't trust any guarantee that says they don't share your info.
---
If you forget to feed your pet so much that it runs away you are a sad excuse for a hunter.
---
fine, here's a gear list for pre-raid/tier stages for the classes;[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10IV\_3NEmZdhh8iQXrs2Ek77YyUJbjBMWO5UxIWLlZl0/edit#gid=1184824748](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10IV_3NEmZdhh8iQXrs2Ek77YyUJbjBMWO5UxIWLlZl0/edit#gid=1184824748)
---
A lot of people that have only played private servers are in for quite an awakening when Classic hits. 
---
Absolutely - I feel like I lucked out. I was a naive kid at the time and this was definitely early vanilla so any emails used are definitely not in use currently! 
---
I've just finished Season 2 and I am fully on board with the hype, and in a way, glad I waited. Enjoy!
---
The Horde had always been home for me. The architecture is less awe inspiring than the alliance, but I think many of the quests are better. They grapple with tough challenges like finding their way in the world...
---
The tough challenges they face in the lore make it very real in world PvP when you encounter alliance.
---
The races are vastly different, but each independently cool to role play and build a character image.
---
Most importantly, get a much bigger kick when cheering "for the Horde!!". 
---
Ahhh yes TBC where every mage and classes grew to hate warlocks with a passion.
---
The reckoning was in WOTLK where initially every class revenge camped warlocks
---
What is this? 
---
Are you some kinda anti Paladin propagandist lol 
---
If you Feign Death-cancelled their initial fear you had a chance to burst them down before dying to their dots as a BM :)
---
Didn't know this! Thank you &lt;3
---
If you're full PvE spec you'll be sacrificing arcane power, a brutal dps cd.  Block is taken for sure if you're the winter's chill mage in the raid, tho.
---
Not all bosses have the same amount of armor.  In general, "caster" bosses - such as Kel'thuzad - have lower armor than the majority of others.
---
It really depends how you are playing the game.
---
If you are attempting to level fast by grinding + efficient quests, you are squishy as all hell, if you get jumped you better hope your pet can peel off you before you die.
---
If you are leveling slow, doing majority of quests and hitting up dungeons for gear, you will be a bit tankier and its no biggie.
---
Either way the real bro priests are the ones that fort you and your pet :D
---
Dylon, Dylon and Dylon
---
If anything I am complimenting them, all I see in this sub is hate on ret pally damage
---
We really do not have any good data on mob spell resistances.
---
Case in point, different pservers use wildly different resistance values, particularly on elemental mobs.
---
# HWHAT KIN AY DO FER YAH
---
&gt;CDPR are going to take their sweet time
---
You are aware they first announced the game like 6 years ago right? They were working on it even before that, so they've been taking their sweet time and they know they can't take much more.
---
I've notice a lot ofcomplaints about paladins lately, with regard to their low dps and limited combat options. But what players are forgetting is the main reason Blizzard programmed paladins. Paladins were not designed to be hybrid tanks/healers, as many claim. Instead paladins were designed to be played while downloading pornography.
---
Paladins have roughly zero amount of combat interaction, thus making them the perfect character to play while downloading massive amounts of hardcore pornography. Simply target a monster, hit "1" and minimize your window. Then sit back and enjoy amazing girl on girl action.
---
Because paladins take about one full minute to kill a monster, you can leisurely browse the erotic and pornographic fruits of the internet, without much concern over your paladin's welfare. After a minute, go back to WoW. The paladin should still be alive and ready to loot the corpse. This is what makes grinding so pleasurable and convenient. The ability to simultaneously watch girls have sex with each other and level up at the same time. I doubt any other class has such an elegantly designed system, and I applaud Blizzard for their foresight in crafting a character that I can play while playing with myself.
---
DPS? Who needs it? The quicker I kill something, the less time I have to watch my $%^&amp;ies. Combat interactivity? Over-rated. I'd much rather interact with the girls writhing on my computer screen. Yes, a paladin was created for the sole purpose of surviving a fight while you stream hot porn directly to you computer. That is why we have such high armor class, the healing ability, and the low, low DPS.
---
As for PVP, nothing is better than getting into battlegrounds and soaking up honor points while I watch girls take their clothes off for money. Only a minimum of interaction is necessary for a paladin to perform, and it is this very quality that I love most about my paladin. I doubt rogues get any time to watch porn while trying to vanquish and rack up combo points, and I bet shamans haven't seen a single naked breast while figuring out what totem to throw down before choosing which shock they are going to cast next.
---
In addition to grinding, we have several defensive options during combat that also allow us felxibility to download porn. Hammer of Justice allows us a quick 6 second glimpse at naked women while our opponent is stunned, and Divine Shield allows us a leisurely 12 seconds of quality right-hand time. Indeed, paladins have cornered the market on the pornography during playtime of World of Warcraft game play.
---
It saddens me that many paladins don't take advantage of the main functionality of their character and are in fact lobbying for increased DPS or more combat options, unnecessary frivolities that would only harm our pornography downloading efficiency. iinstead, we should thank the fine programmers at Blizzard for crafting a character that is great to grind with while grinding your loins.

It's not a problem. Flip a large enough number of coins and ratio of heads to tails will always approach 50/50. Differences will creep in over time as people abandon characters, but again, attrition is likely to be even on each faction. The difference comes in once a tipping point is reached and the faction imbalance affects gameplay, which won't happen until months after release.
---
Depends if the quest is to get the kill or get a drop off the kill. There’s next to no quest item sharing in vanilla so it’s pretty rare you want to quest with others.
---
I'm hoping for Peggle to make its return
---
No one is talking about reck bombs, that’s different from Ret paladins 
---
I hope I can corpse camp you

A traditional misconception! Thanks for underlying the fact!

i did this in other MMOs didnt really have any IRL friends who played until late Wrath but in other MMOs i would level faster/first because i knew they were going to ask me what to do for the next bit and if i was doing it the same time it would just be the same response of IDK yet
---
You mean Madden or rocket league right?
---
Oh don’t get me wrong I’ll take both buffed anyday! But I’d rather only have my pet get it than only me! Probably just my own preference. Doesn’t seem to be a popular opinion :p

Was during vanilla WoW and i didnt know much, And a friend said meet me at AH and i didn't know auction houses were a thing since i was new, and the only AH i could find was Arathi Highlands.. so i ran there.. i died like 15 times but i made it, only to find out that wasn't what he meant..
---
Depends on what you want. I played horde first, rerolled alliance to join a different raiding guild, and honestly barely remember or care at all about leveling the alliance character. I'm not a huge leveling fan though either. Only ever got 2 characters to level 60. A Tauren warrior and a human warrior.
---
If you really enjoy leveling content and learning the world that way, then yeah, I'd recommend leveling a horde character as well. If that's not really your thing, there's nothing that's so amazing about leveling horde that it's worth doing something you're not that crazy about doing.
---
pservers also let expose armor, sunder and FF stack additively which there is a high chance they didn't back in the day.
---
On my warrior I always switched weapons to improve all skills.  
---
I kept a grey or white in my bags to skill up every time I leveled.
---
It depends heavily what kind of tagging you are doing. Is it super slow with 1-2 people competing? Is it just mobs spawning all over the place with lots of players? Mages are better at the first hunters are better at the latter, warlocks are kinda meh.
---
&gt; The only way to change weapons on a Warrior is to spend 1-2 hours grinding skill points.
---
Do it every time you level up, instead of when you find a new weapon.  
---
I've always carried a bunch of grey/white weapons in the bags, just to level up the skills and stay on par.
---
As long as we don’t have to play with NA I’m happy. 
---
Hahahahahahahahaha
---
Just because tips out says "maybe it doesn't" does NOT mean there's even a small chance that's how classic was, and by no means a "high chance". There's zero reason to think that armor debuffs doesn't scale additively, and this post itself shows KT having ONLY 3k armor IF it was additively, so what are you saying that bosses had like 2k armor but armor reduction is different?
---
Jesus jump on tipsout tip more quickly please.

They don’t deserve names, but they block names that don’t fit with their naming policy, eg military ranks, offensive names etc. 
---
Shock -&gt; Chain Lightning -&gt; NS+Lightning Bolt -&gt; Shock tho.
---
And it's not even accurate. Look at any AQ raid from a decent guild on ND and you will see mages having higher average dps than warlocks by still a decent shot. 
---
Yes, right. But do they actually have a list? 
---
How about settling for fun? Not everything is a race or a performance check. Some people plainly don't want that in what should arguable be their leisure time. Make broad assumptions like that without any facts whatsoever just makes you seem like an unsymphatetic person
---
Someone has to be winter's chill though and the spec is not all that different then. Though you do basically lose 5 points by speccing WC from the standard frost spec. 
---
I'm French too, and I'll play on a FR server with a lot of former mates from pservers. But when I take a look to the french forum, omg... That gives me cancer
---
If you ask or we are at lower levels, sure. 
---
But if the casters are asking for water and I have to make two at a time and the group has already started fighting and has marked for sheep, you'll have to wait until the healer or tank goes afk or we are having a mana break while I have full mana.
---
Anyway, I try to give the buffs, but what do most groups prefer? If I do no fighting the first five minutes, will the others be annoyed? Maybe kick me? Can try to see how people react when I prioritize buffing, but I suspect people will want me to stop wasting time and start casting.
---
Yeah it's a lot of fun farming it on a ele shaman to be honest. They are incredibly good in AV. Ele Shaman and Hunter paradise. 
---
Molten cores fights and trash were designed in a week. John Staats had actually built it long before that.

This is an important distinction to make. 
---
This summer. Rumor has it that the date is July 16, but that's just speculation based on "hints" dropped by the developers.
---
RemindMe! 1 month
---
Yes absolutely. I prefer open areas with a lot of potential for exploration and questing. Raids and Instanced PvP are cool but it's the leveling I'm looking forward to the most. So there is absolutely no rush for me.
---
I actually found myself fond of farming gold on retail. Gonna use that gold for gametime when Classic hits :)
---
I am also struggling with this topic, really can't decide.
---
I was heavily considering to join an English server (not NA) but I probably stick to a German one. 
---
I wanted to go hard and all in in wow classic but my RL won't give me more than a month or two of no lifing wow and then I will be forced to a more casual playstyle. And I guess this will be more fun on a native language realm ... at least for me. 
---
I disliketips just as much as the next guy WHO knows anything about WoW, but what do you think happened to your precious pserver and their infallabe Vanilla experience: They fucked the dog on base armor values, or they screwed the pooch on how negative armor stacks?
---
Try running an emp run on ely core and then on nd and you'll see why I have little trust in pserver jank lul
---
I've played on a private server on and off for some time before the announcement of Classic. A few days before the announcement I thought about playing again, but then they announced Classic and I stopped playing completely except for one occasion where I leveled a rogue to level 6 just for fun. 
---
So yeah, I'm having blue balls but it won't be long anymore. Hopefully we will get some information sometime during the next weeks so there is something to sate this huge appetite.
---
Summer is going to be great.
---
It will be more important than in later expansions but as far as I know they made threat much easier in or just prior to 1.12 so it is not as much of an issue as it was for the majority of vanilla.  Still need a threat meter though especially for bosses that drop aggro like broodlord.
---
I personal love everything about the pala class. I dont’t understand why people say it’s boring. 
---
It’s a strong class in all aspects (except raid dps but it can be done, look for Esfands videos). 
---
I level in ret and use 21-0-30 build to be a good healer in PvE/PvP but also can be a strong dps/support class in PvP. You need 2 gear sets. 
---
Even with the spell breaking at the initial action, having a night elf pop out of no where can be a real surprise still.  
---
Of course I don't believe that's the most useful case of shadowmeld in PVP. The most useful case is scatter trapping and shadowmeld eating/drinking in PVP, in my opinion.  
---
Other people love shadowmeld because you can AFK on pvp servers to take care of IRL business.  
---
The contender on dwarves is stoneform, which is nice against rogues and warriors.  
---
I think hunter on Alliance is one of those classes that really doesn't matter much which one you choose, and your personal favorite is the best option.  
---
As long as the spaniards can laugh in english realms like hahaha instead of jajaja, they're welcome.
---
Just like classic WoW, I'm not watching your videos for the graphics. I like them for the lore and nostalgia. Good luck, either way.
---
While I agree the dungeon was a bit confusing to navigate and should have possibly been broken into a 2-3 instances. The epic scale of vanilla dungeons is something I miss. 
---
Upper/lower black rock spire as an example, did not feel too huge or confusing, but they felt like a large area to explore, with their own story. The "dungeons" of the current game just feel like they're on rails and are clearly designed with a time limit in mind.
---
Yikes 
---
Aye that's the thing. I have a few french friends too, but i'm afraid of what the french realm could look like as a whole.
---
Well afraid is a strong word, but you get the point. I guess i'll try both realm when classic will be out
---
Also, if there is a realm for your native country, play on it. Worst thing Blizz ever did was merge an EU realm with a portugese one, making it totally ass to play on. Mainly because of the language barrier, as spainards, the french and Portugal sucks at teaching english to their population. 
---
Also , cultural difference
---
There will be/would've been a black list yes. I don't think anyone knows it. Probably not even Blizzard these days as it'll have just been updated for newer versions, unless it was baked into the client. 
---
What's the story about 
---
Nah man. This is war. If I see my Horde buddy about to get his ass kicked by an ally, you bet I'm helping. 
---
You forgot a few "Drink" steps in that flowchart.
---
does Perception stack with stuff like Catseye elixir? 
---
Mind you, I feel like whenever the topic of Classic is raised over in the retail subreddit, you can fully expect to be shouted down for daring to suggest something against the prevailing viewpoints. 
---
This man speaks the truth
---
Hunters are great in BG's regardless of race. Nightelves can do some interesting things with stealth and can actually defend better at times and do some pretty funny things with their pet. Eating and drinking in stealth is nice when you are mana tapped. Cats have stealth and they are fast attacking pets that can ruin a casters day.
---
Dwarves are better in 1 v 1, but you should beat rogues anyways and you can cheese duels starting in shadowmeld to. Undead Spriests is where dwarf is really nice. You can get around that to with the jungle remedies for devouring plague. Kite spriests and drain their mana. They can't cleanse it and you will make them pretty worthless in a BG.  
---
The anti bleed is nice on dwarf to but you are almost always gonna put a warrior in combat in a bg. in WPVP you are going to see them on the map. Good warriors that are also geared are also a dime a dozen. 
---
Hunter is the one class where race is really overrated. They are just so strong in pvp if played well that it really isn't that big a deal. Mage is similar. A good mage on a troll or human is still going to be stupidly better than a bad one on a gnome/undead. 
---
Play the Night Elf and have fun.
---
Dwarf is objectively better for all purposes at all stages of the game. 
---
Sure it’s fun to blast clothies for 3k damage out of shadow meld, but it’s not useful for more than one offs like that. The actual use of shadow meld (target dropping) stays the same, letting you interrupt spells while not in combat and avoiding charge and a few other spells.
---
I’d pick stoneform to remove bleeds and poisons all day, but it really won’t matter 
---
I'll probably roll on an English one because I really hate German homogeneous gaming communities.
---
They are using WotLK client and WMT Cameratool ;-)
---
Rick and Morty reference 
---
I can't do tha' yet!
---
If you want to tackle Classic WoW with a sense of danger and difficulty. I'd honestly suggest tanking as a priest, its heaps of fun and integrates offensive and defensive spells. Contrary to popular belief, you can manage to get quite far in raiding. However, its not for the faint of heart and demands you to put in the effort. I grabbed it up a year ago and its a blast to play.
---
&gt; but because tipsout of all people suggested it you are now saying it like it is basically fact just because you really dislike one private server or what?
---
You keep coming back to this? Did he give you his tip or something?
---
So 4800 armor debuff makes 100% sense because you say so, k. 
---
If you speak murloc it turns out they've been trying to tell us all along about the dangers of expansions.we've misunderstood them from the start.
---
Yeah, on point
---
No confirmed release date in that article.
---
Carrot on a stick. Hell yeah!
---
&gt; The actual use of shadow meld (target dropping) stays the same, letting you interrupt spells while not in combat and avoiding charge and a few other spells.
---
This didn't exist in pre-BC that was (i think) a WoLK change. It was an Out of Combat only spell.
---
Definitely enhancement as others have said. Just keep a set of +int healing gear in the bag/bank for when you want to run dungeons and need a healer. 2nd best elemental if you don't want to bother with 2 sets of gear. 
---
I expect to do exactly this with mine lol
---
RemindMe!
---
33/0/18 for life. Fuck the abomination that was the shaman class patch. Still wish think about busses thinking back to those days.
---
For those that don't know before the class patch you had a talent that increased chain lightning damage.
---
I always preferred elemental mastery Vs nature's swiftness personally.
---
Really wish that would revisit the shaman class in classic because that was so horribly handled it affected the class for years down the road.
---
Aw, that's too bad.
---
I'm sure others have noticed this before me, but I just realized that 16th July is in the arithmetic middle of summer. We might get classic then, but it might have just been a 'stab in the dark' easter egg.
---
Yep, and enough locks in the raid, you bring a Shadow Priest.
---
They added a disenchant option later because it was common to have people disenchant and that was something impossible to do with cross-realm (granted this did bring a lot of drama when announced). They are using 7.3.5 engine as a base for compatibility reasons but they want it to be as close to 1.12 as possible so this will not be in there. It is also kind of stupid to force a enchanter to always disenchant. 
---
no one forced enchanters to d/e. It was just consider polite to do so. If you didn't want to d/e then you didn't (and to say some face you just did it after the run). I have never heard of groups just giving rogues locked chests.... ever.
---
I will buff you both and you will like it.
---
"Hi friend, been a while! Oh wait.. flubbery! Hasn't happened yet! Uhh.. uhm.. *long pause* Hello adventurer, it's a pleasure seeing a NEW face around these parts! Ha ha.. ha..."
---
I tried alliance, because I love dwarfs and it's not like I wasn't okay or anything.
---
But it certainly doesn't give you a good feeling. 
---
I think if you don't like the anesthetics of the horde don't do it. 
---
Don't force something you will not enjoy. 
---
sry i dont rp
---
Indeed, thanks for replies everyone. Guess I'll have to live with losing that aspect of the game too if I move to alliance.
---
The most painful quests are the ones at the entrance to Blasted Lands that have you grind mobs for the next 4 hours to collect lungs and whatnot.
---
These quests are definitely what spawned a 15 year vendetta against escort quests....Very specifically the Feralas one.
---
Yea, try classic dot wowhead dot com slash dressing-room
---
"Respecting" the 1v1 is just as much RPing as helping out a player of your own faction.
---
Your guild is not going to ask you to switch to feral in a raid, if you're already resto, if that's what you mean. DPS warriors fill that role.    
---
If you want to heal or tank 5 man dungeons, there's a hybrid spec for that but then your raid leader might be annoyed at your spec if they even notice.  
---
I don't think there's many situations you're going to need to switch from one to the other.  
---
no  
---
Tipsout is so lost, and provides no proof for any of his claims. Here's a demonstration of this in regards to his claim about armor debuffs.

I think all of the different races home cities are perfect representations of their group. The orcs, not generally one to stay still for long, create their huts and move out for the next hut. The dwarves, cut their home out of a mountain, and with the gnomes help, added great technological additions to the forge. Humans, showing their pride in their greatest achievements throughout the city. Elves, living within nature. Undead, living in the most vile looking place possible, maybe just because they can, or maybe to scare potential adversaries before they get past the front door. 
---
All in all, I'm a bigger fan of the alliance though. My problem being that Orgrimmar is far too unorganized. Its so hard to learn where things are, making the city feel less awesome once you are actually inside. Darnassus is kind of similar, not going to lie...but then again, thats why people tend to stick with IF or SW on the alliance side...they are very well organized and easy to memorize the places you need to revisit. Ive got nothing to say about the Undead city though...I only ever remember being thoroughly confused and lost any time I was in there...even worse than with Orgrimmar.

Are most high level enchanting recipes bind on pick up?

You can get 170 fire resistance without wearing any fire resist gear. Why the fuck would people with 170 resist gimp their DPS/HPS and therefore prolong the fight by wearing fire resist gear?

They are both really good classes, but if you feel like Paladins are boring, then what are we talking about.

Human vs dwarf paladin for pvp, but will also play tank?
---
Have the same problem. Tested paladin and priest, but it didn't feel right.
---
I'm going to be in the minority and have a harder time raiding progress, but fuck it I belong in the horde. 
---
And since I haven't played horde on p-servers, I'm so excited for release. 
---
This is a mix-up of  confirmed news combined with straight up lies, as for example [Armor stacking](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/az8jju/proof_kelthuzad_had_just_3000_armor_at_zenedar_eu/)  and  Druid regrowth , which is working exaclty opposite and its expected to be buffed on Retail  because  of  recalculation of HoT ticks contribution of Heal+ on gear as currently regrowth is benefiting none from it on pservers.
---
with clickbaity stuff naming things we KNOW, while Tips proves again is the Jon Snow of classic scene, which is apparent from his class guides (Luckily saved by great co-caster invited)

However in TBC BoM gives flat AP. just something to consider when/if classic wow progresses to TBC
---
Wait, why would you ever need to use a staff with a warrior ? I don't get it
---
Although not really a classes profession, I'd recommend herb/alch. Because you'll make boat loads of gold, get your mounts ezpz,and getting gear will be so much easier with gold.
---
I think I've become a lot more passive with age, I seem to walk passed other players  a lot now instead of stopping to fight with the mortal kombat soundtrack.  
---
Perhaps that will change when I make my vanilla character and relive the dream
---
I hate it when people spam invites for a drop quest
---
100% with you
---
avoided private servers and well wasn't going to pay for a demo when i knew some good youtubers would cover it.
---
My brother brought me into WoW though sadly he brought me to private servers so i have never played retail past like level 10 on a trial account mainly due to being from a somewhat poor family
---
but with a job of my own $15 a month is nothing now.
---
Thanks for reply. herb alch would be be good professions for main or alt? Or just good professions overall?
---
Ya
---
I honestly think that playing a shaman back in vanilla was a good way to be forced to keybind. You had more fucking spells than than half a raid combined.
---
Remember running out of slots on the action bars and using up most combination of keybind with shift, ctrl, alt modifiers.
---
Shame most of the stuff you had as a shaman weren't very good.
---
Also to paladins: You should be blessing yourself with wisdom when questing rather than might
---
I'd say good overall, who can argue with money

I agree, especially in a contested area. But there were a lot of huntards back in the day.

I wouldnt be surprised. Actiblission are bound to fuck it up somehow
---
Create one for druids to.  Thorns on a warlock or hunter, not that beneficial, hit up the pet.
---
No, they aren’t. People keep saying that. I have only ever played vanilla and vanilla private server. It feels exactly the same. Sure there will be small differences in item stats, mob stats, etc, but the game feels exactly the same. Same quest routes, same PvP action, same damn thing. Relax, people! 
---
Pure pwnage? 
---
Nifty stopwatch?
---
I'm torn about that fact aswell. I played an undead priest and I had herb/Alch in vanilla, but thinking about getting Tailoring/enchanting instead, just to try something new. The thing is i fell that herb/alch will be more useful/more profiteable since I won't be playing hardcore, hence won't get all the rare recipies first. Herb/Alch is easier to make Money from on the AH I feel.
---
But for people not into the whole gaming lingo, it means to kill a single player as a group of other players, thereby giving the one player no chance of fighting back against the group of players.
---
Since melee get AP from strength and crit/ap(rogues) from agility having spirit give some hit to spells wouldn't be totally unjustified since they require 16% to reach the cap. Why the hit cap was 99% I honestly don't understand.
---
Not going to happen but if I were involved in designing the classes back in those days I'd try to make int/spirit slightly more interesting for casters while keeping +DMG/healing.
---
Getting 1% crit every 59,5 int was hardly noticeable for the most part and a lot of classes dumped spirit because it has no incombat use outside of 5 second rule.
---
Hi, /u/Thenuclearhamster

Then again, playing with other people? no, thx

PSA to Hunter: Turn off growl Im not going to heal your pet when it pulls aggro.
---
Not that bad if you know how to use timers.  Especially the basilisks further south.  And really those are not bad because they become available at a point where you kinda need to be grinding to open up the mid 50s quests.  And if you're doing them to get the buffs, just buy the shit off the ah.
---
No, not for me. Low level dungeons are fun, but I'm not really looking forward to doing all the same quests and grinding yet again
---
*Cries in Paladin*
---
Also true
---
oh boi those will be some awesome 5 minutes !
---
Go with it on your Paladin. There aren't any other professions that would really benefit you besides enchanting. Only items you'd really want would be from LW and from BS, but that really isn't worth the hassle.
---
being able to run faster in ghost form as a wisp is also great incase shadowmeld didnt work
---
Me too, probably. Spanish servers are so toxic. 
---
A lot of small differences add up. But I also don't think it's going to be a rude awakening.
---
A small thing I'm certain about that's going to affect pvp is dropping combat in pvp between rogue and warrior.
---
On private servers charge will get the rogue out of stealth pressed at the same time. In classic it will most likely not. The warrior will just stand next to the rogue to be opened on.
---
Choosing skinning as a priest makes it easier to appreciate the time spent on skinning as you regenerate twice the amount out of combat with Spirit Tap. 
---
This isn’t right in all situations, if it’s causing you to spend too much time at full mana/health you’re far better off with the better kill times of might.
---
Does any healing class remotely feel like current healers? I played vanilla but only DPS. I started healing in BC. Was a druid until monks and been a monk ever since.
---
I think the answer is obviously no since all healers seem to mainly do ST heals and just various ranks. But anyone that's done mistweaver and played vanilla what would you recommend? At the moment I suspect shaman be the closest in terms of dynamic play and raid healing? Tho still nothing like monk?
---
Did you make this ? ?

I just want atlas/atlasloot, questhelper, and dbm

I was so lazy in vanilla that it took me ages to do it. I'd finish up a BWL raid with my guild and they'd move on to Onyxia and I'd have to leave because I wasn't attuned. Probably started AQ before every doing Ony
---
**If we take rogues and warriors and discuss why not go warrior, but rogue, then:**
---
Good warrior doesn't refuse to tank and enjoys it. That is, if he doesn't outright prefer it. Rogue on the other hand is damage dealer all the time. As a rogue, only thing you commonly do besides dealing damage is stun/sap/interrupt mobs in dungeons.
---
Rogues aren't as gear reliant as warriors. Now, don't get me wrong with this one! Rogues are required to gear up, same as it is with warriors. Both classes have a hard time gearing up, mainly because they share plenty of loot together. Warriors are said to have an advantage in this situation, because as group leaders, they can choose their group members. On the other hand, warriors do have to get more items than a rogue, some of which are rare and expensive (e.g. Lionheart helm), making the gearing up process more expensive money- and time-wise for them.
---
It is true both rogues and warriors need great gear to be great, but the difference is, that a rogue without great gear can still do \*fine\*, while a warrior without BiS gear is mediocre. 
---
Rogues, thanks to stealth, can choose their PvP encounters. This grants them offensive advantage of ambush, as well as defensive advantage of improved hiding. On the other hand, warriors lacking the mobility are a great target for any ambush in the open world. As a warrior, you better hope you're geared &amp; aren't sitting at 50% when the ambush happens! This point is rather irrelevant to PvE servers, though.
---
Lastly, warriors always require something. They need good gear to compete in the top tier of dealing damage. They need good gear and plenty of consumables to be good tanks. They need good gear to be competitive in PvP, and also require a pocket healer (or even a whole group) in order not to be mediocre in BGs. I mean, being a solo warrior player in BGs isn't the greatest experience...
---
However, this is warrior on PvP server talking. If you are considering rolling on a PvE server as a rogue, then I guess my **TL;DR** is: If you feel like tanking is not your thing, don't be a warrior. You won't be \*just\* a damage dealer as a warrior.
---
Save it for the RP servers tough guy
---
if tank pulls to much and you dont have cc you are gonna be happy that pet taunt 1 mob and stop tank for dieing in 1 sec
---
Remember that respeccing is rather expensive in Vanilla.

That’s gotta be the giant gorilla on the island in stv.  Haha

English server for me.
---
I've always played on them (also joining English speaking guilds) first because my language wasn't an option, now that it is they're still the best chance I have to keep improving.

It's also really nice to meet people from all over Europe, being in contact with cultures different from yours is a mind opener.

Blizzard were planning to release classic servers since the beginning.

This makes way more sense. The only real value of a BoE epic is its monetary value, which is equal for every member of the group.

They ban a lot of names that have the same name as major lore characters.

Ok, so go back to when I was in 7th grade and I start playing WoW for the first time. I install it and make my character while so psyched to play with some friends who also got it. I make my first character, an undead rogue, and begin my journey. When he spawns in the starting area my camera just happens to be pivoted directly above his head so it's like I'm staring straight down onto him from above. I would get annoyed going into any houses trying to find quest mobs looking for things in general because what I could see around my character was so limited with that view. Being a first timer to the game I thought that's just how it is and went to about level 15 before I found out that I could move the camera and see this whole world. I was very pleased with that discovery

I've been using a resto druid contact on tights rope to tank UBRS as an off tank and then healing fights.  Not sure what his actual spec is but your entire tanking tool kit will be available as resto, so it's just a matter of swapping out gear.  Even in 20/40 man raids, you won't be expected to main tank anything.
---
Seems legit

Tirisfal Glades.
---
This I didn't know, thanks! 
---
Stop being a drama queen
---
spirit is already more valuable than int for priests/druids, why buff it even more?
---
They are actually EASIER, because of the way armor works.
---
Sunder Armor : 2250 Armor reduction
---
Faerie Fire : 505 Armor reduction
---
Expose Armor : 1700 Armor Reduction
---
ALL the above STACK and are additive on private servers. That is a total of 4455 Armor reduction. Add in other Armor Reduction debuffs, like 200/400/600 Armor reduction from Annihilator and a boss armor will be reduced by 4655, 4855 or 5055, making any boss with LESS than 4600 armor taking 100% physical damage.
---
Now, since in 1.12.1 Sunder Armor and Expose Armor DO NOT STACK, the MOST a boss can have its armor reduced (will apply the similar numbers and example) will be 2250 from Sunder Armor, 505 from Faerie Fire and 200/400/600 from Annihilator.
---
So, a boss 3500 armor (most caster bosses) will be reduced by 2955, 3155 or 3355. In the worst case scenario, he will still retain some armor, but because of the way armor reduction works, even with 300 armor left, a boss will benefit from roughly 10% damage reduction.
---
NOT a big difference between private servers and 1.12.1...for a CASTER BOSS.
---
If you go to physical bosses, things are VERY DIFFERENT. Instead of a 3500 armor caster boss, you have a 4600 armor boss.
---
On private servers, its 4600 armor will be reduced by 4655, 4855 or 5055 (SA + FF + EA + Annihilator 200/400/600). Now, here is the PROBLEM with this numbers : the boss armor goes into NEGATIVE numbers on private servers.I don't know how exactly this will work, but most likely he will get much more physical damage that it was intended.Main reason why Warriors and Rogues are top damage dealers on private servers, as opposite to 1.12.1 where Mages are top damage dealers. Also, this is why a Fury Warrior tank is able to dish so much threat on private servers...because bosses have either ZERO armor or NEGATIVE armor values.
---
But, let's just assume that bosses are left with zero armor on private servers, and the negative armor doesn't exists.
---
In 1.12.1, the most you can lower the armor of a boss with 4600 armor, is SA + FF + Annihilator 200/400/600), and that number is 2955, 3155 or 3355. The most a boss with 4600 armor can lose in this case is 3355 armor, which still leaves 1245 armor.
---
Well, that 1245 armor value is IMPORTANT, because the way armor reduction values works.
---
I am going to skip the calculation (it's way to long) , but a boss with 4600 armor value have roughly 45% physical damage reduction. Once he is left with only 1245 armor (after debuffs) he will STILL retain roughly 14% physical damage reduction, even if he losses almost 75% of its armor.
---
Now, is this such a big deal? 
---
Well, YES.
---
For starters, the entire plethora of Warriors and Rogues will deal 14% less damage, on paper. However, because of high critical strike chance of Warriors and Rogues (where most of their damage comes from) will also be affected by armor reduction, because a critical strike will be also reduced by 14%...but that 14% is from a number that is twice as big as a white hit. In other words, the damage loss from Warriors and Rogues (they usually sport like 50%+ critical chance damage with buffs, elixirs, etc) will be HIGHER than a simple 14% physical damage reduction from armor, probably around 21%.
---
Most boss fights in Classic will be AT LEAST 20% longer, Fury Warriors threat will also be 20% lower (which will be BELLOW a Prot Warrior) and they will be squishier. Hence, a Fury Warrior will not going to be MT in Classic, for any content that is in progress. A Fury Warrior will be squishier AND generate less threat than a Prot Warrior.
---
That alone will add MORE time to a boss fight...because less threat = less raid damage.
---
All in all, BEFORE even talking about flasks and world buffs that will be drastically different in Classic, a boss fight in Classic will probably be 30-40% LONGER compared to private servers. And that will mean more mana spent...which means  better gear for healers...which takes time...
---
All will add up to a MUCH SLOWER progress in Classic vs private servers.
---
Which is why Classic will be much closer to Vanilla than ANY private servers was or it is.
---
Beautiful. &lt;3

As a druid you're a resto healer unless you're deadset going out of your way to be otherwise. If raids need another tank in a pinch they'll get a fury warrior to strap on a shield.
---
It comes down to luck, but being that both factions are arguably equal, differences weren’t really noticeable on average, there were some servers with huge imbalances at launch, but it was far from the norm. 
---
Avoid servers with streamers and you’ll avoid most of these issues. Also worth mentioning that server imbalance usually came after awhile. 
---
For reference, I played on sylvanas eu, where method started. It basically turned into an alliance only server by the time they transferred away. 
---
You can say the same for any pally blessing...
---
most guilds wont even live through aq and still people are dreaming about naxx. its quite funny tbh
---
So a WotLK server using a WMT on that to give the look of Classic?
---
I'm not trying to improve the graphics of Classic in my videos. I'm simply trying to get better, more artistic shots for some of my videos and give it a more professional look and feel in the presentation. I'm glad you're enjoying the content though regardless of the quality levels I currently achieve.
---
It depends on how accurate they are implemented. Do French realms offer BGs with the possibility to surrender before the fight begins?
---
&gt; tights rope
---
top kek
---
In order to raid naxx you need a roster of raiders who will show up consistently. The skill distribution between players in a 40 man is generally much wider than your average retail guild. That means no matter how strict you are with recruiting you're gonna catch atleast a few undesirable raiders. It was not uncommon for my casual guild to go in with only 35 members because there was always someone late, someone who couldn't make it that night, someone who didn't bring their consumables or didn't get world buffs. This slows progress for the entire guild when you have to spend time pugging and teaching them boss strats. A casual guild like this can operate just fine in MC/BWL but once you get to AQ and fights like cthun you NEED every member in your raid to have protection potions. When you're doing cthun progress if you mess up or say one of your pugs screws up the pull well you just costed the raid over a thousand gold in consumables and a very long run back. This adds up. Players don't wanna be struggling on 15 year old content. So when the bosses stop dying the new recruits stop flooding in. Other casual guilds begin to break apart and the successful naxx guilds absorb all the good players. So you're stuck with the roster you have. 
---
At least I have chicken.

But speaking French can open up so many opportunities and potential!

Sure locks have good scaling because of raw % + shadow dmg from Demonic Sacrifice and Improve Shadowbolt Debuff Being good, but when you compare it to fire mage, that has insane crit scaling, a better scaling main nuke, better aoe, and actual damage cooldowns?

Not a chance in hell that lock wins in a fair matchup.

What makes it so neat is how she does it she literally pushes you off a mountain and the next minute you're on the other side of the world falling into a lake. Really paints chromie as this powerful mage.

---
Haha I saw that massive block of text and thought I really pissed off someone who loves paladins until I got to the end of the first paragraph. 
---
Sure your ignite mage will be above your top warlock but your top lock should be beating every other mage in the raid handily. If you were to take ignite and divide its damage amongst mages and add it to their personal dps you would find each mage does less damage per player than a warlock. Also as your mages do more and more damage your top ignite mage needs to worry about reaching the threat cap and pulling off the tank where you can stack as many locks as you like and afk shadowbolt spam without a worry
---
The guy I responded to was specifically addressing his opinion based on private servers. So obviously I'm going to use them as the example as well. If you want to chime in with something, try to actually be useful.
---
K post this again in 5 years thanks
---
The "click" action on the pet spells is to cast it, not toggle autocast. You need a macro to map toggling autocast.
---
What class will have a higher chance of getting a spot in a raid/dungeon: druids or mages?
---
Agreed. I was a lucky druid and got asked to tank a bit in MC and BWL, as I had some insane tanking gear (rank13 gear and exalted bg gear). Always jumped on that, but it was mostly trash packs or I'd bearform and taunt when things went bad for the big weiner warrior tanks.
---
Everyone knew that they didn’t stack when I raided pro back in the day. It was common knowledge. Private server noobs/cheats can suck it 
---
I always thought it was funny how blizzard engineered social relationships based on ingame roles. Mages and warlocks literally hate each other because they share all the bis loot and mage is constantly talking down on warlocks.

I'd always group up with people though so they'd get credit :) It's really frustrating when you have to just sit around and wait for so long, but then again, that's part of the magic. 
---
Yes, because an MMO isn’t about being split off into your precious minigame. 
---
Top tier talent of destro tree is conflagurate, an insanely powerful burst spell, fun in pvp, basically worthless in raids.
---
Improved blood pact is a few extra hp group buff for putting on your raid tanks.
---
The joke works if you don't think too much about how locks actually spec.
---
You can't provide substantiated proof. That's completely illogical to think that linking 5 or 6 comments made in the past few days on a subreddit is going to provide hard evidence of a communities attitude, no matter what side you take.
---
You need surveys and studys if you want to do that. It is literally my word vs your word of what we have seen when browsing the Internet in this case. So as I said, we will have to agree to disagree. 
---
r/unexpectedbladerunner
---
Mages. Most guilds, even the casual ones, will most likely still only bring 2 druids, maybe 3. I'm anything past 2 druids is a negative to the raid.
---
A lot is going to depend on how much previous game knowledge affects what people play. In vanilla there were tons of mages and a good healing druid was hard to come by. If that happens again then if you can heal well as a druid you'll get groups easily.
---
In 5 mans mages were pretty much the most versatile DPS so they'll have a leg up there, but they're still a DPS which everyone wants to play while druids are healers which are in short supply (and I maybe tanks with 1.12.1 patch info, I wasn't doing 5 mans by that point)
---
Can’t you right click it for auto cast? 
---
It's too easy to blame RNG  moments on a rigged system, because you got lucky/unlucky with loot for weeks/months. It happens on retail and it happened back in Vanilla as  well.
---
In regards to things which doesn't  involve RNG, like armor, I've mostly seen posts and discussions back  and forth to find the right armor value for mobs and bosses, never have I  seen something which was blatantly not changed. Unless we're talking  about the smaller servers. But for the biggest ones, I've never seen this being the case.
---
Military ranks are against their naming policy? I never knew that. Any idea why?
---
Sssshhh*
---
The private servers I've played on all had zero etiquette. It was quite toxic, nothing like vanilla. Even with a server cap 6 times smaller than a private server I doubt things will change that much in Classic. 
---
I don't speak French, so I have no way of seeing it myself. I consider most English speaking wow servers to be pretty immature as well. What makes French servers worse?
---
I'd take Dwarf. Stoneform and frost resistance in PvP is probably better than Perception and nothing else is relevant in PvP. In terms of tanking I don't think you'll do enough as a paladin for weapon skills to matter so I'd go with what's better for PvP.

Yes, but frankly toggling autocast is generally more useful, so I always had a macro for it mapped to the keyboard. Particularly with warlocks where pet mana management was such a huge problem. Manually casting is an option, but having to hit torment every 5 sec in addition to your regular rotation is a pain. Better to just let him auto cast 2-3 times then toggle autocast again.

She was having... issues in the bedroom with her hubby. Now the reason I knew this is because I'm THAT guy. The one everyone dumps their stuff onto and asks for advice... Okay. Fine. I'm good to help. Let's do this.
---
So over the course of a few weeks, I talk to her, give her my viewpoint, ask her for honesty about what's going on, and things seem to improve. We talk, we flirt a bit, due to the intimate nature of the conversations, but it never steps really out of bounds. I mean, both of us could get pretty graphic, but we knew the lines that would not be crossed.
---
So I'm talking to her one day and she's commenting to me about being intimate with her husband in the shower.
---
Her: Yadda yadda shower. Hard to do...
---
Me: Sure, of course, it is amazing to do if you can manage it though.
---
Her: Yadda yadda shower. He doesn't seem to have the motivation.
---
Me: Well, I mean that's understandable. Maybe you have to take charge about the situation and show him YOU really want him in that way.
---
Her: Yadda yadda shower. Well but where's MY motivation come from? I do want him, but he doesn't show me!
---
Husband: Hey bud! How's it going! I'm about to go do some dailies, care to join me?
---
Me... USING THE /R FUNCTION INSTEAD OF TYPING HER NAME OUT.... TO HER HUSBAND: I won't lie. I'm REALLY horny thinking about him getting down and dirty with you in the shower. &lt;Note: This was REALLY tame compared to what I REALLY said.&gt;
---
Me seeing that I /R'd to HIM, and not HER: OH MY FREAKING GOD! I AM SO SORRY! I AM SO SORRY!
---
Him: Uhhhhh………..
---
Me to her: YOU AREN'T GOING TO BELIEVE WHAT JUST HAPPENED! I AM SO FREAKING SORRY!
---
Her: What are you talking abo.... oh. &lt;Apparently voices in her real world began speaking&gt;
---
Me to him: THAT WAS SO NOT WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE! WE WERE JUST FLIRTING I SWEAR! &lt;And we were. Honest. It never went past that.&gt;
---
And then... I noped the fuck out and died in my head. I logged off. Didn't play for a solid week.
---
PSA: Don't use the freaking /R function kids. Take 2 seconds and type the names of people you send IMPORTANT tells to!
---
Her: Yadda yadda shower. Hard to do... 
---
Me: Sure, of course, it is amazing to do if you can manage it though. 
---
Her: Yadda yadda shower. He doesn't seem to have the motivation. 
---
Me: Well, I mean that's understandable. Maybe you have to take charge about the situation and show him YOU really want him in that way.

Strongly recommend engineering for your paladin. Engineering is great support for every paladin spec, and as an insanely mana efficient healer you're less dependent on consumables than the other healers so alchemy has less value. 
---
There's minimal value to you to go armorsmithing, it's far and away the most popular specialization, so unless you're an officer of a server-leading guild, you won't be making money there. If you're really bent on blacksmithing you could spec hammer or sword, one of the more rare ones and maybe make money down the line when their epic-plans become available, but you wouldn't gain much from it personally...
---
Well for starters, you have to play with the French. 
---
Dwarf Bard, now that's a class
---
Ya fuck them if there is no room for you! It’s their fault that parties can only have 5 people!
---
I'd argue it's even harder to get invited to a 5man as a druid healer, than it is to a raid. Mainly because you don't have a res, so people will not invite you unless they have a hybrid doing DPS.
---
Same boat as you. 
---
I will make: 
---
Paladin with mining + engi - spec: 21-0-30
---
Hunter with mining + engi spec: MM
---
I've said this before here and it didn't go down too well, but the amount of blatant sexism, racism, homophobia (really just bigotry in general) from the Americans on pservers definitely ruins the gaming experience somewhat. Like I'll be questing somewhere and the general chat will just be full of people being straight up racist, and anyone who calls them out is just labeled a special snowflake or SJW
---
Cuergo’s Gold was way worse than robot chicken.
---
Puzzle your way through a treasure map with cryptic clues, claw your way through 50 elites, all to find...a bottle of rum worth 2 silver.
---
Fuck you, Blizz.
---
I still group up for them, because even though I'm a Druid it's a less frustrating process when everyone just works together and allows it to be 'fair'.
---
Interesting 33/0/18. Just curious, why not take 5/5 tidal mastery in resto? Maybe lose 2 points in reverberation?
---
Pretty sure rogue is not a fast paced leveler. Decent single target kill speed, sure, but no movement speed buffs (except one on a 5 min cooldown), and they have to face tank mobs with out much mitigation or any self healing, so they have significant recovery time.
---
What's wrong with the French?
---
Do you want the true vanilla experience or not!?! Take your 400+ ping and be happy! /s
---
Just, uh, use that auto-attack and hope they're not paying attention?
---
I find it really weird when people choose their class or race based on like the first 10 levels. I've seen loads of people say they're playing for example a dwarf because they want to relive Dun Morogh, or would never play Tauren because they hate Mulgore. This part of the game is over so quickly, and it will make no difference after the first few hours of playing. Also, if you really want to play in Dun Morogh you can just run there or make an alt
---
When I recently played on a popular private server, I ran into Hunters and some others fighting hard quest mobs solo for kill x/15 quests (especially in Wetlands). I asked in chat why and their reasoning was because even though there was an XP boost, if they solo'd the whole quest they'd get more grinding XP.
---
I thought that was pretty selfish so whenever I encountered one I'd follow them around and Moonfire all of their mobs.
---
Can you share any link of the shaman build? Thanks
---
Paladin or shaman is probably as close to a monk as you will get. Nothing really channels heals like a monk in classic. But paladins and shaman kind of have the whole melee healer thing going for them, but not remotely like monks. Paladins have bubbles (cocoon), idk. Nothing's really similar to a monk.
---
They never said it would be summertime Northern hemisphere...
---
That being said, Warlocks are quite slow when running around. The instant-cast DoTs take some time for the first tick
---
what even *is* armor?
---
Y’all are going to be in for a rude awakening.
---
I'd totally be down for that. Now imagine a remodeled Caverns of Time that you can actually visit in Classic (as opposed to it having a gate) and it's just a best-of of all the expansions to come with all kinds of models being thrown together.
---
That'd be strangely fitting. 
---
Calm down!
---
hunter probably will benefit more from engineering than paladin. also one miner should be enough. So engineering/mining would go to hunter. 
---
I am struggling with paladin. People says that BS will not benefit much, same with tailoring or skining.  
---
Whats left is  Enchanting, lw, engineering, herballsim and  alchemy.
---
Paladin is too slow farmer for enchanting, so thats out.
---
Lw not useful, because everyone will take it to make money on the side. lowe prices in AH, its out.
---
Engineering could be good if  doing pvp, but if im healing in pvp then engineering will not help much. For ret build it could be more useful.
---
Herballsim and alchemy would be useful from 1-60 and beyond. Make money or pots for alts or main.
---
TLDR; Im thinking minig/engineering for hunter and herballism/alchemy for paladin
---
Short-sightedness.  
---
I don't think you read that right there champ. Take another look.
---
&gt; Dwarf is objectively better for all purposes at all stages of the game.
---
Except it isn't. Totalitarian statements like this aren't helpful and show a peculiar stubbornness. Shadowmeld is objectively more useful than Stoneform in certain situations, and Stoneform is objectively more useful than Shadowmeld in others. You could argue that Stoneform is *overall* more useful, but it's not 'objectively'.
---
No ones heard of multiboxing before. Your brother must be a genius!
---
Engineering is useful for all Paladin specs
---
I don’t think there’s such a thing as anxiety complex so 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Classic will also be behind a paywall so it’s possible that will filter out some of them.
---
No charge as resto.
---
Now do the orc version
---
Those mob quests have been Hunter grinds since forever. They respawn pretty quick, and most people skip most of those wetland elite quests.
---
You basically called him selfish for doing exactly what solo classes that can farm do, farm tough mobs.
---
And then like an asshole you follow him around and tagged all his mobs. Nice one.
---
&gt; no way to deal with multiple mobs
---
after level 30 you should pull multiple moobs all the time you have sweeping strikes up
---
Just some Euro banter. 
---
Also single not-guaranteed items. Basically anytime the item is unique/one-of-a-kind  
---
Although that is true, but hordes doesnt have to do jailbreak...
---
Affect the world first race? Hardly. Has Europe lost the world first race since vanilla? Because I don't think so.
---
I  got a warning for my 19 PvP thinks names and had to change them, they are German 
---
Mage named Paxifixsie 
---
And a paladin called Banalritter
---
So I can tell you when someone reports you you have to change names even if they 
---
Are not directly forbidden.
---
Dude, I rolled a druid back in 2005.  I offtanked all the way from zg to naxx, took me like 7 months to level as I level capped along the way to get the honour gear and Tanking gear I'd need at 60.
---
That said, I also had a healing set and a feral dps set.   As feral DPS, I'd beat the mediocre warriors and rogues, but I'd never beat the top guys especially once they started getting into tier 3.
---
At the end of the day, if you have the gear, have the consumables, know what you are doing and put in the effort, it's doable and yes it can be expensive, but that all depends on if you are min/maxing for every encounter.   Personally, I'd recommend you suck it up and spend the 50g everytime on progression.
---
Plus there's alot of theory crafting that's been done the past 12 years.   Like I did the know that power shifting wasn't public knowledge etc 
---
Ltdr:.  If you put in the time and effort to get the gear and consumables, and actually know what you are doing, you can raid as a feral Druid.   But you will have to heal sometimes.  Really no way around that unless you want to sit out the fight sometimes.
---
rogue is kinda slow tbh
---
I'm honestly concerned that Classic is going to full of people like this: those that played a private sever, and don't know the intricacies of how the original game actually worked. 
---
And I get it, games and metas evolve, and it's good to have new players come in. But it's not gold when they think they know more about how the game works. 
---
The amount of time I've been "corrected" on this sub is upsetting. I played from vanilla launch to WoTLK. And I have people telling me my legit experiences are wrong or didn't happen. 
---
 I'm really afraid this is going to bleed into the game, and there's going to be a disconnect between those searching for nostalgia and those coming from private servers thinking they're gonna min/max based on broken knowledge. 
---
I prefer the current weapon approach. The further behind in your weapon skill you are, the more likely your skill is to improve. Instead of struggling to keep all your skills maxed out and grinding for hours each level, you can wait until you get a new weapon and switch. In a few minutes, you'll gain 100 weapon skill that would have taken hours at the appropriate level. The downside is that if you pick up a new upgrade mid-dungeon you can't use it immediately.
---
Except on these servers there are like 50 people in the area all fighting for the same mobs and he's tagging them from groups of people like the one I was in.
---
So yes I still consider him/her selfish when they're trying to tag mobs from the other 50 players around who are cooperating in groups.
---
I made a lot of friends lower level than me just by helping out newer players. All that did was cause me to reroll a new main and never do that again for fear of the constant /w spam asking for boosts or gold
---
Just
---
I said potentially, if you have actively followed the world first race you'd know limit would have won in Uldir if they hadn't extended, and for smaller tiers like the upcoming crucible of storms it absolutely will effect it unless the bosses are ridiculously difficult, even looking at emerald nightmare which was a 24 hour tier for exorsus, NA could have won that and would have had the advantage.
---
Also blood legion got empress shekzeer world first in mop.
---
Just have fun with them 4Head
---
 lol nerds!
---
Are you threatening me? Tank my instance and shut yer trap or I'll let all my buddy mages from the opposite faction kite you all over Azeroth before sacrificing you to our Queen Jaina 
---
Glad that there are French,  Spanish and German servers,  not so fond of gamers from these countries,  bad experience. 
---
Or he's just playing to the style of his class and levelling?
---
If there's like a bunch of grouped up players around then maybe. But he's still just playing his class and grinding. He's elected to grind levels instead of quest. For certain parts of the game (and especially solo classes like hunters) it saves heaps of time over questing.
---
The groups don't have dibs on the mobs over the grinder.
---
If player X tags a mob (lets say it is a 100% drop rate like a hogger paw) and then another player, player Z invites player X before the hogger has been killed but after it has been tagged both players will be able to loot the paw.
---
The 2 current vanilla servers both work this way, can anyone confirm the functionality was the same in vanilla? I suspect not but not sure. 
---
They wont show it for obvious reason. Players would not balance it out but instead pick realm they have more players on their faction. This would lead into faction unbalance on day 1
---
The reason for the difference between sunder and expose usually comes from threat generation.  While im not entirely sure i remember this correctly with Expose up Sunder did nothing for the tank. No effect obviously and worst of all no threat. My knowledge only extends to what i think i remember playing vanilla as i havent played any p-Servers. But it was one of the main reasons we never saw expose until sunder was kinda updated to allow threat even when another Melee armor effect was up.
---
That may be different now with better threat gen from p-server testing but just how i remember it.
---
I'll be playing on a EU realm as an American because of my work schedule. Anyone have any experience playing on an "across the pond" server especially regarding ping? 
---
Hmm, maybe I should make a damage meter addon that inflates Warlock damage to make them feel better about themselves.
---
How is that related to my comment? This is a discussion about armor, not threat.
---
No matter how it works, you can just apply imp expose armor whenever the tank doesnt need the extra threat.
---
Like hell am i gonna waste my mana buffing you scrubs
---
I am still a huntard.  Well, my vanilla main was never a hunter, but I have one I level to 35 now for alchemy.  I forget he has traps, I mismanage my pets, I melee in Aspect of the Cheetah, I basically only use pet + 3 shots and I STILL FEEL OVERPOWERED.   Bear goes in, I do some sting + arcane shot + multishot (when arcane shot is on cd) and Bear (Growl, Bite, Claw) never loses aggro,  and mobs die just as fast as with any other class I played. Or faster.  
---
The only weak point is bag space
---
Was there a function that allowed you to share a quest you're all ready on, or would doing something with a partner only count for both of you separately picked up the quest? I'm gonna assume the latter, but thought I'd ask anyway.
---
&gt; I'm hoping this shifts the meta to be less melee heavy, I remember casters being more favored back in the day but part of that could just be due to warriors being horrible at dealing damage prior to AQ so there weren't as many of them.
---
Lets keep in mind that what wars were doing in the game at the launch. 2h Fury had just been nerfed into the ground and MS was a viable spec for PvP at any gear level. Most people actually raided as MS simply because Sword spec and gear levels and overall lack luster damage until later in Fury Life. BWL did see a few but by time the writing was on the wall for classes power later in the launch it was already geared on another class.
---
Now we get to look at hindsight and see exactly how powerful any given class is and play that spec from day 1. 
---
Private servers are full of Europeans. They're toxic in every game. 
---
My lvl 30 dwarf hunter actually looks a lot like the left picture. He will stay at lvl 35 though, I only made him to get alchemy 300. 
---
This is just flat out not true. For most classes questing in a group of 2-3 makes things so much smoother and safer. I am rolling with my Friend. Shaman/Warrior combo. I can literally charge everything and not stop. He drops totems. AUTOS heals us. We have zero downtime. There is no way either of us would lvl as fast solo. Its just not feasible given the mob density in Vanilla and how regen worked. Maybe if your a mage m, Warlock, or Hunter solo can be fast. But for the other classes you can really optimize with one to two others. 
---
This allows you to bind the autocast trigger on your keyboard instead of having to click it with your mouse.
---
You can get fucked it's like 50%+ Mana. For you to gain weapon skills vaguely faster? No thanks. Go buy some int gear off AH if you care.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hgczAcMqZZxoez0xo
---
I'll spend half my Mana so that you can enjoy that vague attempt to level weapon skill. Lmao no
---
the idea that you need aq gear for ele is pretty stupid. t2.5 is decent stuff, but won't be a big upgrade, if any, because there is also good gear available much earlier. its still bis for healing, but that wasn't really his point.
---
also t1 and t2 are both pretty good sets. 8/8 t1 is awesome for healing and t2 as well. t2 even has some very good ele stuff.
---
I remember people being very laid back. But now in the age of information I think people will expect you to know more than they did back then. 
---
Which debuffs don't stack?
---
We all know expose armor and sunder does not. It doesn't on any private server either.
---
Faerie fire and sunder/expose most certainly stacks though, you can see it in the very screenshot that top guilds used it.
---
I remember not taking bad specs back in the day. Most 5 man groups aren't going to want a meme spec unless they are desperate and have been looking for awhile.
---
I'm sorry, but how is this video related to classic wow?
---
Indeed. I would do something like this, personally. It takes slightly longer to get WC stacked but you still have all the juicy PVP stuff along with some Mana efficiency.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#of0y0obZZVAG0oftco
---
Because NONE, not ANYONE has said ANYTHING about armor debuffs not being addictive. Please link me something on JUST ONE person talking about armor debuffs being multiplicative .
---
Also where the fuck do you get 4800 from? Tips out again? Sunder and expose armor has never stacked on vanilla or private server.
---
They are French
---
Just to give my channel a heads up because all other videos will be related to resto shamans and classic wow 
---
No I am speaking AVERAGE dps. So you include ALL the mages.
---
Besides there's no such thing as "ignite mage" when you look at an entire raid clear, it's random who gets the ignite.

Here are the best 4 clears of AQ on ND, I took the best guilds/clears because it is important that everyone minmaxes which you will see in a tryhard/fast guild. Look at the meters, the mages are consistently 50 dps above warlocks.
---
My take on fishing:
---
1. Don't do it.   
---
2. Vendor any fishing rod you ever see.  
---
raids: mage. my guild brings 1-2 druid only, with 3-8 mages. 
---
there is less people rolling druid vs mage, but not as much as those numbers.
---
neither one is really great for getting raid spots, but the mage will be easier usually.
---
dungeons: druid. if you play tank or flex. arguably the best 5 man tank. you can tank while getting prebis for healing.
---
if you play healer, druid is the worst 5 man healer and there may or may not be a shortage of healers. if you play with good players (such as a strong raid guild) it's no problem. if you pug most likely wipe and it sucks (no res).
---
if you play dps druid is pretty far down on that list, while mage is the most wanted dps in 5 mans.
---
tl;dr 5 man - druid, 40 man - mage
---
love
---
Well lots of people get things wrong about vanilla. Which is unsurprising because it's 13 years ago AND the game changed a lot during vanilla. Remember negative resists? Talent tree changes? Paladins only having 5 minute buffs until AQ? You couldn't even check how an item would look on you until like 1.5 or so nearly a year after release. 
---
So I don't really listen to people who played back then, I base my knowledge on posts from actual vanilla and private servers since they usually get things pretty close. If something changes during Classic I'll just have to adapt and overcome. 
---
You can share quests but not the progression. Also your friend needs to fulfill the requierments 
---
Thanks buddy
---
You just /who one faction, then /who the other and then decide if this server fits your needs.
---
Unfortunately the kinds of people who need to watch such a video, won't.
---
Exactly. Today on the BB boat on a ps it was ”type 1 if you hate noodles”. I’m not a f***ing beta cuck sjw etc. for calling that out IMHO. Cancer begs to differ
---
People sleep on wisp form but getting back into the fight in Wpvp faster is a very nice advantage.
---
Not taking Frostbite when leveling as single target Frost will really gimp you. I don't want to know what kind of person recommended skipping it.
---
The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
---
I could solo grind too, but I want a community in the game I play, and I'll team up when it's beneficial for most. If you want to fight against the grain and consider yourself more important than the 4 other people beside you by tagging all their mobs, then fuck that.
---
Yes, non-country specific EU server for the win. Will avidly avoid danish/sweedish guilds, any nationality really. I prefer english speaking Europeans from all countried (plus Russia if they can have internet there;) )
---
Arms Warrior, Shadow priest and feral/resto druid.
---
On the pserver I’m on right now, everyone is really chill. Nobody gives a flying fuck if you’ve specced frostbite in leveling dungeons, I promise you that.
---
Pservers are supposedly full of hardcore players on there who are assholes about this stuff, and I’m sure they’re out there, but mostly everyone is cool, will accept random group invites when questing, doesn’t get salty and point fingers when we wipe, etc.
---
We don't have any info on servers.
---
You're saying the people that DID play the game at the time, who experienced all those little changes and events, know less about the people who are looking at it through the lens of a private server?
---
I mean I get it, we can go back and look at patch notes. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about people basing their game knowledge off of the meta of private servers, which were NOT accurate representations of Vanilla WoW. They were made with guess work, and not the true core code. Meaning you can't expect them to feel and work exactly as Vanilla did. 
---
For example, private servers have increased respawn rates. This made AOE farming for mages a lot easier. It existed in Vanilla but was very difficult and not a major leveling strategy for the mainstream. 
---
So basing your expectations of how a mage will play based on private server information is incorrect. 
---
It will get removed very soon by the submission 😊 Good luck
---
e4: weapon not a big deal? getting that lok will be the single best upgrade you will have for your ele shaman.
---
honestly, pretty much everything hes writing is off.
---
I played on pservers and didn't care. Nor did anyone i met before started raiding AQ.
---
I only started reading wow forums and reddit after classic announcemet. It looke to me like discussions here make people think that 50% of players are diehard min/maxers who will play not for fun but for being efficient.
---
The truth is, that most people don't care and they are also the ones who don't bother with various forum discussions on "the best mage levelling build" etc. So expect in-game situation to be more relaxed than what you see on the internet discussions.
---
This video needs to be pinned to the sidebar :)
---
How does the raid lockout/timer system work in Classic?
---
Ok so a Hunter going around tagging all mobs as they spawn instantly from the other dozen players in the area is totally fair and not a dick move just because they are a solo class? Fuck that noise, it's a community, there are compromises to be made and you're not more important than the other players around you.
---
Oh well 
---
Wait for TWO sunders, then start DPS slowly. And I mean F U C K I N G slow. Now throw dots.
---
except its completely changed and is not vanilla anymore, not even the 1.12 one.
---
Get out of here with that RP and 'honor' fighting. I want my fucking honor points. I don't want to sit in a queue of people, waiting for you to corpse run back, so you can get killed again. 
---
The problem is when you find a place like this or the WoW forums or even private servers, you are usually finding the most dedicated people to the cause or product. There will for certain be the same spread of guilds for people to join that there were in Classic. From Newbie guilds to Hardcore.
---
Interacting with fanatics can and probably will skew that outlook especially with how much emphasis private servers put on things like Spec and consumables. People still were able to go through WoW wearing Tier gear and in most cases carrying 10-20 other players though raids on specs like MS/Prot, Dark Pact Locks and some other strange tri spec builds.
---
profits from Enchanting, that's a good one! :D
---
Spamming /tar /fire blast macro as a Mage and watching people tilt is even better. 
---
That's a different argument all together. I'm not trying to say that's the proper and correct way to play the game. 
---
I'm just trying to highlight the disconnect between those that played the original game, and those that are coming from private servers. 
---
I'm worried it'll be bad on both ends, and I think you did a good job pointing that out. You're gonna get veterans(like me) who expect the game to be played one way. And you're gonna have new and private server players who expect it to be another way. 
---
It'll be interesting to see how the community can come together, and I think as a veteran we need to have realistic expectations. Of course it won't be our childhood over again. 
---
&gt; Perhaps I'll need to find a more casual, laid-back guild. 
---
This. If you feel a certain way, there's a good chance that in thousands of people, you'll find others just like you. Focus on those. 
---
And for the rest, politely agree to disagree and move on your separate ways. There won't ever be a uniform culture and mindset, so peaceful coexistence sometimes simply requires separation. And that's okay. 
---
You should not generalize classic community as a single thing when it comes to questions like this. 
---
You have the freedom of choice and you can play the game the way you like, but certain decisions are likely to bring respective consequences. Some guilds and people will share your views and the others will not. 
---
Is Naxx even out on this server? T3 is where Warlocks finally start to get the hit they need to compete. Especially true at 6/8 T3 when Warlocks finally receive some built in threat reduction.
---
Sure, that means you're waiting until extreme endgame... But Locks do EVENTUALLY catch up.
---
LOL fuck that
---
Thrash Blade. lvl 50 quest reward that's better than tons of 1handers available in later instances due to possibly overly high proc rate.
---
You can play however you want man, but you have to understand that this game is ~14 years old. For the most part, all of the testing and theory crafting has been done. The knowledge is out there so there isn't really an excuse for not taking the time to learn from others and optimize your playstyle. 
---
People are going to expect new players to take a couple minutes and read a guide on how to play their class before making all of the mistakes that we made back in '05. 
---
Unfortunately, we can't go back and manufacture ignorance but that being said, I'm sure there will be plenty of new people playing melee hunters and trying to tank as a ret paly. It'll never be like vanilla but it'll definitely be closer than any pserver.
---
Don;t worry

The reason pservers ban them, is because on private servers ITS FREE to make as many accounts as you want, so infinite MORE people try it out.  (And even then not many like it enough to specialize in it)   But enough to raise concerns about the economic impact of multiboxing, so they ban it since that is the easiest solution.  
---
If every account costs 15,- a month, really only a handful of fanatics will do it.  It won't be a problem.
---
I did play in Vanilla, but that doesn't mean I was an expert at the time to know the intricacies.
---
I probably didn't put enough in my original post, but if anyone had played on any of those 'popular' private servers with a ridiculous amount of people online, you knew that showing up to those kill quest zones had dozens and dozens of players fighting, arguing and insta tagging every mob that pops up.
---
My view is just that if you want to have a community and share a world with other people there are compromises to be made. In my example maybe I got carried away but I was in a group with 2 or 3 others and there was a hunter beside us attempting to tag all of our mobs, and he wouldn't team up with us, so I gave them a taste of their own medicine.
---
If there were enough mobs for everyone I wouldn't give the slightest care in the world if someone wanted to solo them, but that's not going to be the case anywhere near launch which is what most players are going to experience.
---
So now we're talking NAXX end game. I replied to a comment that said AQ.

I've noticed there is an extremely prevalent toxic elitist private server mentality on this subreddit, the official forums, and many class-specific discord channels. These people cannot comprehend why anyone would want to play a non-cookie cutter spec in a casual guild. If you ask for help with your spec, you will be ass-blasted for "being selfish" or "not speccing for what the raid needs" before they even learn about your intentions.
---
I remember I suggested this to a warlock on a pserver recently. I said “there’s not enough mobs here for the both of us so we can get it done faster by grouping.” His response, “but I’m winning.” 
---
I think literally just being in a party makes people feel pressured to use their nonexistent social skills. You can tell how anxious they are to leave whenever you finish the task at hand. 
---
Thats funny
---
that 40 is a typo?   You can't be serious claiming 10 hours a month pay for 40 accounts.  That would mean making $600 in 10 hours or $60 an hour and every unemployed person in the world would start farming gold.  
---
Literally all the tryhard hunters on pservers rate NE as the best race even better than orc.
---
This is a great video, I also watched the alchemy video. Both were very informative and helpful.
---
The dev team also said they are starting with 1.12 as a base. They never said there will be zero changes. Until beta or maybe even release, unless a blue post says otherwise, all bets are off.
---
When monkeys(tips) that barely played vanilla themselves are given a platform to spread misinformation this happens.
---
Saddens me to see the lengths he goes to build his "community", not a single source was given in this video and people are eating it up like hes the holy christ of vanilla information. LMFAO.
---
Judging by the karma discrepancy, you're wrong
---
Mostly from this line:
---
&gt;The only reason expose is used is because it with talents and 5x CP gives 200-300 more reduction than 5x sunders does
---
In a flat discussion about armor i guess its an out of place comment but at times i some times look to the mechanical aspects of the abilities more than just what they are doing to a boss.
---
There is no "community", just thousands and thousands of different people. It's just as bad for them to expect you to minmax to the hilt as is you expecting them to be laid back and understanding. No one should be trying to police the others on "how to play".
---
Just find like minded people and ignore those who don't understand you. :)
---
I'm european and sadly I have to agree. I play Overwatch on US servers because the EU ones are unbearable 
---
Wouldn't be a bad idea, but sadly won't solve the problem. All we can hope for is the greater majority of players act like this, and those who don't will end up finding themselves alone. In the guild I'm making the social aspect is very important and if you are going around being an ass and ninja looting you will be kicked. 
---
I think it's legitimate to point out, we forget things and our memories aren't perfect. We also had a poor understanding of the game at times, you're not wrong. I was young as well. 
---
I think the bigger issue is the disconnect between parties, you're gonna have people like me who want the game to be a nostalgia fest, but you're also gonna have a lot of people who are coming over from their private servers and even new people. 
---
It will be interesting to find a balance between the new and old, and hopefully he elitist can be knocked down a few pegs when they realize there are bigger fish - on both sides of this equation. 
---
Yea these subreddit dwellers think they're gonna get to 60 and raid naxx, and whenever you tell them the truth they throw downvotes at you.
---
The point of the quote is to show that a raid can use improved 5CP expose armor over sunder to increase their physical DPS, as long as there is armor remaining. Naturally this means the tank has to get his threat from other sources, but this is not really an issue since the raid can decide when to use expose, and when not to. 
---
&gt;That's completely illogical to think that linking 5 or 6 comments made in the past few days on a subreddit is going to provide hard evidence of a communities attitude?
---
It’s comical to pretend you’d need a survey when you *can* find that attitude via comments. 
---
There seems to be an overwhelming urge in this subreddit to rage against retail.
---
The inverse of that urge is clearly not present in the retail subreddit. 
---
You can pretend that people raging about something doesn’t indicate an attitude. But that’s all you are doing. Pretending. 
---
Good point. Raids might be more interested in druids, but 5 man's might want mages more. Been looking time since I ran a 5 man &gt;&lt;
---
you can visit the CoT in vanilla, the whole area with the sand and purple pink space sky is there, there is just nothing alive to interact with. 
---
We want true Vanilla, mouse click &amp; KB turning it is. #NoChanges.
---
Yeah, it was always a real struggle trying to get invited to a 5man as a resto druid, when there wasn't anyone else in the party that could res. "I swear no one will die, pinky promise!".
---
When i played the only difference between a good warlock and a average warlock was Curse of Recklessness. Knowing when to use that Curse was important in some cases but overall the other support ones are more used in raiding as the DPS increase isnt that worth it in leveling gear.
---
Everyone keeps saying that, but I'm not sure if it is true.  Some will freak over the smallest differences. Personally I will love every single difference if it means I'm getting a more long-term stable Vanilla experience.  
---
Do people honestly think that after having to RELEVEL my warlock 4 times on different  private servers, I'm going to give a rat's ass if my voidwalker is stunned or dismissed while I summon an imp? Hell no.
---
Curses take a while to be efficient and unless you are doing bosses it probably won't be worth applying. Also you will likely not be able to help more than 1 dps with a curse. cool thing you can do though is use curse of recklessness on mobs to prevent them fleeing and pulling mobs like fx. in stockades. Other than that, dots up and spam bolts.
---
Cool thanks for your input. I'll definitely weigh that response. Is Hand of Edward the Odd pretty accessible or obtainable outside the AH or is it so rare you'll probably have to buy it?
---
If you are in the middle of farming, sure.  But if you're running for 20 minutes across 3 zones, why not buff em as they pass.
---
Deep Ocean, Vast Sea is the correct answer
---
Expose has always been better overall in terms of armor reduction i wont disagree. But like i said i just look at it holistically. With Expose Sunder does no threat which isnt a problem if the threat is enough or you have the rage to get it from other places and keep up with it. to this discussion it was merly an interjection point which probably didnt need to be made but just one i threw out there 
---
And when 5 man's were important still most people were bad enough that someone would die just because they were awful or the tank was awful.
---
When vanilla was live, there were tons of detailed stat websites, tools, and aggregators collecting billions of data points; millions of players, hundreds of thousands of raiders, and thousands of skilled analysts pouring over the stats to try to figure out exactly how the game work. These people came up with formulas and these formulas were rigorously tested in game. The formula for weapon skill was very well established even in 2005. In MC and BWL, I ran edgemaster's handguards over the tier 2 bracers as a maintank in order to get over that +5 skill breakpoint and build more threat.
---
There are some things that are probably wrong about private servers, like exact mob HP and run speed (especially the low level mobs nobody cares about), etc. and certainly a bunch of bugs that were in vanilla weren't replicated on private servers, but I have no idea how people loudly assert that all the theorycrafters from 2004-2006 were "completely wrong" about how damage works.
---
The quest reward is BoE though which is something. The difficulty of acquisition means people will pay big money to get someone else to do the work.
---
There will be plenty of people with your attitude and if you really want to keep that mentality then you can go form a 40 man raid with those guys and jerk each other off with your wasted talent points while wiping to the first golem pack in MC. 
---
'Ignite Mage' doesn't exist, it's random who gets it. On top of that, literlally go on Legacyplayers and see for yourself - in AQ40 or Naxxramas (With the few guilds clearing it), mages are still ahead of Warlocks on average.
---
unless you're super lucky you will have to buy it. remember, a proc into astral recall is the sickest shit!
---
If you go on legacy players all the toplocks are averaging ~750 dps. The top mage parses are doing 850 dps but if you pull open the logs you'll see the reason they're doing so much is because they held ignite for the entire encounter and all the other mages in their raid had damage far below the warlocks for that fight. If you took the damage contribution of ignite for that 850 dps and evenly divided the damage properly instead of collectively adding it all to one mage you'd see the peak of Fire Mage dps is below 750.
---
In dungeons, curses will only be worth the mana/GCD on bosses. The exception would be Recklessness, which is the only way we have to control a feared mob (or humanoid mob that runs away at low health, think it worked on that as well).
---
Got it at 45 on my Warrior and used it all the way to 60.  The rage you can generate from a proc is so hard to let go of when you finally do upgrade it.
---
Man orcs are the original WLs. Nothing more badass than a orc WL.
---
And thats just fine, as we established earlier. It is however troublesome to look at the game 'holistically' when it opens the largest gate anyone has ever seen for a plethora of strawmen. In my experience it is far better to keep it simple and discuss whether A+X= B or C. 
---
If we go by the sources linked previously, the raiders wont even need expose to reduce the bosses' armor to 0. 
---
&gt;What's the Cyberpunk 2077 release date? No official release date but late 2019 seems possible

---
SL/SL locks was a fucking pain as a rogue in tbc.
---
They take less gear to be effective of course your average bad player will perform better on a fire mage I'm talking the tryhard locks with the hard to get drops beat out mage in the longterm and that's why it's better to invest your gear in them.
---
Thanks!
---
Agreed, as long as you are willing to flex it up as a druid, you will have a relatively easy time with getting dungeon groups, especially UBRS. However, the one time you might have difficulty is trying to get into a 5man that needs a healer when they don't have any other classes that can res.
---
Thanks man!
---
Recklessness it is! Thanks!
---
When I needed to grind weopon skills I would just equip some trash and run some lowbies through a low lvl dungeon.
---
Fair enough.
---
If you want the best profession, go engineering.  It gives u more dps, a ranged attack, helps with pvp and raiding, and a teleporter.  Engineering wont make u gold but thats why you have an alt.  Alch and herb is second tier, but its still really good for money and raiding.  Im going mining and herb in the beginning, and then switching to engi/herbs when i have enough mining mats to last me for a while.  Im going with a mage alt for utility and goldfarming.  With the pally, i can heal, terrible dps, and do some 5man tanking.  The mage will be for dps, utility, and goldfarming.  Mage alt profession will be an alchemist.
---
Fully agree. Emphasis on the **World** of Warcraft.
---
When you are progressing the game at a slower pace you come to appreciate the sights and sounds more.  You not only hear, but you listen to the ambient noises around you.  The world feels alive.  It mixes with the gorgeous soundtrack perfectly and you are immersed.  Everything you are doing feels earned, rewarded.  You feel like an adventurer who makes their own worth.
---
Immolate toook a debuff slot, making it not really used for raiding. Searing pain created lots of threat, so can't really use that either. The only other fire spell is conflagration, which requires Immolate.
---
Otherwise, for spamming shadow bolt you'd be missing a 10 percent damage buff from going into affliction, or 15 from going into demo.
---
And even for PvP. Being sm/ruin (going into aff) basically let's you both Pve and PvP effectively with the same one spec. 
---
Dude, how many times can you possibly repost different screenshots of the same pretty “meh” drawing? This is insane
---
Zangermarsh is the best zone ever created though, well most beautiful anyway imo
---
No, but this has been a point of contention on the French realm forums.
---
Yeah knew nothing was remotely the "same" but for vanilla healers that played a monk in retail if they had any thoughts on which vanilla healers be as "interesting". By interesting I mean skill ceiling and variety in spells...not just various ranks of one spell 90% of the time.
---
Speaking of dumb questions. Do shamans have to click the ground and place the totem or does it just appear? Watching a couple videos referencing the consistent placing of totems makes me think they auto appear around me? One thing I've always hated is a class that has to click the ground for a spell (shrooms on druids at one point in retail)
---
Thanks for uploading my video!
---
Yeah, I mark warlock/hunter, then mark and thorns the pet.
---
True vanilla endgame is fishing for eels and squids.
---
Sounds like grouping would've slowed him down unless it was just for slain mobs, also can argue he gains more exp.
---
There's many guilds just like that forming!
---
I suggest writing in the weekly LFG thread or going to the WoW classic guild discord. I'm sure someone can link it to you, I'm on mobile.
---
May the Earthmother smile upon you!
---
Well, I remember most of TBC players being toxic elitist, and if you were not playing meta spec, you woudn't get into dungeons. I don't mean herocs, I'm talking about usual normal dungeons. I guess you were really lucky with your friends.
---
Then show me one source from back then that talks about that magical 5 weapon skill breakpoint.
---
Thats awesome.  Thanks.  I shall check it out.  I hope someone can link me the discord.
---
Can you link the logs of these tryhard Warlock players, who's consistently beating mages? I see Craghack have linked logs which prove otherwise. But maybe you can find it.
---
They're pronounced "Whorelocks" - a Mage
---
Just don't group
---
I see a lot of people constantly getting things wrong because they played the game 13 years ago. Like warlocks having to farm soulshards for the raid, that very rarely happens now. Shadowpriests being completely unviable, also false, same with feral druids. There's so much misinformation because people think they know how a game plays today even though they haven't touched it in over a decade. 
---
Meanwhile I get bitched at because I didn't play the game back then, but I've read just about every post on elitistjerks, Alakazam, Thottbot etc as well as actually playing the game for 3 years on private servers. If I discuss spell resistances I link to EJ posts, but these retards just talk out of their arses just because they played the game 13 years ago. 
---
Many quests are shareable, but a lot of them arent. Generally, almost any quest where the quest giver gives you a quest item cant be shared (since sharing quests wont generate required item) and theres just a lot of random quests that simply arent shareable for reasons not explained, but presumably its that going to the quest giver is considered part of the quest itself.
---
Second this. So well put. Don't mind the min-maxers let them do what they want and if they start to tell you what you can and can't do, block them. Together we can expel this elitism to the fringes where it belongs.
---
Another PSA to Hunters: put your pet on passive before it pulls the entire dungeon.
---
She's also present in the Classic announcement video.
---
My comment implies that not grouping slowed him down, does it not?
---
100% agreed. 1/3 of a server is rogues and warriors. I'm not buffing every other player I see for half my mana pool or more while leveling. Especially at the levels close to a new rank of water due to still using the previous tier.
---
If you see me at level 34 wanting AI? Sorry bro, unless I'm walking half a zone for a turn-in, it's not happening. Gonna take me 20-25 seconds just to drink to full after a single buff. That's not so bad once, but "every warrior and rogue"? BIG pass.
---
I learned how to tank on pservers and only dealt with assholes once or twice ever. A bunch of these idiots make assumptions about pservers that they have no experience with
---
&gt;neither one is really great for getting raid spots, but the mage will be easier usually.
---
What classes are? Only warrior tanks and priest healers?
---
I just did. I maintanked BWL and MC and I used Edgemaster's Handguards.
---
Level a char to 30. After that it starts all being the same anyways tbh
---
You get half exp and if it's a droprate quest you're on average spending twice the amount of time in the quest, and that's for just 2 people. With three people the exp is diminished even more so you'll get less than a third of what you'd get solo, ect for more group members. Then you need to take into account waiting for respawns. 
---
Also if I'm in a group and we happen to kill mobs independently from one another, I'm not able to loot each one I kill. Not a huge deal but annoying to switch between free for all and the default, especially when you're not group leader.
---
It isn't that big of a deal, it also makes the chillest style of aoe impossible so that's why I'm skipping it while I level.
---
TBF pserver doesnt necessarily mean anything. These things can be wrong. I just read a post yesterday where it was stated pservers might be using higher armor values on bosses. 
---
Like I said, basically everything is speculation until release.
---
Why is Sylvanas their logo? 
---
Tailoring is the only viable one unless you are simply use it for dusting if you are the one to be doing stealth/solo runs.
---
If it’s just for dusting then just pick any other gathering profession.
---
Auto appear, although I've never played healers I'm pretty certain the shaman class goes far higher in terms of a skill cap compared to paladins
---
Do you have 50 gold?
---
Indeed, which is why you shouldn't rely on private servers as the only source. If anything they prepare you for raiding as it is one of the few areas where it is completely blizzlike (on the good servers anyhow). But still it doesn't tell you how it was doing those raids during vanilla. Few of us raid with sub 30 fps and 200+ ping. We also use addons that didn't exist back then and spells/talents as well. They do prepare you for Classic though, somewhat at least. 
---
You should also not base your information off of someone who happened to play the game 13 years ago. You have to dig deeper than that and I've yet to see a youtuber or blogger or whatever who does that. I only see it on theorycrafting discord servers where people use the wayback machine to look at old EJ posts and forums.
---
That's how you do it. 
---
Positively surprised by the humor in this video, nice job!
---
Wish the scene cut sounds didn't sound like someone blowing into their microphone though... ;)
---
Great guide, but I'd just add some etiquette about the LFG/Pre-Dungeon aspect of vanilla:
---
* Always grab your dungeon quests *before* getting into a group for that dungeon. It sucks to have the last person join the group and go "I'll be right there, just need to grab the quests", especially since a lot of those are scaterred throughout the world.
---
* If the Dungeon is deep into contested or enemy terrioty, it's best to group up at the closest FP and go as a group.
---
* Sometimes (a lot of times...) the LFG stage can take up to an hour or more. While it's okay to do something prodcutive while you wait for more members, don't venture to the other side of the fucking world, and don't engage in something that you can't just immediately stop to go the dungeon.
---
Pure motivation to become a porn star and having daddy issues?
---
Look in the mirror and ask yourself is it more important to have fun or be an asshole?
---
They weren’t concerned with accurately representing the game, they just needed to know enough to make fun of it 
---
Not all pserver players are toxic. I min/max on pservers but I don’t care what others do. I actually like teaching new rogues if they want to know how to be better but I don’t care how they play in the end. Don’t let a few pserver bad apples make you group us all into one and label us all as elitist.
---
Lol, imagine telling other people how to behave in a video game. 😂 
---
I'm not saying you shouldn't use Edgemaster's to tank. But your memory after 12 years doesn't mean anything. Show me that detailed research.
---
They do mean something however they shouldn't be used as the only source. The biggest changes we'll see from private servers is probably pathing, some small adjustments on boss values and addons might have to be completely reworked. Also the procs on some items like Ironfoe is very hard to find a good source on. 
---
I seem to recall that being the behavior. But human memory isn’t perfect and it’s been a long time so /shrug?
---
I feel like people who hate on pserver players never played on pservers and have no idea what it’s really like. 
---
Tbc is shit and ruined wow, fuck off
---
We don't know how those debuffs are calculated though. For all we know there could be diminishing returns, sunder could nullify the other two and so on. 
---
What's your issue with my memory? Do you think that I didn't use edgmaster's handguards, or do you think that everyone was wrong back then, too?
---
Cries in warlock
---
People say mages have it easier to get into raids, but in my personal experience as a Druid main that simply isn't true.
---
What most don't take into account is that there most likely will be twice the number of players rolling a Mage over a Druid.
---
If you are comfortable healing getting into a group or raid as Druid is a piece of cake. Keeping in mind that dps spots have a lot more competition.
---
 The no-rez argument simply doesn't hold up in reality because of the scarcity of healers.
---
That being said, I'd still recommend you to play whichever class you think will be most fun.
---
Oh? I thought the Caverns were closed? I only remember standing in front of that gate and gazing and that giant Bronze Dragon when I was like 14 :D 
---
Or do you mean "visit" in the same sense that you can visit Mt Hyjal in Vanilla by glitching through the gate? 
---
I can tell you unequivocally from playing on pservers the last 8 years that everyone saying mage is just flat wrong. 
---
Its the complete opposite very easy for druids to get raid spot okish for mages. You only want 2 active Druids in your guild, but Druids are the least popular class and its always been harder to find healers than DPS. Its very hard to find good consistent druids to recruit. Mages are overly popular, they have a good number of raid spots, so it balances somewhat, but if you dont know anyone, competition for spots is very high.
---
For dungeons, Mages are extremely popular for poly and the fact that melee gear is more competitive and takes longer to farm. So groups with rogues and warriors try hard to find caster DPS to reduce gear competition.
---
Druids in dungeons, if your tanking, youll get groups pretty fast. Healing is kind of average, healers are in decent demand in 5 mans but people always seem to prefer priests
---
So in the end; druid is better for raids, and better or worse in 5mans depending if youre healing or tanking
---
5 points in 3 mobs? Lmao absolutely not. Its common to be 2 or 3 points below cap when you're about to reach a new level and that last level from 299 to 300 could take forever. I remember spending 3 raid lockouts at 299 1h mace skill on my warrior (hitting level 61-63 mobs)
---
I feel like every vanilla healer is **much** more engaging, especially ability-wise and skill ceiling, than a monk is on retail.
---
In private server bullshit servers armor rebuff stacks, one of many broken reasons are godlike on private servers. In retail it did not work like that.
---
same to me i roll shadow priest and have tun :)
---
not sure if i go to raids one day but i think first 6 months i go only 5 man dungeons 
---
i will make damage and only heal if i in hurry to solve a fast quest.
---
shamans can heal i am here for damage ;) and i dont care what people say 
---
i will skill 0/3/48 in shadow 
---
maybe the last real shadow priest on azeroth

Damn that reads like one of those tragic accident stories, Ony is 100% fun mechanics and free loot.

Yeah, it's like some of these people never even knew about ElitistJerks or something?

A lot of shit was figured out back when Vanilla was live and could be confirmed.  Pservers use those same formulas and values that were already derived from the game by people who ACTUALLY played it back then.

Awesome, thanks much!

that mentality you're referring to has nothing to do with pservers. elitist were in vanilla, they are on retail and they are also on pservers. in reality most people are chill and let you do you.

Yes because back then WoW was a RPG. Caster bosses having lower armor makes sense, it would never happen on retail.

yes, but it's much easier than MtHyjal.  In vanilla you could just climb on the mountain on top of the gate (various routes possible) and from there it was a jump down and you would see a large black rectangle  you could just walk straight into and voila you would be inside just behind the 'blocked' gate.

There is a LFG/Recruitment channel there that you might want to check out. Also, the [weekly LFG threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/search?q=flair%3ALFG%2BMonday&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) are a good resource (a new one will be posted tomorrow and every following Monday).

I'm removing this post, though, as we try to limit the spam of LFG/Recruitment posts to the stickied thread, as we get so many of these posts otherwise. Sorry for the inconvenience.

No, BC was fun. WotLK was the expansion that killed wow for us.
---
And it completly goes against 305 weapon skill giving 3% hit because most of those rogues that get 305 weapon skill from talents claim to still need 8% to 9% hit in molten core to not miss specials.

Yes please keep them coming.

Show me some raid logs mate. Show a raidlog with warlocks ahead of mages.

I know this is supposed to be the dwarf on the box art but to me I just see some type of strange anthropomorphic rodent

That’s what confused me as well. I thought that I either didn’t understand, or that the joke referenced someone putting points into improving their blood pact.

Warlocks still have ranged spells though :(

My hunch as well, tho I have to admit choosing from different ranks of the same spell even if it's more engaging doesn't sound as "fun". Maybe it's just in my head and once you start playing you see it as much fun as choosing spell A over spell B today.

Tho I do think the initial version of monks when you balanced chi and mana did have a proper skill ceiling. :)

I'm looking forward to healing in vanilla for whatever reason I only ever did DPS back then. 
---
Leaning towards shaman at the moment. 
---
Yeah I get that. I didn't mention mistakes like trading a bop sword and grinding on grey boars, because those are part of the plot and the episode wouldn't work without them. But how do you let things like human hunter slip? Surely someone at Blizzard could've said "hey guys we actually don't have human hunters, so just say you're a human warrior or rogue". 
---
if you think so

What if the rogue was under the effects of furious howl before the kick?

Tbc killed world pvp with flying mounts, made the game into “world of Outland” taking us away from old Azeroth the greatest designed video game map in history and server transfers destroyed my server. I played hardcore every day retail vanilla and quit 2 weeks into tbc.
---
The main people that love tbc are ones who  got into wow late in vanilla and never fully experienced it. 
---
It's a parody, no one was trying it make it accurate.
---
I wiped my guild (Vanilla Wafers) at Garr because of whales and stuff.

---
They are and I don't disagree with that. They reduce the damage mitigation through glancing blows. But that also doesn't say anything about giving 3% hit.
---
My old guild in vanilla was competing for server and faction first, winning several of them. Compared to private servers these days it would be labeled as a pure casual guild.  To illustrate, we won the Opening of the Gate Race, yet we had trouble to beat BWL within 5 hours for 2 weeks (part of the quest chain is defeating Vaelastrasz and then clearing the raid within 5 hours)  Today they are speedrunning it in 30-40 minutes.  Ok, they skip every trash pack possible, but even if they would kill those they would do it in 60-70 minutes, while we took 300.   (Later we would speed that up a bit, but a 3 hour run was considered fast)   
---
The main tank would use a Flask, but almost never did we use those for dps.  We knew about DM and other world buffs, but those were not a weekly thing, more like a 
---
peculiarity you would use out of curiosity.   
---
The only regular buff we used was the dragonslayer one, but even those you could not turn in all the time, as once somebody put it up, the head stayed on display in the city for 6? 12?  hours  and nobody else could turn that quest in.  So you didn't do it before every evening raid, as chances were somebody else on the server already had done it. 
---
This picture is confusing.. Destro was a fun pvp specc. Imp blood pact was a pve talent, the one warlock in tank group had.
---
Someone explain this picture, and how we can relate to it please
---
You must be fun at parties.
---
All raids were on a reset calendar. MC/bwl/aq40/naxx were once a week. If you killed a boss in the instance you were “saved” to that instance for the week. So your guild could come back days later and continue progression. So early on MC would take two days. ZG and AQ20 were a shorter timer, I believe 4 day save, however I could be wrong on that. 
---
I'm on a pserver and ppl are mostly chill, even when someone screws up in dungeons. The majority seems to be polite and educational.

LMAO no lies detected

You would think so but most people never even pay attention to who got it. “Did I get it? No? Fuck. Give on”

Dwarf priest with FW makes this sound super overpowered to slap this on top.

That’s not hard because Anthem is a fucking joke right now.

Bioware managed to tank a game that’s been in development 7 years, while also simultaneously managing to learn zero lessons from other companies about loot-bases games.

Here we have one ignite mage followed by a warlock almost matching him then another mage and a warlock right below that. If the logs were properly spreading the damage on that encounter those mages at the bottom likely would've had more damage and the mages at the top less

Pro tip: pet in aggressive mode will tag a mob faster than any player (assuming your pet is on "stay" at the spawn location.

This is the one thing I disagree with. If someone needs it and will use it then they should get it. Fuck this AH gold crap
---
Reminder that clickbait titles are cancer.
---
&gt; There's a lot of things that vanilla do that TBC also does or do even better.
---
Definitely agree. 
---
There is also (ok I am prepared for the hate) a lot of things current retail does better.
---
I agree TBC was nice. But it really, objectively, brought some things which were in the opposite direction of Vanilla WoW, especially the flying mounts. 
---
The "other" option, to progress Classic with its custom expansion further in the Vanilla philosophy and avoiding things that were not helpful to that in hindsight, sound much better for me than to move to TBC after Vanilla. That said, economically, it's 99,999% sure Blizzard will go the direction of releasing TBC after Vanilla Classic. 
---
In the LFG era, yeah, because it's not hard to find groups and you never run with the same people again. 
---
That may work at low levels, but if you want to stay close to max 40+, you can only use 1-2 weapons. 
---
It's possible things were chosen for visual reasons. SP team may have wanted things looking a certain way. Of course I have no idea if that's true or not, but I wouldn't be surprised if they picked things for the way they looked on screen, for animation availablity reasons or a whole host of things. It is a TV show and art directors knows what they want. 
---
Or it's just as reasonable to assume it was just completely overlooked and Blizzard didn't notice or care and this was the result. If that's the case, it's hardly as bad as it could have been.
---
I don't think such inaccuracies took away from the episode, but I don't think "fixing" them would have added anything or made it better either.
---
We all would like our hobbies to be accurately represented on television. It's exciting when we see something we're passionate about shown or referenced in a TV show or movie we like. It rarely turns out that way though.
---
I remember thinking "huh, that's weird" when the races and classes didn't match up and I never gave it a second thought until this thread over a decade later. 
---
Out of all the mainstream pop culture WoW references I've seen on television over the years I think SP was the least jarring to watch. Those Big Bang Theory references and that Family Guy one... Ugh. :P
---
Huh, neat. Well, now I have something to explore :D
---
True. It’ll be bittersweet to have all six bars full of totems. 
---
I was merely referring to OPs question of missing out. Can always raid horde settlements to physically see them. No shamans till BC for him doh :&gt;[
---
Thanks for creating such amazing content :)
---
Lol! That's cool. Thanks for the share. 
---
There is absolutely no consensus for that on this subreddit; people are all over the place. I would say that outside of this subreddit, Wotlk is probably considered the best. 
---
Wrath was great, but it started to fall apart towards the end. When TOC launched, the dungeon and heroic allowed a fresh character to go straight into the TOC raid and skip Naxx/Ulduar and all other dungeons. Then when ICC launched, the 3 new dungeons gave gear that similarly could get you straight into the TOC 25 man raids, even easier. ICC also added dungeon finder. It was those catch up mechanics in the last 6 months of the expansion that started the destruction of wow’s community. But the first year and a half of Wotlk were great.
---
Haha, yes it's a nice copy-paste I took from the original wow forums.
---
I’ll buff both you and the pet.  Eventually, you’ll pull 4 mobs.   
---
If you're waiting for a spawn as lock and you know where it spawns, sit your pet on it and set them to aggro. They will attack and tag the mob before it's even visible to other players and in my experience even beats out AoE spells. 
---
Boys will be boys
---
In my understanding if you have completed a quest to pickup the quest you are currently on, you cannot share it.
---
If the quest does not require any 'prequests' or of your party member has completed the 'prequests' up to the current quest you are on, then you can share it.
---
I dont think it has anything to do with having item rewards or anything else unless its 'class specific'
---
I'd venture to say that there will be a larger group of try-hards that will make some small part of the community ultra serious; however, I think that as a whole, the community will be fun and relaxing as most people just want to play an official server of the game that they enjoy. There will be new players that will have a little shock. There will be returning "Vanilla" players that are may or may not have some rose-tinted glasses. There will be returning "Vanilla" try-hards that will be the same as they were 15 years ago.
---
The point is, there will be a bigger mix of people this time as opposed to all new players at the start, but it should not be as bad as you think it will be. There will still be people that just want to have fun playing the game, and I personally think they will outweigh the super try-hards.

Actually, put pet on passive then remove the toggles.  There only reason to not have pet on passive is finding stealthed enemies.  Or extreme laziness while grinding.
---
lol so true. I main tanked molten core with 299 sword skill for a long time!
---
You like these poorly drawn pics?
---
From what I understand, Blizz still had the server side database. This means pservers are irrelevant, because Blizzard has the actual Vanilla data. They dont have to hope or further research if pservers got it right, because they already have the answers. 
---
So no, pservers dont (or shouldnt) mean anything, in terms of getting back to the original data. But we dont know what changes, if any, Blizz is making. They would most certainly start with Vanilla data though, not with pservers. 
---
You just agreed with me. "click" and "right click" are two completely different UI interactions. And you defend this because you want to just click it? I run with a gaming pad and mouse with 12 thumb keys that both support toggle able keycaps, I'm not exactly hard up for places to be key binds.
---
You're obviously an idiot.
---
This was fantastic, loved the Alex Jones robot chicken. I'll be a new subscriber.
---
Blizzard left some tracks regarding the release date. Just saying, be ready for 16th of July
---
I will never forget when our 5-man rando group did the chicken run in tanaris and got jumped by an enemy 60 warrior trying to fuck up our day.
---
Even though we were ~10 levels below him, the 5 of us descended on his ass like a swarm of bees and stellar heals kept us and the chicken alive
---
We eventually took down that raid boss and cashed in the ridiculous XP from that chicken quest 
---
Man, I’m gonna miss 10k+ online in one realm 
---
Loot is calculated on kill so it should work. 
---
Tyvm!
---
Ehh, you underestimate how many people actually like that sort of grindy oldschool style of MMORPG. 
---
OSRS has recently taken over WoW as the most popular (as in concurrent players) MMO atm and that is literally 10 times as grindy as vanilla, and 10 times as "boring", as people like you would call it. 
---
Classic will be fine. It just won't be for everyone, that's ok. In fact, that's the thing that makes it good to begin with. Retail is the living proof of how damaging the "Let's make the game for everyone" -mentality is. It just completely rips the soul out of the game and turns it into a directionless patchwerk of which not even the devs know what they want from it.
---
The issues you pointed out are legit, but TBC also had proper class balance, whereby 2 or 3 specs were viable at endgame instead of 1 or even 0. It's like there were 22 playable classes instead of 12. Improved itemization was a major factor in that. Also, raid content was designed better, although that's subjective.
---
I don’t get how that was in development for seven years
---
Until the quest requires a drop item with a low rate lol
---
lul @ no impr. reankh for pvp
---
you stomp ppl with 5/8 t2 (helm, bracer, belt, legs, boots) hard enough, AQset is a good upgrade but it's not like you dont stomp before that.
---
i didn't play then, but i believe it was a pain vs everyone. especially combo'd with a tree as far as i've heard! xD
---
**proc into Hearthstone , A.R. cannot be used in combat.
---
Take my upvote for "big Weiner warrior tanks"
---
They still give you a better idea of how Classic will be than anything else and they are fairly close. Most of the boss stats are taken from actual vanilla databases, the things that are uncertain are how resistance works and proc rates on most weapons.
---
Nahhh stay alliance
---
Yeah I have no idea wtf I'm looking at here.
---
Came here to post this. Very happy to see someone beat me to it! 
---
That's cool
---
If someone isn't locked to the raid, and they get invited into raid on day two for example, does that person then become locked to the raid right away, or after the next boss kill?
---
Are you serious?  I can't even tell what I'm supposed to be looking at.
---
Unpopular opinion: wow was ruined before vanilla was over.  Naxx really isn't different from bc for the most part.  Once bliz committed to ilvl creep with tier gear it was all over.  There's a reason most people's fondest memories are leveling and strat/scholo/Ubrs/brd.  The disparate methods of getting gear were more fun and immersive.   
---
Uh....ok
---
I had shadowforge key. It felt like a big accomplishment. It made the group happy and made myself so useful. I miss keys. ♥️🔑
---
I'm not even sure if bodies reminds me of vanilla or vanilla reminds me of bodies.
---
Honestly feels like they dropped it, scrapped some, restarted it. 
---
Like every other AAA these days, they definitely took away funding from dev teams and put it into marketing hence the fucking Times Square ads
---
I can’t wait for vanilla to drop. An actual content filled world that took years and years of real dev energy and passion. You just don’t see that anymore
---
OI’VE THE FOINEST WAYRES IN THE LAND

---
If your guild has a fair LC, you can actually calculate what items benifit mages and warlocks more i terms of BiS items and with tiers being known in advance, this is fairly easy. As a rule of thumb on conflicting items, you want to throw hit gear on warlocks and crit items on mages. For instance, you'd throw mish'undare on mages, because in addition to it being a 2% crit item, warlocks get a helm with about the same SP &amp; 1 hit/crit from 2.5 in AQ. You want to divide up loot this way because warlocks lack a great deal of hit where mages get 6%for fire/frost and another 2% from ZG enchant. While crit is about as valuable for frost mages and warlocks(mages generally getting a bit more), for fire the difference is huge. 
---
To conclude, usually there should't be a lot bickering between mages and warlocks in a raid setting if your LC is fair and knowlegable.
---
"My skill isn't high enough", then they just come back after the dungeon is done and they're no longer in a group.
---
Population decline didn't occur until WotLK. Population greatly increased during vanilla and BC, and early WotLK, but started dying after Ulduar had come and gone.
---
I agree that vanilla dungeons are extremely fun, and that's why I'm playing pservers until the real ones launch, but BC wasn't bad, nor was it the death of anything. Besides, rep grinding was fun and rewarding.
---
Population started declining in late WotLK, not Cataclysm, not BC, WotLK.
---
"gash darn" - American detected xD
---
While that's true, the pserver is pre-nerf Shadowmeld so it doesn't really apply.
---
Personally, I would say the nerf hit NE hunters pretty hard considering dwarves essentially get their own Blessing of Freedom when fighting rogues.
---
Took me a second but I finally see a man with brownskin, a black nose, a red bears, a green hood, and black gloves, holding onto a table.

Now, I'm enjoying my studies much more than I did when I first attended uni around 20 years ago, and my young sons bring me much amusement and some happiness. But. But..  I hear and feel what you're saying brother. I've not felt more invested in a game since I first played wow during vanilla.
---
What is lore, baby don't hurt me, don't hurt me, no more.
---
Dwarf is better, but only marginally, its not a big deal if you want to play Human.
---
Population also peaked in Wrath. Saying it started to decline is completely misrepresenting the facts. 
---
It plummeted in cataclysm to BC/Vanilla numbers. It gained through much of Wrath and then lost some, still being higher than BC and Vanilla.
---
What did they do
---
Another PSA to Hunters: Don't roll on everything

I am a veteran player started during final beta 2004 and I just heard about this place! I am so amazed that this age-old game still has some mysteries and secrets for me I‘ve never heard of. The karazhan crypts are huuge and amazing. It makes me wonder what Blizzard planned for this place and than scrapped it up?!
---
Bc improved a lot of things, but the seeds were planted and it was too late to change course.  Plus, as you said, from Blizzard's point of view things were great... But truly the game was already lurching towards mediocrity, and tons of people myself included, didn't realize what it had lost until ruminating on what was really great about vanilla. 
---
Remember, vanilla had cool rep grinds too- and while some were unfinished, they felt organic and a part of the world rather than bc's planned and planted rep.  Like bc's planned and planted linear zones.  And bc's planned and planted linear gear progression.  In fact the best thing about bc was left over from vanilla- Kara.
---
What's your source on this? Because I'm pretty confident that mage and druid are both miles ahead of priest as well.
---
Killed him rather unceremoniously (died in a duel with Garrosh "Retcon" Hellscream but he was secretly poisoned by the Grimtotem clan to the fury of Garrosh, because it obscured what would've really happened if they'd dueled fairly). 
---
Should be children of arthas
---
TIL
---
In the early leveling you can almost always switch roles with a change of play style while still being viable and especially if you have different gear for the intended purpose and the other members of the group can be more conservative in their DPS to let you build threat and hold aggro. In end game no one will want or expect any class that can heal and buff to do anything else . 
---
Fucking Kek
---
Gannon is looking good these days
---
Any of them really, Hunter or Mage for farming at 60 would compliment Paladin best. Paladin is a good choice to start with though since youll have spare gold from getting a free mount to donate to your alt.
---
If you go on boss kills only, the mages and warlocks are basically even.  First raid:
---
Warlock dps: 863, 817, 808, 658, 511 avg dps = 731 avg dps
---
Mage dps: 834, 775, 756, 637, 527, 522 = 675 dps
---
2nd raid:
---
Warlock dps: 823, 748, 615, 540 = 681 dps
---
Mage dps: 879, 760, 724, 717, 661, 570, 548 = 694 dps.
---
Even with your hand picked logs, I don't see clear evidence that warlocks are even stronger than mages, and I've showed that they are worse than mages in AQ and we all know they are worse in previous raids.
---
So yeah, warlocks is this shitty class that once fully naxx geared is... about the same dps as a mage.
---
Papa Tauren will come back to us.
---
Things might seem more serious because of two things:
---
1.  Most everyone on this sub is at least old enough to remember playing Classic,TBC,WotLK 10-15 years ago.  The player base is older, and "wiser" (lul).
---
2.  No one knew shit back then, so very few players got a full set of purple gear.  However some did, and many of us remember viewing them with awe.  Now we can all see a much clearer and achievable path to finally getting ourselves that sweet 40-man raid gear, and a lot of us are HYPED as hell to get started.
---
I have a feeling the servers will feel a lot more "organized" this time around, with people more willing to run guilds, form groups, and help out since more people will be late-game minded this time around.  However, I don't think it will feel overly serious.  
---
In fact, I'm optimistic it'll all feel more enjoyable since we won't repeat the situation where a few "elites" have to deal with a dumber on average player-base, and might not feel the need to act like rude assholes (as often).
---
You say recently, but we have no idea of official number of players for WoW, and on top of that OSRS is F2P. I agree with the sentiment of the rest of your post though with games not being for everyone. 
---
-narrows eyes- -destealths to node jack you while you are stuck in combat- pbbbbtttt
---
They're toxic online and IRL too.
---
Remove the hyphen if you want to correctly use the 'is greater than' mathematical operator to demonstrate that Classic, is in fact, greater than Anthem. Other than that, yes you're completely correct.
---
Not with that attitude 
---
It's not misrepresenting the facts, it's simply stating them. There were enough changes to the game that made new players not want to come back. Sure, it took time before the numbers got down again, but it was the point where players said, "no thanks" in large numbers. Just because I shot you in the stomach doesn't mean you'll die right away, but you're still dying.
---
I guess that's true, but I'd be very surprised if wow had over 100k concurrent still playing with how dead the game seems lol. Nevertheless, the 'resurgence' of this old style of MMOs is undeniable.
---
The game doesn't seem dead at all on EU. In Warmode there are constantly people in every zone, always raids of players. 
---
You're still better off grouping up.
---
Lol like I said
---
I had one of my coworkers play it at work a week ago and everyone was shocked it was one of my favorite songs. I’m a pretty mellow and laidback dude, more of an eagles or folk rock guy. I didn’t even bother to explain to them it’s because of fond memories of late nights PvPing or for a boost while killing Rag at 2AM. 😂

Bangalash
---
and all of this happened in books. Nothing ingame.
---
This is a private server thing, am i right? You could only see max 50 players with /who back in the days.
---
I think I answered it just fine. I don't understand the completely unnecessary hostility from both camps. No, I don't see the reasoning for being an overly hostile colostomy bag of a person over a video game.

Don't take the reddit community as fully representative of the community that will exist in the game.
---
Druid Cenarion Set has 2 bad bonuses:
---
3/8 - Increase thorns damage and duration - who the fuck cares? I'm sure that extra 4 damage per hit is really going to be the reason we take down Ragnaros, because, you know, going from 18 damage to 22 damage per hit is so impactful.
---
8/8 - Reduces the cooldown of Tranquility and Hurricane. Note how it doesnt say, reduces the mana cost or increase the damage or increase the number of ticks, just reduce the cooldown... for spells that are extremely mana intensive and not very useful. Gee thanks.
---
Special shoutout to the 3/5 Mage AQ bonus - a 30% chance that blizzard is uninterruptable. There are so many things wrong with that, its embarrassing. 
---
&gt;It is however troublesome to look at the game 'holistically' because it opens the largest gate anyone has ever seen for a plethora of strawmen
---
Yeah this seems to be quite common with debates online sadly. 
---
Give me all your food
---
Yeah the title ruined it. To me it looks like the Warcraft object is accessing a property called Anthem. Totally wrong operators there.
---
I changed up my hotbars to be a bit more efficient but my muscle memory was too strong, I divine interventioned a tank TWICE in AQ40 causing a few deaths, but at least I realized and called it out fast enough for him to click it off. I also BoPd a Rogue one fight too for no reason other than to stop him attacking.
---
Auto-running in UBRS to eat ramen noodles. Ran straight off the bridge going towards Draks room and died. Whole raid had to wait for me to run back and we had no warlock.
---
I came from playing D2 and my first character was a warrior. In D2, 2h weapons usually had about twice the DPS as a 1h weapon of the same level. So when I started playing I always used a 1h and shield because in WoW, the 2h weapons usually only have about 30% more DPS than 1hs, so from my perspective, every 2h I came across seemed incredibly weak. Eventually when talking to my friends about it they explained to me the differences between the 2 games. So I went into Gnomeregan and picked up my first ever 2h to level with.... the Hydrocane....

The way it works in retail, and I believe it’s been this way for as long as I can remember, is that when you enter someone else’s raid “in progress” (they’ve killed one or more bosses), a dialog box appears that asks you if you would REALLY like to join this raid and that you’ll be saved to that instance of you, locking you out of looting whatever bosses are already dead for that week. 
---
Some people will definitely care, especially in high tier raids but i cant imagine someone giving a shi lt in dungeons tho. Hell even raids if you prepare well enough i can see people playing ret palas for example
---
Thanks 
---
Nah. Paladins auto attack their way to 60. SoC procs are based on weapon dmg so might improves that as well. Most of their mana regen comes from being out of the 5s rule after judging a mob and recasting seal.

Imagine you have $6,000 that you invest entirely in stock a. Over the course of two years, your value grows to $15,000, before falling down to $$11,000, having netted $5,000. You then pull all of your money out of stock a and reinvest in stock b. Within a year, your $11,000 has plummeted to $6,000 once again. 
---
Through your logic, it is stock a’s fault, because it didn’t hold its peak value. To most people, they’d say “hey, company a doubled my money. It was my poor investment in stock b that left me back where I started.”
---
Yes but at least for the 1.12 client there are addons that systematically scan the whole player base via /who. That way you can get somewhat reliable numbers (beyond a few logging on/off).
---
Some private servers just show unlimited/everyone and some other servers limit it. Paradoxically, the only server limiting it to 50 at a time and giving random results after a few searches is often accused of hiding numbers but there's an updated census version for that server as well.

For a mage to do crazy dps they need to get lucky and roll the first ignite and maintain it ontop of already getting lots of lucky crits. For a warlock to do crazy dps all they need to do is crit. That's way less factors. If you're a player who values consistent high damage warlock will provide that. Mage also come with the fact that they blow their damage cooldowns at the start of the fight. The shorter the encounter (often the case with these rank 1 guilds) the better the mages dps is gonna look by comparison because of that initial burst. For a warlock outside of trinkets you're doing consistent steady dps from start to finish. The longer the encounter the more your damage will stick out vs your peers. Good examples: ouro + rag (no ranged threat) and nefarian.
---
Also the gorilla escort quest in Un’Goro crater was a PvP nightmare.  Your own faction could mess it up as well.
---

Would that mean anal is also making a comeback?

How much was a sealed WOTLK?

Shadowmeld was only great on pservers where it worked like vanish, so you could evade projectiles like deathcoil/pyro with feign death and shadowmeld combo. When classic hits this should not work and stoneform will be so much better.
---
What can I do to prepare for the games release? Will I have to purchase the full World of Warcraft and simply play on a classic server or is it going to be it's completely own game? Is there a way I can set it up so I can play the second it's released? 
---
I remember being young kid as well when started, and I had no prior knowledge of MMO’s. I remember seeing in chat an invitation for Shadowfang Keep. I was a hunter and ran my happy tail there from Durotar with direction from my group. I entered in the dungeon the precise time that rare 2h axe Night Reaver drops (no stats, just chance on hit to do shadowbolt). I press ‘Need’ and won over warrior in group. He called me “ninja,” and group disbanded over it. I actually thought ninja was a compliment and thanked him, and proceeded to get bitched at. 
---
I do remember raptor strike critting a warrior + proc in BGs and killing a warrior that charged me. It’s a hunter weapon right? xD
---
Literally how? Most people in that situation who receive the rare drop in the group would say "fuck you got mine" and skedaddle, meaning you wasted your time killing a bunch of mobs for half XP.
---
Shit I think I was the WC mage... Rarely did I AP in raids :(
---
I personally prefer carrying more weapons and switching, to be honest.  
---
This way I keep more up to date with the skills, and if I've been too long away from a city I can just switch weapons if one breaks.
---
Anal never went away...
---
Flying across the world? Time to play bejeweled. I miss that. 
---
Didnt mention the little caveat that it will be nearly impossible to raid as a feral or balance druid. If you're going to be a druid and raid the you're a healer pal. 
---
why not just mail it?
---
&gt; Like warlocks having to farm soulshards for the raid
---
Why do they not have to do that anymore? Serious question
---
My goal is to be first in server to reach Barrens specifically to start making Chuck Norris jokes and ask about mankirks wife

Good rundown, thanks. I skipped out on private servers because I've seen too much weird shit like this. Too broken for me.

So just one day you log in and he’s gone?
---
Yea, I hope Blizz can get us at least 5k online, but I feel like that's not going to happen.
---
Vanillagaming's devs were open about many bosses being overtuned, and all of the server's raiding guilds were fine with it. There isn't really a juicy conspiracy.
---
I wish tier sets looked different between the races, or at least the factions for this reason. I really like the primitive jungle headhunter aesthetic of trolls, but no endgame gear really fits that except for shaman gear, sort of. Horde should get more options for tribal looking gear with tooth necklaces and weird fetishes and tiki masks and whatnot, but oh well. Still glad we won’t have transmog.

I believe you are instantly saved if I remember correctly.

Another shining example of why private server isn't vanilla.
---
I've not done the Dreadsteed questline in, admittedly, a long time... but I remember it being quite long &amp; irksome.
---
I remember you had to buy like a 150g potion &amp; travel through the Satyr underground zone, run I think Strat &amp; then get a group to do Dire Maul with you for the summon. And it felt like no one ever wanted to run DM if you were doing the summon.
---
What are you studying?
---
You want to be the "guild enchanter" if you want good top end recipes. Many are BoP drops from raids.

True, most of what I remember is from TBC since that's when I played the most.. A lot of mechanics are unchanged from vanilla -&gt; TBC but this is one that clearly differed :)

All you have to do is subscribe to world of Warcraft and you'll be able to download it from the battle.net launcher
---
I love it 
---
PSA be happy you get any buffs, you already doing solo quests with 2 players (I.e. you have a pet)
---
Depending on the AH price for the trade skill mats, the whole questline can cost +500g. And the questline can be very difficult with the final part being hard to get a group for.
---
During retail Vanilla, I was under the impression that it was completely free. I didn't understand why so few Warlocks seemed to have the mount.
---
Nice and useless find.
---
Basically the game is based about getting loot to do higher difficulties, and the idea is that you find loot with the best roles (Random item stats) and use those.
---
Only problem is, instead of getting tons of legendaries and you look for the one with the best stats, you just don't get any legendaries at all; and when you do eventually get one (3-4 days between each) there's a 99% chance it's scrapped (disenchanted)
---
Think about trying to min max your build in Diablo 3 but all the items that drop are blues, and the game insists you do Greater Rift 70 in order to get items you need to actually do greater rift 70.
---
It's a looter shooter that doesn't actually drop loot. The highest form of PVE (Grandmaster 3) was droping common (White) and Uncommon (Green) items from the last boss of a 2 hour dungeon.
---
Resto shamans and warlocks are the two most sought-after classes. After that, it’s usually mages and healers. Hunters and melee dps are lowest on priority. 
---
It depends for tanks. Guilds might recruit an offtank here and there but they’re screwed if they don’t have a consistent MT+OTs showing up. Usually those spots are filled right away and not recruited. 
---
I have to keep alts at diffrent level ranges so I can do dungeons with friends who quit once I log my main.
---
I did this chicken quest whle leveling in BC. Don't know how much easier it got by then but was still pretty hard, but after several tries when I managed to solo it, boy that felt really good. After that they nerfed to the ground tho when it was zero challenge.
---
Looking forward for all of these quests.
---
development hell man. Probably took them 6 years to decide whether it should be multiplayer or not and they had to start over every time. 
---
Out of combat. 
---
Also I don't think it's necessary to go alchemy while leveling. You can save your herbs in your bank that you gather 1-60 to dump into alchemy at 60 but while leveling it'd be a good money maker to take skinning and also selling excess herbs. 
---
Your best bet is to choose a server with a neutral sounding name.  Names that lean towards one faction tend to get more of that faction.

This is a sign!

If you're in STV under level 20, you have bigger things to worry about than the PVP.

Also locks and paladin should give out some gold pre 40 cus we need it for mounts and you dont

Thank you!

I really hope they keep it the same as it was in classic because 5k plus or more would fk up the game so hard.

Why do they rate NE the best hunter race? Is shadowmeld that strong even with the nerf? I have never played hunter in WoW so I am not sure how they are in PVP.

It's a big difference when line of sight in involved. Not a big issue if the target is in an open area. 
---
I find a nelf hunter loses very little with the change. Certainly everyone on private servers don't know anything different anyway. Shadowmeld will still be a primary reason for players to choose a nelf hunter. The synergy between shadowmeld and hunter abilities remains even if some private server exploits can't be utilized.
---
It's still just too good for open world and the entire point of playing a nelf hunter is the stealth benefit.

---
AFAIK, the crypts did not have any lore behind them as John Stats simply built it to make sure players had enough content to explore when they were leveling.
---
However, at some point Blizzard decreased the experience required to reach level 60 which meant the Crypts was deemed redundant (a few other microdungeons as well) and scrapped before any lore and plans were made for the area.
---
Chris Metzen did actually take a look at the crypts during the development of WoW but all he did was request that the name "Upside-down Sinner" was changed because he didn't like it. (Read it in the WoW Diary)
---
Hunters are the fastest next to mages. Mages are better for farming gold endgame. 
---
Getting back to your body faster and being and to shadowmeld and eat gave a significant advantage in pvp for some cases. I'd still rather have that combo than the new options.
---
haha, perfect :)

That was really good exp though

The horde version is easier but tedious when you have to find that fucking roaming mob that travels an entire zone

I really wish this kind of "humor" wasn't as popular here, i've seen it quite a few times now.
---
I dont know, i want to play classic to have fun, when people are this down and talk about how WoW is the only thing keeping them alive that's just so sad. Like it just ruins the mood.
---
I'm right up there with you. This is the last time i'm gonna experience vanilla leveling. I'm gonna do it right so i wont have any regrets later. Pass me with that max level rush.
---
You can disenchant crafted uncommon+ tailor items. Slightly helpful for large amount of items that won’t ever sell. 
---
Crazy concept IKR.
---
Just spent two hours watching videos, love the humor and content bud! Keep it up!
---
You cannot convince most pve players to play on pvp. This is just reality.
---
What you try to convince to them as gains, they counter with the obvious losses created by each gain. Somefundamental game play principles PvE players demand, are negated on PvP servers. Plus you must not only convince 1 person to convert, you must convince every friend, guild mate and like-minded social group they expect to share a similar game play view with to convert.
---
Basically forget about it. The divisions are set in stone for the most part and you may convert 1 in 50. 
---

"dozing off" is that what they're calling it these days? jk, interesting find
---
Mortal Strike is a very important debuff in BGs but when it comes to control/durability I'd pick Paladin/Mage/Hunter, you have dispel and decurse, heal, amazing cc, burst, mana drain, slows for days, mobility... No one is catching your mage or your hunter with the support from the two others. Pally and hunters can last in long fights and complement each other very well in every aspect. 
---
Another PSA to hunters: dont multishot break CC and pull agro off the tank in dungeons.
---
Every time I appeared in TB, I always run to Cairne and gave him a big /hug. I just like his personality.
---
You already know the answer that most players are with you.
---
Then realize your spells are more expensive and you still need to buy the other mount.
---
Wonder who laughs last.
---
I second this. I've definitely gotten "feedback" after doing noob shit before, but by and large everyone has been nothing but polite and knowledgeable. I've learned more in a few months of playing on pservers than I had playing the entirety of retail Vanilla.

TIL Vanila WoW had Ewoks.
---
From a PVE perspective, how much of an advantage do Paladin buffs give over Shaman totems? How big of a difference is this for progression raiding?
---
I'm going to try to make and name 4 tons the day the game drops. There's 3 names I used over the years I'd like back and one name I never managed too get. 
---
The only way for me! Hopefully the Classic servers will stay for years, people will come and go, new guilds will form and raid MC while old ones are finishing with Naxx.
---
iirc, the devs said they want Classic to be like a "museum" where your characters can have permanence.
---
Hopefully they don't kill the Vanilla servers by releasing flying mount TBC and other expansions, and Classic lives on for people to come and go over many many years.
---
That being the case, there is no reason to rush. Smell the roses!

So we got a youtube video versus literally hundreds if not thousands of logs mostly stating otherwise?
---
Jesus, why do people even buy video games anymore? 
---
Thats true in some respect. But alot of people fail to take into account if you as a pair can kill 2.5X or more faster then when your solo then even if you have to kill twice the amount of mobs its a net gain. And I would say some class duo's can achieve way better than that with zero downtime. 
---
When I read this, I thought, wait, destruction is all the way on the right and d is so early....but then I thought about it more...

What was considered rich in gold in vanilla days?

Doesn't help when there are 200+ players competing for Sarkoth though...

This needs to be higher.

Some pservers are harder than others. I do expect it to be different. I just found out some pservers have 6 min lotus spawns. The one I was on had an hour I think it was and one per zone that could spawn a lotus. They tried to get as close as they could.

Sounds like Diablo 3 pre-loot 2.0.

Yep. There is even a gnome named Linken at Marshal's Refuge in Un'Goro. If I recall you have to find the quest randomly. There is a spot you have to go to and there is a wrecked boat. No exclamation point you just have to happen to mouse over it and see you can click it. I know where its at but I won't ruin it for you.
---
Yes, but the problem is that not all quests work this way. Quests where you need to collect X amount of Gnoll Paws or whatever should not be shared, meaning if 1 paw drops, only one player can loot it.
---
WoW Classic is basically free with your WoW subscription. So, $14.99 per month gets you access to both Battle for Azeroth if you have the expansion and WoW Classic will be just another server you click on outside of the retail ones. You don’t have to play retail though, of course. Pretty smart move on Blizzard’s part honestly... I’m sure some people coming back for classic will at least mess around on retail for a bit too.
---
If I recall you had to find a crashed boat that had no exclamation point you just had to get lucky and see that you could click it which would start the quest line.
---
Suddenly everything falls into place.
---
My experiences on Private servers which are supposedly a cesspit of elitism and try hards has actually been largely positive. Yes there will be some top end cutting edge guilds that will be taking raiding and PvP super serious but if that's not your thing then don't play with them. 
---
Most players and guilds aren't going to give a fuck when it comes to dungeons and MC/ZG. Things will get a little more serious we get to BWL/AQ but by that time most people will have found a place that fits their needs/playstyle.  
---
Paladins be like
---
I believe you can't have the same name as an NPC in WoW unless you add letters to it or something. So you can't be Malfurion as a druid unless you are Mallfurrion or something. So there are some restrictions. I never understood why some players can't just make their own name.
---
Not really. When you sit on a fiber connection with 10 MS while using good macros and an autoclicker you are pretty much guaranteed the tag on whatever spawns.
---
If you are doing a quest with limited amount of mobs where the item only drop for one person, it would be in your own best interest to not group. I usually group though, because just sitting there spamming a macro makes me feel like too much of a dick.
---
I recently bought a logitech g305 and it's been a nice change from wired.
---
You won't. Depending on the number of servers, assuming its not a ton, you will have to pick one and hope the population doesn't dwindle in the early months. I expect they will have a plan for servers whose populations dwindle.
---
Keeping 100g+ as a raider lol
---
I mailed Paladin for all of Vanilla, my alt was a Shaman on Horde. Raided on both. It’s not so much a stat difference as it is the unique things that each class can do during certain encounters.
---
For example, on Nefarian, a holy pally can heal with righteous fury turned on, pull all of the aggro from the Skeletons when they come back to life and then bubble at the last second. On Horde, they usually have the tanks do some creative kiting and pop cool downs... that part of the fight is definitely easier on Alliance.
---
On the other side, Shamans have a totem that can stop Fear. The only way to prevent your tank from getting feared on Alliance is either stance dancing or a dwarf priest with fear ward. Horde can also stack melee in a group with a shaman with WIndfury totem, etc. 
---
But yeah... Buffs vs. Totems is not really a huge deal. But both classes can offer unique game play during encounters or PvP if you know what you are doing.
---
Precisely. You can get stats that your class can't even use. Except there's no real money AH so I don't really see the point.
---
I would like to point out not all pserver players are against everyone. I look forward to helping out new players who haven't played vanilla or haven't since vanilla was a thing. I think its 2 vocal minorities yelling at each other. The kind of people who like to group types of players into one group as if they all think the same way.

Yes
---
How do you find the shape of the mouse in general? 
---
I'm thinking of buying an mmo mouse for classic but the cheap ones all have lots of flat edges which put me off. Expensive ones like Razer, Corsair, Logitech, etc. have nice smooth shapes but they're all pretty expensive
---
I'm of the opinion all fishing, leather, mining, and herbalism farmabkes materials and nodes in AV should be replaced with AV turn in items to bolster your faction.
---
Having said that, it will be likely present in classic depending on which version of av they use. Which I think is a total ass backward system considering there will be people in a BG with zero intention of playing the BG, and instead farming high level nodes.

This part specifically, i remember. There were always warlocks trying to do dire maul for that and theyd be hanging out, in town, forever.
---
This is why you all need to start making friends and guilding up early, and in large numbers. 
---
Because in wow classic, we will have to..... *gulp*........ talk to each other.
---
Oh god i hope they add lfd to classic! I cant actually talk to people!
---
To be fair its the only laugh they get. By then theyre often defeated.
---
I don't think anyone will disagree. 
---
You should get professional help ASAP. If Classic WoW is your only reason to live it's actually not, it's a coping mechanism and not a healthy one. Find someone to talk to, get help and you should probably try to quit WoW and find something else to spend your free time on, I recommend exercise since it works as a natural anti depressant. 
---
There was nowhere to creep to. T3 gear is BiS at least partially for most classes, but it was outdone by BC trash greens. If there was more Vanilla PvE content, people would have worn some Tier gear. How is this "creep" any different from "creep" with offset pieces from BWL being improvements over pieces from MC/Ony and pre-raid BiS gear? If you're concerned about gearing outside of raids, the Dungeon Set 2 questline was a cool idea that could have been expanded upon, but if you're suggesting that you should be able to gear outside of raids to jump straight into Naxx, now you're sounding like late WotLK and gtfo
---
Main, a bank alt and a twink. 
---
...it checks out.
---
This is some DS limitbreakers level of useless data.
---
It really helped the fantasy element. Im retail im flying on a phoenix, proto drake, or mech suit.
---
In classic ill be all affiliated with the light and my pally horse.
---
I just want to say that I hope to Elune that people keep posting memes with our new Crayola overlords. I want to come back here two years from now when Blizzard is prepping a Burning Crusade server launch and still see Crayola memes. And then someone needs to draw a Crayola Illidan and a Crayola Draenei with the purple mace.
---
Sorry I don't have full fledged confidence in Classic as I once did. I don't want to support it if it's not a authenticate experience. Just let a lot of people down.
---

For a moment i thought you're talking about BFA
---
The holy light shall protect me from all defeat dps btw
---
Wow, I always wondered what that fountain in STV was for! I never though to go back to a level 10-20 zone at level 43-48 looking for quests I won't be able to see at max level!
---
Vanilla quest design was gifted!
---
What class had 0 specs viable at endgame? I really want to hear which one doesn't have a representation of at least two in a 40-man raid comp.
---
I want a big tree trunk weapon like he has. I demand it.
---
They forgot: "Always reply to genchat when someone posts [[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19019)."
---
Yes, and it just furthers the frustration of that fact. When im elected class president, ill get 1 hour buff timers for all paladin blessings! Including blessing of freedom! Including blessing of protection! Including bubble!
---
You bring up a good point actually. Tanks are sometimes forced to pull more mobs than they can handle just because of the sheer size of a pack is so large. They hold aggro on as many mobs as they can manage with the tools that they have and let DPS cc, kite or tank the rest until taunt is ready.
---
I've had to use Growl, Distracting Shot and kiting many times just to rip a few loose mobs off the healer or other clothies to slowly get everything under control again.
---
Aq UW 6
---
Yes low level you can absolutely wear robes of arugal. When you get higher up there are crafted leather items and stuff from dungeons you can wear. Armor type wasn't as big a deal in Vanilla as it is today.
---
I know right. Sadly i'm too old to have really understood the frog meme thing. I'm sure it is hilarious though.
---
The point of the human killing alliance players is he is so no life he has gained the ability to kill anyone including GMs. It is explained in the episode.
---
Are you okay?
---
I was just about to link this.

Here is the consumable list. [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MsDWgYDIcPE\_5nX6pRbea-hW9JQjYikfCDWk16l5V-8/pubhtml#](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MsDWgYDIcPE_5nX6pRbea-hW9JQjYikfCDWk16l5V-8/pubhtml#)
---
But is it really free?
---
I'd say it's highly unlikely that black lotus will spawn in AV since they base everything on 1.12.
---
If you healed the PUG then part of the reason you're even at the point where that drops is due to your healing. A Mage isn't going to have an issue with you rolling on it especially if you make it clear that's one of the items you're there for at the beginning.
---
I think it was a good thing, especially with the rarity of the herbs in general on Nost - mostly due to overpopulation. I know that AV was nerfed to help expedite the matches. I'm just curious if Black lotus was cut along with that.
---
As far as picking herbs in AV, and I can't speak for others, but I personally would stay in the BG to PvP after the black lotus was picked.  I'd try to cap bunkers and win the BG as fast as possible because it was about as quick to finish the BG as it was to /afk (unless there was a large turtle, then I would /afk). 
---
Thank you soo much!
---
Was it removed in the AV nerf?
---
I'll just group up and make friends that will hopefully continue for as long as the game lasts.
---
See you there!
---
Depending on how strict the guild is on debuff slots raiding as shadow will be pretty boring only spell not adding a un wanted debuff is mind blast so rotation vill be mind blast 5 times wand for 10 sec then mindblas then wand for 10 sec rins repeat 
---
Dark humour but i can understand. 
---
I mean, I play night elves because I love Night Elves. Who cares if people don't want to play taurens. It's apart of the fantasy. Except gnomes. Gnomes are the worst.
---
\-I never said you need AQ for Ele gear. I suggest getting the reading comprehension of a 5 year old. 
---
\-Improved ankh is bad and mana is the main problem for a shaman on pvp. Then again you are horrible and probably don't offheal and play like a wannabe mage.
---
\-You want a shield but there is no guarantee you are getting that shield off the bat, especially when you spec elemental and some try hard (like you) is speccing full resto and usually on a loot council or an officer.
---
\-The idea of taking a shaman to Naxx is retarded since there is no gear there worth a darn. The tier set is all resto. Who cares if Shamans are needed there. OF COURSE they are needed there. Why would I go there to get some warrior Might of Menethil if I play elemental? Again get the reading comprehension of a 5 year old where I said to join a "middle progress guild" on a shaman as I said in my initial post. You have probably never done real naxx. Enjoy those real armor and resist values in Classic buddy. It is a MAJOR gold and time sink and there is ZERO reason to do it on a ele shaman.
---
\-Edward is stupidly expensive and you obviously don't know how to pvp and beat certain classes if you don't understand how weapon speed works in conjunction with a searing totem as far as spell pushback. You probably lose to mages I steamrolled on a shaman. 
---
Anyways enjoy healing Naxx, getting crappy healer gear when full resto is awful in PvP compared to Elemental and wasting points on a dumb talent because you need it to beat mages every hour you wouldn't need if you knew how to play. 
---
Improved Ankh LOL. 
---
Np fam. Vanilla is full of fun quests like that.
---
Having money to get your epic mount right at 60.

At least by the wowwiki revision  [13:14, October 30, 2006](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Black_Lotus?oldid=303680)‎ which would be during 1.12 only mentions:  
---
&gt;It is found in [Winterspring](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Winterspring), [Eastern Plaguelands](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Eastern_Plaguelands), [Burning Steppes](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_Steppes) and [Silithus](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Silithus). It is rare in all of these places and never appears anywhere else. Black Lotus requires 300 herbalism. It also spawns in the [Dire Maul](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Dire_Maul) arena together with the nature elemental boss. 
---
agreed. not even saying this from the perspective of your average joe, but if i'm already depressed i dont wanna go here and see green frog suicide memes
---
Hi, /u/SadCaterpillar
---
I hope so.  It's the way I prefer to play.
---
I think some people love the leveling and some prefer end game. The people who want to rush will make friends with others who like to rush.
---
I was a resto druid. I was in MC and had all the hp bars out on my screen. I was running and healing. I ran straight off a ledge into lava.
---
Maybe, but I was already stunned.  My stun threshold increased too much.
---
Same for end game dungeons, just be sure to let the group know what you specifically want and if they have a problem with it then find another DPS =P or have a friendly roll-off
---
Yes it did
---
uh I gotta buy so many expansions fml
---
Link to video plz?
---
There are plenty of games that do not suffer from those issues. Why people buy games like Anthem I do not know.
---
It's a great game but outdated, it's worth it for me. And they are remaking some missions and adding new cinematics/redo all cinematics to hold modern standards.
---
And it comes with an updated version of the custom map editor, which will spawn a new era of amazing mods.
---
In a sucker for it without a doubt!
---
Honestly if you really want to invest the time and effort to be mainly a tank, i strongly recommend playing a warrior. You'll save yourself a lot of trouble and frustration believe me.
---
Honestly yeah, but I'll take what I can get lol
---
Pocket redditing ftw.
---
I'm serious when i say this ; the best way to support your group is to be at the dungeon entrance as fast as possible so you can summon your team mates. After that you can literally /follow on someone and it would be fine lol
---
Take heart, young one. The earthmother is near.
---
Pizza &gt; Grapes
---
What kind of comparison is this? They're not even remotely the same.
---
Neither will the orcs. He was a great friend to thrall, a near life long bond. The orcish people refuse to forget or forgive what was done to our brethren. 
---
I cant stop laughing!!!
---
I am not going to rush. I have done that a few times, and I never enjoyed it. Rushing to 60 is brutal when that's all you want. Only characters I got to 60 (then 80 or 85) were mage and shaman, and because of that I knew those classes inside and out, mastered each of them. I also got a druid to 51, just could not make it to 60.
---
Players that rush to 60 (or worse, bought level 60s) didn't really know their class that well, IMO.
---
I know there are quests I never did, and I know there are quests I want to replay. I want to soak up all the lower level dungeons content and quests too.
---
I hope there are a lot of us like this, or it may make for a hard time getting the full experience I am hoping for. LFG was sometimes a pain, but when it worked out and you made or found that great group, it was all worth it.
---
This seems awesome!
---
i remember dying doing that quest...way down south in tanaris....that was a hell of a corpse run
---
You have priority on spirit gear and any +healing. They will get upset about spell damage though. Int/stam gear is fair game for both.
---
yeah i remember accidentally griefing some people doing it and being very embarrassed because they were on my faction...at least if they were hordies i coulda shrugged
---
if MC is motorcycle club what is WC?
---
**TL;DR** You ain't tanking shit if nobody wants a Paladin tank.
---
After leveling many Paladins on various private servers (through various stages of bugs and bad programming) and reading every vanilla Paladin tanking guide on the Internet, I'm pretty sure I can comment on this.
---
Like Groucho Marx said: “I wouldn't join a club that would have me as a member.” Any players inexperienced enough to accept a Paladin tank aren't going to be able to deal with the particular needs of a Paladin tank (positioning, threat management, ranged-pulling, not stunning, etc.)
---
PuGing as a paladin tank has been one of the worst leveling experiences. Literally *nobody* wants to gimp their DPS just because a special snowflake wants to run a memespec. Nobody cares. Nobody wants to understand. It's sad.
---
**The cold, hard truth:**
---
You're not going to be consistently tanking PuGs. You might get a chance to tank one or two incredibly low-level instances because you managed to PuG some pretty dumb players, but the fact is you'll be asked to heal, and if you can't heal you'll be kicked—except for the rare occasion where you'll be *allowed* to DPS (though your DPS is going to be so low you might as well be a Searing Totem.)
---
If you absolutely must tank while leveling then you can't put any points in Ret first. You must get Divine Intellect + Divine Strength and then the eleventh point in Consecration. Just keep in mind that Consecration will use up all your mana in two casts and is incredibly inefficient for leveling solo.
---
This is the earliest you can get Consecration and it's the only time it's really worth it because past level 30 you won't be able to reliably trick / convince players to let you ~~wipe for three hours on the same dungeon~~ tank as a Paladin.
---
If you're getting Cons this early then you're fully committed to an ~~inefficient~~ AoE-leveling experience. This means you'll need Redoubt, Shield-Spec, Toughness and Sanctuary, so say goodbye to any Ret talents because you're going to need those Protection skills to handle getting slammed by 5+ mobs without a healer (you're not going to exclusively level via dungeons—trust me.)
---
**Tanking dungeons as Prot while leveling:**
---
If you ignored all of the above, then you absolutely need Imp. Righteous Fury—but it doesn't stop there. The tanking effectiveness of Warriors and Druids depends almost entirely on the Warrior or Druid themselves. Paladin tanking, on the other hand, depends about 50% on the Paladin and 50% on the party. 
---
This means party members need to throttle their DPS, pay extra attention to targeting down marked mobs, reducing AoE to a minimum, understanding how BoP works, preferably having a threat meter, and eventually putting up with Blessing of Salvation (something Mages especially whine about.) 
---
This sounds fun and interactive, and I’m open to the idea that in a consistent, committed guild group it could be, but—and I know I sound like a broken record—I would never recommend leveling as a Protadin thinking you'll be PuGing dungeons regularly.
---
**Protection build:**
---
[11/33/7](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sE0zZVGxI0zEoVb) This is pretty much the optimal AoE Tanking build. Consecration is *key* to this, which is why mana is going to be your biggest limitation.
---
There's a way of making a ST Protadin build—[0/32/19](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sZVGxI0zyoVf0xMb) perhaps?—but it adds talents that don't really synergize—such as Conviction—and you have to sacrifice Divine Strength and Intellect, which is huge. Remember that Strength increases your amount of shield mitigation.
---
**Problems with leveling as Prot:**
---
/sit macros are not going to be a thing. In Classic this means Redoubt and Reckoning are going to be significantly nerfed, especially since talents like Anticipation actually diminish your ability to tank by increasing your Dodge + Parry (Paladins must get hit /block in order to tank.)
---
[Here's the bluepost showing this was fixed long before 1.12.](https://web.archive.org/web/20061206141810/http://blue.cardplace.com/cache/wow-paladin/1069149.htm)
---
&gt; “Can I sit down to force a crit and gain a charge?”
---
&gt; “**Charges will not generate off auto attacks or npc attacks by trying to sit down and force a crit.** However, ability crits from physical abilities such as Sinister Strike, Hamstring, Auto-shot, Aimed shot, etc will generate a charge if you're sitting.”
---
Furthermore, AoE-grinding is going to be *impossible* at launch. All mobs in all areas are going to be heavily contested, especially by Mages who are the AoE kings. Furthermore, AoE-grinding is really only efficient at very high levels anyway. I'm talking 50+ which specialized gear. This all changed in TBC, but during Classic don't expect to level as a Protadin by doing anything other than mediocre ST damage.
---
Additionally, a Protadin has to sit to drink after every pull while a regular tank w/healer might not have to. Players might not realize it, but this adds *waaaay* more time to every dungeon run.
---
In conclusion, if the ability to tank while leveling is your main decider, then the choice is clear: Warrior.
---
It could be made to look good, but they haven't pulled it off. It looks retarded instead.
---
So I've always wondered what would happen if you, for instance, raiding with your guild and cleared one boss, and then the next day tried to join a pug group for the same raid.  But I take it that the game simply wouldn't let you enter the instance, since you are tied to your raid leader's ID from the first try for the week?
---
Hunter, mage or lock
---
Both that and Thunderfury memes are in FULL effect on private servers, they're definitely coming back.
---
The last game I bought was Warcraft 3 special edition
---
I did all my Bc arenas here 
---
Most of my friends never got epic mount (1k Gold) because it was THAT expensive.
---
I almost never had more than 100g after I got mine because of raiding, potions and enchantment cost a lot

calm down there satan.

You forgot to mention that stats don't even matter and the damage numbers you see is just fluff that has nothing to do with the damage you're doing.
---
The weapon you get at the start of the game is the best weapon in the game...
---
&gt;But again, to start your argument with “I know they hate us because I’ve read the forum posts” but then end it with “well forum posts don’t count...blah blah polling..blah blah...” just reads like you’re frantically trying to not lose an internet argument. 
---
So wait.. That's not exactly what you're also doing?
---
Ah right okay. Sorry I forgot that your forum analysis of simply reading random comments is more reliable and less biased than mine, because 'you said so'.

This back and forth of 'my opinion on what gets posted on the forums is more important than yours' is a waste of time, but go ahead and have the last word if that's what you need to make yourself feel like you 'won'.

Does it mean localized game clients (Fr, De, etc) could change the order of talent trees?

Or the order is decided by the english names?

---
Check out the 2nd post down.
---
&gt;For starters, the entire plethora of Warriors and Rogues will deal 14% less damage, on paper. However, because of high critical strike chance of Warriors and Rogues (where most of their damage comes from) will also be affected by armor reduction, because a critical strike will be also reduced by 14%...but that 14% is from a number that is twice as big as a white hit. In other words, the damage loss from Warriors and Rogues (they usually sport like 50%+ critical chance damage with buffs, elixirs, etc) will be HIGHER than a simple 14% physical damage reduction from armor, probably around 21%.
---
What?  Does armor scale with higher damage?  If not 14% is 14%.  If it hits for 100 it does 14 less and if it hits for 1000 it does 140 less.. it's 14% either way.
---
Unless you get incredibly lucky with drops, or come into a server late and farm rare crafting mats that raiders need, I can't see anyone having even close to 1k when they ding 60.
---
I dungeons nobody will care much about your spec. They might in raids , but we did fine back then with weird specs (got to Naxx with ferals, balance druids, ret palas, etc), so should be fine now too.
---
But yeah, in dungeons you'll be invited unless the group leader doesn't want competition for loot (a ret pala might not be a warrior leader's first choice for DPS)
---
Been working fine on private servers.
---
I’m petrified that their going to fuck it up somehow and not give us a true classic experience. 
---
I'm not saying that there's something wrong with not playing Tauren. But I've read people say that they're Horde and really want to play Druid, but they hate the 1-10 leveling in Mulgore so won't do it. That's a very short-sighted reasoning!
---
Wish people would stop making out druids are so good. I like being the rarest class so I always get the Druid loot.
---
Don’t listen to this guy druids are terrible! /s
---
In all seriousness druids are fun, not not for everyone. While druids can be key on some fights for the majority of vanilla there is always a better class for the job. Warriors as a whole are better tanks. Shamans paladins and priests are better healers.
---
Utility is where druids shine, not pigeonholed into one specific job 100% of the time.
---
Yeah, I feel like that chest should have had like 20-25g in it at least.
---
Yes sir!

You'll get what we give you and be grateful.

Most US families aren’t wealthy enough to vacation every year, or extensively.

Is 1-60 solo content or do you need a group to do it? I’ve played wow since late BC but I honestly remember just dungeon spamming with a bit of questing in between.  
---
I’m wondering how different classic will be
---
Any of the Azshara quests and you're not a shaman or priest.
---
I remember doing the [THIS](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=3509) quest and having to basically swim across the entire zone 3 times. 
---
Alchemists should have been able to make a water-walking potion, tbh.
---
warlock feels slow but its consistent
---
Really not THAT hard. If you grind hardcore during leveling and skip quests I'm always very close to epic mount money+ money for pre raid BOE bis
---
Perfect tanks for 5 man dungeons, as long as your group aren't a bunch of idiots.

Wouldn't hold my breath for tanking raids.

but like in the example, 100% quest drops (hogger) will drop his 1 paw for all in the party.
---
My personal experience has shown most of the toxicity coming from China (not verbal rudeness, but they don't respect any normal rules of etiquette), Russia (extreme verbal rudeness, and the USA (rudeness and poisoning chat channels with their stupid politics.
---
Since this isn't intended to be an "optimal" end game build, I would say that taking the 2 points early on into shadow word pain time increase might be worth giving a go as well-since its not an overall optimal build you would need to respec at or near level 60 anyways. 
---
I actually like how this build is structured and I am tempted to play by it, but instead I would probably go down the route of spirit tap+shadow word pain&gt;discipline talents&gt;holy talents--this is because Pain is a continuous damage dealer, so slow wand fights can let that chew up the enemy-discipline before holy because you want those sustain talents more than anything like the wand damage (making the slow wanding slightly faster) and the mana regen/free casting are great things to have while questing, and the bonus fortitude would be a nice boon to cast on players you pass by as well.  Really the only thing you are missing out on early on is the reduced cast time of smite. The extra damage you can deal is 'nice' but the sustain disc would provide early on would help you both in questing and in healing early dungeons.
---
I know for sure raiding would be limited to healing only
---
https://youtu.be/AFWFBdbjQXE?t=7073
---
For Rogue, I wouldn't recommend opening every fight in stealth unless you spec a little into Subtlety. If you do, it can be an amazing gold making spec. Definitely level your poisons. They are worth it in PvE (instant) and especially PvP. 
---
In regards to Mage, prioritize the most recently upgraded fireball/frostbolt regardless of spec. You might occasionally use arcane missiles but generally AoE grinding with frost speciality is most efficient.
---
I'd say both classes have equal gold making potential and very similar DPS. The question is, do you want ranged or melee? Also, PvP or PvE server? While Mages are faster levelers, you can lose lots of that speed through ganking which is much easier to avoid as Rogue. This isn't as much of a problem if you no-life and stay ahead of the pack. Do you want to be responsible for soloing some raid mechanics? Rogues usually have to help in that manner. If you still can't decide, pick based on race, class fantasy, or any sort of gut feeling. Nonetheless, you'll be a very popular tier 1 DPS great for PvP (Rogues better in WPvP, Mages in BGs).
---
In regards to race, Undead is a great choice for both. Amazing PvP racial, cannibalize makes leveling a tad faster, and my personal favorite race fantasy. They also look really cool in Rogue gear. If you want to min-max, Orc is a great choice for Rogue for their extra damage racial and stun resistance. Trolls' extra casting speed racial is good for both, but they don't have too much going for them racial-wise imo. Honestly, just pick your favorite appearance and fantasy wise. They're pretty balanced.
---
I wouldn't say it's just for tanking, although it's a part I would enjoy doing every once and while. I feel like as a pally I have a better chance or getting into raids/better in pvp because of healing
---
If you raid ony on Sunday night then go raid again on Thursday, will you be able to take her on again?
---
Druids also have roots, and shaman have stoneclaw totem.
---
yup to me the difference between a good warlock and a great one is curse of recklessness when mobs start to flee and interuptting casts with a fear juggling or a spot seduce.  
---
Fear juggling:  You fear a mob and then put curse of recklessness on it before it runs into another pack of mobs, then replace cor with a different curse when you want it to start running away again.
---
Amazing post, thanks for the info! I was kind of worried that low level tanking would be a little lackluster without prot talents but your post about sacrificing leveling experience for tanking seems like a big deal
---
I'm suppost to be excited, finally have the ability to purchase my first home, proposing to the girlfriend soon, making more money than ever....yet....All I can think about is taking that sweet one week off, meeting new people, running around the planes of mulgore..das it mayne
---
Learn to read.
---
I loved the idea of druids. Having multiple forms, being able to DPS, heal, OR tank, sounds like a no brainer awesome class... And they can do all of that, just not as well as other classes. They are a hybrid class, good at everything, but excel in none (in Classic at least). After my failed warrior attempt, then level 60 mage, I rolled a druid. Got to level 51. Just didn't enjoy it enough to finish. I think even the last 10 levels I did on him were because of how awesome they were in TBC. Still not enough for me to level a druid to max level.
---
I remember druid tanks in dungeons being really awesome, but also remember warriors always being the main tank in raids.
---
I remember always having at least one druid healer, but I also remember priests being the best.
---
I remember druid DPS, and I don't really recall it being pretty...
---
They are a jack of all trades class, not the best in any category, but I always want some in my group or raid.
---
Do you remember that addon (I forget the name) that came to popularity in wotlk which literally drew images in the world about where boss mechanics would be, where safe areas are, ect... that addon was insanely useful but way too powerful.
---
Most Scandinavians I've met online have always been feminine sissies that get offended at everything. They are usually gaunt and gangly, have colored hair and often have terrible voice cracks on voice chat. That's my personal experience with them.
---
it was the same back in vanilla
---
If there was ever any *"Vanilla +"* content to be added, I want this to be a raid.
---
Another PSA to hunters: Dismiss your pet before the group jumps off of a ledge.
---
I remember I played on a friends account who had current tier arena gear on his lock. I had literally close to zero clue what I was doing.
---
I could no joke run around bgs spamming dots and a few shadow bolts/drain life. I would always end up top killing blows and damage done. I was like 12 years old at the time. Spec was BROKEN
---
I think the numbers are going to be way off the survey.  I feel like 20% of this sub is a Druid main.  Lol
---
Ahh I see so it's more diverse and not just spec centered, that's so different and interesting. I was thinking of either going Troll or Orc, leaning more towards Trolls since I like the fantasy/zones a bit more and Undead fantasy/zones haven't really appealed to me before. Is the Troll racial just casting speed in Vanilla? Or is it attack speed too?
---
Ohh... well yeah that is dumb. Just run to Durotar or something lol.
---
If you think leather wearers rolling on cloth is iffy, just wait til a paladin walks by in a dress :)
---
Yes, but I really depends on where or how spread out the extreme tryhards from private servers gravitate.
---
If your stuck in one of the servers that happen to have lots of them, you'll find a much more intense and less forgiving atmosphere. 
---
No.
---
(level 11 killing level 11 mobs for easy xp math)
---
If you need 10 items with a 25% drop rate. Solo, you get 10 items in 40 kills. At 2 kills per minute, you spend 20 minutes, gain 4,000xp. 
---
If you group, you now need 80 kills. At 50xp, you get the same 4,000xp, though 4 kills a minute isn't really sustainable for 80 kills. 3 is more likely due to respawn times, downtime, etc. So you get 80 kills in 26.7 minutes.
---
Same xp from kills, 6.7 minutes (33%) longer.
---
Althought might has very limited usage for a hunter, I will remove the buff in protest if you ever give me BOM.
---
I do agree. 
---
When I played Vanilla it was all about grinding to 60, getting good gear and getting into a raid guild. 
---
Then when BC dropped, none of my tier 1 8/8 mattered past the first few quest areas. 
---
Now that I’m older and wiser, and miss those small social interactions, it may take me a long time to get to 60 on classic. 
---
Thats nice for min-maxing...but its gotta be really really dull to play no? I would think just making blacksmithing/engineering for main and engineering mining for alt (hunter) would be enough on the premise that the paladin would get decent enough armor, weapons, and the hunter would get weapons and the pet tanks everything anyways (and gets mail armor at 40) so its not necessary to play 3 times.
---
Love fishing, you can level it along with cooking to 300 to save yourself some time later on. Plus access to grilled squid and nightfin will make bank if blizzard runs with seasons

This would be such a cool 5-man dungeon, or a 10/20 man raid. I love the atmosphere and the winding floorplan. I heard the reason it was never added though, was that it was too rated M for their target audience. 
---
Nowhere yet. We have to wait until the game comes out and the guys who make addons adapt them for Classic. You'll know where to get them when the time comes.
---
&gt;ing leveling and skip quests I'm always very close to epic mount money+ money for pre raid BOE bis
---
I was in a decent raiding group (so we didn't wipe too terribly often)
---
Hunters always were considered rich with over 1000g. I tended to have 300ish on any given day (paladin)
---
Warriors were always broke...
---
yea cats can be pretty cool
---
I don't think people will mind except for hard core raiding guilds. In our semi-HC raiding guild we had no obligatory specs or anything but playing well, behind high on DPS and using potions made it easier to be a part of the progress team.
---
We will run our guild like "Play because it's fun" mentality. RP PvP server, so there will for sure be communities out there for everyone :)
---
Yes, since it'll have reset between both raids no matter what. If it resets on Sunday morning, the next reset will be Thursday morning. If it resets after Sunday, then you'll obviously be able to fight Onyxia by Thursday.
---
Maybe in scrub guilds.
---
But I'm a melee hunter =(
---
Easily my favorite dungeon of all time. Actually finding a group that wanted to full clear BRD always made my dick hard
---
WC = WarCraft ?
---
Vanilla player here. Improved expose armor overwritten sunders i got a warning from rl not to do it again. They did not stack, fairy fire did stack tho.
---
Grow some balls then. I doubt you will be able to stop depressed people from expressing themselves. 
---
You're on a subreddit which hosts private server players who've been playing the same game for 3+ years. You will never see a group of players as invested this in your server.
---
I'm going on a similar approach. 
---
I got no game to play now a days. I play Overwatch maybe 4-5 matches a week and same with League of Legends. But it's not really much fun anymore.
---
I am gonna enjoy Vanilla as much as I can. I now know that the journey is the best part of the game. I will try to do every dungeon I can and just chill out in the evening when I'm home from work and got all my chores done for the day. 
---
Grab a coke and a bag of snacks or something and just enjoy some quests and dungeons and hopefully party up with some like-minded individuals who are in it for the love of the game. **Absolutely no rush at all.**
---
I started Vanilla when I was 9 years old. So there's so much great memories tied to this game. And I haven't played a Vanilla private server in about 5 years. So I am 100% ready for maximum feels. 
---
Make spirit give a slight +healing and let it apply too bandages and potions. Makes it viable for every class especially solo
---
Instead of 25 focus p/tick it'll be 30.
---
I wouldn't pick it over spirit bond for lvling really, and that's already quite a weak talent.
---
Stuff really changed in tbc. I played Ret pally and even with a lot of epics had a hard time to get a group to 5man heroic dungeons.
---
When I did great dmg in the dungeon they came with excuses instead of just accepting the fact retri was quite good in BC.
---
Can do it all solo mate. Running dungeons is entirely optional and more time consuming getting everyone together and meeting at the instance etc 
---
I wish this comment was higher
---
100% agree.  Joke or not if this is actually true I would listen to this advice or at the very least just get someone to talk to about.  You will never know it can help until you try. 
---
Druid tanks will never be used for progression on current raid boss. Druid tanks should be fine in old tiers or ZG, although warriors will always be preferred. 
---
Seeing as we are going to be going off patch 1.12, I'm not sure how Lupos is relevant 
---
Not that I am aware of. You can look up dungeon quests but that's about it. I don't think the issue you are worried about is that big of an issue. 
---
I think it’s just bad research and communication on South Park’s end. Blizzard helped them get all the wow footage but probably didn’t have anything to do with the dialogues. 
---
Certainly the episode would’ve been far more enjoyable without the mistakes. For WoW fans at least. 
---
Did anyone seriously have high hopes for anthem? It's destiny with jetpacks and destiny was the most shallow puddle of a game released in a while.
---
Those zeppelins are nice. I do like how Ally cities are located near the major quest hubs though. Alliance can see Blackrock Mountain from Stormwind.
---
I found myself being able to take on three mobs at once. Fear, pet tank, drain tank though. Dots all round ofc
---
Do rogues counter shadow priests and caster druids in PvP? I'll be playing human priest and nelf druid for context
---
Playing against rogues thoroughly disgusted me on the expansions I played (wotlk and cata, but especially in cata), so I wanna know what it's like in vanilla
---
I have no idea why you were downvoted by an idiot but I appreciate the discipline you put on yourself when thinking of playing this game
---
LW is worthless enough without non skinners trying to take our mats. 
---
Lupos won’t be relevant at all since were playing in a 1.12 patch.
---
The head in the second shot freaks me out
---
Much clarify, many thank. Wow
---
I'm gonna rush to 60 and not read a single quest.  
---
Shadowmeld isn't useable in combat in Vanilla. That wasn't added until Wrath if I recall. I have this memory of being in Naxx in wrath and all the night elves running to the back of the room to shadowmeld on patchwerk because a wipe was happening. There was always one who would try to ruin it though. I never knew why. The faster we can get everyone back up the faster the raid progresses.
---
Joana's guides are great for what they are - but not ideal for fresh launches. Being as specific as it is, congestion is real.
---
So everyone on Alliance, please follow his guide at launch, so I've got less competition doing my stuff :D
---
It seems like meld has a higher floor and ceiling for skilled plays while stoneform is literally a trinket for blind or a devouring plague cleanse, the other effects are negligible. There are also poison/bleed cleansing trinkets.
---
Dwarf is basically to be a bounty hunter that chases rogues, more or less that. A focused hard counter
---
Nelf has a lot of combat drops and charge/polymorph denial with meld. All purpose well rounded skill that synergizes with the chad front flip animations.
---
I'm hoping everyone is either A) Just picking up every quest and doing their thing, or B) Using a guide like Joanas. So I can get ahead with a planned strat to ~12, which may or may not have been influenced by your 1-5 guide =P.
---
Constructive criticism, please link to the classic 1.12 talent calc with hunter selected and if it makes it clear skilll up the talents to just before the decision in question is made. I know asking about the talent with no details creates a sense of an "in" crowd but vets can generally give good advice even if they didn't play the class. (most of the time)
---
Thank you.
---
Gnome mage and win
---
Are there achievements in classic? Also are there any rep grinds I should start right away? 
---
I can't remember what Angry Joe did, it was probably something he said with a political slant but I hadn't listened to him since then. A friend and I bought anthem and after a lot of let downs he linked that video, it was literally word for word true. 100/100 So even the Joe-hater approves
---
I had a paladin tank, that was reasonably geared at endgame. I did have to pivot to holy in the end. We were a naxx  guild, and I was “that guy” who would scoop up the tank drops that no one else wanted and kept dkp flowing. Here’s the hard truth:
---
Itemization sucks, anything that makes you good at tanking damage makes you worse at holding threat, as well as the inverse. In order to hold threat and not be Oom 24/7, you need to be pumping yourself full of consumables. You will need an alternate spell damage weapon that you swap in before consecrating if you want to have dps do much. 
---
Leveling, I enjoy prot but really leveling as any spec of paladin is slow AF so I didn’t really notice a difference between the specs when casually leveling. With the 1.12 talents you can tank low level  stuff but it’s still OOM town.
---
In the end of vanilla, the highest dungeon I could just hop in and tank for people without having to spend 200g on consumables and sweat while watching the threat meters was BRD. That’s the sad truth.
---
Can you tank more? Yes, but it’s literally a vertical cliff ahead of you of cost, rejection, and needing to prove yourself. 
---
I’m not sure if anyone remembers this, but I took on the role of off-off tank when improved blessing of salvation and seal of fury were a thing. I still don’t know why they removed seal of fury, as just running that a judge/autoattack/low rank consecrate rotation would keep me high enough on the threat that I could generally stay around the dps without going oom and would offtank some trash or keep high on a boss in case of a catastrophic failure. This saved a few pulls along the way, or kept raids moving when warriors were having connection issues. As soon as they moved  to holy damage as threat generation my ability to do anything when I didn’t already have threat vanished, and my run was done.
---
One thing that people rarely speak about is the healing problem. It's not just about the CDs or the fact that druids cant cap defense or their gear is harder to get, it's the fact that you have take more damage. With the bigger hp pool it's not a problem to survive but it means you also need more healing and mana is a huge problem early on for healers. 
---
Although i absolutely agree with you, actually guilds that are looking to min max should have a druid off tank because a lot of bosses require only two tanks so on those bosses the druid can go in cat form to dps and actually do decent damage compared to a war tank.
---
Wow! He covered all the bases. Bravo! I too second lock or mage with a possible edge going to lock since more people typically roll mage
---
Chuck Norris doesn't teabag women, he potato-sacks them.
---
I joined the day before BC launched, so I’m planning on taking my time and enjoying the ride in Classic
---
If all you care about is the 60s boss encounters, clearing trash is more than half the battle.
---
When I was level 45 or so, I remember logging into my friend's account to farm gold on his warrior. I saw he had 300g and was like O.O
---
Guess I'll be asking for your help while being ganked in STV!
---
Curse of reck and fear would stay on the mob at the same time as debuffs (reck didn't remove fear, it just made it ineffective). So even though reck was active, the fear was too. So you could "juggle" the mob back and forth by switching between rank 1 reck and rank 1 any other curse.  
---
Put reck on feared mob &gt; starts to run to it's agro target &gt; replace reck with something else and off it goes again &gt; repeat  
---
Did you... did you type this whole thing out????
---
while you're correct in the fact that grinding mobs without quests leads to greater gold to exp ratios on your gains.
---
I wonder if you just gain more of both questing to a high lvl or even 60 and then farming.
---
So you might grind beats for skins and get 200 gold in a week and go from 35-45
---
Someone might quest from 35-45 in one week and make 110 gold, double exp, 10-25% less gold, but as you level your mobs drop more expensive trash. 
---
Druids are fun in a lot of ways, but I think that tanking with one is boring AF compared to a warrior. It's just not fun 
---
It's 2019
---
I appreciate it!
---
I always like to sit down at PC and game at the end of the day when I have done something productive throughout the day. That way it becomes a hell of a lot more fun for me.
---
For some reason I can't sit and game all throughout the day like I could when I was younger. I become lethargic then lose motivation to play and get headaches for some reason. I truly wish this wasn't the case. 
---
I will have a Lan party with my friend at release though. So first few days I am binging hard!
---
Cheers :)
---
You don't have to pay anything other than the subscription as far as I know. Everything up to the latest expansion just comes with the subscription, and you only need to buy the latest expansion.
---
several classes can guarantee 800-1000 gold while having top exp rates. On PS with rested as a mage aoe farming lashers there is nothing better than gathering 2-3 of those packs while avoiding the big guys. You might gain a literal 1/3 or 1/4 of your entire exp bar from a pull.
---
I would level a warrior or paladin with you. As a shield bearer, for that matter. I love this idea. +infinity
---
God damn I cant wait. My Dwarf Priest/Pally (I haven't decided which one I'll roll 1st) is going to be loving that healing life! Being a healer is like one of those old Pitbull videos with all the hot broads everywhere and you're Pitbull
---
That is a terrible analogy. This isn't stocks, this is a flowing game. And you accused me of being disingenuous? Yikes.
---
Closest we'll get to a totem weapon is the one from ZF 
---
6 Mana 4/5 deathrattle: summon a 4/5
---
It is more raw damage, not calculating avoidances.
---
Sorry, you're right, druid is faster.
---
Mage can be faster, but only if you're doing non-stop, uncontested AoE grinding, which, on a high pop, or a PvP server, is incredibly unlikely.
---
Assuming they don't patch out these old clipping tricks :(.
---
So the best way is to just spam questing, moving zone to zone?
---
It is around 10% more raw damage if not taking into account avoidance.
---
One thing people should also consider is current raid release etc. Druid tanks take a ton less damage than warriorswith pre-bis items going into molten core. Because Warrior pre-bis items pretty much suck and druids have access to some items that are bis trough vanilla.
---
SM ruin with backlash👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
---
Blizzard did nothing to him, it was that traitorous wench Magatha Grimtotem!!! 
---
Yeah, better prepare that sweet \[Dwarven Defender\] of yours! 
---
Get a turtle for tanking elites. (Shield shell was a thing in Classic right? Still though, best armor for a pet, with thick hide they're damn tough.)
---
Get a Gorilla for solo play. (Thunderclap let's you do one mend pet (might need to downrank it) without pulling the adds.)
---
And I'd say a wolf for raiding. (Furious Howl buffs your party's physical, it's not much but it's probably the best for the overall raid dps.)
---
Yes its just maul and swipe. But the fun part comes if you want to play like real hybrid and do different things on different bosses. Each boss is like a puzzle and you can be viable in many ways, not just tanking.
---
I think it's fair to say most casual players got their first epic mount at level 65 or so in TBC
---
For main tank yes, but it's not so simple question for offtanks. Feral tanks beat those fury dps specced offtanks.
---
This!  Last time we had a new Tool album was even during vanilla. 
---
&gt; and you only need to buy the latest expansion.
---
only got the old classic and tbc tho
---
My 1-5 guide is 1-10 now. Last few tests have gotten me to 12 by hour 4 competition free.
---
Working on a new uncontested 12-20 strat this weekend. Did it in 5:29 this morning.
---
Paladins are slow? My ass. :p
---
Yeah pretty much. Also some grinding of mobs in between from time to time. A lot of quest chains and some general quests will have an elite which may need a friend or a party to complete or potentially solo if you're a hunter or lock 
---
I'm honestly not kidding. I want sure what i wanted to roll for classic. I played a NE rogue during vanilla retail, but I'm stuck now. If you want to figure out a play schedule, I would actually be happy to play a nostalgia filled, epic cinematic style adventure for a warrior or paladin. Or maybe your friendly gnome wizard or rogue companion, obsessed with tinkering and engineering
---
After picking up few new games and putting them down after playing them twice, I downloaded some fan made total conversion mod for fallout 2. Was hooked on it for a solid month of play time. Are new games overwhelmingly bad or are we just bunch of grandpas refusing to grow with time?
---
Moms hot
---
Gotcha. Do you know an estimate of the time that it takes to hit 60 assuming you're going at a good speed?
---
Timbermaw is sad they got left out
---
It’s fun for the first 15 hours until you’re done the story and hit endgame and realize...... there’s no endgame. Replaying the same couple strongholds one of which is just the last mission. And loot system is atrocious. Even for an AAA this game is weak
---
Not only working, but fun as fuck
---
Don't you know? When you reach max level in WoW you afk in Ironforge or Orgrimmar.  
---
FOR THE HORDE
---
Name? Or link?
---
At work so i cant watch the video, but the Horde Onyxia was awful, especially since the Alliance one is so much easier.
---
Yo C-boi what's poppin baby?
---
 \- Thrall
---
lol.. no. I don't think I could type like that and not lose my mind.
---
nice 
---
6 days if you're an insanely good grinder, 9 days for average players, and likely up to 12 days if it's your first time (gametime). A lot of people on this sub peddle misinformation that you don't have to grind mobs, but you'll find out that's untrue as soon as you get past lvl 20\~30 and get to the trashy zones (because even on private servers where quest XP rewards are boosted you have to grind &gt;60% of the time at the very least).
---
Hand of Antu'sul I think it's called, it was one handed though
---
[It's a meme you dip](https://tagn.wordpress.com/2009/07/20/alamo-teechs-u-2-play-durid/)
---
It's a 2005 WoW forum copypasta.
---
&gt;It's a looter shooter that doesn't actually drop loot. The highest form of PVE (Grandmaster 3) was droping common (White) and Uncommon (Green) items from the last boss of a 2 hour dungeon.
---
And people were happy doing Naxx(vanilla) for four months until they get a single item.
---
What's backlash?
---
You get hit you get an instant shadowbolt 
---
Let's be Honest. Classic is only gonna last a year or two before it dies (again)  Unless Blizzard starts adding content, Classic will die.  Most pirates didn't even pay a sub fee. I don't see a great future. 
---
Which was the least played race in Vanilla?
---
I've learned that a hard way, by getting sniped via a voidwolker when waiting for the bear to spawn for a Darkshore quest.
---
The Hinterlands one wasn't too bad, doable but very slow and the reward wasn't really worth it.
---
I tried and failed the one in Feralas, the yetis would respawn too fast for me, extremely frustrating quests. I won't be doing them alone this time round.
---
Easiest healer in Vanilla for someone new to healing?
---
The end of the quest was amazing and the game could really use more encounters like that. The felguards meant the lock at a special role in the fight where they could leverage thematic skills like Enslave Demon and Banish to help with the fight. Every class deserves a quest like this.
---
The length of the post doesn't make it the only truth.  I leveled 2 pallys as prot on 2 different private servers. I had no problems with training low level dungeons since there was a desperate need of tanks and so people in almost every group listened, and to their intellectual extend, followed the rules I gave them. 
---
Nevertheless, the real problem starts AT 60. People want to show off their insane dps on their way to pre raid bis that they seem to forget what they just learned while leveling. 
---
In a nutshell:
---
- level as a prot if you like it, tanks will be needed and there's a good chance people will be grateful for you since waiting another hour or two would be the other option
---
- rethink your choice at 60 ... either respecc full holy or use a 20/31/0 or 30/21/0 build to tank/heal dungeons and be the raid healer with blessing of salvation for the warrior tanks. 
---
My 2 cents
---
Okay, I have it on good account from someone I trust that "the amount of Agi needed
---
And where is that?  I can't find it in the vanilla talent calculator or skills list.
---
I think it's in affliction. Can you link the calc?
---
Yeah but there were other things to do then and you actually had a community you could chat to ingame, go do pvp etc.
---
Anthem doesn't even have an ingame communication system on PC, no text chat and no voice comms, at all.
---
I leveled 2 pallys as prot on 2 different private servers. I had no problems with tanking low level dungeons since there was a desperate need of tanks and so people in almost every group listened, and to their intellectual extend, followed the rules I gave them. 
---
I'd say Paladin, but you'll likely hear different opinions. Too be honest none of them are overly complex, but Shaman definitely has the most abilities.
---
I guess I'll be in the same boat this time around as well. Just playing the game to have fun, explore everywhere (I haven't seen these zones for a decade, though I think I will remember Felwood like the back of my hand). 
---
I only had a single character through all of vanilla (excepting bank alts) and I am confident I'll be this way again. I plan on spending a lot of time just meandering around the world, helping people (and maybe killing more than a few) as we all level. And running off on a tangent everytime I see a little yellow dot. I'm gonna gather the whole of Azeroth.
---
I do plan on raiding once I hit 60, but I don't think that's gonna happen this year.
---
Today I learned what TIL mean.
---
thx

Aggressive is good for PvP.
---
No achievements. 
---
As far as rep grinds you'll want to gain honored with either Ironforge/Stormwind or Orgimmar depending on which capital city you want to hang out in. Honored gets you a 10% vendor discount. Rank 3 in PvP nets you another 10%.
---
Depending on what professions you intend to go for I'd also look up some recipes in those and see if they are rep-gates. For instance Thorium Brotherhood for blacksmithing.
---
Same with Broken Tooth.
---
It'll take ages to get to Darkshore for humans. Hope he will do the guide for leveling in Westfall.
---
I would just wait for classico. we are not far off now. Just a few months. They Will go by fast. Im saving My vanilla urges for classico. 
---
Your two cents amounts to glossing over all the problems by saying: “meh, people are gonna have to settle for you anyway cuz there won’t be enough warriors.”
---
At this point, you’re not being helpful, just being contrarian for the sake of being contrarian. 
---
IIRC (I might be wrong), there was no &lt;XXX guild has achieved world first X&gt; in vanilla, but there were top guilds and people paid attention on external sites about raid progress. 
---
People are actively recruiting for guilds in classic already, to organise composition and levelling before hand. 
---
Ive played both and honestly, I didnt notice much of a difference in terms of clear times. A lot guildies I know the game well though only want to play Alliance now, largely because Blessing of Salvation just makes most fights go faster and therefore a bit easier. Again, in terms of that though, I never noticed a huge difference, but Im not the type to stare at meters and look more at overall how the raid is going and how fast were clearing.
---
Fear Ward from Priests however is miles ahead of Grounding totem in terms of effectiveness. A badly timed fear can wipe the raid on fights like Nef and Ony.
---
Cleanse is also superior most often due to being a 3 in 1 dispel, most notably Chromagg being much easier. The fact that Shaman cannot dispel Magic debuffs is also a bit of a hurdle, as Dispel from Priests costs a decent amount of mana compared to Cleanse and theres just fewer raid members that can dispel overall. Shamans get Purge, but its actually rarely used in raids.
---
Poison Cleansing totem is one of the bigger pluses for Shaman, as it makes a huge difference on Visc and Bug Trio to a lesser extent. Allys usually skip Visc completely because hes too difficult, takes a long time to kill, takes too many consumes and his gear isnt that good.
---
So yeah, its a lot less about buffs and a lot more about their support abilities that make the biggest differences. 
---
Lightshope northdale, kronos 3 two best options 
---
Uncontested in that range? That's amazing.  
---
Your guides are some of the highest quality I've seen.  
---
Currently playing as a druid tank. Can tank any boss in MC and onyxia fine (i usually main tank geddon and ragnaros with fire resist gear, sometimes when they want more threat to kill something faster they ask me to maintank the thing too, have tanked everything except Magmadar mainly because we don't have any dwarf priest).
---
BWL, usually tank every boss until Chrommagus (i start on vael because i outthreat the warriors, tanking fine on bloodlord, maintank firemaw with fire resist gear, and somewhat maintank the other dragon because even if i lose my world buff on vael and the warriors did not i still do lot more threat).
---
As for ZG, it's easy. I would even say druid are better there (can't be hex by jindo, can do more threat on hakkar even if you are not being hit, can shift out of root on the spider boss, things like that).
---
Currently waiting for AQ to open to see how it goes there.
---
I leveled an account to 23 on a private server and it has just made me more excited for classic. There are to many bugs and a lack of polish on the private servers that I’m hoping will be cleared up when classic launches.
---
Also, I feel like I’ll be better prepared for the grind when classic does launch. I’m playing very casually right now, and that’s given me an idea for how I’ll integrate the wow lifestyle into my life :) 
---
Sort of. Clearing the raids is generally very easy, so the race will be to see who can level to 60 and clear MC first which is basically who can get the biggest group of 2 week no-lifers, and then there probably will be speed run leaderboards which is basically who can class stack and world buff/consumable stack the most. I doubt it will be super popular, the novelty wears off pretty quick if you’re playing that way.
---
Joana hasn't really been known for alternative routing.  
---
I asked him this question before regarding later zones, he seemed completely uninterested.  
---
I'll just mult-shot then feign death and watch the healer take aggro. I didn't do it. :D
---
Seriously, the best argument no to start playing Classic is this very sub. 
---
Like there was literally a thread the other day where a guy was telling everyone that "there is no reason to play shaman, paladin or druid".
---
 Hell, if I say I want to roll a Ret paladin in Classic, half the sub will want spit on me.
---
I'd say the opposite. Shadow Priests and Druids tend to have an easier time against rogues than most. Their physical damage mitigation in Shadow and Bear Form helps a lot to survive rogues Stun locks (yes you will use Bear Form even as a caster Druid).
---
If you really, truly hate rogues I'd urge you to consider Orc Demonology Warlock for 40% physical damage reduction and 30% chance to resist their stuns.
---
Happy hunting!
---
That still makes me giggle like a mad man.
---
shutup cry baby warrior that thinks every single drop in the game was meant for them.........
---
&gt; and little ol scarlet monestary hiding up in the top right.
---
Nice! I'm just not positive on when to use my hearthstone most efficiently/effectively.
---
I don't think they will do that because this needs remodelling of the map, and I guess they use the old one.
---
The world first might get a shout out on Twitter or something, the community however will probably spam general chat when the realm first happens like they usually do. But yes, I have heard some guilds are prepping the 1-60 run and pushing the first raids as fast as possible on fresh pservers, a majority of hardcore players already know what to do though.

---
Lol I know I have seen it many a time, it's a classic! Just took me until the end of the first paragraph to recognize it lol.
---
Well all world firsts happened 13-15 years ago, so that won't happen.  
---
That said, there is definitely a population of Classic players that enjoy going as hardcore as possible in every way - clearing MC during the second week after launch, clearing all other raids on launch day, pre-farming the entire AQ war effort before it even starts, etc.  
---
However, and this is purely my opinion/speculation, there will probably be hardly any servers with more than one hardcore guild like that, if at all. Coupled with the fact that Vanilla raids are pretty simple in terms of mechanics (I'm avoiding the word *easy* to not incur the wrath of the "private servers are nowhere near as hard as Vanilla was" crowd), it's pretty unlikely that server-contained rivalries will form.  
---
The only competitive form of PvE I can see happening is straight up speedrunning entire raid instances and comparing with everyone else's times, not just your particular server's.
---
From my (limited) knowledge mages can out gold farm rogues considerably in the end game. There's multiple dungeons in the end game mages can AOE farm where rogues make much less stealthing in and pick pocketing. 
---
I played a main rogue in vanilla and it was fun, but from what I can tell mages have slightly higher quality of life. Portals cut down on travel time, AOE farming / grinding is superior, access to unlimited food and water is a very nice bonus. 
---
With a rogue you really need to keep up your first aid skill and constantly bandage to limit down time. Rogues gear up really well in early raids, are super fun in world pvp and have great single target dps. 
---
&gt; Many people think that #changers will be the downfall of this game
---
I agree, having focus target, equipment manager, class colored nameplates, search function for your bags will definitely ruin the game for everyone. /s
---
The hunter BM levelling talents are pretty straight forward. You don't have any spare points for spirit bond or bestial discipline - they're very weak talents. http://classicdb.ch/?talent#cx0Gdtxot
---
Is this a reference to something? I don't get it :(
---
You might not want to divulge your secrets, but do you head back to Darkshore or go into Westfall at 12? So you did 1-12 in 4hr then 12-20 in another 5hr29min? 9 1/2 hours to 20 is preeeettttyy good.
---
Damn dude I bought it when it came out! Im not very sure but I think it was around 100$
---
It now selling 400 to 700 on ebay
---
I believe it's attack speed too, but quite minor. 10-30% depending on how damaged you are.
---
Downvotes came from a bunch of retail nerds who think everything should be handed to them. 
---
You’re a retard. No one makes a macro for one click 
---
When Classic releases, you'll most likely find all addons you need on curse or wowinterface.        
---
ElvUI/tukUI are neat-o ui overhauls that aren't on those sites, they make it easy to customize actionbars and unit frames etc, but the minimalist style isn't for everyone.
---
I get my 40 mount but at 60 I always save for my epic gnome mech mount. I think that mount is the best looking thing, with the sound muted though. Sounds like optimus prime knocking one out.
---
Yes, that's exactly the type of mentality I am tired of seeing as well.  One of my real life friends wants to play a ret paladin when classic comes out and I told him to go for it.  I will happily group with him.  I don't know if either of us will actually make it to raiding this time around (I hope so, but life is busier than it used to be)... but if we do, I hope it's an option for him in some guild somewhere.  
---
nah its like 2g or something to train i think 
---
It all depends upon the person, some just level one character, and that's it. Other, like me, are altaholics who level many.  The OP was hinting at a two or three character build, with Paladin, Hunter and Rogue, so I gave him an example of a pretty self sufficient levelling scheme that would meet his requirements.
---
Mine will be that, plus some extra ones, I like to cover all the bases:
---
Hunter - Leatherworking/Engineering/Fishing/Cooking
---
Priest - Tailoring/Enchanting
---
Mage - Herbalism/Alchemy
---
goblino ear
---
Every progression guild will gear up 2-3 warriors at the same time with defense gear. 1 Main tank and 1-2 off-tanks. 
---
It depends on your definition of 'viable', of course. Hunters, for instance, had suboptimal DPS in any spec. The fewer Mages and the more Hunters you had, the worse shape the raid was in. Similarly, while it is nice to have more battle rez and Innervates, Druid healing (slow ass Healing Touch) was not very good by comparison to other healers.
---
These kinds of specs are 'viable' in that they can provide some utility and do their job *okay*, and with 40 slots (as you note) you can afford to carry some folks who aren't contributing as much, but they're not 'viable' as in competitive with the other people doing the same jobs.
---
It is affected, but the Global Cooldown is 1.5 sec and not affected by haste. Haste adds 0 DPS to Mind Blast because it already has a 1.5 sec cast time.
---
Yeah I would be interested in a full map of this too! Looking forward to seeing it.
---
Yes it is going to happen but there will be no achievement other than people knowing who did it. People like to pretend this wont happen because "the world firsts happened in vanilla" but this is vanilla 2.0. The try hards will compete for who can kill Rag first.
---
It's both. I teach middle school aged kids and they just don't understand how busy gamers are treated now and it's the money they spend, really anyone under 25 spends without questioning it, that keeps the industry stagnant as it is. Yes, it's wrong, but us "old folks" aren't going to convince them that they are getting screwed. hopefully the kids 5 years younger get a better experience and wake up to it 
---
I don't think boys who think about wow classic are thinking about sex /s
---
Lotta people said that about wow in general when it launched.  If they were telling the truth, they said that they would run classic even if only 10 people show up.  There are still thousands of people playing everquest.  I’m willing to bet 10 years from now I’ll still be rolling alts in classic along with thousands of other alt-o-holics.   I’ll bet theres a few no lifers out there that want to get grand marshal twice.  I think it has massive potential.  
---
I think they could hit the reset button and do a reboot of the entire franchise with better graphics, insert a few new easter eggs, make the raid bosses slightly harder and they’d sell millions of subs all over again.  Just look at hollywood making billions rebooting the same franchises over and over again.  
---
Anyhow I’m hoping to get to do it all, every class and both factions and have plenty of time to do it in.  :)
---
This is not correct information- it does add DPS, but not in a rotation. If MB deals 1k dmg, and you get it down to 1.2 seconds, it goes from 750 dps to 890 (roughly, didn't use a calc) but again, MB has a cooldown and like you said, global can't be reduced. This is good for when you are chasing and need to get some dps and continue running.
---
You literally need at least 2 Tranq Shots and 2 Resto Druids is preferable to 1 or 0. Their numbers on the meters aren't the reason you bring them, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't be in the raid.
---
I don't get the cenarion circle one 
---
Yes I’v sunk 230 hours into Anthem. Yes I’m so over their poor design choices. Yes I’m now back on the Classic WoW hype train
---
Nobody can defeat bubble hearth!
---
If you are a resto druid you won't be asked to tank. 
---
Dem hippies.
---
I thought u got a green item at least
---
Cenarion circle are druids, druids are treehuggers and nature nutjobs.
---
Its a "classic horde gang bang" meme, with a sprinkle of horde favoritism ideology. It comes from [this](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Di_mYzxXoAAJtE8.jpg) Kevin Durant meme

Having fun playing moonkin is not a mistake
---
PSA: Buzzbox quests are quite honestly the cancer of Darkshore.  
---
I, a professional Minecraft Linguist, have found some errors in your comment and have recrafted it. 
---
 &gt;psa: buzzChest quests are quite honestly the cancer of darkshore.  
---
Nothing more satisfying  than making a pally pop it though
---
Never said it was. (: but trying to play moonkin in a serious raiding guild may be difficult. 
---
Just stay away form Darnassus for a while.
---
If you can get to 60 in under 6 days /played I’m willing to bet you know your class very well.
---
does flask of  petrification drop combat?
---
If you’re trying to level fast at launch you better beat the curve in the first 16 hours and keep the momentum alive
---
You can get stats but you can't see your overall stats because there is no stats screen our something like that.
---
If lock had aspect of the cheetah they would easily be the fastest leveller in the game.
---
Question about all the gear in this list: 
---
Which other class can "need" items from it?
---
Is druid wanted gear has some pieces desirables for every class or are some excluded?
---
World firsts happened 15 years ago. 
---
Doesnt seem like too long ago WoW taught me what LOL, ROFLMAO and BRB was... 
---
It's possible, say if the person has played it before. But someone who literally grinds or follows a guide and gets 60 as fast as possible will NOT know that class like someone who ran quests and dungeons, and learned all the ins and outs on how to stay alive, and when and where to do what needs to be done, how to hold aggro for a tank, how to avoid aggro for a DPS class, how to effectively heal a group for a healer. It's just not possible if you never played it before... 
---
is that trinket actually worth the grind? I always wanted it back in the day
---
Having some required utility does not make your *spec* viable. Any Hunter can do Tranq Shots and any Druid can BRez and Innervate.
---
Maybe priest. Paly and shaman have lots of ways they can maximise their game with their hybrid abilities and buffs, druid is quite tricky and struggles a bit with poor gear. Priest you have like 4 healing spells and they're all pretty good, hard to go wrong.

This is why I ganked warlocks of all levels.
---
Iirc the order is decided by the English names. For example, Mages will always have Arcane/Fire/Frost, even though the Spanish translations Arcano/Fuego/Escarcha aren't in alphabetical order anymore. That said, there are quite a few Latin words that don't change much anyway (e.g. Discipline, disciplina, Disziplin...). 
---
Just imagine the confusion when two players who are using different localized clients want to compare specs and 0/0/51 is a frost build for one of them, but a fire build for the other player. 
---
Yeah I’d be rolling in it if battle.net balance=actual money. I’m not about to risk the months of work I put in to sell gold on the black market. 
---
But yes it sounds ridiculous but each account easily makes ~6k raw gold an hour, 3k in cloth and I got 5-10 boe’s which are worth 5-10k usually but Teebus still sells for 75k and the rings/trinkets still sell for up to 50k.
---
So yes it takes about 10 hours to pay all of my subs!
---
Which categorically means that they don't have 0 viable specs, which was your original claim. Thanks for proving my point. Have a nice day.
---
Exactly this. Particularly fights which are decurse heavy.
---
I think the great part of vanilla is hybrid classes can throw on a spec relevant gear set and still perform suitably to get the job done.
---
Obviously you're never going to top any metres and is probably not advisable for AQ40/Naxx, but certainly there's fun to be had in the early raids.
---
“Just because it doubled the player base doesn’t matter, because the population started to decrease by the end! Obviously that means it lower the population overall!” 
---
You’re obviously super biased against Wrath and won’t see how ridiculous your argument is, but whatever. 
---
I do not like LC. 
---
Tried a raiding guild in a vanilla p server, one of the 3 main tanks in the guild.... . But the LC was ran by a group of friends, two of which were fury warrs, and the other two were the two other tanks and the main healer ... I was still in a mish mosh of Ony/MC/UBRS gear and fucking dungeon gear trying to tank Naxx40, because the two fury warrs got ALL the good tanking gear. Our two other tanks were getting the T3 drops, then the two fury warrs, then it was me. The prot specced warr using dungeon gear ffs. It burnt me out man
---
YEAH BUT PRIVATE SERVERS ARE EXTREMELY WRONG AND NOT EVEN CLOSE TO RIGHT THOUGH GOD DON'T YOU KNOW ANYTHIHNG HURHURHURHURHUR
---
Not sure how accurate this is, but this is what ive found for post raid bis for fury warr.
---
Lionsheart Helm - Head - crafted BS - 2% crit 2% hit
---
Stormrage's Talisman of Seething - Neck - drop Kel'Thuzad 40 - 2% crit

The Hungering Cold - Weapon 2 - Kel Thuzad 40 - +6 swords
---
Pretty sure Druids are better than warrior pre-raid gear. Don't forget you're also relying on drop RNG for your warriors to get raid geared too.
---
Darkshore is a very strong 12-20 lvling zone though, much better than westfall/loch, has more than double their quests, and usually less populated. So even with the run for a human (which you'd have to do at some point anyway) it's probably well worth it if efficiency is all you care about. 
---
"I hate being wanted due to my debuffs as a debuffer class"
---
This is why the game and class design is in the state it's currently in on retail.
---
History REALLY will repeat itself, lol.
---
I knew about that mount. But was worried about riding skill.
---
Then, my RL friend told me "but you don't need it to summon that mount" - that was my happiest day in life. Even though I wasn't even close to 40.
---
Well yeah, if you're using the second best farming method in the game for your last several levels, you might conceivably get enough. 
---
I was talking about just playing the game normally by questing, doing dungeons and such.
---
They built the game that way intentionally, everything has it's limits. The only classes that have one spec that is "optimal" in pvp and pve are healing specced healers. That being said, fury PvP is pretty solid just not quite as good.
---
You can overcome it by grinding the gold to respec a lot. Or respec only once a month so the cost stays low. (That's the timeframe right? The cost goes back down one level after a month?)
---
Level both to 60 and see which you like more! :)
---
It's called nightfall!!! 
---
Started on Shattered Hand at launch as well. I played horde though. I take a look later and see if I’m in any of the screenshots :p
---
I go to a place that has 5 "kill 10" of A, B, C, D, E --- and I spend 5:29 killing neutral F mobs that everyone ignores for 8 levels.
---
If you end up deciding on rogue, orc probably has the best racials in the game for pvp. Just worth considering, if you are between troll and orcs and like both of their looks already, orc is tops for pvp racials.
---
Undead is good too, and probably best for mage (since orcs can’t be mages).
---
I’m not saying to prioritize racials over looks, but I don’t want you thinking undead are master race for rogue racials.
---
How did loot work in groups though? Would we have to kill the same quest mob multiple times in order for everyone to get the loot drop?
---
Shhh!
---
Yeah, I'm already reading up on Shamens, just in case. 
---
In the meantime: DRUIDS ARE TERRIBLE, don't play them!
---
On my servers in vanilla and TBC the elite/"elitists" were just very choosy about who they ran dungeons with. People knew that certain tanks, healers and DPS were competent and they were the ones they invited to UBRS or heroic mode dungeons or whatever. If you were part of that in-group you got frequent invitations and if you weren't then you probably didn't know that clique existed.
---
I think what's different here is that on these forums you meet and interact with those people, whereas on retail if you were a casual derping around with a meme spec you would not.
---
Are you serious, or are you just trying to stroke my epeen for more secrets, cause [there's this](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ahd453/dumb_friday_math_hearth_for_rest_vs_camp/)
---
I think what matters the most is the kind of guild you create/join those will be the people that you will spend most of your time with. And i'm sure there will be "tryhards" that want to min-max everything possible, but that is what they find enjoyable about the game. What i'm trying to say is, we shouldn't take away what others find enjoyable about the game.
---
I know that when classic comes around i'll be rolling on an rp server most likely, since it's my impression that those servers are where most of the laidback people are. I will also join a leveling guild and at 60 change guild to a casual raiding guild if the leveling guild doesn't turn into one.
---
I went 30/0/21 what a nostalgia trip 
---
Same way you logged into Stormwind on 14 October 2008 and the king was back, sporting anime hair and two magical swords. No ingame explanations, it all happened in some mangas.
---
Or broken tooth ...
---
Orcs were mostly on board with the whole "Apartheid state" thing...
---
Not that I take post-Wrath lore seriously, but this is part of that.
---
Because it's not necessary to give everybody in the raid a healthstone since the raids are easy now compared to back then. There are also more warlocks now, it wasn't uncommon back then to only have one or two locks in the raid at which point they probably have to farm a bit. You'll also collect shards during the raid so even if you spend a lot of shards at the start summoning, making a few healthstones etc. You'll regain those shards during the raid. 
---
There are exceptions though. Loatheb in Naxx pretty much requires healthstones on the entire raid so progressing on him is a pain in the ass. 
---
I'd say a more annoying thing is that you have to carry multiple gear sets into raids in addition to all your consumables, soulshards etc. When I was tanking Twins in AQ40 I had my main dps set, nature resistance set, shadow resistance tanking set, trash set for extra survivability, elixirs of shadow power, greater arcane elixirs, gift of arthas, food buffs, flasks, wizard oil and the list goes on. Really hard to make room for it all when you also have to have a shit ton of shards.
---
Feral druids are really good tanks and decent melee dps. A tank specced and geared feral druid will perform about as well as a warrior (with a few exceptions) and will outdps a prot specced and geared warrior going fury when not required to tank. Feral druids also do a lot more TPS (threat per second) than a warrior which is really nice. Tank healing is quite easy in vanilla so many tanks equip dps items to boost their threat, but a feral druid can go really defensive and still do monster TPS. On fights like Thaddius this is really important. Another thing is that a feral druid's threat scales with gear while a warrior's sunder armor does the same amount of threat in during MC and Naxx.
---
who is that?
---
Yeah that's really the worst part. Bioware will just bounce back, right? NOPE! Seven years is far back enough that they started making the game near the end of ME3 and probably had ideas floating around during the ME2 era. So the shitty EA corruption goes way way back. I doubt they'd be able to release a super high caliber game again. 
---
Definitely not from me. I don't know him, I've never ever seen him in my life, and his guards forced me to sneak around when trying to do that Lunar Festival elders.
---
Lol what are you talking about? You can easily go 1-60 without needing to needing to grind. You are the one spreading misinformation. 
---
Ah, the ol grinderoo.
---
til Reykjavíkur 
---
Brought to you by the hunters gang.
---
Being in a raid guild brings prestige and that loot is otherwise impossible to obtain without a guild. Just being able to complete the raid is a monumental achievement. The loot is simply a means to an end. 
---
Owls are better than Gorillas (Screech generates aoe threat more consistently).
---
Cats are better in raid for your personal dps with good pet management, wolfs are easier to use though.
---
big upvote and reported for reporting for Cenarion Circle.
---
Also, what does Syndicate have to do with Deeprun Tram?
---
I got the idea when I was behind the pack for K3 launch.
---
1-10 was ~6-8 hour norm cause congestion. I did 7 hours, but went into a super populated 10-20 zone and had no competition due to an idea I had. Even with 100+ people in the zone, it was uncontested. I'll continue that, since the XPH is fantastic, and I hope it's still uncontested.
---
Depends on the spec and class. Some of the crafted gear is used by healadins. I play alliance. Shamans may use some too but I don't know about them. I don't have the list for every class so I don't know what is bis for all. I know some of the staves for resto ( staff of the ruins from AQ20 for instance) are wanted/needed by caster dps. It just so happens that that particular item is best for restos at that particular stage of content. If you can get it cool but I doubt you will. You just need to look up bis lists for the rest of the classes to know what they want.

Why quest for 10,000 xp an hour when I can watch Battlestar Galactica and mindlessly grind for 20,000 xp an hour?
---
Yeah, I've always used 'gank' in that kind of sense. 
---
Like, if I'm a Rogue and I stealth behind you, and do the whole song and dance and burst you down, that's a 'gank' to me. 
---
If I'm the same Rogue but we run into each other and I'm not Stealthed, but then I Vanish and do the song and dance - that's not a 'gank', that was just plain old fighting.
---
Ganking to me is very much the unexpected attack when your guard is down (to a degree). Not necessarily because you're way lower, or because your weakened, but just because there was no warning.
---
That's in the back of everyone's mind for sure. 
---
See, I've always picked the chest and then let the party roll on whatever item was in it.
---
All the whites and vendor trash are mine though. That's my fee.
---
I meant unforgiving of blizzard wrecking the lore and killing him like that

Textbook paladin leveling strats. +rep
---
Why is someone putting players in my massively single player game.
---
"blizzard engineered social relationships based on ingame roles. "
---
I really like this aspect of classic wow that I rarely see in any games. 
---
Of course being a rogue I just ganked everyone and played solo most the time until I wants to raid
---
...
---
But I remember every warrior was either friendly or am asshole. A friendly warriors tells new rogues not to Expose Armor because it messes with Sunder. A jerk warrior just curses out the rogue expecting them to know everything. Like, chill man this is the barrens. People aren't going to know everything when their still in the barrens!
---
I cannot wait to Garrote &amp; Rupture some Protection pallies though I tell you what. Ooowie I'm gonna stick em and run. 
---
🎶Stick em and run, stick em and run,
---
Killing prot Paladins is so much fun,
---
Can't reflect damage if it's already done,
---
Gotta get rep so I stick em and run🎶
---
It's actually called Nightfall. It's in Affliction.

Agreed

Will my gf accept raid nights twice a week or three? We'll have been going out for around 15 months at this point :/

Just triggering some folks :)

Waiting for the downvotes to stack up.

PSA to all:
---
If someone buffs you, that's great!
---
If someone doesn't buff you, that's okay too, because you can't expect everyone to buff you!
---
But they LOVE me in that tunnel.
---
Oh, so that's why I hear lots of moaning and squicky sounds every time I get close to the tunnel.
---
Main to level with a friend, farming alt to play when he is offline to fund our mounts, 29 Twink disc priest. And bank alts. 
---
Tl:Dr - No. 
---
I feel like I am getting the wrong image of the kind right now...
---
Trailing on from this, what’s the etiquette for rogues with locked chests and lockbox drops in dungeons? I’m going to play one but I want to avoid falling into the scumbag rogue stereotype. The way I plan on doing it, I’d unlock chests and let players roll on any boes inside, and need on all lock boxes, open them up and then ask the group to roll. Is this right or are the rules different?
---
BT had a 1.00 attack speed in 1.12
---
wait in what way does engineering help a paladin in raids? it is good vs mobs while leveling and fantastic in pvp, but in raids, what does the proffesion have?
---
anyway im maining paladin and thought of alch and herb because you will get those juicy potions while leveling and make good money when 60/spend less money buying mats in AH and then making them yourself, so it sounds really good
---
PSA: If you don't buff me, fuck you you piece of shit, who hurt you? Why can't you just unmount, run back to me and buff me? "buff pls" whispers is not a request, its an order! Better get it into your mind now that this friendly service is required, not optional.

Video was frapsed 5dec 2006, few hrs before 2.0 patch. 2012 is just upload date.

P.S. raid marker icons present in vanilla, and thats called oRA2 and AGUnitFrames addons ;-)
---
My current methodology and tests lead to level 26 at 16:30 - Level 30 by 24 hours.
---
1-20 uncontested in 10 hours should put me near the head of the pack.
---
You've inspired me. I've been really burnt out on planning lately, but I think I'm going to get back into it now. 
---
Spanish here... will probably play in a spanish server... who knows, maybe i get to hang out IRL with my guildies, just like my father and brother 13 years ago...
---
this guy gets it
---
&gt; kindle the hype flame 
---
Thank you, ashen one. Hehehehe
---
&gt; Make a Dwarf Hunter. To hell with low raid DPS, I just want the fantasy. Me, my gun, my animal and a fascination toward engineering. Master my class, mind my pet. I have my looks chosen already, the type of beard, mix of skin and hair color. Dark skin and grey-ish beard looks cool, especially with the lategame gear. Never to display my helmet, of course! 
---
My third character in WOW, which I got to level cap. I have no idea why, and I remember how I hated it. I hated the voice, the size, the animations of my character, everything. And, all that for one reason - because my pet kept losing aggro :D
---
Also, the 3.1 built-it threat meters. Damn, that was a nightmare. My guild required me to keep it on, but I always had to turn it off when soloing, because it was just extremely frustrating. The loud TUDU TRIRIRI TUTRI TURURU all the time, everytime my pet lost aggro. Literally like putin' my ear right next tae a breakin' atomic reactor. 
---
After leveling that huntard, I quit WOW for 2 months, and never read any dwarf quest text for the next year, until the trauma faded.
---
I still love dwarf lore. But Night Elf more.
---
&gt;Play it slow. I'll probably do a few same-lvl zones, just to experience them once more. Dun Morogh-&gt;Loch Modan (afternoons in this zone are stunning - the mixture of pink-ish skies with the lush green hills and roaming rams just gets me!)-&gt;Duskwood-&gt;Redridge, I don't know what's next. Do every quest for every dungeon, know it's history, the lore behind all the instances.
---
Yes. After having some financial problems during vanilla, and getting into the world of private server terminology, I learned what "XP x2" or "XP x3" means... and thought "it would be epic to see an XP x0.5 server". Yes, the vanilla leveling pace was too fast for me, even back then.
---
This time, I'll make 2 characters - one which I will level to 60, and one to do its own starting areas - Elwynn, Westfall, Redridge. Duskwood, that brings memories. Damn, so many memories. Why Duskwood? I have no idea. I feel like it was in Duskwood, when I realized the beauty and freedom of this game. It was in Duskwood, when I started to think about which item should I equip. It was in Duskwood, when I started paying attention to my stats. It was in Duskwood, when I got my first spell power item.
---
It was in Duskwood, when I caught the true liking to this game.
---
&gt;Read the quest texts, talk to the non-questgiver NPC's. Enjoy the views, make a few screenshots. Cherish the low lvl gear look on my dwarf. Crappy leather and \[Aboriginal Cape\] on my back - hell yeah! Dwarves are the best looking characters on low levels, especially all of the shieldbearers. I envy you, Ironforge Paladins and Warriors (if you ever decide to lvl up with your shield)!
---
Yes. I will always remember the hot Night Elf girl which I dated atop Aldrassil, gazing at the romantic moonset. I still have the screenshot on my old harddisk. Damn, I'm flying to my old home tomorrow, hopefully that disk is still intact.
---
And, I always red the dialog NPCs say when I click them. Not just the quest texts, but what they say before I choose a quest.
---
&gt;Level up all my professions (mining/engineering and all of the secondary ones) as I lvl up my hunter. Catch some fish while chatting on /1 or maybe discord, if there's going to be one for my RP-PVP server (which I have to pick yet, let's wait for the list! That's gonna be one hell of an important choice). Or do some breathing exercises.
---
believe me or not, it's not going to happen with cooking. I've always leveled new characters with that in mind - and I always stopped, when my bank was full of \[Coyote Meat\] from Westfall, and my skill was not enough to process them.
---
&gt;Leave the Classic UI. Maybe play some with the scale, maybe but a rare/elite dragon frame around my character's bar, but fill my bars with huge, colorful icons, separating consumables, pet commands, tools and so forth!
---
No. Leave them in bags. As I was doing back them. From time to time, a health potion appeared on my actionbars, but that's all. But yes, keep the classic UI. I've had a time when playing around with CTmod, Bongos (sorry /u/AutoModerator if I offend you), nUI, and other addons. I remember that fun when someone asked me to pick up a flag, and I said "can't, I have action bars in the middle of my screen", because I realized I cannot move them in combat (it was in TBC, though, and I was in EOTS)
---
&gt;Get a lvling, casual guild, that does believe, that we don't need all the minmaxers (with all due respect to you, guys - I know, that for some it's the fun way to play) to be succesful in raids or PvP. We may not be the best, maybe we'll only kill Ragnaros - but it may be more meaningful experience for us, than murdering Kel'Thuzad for some. Exchange items, do some party raids on Horde, just for the sake of it. Maybe provoke some major mayhem.
---
Not my thing. I'll probably form my own, casual guild - but not necessarily a leveling guild. A social guild. Minmaxing will be the step towards better performance in raids, but it will be up to everyone individually. However, there will be some responsiblities - such as getting that \[Fire Resistance Potion\]
---
&gt;Maybe replay W3+TFT and watch the gameplays for W1+W2 for the sake of getting deeper into the aesthetics and lore.
---
Done twice last year, plus hours of [battle.net](https://battle.net) ranked play
---
&gt;Engage in official forum discussion, give some feedback to Acti... I mean, Blizzard. Show them, what kind of community they brought back to life, so they see the point to invest in it some more. Maybe progressive realms some day?
---
If we have official forums... I mean old good World of Warcraft forums
---
Not having to deal with China, Russia (mostly) and the US will be so nice.

At retail armor debuffs  stack and are additive...
---
[https://i.imgur.com/kOeIZRI.png](https://i.imgur.com/kOeIZRI.png) w/o FF... Wanna make calculations yourself? 505 aditional armor red dmg from 92 to 84 because armor reducing debuffs stacks additively!
---
So your big post dont have any sense.
---
Curse / Twitch app will almost certainly have a setting for classic addons.
---
We don't have a *confirmed* guideline for classic addons, though. We assume the code/structure/tos will be similar to retail (7.3.5 specifically) -- but it's not confirmed yet.
---
Yeah I know, thats why I wondered if there's some tricky way of dropping combat I could reliably use, since I really miss being able to save everyone a corpse run. I was hoping I didn't know of one but alas, I think I'm screwed as a druid.
---
Hmm. Comments from 3.x+ say it doesn't, but comments from 2.4 and under say it do. 
---
An expensive way to do it for sure, but I think you just gave me an answer how to do it, thanks!
---
Greater Blessing of Wisdom forever.
---
If you're a hunter, every point of mana counts.
---
Yeah but Org / UC are not the greatest cities to look at or navigate, compared with Stormwind and Ironforge
---
Roll on what you can use that you want just dont be the feral that rolls on healing gear becasue "at level 47 im going resto" too many people like that around already. 
---
You will need to roll on cloth gear. 
---
The Un'goro escort quest, and that eternal war
---
Me too *gently Pat's potato*
---
That won't happen though. The good thing about Joana's guide is that it skips Westfall. Which is where the vast majority of players will gravitate because it's part of the natural zone progression for anybody that rolls a Human, Dwarf, or Gnome. Running for 15-30 minutes to reach Darkshore isn't on most less experienced players agenda.
---
Not to mention how through completing dark shore you naturally lead in to several Ashenvale quest chains.
---
IIRC it actually has decent healing and does a wrath spell I think. If you really wanted to try hard with 40 battle chickens and that thing I bet it could be a great DPS boost raid wide lol. 
---
Actually, playing a paladin in TBC left such a bad taste in my mouth, that I could log on my paladin only 3 years after. Now I've grown a thicker skin and just /laugh and /ignore %username, but it was a really painful experience back then.
---
You’re free to play however you want, just like how everyone else is free to not invite you to their group once you get a bad reputation on your server.
---
Now I want a cel shades mod for wow classic &gt;.&lt;
---
Ahh it seems you've hit the make or break part of your relationship.
---
https://imgur.com/a/y798Z0N
---
Pretty sure you have no clue. Warriors will always be required on every single raid boss on progression for Shield wall alone. My retail vanilla guild always min-maxed. We used a Tauren Warrior on every single boss from Ony to KT. 
---
lol might be more handy in a duel or something, not sure if it's worth grinding the ~5k mobs
---
What's the thing with all the PSAs recently that tell other classes how to buff/treat hunters? 🤔
---
Even asking warriors for their meat kek
---
The Defias Traitor turns alliance players against escorts pretty early.
---
Ok buddy
---
ok, main shaman here. idk how you play but paying 600g for hand of edward is like NP, and if you want to seriously pvp you need a chunk of gold income for LIPs etc. 
---
You saying improved ankh being bad triggers me so hard i actually didnt want to respond to this, but since your last sentence was "improved ankh LOL" i just had to.
---
Idk how you play but i bet my ass you arent doing a lot of wpvp  with groups or even solo. The improved ankh is invaluable, to trade it of for 2 points into  ancestral healing is in my opinion not worth it. The times where the extra armor will save you/your teammates is not justified by how many times the ankh will turn the fight in your favor.
---
and searing totem, yes its good for caster duels if you have the room to get it off , there are times though where you will not have the GCD to spare if oyu get nuked hard, and it's defintatley not the reason why you are good vs them, key is to not eat the counterspell   , or hopefully let grounding eat the deathcol (which is rare vs  not-retarded locks ofc). 
---
Is that Unbreakable from US Frostmane?
---
Hunter epic quest is super-vulnerable to griefing. If anyone else tags it, at all, the demon killls the hunter and sulks for three hours.
---
Quick run to SW and tram. 5 minutes for IF to wetlands skip. I just ran a level 1 Human from Northshire Abbey to Auberdine in 16 minutes 20.
---
It's not that bad, and Darkshore &gt; Westfall for leveling hands down.
---
Now the plurals for both.
---
18 hours a day... ffs
---
&gt;Shah-men, not Shay-man
---
Preraid bis ? This is a BIS list it's not pre raid.
---
Share with the class once you do.
---
I've worked deals with a more casual guild before that allowed me to stay a arms+prot spec for offtanking and pvp. It's possible. 
---
yep, it is almost always better to prio experience and grind later.
---
Nope. You can't drop combat to shadowmeld. The best you can hope for is  paladin (assuming you are alliance) to DI you. Or in raids you BR a priest/paladin before you die and they wait until the boss is reset to take the rez. Boom. You saved a runback without dropping combat.
---
it actually does't and it is worth it to go darkshore at least for dwarf/gnome(and that isn't much longer than human).
---
Lots of good fresh levelers go darkshore as dwarf/gnome.
---
Vanilla isn't an expansion
---
EU servers released in 2005
---
That is what they do best.
---
I think world chat gives people a bad impression.
---
Lot of circlejerking here, but i’m gonna rush hard to 60, get preraid, kill bosses and get epics. 
---
Also wtf?
---
&gt;	fill my bars with huge, colorful icons, separating consumables, pet commands, tools and so forth!
---
Who wrote this lmao
---
Lmao have you seen the sub Reddit for anthemthegame. 90% of the post are people being negative about the game.lmao I pre ordered the game myself. Can’t wait for summer 2019
---
?
---
&gt; To put things into perspective. Some of the fastest MC clear times from back in the day were 1½ hours with guilds actually trying to speedrun and having great gear. Nowadays you can clear MC with good gear, in 30~ minutes if you're dedicated.
---
Pirate server players see themselves clearing MC three times as fast as the best of the best ever could in real vanilla and say "This is *totally* Blizzlike, we are just so much better than anyone who ever played real vanilla!".
---
Everyone else goes "Hmm, do you think just maybe this might not be totally Blizzlike?".
---
It always blows my mind how often people mispronounce things in WoW. 
---
&gt; Now the main problem with feral druid tank is the itemization. There is a lack of defence gear for druids. You also don't have access to certain cooldown warrior has.
---
Yes, it changes with AQ and its int+agi hybrid sets.
---
&gt; That dps aura 
---
are you talking about oomkin?
---
&gt; Most of the people shouting about class viability, have not experienced themselves what the pros/cons of classes are. 
---
Druid is extremely viable as a supporter. Basically, someone that can heal when needed, dps when not, and tank in times of emergency, and also \[Rebirth\], \[Thorns\] the tank, \[Mark of the Wild\] everyone, CC beasts and dragonkin, decurse, run with movement speed boost. But, the truth about Druid viablity, lies in Warsong Gulch.
---
Neutral vendor?
---
if it's week nights I don't see the big issue, just set aside some definite days to hang with her
---
Yes, it’s polite to ask others to roll, and it will make you friends.
---
Haha wow, not sure how I didnt see that before. And I'm not sure why people upvoted me!
---
I would absolutely love to see some proof either way
---
IMHO in levelling dungeons you are a dick if you roll on things other people want to level with.
---
A druid healer rolling on the Robe of Arugal is a dick because at that point you should be levelling in leather with strength and agility. Whereas for a cloth-wearer it is optimal for levelling.
---
If you are gearing up to heal at sixty it's totally different.
---
Definitely ask, or wait and see what others do. Rude people may need immediately, and you can see that, and then need yourself. But in some cases, you really should expect others to need, even if it is technically bad manners, so play conservatively. Never greed too past.
---
I've played on a private server several years ago, and the community was a lot more chill, than back then. The guild let me into Onyxia's Lair, with 2fps and level 58 - and I wasn't like well-known for them, just a new recruit.
---
Back then, when I had 20fps, my guild refused to take me and told me to replace my "wooden computer".
---
If you have proof of consistent hate from the retail community towards classic, please provide it. Otherwise you’re just yelling with your fingers in your ears like a child. 
---
Yep! Horde and alliance accessable
---
\#nightelfmasterrace
---
&gt;	Players that rush to 60 (or worse, bought level 60s) didn't really know their class that well, IMO.
---
I’ll take: ‘Shit that bad players say for 500, Alex’
---
Boar. Always boar.
---
It depends on the mob but I think most named quest mobs have a 100% drop rate and drop for the whole group. Quests like "fetch so and so's head" should drop for everyone but "get 20 lion livers" might not.
---
yep I worded that wrong
---
Completely agree
---
this map looks similar to an old game I used to play before WOW came.
---
Even though it was a shit, buggy Russian RTS, that they had to give away, because nobody wanted to buy it. Well, that's how I got my hands on it.
---
BTW, it's Stranglethorn Vale. Feels quite weird without the maelstorm in the middle, and without split into 2 parts.
---
During one of the later expansions I actually kicked the shit out of Ravenholm until the Syndicate stopped being hostile. 
---
Why do you think so? Because of Tipsout?
---
Proofs says it stacked same way as it does at pservers ;-)
---
Innervate used to be a talent... so we were forced to go Resto...
---
Bear form gave approx half the armor it does in 1.12 so basically you couldn’t even tank 5 mans.
---
All in all now if you go super try hard you can dps as feral and keep up with other hybrids and off tanks. For the most part 95% of all druids now will be healing in raids and back then 100% of druids would be healing in raids. Not much change really.
---
This is stuff you exploit and doesnt share :/
---
I know, I've been sitting on this for a while. But has to be known to at least the privileged few who frequent this sub.
---
I'm going to be playing the same except 5. I can't stand the default UI.  
---
I am however going to be recreating my old Vanilla UI if I can.
---
I've been talking to people on the pserver  I'm doing test runs on, so far 11/12 all are planning to do both pve and pvp as both the traditional builds and the meme ones to try to see what we may have missed 14 years ago.
---
They all agree too that were gonna go slow and enjoy it and let the elite full clear content week 2 and 3 and well just show up a few weeks later in UBRS and crafted stuff + whatever else we want and do a solid Group 2 push pug style or ride their gear lol, so far everyone I know is going hella chill and is just looking forward to the experience, and getting a rare chance to have fore knowledge but get a do over.
---
I like using boar for for leveling because it'll eat dam near anything, I even tried feeding it a grey boot I got from fishing.
---
War main from Vanilla through Cata here. Arms dps isn't that great but still better than many of the other subpar dps specs (ret pally/enhance shammy come to mind) . Getting a group is a giant pain in the ass rolling arms, even fury (non raid). 
---
Many people say to tank in fury or arms with a few prot talents (mainly the threat talent) and even last stand so you can do dungeons. While this is true, pugging as prot can be tough to maintain aggro with many of your dps not targetting correct mobs, breaking sheep's etc. So even with those talents arms tanking can be difficult without coordination.
---
Warriors are monsters when geared in any spec, but you have to realize that it will be difficult trying any non cookie cutter build in the wrong place. I was a main tank for my guild doing MC-aq40 and hated respeccing over and over because I loved arms so much. Eventually I went arms/port and felt gimped in pvp and in PVE tanking. 
---
TL:DR spec for whatever you are doing and roll with it. If you dislike it, respec all you like but you will get shit for not being cookie cutter at times
---
That's also true. It might be a bit harder to find a group than for a priest or shaman/paladin, but in vanilla at least there were few enough healers that you were never hurting for groups.
---
okay old man
---
Because you enjoy it.
---
Sko-low-mance....
---
Do you have any proof of them not being Blizzlike to the point where that could be the case for such fast times? The information of the server(s), at least the biggest ones, are known and worked on in open source projects. So the information is available to everyone, to prove what's right/wrong. 
---
&gt; Everyone else goes "Hmm, do you think just maybe this might not be totally Blizzlike?". 
---
Or it could be mostly because a huge majority nowadays actually try harder and know more of the game. Including using world buffs, DM buffs and what not, for even a MC clear. The game have been figured out and the meta game today in about any online game, is to look up guides and to at least to some extent, try to optimize your character/gameplay. There's a bunch of mechanics and items which a lot of people or even nobody actually knew the true 'value' of, back then. Obviously when min-maxing, your DPS is going to increase exponentially, which is partly why I believe it's so insanely high these days. Because people actually know what they're doing, much more than back then, but also understand itemization much better.
---
Are private servers 100% accurate? Not at all, but from what I can see, and the conclusion of many other people actually comparing whatever information we have from back then, it seems like it's pretty damn accurate. Not even remotely off, to the point where a majority of the insane DPS classes do nowadays is because of that. It's much more logical to expect higher DPS, because people got 10+ years of knowledge behind them.
---
Moreover, up until 1.10, we couldn't even use equipped items in forms (Like that crowd pummeler). 
---
Cat got adjusted at some point and didn't even scale with Agility until then. Also got an extra buff to attack power. 
---
Very early on, shapeshifting didn't get you out of a lot of things it now does. 
---
Omen of Clarity only worked in Caster form. Oh, and Balance druids didn't have moonkin form - Their final talent was Hurricane! 
---
Probably more I forget. We got buffs out the wazoo, but in the end, it didn't even matter :&lt;
---
When you zone in. You can accept a raid group invite without any problem, but if you zone in you'll be saved.
---
I don't believe their was a confirmation dialogue in vanilla but it has been a long time and I could be wrong.
---
i honestly think bear druids are better than warriors in most cases. the main limitation of progression in vanilla in a good guild is threat...
---
0.5) 10-59 druids are the best tank without question
---
1) druid itemization doesnt give a flying fadeleaf about defense. you operate through obscene amounts of health, sitting at the armor cap, and having a reasonably high amount of dodge that comes naturally. the more defense you try to force on yourself, the less tanky you become. druids have the literal primary highest stat/armor scalings in game for a reason
---
2) druids dont really need cooldowns. you can straight up tank huhuran through her enrage just fine. not even kidding about this
---
3) yes, druids are the best soaks
---
4) druids also dumpster warriors in terms of threat gen without having to use meme specs or taking off a shield
---
=========
---
ive played the bear druid and ive also had to heal the bear druid. i had 0 problems tanking anything as a bear. additionally, an extended stint as a resto shaman caused me to prefer healing bears
---
How do people mispronounce it? I mean its called Scholo for a reason lol. I had a guild master once pronounce Tanaris: Tanaree (think french Paris). I was like wut? The S is definitely pronounced. I think Blizz needs to make a video pronouncing everything in the game so people have no excuse anymore.
---
It will be a different experience compared to private servers. How much though is debatable. 
---
my first toon ever was a paladin and yeah...i didnt understand why everyone was so broke 
---
 ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 
---
I recall people pronouncing it "show-low-mance" all the time. 
---
to hijack with a real PSA im pretty sure battle shout spamming is a way of getting aggro on multiple mobs in classic
---
iirc it causes aoe aggro of which a warrior has limited options.
---
this is going off years old memories of a private server so that may not be true either
---
I didn’t think of it that way. I’ll have to change my stance 
---
Yeah. I hear youtubers still do that. I just want to shake them and tell them to read a book sometime. Clearly they don't read enough to know how to pronounce things correctly on sight.
---
&gt; Is it viable to progress to endgame PvE as an arms warr?
---
No. Arms wants to use 2handers, which are completely uncomparable to DW on alliance, and still worse on Horde (and the 2H PvE spec is still Fury, not Arms). Mortal Strike takes up a debuff slot while Bloodthirst doesn't. Fury also gets Flurry and Death Wish while Arms gets nothing comparable. If your definition of viable is looser than mine you could say an arms warrior is about as viable as an enhancement shaman or ret paladin.
---
&gt; Can one progress through PvE as a fury warrior then swap (permanently) to arms once post raid BiS is obtained. So what im really asking here is how different is post raid BiS between fury and arms? 
---
If you could handle getting post-raid BiS you could handle farming the gold to respec for PvP (also you wouldn't be waiting ~2 years to actually start PvPing). The gear you would want to use in PvE and PvP differ considerably and the gear you would want to use in PvE as DW Fury and Arms (2H) would as well.
---
If you join a good PvP guild there's a decent chance raids will be scheduled to minimize respecs. (Clear raid the day before weekly reset, clear raid the day of weekly reset [the guild has to be "good" in that they can clear the raids in one day])
---
The worst is when you'd hear developers mispronounce things. It's your game! Auchindoun was another tough one for people, which I think sounds really cool when pronounced correctly.
---
Will this be a big thing? Yes
---
Are there groups already forming for this? Yes
---
There will be massive twitch viewership for whatever guild gets enough people to MC first as well as the first Rag kill.  Whenever a new raid is released there will be the same hype for world first.  This will be bigger than the recent retail WoW world first event.
---
In the original release it was pretty huge, mainly for Salvation.
---
A bit part of that though was that Blackwing Lair was essentially (and maybe literally) impossible for horde when the drakes weren't tauntable, but with the updated talents, gear, and boss fights coming out as they were after fixes it may be less of an issue.
---
I'm still of the opinion that Paladins are much better than shamans in raids in vanilla/classic, but the biggest problems are admittedly reduced by having the content tested on retail and fixed already.
---
problem with wanting to mention avoidance is that a lot of warrior avoidance is parry whether you try to avoid it or not. whats parry do? ends up making the boss punch you in the head faster on the next swing
---
i just want to throw it out there that endgame bear druid total damage reduction is slightly over 88% with crits and crushes factored in
---
FWIW no one would use the shaman totem for breaking fears on the tank (or at least they really shouldn't given it just breaks the fear on a pulse, doesn't provide immunity). Horde had to stance dance every fear in every fight.
---
So you're saying step 1 in passive gold while leveling 1-60 is get a level 60 character to hang out in Winterspring?
---
Admittedly, I mispronounced this one in BC. I don't now that i know how its pronounced though.
---
The Runescape community is even worse solely because of the word scimitar
---
It says "post raid bis" not pre-raid.
---
The irony is that if he thought he could reasonably obtain post-raid BiS then he would also have the time to farm gold to respec. 
---
Exactly what I was thinking. Sounds like my old diablo 3 grinds
---
No, you run there with an alt and park him there.
---
You pre ordered Anthem? You’re part of the problem 
---
Has anyone compared 3-5 points in Frenzy and measured the uptime with a 1.0 - 1.3 attack speed cat?
---
For some of us it isnt...
---
OMG I get so triggered anytime I hear that. People need to read more.
---
How do you figure getting the extra .5x? Should be twice as fast to kill.
---
People are more brutal. It's great vs retail. 
---
Yeah I think trib runs and dm aoe runs are perfect examples of how investing in exp provides huge returns in gold. The funny thing is the aoe lvling isn't a tradeoff in terms of exprate, tribute runs you gain no exp.
---
You actually can get there very quickly with a trick similar to the one used to get from Menethil Harbor, to Dun Morough. You don't run the entire way, you talk to the Spirit Ressers and corpse run, this makes the trip very short. I know this information is new for some people, I am just sharing wisdom.
---
I mean... you had to escort him through Moonbrook, where one of the most dangerous mobs in classic wow resides.

Fucking Ardougne. When I was in grade school people at my school pronounced it “Ard - ridge.” Yup.
