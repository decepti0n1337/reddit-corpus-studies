Agility build and crits scale better. I like big numbers. Tank had no problem with this because he never lost hate. Had it been an issue, I'm sure he would've said something else.
---
That you don't care about the tank or his experience,  he may have been doing extra to reign in your stupidity but you don't care.  You are the kind of people I kick

Wbuffs are like traps, you may hate them and feel that it's wrong. 
---
Yet your dick is rock hard whenever you get them.
---
Look, if I took your post at face value (I don't) I would agree with you more than them. If the tank wasn't having difficulty it wasn't a big deal. At the same time, he mentioned it for a reason and instead of making sure he was okay with trying it out zero thought was given to his own experience, competence, and comfort zone and now everybody is toxic af for saying it?
---
Come on.

---
They're breathtaking!
---
Ah so if they can’t have the buffs, no one should
---
I prefer constructive comments that leave room for a discussion.
---
Just look at ooga gang highlights on YouTube. 
---
It’s all really funny.
---
Thanks, I appreciate it.
---
Proof?
---
Yeah, definitely.
---
I sorta like the fact that shamans make rogues not use a MH poison cause windfury is too good, but shadow oil being the best enchant after it is just a bit dumb.
---
Yep! It's not hard to do your job in a dungeon, threat isn't anyone's but the tanks job
---
Thanks, but what about my EU bnet acc? wouldn't it be a problem?
---
So say we all.
---
o7
---
Now I have to go rewatch The Cosmos again
---
Agreed. Playing vanilla on official servers a couple of years ago wasn't present even on dreams.
---
ok, I get that they didn't have issues but try to understand this. Whether you have Rockbiter on or not, the WAY you play doesn't change, you still do the same thing, same rotation. You're claiming you're forced into changing how you play when that is just not true while forcing someone else to actually be aware of something and change the way they play. For a couple big yellow numbers? Whoa that asshole.
---
I mean, I don't disagree.
---
But that's why I'm playing on a PvE or RP server lol.
---
Yes, same. But you haven't provided anything but a one sided tale here
---
Nah, nothing you said proves anything about my character. My shaman is agility stacked and scales better with rockbiter than flametongue. The tank never lost aggro because I was 3 levels lower so I used the ability that most suited my dps. Had there been an issue with our dungeon run as a result of my play, I would've corrected it.
---
God dang right on the edge. When did Git become the norm?
---
It is quite obvious from my subsequent sentences that the question I asked was rhetorical. If your schooling hasn't quite caught up to the more complex literary devices, you can start here (consider it your summer reading):
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetorical_question
---
Short version, I am not asking you to elaborate, I am claiming you are wrong. Pre-raid content in WoW wasn't hard enough to require spec optimization. Yes, if you wanted to run BWL as a feral tank or ele shaman or whatever, you will have to put in inordinate amounts of effort just to scrape by at "below average". But if you're happy doing Tier 0 and Tier 0.5 stuff, with maybe some PvP or last-slot Tier 1 pugs, you can literally roll whatever.
---
I mean, why not?
---
You can think of it as 15 bucks for a month trial of classic.
---
They are still not good. 
---
The skill cap just lowers to allow more things to be playable. 
---
Boomkin just sucks until later expansions. I know it sucks for people who want it to work but it’s true.

Not worth it
---
I wanted a discussion and was greeted with pure toxicity. Don't be toxic.
---
This thread gets posted every 48 hours. I think they get the message.
---
What should I do? Subpoena the tank and my whole guild?
---
\*do the thing with the mouth pop\*  
---
Noice.
---
How does this deal with Auto Shot clipping? Does it factor in the fact that sometimes a 10% quiver is better than the 15% quiver?
---
I mean, you weren't him but go off I guess
---
No
---
Wasn't it Sodapoppin Kappa?
---
What proves something about your character is not your stupid shaman’s rockbiter. 
---
How fucking dense can you be?  Like seriously. 
---
Almost every person in this thread has pointed out it’s how you reacted to your guild mates when you didn’t get the support you thought you’d get (just like in this thread). and how you even brought up the tank to them in the first place considering it sounds like he just shrugged your stupidity off. 
---
Like Jesus Christ you are one dumb asshole lol.
---
Nice
---
There is this,  very niche thing, of a screenshot. Its not widely known but it is when you take a picture of a screen and reference it

Warrior is a hybrid class, so it's probably possible.

100% on that bind. Can go one step farther and make it a select on mouse-over. Usually have to throw in an extra line so if nothing is on mouseover so it goes to target or doesn't cast (depending on preference). 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
That on a Boar, plus the same for Scatter shot was a wicked combo for dealing with unsavory situations.
---
Well yes, you are right about that. However what I really meant was also that these lesser viable classes/specs would be able to viable in general, like compete at a minimum if that makes sense. Obviously a ret pala or, i don't know, a feral druid would never have as high dps as a fury warrior, but at least they would be able to perform at a sensible level.
---
WHY IS IT TAKING SO LONG
---
I actually made 2 twinks, rogue and warrior. They were so much fun! I plan on doing it again.
---
Yea I feel for you man.  Sucks having to go to an inferior faction just to play the class you enjoy the most.  
---
At least if TBC ever hits you can reroll alliance and have a better time.
---
A tank is there to tank mobs. If he doesn't lose threat, he's doing what he's supposed to be doing. Define doing extra to reign in my stupidity? Did he somehow manage to pull out some other skills in his lvl 31 skillset out of his ass ? I'm confused. He tanked, he tanked well. At best he was probably letting me know in case I ever grouped with a tank lower than me.
---
I never recalled Fony having a reputation for being an amazing player.  more like a reputation for making awesome twink videos.
---
Also it's funny that you say this proves the OP's point because you say the person who made the video "moves like a clicker"  thus implying he is bad.   His main job as the offensive priest is to spam dispel his melee to stick on the FC. so he is using a mouseover macro to dispel.  obviously he can't be mouse turning because he would be slow on the dispels.  that was the meta for offensive priests in 19 premades back then.  it doesn't make him bad.
---
Also,  "Atax"  the dwarf hunter in the video was a rank 1 gladiator on his main at the time of this video.  does that prove that all twinks must be pro's?  no,  but it proves not all twinks were bad at end game PvP.
---
 
---
I think I read somewhere that bis enhancement was 450 dps.
---
Rogue prob 1200? Nightfall uptime 1/3, so say 4.5% spell dmg for raid. 10 casters in raid. 0.45\*1200 = 540 dps.
---
improved wf totem is worth maybe 100 dps.
---
Totem twisting grace of air and wf is worth roughly 4% dmg increase for the members of your party. 0.04 \* 4 \*1200 = 190 dps
---
Total Shaman DPS = 450 + 540 + 190 = 1180 dps
---
An enh shaman is a top tier dps under these circumstances. However, that's assuming an offtank isn't also using nightfall, which they kind of should be.
---
Alliance don't have an equivalent to that trinket
---
If you haven’t watched the 2018 blizzcon panels on classic I would suggest them.
---
You’re right they have no reason to admit to not having it. They actually talk about how they found it (backup of a backup’s backup or w/e). I believe em because I don’t think blizzard would commit to doing it with missing data. 
---
To me that doesn’t seem to be the way they would want to make a game (with guesswork). The kotaku article you linked (which I’ve read previously) backs that up too, they don’t seem to be ok with guesswork even in that article.
---
To each their own in this regard. Not like you’re the only person who believe’s blizzard is lying about finding the data.
---
The word metadata threw me off. Very much aware they have previously said they didn’t have the database data. They have since said otherwise ultimately its personal choice in which you believe.
---
It's a Blizzard release, of course there are going to be problems.
---
No. Go find it yourself. It’s common knowledge amongst those who have paid attention to the scene for the past decade.
---
You clearly have never tanked a day in your life haha
---
Big white numbers. He have to change anything about his play. Like I said below, is he going to pull some other skills out of his lvl 31 skillset ass ? There's literally nothing for him to change.
---
It's US and OCE only.
---
no
---
most fun ive had on a server
---
Yeah people don't realize how ridiculous twinks can be. Lvl 19 twinks can have 10 times the health of normal lvl 19s. That's like fresh lvl 60s fighting against lvl 80 players in epics.
---
I wouldn't say nes classic is comparable. Nintendo's been offering old games for a long time through various services. Blizzard straight up refused for many years
---
No worries. Above the stages there a a button "stages description here" you can click on it and has the information!
---
&gt;  standing is shared between horde and alliance. 
---
are you sure about that? my presumption was that these are faction standings. that doesnt really make a difference but still wanted to make sure! :)
---
I remember purchasing dvd for vanilla private server. It was a shit ton of fun to play but good god it was trash. Even a little tiny thing can cause crash. Whoever maintain the server stability and things like that in private server deserve a statue
---
Your title makes a statement. This is not a discussion. This is you just being wrong and not realizing it, or admitting it. There is a social dynamic here you are not getting. Especially with 4 guildies in the grp. What are you thinking is going to happen?
---
Lol k.
---
**&lt;Slightly Above Average&gt; - Horde |US- West| PVP**
---
Are you looking to be realm first MC? Are you looking for that R14 guild that will help you push your way to victory? Then is definitely not the guild for you. We are a guild that is formed from a few friends who want to relive classic without the hustle and bustle of min-maxing and focusing more on having fun. Play the class you want, and be a part of a guild that plans on clearing content, but won't force you into that fury warrior or warlock position to maximize DPS.
---
**Focus** \- to have multiple raid groups, with a diverse roster, to form groups to help level as well as PVP together, and to ultimately clear content.
---
**Schedule** \- TBD, once the guild is formed, and we  have enough people for MC we will assess the best days to raid
---
**Loot** \- Guild will come together at 60 and decide what system we are using
---
**Leadership** \- people who have played original vanilla, plus some private servers, have cleared all content. were all pretty chill and like to just generally have fun.
---
**Recruiting all classes/specs!**
---
If you're looking for an overall fun experience, come hang out with us and decide if its the place you want to call home. Send me a message if you're interested or feel free to join the discord channel! [https://discord.gg/QbCTHZT](https://discord.gg/QbCTHZT)
---
Don't need a ret pally to see who sucks ballsack tbh.
---
You're the toxicity I'm referring to. Unable to have a normal conversation without relying on insults and elitism.
---
Well yeah in the same way that WoW is a RTS game because you use strategy and play it in real time. It's called context.
---
In the context of Vanilla, hybrid means a class that can heal.
---
nice
---
Boohoo
---
Feral druid can already do "good enough" damage. The main issue is that if you're playing feral dps it's pretty much a case of you actively hurting the guilds performance if you compare it to what you could do as a healer.
---
Compartment affirmative, you are sect about that. Nevertheless what I rattling meant was likewise that these lesser possible classes/specs would be practicable in superior general, like vie at a limit if that makes meaning. Plainly a dowse pala or, i don't have a go at it, a wild priest would ne'er have as upper refugees as a rage mortal, but at littlest they would be healthy to carry through at a levelheaded raze.

^(This is a bot. I try my best, but my best is 80% mediocrity 20% hilarity. Created by OrionSuperman. Check out my best work at /r/ThesaurizeThis)
---
There were no guildies in my group...
---
I've tried it. I do not.
---
That's because your items are stronger than theirs by a long shot. Mage tier is absolute trash except t2 gloves, you have no concept of mage gearing whatsoever. For mage their frozen wrath greens are better than MC gear. They are using green shoulders, cape, bracers, boots, and wand over MC gear, yet you think their gear options are better?
---
The answer is no, fury warriors get the strongest t1 itemization out of any class in the game and its not remotely close. The majority of the gear warriors get in t1 isn't replaced until AQ.
---
See, the one problem with this is that there are some people you try to help who, for whatever reason, cannot fathom that they might have to put in some work themselves to get better at the game. I enjoy helping people, but when you don't see any active improvement on their end, and it feels like you're doing their homework for them rather than helping them understand how to do their homework, it feels like a wasted effort.
---
Draenei Vindicators also use the Tome of Divinity when they crashed on Azeroth. I'm suggesting that it's not the Order that makes the Paladin but access to the lessons in the Tome of Divinity.
---
Sadly the Tome is almost erased from current lore, and I don't know why. I had asked about it at a Blizzcon one year and didn't get much of an answer.
---
Sure, that could be a strategy. Do you think that this is bad for the game?
---
Bohoo i have no life, let me ruin it more and then never touch pvp for the rest of classic
---
You said "it was the guildies I mentioned it to"
---
Christ, I should pay more attention.
---
Thanks again :)
---
&gt; "Tank thinks rockbiter matters..."
---
you don't get to make that decision for the tank. If it's not an issue, he wouldn't have brought it up.
---
Lol okay bud
---
ANYONE (terms and conditions may apply)
---
well, you don't have to win the fishing tournament, you just have to get lucky and catch one of the rare fish during the tournament
---
I was honestly thinking about some fun raids with off meta specs.
---
Having full Arcane Mages, few Boomkins, some Retris... 
---
Yes, it's not good or optimal, but after people are done with their main progress, twinking or off-meta raiding can actually be pretty fun. It would also make for a really good video / stream content.
---
It kind of reminded me of times, where me and my friend were running all dungeons from the easiest onward as 2 mages with engi, trying to somehow make it as far as possible. We were noobs back then, but we managed to clear Sunken temple, except the last boss.
---
Was it good? Fast? Optimal? Hell no. Was it fun? ... One of the best time I had in wow.
---
People always get so defensive and angry about these things, but hey man, none is forcing anyone to run meme specs. Everyone is free to find people that want to play as they want. And with population can much higher than in actual Vanilla back then - there will be more than enough people to chose from.
---
Can't wait to try some meme comps. Get beer, hop on discord and let's go!
---
Yea? So? I mentioned it to my guild, they were not in my group.
---
PSA: Don’t be like OP.
---
Found the elitist.
---
lolololol XDDDD
---
69 like sex lololol
---
Your points are overblown/wrong. You don’t go oom that fast, not nearly that fast. Also, find a guild that treats you fair then? No guild I’ve ever been a part of prioritizes hunters and warriors over pally for 2H.
---
Just the way I like it.
---
Bold of you to think he was doing any worthwhile dps in this run. :')
---
It should. The top reward is far too painfull, and time consuming to acquire.
---
I get it. It's an ultimate reward, but it shouldn't be made so that only chinese gold farmers can acquire it.
---
Done here. I'll just add you to ignore.
---
Weird flex
---
thanks - factually of course I have no idea what they have, and it is reasonable to assume if they dug enough they should have had a copy somewhere, somehow.
---
However, dungeons look too easy vs. my pre-2.3 memories of them.  some elements should not be influenced by better players (initial tank damage taken on pull, for example).
---
This likely gets clarified when the dungeons with extensive video documentation open up later in beta.
---
Not really.  I enjoy PvE a lot more than PvP servers, mainly because I don't enjoy the ganking scene what so ever.  
---
I still got to do town/city raids constantly and people always caused fights by killing quest givers anyway.  The misconception is that people never world PvP on a PvE server, but that just wasn't the case.  
---
Bottom line is that if you do enjoy the ganking aspect of the game, then you can't replace PvP.  If you like world PvP but don't like getting camped (or don't care for doing it yourself), then you can enjoy PvE.
---
By making him aware that someone is pulling more threat for that "meaningless 10dps", that you said yourself, you are changing the way he plays. You're being 100% hypocritical here. And based on the rest of the comments in this post and your replies, you'll never quite get a grasp of it. No sense in trying to help you understand as it's clearly a waste of time.
---
Released in 2005. I'm pretty sure other version control program existed before.
---
Haha! Can happen to anyone! I always miss the obvious things!
---
Why are you so butthurt? Damn, you mad.
---
 By the time BWL hits, Ashkandi would be available and Ash'jure as well as Dragonfang dagger, making the rank 14 weapons no longer absolute bis   
---
we get the 1.12 versions of the gear, so no weapons will still be bis
---
Half my time spent on my PvE server was spent attacking crossroads or defending goldshire lol
---
Ohhhhh get wrecked twinks
---
&gt;  just make it a solid HCB progress 
---
you should probably explain that
---
&gt; tune it so that it will take about 3 to 4 months of pvping to reach the final rank 
---
r14 really easy to get? that doesnt sound 'classic' at all anymore tbh...
---
&gt; Also bots will perform a lot worse in classic than they did the last 4 expansions in retail 
---
its simple HK grinding, bots will be REALLY powerful in classic and its not as easy as 'Detecting which accounts are online 24/7'
---
Troll posts at an all time high. Classic needs to hurry up so we can replace these with troll posts but with screenshots.
---
How would it promote world pvp? It would mean the people with buffs will try to avoid world pvp as much as possible.
---
Probably soon after I hit max on my main. I have no intentions of raiding seriously.
---
Sure, I just mentioned these classes or specs as examples. But in a world without world buffs, do you see ret and feral be more viable? Wouldn't better classes such as a fury warrior still be considered/chosen over these two?
---
I like to at least give the benefit of the doubt to people on the interwebz. But this is a lost cause.
---
Its a shit reward that can be easily replaced even though you will hate the experience and never pvp again. You people didnt even attempt the ranks in real classic and you  dont know anything  or evem co sidered what I wrote or what other rank 14s have said
---
It hurts when you want to mine tin, but you only know how to mine copper.
---
I think you're reading too far into it. If they were to offer an explanation, it's likely just that the humans/dwarves lent copies of the tome to the draenei, but the real reason is likely that they just didn't want to create something new for the draenei and essentially copy and pasted it.
---
I don't think the tome is very important.
---
They ain't no Angwe though.
---
http://liquidcode.org/~lostman/wow/dkeserver.se/stuff/angwe/
---
The biggest feature I feel like these addons need is a "I skipped this quest" button that also disables the followup quests from appearing. Does that sound possible? I could help you with a followup quest database if you need one.
---
Yes yes I am sure blizzard is doing it because they told them to. Not be a use of the money piles they'll make in monthly subs as people will surge back into the game.
---
Sure, but you already have forms that fulfill the same things without costing 20% or whatever of your manapool. I plan on doing moonkin PvP but its not exactly great.
---
He made up stories on reddit
---
can one of you  "twinking is unfair"  people explain to me how twinking is unfair?  everybody has equal opportunity to make one.
---
Bur
---
If you're not tanking, don't use use rock biter. Infact, rock biter is so bad, you shouldn't use it at all. Give us your in-game name so I can ignore you too, 
---
Terrible shamans making a fuss about being harassed when they are the route cause of the problem...smh
---
I have a feeling they said that BECAUSE they were made aware of blizzard's intentions for Classic....
---
About an hour.
---
alliance druid gets better feral dps for when you switch to cat form. might/kings/salv is amazing where as horde just gives windfury(useless for you)/strength, and sometimes agility if the shaman totem twist.
---
the hp/dodge passives are about the same but alliance is probably a bit better. 
---
horde gets a good tank ring early on that alliance can't get but its replaced when you get dark iron ring.
---
The other side is that horde gets warchief's blessing from the drak questline, i dont think alliance get a blessing like it as i played only horde. anyways we threated ours like onyxia head and popped one every week with mains/alts. melee haste is pretty big on it.
---
all in all i wouldn't say its a big difference.
---
Kargoz and Navac have done a few speedruns on the beta, and they've always ended up with just enough cloth to make the LMW at level 5.
---
If you do not want to look a little bit further outside from this particular situation and don't want to understand why it happened in general, there is really nothing more to say.
---
Fuck futbol
---
It's inconvenient is the thing. It's a half hour break whenever you get to the boss you want to progress before you can even try to progress.
---
Again, you're using up very precious time to go out of the raid and get those buffs, time that could be better used doing more pulls and getting your raid more used to the encounter. Or farming different content even.
---
This is my exact plan actually lmao.
---
So far so good, expected more of a challenge picking it up since I've bound the directional keys to the joystick. I now have a lot of fingers for abilities haha!
---
Haven't really been playing with people though (empty pserver) so I'm just getting used to a leveling pve rotation and I still fumble often so it's going to be fun on the first pvp encounter...
---
Overall I'd recommend it, it's more comfortable and I do have access to a lot of which makes playing keybind heavy classes less intimidating.
---
Do you always act like such an ass that people hate you immediately?
---
Copy pasting thread I made from the classic forums...  
---
 The Mentality Behind Twink Players And People Against Twinking.  
---
The fact of the matter is, people fall under 2 categories regarding this topic  
---
You either;  
---
1. Have the mentality to become a better player, get better gear and work to become competitive  
---
2. Have the mentality to be lazy and whine and complain that Blizzard needs to change the game because you don't wan't to put in as much effort as other players.  
---
That is what it really boils down to. you either have a competitive attitude, or a defeatist attitude. and this goes beyond just twinking. you don't need to become a twink to have the competitive mentality or the defeatist mentality.  
---
Non-Twink with competitive mentality will focus on the positives. they will help the twinks on their team, provide buffs to them, throw them heals, whatever it is they can do to help their team, or the twinks on their team to help them win. and in turn it makes them want to make their own character stronger to help contribute even more to their team winning.  
---
Non-Twink with Defeatist mentality will only focus on the negatives. how often he gets killed, how many times his team loses etc. he will not try to become better and stronger, rather complain that something needs to change.  
---
EVERYBODY in the game has the capabilities to twink characters. it just depends on the effort you wan't to put in. just like an RPG should be.  
---
I myself got blasted by twinks as a level 10 rogue. but because I am a person with a competitive mentality, it did not dissuade me from BG's. I still queue'd BG's constantly, and tried to help my team win. many times I was killed by enemy twinks, but guess what? many other times I was able to run a flag across the field to score a flag capture by saving my sprint and finding a good route to run. Or I was able to score a flag return when we killed an enemy twink by being good with my right clicks.  
---
I didn't quit when twinks killed me. I then decided I wanted to make my character even better. I had no maxed character. on my lowbie rogue I went to the barrens and fished savoury delights and cooked them, as they were sold for 20g/stack on my server at the time during TBC. I made a really good twink, the only thing I was missing was the BiS Shadowfang item, and the epic quality leg armour enchant.   
---
I became 95% BiS geared twink all on my own because I wanted to do it. I didn't complain that the game needed to be changed.  
---
I look forward to making twinks again in Classic WoW and helping my teams to win many battlegrounds. and I hope to come across many players in my battlegrounds with a competitive mentality.  
---
thanks for reading, bye!
---
Exploitation will begin ASAP, and will progress quickly.
---
depends on the items, i guess. needless to say that the market for light leather will have stabilized much faster than the market for arcanite bars...  
---
id guess around 3 months for maxlevel endcontent items tbh
---
&gt; If you don't think Blizzard is cooking up some plan to convert Classic players over to Retail, you're delusional.
---
And if they take what made vanilla good, and put that into retail?
---
You bet your sweet ass I'll give it a try.
---
I dunno my friends pugged 45 min baron runs later in vanilla often. I didn’t, most of my strat and scholo runs were done pre 1.3 so... 
---
The other issue with the dungeons looking to easy is the streamers who are streaming them. They are better than your average player and in gear that most people won’t have when leveling.
---
Can’t compare well coordinated well geared groups to your average group of pugs.
---
Ya more like bbc and cnn news of parents hiring doctors because their children wouldnt get off the computer to grind the ranks just like fortnite
---
Economic growth like the market leveling out?  A month past phase 2?  Purely guessing.
---
Until then prices will go up and down like crazy for non reagent items.
---
After that prices for resistance pots will fluctuate based on raid but everything else should be fine
---
[removed]
---
Lol, I got this one today, actually.
---
You underestimate the power of no lifing games 5mins in the AH will have somthing up for 500g
---
I call up you're measuring as well cold into it. If they were to offering an thinking, it's believable rightful that the humans/dwarves Lententide doubles of the book to the draenei, but the complex quantity present is prospective that they clean didn't miss to make thing unaccustomed for the draenei and au fond textual matter and glued it.
---
I don't conceive the book is absolute distinguished.
---
I can't wait to see people trying to sell malachite and tigerseye for multiple gold.
---
You guess the cause of no lifing scores 5Mins in the AH will have somthing up for 500alphabetic character
---
I'm sure that is true. There were some who were in it just to fight other twinks or for whatever other reason. But the vast majority were in it for the pubstomping. They were there to be invincible against regular players, and it died as soon as they had to fight each other only. 
---
I get your argument about player population but it just means twinking was not popular enough once pubstomping went away to sustain it as a playstyle.
---
You're wrong on a few points. Horde and Alliance don't share RP allocations, 2 players per server can receive the maximum 13k RP per week. And the number of people that can be Rank 14 is dependent on the number of people in the system, not a set number. Some servers had none, some servers had many.
---
If you know anything about the pvp system i dont need to explain it, just go read o  your own and as I said, bots will plague video games and there is never a solution to that with the old system all the same.
---
Guessing you didn't get one that titanforged to indestructible yet?
---
Can someone explain how the lotus and devilsaur mafia works, I mean is it just being the one who gets them so you know roughly when they'll come back next?
---
&gt; do you see ret and feral be more viable?
---
Compared to other dps classes, yes, slightly. 
---
&gt;Wouldn't better classes such as a fury warrior still be considered/chosen over these two?
---
Yeah, of course, because they are better classes, some buffs won't change that. The only thing the buffs could possibly change is the relative gap between them, and if anything, that gap increases with buffs.
---
I remember that naked rogues with the level 1 gray dagger could stunlock people to 0.  But it wasn't common, or easy.
---
Except for you though right?
---
Sounds more similar to OSRS.
---
I guess only Nost staff will ever know for sure, but I like to think that they were in it for the right reasons and weren't taking money from gold sellers. The fact that they never offered any kind of P2W keeps them a cut above most other private server operators in my eyes.
---
Wrong, flametongue + dagger works better with crit due to flurry, which further increases flametongue damage. Dude you don't even know your class lmao. This hurts to see.
---
n
---
Try 50 times easier.
---
If you're in a group that's short a tank or a healer, you might be looking for an hour to fill those roles, and sometimes you simply can't fill it.
---
If you're missing DPS, you might be looking for 5 minutes.
---
I'm not sure what you mean by 15% being worse than 10%, but you can select it in the sheet. It calculates the optimal rotation based on cycle times and amount of damage to determine clipped vs full. I haven't specifically noted that 10% quivers are ever better. Was there somewhere you heard this?
---
Its a great addition. Keep up the good work. 
---
Joana guide is solid but he is doing an addon. Doubt itll be ready for release. 
---
Outside of that there is that classic levelling website linked regularly? With the maps and saved progress? I'll link if you cant remember it
---
I dont remember 1.12 changing stats on pvp weapons, whats your source? And if thats the case, I doubt pvp weapons will release with higher dps ir similar to Aq 49 tier...
---
Aye and no doubt it will be a stack of copper bars.
---
If I had to make the choice between Ret and Enhance, I choose Fury Warrior.
---
&gt; How would it promote world pvp?  
---
Because for those people that want world buffs, they would have to travel to feralas to do diremaul, they would have to go to darkmoon faire every now and then to get the buff there. They would have to travel to felwood in order to get songflower, and they would have to farm in blasted lands for the buffs there, and so on.  
---
   
---
Surely those people would try to avoid pvp at all cost and therefore they would (most likely) have to socialize with their friends or guildmates in order to do stay safe. High risk, high reward.
---
Glad my work has a don't ask policy on vacation.  If you request off you select pto and no comments needed.  I'm leaving work early monday and sleeping until monday evening when game comes out.
---
Actually spell damage increases your heal power as well but is not really the best as there are typically less spell damage on gear than pieces with pure +healing
---
Are you on crack? The LookingForGroup chat is global, as is the unofficial world chat. You don't need to leave.
---
Of course he didn't, rock biter does garbage DPS.
---
Awful Bot.
---
Look at this duuude. Tryna make himself renowned by naming a guide after himself.  /s
---
Exactly! I would love a version of WoW that takes the fundamentals from Classic with all that Blizzard has learned from 15 years of dungeon design, raid design, PVP balance, etc.
---
There are plenty of ugly things about Retail, but I don't think that's what stops most people from joining in. I think it's the idea of being so far behind the people that have been playing forever.

Will it mess up if I go to westfall at level 12?

&gt; But I can’t think of a logical reason to do so.

To enjoy the game, that's pretty logical to me

Strong username to post hehe xD
---
They had people from both factions who would camp the spawns 24 hours a day and gank anyone not approved who tried to get it.
---
I NEED IT NOW
---
Balance/resto hybrid is probably the best wPvP spec in the game. There is also a Balance/Resto spec for raid healing at higher levels of gear based on crits shaving off cast time on your spells
---
I mean LotP is still pretty nice. If there's a druid putting in that much work to farm Pummelers, knows how to powershift like a boss, and your guild isn't going for world first, I think that's still worthy of a 1-of spot.
---
Every pserver does this. It's how they keep the server running. Blizzard does it with subscribers, pservers do it with blood money
---
Most are, yes - but we're talking about Nostalrius specifically.
---
The Nost team rarely opened up possibilities for donations, and when they did, it went directly to the server hosting company and was closed again once the goal for server upkeep was reached.

If you line up killing Devilsaurs in Ungoro perfectly you can kill 3-4 exactly when they spawn, only to make it to the next one right when it spawns.. do that for a couple hours and you can make a ton of gold

It's a stress test, if you do that it's 100% on you and not Blizzard.
---
&gt;"please explain what you mean by HCB system"  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;"go read of your own"
---
yeah thanks. i know everything about vanillas pvp system and i dont know the abbreviation of HCB and a google search doesnt bring anything up.
---
Thats not true, it was rank based so if 1 player pvped in the whole server during a week, he would get rank and would get the highest amount of progress. I guess I am wrong on the shared faction standing though
---
I'd wager the AH will be all but useless for the first month or two. We'll see p2p trading within the hour though. Warriors gonna be all up on yo alchemic dick for health potions.
---
You are right, lol.
---
I'm of the opinion they just shouldn't be allowed in instanced raids. I'm sure it's an unpopular opinion, but that's how I feel about them.
---
And there should be 100 more.
---
hes amazing at immediately coming off as condescending, right? :O
---
It's almost like sharding, difficulty, and lfg killed the game.
---
Pretty sure I remember pallies dual wielding back in vanilla. #nochanges
---
...or I missed it and will fix soon :)
---
What day for Oceana though? The 28th? I need to know the exact dates for time off lmao
---
how is this the top comment? this answer is literally the incompetence of this subreddit summed up. turtles are the mobs with the highest armor of any mobs in the game. the last thing you should be grinding as a warrior/rogue are turtles...
---
&gt;Big white numbers
---
Also kind of an elitist jerk way to go about correcting in unimportant detail. Congratulations and being a complete douche.
---
Bad bot.
---
Thanks for the feedback! Great point on separating out armor values, I didn't think of that one. I'll add it to my list.
---
hope you dont write in english buddy oO
---
Best if used an alliance, prob no go on horde
---
Thank you master hunter!

He already stated it's not going to be free: https://www.joanasworld.com/in-game-addon-construction.htm

So OP, please continue making your addon.
---
You just went through every point that I read and dismissed it in your head with an idiots logic, Heres a big fuck you, i dont care if you hate me lol
---
Hahahaha that or linen cloth hahaha
---
ew
---
You're assuming everyone plays consistently from launch.
---
You absolutely can dispute that if there's no data presented.
---
Are people reuploading this to fish upvotes?
---
Are people forgetting this has been posted 100 times?
---
But they need more love, they do
---
At least on my (probably flawed) list, there's 8 upgrades from MC and Onyxia, so roughly 50% of your items. 
---
But then there are fun slots like shoulders, where I think there's literally only one worthwhile raid-quality item for fury warriors in all of vanilla (the AQ shoulders). And they aren't even that good (they have defense on them, lol).
---
Cuff links my guy. You use them on the cuff of your dress shirt  by your wrist. 
---
It’s a classy thing to have and most people never wear them or for fancy occasions only.
---
Wedding rings typically come with a “ring” that would fit around a finger.
---
That improved questing should be added to post-classic WoW. I think most of us agree that some of the questing Classic WoW is very lacklustre. It is arguably detrimental to new players joining the game.
---
Nobody ask for you, some1 smack this bot bad bot shoo
---
Hell yah, fuck the no change crackpots.
---
Haha , Can't wait to see general chat - 'WTS LINEN CLOTH FULL STACK 5G'
---
Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzT8UzO1zGQ)
---
I loved TourGuide back in Vanilla/TBC. That automatically detected quest-progress and moved on.
---
Things will probably be in a lull for the first few days, with economy ramping up as people cap 60/professions etc.
---
Also https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassicWoWGoblins/ has been created recently, hopefully traffic picks up the closer we get to launch (:

It's not a guide, and technically isn't named after myself (other than the title here on reddit) :P

Why would moving 50% speed prevent someone from getting behind you? Is it not better to turn when your auto attack is ready then continue running at 100% speed?
---
Spell damage never effected healing power in Vanilla, they changed that in BC but in Vanilla they were treated as different stats.
---
Ah cheers for the link , didn't even think to search for it. Think I'm going to keep all mats on a alts anyway , just need to run them to IF /TB
---
So much wasted potential with this faction, too, in the long run. Pity, it's one of the best factions in Warcraft.
---
Can you ban this fucking bot? Automatic, irrelevant replies that don't contribute at all.
---
Thanks! Ya, there's a bit of weirdness there right now. It is possible to edit a preset, but you need to create the set, then go back in and edit in order to do it. On my list of things to fix.
---
the client will probably be out a lot sooner because imo thats how the name reservation will work (12th of august). 
---
I imagine they just give everyone access but you cant actually login, only creating characters.
---
Oh I'll play it for sure, but if you get so upset over someone telling you to boohoo then I find it hard to believe you will stick it out very long
---
Oh nice! I was using the outdated version of this. I like that you added melee weaving. You are missing Dreadforge Retaliator as an option there.  
---
Also, is the general consensus that agility enchants won't be available? That kinda sucks. Could be interesting to add weapon dmg enchant to the list to see estimated increase with weaving.  
---
Anyway, thanks for the update!
---
That shouldn't annoy people. They deserve the attention. The office memes 5 days a week were the real killer for me.
---
Some myth about having a perfect 3.0 attack speed with the chrom xbow to match the 3sec cast time of aimshot which is utterly stupid with lag and human reaction time.
---
I can’t remember the last game where you had to wait till release to start downloading it. For awhile it’s been you can download the game but the servers will not be online until that time.
---
Please, #notmyclassic up yours bud, you didnt go past the title...
---
Except they are shit for carrying nightfall as only their white hits proc it. Bother the warrior off tank and hunters are way better choices.
---
https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1105876-bug-hit-tables/
---
Pservers went bass 8% hit, with weapon skill giving glancing 100% damage, and dodge at 5.6. Dodge is actually 6.5, hit is actually 8.6 (so 9%), and glancing blows cannot be reduced beyond 25%
---
&gt;I prefer constructive comments that leave room for a discussion.
---
Yet everyone is wrong that disagrees with you, which is just about everyone that's commented when you asked for peoples opinion on the matter. That's some good discussion. And more hypocrisy.
---
Warlock - bag space. Imo soul shard bags should be like 28 - 32
---
Naw dude marriage is much more permanent now. You stab your finger with the blunt rod part and then the side rods shoot out and hold it in place.
---
What if your bride leans in close during her vows and whispers in your ear..........
---
"FOR THE ALLIANCE"
---
Nice.
---
They definitely have a negative stigma. I get downvoted quite frequently for bringing them up, usually with responses like “CLASSIC IS NOT PRIVATE SERVERS”, while ignoring the actual discussion taking place.
---
Sure they did.  It just had Class: Hunter on it :(.
---
That make sense. Do you think that world buffs should be removed or restricted because of this? I mean surely you aren't forced to do this. - its up to people themselves to decide whether they should get world buffs or continue raiding(?)
---
That’s about what I figured would happen. But what do you mean by name reservation, haven’t heard of that yet.
---
tomorrow anybody with a subbed US account can dl it to play the stress test in 2 days
---
ahahahahahaha  that is so funnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
---
Because earth shock gained a bit of threat? Is that why people used them to tank?
---
They did contribute. They made classic happen. And nobody acts like assholes because they know more. If someones right then they are right, not being assholes. People see what they want to see.
---
Most Steam games you can’t pre-download but I’ve never known for Battle.net because I’ve never preordered or bought a game close to release from Blizz.
---
I mained a holy priest and had a 29 rogue I used to blow off some steam. Nothing was more fun than one shotting casters.
---
Hate me all you want.
---
I mean, I don't want any changes. It's just that if I ran a guild I'd probably ignore them, or only use them for the second raid night a week assuming we get to the boss we've been having trouble with the first night.
---
That's a lot better than we usually do.
---
That and they want to feast on non twinks. Let's be honest, there is a HUGE power difference between twinks and non twinks. Crushing non twinks is a power fantasy. 
---
Twinking is really not even about PvP per se. The grand majority of twinks want nothing to do with facing other Twinks. Look at what happened when WoW separated regular toons from Twinks. Twinking dried up and disappeared
---
Oh really, interesting. I’m talking about the actual release though and not the stress test, sorry.
---
Lmao get off of here, you don't have what it takes for rank 14. Why ruin it for other people?
---
It is the sole reason it happened.
---
You stole this!!!!
---
Can confirm. Had naxx gear in vanilla. Sucked at pvp. Killed many people.

---
I don't think you can just say that though. Burden of proof, innocent until proven guilty and all that. Regardless, I guess it doesn't really matter anymore.
---
Stop misclicking the upvote button!
---
Pservers went 8.6% hit. For all gearing purposes, it was treated as 9 hit required.  
---
What's funny in this post actually is that blizzard first said it would be a 8% hit cap, then inspected their code and realized private servers were actually bang on right with the 8.6% number.
---
Great work! Thanks for this
---
Are we not being able to confirm our character names 2 weeks before launch surely we will have to actually log into classic to do this , so you should have enough time to get you're download on the go
---
So you're saying it's dumb that you can farm a level 24 potion and a flask and another class specific debuff and likely a weapon specific debuff (nightfall) for raid and eek out a little bit more damage than the level 20 quest weapon enhancement?
---
If there's a warrior there with nightfall also, then the overall uptime will increase.  Let's cut the shaman's uptime % in half.   He is still doing 910 dps to the rogues 1200 dps.  That isn't terrible by any stretch.    
---
If you toss the shaman for a rogue, then you also have to add all the wf dps the group is losing too, assuming you don't have sufficient shaman.
---
nice troll hahaha
---
nah i'm comapring to actual classic servers
---
&gt; But in a realistic world (of Warcraft) how long do you think untill we will see economic growth on classic ?  
---
Not long at all. It mostly depends on the server population &amp; faction balances on your chosen server, I think. Resources will sell for absurd prices at first compared to what they'll sell for a couple of months or years down the line, then once more people reach higher levels and can farm more efficiently they'll become less scarce and will devalue. If you want to make some easy quick money early on, I'd suggest making an alt and playing the AH for a little bit during downtime when the margins are high.
---
That is the stupidest thing i ever heard.
---
Well I guess it won't be as bad in classic 2.0. People should be more "open minded" cause hybrids are legit in other expansions and they know their potential with the right gear. But back then, there was only 2-3 guilds past BWL on my server. Realm transfers weren't a thing for a long time. So it's not like you say fuck you and easily join another guild and also start with 0 DKP. I guess I was a bit selfish cause I never changed spec for raid. Anyway, even though it may be easier to gear hybrids, it still won't be easy because loot table can be a bitch. Especially non set pieces, also every raid it seemed like we could gear up a lock or hunter from blues to full epics... I wonder if the drop chances will be tweaked a bit.
---
“So who was in the wrong here?”
---
You
---
That would be one reason to avoid roads while levelling.
---
I just read the article the last person posted but I don’t think you would make you download the game. I think Blizz might just make you do it through the WoW website. But it would seem weird considering they’re making you pick the realm for your character also.
---
# &lt;Coup&gt; | NA |Alliance | PvE Server | Middlecore Raiding | Fri/Sat Evenings PST (exact days/times TBD)
---
**About Us:**
---
&lt;Coup&gt; is a guild with almost 15 years of history, originally formed in vanilla on the Shadowsong-US server. Coup was a top raiding guild on the server during vanilla, scoring several server firsts across BWL and AQ40, including server first Nefarian. Since then we’ve stuck together through almost every expansion with a fairly consistent core of 15-20 members, and are looking to ramp our numbers up to have a healthy community in classic, as well as to support the 40 man raid scene. 
---
I’m referring to Coup as “Middlecore” because we plan to raid, but won’t likely push hard on bleeding edge progression. We will always welcome a wide variety of players and playstyles. This ranges from people who always want to play at the top of their game, all the way through to those who want to take the scenic route through the game. 
---
Due to the nature of 40 man raiding we will need some consistency in the raid roster, but we also place no pressure on our people when real life happens. If you need to take a sabbatical from raiding or the game in general, we may backfill your role, but the guild will still be here and you will still be a member when you get back. We’ve always treated this game as part of our hobby and not a job, and we’ve been able to maintain many of the same friends and guild members for over a decade as a result. We hope that in Classic we can maintain that M.O.
---
**What we are looking for:**
---
* We want to build a community first, and then our raiding team later. More than anything we want to find like-minded adults who want to enjoy the game with us.
---
* At some point (ideally around or before content Phase 2) we would like to get the point where we are able to consistently clear current content while it is current. 
---
**What are aren’t looking for:**
---
* Toxicity, racism, bigotry, homophobia, or other generally awful behavior. During the Blizzcon opening ceremony Chris Metzen always used to end with a saying; “Be good to each other”… We intend to do just that, and invite people that will conduct themselves in a positive manner.
---
If you are interested in learning more, please reach out to me via DM here on Reddit, or via discord @ Evilmonstar#7541. 
---
Thanks for reading, and we can’t wait to see you in Classic!
---
But you lost the enchantment on it each time.  Paying for a fresh healing or spell power enchant?  No thanks!
---
Sorry if this was stated elsewhere but do previous stress test users get access to this one if our sub has ran out inbetween the previous 2 and this upcoming one?
---
im not positive but im pretty sure it should be the same client
---
Mods, this one right here.
---
Check back every so often and I might have a new version! I'll look into adding Dreadforge, I don't think I know what that is..  
---
The general consensus (so far) is that agility enchants will be time-gated til Phase 3, purely speculation but it's based on Ion's tweet regarding when things would be added in what phase. 15 agi was not added until 1.6, with BWL. 25 agi was not added until 1.9 with AQ.
---
Smite priests in late game with paladins down ranking and stacking judgments of the crusader op damage
---
\-Did you see a lot of buffed raid tanks in PvP? In my grind to r13 I saw it a whole one time(full flask premade) and they all got flamed on Irc and realm forum afterwards. But fine, a twink is the same as being fully buffed in. Doesn't sound easy at all.   
---
And seriously, 1.5 times? The difference in health on the beta was  more than 1.5 times, that's without (the best) enchants and full BIS and that's only 30 and 40 so far. I didn't see many twinks on 49 or 59 so I have no experience, but I sure as hell saw people do 1v5s as a 19/29/39 by pretty much smashing their face on the keyboard, sure the same might have been possible at 60 but that would require some serious skill and luck.
---
\-Fresh 60s wont have enchants, neither will a random leveling BGer, doesn't change the argument at all. Full enchants on a low level character makes more of a difference than on a high level one.   
---
\-Yes at 39, 49, how many twinks did you see at 59? Lack of skillset is a simplification of gameplay, it is inherently easier to play, to gear and to smash scrubs on twinks than on max level. Not to mention that you're playing against people who barely know their class.

It's being protective, same as how internet browsers scan everything you download for viruses. It's just a warning telling you to check what you run and be sure you know what it does.

Constantly mocking people for enjoying a different way of playing the game and demeaning them for it isn't something done 'in good fun'.  It is a form of complaining whether you want to admit it or not.  
---
Spin it however you want, but you and many others are flat out being dicks half the time when it comes to this subject.  Really isn't any way to justify insulting people constantly when the intent is to put down their long term choice.
---
&gt;It is quite obvious from my subsequent sentences that the question I asked was rhetorical. If your schooling hasn't quite caught up to the more complex literary devices, you can start here (consider it your summer reading):
---
You were clearly not being sarcastic, as is proven by your complete misunderstanding of my argument. Here is your summer reading:
---
&gt;Pre-raid content in WoW wasn't hard enough to require spec optimization. 
---
I never claimed this.
---
&gt;But if you're happy doing Tier 0 and Tier 0.5 stuff, with maybe some PvP or last-slot Tier 1 pugs, you can literally roll whatever.
---
I agree.
---
Notice how you thought I claimed or assumed the opposite, yet didn't?
---
So, as I said, go back and read what I said. It was a simple instruction, but apparently still too difficult. I recommend stopping with homeschooling and actually going to a school.
---
Welp, I upvoted! Cant wait! Sigh, I have zero time now...
---
[LFG thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c1lj3r/looking_for_group_monday_june_17_2019/) is sticky today...
---
Yeah I just noticed that comment, didn't scroll first haha,
---
Like you said it does seem very strange that they would do this. Blizz should let us start downloading pre launch maybe a week before ? 
---
Or they will use to download as a buffer for people logging in , so they don't get these ridiculously long queues that are annoying as hell .
---
And you still can't run wowhead?
---
It’s not mutually exclusive, you are certainly allowed to be annoyed by the office posts. I’m just saying there were a lot of posts here about private servers being responsible for classic in a short period of time. There’s plenty of gratitude out there for them, we don’t need to rehash it over and over.
---
Okay, I understand. So for that reason would you prefer if world buffs were removed entirely or restricted? Or are you fine with world buffs as they are?
---
Stack judgments of the crusader while down ranking them and go full disc.
---
There is actually a sticky post for this kinda thing, fyi.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c1lj3r/looking\_for\_group\_monday\_june\_17\_2019/
---
The rankings are absolutely dependent on what everyone else does on your faction. If you're the only person PVPing on your server, reaching Rank 14 is literally impossible. It happened on several servers over several weeks.
---
Healing extremely often comes with damage unless it's a specific school of magic (like + spell power to Shadow spells) or a specific trinket then yes, it doesn't apply to healing. Otherwise all gear show "increases your spell damage and healing by xx"
---
You've got a good point as far as how little the DPS difference may be. I honestly do not know, and I would not be surprised if it was like 5% or smaller.
---
Also nightfall is crafted, so I don't think it'll be too uncommon to have a single nightfall user and a single warlock with imp shadow bolt in a raid.
---
So it's less like a specific raid comp you gotta pursue to make it viable, and instead just how most raids will be lol.
---
It'd be cooler for rogues to want Windfury &gt; Weapon Poisons &gt; other enchants. But really that's the core of my argument for it being dumb. It's what I think would be cool lol.
---
Its not a chore to play your class correctly in an instance...........
---
what would you have done differently
---
Yeah I'm going to be making a alt(lvl5) before I make my main just so I can park it outside a Ah or near a mail box
---
Don't forget to account for Hawk procs. Which I have no idea how you'll manage.
---
&gt; For them to go as far as to say the things they did, nah, fuck that. I'm 30 now. I don't have time for that anymore.
---
You don't have time for that but you have time to go seek validation on reddit
---
:thinking:
---
What about elemental detestation frost shock for extra melee crit
---
Might be a dumb question, but is there alot of PvE progression on PvP servers?
---
Never said anyone was wrong. Just further explained.
---
&gt;Then the next in line will have to wait 1 more month.
---
Not true.
---
Also no changes.
---
LOL someone in level 50 blues can compete with someone in r14 haha Asif man what bs 3k up vs 6k + more than double the damage
---
Wrong highest dps weapon will always do more and I dont have a high dps dagger. Sooo yea, if I did, Id use a dagger.
---
Don't need further explaining. You've done so much of that you dug yourself in a hole.

A guild for fun leveling, and then raiding when we hit 60. We'll work to get each other pre-raid BiS those final few levels and in the weeks before starting MC. Raids are the last two days before reset, thus the name. :)  I raided through AQ40 in vanilla, and plan to clear Naxx at some point. Not a super-hardcore guild, but not casual either.

Its literally how every private server maintains the server. Or are you naive enough to think they bankrolled it out of pocket? Its common sense dude. Its how all private servers work. They aren't evil for doing it, its the only way to maintain a private server.
---
If I still don't know what to play I'll probably make 4 alts straight away.
---
Til mocking people is mean. Thank you big brain redditor.
---
Show me where I dismissed anything? You are off your rocker.
---
Alchemy and herbing seems like it will be strong just based off resistance pots and lower level health/Mana /trolls blood etc for leveling
---
So Im supposed to use a 14 dps dagger over a 23 dps staff ? I tried that and lost 30 dps.
---
I mean your shit arguments have already gotten destroyed, and you didn't come back with a rebuttal beyond "I feel like the pvp aspect is worth it".  Which is quite absurd.  People log out for days to preserve buffs, rather than do stuff in the world.   Sure, maybe 1 time in a 1000 one raid might clash with another because of buffs, but who cares?  Huge raid free for alls is the worst form of pvp.  It's just a bunch of aoe and chaos.  It's not interesting in any way.  No skill lagfest.  Boring.  And losing the buffs just creates toxicity that destroys the enjoyment of the game for everyone.
---
Where did they farm? I was trying Kobold in Elwynn but I'm usually lvl 8 by the time I have farmed enough cloth.
---
If you didn't get into it before, you probably wouldn't like it. Unless you prefer more time consuming games and have patience, cause classic is more tedious than retail when it comes to leveling.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but the tome of divinity was for the level 12 Redemption quest, wasn't it?
---
Once again, though, this story is *full* of retcons and shortcuts, and a tome from a quest being copy-pasted into the expansion race's version doesn't signal to me that the tome somehow is an artifact with copies present across all light-worshipping cultures across the universe. Not to mention the book clearly much be subject to change given its text mentioning "Paladins" explicitly despite having been present in the First War, before humans had Paladins at all.
---
hawk procs are already included. It wasn't that hard to include tbh, though it did take me a while to figure out the best way to have it. If you're curious how hawk procs are calculated, you can see how I did it on the "Haste Effects" tab
---
I want world buff to drop when you enter raids, but it's not for this reason at all. I think it's an extra layer of "help" added onto the game that is entirely unnecessary, and the game would be more fun without them. Especially when taking into account the social dynamics world buffs create (the need to use them to compare and compete against others).
---
It was the Ribsplitter of the tiger
---
EQ also didn't have raid size limits. Want to throw 60 dps at King Tormax? Go for it!
---
You're adorably stupid.
---
I liked both TBC and Wrath classes better than MoP...  I loved the environment of MoP though and it's my third favorite expansion for that reason alone.
---
Lol nope. They had up to 20k near the end.
---
I don't think you're completely aware of what 20k in a single real-time server means. It's crazy.
---
This. If you really must attack something immediately make it the {skull} and nothing else.
---
A typical warrior pull of, say, 3 mobs is:
---
- rage = 0 (literally can’t use any spell)
---
- range pull (tiny threat on the pack, will be snatched by any DPS or the healer so much as breathing)
---
- press bloodrage, takes a second to tick
---
- have enough rage for one spell, sunder the {skull}, at this point you can DPS {skull}
---
- tab target, sunder another one
---
- tab target, sunder the 3rd one
---
- at this point you are losing threat on {skull}, sunder it again. Now you probably won’t lose it before it dies
---
- tab target, sunder, tab, sunder, now you have the pack well under control
---
That’s like 7 GCDs or more than 10 seconds to have solid threat on a 3-4 pack during which time any DPS targeting a mob that isn’t {skull} will take threat from you requiring the tank to respond.
---
Tank has some tricks and can skilfully handle losing a mob in a few ways but it’s a pain in the ass when DPS just mongo whatever mob on every trash pull in a dungeon with 20 trashpulls and the tank has to herd cats the entire time.
---
Help the tank help you. Focus {skull}, by the time it’s dead you can do whatever you want but the tank needs a bit of time on the rest of the pack before you get your greasy mitts on it.
---
I can hear this comment in my brain. I miss ventrilo.
---
Lol again, if you can't understand what I wrote then it's no wonder your group yelled at you for being so bad
---
I actually didn't know they revamped it until yesterday. I only played it in TBC and it was a fantastic progression experience.
---
If this were true, everyone WOULD be taking ret paladins on private servers. But as it stands, it is still merely that: theorycraft. Theorycraft that says that ret paladins might put up \~70% of the damage of a warrior under specific conditions that require immense amount of consumes.

PVP is all about keeping the enemy from doing that damage. A good rogue could keep a clothie locked down long enough to take it down or at least vanish and start over. Obviously if that clothie just got to unload its damage it would win.

I remember that was a weird transition coming in from EQ. Hunters felt like their group role was to be the puller, but when tanking hunter pulls were a nightmare, WoW threat mechanics really want the tank to pull. Hunters can Distracting shot to pick up their mob.
---
You don’t understand what I’m saying , mathematically it isn’t possible.

World PvP is one thing, getting camped beyond two kills or ganked by capped characters while they kill flight master really ruins the experience for me

A post isnt necessarily for validation. Theres a lot of takeaway in these posts.

Ok so, There is a way to not clip while under improved aspect.

But if there wasn't one, just think about what you are writing for a second please. You are casting autoshot faster, who cares if you clip one autoshot, you already shot the amount of autoshot you would have shot without the proc anyway.

" your guild were fucking idiots to not give pally two handed weapons "

Warriors want these weapons too for pvp. Paladins want them for "PvE", but they do no damage with them anyways so ???

" No one figured out paladin is developed to be strongest and best class in the game"  
---
You're right, noone figured this out because it's not true lol.
---
You literally quoted them lmfao
---
&gt; this was me in vanilla, and i ended up eventually getting poached along with a couple other ppl to the top guild on our server during SSC/TK in TBC. never looked back, never regretted the move. unless your casual guild is extraordinarily lucky/charismatic, this is how you're eventually going to lose your hard carries.
---
Same here, but in vanilla.
---
We initially had a gigantic guild that wanted to take raiding nice and slowly, but still have some sort of progress. For me that was perfect as I liked raiding, but didn't like the idea of having more than two raids a week.The only problem was that 2/3 of the guild simply didn't want to put in any effort, both in terms of items and in terms of strategy, but they would get really aggressive if you tried to sideline them for even a single raid. 
---
Eventually the dozen or so of our best raiders just merged with the current #1 guild on the server and ended up having a much more fun experience because of it. The hardcore players were just as friendly as the casual ones, just as likely to talk nonsense and help each other out, but with the added benefit of always being prepared and never wasting time on nonsense like summoning lazy people or waiting for AFKers.
---
Thank you for your valued feedback =)
---
Nah, I quoted my guild. Not my group. Thats your assumption.
---
As a warrior though the ~~rent~~ repair is too damn high!
---
warriors can heal
---
I think a spreadsheet would care.
---
It's only for PVE utility. If you collect enough caster offpieces from ZG and BWL its possible to bring one into AQ 40 and put him in the same group as the fire mages. Other than that moonkins dont have a place, for PVP you would go 30/0/21 (NS instead of moonkin form)
---
You clearly don't understand much. No wonder you complain, everythings probably so confusing and everybody's out to get you.
---
You're a hero, this site sounds cool but I'm not looking to give out my personal info for it.
---
c
---
hahahah
---
Ha! I'm in. How do we get you the gold?
---
because they gotta get behind you and walking backwards prevents that
---
If you’re in WSG you are doing a disservice to your team by not flag carrying.
---
My suggestion would be to just make the respawn timer go down each time it is killed by a different player. This prevents people from just grinding over and over and when you get 10+ kills instantly by 10 different people its clearly a populated area. So if you are competing with 20+ people trying to complete a kill X/12 quest it makes them pop up quicker until the area cools down a little. Don't do it for rare spawns though, just quest mobs, maybe even just bosses.
---
Who has to get behind you? I don't understand how walking slower prevents that.
---
Hahahahaha. Read the words, dumbass.
---
!RemindMe 50 days
---
I think there will be a drop off by AQ launch.
---
Me too, even just having an alt to disenchant stuff is super useful. GL with Classic my man!
---
Don't you want to be spelladin? This means taking gear from casters and healers right?
---
is trivializing the otherwise trivial content bad for the game...
---
hmmmm
---
Might as well just hand out the fucking welfare epics and open up lfr.
---
Yep, keep proving my point. You dont know.
---
It was worse than that. If you tagged a Devilsaur, a mage on your faction would Polymorph it over and over, effectively keeping it at 100% HP.
---
Thankfully this isn't possible on Classic.
---
Git since 2005, but the Large File Storage extension only for a few years - versioning assets on a regular Git repo will quickly turn it into a bloated nightmare. Note that I have no idea if Blizzard uses Git at all, just talking about my own experience dealing with this kind of problem. If I had to guess, back when WoW released they were probably doing their asset backups on tape and manually controlling which software version went with which assets.
---
Sorry! I made a big mistake when updating the code and it was replying to every comment on reddit. So so so sorry.

OrionSuperman
---
No, they can be resisted. Same result in the end though.
---
I remember grinding forever for that mana worm pet, the PETA quests, the murlocs, all the hunting ones. Just lots of great fun. We didn't need those other things that ruined the community.
---
Hell even flying was fine if it was limited to outland. Blizz could have made up some crap about the flying mounts not being able to portal back to Azeroth, or not able to travel through portals. Could even have it tied to a mount quest where they are terrified of the portals.
---
The simple fact is whoever was in charge really dropped the ball dumbing down the skills, making cross realm, the portal teleports, and turning the dungeons into faceroll loot events.
---
don't play on a pvp server? honestly this shit is not even that deep
---
Aye good luck and hope you get you're mount fast(er) than other people !

booty bay AH trade lol
---
Well the mana pool is good for decursing, but for healing it’s a lot less useful than just being full resto. 
---
And a feral Druid tank ussually won’t be in the tank group, unless there’s two tank groups. 
---
Hotw is fine, but all I’m saying is that if somebody comes at it without a high attention to detail, they could be really useless. Because, even min/max’ed for one role, it can sometimes be hard as a Druid to pull your weight. No matter how good your bres and inervate are, your raidleader will want your numbers to look ok too.
---
E
---
No time frame. Depends of you make the groups or someone else. Also comes down to luck.
---
I haven’t played pserver since Nost but it’s my understanding that nearly every pserver went with 8, and nearly every guide said 8. It also doesn’t change the other elements. If you and your guild went 9 than that’s awesome. But I believe the vast majority of people believed it to be 8, as did most guides. The glancing blow and dodge percentage were also off. I’m assuming from the heat that you’re going to be playing warrior and want to big dick. I’m not saying they’ll be trash. I’m saying it’s unlikely they’ll be as powerful as they are in pservers. Best of luck to you bud
---
Yeah!! I remember I had to settle on mediocre stats on one of the two I got but still remember it being amazing compared to my two handed sets
---
I like it! Would most likely use it for alts.
---
Tanks don't backtrack just because they can. They might need to pull mobs back so melee dps can get behind without aggroing the next pull, or a pat is coming, or they need to get around a corner to pull in ranged mobs.
---
Alliance have better que times, and priest is not a good wpvp class if you're talking about solo play.
---
I was telling my friend about this and how it takes me back to my favorite years of wow. It was when you could build a reputation on a server and it meant something. It’s just one of those things I missed. I can still remember logging on and seeing the same folks on my server and building a rapport with them. Fun time.
---
I still have my ventrilo recordings from 2005 saved on an old flash drive. pretty funny stuff
---
Random question, are you Scottish? Your name and your vocabulary make me think you are lol. I’m probably totally off.
---
I would argue that pservers and then players were inevitable. They didn't make Classic happen, they happened because Classic existed and then didn't. The demand for Classic created pservers. If one person didn't roll a private server then another person did. I rolled my own on deployment for my buddies on the ship.
---
There would have been persistent demand through forumn posts, articles, and campaigns whether or not private servers were able to operate. Classic would have happened because shareholders were comfortable with the use of dev cycles to create classic because demand has remained high.
---
TL;DR pservers didn't make Classic happen, demand from the community for Vanilla made private servers and Classic happen.
---
My 2v2 rating is 1900 and BG rating is 2100ish atm. 
---
Still bad to some but above average.
---
I'll still be twinking out a level 49 BM hunter and 1 shoting clothies as I did in TBC and its gonna be wonderful (for me).
---
It worked on PVP servers too. A same-faction mage could shut down your plans to farm Devilsaur no matter your group size.
---
It's for no lifers, just like ***most*** of the beta invites were.
---
Remember the Ventrilo Harassment YouTube videos?
---
"Four strength four stam leather belt? UNNGGHHH! Level eighteen? HUUU HUUUU"
---
In part, probably because theyre launching the new patch for bfa that week too.
---
What money? I said free.
---
1: Well there's the UI, the complete lack of raid frames and the super zoom. As a healer you need more awareness and I'm barely getting any.  
---
2: Running into things constantly?  
---
3: 1:12, stops by the enemy healer, no scream. Would have ended the fight then and there.  
---
4:  I'd unbind my S-key.  
---
5: Entire 2:30 fight, why isn't he dispelling the enemy FC earlier?  For some reason he thought renewing SW:P after barely a tick was a good idea though? Once he starts dispelling he dies, wonder why.  
---
Stopped around 3 minute mark. He's only dispelling, if that's the meta then anyone who has decursive can do it, and he's only half decent at it.   
---
Seeing as this is TBC times then the "gearing takes too long" excuse doesn't  hold up, you got competitive gear playing casually around S2. I'd love to see him play arena. like this.
---
I get your point, I’m sure they would gain reputation on their server.
---
YOU'RE BREATHTAKING!
---
I made this comment because I didn't get anything but ups- and downvotes for the first 20min, so my "shit" arguments wasn't "destoryed" when i wrote this.  
---
Anyway, why is this absurd? PvP is a major aspect of the game and obviously thats the main reason that world buffs should stay as it is, because they promote wpvp. I've honestly never heard of people logging out for days to save world buffs, thats just ridiculous and I think you are making that up or exaggerating.  
---
&gt; It's not interesting in any way  
---
Thats just your opinion. There's plently of people that enjoy big fights and guild vs. guild.
---
Owl isnt bad. It has swoop, which is a stun. Pretty useful.
---
I believe they are high dps low armor, so probably pretty good for a MM build.
---
The bird type classes get overlooked. I always wanted to try a WindSerpent prt, I heard they had the highest DPS and it was ranged.
---
A streamer with a bunch of friends manipulating the layering doesn't mean that the average joe will be able to do it.

In WoW this is more like "time to leave and reset the instance then immediately do it again".
---
There is not much in WoW that you have to wait to spawn, much less that a single person would wait for.
---
Pretty neat, will check it out when I get home thanks
---
Aye, but not the dwarf kinda Scottish haha, thought it would be easier typing normally than the slang that most can't understand.
---
YTA
---
Ye me either
---
Wow
---
You've made my day u/iDylo 😍😍
---
Yea, I BGd a lot with alts during TBC. Get level x8/9, get some blue gear, you're smashing 90% of players in the BG without thinking anyway.
---
nIcE
---
This is so false. The AH is the best place to make long term investments and huge profit in the first 2 months. Twink items, fire/nature resist potion mats, that edgemasters handguards some noob put-up for 15g, etc.
---
I still have one in my alt bank I never got to use. Along with a ton of other stuff. Wish I could move that over to classic
---
It's all fun and games until there's 20+ troll rogues in the open servers camping your favorite streamer &gt;&lt;
---
I think attack speeds were normalized in the BC, along with ranged weapon speeds I want to say.
---
It would never have happened anytime soon if it wasn't for nost and the subsequent outcry from the community/streamers/youtubers.
---
people over rate travelling on the ground, i'm not going to explore if i have to fight through 2 miles of mobs to just have a look i'm not gonna go have a look.  
---
As for world pvp how much it happened and to the scale it happened is vastly over stated, mostly what would happen is some pleb camping a low level quest hub or flight path and maybe if you as the lowbie had a good friend he'd come and help you get away rarely was it fun, actually it was fun only once in vanilla when my fury warrior friend came to help me in epl; he ended up being camped by the same naked rogue.   
---
during the first month of an expansion i'm sure meeting people while traveling is very fun, i started vanilla about 6 months later and there was almost no one i'd meet leveling, and in tbc it was more like hey that dudes doing this quest i'll invite him; 'hey you doing \_\_\_?' 'yeah' 'sick' do quest and disbanned if you were "lucky" the mob would hit way harder than you expected both die and lol about it.   
---
a lot is rose tinted glasses the game was definitely better than it is now but not the "community" it is largely the same maybe less patient and less helpful because of sites dedicated to helping players how ever being told to "thot" info was not uncommon
---
“should” is the key word. When I out DPS our DPS warrior and then he rolls in my tank gear.
---
Or the Holy Paladin that rolls need on my gear because he “wants to get into tanking
---
PUGs will be PUGs. My salty attitude isn’t for nothing. It comes from experience.
---
I wouldn't say it's not possible , if we are going true classic there might be server issues , but most of this should be cleared up with this amount of beta/stress testing
---
What an amazing bunch of guys, love em forever for this for sure!
---
How can you even mix these up, are there cases where 'could of' would be correct? (Not native english)
---
Same. I miss the thrill of speed healing. I can’t wait to get back on it.
---
Hmm, I'm torn. I just got fired today, so i'm free for it in the foreseeable future.... but I SHOULD find a job before it.
---
Wrong sub
---
Err..Do explain to me what changes have been implemented in 1.12 that would make it impossible for a rogue to 100-0 you when they have all their cooldowns x2?  
---
None, played perfectly a CB+Prep rogue can do it naked, even after every class revamp there was in vanilla, CB/prep was never touched.
---
Rico
---
I knew it! I'm Scottish too haha, just had a hunch. And yeah I get you, people on here would just think you're having a stroke if you typed like we usually do.  
---
None of my friends IRL play anymore, so if you ever want a Scottish pal to play with when Classic is released feel free to shoot me a message! :)
---
Hi. I'm actually interested in something similar.
---
I've added you in discord, if you have some free time we could have a chat later this week.
---
Interesting point of view man! I wonder if it’ll be the WoW killer.
---
You are the one exaggerating about how much wpvp this creates.... basically none.  Just some fucking fantasy you've concocted in your head.  wpvp was never a large component of this game, and will never be.  sorry.  The second bgs hit, wpvp at the tarren mill died instantly.  INSTANTLY!
---
My iMac G4 from like 2003 ran it ok, if a modern Mac can’t then I don’t even know what to say lol
---
I've watched enough to say that it's not multiboxing. YouTube some highlights and you'll agree. They're very coordinated, but not synchronous.
---
if you dont get frustrated easily by laggy servers / queues then go for day1!  
---
i personally enjoy the chaos of game releases / season starts etc but if u plan on laidback leveling you shouldnt book your time off on release imo
---
I thought of this as well. For example, as a Shaman I'd like to be able to filter out cloth. I know that can be theoretically done by increasing the EP value of armor but that's a lot of guesswork. Really really cool site btw. Love it!
---
I feel like I'd need to be 12 to enjoy any of this content.
---
Wsg time get that level 15 BiS.
---
I would expect some issue but I doubt you would not get to play at all.
---
Gnomes are a big schmood, get lost
---
They rarely make it to top 10 daily posts on the subreddit though. I feel like one slipping through every couple weeks is important in a time like this so that the new players can remember how it all started. Of course it will die down in a short time once the game is released and we have a ton of content for classicwow, but for now I say let it be.
---
If she’s going for horse you know she’s a keeper!
---
&gt; So, who was in the wrong here?
---
Yes, dont use rockebiter if tank ask you not to. This is not complicated.
---
If you want to play moonkin, there's nothing wrong with that. It's still not a good spec. Balance as a whole is lackluster in Vanilla and moonkin isn't even the optimal balance build.
---
Handing out stuff is part of \#locklife, and if you don't like it then you should have rolled a hunter.
---
Hahaha you fat fuck! Come here!
---
Bro the boss is that way.
---
Bot made more sense than previous comment.  
---
Good bot.
---
Only changed mains70 Times
---
No it’s just have ‘could’ve’ (the contraction for could have) and ‘could of’ are pronounced exactly the same.
---
Awesome, thanks for this!
---
Dont actually think that ever got patched, just that nobody wanted to play a spec that was only good for 1v1, and only when you had all your CDs up. If anything that spec got buffed when evis got an AP modifier.
---
So consider two players, that are the same class and have the exact same gear level 3 days before a raid night.
---
Player 1 farms for 10+ hours to afford a flask and weekly consumables, runs dungeons with his guild and gets a few slight gear upgrades, and PvPs for a few hours. Player 2 stays logged off in Ironforge to save his world buffs. Which one of these two players should do better in a raid? Player 2 would crush Player 1 because world buffs are just that powerful.
---
And your points 1-3 will all still happen even if world buffs were removed inside raids. People would just use them for fun stuff like raiding capital cities and world pvping after raids, which is what they were designed to be used for.

'We are looking for mature, active and friendly adults with life commitments to help build the guild, from the ground up. It does not matter if you are a returning or a completely new player, or have been playing continuously since release, everyone is welcome. Since we are all adults with jobs and other obligations, our approach is more casual when recruiting new members to the guild and semi-hardcore while raiding. If you want to be part of our community from the beginning, and watch the guild grow in a calm and friendly environment, do not hesitate to contact us! We would like to see you with a good grasp of the English language and 18 years of age or older. Common courtesy applies, to both your guildies and other players alike.

Don't they take a 20% cut? So do I have to give up 25% to pay you your 20%? Or do I list them for your 20% and you effectively get 16%?
---
Why would you come on the internet and just like?
---
Not a robot...

---
If you say so. Prices are going to be so all over the place and there will be so little gold among the playerbase that at the very least the first couple weeks will be a near pointless endeavor. Twinks aren't going to start really erupting until enough try-hards make it to 60 and start the weekly raid lock. Only after the first month will the "above casual but not that sweaty" crowd start to hit 60 and then the economy will really start to move.  After three or four months there will be a heavy population of 60s making alts and buying up material components so that the economy solidifies a little bit.
---
As someone who doesn’t have beta access, this made me lol.
---
Got nothing in return? Lol come on. They aren’t homeles-monk-martyrs; they were compensated.
---
Had a 19 Twink and got gladiator on two characters the first 3 seasons of TBC before I quit. Disagree
---
That's a great advice. I might wait day or two and then play. Thank you.
---
39 twinking &gt; 19 twinking change my mind
---
You got ooged
---
Noice
---
People on the WoW forums seems to think cross faction collusion won’t be an issue in Classic as in Vanilla it wasn’t really allowed. Blizzard went to great lengths to prevent it in game. It definitely is at odds with the spirit of classic, at least imo.
---
Unfortunately people write it off as a pserver thing (which is pretty much was) however it will carry over if something isn’t done about it. When you try to mention it on the blizzard forums it gets shut down pretty quick.
---
To me it’s a bigger issue than layering but everyone is all about layering being a big issue.
---
&gt;Resources will ~~sell~~ be posted for absurd prices...
---
No one will have any money to be buying anything.
---
&gt;That and they want to feast on non twinks. Let's be honest, there is a HUGE power difference between twinks and non twinks. Crushing non twinks is a power fantasy.
---
This comment proves how little understanding  you have of the twink community.
---
I would say there's a high probability that there are going to be server issues day one(and quite possibly extending into week one) if blizzards past releases are anything to go off of. Personally, after the diablo 3 launch I no longer take days off for blizzard releases.
---
Durotar, mostly. I think that a lot of the cloth dropped in Tiragarde Keep.
---
They didn't spend much extra time grinding humanoids, their quest route just ended up with just enough linen.
---
I had "all the time in the world" to play during vanilla and I still didn't bother with an alt.
---
have you never pvped before? doubt you have and its not to offend you, but i backpedal a lot and no one can get behind me because i slow them while i back pedal
---
&gt;Don't be elitist jerk
---
&gt; 5 man dungeons are easy
---
Way to contradict yourself right off the bat.
---
&gt;. My rockbiter enhancement is not going to pull threat from the tank **if he's doing his job**
---
Even more elitism from you, wow!
---
&gt;So, who was in the wrong here?
---
You were. You were told about your rockbiter enchant pulling extra threat and you chose to ignore your party's wishes by keeping the enchant on. You were an elitist jerk who "knew better than the rest of the group" and went against them instead of correcting your own behavior.
---
&gt;PLEASE just let people play the way they want
---
Funny, you seem to be complaining about the way your group played. Lots of contradiction coming from you.
---
TL;DR If your tank asks/tells you to turn off your extra threat then do it, otherwise you're an asshole making your tank do extra work for nothing.
---
Blizzard has never once changed a launch day this close to the posted date and they're doing everything they can to ensure a smooth launch experience.
---
I never said that it was a large component of the game, and you are right, it isn't. Thats why I don't want world buffs to be gone because it would negatively affect wpvp and make it even worse.
---
Depends what timeframe we're talking about. In the first couple of hours? Of course not - nobody will be interested in buying mats or gear or anything from the AH anyway. In the first few days or weeks? Yes, they will. And those who need it enough will pay what the market demands.
---
Toe to toe, I backstab by jumping toward the enemy, spinning the camera 180, waiting for the jump to take me behind them, then right clicking and hitting the Backstab key. This probably isn't the best way since you're "locked" into a certain direction of movement for the jump, but it's what I've always done. Making up for slow reflexes I guess.
---
But I try not to get into toe to toe combat, except against hunters and other rogues, or when Evasion is up.
---
There is a way.
---
[Wayback Machine]
---
I would wait until the week after release to take any extended time off. I plan on playing "normal" hours (ie after work) the first week and maybe taking a sick day in the beginning of August.

Most people who play max level pvp are bad at pvp. Change my mind.
---
that's not true. the top 3 relevant posts on a Nostalrius search are all "Nostralius is where it started", the top relevant post on a private server search is basically the same thing, all of them are in the last 30 days. 3 of them had over 1k updoots. Two of them had over 2k updoots. the newest is at 3k updoots and climbing. plenty of gratitude. i mean at the end of the day people are going to updoot popular content they like and i guess that's just reddit, but i really don't agree that we need posts every two weeks about it.
---
I never had any issues in vanilla.  You might be a better player and may be playing against superior competition though.  My experience was basically doing 75% of the damage any other class did, then healing myself, then continuing dps.  I'd generally win through attrition.
---
&lt;Eye of Insanity&gt; **[A] [US] [Pve] [Pacific] [Hardcore]**
---
**_Introduction_**  
---
Eye of Insanity is a guild formed specifically for those who want to be the best on their server and have fun while they do it. We are looking for competitive raiders who enjoy pushing themselves and their guildmates to always be improving. 
---
**_Goals and Expectations_**   
---
Be repectful of the time that everyone puts into getting together. Have consumables ready, do your research of the expected fights, be online and ready to enter the raid at raid time, and be willing to change and adapt as needed during raids. 
---
During raids during any strat explanation or boss pull, chatter is to be kept at a minimum and everyone should be focused on the task at hand. It is expected that everyone raiding understands that the good of the guild is priority number one, and loot will be used to help us succeed as a whole, not just individuals. 
---
**_Guild Culture_**  
---
Classic WoW is very much a game based around community, and having fun, and we want to keep that atmosphere in this guild. You can both be committed to efficient raiding and still like the people you play with. This is an adult guild, so expect adult topics, some swearing etc.
---
We do expect members to be respectful of each other and the fact that people come from a variety of walks of life. Any racism, sexism, homophobia, etc will not be tolerated. There's no ban on talking about controversial subjects, but try not to get divisive over politics, religion, etc. We all share a common interest in Classic WoW, and the golden rule applies here. We are all adults, and there may be people you just don't get along with. We expect people to be able to handle themselves in a mature way. Anyone causing drama will be removed from the guild. 
---
We interview each member in voice chat to make sure that everyone will be a good fit for the guild and for each other. 
---
**_Raid Information_**  
---
We raid Tues/Wed 7-10:30PM Pacific, adding Thurs as needed (which is unlikely until Naxx is out).
---
We use a loot council comprised of the raid leader, role officers, and rotating members of the core raid team. 
---

---
Agreed about all of that

---
Correct, did you hear it too?
---
It sounds like when I ask my son if he ate the cookies and he says no he didn’t eat the cookies but I knew he ate cookies.
---
1. he doesn't need addons to do his job,  he has the raid frames dragged on to his screen, he has all the information he needs.  also he explained in another video that he plays zoomed in while recording to make better to watch rather than zoomed way out.  
---
2. already explained.  he is using a mouseover macro to dispel people.  getting off a fast dispel is more important than not running in to a tree for 1 second.  he cant mouse turn away from the things hes running in to when hes using his mouseover to dispel.  
---
3. He doesn't use his scream on the priest because there is a chance for somebody on the enemy team to grab the flag even if the flag carrier dies.  you will notice he always saves physic scream for the moment the FC dies to fear the enemy, thus making it easier for his team to get the click for the return.  
---
4. S-key isn't a bad thing considering what he is doing.  its not a bad thing to use it since he is constantly using a mouseover macro  
---
5. oops he didn't dispel during one of the fights.
---
Plus on top of that the paladin has might which stacks with the warriors battle shout and vice versa
---
yet most of this community here just keep memeing private server players/trying to downgrade every accomplishment as being "trash" because it was done on a "private server", who are actually overtuned compared to classic.
---
Anyone that knows how to acquire money will be saving for mounts.  
---
First mounts will start appearing about 4 days in.  
---
An economy might start to emerge after that but more likely the speedsters will trade with friends/guildies.  
---
A proper economy won't start to emerge until after a lot of people have acquired their 60 mounts which will be about 2 weeks in.
---
I remember, at the begining of TBC, I leveled up a priest. At lvl51, I went to WGS. I had bad comments like "Come back when you will be highier lvl. We are going to lose because of you." Sure, I was targeted by the other but... only one guy was able to kill with a hard: an arms warrior with full TBC gear (with some blues from TBC). It happened we won more often than we loose because I was able to keep my mates alive and my mates were happy to get easy kills (because I was the main focus of the other team).
---
So, twink or not, gear helps but a better player with lower will give challenge to a twink.
---
Yeah I remember whenever FoH or Afterlife would kill a new mob and allahkazam would be flooded with pics of the newest loot with those big old guild logos slapped on 'em. 
---
Before I knew about allahkazam I used everlore extensively and liked their epic quest guides and class guides.
---
Enhancement!
---
The actual problem is that AV was designed as a hybrid PvE/PvP battleground but was slowly changed to reduce the PvE component until it became irrelevant. So now instead of appealing to people who want that kind of BG it appeals to no one since people who don't want the PvE element will just play WSG or AB instead, and the people who wanted the PvE element are upset that it was taken away.
---
Thats my boi :')
---
Gotcha! After playing with it making a bunch of different characters, I've noticed two things I would ask for:
---
\- Some kind of selector for weapons. Making a P1 mitigation warrior set, and when I click on weapons I have to scroll through a big list of two-handers before I get down to weapons I would actually use.
---
\- When using two EP calculations, I can't choose which set items are sorted by. I made a feral intended to tank, and added Tank EP and Feral DPS EP. I'd like it sorted by Tank, but it sorts by Feral (Possibly alphabetical?).
---
This tool is awesome. Thank you!

i thought the dungeons were pretty good before they were nerfed, they had some good stuff in them where you NEEDED to do the mechanics while having few enough of them, i think coming from wrath dungeons people were just shocked or overwhelmed compared to what they were used to, players blamed lfd which imo is just wrong, lfd changed nothing about building groups, i used to constantly run shadow labs in tbc and i'd take who ever wanted to come most people did, if you had to run aracatraz or botanica a lot cata dungeon were probably fairly easy for you.

That's why you end up seeing so many engineer goggles on twinks

Theres a reason it was called oomkin before it became boomkin.

none of this trash content was funny...
---
Pservers are exploding in population right now and there is more people in starting zones than on recent stress tests. People are literally spawn camping single mob respawns and if you can't instant tag you're screwed. Since three is no layering I'm willing to bet it's more crowded here than it will be during classic launch. And there's new pserver opening on Saturday which might break all online records.
---
Hahahahaha!!! I'll have a couple twinks. Dont get me wrong, there is fun to be had going into BG's and crushing most everything in your path. But let's not be delusional or try and make twinking something that it's not. Proof is to be had when WoW separated twinks into their own bracket. Twinking immediately became less popular
---
Player 2 only crushes player 1 if they don't die.
---
Healer looking for Weekday only, late afternoon/ early evening English speaking EU guild. Ideal end time for raids would be around 2200 - 2230 server (CET). 
---
I know this is an uncommon time so I am flexible with class/realm/faction (but would prefer priest). 
---
I didn’t raid in vanilla but I did play then. I raided most tiers from tbc through cata, primarily as a healer. 
---
Thanks.
---
I'll probably see how levelling goes, I have six uninterrupted days, so day five looks likely, I might want a bit of a break from my main by that point. I'm thinking of levelling a feral druid alt, getting to 17/18 is around 12 hours, and then I can tank occasional instances to 35, which is where all the decent profession stuff pays off. I'll be able to get groups easily with those people who haven't no-lifed.
---
Tryhards are just annoying tbh. You'd be surprised how many number critters and macro obsessed tryhards aren't very good and overcompensate by pretending they know wtf they're doing.

The US Beta client has the option for Spanish and Portuguese and it's an extensive overhaul (I swapped and tested several menus and NPCs). I would imagine the other two major region clients have similar language options. Kinda curious why my client only has the two.
---
I'm sure your idea is great, but it is quite literally word salad. Structure it a little better if you want people to read and understand what you're saying.
---
nah, you still will take a lot of dmg which means downtime. even with hamstring kiting. hamstring kiting also means you'll take more time to kill the mob, so nothing beastly here. now if you combo with a sham then yes you'll be the strongest class in game
---
if you can snag WW axe at 30 you will def be a monster for awhile tho.
---
Would it be possible to make this not require an account? 
---
Also on a side note. I commend you for being one of the first places there is an easy way to find out the diffrent suffixes an item can get. That i know of. No more digging around the old Wowwiki website to only work half the time.
---
Awesome thanks
---
yeah AV premade will be the main thing during weeks, then WSG and AB will be qued on their weekends only. PVP:ers wants max honor, this is how its going to be done.
---
Nooooooooo I'll be away from my computer in another city. Fuuuuuuuck

"This tells me everything said in vent can be trapped and kept in cyberspace here guys, it's floating around in the atmosphere somewhere"

not if your server have pvp tryharders. gnome is warrior pvp bis and it's not even close
---
Legends whisper of the identities of these heroes of the horde.
---
Some say they are rank 14 veterans driven insane by the grind.
---
Some say they are the former devs of private servers, exacting their unique form of revenge on anyone who makes their living on retail classic.
---
What we do know is they are the heroes we need, even if they're not the heroes we deserve.
---
But they are all elitist jerks from a PS that want to minmax everything. All he's trying to do is maximize his DPS with Rockbiter cause he likes big crit numbers and without rockbiter he can't play the way he wants too and no one should be forced to play a way that isn't their preferred method. So all he's doing is forcing a tank to play a way he doesn't want to play so that he can play his shaman how he sees fit. you know the kinda way where whether he has rockbiter on or not his playstyle doesnt change its just those max dps numbers he's missing out on and that completely changes the playstyle. How dare you go against his logic &lt;sarcasm&gt;
---
PvE is like playing WoW with training wheels on. Facts. Downvote time. Pussies.

Let’s be real here, the real actual problem is the vanilla pvp system altogether. No sane person would say it was good. You forgot to mention how premades avoided other premades and basically only wanted to stomp pugs for the quick honor. That isn’t really “competitive pvp”.

It's just the fee we pay to keep all the poisonous shit out of country.

In Vanilla, I was one of those folks that bought into "PVP is the only true experience" and I was miserable. I'm a very casual player, I'll always be behind the zerg and those saying 'just spirit rez' are completely ignoring the fact that this often happens during escort quests or even near the spirit healer. I only have an hour a day to play WOW, I'm not going to waste it on some machismo 'for the fun of PVP' nonsense.
---
Ignore the bros telling you to 'git gud' or "that's what makes it fun!" They are they ones making it miserable for everyone else. Fortunately they \*are\* going to PVP servers and really, just let them go. They need casual players to beat up on to feel good. I"m rolling PVE for the first time and I'm giddy with excitement. I can level at my leisure, fish all I want, and farm mats. This is the game I want to play.
---
It’s clear OP doesn’t actually want discussion but for anyone else reading this who agree with OP’s stance/actions I have a story for you. I had a lvl 60 warlock and I had just swapped to demonic sacrifice spec because I wanted those huge Shadow Bolt crits. I immediately joined a DM:W run to test out the new spec. Once the whole group had congregated at the dungeon the tank tells me to pull out my imp for the stam buff. I tell him about my new spec and how it requires me to go without a pet. He restated that he wants that stam buff. We go back and forth for a bit but instead of whining and complaining that he isn’t letting me play the game my way we compromise. I’ll roll without a pet for trash and easier bosses so that I can test out my spec and I’ll bring out the imp for larger pulls and bosses so that he gets his buff. I know damn well that the buff wouldn’t really make or break the dungeon but this is a multiplayer game. You will have to sacrifice some personal preferences for the greater good. Do you think I loved being a shadow bolt turret for raids? Of course not but you do it because it’s the best option for the group as a whole. Conversation and compromise will make the game more enjoyable for all.

I've played 5 fresh launch x1 Vanilla Pservers, the same thing happens everytime. The most gold i ever made from early game investments was on Nostalrius, i bought 2 banks full of BiS Twink gear for 1-3g each. I resold each piece 4 months later for 25-40g. Not to mention elemental earths i purchased for 10s, 2 months later selling them for 4g each. Elemental Fire, 10s each, resold 2 months later for 5-6g each. With a little knowledge about the economy and about what consumables will be most used during raiding, you can make an extremely insane amount of money for very little effort.

Too many people are worrying about min/maxing. Vanilla raids are not hard and you can pretty much do whatever the hell you want and you’ll be fine. Sure, you’re not going to out-DPS a rogue but you have utility that the rogue doesn’t have. Does it make up for the missing DPS? Not really, but you can do it, still.

About &lt;Unlucky&gt;:We aim to enjoy vanilla wow in a casual hardcore way, a chunk of our core comes from pservers and dislike the sweaty egotistical scene. Vanilla is a 15 year old easy game and we feel that if you want to play a meme spec then you should be able to. We expect our raiders to show up consumed/enchanted/geared and push their buttons in the right order but won't be enforcing or kicking people out of the guild for making mistakes.

I meant that he has a very large reach into general gaming communities, and this video went pretty viral after nost got shut down and the infamous Brack panel happened. It got a lot of eyes on Classic that weren't already looking.
---
The hunter rotation is pretty simple. You use Aimed Shot and Multi-Shot on cooldown and Tranq Shot when needed.
---
Mage rotation until after BWL is even simpler. It's just Frostbolt with Arcane Power when relevant. After BWL, a fire mage has a bit more more to do. You'll want to work together to get Improved Scorch to 5 stacks and then cast Pyroblast followed by Fireball forever (or until one of your mages is generating too much threat, then you all have to stop).
---
Warlock rotation is the simplest. You throw up your assigned curse and then spam shadowbolt. If you're SM/Ruin, you might be allowed to throw in a Corruption.

***About Us:***
---
Primarch originated  from the server Medivh, we began as a 10 man guild in late Wrath 2010. Over the years we grew both our raiding accolades along with our size. We have a large community of players who have stuck around the guild for nearly a decade. We started off as a semi-hardcore raiding guild in Wrath, began hardcore raiding in MoP and still maintain a hardcore mentality regardless of our raid schedule. We believe in making the most of our time with the raiding hours we have. Many of us cannot commit the same amount of time as we had in the past but we can still be efficient and be part of the competitive upper echelon with our two days a week raid schedule. We are seeking talented players who are interested in being part of an effective and efficient raiding group in Classic WoW that raids no more then 6 hours a week. We have a light-hearted, close-knit community which has grown with each expansion and every recruit, not only do we play Warcraft together but many other games too.

my problem with mythics is they're timed, i will always hate rushing through dungeons. it turns what could be interesting and fun mechanics into stressful at least in legion it was i dunno if they improved them in bfa
---
I don't really get your point. Obviously if player 2 come fully buffed he will do better dps than player 1 that isn't fully buffed. And so what, really? Unless they, for whatever reason, compete for top damage, does it matter?  
---
&gt; your points 1-3 will all still happen even if world buffs were removed inside raids.  
---
Sure, but its much less likely without world buffs being worth it.  
---
&gt; which is what they were designed to be used for.  
---
Says who?
---
&gt; A nelf hunter running into walls in a random Darnassus hut isn't exactly normal behavior.
---
It kinda is.
---
Was this really TBC? I didn't see any blood elves or Draenai in the video.
---
I would agree, except, each of the three Tomes of Divinity has a unique ID and generates unique quests. It's not a simple copy-paste. In addition Blood Elves never had a Tome of Divinity since they had the questline to kill their resurrect target.
---
The inclusion of Paladin in the Tome might be explained as a copy error, or might actually hint at what I'd like to believe which is that Paladins existed pre-Silver Hand.
---
It's entirely possible the Blizz Dev staff just didn't care as much for the Draenei Paladins as they did the Blood Elves... but I'd like to think there was at least some intent, especially how prevalent a Libram appears in TBC's trailer.
---
The current install is ~7.62 GB. No idea if it will change either way upon release.
---
Well, for 15 year old content with bare minimum mechanics outside of Naxx, it shouldn’t be too hard. Most people just want to have fun and it’s not like there’s any guild killers still.
---
Because the queue times became enormous, and you'd only get reliable games if you planned out a set time for premade vs premade. I'd also argue that twinks spend less time queue dodging than some Rank 14 grinding teams did.
---
Regardless, saying that "crushing non-twinks is a power fantasy" just as easily applies to the level 60 warrior who just got his Dark Edge of Insanity and decides to go smash faces in level 60 BGs.
---
Because that is what modern games have trained people to think. That only the endgame matters and everything else is a waste of time. Even the ones starry eyed about the old days of gaming are very prone to this thinking as well.
---
But, there is, so it's pretty cool imo
---
from my perspective, it's the one version of the game I haven't experienced as far as raids are concerned. I have played every other version of it. Not to the highest level, but I played. It's probably much simpler, but simple/imbalanced doesn't inherently mean boring.

Hey! I'm 24 y/o casual gamer (plan to no-life the upcoming beta stress test though). I work in tech, super chill, just looking for leveling buddies to do quest/dungeons and have fun with. Hmu :)
---
Yeesh, too much cringe for one post
---
NicE
---
3 hours? What? I literally played for like 2-3 months at a time and the farthest I got was 47 lol
---
You think the servers will hold out? 
---
No, you lost a bet man. It’s not the leveling that’ll do yah- it’s the servers.
---
Eh I come from over a decade of runescape haha
---
warlock can solo by just dotting them up and jumping down/up
---
its just slower and annoying compared to mage which is pretty simple
---
Probably be on God of War.  Blizzard isn't milking $15 out of me for 15 levels.
---
It's not a matter of being entitled or wanting it for free, but requiring a subscription for beta or the stress test is a really greedy move. I would rather it be completely random or hand pick based on account age rather then requiring subs.
---
I want that Blackfathom deep above the door to my game room in neon nowwwww
---
I basically disagree with all the anti-competition stuff like phased boss attempts, but I think this is interesting:
---
&gt; another boss maybe boss 3, makes it rain for 6 hours after its death reducing movement speed by 15% but increasing fire resistance if you are in the zone when he dies by 30-40-50 w/e as a buff for an hour.
---
Imagine a raid like Naxx where the clear order can affect how well you do. Like killing Maexxna gives +Haste, killing Thaddius gives his mini-game permanently, killing Loatheb causes orbs to spawn for the raid giving a small +Crit bonus, etc. I liked how they did Challenge Modes in WotLK, so this kind of alludes back to it.
---
Awesome - thanks for the idea! Got any more tips/tricks or other items to be on the lookout for?
---
The feeling of danger coming when you least suspect it is vital for me and really adds to the whole experience imo.
---
It also seems to make farming more lucrative, as mats are worth more.
---
I leveled a rogue when I played vanilla. Leveled solo for 98% of it. Social interactions mostly happened in guild chat.  But at 60, I was running dungeons with everyone, making premades for pvp, and wiping hundreds of times in raids with people who enjoyed every second of it. made all my long time wow friends at 60.
---
My old GM used to demand that anyone who really wanted to raid as boomkin bring at least 4-5 stacks of mana pots and 2+ SP flasks every raid  if they wanted to do it well. And he would actually check.
---
BFA is alot of fun for a run through atleast. Then maybe leveling an alt allied race. But he didn't do it in two days, if you haven't done any of it it'll likely take a few weeks.
---
I don't really hate Twinks, but more often than not their response to it is "Because it's fun for me and I enjoy optimizing my character" while ignoring the fact that there will be normal players that are just leveling and wanted to experience a BG only to get stomped into the ground by the Twinks. Yes, you can have fun even while you are losing but there's a limit to that.
---
I can respect your decision to optimize your character and then use it in a BG to dominate, but then you must also respect my decision to think of you as a selfish person that does not really care about making sure that all people involved are enjoying the game.
---
I understand why Blizzard added the XP on/off BGs.
---
it's not the pathing that is the "issue", just the fact that you have a ledge that you can jump up and down. mobs don't jump.
---
Thanks for the reply. That's great news for me then because I can definitely spare that much.
---
Ah, damn! I missed out!
---
Huh. Easier than I thought. Thanks for the info.
---
&gt;blood money
---
i don't think you know what that means
---
No spec has particularly engaging ‘rotations’. Vanilla is either a 1 button attack like locks and mages, or a ‘use skills on cooldown and auto attack’ system like hunters and warriors
---
uhh cata dungeons were definitely better designed wrath was just a bunch of trash mobs that didn't do much besides maybe cast a nuke or heal. it seems like players who weren't tested by arcatraz, mechenar and botanica repeatedly weren't ready for cata dungeons after easy wrath dungeons. i found the cata dungeons fun except for tol borad
---
Even during vanilla the goal was the endgame.  That's what drove people to level in the first place.  The thing that's different than the expansions is that getting to 60 and into raiding was a lot more gratifying back then due to the harder grind.  But the main driver for leveling has always been the endgame.
---
I wouldnt think its boring either and I want to eventually get there as well, but why are people so focused on that (which definitely not why Classic was the game it was) forgetting that 99% of the game is the "getting there".
---
Retail WoW is about end-game; leveling is a chore and all that matters is max level. Classic was almost the opposite; the effort put into the game is during leveling...
---
Oh well
---
For raids like MC during progression you should make sure that your bags are 100% full of shards. There is not a lot of trash in MC to refill your shards, and you will need to hand out some HS after every wipe. You can always delete shards if you need bag space but you cannot just pull shards out of thin air.
---
Warlock duties should be split evenly among all of the locks but there are a lot of lazy/bad locks so you cannot rely on them to do their part. If you notice a particular lock always lagging in their duties then talk to them about it (or have the appropriate person in your guild talk to them about it), and give them a chance to improve.
---
You know your raid time well in advance, it is not hard to fill a few bags full of shards ahead of time. If you have difficulty farming shards for whatever reason then you can ask some of your guildmates to help you and it will speed things up considerably.
---
skip to 2:04  he runs past blood elf priest
---
Got nothing in return? They get the scorn of the ungrateful retail community who belittle pservers and ultimately ruin classic as being a faithful recreation.
---
This will be winter in Australia, so the days are actually shorter - stoked.
---
So..his job is to watch raid frames and spam a mouseover macro, yet he doesn't have raid frames dragged on half the time? So he can barely do that. sounds like a simplified meta for people who can't do proper PvP to me.
---
Better to watch, is he Paul Greengrass? 
---
As a viewer (who got multiglad and r13), I'm not getting the information I need, especially in the first fight., he is probably supplemented by voip but why hinder yourself? Again, who the fuck enjoys this super zoomed video?
---
And yeah "he didn't dispell during one of the fights" is rather important, it's the enemy FC and your argument is that this is 90% of his job. You asked me what I would do differently, I've never twinked but this looked easy as fuck. No need for focus target, DR timers, cast bars, just dispell macro? It's like PvEing with prenerfed decursive again.
---
I would wager that most people that got into vanilla wow as kids, like myself either didn't make it to 60 before BC or spent the entirety of vanilla leveling to 60. I'm stoked to level to 60 and try all the end-game stuff I mostly missed the first time around.
---
You can definitely do that for stuff like leveling or farm content, but it isn't always optimal since you would be incurring the GCD every time you want to send your pet to attack something. I myself combine them for leveling since it's pretty mindless but always macro pet stuff separately at 60. The most annoying part about that is you end up needing a lot of keybinds.
---
Well does it end today? Usually when you cancel sub they finish it the last month you paid for. If that extends into the stress test you'll be good
---
I’ve heard they’re the ghosts of leveling trolls from the barrens seeking revenge
---
I've never played on a PvE server, but some really fond memories of Vanilla and TBC simply couldn't have happened on a PvE server.
---
For example, winning the weekly Stranglethorn fishing competition would not have been nearly the heart-pounding adventure it was (or anything memorable at all, really) without the imminent and omnipresent threat of the opposite faction.
---
Or nearly every trip to MC and BWL, running the gauntlet of Horde gank teams just to zone into the instance at the start of the night.
---
Or the hours spent with multiple raids trying to grief the other side's AQ quest line boss attempts.
---
Again, I've never played PvE, but it sounds super boring.
---
You should probably know that karmagrab or karmawhoring are just reddit jargon for 'attention seeking behavior.' Nobody cares about the points themselves except to measure how many people agree with them, or saw and liked the thing that they made. If you think that there is nobody on reddit who is an attention seeker you should probably see a psychologist about your delusions.
---
Imagine making a new reddit account to post your opinion on a non issue so your main doesnt get negative karma.
---
Everyone has different tastes.  My highest enjoyment starts at level 40 for instance.  The 40 to 60 journey was always my favorite.  Some people just really like raiding.  Some like playing 22 hours a day as well. They like what they like, you like what you like, I like what I like.  Everything will sort itself out.
---
The amount of time you spend leveling becomes infinitely smaller.
---
If you're an average Joe playing 10 hours a week, you'll reach level 60 in approximately 6 months (10 days /played). That's still only 33% of your time by the estimated Naxx release.
---
If you're a hardcore player with 20 hours a week, you'll reach level 60 in approximately 2 months (7 days /played). By the time BWL releases, your leveling experience will only be ~50% of your gameplay and by the time Naxx releases, we're talking about 10%.
---
If you're an extreme player with 40 hours a week, you'll reach level 60 in approximately 2.5 weeks (~100 hours /played). By the time BWL releases, your leveling experience will only be 4% of your game play and by the time Naxx releaes, we're talking less than 1%.
---
Hold off till classic, it will be the best wow experience you will have and what is there today will spoil it for you.  Classic wow was an uphill journey barefoot in snow and its the biggest blast you will ever have in wow.
---
Night want to go watch frostadamus, punkrat, kargoz on YouTube very good content.
---
So do you think if I made a post like this but inserted FFXIV or Guild Wars 2 instead of BfA it'd get as many upvotes? Of course I wouldn't, because the upvotes are fueled by the delusion that classic is going to have more players than retail.
---
Lok'tar ogar, brother
---
Leveling to 60 doesn't take a science like end game bis/rotations/raid mechanics do. People are going to go through that motion anyway. You don't need to optimize the leveling process like you do the raids. There are no questions to ask, really. I don't think people are ignoring that aspect of the game, just rather that there's nothing to talk about.
---
I have been trying this on retro wow and I’m having major issue, how is he getting 1k with dragon breath chilli? Also what is the rotation? He is using consec.,wisdom and judgement is that it? Cuz when I do it my dps is 230 and I run oom in less than a minute
---
He was blaming other streamers for "stream sniping him" just because they were killing him in a battleground and his defense was that he wasn't targeting them so he's can't be a stream sniper.
---
Thanks!
---
I don't think people are as concerned about what hardcore players will do with world buffs, they're concerned about what it'll do to everybody else. So mid-tier scrub kills kicking people because they don't have their main logged out days before their raid with a +10% darkmoon faire, songflower, roids, DMT buffs, rallying cry, ZG buff and WCB because "that's the meta" when in reality it's stupid overkill for BWL.
---
I agree. My point was about all the complaining about streamers, yet everyone seems to enjoy watching these guys "interact" with various streamers on the beta.
---
Good luck Swifty once Classic releases lol
---
In Vanilla Player 2 gets BoP'ed or DI'ed at 20%.
---
Word
---
The game will definitely release on August 26th at 6:00pm EST... whether or not it’s playable / the servers are up more than they’re crashed and down remains to be seen.  I’d like to believe Blizzard has launches down by now, but I’ve learned after many many many MMO launches that nothing is a given and even massive companies like Blizzard can totally botch a release.  Not saying they definitely will, but it can’t be rules out.
---
I had a 19 it was really about collecting gear for me having that end goal it was nice too for a side project not being able to keep up with raid gear I just had to gear once for BIS I plan on making another one just not sure on bracket. It was fun too we had a whole community everyone new of each other on the server made for great times.

---
&gt;And for the record, your guild can start clearing trash and EVEN the first few BOSSES in MC quite easily with 20-30 people.
---
And in cases like this you probably shouldn't expect people to clear trash so that you can come in late, get summoned and have the exact same chance at loot as everyone who showed up on time.
---
Ohh come on, this entire thread is cringe.
---
Of course OP is wrong, there were probably shitloads of decent twinks who could play at max level. Was twinking easier though? Mechanically I'd say yes. Though simplified mechanics can make for a whole other meta, which might require a whole other skillset.
---
But that is a whole deal of might/maybe/could. My experience is that most anyone with basic understanding of the classes can twink.(at least at 19/29/39). Those same people can't just jump into a class at 60(even in BIS gear) and run a premade.
---
I don't remember a list of names being published for this test, however, I did get access and play in this stress test.  I remember it being more of a first come, first serve, get your keys now kind of deal, and I camped the shit out of that site, got in as soon as it was live.
---
I made a few characters, and by the last day I had a level 19 NE rogue.    Spend the whole day fighting horde, we attacked the Crossroads, Ashenvale battles, and a massive skirmish in Redrige. Most people were level 15 - 25, and I saw one player who managed the get a mount.  The most I ever no-lifed a game.  Probably 12-16 hours per day for a week.  I did not repeat that feat on live, where I spent 2 months hitting 60.
---
I know how to not to be stream sniped!

I think you're right...

Summon healer or tank, everyone else better hoof it or be replaced the second you have enough to summon someone else.
---
when did they add lava burst? that ability and the removal of 2hd windfury has just destroyed shaman for me.
---
is this like 2fps?
---
\&gt; but the game literally was not designed to make that feasible. 
---
This is not the choice of words you were looking for. Fully optimized raids are not the only ones who are going to down raid bosses in classic.
---
Yes Kajiit best enchanter name
---
Here's what it looks like to me. Everyone that posts the way you reference, wants to be the best. In a solved game, they have a chance to be that, as long as they have a lot of the currency known as time. It's a pipe dream for them. Most people who long for that don't have the discipline to achieve it. But they love the hope of it. They're classic wow experience is from reveal to one month into release. Once they realize they will not be the first, or the best, they will be back here bitching about something and wanting a fresh classic server.

\##\*\*⭐️Who is Nostalgia?⭐️\*\*
---
Nostalgia was recently founded by a core group of friends that have been gaming with each other for over a decade. Though we all play a variety of different games, the hype of Classic WoW has us eager to relive the wonder and excitement in a version that was much more simple. Though we have ditched the huge CRT monitors, fan grills on our computers, and are now grown ups who work; we are looking to recreate the Classic WoW experience through this social and progressive guild.
---
We are not a longstanding guild and are also not looking for world firsts or Rank 14 pvp, however we welcome all of the possibilities. Our main goal is to create a relaxed yet competitive experience exploring all of the endgame content possible while helping people learn and build friendships - pretty much the Classic WoW experience.
---
\##\*\*⭐️Who are we looking for?⭐️\*\*
---
\- If you’ve never been in a guild, we welcome you to have us as your first.
---

This isnt classic wow
---
&gt; PVP:ers wants max honor
---
No.  Skinner Box Kids want max honor.  PVPers want PVP.
---
Tip:  
---
Don't have your pet's taunt on auto-cast.
---
You usually only need your pet to taunt once and it will keep threat, if your pet keeps taunting, he is wasting energy that could be used to deal damage with Bite/Claw/whatever his DPS spell is.
---
Don't worry EU, remember how much you like to remind NA they are the beta testers.
---
The death music from in game music.
---
well the " Skinner Box Kids " the ones getting the top brackets.
---
I've never had a faction attachment. I've probably spent a nearly similar amount of time on both factions. I also will play warlock and I will be playing a gnome female, If I were to play horde I would be an undead female. It's never bothered me too much. Maybe something like Tmorph will come along and then it really won't matter lol.
---
1 shadowpriest, 4 disc priests.
---
1 ret paladin, 4 holy paladins.
---
2 resto druids, 3 feral druids.
---
5 prot warriors.
---
Warlocks, mages, hunters and rogues I don't really care.
---
What did you do the your "e" in the first "the"?
---
I don't see anything wrong with War being part of Warcraft.  
---
&gt;Back in my day, people fought with honor. 
---
You must have played on a different PvP server in Vanilla than I did.
---
If you don't like PvP, roll ~~carebear~~, sorry PvE.
---
I guess it depends on what you spend your time doing. If it's reading quest text, then it might take you longer but ... once you do the first 20 "Kill 10 Boars" quests, they're all the same really. Until I hit a new zone I hadn't quested in before, I really didn't read quest text unless it was going into some new area in the map. 
---
Just in hopes it had an interesting story. If the quest didn't take me on a magical journey of awe and wonder, I skipped it until I went into the next zone.
---
Doing this, you can easily cut a quarter of your questing time from 1-60. Reading the text is slow especially when you just have to do the same tasks but different mobs 5 times per level.
---
&gt;  is everyone just vending everything
---
Pretty much yes. Once you get to 40 and have your mount, you can pick up Enchanting and start sending anything worth value to an alt.
---
When dire maul releases the economy will be fucked.  be prepared.

##**⭐️Who is Nostalgia?⭐️**
---
Nostalgia was recently founded by a core group of friends that have been gaming with each other for over a decade. Though we all play a variety of different games, the hype of Classic WoW has us eager to relive the wonder and excitement in a version that was much more simple. Though we have ditched the huge CRT monitors, fan grills on our computers, and are now grown ups who work; we are looking to recreate the Classic WoW experience through this social and progressive guild. 
---
We are not a longstanding guild and are also not looking for world firsts or Rank 14 pvp, however we welcome all of the possibilities. Our main goal is to create a relaxed yet competitive experience exploring all of the endgame content possible while helping people learn and build friendships - pretty much the Classic WoW experience.  
---
##**⭐️Who are we looking for?⭐️**

I don't think they'll ever go public with it, hell it might even be a part of a contract...but a little bit after their trip to blizzard they went from being the most vocal part of the classic scene to nothing being said anymore (they even released their server data after the blizz trip but no classic announcement).
---
Call it what you will but I'm betting blizz hired a few of these guys. I mean they did run a server for free which was theoretically worth $48 million.
---
Awesome! I even though being horde, I always like running this dungeon.
---
OP: Rose tinted glasses
---
PVPers:  Blood covered glasses
---
&gt; Not like this fucking meoga, meogi karate kid wannabe lil bitches ganking streamers 3 on 1.
---
Swifty, is that you?
---
No thanks.  I desperately want TBC.  My favorite version of WoW for sure.  Would also be infinitely less work for Blizzard as the entire blue print already exists.
---
They had a donation page homie.
---
Baseless accusations aren't common sense, they are literally the opposite of that.
---
inb4 we gas them up too much and then they becoming big and end up as one of those streamers that this sub seems to hate.
---
you would just try to squeeze back into optimal role whenever forced out of it with bad comps, which means figuring out which hybrids did the best dps, and having an assortment of healers taken out of the pool of hybrids before making the rest dps. As for how you divide up the healers, that depends on a lot.
---
Once the healing spots are full, it comes down to best dps and utility.
---
shamans will totem twist or maybe elemental dps in 20/31 resto spec to drop manatide for mages
---
druids will probably favor feral so their innervate can go to healer/mages, also infinite energy vs small mana pools
---
paladins that aren't holy don't anything, they might say different but schizophrenia is part of their other specs
---
a 40 man with 5 of everything sounds really fun due to all the choices and customizations you could make.

Was it a hunter with the mount? If so..probably me ;)

\----------------
---
**Prologue; the origins**
---
Inspired by the heroic actions of [**Fuel Rats**](https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Fuel_Rats) group in [**Elite: Dangerous**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_Dangerous), &lt;Goblin Rocket Fuel Rats&gt; exists with the sole purpose of helping others in World of Warcraft: Classic.
---
&gt;Well, what is **Fuel Rats** and what is **Elite: Dangerous**?
---
Elite Dangerous is a space-flight simulation game in which the player explores a realistic 1:1 scale open-world representation of the Milky Way galaxy (yes, literally 1:1 scale). Since the Milky Way is mind-bogglingly huge, it is not unusual for space explorers to get carried away and end up stranded somewhere in the void with no fuel. When this happens to you, your only way of getting back is if someone manages to find and reach you to transfer fuel.
---
This is where Fuel Rats come in. These are a group of volunteers who literally go above and beyond to help out their fellow players. There is no in-game system for this, mind you. So each and every member of this selfless organisation help out others through their own means. Their longest rescue mission consisted of five Fuel Rats members finding Commander "Deluvian", a stranded pilot who is 65,788 lightyears from Sol. [**The combined journey took 600 (actual) hours.**](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/02/18/elite-dangerous-rescue-mission-commander-deluvian/)
---
It would be an understatement to say how devoted these players are just to help out someone else.
---
Our goal is to provide a similar helpful environment in WoW: Classic. With the help of some [**Goblin Rocket Fuel**](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9061/goblin-rocket-fuel), anything is possible.
---
**Our guild ideology**
---
We have one goal; helping out any adventurers we come across. Some will come to us for help, but we should always be open to seeking out others who may be in need. Your level, equipment or the amount of wealth matters not. What matters is a healthy and friendly attitude. We do not have set roles for our members (PvE helper, PvP helper, crafter etc.) because we want you to be exemplary members of the Horde; no matter the activity. We only expect you to be kind to others, guild members and non-guildies alike.
---
As long as you wear the &lt;Goblin Rocket Fuel Rats&gt; guild tag, you should always remember that you are representing this guild with your actions. Treat others the way you'd want them to treat you; don't ninja loot, don't spam the chat, help out low level players in quests and dungeons, give them food and potions and buffs, and perhaps some 6-8 slotted bags etc.
---
**Guild Events; it's not just helping but also having fun!**
---
Helping out others is not the only reason for our existance; obviously we should be able to enjoy the game on our own as well.Such as;
---
* 5 man dungeon runs (leveling dungeons, max level dungeons)
---
* World PvP
---
* Molten Core / ZG / AQ20 / BWL / Onyxia runs should be doable with enough people. AQ40/Naxx is not on our scope.
---
* Attunement/key runs
---
* Some light Battlegrounds (when they are released)
---
* "Fuel Runs" where we go out to the wild and help random players
---
**Epilogue; closing thoughts**
---
A little background on myself; I've played WoW almost religiously starting from final stages of Vanilla all throughout Wotlk and beginning of MoP. I did almost everything aside from AQ40/Naxx and PvP ranking. Much like many returning players, this time around I'm too old/busy to have a similar playstyle. Instead I just want to kick back with some friends, and enjoy mainly the social aspect of WoW. I will most likely be tanking 5-mans and offering free food/portals/enchant services on a mage alt as well.
---
The reason I wanted to start this guild is to provide a friendly environment. If I can make one person happy, that's a good day for me. I'm also starting this guild on (Oceanic) PvP server so with some luck I can take revenge on that level 55 gnome rogue who is harrassing those poor level 30's.
---
Feel free to contact me on here via a PM, or join us on Discord. 
---
Thanks for your time.
---
They think we want TBC and Wrath but we don't.

**Elite Dangerous**
---
Elite Dangerous is a space-flight simulation game developed and published by Frontier Developments. Piloting a spaceship, the player explores a realistic 1:1 scale open-world representation of the Milky Way galaxy, with the gameplay being open-ended. The game is the first in the series to attempt to feature massively multiplayer gameplay, with players' actions affecting the narrative story of the game's persistent universe, while also retaining single-player options. Elite Dangerous is the fourth game in the Elite video game series.

Luckily it was from a rare drop, you didn't need to win the whole thing
---
[I disagree](https://youtu.be/hdo6OdQAWBg).
---
I'm sure *someone* cares about "top brackets".
---
Sounds like someone been watching Asmongold.
---
colorful language for humor, don't be such a smooth brain
---
yeah everyone who wants to get above rank 11
---
That’s good to know. I never had a lot of issues with pets so I never used many macros but I thought I remembered seeing them discussed. Definitely don’t want to waste your GCDs at 60!
---
Cool beans, every other server accepts free money too. Its not enough to keep a server afloat.
---
Moonkin form is strictly a PvE talent in classic, because in Pvp druids work best bouncing around forms and taking advantage of their entire kit. Also moonkin locks you out of IS, healing and limits your engineering plus healing.
---
That said Balance damage was still really nice if you excluded moonkin form. I used the build below to push to rank 12 horde general. Mainly this spec and a few specs picking up NS instead of FC. 
---
**Balance/FC/IS pvp spec**
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/BaUzDx6AAjORAjME
---
shaman can use windfury without being enhance
---
paladins can bless without being ret
---
that's the problem. and its not about completing the raid, that's "easy", but doing it in 50 minutes it's not easy with aren't optimized.
---
I find it kind of odd too.  But maybe some people like to minmax leveling and raiding.  I get that, I love minmaxing.  But I love STV leveling/fighting more.
---
If you view TBC a mistake.  I sure as hell don’t.  First half of WotLK was fantastic also.  Dungeon finder which was added in the T9 patch was 110% a mistake tho, and one I’d hope they’d consider deviating from if Classic WotLK ever did happen.
---
Like I said:  PVPers want PVP, the rest just want their shiny reward.
---
That is a VERY above average disparity.  The issue is people going in with many slots not having gear at all at level 12 hoping to compete.  No amount of skill will make up for a gap between a half geared lvl 12 and a 19 with even 2-3 greens (depending on class)
---
I'm not sure I agree. I'll try explain.
---
Ganking lowbies, camping corpses etc was always a part of classic WoW. Sure, not everyone did it, but it was certainly pretty common when I played. 
---
That was the nature of PvP servers, that was their point. It doesn't matter what level you are, or what you're doing, if a player of the opposing faction see's you then there aren't any rules. 
---
As for the Ooga gang, I think they're hilarious. They're doing exactly the type of thing that Classic was good at - letting the players write their own stories for the community. 
---
If people don't want to be part of world PvP activities, they can choose PvE servers. That's what they are there for.
---
I wrote up this whole different response for you at first. It was pithy and sarcastic, involving lighting prayer candles for parents of autistic children such as yourself. And you know what, even that got exhausting half way through. Somehow, you even managed to drain the fun out of sarcasm. 
---
Look kid, real talk for second, do you understand why everyone is mad at you? Do you think it's because they owned them all so hard with your "logic"? Or do you think it's because people were having fun meming and here you come in with "hey what's going on in this thr... HYBRIDS CAN'T DEEPS!!!1" and then proceed to have a bad-faith argument where noone can even tell what it is you are arguing exactly. 
---
Read the room, man. Nobody wants to sit here and try to pin down your exact arguments. Or even to argue. It's exhausting and pointless and there are other threads for that. They came here to commiserate with others about a somewhat common annoyance in a comical setting.
---
I don't know what game you played back in the day, but getting ganked by rogues while fishing is exactly what happened all the time in Vanilla.  Same with getting attacked while fighting mobs. 
---
I'm rolling on a PvP server, and fully expect an honorless shitshow, because that was the PvP server experience was back then.
---
Give me some time and I'll show you.
---
Nicee
---
yes, make a level 1 character and give it like 10g. Walk to Winterspring set hearth in Everlook (you can get there fast by dying in a certain spot in Azshara and spirit ressing in Everlook). Run South, all the way across the bridge past the Frost Giants, theres gonna be a cave  with an Imp vendor that sells Felcloth for 90s each and Gromsblood for 10s each. BUY ALL OF IT every single time its up. Free money. Nobody will tell you this, i made a post about it and got downvoted lol. Also buy Patterns, stuff like Major Healing pot recipe,  recipes needed for HammerSmith/Axe smith, theres one for Enchanting i believe its Arcanite rod, vendor in Moonglade sells it its extremely sought after and always being camped. These are things i can think up off the top of my head
---
Blizzard literally twitted it before classic was announced
---
corpse camping was extremely frowned upon by everyone.
---
&gt; Back in my day, people fought with honor. You saw a lowbie or someone at low health fighting something, then you didn't just annihilate them.
---
I had about 100 days /played by the time TBC released and I never ever did this. Red = dead.
---
TBC server when? Classic is so yesterday!
---
15 years ago it was weird to say 'lol', 'lmao', 'rofl' etc. Nowadays it's weird to say twitch emotes to convey emotions.
---
At the end of the day however, they aren't going anywhere, so you better accept them or become a grumpy grandpa.
---
I believe its mostly agreed that raiding in Classic wasnt all that enjoyable
---
&gt; lack of balance
---
It depended on what vanilla server you were back in the day. Some servers had a shitty community, while others tended to be more respectful. 
---
I remember growing up on the tough streets of Gorefiend. No one showed pity. No one showed honor. It was a blood bath. Much like the private servers.
---
A fond memory I have is when I was playing the vanilla beta listening to Green Day's Boulevard of Broken Dreams. I was playing in the early hours of the morning like 4 or 5 am in the Barrens not a soul around. There is a lyric in that song that is repeated about walking a lonely road. Was very topical at the time.
---
I personally will be maining the same faction as before (horde) but I will be leveling an alliance character on the side to enaure that I get the other perspective.
---
Broooo, during Wotlk me and my buddies would SPAM av weekend for the exp. it was so fucking fun. God damn those are some good memories
---
Myself, my wife and her boyfriend are all going to roll on a pve server because we're looking to find more like minded people.
---
Reminds me of the different fonts used for the heroes, villains and locations in the game sentinels if the multiverse.
---
&gt; 5 prot warriors.
---
Fail.
---
I disagree with you, yes they look smoother and the textures are better as well as more defined.
---
but they also look like they will run up to you and hug you as oppose to kill you.
---
saying they are better in this case is subjective.
---
there are various things that come into play when you look at a model and judge it.
---
overall I think the old model is better.
---
Still won't make people do it, it's a waste of time.
---
I recovered my Mop account a few days ago. I doubt there’s much interest in a Mop account since visually u can’t tell as it’s all transmogged
---
please no, let classic stay classic forever and use its lessons to improve the current game. coming back in 14 years to make a classic classic wow would be awful.  
---
i think most players they can get back will check out each new expansion and if the games improved it could be good again, i don't think it'll happen so long as there's a store and a sub fee though it wreaks of minimum cost with maximum yield &gt; a fun game.
---
It seems like you think raiding is the endgame of classic- and for some people it might be, but for me, and many other, it is not.
---
I raid so I'm stronger in the world, I farm consumes so I'm stronger in the world, I PvP because I enjoy it and also so it'll make me stronger in the world, and while I'm doing all of those previous things, I'll be playing, having fun in the world.
---
That's the ecosystem that isn't just raiding that makes Classic Wow fun imo.
---
A ret with Nightfall is pretty decent. And even a ret will contribute more to the raid than too many healers just standing around doing nothing.
---
People were hesitant to use consumables in DUELS not in WPVP.
---
Rogues ganked all levels while fishing since the first days of WoW.
---
People play on PvP servers because the servers feel more alive. Every task and every resource you gather holds more weight than on PvE servers.
---
Swingers?
---
At least the Horde has Thrall at the helm in classic instead of zombie hitler waifu. 
---
I do wish they would add Dwarf Shaman to Classic. I'm #nochanges on literally everything else except this. Give Dwarfs shaman and horde sunwalkers. Would have to make new quests for totem / charger mount but it could be done while remaining true to vanilla's core RPG roots.
---
From a multiboxing perspective..thats a very...odd group.
---
i agree i feel like the new model feels like playing a gorilla
---
&gt; corpse camping was extremely frowned upon by everyone.
---
Well obviously not by *everyone*...
---
ITT: PVP solutions to a PVP issue; nothing to see here but tears.
---
Human female, so no.  I don't remember what class.  Wasn't the paladin mount, if that was even in game yet.
---
That wasn't my experience. People knew the possible consequences of playing on a PvP server. If they wanted to completely avoid any possibility of being ganked or corpse camped, Blizzard had PvE servers for those people. I don't see this as an issue. It was part of the game.
---
Right, it was Taboo....and some players didn't care. 
---
Those players made names for themselves and wrote their own stories on their servers. 
---
Let people play how they want. That comes with any game with PvP in it.
---
The only part that concerns me is you thinking an Undead Female is pretty.
---
You realize necrophilia is illegal in like 90% of the modernized world right?
---
That being said, always play with your friends. Having the same-world context in your conversations is so important.
---
Guess I walked right into that one too.
---
If it's red, it's dead.
---
It was widely believed that corpse camping could get you banned.
---
&gt;Why would Blizzard hiring Nostralius devs need to be a huge secret?
---
Because going public with hiring some people you also sent a C&amp;D to over IP rights...especially about an issue where you were caught being 100% wrong on...usually isn't the best publicity for a business.
---
The nose on the old model just makes no fucking sense.
---
Howdy to you
---
You are 100% correct with your comparison. A T2 or better geared player against a fresh 60 is definitely the equivalent of twinking. A fresh 60 has no chance unless the better geared player is complete trash.
---
The advantage to making a twink is it takes FAR less time to max out a twink's gear and enchantments than it does for a full 60. This way you can jump into the fray fully ready quickly. It's one of the reasons why I like having twinks. Once you max out your gear and enchants, you can work on the actual skill side of making yourself better
---
that ***should be*** counter intuitive in a perfect scenario but it's actually true for most players
---
It wasn't frowned upon on my server.  Sure, people might think you're being a dick but everyone knew that things like corpse camping were just part of the game.
---
R is my movement binding.  
---
Blink, Divine Steed, Ghost Wolf, Blazing Rush, Aspect of the Cheetah, Fel Rush, etc.
---
R for Rush
---
Yeah you’re properly mentally ill. Even after I point out that everything you said I agree with you still feel the need to call names and talk down to me.
---
I really hope you get help for whatever is ailing you.
---
go play pve carebear
---
People were hesitant to use consumables because they were poor. That's it.
---
WORYERS, LEARN HAMSTRING METHOD MY BROTHERS!
---
Moonkin aura only affected the party in classic and TBC, it was changed to raid wide in WOTLK.
---
the design is basically something like a minotaur, its half human half bull. the new nose looks like a dogs nose.
---
the old noses where perfectly fine.
---
FOR THE HORSE!
---
THROLL IS THE BEST WAR CHIEF.
---
Sorry - real time is real life. In game time is the amount of hours played in game. If you type /played it will tell you how many hours you've logged on your character.
---
At that point you can just turn off chat completely since it's part of gamers vocabulary these days.
---
That's probably true lol.
---
Sorry, I rushed exalted on release and already had it when I re subbed. I think there's a quick way to get it but it might take a week or two of world quests
---
Get off my lawn
---
I personaly didnt like the new modeles untill i played with them now im in love with them and really hope they allow us to switch between the 2 modes in classic like retail but if not im cool with old models
---
O O G A G AN G Z H I T
---
it's more realistic that way. 
---
no one wants to grind to high level for no reason at the end of the day.
---
 &gt; Fully optimized raids are not the only ones who are going to down raid bosses in classic.
---
Oh for sure. I am merely trying to manage his expectations.
---
Why? Jump runs are that profitable?
---
I've said this in a lot of different threads, but if anyone here is currently playing on a private server and is frustrated with all the level 60's ganking you at low levels... it won't be AS bad on Classic.
---
What keeps someone from ganking a level 28 area all day? They can't progress in the game by doing it for one. They'd actually gain something by farming gold/rep/mats, getting gear, leveling, raiding, bgs, etc. They have a much stronger incentive to do this than to stay in Redridge all day.
---
However on private servers, there is nothing to progress to. The servers all have a definitive death day. Farming gold is meaningless. Getting through a raid is meaningless. Farming rep is meaningless.
---
They get just as much ganking a level 28 area all day as they do prepping for a raid or trying to get some dungeon loot or something. 
---
Will you get ganked by 60's in Classic? Yes. Will it be as bad as it currently is on private servers? Absolutely not.
---
Damn. If I can’t be an exclusive race/class combo, then I have to cross warrior off the list.
---
Become a beast on your server so no1 fucks with you but only noobs that dont know better

I'm Horde at heart but nothing will ever, EVER beat chilling in Ironforge back in Vanilla.  To this day, it is by far the best zone in the game and I'm still salty that Ironforge became a ghost town after Stormwind became the main hub.  
---
If there is any reason why you should go Alliance, its Ironforge.

Now for my Woody Allen impression.
---
Because no one wants to play something that they wont enjoy at the end
---
Except the tank never asked me to do anything he simply made a statement. This is not the same scenario but I'm glad you accomodated him, though.
---
Wasn't it open at some point?
---
Well, you didnt read anything. The tank never asked me to do anything. He made a statement, one that he gave no follow up on or anything.
---
I happened to be reading reviews on that gamepad last night and some confirmed my immediate thoughts - the F keys are farther away that a standard keyboard.  
---
I have a serious lack of dexterity in my hands though (seriously, I can't reach my pinky with my thumb on either hand) so if it works for you, awesome.
---
I used to play with a Logitech G15 gamepad and MX Revolution Mouse, that was a killer setup, so many easy bindings.  
---
Side scroll mouse wheel is awesome for twitch reflexes, left for interrupt, right for defensive CD.
---
That was propaganda spread by pussies. Blizzard did eventually have to issue their official stance on these matters. If its a PvP problem, it has a PvP solution and they're not getting involved.
---
People thought the same thing about Mind Controlling someone off a ledge, or a boat/zepp, or into some lava lol.
---
I thought the same thing. It could be twisted that he sarcastically said "okay" but it's a stretch at best
---
What? My Cruel Barb is totally normal for my level... With a Crusader enchant on it, of course.
---
I'd love to be on a pug like that from time to time on a alt (feral dps!) or with pvp warrior talents if im already heavily geared. it's actually one of my classic goals. a 40 man druid raid would be sick lol.
---
on my main raid? hell no!
---
1 Feral Druid OT, 4 Resto Druids
---
5 Hunters
---
5 Mages
---
1 Shadow Priest, 4 Holy/Disc Priests
---
5 Rogues
---
1 Enhancement Shaman, 4 Resto Shaman
---
5 Warlocks
---
1 Prot Warrior MT, 4 Fury Warriors
---
That's 2 tanks, 12 Healers, and 26 DPS.
---
Whenever we don't need that many healers, they're smiting/bolting/moonfiring, or just AFK.
---
Noice. Make sure you roll a Paladin so you can continue giving them your blessings. ;)
---
EU and other regions shafted. Such a scumbag move not to mention this at all at the very start of Beta testing. But I guess nobody could expect nothing less from Activision \o/
---
bunch of feral cats shredding/full energy FB/MCPs on vael can definitely kill him easily. no need to power shift or anything. it's way stronger than spriest btw.
---
dad?
---
Facts
---
Because over the years I've done the leveling grind sooo many times I'm sick of it. I just want to get it over with so I can get some tier pieces before PvP starts for real. 
---
There are also a lot of people who don't want to fall behind on gearing at 60. There are no real gear resets in vanilla like in modern WoW. There are still items in MC that are worth getting during Naxx and by the time Naxx is out, MC will probably be relegated to some off-raid day that nobody wants because Naxx/AQ requires a pretty big raid schedule. This is especially true with BWL so gearing your raid up sufficiently so that you can get a week 1 Nef kill is pretty important. Tear, rejuv gem, DFT, mage trinket are all BiS or almost BiS even in Naxx and you want them on as many raiders as possible.
---
I don’t think people are necessarily against the change itself, but they are worried that once one thing is changed the flood gates will open
---
Please stop, I can only get so erect.
---
Okay, how would you tank 4H then? With prot paladins?
---
I was already planning a sub optimal build anyway sooooooooo
---
It made whatever rank you had previously achieved at max selectable as a title.
---
Which means it removed the ranks.
---
Its HIS group and he doesnt want your useless ass in it. Retadins are the ones with the inferiority complex lol.
---
You are literally playing a sub par spec and getting upset when players dont want sub par specs in their group lol. I encourage you to play what you want but i i know who i will be choosing between a  mage and a retadin.
---
Or using 'then' as a comparison.
---
&gt;I'd rather play rouge then Hunter.
---
Oh really, why don't you play your Hunter first?
---
&gt;Are you retarted? I said I don't went to play Hunter.
---
NOICE!
---
Ret has repentance to substitute poly
---
That's what i remember to, but that was 1.0. 1.12 will def be considerably larger
---
Well ill be ganking those dumb asses while they try to level

Moonkin aura provides 3% crit to your group. Let's assume it's a group of four warlocks.   
---
Those players might value 1% crit at roughly \~12 spell power, or +36 per player. 36 x 4 = 144.   
---
In other words, your 31 point talent is worth about the same as **ONE** flask of supreme power.

That will never, ever, ever make-up for the damage lost by using a moonkin.

yeah don't, i did theres heaps to do, none of it interesting or engaging. dungeons are all speed runs. world quests are uninteresting, ap is uninteresting, the talents from it are kind of interesting i guess but not something that change your gameplay, reps are worthless beyond unlocking aesthetic shit, profs are worthless,  i did 2 island expeditions and i don't really get what the point is beyond get a little ap, i did a warfront and i didn't get it either it was basically a rush like running av but with no horde even trying to turtle it or rush against us. LFR is the same as LFR in SoO with pseudo difficulty, i also went to level an alt just for something to do got bored after going from 100-110 casting the exact same rotation on every single mob. other than that i haven't done much and have no interest in doing any of it again.
---
use your game time to farm gold on retail (as shitty as retail is. farming gold is farming gold) and then you can pay for beta/classic time with gold farmed
---
You should have waited a day. Then you would have had the big 69.
---
It’s just a very different experience than regular BGs. It almost turns into a game with henchmen mobs that are easier to kill and periodic champions. The ones in regular questing gear become farmable henchmen while the twinks duke it out. And as the server ages, you’ll see more twinks and it becomes more competitive/diverse. 
---
The best IMO is dueling. Idk it just feels very gratifying to beat other super decked out people to prove your small tweaks, choices, and timing can come out on top. It’s like it’s ok ranking system.

I am taking two weeks off. (My boss actually asked me to use some time off as i had banked too much).
---
My wife is cool with it because ill be around and home. 
---
I expect the first day to be exactly like diablo 3 shit show.
---
 I actually had a diablo 3 lan party at mine that lasted 3 days. So that first 12 hrs of downtime was fine because we sunk a few tinnies and ate fairy bread and relived old pc gaming memories (heroes of might and magic 3 fun) 
---
Im doing similar for this launch with a few homies over discord (a few will be lan'ing with one another). 
---
Personally ill be keen for a shit show and lots of shitposting.  Then 15 days living as a NEET will be fun.

At best he's specifically calling Venruki a stream sniper. He absolutely isn't saying that anyone that kills a streamer is a sniper. Nice clickbait tho.

Source for this? I want them to run it up to wotlk for sure so I can play every expansion I loved on legit non p2w servers filled with goons who think pserver realm firsts are important.

&gt;Back in my day, people fought with honor. You saw a lowbie or someone at low health fighting something, then you didn't just annihilate them. Classic wow was about HOW you won, just as much as winning.
---
At this point I just have to conclude that all your threads are low-key troll attempts just to see how many fall  for it.

They were in the lore, and are mentioned in game.

Vanilla Darkshire would disagree with you.  I cant even remember how many times Horde Hunters would hang out on the top of the Inn and snipe low level Alliance players below.
---
What is early server life like?
---
Do it
---
There's a big gap between SM axe and Mara axe. If you didn't mind losing the axe spec crit you could go for the slow 2h mace from ulda. The top end damage improvement makes up for dropping axe crit I think
---
just a suggestion if you want to test classes for classic go to an insta-60 pserver.  retro-wow is a good one
---
wtf zud, why are you spreading these lies about me?  I thought we were friends?
---
Try female nightelf.  Their flips are pretty fun.
---
no they didn't. 
---
Damage/healing ALWAYS existed in Vanilla. (though for it's stat weight was less efficient than a pure damage type (such as stacking +arcane damage gear, but unfortunately +arcane was rare outside of "Of Arcane Wrath" items, so for most hybrids or holy damage users stacking +damage/healing was your only option) which was typically about 20-30% more or +healing which was about 50-60% more)
---
TBC added a small amount of +damage to pure healing gear (~1/3 of it's healing value) so healers didn't strictly require a 2nd set to farm anymore, but they had different values.
---
But +damage/healing ALWAYS affected both (as did the weapon enchantment for +30 spell damage/healing, but the healing version was much better for actually healing since it was like +55 healing vs +30 damage/healing)
---
You play the game your way and I'll play the game my way. This is like the DH in the NL debate in baseball. Neither side is going to ever agree.
---
It is just soooooo much effort like jumping out of your skin to make it in the realm of possibilities, impeccable gear and enchants and consumables and lots of guilds waiting for you to get the gear....I’m tired just thinking about it...holy is good for a reason.
---
Niceu
---
Buggy lol
---
It's not even about having better gear (though of course that can be loads of sinister fun), it's about everyone being on the same playing field. The best PvP I've ever had was in 50-59, since Burning Crusade had just come out, and everyone had access to greens and blues from Outland that instantly gave them BWL-AQ40 stats. It took a ton of time to level to 59, but once you were there you could fully gear up and be PvPing in a day. 
---
I think of it like pre-cross-server BGs, where you'd create rivals and know who the threats are by name.
---
How do you feel bad about killing people that can't fight back?  About the people that won't even fight back?  How ddo you just execute someone like tha and feel nothing?

That's not what he's saying come on dude. I know REEEEE STREAMERS is like the current bandwagon but really do you really need to manufacture this shit?
---
World of Warcraft is by far the best MMO available to-date.
---
You have two options:
---
1. Play Retail where a majority of characters are max level and many of them have been playing for years.
---
2. Play Classic where no one has anything.
---
Sure, there will be plenty of veterans, but they're still on the same level playing field as you. All of their knowledge is public. You could walk into Classic totally blind and still have a good time with a lot of players. I wouldn't say the same about Retail (mostly because the leveling experience is so fucking lonely).
---
You'd be surprised. People became infamous for shit like this in vanilla. Today I looked up people who've signed up on vanillafriends.com on my old server. 15 years later I still remember the names of the infamous ones that I used to do battle against constantly. The ones that made you rage and you made them rage. You hate them but you love them. But you hate them. 
---
All without streams.
---
everyone you mentioned are casuals lmao, hardcore and "extreme" player taking 2+ weeks to get 60?
---
For real. Isn’t it weird that the people we watch stream classic are streamers. I wish I could watch people not streaming it /s
---
&gt; Do you see me going after any of the streamers? No.
---
What that sounds like to me is "I'm not going to kill streamers in PVP." which just sounds dumb.
---
This will save me all of 20 seconds.  Thank god...
---
Weird, they're going on CST? Never seen that from blizz tbh.
---
Any chance you have a link to the other blue post? Not saying they did not say CST, I'd just like to read it myself .
---
This isn't an opinion
---
Keep in mind they held blizzard hostage and threatened to give their source code away to another private server. When blizzard didn't update them they gave out their code. No wonder blizzard doesn't work with them, they threw away their chance
---
Man, that name did not age well.
---

---
AHAHAH... should we tell him, guys?
---
When should I make a bank alt?
---
The main things you'll want to back up are the Interface and WTF folders.
---
Mainly the WTF folder if you don't mind losing addon settings (which might break the addon on launch  if things have changed)
---
I think the female undead is the prettiest race in the Horde faction. But good point, having a good crew of people both in and outside of the game is important. 
---
I know I’ll grow tired of the Horde cities I think. I’ve been playing from the ages of 10-25 to give you context of my WoW experience thus far.
---
More like 20 minutes but feel free to be a smart ass
---
I don't feel bad, but I certainly don't feel nothing. I feel joy. Every single second of pain I can cause even a single member of the opposite faction is a glorious second for my own.
---
I haven't seen enough of him to have a negative opinion on him - he seems to be an alright guy having a lot of fun playing a game he loves. 
---
But I've just seen clips of him on Classic Beta highlight videos. I don't actually watch him or any streamers.
---
&gt;but I believe its mostly agreed that raiding in Classic wasnt all that enjoyable
---
Except for all those people who enjoyed it?
---
&gt;but why be so eager about optimum builds and rushing to the end?
---
Cause we like doing that?
---
&gt;I remember Classic being a lot more gratifying
---
Cool. relive that
---
&gt;I thought everybody who wanted Classic was looking forward for the trip, not the destination. 
---
Except for the people that liked the destination. Fuck the trip to get there.
---
&gt; Leveling was THE game
---
For those who liked leveling. Other people didn't enjoy it.
---
&gt;But all I see is "will I have a spot in the raid, how viable is X, what tops the meters, etc"...
---
Maybe because other people like raiding, being viable, and working hard to be top on meters?
---
#don't yuck someone else's yum.
---
Thanks! I was looking for it because I didn’t remember mouseover being used in Vanilla, but I guess I missed that one.
---
Meh, it would have made economic sense to do so. U less you can point to aoment when there were 12 million active players on private servers of course.
---
Subs have been steadily declining for years which means revenue has as well. It would make economic sense to  re-release the game at a time when it would be most profitable to do so.
---
It's always been one of my favorites! I still remember staying up past my bedtime to do it my first time on my druid when I was like 12 or 13.
---
Battle for Azeroth
---
Subbed back for beta, sub ends today LOL
---
Now I have to decide if this experience it worry $15 to me... Although I already have the money on the bnet wallet, I was gonna save it for release day sub
---
Isn’t any pro player a try hard?
---
I always feel overwhelmed on insta 60 servers cause I never learned what all these new abilities do and the proper rotation and mana managing
---
You right, you right
---
Woah woah woah don’t drag me into this thread

I personally like his "if you have infinite amounts"

Warlocks start with putting their curse up; Curse of Shadows, Curse of the Elements or Curse of Recklessness. If there are more than 3 locks you might not have to do this. Then, depending on your setup, you put up corruption on the boss and any adds. Usually there are 2-3 spots for dots and usually some warlocks call dibs on them. As a lock CL myself I will allocate them to the best locks on progress and worst locks on farm content and of course SM first. Most likely though you'll have so few locks in your raid that you won't have to deal with this. And lesser geared warlocks are usually aware enough to just leave the dots for the geared locks. Sidenote: it's important to remember this when looking at damage logs afterwards, using dots will add about 15-25% more damage so you have to take that into consideration when judging someone's dps. 
---
Then you start spamming shadowbolt. Because of threat you'll likely have to lifetap before your mana runs out. In general it's good practice to tap a bit even when not oom because of threat. This will always differ of course from boss to boss and depending on gear, tanks, buffs etc. If you have a corruption running you'll have to refresh it on the boss and any adds. 
---
Most likely you will outthreat the tank eventually and even with lifetapping you'll be standing around for a while. This also one of the reasons why I sometimes throw dots to the lesser geared locks if the BiS locks are threat capped. This is less of an issue in more hardcore guilds with proper dual-wield fury tanks of course.
---
When the boss is about to die you can use shadowburn to finish him off.
---
You and I had very different vanilla experiences
---
Kinda sucks to be the noob benchmark though
---
I burst into laughter and scared my fiance. Excellent post
---
Honestly, with Discord and world chat, the amount of time you actually spend in cities is so inconsequential, it doesn't matter.
---
The number of instances where you'll be in Orgrimmar and think "Damn, I wish I was looking at Ironforge or Stormwind" will be nothing compared to the number of times you get a Battle.NET notification that you're friend is online and you have absolutely no way of interacting with them beyond text.
---
Let me explain my reasoning... at a certain point we farm the charms for my warrior quest, if we have left over / stay longer and don’t intend to flip the charms for a quick buck, then we have an extremely easy source of power leveling at a whopping 2/3 second kill time by use of charm. Not to mention, since the charms can only be used on one exile, if I farm in one spot for a while I can just go to the other exile and use all of the charms there with no extra work. 
---
It’s not a question of whether the charms or worth grinding JUST to get exp from using the charms. Outside of selling them to warriors on launch, the other use would be to use them for an alt and get some really fast exp.
---
Lol god damn
---
It's horde only.

[37 days /played to 60](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/btqa9x/37_days_played_to_60_pvp_leveling_guild_hooooo/), then WoW became more of a job than my real job...
---
I didn't give the 0.1% a mention beyond:
---
&gt; And then there are the people that plan on putting 100+ hours in on the first week.
---
Even though I believe I belong in that group. Mainly because they have little bearing to everyone else's experience.
---
Did you make any attempt to reason with him? Because you could’ve said something along the lines of “if I pull off you consistently I’ll swap to flame tongue” and when he saw it wasn’t a big deal it wouldn’t have been a big deal. Based off your responses to others it seems like you’re just looking for arguments though
---
Its just that i see if you get a zone like this ingame you'll have the best guilds basically buy people to protect them while they do attempts and no other guilds would ever really get a chance to do them, if there is a better way to counter that then yeah it should be done.  
---
And yeah i thought it might be cool to have debuff/buffs for killing some of the bosses something that debuffs the area making the zone somewhat harder to deal with for a couple of hours and a buff that helps with one of the other raids.  
---
damage dealt to dragonkin, damage dealt to undead.. etc.  
---
I think changing the way people interact with the environment would be best movement speed up/down would target melee classes, spell daze/speed effecting casters, limited view range good for rogues and ferals the 2 that roll that spec lol  
---
if the effect from killing the last boss was randomized it'd make the attack on the flag interesting some days bringing a mage would be a massive boon other times.. completely garbage keeping the pvp battle fairly interesting at least for a couple of hours.
---
I honestly just feel like the new Tauren model is so boxy. They are almost as wide as they are tall and that is something I just can't get over.
---
Is my understanding correct... everyone with an active sub will be able to play in this stress test? So like millions of subs?
---
I agree. But it's still not what OP claims of "if you kill a streamer, you are stream sniping".
---
The only people I remember pre stress test were... F+F, EQ guilds, and pro gamers. I can't remember if it had something similar to a /who count
---
I hear on the morrow it will be 69 days.  Giggidy.
---
Sure you have. And they always had loads of excuses as to why they never got shoulders.
---
Because I will be leveling alts with irl friends who have lives lol (no lifer here)
---
Not gunna wait around for their slow asses I'm boutta be 60 after the first weekend bois
---
I remember when battle er wasn't a thing yet and wow was running through its own website, there used to be picture uploads every day like a best of slideshow and most of the time those where of corpse art. You know like spelling stuff out with the corpses on the ground.
---
Shamans probably has more buttons, but they are mostly situational buttons.  Priests have more "heal spells" with 2+ downranks for each heal spell. Priests are very active in selecting all their different tools.
---
Time is money friend.
---
Well back in my day I had to walk through the snow, going uphill both ways.
---
Sorry, but in all seriousness. You're experiences don't necessarily translate to what it was like across all the PVP realms and the same will be said about Classic. I was ganked and corpse camped to the point that it was easier to just take a break, have some grub, come back later. Eventually when I hit 60, I'd only F up lowbies or 60's that were doing the same and really that's all you can expect from what things are going to be like. People are way more vindictive nowadays and their inability to deal with things from an online capacity are at an all time high. I very much expect a lot of ganking as 60's start adding up. Some will become gankers, some will become servers of justice. I remember a number of people from the opposing faction even helping at times if they saw me in trouble. I remembered there names and returned the favor if I ever saw them again. All we can do is play the way we'd like and not get caught up in how others do it. Eventually we come across like minded people and that other crap isnt even an afterthought.

Tauren are definitely not 10 foot wide in Retail.
---
Welcome to Toxic!
---
We are a North America based guild playing on Alliance. We will roll on a PVP server when they announced names.​
---
We are a semi-hardcore (we will lean more hardcore towards the start) U.S. raiding guild and have been playing together since April of 2015. We have raided mainly Vanilla content, but have delved into TBC and WOTLK as well. We run a 9 Hour raid week. Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Mondays are the focus of our main group. Before enough content is available, or enough alts to do more than one raid, raid times will be used for focus farming or remaining dungeon gearing. We look forward to having a stronger PVP presence in Classic compared to our Past. We look at skill, attitude, and gear/dedication to character in that order. We do not carry dead weight or people who clash with the guild.
---
While we take the game and the experience very seriously, we are realistic about our capabilities. The majority of us are in our late 20’s to early 30’s, maintain a full time job, and take care for our families. Wow has been a cornerstone in many of our lives for the past 14 years. While we are always pushing to do the new content, we do not leave our friends behind. The best part of wow that we all cling to over the many years we played is friendship and the relationships we make along the way. We are a gaming community with Wow being the focus of all of us!
---
Here at Toxic, we hope to bring a different type of guild from most. We want to be tight-knit, supportive of each other, not afraid to point our friends to become better; we encourage friendly competition; we look for members going out of their way to assist; we want to be that old school fun guild that doesn't feel like a job, but rather a community of friends who want to kick a little ass! I will put a lot of effort into bringing very popular posts and guides into a central location on our website ([http://toxicgaming.us/](http://toxicgaming.us/)) to allow for your focus to be on the game, rather than trying to research how to best play your class, or where to go to level a profession.
---
Our Leadership:
---
Our leadership has experience leading in all retail walks of life up: from Vanilla up to and including the Draenor expansion. The guild leaders, Pronator &amp; Michaelfox, have been around since the game was first released in 2004. They have experienced all end game raids during their prime.
---
Loot System:
---
Loot Council- The Loot Council will be made up of class leaders, and a random rotation of regular raid members. We will do a prioritized loot system where we are distributing the loot in the most fair way possible, based on BIS and class needs. We plan on putting a ton of effort into ensuring the right gear gets in the right players hands. We have always prided ourselves in being completely transparent with all decisions and encourage all to talk through all loot (outside of when we are raiding of course).
---
Main Raid Times:
---
We raid from 10 p.m. till 1 a.m. Eastern Standard Time (7 p.m. till 10 p.m. PST). Currently, the days we raid are Wednesday , Thursday , and Monday. Raiders are expected to be online an hour or so before raid for raid buffs and to pull on time.
---
We plan on going for every world boss that we can unless it is at an extremely unoptimal time.
---
We plan on doing a secondary raid group on weekends, strong alt characters or members who cannot make the primary raid time will make up the majority of this raid group. We will treat this raid just as serious as the primary raid.
---
Our Goals:
---
Our main goal for the Toxic guild is to progress as far as possible quickly (but enjoying the content as well) and also competing with other fellow guilds for progression.
---
Our Expectations:
---
We expect players to be the best they can be, always! This means you should know your class in and out (doing proper research from credible sources). You should have all the addons, macros, and keybindings your class needs in order to be the best. Don't be a clicker, no one likes a clicker.
---
What about PVP:
---
While &lt;Toxic&gt; is mainly focused on the PVE side of the game, PVP will also be organized and encouraged. There are quite a few BIS or easily obtainable PVP items for PVE raiding. We will be coordinating guild pre-made battlegrounds and other fun events!
---
Why Toxic?:
---
We are unlike any other guild. We take time to try to mold our entire team as a cohesive unit. We have done many super fun RP Events including Halloween in the Crypts of Karazhan, Christmas &amp; New Year's parties. We have celebrated unique birthdays as a guild and many other strange but incredible events. We are all in when we set our minds to something. Our player base in our 40 man bolstered an unprecedented 25+ of our team having a 90%+ lifetime attendance to raids (100+ raids). Don’t ask Why, ask Why not!!!\`
---
Our Current High Recruitment needs are:
---
Warlock, Resto Druid, Dwarf Holy Priest

People who play on Off hours/weekends, or dont always want to raid are more than welcome to join as well, we want to always have something going on. We will accept any role interested in our non primary raid times currently, as well as anyone who is just looking for a home for classic.

There were PLENTY OF private servers before them who were the catalyst. Nostalrius was simply the straw that broke the well-established camel's back.
---
The left one makes me uncomfortable.
---
you couldn't fly til 70, only druids got it at 68
---
That's interesting. On private servers it's still better to mash WSG/AB than AV and that's the old AV.
---
Really looking forward to the good times ahead!
---
Not much changes in spec viability. The only problem is having too many healers if they all go the optimal healer spec. Heavily minmaxed cat druids are easily the best of the hybrid DPS while resto druids are slightly worse than other healers so it makes sense to swap resto druids to cat druids if you have too many healers for the content. Also you will eventually need 8 tanks for four horsemen and gearing up feral druids builds towards that goal. 
---
Shadow spec priest dps is terrible so it's still optimal to bring 1 holy/shadow spec priest that just keeps shadow weaving up, along with the 4 power infusion spec disc/holy healers. 
---
Enh, ele, ret, prot, balance, and shadow specs all still wouldn't be wanted in the raid.
---
Looks like something I'd write when I've taken too many Adderall pills.
---
The interface folder looks straightforward enough. But the WTF folder is a bit complicated. Would you just need the Config.wtf file or to dive deeper and include bindings-cache.wtf and camera-settings.txt and etc?
---
Yeah, my owl died a bit. But did great damage. Its’ wings got in the way a lot, too, which was kinda annoying but otherwise it was a great bet.
---
Do you know anybody with a horde version of this?
---
He’s on a pvp server. It’s called playing on a pvp server. If he doesn’t like it, he needs to go to a pve server.
---
-Thats- being nitpicky. Go on to every other fantasy world's subreddit and scrutinize every little historical inaccuracy of their portrayal non-existent mythical creatures, see where that gets you. 
---
Also, Panda719 said: "...basically something like a minotaur"
---
"Something like", not "is a". Means there's creative freedom in their design.
---
I don't think Swify is that out of touch, I feel like he is jut teasing
---
Hey buddy, so I was thinking we should probably play on a pve server.  pm details 2 weeks before release.
---
doesnt neutral AH take 15%?
---
Either way - I'll take loss, since this was money I wasn't expecting :D
---
That is all the things that can make this the best game out there!
---
Curious. Is having 'class leaders' in a guild the standard in vanilla? If so, why?
---
I'll have a main to play solo, and an alt to play only whenever my more casual friends are on to keep it at the same level as them. Beyond that, I'll probably work on alts whenever my main is stuck waiting for raid schedules and there's nothing else to do for them.
---
The misc stuff can be done pretty fast but car maintence shouldnt really factor in that often unless you have a beater for a car but still. Laundry is done passively until you get to the folding part which takes like 15 minutes. That commute to work sucks if its that long. People would probably take 2 hours out of their sleep and sleep on 6. I cant remember the last time i slept 8 hrs.
---
Nah fam I AM ganking douche bag rogue 
---
I will never change
---
Shadowmeld + Charge is always a good time.
---
Shhhh, don't tell them our secrets!
---
Agreed NE is great.  I played NE priest to \~45 (very early post-launch) and having stealth was amazing utility in the middle of all the WPVP madness.
---
i mean with 70 days to go you aren't gonna level a bunch of classes from 1-60
---
classic wow are VERY simple, plenty of guides on each
---
for those actually confused on what class they like, insta-60 is a no brainer. set up your char and go wild on target dummies, dungeons and BGs. in a few hours you get a VERY good idea
---
Except not only is there no reason you wouldn't flip the charms at around level 40 when you need it unless it's an alt and you're absolutely loaded, but the drop rate isn't 100%, you don't have an infinite amount and you have to waste time travelling between the circles in order to use the charms which wastes time which effects exp/hour.
---
This is before we talk about how they're commonly farmed spots, and that even if you did have an infinite amount of charms it still wouldn't be OP compared to say a standard mage pulling a dense area every time it respawn.
---
Not nice
---
Please implore me how I can farm a hundred gold in two hours as a raid heal speced holy priest.
---
Ya I'd rather just sell those charms for an obscene profit because they're in high demand once all the Warrior alts start rolling in.
---
I think this might be a bad idea.  Everyone will roll an op warrior.  Warriors are like rabbits.  If you let them get established, then they'll become a plague.
---
Guess I’ll save my cheap shot for someone, gl with that rogue on ya
---
Aha but here is the thing. There's tons of data on various streamers history. Just watch Asmongold, Venruki, Sonidigital. There is more footage of Horde dominating Alliance. There's more data showing it.
---
Is the meta for priests really to go disc? I thought you just had one go down for DS, the rest go holy for better actual healing.
---
Yeah i always said this to my friends too about the gimmick thing. Each expansion they always excitedly announced its special features when they unveiled it. Garrisons, artifact power, heart of azerite, etc. etc.. 
---
Like how about just focus on making your dungeons, raids, and pvp really good, and you don't need these stupid gimmicks?
---
Please cite concrete data.
---
Picking your class on "I'm gonna fail and Night Elf makes my failure half as painful" is a piss poor way of deciding. And it's not "basically mount speed", it's 10% less than a regular mount and half as efficient as an epic mount.
---
For those classes that care, the Human Sword/Maces bonus is huge, not "tiny". It's worth +3% hit and +20% on all glancing blows (which are 40% of your attacks against a raid boss).
---
And for every single group experience in the game, your Wisp mode is absolutely pointless because you'll be waiting on everyone else.
---
Druid and Hunter are the ONLY two classes that should ever consider rolling Night Elf.
---
I buff people who can buff. Reciprocity is good etiquette.
---
Bruh that’s incest
---
ah okay. well i got a week or two before classic arrives i guess lol
---
I mean you don't really have to specify a reason at most places.
---
Yeah, you’re right, short term viability definitely isn’t a thing for this method. It’s not a “launch day” method or tactic. The whole premise of the question was that way down the road in between AQ and Naxx patches when servers are stable and everything is set, I’m asking if this is a legitimate strategy to level up an alt that is low effort
---
Does 42.0 days count???
---
Shadowmeld into mind control is something else.
---
A lot of people will roll a Warrior;
---
A lot of them will give up around level 30 or earlier.
---
Those who push to 60 then have to get gear, if they don't chose to tank then a few of those will give up.
---
In the end you'll have a normal number of Warriors after a few weeks.
---
I never did this in av, but I did do something similar often in ab. When I was grinding to rank 12 on my first toon I'd volunteer to guard stables or gm. I typically did this during the week and late in the evening. I cant recall all of what I read. I do remember reading the davinci code for a class report.
---
Yep, and that’s what I’m going to do on launch too. I’m asking for way down the road when servers are stable and it could potentially be a good method to level an alt.
---
Thanks for reminding me why I can't stand retail. The sense of adventure and immersion is completely gone. Sharding, ridiculous looking mounts, teleport everywhere, everyone running around looking like clowns. It's a parody at this point.
---
You have a great outlook. Hopefully there will be a lot of players with a similar attitude. It's not life and death, it's not a job, it's a game with other human beings, each of whom is different. Even those two dozen wipes can sometimes be memorable, and not in a bad way. Some of the best times I've had in games were when things hit the fan and my friends were yelling at each other in hysterics. There will be frustrating runs, but that's a normal part of any game, especially multiplayer.
---
Of course it's the three fucking days I'm on vacation....
---
Expecting reciprocity isn't though.
---
Power Infusion is amazing. There are very few occasions where "I just don't heal for enough" are the excuse versus "I ran out of mana" and more DPS prevents the latter.
---
I have two 120s, a 119, 116, 114, and 111. BFA is alright if you have a toon you know you want to play but since there's so little actual investment it's hard for me. i want to get pathfinder before Classic but I just can't get the reps or quests because i keep hopping when a class gets boring
---
Wisp form is looking more and more tasty for rolling a warrior as my first and only classic toon.
---
With all the resources available today compared to then, you wont feel to far behind that long. So much info out their and people have been theorycrafting vanilla for years. A bunch of good stuff here on reddit alone. It's def. worth a look imho.
---
They did though, in the character stat screen under spell there were 2 stats. Bonus healing and bonus Damage, an item that said +x to spell damage only effected the Bonus damage stat and an item that said +x to healing only effected the Bonus to healing stat. 
---
The Enchant Weapon Spell Power only gave 30 spell damage, it did not effect healing. This is why they also had the Enchant Weapon Healing Power which gave 55 healing to healing spells. 
---
In Wrath they were both changed to Spell Power and gave a strait spell power bonus.
---
The only thing that translated between both on the gear was the intellect. This was changed in BC to a degree then it was changed to just strait bonus spell power with translated between both stats in Wrath.
---
And here is some more info:
---
You can read the whole thing here:  [https://wow.gamepedia.com/Spell\_power](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Spell_power) 
---
Prior to [patch 3.0.2](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_3.0.2), the attribute known as **spell damage** would only increase the effects of damaging spells. Healing spells were only increased by the **healing** attribute. As of patch 3.0.2, **spell power** now affects both types of spells. Nevertheless, there are items which would increase your **bonus healing** independently of damage spells. Similarly, there are items which grant bonuses only to certain [magic schools](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Magic_schools_(WoW)) such as [fire](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Magic_schools_(WoW)#Fire) or [nature](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Magic_schools_(WoW)#Nature).
---
As of [patch 4.0.1](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_4.0.1) the ability to downrank has been removed. Spell power has also been removed from [*Wrath of the Lich King*](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Wrath_of_the_Lich_King) gear (except weapons and trinkets) and gems, but casters now gain 1 spell power per point of intellect. Spell power on gems was changed to Intellect; for example, +23 spell power became +20 Intellect.
---
I don't consider "compare WoW to any other game" a valid argument and I still disagree that the old models look more *like a Minotaur* than the new ones.
---
Yup. Flying was the first major misstep.
---
So good etiquette to you is take without giving? That seems wrong.
---
Jump runs, solo farming runs, etc.
---
It's less to do with how profitable they are and more to do with the source of the profit. It's the game giving you profit, not other players. Which means suddenly the amount of total gold in the economy skyrockets far beyond what the money sinks (repairs/respecs/mounts/reagents) can handle. The result, inflation.
---
You can still enable PvP on a PvE server. If someone attacks you they're flagged for 5 min.
---
Drinking every 2-3 mob pulls, or almost dying because of my stubbornness/thinking "I can kill this mob with 2 Frostbolts and some wands np"
---
Best way to pick who to gear is to run farm runs or help guildies gear run and see who volunteers, most the time the ones crying for gear never help with getting the guild on its feet and only care for themselves.
---
True. Still, it's gonna get wiped anyway so c'est la vie.
---
Agony?
---
You just summed up why I'll be rolling PvE this time around.
---
Be the change you want to be in this world.
---
Well, presuming its going to be the same layout as current retail wow, You'd want bindings-cache.wtf for bindings that you've adjusted yourself. 
---
config-cache.wtf I guess you could take but it's all stuff thats easily adjustable anyway in there.
---
macros-cache of course is your macros so take those if you want macros.
---
Under your account name in the SavedVariables folder is majority of the addon's data (It's where stuff like auction house pricing for auction addons, RP addons store character bio's, etc) in there.
---
I'm not 100% if the individual character data outside of the macros-cache will move over without a hitch.
---
I don't have a camera-settings.txt file (I guess i've never changed them) but I suppose you'd move that too.
---
What I'm not sure of is where graphical settings are saved. None of the files in WTF appear to be them (Maybe cache.md5? I don't have any program that can read it, but even then I don't think it would be) Perhaps someone smarter than me can tell us that.
---
Agreed
---
Ironforge is by far the most legit cap.
---
It won't be ready for release
---
&gt; that enjoys the nerd side of you as much as you do.
---
The Lok'tar is on the inside of the suit. He chickened out. It should be spikes everywhere. Horde pride is to be shown, not hidden.
---
No.
---
You said you only buff those who can buff. As in, 'you only give when you except to get something back', that's wrong.
---
I then said it's Ironic because I'm a Warrior with no buffs to give a random player but would love a buff when I walk by.
---
Doesn't create the environment of warfare between the factions that I and so many others enjoy.
---
These are good quality of life points.
---
Good. They can stay there. Classic will have enough players for years.
---
And I'm not even touching BFA. No way I'm spending 30-40 bucks on that dumpster fire. Heck, I'm not buying another new expansion unless they change things up completely or soft reboot the whole game.

 **&lt;Celestial Born&gt; \[NA - PvE Server - A\]** is a new two night raiding guild recruiting for WoW Classic.
---
If you are...
---
...looking to experience MC/Ony during Classic Phase 1 (no DM)
---
...T3 BiS minded
---
...seeking a work/play balance
---
...thinking organized vacation rotation is a wonderful idea
---
...and hoping to play with driven, mature, and friendly adults
---
then we may be the perfect fit for you.
---
As Celestial Born grows we find ourselves home to many outstanding players from Vanilla to Private Server to Retail. We’ve played many MMOs at all levels of dedication and leadership, and have fondly held onto our Vanilla member berries as some of our most treasured. To us a major component to having fun in an MMO is efficiency and proper organization. We seek to be driven but friendly and aim to take advantage of an early-recruitment cycle for Classic to bring like-minded players together who will establish a thriving, competitive, and healthy guild culture.
---
**Purpose:**
---
Celestial Born is being built on a foundation of striking a key balance between real life time constraints and completing the Vanilla raid experience. Our end game is to achieve guild-wide T3 BiS. In light of this, and out of respect for our playtime, we will run the guild in a serious and highly organized manner, but will also work to keep the fun and adventurous spirit of Vanilla in everything we do.
---
Our initial goal will be to experience MC/Ony in Phase 1 as originally intended. In order to achieve this we are requiring an average of 34 hours played per week for the first 8-10 weeks. Please refer to the Charter at[ celestialborn.com](http://www.celestialborn.com/) for the napkin math behind this. We won’t require this rate of play to be sustained beyond the leveling experience. Our goals are intensive, but we aren’t necessarily intense or strict in nature.
---
**Raid Schedule:**
---
Tuesdays: 6:00 –10:00 pm. PST
---
Wednesdays: 6:00 – 10:00 p.m. PST
---
We will eliminate Wednesdays as much as possible.
---
In accordance with our aim to establish a long-term work/play balance we will be implementing an optional rotating raid attendance schedule. With a little bit of planning and personal responsibility this system will allow all of us to take breaks without guilt, eliminate a standby bench, stave off burn out, and provide a degree of roster protection.
---
**Loot:**
---
Pre-designated loot council (details in website Charter)
---
**Recruitment:**
---
We are still recruiting for many positions. It should be noted that if you resonate with us but are unable to commit to our raid program we may be open to recruiting you as a non-core member. Such positions remain selective, are held to all of our member expectations, and aren’t necessarily precluded from raiding. If you are interested in becoming a part of what we’re building please refer to our website at[ celestialborn.com](http://www.celestialborn.com/) and read over the Charter. The Charter will answer many questions that are beyond the scope of this post as well as serve as the best means for you to assess whether we are a good match.
---
Thanks for reading. May you find your perfect guild!
---
Also add who helps, comes prepared, doesn’t complain about wipes, you’re right it’s crazy talk.
---
A friend of mine and his brother played a NE priest/Warrior combat in BGs.  They murdered a lot of people shadow melded at the BS.
---
That's the way I like it.
---
Haha not much better tbh :p why do people rock the full blacked out boxes? You know what my ui needs! Less vision! *adds more empty black boxes*
---
Are you an idiot? You can play a game counting the number of flips you can do IN A ROW. 
---
It's like you didn't even read what he wrote...
---
Feral druid looking to be maim tank.  lf guild horde or alliancethat's cool with this.  Ideally one with a rogue gm that wants thunderfury.  You get tf, I get to be mt.  win/win
---
\^ this dude HATED playing wow from the first moment he logged in...  like didn't enjoy leveling at all.  But he kept doing something he didn't like for entire DAYS of his life for whatever reason.  Then he got to 60 and joined a 40 man raiding guild and had a play schedule and suddenly WoW became fun.
---
/thathappened
---
Realistically, the skinner box is a helluva drug.
---
That happens naturally as any game or expansion progresses though. 
---
I completely agree though. I guess I just never paid attention to Dungeon farms and solo runs because I play a Prot Warrior and I can't solo anything outside some mob packs with good loot tables.
---
I think it's a funny joke Blizz made to make Warriors the "poor" class considering it has the most expensive repairs.
---
We can accept you in rogue channel.
---
A lot of Classic players, me included, aren't even going to buy BFA, as it's still 30-40 freaking bucks.
---
ur a redditor too btw
---
n ICE
---
Just go to south shore and flag yourself. It will escalate.
---
Most healing gear only had +heal. The BC style of stats where you would have 50 +damage and 80 +healing is only seen on (I think) two items in vanilla; Zandalarian Hero Charm and the priest Atiesh.
---
Most dps gear had both but consumables usually didn't. So flask of supreme power and arcane elixirs don't give +heal and neither does the weapon enchant.
---
&gt;You said you only buff those who can buff. As in, 'you only give when you except to get something back', that's wrong.
---
I can't find this anywhere in my post. So it's weird your attributing it to me.
---
This is good info thank you :)! I will be sure to mess around with these over the next two stress tests to try and get to the bottom of it all.
---
Death is not failure. It is part of the game.
---
I had a cat that I named owl. Best of both worlds
---
I leveled PvE once. Boring as fuck.  I loved the PvP especially in STV on a PvP server.
---
Huntard channel was just like Barrens chat.
---
I can use a program to swap the Human/Gnome/Dwarf models for Night Elf models and get all the flips I want.
---
Also make sure to give him credit at least.
---
Yeh but the reputation bonus trumps all /s
---
Having to run back in a raid or dungeon is definitely failure.
---
So im not sure where you got your information about honor in pvp but as a vanilla player who spent my downtime in duskwood forcing players to either log or have me follow them all day this was a regular thing not just from me. Majority of the contested zones could turn into all out war making it impossible for lower levels to make any progress while us higher levels fought over nothing for a hour or more.
---
Did you just level on a pve server and assume pvp servers werent like this?
---
Being an elitist is a good thing, considering elitism a negative glorifies being lazy and bad at the game.
---
A gentleman doesn’t gank during an escort. If that happens, rally the entire zone to camp that douche until he uninstalls.
---
LOL, gonna be lagged out, lines at login, then quest givers ganked sideways. You may not know what a quiet server, full server, ally or horde dominated server will be until a couple weeks later.
---
Gonna be a shitshow and a slog that we will all rush into and try to cheer.
---
&gt;Than what the fuck you call someone who puts as much effort into doing something as possible?
---
I would call that person a hardcore player.
---
Because a lot of people only tasted raids before the expansion late starters slow levelers Alt addicts. So now they want to achieve things they weren’t able to and have rewards shown for their time commitment.
---
High end hybrid druid is one of the most fun PvP movies to watch imo. A skilled druid uses so many abilities and movement. It's where I wish I could do more than seduce, trinket, soulfire people to death.
---
Yeah it's not something I really understand either. Buffs don't overlap, PW:S doesn't overlap and can't be chained, renew does overlap but I'm not sure if it does on this patch. I'll assume it does, but even then it can be purged. I suppose shadow word pain does overlap but, that's about it really.
---
It would make far more sense to me to to have four Paladins, or if he was willing to make the alt Horde, four Shamans. Shamans especially, grounding totems overlap, totem variation allows for a huge variety of buffs, chain heal cast four times at once simultaneously supports every member of the group without needing to get a specific target. Interrupting shocks, slowing shocks, dot shocks, totem burst, chain lightning burst. Etc etc.
---
Maybe I'm just missing something about Vanilla Priests.
---
I’m tempted to play in Spanish, to force myself to learn Spanish better.
---
Are you referring to the Manual Crowd Pummeler? If so, could you explain why that’s the best weapon for Ret? I’m excited to play ret and I’m trying to learn all I can.
---
Retail have been bleeding subs for years. It's probably never been in a worse spot than it is right now, it doesn't even need Classic to be affected.
---
I think I'm going to log in and mess with the UI stuff and check what addons they got crackalating.
---
I was only corpse camped 1 time on an alt.  After I was done with him, he quit the game.  I'd do the same to you.
---
Not on its own, they are still fun to have and on shorter fights they can do decent damage.
---
This site is a real banger! Everything I need in one place. Awesome job! 
---
The only constructive feed back I have is that if i choose an alliance race it shouldn't show horde only quest rewards as options. 
---
Even with that though, stellar job!
---
lol, extreme 40 hrs/wk...
---
R14 grinds are going to be like 120+ hrs/wk
---
Some people will play 130+ hrs/wk at launch until 60
---
There will be tens of thousands playing 70+ hrs/wk
---
I tend to agree, yes, you want to gear the players who are in it for the guild, not just themselves. They create the core of the guild, make it a welcoming place, and ensure that player retention is high and the community is succesful. Always prioritize community centered players over selfish ones.
---
Commenting so o can do this on open stress test. That ks
---
Good luck work hard play hard.
---
It was fun for a bit with friends until the gear treadmill kicked in and I realized gear resets happen every 4-5 months
---
What day was that???
---
Teldrassil also low key super amazing for leveling
---
I'll be sticking to my Nelf Rogue all the way through!
---
I'm 100% with you. I do this in retail now. which mostly results in "I didnt need your fucking help!" 
---
Don't be a part of the problem.
---
Im not sure how this is supposed to read... did he quit because he killed you once? Are you quiting because i killed you?
---
I enjoyed leveling well enough the first time.
---
After a few dozen times, it's just the mechanic that gets me to the part I enjoy.
---
You're wrong though.
---
The very links you included even confirmed you're wrong.
---
Enchant Weapon Spell Power NOT giving +healing was actually a bug, and was fixed during vanilla.
---
Every other item that didn't affect a specific damage type gave +damage/healing and applied to both.
---
the ONLY change in TBC was adding a small amount of +damage to what was previous pure +healing gear. Gear that already had +damage/healing wasn't touched.
---
You mean shaman right?
---
How many times do you plan on running MC and whatever other instances to get all these drops compared to the number of times you've done Hogger or whatever other leveling quest or instance?
---
Funny how it's been just over a month since everyone resubscribed for a chance at beta. Now they gotta do it again for 2 days of beta. Then again two weeks before launch for name reservation. Lol
---
cringe
---
That doesn't sound likely. Forcing your raiders to waste a bunch of time getting buffs that half the raid loses on the first pull because your raid sucks will just make people leave. I've been in such guilds, they don't survive for long.
---
Part of me hopes they break dm.
---
2k is barely plausible for most toons (at least at 19) unless specifically gearing all and only hp.  You are thinking of more current stat rating/all boa gear for numbers like that.
---
Nowadays twinkling is getting to 10 in 45 minutes and leveling 10-20 only in bgs then mailing the boas back to another toon if someone really wanted to noob stomp
---
Noon tomorrow
---
Better off grinding all the skinnables if you kill elementals sell the charms for mount money. I don’t think the little time saved is worth it unless it’s to keep you alive.
---
One is designed around montiseing you and trying to keep you hooked with rewards for logging in every day. The other one is just there.
---
Retail is an abomination of modern GAAS tactics.
---
Hint: "honor" is an in-game stat.
---
When you bring it up as anything else, you look like a tool.
---
He copied and pasted this from the forums. He didn’t write it.
---
Wait, what? The relics of wakening quest is one of the worst. I suppose I could skip it but it's a decent chunk of exp (considering the extra quests in the same den)

Hi, /u/Randizzl
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c1x8vg/world_of_warcraft_reforged/). 
---
If you think old AV would stop people zerging and getting 10-12 min games you're sadly mistaken.
---
AV by its very design **actively encourages** you to ignore the other faction once reputation and honor is involved. The captains, leiutenants and towers (PvE) are what give bonus honor. Meaning if you want rewards, and a vast majority of players do, you go for the PvE targets and ignore everything else.
---
What's more, is there is zero downside to this. The ranking system has you competing against your own faction so how much the opposite faction gets done is irrelevant. The reputation system has you competing against yourself, so how much the opposite faction gets done is irrelevant.
---
What is broken about AV isn't the version you're running. It isn't that the game lengths aren't some magical completely subjective length. It's flawed by design. When you mix PvE and PvP, and you **only** reward the PvE parts, then the next step is to do the PvE parts as fast as possible.
---
As I said in my other comment, even though I consider myself in the 0.1%, I didn't consider them in my post because they'll be practically inconsequential to the rest of the playerbase.
---
Speaking of Gold and Goblins, I wonder if GreedyGoblin's [old gold-making guides](http://greedygoblin.blogspot.com/search/label/Gold) would still be viable?
---
&gt;I buff people who can buff
---
sorry but this does kind of give the appearance that you do buff only people that buff. Maybe not your intended message, but that is how it comes off.
---
Blizzard is banning ALL PROGRAMS. You either roll NE or NEVER REAKING FLIP.
---
I Twinked for the fun in collecting and figuering out all the BiS pieces, kinda lika a side "hobby" in game. So you could show off your "trophy". The pvp part isn't that interesting, but it can be fun to smash people with op gear.
---
Also having the entire raid be soulstoned before an encounter... 
---
What annoys me with world buffs is when you lose them. Especially if it's not your fault like Vael just deciding that you shouldn't have your buffs today. I've found players play much better with world buffs, not just better damage but also less mistakes and higher focus. But when they inevitably lose them... then they play like shit for the rest of the evening. 
---
Will be interesting to see how we will do with the huge cooldown. Basically the entire server has to agree when to pop the buffs. I prefer the private server way there.
---
why does your motivation go down without achievements?
---

So you’re saying OP has a chance ;)

NElf females are the top tier Ara Aras

You expect me to pay so I can play a game I bought 15 years ago for 2 days only? LOL
---
&gt;I buff people who can buff. Reciprocity is good 
---
etiquette.
---
Found it for you.
---
I actually wrote a much longer idea, but assumed a super compressed TLDR version simlpy to stimulate ideas, then perhaps pepper discussion further based on my more written out version would be a good approach.
---
After having not played either retail or warlocks for a long time, I loved the warlock green fire in BFA. The felfire bolts or whatever the hell it was called was beautiful.
---
We found the min/maxer guys 🤪
---
The sub numbers are probably worse than ever. But sure, keep playing BFA. Classic definitely don't need retail players to do good. The numbers will be there anyway, and they will be for years.
---
link to tweet?
---
You should add this quest item as bis for the hybrid classes before they have access to the relics for their ranged slots
---

---
Well it’s a stress test, not a full beta, so you don’t need to reach max level. You just need to log on during the “core” hours the determine and then you’ve done your part. Feel free to keep playing, but it doesn’t matter since it’ll be wiped. You’re helping test the layering/server integrity under a heavy load.
---
Whoa there, give mages some credit. Mana gems fall in there somewhere :p
---
Exactly. I think the point being made is that a LOT of 'non-gentlemen' are giving PVP a bad name.
---
*kills you with a dodge Nelf twink*
---
Heh, nothin personell
---
Although I'm not one of those players that say "the game starts at 60/max lvl", for me that's when it becomes a relatively new experience. 
---
I joined WoW late and only got to pug a few raids before the release of TBC. In TBC I had a fresh start, so I got to experience all raiding content before the next xpac and I thoroughly enjoined raiding. In vanilla my fondest memories are from doing dungeons but I have barely any of raiding. 
---
As much as I will be loving every second of leveling and dungeons on the way to 60, I'm mostly looking forward to the completely fresh experience of vanilla raids. Also as someone else already mentioned, leveling can be done solo but raiding cannot. If you haven't already done so on the way, then "no matter what" you're forced to forge new relationships in order to see content, so there's also that to look forward to when you hit 60.
---
Besides all of this, rolling a new faction will slow me down plenty. Even if I tried to power level to 60, the journey there will not be a blur of xp grinding.
---
Except Tmorph has been used for many expansions and nobody has been banned for using it.
---
no it is addicting best not to play tbh
---
Good thing I'm not talking specifically to WoW vs its contemporaries.
---
 I'm speaking to the idea of approaching any realm of modern fantasy and it's interpretations of mythical creatures, and the lack of value in an argument that (In it's wording) seems to demand accuracy to historical real-world mythology.
---
That, I expressed nothing to the argument of old vs new models and which one looks more minotaur like, though I see someone else has. 
---
As far as I see it, Both have a Minotaurs' likeness, but framed as if it were a species of it's own evolution, and not a man born from extreme greek bestiality.
---
I prefer the old model on the basis that it matches the general art style and fidelity of Vanilla WoW, and furthermore that the new face has a touch too cartoonish of a look for my tastes.
---
Gear. Your character isn't "complete" without all BiS.
---
Hmm:
---
* being able to flip  
---
* +3% hit, +20% damage on glancing blows, some extra crit and negative avoidance, and Fear Ward. 
---
Like I said, unless you're rolling Hunter, don't go NE.
---
&gt; Tiny bonus to 2 wep types
---
TIL 3% more hit on top of less glancing blow damage is "tiny".
---
Some people can't commit to treating WoW like a full time job, buddy.
---
I just remember the most fun I had was raiding ZG with my 20 closest friends. I'm 36 now, we all got jobs and kids and I'll never get that experience again but if I can casually level to 60 as a healer then maybe I could make my way back to ZG one more time and hopefully come away with a cool experience or two.
---
Only oceanic and US
---
I've always loved the "cartoonish" art of WoW and given the chance to edit the models to their new versions, I absolutely will.
---
its not 3%
---
Given that Night Elves are responsible for pretty much every terrible thing that has ever happened on Azeroth, I hope more "No Night Elves Allowed" guilds pop up on RP realms.

Live&amp;Ud strat, LBRS and BRD are my perfect 10s
---
He never said anything else and I didnt make a big deal out of it.
---
In my head, he may have thought it was an issue, saw it wasnt and didnt make a big deal out of it. So I didnt press the issue. If threat had become an issue I wouldve immediately swapped. 
---
Any argument Ive made with someone is a counter argument to their *assumption*
---
4 resto druids and 4 resto shaman? The fuck
---
To me it's not BFA itself, but the culmination of all the bullshit features over the years that've made me completely loose interest in retail. Even if they make another Legion-tier expansion I still have zero interest because it will still have all the stuff I loathe(like sharding, transmogs, dumb looking mounts, zero server communities).
---
The ending is my favorite.
---
Says hes open to suggestions and not to trolls. And just wants the idea to be picked up by someone and basically cant wait to take his toon into a zone like this.
---
The delusion lol
---
That's actually adorable man. I could easily imagine my son never coming close to level capping given two years with his computer time and total (and absolutely beautiful) lack of being efficient with the game.
---
Shhhhhhhh, stay away....
---
I never took screenshots, so I think that black box was in the middle of experimentation.  However, no UI obstructs above the lower portion of the screen, the portion that is largely irrelevant in raiding.  All of the pertinent information is centrally located, so anytime one glances at boss buffs, casting, target of target, it doesn't require the darting of the eyes to the top left of the screen to the bottom right of the screen, or all over the place with most UIs based in chaos.  Having 3/4ths of the screen clean to observe positioning and making callouts is simply good management of space.
---
Except it is, you go from 9% (8% + 1% gimmick) to 6%.
---
The question isn’t whether or not it’s viable, it’s whether using charms to kill elementals FOR XP is even possible. A lot of you have clarified that it’s already not wise to do so (at launch, which makes sense) but that isn’t the scope of the question
---
The biggest dissapoint to me for the diablo 3 release wasn't the stability, it was going beyond Act 1 and reaching Act 2 and realizing that the closed beta testing blizzard was doing was literally showcasing the only thing they mainly did work on.
---
(Act 2 - 4 was such a huge dissapointment to me that i never looked back at blizzard stuff till recently)
---
I've been on the fence about the idea of doing Nelf Priest vs a Dwarf Priest and I just started to think dwarf and you post this.
---
I’m a chick and I say totally wear them!
---
This needs more upvotes. Need to get this under best
---
It's okay - best thing about Classic is that you'll never have to worry about it going away in the next decade or so pending societal collapse.
---
Rice
---
Then more power to you on that. 
---
Part of me recognizes that even letting people access modern models in Classic will mess with the perception of the game by the masses as a whole, and potentially in a bad way.
---
Though despite that, If they choose to allow such a thing in the options menu, I can't say I'd raise a pitchfork in response. Vanilla will still be Vanilla 99%; with gameplay as a whole, intact, new models or not.
---
Less than that, gotta get that sub in for that name reservation. 55 days from now people will be subbing en masse
---
It’s literally the point of the game, lol. Raiding and pvping after.
---
Wait, what?! It's only been 10 days since someone said 80 days left until classic?! Omg, this is such a horrible countdown..
---
Goodbye
---
Yes but be careful, it's so addicting you could fuck up your life
---
Huh?
---
Imagine believing there is zero overlap between enjoying PvP and enjoying the literal purpose of an RPG, progressing your character.
---
Oh I’m sorry my answer wasn’t up to par. I’ll try better next tine.
---
I don’t know about Unbreakable, but this may not necessarily be true. The first waves of rank 14 players were not necessarily playing optimal specs. The first on my server (Draenor) was an enhance shaman who played 24 hours a day and rarely spoke to anyone, although it is likely account was being played by several players.
---
I requested my time off then realized Labor Day is that Monday. So with weekends I’m at 10 days off and I still get the paid holiday. Pretty sweet.
---
To me it's not BFA itself, but the culmination of all the bullshit features over the years that've made me completely lose interest in retail.
---
So it doesn't matter if 9.0 is another "Legion-tier" expansion or even better, I will still have zero interest in it because it will still have all the stuff I absolutely loathe about modern WoW(like sharding, transmogs, dumb looking mounts, zero server communities).
---
Without going into nightfall bitch viability as ally

Of course it can be tweaked slightly. Take a better player over a better comp always.
---
last night in a private server i was standing in tarren mill inn when a 60 rogue popped out of stealth and 1 shot the guy standing next to me.  I was able to run away to the flight master but i felt like a shell shocked tropper who just witnessed his buddy next to him get hit by a sniper
---
They really shit dicked you on this one. I would also take the training for the money/job. Maybe there will be an announcement for fresh server that later you can join.
---
Dps warriors respec prot, and just fury tank it later on.
---
Raiding is fun though. My first two times to 60 back on Nost was very fun, first time I ever got hooked on Vanilla or WoW at all really since I've always hated leveling. 
---
Nowadays though I've done it many times and I'm not particularly interested in it. I'm not extremely tempted at sweating in MC for 6 months again either but at least I can get all my items from there and never set foot inside again.
---
dont forget windfury gives massive attackpower during the extra attacks, close to 500 on wf-weapon, and 3xx on wf totem
---
Shit I forgot about that one. I was more thinking about the reduced competition. Yeah that quest was ass
---
Well the people that are asking about viability and top dps likely didn't play before so it's understandable. If I just play now and just went in without asking questions I may think, "I'm gonna go pally dps, or boomkin...yea f some ish up in raids!" They will be sorely disappointed. As for the journey that's also something newbies to vanilla may not fully grasp. The journey today can be solo'd EASILY till endgame then they can go to raid finder, search the endless available guilds get an invite. Maybe some of it is that? For the people that did experience it, I think that memory and those feels will come back fast and they'll get back into the grove. And lastly, I know a lot of people are doing the same Faction/Race/Class so they're ready to get back to their most recent memory of sick purple threadz.
---
Not millions anymore man, you gotta realize that.
---
It’s be a retarded waste of time to use a resource like charms to kill something when you can clear camps before the respawn timer. So if you are there alone farming at optimal level your not going to save time because your still limited by the respawn timer.
---
Uhm, ehm... Google on your own risk.
---
Hey now, I didn't make the rules of OP's post. Gotta leave room for the AFKers.
---
When you hit 60 you can start playing the game :)
---
I'd rather leave you ignorant.
---
That doesn't tag it until it does damage so all you do is soften someone else's target. If I cast agony, a hunter casts arcane shot right after me the hunter gets it.
---
Have a mage or hunter alt, or start a start live and reserve orbs
---
Do you have a link to the video?
---
What's the top addon
---
I'd rather just have the warriors tanking and let the other classes do dps. Much more stable raid that way.
---
I think resilience gear, dailies, flying, and a high level only continent as mistakes. With these three additions, the game completely changes from classic.
---
Why build a classic version of the game only to have it taken away from us two years down?
---
It will just make naxx harder for no reason.
---
Done. You’re a weirdo.
---
Wow Classic is gaming crack.  You'll have a good time as you learn the ropes.
---
&gt; In a solved game
---
I still hate that WoW Classic is a solved game. Re-release the raids and content all tuned the exact same as the original...but I really think they should do a couple tuning/balance passes on talents and class mechanics, even if for no reason other than so that we can re-experience the fun of discovering the meta as we go.
---
Dropping us into 1.12 from day 1 of launch isn't my idea of WoW Classic.
---
I remember picking my character in Nov 2004. Had been playing Blizzard games for years at that point, had a bunch of favorite WC3 Heroes and units that I was trying to feel out among the WoW races, classes and specs. With Blizzard's amazing track record for balancing WC3, you just assumed that any character you chose to play would end up being balanced, viable, and strong in some way.
---
It's shitty because as long as it's 1.12, we know exactly which of those choices are completely invalid in the endgame, and we also know there might never end up being an overhaul, talent rework, balancing patch, etc. Back in Vanilla every class and every spec was always potentially just one patch away from maybe becoming amazing. Most people didn't reroll because they just assumed their day would come and all their hard work would finally pay off.
---
That day did end up coming eventually, it was called 2.0 and that was some of the most enjoyable Naxx raiding we ever did in Vanilla.
---
My wife prefers the new models of all races. My daughter prefers the old (except for the lack of 🐼). I’m happy with either and just glad Classic is on the way.
---
How do you know they were the most you made from early investments though?
---
I mean sure you got let's sat an average of a 1000% return over four months. How do you know what return would have given you if say you got an epic or regular mount sooner? If you managed to level faster etc etc.
---
My issue here is less that classic and pservers will be identical and more that you can't know how much an investment has made if you don't know what you're comparing it to.
---
Night elf is the most noob race. It was everyone’s first char when they were like 12 but then we all grew up .
---
If you’re really going nelf you probably didn’t play before wrath

Right, it might not be a good idea now that many of you tell me so. But again, my question is does using charms even grant xp in the beta. I only have information from playing a private server, and all conversations about how bad the method is are null and void if using charms on elementals doesn’t grant exp.
---
how do you deal with a loot thats good for mulitple classes
---
I couldn't resist haha.
---
Always wanted to find enough people to make a NE Ashenvale Shadowmeld Gank Squad. Make them level 29 or something. Low enough for it to be fun, you know? Set ambushes on roads and Horde Quest spots.

I don’t know what you are talking about. In my day Red=Dead. If I saw a lowbie fighting something it just meant that I was gonna try and let the mob get the last hit so he took durability loss.

You’re fishing? Well now you’re dead. I’m mounted and headed off before you even see the tail of my frostsaber.

Don’t want PvP, PvE servers are ———&gt;

Does anyone else find these posts ridiculous? You're trying to tell people to be nice. 
---
It reminds me of those people who over explain how to play Cards Against Humanity. "If you see 'Big Black Dildo,' it instantly wins. Everyone has to pick that cause it's funny!"
---
Don’t know why people think that’s made up. But apparently dude just constantly griefed people doing escort quests and such. His name was Lukage on Thunderlord. But I guess making stories up makes more sense.
---
MXC on Spike.  I still watch it to this day.
---
if its someone in group then food/water should be automatic, if its a rando in org ya youll get water if i feel like it
---
Small note, the world record level 60 is four days 20 hours. No way anyone is hitting 60 in 100 hours. Before anyone says the record has been beaten on pservers, the levelling xp is off, quests give more xp on pservers.
---
Interesting! I put all of those as 5s or 6s...BRD is an epic dungeon with so much depth but it also is overly complex and the theme is boring/monotonous (~20 bosses of dark iron dwarves and lava!), LBRS has a lot of nuance but unfortunately most people only run it once or twice for quests, and Strat is just a very dense instance, there’s not necessarily more trash than other dungeons but it’s all clumped together so it feels like a slog to me because killing one trash pack barely moves you anywhere. 
---
My favorites are Scholo, SFK, SM Lib, ZF and Maraudon.
---
i didnt know who these guys were 4 days ago now i strive to be one of them.
---
be a girl
---
Yeah, I placed a moratorium on new clients starting in July. There are very few, if any, people in my world that understand, especially my girlfriend. I've convinced her that streaming is my new career...
---
GUY LEDOUCHE!
---
Got real sweaty in here all of a sudden.
---
Idk I've been just questing and doing dungeons and I'm at 49 with under 7 days played
---
I know figures are slightly off on PServers, but still, I think most people are more efficient nowadays than in classic where the server firsts were sometimes 10 days +
---
There will be hunters and mages that do 1-60 in under 4 days /played when classic drops, bet.
---
This is the stupidest thing I’ve read all day.
---
As a primarily horde player that would be pretty awesome.  People would have to call for help or find creative ways to avoid being killed by the ASGS when they were operating.  Player created content is always the most fun.
---
&gt;I then said it's Ironic because I'm a Warrior with no buffs to give a random player but would love a buff when I walk by.
---
then you get to 60 and reserve everything of value in dungeons.
---
Right you are, Ken.
---
Why is this /s? If you're going for rep for mounts and whatever, it actually does save you a bunch of time.
---
It’s fine to prepare. But if you’re like me I wrote everything on a piece of paper, shouldn’t take long and I plan to edit my settings when I’m autorunning to Brill
---
You are totally fine. Just keep in mind that Alliance druid tanking is easier than on horde side. 
---
In vanilla I PVPed (healed and flag ran), healed BWL/AQ, and tanked Rag all with a feral/resto spec and I never had to respec.
---
Quite wrong. There ARE several problems with Pservers, but they're avoidable. Quest XP is definitely not one of them. Even Joana himself thinks the record for Classic will be under 100 hours.
---
Just try it and see for yourself.  Others shouldn't tell you what you should and shouldn't be playing.
---
So you're classification of an extreme player is literally the world record holder?
---
uhhhhhhhhh...................
---
Strap in, this guy is just starting up again for the day. Check his post history.
---
Also a good way of making some gold as all the super grindr mages will throw gold in your face for a PI.
---
what is cloak
---
&gt; winning competitive games is the best feeling.
---
I want to believe this. But the cries from the twinks whenever they shut twink queues off from exp on queues tells me this is a lie. Whenever twinks get queued vs full teams of other twinks they stop queuing altogether.
---
As soon as the playing field is competitive they lose interest.
---
There'll be others. It's fine in even small group.
---
Unlikely on the 4 day mark and if it happens it will only be a few players. 
---
10-12 days is the average private servers.  You're always assuming that someone knows how to minmax leveling or wants to minmax leveling.  Personally, I'm pretty good minmaxer and I don't do it much with leveling.  Just not as fun seeing where the adventure leads.
---
Let me give you a little secret.  If you want to make money in classic, prepare for a LOT of time spent mining and farming herbs.
---
I honestly can't understand what you're trying to say. 
---
And no, they won't be identical, a lot of Pserver boss mechanics don't work correctly, or at all. Resistances are nearly non existent. It will be a different Meta in Classic, probably not that different but it won't be the same as Pservers.
---
/thread
---
everyone knows thunderfury is bis for mages
---
Sounds like retail with any class. Yes it doesnt take that long to get everyone to  dungeon but there will always be those who dont even make an effort to travel to the dungeon. 
---
Ive been in so many runs where I am the last one invited to the dungeon group, am the first one to get to the stone, and then realised I forgot to change a talent or flasks and make it back to the stone before anyone else gets there.
---
PvP can 100% be used for griefing and harassment. If you don't like a particular player you can make his life absolutely miserable for days. I'm sure there's people who find that fun, but definitely not all of them. A lot of people sign up for PvP servers for casual world PvP every now and then. Not all day every day.
---
There were was just some random blind luck to it too. I was a teen at the time and a couple of my friends got in.
---
Nice.  .
---
.
---
yeah, no thanks. its going to be aids especially if its just one server with a ton of layers. server crashes and all. it'll probably be only playable for 40~ hours out of the 72 hours.
---
Other than that one series of quests, its a pretty nice zone. I can't wait to see what its like on the stress test in 2 days. The spider cave in the starting zone will likely be a big congestion area as well and get extremely over clogged because it requires actual loot items off the mobs instead of just kills. This means every single person needs to kill AT LEAST 10 of those spiders, probably a bit more than that. That is a pretty big deal as most other zones just require you to kill the mobs in the starting cave.
---
Let me put it a different way.
---
If you spend 100g at level 40 buying items that you know will give you profit in four months.
---
How do you know that same 100g would not have given you more profit over four months if you spent it on a mount for example?
---
You don't know how much an investment has made you unless you know what you're comparing that investment to.
---
&gt; Either that or give it to the hunter as an "accident" then say you will contact a gm to fix.
---
This will not work. GMs are not dealing with loot in Classic. Raids will have loot trading for these types of situations.
---
&gt;r item that didn't affect a specific damage type gave
---
The links I provided show that I am correct.
---
... you're the kind of person that only reads things and picks out what you want I assume. 
---
Here let me fix this for you I split it up and made it bold for you to read it better.
---
 Prior to [patch 3.0.2](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_3.0.2), **the attribute known as spell damage would only increase the effects of damaging spells**.       
---
* **Healing spells were only increased by the healing attribute**
---
In BC gear was changed to say  "increased spell damage and healing" This was also shown on Mage and Warlock gear even though they do not heal.
---
The Spell Power enchant for weapons was changed in BC to say spell power and healing not Vanilla. I know, I have the enchant on my main from back then and sold the enchant to twinks regularly. Prior to BC it said Spell Damage( Damaging spells only ) It was not a bug it was intended. 
---
Then when Wrath came out All stats that effected healing or damage was changed to spell power. The healing enchant was then changed to 30 Spell power ( Still kept the name Weapon Major Healing) , the Spell power enchant was changed to 30 Spell power as well rather than say damage and healing in the tool tip.
---
Vanilla only had +Spell Damage / as well as the +Spell damage for specific schools of magic IE: Frost, Fire Arcane  or +Healing
---
Last time I caught it was walking through costco had no idea it was still on Tv!
---
&gt; I'm pretty sure other version control program existed before.
---
Why must you tell such lies. Clearcase was just a bad dream, it never really existed.
---
Excuse me, I need to go eat a bucket of antidepressant ice cream now.
---
but humour is funny
---
Let's get that on the tray?
---
There's no such thing as a perfect 10.  
---
https://invidio.us/watch?v=pInk1rV2VEg
---
And yet farming happens plenty on those private servers too. The most popular farming spots are usually always contested. What happens if the opposite faction is farming in the same spot and he's better than you, or playing a class that counters yours? Too bad, you can't farm there.
---
Why harder? There's plenty enough of dps and I've wiped more times because the fury tanks can't be healed or fury dps don't tank when a real tank dies and the mob runs through the raid than not enough dps. In fact I can probably count on my fingers the times I've wiped because we didn't have enough dps and they were all on Sapphiron.
---
Professional speed levelers are all fairly certain the 4 day mark will be broken by no-sleep questing hunters or  no sleep aoe farming  mages.
---
No offense, but I trust  their collective opinions a bit more than ppl on Reddit's. 
---
people like Joana have put tens of thousands of hours into research and route development, they know what they're talking about.
---
Now , I agree it will be very few people, no more than 10 imo. But still, the average will be far lower than it was in vanilla . Even if that's from 12-15 down to 10-12 days played, that's huge amounts of time shaved . Not to mention every single p server player who has access to beta has claimed classic is easier, elites , dungeon bosses etc.
---
69 =100
---
it only takes a few hours to get to level 10.
---
That's what be what you would say if you were bound by an NDA, wouldn't it???
---
3% hit?
---
*laughs in gnome warlock*
---
After selecting the pre-set gear, it would be cool if you could make your own changes from there and swap selected pieces out.
---
Lots of pop-punk: a day to remember, senses fail, the used, MCR, underoath and others like that.
---
They're horde scum is what they are

Can't you just trade for 2h after the raid?

And I think I also read that GMs won't move raid stuff for that very reason.
---
Well, music actually - I listened to a lot of bjork while leveling, and a few songs still take me back.
---
Not only did you quote it wrong but you are trying to trash talk a literal wow legend. Don't think you will get people to turn on swifty.
---
Tanks could hand out a good amount of DPS once getting geared.
---
I wouldn’t be anywhere tops the leaderboard, but I’d definitely be the pace car to see who was AFK or not paying attention in raids. I still made some people sweat who were fairly undergeared.
---
Just going to say, this is probably going to be your best chance to test your leveling runs in an environment similar to launch day.
---
You can practice leveling 1-15 in beta, but you cant fill the starter areas with tons of people like there will be on this stress test now that EVERYONE is allowed to test. So if you want to test your route, test and see whats most effective, and plan to get ahead of the bottleneck, I would take some time off work on the 19th and be there for this as soon as it launches.
---
The future stress tests will likely allow you to keep your level 15's so the starter areas may never be this packed again...
---
Contv on twitch streams it mondays or tuesday too!
---
Then it’ll be MC then BWL.  I didn’t enjoy AQ very much tbh.
---
Titan panel I think it's called
---
  Otherwise all gear show "increases your spell damage and healing by xx" 
---
This was done in BC, Vanilla only had Spell Damage or Healing on gear not both, except for the ZG trinket and the Atiesh staff.
---
The enchants also only said + Spell damage or +Healing, not both. 
---
In fact the character stats screen has a bonus spell damage and healing section that reflected this.

**&lt;Premonition&gt;**
---
Oceanic | Alliance | PvE
---
**Premonition** is a guild where you can hang out and chat, join guild-led instance runs, quest together, and give and receive help with classes and game mechanics.
---
At end game, we will be raiding and doing casual PvP. 
---
**Are you a progression guild?**
---
This is intended to be a guild for people who work full-time and have families but still want to enjoy playing Classic with others. We are going to take our time to level to 60, but there is an expectation to gear up and delve into raiding (and a bit of level 60 PvP).
---
**What are the requirements?**
---
The guild has a few rules:
---
* Be open and willing to accept all different kinds of players, with different levels of experience, a different approach to how they play and different real-life commitments
---
* Have a good attitude to the game in general and towards your guildmates, regardless of how they choose to play
---
* Be willing to help others where needed, albeit dungeon runs, supporting alts or helping people with group quests
---
* Be willing, as you approach level 60, to work towards pre-raid gear
---
* Be free for three hours, two nights a week for dedicated raiding progression
---
* Be communicative: let the guild leader or other guild officers know if you need to take a break or can’t attend a raid or event.
---
This is about community and helping each other enjoy the game; but understanding that sometimes life itself prevents you from doing everything you may want to do.
---
**Is this guild only for Kiwis/Aussies?**
---
We plan to raid 9 p.m. to 12 a.m. NZST (New Zealand Standard Time), two nights a week—but anyone is welcome to join.
---
**Do I have to have played vanilla WoW?**
---
This guild is a place of acceptance, where anyone with the right attitude and willingness to learn and improve can find a home. I’m looking for people with dedication, who are willing to level to 60 and enjoy playing with like-minded people as part of a supportive community.
---
**What loot distribution system will you adopt?**
---
This hasn't been decided. Raiding is months away, and there will be plenty of time for some robust discussion around the pros and cons of different systems. 
---
**How do I apply?**
---
We have a guild Discord server (https://discord.gg/wc6Eye3) where you can put in an application. 
---
Peace.
---
yes, only Hero charm had both same with Atiesh.
---
For me, it was to see everything, not end game necessarily.
---

---
They could make Classic theme for the site.
---
If I see an enemy struggling, I'll be sure to throw an attack their way, yes. :)
---
Yea have battle shout. So don't be an ass, and throw an invite, pop a rage pot and buff that priest back, then promptly leave to not steal his experience
---
This is why I'm so tempted to be a healer, but I just don't know if I want the responsibility that comes with it.
---
PvP players don't give a shit. Happened so many times that a rogue was waiting in Moonbrook and every time someone came through with the Defias traitor he'd one shot it. Trying to even get that quest is an absolute shitshow as there's always 10 people waiting for him to spawn. Then on top of that you have the opposite faction making it even more agonizing.
---
"Rallying the entire zone" does nothing. Low levels in Westfall aren't gonna try their luck on a high level Horde, and max level players usually can't be bothered.
---
For me knowing more or less exactly what I'm up against, in terms of both raid fights 
---
and BiS, ahead of time motivates me to chase it.
---
Especially with the phasing schedial making it so I'm actually likely to get BiS while it's still more or less current.
---
Honestly doubt anyone has said that to you for buffing them or helping out.
---
People who camp lowbies are often extremely bad at the game. Today I was in southshore to get a cooking recipe on my holy priest and two shamans started killing lowbies. Naturally I shielded up and went to town. They didn't purge, they didn't use totems, no earth shock to interrupt my heals.. I'm not a great PvPer and definitely not as a priest and I managed to kill them 1v2. If you see someone killing lowbies just attack. Most likely you'll win.
---
This is my plan...
---
1.) instead of leveling another character, spend that time instead farming gold on the hunter
---
2.) host pug MC runs on the hunter and reserve the bindings, dont say for who.
---
3.) advertise to said pug that if a binding drops, a group wide /roll will occur and the highest roller will get a large sum of gold
---
4.) said large sum of gold will depend on how much gold you farmed instead of leveling another character, the larger the better
---
5.) if and when a binding drops, you give it to yourself and roll for the gold
---
6.) rinse and repeat for the other binding
---
ZUG ZUG
---
In my opinion that's kind of the point of PVP servers. An added level of difficulty, adversity, greater feeling of satisfaction when you reach 60. For the people that don't help, screw em, they'll be back to BfA in no time. It takes one move to flip a wpvp battle. Could be as simple as 1 heal on someone outnumbered, a fear etc.. There was drama and rage 15 years ago and that's due to the people that rage not understanding their environment. That environment is Player Versus Player and there are not official rules...This is World of WARcraft, not World of Teletubbies. I personally dont gank and I help when I see it's needed, unless their name is Neilyo and it's really him.

&lt; **Booty Bay Beach Boys** \&gt; **NA-PVP, Horde**
---
**About Us:** We are a group of friends that have been playing together off and on since wrath. We have a relaxed, social atmosphere that enjoys PvP and have dived into PvE content throughout the game’s lifespan. Without any public recruitment, we have acquired 10 members that I personally know. We are all located in The U.S. ranging from Hawaii to Florida, but mainly play around the Central/Mountain time zone. Most of us are in our early to mid-20’s, but definitely welcome all ages.
---
**What are we looking for?:** We are looking for all classes that are interested in a social guild that enjoys world pvp and casual raiding.
---
**Goals:** One big goal is to have a positive social environment in the guild. We want to have a fun and enjoyable atmosphere that all members can be apart of. Another goal is to create epic world pvp! Our group has enjoy pvp throughout every xpac and expect it in classic. Last but not least, we expect to progress through all the classic raid content. We do not expect to be world first, though we do want to experience all the PvE that classic has to offer.
---
**How to apply:** Contact me on discord @Hayden#1101
---
PS use dynamic node spawns and custom node spawns. So there will definitely be a difference. How different is anyone’s guess really. I’ve heard very conflicting info as to just how many lotus spawns were up in actual vanilla and how long their spawn timer is.
---
I’ve heard anywhere from 3-8 node spawns at a time on a timer of anywhere from 60 minutes to 12 hours. Who really knows what is right. I know I don’t I didn’t have an herbalist that high until BC.
---
Sooo if we DL the client for the stress test, it will be ready for launch? Other than updates, bug fixes etc...?
---
The models dont frustrate me as much as the new animations do for all the races. The new undead cast animation is sickening.
---
Tiny flaw in your plan: the tanks will  want  to  know who the bindings are reserved for, otherwise they aren't tanking shit.
---
There is a lot more than me talking about wow in my comment history, dumbass
---
Gear is so huge in vanilla. Go watch an old swifty video of him literally one shotting people in bgs because he had all bis hear.
---
Go to bed
---
I would tell that to people in eso. When monsters are preset easy af no reason to help.
---
Help me on classic tho and I’m thankful
---
good idea, but lacks the necessary villainy to become a server legend.
---
Just a few lol. There's deffinitly content to keep you preoccupied for awhile though.
---
Ok, backup plan in case this happens. Only join GDKP runs where the bindings are not reserved for anyone. Spend all that hard earned farming gold on the the bindings.
---
Not good
---
PvP doesn't, world PvP does.
---
In Vanilla wow I did herbalism on 2 different toons for almost a year before finding one.  And I made most of my gold selling herbs in Vanilla.  They were extremely rare or constantly farmed by teleporting farmers.
---
Honestly, you almost got me but then I remembered that there is no NE Mage :/
---
So you're implying  nobody is going to have over 100g  at level 40? 
---
Speak for yourself. 
---
Secondly of course you prioritize getting your mount, but you also buy cheap Twink items when you see it. It's extremely good return on investment, and if you're not a noob you can afford everything you need anyway. Also you're going to be farming preraid bis at 60, not gold. So that time you spent at level 30-50 searching for resellable items pays off not only in money, but in time as well.
---
Gay Bar - electric six 
---
mc raiders - myndflame
---
Aside from that one quest though, Teldrassil is awesome.
---
(I do agree that Relics is among the worst quests in all of Vanilla)
---
Ah that has nothing to do with what was attributed to me. Weird when people misquote to make a point.
---
This is exactly what layering and sharding are for. 
---
As fun as it is to quest with 100 dickheads in the barrens (its not). Its even better to actually complete quests and level
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BV-v9bdMQp0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BV-v9bdMQp0)
---
results are going to be useless due to it being split up over 3 separate polls.
---
Right? "Hey everone dying to play Classic, we can let you play the game, but only for three days. Then you go back in the box!"
---
The fuck is this.
---
I re read his comment a few times. Each time is funnier then the last lol.
---
I do only buff people that buff. I said that. It was the misquote of the things I didn't say I took issue with. If you come at me make it clean. Idk why people make fake quotes on the internet when a quick check proves I never said it.
---
&gt; So you're implying nobody is going to have over 100g at level 40? Speak for yourself.
---
No? I didn't imply anything.
---
&gt;Secondly of course you prioritize getting your mount, but you also buy cheap Twink items when you see it.
---
That's mutually exclusive, unless you mean you buy twink items only once you have enough for your mount.
---
&gt;Also you're going to be farming preraid bis at 60, not gold.
---
Those also overlap, a lot of preraid BiS can be bought with gold.
---
Not really, the spider cave in the starting zone is a HUGE fuck fest. Only starting zone cave that I can recall where you have to actually pick up items off the mobs instead of just kill them (aside from a boss where everyone gets the drop off the single mob). This means every single NE that starts there on launch will be required to kill a MINIMUM of 10 spiders. Thats HUGE
---
I love twinking for multiple reasons:
---
- you have another character who can level up two professions(at least one if you go enginerring). This is great as many recipes can often be buyed or farmed. Thats why i just will do 39,49,59 to have professions at 300.
---
- pvp at 60 requires a lot of time as you most of the times need to farm BIS, get into raid, attend all the time and get lucky and then compete with many others. The Rep Rewards or the R10 set is nice but cant compete with most Raidgear
---
- pvp at 60 gets quickly heavyly unbalanced. Even most hardcore PVPers say that after BWL it just gets worse
---
- 19,29 is probably really unbalanced but if you go for 39,49,59 most classes have their abilities and its kinda balanced
---
- its less of an time investment. In the time you level one guy to 60 you can have 3 characters at 39.
---
You can get banned for camping quest givers or flight masters for extended periods , I think that’s about it though.
---
3pm on a wed rip
---
Thats a good question. I'm not sure if we'll have to download another client.
---
Dont forget the violet tragan can't be picked up anymore if you deliver the quest in the chain. The tragan is useful to break sheeps/hunter traps etc.
---
&gt;How do you know that same 100g would not have given you more profit over four months if you spent it on a mount for example?
---
This is implying that you have chosen to invest 100g over having a mount, so yes you implied.
---
Very noice.
---
(borat voice)
---
It saves you 10% time, doesn't it?
---
they might still refuse the hunters bid
---
In Vanilla aswell ?
---
Chyea
---
Yeah, nothing like the guy who just has to be #1 DPS in a dungeon.  Tunneling so hard with the DPS that he's constantly pulling off the tank.  Everyone else just wanted a chill run with no deaths and all quests completed.  Jackass spamming DPSMate after every boss pull while never noticing that he's also #1 in damage taken and healing received.
---
It happened. Shaman was in trouble, I was on my druid, tossed him a heal popped bear to take aggro from a bunch of mobs. He kept running and whispered me that exact thing while I died. Other times it's not as harsh but def dicks about it. Believe what you want tho, I'm not going to lose sleep.
---
I did this! I won a duel against a 60 at around lvl 45, just because of fire gear :D
---
not if you are the one hosting the GDKP
---
Niceeeee
---
Dood. If you wanna continue to be "gay ass" roll alliance.
---
When I was little I played a night elf hunter and never made it out of Westfall. I had no idea how to lvl past 22 because duskwood was too scary so I just kept running deadlines for better gear.
---
No it's bloody not implying it's outright stating.
---
I **literally** said, and you even quoted it. How do you know **that same** 100g invested in a mount, vs invested in the items.
---
Lotuses on ND have a spawn rate of about 20-30 minutes per zone and sometimes all the way down to 9-12 minutes. And that's per zone, there are 4 zones that spawn lotuses and in vanilla each has a 1 hour respawn. So you can get 4 spawns per hour and on private servers you can potentially get something like 24 spawns an hour. So it's not 100x increase. Keep in mind also that private servers have a much much higher population and it has players from all time zones which means people are farming lotuses constantly. 
---
I'd like to know what lotuses and flasks went for during actual vanilla and compare it to private servers.
---
&gt;tfw you've been struggling to find a job for the past 12 months so you've been living off your unemployment insurance while the news of Classic hit and you were filled with you, but then you finally found a job with decent career prospects and the start date is one day before Classic release
---
;_;
---
Here's one: https://youtu.be/9cLdSjrnVis
---
I was really wrong about one thing, though--they're not making wands at lvl 5, they're making them at lvl 10.
---
The two are levelling together, but even so you should be able to get 58 linen cloth by level 10 without going out of your way in most of the starting zones.
---
It doesn't help you get the wand at lvl 5, though, sorry.
---
One, yes, 3% is a tiny DPS increase.
---
Two, every Rogue can(and should if they want to DPS) get a +5 weapon skill from the talent tree, so you're actually comparing 305 vs. 310 - which makes the difference significantly smaller than 300 vs. 305.
---
I have always wanted them to really crack down on addons much more than they do. I know its not a popular opinion and I accept that fact, lol
---
You need  TLDR. I can help you with it thought.
---
TLDR; downvote my post
---
that looks like an amazing tool but the verification code just doesn't arrive :(
---
maybe reddit kiss of death?
---
Fair enough, just giving my 2 cents as how it comes off when read which is how I think he took it. In no way meant it to offend.
---
Was (and still am) a huge space nerd so I watched a lot of Star Trek and Doctor Who. Friends told me that the leveling grind would be more bearable if I had a movie running while playing, but I would just end up watching the movie instead and stop playing. Needless to say I didn't get far in vanilla.
---
That's okay, being a casual player is perfectly fine, but I hate people that have no idea how to play the game and refuse to learn and call researching your class stupid elitist nonsense.
---
This applies a lot more to retail though I guess, the amount of clueless people is insane and when you call them out for not knowing they have an interrupt for example they call you a stupid elitist.
---
There is a 24/7 MXC stream here:  [http://www.taima.tv/r/mxc](http://www.taima.tv/r/mxc)

I like to watch it when falling asleep. :D
---
I'm not telling people to be nice. I'm just reminiscent of the etiquette I've experienced in Vanilla. I fully welcome players who don't want to not be nice and even gank and corpse camp. It's all the fun of a living world filled with unique players.
---
Yep.
---
If your weapon skill versus the mob's defense skill (5*level) is greater than 10, your first 1% +hit is ignored.
---
Combine that with the known +hit formulas, and +5 weapon skill is worth +3% hit, along with several other bonuses, the most important being +20% damage on all glancing blows.
---
sociopath
---
Feralas too
---
You can keybind the pet actions for Attack and Follow.  I bind mine to mouse scroll up for Attack, scroll down for Follow.  Does not get in the way of casting at all and provides amazing response time.
---
Why would a mage ever pay you for PI?
---
It didn't. I come on here to hear peoples opinions. Just sucks to be misquoted. I avoided saying the exact thing he accused me of saying.
---
I'm not really sure where the balance is, to be honest. But I think the last 10 years our access to information has massively increased and that maybe there needs to be some counterbalance to that in order to get as close to the authentic experience as possible? I don't know though maybe I'm just a closet RPer!
---
Given what happened to Teldrassil during BFA it makes me want to go back and level a NE through there even more.
---
Dude you said you buff who can buff. Then made a point about reciprocity.
---
How else is any rational person supposed to take that other than "I only buff people who can buff me back"
---
Try the coffee table after a good Pledge wipe.
---
They got Classic, they got our appreciation as well.

Funny when dense ppl try

There's nothing stopping you from refusing addons and guides in WoW Classic. If that's your experience, so be it.

You don't get to define what the experience should be for other people.

Sorry to burst your bubble mate.. but these screenshots were taken on E-lysium at server launch. My time to 60 was 7 days played. I grinded beast mobs from level 30 to 59. Im not claiming to be good at farming gold or grinding, im simply stating that there are people like me that have no issue with gold, and the extra gold they have can be put towards investments, IE. Twink items and things that i previously stated.

---
What did I misquote?
---
I said "As in". As in. " Another way of saying...."
---
You weren't misquoted. Go home
---
Except these things were never an issue in vanilla WoW.  
---
No one gives a shit about item levels in vanilla.  People were able to decide if you were well geared or not just by looking at your character.   
---
It's not quests that made you discover the world around you, it was the effort required to do even simple tasks like travel from one place to another.  
---
Minmaxing has existed for as long as WoW has existed.  Vanilla talents were the definition of cookie cutter builds.
---
Well you save about 9% of the time, but close enough.
---
&gt;*Item levels to get into groups or raids as opposed to getting to know the player and whether or not they were competent or a nice person to play with
---
It was never the former. As someone who plugged my way through to cata, you never just went by how nice someone sounded. Even without a gear score addons players are judged partially by their gear. I'm pretty sure your thinking of club penguin.
---
Someone needs to remake this but instead Of the streamer it’s a WoW character like thral or khadgar
---
Carries into raids as well.  If you're a good DPS, you're going to still do good DPS after waiting 3 seconds to start attacking on the pull.  When tanks get to ramp up their threat instead of chasing targets around the room, everyone benefits.
---
I believe it was implied that it is worth 1% hit, not 3% hit through an equation. The weapon skill mainly results in huge benefits to glancing blow.
---
It is also more valuable due to the fact that Classic has a parry modifier of ~14% compared to pservers which were using the same as Dodge ~5.8%.
---
I hear that. Actually happened to me the other day, damn infuriating!
---
But I still have my healing abilities even with feral talents? I might not top metters but it's not like I care. As I said it's for alt and I won't min-max it. I will have pure fun and raid with people who will want to raid with me.
---
I had a pink flamingo named Hyacinth.
---
There is nothing more satisfying to beat a guy with in world PVP than a pink flamingo!
---
Gold goblin? Thats redundant, like golden gold. We will see growth from day one thats obvious. protip: copper is king.
---
Thanks for this man. Just one question, why put BOE/craft into one category? :/ As a tailor, it would be really helpful to split them into two.
---
Are you my therapist?
---
All that and you don't even mention the tiger mount?
---
You got droves of jealous pink-skins making the reverse-wetlands run at level 1 just to get rep for that mount, you know!
---
They don't think it be like that, but sometimes, it do.
---
I feel like you're purposely not listening.
---
I at no point did I say or suggest you're not good at gold. At no point did I say or suggest you didn't have enough gold for a mount and extras at 40.
---
What I'm saying, should be really really clear but for some reason you keep missing it. How do you know what is a good investment if you do not know what you are comparing that investment to?
---
It's a really really simple question. I don't doubt that twink items make you money after four months. The question doesn't dispute that. It says **How do you know** that **that same money** could not have been used more effectively within that four months.
---
It's basic accounting. If you make an investment, your money is sitting doing nothing until its sold. Some investments have immediate returns, others have returns like you said of up to **four months** which is a long time.
---
You- "I only buff people that can buff"
---
I paraphrased with "You said you only buff those who can buff"
---
Then I said the words "As in" and gave an example of nother way to take what you just said.
---
I've not broken down my reply to you like a child because you said I misquoted you and "people makeup quotes on the internet" when in reality you said a pompous thing and I called you out for it while pleasently taking a jab at myself which seemed to entirely go over your head.
---
bruh just tell your boss that your unvaccinated baby brother has the measles and you gotta go to the phillipines for that all natural cure
---
No...I'm the kind of person that played throughout all of vanilla, on a hybrid and USED +damage/healing gear when I farmed, because I was resto and my raiding gear was pure healing, so I had a suit of +damage/healing from side-grades that I used while farming devilsaurs in 1.6.
---
Which is about 1 year and 4 months before TBC....just saying.
---
So they can top the meters of course. There are only a certain amount of PIs in a raid and always a fuckton of mages who are all swimming in gold.
---
Easy money.
---
The trash casuals here love their add-ons. Every other dope is going to download that abhorrent elvui shit and pretend they're a real method raider similar to the people who buy home gyms and never use them.
---
Yeah but rep in vanilla was such a massive chore that 10% is pretty significant.
---
It's like naming and shaming, but actually giving them a second chance!
---
Already upvoted it for that other guy.
---
#**Choir of Angels sings**
---
Quite simply put, if you don't invest any money, you wont make any money. Period. Be smart about it, although for some reason i think that will be hard for you to do. You seem very dense.
---
Fucking hell are you trolling?
---
I didn't say don't invest.
---
Same my parents. I am like, this is huge, I was never able to do it when I was young because when WoW released we had no internet and once we got decent internet connection, I received no allowance or whatever to pay monthly. All I could do is play on private servers. I still made good memories and had fun doing that. First time I played retail was in Cata before Pandaria.  Now I am working adult and nobody is going to stop me playing Classic WoW. It is huge for me as I always wanted to be part of this world but I couldn't due to life limitations. Being poor sucks.
---
Snutz said he knew who their mains were but he wasn't going to spoil their fun.
---
Would be the bigest waste off time and money
---
There are many ways to avoid a death with Shadowmeld as well. Super useful!
---
I think it's because a lot of people (myself included) never got to do the classic raids. The large majority of people had moved onto bc content by the time I got 60 so I can't wait to experience the actual raids rather than blowing through them solo on retail.
---
Yeah, and that's something different, people like /u/kdfailshotxo are just compensating for something, maybe he was bullied and this is the only way for him to feel superior, kinda sad really.
---
In Vanilla, there were 5 zones Black Lotus could spawn and it only ever had one node per zone with a ~2 hour respawn timer. That means, at best, the server is getting 2.5 Black Lotus per hour.
---
On many of the popular private servers, the 10+ spawn areas per zone were independent and had/have a ~45 minute spawn time. This means a server could see 60+ Black Lotus per hour.
---
No need to have the GM give it to your hunter you can just trade it to him via loot trading.
---
I mostly agree with your point. Everyone has the right to their own experience. But, if we allow things into the game that slowly degrade it to be like retail over time I think that's a bad thing. I really like the mechanism Runescape has for this, allowing the player base to vote. I guess you are of the view that add-ons did not contribute particularly to the change in WoW?
---
Is training 24/7 though? I start school the day after launch and I can definitely play a lot during launch.
---
There you go crying again, sad no one wants too play with you?
---
Why would a Mage pay money to top the meters?
---
Their on a scale of 1-10... why wouldn’t it. Lmfao
---
True, but when you're a DPS all you can do is leave the group.  Healers and tanks dictate the pace of the run.
---
Everyone will need help with it so just group with 2 other people and you'll be fine.

He we see the streamer in his natural habitat. Having proven to be below average in ability, he instinctively calls out against his natural enemy - the stream sniper. Of course, stream snipers are rarely to blame in such situations. Instead, streamers have developed a unique defense mechanism - denial.
---
&gt; Low enough for it to be fun,
---
Low enough to consistently win, I think you mean.
---
to each their own, i like teldrassil just fine but imo it's one of the worst for speed.
---
regardless i wouldn't recommend anyone roll their toon based on the starting zone, since it's such a tiny tiny % of the time you will spend
---
Best dungeon has to be BRD. Such a vast and epic dungeon that still holds value after level 60. 
---
The worst is Gnomeregan. I fucking hate that place.
---
Twitter announcement says 2pm PDT.
---
I'm trying to stay away till it's released, I don't want to waste money resubbing for beta to maybe not even get in, I think I'd rather wait and enjoy it in full when it's out
---
MDRuin spec makes Imp reduce threat by 20%
---
Same tbh, I'm 30 now working 65hrs a week but I once grinded Warlord and Naxx... what was the job promo?
---
&gt; If you see a player struggling, toss an attack or heal their way.  
---
Not when he is killing my quest mobs, then I am gonna watch him die if he overpulls. After all, he is my competition.
---
Its possible you are correct. However i remember reading that your explination only counts for Sir Zeliek, since hes an undead paladin. 
---
Lorewise it is known that all undead preists are shadow prisets. 
---
But - RP what you want. I dont part take.
---
"We're already in, and we're gonna keep clearing."
---
Here's a popular opinion for you,
---
LET PEOPLE PLAY THE GAME THE WAY THEY WANT, STOP TRYING TO IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS ON OTHERS.
---
This crap is just as bad as "huurrr Blizzard should impose a limit on peoples playtime"
---
that'd be hilarious as fuck
---
Make them work for those twitch primes i say
---
I see that as something to look forward to though, 4-5 months is a pretty long time to be fair, at least the gear is cool too, with bfa I didn't even know what my gear was it's just about chasing ilvl now
---
I think you might be right about the item levels.
---
The quests I disagree with, I think it was both, travel time and understanding the quests and therefore the story and world around you. 
---
You're right again about Minmaxing, I think I also forget how Reddit tends to be a place for players who like going quite deep into the game and likely isn't reflective of the entire playerbase.
---
pretty much every point of your post is horseshit. PVE and PVP pretty much entirely depends on who's playing , and what you want to play,
---
you just cannot say that you horde is bad @ pve   or alliance worse @ pvp !
---
it really depends on the players, i would say alliance is more beginner friendly though, coz to play a good shaman in a bg demands more of you than your average paladin.
---
wold pvp??? are you talking about solo pvp or what do you mean? you must mean solo pvp and then you forgot about elemental shaman...lol
---
BG PVP  warlock??? no shaman? what...
---
ppl spewing random advice is triggering...
---
You seem to have missed the point. The idea was to theorise for a raid with equal numbers of each class, not just a generally optimal raid composition.
---
What did 8.2 do to twinks?  And yeah, this is the first time I am hearing that people are against twinking for some reason...
---
Because they can I guess, and mages usually are very meter hungry people. It's just funny if a mage pays me 10g for a PI but doesn't get a single ignite off.
---
World Defense was nice.
---
But also low enough to let them think they have a chance.
---
Most of us who look back on vanilla mostly remember things from lvl cap because that's where we spent all the time and had fun with our guilds and made friends.
---
Beyond that, my guild never got past the 2nd fight in BWL and the first few in AQ/ZG, so now that I'm older and not shit at games I am pretty excited to actually progress.
---
That's not to say that everything else sucks though.  Its just that people mostly remember the majority of the time they spent at 60.
---
It just isn't viable for progression guilds sadly. Druids and hunters get the shaft.
---
Like a 5/10 dude on Tinder going incel.
---
A little later, but I ended up with Gorehowl from 10-man Karazhan because I was the only class present that could equip 2h axes.
---
I actually used the thing as a hunter.
---
I'm still embarrassed about it to this day and hope none of those people remember.
---
Who is to say you can't chill in IF as Horde? Get some raids goin' in there and use the distraction for Sightseeing, chilling and so on while a full scale bloodbath unfolds before your eyes. Best of both worlds.
---
damn bro, save some pussy for the rest of us.
---
Agree, players are definitely judged by their gear, but I personally would rather be judged by my gear rather than a number. I think add-ons lead to the latter. I always thought to sum an entire character up by a single number was a bit... sad?
---
«All».
---
Sure, you do you and have fun
---
I was just implying it, as you wrote it so it seemed that you were expecting dualspec like Retail and could Swap between dps and heal on the go
---
Cruel, I love it.
---
People always talk about having something else to watch/listen while leveling/playing. I just watch the game and listen to the in game music.
---
Am I the only weirdo who didn’t watch stuff or listen to music outside of the in game music?
---
Your website is suggesting gear  obtainable from Horde-only quests for my night elf.
---
Let's assume you have 300 weapon skill. This is the formula you use:
---
&gt; 6% + (Defense Skill - Weapon Skill - 10) * 0.4%
---
That equals an 8% chance to miss against a raid boss, but we've known this is incorrect. Now we know why. It's because if the difference between Defense Skill and Weapon Skill is more than 10, the mob ignores the first 1% to +hit, effectively making the "hit cap" 9%.
---
If you have 305 weapon skill, the formula you use is:
---
&gt; 5% + (Defense Skill - Weapon Skill) * 0.1%
---
Making your chance to miss a total of 6% against a raid boss.
---
That means if you have +5 weapon skill, you only need 6% +hit and if you don't, you need 9% +hit.
---
Mark a skull and spam Battle Shout.  Taunt anything that is beating on the healer.
---
US and Oceania*
---
Wait for vanilla then, there's loads off new people to excited for it. Bfa is uhm meh. Retail wow kinda in the same boring loop.
---
Not quite all... :(
---
He had the GM be the hunter to explain his shit DPS due to doing guild stuff.
---
Pretty sure that's wrong otherwise no resto sham or druid would take Lok'amir il Romatis but whatever, done arguing
---
Dejavu feel like I’ve been in this place before
---
Imo hybrids are classes that have the options for at least 3 roles, so priests and warriors don't count, as whilst they can bring out their main spec role and their other potential role at the same time with gear swaps or the like at reduced strength, i'd say thats only half hybrid, because hybrids need to be able to tick all the boxes a party would normally need to bring alone, so in that sense only druids are true hybrids, filling rdps, mdps, tank and healing roles, and pally/shamans being normal hybrids at 3/4 each, whereas priests warriors are only 2/4.
---
What will wow classic consist of? I’ve completed all of my deployments and now that I have time off, I’ve invested in one of those fandangled computers. I’ve been wanting to try my hand at some games. I’ve found steam, and age of empires.
---
&gt; LET PEOPLE PLAY THE GAME THE WAY THEY WANT, STOP TRYING TO IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS ON OTHERS.
---
Don't yuck someone else's yum.
---
&gt; it's going to be cross realm bgs 
---
Eugh really?
---
I would have rathered they just do a couple of big realms instead of tons of tiny ones.  I cant help but feel a lot of their tech improvements (x-bg, layering/phasing) are going to ruin a lot of the feel of vanilla.  I hope I'm wrong, but my experience with layering in retail has never been good because people can appear and disappear from your world.
---
Well, the fundamental debate around classic is how to preserve its integrity. I thought a discussion around add-ons had a place within that. I'm all for letting players do what they want, I just don't want that to lead to blizzard saying 'let's give the players what they want;. Because that is what led to a very different game with retail.
---
Not the dumbest thing I've heard but close
---
Better not skimp on leg day, gonna be a lot of carrying coming August!
---
Yea I know... thats why my plan is to focus playing mostly in first 2 phases, don't really care for it that much.   
---
Plus its all about the community, maybe we hit the server thats actually gonna be all about wpvp.   
---
Tryhards will always be tryhards but I have a feeling most of the playerbase just wants to relive the memories and have as much fun as possible so fingers crossed the player mentality will be a bit different.   
---
But yea, meta is meta unfortunately.   
---
Will be best to make a guild that will only focus on wpvp and capital raids :D I bet there are a lot of people like us who literally only want one thing xD and thats wpvp :D
---
Don't like addons don't use em, here problem solved
---
Gnomer and BFD are my 1s.
---
Al Swearengen said it best, "The world ends when you're dead. Until then, you got more punishment in store. Stand it like a man (or woman), and give some back"
---
The most memorable quest I've ever done was the [Test of Faith quest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mfse8eBKrs) in vanilla Thousand Needles.  Most quests were just "Go kill X" or "Go collect Y" but some felt truly unique and magical.    
---
The main difference is that a lot of quests in the expansions were forced on you in order to try and tell a story, whereas with classic WoW you had a lot more freedom to do as you please.
---
You shouldn't honor criminals and thieves. The guys who ran this server stole from blizzard and harmed their income, they should be despised not revered.
---
A decent mage can make ~75g per hour. That means your Mage is paying 12.5 minutes of farming for a 15 second buff. Yikes. At most I'd pay 31 silver.
---
I got beta from a warcrAft 3 tournament prize and I never even used it till late in the beta and I want to say at that point it was open. Can’t remember exactly but holy hell I remember the forums being pretty cancer about the beta.
---
Nah, it's all about the gnomes.
---
Want to know why?, Simple, they're small enough to fit behind some barrels next to the dormitory inside ships, below the stairs, preventing horde players from killing you during ship travel.
---
Well the only ones that matter...
---
I keed I keed.
---
Are you saying it would be funny if that happened, or are you saying it's funny when it happened to you?
---
Because I never ever got offered money for my PI.
---
And ignite tracks the first application so that mage just got unlucky probably?
---
addons aren't the problem friendo, i can kinda see where you're coming from with gearscore type stuff but the rest....
---
idk, optimal questing paths haev always been a thing, maybe not in addon-form in the early days but complete guides were definitely available (see joana's physical hard copy levelling guide)
---
i understand what you mean about the mass amoutn of content being pushed out at the moment, id suggest maybe consider it in a different light - some of that info being pushed out is either irrelevant to "Classic" (as in meant for vanilla pservers) or flat out wrong... there will still be the clueless masses regardless of how many addons etc are thrown at the game.
---
the sex noomber xD
---
Yes but he said to give bindings to a warrior and have a GM move them later. No need for that just give them to your warrior then trade them to the hunter immediately after. Not like anyone sees the trade happening in logs.
---
as a priest - this is my biggest struggle
---
I want that damn fear ward but shadowmeld is so fucking OP when used right too.
---
Very niceeee!
---
Are you Relik from Barrenschat tho? If so nvm if not? HMM
---
Not everyone does, don't be an ass.
---
Unpopular opinion: people should stop giving a shit about how others play the game and which add ons they use.
---
I suppose that's fair. 
---
My guild during Legion was casual but still serious about progression, which is what I'm hoping to find in Classic. We wiped a whole lot cause we had a raid core of maybe 8 and the rest had to be pugged. 
---
Good god, the amount of times I had to explain to people that they need to do interrupts when ours are on CD, I swear it was like teaching calculus to a brick wall...
---
10% of the world will have access to the stress test. Not exactly "all".
---
I was that shadowmelded hunter with the stealth cat and freezing trap set on the WSG flag.  No Regrets!
---
The question is, will it look like this cus of the damn layers?
---
You keep telling yourself that.
---
Definitely, agree with your point about freedom. It wasn't for me, but my brother spent weeks visiting all the secret areas like Old Ironforge.
---
I've never considered how the quests have changed across expansions. But I wouldn't be surprised if what you said is true. I wonder if fewer stories make the ones that are actually told better or if the writing just got worse.
---
Just like Leroy right? Nobody can get fame without a streamer... /s
---
Brd deffinitly is long, and complex. But I think that's what really makes it a dungeon. It also has so much lore involved and so many interesting fights. Everything is in this dungeon.
---
Brawl fights
---
Gauntlets
---
Lava
---
Fire boss
---
Mountain boss
---
Arena fight
---
Killing annoying dwarves 
---
And sitting in the throne for cool screen shots.

In ‘Merica  it’s all.

5% expressed as .05?
---
I'm getting 1.005 for this formula.
---
I can easily think of about a dozen instances in history where technical criminals and thieves did good things.
---
Cartoon Network's Adultswim and the SyFy channel had a lot good shows back in the day.
---
Damn bro, save some pussy for the rest of us.
---
&gt;I only buff people who can buff me back
---
This is the most negative interpretation of what I said. Its not particularly rational just very negative. Your making a weird assumption that I didn't use the words I meant to. I promise all the words i actually used are  there on purpose. To avoid people from jumping to the conclusion you fell into.
---
I think the new models are miles ahead of the old ones. The one thing I’m bummed about in classic is that they didn’t update the graphics.
---
Whats the debate? It was always possible to use /make addons for o
---
WoW. You want to restrict the new classic more than vanilla?
---
Can layerimg be abused to get more black loti? If it works with stv arena master it might work with black lotus.
---
This isn't even min/maxing, it's just common sense not to play that shit unless you're gonna go druid or hunter.
---
Please stay in retail.
---
&gt;pointless out of combat junk that only a FD/drinking hunter can enjoy? no. This is your afk skill.

Not playing a lot is okay, being bad at the game is also okay, refusing to get better is not.
---
Not sure where you're tripping up:
---
&gt; 6% + 5 * 0.4% = 8%
---
&gt; 5% + 10 * 0.1% = 6%
---
ah yes, Thottbot. the database that taught me that Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker disenchanted into fish.
---
Until now yeah
---
You're probably right about optimal questing. I guess it worries me what type of add-on could be created now after 10 years has gone by. What's to stop someone creating a dungeon finder addon?
---
My stress test client has updated multiple times with the updates to the beta. So it would probably be ready to roll come classic launch.
---
I literally sat in IF using my evocate on cooldown giving people stacks of Food and Water for raiding - between 60-80 of each..
---
Maybe some but not all.
---
Gronk would be proud!
---
Think the first ever 60 took 7 days after release so it might be possible
---
Maybe? If the context has changed? After 10 years has gone by I'm sure someone could create a dungeon finder add-on, should that be allowed? Should we have a gear score add on too? That didn't exist in vanilla but guaranteed someone could make that now.
---
Juat because they’re pumped for end game doesn’t mean they’re not pumped for the leveling process too. People like to talk about how hard they’re gonna go, it’s not a mystery - it’s just how people work. Are you not pumped to hit 60 and raid? Course you are, you’d be a madman not to be! You’d also be mad not to love every second of the way there. That’s wow, it’s all crack!
---
Yeah, fastest I think I can get it on my own will be lvl 8. I will have a friend helping so it might be faster.

As long as I've twinked I've seen (*a relatively small number of*) people vehemently hate twinks with passion that rivals the passion cutting edge progression raiders have. It's sort of insane to me that people can't accept being smurfed. I do understand some of the cry of "they turn away players!"... But if a player quits because they get stomped by a twink, oh boy wait until they realize balance is a myth. Let the crybabies quit and let's stop using coddling the noobs as an excuse.
---
Dunno entirely what he's referring to but I'm aware PTR added a *tinsy winsy* bit of text to the Experience Eliminated buff (given to twinks when they turn off xp) that reads "Experience gains from quests and kills vastly reduced. Someone in your party has chosen to no longer gain experience." Ergo if you're with a twink you gain whatever "vastly reduced experience" means. I believe this is primarily to combat 110 twinks selling Freehold boosting runs to powerlevel people.
---
Had a Warlock in raid who refused to summon, claimed he had no shards and when we offered (5-10 people at gate ready in AQ) to go farm some for the other few people who needed it while the rest made their way, the guy said no and went AFK.
---
I find that attitude just as obnoxious when everyone is trying to get a raid in one location. I would literally farm soul shards for him but I cant - so play your fucking class.
---
Nothing was implied. You effectively gain 1% hit from being at 305 skill *from the 1.12 line of code alone*. And then you also have stronger glancing blows and more hit.
---
The [data from the Beta](https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Attack-table#miss) proves that at the very least, weapon skill affects hit, and it seems to follow the formula I linked above.
---
Pservers are irrelevant to this discussion. The formulas they are using are 8.6% or 9%. This isn't comparing pservers vs beta, it's comparing a 2006 formula with the Beta.
---
Warriors
---
The shitty version of paladins but always praised for their "taunt" ability
---
1: did you even ever play vanilla cuz seems like you dont
---
2: you want to organize pvp but you can't even organise 10 sentences
---
3: only the win% is higher because off av in the est alli loses most off the time.
---
4: I hope you also know bg's won't be in the launch of vanilla servers and av will take even longer than ab/ws to get in the game
---
And hope you have a warlock in your group
---
Thats such a pve player thing to say
---
Not sure what you're looking for here. In Premade vs Not-Premade, the Premade always wins. In Premade vs Premade, Horde typically wins.
---
Gnomish cloaking device (usable by any engineer with enough skill) could be good for resetting raids after a wipe as a healer, or anyone with jumper cables. That's if it breaks combat  and clears threat.
---
In 40 man raiding classes stack and it's common to have a lot of the same classes. Most groups had 8 or so warriors. So it became easier for the guilds to manage and delegate responsibility, especially when players were constantly switching out because keeping a consistent 40-50 is difficult. So when new players joined it was the class leaders duty to answer questions and show them stuff they need to be doing if they are new to the encounter.
---
Plus it's easier to communicate assignments in a specific text chat channel.
---
Haha, that’s why I went to the dwarf place instead. Much better.
---
They're bad but for different reasons. Relics is a pain because of how tight the mobs are packed. The spiders are a pain because everyone is competing for them.
---
That’s pretty friggin stellar, xD.
---
Addons can help ruin the whole economy so it's not really the same
---
Based
---
Usually % expressed as a decimal in the math I do. 
---
I understand now.
---
So what if you are rocking maladath and as a rogue +5weapon skill in talents.
---
5+1*.1= 5.1
---
So anything over 5 on a 315 is just giving you .1 each.
---
So also just read that once you are at 308 is when glancing blow bonus kicks in.
---
I wonder how many goofballs blizzard conned into resubbing just so they could dip their toe into the beta?    That's $30 for nothing!  lol
---
Blizzard has become evil.
---
I dare you to try and shoot me! I'LL LITERALLY JUST DO A FLIP AND AVOD IT. 
---
Have you never played vanilla?!
---
As long as you don't fuck up world buffs should be a thing
---
I've never played vanilla/classic am playing on a private server rn
---
God damn, I rolled a Mage to practice for Classic - and I was around lvl 40 with a few portal runes in my bag and no gold to my name.. 
---
So many people ask for ports and I assumed they’d pay for the reagant. Nope - people just jump in and barely say thanks..
---
In Classic if people ask me for a port, they can pay the reagant cost up front.
---
nah other way around man im tellin ya.
---
WoW,  nice
---
Not everyone is wanting to rush to end game to farm raids, I know I'm not, EVEN THOUGH I do intend to get prepared for Naxx, but there's honestly no rush. I'll play an awful lot but I won't actually rush.
---
so mean, just trying to have a discussion.
---
uncivil.
---
Nice but its still so long:(
---
Right!
---
I'm a Senior Customer Care Advocate (FNL Adjuster in Insurance)  and I just got approved for the promotion to Executive Operations, which works under the Jr Executives in our building. I went from a glorified Call Center job to working with the team that pretty much executes the will of the executives and HR.
---
The API is different and allows different different things, blizzard said as much so no it's not the same
---
Classic wow will be perfectly playable as a noob to the game, so long as you realize its a long journey to get to the endgame and set your expectations properly.
---
Its an old game, but its still immensely fun and rewarding to play.
---
This is bollocks. Even Blizzard has acknowledged that that just isn't how game design works. It's like if level boosts were being retained in Classic WoW - just because one person chooses not to use the level boost themselves, that doesn't mean it won't impact their enjoyment or gameplay.
---
In any game, but *especially* in an MMO, the optimal strategy affects everyone, not just the people who use it. If you choose not to do something, other people will, and you need to compete (and cooperate) with those that do. You can't just make everything optional and say "now everyone gets what they want!"
---
Not great timing getting married before Classic comes out but congratulations I hope she lets you play sometimes.
---
Getting a Gary Glitter/Rolf Harris vibe from this.
---
I might be missing something, but based on the wiki link that you have there, 300 weapon skill has an 8% chance to miss and 305 has a 6% chance to miss. The formulas you use don’t match what are on that page. Unless there was a VERY recent edit or a mobile linking issue or something weird, I just don’t see your formula or get your numbers. 
---
Here’s what I’m seeing:
---
“If the difference between the mob's Defense Skill and your Weapon Skill is less than or equal to 10 then the formula for calculating your base miss rate against that mob is:
---
5% + (Defense Skill - Weapon Skill) * 0.1%
---
If dual-wielding, substitute 24% for 5% in this formula
---
If the difference between the mob's Defense Skill and your Weapon Skill is greater than 10, then the formula for calculating your base miss rate against that mob is:
---
6% + (Defense Skill - Weapon Skill - 10) * 0.4%”
---
*Disclaimer: I have no clue what the correct formula is. I’m just going off of the source you listed.
---
This is cool, time warping back to 2004
---
Saw this on barrenschat, glad you're getting recognition here! Awesome job man.
---
I still think people who were in the last test and are EU will still get in
---
Just go all out an ninja it. Your legend will carry on for years.
---
Jokes on you, I am your pet and i ain't tanking shit.
---
Usually the server recovers and you can spend the remaining time after the test playing the game
---
it's the result of people hearing certain word combinations in real life but never reading anything other than facebook posts.
---
Why do most streamers look like they need a bloody good wash....
---
What I wouldn’t give to be a NE with human racials, but the weapon skill bonus is going to be even more OP in classic than private servers
---
Wait what? They were getting paid in donations for years from players... not to mention blizzard flew them out free of charge to help them build classic and took away tons of goodies and respect from the devs. If that’s nothing now days then I’m confused.
---
The Glancing Blow bonus kicks in at anything above 300, but it does have a cap.
---
Realistically we're all gonna get NE mounts so rolling NE saves like 800g.
---
By far not AV is pretty much the only thing alliance can win most off the time (this has been since the start off the game)
---
Horde has always been generaly better (in pug and pre-made). Once again you talking like you know but you don't...
---
I don’t have to roll alliance to continue to be gay, but your homophobic comments automatically make you a douchebag. 🖕🏽
---
dude... pallys
---
It isn't. It's your decision to compare yourself to others. You can play the game without ever caring about another player beyond your other 39 raid members.
---
DM Lasher farm would work for that spec right? Not well versed in farming for classes other than hunter, but I've definitely seen priests holy nova spamming the DM lashers
---
I'm leaning more towards it this time around, honestly.
---
That only functions outdoors in beast form, if you co-op with a warrior while leveling a lot of the time will be spent in dungeons as healer
---
dwarf gets fear ward and desperate prayer. By far the best priest race
---
I got invited through a guild program Blizzard was running during the beta where they gave keys to already organized groups.
---
It's very hard to remember population density from so long ago, I just know there wasn't much trouble getting tags on mobs or doing quests at all. I recall getting to level 30-32 somewhere and people were pretty scattered around. 
---
It's guaranteed to be less people than what classic beta has today.
---
Dinged 60 on Nost plus had my 39 twink 90% done. Collapsed my own guild, which was doing pretty well. Alienated my friends. My own damn fault, I hope you see this ATCBAM'rs. I loved that guild and I loved you all.
---
Good. Its warcraft not tagging the mobs first craft. roll pve if you cant handle it.
---
Wow, thank you for that detailed response! Made me think about raid healing in a different light.
---
On retail, the best raiders are on PvP servers. I’m not psychic, but I’m going to assume that this will transfer over to classic.
---
You're posting the formula for white hits, I was posting the formula for yellow hits. I'm no melee expert (refer to my flair), but I know melees aren't going to aim for 24% hit. AFAIK they do want hit past the yellow hitcap as it still helps their white damage, but I don't know where they want to stop.
---
Missing a yellow hit (aka abilities) like Backstab or Sinister Strike is obviously going to hurt your DPS much more than missing a white swing.
---
And I fucking LOVED Nost.
---
Not homophobic. Just didnt realize you were serious about being "gay ass".
---
I thought I was playing along with a joke about rolling a female toon. Didnt realize "gay ass" was to be taken so literal.
---
Have a nice life gay ass.
---
I'm definitely not looking forward to those spiders, especially as a hunter. That quest is pretty much mandatory since all the moonwell quests are locked behind it.
---
If you view everyone on your faction (and likely around your level) as competition when questing, you’re kind of missing the point of an MMO. You won’t get very far at 60 without friends and allies, and it sounds like you have a sure-fire way to make sure people don’t like you in-game.
---
There is no source. 
---
It's an understanding from the community that how Blizzard made Classic feasible makes it a lot easier for them to add The Burning Crusade, Wrath of the Lich King servers etc in the future. 
---
They didn't just take a 1.12.1 engine, spend a lot of time getting it future proof and making it go live (which would most likely have required less work than what they're doing now. Still a ton of work, but not as much as this) 
---
They made a program to "translate" the 1.12.1 game into 7.3.5. Then they began reverse engineering 7.3.5 into 1.12.1, with number values and lightning and everything else. They streamlined it. 
---
End result is that Blizz knows perfectly well how to reverse engineer old x-packs into current content. At the cost of Classic taking so much longer. 
---
They talked about how they had to make Eyes of the Beast (Hunter Spell) a thing again which makes me think they probably had to re-design and add every spell from vanilla into classic. 
---
When instead they could have just taken the 1.12.1 code and ran bugfixing/exploit fixing it etc before having it go live. 
---
So if they decide to have TBC go live, it will probably be a flip of a switch and half a year of dev. I wouldn't be surprised to see an announcement at BlizzCon if Classic does really well.

Had to downvote it was at 7k got it back to 6.9k
---
There already was dungeon finder in vanilla, ive heard, just it was shit, so not many new about it or used it. 
---
Apparently it would group you up with other players, but you couldnt select roles or anything so you could end up with a group of 5 dps, or 3 heals and 2 tanks, that sort of thing.. again, from what ive heard, but apparently it was there.
---
Yeah I don’t plan on playing a pvp server again, and one of the biggest reasons is the devilsaur.
---
I had enough with that bullshit on private servers and the ‘devilsaur mafia’ where a top raiding guild on each faction cooperated to permanently camp them.
---
This is just f\*ed up.   
---
They can compensate us in the EU by releasing classic 24h earlier than in the US and the so called Oceania\*
---
Don’t wait 2 months to level past level 20 then.
---
So why repost it
---
mostly porn
---
Well tbh it is classic build onto a modern core of the game. The real vanilla cant be recreated so this is the best the community will get.  Dont want to use addons dont use them is the only option..

It is though.. hard times make hard men. That’s why people are so soft these days. You gotta get beat up a couple of times before you realize you can beat people up too. I’m not an old man, only 34, and I appreciate the bullshit I had to deal with to make me the scary man I’ve become. 
---
The world is not full of nice people. It’s full of assholes. You can be a nice person and beat up and asshole from time to time.
---
U gonna repeat this everyday for the upvotes?
---
It went from 6.9k upvotes to 7k right in front of my eyes.
---
By that reasoning, you should be in support of all features from Modern WoW being ported to Classic, so long as you can choose not to use them. Dungeon and Raid Finder, level boosts, heirlooms, Achievements, disabling XP in battlegrounds, flying, new races and classes, etc.
---
If you don't like them, just don't use them, and don't group with people who do.
---
Also, item levels dont mean shit in vanilla, ill be playing a warlock and 2 of my bis pre-raid pieces till bwl are from sunken temple, anyone that looks purely at item level for groups is dumb.
---
Interesting, I hated that aspect. I like my buffs sticking to people, not the ground. But the amount of utility is really tempting.
---
Didnt the poly heal take time to happen? I dont remember it being 100% instantly.

Yeh man 1 cd every 5minute that Only protects you (or enables you to stop a cc you shouldn't have taken in the first place) is really gonna make you win AV pre-made 😂😂😂. You just proving my point that you barely play this game but try to talk like you know...
---
Bro WoD was so bad. Servers were so fucked that gorgrond could even load the mob models. They were invisible. Only reason my group got through it was the party leader had the beta memorized lol
---
I started playing WoW around 10 years old! I’m 23 this year, the time has flown by.
---
I dont wanna register, why you doesnt use the local storage or an export/import function?
---
Also expected date for 8.2
---
honestly id take the promotion, even though you might miss the classic launch theres a good chance the servers will be on fire and you will barely be able to log in. and classic will be around forever, that promotion wont be, idk your living situation but 23k per year is a pretty good chunk of money imo.
---
Plus Pyro if you spec fire
---
If i see a warrior trying to fight a mob, and after 5 minutes he's finally gotten it to low health, im definitely going to sheep it.
---
we're talking overall win percentage here so of course I'm speaking in generalizations.  
---
Put togethter a "PVP CLASS TIER LIST
---
looks like this

everything else.

I'm going to play on a pve server with the other illiterate clickers.
---
That was fixed in Patch 1.8.
---
eciN
---
hunter is riddled with bugs that came with bfa client. for example FD+trap isnt working because the pet has some fucked up ai and keeps you in combat. this hasnt been fixed in bfa since launch, so for a year now.
---
other bugs like the pet gets stuck or lags behind. it's annoying.
---
i play hunter in bfa but not gonna play it in classic for sure
---
Still ways better than NE racials. Plus.. you have to deal with being a Night elf.
---
I understand people are going to no-life it but I fail to see how one can actually sustain that much playtime. 
---
At 130+ hours a week, you mayaswell be one of the NPC’s we fight in strat - cause your a zombie at that point.
---
Played a level 39 warrior for a very long time. Farmen endlessly for a Pendulum of Doom but never got it. I suck at pvp in general but the community was nice.
---
OP, This reminds me of a phrase my I use to hear from my grandparents (no offense intended to either side of this topic), "The kids these days just don't seem to understand how to have fun." You see, they had an idealistic memory of the world they grew up in and the things they enjoyed doing so much when they were kids. In their eyes these were the things they thought we were missing out on. Funny, the similarities. They had another phrase that would come in handy here as well... "To each his own."
---
This recently changed though.
---
lol
---
Feels amazing man
---
Almost every server that I’ve seen has alliance premades steam rolling horde premades. 
---
That being said - horde seems to shit on alliance in non premade settings.
---
So does that mean for yellow damage as a 6% hit cap or white as well bringing it down to 21% white hitcap
---
It was just an example. Like getting a haircut, doctors appointment, having a craftsman over to fix that counter on the heater or fixing something in the garden etc. There always is something waiting to be done.
---
My commute is actually rather nice, I go by bicycle the scenic route, hence longer commute but no time alloted for gym or jogging or something like that.
---
And yeah, the sleeping, it happens when you get older and depriving yourself only works for a while and isn't healthy at all. But I guess some people don't need that much or don't mind running around like zombies.

Yes, a elite. Killed me a ton.

People always got mad in private servers when you don't buff them but that shit costs almost half my mana bar. I'll buff you if you buff me but I wont enjoy doing it.
---
Very true
---
Thought it was 4 zones
---
Atiesh.
---
Considering every good guild needs 8-10 warriors I'm not too worried about there being too many as they are the most needed class.
---
Yes let's praise the criminals that stole Blizzards IP and profited from it!
---
I did mention... 
---
&gt; Meaning unless you have a friend giving you bags, you are going to be in big troubles.
---
That's a good point, he was pretty early in the rank 13 rotation, so his group(s) might have been happy with a consistent enhancement shaman.  
---
The dream lol
---
well fuck me for being a warrior then.

No. D3 is the single most  disappointing game of my entire gaming life. D2 LOD was better in every single facet outside of pixel count. Nothing can come anywhere near except maybe FFXIV 1.0.

Dire Maul also has a spawn.

meld is really good in pvp.
---
Raiding was amazing in vanilla. Get in vent with a bunch of bros and slay some dragons. That's 3 years of good times.
---
The bad ones often weed themselves out. Gotta remember though, it is the most numerous class in most raids. In Naxx you need 8 geared warriors.
---
For helping out? Happens all the time it in retail!
---
It usually sucks ass when people try to help out because of the mob HP scaling with tagging.

Both.

Couldn't find anything about it until I stumbled on [this](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/update-to-recent-suspensions/161149). I guess I was wrong. It looks like there's an alternative to tmorph, but it seems way shadier and riskier.
---
Dude, thats actual PvP though. Thats not someone coming into gank a low level area cause he has a small peepee, thats actual WoW wPvP.
---
Fighting over resources is the joy of wPvP. Its how a lot of it starts. If you don't like that, roll on a PvE server.
---
This. A 19 twinked Priest has more HP and armor than a regular warrior on the same level along with dots. Don't even get me started on that BFD Wand.
---
It wasn't instant, but it was quick enough to beat a full raid team.
---
Hopefully the reason the game is in beta right now is to fix shit like that.
---
But then you are still incorrect. If you look purely at win percentage you have the wrong statistics, bassicly gotta filter av out to get decent statistics. 
---
And yeh you didn't play wow vanilla by far if you think that's the "pvp class tier list"
---
1 there's no real tier list for vanilla cuz most classes have the potential to do insane bursts/one-shot + you got to consider 1va / small scale, /large scale.
---
You should rly just stop talking since you obviously have 0 knowledge off this game man. It seems like you just played a bit on a private server and thinks you know it all because your "knowledge" about the game is far off 😂
---
Yea sure, the private server players started it. Don't google the wall of no, you might damage your narrative.
---
Hey, I'm in basically the same boat (although 29) and am getting a group of old friends together for the launch. We're 100% more into just having fun downing 5-mans, running gank squads, or trying to set up PUGs for end game.  
---
We're probably gonna be running Horde if you're interested!
---
Hello brother from another mother, player from another layer!
---
It might be unpopular to say this, but I don't like them. Not because they gank people. It's a PvP server, rock on. And not because they gank streamers. I don't care who gets ganked, it's PvP and that's fine. But what I don't like this their motives. They [hate streamers](https://clips.twitch.tv/AthleticEnticingSkirretTakeNRG) and don't want them around. Yelling at people to "G O  R E T A I L" after they gank them. That's what I have an issue with. I don't like this kind of gatekeeping, exclusionary behaviour. I want everyone to play Classic, be they streamers or no. The more people play Classic, the better.
---
If something is literal, can it also be a pun?
---
Yep, I'm in favor of everything you listed.
---
You did a poor job of that. Consider editing your post to explain what you actually meant. Or you know just continue making numerous comments denying it without illuminatijg your actual point.
---
nah
---
Exactly. I think the best bet will be to camp a single spot and just spam tag the spiders as they spawn

Shadowmeld + Mind Control + Cliff/Lava/BoatLeaving is a better time

The API is currently as retail but I've read blizzard knows this and they will most likely change the api so the same limits as in vanilla
---
From what I understand this weeks stress test will be open and I’m currently out of town for work so it’ll give me something to do at the hotel
---
You're implying that literally stalking another player and breaking the game for them like this is common or even particularly feasible. No and no.
---
PvP, ganking, camping, etc are not griefing. I believe there is even an exception for PvP servers in the ToS for this.
---
i worked hard on that sentence.
---
That would only be true if dynamic respawns are as crazy as they are on pservers, and if Beta is anything to look at (or the past/upcoming Stress Tests), we aren't getting that.
---
Because of loot
---
I did NE on the last stress test and it was a blast. Pservers have the Relics of Awakening quest area's mobs seton turbo basically. Their heal hardly ever happens and the spawns are reasonable. Each box comes back in about 30seconds to 2 minutes. I'm 99% on rolling NE, but idk what class yet. (Did the above on a Druid around level 8-9)
---
The running animation of the new model is so damn awfull

If we're talking PVE, most of the extra talents you've chosen are useless.

It's ok, I gotchu Fam.

Chapelle show... Season 2 was early 2004. It was at the height of its popularity at the time WoW released.
---
What I hate the most about world PvP is that it's never a fair fight. You encounter an enemy player, they wave at you, "sup guy, i'm not gonna kill you". Then you start fighting a mob and they kill you from behind. It's just about who's the biggest coward.
---
Why? They seem pretty useful to me
---
Huh. Alright then.
---
I can understand you at least, I don't agree, but I can still respect any opinion which doesn't contradict itself.
---
Apologies for my mistaken assumptions.
---
How do you know it isn't?
---
Maybe, but you can go too far. PvP servers enable that behavior. I believe Blizzard has banned people in the past because they took it too far and made the game borderline unplayable for others.
---
Concur. They really need to take a step back with this layering.
---
Do you have to be subbed to play it?
---
Cruel and smart. If only have a few levels on them they are less likely to call in a level 60 unless they rage out and get their main. Which would be a win in my book. If there is help in the area they'll band together and come looking for you. And if they do manage to get a big enough hunting party together to overwhelm you? Good for them. That's also a win in my book.
---
If you just want dedicated Blizzard farming spec ok I guess? No frostbite/imp CS means your pvp sucks pretty bad and no CC/meditation means your already poor frost raid dps will suck even more. If you just want to farm stuff with blizzard and be a useful 5 man dps your spec looks pretty good.
---
You can enjoy the journey and still be mindful of your viability at 60. Just because people ask which class/race/spec combo is best for endgame raiding doesnt mean that particular combination is detrimental to their levelling experience.
---
Enjoying both aspects of the game are not mutuslly exclusive. For example I enjoy both.
---
Probably the number of people on the server as well.  Private servers were overly packed. A certain portion of the general population will have mild brain damage/ mental health issues.  Gordo, for example. A big server will just statistically bring more of these people out of the woodwork.
---
Woe to you, seekers of Thunderfury.   
---
For long after you no longer need loot from MC, you'll still spend two years farming there.  
---
"Steal" away, bud. When you get your first binding, that will be the punishment for your crimes.
---
Depends what you are doing. In raids you can't shatter so that's useless. Frostbite will also be useless as it doesn't proc on bosses. Clearcasting will help a lot with your Mana management at the beginning and when you turn fire.
---
You'd still need to physically walk to the dungeon. You're still grouped with people form you realm. Dungeon Finder only irritated me because it was cross-realm and it ported you to the instance.
---
Even if Blizzard destroyed the functionality of every LFG addon it wouldn't matter much. We have Discord. There will be Realm Discord channels and LFG subchannels. You'll be able to find a group that way far easier than in-game.
---
Its never going to be 2005 again. Its going to be as close to the original experience, but it can't possibly replicate it 100%.
---
Oh shit I forgot about that aspect of flasks!

It’s a joke bro don’t let it get to u that hard lol. They also hello O O G A G A N G, it’s just for fun you dork lol

All of what you listed is very useful in outdoor questing content. And if you wanna AoE kill you absolutely need improved Frost Nova. Are you talking strictly about raids?

He didn’t misquote you. The “misquote” you are accusing him of was very clearly him paraphrasing you after you argued about him directly quoting you verbatim.
---
Your entire little spat with him is you accusing him of things he didn’t say, all while complaining about being misquoted.
---
I forgot mages had mana stones.
---
What is that?
---
Even more unpopular opinion: Blizzard should note what are the most popular add-ons people use and update the game with these functionalities by default.
---
That doesn't really solve it. You have a certain amount of dmg you can dish out before you are oom. Downranking just means it took longer time to deal that damage.
---
&gt; Are you talking strictly about raids?
---
Yes.
---
In a raid, besides the one Winter's Chill bitch, everyone wants Arcane Power.
---
 It sounds like you should consider a PvE server.
---
My one concern is tbc isn’t the same as vanilla and wotlk isn’t the same as either. I loved all 3. I would prefer these 2 options. They either A, change the content timeline and start a new set of games using the vanilla core concepts. Or B, they allow you to port your character to BC on launch so you can still maintain it on vanilla as well. That way, if the community doesn’t evolve properly, you don’t waste all that time.
---
Because it's fun and rewarding.
---
Well, your understanding is wrong. Not just my guild. Everyone went 9 on most recent servers at least because that is the hit cap on those servers. Dodge percentage is off by 1 percent. Do we actually have info on glancing blows and how that interacts with weapon skill yet? I think not. Well we know on private servers at least some bosses have higher armor than they did in Vanilla so it is not really that unlikely. Not to mention how overpowered their prebis gear is looking with the full on 1.12 itemization and talents.
---
I think you are right that prices will be all over the place, but that's because values will be all over the place. The earning potential of a character changes wildly with level, and that means it actually makes sense to liquidate inventory in order to get value.
---
But I gotta say, there are a TON of profitable exchanges to be made for leveling characters: which is to say, an exchange where it makes sense to be both the buyer and the seller.
---
Alchemical recipes, for example, vendor for almost nothing, but are CLEARLY incredibly valuable. For example, the elixir of fortitude recipe, lets you turn 1 steelbloom and 1 goldthorn into a 1 hour buff of 12 stamina. at level 25. That stacks with most other elixirs and basically all class buffs (but not stamina scrolls, I don't think). 
---
The recipe vendors for 5 silver. But it's a world drop anyone could get off of any mob. 
---
Try telling me that that is worth less than half a gold to any level 25  alchemist. You aren't going to do it.  It's value is basically limited by the financial means of a level 25 character, for the classes that actually take damage. I don't know that the price will be, but I certainly predict that someone is going to get value from listing it on the auction house during launch week. 
---
There are similar steals in the 8 strength one (4.5 silver), the 8 agility (2.5 silver), and that's just one profession, and not even materials. Just the recipes. 
---
I think people are used to mature servers, where the auction houses are a waste of time for test characters. If you have your first character on the server, paying 5+ gold for an elixir of fortitude recipe is out of reach, but if you have a stable population of people with established accounts, that's the going rate. But if the person who lucked out to get it is offering it for a drastically lower price? Those sort of things make a huge difference while leveling. 
---
I think that the best time to actually buy and sell these things is pre 60, because at that point, the prices are actually within the means of a pre 60 character. Supply of these items should be very high (due to huge numbers of low and mid level mobs being killed), and these things are clearly extremely valuable to people, to keep prices high enough to justify listing them.  It's also before items which are useful to both max level and low level characters (like swiftthistle) can actually be competed over, instead of being 2 gold a stack for a herb that is likely harvested by characters who on a fresh server would have a net worth of about 2 gold. 
---
It also is extremely fast to find stuff on the auction house, and is much more convenient than the mail system or in person trading. I think it's clealy a place to list a large variety of items, and not just twinking items. 
---
don't be afraid of volatility. Know what something is worth to you, or to your customer, and there is plenty of opportunity for SOMEONE to get value on the auction house. The only reason it might not be you is competition.
---
These are shit, try again.

1. Make a female NE hunter

2. Pretend to be a girl and enter a "long distance relationship" with the guild master

3. ???

4. Profit

That and you can store shards in the bank. I kept 50-100 when I was a tryhard raider. Fill up 75% of my bags with shards and I'm good to go, pick up a few more clearing trash to the portal.

All 3 of them ran within the same framework though.

It seems more like your just rambling off your thoughts. I recommend a diary.

If mob respawns really are going to be much more painful than private servers...then nah, I'm just going to hope they die so I can tag their mobs :)
---
Let's be real, for the first few weeks or so all the low level zones will be an absolute shitfest.
---
It might sound appealing because it's a "one time only" thing that happens when servers open, but honestly, in the end it's 90% shit, 10% fest.
---
Premade with better gear will win regardless of faction
---
Why did you collapse your guild?
---
Doesnt change the fact at all, at lvl 60 u will get mauled by people endlessly better geared than you and you will HAVE TO endure it, there is no escape, there is no bracket to leave.
---
It is mathematically possible, as someone has calculated. The question is then if it's humanly possible.

Everyone seems to think in the worst at tanking, the worst at melee dps, the worst at ranged dps and also the worst at healing.. see if i care! 🤓

U have no idea of the strength of T3 if thats your comparison. In nax u can get 2handers with 95dps compared to hand of ragnaros for example wich is only 81 dps.
---
Did he reject my inv? Yes, then he can die. No, well we're in a party now so I'm already helping.
---
They specifically have asked that people concentrate their play efforts in the first 3 hours. I assume they did the same for past stress tests as well. I will likely not be stoked about it but I will do it for the betterment of the game (hopefully).
---
I was in the beta a good while before the stress test and as far as I remember there were not just big name guilds etc in it. I guess it depends on what you mean by "pro gamers" though, but iirc I got access through a guy from my SWG guild. Although to be fair we were like a secret all-Jedi guild from when being a Jedi was sort of a big deal. We weren't famous or anything though.
---
As for the OP, it's not exactly one the first thing that comes back to mind when thinking about it. One of my most vivid memories from the beta though was when they opened Onyxia's Lair. There was an NPC outside the entrance who just gave out the key, so pretty much anyone with a high level character just ran there and people started making pugs that wiped pretty quickly. While there was a crowd outside I can't say I remember it being anywhere close to what it would've been on a post-release server.

---

---
Can you explain what you mean by this if not "I only buff people who can buff me back" because I'm really at a loss to what else this could mean
---
Odd, you'd think a company with as plenty of resources as Blizzard could've at least spared a couple harddrives for it. That just seems like common sense to me when you have a game that turned out to be as successful as WoW
---
Hardcore 20 hours per week!? Thats a mere casual at best. 40 hours aint even that hardcore, once you reach 100+ hours you can talk about being hardcore.. I cant understand why people bother playing a game like classic with only 10 hours of game time
---
I nominate myself to be one of the select few.
---
Taunt hit is based on spell hit (not melee hit). Melee hit is 8% vs a raid boss, spell hit is 17% vs a raid boss, so even a melee hit capped tank still has 9% chance for taunt to miss.
---
A tip for when you have aggro and the tank needs to taunt:
---
- stop running around, the mob runs at the same speed as you, he’s still hitting you but now the tank has to chase your dumb ass around
---
- cc the mob, kidney shot, frost nova, anything to slow/snare/stun so the tank can get to it faster
---
- run to the tank, what an amazing idea, I know! I would mention it first but it’s so illogical I didn’t want to ruin my chances of getting the other 2 tips across
---
I agree with the first comment - either know your strength and pull big Or pull safe.
---
If you’re in my farm spot you are just as much competition as the opposing faction - I am not going to help you out farm me.
---
You don’t need everyone to like you.
---
If I’m seeing a a guy losing a battle against a rare or a mob near a chest - I am NOT helping you unless you let me roll for the items.
---
So invite me to group and /roll for things.
---
You aren’t my friend - you are a stranger that could easily run off with everything.
---
dude you sound like an asshat
---
Well it's not reduced competition any more thanks to this post. :/

---
I just tried the route out on a pserver. It took me exactly 60 cloth (could be more - depends on luck). 
---
I would never get that much cloth just from levelling to 5, i had to grind for 30 mins @humanoids after lvl 5. 
---
The thing is I'm not really in a rush, I'm just trying to figure out what I should do on tuesday evening since I start my main character on wednesday morning with a friend. So I might start an alt where I farm leather and sell to vendors or get my hands on a LMW. 
---
But as you said, people will be selling LMW withing 2 hours of launch, so maybe I will just farm some leather with the alt
---
WTF? We get the fun stress test and EU is not allowed in?
---
I’d rather play a NE female priest over some ugly ass dwarf any day. Looks and animations &gt; racials
---
I don't care if I get buffed by them. That's the difference. It would be rude to expect a buff back everytime I buffed someone. Just put good energy out into the world and get it back.
---
Unless this extra 23k is &lt;10% of your regular salary, there should not even be a consideration - no matter how harsh it sounds - wow is JUST a game, while the extra money will give you a more comfortable life overall, you should never pass on something which will benefit your real life for something which is merely giving you some fun from time to time and is not even that efficient for the time invested to be honest.. and this is coming from a person who has a pathological hate for work and has spent many-a-days neglecting productivity in favor of 16 hour game sessions... in the end the game will still be here whenever you have the time to play it, so don't miss out on opportunities to ease your real life even by a bit, considering you can literally have both in the end.
---
Why is he even here? He is clearly a kid who heard about Barrens and wc3 chat and tought we might want to hear his low quality crap. We should send him to League Of Legends
---
Mankrik?
---
You must protect the wild!
---
Being a casual leveler, and wanting to take my time, I'm considering skipping the first day. Maybe enough people will pass on ahead so that I can do quests easier.
---
I must be getting old. I would have never considered such a crazy idea 5 years ago.
---
Vanilla was never ment to be competitive in pvp.
---
Pvp was about fun, gearing up. Getting that honor for those titles!
---
It's only once wow started with arenas that it got more competitive tho this mainly kick-started in wotlk
---
Nah, you just do the mountain skip and get to menethil harbor in 5 min

---
Really good point.     
---
I think people will be less disappointed if they aren't expecting to actually be able to play then.
---
wow you can parrot asmongolds theories on reddit, good job
---
**You think you do but you don't. Remember when you had to download the addons...**
---
They probably want to slam their authentication servers.
---
I wouldn't think so. Warriors are one of the most sought after classes for pve and pvp. You'll be ok.
---
I personally enjoyed the 30's bracket the most. The community back then was super close too. We'd always post in the battlegroup forums.
---
You can do the quests, but since you're a shaman you won't have any trainers in Tirisfal and you will have to go back to Durotar/Mulgore to do your totem quests.  
---
How I would do it: Go to Tirisfal, do the entire 1-6 starting zone with level 1 abilities (very easy). Hearth back to Durotar, train spells, do Earth totem quest. Possibly repeat the same method for 6-12 in Tirisfal, which I believe should be doable. Return for spells Fire totem quest in Durotar
---
Yes
---
That's a troll though. Read the entire thing.
---
For me the trip is playing the game at lvl 60 from 5 mans to 40 man dungeons. While important the grind to level was never that appealing to me. I had more fun in the game after I hit lvl 60

Hello
---
The bane of my existence
---
most classes dont wear their tier sets tbh
---
I'm leveling on a pserver atm and there are same kind of shitty people playing like back in the day. Being greedy and stealing mobs or wait until I've pulled the last mob between the node and me and then just grab it etc. Greed wins in most cases and a Reddit post won't change that. It's still nice to remember the decent people out there of what it was like and encourage helping out.
---
Can you stay hidden while casting?
---
Well if you are a rogue and you get the drop on your opponent it doesn't matter what class they are, you win.  If the mage knows you are there he can spam rank 1 arcane explosion and you'll never get an ambush off.
---
Nice?
---
Don't worry. Accept the new job, maybe pop here from time to time and read about the oogas. 
---
And when your new job is settled, get that damn vacation and enjoy the game. Classic will still be there for you.
---
Lok'tag Ogar!
---
How do I refresh the "auto fill" once I changed my char level ?
---
Explorer title was added in wotlk which is when xp locking was added.
---
News flash, we had all the addons we could ever want in vanilla. Just because you didn't use them don't mean that others didn't. Addons back then was completely broken and could essentially be turned into bots so Blizzard have already patched all the holes by going with the modern API. We'll be able to do less now than 2005.
---
Definitely. They do want to test other things as well which is why we got the second test (they even stated so). I believe they also plan on really testing layering during these tests moreso than the normal beta.
---
I would focus on the first 3 hours if I could but with the change in time I probably won’t be home for this one much like the second one. It’s ok though I’ll be playing classic Wednesday night.
---
People never left the basement? Not sure how someone could commit that time either but godspeed and stay healthy lol
---
 Moral of the story: don't drink on vyvanse. Don't drink on amphetamine at all, but especially not on the one that keeps on releasing for 12 hours after you take it.
---
Gear score doesn't even work in vanilla because of how iLvls and stats work.
---
The addon API can't search crossrealm and can't teleport to the dungeon. Not only is that addon a non-functional troll, but all an addon could do would be to "replicate" trade chat spam into a more visible UI, and only for people using said addon. This is like oQueue back in the day, though I think it was released after vanilla.
---
Your 15 second google result should be followed by 15+ seconds of brain activity to evaluate what you found. Vanilla had whatever addons you wanted, and there's no reason to change that in classic.
---
That’s really good to hear, thanks for the input man!
---
Wow classic has all of the 'terrible' (opinion) things modern mmos have streamlined.
---
The average American works 47 hours per week, with a 27 minute commute, and sleeps 52 hours per week, leaving ~62 hours per week. Easily another 7 for hygiene and food prep, giving you 55 hours of free time. If you don't want to develop severe health problems, that's 48 hours.
---
So yes, I consider spending 40% of your free time, "hardcore".
---
I used to think of myself as a competent WoW-player with insight into pretty much every aspect of the game.
---
Then I logged onto an character if mine and was hit by a sense of inadequacy. I felt, in the light of all this theorycrafting and ways of improving gameplay through extensions, that I was less complete and found myself prone to looking everything up in spite of my self-picture as a veteran player.
---
All these optimization tendencies proliferates the "risk of failing" and also general anxiety. Am I doing it "right" seems to be the question that haunts me.
---
And in as far as I second the notion that people should "play as they want" I can't help but the think that min/max is influencing people regardless of whether or not they "make us of it".
---
I still feel so terrible about it. Even though I can't remember their names, I fucking LOVED those people.

They aren’t going to remove it. Hopefully they do something to make it harder to force a shift.
---
One idea I see floated that would really hinder node/chest/rare farming like that is requiring you to be in a rested area to switch layers. 
---
During WoD it was rampantly abused for rare farming and other stuff. In legion they changed it so not just any invite will do but requires someone close in proximity. Would help a bit but would still be exploitable.

"Tiny weapon bonus" +Weapon skill is hands-down no question the best stat in the game for melee. If you wanna bait people into a troll, don't be so obvious in the first sentence lol..

sadly you are being the asshole here right now :)

Mommy says it's my turn to post it.
---
Hey just learned this today in taladrials discord that currently in classic healing spells cast before aggro will not cause threat. Therefore pre hotting will be okay. Major buff for resto druid in 5 mans and a slight gimp for feral tanks on multi mob pulls. Keep an eye on it as the beta continues things might change.

Naturally i whipped up the thottbot, looked at the rewards. Scryer had a freaking epic EPIC mage ring!

You have to remember a lot of people never got to experience the end game properly. As soon as BC came out, Vanilla end game was over. As soon as Wrath came out BC end game was over, and so forth.
---
If you didn't buy an expansion, the "end game" was cut from your game. Even if you did, the "end game" is now completely different. Leaving all those who never got to experience it, those who only waded the waters, and even those who experienced every inch and just want to run it back with everything they know now (second life + nostalgia), drooling over it.
---
Let people enjoy whatever they find most magnetic about the game. No need to gatekeep.

Player Name: Chidaddy

Profession: Alch/Herb
---
How to contact: IM me or reply with any who have an open spot.

Days available: Any combo of days 2-3 times a week. with any raid ending at or prior to 10pm cst
---
Desires: I am looking to join a guild that is open to having me play an SP Ret paladin or "spelladin" as my spec. I have done tons of research on the subject and truly believe it would be a fantastic experience since paladins were always considered a non option for dps back in vanilla prior to the knowledge we have now. I will be farming constantly to ensure I have the proper consumables for any raid and am also going to have a dedicated healing set for premades  and raids if a healer is unable to show.
---
I Googled it and I didn't find anything, I don't get it
---
It's never bad enough to make playing a lock not fun. I never minded it back in the day, it's just another step you get used to. Buying ammo and feeding your pets always seemed more annoying to me.
---
The main difference is (apart from the time it takes to level a twink to 49) is the mounts, also feels a bit more balanced since you have a wider talent and skill pool. Sweet spot is 39 if you ask me, but 19 is the most populated.
---
Yes Alliance warlocks have to deal with WotF and Tremor Totem.
---
But Horde has to deal with paladin bubbles and Fear Ward.
---
Your choice.
---
When I played Night Elf initially, I got some seriously good mileage out of wisp form.
---
Had a pretty large group rolling horde. Then my wife said she’d play, I told her I wouldn’t force her to play something she didn’t like.  Now my group of ~20 is looking like a group of 5 or 6. Only 3 for sure.
---
If you have no one else going alliance with you I would say go horde. Of course you could use the same argument on them that you use on yourself. Hell that was why I was going horde at first. My one friend said if I’m playing I’m going horde I did ally in vanilla. Lo and behold I’m going ally anyways.
---
You’re trying so hard to not be labeled as homophobic, but then you end your rant telling me to back to my “safe space” and then calling me a “shit dick”.

Ythisens, the former Blizzard CM, was [interviewed on ClassiCast back in Feburary](https://youtu.be/IhSAJ8aA3PQ?t=616). In that, he pointed out that he and the general team were told Classic was coming 7 months before the announcement at Blizzcon 2017. Ythisens believed that development started around a year before the team was told, meaning that development started right after the Nostalrius shutdown, and before the petition and visit by the Nost devs. 
---
That would seem to click in with the timeline provided by Ion in [this interview](https://www.wowhead.com/news=291757/xdlate-wow-classic-interview-with-ion-hazzikostas-and-calie-schie) back in May. 
---
&gt;A few years ago, I think in 2016, there was a really big outcry around the whole topic and the community really forced us to take a close, hard look at it and to say "ok, we don't think we can do this". But what if we look again, what if someone told you we had to find a way to do it, what we might come up with, and some of our programmers tried different approaches. 
---
The only trouble is that there seems to be a contradiction in the same interview, where Ion later says:
---
&gt;but we felt like we realized for the first time, "we can do this." 
---
That realization came maybe around the middle of 2017-- when we finally reached that point, and we quickly set up to build a team around this project, and not long after we announced it to the world at BlizzCon. 
---
Ythisens himself did point out that he wasn't sure about the timeline, and it may have been that the team started looking at whether they could do it right after the Nost shutdown, as Ion said, and only half-way through 2017 did Omar have his breakthrough. It does make sense that the team would look at Classic's viability right after the Nost shutdown because of the press it generated at the time.
---
How can a hunter get all the way to the last boss of DM north by himself?
---
I started spamming trade at one point. Once I started doing it a lot is when people got worried.bi wanted it to be a casual guild with twinks but tbh all I cared about was twinks. That's where it fell apart.
---
All of them. Honestly I was expecting them.
---
What race did you start with? Any idea how long it took to run there from level 1?
---
this hurt my soul
---
But then everyone would choose Paladin.
---
At level 20, i will type /dracarys 1
---
At level 40, I will type /dracrys 2,
---
And finally, at level 60, I will type /dracarys 3.
---
It will just work.
---
Elemental Triad set from MoP champions trial for mage ..... I just think that is one of the best looking sets for mage in game.
---
The general gist of OP was that it "brings out the worst in people", implying that this kind of thing is even remotely common. It isn't. To suggest "pvp brings out the worst in people" because of a videogame mechanic working as intended with clarifying language in the ToS exempting it from the griefing policy is just asinine.
---
People aren't toxic dickweeds because they gank lowbies in a videogame that allows them to gank lowbies and facilitates this by putting lower and higher level players in close proximity to each other at most stages of the game.
---
How do I know that extreme harassment to the point of mechanically breaking the game by literally stalking somebody is rare? Because I have been playing WoW since 2005 and this shit is rare, that's why.
---
if you PvE yeh, nothing to do after you gear up. If you PvP gearing is just a grind before you can do the actual content.
---
Even "Max Level" pvp has various aspects. A pre-raid/pre-R10 is going to do less damage than a R14 or someone in T2/T3. So it almost devolves into a psudeo-twink state when people's gear start to expand.
---
What about AV? Or is that jist PS?
---
Yeah yeah, fuck you and your tedious brand of gaslighting.
---
I’m just replying to signal a notification in your inbox.
---
You got issues bud. Go have them somewhere else. Ignored
---
&gt; That was the goal with Vanilla, but the game literally was not designed to make that feasible.
---
Is it nowadays? Method had 9 affliction warlocks in a 20 man raid on their first kill of the most recent raid final boss and only brought 7 of the 11 classes in the game. Thw world first had 4 ele shamans and 3 affliction warlocks. Top guilds always heavily stacked the best dps possible and with the modern loot system it's become even more extreme, as it's mcuh easier to appropiately gear those alts.
---
Ret paladin (from t2 onwards) and both dps shaman specs have the advantage of having fairly little gear overlap with other classes, which by itself is also an argument against bringing the 8th mage or fury warrior.
---
I like it. You intend on adding color to it?
---
Paladins arent for hire. 
---
Rogues are.
---
&gt; I buff people who can buff. Reciprocity is good etiquette.
---
I was refering to the fact that you only buff people are are able to buff.
---
Hey man think of it differently. You will not have to be lvling with the zerg. That means all those sweet chests, rare mobs, and special npcs that needs to be killed won't be camped.
---
10:44 btw xD
---
How do you select the option for selecting 1h or 2h weapon types?
---
Will probably keep it blank scared I will not color it right
---
Thanks. Iv been looking for a video on this topic for a little while. Looking forward to watching it.
---
Ah I get you, but we're comparing modern wow with vanilla here. That's the crucial detail.
---
&gt; At the end of the day, I guess I don't really know what I'm talking about.
---
All you need to know.
---
The faster a quest mob dies, the faster a quest mob respawns. You'll wait longer by not helping, then if you had just helped to begin with.

Warlock. I bet that soulstone experience is one hell of a ride...

Man I still remember getting paid gold so people could watch me group mob farm with frost.  The ranged freeze that your pet had was ok when combined with your own nova, plus chance to freeze through cold blood or what ever it was.
---
"equal gear" is not a thing. Then the one who rolled more crits. Difference between races is negligible.
---
I was possible at some time, but they patched it. On classic shadowmeld will drop while casting. 
---
I remember our marksman hunters ambushing the horde (RP PVP guild, NE only) and the entire first attack wave were a metric fuckton of aimed shots (long cast time, massive damage) out of nowhere.
---
Wtf, why am I so excited for this?
---
I got it
---
What is the mountain skip? Can it be done on classic? I heard they nerfed the jumping up vertical surfaces stuff.
---
Your right he didn't misquote me. I never accused him of it either. You are jumping in on something you apparently didn't understand. Though if you read the other comments you'll see the one I'm referring to. How you read that and misinterpreted it I don't understand.
---
I see what you did there. Man I miss that game. :)
---
I watched the whole thing and discovered... I just don't fucking care.

Layering will be in the game for ~2 months at worst, there's just not enough damage a player or group of players could do during that time for me to give a single fuck.

Meanwhile, waiting in a queue? Yeah, fuck that.

You people (like OP that want limits to people play time, no addon etc) need to grow up and go make your luck instead of waiting on a higher authority to fix everything for you.
---
No need to reproduce failed models in a MMO, thanks.
---
I would imagine the chance of that affecting you is near zero. You'd have to roll on my server, be in my zone and run past me for it to even affect you at all.
---
Yeah u right, it’s disgusting.
---
The post is for people who care buddy
---
I’d love that.
---
They should introduce some kind of dmg/heal to honor ratio. On AV even if you dmg mobs u still get some work for your team.
---
There's also the fact, that while ret paladin has a lower ceiling than any of the dps classes, it certianly isn't guaranteed everybody can play those closses to theri full potential. The average ret paladin will put a lot more owrk into it than the average mage or warrior, so they might very well end up ahead of them just because of that.
---
THANK YOU SIR HandsUp
---
And cleanse, BoF, BoS.
---

---
For levelling / 5 mans its fine but you will want to respec for MC+
---
And I guarantee you there are more people that care about not having queue times than there are that care about the select few abusing layering.
---
I probably wouldn’t. Pvp servers are great if you like ganking, since I’d say 80% of fights start by someone attacking another party while they’re pulling/eating. Higher level it’s kind of fun when you’re more focused on gathering nodes of resources and likely full on hp/cds and ready to fight, but it can be a real pain in the ass getting repeatedly ganked when you just want to level. It’s kill or be killed a lot of the time, except even if you kill they might call in reinforcements and you’ll be killed several times as punishment (unless you call in your own gang, but that eventually leads to some full blown pvp, which while immensely fun does not lead to any leveling). 
---
YMMV, but I wouldn’t bother with a pvp server unless you’ve got chunks of time to spend so your play session doesn’t feel completely worthless depending on the mercy of the enemy faction
---
Playing with your peers, good idea.
---
How will a addon ruin the economy?
---
I think people on this sub are highly underestimating Shamans. Anyone with any vanilla pserver experience does NOT make this same mistake, however.
---
How much deception can you take?
---
How many lies will you create?
---
How much longer until you break?

I guarantee you if layering will be abused it will kill the game, none of us want that, do we?
---
Spelladins aren't a thing.
---
Repair bots, however, are. 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=18232#.
---
How?
---
Jumper cables for sure, but cloaking device is easily replaced by another trinket in the slot (as you have to equip it and can't do that in combat)
---
You guys all have Switches right!
---
I don't have first hand experience of the numbers, but based on what I have read it is far from "garbage". Garbage would be doing bringing 200 dps while others bring 800+. If offspec can bring around 60-70% of top tier dps when counting his buffs its sub optimal but not garbage.
---
For starters, AP scaling for Eviscerate. What made Eviscerate broken way back in Vanilla was the fact that regardless of your gear, it'd deal stupid damage, so you didn't have to use real weapons or gear, you just needed to build 5 combo points and CB-Evis. That's not possible in 1.12 anymore.
---
Also, diminishing returns were WAY off at the beginning of vanilla, and CCs lasted a ridiculous amount of time because of that. IIRC; before 1.4, there were no iterations of DR in the game. That was the patch they put the system in place that we know today: first CC is full duration, next CC that shares the same DR has 75% duration etc. 
---
Also, if you're assuming rogues have all their cooldowns twice, might aswell assume they're fighting a mage with Iceblock and Cold Snap. Or a Pally. Or a Druid which can't be blinded because of his poison dispell being a 9s duration buff. Or... You get my point. Rogues in 1.12 simply aren't the beasts they used to be in earlier patches. Not only because of certain changes that made them weaker, but moreso because most other classes were WAY stronger in comparison. The overall power level shifted a lot from early - late Vanilla.
---
Yeah but 2 in arctic reach 2 in frost channeling with no cold snap.
---
And imp counterspell instead of imp dampen.
---
I don't think this is accurate. I've participated in the last two stress tests and have had zero problems logging in and playing.
---
Dude, please , I’m talking to you on an individual level here . Do not ever in any context use the phrase “bro” it’s just god it’s so fucking cringe man
---
I used a full suite of add ons in vanilla. Wish people would stop suggesting this shit.
---
I did a lot of herbalism too back then and I don't remember seeing one.
---
I guess they were over camped !
---
Kill the game? Hardly.
---
It's nice for group pvp engagements like BGs because it does allow you to sustain for longer, which can win skirmish that ultimately leads to winning the BG. I think it's worth it for PvP.
---
Mate it will still be there and people will be stuck with only MC for ages. You can have the best of both worlds .
---
Your voting system will turn into tyranny of the majority, you know that right?
---
Also, leveling addons existed during vanilla, I used one. Nobody is going to make a gear score addon or take it seriously because gearscore doesnt matter in vanilla, and there were plenty of addons back in vanilla that helped you optimise leveling professions.
---
Just because it wasn't how you experienced vanilla, it doesn't mean it wasn't how others experienced vanilla.
---
Ah alright, I see. Those matchups certainly do exist - but that's the case for twinking too. You can be a regular joe leveling hunter, unless the twinked out rogue gets the opening on you, he's simply not going to be able to catch you.
---
I was gonna make one for “dude” but I just wanna end the cycle 😂
---
They are still around, just under a new name. I’m sure google would give you an answer.
---
healer gear is pretty useless for a spelladin.
---
If you go pure spelladin, t2 is a supreme choice and guess who wants t2? ret and prot paladins and holies want max 3 pieces.
---
Weapon is pretty much irrelevant for a spelladin and even then 2h weapons are pretty much useless for anybody but paladins.
---
another good item for spelladins are the scrolls of lbinding light, a paladin only trinket in bwl, so you only comepte with holy paladins there.
---
That leaves necklace, cloak, rings and one trinket up for contention with other classes and as hand of justice is extremely good, trinket isn't that improtant as well.
---
So, a spelladin contests a total of four items with other classes.
---
I have done the journey to 60 so many times, I want it to be over so I can play the game as I enjoy, the endgame.
---
Yes the raids can be pretty dull, but roaming around the world, participating in endgame pvp and doing the things I enjoy at 60. Not gated by levels.
---
... when Nostalrius was forced to be shut down, people petitioned for Classic. 280k people signed it. 
---
https://www.change.org/p/mike-morhaime-legacy-server-among-world-of-warcraft-community
---
It's absolutely delusional to think that that wasn't the main catalyst why anything regarding Classic happened.
---
First few days are just reading syllabi anyway, right? You can probably skip doing homework for the first three weeks before you're technically even really behind.
---
A little but not entirely /s
---
&gt; I'd like to know what lotuses and flasks went for during actual vanilla and compare it to private servers.
---
I doubt this is compareable as flasks where a lot less used in Vanilla compared to pservers. I was in one of the top guilds on my server and for example flasks were never mandatory for anything. Some ppl would still use them, but you wouldn't see raids fully flasked for every little bit of content like you see on pservers some times.
---
Everyone will play human when being able to, just accept it
---
how come dampen isn't used more?  reduce healing or something?
---
Never said it was optimal to heal as Elemental. Obviously, someone who puts all of their points in the Restoration tree is going to heal better than someone who doesn't.
---
I said it's not necessary to be full Resto and still get the job done. The difference in healing output &amp; utility between a 21 Resto Shaman vs. a 51 Resto Shaman is pathetic. On the other hand, farming consumables and gold for gear/enchants is a serious commitment in classic. It's not easy to do in a Resto spec. If I'm a GM, I'd rather have Shaman with a hybrid spec and full consumables + enchantments than a pure Resto who slacks off on consumables/etc because it's a pain in his ass for him to farm.
---
Think of it like this, If you can get 2-3 procs while using up your entire mana bar you can get out 3 more big casts, which, I think, is a very good deal, I’d definitely go for it for pve
---
Look man, there are alternative ways of dealing with high player pops or “travelers” who come on day 1 but leave by the end of two weeks. If layering is in game by the time people are hitting 60, it will break game immersion. I’ve played beta and stress tests and been very annoyed when things like this occur. The reason I reposted the video is to bring it to peoples’ attention. That’s all. We all want Classic to be successful. If pop is an issue make servers smaller but don’t do layering/sharding or any of this garbage. You mentioned that layering will be in game 2 months tops, but I’m very skeptical that that’s going to be the case, which is what is making me worried.
---
&gt; also you can do flips and play a game counting how many flips you can get in a row
---
Got me there. Rolling a NE warlock now ... wait ...
---
There is no loot trading in vanilla/classic
---
https://youtu.be/p3KAF09ueoM
---
Epic store exclusive inc.
---
I’ll heal you, I won’t be happy about healing a rogue, but if it means the warrior and I live, I’ll heal ya.
---
Imagine reposting asmongold unironically
---
I mean I haven't done classic raids but he has a lot of videos up and always seems to perform ok. Maybe rest of his group are weaker players but I definitely wouldn't call that garbage. Sure, it might be sub optimal, but in my opinion there is a difference between that and garbage.
---
For example if you have 0 resto shamans available, would you rather have 5 fury warrior group or 4 fury + 1 ench? Is it better to have windfury totem + tranquil totem twist + ench dps or just another warrior? 
---
If threat is ever a problem, tranquil air totem reduces that by 20%. Doesn't that mean that those 4 warriors can deal 20% more damage each resulting in the group getting total 80% of full warrior dps from that alone?
---
having a bunch of level 30 night elves playing hide and seek from the level 60 Horde with shadowmeld actually sounds hilarious
---
A shaman ofc
---
&gt; catalyst 
---
catalyst (for something) a person or thing that causes a change
---
... how is that not exactly what Nostalrius was/did?
---
Not sure why you are digging through wikis when all you have to do is look at any of the item drops and read the stats, for example onyxia drops: ten storms [9 damage and healing], judgement [32 damage and healing], sapphiron drape [+14 dmg/healing], nemesis skullcap [+32 dmg/heal]. Some specifically only say healing such as stormrage cover [29 healing] but nearly everything else is damage and healing.
---
i was annoyed at how the streamers power leveled in SM etc rather than enjoying the quests and world
---
Damn, that gotta be minimum wage?
---
well after u graduated u can go play without worries xD
---
Not for pissing off people, for that it’s hunter BIS by far
---
Stino is that you ?
---
Please change the misleading title its not for everyone its for the US.
---
Even for shadow ?
---
If they "fixed" that it would be interesting to see how raid skips work out. In MC atm im pretty sure people wall-climb over the lava pits.
---
The two are a little bit different. For one thing, you stand way more of a fighting chance when you're up against someone in r14 and you're wearing lvling gear, compared to a lvl 19 wearing leveling gear and being up against a twink.
---
You can win the first matchup with a combination of skill, luck, and a good class matchup. The second matchup you can't win ever.
---
Twinking is also corrosive to people queing in a way that top lvl gear differences really isn't.
---
I like Layering. Enough said. I really don't care what you think.
---
Given that the Night Elves have been the dominant race in Azeroth by far the longest time, it is expected that pretty much every terrible and wonderful thing that has happened in the world is their doing. Hence, I find your discrimination misplaced and illogical.
---
Millions of people counting down to my birthday =D
---
Alright that’s a great way to present an argument!
---
I had an old tiny black and white TV that would have FOX on. I would listen to a lot of Malcom in the middle and That 70s show.
---
it's still going strong  (although just like warcraft, it has become more commercial over the years and many old players think it somewhat lost its 'spirit.' )
---
Burning steppes.
---
&gt; I don't think this is accurate.
---
It is accurate.  You can read the dozens of players who could not log in on the thread for the stress tests.  Some people got on, but many of us could not get on at all for the whole test.
---
If you want to go that route, it's actually Trolls.
---
Do you think it would be a good idea to have a classic server that evolves and gets wiped periodically? Like instead of moving to an expansion like TBC to just have seasons (that last a long time maybe 1-2 years) and with every fresh season they could tack on new content and fix existing stuff?
---
&gt; dozens
---
In a stress test of several thousand? Yeah, okay.
---
Plenty of other people have though. It's a good warning to give out to people, because not only have people had problems in the past tests, but this test is for *anyone* with a subscription, meaning the amount of people that are going to test is likely much more massive and has an even better chance of causing problems for people.
---
Then you put up a portal and no one clicks it.
---
Yes I know. But 30 years on people would look at me oddly if I rolled up to the games store to play with 10 year olds. :) Srsly though, I did try getting back into it a couple of years back. But as you say, it just wasn't the same.
---
Pretty sure this video is by Savix.
---
Honestly it's probably make me buy a switch lol
---
Uhm, they protect streamers against ganks in half of the clips man..
---
Lol if this is true Im gonna run out of this world. Are you trolling? The amount or obsession with dps meters is already mind numbing to me, but this is just retarded. I know, I know, let anyone play the way they want, but at this point Im just speechless for all these people.
---
It's pretty obvious that Blizzard put people in buckets for the last stress test. If you were in the bucket that couldn't login, sucks to be you.
---
I plan on rolling on a pve server, so really the joke is on you.
---
Get a life seriously.
---
*nice*
---
There will be a lot more warriors :)
---
There's two references for "gm" here.
---
Guild Master, and Game Master.
---
It seems you are replying to the wrong person, I ridiculed sales numbers too, because it's fucking sub based game and WoW had the most subs, literally the most players, during WotLK.
---
is this video by asmongold? I didn't know :)
---
A druid so I could ride him and wouldn't have to walk
---
Stealth falls off really fast with level differences though. You get like 10 yards detection zone.
---
well i think he allready has a record on privat server under 100 hours but u have to keep in mind he plays huntard so nearly everything is more effcient than any other class lvl 20 aspect of cheetah is huge and no class comes close to grind efficient. I think the average for the no life people that practice level routes will be around 120-150 hours (cause at launch there also will be HUGE competiton)
---
efficient
---
 while traveling
---
You can put VLC/WMP in 'always on top' mode, so you can have fullscreen wow and then have a little movie playing on top in the corner or something. I always preferred that.
---
Let the salt flow through this one.
---
I'd rather the jumper cables.
---
Because levelling is the start of a 2+ year journey. I have far more played at 60 than 1-59 in the end.
---
What is this question?
---
Nope.
---
Vanilla population data doesn't support this.
---
Private server population data doesn't support this.
---
Classic Beta server population doesn't support this.
---
The most popular survey data doesn't support this.
---
Don't waste time on this idiot.
---
Everyone is acting like it’s day one or bust. It barely applies if you’re really serious about the game, as you won’t be able to do much on day one. Unfortunately I’ll be attending a school event from 26-30, and August 27th is my birthday too. I would have loved to have my character’s birthday be the same as mine but oh well, I’ll survive *somehow*
---
How so? I get that they don't need the rep, but rep is a time sink, not a gold sink.
---
Oh snap, you’re correct! Wow! The things you don’t notice, and the you can’t unsee them.
---
Warriors will fall from grace. They are a very hard class to play properly
---
Your life must be so great being that angry 😘
---
What RP server? :P
---
Don't think it was meant as an argument. He was stating his opinion which he has based on the pros/cons of layering or not layering. It's simple really, some people value certain things over other. For you, it's vital that layering doesn't allow player to abuse game mechanics and that trumps other issues the game will have if population overload isn't handled. For him, the latter is more important.  
---
To me, the problem with the layering discussion is that we don't know how it will work. We don't know exactly how long they intend to use it, we don't know at which state of development the technology is in and we don't know how it will work when it's completely done. Most arguments are being made of assumptions that people make that fits their opinion that they already have.
---
Wut? First I've ever heard of that, we usually jump in the lava.
---
We personally have times for every class under 100 hours, including compensating for the launch day surge. Once you get past the zerg, it's completely dependent on you and your support staff, which Joana had none.
---
My god why is everyone here so argumentative?! I bloody prefer xrealm bgs myself. **But we did not have then in classic until way after Naxx**.
---
And almost every guild fell apart at that point. It does not matter if guilds had steady increases of players. Towards the end of the content additions, things calmed down and Naxx is known as a big guild killer. It happened back then. It happens on pservers. *It will happen again on classic*.
---
I am not asking for anything to be changed. I am happy with their decision despite the issues with that. Not sure how you could misunderstand the simple fact I wrote and project so many assumptions into it. Then argue the point based on a weak and too general “afaik”. That is unfair of you, mate.
---
Feel like I'm the only one who loved aq40
---
Hey man just trying to have a discussion, no need to flame anyone
---
How do you get Darnassus rep?
---
Too much cringe. Please don't wear those for your wedding...
---
I usually fall into the lava trying to make the jump tbh, but majority of people i've seen ride the walls.
---
Don’t worry about min maxing prior to 60 
---
Then you ALSO say you like big numbers and spout on about rockbiter scaling better with an agi build 
---
You are literally min maxing while telling other not to min max
---
I know for certain there will be a german client, but I dont know for other languages.
---
The real question for me is, in which state this german client will be.
---
A few days ago I had a discussion with a friend about proper nouns in Classic.
---
Because in the past, while all game texts were translated and even the NPC-Voices (who often said stuff from Warcraft 3 units) were replaced with the german ones, 
---
they kept the proper nouns for places and other things. Ironforge was still Ironforge in the german client. The same goes with Stormwind, Undercity, Crossroads, Stormpikes etc.
---
Eventually they changed that during BC and "germanized" all this long established lore-names. (E.g. they renamed Grom Hellscream to Grom Höllschrei)
---
While I really like my language, this change doesnt work really well for me. 
---
Because 
---
1. they should never change established names
---
2. Somehow the english language works very well for naming and describing things with one word (e.g. Crossroads). But when you translate it to "Wegekreuz", it loses its natural feeling, because it doesnt really translate that well. It is hard to explain.
---
But we got a message from a german community manager, that the game will roll out with all the original english names again and I am really happy about that.
---
Raid times/days are my biggest thing in searching for to work around
---
Uhh, humans can be rogues....
---
*305 vs 315
---
Need active account so yes. There is s post in this sub with the blue text
---
Where’s this data
---
This is why I'm pumped to be a night elf druid.
---
Not just leveling, but dungeons too. Imagine trying to run any dungeon in contested territory. If you only have a few hours, by the time you get to the portal, you'll have to go.
---
It's not gonna be terrible if people even miss a week or a month. Eventually you get there and you get to do all the stuff you remember.
---
You just made up that only dozens of people could not log on and thousands of people could.  
---
What players were reporting:  
---
&gt;I stayed up until around 2:00am UK time trying to log on    
---
&gt;Lots of people didnt get in, myself included.
---
&gt;You trying to log in, sitting in queue, failing at character creation, was participating in the stress test. Yeah a lot of us didnt get in, but the purpose was not to test contwnt, but the load on the server.   
---
&gt;Heres my experience, I spent 2 hours trying to long in and when I finally got to character creation I couldnt make one. I didn't even get to finalize my character let alone load into the world.   
---
&gt;I stayed up til almost 2am because I wanted to help stress test and thought that because I could see others getting in game I could too.    
---
&gt;Not going to lie this was really frustrating I stayed up past 2am and I couldn’t log in, not ONCE while I could see all the streamers getting on just fine .... I’m really disappointed i didn’t get to be a part of this!     
---
&gt;Tried to login a few times starting from 2pm PDT to 3pm, no luck. Didn’t get past the login screen.     
---
&gt;Got in after trying for over 2 hours, played until level 3. dc'd and now I'm in an 11 min queue with over 2000 ahead of me    
---
&gt;Was halfway through my 40 minute wait time queue to enter and it just cancelled. Had to start it over.     
---
and on and on
---
Update the database
---
No, but you'll have to return to Darkshore for the second half of it, so might as well stay for another xouple of levels and save yourself the trip. UNLESS your friends can just summon you using DM's meeting stone or something
---
Best humor so far on this post. Well played, I’m interested
---
&gt; The more people play Classic
---
You think this discourages people from playing? Or from streaming? What are you smoking? The clips with the Ooga gang in them are one of the most entertaining organic content on the classic server right now.
---
The thing is that they don't just gank people. Stuff what they did to venruki (steathing behind him and sitting down in a half circle before unstealthing) or staysafe (running through him stealthed "in concert") is what makes these guys more an advertisement than anything.
---
No they all play warriors next
---
We are talking about video games, it’s not that complex. Don’t make money from someone’s IP without their permission, if you do have their permission then it’s all good, everyone is happy.
---
The only part about rogue that I'm dreading is warriors not bringing me to their groups because they're fury warriors gearing up for raiding and they don't want to have to roll on the melee dps gear. So obviously I'm gonna try to avoid this by mostly running with my guild. :P
---
I don't own a switch, but I was going to get one due to Sword &amp; Shield. I would totally AFK grind some mobs on a Switch though. The only problem is I don't want to do group content with people that think it's acceptable, lol.
---
Anecdotally in my pserver guild raiding up to and Inc naxx for aq40 and naxx we've been dreadfully short on rogues.
---
Classic might not be for you.
---
That guy already said he doesn't care about any argument and will never change his mind. He's just trolling you.
---
That feeling when you last checked over 10 days ago and time flew by without realising
---
DANCC, bro! You really DAB'D that MEME!
---
You're the one that said dozens, not me.
---
It wasnt meant to reflect a rational fear. It was more of a comment on a shitty and selfish behaviour.
---
so u mean u have some people who will support u with gold etc? yeah maybe this boost alot if rogue/warris reach 60 in under 100 hours played im mindblown xD
---
Doesn't seal of justice do the same thing?
---
For me personally, I don't like ganking. Ganking is the only difference from PVE to PVP. There will still be wPVP, there will still be battles at instance entrances, major cities, towns, etc. The ONLY difference, is you have a choice. Need to get that quest done before you log? Go for it. Need to get to the dungeon quick so you can clear in a couple hours? Np. Have extra time to kill and there's a wpvp battle happening? Sure, join in! I'm playing pretty casually as well, so the control over how I spend my time is very important to me.
---
I realize that I just didn’t want this thread to become a bunch of people throwing insults at one another. Was really trying to get some meaningful discussion going 😊
---
Id go with whatever race you think is cooler/would want to be
---
I don’t have a problem with that if I’m getting a free mount
---
Give him the money
---
Point me to that selfish behavior and I'll join team condemnation. Selfish people really get on my nerves.
---
**Lok'tar Ogar** \- We are currently recruiting members for our warband!
---
Hello everyone! I am Ryan aka Draka/Lovings the GM and MT of &lt;Lok'tar Ogar&gt;. I will continue playing an Orc warrior as I have done from Vanilla-Wotlk. I peaked in Wotlk as a server first Fury Warrior and guild officer. Unhappy with the direction of retail and the warrior class I unsubbed.
---
Here we are today after almost a decade later. Awaiting the relaunch of classic wow, and I couldn't be more excited!
---
This will be a **freshly formed** guild. You will **not** have to worry about a veteran guild core that will be biased towards new members and loot. This guild will create lasting friendships and accomplishments that will follow us until the end of the server life.
---
***Our Guilds Goals***
---
* To be an **active** and **known** guild on our server to both Horde and Alliance. We strive to be role models to other members of the Horde and our community members; while maintaining ruthlessness and dominance over the Alliance. **We are looking for Dedication.**
---
* **Experience** and **progress all content**. It goes without saying that we will clear all dungeons and raids, PvE world bosses, and enjoy PvP/WPvP. As Blizzard will update the game in phases, we will stay competitive and up to date with each phase.
---
* **Have fun** and **make friends**! If you're time investment with &lt;Lok'tar Ogar&gt; is not valued, enjoyable or you're hard work is not recognized... what is the point? 📷 📷  
---
*Zero tolerance for drama and poor etiquette; will be dealt with immediatly.*
---
* **Strength in numbers**. Through leveling and gearing we will need to help each other and have each others back: dungeons, group quests, elite quests and being ganked and camped. It is expected to come to the aid of anyone who needs it.
---
* **Using time efficiently and effectively**. The player base is a lot older now most of us have commitments outside of the game. With this I hope also brings maturity and wisdom. Our guild is a team. Every member will have purpose. If you are constantly late or absent from guild events, everyone will suffer. Min/Max is not required, but encouraged. Everyone will be lent a helping hand up, but you are expected to pull your own weight and be the best teammate you can be.
---
***Raiding*** \-- Suicide Kings / Loot Council  
---
Raid Group 1 will start Raiding *one month* after launch.  
---
Looking for Class Leaders as an active leadership role.  
---
Most raids in vanilla thankfully do not take a long time to clear if well prepared. Know your pre raid BiS prior to 60 we will help you, ask questions!
---
***Raid Group 1*** \--Suicide Kings / Loot Council  
---
*Tuesday/Wed 8:30 PM - 11:45 PM EST*
---
This will be our **progression** raid comp with only our Mains BiS + consumables. Players are required to maintain an attendance of 80% (Every 5 weeks you can miss 1 raid group. Min 2 hr notice)  
---
After every raid people will have the option to stay in raid groups for World PVP as a full raid, Premade PVP or World PvE. *Every 60mins Raid time will be a 5 min break.*
---
***Raid Group 2*** \--/ Loot Council  
---
*Time -TBD Thurs/Fri or Sat/Sun*\------(RAID GROUP 1 UNTIL PHASE 2/3)  
---
Between phases 2 and 3 there will be a second raid group formed. (Raid Group 2)  
---
We expect every player at some point in phases 2-3 to have an alt level 60. Group 2 runs will be used to help gear up Mains in group 1. Swap out players who go on vacation, play and practice with new members, enjoy meme specs, create more gold for the guild, farm more recipes and just fuck around. We can also sell loot to PuG's from group 2 when it is no longer needed and split the gold equally across guildies. This has a ripple effect as our group 1 and group 2 no longer need gear we could start 3rd alts or sell more loot and everyone will profit.
---
***Community Events***
---
* Duel tournaments, Scavanger Hunts, Meme Contests -- for prizes!
---
***Enough about us lets talk about you!***
---
* &lt;Lok'tar Ogar&gt; Is looking for Semi Hardcore players ages 21-35.
---
* Commitment, Respect, Honor, Trust are core values.
---
* Some Prior Experience in World of Warcraft is Required.
---
* Discord + Headset and Microphone.
---
All Roles are Currently being reviewed and accepting all applications on Discord!

My personal favourite is to just cast res on random dead bodies. 1 in 5 will randomly appear next to me, it's the best feeling
---
I've done two 1-12 runs on a NElf (pserver, reportedly very similar to classic beta, but who knows) to get back to WoW and did so pretending its launch day.
---
I skipped both spider cave and furbolg cave, named spider quest and the quest where u have to loot something from a wardrobe. One took me 2h 10min and the other 2h 35min. Now, if its so crowded u have to skipp all lvl1-5 quests and just group up to grind on lvl6 mobs, i don't know how long it will take.

No they dont because not even the world record is that fast
---
52 hours a week for sleep? That's cutting into too much WoW time. 7 for hygiene and food prep? pfffff. Shower once a week and order delivery. 27 hours a week for work? Just quit.
---
Its only 12 days lol. You will catch up everyone:DDD Lmao at these posts. I am not a fast leveler, and even if I will start month after release, I am sure I will catch most of the population as I always do. With progressive raiding , there will be a time when u just raidlog or level an alt or farm gold. Not much else to do before next patch hits.
---
and endangering your health since we arent talking strictly about /played

(THANK u nost! - \~ ! |)

Classic is the best time to jump in as a new WoW player, as it doesn't have any abandoned or obsolete mechanics and content like modern WoW has. Everything in the game serves some kind of purpose, meanwhile in modern WoW you are expected to just ignore most of the old stuff in favor of rushing into the new content.
---
but I never said dozens could not log in and thousands could.  Anyway, you know some people could not log in.  You said it in your other comment in this thread.
---
Not just gold. Summons, dedicated dungeon groups, consumable bots, etc. The game releases Monday evening and we have a goal of one tank, one healer, 3 DPS at 60 by Friday morning, giving us ~4 days to gear up for a week one Ragnaros kill.
---
It’s me I’m the Paladin and I am definitely for hire

---
It's not the most popular (there's another one with 20k+) but its the same order.
---
You can sleep 7 hours a night and still make 60 within 6 days.
---
And they're breaking throuuuuugh
---
They are breaking through
---
This is simply false. There will be strong guilds on PVE servers.
---
I miss when wowhead was literally a black page with a search bar and the "Wowhead" text logo.
---
So busy now.
---
I've already explained it more than once.
---
Layers won't help with packed starting zones. Layering is there to prevent ghost realms when the tourists quit. Unless there is zone sharding, launch will be a clown show like on private realms, but without dynamic spawning. So unless they announce sharding being used, the best way to level 1-6 will be grinding mobs.
---
While people are leveling through the 20-50 zones - im going to assume Fadeleaf, Grave Moss and Blindweed will be relatively cheap. Stock up while you can, the prices will increase when Rogues need to make their poisons.
---
I'd say Warrior and then Rogue and Mage. Those three classes are most responsible for getting anything done.
---
That's what someone says who doesn't know shit lol
---
p's get degrees is what i always say
---
People might buy a 60 before they get darnassus rep up
---
The only min max I can understand in terms of racials is for priests since they have a lot more racials to juggle but yeah all races have their uses even if it doesn't translate to dps meters. For example everyone thinks you should go gnome for caster but the extra int only works out about 2 extra dps. Meanwhile being human means you can grind reps quicker and possibly have better gear because of that.
---
Not even a big time sink if you switch to nelf zones for leveling, you should get a lot of rep that way.
---
How so?
---
healers too
---
I would say druid. I'm biased because I rolled one in classic but the hybrid part is really fun when things go bad. Need an add dragged and the off tank died, go bear and taunt. Need someone to do the dirty work for flag carrier, go kite like a boss. Leveling is fun because your damn near impossible to catch and you can always be stealthing nearby waiting for revenge. Jack of all and master of none can be very rewarding if you master the class.
---
Older women with younger boys. In anime.
---
Meh, Molten Core has been cleared without a single healer class. They're nice to have, but basically just along for the ride.
---
Nicenice
---
I'm concerned about it if I'm brutally honest. But unless you're going to go hybrid I think it's massively going to be the case. 
---
Was wanting to go a paladin and just be a good farmer as I was under the impression for some reason pala tanks are great at aoe farming. To my horror that's not the case. So probably a hunter for me 😣
---
The only reason to buy a switch! :)
---
With a name like Elephant Pirate you’d be welcomed here.
---
Why would you play at launch. No journeyman backpacks no gold and full starting zones..
---
Rather wait some time so you can actually enjoy the game and not get mad at those 200 other players that tagged the questmob first.
---
And there will be enough money, were talking about 15k players. Actually hate that already since mount prices will be a joke.
---
Yeah? That's gotta be a record - game isn't even live yet :-O
---
Someone please do this with the classic doom box art...
---
Unfortunate wording
---
Best place is the auction houses at sw/if
---

---
Can't wait to be a druid and Mark of the wild everyone I see!
---
It may be a bigger issue then usual with [battle.net](https://battle.net) ID tbh. I really doubt they'll make it easy to do, but in 2004 it was hard enough to coordinate people on your own faction - think of the price of vent servers. 
---
Nowadays there is probably going to be a public server discord, which will lead to Alliance and Horde conversing in the same rooms.
---
Hes probably talking about pirate servers as though feats done there hold any water.
---
Can someone clarify , the stress test is not available to eu. 
---
However are EU able to play to level 15 after the 3 hours of stress testing?
---
Parry chance is higher in Classic than the private servers when fighting higher level mobs.  This means weapon skill is even more valuable to reduce the parry chance of bosses.
---
It's been live for 15 years, with increased difficulty for raids. Classic is gonna be EZmode.
---
You think that the current version of wow holds a candle to classic? That's cute.
---
I'm not talking about Retail...
---
Due to layers, I don't think it will really die down too much until like 3-7 days after launch
---
Noob question here, what the hell is min maxing?
---
This is what I don't understand : warlocks spend their time complaining about being threat capped but go for a max dps spec instead of MD with sacrificing the imp and getting 20% threat reduction!
---
Basicly people who complain about layering have never been playing in private servers. Also people who complain about layering are usually clueless about the game and just circlejerk the subject all over again in this subreddit.
---
In the end if you choose to watch this video, bare in mind that you will never get those 5 minites back.
---
The console port addon does prove that the game is 100% playable on consoles honestly.
---
There might be less fury warriors in Classic compared to pservers. Pservers were giving raid bosses a 4% parry chance, when in vanilla it was recently reported to have been 14%.
---
It will nerf ur Rogue dps too but you can't switch to another role now can you. Warriors can. So rouge on my fearless undead pal. Unless fury warriors don't care about the nerf. Then yeah..
---
This thread is sad. "Nah, if they are killing boars and I need boars I'd rather watch them die. Stupid competition."
---
Should I tell him ?
---
The mental gymnastics that is required to be this stupid is something to be proud of.
---
Well I mean this was about a zone not just a raid. A very well thought out zone that could easily be expanded on. Since we have this lore already. Plus people wanted a scarlet crusade raid for a long time as they had big impacts in vanilla. So they know what is being talked about here.
---
NICE!
---
"MY farm spot" lol
---
https://youtu.be/v5sjX0tdHHY
---
There you go, works in the beta, I did it during the stress test.
---
I played on private servers - why are you assuming that I wasn’t? I think most people who did play on pvt servers are against layering, because they’ve experienced how much fun it is to go to BRM at 60 and wipe raids, or do world bosses while PvPing against the opposing faction.
---
I'm gonna be honest, i would roll nelf in a heartbeat if they were on horde. Give taurens the nelf racials :O~
---
fortunately for me the local store has no room for FNM  , so they outsourced the organisation to some veteran players (including at least 1 dci judge)  For the past 15 years this has worked fine, we have a weekly draft, some constructed and commander  on Friday in a bar and the audience are mostly between 20 and 45. (we have a few teenagers  as well  and our oldest regular is 60)
---
it's not a typical bar, more like a activity location, they have a bridge club,  a billiards club, poker table, darts boards etc, but also a proper bar so we can play cards and drink a nice belgium beer.
---
^That's the selfish part I was refering to.
---
You know what - I'm not gonna be able to compete with stupid so why don't you explain properly instead of in some sort of vague riddle.
---
Since they're bundling Classic and retail in the same subscription I'm afraid they're going to make you download retail even if you only want to play classic.
---
My connection is not metered but is very slow, so I already downloaded retail just in case.
---
I love pvp, but playing with friends &gt; pvp server. At least for me.
---
Private Servers purposefully made Molten Core and all other raids more difficult.
---
Molten Core has been cleared on Private Servers without a single healer.
---
Did I dumb it down enough for you?
---
It never was for debate :D
---
If it is about min-maxing &amp; class efficiency , the answer is always warrior and mage. Rogue isn’t far behind these.
---
Hi mate father of a 3 year old son and soon a sweet daughter. EU aswell and at the moment gaming time every day can be 8 =)
---
I don’t underestimate shamans, but I think in organized pvp it’s easier to focus and murder a shaman than a paladin. In pug v pug my money’s on horde all day.
---
Normally in Blizzard betas it's a test client separate from the live client. So it's very likely you have to download a release client. My guess is with the name reservation on August 13, you can download the final client.
---
Rogue. Stealth is just too fun
---
Yeah literally the only part of a classic I'm not hyped up for is that I actually really enjoy the new models and textures
---
I'm going to miss them a lot
---
"See someone in trouble? Consider helping out!"
---
"That's ridiculous."
---
Ok
---
I feel like layering is such a top level issue for streamers and hardcore players alike. For me who will only be able yo play 2-3 hours a day I dont really see it as a problem.
---
If ur goal in Classic is being a complete no life and then hanging around Org to peacock ur gear to normies, then Warrior i guess. 
---
If u like how much better your life is compared to everybody else, Hunter.
---
Noooo! You monster!
---
Blizzard is never going to spend a single dime developing content for Classic. They want to convert Classic players over to Retail and will keep Classic players on the milk until then, even if it means releasing TBC (which will be far easier than what they've done to make Vanilla work on the modern engine).
---
There's your answer.
---
&gt; And there's new pserver opening on Saturday which might break all online records.
---
Oooh, which one?
---
I wonder if they're FOTM-rerollers or have never played warrior before. Yes they're mandatory as tanks but they're not fun to level, they rely on gear and only excel at PvP when they have a healer.
---
I can agree with that, but if you’re a casual player you also have to recognize that you won’t be the “driving force” of the server. If you let hardcore players exploit resources through layers, you are going to have a much much harder time getting anything done as a casual.
---
**Epoch of Thought \[H\]** | NA-PvP | Wed, Thur, Sun 1800—2200 PST | Hardcore
---
**TL;DR**:  Hardcore experienced, established guild seeks non-toxic, dedicated, competent raiders for Classic dominance starting with test realm preparation now. Most need Resto Shamans atm.
---
**About**: EoT started on Bloodscalp shortly after vanilla wow’s release &amp; became a top guild on the server. We’ve persisted as a gaming family ever since. Our goal has always been to clear content as a team while providing a second family for our members.  
---
Our leadership is experienced, skilled, and caring.  We've been around since the beginning and we're not quitting until we've farmed Naxx enough to gear everyone :).  We look forward to developing a winning team of people you'd not only want to raid with, but would also like to meet in real life if the chance arose.
---
**Raiding plans**: For classic we will be a top guild &amp; clear Naxxramas. We have a solid core experienced through Naxx. Most of us have raided for years &amp; are ready to devour classic content. We are running two competitive raid teams both lead by experienced leadership and tanked by experienced main tanks.  
---
**Loot System**:  We run a unique/proprietary point-guided loot council (attendance and contributions are measured and accounted for but there is no bidding and the system is designed to be transparent and efficient).  The loot council is focused on awarding gear where it best serves raid progression &amp; best recognizes attendance, &amp; contribution to raid performance.
---
**What we expect**: We expect dedicated, skilled raiders who show up with consumes, proper gear, &amp; knowledge. We expect competence and literacy with computers, google spread sheets, balancing individual schedules, and team communication.  We expect effort during, before, and after raids.  We expect serious practice on a guild hosted test server.  
---
We are team-focused so great performers are appreciated &amp; recognized, but divas who are unconcerned with the health of the entire raid team or overly self-interested are not tolerated. We are a diverse group of raiders worthy of individual respect &amp; the respect of everyone’s time.  Toxicity and drama stirring have no place in our guild.
---
**In short, be prepared, be knowledgeable, be on time, &amp; don’t be an A-hole.**
---
**Why We Will Survive and Thrive**:  We are experienced, dedicated, and prepared.  Our leadership team consists of mature, experienced, and professional leaders.  Our raid core consists of experienced, skilled, and most importantly, dedicated raiders.  
---
We are busy doing all the prep work we need to run a highly organized, reasonably competitive guild.  We are inclusive, non-toxic, and value team building and a rewarding social environment over pyrrhic victories.  We were successful in actual vanilla and have only gotten smarter, wiser, and more organized with age.
---
Most importantly we desire complete decimation of classic content and will not stop until we get there.
---
**Raid Schedule**: Wed, Thur, Sun, 6 PM to 10 PM PST (GMT-8) (9pm – 1 AM EST) hard stops and early nights where possible. Our guild has always been extremely active &amp; 20-mans, Onyxia, etc. will continue to be ran on non-core days. On most days, if you log in, you will find a good group of people to smash content with.
---
**Looking for**: We are seeking a few more Resto Shamans atm, but great people of all classes are strongly encouraged to apply.  Core raid spots are earned through demonstrated competence &amp; dedication. This means that no core spots will be predetermined and certainly not before anyone's hit 60.
---
If you are interested in leadership roles within the guild please send me a whisper &amp; let’s chat.
---
**Current Activity**:  The guild is practicing on our own test server to get the group reoriented to the old content and shaking the rust off.  We use the test raids for providing feedback, polishing raid skills, and determining and bolstering roster weakness.  
---
Currently, a sizeable portion of the guild is practicing leveling runs on pservers while a few are raiding hardcore.  We also have guild jackbox party nights for fun while we wait for classic.
---
**Apply**: The best way to join is to shoot me a private discord message **(Discord: Lne#2710 | Battlenet: Lne#1326)**.  You can also hit up either of my assistant GMs on **discord:  XvK#7740  &amp; AYD#5916**
---
The less social can also fill out an application on our Website [http://epochofthought.shivtr.com](http://epochofthought.shivtr.com)  
---
You can also jump on our discord at [https://discord.gg/UqAVjJT](https://discord.gg/UqAVjJT
---
**Join us!**
---
Was actually a bit meme by the end of Vanilla, we have a lot of pro PvP’ers in our team, nvm they got Naxx gear. Obv you’d still win most of the time, but it took so much longer.
---
Where should I die in Azshara ? I tried by swimming but I always came back in Azshara.
---
It might be different between classic and pserver too.
---
If some people exploit it to get ahead would I really care at all? Im just going to plod along at my own pace and enjoy the experience, couldnt care less about anyone else.
---
i also am pretty convinced that when you die, your world buff disappears, which wasnt the case on Pservers
---
It's not a drop, so you can't really just ninja it.
---
Private server achievements mean absolutely jack buddy... good game.
---
I don't get anything out of it. I'm giving away buffs for nothing. I can't find the selfish part.
---
Except we do know how long they intend to use it.
---
It will be removed by the end of phase one *tops* because it will interfere with the world boss spawns coming in phase 2. Ion also said he expects to remove it well before then, too.
---
Trading BoP items was impossible in Vanilla. Even for 2hrs.
---
It's what you said. Hahahaha.
---
This is the worst trolling ever. Or the best. You've got a lot of replies!
---
Well they said layering will be implemented on release and will be removed once starter zones will not be packed anymore, which propably takes a week or so and then its removed. Its that simple.
---
Also the same people who are crying about layering will propably cry if layering wouldnt exists on launch, since they are unable to tag any mobs and leveling at launch is impossible for those, who dont know how to min/max leveling in 1-10.
---
I mean if you are only planning to level and play the game as a single player RPG then probably not, you wouldn’t care much, but when it comes to getting prebis gear for raids and buying stuff like devilsaur leather, you will be forced to farm a looot of gold, if there is a few people that control that resource.

---
You said you don't do that.
---
So a fake MC on a pirate server got cleared without healers. I'm confused what that has to do with wow classic. Pirate servers data was so far off you'd be better off on retail.
---
Sure, the only version of the game that's been available for the last 12 years and purposefully made end-game content more difficult than it originally was, is irrelevant.
---
Okay, kid.
---
If you read my previous post, my greatest worry is that layering will remain in game past the first few zones or levels. It’s pretty much what staysafe said in his video. There isn’t any guarantee that they will remove the mechanic, after the first week as you claim
---
You may care if layering is used to impact server markets and end up causing you to either potentially lose out on resources or be forced to buy said resources at an inflated rate.
---
The "fake" MC was purposefully made to be more difficult than it was in Vanilla. If it can be done there, it can be done in Classic.
---
I think you’re being pretty selfish in your view that everyone will get to that level as quick. Needs of the many out weigh the needs of the few.
---
I would be on board for allowing a one-time copy of Classic vanilla characters to a Classic TBC or whatever server.
---
Dwarf rogue!
---
Shadowbringers release in 14.
---
I probably wouldn’t even notice
---
Didnt tought about summons... but you guys are some mad mans xD
---
Troll.
---
That's a common misconception among pirate players. They upped the raw numbers because they didn't know how most the mechanics worked. The current understanding is the fights were easier on pirate servers because of the server stats that are just guessed at.
---
Class distribution amongst servers always find a way to balance themselves out, so I wouldn’t worry too much. Warriors if anything are gonna lead the server percentage but I doubt anything too drastic
---
I remember the 2 big problems for rogues in early BC was some mobs/bosses using 360 degree cleave attacks and heroics pretty much requiring lots of CC, so nobody wanted to invite rogues unless they had improved sap. In patch 2.1 the 360 degree cleaves were removed and improved sap became baseline for all rogues.
---
If you love the class, you should play it! Don't let fear of things that may or may not happen affect what class you choose.
---
Do not underestimate Aladdin and Geine
---
?
---
Really? I think I’m being quiet the opposite of selfish, because layering, if exploited, will benefit the few and the many will suffer. Every herb, ore, NPC will be farmed by elite guilds, making them even more powerful than if there was only one world, limiting the resource. Wanna buy fire protection pots for onyxia and ragnaros? Dish out 50g for a stack.  Same goes for mongoose, devilsaur, mana pots, health pots, engineering gadgets etc.
---
No, the current understanding is that you have no fucking idea what you're talking about.
---
Jokes on you im not even an idea
---
&gt;pick what you think looks the best and fuck everything else
---
Wouldn't you want to fuck what looks the best? Kappa
---
The Simpsons on repeat. What am I watching today? The Simpsons on repeat. I have a problem.
---
I wouldn't call shadowmeld "out of combat junk". It's an extremely powerful PvP racial. 
---
The ability to drink and shadowmeld and not have your drink and eat interrupted is absurdly strong in BGs and world pvp.
---
In rogue and druid you can eat, shadowmeld, and then immediately stealth. Which is HUGE because they´re classes that rely a lot on openers. On hunter, as you said: FD drink shadowmeld is quite absurd too.
---
Nelfs look extremely cool and are an amazing race.
---
Are you serious?
---
And puny
---
Furies depend more on auto attacks for rage flow rather than yellow hits. The only instant strike they have is Bloodthirsty and maintaining rage flow for more than that actually should be for cleave which doesn't add threat let use but costs a hell of a lot more, strength is secondary until flurry is certain to be up 100% (30% crit roughly) and Bloodthirst always on CD. Crit is easy to get with consumables, but hit isn't easy to get, so Fury warriors absolutely need the weaponskill and hit% above all.
---
But at the same time, you won't get stuck on res duty. And if your group wipes in a 5-man, you don't have 3 DPS that go afk because "it's the healer's job to res me."
---
If you are in a dungeon:
---
1. Dont loot mid fight
---
2. Dont rush quest items (especially during a fight)
---
3. If you are a miner ask if there is another one, maybe roll or take every other one
---
4. If you see a chest call out for everyone to roll for it, dont rush and open it..
---
If I encounter someone who breaks a few times I just write them off if I see them again
---
Good argument. The part where you jumped straight to insults of instead of supporting your point is my favorite.
---
Tbh, you could grind simple mobs with this...
---
I didn't think it was made up lol, but you didn't write about the part I was most interested in reading
---
IIRC the relics have a 1 min respawn timer as well, gonna take forever at the beginning to get them with a hundred people trying to get it.
---
11$ per hour

---
Oh man, it sucks! I'm close to change jobs for a substantial pay raise too and it will most likely match with Classic Launch too... My heart is broken. But what to do!
---
Oh I agree with you, don't get me wrong, one is clearly more prestigious than the other, and transmog has watered this down, but it still does not change the fact that you can't just aquire a set like Pala T2 Judgement overnight, you do have to commit a considerable amount of time to obtain the gear for the purpose of transmog.
---
This was my initial point, you were talking about investment in the game in your OP, does that not show investment in the game? albeit on a much smaller scale.
---
Returning to classic when it eventually drops will render this a Non-Issue anyway, we'll all go back to looking like shit for 59 levels :)
---
I mean you didn’t support your argument either, just called it bullshit, so...
---
Thanks, guys! You made me realize that I do still love Vanilla and it's more than just rose-colored glasses.  
---
I had a blast on your server!
---
Oh ye :/ that gotta suck.
---
Can bosses parry from behind?
---
Good life. The part where you jumped straight from your mother not being able to afford the abortion to being able to form complete sentences is my favorite.
---
i do aknowledge that fact, but it doesn't mean they should look all fluffy and cute.
---
I'm not. But I also never played Vanilla originally, so for me a lot of it is still new experience and I'm trying to keep it fresh (on servers I only play Alliance).
---
I imagine if you played Vanilla leveling many times it's not that interesting anymore.
---
And engame stuff looks neat yo. Classic endgame is different from endgame in other games.
---
I never understood the desire with private servers, especially when you put it like that.
---
It's like buying a car, and being like hey this cars hella fun to drive but it breaks down all the time... 
---
What fun about a car that breaks down please tell me.
---
News flash, I don't care.
---
Exactly that! And Boomkins aren't viable in vanilla. :(
---
Nope his entire point makes no difference except for the 1 tank. Bosses can’t parry from behind so doesn’t affect rogues or fury wars
---
Warrior if you are a team player.
---
Hunter if high skill ceiling is more important for you than DPS numbers.
---
Warlock if you despise other people. And you will despise them after a few dungeons and especially raids.
---
"It was the misquote of things I never said that I took issue with."
---
"You're right he didn't misquote me. I never accused him of it either."
---
See the first sentence? That's where you accused him of misquoting you.
---
You troll.
---
I don't have it yet. 😣
---
Why tho?
---
Because standing still is boring? Moving around in combat makes it feel more engaging.  Also, if you slow them, you can try to kite them as others have said and make it harder to target you / reach you.
---
If he was going for retail girls then for sure no lol
---
You're efforts are really appreciated! Hunter MVP
---
Tauren with shadowmeld would take the tauren rogue meme to the next level.
---
23k is 11 per hour granted they work 40 hours a week and no overtime. I would hope they aren't making 23k a year on overtime.
---
But like I said earlier thats the top 5% of the hardcore playerbase! Wht about all the noobies questing early days in hugely populated starting zones? You have tunnel vision of what is going to effect you my friend
---
Gonna wait to see my bosses face when I hit r12.5 and tell him i gonna take a month off for r14
---
Yep!
---
Dear returning warlocks and shadowpriests, just remember common etiquette
---
If youre in a dungeon, dont dot the enemy with this quite big visible moon over himself.
---
Thank you
---
The rest of the group.
---
No, wanna duel is : "Jump in circle around the guy"
---
And the last one should be "Jump jump jump then throw a dagger"
---
Because that's just want some people are playing the game for? I couldn't care less about levelling, want it out of the way because it's boring and tedious and I'd rather get to cap and do content that sticks.
---
Some people like levelling, some people don't. When I played Destiny 2, all I wanted was to get to max level and start the real grind. When I played Anthem I just rushed through the story then levelled nice and quickly after that so that I could start grinding strongholds. At the start of BfA I had 4 characters geared past 340 and neck levels up to scratch before Uldir even opened. When classic starts I'm gonna get a nice levelling guide open, then just grind away until cap. Couldn't care less about who's in the zone, or who's doing battlegrounds or fighting at southshore. Just wanna get 60 and start prebis
---
You do dungeons once for quests if you care for exp/hour
---
Had no idea, googled it, and turns out mobs can't.
---
So parry buff has zero impact on melee dps, it will just screw with the tank.
---
Still, rouge on my slightly fearful undead pal.
---
They are going to be overpopulated, especially in PvP realms so please don’t play them.
---
t. Totally not a future Warlock/Priest player
---
Thanks, I used Photoshop.

Cool!

Welcome to the club
---
if you are using rank 1 frostbolt for the slow, you are throwing away mana (not as relevant later since rank 1 is cheap) and time(very relevant). To keep your target permanently slowed you'd be weaving frostbolt between each fireball cast.
---
Frost Nova means you have to reposition yourself (costs time, may not be that practical depending on situation), CoC is a mana dump with the same problem as frost nova.
---
Not to mention you probably will specc into frostbite for even more cc (and damage thanks to shatter).
---
If you go for deepfrost you even get to enjoy Ice Barrier for a mana efficient shield that prevents interruptions.
---
As for single target damage "advantage" of fire: For most of leveling, this is negated by the much slower cast time, lack of spelldamage gear and the occasional resist (versus partial resist for frost).
---
It is however a very fun way to play with those big numbers.
---
Another fun way would be frostfire speccs combining the advantages of both speccs (though may not be as mana efficient, haven't checked that yet though).
---
Dude, I have no problem with layering in the starting zones. I’m talking about Blizz possibly keeping layering beyond that. Even new players or slower levelers will at some point have to buy stuff from the auction house if they wanna begin raiding. If most of the resources on the AH are controlled by few peeps, they will drive up the prices so high that you will be grinding consumables at naxx level time investment even in phase 1 when it’s literally just Mc and onyxia
---
Dating a Mage or Rogue? Sure. But dating a Warlock? Hell to the fucking no. Second rate scrubs aren't worth spreading your legs for.
---
I would hope that isn't 40 hours a week. Could also be talking either before or after taxes here, most likely after. But if I hear 23k/year, I assume he's working part time, at least not 100%, so the hourly rate could be higher. I make at least that per year as a student who's working part time :/ just this summer I'll have 12k from 2 months.
---
&gt; but they're not fun to level
---
What absolutely bullshit. Warriors are fun to level. Just because it's a tad harder than most other classes, doesn't mean it's not fun. It's a challenge. They rely just as much on gear as every other class.
---
So I have to respec every time I wanna AoE farm and every time I wanna raid?
---
Relative time committed doesn't really mean a whole lot though, compared to actual time committed. If I was a dad gamer playing 75% of my 16 hours of free time a week, that's not hardcore, even though its the majority of my free time.
---
 Shadowmeld  and hunter class is my favorite combo for world pvp and flag / base defense . 
---
but due to gnomes , fuck it ! orc it is ! 
---
KOS gnome gang
---
I really dread seeing an army of dwarf priests this time around for this stupid racial, but I guess a lot of people are trying to min/max which will be sad to see.
---
Cool 😎
---
Lol at all those people talking about how the internet and the accessibility of information will irrevocably change the vanilla experience, when blizzard is just going to fix that by banning all programs including web browsers.
---
Start your own group, reserve the items you need, problem solved.
---
Dont know dreadforge retaliator...
---
Considering the average gamer spends ~7 hours a week online. I would definitely consider ~12 hours a week “hardcore”.
---
THanks (:
---
That’s the sexiest bust I’ve ever seen!! I bet the creator is also super sexy. ;)
---
Lol I've been wondering aswell for past few weeks
---
45 in 3+ days played is easily doable.
---
Hardcore players can still be slow levellers though. I day raided 6 days in the first week of BoD at 6-8 hours a day and did dungeons in the downtime before/after and god knows even with a levelling guide I probably won't be that fast and I will be playing pretty much non stop on release.
---
'quite difficult' patchwork impossible and ravizous and faerlina would be literally impossible without priests
---
Will affect threat generation
---
The same amount of resources will still enter the game? If someone hops layer to get another black lotus means that someone on that layer will miss out but the exact same amount of resources will exist in total, because it's not like no one would pick that black lotus on the other layer.
---
Sure it might funnel some extra gold for the spazzes in guilds early on but hardly enough to have an impact. Some people seem to say that they should have it like private servers without layers, but PS had dynamic respawns on resources, so this is just a better of two evils.
---
/r/classicwowplus
---
I'm aware they are as old/older, but I wrote "dominant" for a reason - Trolls didn't have many routes to seriously influence the world, with their civilization being on the fringe of existence. And the period when they were on the top is not well-documented, so we can't really judge them comparatively to the Night Elves.
---
~ 14 hours a day for 5 days gimped by the notion that there’s 3 of you? Yeah, you’re not reaching level 40 in that time.
---
I know what Arena Junkies, Skill Capped and AT were. I'm just trying to constructively argue and get downvoted at this point. If you'd be so nice and provide any evidence about humans dominating arena in LK because of their racials instead of mocking me, it would be nice, because I did provide some on the contrary. 
---
Also I find it quite ironical that somebody goes around questioning my PvP knowledge and talking about "US-Tichondrius" after we mentionned "EU-Cyclone" earlier in the discussion ... While apparently not realising that EU-Cyclone is a ***battlegroup***, while US-Tichondrius is a ***server***. And indeed when talking about Arena PvP ladders past BC only battlegroups are relevant, not servers. Hydra played on EU-Stormscale iirc, which was in the most competitive EU battlegroup, EU-Cyclone, also know as Battlegroup 3. Tichondrius was in Bloodlust I believe.
---
There are hundreds of high end arenas from LK times, surely there's one where this Human over-representation you guys are talking about appears, is there not ? I'd actually happily watch that, I'm quite fond of PvP videos. I'm waiting for the link.
---
Meanwhile NCSoft did a classic relaunch of Lineage 2 with a massive success years ago and everyone thinks a single private server with inflated fake online player count is to thank. Everything blizz is doing on classic is copy paste of what ncsoft did( QoL UI changes, releasing content with phases, sub model even though retail was f2p). 
---
Get real, private servers have been a thing since forever.
---
Even Vanilla may be different from server to server or region, idk. It was not a thing in my world even up to AQ40 and Naxx. Ony head buff for farming day? Of course when it was not on CD. But no insane stacking of 5 World buffs.
---
My mates are already working on compiling a set of rules from the beta that allow them to dictate when they move between layers and to where. 
---
If it's going to be in the game then it's going to be exploited, so their logic is they might as well get rich off it too, i'm just hoping it's gone by the time i hit 40+ or i'll wind up sacrificing leveling speed to make bank on BL if we figure out how it works from the beta.
---
Did it last week on a pserver and it still look over 45 mins for the whole party to get the relics, even with the increased spawn rate. Fuck that quest.
---
If wpvp means 99% being ganked by lvl 60s while lvling and 1% fair 1v1 that grow into fights between 20 players around the same level range.. Hell ill do it. Rather die a hundred times than to never have lived before.
---
The Night Elves are the scum peasants that the Blood Elves left to their own devices. that we do know.
---
Hahaha, my sentiments exactly!
---
But raid instances generally tend to be more interesting than a levelling quest. I killed the last boss of a raid 150+ times doing sales and it never really got old even with downtime between, and I'd do it again in a heartbeat, but I'd be damned having to level from 1-30 again
---
Yes I've also read/heard what they've said regarding end of phase one and before the world boss spawns. Do you mind sharing with me how long phase one will be? Because that was my entire point. 
---
And if we don't know when "end of phase 1" is, we can't possibly know when "well before then" is either, which again, was my entire point.   
---
But FWIW I'm still pro-layering.
---
The cache files are just that, cache files, they'll get overwritten as soon as you enter the game.
---
0/30/21 for a drood and you can do all 3 roles
---
On private servers.
---
Only good for punting
---
A lot of twinks will say it's just because they enjoy getting an easier BiS or have fun playing characters at that level.     
---
In truth though they just enjoy 1-shotting new and undergeared players, when retail made it so Twinks only faced other Twinks in BG's it died within about a week in all brackets for BG's, these types of players are a lot less interested in the even playing field.
---
Mining engineering as holy paladin.
---
Yes, on Private Servers.
---
Which have worse named mob respawns, worse quest item respawns. no layering, and more difficult to defeat mobs.
---
It will be interesting only until they go public and start streaming, making videos on own youtube channel.
---
But not him. If you actually read I'm not talking about his post. Can you show in that quote where I named him or even hinted he was who misquoted me. Geepers.
---
It's funny because it's true.
---
What's the difference with the cast animations? They look more or less the same to me. It's the running animations that changed a lot for most races.
---
I have a Nostalrius T-Shirt with this logo and text!
---
With what I said you could take priests for dps, so you can MC fine. I duno why patchwerk would be impossible?
---
Reminds me of being yelled at for AI while i'm spamming conjure water / food for everyone in the team.
---
I actually explained why pirate servers were off and how upping numbers doesn't mean increased difficulty for that reason.
---
How about we only answer to questions we have a clue about.
---
Disregard women, acquire Soul Shards.
---
Keep digging.
---
He's not wrong though, even LFR nowadays makes vanilla raids look simple. Raids in classic will mostly be a formality, they will get absolutely rolled by anybody with a pulse
---
They wont instakill them in Classic is what i believe
---
Weapon skill has been confirmed to massively influence hitchance when fighting against enemies that are 3 level higher.
---
Basically you only need about 6% hit instead of 9% if you have 5 weapon skill more.
---
Its ridiculous.
---
Warlock. Bulky Genie, the friend of yours, can grant you three wishes.
---
&gt; Al Swearengen said it best, "The world ends when you're dead. Until  then, you got more punishment in store. Stand it like a man ~~(or woman)~~,  and give some back"

Exactly.

I don't want to change your mind, cause I agree.
---
Nano, we fu..ing love you!
---
"I do only buff people that buff. I said that."
---
Lol
---
Ofc hes talking about pve rotation what are you on about
---
The problem with this is that it can impact people that just want to play with their friend.  It could be fixed by just making it so you can't mine or see a node that you just tapped.  This could still be abused because you would still might have node spawns that weren't available in your original layer but even then at least there's a chance someone can beat you to it.
---
If you want both of these options, then mage.
---
Only 9 days til 60 and that's only a month til a month is left and a month is only 4 weeks and 1 week is 7 days so it's just 7x4 and BLIZZ PLS I NEED IT NOW Q.Q
---
The centaurs in desolace are both pretty worthless reputations as far as I know. You would probably be better off going for mobs that give you a good amount of gold, most reps in WoW Classic are not tied to killing non-dungeon/raid mobs as far as I recall.
---
Wep skil doesnt reduce parry chance, and bosses cant even parry from behind. It does give increased dmg from glancing blows, and it gives more hit chance than on most private servers.
---
Feral Druid. People think they are bad but can’t tell u why
---
0 feral druids 0 enhancement shamans max 3 hunters to 40m
---
You aso want clearcast for AoE farming: Spaming Rank 1 Arcane Explosion -&gt; clearcast proc -&gt; Blizzard
---
Seriously though, where do these droolers come from? My friend rolled a new character and spent the day angry, losing 90% of games and spam messaging me. He's got empty gear slots and grays in the 19 bracket and topping damage and objectives with heirloom/blue gear teammates that fold like wet paper and couldnt kill someone in pvp if their real life depended on it. Do people queue for exp? Masochists that enjoy being killed? When you're so mind boggling bad at pvp, why queue?

---
I mean if it’s in game even after the first week or two it would be stupid not to exploit it. Sadly it will be at the cost of newer or less experienced players.
---
i'm pretty sure he was trying to assume you weren't as much of a dick as you came off as in the post.. just chill man.
---
You get a bop healing robe from tailoring
---
Don’t even bother with people whose main personality trait is their sexual orientation.
---
well if you want to play with your friend, invite him, jump layer, trigger cooldown (should be like 2 mins) play with him after the cooldown everything is normal
---
Damn that's a LOT of fucking dungeons.
---
Troll or Retarded, either way i'm laughing.
---
Ublock origin blocks everything on chrome
---
“Tiny weapon bonus.” 😂😂😂 Just prepare for all the /laugh and /spit when people have seen you’ve rolled Night Elf... Rogue...
---
Being extremely strong at one thing, usually at the cost of being extremely weak at other things.
---
Hahaha people here are so threatened. God forbid he achieved stuff on the harder private servers than the undertuned classic wow.
---
are node respawns not longer than 2 mins?
---
The only other ones I can really think of, are The Argent Dawn in the Plague lands &amp; Scholo, and also the Steamwheedle Cartel, grinding the pirates in Tanaris.
---
&gt;I think PvP brings out the absolute ~~worst~~ **truth** in people
---
When people are free to do whatever they want without consequences, you see their true colors.
---
You see this IRL when there's a natural disaster : you have looters but people that help each others too.
---
Generally speaking, guilds will have raids on 2-3 consecutive days each week so that members can spend the rest of the week in whatever spec they'd like. PvP frost spec can be tweaked with more placed in the aoe slow in order to better facilitate farming, pvp, and general world content.
---
It means optimizing your character to the max, and/or minimizing downsides.
---
This is a quality troll.
---
Except people did?
---
It depends when you live really.
---
Even if you do all the NE quests at the appropriate levels, you’ll still be over 15k reputation short (less for Humans). That means over 300 stacks of Runecloth for exalted. 
---
Private server rep gains are inflated as fuck compared to classic. People aren’t going to get near exalted by 40.
---
I'd totally buy that
---
Not in my Vanilla experience.
---
What is DKP??
---
This is classic wow, folk are happy to help others by crafting things as they get free skill ups.  as long as you supply the mats. 
---
a solo player will do better with gathering profs, to get a better gold supply. 
---
Its not rocket science.
---
Comparing RS to wow is ludicris.
---
Yup, op wins this argument, hes hit the nail on the head. Twinks came about just because they want to dominate non twinks.
---
depends of the level, i think copper is really fast and get slower as it get higher level.
---
You could try use layer jump to find new spawns, but with the long cooldown it triggers it would be much faster to look for new  ones. I do think this would fix it
---
Thats the very definition of being selfish. Sharing your buffs shouldnt come with a conditional. Especially since it barely costs you a thing.
---
how immature
---
That sounds like added frustration to an already controversial system. It's easier to just tolerate layering for the 4-8 weeks it's in the game.
---
i know
---
rp pvp was always my first my choice, people are great there
---
No king rules forever.
---
I like to add: It's a bit like rouges scaling unintend on spellpower. If the strongest rogue is a caster that's obviously a exploit and should be reverted even though it was this way in Vanilla, just not seen by people. (Just an example, I know it is not quit that strong. Just for thinking purpose)
---
what patch is this? i didn't think we ever had those hero boards
---
Ty
---
Why, if you playing solo or with your friends you do not jump, this would not affect ppl not looking to abuse, if you are mining then you are not inviting random ppl and disband after 10 secs over and over...
---
I'd say Healers, and pick any one. They are all needed to do PVP and PVE. An average or bad tank will be able to clear instances if the healer is good. Same with PVP, you could be the best geared and best player, but if others have a healer, you'll soon die.  
---
My main was a hunter back in Vanilla, and I raided hardcore till Cata came out, I also got to Rank 12 before tBC. But the most fun &amp; rewarding class I played was a shammy healer in BGs. I loved it so much that I have decided to roll a shammy (resto from 55), and be a healer as my main come Classic release.
---
Except you simply do not need a shaman to be enhancement to twist imp wf and imp grace of air.

Here's the problem with playing Alliance... There's a fat 15 year old who lives inside of me and all he does is listen to Slipknot (credit: Brian Posehn). I just can't get invested in a character who is a "good guy". Also, all the Alliance environments really bore me. Humans and castles and all that are cool, but it's really boring compared to a place like Org imo. There was no way my edgelord 15 year old self wasn't going to play an Undead Warlock when I realized he could headbang and summon demons.
---
I made enough on pserver to buy my mount in 3 days after 60 (also had to buy BV set) - I ended up dropping Herbs / Mining and found an open world farming technique that makes me more GPH (RNGish) then DME Lasher runs.
---
I just put in a level 19 mage as I guess I was just reading the twink comments before this and wanted to look. There are some interesting choices the auto-fill includes, like adding Shadowfang as the weapon (on a mage?) and Corsair's Overshirt over Tree Bark Jacket, as well as not putting in the fishing and arena items etc etc. Probably really minor, but I wonder how your autofill is deciding what is best and what isn't?
---
Amazing website though I think I'll be using this a lot.
---
as I will prolly main a Prot Warri I am pretty sure to level an alt rogue to farm/pvp/gank/farm/farm and farm
---
First two weeks I’d agree, but to say that the AH will be useless for two months is wrong. After two weeks you’ll already have people at 60 farming devilsaur etc and using the AH to sell it.
---
Yes, you could easily hit level 40+. If the 3 of you know what you are doing, you could easily do the 5 man instances with just the 3 of you. Good XP as there is less in the group, and no need to fight for mobs with all the other questers.

When TBC came out, LVL 60 twinks in AV with High warlord gear(cost honor) was awesome :D
---
Why is this is classic wow?
---
I’m ok with Mobile WoW as long as you aren’t able to enter Dungeons, Battlegrounds or Raids while using the mobile client.
---
I mean, there's a limit to how good you can be at auto attacking.
---
Elite = yellow/gold
---
Rare = grey
---
What the hell is Rare elite (yes played since vanilla -&gt;MOP). Or how does it look and was it in original wow?
---
Hits close to home. Can't decide between warrior and rogue. Or maybe warlock, or mage. Or priest 🙄
---
FYI achievements were introduced in 3.0.2 (October 2008), and battleground xp and xp locking weren't introduced until 3.2.0 (August 2009)
---
I think the difference is pretty close tbh. Go up against an endgame rogue or mage and youll literally get one shotted.
---
At least with twinks their is a ceiling that is easily reachable as long as you spend time farming dungeons+enchants. With tier 3 + gear most people do not have the time or dedication to get that far
---
most of the older models look better than the new ones. The new ones sway too much while walking and the animations are too over exaggerated and they generally look like disney characters.
---
since i wanna go fast, spending the required time on one, let alone two gathering professions to be in any way useful in levelup isnt worth it. If the new meta is to just run instances like after or bit under L20, you gotta factor that in to the professions too.
---
Obvious one being tailoring and enchanting. For horde skinning and leatherworking is nice in WC. 
---
Im just saying what i think is best for the way IM going to play it. I could get everything done by a guildie, trying to optimize gold, xp pace, bag space in my 2 or 3 man group.
---
Like fun
---
why do you want me to click a video, with fucking ASSmongold ?  
---
thx, but no thx
---
Playing the way you get the best results, so if you are going to be a DPS warrior you pick human for the weapon skill bonus and you calculate which pieces of gear will make you perform best.
---
I'm looking forward to the journey and won't be speed leveling. I don't get that either, that isn't what vanilla was all about for me.
---
However eventually you will get there and I can understand that people want to make sure, that they don't get stuck at that point. You can't easily just level an alt if you can't find a raid and I guess a lot of people want to see the later content this time around when they didn't get the chance back in vanilla.
---
Plus there is that vocal minority (I think) of competetive players that want to "win the game" as fast as possible.
---
Athene used to race to world first and win most if the time with his army ready to carry him. I dknt think he was ever the best in the world though, I used to raid with nihilium in TBC and I think "Awake" was possibly the best paladin to have ever lived back in the day. That guy was an exceptional paladin.
---
Whether or not the idea is a viable solution aside, the community response from this would likely be just as controversial as layering itself is. 
---
It's a lot of trouble over a feature which won't even be around for 1% Classic's projected lifespan.
---
lol GL with that in a 15year old game. Great succes.
---
Arcane missiles, hands down. The old one sounded so cool and has a much more unique and cool animation. Also chain heal.
---
I dislike a lot of other animations but most of those are for spells that weren't in classic, like chaos bolt.
---
I have seen a druid only onyxia kill and a priest only onyxia kill.
---
F R E S H
---
He was rank 1 in 2v2 3v3 and 5v5 at the same time.. though im not sure how long he held said positions at the same time.
---
It’s not as much focused on getting the actual items, it’s more making sure that no one else gets (large quantities) of those items so that the mafia can control the supply=&gt;artificially inflate price. 
---
The lotus mafia will be the real issue considering how the blizzlike spawns for lotuses are. With layer hopping and BoE lotuses on launch(unlike vanilla) it will be very easy for a dozen or two dozen people to control the entire lotus supply on a server with ~3 layers.
---
Essentially tryharding. It’s playing the game in the most efficient or best way possible. Instead of naturally playing the game and having fun experiencing the world you look everything up on the internet and follow what is commonly accepted as the best/most efficient.  So you will only level in the fastest zones and only farm the “BiS” gear. In this world everyone would be the same race/class combos and everyone would have the same professions and the same gear. Sounds totally unfun to me but apparently some people can only enjoy themselves if they feel like they’re the best at something, even if it means playing a race they normally wouldn’t just because it gives them .005% of an advantage in certain situations.  
---
This post references night elves as having the weakest racials statistically speaking compared to humans/gnomes/dwarves. So in the world of min/maxers there would be no night elves at all.  
---
It’s something I’m a little worried about nowadays when you can find any info you want on the internet compared to back in Vanilla when we were all just kids having fun exploring this awesome world and night elves were easily the most popular alliance race.
---
47 hours lmao. 27 hours will be quite nice tho.
---
Shadowmeld can't be used in combat, so that 10 sec CD is less relevant. You must either drop combat or use FD (in which case you are limited by the FD cd and staying still after)

Not a big fan of the guy, but I'm guessing he's probably pretty good being R1 Merciless Gladiator back in the day, and multiglad following that.

5 days after launch there already a tun a 60 hunters farming everything "farmeble" and after the 2-3 weeks the HA would be totaly dominated by this guys
---
shadowmeld + MC is cool.
---
Humans have great racial. Perception is very good in PvP.
---
From what I read everyone is going dwarf priest, so you dont have to. Go what you think is cool
---
Hey can you give me a link of the spreadsheet? I cant open your link... :(
---
Pala will be oom, druid will get crit and crushed. On our latest attempts our druid took double the DMG of our warriors.
---
Don't forget stoneform.
---
Same here but there no Dwarf Night Elf.
---
Yea but, but, I love them so they're the best at everything and everything comes from them! WoW classic, first MMO!
---
Prob. his old char in current wow
---
Jesus are you always this dumb?
---
If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck...
---
I'm on the name picking stage right now. I can tell you right now that once you've picked your class and faction, you're like 10% there...
---
Agreed. True vanilla had night elves everywhere because they were badass looking, but this time around it’s going to be tryhards everywhere :/
---
I don't know if you played vanilla but i did, and there was a ton of Chinese farmers selling everything for euros/dollars. This will happen again i am sure.
---
Or maybe paladin 😅
---
That's nothing special. It's just a regular jump and running over some heavily sloped surface, but it's not wall walking/jumping.
---
Twinks are an easier barrier to entry though, I think that's where a lot of the enthusiasm comes from. Pretty much anyone can deck out a twink, but not everyone could raid the hardest dungeons and gear out.
---
Yes, but I'm not convinced they love WoW as much as I do. I expect them to quit after couple months. But I may be wrong. That is why this decision is hard. But I may start over on a PvP server when they quit.
---
That's just for alliance though?
---
Yesh back in retail vanilla i was getting blown up...always by the guys with the shiny weapons...did some research....ohhh thats what they are. So i became one
---
They use donations
---
There's a few items you can make as a blacksmith for paladins, but most take engineering for added damage, utility and a range pull. All the things youd ever want crafted gear wise are all boe so you can just buy em.
---
Perception is pretty good for unstealthing rogues and druids defending bases
---
Do they hate streamers though? I frequently see video clips of them simply dueling them, or even helping them.
---
Maybe. But in games like for example X-Wing-Alliance they use an ingenious way to overcome our shortcomings in 3d-navigation with 2 "radars" for front and back that help pinpointing the exact direction of an object and having distance encoded in color where brighter colors mean closer and darker means further away.
---
As far as I know the WoW-engine's flying does not allow for doing a looping, which in my book does indeed feel like an immersion-breaking limitation of the engine. But I haven't played since several add-ons.
---
I would love to play it on console. That would be ultimate chill game.
---
Can you add support for the randomly enchanted items like X of frozen wrath?
---
No one messes with the gang.
---
[For now.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-chrome-could-soon-kill-off-most-ad-blocker-extensions/) Google is making changes to the API that could kill most ad blockers.
---
Man please. First of all, Go and clear that naxx, then talk about Classic+. Thx. and no you wont clear naxx.
---
They are more reliant on gear than other classes although i agree that they are fun and not too hard to lvl
---
self·ish
---
/ˈselfiSH/
---
 Learn to pronounce
---
adjective
---
(of a person, action, or motive) lacking consideration for others; concerned chiefly with one's own personal profit or pleasure.
---
I'm not profiting at all from giving away free buffs with no expected return. Not sure the selfish part fits.
---
Chain lightning, pre-7.3 arcane missiles, racial totems. If they could make those priest buffs like inner fire have the appearance of chakras that'd be really cool too.
---
I also really like pre-8.0 chaos bolt and incinerate and quite a few others, but those spells weren't in classic.
---
There aren't a million procs and random shit in the game so it's very clear what talent/spell does what, no need for sims in Classic at all.
---
Lots of Videos on youtube.
---
If there are only a finite number of layers, and each layer is already being farmed, doesn't that problem address itself? 
---
Not to mention any advantage they could potentially gain would ultimately taper regardless.
---
The guy is kind of an exceptional human being tbh. Dont know if anyone has visited his YouTube channel latley but hes a millionaire now.
---
It's all good because twinks eliminate the choice for them.
---
idk man
---
I don't like ganking. I usually wait for the enemy to finish the mob before I jump on him. Unless it's a revenge...
---
I love city assaults though, faction war, fair fights, glory, this kinds of stuff.
---
Only 60% one is free, the dreadsteed is in dire maul, which is in phase 2.
---
Pretty much agree. While i'd rather it not be in the game at all in its current iteration, flying CAN be a fun mini-game if specifically designed around and heavily restricted imo.  I certainly don't want flying everywhere.
---
I'm not sure exactly what that content would be and those suggestions sound pretty interesting, especially the fatigue one. I can imagine a highly vertical zone, something like storm peaks, or a zone with a bunch of floating islands, ala shadowmoon valley netherwing, where you only use short bursts of flying to hop between places, otherwise you get fatigue and fall off.
---
You could also play around with flying mini-games like racing and flying duels, as someone mentioned in this thread already.
---
&gt;I'm not gonna be able to compete with stupid 
---
You're blowing the competition out of the water
---
some quests are race specific, like in tauren starting zone you cant take poison water as troll
---
That's true, but possibly there are hidden gems in spec comp.
---
This is so not true. Private servers have dynamic respawn. And even johanna said that in the beta leveling was slower than on private servers because quest items dropped less. Im sure you are aware of the zhevra hoof memes, that doesnt happen on private servers. Elite mobs are more difficult indeed tho
---
Just tell me how you want to use all that spells and abilities.
---
Not funny, but obviously carefully planned by blizzard to maximize their sub counts.
---
If they close servers after Naxx I'll quit Blizzard for good.  The whole draw for me is to be able to play the game to Naxx without the stress of TBC looming around the corner.
---
Sure I am buddy, and you sound like one of those people that downvotes anything they don't like hearing regardless of contribution to discussion.
---
Ah the pretentiousness of this comment. Early WoW was basically a bunch of kids.
---
3 of the 5 dps classes (warrior rogue mage hunter and lock) are going to be over populated. But theres raid slots for double or more of them compared to the last 2; hunters and warlocks
---
He's not wrong, you're a fool
---
**If you think you're going to be triggered by any of the following *recurring themes*, PVP probably isn't for you:**  
---
* Being killed while fighting a mob  
---
* Being killed by a much higher level player
---
* Being corpse camped  
---
* Being killed by a group when you're alone (Xv1)  
---
* Having to fight off the other faction while attempting to kill a world boss  
---
* Losing all of your PVE buffs to a group who hunted you down specifically to remove them  
---
* etc.
---
Your thinking of the wrong post. I'm talking about giving away buffs to players. That's altruistic at best.
---
Which is exactly why I hope blizzard will go for a relaxed release schedule of those phases. No clear it on day one or fall behind bullshit. Give the average player enough time to farm those raids a while before moving on.
---
Yeah sure gold goblins is , maybe copper goblins ? Or maybe just stick to the 'just my two copper ' ?
---
They can be though you'll need some pots maybe. But for dungeons you can make a lot of gold during pre raid time when people farm pre raid bis.
---
They did, the second screenshot is of they're classic theme. You have to register to use it, though, which is BS.
---
Either a duck or something imitating a duck. There are some great actors that would kill a role as a duck.
---
There is so much hypothetical stuff that he is "guaranteeing". The only concern I actually see is the resource hopping, and that will only be a concern if layers stick around for more than a few weeks.
---
Fact is, layering is just to allow for players to distribute around the world. It's gonna be a slight annoyance at worst, completely unnoticed at best.
---
Hey! They joined on ICC patch!
---
Do you mean Revive Pet?
---
I'll wont be happy after one of these above events happen to me.  
---
Still going to play on a PVP server tho
---
If you can make friends during leveling as a rogue you can probably group up with them to do dungeons. You just need to make the right connections and you won't have to hastle in general chat asking for dungeon run as a rogue.
---
Stop trying to fix a system you don't understand
---
Love you Nost, you let me enjoy MMO's for the first time in years, you created a brilliant community, and no private server has scratched the itch since. Still miss my warrior, sleep sweet princess Redblade :.(
---
I don’t know you, you may be the best enhancement shaman that ever roamed. I have anecdotal experience. My best friend was an enhancement shaman through cata. He didn’t care what people thought. He was never at the bottom of dps charts. I believe it’s more about your personality and willingness to help others that matters. In the end it is just a game. Have fun my man. I know this doesn’t apply to classic but in BC we ran 2v2 arena. Mage and Shammy and got Gladiator title. It took a long time but we had fun. Obviously there were easier ways but who cares.
---
If you flag yourself for pvp on a pve server are you seen as a murderer? Do you become target no. 1 and taunt ppl just being flagged?
---
you compare completely different expansions with a different magnitudes. Everyone knew BfA will be shit, basically a cheap ass Legion. Whereas Cataclysm was o complete revamp of Azeroth/Classes/Quests etc. No shit Cataclysm is higher in revenue, everyone and their moms re-subbed to check out changes
---
I'm honestly the worst at PVP. When I leveled my druid on Northdale, I died every single time I was attacked because I'm horribad.  
---
Still had so much fun, I'll never play PVE servers.
---
&gt;I vaguely remember him referring to himself as the best paladin in the world.
---
Well, did he say it seriously or was it like Asmongold saying he's "the literal god of tanking"?
---
I mostly play healers, so I get gear to be stronger in a dungeon or raid but 90% as bad as I was when I just dinged 60 out in the world.
---
This.
---
Definitely one of the best memers in the world.
---
How can classic wow be undertuned? It’s literally the original.
---
I can't even get through it once, oof
---
Play a paladin only two spells buff and flash of light
---
I'm honestly the worst at PVP. When I leveled my druid on *&lt;unspeakable popular private server&gt;*, I died every single time I was attacked because I'm horribad. I got corpse camped by the mafia in Un'goro when I was trying to quest there and had to GY res and hearth.
---
&gt;With rogues being a dime a dozen, is anyone else afraid of finding groups for dungeons, raids, and pvp premades? 
---
Just go 5 DPS mode. You don't need a tank or a healer if everything dies instantly, right?
---
99% sure i'm going horde so that's one less class to worry about wanting to play 👍
---
.. unless I want to go alliance, maybe?
---
Warrior is way more busy than auto attack andy
---
Why would a warrior join a group where a rogue is reserving items that they might need? 
---
I've levelled both warrior and rogue on high population private servers and I would never go back to rogue because of how hard it was to gear up. The freedom of making your own groups with the composition you want makes your fury prebis so much easier than rogue prebis. I'm not saying it's impossible but /u/Magnon has a valid concern. Best advice is to befriend any warrior you can while levelling.
---
With that kindof outlook, you'll have a tough time in classic, where you are expected to be a teamplayer and help others even when no return is to be expected.
---
Is it not selfish to only buff players who can then help yourself in return? Cause that sounds pretty damn selfish to me.
---
&gt; There isn’t any guarantee that they will remove the mechanic, after the first week as you claim 
---
Except for Blizz saying they plan to remove it after a few weeks...
---
You say that. Then all of a sudden you see a 10k shadowbolt crit and some unholy force spreads them faster than warm butter
---
It'll take at least three times longer, right?
---
If they block add-ons it should be a blacklist and not a whitelist. I'm not giving up the ability to make my own custom stuff.
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xIw7HPEpe5fUSV0mIVzgkdtGxHxqYc4mcVtn26ThS68/
---
Although it's just results, I've never seen anyone actually filter them and put them in graphs.
---
Or me, server: PvP, PvE, RP?
---
But I'm not getting buffs. I'm not asking or even expecting buffs. None of it benefits me at all. Just doing good works and hoping the good karma comes back.
---
It was to minimalize chat in the main raid channel during a run basically.
---
As vanilla had 40 ppl it was common to create channels for priests, warlocks etc. to handle all the communication about who buffs, assign a healer to a specific tank or which lock soulstoned the maintank etc.
---
Having a class leader was basically just the guy calling this stuff in the respective channels.
---
Normally a class leader in vanilla would also be the one reviewing and accepting applications for that specific class to the guild (if there was a need for more ppl)
---
Honestly that would give me a whole other class than I actually want to play.
---
When I imagine suddenly being in an MMO world it is pretty clear to me which class I would want to be. But I wouldn't say it's the best class to protect a normal human without any powers himself.
---
It worked really well for me during classics first run. I can't imagine I'll be hurt by helping people this time.
---
I don't understand. If that is all you get from the game, why even play classic? There aren't that many raids and most of them are not that interesting if you've done them before. Just for raiding, I wouldn't look twice at vanilla wow but check out the current game. At least you get new content every other patch.
---
For me, the draw to classic is the world and player base formed by that world. The stuff that got removed bit by bit with every expansion/patch afterwards.
---
Can you show me where they said they will remove it? I might have missed it.
---
He was holy ;o
---
That wasnt really my choice, 
---
As i said its more so what people want to play. A lot of our old healers want to play priests because of Shadow in PvP and priest being pretty dominate in PvE healing for horde.
---
I found one who still owns me 12g. I won't forget!
---
You did good on it. It's a nice tribute piece. If you do more with it make sure to share your progress
---
First off, you're making the false assumption that all warriors need the items the rogue needs, second of all, a lot of people are "scared" of starting their own groups and relies on groups made by others, these guys are usually somewhat desperate (granted to a lesser degree for warrior because of their demand) to find a group and will join even if an item they need is reserved.
---
To use a more practical example, last time I played a rogue I was trying to get my hands on hoj, so I started a group and advertised it I found a warrior who was perfectly fine with me reserving hoj because he already had it and was farming for ironfoe.
---
Selfish; lacking consideration for other people; concerned chiefly with one's own personal profit or pleasure.
---
“None of it benefits me at all”
---
Not sure if serious or not. Hard to tell in this subreddit these days.
---
First, thank you for your work on this website.
---
I wish I could filter by armor type in the lists ( example : i don't want to tank with leather equipment but I want to see plates ones that affect my TPS ) and for weapons too ( 1h, 2h, daggers, Swords, etc.. )
---
^
---
I give you that at highend-raid-content you might have to bring resistance-gear as any class...
---
But neither my Warlock, Mage or Hunter did any Gear-swapping whatsoever on their way to level 60.
---
But shaman?
---
He was decent in TBC and early Wrath and then fell off hard when the skill cap went up tremendously in S7 &amp; S8. Yeah he got R1 in 5v5 by keyboard turning and clicking and making tons of mistakes.
---
I got ganked multiple times in stonetalon mountains. Trying to get a quest in the goblin hut as alliance with hordes swarming all over me because they do the same quest. luckily there he was a druid that helped me surviving my savoir. those things only happen on pvp server. I'm not really someone that will engage in pvp during leveling but damn it creates some cool moments.
---
Where is the one warrior who just goes in and gets nuked in .3 seconds? Because thats gonna be me.
---
'Where are my heals?!'
---
I don't, but I will buy one if Switch WoW is a thing (that and Animal Crossing in 2020)
---
[https://youtu.be/jYuUD0o-Nz8?t=315](https://youtu.be/jYuUD0o-Nz8?t=315)
---
That's my opinion having leveled one back then, maybe one day you'll look up the meaning of that word.
---
Well, there are mobs that give out hydraxian waterlords rep that you need for MC douse quest (thinking silithus ?). That and Argent Dawn rep is the only ones that most likely will have ANY real usage for you later on.
---
can't sheep mobs that are tagged by other players
---
I agree. A lot of us do, but there's no point in talking to a brick wall.
---
If he dies, mob resets and I don't have to wait at all.
---
I'll just stop. Looking at your other comments in this thread you're obviously trolling. No person is this inconsiderate.
---
It was a good show though I'll admit.
---
The elementals in Silithus give Hydraxin rep, which is useful for week one unlocks of the MC quests and Ragnaros.  Getting revered asap is also nice as it saves you trips to Azshara.  These mobs are tough though, even at level 59.
---
You could grind incendosaurs in the searing gorge.  Their scales are used as part of a rep turn-in with the thorium brotherhood.  This rep quest only works until friendly, so you would want to do it before doing all of the searing gorge quests.  Getting honoured requires dark iron residue, which I don't think that you can grind outside of BRD.
---
Thanks! I definitely did not see that. I hope Ion stays true to his word.
---
thats precisely what we did during vanilla..
---
i got to raid 15 minutes early with 3 druids, and made water for everyone while they innervate spam me
---
ahhh the good old days.
---
Thanks for the deep analysis. You are still a special kind of retard.
---
They said layering will only be temporary.
---
If I’m doing the Hunters epic quest and you help me I’m gonna stab you.
---
There is going to be transfers (high to low) anyway, we already know that, and we already know there will be overpopulated and dead servers. 
---
The only other way to fix it is by making like 3 of each realm all with the same name, reserving names/guilds is cross realm so they can be later merged, but that still creates a split player base without actually using cross realm phasing (such as with live servers).
---
Keeping track of everything in auction house in seconds. A job that would take HOURS to do manually
---
I'm not trolling. All of my posts are consistent. But that's as good as an admission of your mistake I guess.
---
You dont need to be good to be the best in the world (not saying he was), you just beed to be better than everyone else.
---
Looks like a resident of Goldshire.
---
So I give a mage a buff and get nothing in return, how am I profiting or deriving pleasure from giving a buff to not get a buff.
---
Difficult on some servers/battlegroups, especially at 19. 19 and 29 on my battlegroup had WSGs with 70%+ twinks on average, very often 5 man premades, sometimes 10 man. 
---
Can't oneshot other twinks.
---
You’re definitely the type of person who would roll night elf
---
Stop. Telling. People. How. To. Play. A. Game.
---
You are having fun the wrong way.
---
100% this. But also really excited to share the world with my partner who never played Classic (started in BfA).
---
They are putting it in though
---
If we want to use a proven way you can look at how FFXIV does it in it's default setup which allows 16 Skills per Hotbar with up to 8 Hotbars meaning 128 Abilities which are easily accessible with a controller.
---
Not my prefered gameplay style. But definitely possible and playable.
---
Yeah, but then you're a dirty NE, so that kind of ruins it all.
---
Well he literally says "we promise we will do this a few weeks in" in the clip. I'd expect a huge amount of blowback if they don't. Very rarely have I ever heard blizz promise something.
---
Well at least I can have my heart break treated with the European free healthcare :((
---
&gt; but there's no Dwarf Night Elf.
---
I mean... you're not wrong.
---
So, if this is information you need between AQ and NAXX, wouldnt you have ample time to check it... on live servers ? Just wondering...
---
Yea ... :(
---
Depends. There are too many variables, you get less xp per mob killed but the same amount for quests, kill quests are done faster while collect quests are done slower. The biggest problem is that mob kills are a significant amount of your xp gained (if not most of it), which can lead to you having to travel more between zones or having almost no quests at all for your level because you got a lot less xp than people who leveled solo after finishing the same amount of quests.
---
Get a mouse with 2 thumb buttons, bind those to shift and ctrl, `12345rtyufgzxcv are all somewhat useable, that's 48 keybinds
---
No because someone else will and post the results online
---
Well I'm hitting 60 within 10 days and so will many others, "a few weeks" is still plenty of time to exploit.
---
This was already the case in Vanilla, back then i used a bank alt on a 2nd account with, i think it was called "Auctioneer" back then to scan the AH and find bargains on one hand and list my auctions. I made quite some gold with that.
---
Because the change started years ago. The thing that started it started over a decade ago. Nost is the result of wanting Vanilla. Just like all other private servers.
---
But if everyone is geared in close to BiS and no one plays for honor per hour you end up with the best solo queue battlegrounds you can get.
---
Only remember his hot gf.
---
Private servers are more difficult. So achievements there do hold weight.
---
For priest only??
---
Haha this is actually really accurate.
---
What the fuck class are you playing where the buffs cost half your mana bar?
---
I really don't like to advertise hate or gatekeeping. But if you really want the "authentic" Vanilla experience. Delete Your brain, stop watching videos about it and unsub here. Almost all of your comments here are either not thought out until the end, or just misinformation.
---
There are some very interesting things you can do but I doubt that there's much that hasn't been done in 15 years the game has been out.
---
Mixing all three talent trees is almost exclusively for PvP though and it only works for some classes, like Druids for example.
---
As someone who NEVER played vanilla I'm so fucking confused about what class to play, what professions to pick. Plis halp.....!!!!! 😳
---
slow speed 
---
no cloak
---
slow energy recover
---
So after all that what makes you want to play on them ?
---
I think Night elf is the min-max choice for druid
---
oom then feel useless
---
It'll be nice if it really works like that. Flasks are gonna be like 200g a pop and tryhards will be losing their minds.
---
The plural of lotus is lotuses.
---
Oof.
---
F
---
I never understood how people look at games. Not saying this in a bad way, just that i personally dont understand it. Having played all the expansions except for mop and playing vanilla again on a ptivate server i still have no clue about any animation differences, im sure i can tell if i see them both in a comparison but by memory? Hell no. Again, im playing private server right now and if you asjed me about any of the animarions of my druid there is only a few i could tell you how they look. I just dont pay that much attention to it, and i guess im more focused at looking at whatever im fighting than at my character. Stuff like this and stuff like feeling the need to relaste to a character in a videogame i will never understand, i just dont care. Im not the character in the videogame nor do i feel any desire to be, its an avatar. I would never play a human for instance. In games with character creators i just do something that looks cool because in creating a character for the game. I dont try to make it look like me.
---
Again, not critizing anyone who does.
---
I still to this day think rolling a Human is the most bland and boring option.
---
It's one of the reasons i never hang out in SW also, (plus SW was created first in the game and the textures suffer from it)
---
Ironforge was the place for me as a introverted nerd back then, it was inside, it was dark, it had an badass music score :P
---
I LOVE rogue, I hate that stealth requires talenting for increased movement speed as a combat rogue.
---
Ive made a countdown to character creation and release over at www.iswowclassicout.com :)
---
Stop freaking out about a temporary solution to server load problems.
---
1.12 Rogues are nowhere near as good as earlier iterations and as such people have this PTSD of rogues being gods. In 1.12 they are much more balanced and as you can see from some of the posters here the results from people in the know (such as PServers and Classic Beta) are that more people will be rolling Warrior and Mage and they will in fact be the overpopulated classes.
---
Anyone rolling rogue in 1.12 to be dominant forces of nature as they may have seen in old PVP videos are in for a rude awakening.
---
I was a Rogue in vanilla wow that raided up to and including Naxx (only a few bosses but still), I also raided up to and including AQ40 (downing CTHUN) on a PServer, I never had a problem getting a group although pre-BIS gearing is still a pain more than anything due to our BIS lists being shared amongst many classes such as hunters, enh shaman, warriors, druids etc etc.
---
You never stated it was your opinion, but formed a response that makes it sound like it's the definite experience of leveling a warrior.
---
How do we take a moment? What is your request? Upvotes? A moment of silence?
---
Can't change title or I would :(
---
He's an actor. His YouTube channel had plenty of skits that had nothing to do with wow and honestly were comedy gold. Think low-budget Borat, but French-Canadian.
---
He was also a very good pvper. Best in ther world? That's somewhat subjective. He never did esports so I'd say that's a probably a no.
---
However, he was rank 1 in 2s, 3s, and 5s during wotlk or tbc I think. That's really the only in-game metric to show who is "the best."
---
Priest, mage, not sure about mark of the wild mana cost on druids. It's not literally half the mana bar but it's close.
---
I found I became target number 1, but there were a few exceptions. 
---
Generally:
---
- They stop dead in their tracks and stare at you
---
- You wave at them and carry on with what you’re doing
---
- 30 - 60 seconds later some sort of attack lands. Always from behind. 
---
- Druid escape-artist routine begins
---
They are developing system to be turn off in week or month. How delusional you have to be to believe that.
---
It will never be turned off completely.
---
[This](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12711/plans-whitesoul-helm) comes to mind.
---
Also, you can get a trinket that gives 30 sec immunity to fear from BS quest chain, which for a paladin is kinda cool.
---
Mmm, none of these trigger me, but the concerns are:
---
1) server getting faction imbalanced
---
2) don't particularly care for people who think playing on a PvP server makes them superior
---
3) many say PvP servers are not fun if you're not a no-lifer. Granted, I also heard the opposite...
---
On the other hand, I really like small group skirmishes. Like that one time we assembled a group on Alliance and went to Wailing Caverns for shits and giggles and messed with some Horde groups.
---
Pretty sure you only need gametime but I could be wrong
---
Nah getting upset at people thinking it matters with the ultimate min maxing mindset when you'll be able to clear content with any class.
---
Just generally disliking assholes, a surprising amount of them are warriors all wanting to be that top dps, compensating for something maybe ?
---
Not really, nothing’s stopping you from blowing a bunch of gold on an item that’ll be irrelevant in a few levels.
---
Oddly not interested in playing shaman. Same goes for hunter and druid.
---
Nobody called it “Vanilla” in 2004. Even worse than the usual low effort memes.
---
I remember step 3. being something in goldshire, but I'm not sure anymore....
---
&gt; you'll never have to worry about it going away in the next decade
---
Erm?
---
2019*
---
Great
---
Just say cocaine and a bunch of hookers.

Looks pretty comfy desu
---
He was also a very good pvper. Best in ther world? That's somewhat subjective. He never did esports so I'd say that on a professional level, no.
---
However, he was rank 1 in 2s, 3s, and 5s during wotlk or tbc I think. That's really the only in-game metric to show who is "the best." By that metric, one could argue that he was, briefly, the best paladin in the world.
---
I always wanted to do this, but couldn't afford two subscriptions as a kid.
---
Here’s hoping there is a separate EU stress test next week :(
---
Everything is a Hunter weapon
---
Man, so many people bitter my birthday is on the release date.
---
I don’t know whether or not that is true, as I have no experience with them - either way you can’t say that Classic WoW is under tuned, because it’s an identical copy of the original. You could say that private servers are overturned if you wish.
---
If you are willing to clutter your inventory with 2 completely different sets of gear, Druid is the ultimate entry-ticket for 5-man-instances.
---
They are a lot of fun in PvP but mostly for different reasons than rogue. Playing them like a rogue that lacks CC is not really gonna work. Their main-advantage is being hard to kill by using all of their kit. It is quite likely that during your average PvP-situation in AB you'll be at, caster, bear and cheetah.
---
I think that people who want to play warrior with PvP in mind underestimate the gear- and healer-dependency. Of the 4 classes I had at 60 it was by far the most frustrating one to play pvp with. Hunter, Mage and Druid all felt significantly more viable with subpar gear.
---
So depending on how important PvP is for you I'd recommend rogue or druid over warrior.
---
Same with paladins, thats my point...
---
For me it's a constant "Warrior! ...? Or maybe a Mage? A Rogue?"
---
I want to play all 3 because I played all 3 in Vanilla, just can't decide what to play first but it's like a 40/35/25 in favour of Warrior right now (since I main one in retail)
---
I have a solution in place that needs a bit more testing and bullet-proofing. I'm tracking time played every level, and then also printing previous level time for the screen shot. At this point I'm thinking I'll just release a new addon called something like "Memoria_Updated" as the author hasn't gotten back to me. Here is a screenshot of the work in progress for showing previous level time. It also, for the duration of the screenshot, expands the chat window to ensure everything is captured.

Me me me me me, all you care about is yourself. I get it - we are done here.
---
Yeah, you had to get the addon thing tho that scanned it
---
you could check the bags and everything
---
Looks like he’s constantly about to trip
---
Yeah that’s fair
---
Number of times I've jerked today to the idea of playing wow C. Oh those nelfs. 
---
Fyi. JK!
---
Their bed-heads are oddly well coiffured. :D
---
You seem just as sure about your decision as I am! :D
---
what kinda virgin cares
---
Yes! Had a 60 Female Gnome Warrior as first alt with full PvP gear. Escape Artist is godly.
---
&gt;Because that is what modern games have trained people to think. That only the endgame matters and everything else is a waste of time
---
You know which "modern" game taught me that?
---
Vanilla World of Warcraft.
---
I dunno why everyone is so keen on joining exact release time, you just know its gonna be a clusterfuck, this time around its not 100meter dash race, its a marathon, take your time levelling, enjoy the old content once again.
---
Can you please check if you can see Stress test in your games &amp; subscriptions or did it only reappear in your launcher? I have EU account and had access to previous tests but still can't see it in
---
 website.
---
Best way to die in my honest opinion
---
But I'm only talking about helping others!
---
love to do this so much, it literally brings the world to life.
---
Now wheres my "no changes" crowd at? 😂
---
You mean human priests get desperate prayer?
---
"Tiny bonus"
---
For someone trying to top dps meters 3% is massive.
---
Does this work for PvP too?
---
Well to pull different pack from currently fighting one, it's not tunnel vision, it's literally the opposite...
---
Sometimes the feeling that I don't get to always choose how my day goes is an interesting thing.  
---
I love the feeling of always being on the look out for the enemy faction while I'm playing. I love it when my heart starts beating a little bit faster when enemies approach, and then really taking off once they attack.  
---
I also think it's interesting when the opposite faction helps each other even though they're a tab target away from being able to kill one another.  
---
It's all mostly just the good feeling I get from playing PVP servers.  
---
A lot of interesting stories can come out of it as well. Like that time you killed two people who tried to gank you, etc etc. Not a story I can often tell because I'm not great at PVP, but hopefully I can remedy that issue in Classic since I'll have a lot more time to play Classic than I did private servers.
---
&gt; tiny bonus
---
damn, so much positive energy, you, kind sir or ma'am, have my respect
---
oh my bad, have not played since Cata and only saw that board in Stormwind just outside the AH
---
I think IF was dead around that time. Shame.
---
The reusable Eternal Quintessence was originally added in patch 1.11.0 - I would assume they unlock around AQ content for Classic too.
---
If you're willing to save up the Thorium Brotherhood quests, I  think it makes sense to wait until Honored, since Neutral-&gt;Friendly is pretty cheap via Incendosaur Scales quests, and Friendly -&gt; Honored is easy with all the Dark Iron Residue you get from BRD.
---
Dude, keep up! Nice Idea, I feel sorry for you being so hard misunderstood. Nice creative way, never heard of that before.
---
Can't tell you if it's working or not, just keep your mood up!
---
Tank in the middle of Sunken Temple run: Shit sorry guys, about to run out of battery and my charger is broken
---
If you put in the time to level a character to 60, I don't think it is unreasonable to want to raid as well.
---
What does this have to do with NElves though?
---
Yep
---
You used to be able to be facing the other way and turn with right mouse to point at the target when casting, it would look really cool, now you can't do that
---
And they removed the omni animation from immolate
---
WTF!
---
Layering is implemented on the first two zones. Its not like you can exploit that in anyway it would effect nothing more than your leveling speed thru 20. Its not like you can spam instances in winterspring and camp lotus spawns or reset wpl fields for aoe lmao.
---
Coming down off the high of dumbing down TBC's raid content?  Not sure if I misunderstand the meaning but isn't dumbing down considered a bad thing or is this the viewpoint of everyone who was then able to see all the content that they otherwise were not able to see?  I personally quit after killing Kil'Jaeden because of what a letdown it was (had just killed M'uru prior to the nerf and didn't have very much time to work on non-dumbed down version of KJ but was making steady progress).  Seemed to me that Blizzard was just going the let everyone do everything route (which is basically what happened).
---
After Nost was shut down there was a change.org petition with 280k signings, JonTron made videos, Sodapoppin was super vocal about it and in general huge outrage.
---
"You think you do, but you don't" absolutely used to be the main stream opinion. If you'd asked in /r/wow why people play on private servers, people would have told you that that's because they don't want to pay the subscription money.
---
Nostalrius being shut down and the shitstorm following it was absolutely the reason why anyone at Blizzard even considered Classic.
---
people dont know shadowmeld increases your stealth level if rogue or drood?
---
n o H a i r
---
I am not strong enough to downvote this
---
Been laughing every time someone says exalted by 40.  I did it in classic, started in teldrassil with my gnome.  Spent a ton on runecloth anyway, it ain't happening, even by 60.
---
You could have a whole guild pick the bl at the same time, that way you get 40 bls in each spawn
---
&gt;Layering is implemented on the first two zones.
---
Source?
---
&gt; At worst, I'm trading 1 for 1 while my team 9v9s, so if I can do it on a healer or key dps, life is good.
---
Huh, never thought of it that way.

Few weeks can mean quite a lot, the latest call which is what people fear for is 2 months.

Where are you getting payed 25$/day to work part time?
---
hunter is the best class because I can beat anyone in pvp with proper kiting
---
nothing, I'll always be hunter
---
Mods! How come this low effort meme gets posted, but my equally low effort meme gets blocked by the auto-moderator?
---
Sincerely a class that struggles leveling that has no buffs or heals, kap
---
And the rogues in the back waiting for low clothies🤣🤣
---
I don't now for sure about quests but people on beta have definitely been at jinthalor to get the mallet to summon ghazrilla in ZF. Not sure if that answers your Q though.
---
Being a good paladin is like being the tallest midget. It doesn't matter how "Good" you are, you are still a midget.
---
Your explanation was a bunch of bullshit that you're just guessing at since you have no clue though.
---
Raid scripting on private servers has been pretty damn good for the past few years now actually. Mechanics are obvious and easy to recreate, the not-so-obvious stuff like armor values were what they had to take an educated guess on, but servers tended to err on the side of more difficult than vanilla.
---
You obviously have some sort of strange vendetta against private servers which is clouding your ability to have a rational conversation right now.
---
When it's an elite, the dragon has wings.

---
I find it funny how despite your desire to be able to do everything you never seem to have played an actual hybrid class.
---
Try Brave. Build on chromium
---
By questing, obviously. You don't want to turn in cloth or the ungoro stuff, that shit will take way longer to farm the gold for than it'll take you to incorporate enough darnassus quests into your leveling route.
---
I mained Elemental Shaman my whole life. From TBC, where I first dinged max level, till BFA.
---
The last few expensions I startes serieus raiding trying to get a decent world rank kill.
---
I was happy and I felt in love with raiding.
---
In classic I have to make a decision. I could pick the spec ( Elemental ), the one I loved the most or pick serieus raiding, wich required me to pick a new class.
---
I decided I love serieus raiding more than the fantacy of Elemental Shaman and I dicided to roll Mage. I'll make a Shaman alt but will probebly play my mage 98% of the time since I never liked alts.
---
They said no further than phase 2, which we don't know how long will be. Could be more or less. Likely more.
---
He’s a fucking weirdo now, has his own weird little cult, he even said to his wife that they can only hug 3 times per day and no more, strange behaviour
---
people sucked in tbc retail,  but tbc enha is good with a druid in 2s or 3s. classic tho, different story. just lackluster and weak.
---
It hurts my head. No way this guy is real otherwise he needs a CAT scan.
---
Six demon bag
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=7734
---
&gt;It only has 6 abilities.
---
Frostbolt
---
Fireball
---
Chain lightning
---
Polymorph:Sheep
---
Whirlwind
---
Felhunter
---
Here's a little info about these...
---
Frostbolt - 200-250 dmg, slows target movment
---
Fireball - 200-250 dmg
---
Chainlightning - 175-225 dmg, atk 3 targets (unknown if it looses dmg per target)
---
Polymorph:Sheep - will either poly you or your enemy. Kinda funny.. however I havn't noticed the health regen as if a mage would poly you, so in PvP, if you get poly'd pray!
---
Whirlwind - Its exactly like the new druid spell from what i can tell. Simply disables the target for a few seconds though I don't know how long.
---
Felhunter - Neat to see, but has no abilities so does minimal dmg similar to a mechanical yeti but lasts only about 30 sec.
---
Dying doing something you love.
---
Worth it.
---
I'd like to know what build they are using
---
Looks like a sub hemo build since the increased movement speed and usage of swords/maces
---
Any experts?
---
if you say so my mage record is 88.5 hours lmao.
---
How can you not freak out over layer hopping phase farm abuse even if it's only for a few weeks?
---
They are actually good starting in BC as a token 1-of
---
I wasn't going to list everything I've played I was just providing examples. I've played a pala, priest hunter and lock at 60 / raided in some capacity. Played druid till 40 but hated the play style and I'm alliance so shaman ain't happening. Post could have been 10 times the length if I listed all my rerolls... it's an illness
---
from what I hear they said smth about they expecting phase 2 to be 2 months, that's what I was referencing.
---
The greatest band of heroes of (beta) Azeroth
---
If you don’t care about getting a buff back why do you care if the class can buff at all?
---
If you really didn’t expect anything you wouldn’t mind helping a class that can’t reciprocate.
---
Theres some quest item that mimics cone of cold.  Could easily fool a melee to think that you missed him or he dodged it to make them get confident in your lack of instants remaining. 
---
Though i cant remember its name.
---
Your definition of must watch and mine differ considerably!
---
Imagine being so rude and disdainful about people participating in challenging raid content.
---
Parry chance has been confirmed to be about 3x as high as private servers, but that ain't got any bearing on damage potential itself, other than tanks genereting less threat, which probably means fury warriors will not be as good, because they don't have threat reduction.
---
Its the uncertainty how long it lasts is what is freaking people out. We've seen on the Beta that there are some things you can abuse with layering and keeping it on to long will imbalance stuff.
---
Imo its not that big of a "monster" but alot of people would still rather have a terrible launch and an unplayable start compared to this "change".
---
Most fears are overreactions but layering is by far the biggest change to vanilla.
---
I bet his uncle works as a GM too
---
Nice ! But am I the chosen nice ?
---
I did it the other day in stonetalon because some of the runs are INSANE and the guy I ressed lost his shit with happiness
---
What they should have done is layering, but at the server level.
---
So, rather than large servers with tens of thousands of players split into hundreds of layers, they should make hundreds of small(say, 1k each) servers.
---
Then, as the initial rush dies down and populations start to drop, start merging the servers.
---
100x increase lmao, people will say anything they can to make pservers look bad.
---
Fair enough. I'd not seen a duration for phases.
---
Yeah, that's like their goal. They show them who's in charge
---
You are in the vast vast minority of people (let alone students) if you make that much part time in 2 months.
---
&gt;found an open world farming technique that makes me more GPH (RNGish) then DME Lasher runs
---
What is it?
---
The classic panel at blizzcon. when they talked about layering, the guy said its gonna be only in the few first zones and will be removed when things settles down. 
---
Layering will have no effect on the game exept the starter zones will be alot smoother to get through.
---
Private servers use dynamic respawns to help players to quest more efficently, since they dont have decent and working layering systems in their core. Layering creates no severe complications to economy what so ever, if its implemented only to the lower level zones.
---
Its a whole differend issue if they would implement layering for example time-wise, as you can rush lvl 35 and camp Tidal charm boss in arathi highlands, to get the most powerfull PvP trinket in vanilla. Blizzard is very aware of this scenarios and creating thise useless posts daily about "layering" is annoying and useless.
---
I have no memories of experiencing this personally, but I definitely remember reading about it.
---
I wonder if there are any official sources about this / any information when it was patched out.
---
Another question is about what Blizzard's stance is about re-implementing that feature.
---
&gt;If they just disagreed with me and said, "You're wrong but it doesn't really matter." that fine. 
---
But it does matter. Its the tanks job to hold aggro not yours. Dps using high threat abilities makes things harder on the tank and healer. 
---
If you want smooth runs and people to group with you again don't do it. If you don't care don't expect people to care about you.
---
Hi, can you repost the link for xlsx ?
---
During vanilla I restarted on two different server waves (once with entire guild reroll, once by myself) and although I enjoyed leveling and especially dungeons on the way to 60, the main focus was always 60.  I personally enjoy after 60 getting everything setup for your character profession/consumables/gear-wise.  I usually started doing lbrs/brd by 58ish and finished leveling that way.  MMOs have always been forward focused, they just took longer which I had no complaints about (looking at you here EQ).
---
I disagree.
---
Killing gnomes is a godly aphrodisiac.
---
WOW classic 69
---
Global release in days
---
I want Wow Classic on mobile just to farm consummables, no joke.
---
Maybe I should shut up.
---
If we wouldn’t freaked out over everything we would probably get WoW Classic blood elf LFR edition. Shut up.
---
Private servers with dynamic respawns
---
If you *really* want to min-max Alliance, you’ll roll Horde.
---
I played a Shaman recently on a *gasp* private server. This time I played 1h enh and had a much better time than going 2h. Might be worth a shot.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=5636/desperate-prayer
---
Both do
---
This hit close, I’m literally stuck between rogue and lock and it’s reallly mind f’ing me.
---
Played rogue in vanilla and lock in TBC (guild reroll) and I have no clue which way I’m leaning. Debuff max has me leaning rogue. Just feels like there are going to be a lot of rogues.
---
And apparently you can’t summon infernals and doomguards to wreck starting spots? Since when is that against the rules
---
You haven’t played since MoP? How do you have access to WoD and Legion then? Is it all free besides BFA content (assuming you have a membership)?
---
It's cool. We can disagree.
---
I need context which one is horde?
---
You get Evergreen Pouch from druid vendors, that require 2 Un'goro soil samples + packet of Tharlendris seeds to create Evergreen Herb Casing, which will hopefully contain Morrowgrain. And Morrowgrain is what you turn in for reputation.
---
Damn in phase 2 comes after just 2 months casuals on pvp servers will not have s good time...
---
That might be an overreaction but we would have loot trading in dungeons.
---
Ah yes another victim of the ol’ blood clot in the legs from sitting for 3 days straight. 
---
Moral of the story is drink water and get up to squirt every once in a while unless you don’t mind being dead.
---
So what's it like in the launch version?
---
Which do not affect people aiming to level fast because the respawn is only in highly overpopulated zones.
---
But that will be much slower than classic and it's much too high regeneration rates compared to 1.12.
---
It will. But the lenght is vague. Blizz said a few weeks with a max of tge entirity of phase 1.
---
Meaning 2 weeks or 6 months. Who knows. Also its depending on the server population.
---
Oodles of class fantasy though. That plays a massive role in being rewarding to play.
---
Nelf warrior are best! 1% Dodge, Nature resist, shadowmeld, look cool as f\*\*\*, graceful, tall. Nelf Female = Best animations on Alliance.
---
&gt; Not really quite like that, because literally anyone can do it. You don't need to be rich. It takes time to get some of the best pieces, but those aren't even like expensive boe items.
---
This at best a half-truth, more like a quarter-truth.
---
Technically an experienced player who knows the game and was very, very lucky could decide that their first and only toon would be a twink and get all the BiS gear and enchants unassisted. You'd have to spend a lot of time flipping for a profit on the AH which is something that takes a fair bit of knowledge to do, and you would have to be lucky with your groups and drops, but it's not impossible.
---
It is, however, so close to impossible for a genuine noob to do that while levelling to 19 that it doesn't matter.
---
And it is overwhelmingly likely anyone who did it in real life had the help of multiple 60s to clear the dungeons for them, win in the arena for them and farm the gold for them.
---
The fact is, twinkers do not want fair fights. We know that because Blizzard gave them fair fights and they all immediately logged off. The number of twinks who actually wanted fair fights was so tiny they had to all transfer to one battlegroup to try to get games happening, and even then most of the time they could not get a match.
---
Oh shit I remembered the flips just now. Are there any other races with another jump?
---
Honestly a lot less people were actually on the original beta than claim they were.
---
I'll happily admit I joined the game around 1.5/1.6 or so, it vaguely annoys me when so many people claim to have played from day one, but I think we all know a large amount of them are lying.
---
To be fair, Ion did promise, he used that word, that it was only for a few weeks in phase 1. So fingers crossed that they will keep this promise.
---
It also is not 3% DPS increase, but 3% hit increase. In case of warriors, your hits generate rage. If you miss 3% more, you not only do 3% less damage, you also gain less rage, which means you gain less damage.
---
You can play WoW with an Xbox controller quite easily. For the switch i’d bind d-pad to 1-4, LB and RB are shift / alt modifiers.
---
PvP realms are also for non-PvPers. Its increases social interaction. Even someone who does not gank or kill lowbies have an impact on these players. You can walk by someone of the other faction and help him out, wave at him or whatever.
---
That guy goes tru a rollercoaster of emotions because of you. Fear from seeing you, excitement when you walk up to him. Confusion because you dont kill him. Joy for waving at him and gratefull because you let him live.
---
Followed by anger because you decided to kill him
---
Rage because you also did a /spit with no reason.
---
PvP realms will get you way more enotional invested  and thats why people stick to this game. 
---
My advise is PvP realms for everyone.
---
Unless someone types "Imo" it's fact to you? It's more of a courtesy than anything. The opposite is more appropriate, stating that something is a fact when someone claims it's an opinion, like whether the Earth is flat or not.
---
No it's pirate
---
Please don't. 
---
It's good XP while searching for Mankrik's wife, am I right?
---
Charlie Kelly would disagree.
---
I think it’s the exact opposite to be honest. Many people in contention for world first Rag kills (people from APES, etc) have said the big decider in who will get world first is the guild that can get 30+ people to level cap the fastest. Once you’re there, rotation and raid mechanics are relatively simple. 
---
I’m not saying there is no optimization to be done at endgame, far from it, but if you’re trying to get there quickly, you are 100% going to have to optimize your leveling route and plan ahead.
---
The other day I ganked a lvl 42 warrior on my lvl 35 hunter. I managed to get him tangled up in mobs. However, I died of bleed a bit after he died. 
---
I wonder what will happen when I meet him next.
---
What the fuck is the point of this post? So people dont show up during the first 3 hours? When blizzard is actually testing. nice shitpost.
---
That seems rather inefficient, while you’re spamming Arcane Explosion mobs are punching away your health. Isn’t the old fashioned method better?
---
Raise hands if you actually enjoy leveling
---
\*Hand up\*
---
I only buff group members. I don't waste my mana on people who haven't or aren't going to help me.
---
Are you guys trolling?
---
I watched the entire panel and there was no mention of zone restrictions, and at that point they had not even come up with the layering system..
---
Interesting you chose this thread to make that post.
---
Its public not private nor pirate. Everyone can log in why would you call it private dumbass.
---
spirit gear is your friend
---
yes
---
Not in classic.
---
If you see someone wrecking some Alliance scum out in the world, I'd advice to no bother helping out if it's pretty clear that your horde compadre has the upper hand. I always found it kinda annoying if someone swooped in to 'help' me out in pvp, while it was fairly obvious I was winning (by having someone down to low health, for example). When I saw world pvp going on, I usually went to take a closer look, but only stepped in when my horde buddies appeared to be losing.
---
The more unlikely thing is that anyone said anything at all on retail
---
There's cats there.  You don't see em, but trust me... they're there.
---
Oh it's time to complain about layering again. Do you guys have a schedule on a discord somewhere where you're told what to complain about on which days?
---

If the party/guild chat were anything like this thread you weren't met with toxicity. You were called on your bullshit then you responded with toxicity and every else followed suit.

Raiding with 40 people is actually really fun (I don't know about organizing though), the later expansions don't have that.
---
Athene was not extreemly skilled but he was smart. Minmaxing engenering with new smart macros gave him the edge. Same goes for Swifty.
---
But Athene was not a teamplayer, his ego was to big.
---
By today standards he is bad.
---
Not if they die
---
He meant that as priest viper sting sucks really hard haha
---
&gt; 1) I wouldn't twink to crush under-geared lowbies, I would twink to fight other twinks
---
They all said that. Then when they got to fight other twinks with xp-locking, they all logged off. The tiny, tiny minority who really did want to fight other twinks could barely get a game.
---
Myth busted. Twinkers were there to grief levellers, not to fight other twinks. If they were honest about wanting to fight other twinks then xp locking would have brought in the golden age of twinking instead of killing it.
---
:)
---
Im on the same boat as you except that mage is winning the polls rn, IMO Mage as first character is BIS, since their leveling speed is very good, they have immense QoL (food&amp;water for free + teleports /portals AND the option to level as AoE? c'mon man seems unfair) and you can profit so easily at max level.
---
It's like the loading screen tip "Remember to take all things in moderation..."
---
Well open beta stress test coming out, at least I got that going for me
---
I do love a good lemon Pledge, but it just doesn't have the bite you get with Windex.
---
I have never played Classic properly (Started in Legion) and I basically only made my twinks on retail because I could get BiS on it without worrying about Titanforging etc. 
---
Can't wait to actually try classic at 60 and feel true BiS! Booked four days off just to play on release, never been so hyped for a game before.
---
Anyone with a normal social skill would recognize that the tank asked you that.
---
You need to be exalted with the specific faction in order to purchase their mounts.
---
The only thing I paid attention to rolling a NE warrior on a pv server was that in the start, NE’s are soo weak compared to dwarves (which I rolled later). I really felt that when leveling, because obviously warriors are already hard to level and don’t need more disadvantages.
---
https://youtu.be/Q-GobXQTf6w
---
dude - I'm in the EXACT same situation... Sooooo many rogues in vanilla. Always a spot for a warlock. Got me leaning lock.. But maybe people now knows shit.. and picks more even?
---
The problem is not the "Chinese" farmers. It's the people who buy their items. If they didn't buy, there would be no market.
---
There's no add-on or macro that make it easier? With a lot of class you can setup a 1 button leveling macro

File Planet (or game spy or some shit like that) ran a promotion whereby giving anyone who paid for a subscription for a month (I think it was $15) they would get a closed beta invite. My friend and I did that only to get a look at the game and it was glorious. The closed beta had a fair few people but it would be impossible to tell how many anymore.
---
I started in TBC and ive always hated leveling, it feels like a chore. Raiding and getting BiS gear is what I love about wow.
---
I'll main a Human Rogue so the Shaowmeld is not a big deal for me.
---
Wep. bonus as a Rogue and +10% rep. gain is great!
---
Ignore what everyone is saying about pvp servers.  If you don't play on a pvp server, you are going to have a shit vanilla experience.  Trust me on this man, you will be missing out on so much.  PvE servers are BORING.
---
You can select class when you open up the guide, it alters things here and there to make it doable for lets say a warrior
---
I love Shaman but I despise Horde. I also don't like how entitled the melees are in your group. Like 1 second of not having Windfury totem down and they whisper you and moan.
---
I love Warlock but playing against Undead is a true nightmare, as I won't go Horde. I also don't like how entitled other groupmembers are expecting me to summon them when they afk in town due to lazyness. I am concidering charging 2 gold per summon.
---
I like Priest but I want to be a Night Elf and refuse to play Dwarf. The whole fear ward thing and stuff, I dunno.
---
I like Druid but no rez and the limited demand in raids make it a tough thing to main.
---
I get really envious of Mages. They are super powerful in all aspects of the game. What stops me from maining it is simply I cannot for the life of me enjoy the playstyle.
---
Meanwhile in BfA: "yeah classic is going to be so cool :D "
---
1. Because every one of "these" servers, advertises themselves as private servers.
---
2. I always understood in a way that these servers are a private take on patches, since many of these servers had different xp rates, different values for many stuff etc. (many =/= most)
---
Was it nostalrius that was the catalyst for this or did blizzard see other games like Everquest raking in the $$$ from multiple types of classic servers?  I wonder if the nostalrius guys got jobs at blizz.
---
Now i've only seen one person advocating for a lfg/lfr tool but #changes people exist big time and funnily enough most of them seem to be new to classic and from retail. Just take a look in new once a while, see all the new flairless people asking for small changes and big changes.
---
There is a fuckton of retail fans asking for talent spec changes which is a big no go for me and 99% of pserver players.
---
&gt; No, reddit has spoken. No fun allowed.
---
I think this is the twinker mindset in a nutshell.
---
Is twinking fun *for them*? If so, they must be allowed to do it. Anyone who says different hates fun.
---
Does it matter whether they are spoiling the game for levellers with their seal clubbing? No. The twinkers are having fun. That is all that matters.
---
&gt;that there are some things you can abuse with layering 
---
Errm, that's why they have a beta, to find and deal with these problems.
---
No Gnome can every be glorious
---
Great post!
---
This is all so relatable!
---
I can easily answer your first question... but not your second, ha!
---
This means my envy for other classes also made me reroll and main them for a while.
---
However, there had been two classes that I kinda managed to actually main for longer than others, which seems to indicate that they had something going that I knew I would be jealous about as soon as I stopped having that myself.
---
These two classes were Druid and Mage.
---
The thing that made me envy druids first was their ability to fill any roll in dungeons and being almost unkillable in World-PvP. It seemed all so cool... until I tried tanking Hakkar in Zul Gurub as our second tank-warrior wasn't there. Despite having like 11k armor the healers told me there's no way they could keep me up without going oom. That's when I looked into how mitigation for warriors works and learned about all those other things reducing damage-intake except for armor. But since I already had a Warrior and knew that besides having better mitigation for tanking they couldn't do a whole lot of all the other things I could do, I managed to still feel kinda good about my druid. It just ceased feeling "perfect".
---
The thing that made me envy mages was this one level 42 Gnome Mage in Tanaris. Improved Blizzard! I had never seen it in action before at that time. But he was killing 10 Pirates at once by making them increadibly slow! This was incredibly impressive and something that I knew no other class could possibly do! The class never disappointed me. It basically was capable of everything I thought it was. Of course I found out that spots like the one in Tanaris were actually pretty rare and that even one mob with range could mess up that way of killing them. But it was still pretty cool.
---
So with a druid and a mage I felt I had basically covered up all of the aspects. They both were nice in PvP, one was great for doing important roles in dungeons and one was great at doing damage to many targets at once. I mean I still played a new warrior-alt because of the combination of the Hakkar-incident and a friend wanting to start a new rogue. But at least both of those were well established at 60 and didn't make me feel like missing out too much by not having what others have.
---
It clearly helped that I didn't know too much about other classes, though.
---
Take whatever advice from a Pserver with a grain of salt. it's not going to be a 1:1 to classic WoW.
---
najsu
---
Thats why I dont see it as that big of an issue. Also i dont believe they can fix all "abusable" things.
---
But we will see : )
---
I didn't downvote you.
---
But they have boring rotation
---
I think lasts half hour, if logged off.
---
I agree with all of the above. I love lock, but dwarf are my fave race and can't be one. Totally agree about mages. Super envious, then and rogue are my only hard-core 100% noes
---
Indeed.
---
Shall I get you a tissue?
---
Are you me ?
---
That C&amp;D was the trigger that made all happen.
---
Without that C&amp;D, Nost team and the community would NOT start the petition...and Classic would still be answered by "you think you do, but you don't" at Blizzcon. 
---
Every single Blizzcon.
---
Nope. Vanilla private servers have been around for a long time and it's been discussed ad nauseum that folks played on Vanilla servers because of Vanilla, not the monthly fee.
---
Why? Let's see if you can keep up:
---
Because you had every expansion as a private server literally weeks after an expansion launched and yet the most popular private server type was Vanilla because that's what folks wanted to play. We had more buggy Vanilla servers that were being played than better maintained TBC, wrath, cata, mop, etc servers. Then you've got vanilla servers saying they will shut down and a huge amount of players saying they will pay to play Classic - like they HAVE BEEN SAYING for YEARS AND YEARS.
---
Nost is the "straw that broke the camel's back". Nost is one of many private servers but specifically - this is important so I hope you understand the outcry - it was taken down BY BLIZZARD.
---
That's it. It was the final straw. The final nail in the coffin. The last log to the flame.
---
Not the first. Nope. Not a chance.
---
The LEAST you can do is a bit of googling on the history of the Vanilla and private server scene and not just look at what happened in the last couple years. There's over a decade of info, forum posts, private servers, etc.
---
This shit has been known to the Vanilla community and pserver crowd forever. You might be new to all this so go to the magic Google box. Go. Go research.
---
This close to release? That's a risky move.
---
Well, ACNH is a thing anyway :p 
---
A wonderful thing.
---
Yes. But Blizzard won't do TBC.
---
They will do Classic+, because it's the only way forward.
---
Tauren can ride wolfs and kodos.
---
Others can ride all.
---
Idk about alliance but I think gnomes and dwarfs are the only 2 that can ride mechanostriders.
---
Never heard about the ConsolePort Addon ? Pretty fun IMO
---
Well I played vanila anyway I'm a 15 year vet  but I've never been on a pvp server and thought this would be a good time to strat, but I'm trying to get a feel for the highs and lows
---
They contributed their time, so many of them in fact that blizzard took notice and decided to monetize the idea. You are a fool to think millions of people playing an old game and that game getting a remaster arent correlated. 
---
Nice bullshit on they all want their dick sucked though lol.
---
This. I always mained lock (since TBC). So now i'm torn between playing the class I know I like and a class I've never played before. Unfortunately I don't have a lot of game time (1 kid there, second one due tomorrow) so It'll take me months to get a character to lvl 60. And I don't want to lose time leveling a rogue only to find out it sucks at level 40.. or maybe I'll roll a mage.. my name is clownbe and i'm an altoholic.
---
I love the idea of druids, but I like to fight and see my armour, running around as animals all the time ruined it for me. Love the detailed reply. I'll reread it later when not stuck on my phone at work
---
chill they said in an interview that they will only have it for phase one.
---
PvP servers are not for everyone. If your time is limited and you want to focus mainly on raids, then go PvE. If you dont mind wasting time being killed or killing others while you level, then roll PvP.
---
Never heard someone calling a private server a pirate server.
---
Yellow heads, because they're advancing.
---
It depends, is the devil inside you? :P
---
pick one cause you will not be able max all 3
---
I'm envious of every single player that actually enjoy healing, ranged dps and tanking.  
---
But I would never play anything else than melee dps coz I want to be up close and personal of my victims ;)
---
Strange to think you can't see the difference between scattered forum posts talking about a topic and a server actually being set up and ten of thousands of people playing it.
---
Clearly blizzard could. Talk is talk but a bunch of people actually playing is a lot more incentive to invest in a remaster.
---
It's not about whether "everyone can do it" (for a value of "everyone" meaning people who have hundreds of gold to spend at level 19 and know where every BiS item in the game is located). It's about whether it spoils the game for everyone else.
---
Max level PvP has problems too, no question, but that doesn't mean we should judge twinkers any more kindly.
---
That's one of the things keeping mage and warlock down on my list, together with rogue (at least they have 1 or 2 more buttons to press though..)
---
DM? That’s blasphemy
---
In the last few days, I saw several posts calling them private, that's why i got curious
---
Donation money went to the server provider pls get a fuking clue.
---
You see it more on the official forums where more Blizz fanbois hang out.
---
Now I am confused.
---
Screw the blue staff, we're going for the epics
---
I just hit this phase too. Class was easy compared to this. The name is the whole identity.
---
I found my main issue with melee classes is getting the balls to dive into a large group in pvp. Healers can't always be counted on in pvp and it always felt like a death sentence. Range I can be a wimp on the outskirts
---
If my friends and I were to roll alliance I would highly encourage them all to go NE. Having a whole raid sit on Zanzibar Island or Blackrock Mountain in Shadowmeld just to grief raid groups and every week they never know where we’re going to be set up, keeping them constantly on their toes. That’s the dream.
---
So.. Still dwarf pries?
---
Ooga gang, Ooga gang, Ooga gang, Ooga gang
---
Idiot
---
From memory my WotlK-era twink-like toon had something like 1100 or 1200 health and 35% evasion, while a levelling toon of the same level would have less than half that health, do less than half the damage, and have much lower evasion as well. I forget my armour rating but it was probably much higher than that of a typical leveller too.
---
In terms of effective health times DPS, four times is probably a conservative estimate.
---
Cloak of Shadows which is a spell for rogues and their main defencive ability. It's like a get out of jail free card.
---
I don't even know if I should plan on US or EU servers... gimme a break with classes...
---
Underrated comment.
---
I'm sorry, had a brain lag
---
What I find astonishingly hypocritical is that people are freaking out over layer farming whilst at the same time being totally okay with DM lasher farming being in the game. Because if you're concerned about people layer hopping and grabbing some extra devilsaur leather and black lotus, you should be really, really concerned about people farming 100+ gold an hour in an *instance* which is going to lead to rampant inflation.
---
If you want to min max rogue rotation with swing timers its more fun than just keep pressing frostbolt imo
---
True, but that will never happen, ppl care about they'r wallet, not the global economy
---
Yup, we're all just lying. In fact, there never was a beta. It's all just a ruse to make ourselves feel better than everyone else....
---
Donation money went to server host not the nost team plz get a clue.
---
You can’t have layering without layer hopping. It’s not a bug that you’re able to swap layers at will. That doesn’t mean it won’t be abused.
---
You really are a calm Traveler!
---
If it was “temporary” until AQ, would you have the same mentality?
---
It's a 1% difference with 10 weapon skill IIRC
---
Downvoted. All gnome are glorious.
---
Every Wotkl paladin was good paladin. All you do is smash 2 buttons.
---
They already said they will restickt if needed. For example if people recreated a LFG system with a queue system. 
---
All other addons were options we had back than and we will have them again.
---
&gt;Sounds totally unfun to me
---
And to some people they find min-maxing fun.  Don't judge.
---
I believe /world would create a limited channel with a 50 player limit, you need to join LookingForGroup for a proper world LFG chat.
---
&gt; You either;
---
&gt; Have the mentality to become a better player, get better gear and work to become competitive
---
&gt; Have the mentality to be lazy and whine and complain that Blizzard needs to change the game because you don't wan't to put in as much effort as other players.
---
I never cease to be amazed by the self-serving nonsense twinkers come up with.
---
Levlling BGs could be a fun thing to do for levellers in between levelling. Because vanilla was in large part about having fun on the way to sixty rather than being a race to sixty where the fun started.
---
Twinkers are parasites who spoil the levelling BGs for their own amusement. If you get victimised by a twinker and then become one that is not a story about how awesome you are for overcoming adversity, it is a story about how you got bullied and became a bully. You failed the moral test and became as bad as they were.
---
They absolutely do! but don't get me wrong, Frost Mage is THE class/spec you want to roll when you raid with a cold one/ blunt in your hand  ;D
---
I rly didn't think people would take this comment serious it was meant completely as a joke lmao
---
Just because vanilla was one thing for you, doesn't mean it wasn't another for other people...
---
Personally, I just saw leveling as a chore to get to the actual game... once I started hardcore raiding I didn't level another character past 20.
---
I'm all for making WoW available on consoles if it's feasible - Switch, Xbone, PS4 so be it. 
---
I'm sure there would be enough people playing for dedicated servers so console players don't have to run into PC players having disadvantage.
---
It would help both the game and the brand.
---
Now we need private servers that fix all the shitty systems currently in retail.
---
I installed pihole on raspberry pi, everything worked, but zero difference to just using Firefox with addons
---
This is about sharding and incredibly early in where they didn't have things figured out. You are just taking his words completely out of context and saying "this is how it will be!"
---
So just because it’s a temporary measure we should ignore attempts to negate its negative effects?
---
To layer hop, speak to an NPC in starter area or capital city. Is it troublesome, yes. Does it get round abusive hopping, yes.

Freaking out is a good way to let Blizzard know how we feel about it. Most of us understand that they need layering/sharding for healthy realm populations in the long term (it's not really about server load since they could just make more realms and/or have very long queues to deal wiith that), but at the same time we wanna push Blizzard to minimize the adverse effects of it.
---
Sure, you need to get that system fixed. With inferior specs I don't notice any impact from the website at all
---
You are extremely easy to please in that case.
---
It would do no harm whatsoever to add a modest amount of xp to battlegrounds. It would kick out the twinks, and since nobody levels through PvP in vanilla it wouldn't affect anything else at all.
---
What you smoking?
---
That is also one of my biggest gripes with it and actually why I stopped playing druid later on when even for healing I couldn't look at my Nightelf anymore but some ugly mini-tree instead.
---
Our gnome-warrior-maintank who did all this jumping and flipping around while tanking just looked so much more exciting than the ass of that bear.
---
Your post reminding me of that just reduced the likelyness of me rolling druid despite the great kit rather significantly! :o
---
I wanna tank. And I wanna heal. And I wanna see my character. Paladin could be a compromise. But Gnome would be first choice and Nightelf would be second. I also still like mage. Mage is perfect fit for Gnome. I'm also kinda curious about rogue. Priest can't tank but is great for healing. Warlocks seem crazy strong in PvP and can be Gnomes. I'd also love to tank but don't really like any other aspect of being a Warrior... like how hard they are to level. I'd also not rule out Hunter completely.
---
So I just need to decide between one of the 7 classes... or play all of them in parallel. :D
---
But I know that settling with a main has a great advantage too... But on the other hand this time nothing should run away as there's no impending Add-On ruining all the progress and I can eventually catch up.
---
So maybe playing everything is kinda viable.

This is pretty much the only top post in the past month about Nostalrius. I just checked.
---
It doesn't, because the mallet has always been available and doesn't require a quest.
---
It can't, you must be mistaken
---
Everywhere?..
---
I think its a vocal minority, a minority of millions is still a decent noise.  Don't worry about it :)
---
For me, I enjoyed the journey but I distinctly remember being level 52 and all my friends hitting 60 and starting raiding without me.  That was a sad feeling, that final push last 8 levels was brutal especially solo and a total noob, hearing them trying to kill Onyxia etc and I couldn't join, I actually stopped wanting to log in.  They eventually dragged my ass across the finish line (basically ran dungeons with me til cap) and that raiding world opened up and it was beautiful.
---
This time around, all I want to do is play with my friends, that means keeping up with them.  If I beat them to 60 I'll return the favour, but I don't plan to be behind.
---
That’s one solution, but it creates problems of its own. If you’re trying to do x group quest and ask for more people in /1, no one is going to bother spending 30 min flying to a capital city just to join your group if you happen to be on different layers.
---
Go read my responses because nothing you said just now shows me you read anything.
---
Chaotic neutral in its purest form.
---
Theres a difference in min maxing and playstyle... rogues who use sword talents wouldnt use daggers. MINMAXING!!!???

---
Yep, your HoJ example is fair and you will get tanks for rend runs if you're not reserving an item they need too. I still think it's much harder as a rogue though. Barons Cape from strat UD is pretty rough.
---
There's also gonna be alot of warlocks if the polls here are accurate.
---
You missed the best expansion.  Welcome back to Classic friend.
---
Who did you sell it to?
---
Not realistic. Obviously staged.  
---
Never seen that many boomkins at the same time.
---
That's pretty much the same thing just wording it differently.
---
You guys are dumb as fuck, and I look forward to hearing the bitching when Blizzard inevitably does a whole bunch of shit to bilk money out of you and ruins "classic" WoW.
---
Why can’t you? Haven’t heard anything about that
---
Gotta get offended, right?
---
Shit you got me
---
Yeah cuz they never launch new servers or have events where it might be useful again.
---
I bet you $50 there'll be no layering in any 30+ zone after phase 2. If you are so sure they wont turn it off and will have it where it will hurt then that's a good bet for you. PM me to arrange it.
---
Ah yeah I see, I'm not gunna sub to classic but I hope you have fun with it if you do!
---
Pretty sure everyone here is actually just a Guild Wars player just getting on the hype train.
---
Whoop, fellow Turalyon player :) 
---
I really enjoyed PvE too, since I was young and arguably shit at the game I wouldn't have had the skill to survive a PvP server (still don't).
---
Should be warrior. Leveling is hard, very gear dependant, but when warrior gears up - it destroys everything. 
---
Rogues is way less rewarding in terms of gearing.
---
In PvE I actually enjoy all of these roles.
---
But healing and tanking maybe even a bit more than the others because I like the responsibility and the chance of saving difficult situations.
---
In PvP I really dislike being close to the enemy. I hate dying and I feel that by being as far away as possible from as many opponents as possible, I have the highest chance of surviving while still contributing towards my teams goals.
---
I always play after the motto: Go hard or go home!  
---
;)
---
THE CORRECT DATE IS JUNE 19-21 and it does NOT include EU.
---
Hmm. Where you doing some sort of spellpower build? I have a hard time imagining that a 1handed enhancement build could be better than 2handing for damage.
---
might be worth it for leveling tho.
---
The only reason they look “mean” is because theyre super low res/poly and the angles look that way. The majority of new models and animations are much MUCH better than Vanilla. Except night elf males. What the fuck
---
I'm doing 1-30 runs to solve this dilemma once and for all. I did Druid, Priest, and Paladin so far. On to Shaman to reconnect with my Horde roots.
---
Added benefit of decreasing my leveling time as I get better at pathing and reducing downtime.
---
I just realized i spent so much time watching classic streams I never thought about what I wanted to play lmao.

Dartol's Rod of Transformation has an effect that looks like a Holy spell while casting it. Could maybe bait a Kick using that
---
Of course, I wasn't really disagreeing fully, just giving my opinion.
---
Well in UO, you had to hunt chickens for feathers, need an axe to gather logs, these logs get crafted into shafts and then you build arrows.
---
That was actually quite fun. 
---
But you also get the pet and it sounds like a tamagotchi on top of everything.
---
On the other hand I probably imagine it worse, since I played Rogue and you need to keep track of more than just arrows.
---
Poweders and Poisons.
---
this is so true. I never use my switch except for some random Mario Kart at parties. I want to love it but I just never use it. =(
---
Holy hell, never knew! Thanks. Given the level from your screenshot i suspect they existed in Vanilla as well?
---
Since you're oblivious to how bad this talent is, here's a small explanation :
---
Let's say you have around 1300hp when you get this talent (level 2) at level 32. That's a whopping 26 health every 10 seconds. That's 100% of your life every 500 seconds. If you're bad at math this might sound appealing, but unless you're multitasking and pulling multiple mobs at once and switching aggro between your pet and yourself, this talent will only benefit either you, or your pet and basically halves its healing.
---
If the healing is happening on your pet, well it's basically wasted, 5 seconds out of combat regen on your pet is worth at least ten times the amount of healing this talent brings. And lastly, the more dps you get the less damage the enemies deal to you, meaning picking offensive talents will always be better than picking this one talent (armor talent is good because it improves EHP and lowers downtime when killing stuff). This tament is just 2 wasted points.
---
If you read it all and still think this talent is worth anything, congrats you're one of the the reasons people call hunters huntards.
---
My install for the Classic beta was around 5GB iirc.
---
That Tabard 😍😍! NICE
---
Thinking you know better than the tank and continue while he asks you not to make you the jerk.
---
So please dont be the elitist jerk at low level.
---
I've had the same naming scheme for many years. I literally just swap the first letter of the name for all my alts.
---
i think switch is not required , there are a lot of windows tablets that doesnt cost too much , and you can play the same way on them
---
**&lt;BANISH&gt; [A] EU PVP English**
---
**&gt;Schedule&lt;**
---
Raid Times: Tue/Thu/Sun 19:00-23:00 (CET) + Wed on BWL/AQ/Naxx releaseday.
---
**&gt;About Us&lt;**
---
Banish is one of the oldest and longest running private server vanilla raiding guilds – It was founded in 2015 on Nostalrius and is still active on horde Lightbringer now. Over the last four years we have accumulated an active community of the most dedicated and experiences players the vanilla wow scene has to offer. We pride ourselves for our warm atmosphere where people enjoy logging on for more than just killing bosses.
---
**&gt;Experience and Achievements&lt;**
---
With over 59 recorded Kel’Thuzad kills we are arguably the most experienced vanilla guild out there. We are:
---
Clearing MC since September 2015
---
Clearing BWL since January 2016
---
Killing world bosses weekly since March 2017
---
Clearing AQ since June 2017
---
Clearing Naxx since January 2018
---
**&gt;Goals/Expectations&lt;**
---
On release we expect most people to get raid-ready in a timely manner, but acknowledge the social commitments of our members who are unable to do so. From phase three (BWL) onward we will aim for first week, if not first day clears (we will add a Wednesday raid on content releases). After progression we will reclear weekly and cut down on raidtime where possible.
---
To achieve our goals we expect everyone to: - be dedicated and motivated, during and after progression - have full knowledge of raid mechanics and intricacies before entering - bring full consumables, no matter what - have a mature and respectful attitude

As a former Nelf Warrior in vanilla - Wisp form is pretty useless because you end up having to wait around for non-Nelf party members to get back to the instance anyway so you don't save any time.
---
Shadowmeld is great though. But I don't think it's worth the time saved in rep, plus the weaponskill, plus the spirit bonus (yes having spirit as a Warrior is huge while leveling).
---
That’s a yikes from me bro
---
FYI it did not seem to add + resistance set bonus from for example D1 sets.
---
I'm curious.
---
If I die in Teldrassil, can I wisp my way to Deadmines?
---
A friend would like to know that for science.
---
both.
---
Yup, got to 60 in vanilla and got to do like 1 or 2 raids before cap was raised to 70. Sharing a computer with an older brother was rough, especially since he was warrior so needed to grind so hard to get to 60 as well. Not this time around though, it's all mine.
---
From my point of view - any can claim a "best in a world" and if no one else is going to re-claim it, you can accept it as it is. I don't remember anyone else paladin in a world who had intentions to challenge him, so I suppose everyone else was good to be second.
---
become a weeb and you will understand, my son. That is the only way.

The bridge in AV during an alliance turtle.
---
At least you'd always have a raid spot I guess
---
Failing that, you could always respec to Holy 🤷‍♀️
---
We arnt talking about bfa here cleansing 1 root or conc shot or any slow for that matter once a minute will be super value in classic and will win u many fights u had no reason winning gnome is the master warrior race 4sure and dwarf actually being able to reset consistently on rogue is huge I guess I can agree with nelf for leveling but in endgame u will miss the rep from human or the power of the other 2 races for certain classes in pvp
---
Hearthstones are good for baiting kicks if you need to land a healing spell.

I stared at bear ass from vanilla to wotlk until I couldn't take it anymore. Love druid but 3 expansion of the same ass ruined it for me
---
It is emotions that make us feel being alive and not just existing.
---
Without the fear and anger that PvP-servers provide you with you are missing out on at least two of them!
---
There are barely any abilities at level 19. It's like playing the game on child mode.
---
I think it’s from the Un’goro goblin escort

ok if you say so
---
While living the Ret dream? Sign me up, I don't care to be a benchmark, haha
---
Really nice website I must say! I just have some minor feedback: 
---
- Aggregated armor values are not shown
---
- There is no way to change the sorting order when using multiple EP presets (ideally I would like to be able to toggle which EP preset it should sort by)
---
- I would also like some way to save the filter so I don't have to uncheck the raid item suggestions for every slot.
---
Humans and Night Elves cannot ride Mechanostriders.
---
Tauren cannot ride Raptors or Skeletal Horses.

Good. Now I hope they dont raise the drop rates just cuz ppl qq.

I’ve always loved melee dps, and my biggest envy comes from seeing a decked out 2h warrior/paladin/shaman. This time I’m going to roll holy pally and heal. Never been much of a healer but by all accounts paladin is pretty easy as raid healer.
---
This should not be underestimated! Yes, you technically can ride a raptor as an orc but the effort is so huge that depending on how important that mount is to you, you should probably consider rolling a troll instead.

The thing is you shouldn't take away from some players. Even if it is the meta be in a guild built around not using them. If you don't want to use them then don't or find a guild that doesn't want to use them. Don't take that shit away from people who do want to play like that.
---
&gt; I hope they do something about this on the live classic servers.
---
They could add phas... ahem... layering.
---
Presumably because night elves are all a few thousand years old? I guess? 
---
I don't know why he didn't just say cougar though
---
Layer hopping is going to cause no lasting damage, I really don't see the issue.
---
If you don't state it's your opinion, you're stating things as facts. Deal with it.
---
Started watching Scrubs. I think it came on TNT? or TBS? Or something was showing its re-runs. IIRC the first episode I saw was one where JD was dating Tara Reid. Ended up watching it out of order for years until I got Netflix and caught up around 2011.
---
Honestly screw the ping, it's completely playable if the servers are east coast for a EU player like me. I get 100-120ms to the east coast.
---
I'd love to play a EU+NA server, some of the best times I've had on pservers is when those two regions mix.
---
I don’t get it. I just see two cows...
---
I don’t get 1h enh spd builds (in pve). A staff has comparable spd but more weapon dps at the same time. The only time you would go 1h is for the Hand of Edward the Odd procs, which is super fun btw.
---
It's almost as if other people like other things, astonishing! ^(/s sorry for the snarky remark, haha)
---
But in all seriousness, I am one of those guys with a boner for Paladins. It might not have the most APM, but its role is to do mediocre damage while supporting your group with instants &amp; auras, the former you can weave within auto attacks. Personally I find that very interesting gameplay. Also, I find Paladins have the most interesting lore driven mechanics, along with Warlocks and Druids. Finally there is the flexibility to switch between heal/DPS whenever I want, but I am a Ret at heart. Classic content will not be extremely hard (at least at the level that I aim to play with my 6 hours of playtime *per week*) so I  hope to find a guild that is mature enough to understand my background and can see that relative to the content they are doing.
---
That statement was enough,  that's all it should take.  Frankly after telling you not to use it, my go to follow up is a kick for being an idiot
---
What? Only one person gets the herb
---
I mean technically both the NA and EU servers are already international.
---
Every solution has its downsides. Another alternative would be a 30mins or so cool down on layer changing. 
---
But, it may not be as big a problem as imagined. Who knows?
---
My bad. What I meant to say was, there's a limit to how good you can be at casting flash of light.
---
What a stupid straw man argument.

---
Leveling is the thing that gets me excited about Classic. I plan to level as a survival hunter trying to prove those warriors and rogues that hunters are not hopeless once you're meleeing them.
---
Most toxic streamers are NA. I'm good on EU.
---
There was even an addon where you bound one key and it put whatever was at the front of your rotation.

You could actually raid ICC 25H as a Ret Paladin with one button.

" I love healing but then moan it takes me 4 days to kill anything and that im squishy in cloth"
---
Priests can be pretty tanky in healing spec. Problem solved ? ;)
---
I always assumed it meant minimize low priority stats while maxing on more important ones. Like in DnD a min-maxer would have only 2-3 good stats while the rest would be average at best.
---
If we're talking about literally saying things like that...Then it is still weird even today to say 'lol', 'lmao' or any of it.
---
You can type it, but if you're literally saying it out loud, you will be judged. By everyone who heard you.
---
If anything, not having flasks for every encounter will make the content *more* challenging.
---
So, to borrow your figure of speech, imagine needing flasks to turn raids into easymodo.
---
Often those polls doesn't take faction into account. I would be fairer to the results to double the paladin and shaman percentage to get a hunch of what the actual percentage might be, although not an exact number.  
---
This image shows the big classicwow poll results filtered for each faction and then displayed the class results. Shaman/paladins have always been popular classes.

Similarly though a lot of people here who get off on playing a "superior" game. Lots of toxicity all around. Just like the old days.
---
Stomping randoms with prems will make you burn out fast. It's not fun. You may get your gear but at what cost? And the gear is really not that important if you have a good prem anyway. The question is what will you do if you are geared out? Afk in if?

A fast 1h means more fire weapon procs along with searing totem is just as good, and more reliable damage than waiting on random wf procs and crits. Didn't focus on spellpower at all though it certainly wouldn't hurt.

I also think bringing a ret paladin over a second of whatever the guy above you said is a good idea. Sure, you can bring another DPS and try to avoid fuckups, but people are always trying to avoid fuckups, so that doesn't add much in case there *is* a fuckup. I always try to not wipe, but when we do I like there to be a Divine Intervention on a player with ress capability to avoid a lengthy corpserun (*looking at you BRD*) , a clutch LoH on the tank when the healer got CC'ed by accident or a BoP on an overzealous DPS catching threat. I do think an additional focused DPS class would make a perfectly executed dungeon run faster than with a hybrid DPS, but sometimes things just do not go perfect.
---
And of course he doesn't reply lol.
---
I still have an owl on my level 82 hunter that I made in vanilla what’s wrong with an owl
---
What exactly did he say? Maybe I can decode tank speak for you
---
Average time to get to 60 is usually around 240 hours. Provided you are not a hardcore leveler and speedrunner with pre-planned and pre-trained routes, that's pretty much how much it would take you to get there solo, give or take 50 hours. Now, considering that you are 3 people, you will have to share all the drops when it comes to collecting-quests (and there are a lot of them, with atrocious drop rates), and that will increase your time spent significantly. You would be killing mobs faster, yes - but they won't be respawning faster (especially if you have other competition in the area). All of that will add up. And while you may be leveling together, not all of you will be taking breaks at the same time, so you might be stuck idling for some time as well (Let's not forget the shaman quests at 10/20/30, that can take up to 2 hours to complete, in which time I'm guessing you guys will be afk?). Even if you consider farming dungeons, the fact that you'd be missing 2 more DPS will slow you down when killing mobs inside.
---
My point is, 45 with a mount in 3 days /played is very optimistic for a party of 3. Realistically I'd see you guys entering STV at 30-31 by the end of your fifth day. I'd be more inclined to say it's doable if you were solo, though.
---
The water canteen when you escort the goblin from the volcano area back to the camp. You need to use it to refresh him.
---
This video has been posted at least 3 times the last 24 hours
---
they are dramatising it. in fact it won't affect most of us maybe only the hardcore neckbeards that leveled max to 60 to farm expensive loot by layerhopping.
---
&gt;Leveling was THE game
---
It's not all of the game. 
---
But I think a lot of people are a bit tainted by end-game in later expansions, and assume classic will be the same. If you're actually good at the game and play a lot, then specifically raiding is a relatively small and unimportant part of what you do once you reach 60. Classic raids aren't challenging enough to take up most of your time playing. 
---
So I agree that it's pretty silly min-maxing your entire WoW character for raiding. But at the same time I like discussing those sort of things, because unlike PvP for example it's a lot easier to theorycraft (or whatever you want to call it) PvE.
---
Just go to logicalincrements.com
---
Maybe they can do a $20 classic sub that comes without BFA. Like that time I paid a couple extra bucks to get Conan the Barbarian by inself, instead of getting the cheaper combo pack that came with Conan the Destroyer. Worth a couple bucks to not own the sequel.
---
This is actually a pro for me since I'm new to vanilla. I'd rather be able to autopilot my rotation so that I can focus on raid leading and/or watch TV or a second monitor at the same time.
---
And you're an asshole. Just FYI, from a bystander. Fuck you.
---
Absolutely, and those trying to farm expensive loot by layerhopping between four layers will find themselves up against four times the competition.
---
Not sure if the link is allowed, but there is a random class and race creator.
---
Try this one :D
---
&gt;They also went to blizzard and did all they could for this to happen
---
Well they were the only people who were invited to go, they're still only a small part of the many people who've tried to provide us with classic throughout the years.
---
I recently rewatched his very first video.
---
It is apparent that he knew what he was talking about and mentioned some actually smart ways of playing.
---
However, the way he "showcased" his skill in the video was absolutely hilarious! :D
---
Come out to plaaaaay
---
anyone have a link to download classic? i have slow internet and dont think ill be able to download in time to play a lot ☹️
---
Just gotta  try harder, i guess ;)
---
Not quite exactly. TBC and vanilla were decently similar but there was at least 1 large change to gear requirements and that happened with pvp. Once seasonal pvp gear was rolled out we saw the first change where the gear immersion wasn’t at your own pace and there was a catch-up mechanic. Now that might not have effected raiding all that much but for me that’s where the big change that vanilla has at its core differed. You could rock a conglomerate of gear and it be BiS or competitive from different raid tiers. BC has this and Wotlk somewhat but by those points it was more on accident.
---
*summons Succubus*
---
Inb4 people tell you that 100ms is unplayable
---
warriors didn't need to be prot to tank, i was a rogue in vanilla but will be rolling a warrior with hybrid ms or fury/prot build for farming and raiding, main reasoning, i remember how time consuming it was to get a group for 5 mans as a dps before lfd, hopefully as a tank i'll get to play through a lot more of the content without relying on my friends who might not be playing this time around.
---
YES
---
Plays classic wow but claims he doesn't have hours of free time...

Alright, listen to me you knife eared piece of shit.

I'm gonna flagellate you with my fucking beard! I'm gonna build you a pair of runic mechanical balls, and use surgical precision to sew them to your groin where your manhood ought to be just so that I can kick them with my iron fucking feet, you twat!

"immersive gameplay"
---
I mean it's kindof *not* try-hard by definition. Nothing against it or anything, people that do this are generally pretty chill people, but they certainly aren't try-hard.
---
&gt; I mean there are a lot of people over in /r/wow who want classic to fail.
---
Yeah, but they don't get upvoted by the rest of the sub.
---
This post again nice will it be in competition of the constant layering drama posting?
---
No, I'm poor.

Ice barrier. Fishing with Arc Explosion is a good way to do it. I personally just hoped to get lucky on a Blizzard, CoC or Nova.

Conc is very very useful
---
Private servers after Nost were pretty much carbon copies of the real game and doesn't crash at all. The only real difference is stats of mobs and bosses which they had to make qualified guesses on.
---
You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.
---
Worth mentioning that all can ride an "undead" horse. Even tauren and alliance. The one that drops in stratholme
---
Ive been pvping as a rogue since vanilla and retri since wotlk. Both melee but with wastly different playstyles.   
---
I would love to be the one kiting, sniping and making mages suffer the slow death and shame of being torn to pieces by a boar and a bow.  
---
Maybe as an alt in Classic.
---
They also have a set procs per minute so having faster weapons won't cause more procs
---
I am a horrendous alotholic. The closest thing to a main I have in BFA is Hunter and I love melee Survival (dont hurt me) so Im not sure all ranged Hunter in Classic is for me :/  
---
Right now Im looking at:
---
\-Shadow Priest because the class fantasy is so good and I dont care about raiding
---
\-Shaman for those juicy windfury procs and the diversity of the class  
---
\-Hunter cause I usually have a hunter...
---
\-Rogue because I adore undead rogues...
---
Part of the charm. Makes for a whole different meta compared to just a few levels later. All classes have their distinct core abilities so they are all viable in one way or another, and consumables and gear sets will make more of a difference. Shield Spike redoubt 19 paladins with Lifestealing on their Shadowfang can swap it out for a 3/3 of the Eagle green mace with +55 healing and suddenly start healing as if that's their spec. Bandages that heal you to full HP are a difference of life and death.
---
But you're right, there's very few abilities. It's the reason why I think 39 is more fun than 29, and 29 more fun than 19. But there's better queues at 19 because there's way more people twinking there than anywhere else. Makes it more competitive. And the lack of mounts or any speed increase (besides minor speed on boots) makes for very interesting matches.

Even if theres no official RPPVP realm, one will exist.
---
It is, but depends on what you are doing.  
---
Back in vanilla I generally played with like 20 - 50 ms, and approaching 100 was basically unplayable (for PvP).
---
Yea he was actually pretty good. 
---
Obviously he was over-hyping how good he was a bit, but yea he was a top tier player at the time.
---
All the Apes players seems to be doing just fine with pvping on the beta... Sounds like skill issue for you.
---
2g per summon you fr? Its a part of your class that makes you unique and useful to your group. Idk if it was a joke but no guild is gonna be cool with that
---
Undetectabull
---
Or hunter or maybe even warrior, or shaman.
---
This sort of thing is why Classic pvp is so cool
---
The ones that win
---
time != skill
---
Maybe they decided not to make any money of the service because of legal reasons, it's one thing to run the server public but it's something completely different making money doing it.
---
I would be very surprised if they were able to get the server running, and didn't have the connections to get free hosting.
---
My manager used to play WoW for a short period. So he knew what i was talking about. No need to cover myself up. Just straight-up told him, i'm playing Classic WoW for a week lol.
---
It took me over three hours to log in for the first one, about two for the second one. This time, a lot more people will be part of the test. If you can’t get in, just keep trying. While it will eventually be fun to play, it is still a stress test. We need to help test in hopes there will be no issues come launch.
---
Not true at all. And if there has been a shift in attitude towards Classic it's been a very recent thing since all the method crew and other high profile people jumped onto it. 
---
"Oh the streamer I watch that said classic would be shit, has now changed his mind?"
---
Except that you cant layer hop into different layer.
---
Since when does anyone go into playing alts to max them out in Vanilla?
---
That is an unreasonable target for alts since there is a chance you won't ever "max out" your main in the first place.
---
But it is quite possible to have decent gear on 3 characters if you invest the time. I managed that in Vanilla but now I have more time restraints due to responsibilities.
---
Grinding mobs while pooping.  
---
Probably the best efficiency to level up.
---
Pally for playing with friends, pocket healer for pvp and all my friends that go warrior and getting dungeons done.  Solo though..... torn between lock, mage or hunter, or all three.
---
Ive prepared my phone to play wow. Steam Controller and app. There are some good presets made for classic that makes it pretty great to controll once you memorize the controlls
---
You can, the spirit healer won't be shown on your map but yes you can do that.
---
this some 4chan masochist shit

News flash
---
I played a lot versus Athene in 5v5 as I was the owner and Hunter of one of the highest rated 5v5 teams from S2 to WotLK.
---
There was a noticeable difference in his performance from occasion to occasion, the reason behind this was to my knowledge because his friend played on his paladin a lot in the arena and he was a lot better then Athene even though he did not main paladin. 
---
Athene was imo a decent paladin player, nowhere near the other world top players but he might have been able to play on a 2k-2.2k 5v5 team, not a world top though. 
---
We exclusively nuked Athene every single match we played vs him as he did not have the reaction time to bubble when needed, and even if he did he did not LoS our priest. 
---
If I remember correctly he was carried by glamour both in pve and pvp and they would have been a lot scarier in 5v5 if they would play with any of the top 5 palas on the server.
---
 So tldr; he was far better then avarage, but most definitely not world top tier.
---
you forgot about the 1 % dodge. It's good

Also i only play humans, because I'm horribly, horribly racist.

You can make yourself the white soul helm. it is pretty good pre diremaul.

I would buy a switch and play it.

shaman/druid can cast hearthstone to force a counterspell

For me I would take a Hunter so they can kite all the mobs away from me but screw playing a hunter.

Me playing druid, sees a warrior with huge axe. 
---
Me: damn wish my weapon looks that fancy
---
Me logs out, plays warrior, sees a kitten running around, slashing things. 
---
Me: damn wish i were that kitten
---
Me playing mage, sees a warlock, rotting mobs and running. 
---
Me: damn wish i can just rot and watch everyone die
---
Me logs out plays lock, sees a mage critting big a mob next to mine, while me waiting for dots to tickle. Me logs out
---
Me playing shaman, sees hunter that just afks while pet tanking 2 mobs. 
---
Me: damn wish i was that chill and easy to level. Me logs out, plays hunter. 
---
Me: LOOK AT ALL THE THINGS I HAVE TO MANAGE. PET FOOD, SELF FOOD, ARROWS, PET LEVEL, PET CONTROL, PET MACROS FOR ALL CCS.
---
All theese details dont really bother me that much, I just want the vanilla gameplay really... Kinda cool to see anyway :) Even thoe Im no retail fan, I think I prefer the new one anyway.
---
Good tips, but I would also like to add some of my own, inspired by Mr C.Montgomery Burns
---
I'll keep it short and sweet. 
---
Family. Religion. Friendship. These are the demons you must slay if you wish to get ahead in levelling. When instancing knocks, you don't want to be driving to the maternity ward, or stuck in some phoney-baloney church. Or SYN-A-GOGUE.
---
It's not impossible, a Nintendo switch is probably more powerful then  2004 era computer. 
---
Like high end systems at the time were single core shits with 256 megs of vram. 
---
The switch could probably run classic well.
---
Streamlined, as in made it so you don't actually have to do anything.
---
I agree. Most other classes already feel kinda usefull even with subpar gear. But for a Warrior there is the biggest difference in terms of being a wimp in greens and an unstoppable wrecking ball in epics.
---
Of course the others also get stronger as they gear up. It's just not that huge of a difference.
---
&gt; Something interesting to note is that 7734 (its listed item number here on Wowhead, and I'm assuming in game as well) when entered into a calculator and turned upside down reads "hell" :) 
---
That's next level item dedication.
---
I'm leaning towards disc/holy priest, but get random panics that raid healing will be boring and I should go YOLO PvP Frost Mage. Or maybe Affliction Warlock O.o
---
But I've always liked the idea of priests and played melee throughout Vanilla so no rogue fantasy from me. And hunters never appealed beyond playing pet Pokemon.
---
Wow hasn’t been a leader for years. League, CSGO, steam games, etc have it one upped.
---
What reward would you get other than fun?
---
Mate, please , I’m talking to you on an individual level here . Do not ever in any context use the phrase “dude” it’s just god it’s so fucking cringe man

“Playable” meaning running around killing boars.
---
It has made my final 4. Giving it some serious consideration   
---
Yeh, at the moment im stuck between   
---
Dwarf Priest,  Dwarf Hunter, Dwarf Paladin and Gnome Warlock.  
---
Im a little concerned about lack of offensive capability, but also curious about exploring a disc build. I love having mana burn also. I hate the slow kill speed as healing specs but thats a curse of raiding which i couldnt sensible expect to avoid
---
Yes  every day less and less people log in.
---
Paladin for me, no doubt in my mind
---
I see the word paladin so I have to come up with a funny joke xDDDD
---
Now that Classic is real and "cool"? Maybe...  
---
You should see all the hate before and some time after the announcement.  
---
Ever heard of "The Wall of No"?
---
Because spending 2 hours looking for 3 more people to do molten core was very fun.
---
Personally, I'm all for add-ons that customize your UI, bags, track your stats (g/hr, exp/hr).
---
I'd prefer a ban on all add-ons that trivialise content or directly affect gameplay. Why? Because I'm weak. If there's an add-on that'll make it easier for me I'll use it. If I don't, I won't have the same competitive advantage. But as it'll make the game easier it'll direct the way I play the game - instead of exploring I'll be following an arrow or a minimal. Instead of socializing I'd be forced to group using a tool. My enjoyment would be less, the game would be easier. 
---
Ultimately, the easy content will bore me and I'll quit like (I presume) many others will after the initial run. 
---
I'll do my best to restrain my use of add-ons to get the most out of the game, but I'd still fear people quitting or finding the game dull based on their use of tools to make it an easy ride. 
---
Don't believe me? Read up on flow theory.
---
No, playable for everything except high end raiding and probably healing.
---
Human Male running was absolutely destroyed. Same for Male Orcs to some extent, which was my go to's for each side. I also thought the extremely pronounced animations of combat was inferior to the originals.
---
Its like you're in my mind
---
Cant you just make an undead and start at the orc starting area tho? Im using undead as an example because I have no idea how orc/troll rep works. Dont they start in the same area, like gnomes and dwarves?
---
A, B, X and Y, then modifiers with R, ZR, L, ZL. That is 20 keys and all quite easily accessible. You can even argue that those 20 are more ergonomically accessible than on a keyboard.
---
Arrows with modifiers gives an additional 20. While not useable while also moving those can be consumables, mounts, etc.
---
I can see it working perfectly fine.
---
He’s talking about furbolgs (however you spell it) haha
---
Some levels later:  
---
\*Warrior: No, you can't have Zin'rokh, it's warr prio even though I'm gonna toss it to the garbage in a month's time and you are going to keep it forever.
---
Feeling triple the delay on you abilities compared to normal is in no way a skill issue. It just feels disgusting.   
---
I suppose you're the kind of person that thinks playing timing sensitive games (fighting games for example) on WiFi is acceptable as well.
---
I thought owls were the best pet after all was said and done? Prior to ZG bats?
---
He's talking about the guys in pugs who see a lock and automatically alt tab out expecting a summon once the rest get the entrance.
---
Its toxic to think of classic as a superior game?
---
As far as i remember, Wrath was the last expansion using the original talent tree style (being able to spec 41/30/0 etc).
---
One contributing factor at least.
---
its the faces of the new tauren that are weird and look like they were designed for a children's book, not the back of their heads.
---
No but wow isn't a time sensitive game so
---
Pretty good.
---
Min-maxing is the character-building strategy of maximizing a specific desirable ability, skill, or other power of a character and minimizing everything else, seen as undesirable.
---
Maxing best qualities, minimizing bad.
---
Gnomes have advantages in being a caster (higher int) than another race. So most will choose them over other races for mages.
---
I think I've been quite polite in this thread. I'm sorry I offended you, no need to insult me.
---
congrats on the promotion. don't worry a lot of us will be behind because irl stuff lol
---
How do you reserve a name is they don’t even know what servers are going to be up yet?
---
I think people don't like to put it the time investment because the servers would be wiped.
---
Cat still had them to a degree. It was altered slightly but you still had the good talent trees iirc
---
At least at the start
---
That is a weird way of spelling "ruined"
---
You seem like you want a catch all spec that you can just play the game with and never have to respec.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#of0VZZVAMcsftNo
---
Clearcasting is good in all cases, especially when you are paying attention to your procs and using it on your more mana heavy spells. 
---
You can raid with this and be the permafrost mage. 5 mans this is fine. AOE farming this is fine as well. Clearcasting is obvs good all content. In farming it's certainly useful to fish for clearcasting procs and then using the proc to cast max rank blizzard or cone of cold. 
---
Mages are just strong in PvP in general, you will be fine there.
---
Playing PVE server is missing half the game for me.
---
Correct, they aren't thought out I wanted to understand other peoples views before deciding what I thought. Is that a crime? You seem very angry.
---
That would be amazing though.
---
True, but it still feels absolutely disgusting, which is the point. You can play and do ok, but it feels so bad you want to not play.

Night shift raiding

LF raiding guild that raids between 00:00-06:00 Tuesday - Friday up-to 4 nights available to raid
---
Ive played since vanilla and clear all content up to AQ40 twin emperors as Healer/DPS. Want to join a friendly guild that wants to clear content at a good pace and have fun doing so.
---
Looking to play as a warrior tank or shaman healer
---
&gt;
---
I love tank classes and builds, but then cry when the bigger boys bully me in pvp
---
I love healing but then moan it takes me 4 days to kill anything and that im squishy in cloth
---
I love the variety in dedicated dps' classes but hate only being able to do one role in a group
---
I love hybrids and multi-rolling but hate being outclassed by dedicated/primary role class
---
👏👏 100% in the same boat. 
---
I played rogue then paladin then finished vanilla with warlock...
---
This time around I'm split between mage, prot warrior, priest.
---
Big thing that has me fucked up is the phases. I don't know if I want to level my prot warrior first and start gearing him and slowly level a mage... or start with a mage and get him geared while slowly leveling a warrior.
---
It's tough to decide but I know I want prot warrior since thunderclap is one of my favorite abilities. I also enjoy mabe gameplay across the board.
---
Every expansion launch the question was - "Do I really want to be a dps and have to wait to find a tank?"
---
As the expansions went on it became easier to find tanks and healers, but damn I remember not playing a tank in Vanilla and waiting forever, going to the dungeon and just having the group fall apart.
---
Yep I'm in this boat
---
My time is really limited and im going pvp server. this inst a reason.
---
It gave me a reason to play WoW Classic
---
The patch notes
---
Cool, thanks
---
What should i google for Vanilla? Im Fully prepared with spreadsheets and co... i just wait until realease thats all. 
---
I was looking yesterday for twich, it said 55k... before classic it was maybe at 5k.
---
1440p 165hz has ruined me
---
Then get banned for botting
---
Lol kinda true get ur point :)
---
+1
---
Why is that a bad thing?
---
Set drops of choice, so you can get your T set for your preferred spec and less waste.
---
But if you think different please add your opinion
---
"new models will mess with perception of the game" Jesus you guys are like a cult.
---
The hype is still there, people are just not that into watching the exact same thing over and over again in videos/streams.
---
Thank you for the insight mate, then I will never min max. I prefer to enjoy Vanilla with my favorite classes/specs even if they are not the best in terms of raiding or open world pvp, that's what I will do. In addition, I also have a life like most people here just to play Vanilla under those tryharding conditions.
---
I did this a lot back in the day and never got any bad rep from it outside BG’s. Most people can’t be bothered to actually slander your name 24/7.
---
2 sets of talent spec, for raid and rest of the game
---
I think that means "yes I want a PvP battle even if you're 20 lvl higher than me"
---
Can't remember bears, only furbolgs
---
This is so long man. The wait is killing me.
---
I raided in Vanilla but my guild was very casual and never got very far. We only tried Razorgore twice before TBC came out. I am quite looking forward to hopefully being able to see all the content as it was "meant" to be.
---
I'm also content with the idea of mechanically easier and more simplistic raiding. I played a bit in Legion and I found it quite annoying how everything was an ADHD action-fest. Maintaining a rotation, watching for procs constantly, seeing and hearing DBM warning about yet another insta-kill or potential raid wiping thing every 10 seconds. It was just a mess of boss fight mechanics all over the place. Maybe it would have been interesting if you could treat it like a puzzle game and figure it out yourself, but the entire fight puzzle was already solved and you're just repeating some script.
---
Naturally that's going to be the same with classic raiding too, but at least I can relax a lot more while fighting the bosses.
---
Is he as good as tips tho?
---
I was wondering about something and didn't think it was worth making a threat, so Ill Just dump my question here.
---
Is it worth taking a profession besides skinning at launch? I figure the servers will be packed so any mining deposits of flowers will be pretty much non-existend. Or will layering fix this problem?
---
Huh, I guess that would work at least a few times
---

Laptop?  Should really choose a PC unless mobility is your main focal point.
---
Not saying good or bad but what is the reasoning behind that most likely?
---
U play paladin?
---
&gt;If any of these assumptions is not true you will end up with overpopulated servers, dead servers, server merges, servers where layering cant be turned off etc.
---
They've dealt with these issues in the past and will do the exact same thing when it comes to October/November when they close layers... they will have time to fix servers between removing layering and launching phase 2.
---
It's just a matter of what will they do with servers that have 20k population (streamer servers) that doesn't want to transfer to a dead server or sit in a 6 hour queue?
---
Paladin - everyone thinks that they know whats good and viable even though they never touched a paladin in 15 years
---
No one wants to watch 72 hours of Alterac Valley. Itll pick back up this week.
---
I wonder if it is powerful enough to handle a raid? I mean, if you are playing whack a mole and the thing can handle raiding without lag... I'm in.
---
Apparently we are both [right](https://www.grammar-monster.com/plurals/plural_of_lotus.htm). And since I learmed a bit of latin loti is my plural of choice.
---
It will be bawls.
---
Druid, or paladin? Or maybe a warrior?
---
The music in retail wow sounds incredible. The Argus soundtrack for example is a master piece
---
yup! &lt;3
---
Different people wanting different things is not the same as being toxic, not saying there is no toxic people but i think the majority is happy playing their game and perfectly fine with both version existing.
---
Healing is completely unplayable in the console port in ANY timely fashion. The target selecting tends to be more erratic and always targets someone else. Target cycling for tanking sucks major monkey nutz as well.
---
&gt; TBC and and beyond is entirely different from classic. 
---
TBC is actually not different from vanilla / classic in this regard, in fact TBC dungeons punish mistakes more heavily than Vanilla dungeons ever did.
---
My Vanilla experience is that you rarely find players capable of screwing up so hard that the pull isn't recoverable. The only problem here is mentally inflexible tanks not understanding the game doesn't have to revolve around aggro when you're not fighting immunes (and even then they can typically be kited in a pinch).
---
Realistically all a tank has to do in regular dungeons is be above healers on the aggro table on non-controlled mobs. That's a trivial matter regardless of how bad the pull is.
---
God you're stupid.
---
After all you wrote I can clearly say what to play for you:
---
You play a druid, on the faction you like most.
---
I think it may be the diversity off playstyle you are looking for. Healer required for dung? Yes I am a druid. Tank required for dun? yes I am a druid. or just DD? Well you have a catform. You just have problems with that if you are really into raiding late game, in classic you are forced to do healer, and the cool leather feral stuff is first picked by rogues.
---
If you truly wanna be that one guy that (you have to play it well obviously) can handle every situation in (W)PVP, PVE you definately should play a druid.
---
As druid you will have the best lvling expierence (after being a hunter) and you must consider that lvling is a very long part of the classic experience! 
---
And druid in PvP is so dope, just look at the stormlingxs videos on youtube, you can beat everyone with decent gear by beeing so flexible and situational...
---
So this all make me most envious of playing a druid.
---
What make me stop playing a druid?
---
Well first of all I dont like lvling and running around as a cat, or bear without seeing my character and gear on it. So this is also a very personal reason. Also I am more into fighting melee..and cat is outfought by rogues and enhshamis/ even warris
---
Warrior isnt my choice due to the long and painful lvling process, so I will be picking Rogue since I do a littel more dps. The downside will be hard situations on lvling too, best way would be picking a hunter then, but
---
In your opinion
---
When I first started playing at the end of vanilla and I saw a rogue in full T2 bloodfang ive wanted to have it since. Transmog is fine but it will be fun to earn it for myself.
---
With the time it takes to travel already (while I love open world pvp) I just can't justify being able to play solo on pvp servers. I'm not talking 100% solo, but when I want to go farm some mats or just fish - I don't want to be 100% on all the time anymore. Maybe I'm just too old.
---
I can't see anything wrong with helping those who help others. Its basically a simple thought but it works. Mages/druids/locks they are buffing their hearts out and I'm helping them stay alive. No charge just my good tidings and a bit extra hp.
---
Thottbot, = retail twitch
---
I. Want. This.
---
Didn't say it was, seems convenient tbh.
---
Smoking pserver, dude, they're the best thing ever
---
Looks really sweet! I would definitely use it. :) Hope you can make it work for some alliance guides.
---
drinking takes 20 seconds, and you didn't always get oom between packs, only after the really tough ones or accidental pulls. otherwise you could heal maybe even three packs before oom.
---
also you don't need a full 40 man raid for mc.
---
The entire changing 15 year experience from which I've had mountains of fun and I freely admit that how much I chose to play the game has affected my enjoyment of it.
---
I kinda like pet battles, they don't really hurt the game, achievements can be fun, I'm gonna miss dual talents specially as a priest, brawlers guild and some newer bgs are pretty cool, arenas are cool although I wish they were made differently without an instanced map (kinda like gurubashi arena where everyone could see, but I do understand the limitations), some newer zones and quest chains are pretty dope, gems and some newer professions are fun too, I feel like fishing became more relevant towards wotlk, etc
---
I have seriously thought about how to make wow work on the switch, your skill bar is 4 buttons and holding the triggers can alternate from different sets of 4 buttons.  If anyone knows how to port this over to a switch I would be extremely grateful.
---
They said 2-3 for the first couple and 3-4 for the rest
---
Isn’t it touch screen? I feel like that will help. Definitely won’t be as effective as KB &amp; M but I think it could be doable. At least it would be useful for grinding resources or something while away from the computer.
---
Naxx is difficult either way and tanks need flasks on patchwerk.
---
Resto Shaman, they heal
---
Man I can leave wow head sitting in the background no problem. I'm using Firefox with unlock origin. Hell sometimes I have StarCraft tabbed out whilst playing a bit of wow too.
---
I'm using an Asus Zephyrus GM501GS.
---
Something is seriously wrong with your setup if lags just from a website sitting in the background.
---
I agree, would be very convenient for gathering resources or something while waiting in a line or something.
---
Neat
---
Totally disagree, imo it makes the ge adapt to you and not you to the game which is the way I think it should be.
---
Those are two of the big bonuses to playing a Mage.
---
I kept waiting for feathers to start to fly,
---
 No. Reddit is a vocal minority of the entire player base
---
I’m tempted to play in English, to force myself to learn English better. I’m from Spain :)
---
How do reserving work anyway? It wasn't a thing when I played (or at least I never encountered it). Do people just go to master loot for the one fight?
---
I dont know if this is good or bad, I stay neutral here :)
---
This is correct.
---
Just lock players from jumping layers - they move because of getting invited? Great they are stuck to that layer for an hour or four.
---
Yeah I know.
---

No different than someone complaining about their wireless mouse/keyboard from Walmart running out of battery.
---
Oh wait, it is different! The Switch guy has a battery indicator.
---
Hype always dies down after huge surges. That is the nature of hype (in fact, trying to keep hype rolling at the same intensity for 3 months is impossible and they'd look silly for even trying).
---
All they need to do is ramp back up a week or two before launch. A cool, new cinematic might help with that.
---
Good ponit from my wife: Even if you spec walrus, you can't become horse thief.
---
Objective reality. The game has gotten progressively worse as times gone on.
---
The absolute longest it can last is phase 1. The second phase 2 hits and DM comes out with world bosses it will be gone guaranteed. 
---
It's not that long even in the worst case scenario.
---
Paladins want them for pvp bucko
---
Not sure how you mean, could be my lack of english haha :)
---
Rogues arent that popular as they were back in the day, one reason being that people know they were popular. The polls and and pservers suggest this too
---
If you're not a tank and you're getting parried then if the boss doesn't kill your raid leader fuckin will
---
if race availability means anything for class population it makes sense to see the most warriors because every race can roll it. And rogue comes in second by having every race available except tauren
---
What made you quit after just one week?
---
Wrong again buddy. 
---
Youre too lazy to research so you dont deserve to be explained too.
---
It will only be nerfed with massive amounts of feedback. The No Changes additude is good intentioned, yet I feel we're just setting up to repeat a mistake here. I intend to main a hunter and will stand to benefit greatly from DM. Yet I'd probably agree to nerf it if it was my call.
---
Ahahhaha is this copy pasta?
---
The writing is on the inside of the jacket. And 99% of the times the cufflinks are practically unnoticed, but when they do get seen, they can be a nice conversation starter.
---
generally speaking the offtank having NF is probably better than a ret.
---
One of my favorite benefits is how it gives you more time to return before mobs respawn. So not only do you travel faster, you also spend less time killing the same mobs over and over.
---
Majority yes. Vocal minority on both bfa and classic fanbases hope for the failure of the other
---
Well we dont know how long phase 1 will be. Could be 3 months or 8 months, no know knows. My guess would be 4 to 6 months but who knows...
---
It's going to be rough with hundreds if players doing the same quests as 3 of you - essentially grinding isn't a great option since there are 3 of you (at least until there are packs you can farm) 
---
But if you guys are going to quest 100% the quests within the first two zones will add hours to get done.
---
That being said - 14 hours a day will put you guys in a good position to catch up and get ahead of the pack. Mid 30s is pretty reasonable with 45ish being obtainable IF blizzard decides to open dozens of layers for the first couple of days.
---
Dwarf paladin with enchanting and herbalism
---
Yeah. I just like being an annoying prescriptivist cock when it comes to Latin plurals in English. Sorry.
---
Toss an invite!
---
Legit my EXACT thoughts, in that order...

Tough being a ret main that wants to raid in Classic.

Why is this a shitpost? OP even stated that this is information for people unaware of what a "stress test" really is. It was informative and well written. Shitpost somwhere else
---
A greater sense of appreciation for vanilla.
---
LFG, though in some ways killed community.  Though think a lot of that when guilds split for elite raiders and rest.
---
I envy classes that can do meaningful damage that let's them farm or do solo content
---
I dont main them because they aren't healers.
---
I've definitely ruled out any melee class. Not counting Druid or Shaman, obviously, although I might be Rogue. Shit.
---
Anyone that worries about over population when it comes to their class - typically won't be playing the game after 3 months.
---
Doesn't matter what others play, the end.
---
&gt;You obviously have some sort of strange vendetta against private servers which is clouding your ability to have a rational conversation right now.
---
I'll start with this. It's not remotely correct. Pirate servers are their own thing and I don't besmirch the people that enjoy the fruits of blizzards labors. It's like add block its morally wrong but people have the choice to use it. I harbor no I'll will towards pirate servers or their pirates on them. Glad that is cleared up.
---
 &gt;Mechanics are obvious and easy to recreate, the not-so-obvious stuff like armor values were what they had to take an educated guess on, but servers tended to err on the side of more difficult than vanilla.
---
This part is the most entertaining. Pirate servers actually fudge a ton of numbers from armor,parry,dodge chance all the way to spell coefficients on chain heal. They made. a ton of "educated guesses". As of right now the ones that we know are false are actually giving pirates an advantage. They guess wrong on boss parry chance so tanks are threatening significantly better and getting hit much less often. All of those make pirate server mechanics actually easier which goes directly against the supposition that err on the side of being more difficult. 
---
And with just the tiny info we have so far, the pirate server experience starts to be better understood. You can understand how something as awful as fury tanks came about there. Yes it makes sense when bosses dodge less and parry less. But it falls directly down the shoot when you put in the actual values.
---
I can't decide between Mage and Warrior:
---
I hate leveling and love instances and raids. Only did PvP (BGs only) because of friends. Played a Priest in Vanilla (guild sucked and was too casual, never finished BWL, never saw Naxx, would like to change that this time as I think I missed out) and was a MT for BC. Never raided as DPS though.
---
As warrior it is easier to find groups I guess, everyone is looking for a tank. Mage rotation seems boring as hell.
---
But I'm not as young as back then anymore, can't put in the same amount of time. Mage might be more forgiving in that regard related to raiding. I'm not going to be a MT, that's clear. Still, fury warrior requires more preparation time in regards to gear and consumables I guess.
---
As a Mage I would propably use the same spec for farming, raiding and PvP. As a Tank, propably respec for everything which requires a ton of gold (don' t forget the higher repair costs too).
---
I don't think my old friends will be playing classic, so I start alone from scratch. Not even sure though if I wanna play on an English or a German server, UK would be a slightly different time zone, which would be annoying propably.
---
I think I should roll PvE Server this time, hated getting ganked as priest while leveling back then. Not interested in wPvP anyway, but will there be enough BGs then?
---
At least I know I will play Horde, could never stand Paladins &amp; never will :P although I never really played alliance and propably never even saw half their content. 
---
Help!
---
So was perfect Hippogriff feather farming and Blizz was quick to nerf that back in vanilla.
---
Devilsaurs
---
It's a tough call... A lot of the things I initially really liked when they first came out, eventually proved to be detrimental to my overall enjoyment for the game.
---
For example: I really liked the dungeon-finder as I liked doing dungeons.
---
But a big reason of why I liked them was the social aspect and that they were something special.
---
I also really liked dual-spec as I didn't need to have any compromise when queuing up as everything at once. But this also dilluted the identity and attachement of what I was representing in the world.
---
There are a few minor things about modern wow that I wouldn't mind to have in Classic.
---
Like the buttons to sell all greys at once or to sort the inventory. Or getting XP for gathering ores and herbs.
---
Or things being integrated in the UI that otherwise required add-ons.
---
Whoops, you are absolutely correct!
---
I got so lucky, I had already booked the week of the 26th off work just for a break, and with the release on the 27th - my week just got spoken for!
---
Rogues guaranteed 1,5k evis &amp; escape / initiation
---
Mage portals / food &amp; dps less item dependent compared to other classes
---
Hunter 40 yard attack range / tank pet
---
Warlock no cast time dot dps / practically can faceroll mages with hound
---
But there’s already so many
---
Are you me? I had a warlock with t1/t2 and quit in maybe week 2 of Tbc. Wonder if i can retrieve...
---
At the start, I don't think many noobs will clear aq40 or naxx
---
Reason enough to play Paladin tank imo.
---
Lol. I am dumb?
---
The EU release was 11th february 2005 which is when Burning Blade went live. And thats not a year..
---
I did play beta in 2004, but didnt have my own account.
---
Why on earth would i play on NA servers?
---
&gt;Lemme start by saying: I think Classic is going to be a roaring success. However, I fear that Blizzard's extended closed-beta approach may be hurting the hype train. I'd like to hear your thoughts, but first, a bit of data to get the party started.
---
100% but it will build back up the week before launch.
---
It's gaming in 2019 - games get announced / showed and hype is through the roof - then a couple weeks before launch that hype is built back up.
---
Only thing that the streaming has done is helped me realize I won't be spending nearly as much time as I thought in AV or bgs in general.
---
Hype is there but you can't run on full steam all time. It's still over two monthes till launch. When they announced the start of the beta I visited this subreddit like three times a day. Now it's like 1-2 times a week. My guess is, it will be realy full here with the start auf August. Till then live on, coudle your loved ones and get ready for a new ... old world ... of warcraft (sorry had to do it ;))
---
Rogues will likely be the 4th most popular class after warriors, mages and locks.
---
As a pala i would say TBC did feel better then vanilla, blizz did a lot for hybrids in TBC the talents got better but the biggest improvement was the increased amount of gear for each spec including specific dungeon sets for each of the 3 talent specs
---
The offtank should be fury and go dps when not needed.
---
it's not against the rules, Ion even said go ahead and do that, just don't do it nonstop keeping players from playing the game at all
---
What are you talking about? Have you ever played vanilla? XD
---
wat
---
Also the game is most fun in PvP during MC/BWL. AQ and Naxx gear makes people overpowered.
---
That is cool and all but in bfa tier sets dont exist anymore
---
This is part of why it should so long to get to 60 though.
---
My main was a Druid at Vanilla, do you think I knew how end game would turn out? Being stuck as a healer with no useful rez?
---
But I stuck with it, because that was the only choice apart from spending months levelling another class. 
---
In retail you drop $50 and boom, another main at max level which you aren't even remotely invested in.
---
Hunters had the same thing in TBC
---
You could do that, but you're also sacrificing 15% of your damage by not DSing your succubus. So at that point you probably won't even need the threat reduction.
---
Forgot about that, thanks!
---
Same here lol
---
Yea if you think 8 months is even a possibility your opinion on this is probably not worth a lot. 
---
It's going to be probably 2 months. I think most people would shocked it was even 3. There is no reason to hold on to world bosses and DM that long. People would get bored with the game. 
---
Hell BWL was open within 8 months of the release of the original game and you are over here talking about holding off Dire Maul for 8 months. The fuck?
---
It is definitely true. Well on private servers anyways but I can only see it being more common on Classic since this is official.
---
I totally disagree - any build that intends to do any serious AoE farming needs permafrost or Cone of Cold slow will fall off before the cooldown resets.  Also frost channeling is pretty unnecessary, and taking shatter for anything other than a full PVP build is just wasted points as any PVE content that matters it won't even work.  This is much more all purpose capable and can adequately AoE farm anything farmable, has everything necessary for early raids and 5 man content, and can PVP adequately with plenty of snares and improved CS and survivability of ice block, barrier, and cold snap.

I haven't experienced that in vanilla, as I was not interested in PvP for the first half (and being a nelf holy priest on a PvE realm didn't help) and only switched to a PvP server when AQ40 was already out for quite a while. Looking forward to it this time around, although I can almost guarantee that I will bitch about annoying gankers quite often ...
---
The graphical upgrades in general, along with the gorgeous art/designs from expansions. The music has always been good throughout WoW's history too. Everything besides most of the mechanics and super casual appeal/feel is pretty great. I do appreciate the downsizing of raid sizes in general, along with dual spec too. Pet battles are just plain delightful. These things, I will miss.
---
Not a bad strat
---
Dont forget the female NE dance... You will be waiting on other players A LOT!!! and having something nice to look at, really is a bonus!
---
Touchscreen and macros making healing easy peasy on the switch.
---
Just noticed this comment got destroyed lol hooooly shit, epic
---
I remember in DnT's Sapphiron vid they used titans on the whole raid and that was something unheard of. I've flasked for every raid now for months. I really hope they will be lesser used because it's a huge time sink.
---
Opinions are never worth anything.
---
All I said no one knows.
---
There is even the possibility that blizzard extends phase 1 so they have an excuse to keep using layers for a longer period of time. Longer layers means less queues.
---
Again, no one knows.
---
After hours of thinking I am certain I will go for Warrior or Warlock or Hunter for Alliance. Or maybe Horde, we will see.
---
&gt;How can you not freak out over layer hopping phase farm abuse even if it's only for a few weeks?
---
because having 6 hour queue's just to log in, is not a better option.
---
&gt; but alot of people would still rather have a terrible launch and an unplayable start compared to this "change".
---
unplayable means staring at a queue number for a few hours. I'll take sharding all day. Blizzard has been down this path before. This is them learning from their mistakes in 2004.
---
Yeah it's the second semester and the courses are some retarded liberal artsy stuff that will never be used by the profession I'm studying for. 
---
Still, I'm wary of skipping too much school.
---
&gt; It would help both the game and the brand.
---
How would it help the game? Playing on platform that is inferior in absolutely every way. You can even play laying down on your couch on a laptop.
---
Barber shops. I wish they were in classic
---
No idea why your hairstyle is permanent on a character you're gonna spend potentially thousands of hours on
---
True
---
Traditional tanks are expendable as well in pre-raid instances.
---
As someone who played FFXIV, absolutely not. PS3 players in XIV were the worst. Imagine being on hardware that only let you have 16 accessible keybinds and you could only keyboard turn.
---
I rather have this layering system aswell instead of extreme queues.
---
Im optimictic.
---
Yea I mean they could just extend p1 to last like 2 years. Who knows man.
---
Nice website!
---
I took a quick look at the auto fill option with a lvl 19 rogue and noticed missing items that I can't seem to find either when I manually search fo them.
---
For instance the famous fishing hat, the famous gurubashi trinket or the shoulders called "Talbar Mantle".
---
Currently there is no option to choose the stats on boe items with "random enchant" like the "Wrangler's Wristbands"
---
I've read you comment not caring about monetization, but I won't mind sharing my earnings with you to continue this beauty.
---
How many support and like both I wonder?
---
warlock is not that popular
---
What the hell, not EU? I re-activated my stupid account early just to participate in these things, I feel robbed!
---
Thanks bud 😊 late 30s and I'd be happy.
---
Each to their own. I just think camping the corpse of someone 40 level below you is pathetic epeen territory - but if you consider it villainous, more power to you.
---
It hasn't happened yet because the mages are good at managing ignite. 
---
But yes the first one who crits gets the ignite, but you usually can't keep the ignite rolling forever because of threat. So you strategically let it burn off and the next mage takes over.
---
There’s an engineering hat that acts like the priest’s mind control spell. Then there’s also goblin jumper cables that acts like a low chance resurrection
---
Probably wouldn’t be watching streams if I got into the beta... just saying.
---
Played a priest back then. Was interesting, but can't remember much from the boss fights as my monitor was filled with 40 health bars. Definetly more interesting than a frost mage I guess. Nowing when to place a big heal or when to use lower level spells for tank healing. Positioning in encounters where damage is more distributed to reach everyone you are responsible for even though they scatter in chaos... 
---
Although screen resolution is much higher nowadays I would still not do it again.
---
PvP(BGs) was not really interesting for me, I was still healing (didn't want to respec every time), so barely any HKs.
---
I think when you have 3 druids who already have their T2 legs off rag and you get another pair of Druid T2 legs with no one to get them it’s a bit frustrating. I don’t mind being able to itemize a bit in class specific things that otherwise rot
---
Not sure it is or was ever ‘cool’.... but damnit I love it lol.
---
the art assets, music, upright orcs, dual spec, hunters using focus, raid complexity, large world (although it's used ineffectively), new races
---
the bad outweighs the good, though
---
The glancing is more important
---
I would say that if you want to play a lock, this is absolutely not something that should change your mind.
---
In fact it’s weird that there’s people actually discussing this.
---
Just play the lock man! They’re gangster as fuck.
---
Can you use it in combat?
---
Well thought out post and a valid question.  There is only so much Beta streaming you can watch before it gets old.  Anyone interested in Classic has waited many many years.  69 more days is nothing.  Doesn't matter how Blizzard approach it.  In fact if anything hopefully the stress tests help with a smoother launch day.
---
Thanks for the info. Good info given regarding mob drops etc. 
---
Luckily we will take breaks at same time as it will be a LAN house for 5 days 😃. Mid to late 30s and I'd be happy.
---
Do you like gank or being ganked ? If not roll pve.
---
Yes. It is.
---
Imo 30-40 is the most annoying part. Always feels like you are out of quests and tge few you have are camped by groups who will gank you at sight.  
---
Oh boy.. I'm really looking forward to that fun again. xD
---
You underestimate the power of mages and Naxx trash. A couple of mages and a hunter can clear a lot of it and people buy the trash drops that way. I've seen MSAs go for thousands of gold on heavily inflated realms. Gbid runs are also crazy lucrative. I really despise that idea but when you hear about people making 500g in a one hour raid you kinda don't care...
---
Nope it will return again for launch and will have even more views due many people actually playing it and being invested in the game
---
I work parttime 24h a week. Still the rest to do, like kids, household, food prep for 5 person, 2 cats and 3 rats, gardening..
---
I'm happy with an hour a day of wow, and some 3 hour sessions once a week on free days in the morning.
---
This is why you invite 1 night elf priest to the raid. When the raid wipes they are the fastest to run back to this instance. You can let everyone else afk while they res everyone up. 
---
Its just efficient.
---
I am ready for this! WoW on consoles would bring in a lot of new players.
---
Roofl ***your*** right
---
to prevent sheep mob heal trolling. it was an original vanilla change iirc
---
I work nights, lol.
---
Guild banks, new graphics
---
not gonna argue with you this is why I love twinking
---
No, you are probably going to want another prot spec tank besides the main tank unless you are in a speed running guild where threat generation is so important you need fury prot tanks. 
---
Why have a fury warrior in tank gear doing shit damage and a ret doing shit damage while procing NF when you could just have another paladin healer and an offtank doing shit damage but keeping up NF?
---
A lot of what I like can be done with addons so I won’t mention those, but one I definitely think makes the game more enjoyable is summoning stones at dungeons. It still requires you to get a group going so people wouldn’t rage quit at first sight but it also meant you didn’t need to wait 25 minutes for 1 slow person to make there way to the dungeon. It also meant warlocks weren’t forced to deal with people complaining to them about not getting a summon.
---
It will be very possible
---
Every guild in existence did the climb-skip on private servers. You kill the first 3 mobs in MC and jump to the right.
---
Sharding is same thing as layering. The point is they knew in very early stages of the developement, that launch will be  a problem for their players so they will use sharding at the beginning. They also know and said in that video, that they know sharding is gonna be a problem if implemented anywhere than the starter zones. Also they explained its not a server issue to hold thousand players in the same server, rather than just not bottlenecking them all in spawn area.
---
Even 2019 blizzard isnt dumb enough to implement sharding anywhere than the first zones when it comes to Vanilla wow.
---
They wont expand sharding further, since they know it will effect the whole game negatively. Even 2019 blizzard aint that stupid to make the mistake again, which killed retail wow.
---
Remind me in august 27
---
Fun raid mechanics. Honestly idk what it is. But my favorite thing about retail wow. Is wiping on the same boss 50 times to finally down it at try 51. The raid developers did an amazing job with BFDA. Fights felt very challenging early on. And we actually a lot of fun.
---
&gt; Pirate servers are their own thing and I don't besmirch the people that enjoy the fruits of blizzards labors.
---
I mean, the fact that you're even using the term "pirate server" and calling the players "pirates" shows that you're holding some sort of strange grudge.
---
&gt;Pirate servers actually fudge a ton of numbers from armor,parry,dodge chance all the way to spell coefficients on chain heal.
---
I mentioned armor. Yes the parry rate was wrong. I haven't heard much about dodge chance or spell coefficients differing between emu and classic beta, could you explain that a bit further?
---
&gt;As of right now the ones that we know are false are actually giving pirates an advantage.
---
Well this isn't necessarily true. We know the Parry rates were off now. But there was also a massive outcry over how easy the beta was because many players were used to the way private servers were tuned. No one even noticed a difference with parry until the blue post, but we definitely saw mobs hitting harder and dying faster. So the tuning of stuff like damage and armor values were much more noticeable to players, and therefore more significant.
---
&gt;You can understand how something as awful as fury tanks came about there. Yes it makes sense when bosses dodge less and parry less. But it falls directly down the shoot when you put in the actual values.
---
Again, you're tunneling on one particular aspect where we know private servers were wrong, but you're missing the entire picture. Sure, parry rates are off. But what if those raid mobs hit for less damage? What if they hit a bit slower? What if they have less armor and therefore DPS generate more threat? Those are all factors that could make high tier dual wield tanking optimal. We simply don't know yet until we're in the game and testing that particular situation.
---
If you have less time to play, faster, more efficient leveling is more important. If you have lot of time you can go off the way more often.
---
I think we're in a bit of a lull now. The release date was announced, the beta hype is gone.... now everyone is just settling in for those last two months of waiting. I fully expect another explosion of hype once the server list is announced and name registration is open. 
---
To answer your question specifically, No. I'm fine with how the beta is being handled. I don't see how they would have done it any differently.
---
I would legit buy a switch for this.
---
He's not your guy, dude.
---
They're planning to keep the Classic servers open indefinitely.  Half the point of this was people complaining that (unlike other video game classics like Super Mario Bros or Zelda or whatever) it was impossible to play the original WoW legitimately.  So their intention is to make Classic servers a permanent thing.
---
You know you can just upvote right? You don't need to comment every time to say +1.
---
As far as I know layering is going to be a resource during the beginning. After some time (let's say, when a lot of people are doing the end game) layering won't be a thing anymore.
---

BC was trash
---
Bless I can finally get past the rng boss.
---
I know this sub hates streamers and youtubers but without them we wouldn't have Classic either.
---
Bllsht
---
This wouldn’t be a bad thing tbh.
---
I’m concerned about layering. Just saying I hope that does not disappoint.
---
Having some serious rogue or mage can't decide troubles. Not gonna lie
---
Of course, but I tried to gather what limited data are available outside of just Reddit (Twitch, Google, and Reddit included). I don't disagree that Reddit is a vocal minority, however.
---
40 now, got the wife, got the kids, got the job, got the house and mortgage but fuck it cant resist the vanilla wow calling once more. I'm going all in for a week off work and smashing it, for the horde!
---
Wow! Really similar meme to one I posted 20 days ago here on this subreddit!
---

---
They got Classic, didnt they?
---
Hybrid healing elemental, good for raiding, good for BG, unless hardcore guild, then you need to spec deep resto
---
Hey another channel that steals content! 
---
We have enough of these, thanks.
---
Overaggro'ing on the trash until you get crit.
---
Thats my issue, I hate healing and I love hardcore raiding.
---
Bur Im happy with my decision to roll Mage.
---
I didnt like the environment except for Nagrand which was epic. Too much animals and wierd flying octopus
---
Not to mention that it allows you to gear more for straight damage increases rather than hit.
---
I would say he was up there for sure for the paladin class. He was a multi rank one pvper, as well as a very sucesfful speed leveler. If i remember correctly he had a few world first max level characters when new expansions dropped.
---
Something tells me you haven’t played a Paladin before
---
i hope its like d3 release, i made 10k selling gold on ebay the first 2weeks till they fixed that exploit
---
Because you already have a fuckton of healers and more of them means they will just stand around doing nothing or trying to snipe eachother. Better to just let one guy do the ret. He'll be above hunters on most fights anyways.
---
Found a googledoc with some infos on it someone posted a while back here: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bzmytq/ive_integrated_my_human_fedex_route_into/
---
Well-timed (for boss abilities and spell batching) /sit worked on Beta last time I checked.
---
I'm almost sure runes can't crit. And Skull of Impending Doom can't.
---
Just pick Druid! 
---
Then you can be everything*
---
Guess it's lucky there is no high end raiding in vanilla lol
---
x4
---
4 inches of glory
---
Bladerunner remaster when? :p
---
I always name my characters some sort of Roleplay sounding name. The past few years when I've played PoE I always start my character's name with the same two/three letters and then add something to the end.
---
Ex: Everian, Evaria, Evandrien etc. 
---
Fun way if you like a theme of all of your characters but still like actual names! Then there also those name generators you can look at if you want to go full roleplay for your race.
---
Interesting idea.  I might test that in stress test, see how long it takes at level 6 to catch up on melee skills.
---
Shaman - Horde
---
Druid - Alliance
---
Dwarf priest is certainly better min maxing, but choosing your class based on what, 3 or 4 encounters, unless you're at the cutting edge of raiding seems a little silly.
---
Phone + Xbox controller. I'm down!
---
Tbh this is only a problem if you have scrub tanks
---
The thing is that offensive stats far outweigh defensive stats in AQ and Naxx. So if you have two AQ/Naxx geared players they will just one-shot eachother. Whoever opens first annihilates the other in a few seconds. 
---
That's why I think PvP loses its luster after AQ is released.
---
I can’t wait for the journey end game is fun 10m dungeons I really enjoyed forming. I know when I lvl cap my war and shaman I will be organizing those runs again. Man I can’t wait for the journey glad I didn’t get into beta
---
Freaking out isn't good. Sharing constructive feedback is good.
---
I wonder how does one outplay 15% parry chance in comparison to 5% from private servers.
---
Time zones seem to be a bigger "problem" then ping, you can make a server that never sleeps but it's hard to make a server where both EU and NA is on at the same time.
---
Imbalance and playing a certain way makes people gods, which is the appeal and why pservers existed.  Same reason pre-cu  pservers are a thing.
---
Clearly you don’t understand the point of a stress test either. The point IS for people to log in all at once.
---
Everyone who makes reddit posts is bad at max level pvp. If it was otherwise they would play pvp not make posts.
---
You can't compare WoW with non subscription or even F2P games in terms of player numbers.
---
I agree. I think the run animation on literally all the new models looks so stupid. Same goes for new mount models also, the bears, raptors, everything looks dumb.
---
Um. 70K after taxes is $4600 a month. Or $34 an hour. What the fuck job as a student is paying you over $34 an hour? I call bullshit.
---
Unpopular opinion but i prefer the new models. I've been playing since BC and was extremely happy with the model update when it first came out. Also helps that i main a dwarf and they look 100 times better than they did in classic. Again just my opinion though.
---
I personally love improved cities
---
M0 aren't timed. they are still harder than classic dungeon.
---
also the timer is very leniant.. until you get in the 15+ scene.
---
Yes, however, you're talking about a tiny fraction of the overall populace. His question is broader and applicable to the average player.
---
&gt; Yeh, at the moment im stuck between
---
Dwarf Priest, Dwarf Hunter, Dwarf Paladin and Gnome Warlock.
---
FWIW, I'm planning to main a Dwarf Paladin and alt a Gnome Warlock.  Launch will be the best opportunity for group leveling (especially with the ability to switch layers for groups) and I plan to heal my way to 60 for better or worse.  The lock will be a lot easier to solo level after the crowd has spread out a bit.
---
It won't give you enough rep on its own. You'll still need to donate supplies.
---
They had other people playing their accounts and no one will admit to it because TOS.
---
Actually they may have balanced too well.
---
There's a very interesting video that says designing a game with intentional imbalance may actually be a good thing
---
https://youtu.be/e31OSVZF77w
---
That's not a faction mount.
---
&gt;I think this is the raider mindset in a nutshell.
---
&gt;Is raiding *fun for them?* if so, they must be allowed to do it. Anyone who says different hates fun.
---
&gt;Does it matter whether they are spoiling the game for levelers with their constant farming / resource &amp; mob control? No. The raiders are having fun. This is all that matters.
---
"*You're not allowed to have fun in a way that is different than mine, ^reeeeeeeeee^eeeeeeeeeeeee^eeeeeee^ee*"
---
Honestly? I’d probably buy it.
---
If theres like 1 lotus spawning / 2 hours, you can hop layers all you want and it wont matter. Every lotus will be picked up in few minutes anyways by 5-10 ppl on mounts running between all spawn spots. Unless you control EVERY spawn point on EVERY layer...
---
Pretty close, I work night shifts at a warehouse, stashing drugs.
---
\*bottles clacking*
---
At no point in the post does OP advise that people sit out the first 3 hours. His intent is clearly to set expectations so people don't get upset or give up.
---
*was* the community. nothing garantee it'll come back. it sure not coming back in the beta... unless we count the streamer fan-boy/ anti-streamer rivalry.
---
community isn't something you can code.
---
I don’t have much sympathy for people burned out because of their time on pservers.
---
Well, it doesn't need to be geocities-like ads. But I wouldn't mind a couple well placed banners where it wouldn't interfere with the navigation
---
You vastly underestimate how important mana was back then. You cannot compare it to today
---
I like  how as an alliance you recognize the fact that you will be dead for a major percentage of your play time.
---
Let's hope EU gets the same.
---
Most private server just ignore C&amp;D - or shutdown and relocate / re-launch etc. Though that strategy had been played for the last several years and it wasn't getting anywhere.
---
Nost deciding to do something totally different by channeling all their energy to produce metrics and highlight  to blizzard a business case for classic. This is what set them apart from others before them imo.
---
This is the time to set up Bars and Addons.... can;t wait. Is curse working for classic addons? Or do we have to do them the old fashioned way?
---
All the polls and pserver data says otherwise. There were like 3 polls posted here with close to 20k responses that put locks at 3rd most popular.
---
nothing, because warlock is god.
---
maybe ill change my mind and try a mortal class, jk ill twink something in case of serious gank.
---
Yeah before Blizzard announced Classic there were a lot of naysayers. Not that surprising considering Blizzards previous stance on the topic though.
---
You’d be the minority.  The login servers have shit the bed every time
---
We were talking about expansions not vanilla
---
Meh. Shatter is good for everything except boss killing and makes a world of difference in PvP. Imp CS is nice but it's alot of points to get to it, shatter seems more important for PvP than blanket silence.
---
Included permafrost as you stated, 2/5 winters chill should be plenty in a raid environment. Got shatter and frost channeling though. Had 3 points left over, frost channeling isn't amazing but seemed to make the most sense with the last 3. 15% more mana on your main spenders is just nice. The last 3 are pretty interchangable though. Could go impact for rando pvp stuns. Another point to max out imp blizzard wouldn't be terrible.
---
The way you can actually help is by clearing extra mobs out of the way
---
In your opinion. As a pvper MoP was absolutely the best expansion.
---
Remindme! 91 days
---
The point is to tell people who have not participated in a stress test what to expect when they log in. He's not telling people to NOT log in, he is just saying be prepared to not be able to play for the first 2-3 hours. 
---
Reading comprehension isn't hard.
---
Yup, that's our server. We switched to laughing skull. You are right. I'm sorry I don't remember your name, I am sure you were with hadokin the shaman. 
---
I was Angryfox and Angrybear. I had to play multiple characters during that stupid grind, and druid was the obvious choice unfortunately most of the time. Nothing like trying to get two characters at one time to 14. I would switch to warrior when I got tired yelling, "just fucking mortal strike one time!!!"
---
All possible since I used to trade a stock market and had my own hours. Think I took 6-8 months off during the deepest WoW dive. 
---
I did make real life friends with our rogue Stabsfast. 
---
Him and his brother played the same account, as I am sure you had a few guys play the same.
---
lmao spot on.
---
According to that survey there will be more paladins and shaman than hunters. And that is just not going to happen.
---
I might just come back tomorrow and upvote it...
---
Do you have data for the alli horde ratio? This concerns me far more
---
Tunnel visions as in they don't see where theyr going and body pulling.
---
Livng bomb in classic?
---
Unless you level some alts to 60 before Naxx.
---
I'm pretty stuck between mage, priest and hunter.... Alliance for sure, but not completely decided about the class...
---
I think shadowspriest is dot dot dot flay, same rotation vs every spec.
---
I could be wrong.
---
S O W H A T ?
---
anyone ever tell you it’s crass to boast about money? especially if your belittling someone else.
---
Priests - lack of comparable raid utility, having to level shadow 1-60 if playing troll.
---
Forsen exists, your argument is invalid.
---
Where else am I going to get pink pigtails?
---
Only if you were a female orc :p
---
That's not true at all.
---
I played wow with the consoleport addon when I had too much carpal tunnel and it was mouse-turning with about 40 keybinds
---
Thought it wouldn't be permanent.
---
Common sense prevails.
---
Loving bomb was in wotlk wasnt it? Definitely not classic, pretty sure the last talent for fire in classic is combustion?
---
Don't forget about stuff like Craigslist, Facebook, etc. I was saving money to build a computer and then I noticed someone near me selling a barely used PC that they put together for $1000. Was a nice system with an i7, GTX 1080, 144 hz monitor, etc.
---
That’s very fair. It seems that it just comes down to different preferences for gameplay, whether you want to be prepared for mistakes or try to optimize the ideal situation.
---
I guess it would also depend a lot on whether you were pugging or running with a trusted group, too,
---
I like the beefiness and scaling of warriors but hate being so weak on my own.
---
I like the potency of shamans but hate twisting my fingers to place totems and running out of mana.
---
I like everything about mage except their appearance and losing to warlocks and shadow priests.
---
I like warlock's 1v1 strength and PvE utility but I don't like being so immobile and dependent on gear.
---
I like druid's mobility and flexibility but hate being the butt of the joke in most practical contexts.
---
I like the desirability of priests but don't like being squishy and having to blow gold on respecs whenever I want to do damage.
---
I'm rolling hunter this time around and I'm looking forward to having independence, high burst damage, a high skill cap, and great mobility, great world pvp, but not looking forward to fighting warlocks and shadow priests, dealing with my dead zone, finding late-game dungeon groups, and justifying my need rolls against party members' understandable huntard prejudice.
---
For the record I've mained Druid and Mage in the past.
---
I'm not belittling anyone, nor am I boasting. I simply can't imagine that slave pay to be real, it's not realistic. "You're" by the way.
---
The negative comes from feeling that the most optimal way to play the game is to not play the game. Yes, that is each person's prerogative, but it's bad design.
---
*Nice*
---
I suggest you to level 2-3 alt to level 36-40 in phase 1 then decide which one to level to 60 in phase 2. When the honor system drops in phase 2 it will be a bloodbath and will be much harder to level in contested zones. So if you plan to level multiple characters and you cannot decide which one to main this may be the best option in my opinion
---
&gt;I mean, the fact that you're even using the term "pirate server" and calling the players "pirates" shows that you're holding some sort of strange grudge.
---
Take this one how you want. I call then pirate servers because it is an unauthorized use of blizzard IP. I am very much against pirating anything so while I don't condone it, it doesn't create some bias against them. I just prefer to call a spade and spade.
---
&gt;Well this isn't necessarily true. We know the Parry rates were off now. But there was also a massive outcry over how easy the beta was because many players were used to the way private servers were tuned. No one even noticed a difference with parry until the blue post, but we definitely saw mobs hitting harder and dying faster. So the tuning of stuff like damage and armor values were much more noticeable to players, and therefore more significant.
---
Your conflating a few things here so I'll add some context. The parry/dodge/hit cap post was in regards to raid bosses (I'm fairly certain). The mob damage problem was trash in dungeons which is pretty unrelated. The trash was harder on pirate servers but wasn't blizzlike and has nothing to do with raid difficulty which is the crux of the issue. 
---
&gt;Again, you're tunneling on one particular aspect where we know private servers were wrong, but you're missing the entire picture. Sure, parry rates are off. But what if those raid mobs hit for less damage? What if they hit a bit slower? What if they have less armor and therefore DPS generate more threat? Those are all factors that could make high tier dual wield tanking optimal. We simply don't know yet until we're in the game and testing that particular situation.
---
I'm tunneling a little on these particular values only because it's the only hard data we have. I can't argue armor or spell coefficients because those haven't been released to my knowledge and would just be guesses. Bosses on pirate servers are tuned to hit harder and probably more often that I'm not certain on. Boss parry has a very similar effect by giving the boss a very significant haste buff. Dodge was off by a little adding to the damage a boss would normally take. Armor is a big discussion point both in the actual values and how the debuffs stack. Those things unfortunately aren't public so we can't have a meaningful talk about them.
---
This is awesome man! Good luck on your business.
---
I am going to do one of those online wheels and spin in launch day.  Warrior, mage, druid, and maybe hunter, lock.  Depends.
---
Any of those laptop would run Classic maxed out regardless.
---
Dwarf pala and lock alt was my initial plan, but with more of a focus on prot levelling. My main issue with the pala is that in pvp as prot I'm almost useless, mana pool to small to heal, dmg to low to burst, both of those considered lack of mobility is huge.
---
Unless I play a paladin and I can just bubble hearthstone. K thx bye
---
Except we aren’t talking about the average player. People on here talking about endgame content and the ones who don’t care about the leveling experience aren’t going to be your average player. 
---
So when referring to people who’s only goal is to get to 60 and do endgame content, there should actually be a large focus on leveling so you don’t take 10+days / played. Anybody on here min/maxing raids and such like he is referring to is focused on “the journey” of endgame, not the journey of leveling. Depends what your focus of the game is.
---
I do understand the point. 
---
Yes, the point IS for people to log in all at once, this post just tells them not to be pissed af, if they are not able to log in.
---
People wanting it to fail and people who think it is superior to retail and therefore they are too are retards. 
---
Everyone knows WoD is supreme.
---
6/10? Ok. But the video I give 12/10 :)
---
Didn't they say they were adding a cooldown once you change layers? 10-30 mins should be enough to deter hopping...
---
Levelling with a shaman is great fun, it's just trash to play in PvE.
---
Playing restore being a wind fury slave while spamming chain heal is just straight up dull. 
---
Enha isn't engaging in PvE - you also do 600 dps with Sulfuras and TOTAL BiS Naxx gear while warriors and rogues are doing that in pre-raid BiS in MC, and Elemental is just not viable due to serious mana issues putting you oom a minute into a fight, if not sooner. 
---
Here's to hoping the balancing of vanilla wow comes soon after Naxx, as opposed to later when all huye dies out.
---
I mean, the shard has unique utility that remains situationally useful for literally all of vanilla.
---
The staff is a placeholder until you get something better (albeit I think slightly far down the line - I’m not sure how long it is until you replace it).
---
By no means do you ever *need* the shard, but it’s certainly nice to have.
---
If memory serves, yes. But it's been a long time since I last used it, so take that as you will
---
I’m sort of surprised the lack of love for Mara.  
---
Hidden bosses were so cool to discover.  Princess is such a neat fight.  Cool aesthetics throughout.  
---
ST is up there for me as well.  So much mystery in this dungeon.  It was where I felt I was finally reaching end game.  Class quests are super cool.  Lots of dragons.  Took a lot of time to clear. 
---
ZF is my other 9.  The stairs fight was just adrenaline inducing.  
---
Honorable mentions to BRD and LBRS.
---
Alliance is the child's class fyi
---
Mage can be picked up easily. Hard to master but still great if played just averagely.
---
I don't see where the damage gain would come from though.
---
The turn in saga was for EPIC unstoppable Force. I would not have organized that for the 58 blue lol. Although that spear was awesome till 60.
---
Maybe the authentic version of classic isn't for you?
---
It's funny how WotLK this meme is, because the gear looks Classic.
---
Druid can kind of do that.  The secret is feral/balance spec for improved thorns, tough bear form, and swipe spam.  I heard you can do dire mail lashers with that or Moonkin spec (dot up everything and tank with improved thorns)
---
Wish I could balance the pro's and con's in anyway that would let me make a choice. Every time I think I've cracked it... nope I consider something else
---
How do you know how many healers are in this theoretical raid? Why wouldn't you just bring another DPS warrior and get real damage in there and let the offtank use Nightfall then? 
---
What are you even talking about? Hunter's are top tier damage from MC-BWL. They only fall off in AQ because their pet damage never scales and there is no real weapon upgrades from that point forward until the raid kills KT.
---
Beast Master Hunter is what youre looking for.
---
You win by pressing one button. Doesn't get easier than that
---
I don't think I've been overly insulting. The only comment regarding that is the brain activity thingy, but honestly: if you didn't get the sarcasm in the README of said github repository, searching for the addon on google shows several threads where it is debunked as a troll.
---
While it does sound condescending, it's something everyone in fact should do: after searching for something, turn on your brain (that means everyone, including me) and think about what you just found. Because pushing an argument with a troll addon is not really helping anyone.
---
&gt; be hurting the hype train. I'd like to hear your thoughts, but first, a bit of data to get the party started.
---
There are streams? \*wink\*
---
Ugh
---
You used a lot of words there to say nothing of value. Get to the point.
---
Hey great idea thanks!
---
Bad premises is bad. 
---
One shamans would be enhance as they are easily the best dps hybrid (ele is okay also). They add enough utility (read dps to other classes) where you don't really lose much for taken them even with them being 50% of warrior dps.
---
Druids + priest can heal (maybe a druid or 2 feral for off tanking). and there ya go. One priest is healing but has the shadow weaving talent.
---
Still bad premise. Better off taking just 1 resto druid and 1 shadow priest a raid.
---
Best paladin in ze world!!
---
tf? what is authentic about bugs all over the place? dumbfuck
---
&gt;I'm not a programmer obviously
---
Obviously, since you say layering and respawns are part of the client.
---
I'm pretty sure a multi-billion company can fix a lot of stuff in 2 months.
---
Well, you probably can't play on method, by I healed "fine" using it on 1800 rated arenas, heroic raids, and some +10 keys on mythic +
---
So yeah, not incredibly hardcore content, but not completelly casual.
---
I was mostly playing a mistweaver monk (brewmaster for the mythic+)

Welp I guess I messed up .-.
---
Hope the meme might still be amusing though
---
Agree for the most part.
---
I was always a person that would say just play retail it's no as bad as you think. But at this point i don't even want to take my own advice. Im currently on a break myself, will be returning for 8.2 but will 100% jump ship when classic comes out. 
---
So my suggestion now would be wait for classic and give it a shot. In my opinion one of the best things about classic is literally everyone will have to start from 0. You won't feel like your behind anyone. And you can enjoy the leveling experience with everyone else. Right now if you were to go into BFA leveling up most zones would be ghost towns. You might see 1-3 people per level while levling as opposed to the 100s you will see when classic launches.
---
Same but without the gf
---
Absolutely. Was questioning my sanity there.
---
like they "fixed" so many things wrong with the game in bfa beta? :D

---
SFK curse I’m 99% wont work because a you would have to get the curse then get summoned outside the instance then run in to the raid fight, and the 5 mins to get there would probably be up. 
---
And I’m pretty sure the ghosts are really low level and will most likely miss repeatedly. But honestly that’s a clever idea if it does work. If someone has a link to a clip of someone /sitting and proccing enrage on beta link it here.
---
M.A.G.E.
---
Are you on beta or PS?
---
I actually found healing to be the most optimal while using the addon.
---
The worst part was using ground-targeted skills so I actually think playing as DPS is bad with the gamepad
---
Cringe? Following your logic, every video game is an RPG because you actually play as someone else. It can be simulator of a truck driver, where you "roleplay" truck driver, or sim city where you "roleplay" either god or mayor. How MoH or CoD? You roleplay a soldier. It's literally the way your logic goes. What is cringe as fuck is trying to prove that WoW is an RPG game.
---
I would lose my shit if that was real. Hell yeah can we please get this blizzard?!
---
Console peasents
---
Inaccurate the horde will always win bc alliance decides to always fucking lose when i join a bg
---
The worst thing is the networking. I don't understand how it's so bad in modern WoW. You can shove 500 people in a single area on a private server with no problems. Put half of as many people in the same area in modern WoW or on the classic stress test and everything becomes a laggy nightmare slideshow.
---
Ah, I've had a horrible experience with targeting lmao I forgot about macros entirely tbh.
---
If they did dwarf locks I'd be sold. I find the lack of mobility is solved on a lock due to high burst, and survivability, but the race choice holds me back. Not a huge fan of gnomes, and humans sooo meh
---
When you reference thinkers not wanting fair fights, what events are you talking about? (New to the community, eli5 please)
---
Tauren are one of the few model changes I was cool with.
---
Really? I really found it easy as hell using the D-PAD to select targets on the raid frames, not to mention you could still have an enemy target. As a Mistweaver Monk it was awesome to fistweave
---
Masculinity vs toxic soyness.
---
How long time does it take for you to take a dump? Get some fiber in your diet, seriously sir :p
---
8% instead of 9%, I think you might have misread that blue post xD
---
And they say the classes aren't balanced.
---
I am going to make one of each character and just never hit 60.
---
Well, you still need to kite well, have Feign/trap ready if you're jumped, you benefit from swapping aspects... It's often easy to win as BM indeed, but, just as with mages, not so easy to master.
---
Wait until july 7th+. Thats when the new ryzens are coming out.
---
Gravestone scepter, BFD, for wand users.
---
Runes can crit (leading to hilarious deaths) but enrage only procs from physical abilties.
---
I guess I'm doing it wrong 😅
---
Well you can get the curse, HS out, get port to the entrance of the instance, get the port inside to the boss. :D
---
Well...well.. yeah a bit short duration. If you hear the sound of the curse (when it get summoned) you can instantly sit down and get a critical strike?
---
Umm, well, probably BM Hunter. It's just a quick spam every time your BW is up and ready. Otherwise... Fire Mage perhaps? They can do some nasty fireball crits and follow it up with even more with a pretty easy rotation. Their burst is pretty gross. I think Warlocks can get to the same extent of burst damage too, on top of having Fear available. However, DPS isn't everything in PvP... there is so much more to take into consideration based on the tools(stuns and interrupts for example) your opponents have available, their positioning, awareness, etc.
---
Played with this last night. Maybe I am missing something, but is there a way to "tickle" the Auto-Fill? For instance, if I update a set or update my character level, I would like to hit a button to have it ask me to auto fill again. It looks like it adjusts what the gear scoring is, but I have to select each item.
---
For instance, I selected the preset, and then added stamina and adjusted some of the weights. When I hit save, I still have the same gear selected. When I click on an item it shows the new stamina item at the top, which is great, but it would be nice to just hit a wheel and have it auto populate.
---
2 words: Wetlands run
---
You are wrong. Once you hit lvl 60 there is like a whole new game starting. You have to unlock all the attunments, grind for the best recipes. Lvl fishing and cooking. All the fun dungeons you can run. 
---
Fighting over rare crafting materials. 
---
Raiding is such a small part of classic wow. It's only like 20% of the true content at 60.
---
Lvl 60 is still a journey in classic wow, getting there is just a tutorial.
---
I've narrowed my choices down to Mage and Rogue. I mained mage in TBC and never played rogue. I just love how insanely practical mages are...food, drink, teleport, portals, slowfall, polymorph, etc.
---
Pretty much everything you mentioned except layering has been working as it was. If you are basing your knowledge on current experience on private servers then you will be disappointed.
---
12k in 2 months is actually 37,5$ per hour! Which is totally insane imo
---
vanilla had bugs
---
I've seen an [interesting video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZYPyCeeFpw) about its potential.
---
No one knows how will this be on Classic (just as with Ironfoe and all the dozens of unclear procrates).
---
To be fair a baked potato could run classic.  I only bring it up from my experience gaming wow on a laptop for a couple years.  At the time I thought I enjoyed it.  But after upgrading to a decent PC for less than OP has budgeted I can say (again, from personal experiences) I would def choose the PC every time over the laptop.  Unless mobility is the main issue, then I could see perfectly fine why OP is set on them.  Idk.  Sorry for long comment.
---
Just bind 2 or 3 modifiers to the top buttons.
---
Most people see a 12-button controller and think you can only have 12 binds, but forget that even playing with the keyboard you are mostly just using 1-4 and then about 8 letter keys along with shift, ctrl and alt.
---
Typically you dot things up then finish them with wand / drainsoul. 
---
You can use drain life as a filler but then you never get 5 second rule regen. Also it causes more agro because it's damage and healing. Many cases as well at low levels if you have a good wand it's just straight up more powerful than drainlife or any dots you have.
---
nobody gives a fuck about bfa:)
---
Maybe because they aren't remotely the same piece of software? They are having to adapt 15 year old code to modern servers while private servers are modern code running on modern servers.
---
This is why I can't decide what to play. My gnome rogue is dying to be played again but on the other hand playing something new would be fun. 
---
That's feeling of satisfaction you get after killing someone on a gnome though.....just knowing they are sitting there mad as hell after hearing chugga chugga chugga chugga CHOO CHOOOO
---
Sitting in combat will force a mob to crit you. There's a trick you can do in Classic to get it to pop Enrage. Something about moving at the same time or something, I'm not sure since I'm not in the beta. You can watch Monkeynews get Enrage to proc pretty consistently with sit critting.
---
Good think I'll play a hunter, so NE is already the min-max :p
---
Same can be said about rogues imo.
---
Rogue.  Just practice your stunlock as you're leveling and as long as you have all your cd's (which you should.. because stealth) you're basically going to win every single 1v1 encounter.  Depending on faction I suppose.
---
Thanks sherlock. Thats why i said "undead" horse. Still it looks exactly the same as the undead faction horses
---
Exactly what I’m doing
---
That's very smart if you want the run to take a lot longer than it has to
---
Shadow priest is very strong and easy. I played one when I first joined the private server scene 3+ years ago and owned in just rank 8 gear and some felcloth gear. Thought it was me until I realized the class is just really strong. Minimal buttons for sure.
---
&gt;Laptop
---
You mention respawns. What's unacceptable about respawns? They're the same as they were in Vanilla, no?
---
I'm not saying we shouldn't stress the issues. But yea I hope a lot will be fixed, because it's an old game, and the correct behavior is known. And the remaining bit will be fixed shortly after the release (just as with BfA).
---
The realm list for Classic will be available prior to August 13th.
---
In 3v3 arenas I also found it amazing. Having some enemy targeted all the time to cc while cycling trough my allies to heal them as needed.
---
These were my main two as well back in vanilla and bc respectively. I think I just can’t deny going rogue this time around because leveling is so slow we spend a TON of time and energy (heh) in world pvp scenarios, so being able to stealth away or tank back is a huge deal. The question is which race?
---
Mice
---
The hype train will pick back up 1-2 weeks before. Hype can only be sustained so long but the enthusiasm still remains.
---
Prob shaman. Priest has plenty of buttons to. Be careful reading that wowhead guide the other guy linked, that thing has alot of misinformation in it and doesn't seem to be written by somebody who knows a ton about downranking.
---
Fun fact. I have almost every badass two hander in the game on my Warrior since Vanilla. Zin'rokh is the ONLY one I'm missing, it also happens to be my favorite.
---
I tried Archeology for so long trying to get it.
---
If some hunter tries to pull the "Hunter weapon" card when that finally drops in Classic it won't be pretty.
---
The buff will of Sharan can stack times... 😳+250 all stats 😳
---
There’s always going to be someone complaining about it.  I have fond memories of some WSG battles where there were two or three of us on each side super geared out.  It became like a spy vs spy deal where we were hunting each other out on the battlefield.
---
I disagree. While yes the music is fantastic, it's not good for an open world game. I don't need a full orchestra on 11 blaring at me for my entire playthrough. Give me some subtle atmospheric music. Compare westfall with the new zones. Or better yet BRD with any dungeon music. It's just too busy and too much 90% of the time.
---
Some gladiators like twinking as well, so I guess it's easy to invalidate your point?
---
I literally got perma banned from /r/powerlifting for posting a meme and it was my first post ever
---
Uhm? A switch??
---
Don't you guys have phones!?
---
Hmm I mean it could work! There’s always a chance but seems like a ton of work :p get me a beta key and I’ll test ha ha
---
That. is. the. Joke.
---
Yes, we are talking about the average player. The average player is not going to rush to 60. The OPs question is 'Why is **everybody** so pumped about getting to 60 and raiding?' If somebodies goal is to get to 60 and raid, they are going to spend 20x the amount of hours raiding than they will leveling. Not everybody who wants to end-game raid cares about getting 60 in less than 10 days played. Enjoying the leveling and raiding experience together is a possibility, they're not mutually exclusive. You are allowed to level slowly and still desire to be 'good' at the game when you get to the raiding part. Not everybody is competing to be the first, they just want to be effective when they get there.
---
It has nothing to do with "adapting" Classic to modern servers, the problem is even worse in Modern WoW / BFA.
---
Private servers' amateur emulation and ancient client should put them at a drastic disadvantage, but it outperforms the Blizzard product.
---
Shadowpriest.
---
You have essentially 3 buttons (4 if you include mind control for throwing people off cliff memes) and you can roll your face across the keyboard to kill about 80% of other classes.
---
Well, no, there're quite a few bugs - according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HmeFqag7dzkvibcbvcenWtY3XJLihmvmPNtlnqqsEEo/edit#gid=0) anyway.
---
I know as tryhard you are not allowed to think like I do, but at this moment I can't decide between paladin and hunter. I don't even want to be one of a million mages, rogues and warriors. The old paladin represents his class fantasy so well and the hunter is such a deep class.
---
Pve Shamans are king. All hybrids in the game are shit but shamans, thats how strong their utility is.  Even then you are better off just taking 8+ resto shamans, but if you are at 7 resto shamans 1 enh shaman is worth taking. 
---
But this isn't simply why, interrupts, kiting, healing, tankiness, totems for everything, and so on allow them to basically never let a 5 man fail. Druids are similar to a lesser degree, but add nothing compared to shamans end game pve. 
---
I play priest and can admit that every raid should stack resto shamans until they hit their healing cap minus -2, for one priest and one druid. This remains true in TBC even.
---
Still shamans are the least rewarding class to level imo.
---
So much salt. I'm just saying it's an option
---
Yes, but Asmongold is bad at the game and even then he stopped twinking.
---
So he kinda contradictd himself.
---
So I got downvoted for making a joke about my little brother being a “human bot” and how he is going to grind out my PvP honor..
---
People bitched about how I would get banned cause its technically a form of “acc sharing” so I went and opened a ticket to confirm.
---
My little brother is 100% going to play the shit out of my Mage. I’m going to make him sit in BG’s whenever i’m not there to grind the ranks. Blizz says thats cool though.
---
Hunters don't have the skills to effectively kite for that long at lvl 19. The rogue will eventually catch up once wing clip runs out.
---
If there is an item that, say a warlock vs a mage needs, the class leaders then organize those priorities and communicate that in their own ways. It also depends on how much time somebody has waited for that said item, similar to DKP in that way but at the same time feels less cutthroat and more supportive as a whole.
---
And this is a retail baby everyone.
---
You can't trade the loot when it's been given out. Its isn't like in retail where you have 2 hours to trade it. The person that wins it keeps it, this helps in dungs so that people can't roll on items for your friends.
---
its about 1 proc per minute and it awards most often will and blessing. Will stacks 5 times, everything else stacks indefinitely.
---
and when i say 1 proc per minute thats just auto attack whit its base speed.
---
Because it summons an add you can weapon swap but like i said it all stacks so you wont want too.
---
You make a pug every week and says bindings are ress, easy as that.
---
What level bracket? If you aren’t going for cap you could do a 19 or 29 twink and just ambush as a rogue lol. That’s what I did as a kid and loved it.
---
"I hate leveling"  
---
Don't play warrior.
---
Actually, in the beta and stress test, the relics never despawn
---
That’s exactly what happened.  I suppose I didn’t view it as a negative thing.  I had a lot of fun gearing up alts easily and prepping for WotLK.  I don’t think content should always be easy, but I really have no qualms with it being easy for a month before it becomes obsolete with the release of a new expansion.
---
Female NE Hunter for me!  Wanting to play hunter and going Ally because of friends, plus loving the bow animations, it's the only choice.
---
You did fail math it seems.
---
Ye I fell you. 12h a day work for me (so its like 60h/w), leaving house at 6am, coming back 6pm, going out with my dog and gf. PLaying casually, sometimes pushing hard (12h a day sunday) Then housing, food, sleep. Still managable to hit 60lvl in like  three months and catch up other hardcore raiders which are already raidlogging for 2 months.
---
You do know that on bosses you press 1 button 99% of the time until you can go Fire where you press a button 90% of the time instead?
---
&gt; No one knows how will this be on Classic
---
why dont we?  its atleast 1 ppm, possibly higher since items with only  a chance on hit are a bit higher, since thats all the weapon does
---
So, raid?
---
Is this just a generational thing? Why do so many people seem to want this in a switch or phone now? What's wrong with leaving a computer game on the computer?
---
&gt;No video game developer would ever intentionally design a system that incentivizes logging out over playing the game.
---
Rested Exp
---
Yea... Will be a shame if it's only procs like this once a month :D
---
Doesn't add much imo.. but I guess no class in classic (hah) has a very engaging/fun rotation
---
Nothing has been said but most likely sub only no f2p
---
I think not. Reching lvl 20 is a lot of play. If it got something trial version maybe the lvl 5 will the max or lvl10.
---
???? Then there’s no problem. They’re mutually exclusive groups. People who enjoy endgame content as well as taking leveling slowly, and people who just want to get to 60 ASAP. It’s part of the reason this whole post and OP is ridiculous because people act like they can decide what is best for other players and what they “should” be enjoying. Let people play for what they want to do and sit down.
---
It does in 1.12 so it probably will in 1.13.
---
I only consider something "known" if it works in a certain way on Beta, and/or confirmed by a blue post like hit thing or parry thing.
---
Strength and Honor.
---
It's a pretty good hunter weapon for melee hunter in pvp. It slows the attack speed of person you attack, which will make it so the warrior doesn't get as much rage. 
---
Just look up vanilla thunderfury hunter pvp or something, it's a video of a blood elf hunter (used an old program to change his files called tmorpgh) at 60 , I believe it's prepatch, destroying people in pvp
---
in australia that's about a standard casual rate for starting out jobs. 22-25 per hour
---
The Summon was on Private Servers like Feenix, Nostalrius and so on. Original it says the Add will vanish after the buff. So without any cooldown and a 2h Fury (Horde Windfury + HoJ) you can stack it up... :D
---
EU tends to raid a few hours ahead of NA, but you can find a good mix of both crowds on any 1.12 pserver. There are several that are based in western Europe, and the ping from US East is not unplayable. Remember this is Vanilla we are talking about, there are few situations where low ping time affects the outcome. Vanilla is mostly about coming prepared.
---
But dude, alliance or horde??????
---
If it connects to the same accounts as PC: That!
---
Well, you'll have the rest of your life to get promotions, but you'll only be able to experience wow classic launch once :p
---
Would be nice to have infinite amount of summoning warlocks for free.
---
Don't do that. Don't give me hope.
---
Nah, it's not like in retail where you can need on stuff for your friends.
---
I'm surprised people don't know this on this sub
---
Honestly it would look like shit.  I play rocket league on Xbox, comp, and switch and it looks like absolute ass on switch.  Maybe it’s just the game?  Either way, I’d play it with a controller if it was feasible.
---
Well I'm raiding Naxx, so I was thinking Naxx. If we're talking MC then all the druids could go boomkin and the warriors could go arms and you'd still complete the raid. 
---
In Naxx a ret is actually somewhat viable on many fights, but especially on the trash and like most raids in vanilla, the trash can be harder than the bosses. You won't see them in a hardcore raid of course, but in a mid-tier guild they can absolutely keep up with the hunters and probably pass them. Grabbing a Nightfall further enhances it by giving 9 raiders 15% bonus damage, which btw stacks multiplicably so it's actually more than 15%. A naked shadowbolt that hits for 1000 will hit for 1150 with DS, 1322 with shadow weaving and 1587 with imp SB. Putting Nightfall up further increases that by 238 damage up to 1825 which is actually a 23.8% upgrade instead of just 15%. If we then add on crit, which will be at about 40% without world buffs, you're looking at about a 33% damage increment. So a ret paladin who can have a far higher uptime on NF compared to a warrior while also doing more dps will add 2,5 raiders worth of extra damage while also doing the dps of maybe half a normal dps.
---
What do you guys make at a hungry jacks ?
---
Good one you for not pushing out some half assed "prebis" abomination.
---
Registering is a huge turnoff for me personally, and all modern browsers support frontend localstorage. Since you already have public link hashing sorted for profiles, could there perhaps be a localstorage option in the future?
---
But you are playing an emulation not the real actual wow product. So your perception is still skewed. You can't compare the two. Private servers may feel different but if you look under the hood they are not the same game at all.
---
Put it in Iceland for equal ping.
---
&gt; Sincerely, A Warrior
---
Well, that's convenient isn't it
---
I've got a tauren warrior who's looking to tank and myself a shaman looking for more people. We plan on being 60 by phase two, starting a guild and raiding smarter not harder. We have deep vanilla experience into naxx(but never cleared), love pvp, but have families and full time jobs. We're going to be somewhere from 5-10 central time with more time dedicated on weekends.
---
It's pretty close, depending on the type of server.
---
PVP is like 52:48 Horde / Alliance
---
PVE is like 52:48 Alliance / Horde
---
no the switch isn't touchscreen
---
D-pad + ABXY is 8 buttons, LR bumpers to rapidly toggle through hotbars.
---
Or just go Earthbind 2h kiting whit rockbiter
---
You can ninja the first binding, swap server, ninja again, swap server and complete it. Or just use an offensive name for a free name change when people start spamming tickets about you ninjaing, or just pay for a name change
---
I mean it's probably about 50x.
---
Shard of the Fallen Star. Finally found it lol
---
If you enjoy the emulation more go play that. Don't expect the actual product to meet your expectations. Just play what feels best to you.
---
&gt; tf? what is authentic about bugs all over the place? 
---
Bugs would be very authentic, I remember the game crashing A LOT inf the first year.
---
Class: warrior. Just warrior. It's the tank class. Bears can tank 5mans well enough but raids... They'll be offtank and are good for some fights, but if you want to tank, it's warrior.
---
Don't know about differences between retail and classic.
---
Level with some leveling spec, you can tank leveling dungeons fine with whatever. Having a partner while leveling as a warrior can be good, it's notoriously one of the hardest classes to level with. And if you do have a healer with you, getting those dungeon groups going will be a breeze.
---
It would work with mapping actual buttons to targets but that falls apart in a 40 man environment and the game is just not designed around that.
---
That being said, there are addons that do everything healing related in one button. Of course they can just heal reactively, but that’s the way most healers tend to heal until they perhaps get more experienced. I know a lot of people that healed Naxx just by spinning their mousewheel.
---
I thought I read a blue post about trading like that not existing for 5 mans, but existing for raids.
---
Double that easily by including the D-pad and have movement with the sticks only.
---
Oh yeah he must have meant 1 spell
---
My cat: I bet he forgot to feed me. It's been 3 minutes. I'm starving.
---
Me: Not sure if I should choose a warlock as a known quantity or a mage for something completely new.
---
1. The diffrences are to big, its diffrent games.   
---
But to cut it short, its less dps tanking, more single target than aoe. And you have threat to handle.  
---
2.  Warrior or Druid  
---
3. You can level as Tank, but its just slower you dont gain anything, not even doing instances while leveling, a dps warrior makes the run faster and he has higher threat.
---
4.  Prot Warrior
---
Yes it is
---
This reads like just a private server ass kissing post.
---
So hard man ☹
---
lol, this so much
---
Weapon skill is independent of spec.
---
It does have a touchscreen. Just found a video showcasing it.
---
The best tank is probably a prot warrior. It is also the worse spec to lvl, so people indeed usually spec DPS until they hit 60.
---
🙂
---
Touch screen, and when at home I'd just use computer.
---
it's gone.
---
To expand on what this person says: If you think you have enough fiber in your diet, *think again*.
---
Seriously, it is very difficult to get 38g of fiber every day. Your two slices of healthy bread are not enough.
---
Warrior is the primary tank class, and while paladin/Druid are viable in 5 man they are less so in raids.  
---
Leveling prot is slow, but if you have a healer leveling with you it makes it go much faster because you can get healed while your rage is high and cut your downtime a lot.  
---
Skill / level help out a lot more while in dungeons than spec while leveling, and if you tank dungeons you will probably get enough gear to be fine not prot from 1-60. I mean even a good shaman can potentially tank 5 mana while leveling, though not ideal.
---
The hype is not dying man.
---
Every single day that get us closer to August 27th, is a day that hype goes up a lil bit...we just don't go on Twitch. What is it to see? We already seen it. We no longer google search about Classic...why would we? We KNOW the release date. We KNOW that beta is stale now, with lvl 40 cap being reached a week ago.
---
We are still hyped, we just don't have any reason to watch beta now, or push the google trends numbers because we know what it is to know about Classic already.
---
The battles themselves aren't a problem. But they come with a lot of baggage:   
---
 - Pet journal   
---
 - Cross character pets   
---
 - Pets are designed around "balance"     
---
 - Pet dailies reward non-pet rewards (like silver, XP, et)   
---
At least a card game could be built without impacting the over-world (aside from trade/AH). I cannot imagine implementing pet battles without for example a pet journal, nobody can carry around dozens of pets.
---
&gt;What are substantial differences between Classic and Legion tanking?
---
You need to hold aggro with a very-very limited and weak toolkit. On the other hand, survivability is less of an issue, and you can't do much to stay alive, except yelling at your healer.
---
&gt;What are the tank options for Classic for each faction?
---
Warrior and warrior. Druids and paladins can tank 1-60 just fine (arguably better than warriors), but will have issues in raids (especially paladin).
---
&gt;Is it recommended to roll tank spec while levelling or should I DPS then tank at 60? Additionally, would it be ideal to level with a partner if I plan to tank?
---
DPS, leveling as tank is very inefficient. So a buddy isn't really needed (although it helps any warrior because they're weak levelers).
---
&gt;What is the best tank spec available in terms of both playability and efficiency?
---
Since you're leveling as DPS - ask it again when you're 60 :)
---
two-handed is a talent for shaman
---
Snooga is the next entry
---
Just read that blue post. It's going to be retarded af and is going to be abused to abused by people buying gear from each other.
---
Checks out
---
Most of us cleared up to AQ20/40 in vanilla without ever flasking and tbh the reason we didn't get to Naxx wasn't because of flasks. I don't even remember how much flasks used to sell for because we never used them.
---
ouff. thats gonna be horrible
---
Loved that shield
---
&gt; destroying people in pvp
---
When was the last time you saw a video of someone NOT destroying people in PVP ?
---
Anyway i'd rather have a big 2 handers than TF : a raptor strike crit then get away.
---
He want dynamic respawns and megaservers, he's one of those private server players that want a bunch of changes to the game.
---
Yes. I wonder when they plan to stop the beta.
---
Tank class = Warrior
---
Tanking = Much harder in Classic, threat is your top priority, micromanaging in multi mob pulls. CCing and being a group leader is paramount.
---
Leveling = Level Arms or Fury and all you need is a sword and shield to tank with when you have to.
---
Grouping: Yes, do it whenever you can while leveling. Even if you're just questing and see a friendly player on the same quest, ask to group up. 
---
Warriors play well with others.
---
Is it literally just frostbolt spam the entire time?
---
Someone is a WOTLK baby. It's okay at least you can say you tried.
---
Well, that is a bug thats needs to be fixed. Ill do a bug report :P
---
Yes, no reason to cast anything else on a boss unless there's adds you have to aoe.
---
Back in classic it was very protection warrior heavy, there were a few paladins and druids, but not many. Differences for the warrior in classic is you had to get a certain amount of block and parry percentages, and also the defence skill must be very high to reduce damage taken. I was a tank in a lot of vanilla raiding, it is much more enjoyable back then because you really had to fight more for the threat
---
I think this time I'm going to roll RPG server with a gnome warrior. Screw min/maxing a human
---
True, but having a thunderfury is prestige, having a thunderfury as a hunter is good status, as long as you didn't ninja it.
---
Thanks a bunch for your tests! As I suspected it's not even remotely as profitable as it was on pservers. Rogue diaries sold for 45 silver each and dropped alot more from the boxes. Interesting to see how it will impact peoples decision to play rogues and that farm wont really be an option. I made 25-35 G an hour on pservers pickpocketing all 4 SM instances.  
---

The game was out 15 years ago, also blackblade still exists in the game. We know its potential
---
The problem is, creep. First it is hair, then face, then before you know it transmogs and we're back to retail.   
---
I could get onboard with ONLY hair style/color, but people have no self control and will keep pushing.
---
Or just giving feedback like a normal person. I can't think of any situation where freaking out would be the best way of communicating. If your arguments are good enough and the feedback is valid concerns there is no need to exaggarate your way of communicating.
---
you people are beyond stupid..
---
Because cougars are 3dpd
---
Then play on a PvE server and go dueling outside of org/IF
---
I CANT STOP THIS FEELING
---
Ads are toxic, whatever the format. I know it, i work for the ad industry.
---
well unlike you i acutally played vanilla .. idiot
---
I gather my Hunter boys and we aimhot everything down :)
---
Ungoro Mafia will be back!
---
I mean you can get carried through the most difficult content in the game, doesn’t mean you’re actually doing it well.
---
It sounds counterintuitive but you have less downtime and you use flame weapon with a fast attack speed and it just works like a champ.
---
No. The blue post states that it's 1% more than we ever knew about. It talked about the additional mechanic if having "more than 10 difference" between your weapon skill and your targets defense skill.
---
That's on top of the little known formula for actually hitting your target.
---
im not sure what you are trying to tell me...
---
As per [/u/PaManiacOwca/](https://www.reddit.com/user/PaManiacOwca/) tests. It vendored for 2 silver and 50 copper as I suspected. And his runs weren't at all as profitable as on pservers. Link to his results here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c0ol0g/rogue\_on\_classic\_beta\_pick\_pocket\_farming\_30\_min/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c0ol0g/rogue_on_classic_beta_pick_pocket_farming_30_min/)
---
no and you are obviously a mongoid
---
Excuse me sir? Thats BLASPHEMY
---
Stupid question. Maybe beta access would answer this if I had it. What’s the point of account/character restores? Can you transfer select toons to the classic servers? Don’t these just get restored to retail?
---
Well weaponskill doesn't matter in pvp so that's something.
---
Sigh. Having a 6% hit cap as opposed to 9% is by no means tiny in vanilla’s itemization. You end up gimping 2-3 item slots. As a comparison, it is a bit like not being allowed to wear any gloves (which is a slot that can get you 2% hit).
---
Shadowmeld is legitimately next level, though. It can be a must have in coordinated PvP.
---
Nah, it takes real dedication to level warrior to 60.  It’s almost like bashing your head into the wall repeatedly at points.
---
A lot of people that start warrior give up and go to an easier class to level.
---
1h with flametongue is similar damage but way more consistent. You may blow up a mob with 2h windfury but then not have a proc for the next 3 mobs. I think they both average out to similar damage on a large scale, but 1h is more consistent and you take less damage due to the shield.
---
Nothing masculine about playing MMOs, weirdo.
---
Living Bomb and Classic REEEHEEE
---
Sit/Crit will NOT be a thing in Classic. Already confirmed
---
On Private Servers the Summoned Add will be alive and dont vanish after giving the buff. It means the original text said:  
---
When this weapon procs, it summons an elemental which casts a random spell and then disappears
---
So it can procc everytime since it has no internal cooldown.
---
No what's stupid is this sort of incessant whining about how private servers are somehow better.
---
As per [/u/PaManiacOwca/](https://www.reddit.com/user/PaManiacOwca/) tests. His runs weren't at all as profitable as on pservers.

---
Definetly think pservers got that wrong.
---
Ooohhh I forgot this. I thought 2 handed was learned from the trainer.
---
In that case you lose it I think.
---
I don’t think you lose weapon skill with respecs
---
had my switch for a solid year. had no idea
---
I watched a lot of Warrior streamers trying Sit/Crit in the Beta and it didn't work.
---
I thought this was confirmed not to work.
---
I did include that, only I called it arrows instead. I didn't include them together because using both A, B, X and Y *and* the D-pad means you will sometimes have to move your thumb from your movement stick to use abilities. That's why I suggested the 20 done with A, B, X and Y + modifiers are your main abilities and such, then the D-pad + modifiers are for lesser used stuff like consumables, mount or whatever you are okay with having binded to keys you share with your thumb used for movement.
---
Honestly we'll just have to see. It might be super useful, it might not be.
---
Generally more streamlined and intuitive combat. There's something to be said about lack of complexity in the newer systems, but that's not inherent in the system itself, it's just a separate design decision. 
---
The group finder in BfA is great. Put your group up on the LFG list and then get a list of all the players applying. It's basically a graphical interface replacing trade chat spam with the exact same functionality. 
---
World quests are actually a great idea. Imagine if Classic had quests dynamically spawning across the world you could do to grind rep, money, resources, etc. The implementation in BfA, combined with AP, is maybe not that fun, but the core idea is still great. 
---
The last few WoW expansions has had some amazing raid encounters, even BfA has had some really cool ones. Probably the best part about modern WoW. 
---
While difficulty levels can be a bit wonky, at higher difficulties dungeons are actually really good. The average dungeon in modern WoW arguably have more important mechanics than old school raids. 
---
This is maybe controversial, but modern WoW is way more challenging than older expansions. A lot of the game is a complete cakewalk, but when you get to the proper end game the difficulty ramps up way more than old WoW. 
---
At least BfA has had some really cool looking armor sets. It sucks that they got rid of class sets. But just looking at the models we got they are actually really cool/unique. Even levelling gear actually looks awesome. [Cloth](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/696758.jpg) and [leather](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/696759.jpg) levelling gear for example. 
---
Classes and specs are way more balanced than they used to be. 
---
Again, controversial, but the new talent system is way more intuitive and gives you more actually meaningful customisation for your spec. The old tree system was too locked in on the tree structure, now you have combinations to choose from each tier instead of going down the same trees regardless. 
---
The new spec redesign also made specs more unique, each having it's own playstyle. Instead of only changing one or two spells and maybe some bonuses like in the olden days. 
---
You have entire new classes to play, DK, Monk, DH. 
---
There's a huge world to explore, and a ton of cool stuff to collect if you're into that sort of thing (I'm personally not, but I know a lot of WoW players are).
---
Where's this from?
---
Lets hope it will be useful. :)
---
I can’t decide between mage priest or pally for alt
---
yeah neither do i mane
---
Totally underrated, especially if you need a quick eat/drink without getting targeted. I escaped ganks on my meme priest with meld, even the ones that found me had to walk up and get feared at least until AoE spells were a thing.  Biggest thing is you get time to eat and drink and you do so much drinking if you're a mana class in Classic WoW. Sooooooooooo Sooooooooooooooo much drinking.
---
TBC did a lot of good things, and Wotlk also had a couple imo, but after that its hard to find someting that was good, gameplay wise
---
I seriously lol'd when I got to that part at the end. The class that does nothing for anyone else wants a ton of free handouts so they can get to 60 faster and push the rest of us out of groups and take our gear. 
---
My favorite is warriors using the mobs I'm fighting to charge to so they can get where they're going faster, but won't actually help us kill the thing.
---
So in pvp, you use both 2-h and 1-h and shield as enhance. 2-h verses casters, shield verses physical damage dealers (including hunter).
---
But enhance is shamans worst pvp spec by a far amount (they are rather good healers and ele shamans save when mages have their 3 minute cds up are probably the best burst range there is.)
---
While leveling 2-h is the fastest with rockbiter not WF... i know. However, 1-h and shield enh/ele hybrid spec gets real darn close.
---
In 5 - 20 man groups resto is very wanted. In 40 man raids a shaman a group is almost always as good as any other class. Unlike druids who might add 3-5% dps per each other melee/caster in party if SUPER lucky, shamans can add 8-15% per each other party member. So as long as the raid doesn't have 7-8 resto shamans an enh shaman or two is totally viable. Ele runs into issues with nature resists.
---
 **&lt;Thinkin Bout Thos Beans&gt; - Alliance - NA - Normal/PvE**
---
We're a casual guild looking to expand our roster for Classic release so we have plenty of people to level, do dungeons, and complete group content with. Eventually leading to raid progression sometime in fall.
---
Our guild consists of a mixed group of raiding veterans and casual players who cannot wait for Classic release. We are all working adults who have been playing WoW together for many years, with some of us playing together since Vanilla. We are always on the lookout for new players who want to have a good laugh and complete content at a pace that is fulfilling, but not overbearing.
---
**Raid Times:** Sundays, 7pm-11pm EST. Raids will start after plenty of time is given for players to level and gear up. Aiming for early November.
---
We are looking for any **DPS and Healer** at the moment.
---
You can join us at our Discord. If you are looking for a community that plays games beyond WoW, we run giveaways and server events, while playing various other multiplayer titles.
---
**Discord:** [https://discord.gg/PuJsk5H](https://discord.gg/PuJsk5H) (mention WoW Classic)
---
That. Is. The. Joke.
---
Yes, definitely agree. Being more of an Einzelganger the fuckup-insurance of the Paladin helps, but the stigma towards Paladins will probably make me tear my hair out on several occasions. Knowing is half the battle I guess :-)
---
Nike
---
Night elf warriors look badass too
---
If there are a few hunters with jumper cables, then it's not going to be useful.  
---
Rogues can drop out of combat with vanish, right?  should be enough jumper cables in raid to not bother with cloaking device on a class that can't drop combat.
---
Just remembered soul stones were a thing, so cloaking device would only be to save money on repairs. While having the interesting effect of making it slightly more likely that the raid wipes, due to it taking up trinket slot.    
---
Could let hunter kite a boss longer, letting them feign death get back up shoot boss again, run some more and finally go invisible.  
---
I'm still trying to figure out what professions I should do, both for levelling up at at raid level. Tailoring gives a nice chest but it's very expensive, so might be best with double gathering until I know I can afford it. Engineering's fun though.
---
Pretty sure the numbers are wrong and from pservers. At 300 skill your penalty is 40%. At 305 it was IIRC 9%.
---
Search for magey’s github if you want to see the beta table.
---
Well first of all tanking in dungeons and tanking in raids are vastly different. You can have a hunter's pet tank dungeons just fine, but that won't fly in raids. 
---
Second, which class do you want to tank with?
---
Warriors are the most versatile and there are like two bosses in the entire game they can't tank. They have the best defensives and decent threat. 90% of the game's raid tanks will be warriors.  
---
Druid tanks have an insane TPS but are very squishy due to not being able to reach def cap. For that reason they are very good offtanks but as main tanks they are not the best. Certainly doable, just not the best.   
---
Paladin tanks are not really used in raids because of their lack of single target threat. They are amazing as AoE threat though since their consecrate hits all targets. A good group with a prot paladin can fly through strath/scholo so fast it's almost like a Legion dungeon. Just pull and AoE. Their use in raids is mostly tanking trash that doesn't hit too hard. Some examples are the imps in MC, dragons in Suppression Room in BWL, the tunnel in AQ40 and spiderlings in Naxxramas. Most guilds do without them in raids though. 
---
The biggest change is probably threat. In vanilla (and TBC) threat is a big deal and since most bosses in raids are immune to taunt you will have to generate enough threat to make the boss attack you. You also have to use your defensive cooldowns and abilities while trying to maximise your threat. 
---
Another thing is that most mechanics in vanilla revolve around your tanks and maybe one or two other raiders chosen at random. You have to tank swap, move the boss, use cooldowns etc. while the rest of the raid is just standing in place spamming their spells for most of the fight. So as a tank you will have to focus a lot more on raid mechanics than anyone else.
---
Lastly, don't level as tank spec. You can tank just fine in any spec while leveling up. Paladins do want consecration though which is a holy talent. Otherwise just bring a shield and some stamina heavy gear.
---
On top of that.. the first week or two will be slammed; Full starting zones, buried NPCs, ganked NPCs perhaps, Need 10 wolves (thousand players trying to kill the same 10 wolves), AH empty (you are expected to fill it), AH has stuff nobody can afford, etc...
---
First week or two may be a shitshow. You will have time to catch up on the important stuff.
---
Doesn't really seem like a question they would need to lie about though. There's no reason to not believe their answer.
---
Who cares seriously ? Is your life so bland you need prestige in a video game ? oO
---
And no it's not good status, everybody will think of you as the huntard that deprived a warrior / rogue from it.
---
Took me a while as well found out by accident when I dropped it
---
I played EVE Online for 4 years where everyone (except for china) is playing on the same server, playing with people from NA is for the most part around 6 hours difference. It's almost impossible if you have a job and need to get up in the morning etc, and if you join a very NA heavy group there is very few people online in your main time zone.
---
It’s closer to 10% than to 3%.
---
truly despicable people.
---
Warriors won't be getting an free buffs or heals from me while leveling or in pvp.  
---
Your friend,  
---
a Paladin
---
Right? lol
---
Hey, sometimes they'll need some rage and then they'll autoattack your mob once after charging :p
---
idk if this is a question or something...
---
I am answering your post. 
---
the proc summons an add, he will buff you and do some auto attacks and leave.
---
I know it can proc everytime...
---
holy jesus christ, so it's stupid to complain that a bunch of nerds in their free time got the stuff right and the billion dollar company doens't? please shut the fuck up you imbecile. your only reason in life seems to be to remind people how fucking retarded reddit is
---
Hey, just following up. I don't know if you caught it but someone posted a great BiS-finder in this subreddit yesterday. You could use the stat equivalence functions there to see precisely how much worse your set gear is than the common prescribed BiS.
---
[https://sixtyupgrades.com/](https://sixtyupgrades.com/)
---
Or twink and actually get to participate in pvp most of the time, instead of the other way around. No one with a healthy playtime is raiding and pvping at the same time, maintaining a majority of time spent pvping. It's just not possible with repair costs and consumable costs and making sure you have raid BiS.
---
So you've never been probably of something you've achieved in a game?
---
I was in my 40's when Vanilla came out, and I still think that it's more fun than more recent expansions, which tend to be over-engineered to be so convenient that they are boring.
---
My scheme is to just pick a word out of the dictionary. Stormdrain has been my favorite thus far.
---
Shouldn't be this in the wow sub?
---
This was a Herror !
---
Let me help you out. It is absolutely good, great even! Try farming materials as a protection Paladin, or a Restoration Druid. Or using your full PvP spec in a PvE scenario as a Warlock. 
---
I was mildly surprised Blizzard did not add this feature to Classic WoW, as it is easily in the top ten of "great features added after 1.12".
---
I'm already using and rdp client to fish...  will try herbalism when I get around to it.
---
All of the math you just did around nightfall has nothing to do with who weilds the weapon. A ret will have less uptime than an offtank sunder spaming, so the benefit you get from the proc is mitigated by the bad uptime it will have from a ret auto attacking. 
---
Just get another real dps if you have too much healing and let the off tank sunder spam with NF. It will have a higher uptime and the overall raid damage is objectively higher.
---
"fuck you" a horrible, bigoted sex-negative slur. are you going to apologize? 
---
or is it just the sodomites and transgenders that deserve special treatment?
---
seems unfair
---
I loved playing hunter and Shadowmelding at a flag and while they're distracted capping it just get a free aimed shot out of the bush because they didn't notice me.
---
What is that one spell?
---
If I'm not mistaken, [classicdb.ch](https://classicdb.ch) uses data from pservers which is why it would show up as it is selling for 45 silver, since the pservers devs got it wrong most likely.
---
Classic wowhead on the other hand uses the actual classic data and here it shows up more in tune with OPs testresults:  [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=24282/rogues-diary](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=24282/rogues-diary)
---
Please don't let this turn into a birthday cake, tattoo, wedding invitation, fan art sub.. keep it on r/wow for the love of god

But you just said that raiders are putting half the effort.
---
So for sure you'll have more time to PvP, right?
---
He said he has a 6 day weekend to do it in, as in he plans to level to 60 in 6 IRL days, not just /played. That would absolutely ruin the experience for anyone. Imagine trying to stay awake for nearly 6 days, you aren't going to be having fun.
---
I was like this 15 years ago except i was so attached to my character name i always deleted my character and started a new one with the same name. This time around if i dont want to level my one and only character im logging out, not doing that shit again ever.
---
Nah, I like PvP. More power to you for enjoying camping corpses of characters 40 levels below you.
---
Except there is in raids.
---
Daytime raider, shift work.  Have a few daytime raiding friends. We raided 10am CST to 1pm.  We are casual in the sense of we dont allow berating other members for performance, snip drama out early before it snowballs.  That being said we've been on last boss for mythic progression every raid since beginning of legion.
---
...ok....i was appalled at first. But now that i think about it....yeah im cool with it.
---
Maybe you're inviting this homophobia, have you ever thought of that?
---
you're being very unpleasant, while intentionally hiding behind your sexual predelictions. 
---
typical liberal stuff, I know, but doesnt make it any more pathetic.
---
This.  Touchscreen plus holding down a button for a modifier.  Bet it would work great.
---
I don't think most people have issues with chill streamers and stuff, it's more of a meme at this point. Some are toxic as well as their community, but streamers aren't all bad.
---
PvP isn't going to be made easier by an "easier rotation" on an "easier class". regardless of rotation it all boils down to controlling the fight which consists of knowing the opponents abilities and forcing their hand on their "oh shit" abilities. If you're going casual, you'll benefit more from playing a class you truly find fun and engaging vs what's "easiest". To dominate in PvP you'll need to put in effort, as in repetition, repetition, repetition which takes you out of the "casual" category. There are some instances however when someone is more naturally skilled in PvP. But the easiest form of PvP is a Mage in Alterac Valley during a turtle spamming Blizzard. So Again, I'd do some searching on here and the Googles for info on PvP from Vanilla and pick what strikes your fancy. Playing what you enjoy is important as a casual.
---
DO NOT TRY TO LEVEL AS A PROT WARRIOR!
---
Level as fury until mortal strike or maybe level 45 so you can keep the +5% crit from the fury tree before switching to Arms. Switch to prot at level 58 and start going for your pre-bis before you hit 60.
---
You can tank all instances leveling up as whatever spec.
---
There never was a problem, he asked for opinions/answers and he received them. The groups you mentioned are not mutually exclusive though. You are in fact allowed to level quickly and also enjoy it while doing so. Chewing a starburst and swallowing it quicker than sucking on it doesn't mean you didn't enjoy it lol.
---
And the difference is much larger than 3%.
---
The mount (and pet, but mostly mount) specific page, so that your bags are not overflowing with different mounts. Small quality of life improvement, but boy was I happy with it!
---
Thats kinda what I like about it aswell. Its so simple it gives me attention room to watch out and help others while keeping up.
---
Also its the micro stuff like timing engneering stuff to be that 1% better than others. 
---
Also I plan on playing alot and have the gear advantage. With ge asr advantage I should always be the nr. 1 mage in the guild. Thats my goal.
---
&gt;all the Alliance environments really bore me  
---
What is Iron-motherfucking-forge ?

Check out Skarm Tank on YouTube.

Challenge modes and Mage Tower were great. Say what you will about WoD but it's dungeons were amazing and I thoroughly enjoying running CM's in them.
---
Probably a peasant if you don't have a switch
---
personal preference is a fun thing.
---
I'm sure easy bindings will be present in one of the addons. I'll try and give you a heads up if I find one.
---
So, level 20s are not players?
---
&gt; What are substantial differences between Classic and Legion tanking?
---
In classic you do very little damage while tanking.
---
You don't really have a whole lot in terms of abilities to generate AoE-threat, so the way of doing it against several mobs is to switch targets.
---
&gt; What are the tank options for Classic for each faction?
---
Warrior and Feral-Druid. Paladin can kinda tank too but the lack of a taunt makes it not really viable.
---
&gt; Is it recommended to roll tank spec while levelling or should I DPS then tank at 60?
---
Tanking without tank-spec is pretty common throughout the leveling phase. As is healing without a healing-spec.
---
&gt; Additionally, would it be ideal to level with a partner if I plan to tank?
---
Leveling with a partner is much better for almost everyone, not just tanks.
---
What’s rdp?
---
Divine shield
---
Other recent projects using the Nost core also have a Lotus spawn in each AV. It's the primary way for some PvP Rankers to have an income. There are players who will queue into a fresh AV so they can grab the Lotus and then immediately AFK out.
---
Oooh yay someone replied. What's the best professions for priest? I was watching and reading some more about vanilla and since I love priests and I've mained it on retail for the last year and a half I was thinking maybe priest.
---
I know dwarf would be the best race for priest. Or humans maybe. And undead on horde. What about professions for a priest?

You have 8% miss chance but 1% hit has no effect. You need 9% to get it to zero. At 305 you have 6% miss chance and need 6% to get it to zero.

This subreddit often is with the bullshit people spout out. Like this post.

As in half the effort to the PVP gear set equivalent. Please don't tell me you legitimately believe raiding two nights is anywhere near as hard as achieving high warlord in PvP. Because if you are trying to say that, there's nothing left to talk about.
---
There is always a higher level one :D
---
Oh THANK you.
---
Lol not in BGs tho. They have to defend flag room and nodes in AB solo. A lone mediocre rogue won't cut it.
---
Fairly sure he's talking about Blizz separating twinks from regular leveling characters in low level BGs, into their own queues. This happened like a few weeks or months ago I think?
---
Then the salt pouring out of all those twinks was amazing, as they had "worked hard" for it and other people were "just crying", never mind that they would literally one-shot anyone who was just leveling and wanted to have a bit of fun in PvP.
---
Not sure how many twinks there are now but I can imagine a lot of them stopped once they had to actually fight against similarly geared players.
---
15 an hour probably, sometimes a bit higher if you're a bit older than 16
---
Try living in Brazil and playing with 350ms back then.
---
Now I play with "just" 150 ms so it's awesome :p
---
Yeah a 19 twink warrior pala rogue or hunter can easily win 3v1 against normal geared people
---
Help the game as in get new players on new platforms, increasing popularity and income as a whole.
---
There are many other MMOs that have opened up for consoles and gained solid tracking on them, despite game on them being what you would call inferior to the PC experience. I think ESO might have more console players than PC players or had at some point. 
---
Just because something sounds silly, doesn't mean there is no market for it.
---
Cuz when i saw it ib use it was a warrior with titans grip who had 2 and he gave us about 10 stacks of the haste and had perma 250 stats 
---
They would of nerfed it if anything
---
Rets have a much higher uptime because seals proc NF as well. Only hunters have a higher uptime and then you would have to convince a hunter to sacrifice his dps and everything to just weave NF and I'm not throwing a 600g+ weapon on a player and then tell him he can't play his class normally. 
---
The whole thing with this thread is that we can't just throw out a healer and bring in more dps. We have to have 5 paladins/shamans, 5 druids and 5 priests. Most raids do well with like 7-8 healers.
---
Seems pretty accurate between the two.
---
I have a really good name picked out for a warlock.
---
I have no idea if I want to play warlock or not.
---
Yet I've seen it on a stream. It's subtle, because it's not just "you sit for crit and proc", but "you sit, get crit (it itself is normal behaviour), you stand, game thinks you're critted when standing, you get proc".
---
Outfitter or whatever it is called. Beeing able to switch between different gear sets without having to check where that one item is in your bags is quite nice in my opinion.
---
Didn't they fixed that in 1.11 ? I'm not sure.
---
My favorite class is priest. I'm not going to have time to deal with farming as a healer spec and not being able to solo world content or world pvp or pay for respecs so it's just not going to happen this time.  I've got no time to level 2 characters and I don't want to deal with alts except a bank chacter to mail stuff to.  So I'm going hunter so I can be independent and do my best to be social and get groups, but I can always fall back on soloing and being able to PvP.  That's another thing as a hunter - I will NOT missing getting Viper Sting spammed or simply polymophed through entire fights anymore. Can't deal with that bullshit either.  It's too bad, I'm a better priest I just can't go through that again.

awesome! I will message you closer to the expansion so we can get together and figure stuff out.
---
They were "cookies" back on Malygos. :P
---
Sounds like you got the FRESH experience. The real rush of classic wow and how it was a community game vs an action RPG.
---
I used to only build PCs but as I got older the Laptop just became a staple. I don't think I'll ever own a tower PC again.
---
Aside from the mobility it's more so the convenance of not having to dedicate an entire corner of my house to a gaming station, if I want to play on my back deck or in my bed I can. If I have company over and I want to clean up the house I just toss my Laptop in the closet.
---
If I want to sit down and play in the same spot over and over I'll just hook it up to my TV and sit on my couch.
---
Mobility is key in this day. I just see the tower PC as a hindrance at this point.
---
If I played more demanding games sure I'd want a powerful rig, but WoW and Civilization aren't that demanding, most PCs are overkill for most games these days anyway and unless you're a tech snob the average player doesn't need all that power anyways.
---
As a 31 year old with a toddler in the house having a Laptop I can put up and out of reach is better than a PC for me.
---
What are you even talking about? I'm commenting specifically on the networking, not the game as a whole.
---
This is not a complicated discussion. And it's easy to see for yourself even without access to beta or private servers.
---
[Asmongold](https://twitter.com/asmongold/status/1085305069204058112?lang=en) was saying the same thing back in January. 
---
[Here](https://youtu.be/rAlTrPySgtQ) is an example of the networking standstill that occurs when you have 40+ people together in modern WoW.
---
Classic beta does seem better, but it's not by any means perfect, and who knows how that will correspond to actual launch servers. [Here](https://youtu.be/Go5v_Bfgcus) you can see the same type of lag on the stress test.
---
[Here's](https://youtu.be/iEg9-usCL0M) the Valley of Trials during a private server launch, and [here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYFD06UFscw&amp;t=57s) some largescale PvP on Nostalrius. As you can see, it's a much smoother experience.
---
To be clear, I'm not trying to shit talk Blizzard or Classic WoW. Obviously I'm going to play Classic and that's why I'm here. But I think it's counterproductive to suggest that Blizzard can never make a mistake, or to ignore problems with the game that we should hope get ironed out before release.
---
Am going hunter 100%, smooth leveling, not a lot competition for loot, epic bow quest, needed in all tiers of raiding, beast in pvp and beast in gold making. Easy decision and I played one for a good amount in classic absolutely loved it. I am concerned with the 20 warrior raids but I think thats private server environment because looting is gona be a nightmare and its mostly speed runs, but am still worried and I think this wasn't part of the classic experience as it was not well known across the game how good fury dps was or what are keybinds for that matter LUL
---
No, what I'm saying is that you should raid, and then PvP when you are not raiding.
---
Youll have better gear and won't have the stress of trying to climb the honor ladder. Seems like a win-win for me.
---
If you are already on the fence, go dwarf.
---
Dwarf is something you might regret initially. Night elf is something you might regret *down the line* after you already poured hundreds of hours into the game.
---
In the first case you can just re-roll if you don’t warm up to it.
---
(I am trying to remain as neutral as possible being someone that would argue going night elf priest is idiotic from multiple angles)
---
Remote desktop protocol. I've done similar with chrome desktop for fishing on my Android phone.

Warlock.

Stand in one spot and press 4 buttons

But you haft to have a active WoW account, and I’m not giving them 15$ to pay for three hours.

Bears are great for raids. Just not as the main tank. And even then there are plenty of fights they could main tank.
---
Have you ever considered multi-boxing ? :D

Nice!  It sounded like you guys.  I was the rogue Pheq.  I remember stabsfast/angrymonkey.  We dueled a few times and even ran into each other in legion or something a while back.  I forget exactly where but I believe it was in a bg or something.  Always cool to see some old agamaggan people :)

https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-weapon-skills#hit-cap-clarification-blue-post
---
* "This means that the so-called “hit cap” is in effect 9% rather than 8% for a player with 300 Weapon Skill fighting a level 63 monster with a Defense Skill of 315."  
---
* "With a Weapon Skill of 305, such as from Sword Specialization (Humans) or Axe Specialization (Orcs), this hit modifier is no longer in place against +3 level monsters"  
---
After reading that my understanding would be that the 305 weaponskill basically negates the 1% we never knew about, making it 8% instead of 9%?
---
This makes me want to get a parrot and teach it to say "For the Alliance!"
---
20 Hours a week is not hardcore.
---
Id say if you manage to get in more than 6 hours a day then you can start calling yourself "passionate". If you put in more than 9 hours a day, thats when you turn towards hardcore.
---
I cried when I saw that tabard. So beautiful!
---
TBC makes the game so much better for hybrids.
---
The biggest change that you will probably notice if you play warrior is taunts range. It is not he 40 yard range that you are used to in Legion/BFA. It is a 5 yard range so it will be a lot of getting used to on how and when to use it properly.
---
And the point was, if you want to purely pvp, 60 is a shit bracket, because the gear you can get from just pvp is not only worse than raiding gear, but also vastly more time consuming to get.
---
Hence why the entire discussion topic is about twinking, which allows a much better pvp time balance.
---
Niece
---
But WW axe isn’t BIS in its bracket? Unless you meant the 30 cap in beta then I get you
---
CTS in mainhand? and naxx wpn in offhand?
---
Yup, exactly what I'm doing.  I will literally be a fishing god due to the downtime at work.  With click to move \*theoretically\* I can farm herbs or mine or whatnot but I haven't tried it yet.  Obviously I'd be a sitting duck for pvp but worth it.
---
lmao so funny you brought up Westfall. To this day it's zone music runs through my head when I play. WAY to much time in that zone from the leveling and wPvP of rogues harassing SH and Moonbrook.
---
Ah yeah I remember now!  Sorry it's been such a long time since doing any kind of AV quest lol
---
Various seals  with varying effects, Judgement with varying effects to go along with said seals, HoJ, repentance, LoH, consecration, HoW, and much more. Paladins aren’t a one trick pony. Also, don’t forget the different auras.
---
&gt;Can you transfer select toons to the classic servers
---
I think people are just in a nostalgic mood and/or some very old-school players who quite years ago are planning on returning for Classic and are restoring old accounts.
---
I don't mind the look and the new textures.
---
But the walk animation are horrendous.
---
-Dual spec
---
-Mount / pet tab
---
-Transmog
---
-Classes actually pressing more than 2-3 buttons in raids
---
-Healing being a lot better and more fun
---
but outside of that it's garbage
---
If that's really the case then it's sad af.
---
They are. And it's PvP. As in Player vs Player.
---
Also, you can't really get corpse camped for that long. I always managed to run from my killers after 3 or 4 more deaths. It's part of the game if you choose a PvP server.
---
**What makes you most envious of other claseses?**
---
The fact that I can't buff anyone...I feel like I can't help random passerbyers as a warrior.
---
**What stops you from maining a class?**
---
If the tier sets from raids (1/2/3) aren't viable as bis for my class. While I love transmog not being a thing, I'd like my character to look cool in the bis raid scene.
---
Bur.
---
I'm going to be a blacksmith Holy paladin.  Maybe it's not S tier, but with a little patience, crafted armor will consistently be a bit better than quested gear and significantly better than dropped gear.  Also, unlike engineering, you can mine and smith while you level and don't need alts or a guild feeding you materials. 
---
Plus it's fun!
---
The thing that sucks with this the most IMO is that you don't necessarily want phase 1 to be short. Having it be less than a month would be absurd and catered basically only to speed levelers and people doing the content ASAP.
---
I really enjoy the pre-raid meta of the game, so personally I'd love to see phase 1 last 2-3 months. Aside from my own preference it gives people a LOT of time to hit 60 with a healthy life balance. It also lengthens the life span of vanilla's content and creates hype for the next wave of stuff to get released. 
---
Thats all bogged down though because now we have layering/sharding extended out to the full length of phase 1. That means the number of people you see in the world towards the end game will be capped and all the weird awkwardness of sharding will be around for one of the most exciting phases of the game.
---
But when you twink you also need to spam dungeons for the BiS BoP items.

Trim your nails you animal no guild will have and you will be blacklisted

---
That's not really the same thing. Rested experience is not an incentive to log out *over staying online*, it's a way to incentivize players coming back when they take breaks. 
---
If you are optimizing your /played time, then sure, it's optimal to log out and always have rested experience, but you won't level faster in real time than someone who just keeps playing. No one who wants to keep playing the game is making a conscious decision to log out and then *intentionally wait for a period of time to get rested experience* before logging back in. 
---
Hypothetical player: "Man, I'd love to level my mage right now but I can't because I ran out of rested experience."
---
Compare that to this situation, where the optimal route is collecting world buffs, then logging out and playing another character until the next time you can get a world buff on your main or attend a raid.
---
Hypothetical player: "Man, I'd love to do a BG on my mage right now but I can't because I already have the Ony buff and we're doing BWL tomorrow."
---
In the best case, that player just plays an alt instead of the character he *wants* to play. In the worst case, that player just logs out and doesn't participate in the community until time to raid.
---
I typically spend more time alive then dead. So I would like to maximize enjoyment of what I spend most of my time doing. ;)
---
Was it nice, yes. But 1 spec, super expensive respecs if you did them regularly is 100% part of the Classic experience.
---
Yep, completely. I can still also think those players are dicks though.
---
I like the visuals and the graphics of retail. Been playing on private server for a time now and yesterday I started up retail just to change up the leveling a bit and holy hell the game feels smooth
---
Why so?
---
They’re both old school MMOs from the same period who rebooted classic server. It’s pretty specific lol
---
Nah he's right, to reach hit cap you need 9% with 300 ws, because the first 1% hit is ignored by bosses. Without hit, 300 have an 8% chance to miss and 305 have a 6%, hence the confusion.
---
can’t have king in your name
---
From what Im reading, forcing the opposing faction to do anything other than what they were planning on doing is a win, correct?
---
But once you've got the items, you're done. There's no new BiS released at that bracket and you can then spend all your time PvPing.
---
Is it possible to merge accounts? I picked up WoW again about a year ago and just made a new account because I didn’t know about restoring old ones...is it possible to restore my old vanilla one and merge with the new one I’ve been playing on? Was a high end raider and would love to reminisce with my old gear/inventory
---
Any copyrighted name is against the TOS and reportable.
---
In classic it’s simple warrior is the optimal tank spec. Now depending on if you are hardcore or casual you have to keep in mind being a tank is a very large time investment. Required farming mats for pre raid consumables will take time. Gearing will take time. Helping gear others and get attunent will take time. Be ready to sink a lot of your time into classic... if you want to tank and be good at it
---
Not difficult unless you eat a lot of animal products.
---
Only faction that matters obviously. So, yeah!
---
I hope not, but probably. If there's no mobs to kill then it's going to be dumb. If I have to skip quests and grind, fine, but if we can't even grind it's going to just be really stupid.
---
That's not how it works but you are correct in that it's quite significant
---
The wep skill increases your hit/crit etc by 0.04% per point which is decent but it's important is reducing the glancing blow penalty on lvl 63+ (raid bosses).
---
Welcome to the real world where poverty exists.
---
When it comes to Classic the only class envy I have is of Paladins T2 set.
---
Other than that I just want to play a Warrior.
---
If Paladins could Tank in Classic I'd play a Paladin to raid.
---
Less downtime is equally as important as faster kill time. If you can shave off more downtime with 1h/shield than you can kill time with a 2h then it is a net positive.
---
As a paladin I would have buffed them. 
---
I'm not now, solely because of this post.
---
The PCs of yesteryear could do it, the Switch is more powerful than that...
---
for money making, skinning / mining is best combo, for pvp engineering / mining, for overall usefulness herb / alch (tailoring and blacksmithing req pretty much grind in the end to be useful imo)
---
You're playing classic, you'll spend plenty of time dead regardless of faction haha
---
Make this a thing and people will surely be interested. You might even get lucky and the horde will create their own counter gank squad. Hell I hadn't planned on playing nelf, but I would definitely consider it for a 29 twink alt.
---
Because you have to farm 1-2 mobs for every PvP kill vs decent players, which is super boring. For PvE players shard farming isn't a problem.
---
I meant mutually exclusive in the fact you can have two separate groups that enjoy the same thing. You can have the chewing swallowers or the sucker swallowers, they both enjoy the same thing. That’s all.
---
could be 10,000 years. Again, no one knows.
---
&gt;sure, it's optimal to log out and always have rested experience, but you won't level faster in real time than someone who just keeps playing
---
Be that as it may, you have conceded that rested exp DOES incent logging out. As a result your argument that stacking world buffs is an exploit because "No video game developer would ever intentionally design a system that incentivizes logging out over playing the game" doesn't hold any water.
---
I am up for hearing another argument or piece of evidence if you have any more.
---
What are you going to do, bandage them to death?
---
And Hearthstone.

Don't have an idea on # of raid nights yet.  Working on getting a solid 60 person roster first and going from there.  
---
Realistically, given our member makeup, we probably wouldn't be raiding until October.... and given that's about 4 months away a lot can change in people's schedules so I didn't think it was prudent to have set raid nights right out the gate.
---
9 - 1 = 8  
---
    
---
Not 6.  
---
???
---
so... we don't have that long to play..  :(
---
Nice idea. I guess I could look into it if there is a followup database.
---
Nelf hunter is best hunter for the surprise aim shot combos especially when you keep a combat pet that can stealth
---
He dispelled so fast that you didn't even know his warrior was sheeped.
---
Caverns of Time is not a zone in Kalimdor code wize I think. Thats why there is phasing. Should be fine when crossing other zones i think. ( I hope )
---
Transmog is not beneficial to the game, especially in PvP servers. You can’t tell the gear the enemy has equipped. So that probably more of a PvE server thing, even so, it’s nice to be able to identify people by the gear they have on. But most people stick to old sets. I don’t even know if I’ve seen the newest weapon models form the newest BFA raid.

He does have a point, ive never experienced the tension of being perfect in any other game than in WoW.

Grouping for quests where you need quest items is not more effective.

Then you need to tell me your secret. Most things that contain “a lot of fiber” only have 2-3 grams. If you find something with 5-10g, that is a lot.

I struggle with it and I eat chia seeds, flax seeds and avocados every day.

You might make it without a tank, but not without a healer.

    [H] Cerberus - Hardcore PvE Guild - PvP Server - US East (All welcome who can make raid times)    
---
While wanting to relive past    heroism's at a competitive level, the goal of the guild is to progress at a pace that suits the core of the guild. With only two days in our raid week, the core of the guild will be held to high expectations to maximize the time we spend in raid. These two raid nights will have minimal downtime and minimal tolerance for repeated poor performance and coming to raid unprepared. Ideally, we seek to recruit the top 1% of skilled players who no longer wish to commit to a 4+ night per week raiding schedule.
---
Off nights are to be    spent farming consumes, gold, pre-raid BiS, 20 man’s, and, of course, doing other things you love/need to do. The last thing we want is to burn out our core and, with a more intense raiding schedule, farming  consumes, gold, and pre-raid BiS can be very volatile to the turn over rate of players.
---
Maturity and respect is very important. Drama of any kind will not tolerated.
---
Leaders  of Cerberus have countless hours, accumulating to years, of  leadership   experience throughout retail WoW and other games and MMO's.
---
**Raid nights will be:**
---
    Tuesday and Wednesday evenings at 8:00PM - 11:00PM (EST)      
---

yes you can merge per say. Basically you add the accounts under your [battle.net](https://battle.net) but they are separate so each needs a paid sub. will likely require a call to blizz and some info like drivers license this and that.
---
Well, holy nova priest farms are a thing!
---
It's Miyagi, not meogi.
---
People do it constantly, along with a lot of people seemingly thinking private servers were all funservers with gear vendors.
---
Even a bunch of people who know that to be untrue, people act like any experience on a private server is invalid.
---
Sure, they weren't 100% accurate, a few mechanics especially, but the overall experience wasn't so far off it wasn't at all comparable...
---
I don’t know what you are talking about as my numbers are correct.
---
At 300 skill you miss 8% and have a hit cap of 9% (your first hit is ignored).
---
At 305 skill you miss 6% and have a hit cap of 6%.
---
Stop talking out of your fucking ass. Jesus Christ. What is it with you people here?!
---
paid if you plan on playing beyond level 20 that is.
---
Mine was some Nightelf boy at the battle of Stormwind.
---
My mount took an arrow, so I was on foot sloggin' through the mud. He came running at me, this dumb, huntard lad. Thinking he could end the battleground with a single swing of his sword. I knocked him down with the Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker, gods I was strong then. Caved in his chainmail, probably shattered every rib he had.
---
Stood over him, Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker, in the air, right before I brought it down he emoted "Wait! Wait!"
---
They never tell you how they shit themselves, they don't put that part in their patch notes.
---
Gummys legs?
---
AV had black lotus in vanilla.
---
Twinks were always a minority in BG's.  when you separate queues  the queue times for twink players rose exponentially.  you go from queueing against your entire battlegroup,  to 20% or less of the players in your battlegroup.
---
the battleground queues were also bugged during the seperation which also caused queue times to be longer.
---
queue times for every twink battlegroup went from 1-2 minute queues, up to 1 hour or more.  nobody wants to spend 1 hour in a queue to play a game.  
---
so what happens?  people are waiting in queue for an hour to get 1 game.  then they queue again and have to wait 1 hour again.  people lose interest while waiting, thus they log off and go back on their mains.  Then it's just a snowball effect resulting in queue times being 5+ hours a week after the change,  then never popping a week later.
---
And this was just in the 19 bracket which had by far the most twinks.  higher brackets like 39's and 49's were killed instantly because of queue seperation and bugged queues.
---
Play what you want, play what makes you smile. End of discussion
---
I see, thanks for the info 👍

---
Coming from the guy who brigades against anyone he feels like accusing of stream sniping.  Fuck Summit.
---
His head is so big I can’t pay attention to what he says.
---
Shadowpanther already has stat weighted lists of every time and their value so you're better off using that to check for other items.
---
True, but in PvP where mages are masters of resetting fights and are mainly limited by their Mana pool (and thus, damage per Mana is king), a warlock is far more reliant on their health pool for both generating mana and being able to take a hit.  Early on, mages get a lot of intellect and spirit gear while warlocks get intellect and stamina.  However, those dungeon sets are only really useful for farming, since there's no spell power and spirit is pretty useless for anything else to mages.
---
Moving up the tiers of gear, mages still get spirit while warlocks get more and more stamina.  I don't know why this is, because pretty much the only things that benefit from spirit are evocation and mage armor.  It's classic broken itemization.  If you look at rewards for PvP, it's intellect and stamina for mages and warlocks. Mages get a bit more intellect and warlocks get more stamina, but they both get spell power.  However, the warlock honor set itemization mirrors PvE rewards.
---
I know the meta has changed, and everyone knows the BiS lists for more spell power.  If gamers are more competitive today, that extra burst will be important for PvP as well.  However, it doesn't change the fact that mages still get spirit.  What warlocks miss the most until AQ40 is hit and threat reduction.  Basically, most shortcomings of warlock gear have to do with PvE.  In PvP, warlocks will be much better itemized for PvP than mages even without any PvP honor gear.
---
True, but if you do, you won't really have access to the same content as if you were try harding.
---
I'm not switching it up.  Gonna be a mage again. Been my main since day one.
---
Even if there will be new and better MMORPGs. I'll stick to WoW cus Im an warcraft fan. I never tried new mmo's while wow went downhill.
---
Same...really wanna go Mage but I feel I should start as a Shammy again
---
No 99% is not getting there.

**\[GER\] &lt;Vanguard&gt; PvE Progression Guild**
---
We’re forming a strong, german-speaking community on a german PvP Realm with focus on endgame PvE. Our aim is to make ourselves known throughout the server community and participate in World Boss contention as well as World PvP and battlegrounds. Last but not least, we’d like to see our communities thrive through guild- and server-wide events.
---
**Our Values**
---
· *Respect*
---
· *Reliablity*
---
· *Team Spirit*
---
**Raiding hours**
---
· *Wed, 7-10 p.m.*
---
· *Thu, 7-10 p.m.*
---
· *Sun, 7-10 p.m.*
---
We’re looking for attendance above 90% in our core raiders. Else you might find your own priority for loot lowered in comparison. Emergencies and holidays obviously do not count towards absence but shall be communicated so beforehand.
---
We expect certain weeks with less than 3 days of planned content to clear. In that case, raiders in general may have those affected evenings off. Possible events put in place instead of a Raid will not be mandatory unless announced otherwise in advance.
---
**Recruitment**
---
We’re still looking for a fair number of like-minded players amongst all classes with the ambition to clear all relevant PvE content in a community-focused guild that still takes raiding seriously. Even if you’re not yet certain on raiding up to 3 days a week or would like to pursue other content in the game, if you’re sharing our values, we need you on the front lines with us.
---
**Why Vanguard**
---
1. No fantasies or illusions: we have goals and battle plans on how to achieve them
---
2. Core with 15 years of WoW experience as guild- or raid leaders from Vanilla up to Mythic Cutting Edge achievements in current expansions
---
3. Transparent guild management for all things concerned, especially loot, guild bank, and our general set of rules
---
4. We are dedicated and focused on the MMO-community aspect of WoW Classic
---
**Peaked your interest?**
---
We’re looking forward to hearing from you!

pots, mana crystal, decurse

Hamborgur
---
Like a salvo of torpedoes from a fleet of submarines.
---
I love the huge race selection in modern WoW.
---
Why not all three?
---
Lol true, when he has to shit on a guy 1v1 csgo in chat beacuse he trash talked summit and said he was bad.
---
"this kid is garbage"
---
Nah. Same thing happened with Overwatch and people were complaining. The launch for that game was a huge success and I expect they have the stats to show for it.
---
Hype will go back up again especially if they do an open beta type thing near the end or some sort of event.
---
Launch will be massive and it's not too long to wait.
---
If you want consistency though you could just use flametongue on your 2h as it scales with weapon speed
---
The assumption is 3pm PST time - can this be confirmed?
---
I am a bully because I used the resources available to everyone who plays the game to make a stronger character.
---
also I was never "victimized"  by a twinker.  I don't see myself as a victim, i'm not a liberal.
---
It's not clever if all you do is specifically search out comments to reply to. 
---
In fact, it's lame.
---
&gt;The battles themselves aren't a problem. But they come with a lot of baggage:   
---
&gt; - Pet journal   
---
I'm not against collectibles being removed from the bags. Unless you have a better solution there is no way you gonna collect all those pets and still have bag space for other stuff
---
&gt; - Cross character pets   
---
I don't see this being an issue and it promotes alts. I do feel somethings should have a carryover to other characters but I acknowledge this doesn't fit the vanilla experience (where everything is character bound, even friendlists). Still, I wouldn't lose a nights sleep over it, I'm not a purist.
---
&gt; - Pets are designed around "balance"     
---
Please elaborate
---
&gt; - Pet dailies reward non-pet rewards (like silver, XP, et)   
---
Again, not an issue if the rewards aren't that relevant. If the rewards stay within the "pet battle world" like awarding fun items related to pet battles and a tiny amounts of gold or xp it won't kill the game. I really don't know if that's the case since I've stopped playing after MoP.
---
&gt;At least a theoretical card game could be built without impacting the over-world (aside from trade/AH). I cannot imagine implementing pet battles without for example a pet journal, nobody can carry around dozens of pets.
---
I really don't see this being a problem. Maybe they could change it so it fits the theme of vanilla a little better. Maybe you could change your carry pets at the stable master, maybe you needed to do some maintenance around your pets, hypothetical speaking. Still, I don't think it affects the game that much and its a fun mini game to do while you are bored. Plus, it promotes world exploration
---
Oh shit now I feel bad. Enchanting/herbalism isn't that good a combo tbh, I was kinda messing with you. I did have herb/alch on my paladin and I liked being able to make my own pots for raids so maybe you'd like that too? Otherwise I'd say mining/engineering to have some more dps output while levelling as a paladin. Might make it a bit easier.
---
For a priest, the best combo is dwarf priest but honestly, if you prefer human it's all the same, do what you enjoy. I'm going dwarf priest in classic cause I wanna try vanilla raids and be a try hard this time around. I'm going enchanting/tailoring for easier bags and disenchanting all the greens you get along the road. Mining, skinning, or herbalism/ tailoring isn't too bad either if you're not too good at getting gold.
---
In all honesty, I'd say go with that you think you'll enjoy most. Levelling takes a while so you might as well make the most fun of it.
---
Great thing to do is find professions you think you might need most and find a friend who matches that. If you go mining/skinning, find a friend who has mining/bs or engineering. You can sell him mats and he'll have an easier time as well. If you're EU lemme know and maybe we'll end up on the same server so I can hook you up
---
Sharing constructive feedback is never bad, but constructive feedback alone would have never given us Classic. Actually, people tried that for years but it was only when people started freaking out that Blizzard actually listened. 
---
It doesn't matter if you just say "FUCK LAYERING" or spend a thousand words explaining why layering is bad if you're not bringing up anything that hasn't already been said hundreds of times. Sure you need those words to be said many times before Blizzard can understand exactly what you mean with "FUCK LAYERING" but after that, only loudness matters.
---
So I can probably get away with an $800 Asus laptop ?
---
Cool
---
Raids are already out in phase 1, giving phase actually rewards casual players because they don't have to regear in diremaul
---
Main problem for me with consoles is that you can't speak with people. It's not mandatory sure, but the whole point of Classic for me is the social part. I'd rather play retail on the Switch to do WQs / gathering/ leveling alts.
---
It's so hard to choose, but I think I'm settling on RP or PVE unless the perfect ally guild for pvp comes along and sweeps me off my feet. :P I just don't have the time/energy I used to and would like to farm for mats in peace.
---
Because their patch/update system is completely different.
---
Honestly would love WoW classic to be on consoles with KB/M enabled, it would mean I'm not alone playing in my friend group.
---
Just PVP and get the Black War Tiger.
---
Apparently it was removed. So it may not be a thing in 1.12 AV
---
I would totally play WoW on my Switch.  Diablo III is great on it.
---
Have fun porting others while I port myself. You can level fast but I can aoe. You can farm gold but I do it faster. Hey look! An extra bag to fill with vendor stuff.
---
Dude mage is the shit and you know it. Every class sounds better than hunter thats not even a conpairison.
---
Magepower!
---
Tempting me to switch my main
---
&gt;WoW Classic will be free for all **subscribers**
---
Not true but ok
---
Next step: name! :P
---
Ehh That's not necessarily true imo
---
It's not the same as private server sit to crit. It does (or did if fixed) work on beta.
---
Oh, you can easily be hated within your faction. A friend of mine had something similar. He claimed to be (insert any profession) when somebody asked for some crafted gear or enchants and such. He'd accept the mats in trade window and walked away to sell them on AH.
---
I feel like this may be the case, but any common Shaman players please correct if I'm wrong: First time you take the spec, you learn the weapon skills with it. Say you get your weapon skill to 100 and respec out of the 2h talent. I believe you still have the weapon skill of 100, but will no longer be able to equip said weapons. Still have the skill, don't have the ability to wield it. Does that sound right to anyone? Could totally be mistaken.
---
Blackrock and surroundings, SS vs TM or ST. Hell yeah!
---
I personally enjoy the new animations and models. this is why im fine with them letting people opt into updated models
---
so you and your nice spamming friends will be the classic playerbase?   no way im gonna pay 10/month to play with such smart people  
---
seems like the thundefury spamming evolved
---
I thought the 5 weapon skill only negated the 1% penalty from the weapon/defense skill difference being above 10, not 2% additional hit?  
---
If that 5 weapon skill negates an additional 2% via regular hit formula then holy shit that's insane and I apologize u/BBThyr
---
1. Could be layering not phasing (Shifts aren’t as clean cut as blizzard wants them to be).
---
2. Even though RP realms aren’t supposed to have sharding it still gets turned on in RP realms sometimes.
---
3. People from alpha test realm have been spotted on the beta test realm (CRZ)
---
4. It’s still a new tech and in beta, so all the bugs/kinks may not be worked out.
---
5. It’s a very reasonable possibility that blizzard won’t be able to turn it off, and it will be in the game to stay. I know if I see it or see evidence of it in phase 2 (their given cut off date at latest) I will unsub.
---
Oh god oh fuck...
---
lol, this doesn't change that you will kill them very slow.
---
Exactly what I came here to say.  Is the Switch a touchscreen?
---
&gt;**to level a character?** 
---
i think everybody
---
There are rumors that it is a few of the guys from &lt;The Boys Are Back&gt;  from Felmyst.  
---
Other rumors are Gummy is actually one of them!  
---
Doubtful but if you like conspiracy theory's and you're still part of Gummy's discord you should check it out.
---
&gt;	Like 1 second of not having Windfury totem down and they whisper you and moan.
---
Any warrior that does not have 2-3 macros to do that on a press of a button does it wrong.
---
My dad, he will level my alts on my 2nd account. :)
---
I won’t quit forever, but I will immediately make a new character. End game isn’t fun to me.
---
Why not enjoy what 60 has to offer too?
---
I'm looking forward to the simplicity that was the beginning days.  I stopped playing at Legion, wasn't excited anymore about WOW.  Now I'm ecstatic since I heard about classic.
---
I quit in BC and just recently began playing retail again. I don't know what it was like at the time, but I can say Northrend is so much better designed than Outlands. Outlands just felt stuck together. Northrend feels like a place.
---
So true same
---
I think that’s kinda like older people saying, “why do so many people wants phone they can walk around with? What’s wrong with leaving a phone attached to a cord?”
---
Mobility is convenient.
---
On what server?
---
I guess so, for me it's because I joined during tbc and was quite young at the time. I really cant wait to enjoy leveling again. I will hit 60 and if I can make it to doing raids I will. It's more of a see how it goes kinda thing
---
And infinite gold seller spammers
---
Thankfully I don't get home from work until after the first three hours.
---
&gt; Help the game as in get new players on new platforms, increasing popularity and income as a whole.
---
This doesn't help the game at all, it helps shareholders. 
---
The game has steadily derailed for 8 years or whatever, how about making it good on the proper platform instead?
---
family trips will be amazing
---
You can group up with players from another layer tho
---
I agree, it's the one factor keeping me from rolling priest where you are forced to go Shadow and still need to heal on dungeons. Unless you are a masochist there is no way you are rolling a holy or a *chuckles* disc priest while leveling
---
Hey this is spot on. I have a similar situation. I have a husky puppy and I KNOW he will find a way to hit into the tower off the desk or dig into it during one of my long work days. That’s why I’m getting an L shaped desk, a keyboard n mouse and a monitor with the laptop all so I can put away the keyboard mouse and laptop with ease when I go to work. And then just plug in again when I get home haha. 
---
Also, getting that desk so I can still watch tv while in the living room. Ez pz
---
Yeah I feel like Blizzard needs to tone it down with the beta and stress test stuff. Classic will be out soon and people have already seen a lot of stuff already. I really wish Omar or whoever wouldn’t have spawned all of those world bosses in the starter zones a few weeks back. Those are things that you should have to dedicate yourself to in the game in order to see those types of things. Whether you can look up these bosses and watch videos or not. You shouldn’t just be able to fight these guys in game at level 5 or whatever. I think they are doing too much and really need to slow down. Classic will be here really soon.
---
I was actually thinking I'd just offer them 1000g for it and take the hit.
---
I realize now my comment came off more aggressive than I meant.
---
Joana himself (presume it's a he) holds the record at 4d 20h though no? And they've done it a thousand times with the fastest class (hunter). How can anyone knock almost 20% off that time
---
&gt;Balance classes without taking their identify.
---
So basically just copy TBC classes, as those were the most unique and diverse classes / specs that existed in any version of WoW. 
---
Class homogenization started in WotLK, and ramped up in later expansion.
---
I’m not sure google is the best metric because once someone googled classic WoW and finds resources for news that they like they will no longer need to google it
---
Fuck tantrums.
---
Isn't that literally account sharing?
---
Also the only reason I’m getting a monitor for the laptop is so I don’t blow my neck out. Also the mobility of a laptop around the house helps with not being cemented to one location.
---
I hope you are right. Unfortunately I could see them moving servers forward to TBC and repeating the same mistakes from the past.
---
do you have a source for this? not doubting you but most pservers have it so you CAN sheep tagged mobs.
---
100%
---
That 1 Asus you put up for like $900 will do at max settings and let you alt tab a movie or something.
---
I like Laptops because I can put a movie on the laptop and plug in am HDMI and play the game on my TV while the movie plays on my laptop.
---
Well the only other choice is playing with Asian players who don't speak English :\
---
"You can get in any raid with any spec" - Summit.  
---
Hi guys, Arms warrior here looking for raiding guild. Anyone want me? No? Okay, I wonder why.
---
I thought that's yes?
---
I had one report of this yesterday that ended up being related to the person's clock on their computer being out of sync. Something related to authentication thinks it's expired in this case and can throw these errors. Do you have "Set time automatically" turned on? I'm looking at ways to handle this on my side, but that's an easy fix for the moment if that is the case for you.
---
If you plan on tanking the 1% extra dodge racial is the best one too for night elf warriors.
---
no, August 27th is gonna be YUGE
---
Good look AoE farming on launch. You'll have competition from other players and other wannabe AoE farmers. We don't need to AoE farm because we can multi pull while questing anyway :)
---
I'm glad we're able to agree our mutual disgust for hunters, may we freeze/curse them for eternity.
---
I have respect for mages as I too was once a mage before I discovered the power of harnessing demonic energies.
---
&gt;+ A free mount at 40 and reduced cost mount at 60 (which involves a cool quest chain)
---
Ehich looks cool but is trash because it costs mana, so eventually you probably want a regular mount
---
Oh god
---
Imma hit  them, so much don't you worry your pretty little heart BB.
---
You sure can bud...
---
Nope, you absolutely do.
---
Come in with a positive attitude, genuine engagement with the game, and make friends in your guild and they’ll invite you along.
---
If a guild doesn’t want you in their raid team - then they can go get the try-hard pug rouge who brings no preparation and  ninja loots all the items he wants.
---
Sure, you may not be #1 priority to be geared - but that is WoW.
---
Eventually you’ll get your reward - your guild will ensure it.
---
There is no source saying “We are doing it” but there is a J Allen Brack interview I read around the time of beta release that hinted at it strongly.
---
I bought a 32" LED TV as my monitor for like $99 at Walmart. 
---
Plays great, but when I'm feeling frisky I'll bring it upstairs and sit on the couch with a wireless keyboard and mouse and hook it up to my 50" Plasma
---
Warrior mixamatosis when?
---
There will be no changes as far as we are currently aware. 
---
And hunters are fine. Still brought to naxx. Just lowest of the dps classes. But someone has to be
---
Source: the incredible series known as “World of Roguecraft”
---
Drustvar has some beautiful music as well.
---
I was just playing WoW, listening to it's great ambiance music and soaked in the atmosphere.
---
$15 for 48 hours.
---
Yeah, just reactivated and got on him last night, old man in new wow.
---
Thank you my man, I will try to do full 1h of each SM and RFD this week or on the beginning of July.
---
Whoa easy there dude, did someone not get their beta key?
---
Bigger competition as you can't kill them to make them stop.
---
I don't tend to approach it as such but them's the breaks.
---
Ya, wanting different things is fine, absolutely nothing wrong with wanting different things. The problem is posts like this one, or the one with the same message that was posted yesterday, and the day before, and the day before, and their equivalent in the other direction saying "The thing I want is so much better than the thing you want, and the thing you want is going to get destroyed."
---
I’m planning on enchanting and something as a pally and tailoring and something on a lock alt the two secondary professional will be gathering probably
---
They kind of plummeted the warlock stocks though. Being able to summon is one of the reasons you'd invite the lock over other dps.
---
Yep! CTS main, Iblis off!
---
Open beta two weeks before launch doesn’t allow much time to fix anything.
---
This is what I'm doing even though I'm mainly doing PVP. Gnomes area yikes for me, and dwarfs dont have the "rogue" feel to me. Love Undead, but dont enjoy the rest of the horde leveling/cities/story/etc.
---
Just keep up with cooking, fishing, herb, and alch and Warrior is fine.  Having the well fed hp and constant potions is the difference between surviving solo questing and not.  Drop for eng at level cap if you must.
---
Mmmm Idk, I can see charging 1g per summon for raids if you set it up with people. I'd gladly pay 1g to not have to run to a raid if it was a choice. But if I'm running late because of work or something or because I keep getting ganked, then it starts to be a bit too much to ask for money. I think it's like a mage port, porting people out of a raid or dungeon is just kinda part of your utility, but porting people in IF to save time for money.... It's a service.
---
There will definitely be guilds that doesn't care about what spec you are.
---
Eventually yes, but it's a huge advantage early on.
---
reported, account sharing! I kid, i joke.
---
"recently bandaged" is a buff? :D
---
What is this?
---
What makes you think it wouldn't be even longer? 
---
Because, again we don't know, all speculation has equal value, so anything from 1 month - lets say even 84,000 years are all viable guesses. Remember nobody knows afterall. 
---
So if we value each month with equal odds, given 84,000 years, each month is about a 1 in a million chance of dropping Dire Maul after release. I stopped at 84,000 because I wanted to be realistic, but who knows that could be totally off base, we just don't know. 
---
If we just play the game and wait long enough we might win the lottery and get DM before we grow old and die, but with these odds our great great grandchildren are more likely to die without ever seeing Dire Maul than us seeing it within the first 8 months.
---
To counter these arguments:
---
- Warlock pets are limited in their utility and usefulness. I heard from beta players Voidwalkernis especially disappointing in its threat and can’t hold aggro very well.
---
-  On the contrary, warlocks are very gear dependant. Especially later on.
---
- Maybe, but you wanna go gnome for that sweet 5% int bonus. Playing human lock is just stupid.
---
- The warlock and paladin mounts are inferior to regular mounts as they cost mana and count as spells, meaning they can be interrupted.
---
- Okay maybe but you still want some PvP gear regardless of the class you play.
---
- On the flipside of that coin, warlock dps is garbage in early raids and only a few are brought for their utility.
---
- Summoning is convenient but not a very fun job. Also I think there will be more Horde locks cuz WotF is OP.
---
- Yeah. I guess. Enjoy farming endless soul shards to provide these for every raid tho. Tanks eat healthstones like candy.
---
- I suppose. Other classes are better at it.
---
- Subjective. Their tier 1 set looks pretty goofy imo
---
This is really funny. But if the mods keep this on this sub but remove other posts much more related to classic, I would love a more in depth explanation on their rules.
---
he got boosted in 5s by bloodx for merc glad - played on his realm in tbc
---
A mediocre or unskilled rogue is entirely useless in a battleground. You can stun someone for a couple seconds in a fight before you get blown up
---
Chiodos, Box Car Racer, Yellowcard, Paramore, The All-American Rejects, Emery, Flyleaf? 
---
I've got a playlist all ready for classic
---
They are all easy if you read the abilities.
---
Warlock and shaman have the most to wrap your brain around.
---
But they are very easy to play once you understand their abilities and keybind them to muscle memory.
---
No, i don't concede that. Rested exp isnt incentive to log out, its incentive to log back in. If youre going to respond like a pompous ass, at least take the time to read what i said and respond appropriately.

The line from blizzard has been no, they wont be balancing classes or itemization. 
---
Don't forget - lots of class judgements have been based on data from private servers that have had some details wrong. 
---
heres the WF KT kill video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVampLmOVgA
---
Theres a hunter that that seems to do fine, and they were by no means clueless players.
---
This is the only real answer. Not only do shadow priests have the aspect of casting a minimum number of spells but, unlike mages, they don't actually, technically, need to kite most things due to shadowform being busted as hell.
---
See yourself out of here.

Fresh meat
---
Since when do you worry about mana when summoning a mount?
---
Freaking out brings attention to the issue, constructive feedback specifies what the issue is and why it's an issue. It's basically just the difference between up/downvoting and a post or comment since Blizzard won't actually care about the contents of something with no substance; only its existence.
---
switch you region in the launcher to US, buy wow subscription, you should be good to go

First one today!

780-830 on Patchwerk... not that bad for a class that does not scale
---
No way man. Healers have no chance to negate the damage done to DPS with heals, it just drops way too fast. And DPS usually have no abilities at all to protect themselves with besides CC. I've been playing a vanilla private server for about 2 weeks now and dungeons really are brutal. They are way harder than people remember or expect.
---
Yes you can. You are just wrong tho.
---
It's like complaining someone is hitting you while dizzy in a fighting game.
---
It's supposed to happen but some people like creating their own rules to for a videogame that was already balanced with its own rules in mind by the developer.
---
If you're horde, enhancement shaman has one of the easier game plans. Make sure you have windfury on your 2h. Macro frost shock and purge together. Spam you macro. If you're in Melee range hit stormstrike.
---
Congrats!!! Those look Awesome by the way! Big "Yikes" to all those commenters trying to legislate your wedding for you lol. Have an awesome event!
---
I feel like dual talents are what killed Hybrid specs.  In vanilla they didn't want people being a Tank in raids and a 2 hand MS machine in PVP at the drop of a hat.  
---
As a druid in vanilla it was why I loved 0/30/21, I was able to tank in AQ40 and heal just swapping gear, but that was because I was a hybrid class by design.
---
Hi guys, Fire Mage here looking for Molten Core Raid xD
---
Overpopulatedpower!
---
It ends after Naxx for vanilla as well.
---
How does affecting the tank not also affect the dps?
---
I'd say it's exactly the other way around: The more parry the better for the rogues!
---
Why? Because the tank generates less threat when he's parried all the time. Which means the raw DPS of the other classes becomes less important whereas reduced threat-generation becomes more important. 
---
Since Rogues generally generate less threat per damage than fury-warriors, they might end up the superior choice in many situations.

I got tickets to go to DragonCon this year. Traveling there on August 28th. I'll be about a week behind after the convention. Not the way I wanted to start Classic, but I also don't want to miss DragonCon.
---
Healthstones, soulstones, fear (in some situations). Plenty of reasons to still bring warlocks.
---
Hopefully people would use something like this as a way to casually grind, quest, and collect herbs and not as much for raiding or instancing or pvp.
---
 Light bless you.
---
I wasn't the one who brought up 3%, but if you want to be mad at me for whatever reason go right ahead.
---
yougins talkin about things again...
---
sidebar, so I assume folks posting here
---
I'm deadset on rolling an alliance shadow priest but can't for the life of me decide which race to roll. I want to roll night elf but with how hyped up dwarves are I can't help but think I should choose them. 
---
Did you feel especially held back on your meme priest in PvP? I feel like I'm just going to be destroyed by fears that I can't ward and such, + no stoneform.
---
"Playing human lock is just stupid." Could not agree more!
---
So, what exactly did you do?
---
&gt; Maybe, but you wanna go gnome for that sweet 5% int bonus. Playing human lock is just stupid.
---
5% *base* int bonus. Which works out at around 2 extra DPS for Mages.. I'd rather not be tiny and enjoy that sweet rep gain and perception.
---
I had mixed feelings about this as well.  Not playing 24/7 that first week puts you behind the curve.
---
But not really.  People are going to be all over the board.  The top 1% might hit 60 that first week, but the rest of the player base is going to be all over.  
---
Don't feel that low level zones will be deserted if you miss launch day/week.  People will be in low level zones for the next couple years.
---
So you're in the "It's not pedophilia when she's a 200 year old vampire" camp?
---
I guess I'm not used to it yet lol I'll get there!
---
Omg this website is so fantastic!!
---
You overthink a lot
---
That's easy. Shaman. The real problem is elemental, enhancement or resto? 
---
Do I want to be pvp god elemental blasting people to orbit with lightning overload procs? 
---
Or perhaps just settle enhancement and hope for big windfury crits? 
---
Maybe I'll just do pve and go resto?
---
The music in Stormheim is just stunning
---
protip; run a pihole on a VM rather than a pi. pi's are notoriously unstable.
---
The main difference is that if you and your friends choose to play on server X, you don't have to worry about layers - you will ALWAYS be able to see one another.
---
It definitely helps the game to have an active population. And I don't think anyone is making the argument that it should be put on other platforms at the expense of PC, it's in addition to PC.
---
Jokes on you I wasted my money on eye of the beast so I'm gonna force your ass to tank
---
That sounds depressing.  
---
It also sounds like its your plan now, and then youll go "Ill just do one dungeon at 60, and a BG with this guy I met at 44, and....." :)
---
ad nauseum is superior
---
Lock is my 3th choise  next to Mage and Elemental shaman. But I love serieus raiding so ele was off the table for me.
---
Lock is fine.
---
The true classic experience.
---
What race for hunter? For alliance there is no real visually pleasing choice. For Night Elf, the male model is quite ugly and the female night elf is very cliche and gamer grill, then the alternative is Dwarf which is equally derpy and 'unepic'. At least imo, you never feel 'badass' as a dwarf hunter, especially with classic graphics.
---
I imagine most people want it to play in bed haha
---
I also don't understand their rules. What kind of content are they hoping for if memes and highlight clips are being removed?
---
Imagine it like this: You have 8% chance to miss. With 300weapon skill and 8% hit, you'll still have 1% chance to miss because the "more than 10 difference between weapon and defense skill" basically negates 1% hitchance.
---
Looking only at this part, there is a 1% difference. However there still is the other, "old" (/longer known) mechanic of weapon skill giving a better chance to hit. There is some formula going around that is widely accepted, that states those 5 skill effectively give 2% hitchance.
---
So you need 9% hitchance to never miss with 300skill.
---
You need 8% hitchance to never miss with 305 skill and the 5 skill give you 2% hitchance, so you effectively only need 6% extra.
---
Probably, but I think even the most casual guild would think twice about getting an arms warrior in their raid roster.
---
trash rig just give it to me it's borderline useless
---
WoD and BfA harmed their income
---
I absolutely do too haha
---
I really kicks in with Tanks and healers.
---
When you go for a supportive roll, you are denied form partaking the rest of the game, unless you pay massive amounts
---
Graphics and the art styles. These never fail
---
Escape Artist is better than Perception, especially for locks who don’t have Blink
---
I managed to make a starter US account, so now I should only be needing to add a 1 month subscription right?
---
Is that enough ,since I wont have any addons.. to get  stress test access?
---
Wow Classic Lite... on Android...
---
Beats Diablo: whatever on phones, I guess.
---
I would drop all my other games to do a few quests before and after work
---
same, keep forgetting about that lol
---
Exactly... and I believe there’s a duel tourney planned for this week. Interesting to see the lvl 40 meta.
---
So true
---
Not sure the best way to reply to all of these, so throwing another reply here. To the folks saying they'd be okay with ads, I really appreciate the support. I'm going to give it all more thought, but I care a lot about the experience of using the site and it would hurt my soul to have it covered with ads. I may reach out and see what people think about a few options if I'm looking at anything aside from a simple donation.
---
I mained a hunter late vanilla through Wrath. Going to main a hunter agian just because I miss the playstyle. I was one of the rare ones who didn't like the changes post Cata.
---
Yes pls
---
\&gt;  But in all seriousness, I won't be around for the big push like I was wanting. So kill some alliance scum for me when it comes.   
---
he's taking it

Dude, it's a meme. Get over it. It's a good but overall obvious meme format, I very much doubt OP copied it.

It works so great in tandem with their selfhealing and shields. Pretty scary to fight a well geared spriest.

Dude, I added the parenthesis because it was appropriate considering the context of OP's post regarding WoW players. Therefore, I did not make Al politically correct.
---
Nostalrius is permitted by the admins
---
Yeah, I know, fuck logic
---
What can you do with shadowmeld besides eat+drink in it and maybe set an ambush?
---
Right! Some more consistency would be much appreciated.
---
I love mage, priest, and mage. 
---
Mage is my favorite, because of all the lore and fantasy around them. I just love the feel of the class. This ancient order that's based in this magical floating city. That, and all the control the class has is very appealing. But when you play any DPS, finding a group takes forever. How many times can you say "LF2M for gnomer need tank and heals" before giving up?
---
So I roll up a warrior. And I'm gonna level prot, dammit. Because if you're playing warrior and you're not tanking, what are you even DOING? But oops, unlike before when we could never find a tank for groups, now we can't find a healer. Fucking ret pallies as far as the eye can see.
---
Alright, priest time then! But man, leveling with wands sure is boring. Maybe it's time to go back to mage...
---
Ice
---
Happy cake day.
---
MC is available on day 1 yes. Some very hardcore guilds will clear it during the second raid lockout after the server launches and a couple are trying to do it in the first reset (ie kill Rag on day 7).
---
Yea I did it on the stress test and it did take some time.
---
The character statistics that came with the achievements page. I absolutely loved keeping track of my # of kills, # of deaths, gold earned from vendor trash, quests, auctions, etc.
---
This is what it is. Maximizing the important stuff and setting everything else to minimal values.
---
Facts bro. I’ll probably go with that one then haha. Then spend the rest of the budget on a decent monitor. Already got the Xbox one x set up on a 4 k by the desk so I can watch and play :)
---
Then I'm going with herb alch. Thanks that was very helpful. I dont think ill have a lot of time to grind between a full time job and studies. So I guess its going to be a priest + herb + alch. Now ima download the beta. Hahahaha.
---
Maybe that's what I was thinking of. Thanks for the correction!
---
As someone considering NE priest, can you elaborate on your last statement?

It’s notable that this June 19 stress test is a test of launch conditions for one entire region’s hardware. To make this test as helpful as possible we need to focus on only including the people of that region. This single region test allows us to better focus on any existing problems that need to be resolved and is an important pre-requisite to complete before multi-region testing.
---
In the next stress test, in July, with our single-region test complete, our plan is to test multiple regions under launch conditions, and this will include EU test realms.
---
Alliance casual guilds would be way over populated.
---
Don't worry, the next mobs will hit you just as sure as the last ones did.
---
The low effort nostalgia posts are awful. I'd rather come here to laugh.
---
Some people play the game to be the best, that’s how they have fun
---
Why would they have an NDA for a game that’s already been released? The beta is clearly a marketing move, seeing as they haven’t really advertised it much.
---
Why so anti horde ?  Why refuse Dwarf? Also why not paladin if you like heals?
---
What do you do when a warrior charges you and hamstrings you? What about if a rogue cheapshots you and has crippling poison? How do you kill a Paladin with blessing of freedom after he stuns you? How do you kill a mage who blinks into your dead zone, Frost novas, and then kills you while you stand there helpless?
---
You underestimate how valuable it is to have the jump on rogues. It could avoid you dying altogether.
---
Worrying is for people that lack confidence. This is Blizzard second chance to improve the game in a better and more meaningful way. Have confidence they will get it right.
---
I mean for leveling you can heal as shadow and for raids you need way less consumables then everyone else so it is somewhat balanced.
---
I'd take that over mobile any day. Plus then it still becomes portable!
---
Oh yeah mobile Diablo is the worst possible cash grab but WoW on Switch is the second comming of Jesus...
---
We have seen how shifting focuses work.
---
I want a hunter alt for the gold making. Also soloing dugeons sounds fun
---
Thanks a lot!
---
On the MC drops, I'm currently going under the assumption that items added in 1.3 and 1.4 will be phase 2. There's a [thread with Ion Hazzikostas](https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/1121853269033328641) where he says that's the general structure they're thinking. If this turns out to be wrong, I'll update as needed.
---
I have literally the exact same dilemma, and cannot decide. I think both races are cool, I just like NE a BIT more. Can't work out if that is enough for me to roll them even with the less optimal racials.
---
TBH I'd rather see no free trials at all unless they are completely and totally unable to interact with the rest of the server population until they sub. 
---
Gold sellers are so fucking annoying.
---
haha that's an awesome name
---
No. It's $300 and games are $60 a pop. I'm a serial downloader of games that I never play. The last thing I want to do is spend $360 on a console and play a game for 30 minutes before getting bored.
---
I think its the gerking/jerking phonetic
---
I‘m only pumped for leveling. I won‘t have enough time for raiding but leveling is fine because there is no pressure. I will probably level another twink to 60 when I reached max level. So I will have 2 high level chars in 2022 or so 😂
---
Agreed. I like it.
---
This was two weeks ago. How deep down the reddit hole you going bud?
---
This is not early wow. This is 14 years later. Most of the player base for Classic will probably be dudes in their 20s and 30s. Hell I think most young players will only be playing because their parents will be playing with them. 
---
If you wanna play babysitter for other people’s kids that’s fine. I still think the pay wall is a small price to pay to keep F2P tourists out of the game. The kind of players that don’t give a rats ass about their server rep because they are going to quit before they even make it to 60. 
---
Also the pay wall is why Actiblizzard is making Classic. Them sub numbers tho.
---
But the rogue professions is a bit of a hindrance. That set against the portaling abilities of a mage...... It's so hard!
---
Nit being able to summon your mount while oom is great. Especially in pvp
---
It can matter for things like AB when you are defending nodes and riding back and forth between them. The mana cost plus five second rule adds up. For general gameplay the mana cost isn’t too bad but since it’s a spell you are restricted by the global cooldown, whereas a regular mount you can lifetap and immediately begin mounting rather than waiting 1.5 seconds.
---
A really nice feature of classic is that you made tradeoffs with your class, race, professions, even your talents. Some were good at PvP, some good at farming, some good even with poor gear and others which scaled very well
---
Lol poverty?? In Germany the Average is around 18k a year and people can live pretty good with that money and can even go to vacations and stuff, im earning 27k/year and thats considered well above Average here... now go to Countrys like Romania where people get like 7-8k/year now thats where the problems begin
---
IF is filled with Dwarves (short stocky humans) and other very humanoid-esque things. Draenei (blue humans), Gnomes (short humans), Night Elves (purple humans).
---
Prob warlock for the summons, candy, and curses.
---
Or the mage for food and water, portals, and polymorph.
---
But then the priest for sick, sick shadow dps before going oom.
---
Or the shaman
---
&gt;Lots of toxicity all around. Just like the old days.
---
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
---
So basically you'd pick your class on the metric of how good it is at soloing escort-quests?
---
I'm not convinced that this is what I want. :o
---
For the twitch hype part there's more to it I think. A lot of streamers are at dreamhack and not streaming the game. What the streamers are streaming is different than before (leveling vs farming). Additionally, the actual beta was closed for a bit for alterac valley, right? I don't think all the classic wow streamers participated  or streamed a crazy amount of that.
---
I love how everyone seems to assume they’ll get full t3 gear in like the first month
---
This is the most compelling argument I have heard for a race so far. I hate corpse runs more than I hate anything else in this world. I was gonna make a priest. And for race I was trying to pic between undead human or dwarf. Now I'm going to definitely make a night elf priest.
---
Bonus points for good looks. And I can spend some time in goldshire if I get lonely. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
TLDR: It’s not as easy as you think, it’s about making your own personal stories with people on your server. 
---
Your post is somewhat confusing. Raiding not being enjoyable due to lack of balance and simple mechanics? Lack of balance is what made the game. Every class not having the same abilities and homogenization of all classes like in BFA actually makes you THINK about what class you want to be, because it matters. Simple Raid mechanics...if they were so simple how come more than 95% of Vanilla guilds never cleared Nax? Lots of guilds never cleared AQ40 or BWL...must have been too simple I guess. Hate to quote South Park, but the game doesn’t really start till lvl 60, which is true to an extent. 
---
For the most part it is about End Game content...but that also varies for each player. I came into vanilla about 5 months before BC. When I hit 60, my friends and I ran the crap out of 5 mans live and dead side of Strath...never ending fun and ways to make gold. Running groups for the Lord Val fight for the last 0.5 upgrade quest. We eventually started a guild just for 20man content, some of the best gaming I’ve ever done. The raids and gear are fun, but doing with your friends makes it infinitely more so. Ole GeneralCorndog screwed up and pulled more raptors in ZG, it was absolutely hectic, it was going to be a wipe but he DI’d my tank to save his repair bill and mine. When all was done, i used my jumper cables xl to try and pick up a healer and i did. Doesn’t sound like much, but it’s stories like this you can make in raids. If you’ve done any form of raiding in vanilla, you know what 
---
I’m talking about. 
---
I also did my share of PUG MC and Ony runs as an OT, thats a fun way to mingle with other guilds and really make new friends. Making friends from other guilds and you end up grouping up for othe dungeons or quests, it’s about the community in the end.

Not in PvP no. PvE it’s hard to argue with 30 sec CD on Fear Ward, and getting shadow raid spot is tough. I can argue with stone form because 3 min CD and even desperate prayer which is a whopping 10 min CD. For PvP shadow meld and shadow are great because you drink A LOT. Being able to drop combat and stealth drink is very good and you will do it ALL THE TIME.
---
Any of them.
---
World PvP is probably best to go with a Druid for the unlimited mobility and to compliment the kiting you can do to peel.
---
Shaman is probably the weakest of all - but if you have really strong communication and can call for grounding totems etc... 
---
it can be really good.
---
Priest is the best if you want to have a 1vX melee situation.
---
The bubble can let you secure really good novas without taking 50% of you hp.
---
But the best is Druid for World PvP.
---
Near unkillable if played right - and if you’re peeling.
---
Plus, their roots can piss off pesky gnomes using escape artist.
---
Not when the other person playing is a minor, considered my legal guardian. Underage children can’t have their own account - so they are allowed to share with an adult. 
---
I literally double checked this with Blizzard already.
---
He was the best paladin in the world... I don't know what else needs to be said. When someone attacks him he goes *shhhhttt* around the corner.
---
I tried it for fights, and while it's possible I really feel hindered when playing on my tablet/phone without a keyboard. I'd imagine if you were a pet class and killing 1 mob and didn't have to kite it'd be ok. Anything requiring actions&amp;movement is just not doable - at least that I've tried so far.

PvE servers are worse. Your enemies will steal aggro on your npc target, run away fast and reset the mob. Then they follow you around doing it repeatedly and you can't stop them. I'd rather it be just a quick fight.
---
Plus lvl 29 warriors are easy af to twink.
---
I don't act like that myself but those people helped us Classic so it would be hypocritical of me not to acknowledge their effectiveness.
---
Your point is being dismissed, yet your data clearly shows a drastic change in interest. I think in general, people in this community are too positive and hyped, which is always the case before a game releases. They dont want to question or doubt anything: sharding, layering, wrong animations, dubious beta invite process etc. Anyone "dissenting" is seen as a troll who is here to ruin the fun for others. Hivemind's are formed with good yet ignorant intentions.
---
As to your point, the argument was made by streamers and their followers, that the reason they were given beta access had nothing to do with testing the game, but to act as a extended marketing arm for Blizzard. If that is the case, then Classic Beta has gone on for too long, as interest in watching the game has declined. The purpose of a advertisement is to leave people wanting more, not linger around and overstay your welcome.
---
Those of us who love the game will play it regardless, but consider the people who are in doubt. These people likely did not play private servers and rather than seeing old Org or SW on their own, they saw it through a streamer. That rather than having to readjust to how slow the combat was and how they had to rewire their brain, they just saw someone else do that. Its your memories being played out by someone else.
---
The argument against this might be that, well these people would quit anyway. But i am not so sure. There is something special about leveling your own character, and experiencing these things for the first time since the game came out, that might make you more attached to the game. Instead they saw much of this with streamers and may feel their got their 'fill' of Classic.
---
Meh you only need 2 Dwarf Priests in a raid and in PvP, the trinket dispels fear anyway. And it's not like you're going to be constantly feared all the time to make it super necessary. Stoneform is probably a nicer racial IMO but I'm going NE for the looks mostly anyway. I'll enjoy it more and I think I'll get far more usage out of Shadowmeld than the Dwarf racials.
---
Getting around with portals/teleport is SO nice, I can never argue anyone out of playing mage, that alone is worth any "downside" to the class which is usually just "boring dps rotation, very squishy" for vanilla. I think I need to coordinate with my friends because both of these classes are more fun when you pair up. Multiple mages raining down blizzard in AV is hilarious, and 2+ rogues together is obviously completely hilarious and unfair if you coordinate well.
---
There is a lot of this going around...
---
I logged into my priest last night and took a rummage through his bags and bank that took 45 minutes. Drakefire Amulet, Seal of Ascension, Eternal Quintessence, Benediction, Tabard of the Argent Dawn, Seal of Eldre'Thalas, Transcendence gear, Eye of the Beast, Mar'li's eye, festival suits from the first lunar festival, a bag of crafting stuff like Large Brilliant Shards, Essence of Undeath, and Righteous Orbs... A lot of memories.
---
I am so ready to do it all again.
---
Yeah, that's what I'd assume.  Could be ok for simple farming of mobs but in reality I think I'd use it for non combat stuff such as crafting and gathering while I'm waiting on code builds/deploys at work lol.  Gotta find a clever way to make up for the "having a life" problem...
---
We all play for different reasons. And every individual reason is completely valid.
---
Whether you want to re-experience the trek to 60 with all the ups and downs, getting camped, camping, doing elite quests with groups of random people you find, making new friends, completing quests you never knew about.  
---
Maybe you felt like you missed out by playing a class that you never really clicked with (green grass syndrome) and are excited to simply see the game from a different point of view.  
---
Maybe you wish you had it in you to push ranking, and want to really try this time around.  
---
Maybe you started late, and never experienced being at the forefront with the good guilds, didn't experience the big server events like the war effort and subsequent banging of the gong and 10 hour Silithus war.  
---
Maybe your guild sucked and couldn't get past Razorgore or Vael, and want to see the content you missed out on.  
---
Maybe you were unable to kill KT (like the vast, vast majority, myself included) and want to "finish" what you started so many summers ago.  
---
     
---
Or maybe you simply never played vanilla and are excited to experience all it has to offer.  
---
There are many reasons to play the game, and many reasons to be excited. All are valid. Play the game your way.

Lol ok, I see you have a problem.

Whoever hired you definitely works for the Alliance and knows the Horde needs you. My daggers smile knowing there's one less Horde to have to kill on the road.
---
In all seriousness, congrats on the new job and Classic will still be there when your training is done!
---
Yes it is. Being able to kill mobs a lot faster makes things easier. And funnier.
---
Sorry. I didn't realize you would need this. Here.
---
Oh I see, I interpreted that bluepost as a clarification of the "old/no longer known" mechanic of why weaponskill appeared to give additional hitrating. Not as an additional formula to be added into previous (speculated?) mechanics.  
---
Then again, I was a stupid kid in vanilla (havent played since) and took all the values stated by other players as gospel so I really have no idea myself.
---
Yous out here trying to get me fired? I already lurk this sub on my work toilet as is
---
Wotlk was an insane expac if you take out the content draughts and felt like the most cohesive story. Cata had arguably the largest difficulty jump in raiding. MoP was probably the best pvp full stop. WoD did questing right. The story was junk but arguably some of the best raids the game has seen. Legion fucking nailed class AND power fantasy. BFA is hard to say because we don't have the 20/20 hindsight we have for the rest of the expacs. BC did great things for hybrids.
---
To say the game has gotten worse over time objectively is flat wrong. It does warrant saying that the game probably should have shifted to a new engine in Legion as the game mechanics changed pretty drastically in that expac. Just as in Cata when they phased out the modded warcraft 3 engine. 
---
That said I think they should phase some of the lower pop realms into different expacs. So you can experience the journey of each 'story' or 'adventure' for your character, but that's just the preservationist in me.
---
you just exposed youself
---
NOT TO ALL SUBS! ONLY MURICA AND DOWN UNDER!
---
&gt; This stress test will be accessible to anyone with an active World of Warcraft game account **in the Americas &amp; Oceania region.**
---
Not exactly **all** active subs.
---
I'd buy this....
---
That’s true but it’s a lot harder. The heal casts take longer, you don’t get heal crits as often, and the extra armor buff and other goodies heal spec gives you...but yeah it could be done if people aren’t gogogogogogo which by P2 will be pretty common
---
This videos dumb
---
By the time you got those shoulders and Thunderfury nobody was playing AV anymore.
---
The only reason for a Warrior to play AV was to get the unstoppable force because without a private healer you were a charge/fear bot.
---
This behavior also happens just outside of RFK as you near the entrance portal. There's like an imaginary line about 5 feet away that when crossed will make enemies/players despawn and respawn. I don't know if it's been addressed since I haven't been back there since the lvl cap was increased to 40.
---
But with that said, there may be a few select areas where you can force layering like OP vid.
---
well I did it.. may seem crazy but there you go... see you on the stress test fellow WoW nerds :)
---
Some of you people [can't make up your goddamn minds.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bltu0o/i_fully_expect_to_get_downvoted_for_this_but_what/)

---
The downside of ret paladins, warriors, rogues and hunters is that a concerning amount of pre-raid BiS is leather.
---
I’d suggest just finding a guild and make friends early on.
---
Or start your own guild.
---
For the 1H/2H, if you click the filter icon in the top right corner of the selection panel, you can uncheck 2H. A lot of people are missing this, so I may try to improve the design here to make it a bit more obvious. And totally agree on switching sort when multiple EPs are selected, it's on my list.
---
Glad you're enjoying the site!
---
Warlock. Every set they've ever had is good looking. In classic they have the best tier 1 2 and 3. I like other classes individual tiersets better in some cases, but no other class has 3 tiers so nice as a collection. They also have great kit with sustain and damage. I may do one as an alt. I played hunter for a longtime on retail, vanilla up through wrath. Kinda dont want such a similar experience as warlock is to hunter, and would rather have options to play differently as pure dps got old after a while. Dps is a dime a dozen and even if you're doing great it's all about the epeen rat race to get the highest meter you can by milking every advantage.
---
Maybe. But you're not always going to be facing rogues. Escape Artist helps during questing as well.
---
Rogue, warlock or hunter. 
---
Classic can't come soon enough because every day I change my decision. I just need finally one class to choose and focus on it.
---
see that one warrior cast taunt? noob.
---
I do plan on doing endgame but I still havn't decided if I am going to do more PvE than PvP. In Vanilla I focused more on PvP so this time around I am going to see if I can possibly try do a balancing act between the two. I think I am leaning more toward the PvE experience this time.
---
PvP is/was just so damn fun in vanilla though that I just don't know if I can resist entirely.
---
3 and a half hours to 7.. wow you really stopped to smell the roses ! Glad you’re enjoying it though. 69 days to go!!
---
Ah yes, the good old days of farming unstoppable force on my shaman.
---
Warrior &gt; Rogue &gt; Mage &gt; Repeat.
---
Didn't see your post.. sorry to steal your thunder man! 😬
---
You start with mage, use it to farm riches, then use those riches to buy gear when leveling your warrior.
---
Ya, it's definitely a shame that the community keeps complaining that leveling needs to be easier and easier in Retail. I hope that the community for Classic learns from its mistakes and doesn't make similarly stupid requests.
---
As a rogue pulling bosses and vanishing to reset them was always fun.
---
I understand what you are saying and even agree. But I still have to add: "Oh no will the multi million dollar company need to spend some money. Boohoo!"
---
THE ORCISH HORDE ON AN OPEN FIELD, GENERAL STORMPIKE
---
There's not much you could scale on a hunter that wouldn't make the borderline gods in world pvp.  They only use three abilities, autoshot, aimed shot, multishot.  If those get scaled any higher you would global any cloth all the time.
---
Ye i was thinking druid too, but mages can peel very good, then shaman or priests damage should be very good? Since melee will be slowed or sit in nova most of the time. And vs ranged i guess shaman is better?
---
He got rank 1 from 5s playing with hydra and world first 80 in wotlk by abusing a bug which made blizzard ban him and strip the achievement. He's more or less a con man.
---
Night Elf Hunter here. I've always loved the lore and feel of this race. Played other races to 60 strictly for their racial abilities, only to find myself going back to my beloved NE. I'm a tree-hugging hippie and I cannot deny it.
---
I always felt like paladin paired really well with mage. Druid already has a decurse and the mage wouldn't ever need to peel for them. Paladin paired with mage can cleanse everything. There's also nothing quite like blowing melee away with BoP on.
---
I'm with you on most of this.  But it's a slippery slope.
---
I loved the LFG finder and Flying mounts.  Sitting in trade chat for 30-90 minutes as a DPS sucked.  Some nights you couldn't even find a group.  And running for hours and hours and hours sucked.  But also realize these are some of the large changes that helped kill Vanilla style and flavor.  
---
There is no right or wrong.  Some "grass isn't always greener" or "you don't know what you got till it's gone" might apply.
---
Everyone on this forum will tell you that NE 1% dodge is useless because of threat and it shows they never really played classic.
---
Germans have a word for it, Schadenfreude, it’s experiencing joy at the suffering of someone else. That pretty much encapsulates a gankers reason for being. 
---
So, if you feel you’d like to be in the receiving or giving end, pvp server is for you.
---
If you skip Permafrost, doesn't it hinder your AoE capabilities?
---
Any lock that's farming is going to put that shard bag away

---
Holy is actually pretty good for leveling, and probably better than shadow sub 40.
---
Oh I know about how bad WoD was, while I didn't experience even a fraction of what most people suffered during that launch I had a very clear view of the train wreck I escaped through sheer luck.
---
Imagine being me level 97-98 starting Nagrand and the thirty or so guild mates of mine being only in the 91-93 level range and when I /who my server for Nagrand or Spires there is less than 20 players total between the two zones.
---
Just because I escaped the Frostfire and Gorgrond leveling hell doesn't mean I didn't see it eat away at peoples sanity.
---
For sure, had to shoot the shit with all the party mates I had :) and of course help a few do their own things!
---
Free Food/Water ✔️ 
---
Top caster DPS end game ✔️ 
---
Teleports and Portals ✔️
---
 Multiple viable Specs while leveling and end game✔️
---
Being a Gnome is best choice✔️

Can AOE mobs when you don't want to quest for exp✔️

Can AOE grind late game dungeons like Dire Maul for crazy exp/gold/mats✔️

How do people actually not play mage lmao

Beans and other legumes have anywhere from 6-20+ fiber per 100g.
---
Pinto beans have 16g/100 for example.
---
Same with most nuts, hazelnuts have 10g per 100, macadamia 9.
---
Even most peanut butters have atleast 6g per 100.
---
Lots of fruits and vegetables have atleast 5-7g of it as well.
---
Then you have your grain products. 
---
Combining these in a meal or two should satisfy your daily needs.
---
I'm honestly surprised they even made such a product. Considering you can buy game controller attachments for smartphones.
---
Personally I would rather if they do other expansions in a Classic type way, they don't allow you to copy your characters forward to those servers. I like the idea of everyone starting fresh with a clean slate in a new expansion. If you want to play a persistent game, go play retail. I would think most people are playing Classic to play the game they loved, not necessarily caring overall about loot and what they get.
---
Mom, bathroom! Bathroom!
---
Ok.
---
This
---
That mofo must have hurt
---
Homestly scattershot is the answer to most of these
---
It's the only option for alliance players who don't want to be tiny.
---
You use SoR because both the white and yellow damage have a chance to proc nightfall
---
No. 
---
Classic wasn’t balanced. The game has never been balanced. 
---
Them trying to balance is what has lead to all the classes being the same now. 
---
If you want a perfectly balanced game play an FPS game.
---
I've thought a lot about that too.
---
I came to the conclusion that I'd want a different spec for PvP, farming and raiding.
---
There may be a decent compromise though.
---
Shamans/druids can use use HS to bait silences, the same way Esfand baits a counter spell in [this clip](https://youtu.be/kujzD7aOBwc?t=204) with Dartol's Rod of Transformation.
---
no u
---
Happy cake day!
---
I had a 60 of every class except shaman and hunter when TBC launched. Then in TBC, I mained a shaman. I wasn't addicted, I could stop any time I wanted.
---
The class dynamics have been one of the worst casualties of the last 15 years. Not every class has an answer for everything. Everyone has an interrupt, everyone has some sort of CC, everyone has a self heal, everyone has one or more defensive cooldowns. 
---
Classis classes created a need for their presence simply by virtue of what they had that others didn't and what others had that they locked. Raids came together like puzzle pieces. Perfect.
---
Priests were the best consistent healers but weren't as good at responding to spikes and bursts. Druids had enough HOT elements to deal with bursts even though they couldn't match the numbers or efficiency of a priest. They worked great together.
---
Even though these two classes filled a "healer" role, they were incredibly different in play style. That was another thing that I miss from wow. Even classes in the same role felt and played differently.
---
A friend of mine was one of our main raiding druids back in vanilla and I was one of our main priests. We used to (without telling the guild) trade accounts on raid nights for content that we had on farm because it broke the monotony.
---
Have you seen beta? Players get aggro from two dots and wand.
---
I know- I love the little guys. They do kill microSD quite often, though, especially if the device power cycles often.
---
I could just run it in a container though.
---
This will happen once in a million.
---
Just means you'll waste 10x more time dead than the rest of us
---
I would atleast wanna try it!
---
&gt;But wasn’t sure if there was a official comment from Blizzard about working out some class issues down the road.
---
Wouldn't be classic if they did. Would be BfA which already exists. 
---
Sorry bud.
---
So how does that translate when you are raiding as a tank?
---
Especially vs. Night Elves’ 1% dodge?
---
I do like the tier set tokens and the different sets per spec. Adapting to the game, fine and well, but do you feel like that, when your current tier set is for tanks, while you are dps spec and have to collect tons of offset gear? Collecting the tier set is a big factor for many players.
---
And even if, it should then be consistent, for warriors all tier-sets in vanilla are designed for tanks, with the exception of T2.5, which is semi tank and semi dps.
---
For paladins, you have T1, which has some str and + healing, which makes it not very good for any spec, except a weird healer, who also autoattacks. T2 has spelldmg and some strength, which makes it decent for all specs, but not exceptionally great, as it lacks crit for ret, lacks defense stats for prot and lacks healing for holy. T2.5 is straight up designed for rets and T3 is straight up designed for holy.
---
No. I think you are missing my point here. Bear with me.
---
Rested experience is not an incentive to log out. It is a mechanic that was designed to get people to log *back in*. It makes leveling seem more doable to someone who may be discouraged to play. It was created and exists as bait. It's attractive and there aren't meaningful downsides. The opportunity cost is minimal and it only exists while leveling, *not while raiding*. 
---
You just can't make the argument that world buffs were designed to have any impact on a player's decision to log in or log out. The player has to choose between productive in-game activities and logging out to hold onto a buff, and they feel that this is the optimal way to play because it actually is, *in a raid setting*.
---
Rested experience and world buffs are apples and oranges.
---
I don't care about the semantics. I never said "this is an exploit". I said that the way world buffs work is bad design, and I don't believe that its best for the health of the game. I think my statement stands true. Game developers don't *intentionally* create systems that make logging out more rewarding than playing the game. Blizzard is a company that exists to make money. We are their revenue sources, and they have every incentive to keep us engaged and online. Systems that encourage logging out are just bad business.
---
Avian Colour Gangs. This should be a thing.
---
Okay, I'll refrain from posting my thoughts on the internet from now on.
---
Invite them to your group and battle shout?
---
Enjoy the 2 min attack power buff friend!
---
When ever I've seen a lowbe alliance I would follow him for a bit, emoting hug/love to build their confidence aven help them kill mobs, the seconed they feel comfortable and emote back to me i would kill them and be on with my business
---
Bread is not  healthy
---
Beats druid being lumped with say rogues and then never seeing their tierset because the upgrade is bigger for a rogue.
---
U know the drill, unless we want to sap then run away.
---
The alliance
---
Blackrock seemed to be the official Aussie server, I enjoyed people arguing about the proper way to pronounce ZA and ZG. I think the time zone difference contributed to the server having virtually no down time. It was pretty awesome to be able to pug pretty much all content available.
---
ok fak you you hater
---
Guild banks  (avoid having to use an individual's alt and account sharing)
---
Pet and mount tabs (allow you to collect without being constrained by inventory space)
---
Conveniences like sell all greys, some mailbox stuff.
---
I think those would all be uncontroversial if Blizz ever did go the OSRS vote-on-changes route (am not suggesting they should be in the game now)
---
You mean sharding?
---
Ye, i want to play pala but all my friends want to go horde, so horde it is:(
---
Gerk
---
Which is a vastly longer time spent gearing up than just getting the non changing twink BiS and then pvping. Why are you being obtuse?
---
If he rolls Alliance he can find out by level 15!
---
Don’t forget to sell your water/jerky as soon as you spawn your new character for the 10c and buy rockbiter with it
---
My final vanilla character was also the last character I played in Retail when I came back to the game after a 5 year hiatus.
---
I didn't understand the importance of the Tabard of the protector most people put on it but the simple act of wearing it and using the effect sparked up more conversations I've had in WoW in the 4-5 months I played coming back in BfA than I probably had in the entire WotLK expansion combined where just nobody would talk with anyone else.
---
I doubt this will happen. Classic will be a premium product that requires a sub, especially when you consider that they'll be losing a lot of money from the lack of a cash shop.
---
It's similar to EverQuest. The game is somewhat free-to-play nowadays but the TLP servers still require subscriptions to access.
---
You could farm a lot of gold in that time though
---
Tank and healer are Druid’s two good pve roles. mDPS and rDPS are where they suffer the most.
---
Keanu Reevs
---
I must be in the minority where the first thing that I do when I install a new game is turn off music because I find it distracting.
---
Switching phase doesn't change any existing selected items at the moment, it will just change the items you see when selecting items moving forward. There are two changes I'm looking at around this:
---
1) When you change to an earlier phase, remove items that you should no longer have access to.
---
2) Allow autofill at any time, not just on empty sets. This would let you edit the phase, then hit autofill again to get the proper items for that phase.
---
This is not true at all. So many people on r/wow, r/competitivewow, r/wowcirclejerk and few other subs shit on Classic whenever they can. On r/wow Classic haters are pushing rule about no Classic posts on that sub.
---
I'm still subbed to BfA, altough I Iogin like once per week. When we're discussing Classic in chat there are so many people on my realm literally hoping for Classic to fail and telling us how it's just nostalgia. 
---
Both groups are toxic and hateful.
---
Druids are generally very bad if you are not very good druid. Disc priest is the best. You got PI, shield, manaburn, fear, devouring plaque and incredible survability. And in 1v1 situations ( lets say your mage friend dies ) its very strong.
---
And since you dont duo with a warrior the sheild is not an issue for you, since you dont need to worry about warriors rage gain.
---
I have been playing disc priest in alot of private server and i can also sat, that disc priest is very fun to play in PvP.
---
So those racials may or may not save your life once during a WSG/AB match? Meanwhile I can Shadowmeld drink to get back into a fight, I can escape death while healing at range by Shadowmelding after my team starts dying so I don't die as well, I can Shadowmeld hide to defend a point or help with an ambush. The possibilities are endless.
---
Nothing that forces me to play healer or tank please, like the 90% other players
---
Is it possible to do this with an iPhone?
---
Blizzard almost always screws up everything they attempt,  at least Activision blizzard,  old school blizzard was amazing.  One of the best parts about classic release is that private servers will have more accurate info.  RIP good ping though
---
If a warlock gets 2-5 enemy healers with curse of tongues sometimes that will break an entire stalemate. Don’t underestimate
---
You nailed it, I was a stoned 15-16 year old with no idea what I was doing (min-max wise).  I wasn't raiding on a schedule, just random UBRS pugs.  It didn't help that I spent all my time leveling a paladin to realize I didn't want to be a healer.  
---
I spent a year doing all the low level stuff, grinding out BRD and other random 5 mans with low success rates.  My plan is to be ahead of the curve in general.  I don't want the bulk of the server out gearing me.  Rushing to 60 should ensure that.  If I want a slow, laid back leveling process, I will make an alt or 2.
---
Can you link a better sprint spec so we can have a good laugh?
---
There have been a few requests along these lines. You can't do this right now. I'm going to make some improvements to the filter options when you're selecting items and keep this in mind.
---
This is more a positioning and experience sort of thing tbh. I used to feel the same way but after a while of diving in and getting btfo'd I started to realize about priority targets and overextending and peeling for your healers.
---
LMAO
---
I'm glad you understood what I meant (and then some)
---
I love the little buggers as well, but indeed, frequent powercycles are  a problem for 'm.
---
which is a problem, because ideally I'd like to turn off my network stack when I go to sleep.
---
I would buy the Switch immediatly :D
---
I just worry that the game will end up dumbed down to be compatible with these devices.
---
Before it was nerfed, Shadowmeld + Aimed Shot was OP as shit.  You didn't break stealth until the shot fired so you would basically have them mostly dead before they even knew you were there.
---
Yes sir.  Just look up "Chrome Remote Desktop" in the app store.  Any RDP client will work though, I just find the chrome one to be extremely convenient.
---
Who plays Warlock on Classic?
---
WoW classic on mobile would work decently too.
---
1-2 button rotations for leveling and perfect for fishing or gathering nodes.
---
There is no way to they intended to have ppl logging in and logging out on alts, just to raid
---
You can do that for one-off item selection after you do the intial autofill by clicking the filter icon in the top right corner of the item selection panel. I'm also planning on allowing autofill on non-empty sets soon, which I think would cover what you're looking for here.
---
With layering it's going to be a viddy business trying to keep up with the spawns.
---
Hahah my friends are torn pretty much 50/50 right now. Honestly I keep making druids on pservers and regret it. No OOC res, and a whole bunch of talents, skills, and even set bonuses don't work inside. It's easily my vote for weakest class overall in vanilla. The jack of all trades things falls apart because of the indoors bullshit imo. 
---
Priest and shaman are both good choices. Priest is way better if it's played defensively on horde, since they are the only ones with a magic dispel.
---
Well to be fair that was 2009 or 2010 and I have no money and decent internet to play retail wow and at that time I still dont get the hype of wow so Idecided to play the private server and try installing my own just to see you know..when you love the game, you wanted to know the core of it. Trinity, arcemu, stuff like that.
---
yea but why
---
Things I cry about because I'm a big baby is what you should of called it
---
Im in this boat, I feel that they are 2 distinctively different experiences and I cant wait to enjoy them both.
---
Are you me? Lol
---
I cant decide whether to go rogue or paladin for classic.
---
Can someone confirm?  If you're a human you only need 6% hit on gear?  That's disgusting..
---
the dream
---
&lt;Warsong Lumberjacks&gt; Everyone wields axes. Bonus points if you have the WSG tabard.
---
And spamming trade chat is what they will be used for. And making dead bodies to spell out websites. This kind of crap happened all the time in Vanilla.
---
No plans yet, but it's an interesting idea. There have been some other suggestions around selecting which professions your character has which is along the same lines. I may add a few more options like this to provide more context on searches.
---
Not to mention you can also occasionally be locked out due to a counterspell interrupt and drop combat, but still be locked from your mount.
---
Or the fact that your mount summon spell is on the GCD, whereas using the item from your inv is not.  When every split second matters, sometimes that is the difference between mounting up before the enemy gets there or not!
---
The talent not only improves dampen but also amplify.
---
So against melee-bosses you are gifting your healers +127 healing-power for those two talent-points.
---
I'd argue that in a raiding-environment that's temendously more usefull than improved counterspell. But then again 1 mage having the improvement is enough for the raid as you'll usually just keep it on the tanks who are healed more frequently.
---
Yes i tried priest on a private server, i think they are the most fun, but i realy couldnt survive at all vs melee, maybe because i was in i full blue vs those super geared, but does that change if i hhave equal gear? Because i survived better with shaman and druid
---
Nah it's the word 'king'
---
Warrior is the optimal tank spec. Druid is viable, but generally speaking if you want to play a tank you should pick warrior. 
---
You are going to notice right off the bat that your threat generation is dogshit compared to legion / retail. Generally speaking right now on retail you are trying to optimize your damage while keeping up active mitigation during portions of heavy damage on you. You cycle cooldowns at key points or when you do big pulls. Agro is not a thing and generally speaking when you touch something it's going to be glued to you forever.
---
In classic your tools for active mitigation and self sustain are incredibly limited. Your main focus is maintaining agro and managing the limited amount of rage you are getting. 
---
You should level as dps. Even when you get 60 you will probably stay dps so you can farm and tank as your DPS spec. 
---
One of the big differences between current wow and classic is that each spec in current wow feels like a nearly completely different class. In classic you spec just enhances a particular playstyle, but you still maintain your class identity regardless of spec. That means you can certainly tank as Arms or Fury spec.
---
Warriors are hard to level and if you have a dedicated partner it's a good idea to team up. Warriors go good with people that can heal obviously, so paladin priest shaman druid are ideal partners. 
---
&gt; What is the best tank spec available in terms of both playability and efficiency?
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/AvDBATAF_xTwElA
---
This is a cookie cutter starter prot build. When you walk into MC the first time this will probably be your spec or something close to it.
---
Everyone complains about hunter dps but hunters bring so much to a raid besides their dps and any skilled hunter will be a welcome addition to a raid or dungeon if they know the fullest extent of their own abilities
---
Great suggestion, I'll give this some more thought. Thanks for the feedback.
---
&gt;Not considering the fun factor
---
&gt; Stealth is just too fun
---
All things I have allergies to. No wonder my shits take an eternity.
---
Is that what the beta looks like?
---
If they bring back the classic add-ons, you could almost bot your character.
---
I once healed a sunken temple on a paladin using a healbot, autoclicker, and /follow on a caster.
---
Yes, I approve. Warriors and 2h shamans just killing everything that moves
---
I understand. No judgement from this nerd.
---
&gt;Not rolling ele shaman mustard rice
---
*Laughs in blood and thunder*
---
Yes please!
---
&gt; I'm not belittling anyone
---
&gt;can't imagine that slave pay to be real
---
This argument doesn't work in any game which utilizes instances with fixed number of players.
---
I.e. World of Warcraft and every other themepark ever made.
---
Unless you want to play solo forever, of course.
---
Your point stands just fine without completely misrepresenting how big of an advantage minmaxin can gain you. There's no reason to lie to people (unless you're just ignorant)
---
&gt; Leveling was THE game 
---
For some maybe. Raiding is where my hearts at. Leveling is just a means to that end.
---
I was stuck between paladin, priest and mage for what felt like an eternity. Settled on a warlock :D
---
If you don't receive it after a couple retries, you could send me a direct message with username or email and I can have a look at what's happening in your case. I'm seeing some bounces here and there.
---
Arenas 
---
No gaming experience has quite captured the feeling of high rated arenas with a balanced &amp; skilled 3v3 teams fighting each other.  Just ridiculously fun but there are some serious balance issues currently and too much upkeep to complete with little team (neck ilvl, traits, pve gear, etc).
---
It ain't that simple bucko.
---
Pretty sure living bomb was Cata even...
---
To be honest the launch will probably be horrific. It would be better efficiency wise to take your vacation about 2 or 3 weeks into launch.
---
The way mob tagging works in classic is going to make the exp / time rates horrible until people spread out a bit more unless you happen to get ahead of the crowd, which most will not. 
---
Anyway, take the position and congrats on the 23k more a year.
---
Having played lock on private servers lately , I can tell you it is going to be hell on launch because there is no instant spell that tags a mob.
---
That would be super cool :) keep up the great work!
---
I wouldn’t say any of that is elitism.
---
Sure the - don’t group with you on retail is nasty - but I think there is a lot more going on beyond that comment.
---
The fact you state there was no issue during the dungeon and the tank was pleasant and agreeable - but you chose to bitch about it in Gchat - shows the type of person you are.
---
You had a minor issue - where the tank informed you that he could lose threat due to your enhancement — and you immediately became defensive.
---
Next time just say “hey, if I pull threat the first few pulls, I’ll switch it”.
---
You’re the equivalent of a ranked widow player w/ no history of playing ranked on widow, not accepting to switch if something goes wrong the first few moments.
---
It puts the worst foot forward for the group.
---
If you did pull threat - would you blame the tank for not holding it because he is “level 31, and you are 28”?
---
See, that’s the path people think you’ll go down.
---
Just like a widow not stating or offering to switch.
---
It seems it is you that has the elitist problem - not your guild, and not reddit.
---
Weird. Why would they make it this way? That literally makes the talent free.
---
Haters will say this isn’t fake.
---
Where does Doritos and mountain dew fall on the healthy scale?
---
You're making too much sense and going against the narrative.  
---
Armor reduction don't stack on bosses like on private servers.  And the pary is way higher on bosses, so less threat for tanks so less DPS for warriors.  But whatever.
---
Please use r/buildapc for this question.
---
Wat?
---
Dwarf run animation turns you into a bouncy ball... The old dwarf run looked more serious.
---
There are a couple more cons.
---
\- Poor mobility
---
\- No useful threat reduction (MD + imp means losing SM, DS or MD + succ damage)
---
I'll be honest, I can't remember my thinking on that decision. I agree with you on it being useful to have those separate, and you'll likely see that change soon.
---
And another great point on showing spell damage school totals in some way. It's on my list.
---
Thanks for the feedback!
---
Fastest leveling time ever is something like 120 hours, so almost 5 days of straight played.
---
Basically no one is going to be level 60 in that first week.
---
Ya id say mage or hunter are pretty easy mode. The absolute king of 2-3 button spam has to be shadow priest tho.
---
Yes, I don't think it would really be worth it to sub for 24 hours of classic.
---
I shall see you in August then.
---
I'd play it.
---
"Most"
---
Tried to rez at a different Spirit Healer in the stress test and it sends you back to the Spirit Healer closest to your body even if you run far away and try to rez somewhere else.
---
So no, you can't. No matter what you do, you need to either rez at your body or at the closest spirit healer. Don't know what they did in Vanilla but that's what they're doing in Classic.
---
Was going from Teldrassil to Stormwind on my NE Priest in Stress test and inevitably died on the road in Wetlands. Thought I'd wisp form my way to Ironforge only to find myself rezzed near my body in Wetlands.
---
I'm doing the same. Those bow animations are so good!
---
My time expired a few hrs after the Av week.
---
They have me beta and 2 mins later took it away.
---
They might not give you access if your time is expiring. 
---
But dont quote me.
---
&gt;  Stormdrain
---
Ah, using the Brandon Sanderson naming convention! :D
---
Shouldn’t give the mature language message would just say that name is unavailable.
---
Have buttons open radial menus you control with one of the joysticks.
---
Bumpers for your main spells, radials for your less used.
---
I have the same feeling about class/spec balancing. Of course a little tweak here and there are not going to change a lot... and before you know it, we are back into the infinite loop of balancing everything. 
---
^(But I would really love to have a good Lightwell with my Priest.)
---
Not that I believe OP but you can get software engineering internships that pay that at the hypescales.
---
It's insanely strong and very few buttons. It takes a moderate amount of skill to be aware of your raid frames in PvP and cleanse your team tho. Something most shadow priest seem incapable of doing :/
---
Both of you have fun filling out raid guild applications. I'll be sitting back here in my Bis gear deciding which of these raid guilds is most worthy to receive my heals.
---
It's kind of sad seeing all the things in my bank that have turned gray.
---
 /s ?
---
&gt;So, what would you propose to handle this initial spike that will be steeper than anything WoW ever experienced? Nothing, exactly.
---
Yes, nothing, exactly. I propose we let 1000 players stand around in Elwynn forest trying futilely to tag boars and kobolds as they spawn. The whole point of classic is to bring the classic mechanics back, right? If in 2019 that means the game is totally unplayable for several weeks... then the game is totally unplayable for several weeks. It's part of the charm!
---
Fixing it defeats the purpose of having a classic server.
---
Haha is this a troll?
---
I've read a number of articles/blogs from ex Nihilum members in which it was stated that Awake was actually awful despite being over geared.
---
Unsure how you can call someone the best pali ever to have lived then in the next line "He was exceptional" haha..
---
I know prot paladin may seem tempting, but you can easily tank or heal in ret spec if you keep a sword and board and some int gear. I personally prefer to go down holy tree first for consecrate, but you can go straight down ret tree and still heal or tank fairly well. Its more about gear than spec while leveling.
---
Elemental shaman, hands down. Mages don't need constant healing since they have great control of fights, so having burst ranged damage available to you is a huge benefit. 
---
Ret paladins with reckoning come second. Blessing of sacrifice to break CC, blessing of freedom, blessing of protection, poison removal, and unstoppable healing via bubble. 
---
Priests are a close third.

NA-PvP-Whatever Lateish Night
---
Experienced raider with a young family looking for raid group 2-3 nights week (no more.  2 pref) starting some time after 8pm, preferably 9 or 10 EST.  Will be able to play a fair amount outside of raid time, although more sporadically.  Will play whatever class/role needed as I'm undecided as all hell.  Horde or Alliance is fine, although I prefer horde.  Will PvP like a mofo.
---
Just to level a character* 
---
Means all you are doing is levelling a single character - no plans for end game PvP, PvE, BiS gearing.
---
You can tell this is a current patch screenshot, IF is empty.   RIP

I'm hoping that I'll at least get access for the game time I do have.

They can't even kite most things. They just stand there and take it, but still win a lot of the time.

Jokes aside, which was more viable for raiding? Enhancement or Ret. i get that neither is optimal but which brings more to the raid?

Yeah, private server increased spawn rates/notes of black lotus and it was still basically perma-camped. What people fail to realize is that those private servers had global populations that amounted to a server that would have had a queue of a thousand people.... for each region. Nost could have been split up into 4 servers with high population. Having this on one server meant there was no low pop hours. The best time to farm in vanilla was before school/work in the mornings. You could be twice as efficient if you're farming nodes. This just wasn't an option on pservers.
---
A break from WoW
---
Thanks, I'm filtering the data at the moment, will post it here on reddit, soon :-)
---
Yea look at the back and forth I had with the other guy there.
---
I get what they were going for with Lightwell, but I feel like they barely tested it aside from making sure it works. Particularly when you designed raids around being spaced out.    
---
But yeah, I agree. It is very tempting to just starting "well this little change here." But some of these little changes can have a big impact. Like for example pets don't scale with gear, it is super broken, but fixing it will have huge impacts on endgame and PvP balance.
---
Shadowmeld can effectively be used as in interrupt if needed. Shadowmeld before a cast goes off and it wont actually go off.
---
I’ll probably level one horde, and one alliance and then Quit the game.

We're not talking BfA

---
This is the closest I've come to an existential crisis.
---
The reason those wouldn't be as popular of a topic to make fun of is because they're not bastardized versions of the game that classic is trying to recreate. It has nothing to do with player count, classic could have 1/10th the players and it will still be a better game for most of the people on this sub. 
---
Keep in mind that a lot of us wanted very badly for BFA (or legion, or WoD, or MoP, or Cata) to be good, but it wasn't. I may laugh at/upvote shitty memes making fun of it, but I do so out of a place of frustration and sadness. I do so because I'm bitter that the MMORPG themepark game I loved as a teen has been pruned down to a multiplayer (its no longer massive, sharding and expansions have made the rest of the game obsolete and feel smaller and smaller), railroaded, time gated, streamlined, zero room for innovation, outfit/mount/reputation collection simulator.
---
The nice part is that with classics release the pservers will have fresh data to base the vanilla experience around. Granted this doesn’t matter if you subscribe to the train of though that blizzard is lying about having all the data from 1.12.
---
Lol, go drink your daily supplement of soy, boy
---
Full on open beta is a bad idea. These 3 day stress tests are the right answer. Let’s people dip toes but doesn’t give them 1-30/40. Sifting through millions of bug reports, most of them being the same would hamper finding actual new bugs and fixing them.
---
Depends on your level of activity. If you try to do any kind of athletic training, I suggest something else, as these sorts of things require nutrition which you aren't getting in this diet. But if you are say playing video games or operating some sort of exo nuclear suit, you should be umm, fine?
---
Disable their chat functionality outside of party chat and I'd be fine with trial accounts.
---
Yeah pretty sure a full can of baked beans would get you close to the RDA.
---
The only true way to recreate Vanilla in all it's keyboard turning, high ping, low render glory. Heck, even stops LFR addons.
---
Truly the hardest core of classic will play on switch. **click**
---
There is a video somewhere that levels a gnome to level 4-5 just by running and delivering "fedex" quests around the starting zones of Gnomes and Humans. I can't find that video :(
---
PvP was bad since Cata came out and it never got good again.
---
"also you can do flips" I believe this was all the convincing you need to use.
---
Dude you left out the best binds there are, Q and E
---
That you. But, you never saw the video I'm talking about?
---
Depends. If you can clear more than twice the mobs per minute that either one of you could have on your lonesome, then its worth it.
---
Its the most mana efficient and easiest way to mass aoe solo brd trash with lvl ~50 without any gear.
---
You obvisouly wont only use the listed spells alone. You start pulling and gathering a group of units with all defensive ability (shields, blink..), in open world you can do this with while mounted. Then circle dance the units into one solid stack of units, keeping them slowed with CoC, you keep distance so you dont get hit and continue. While spaming Arcane Explosions rank 1 you keep CoC on cooldown to perma slow the pack. When clearcasting procs, you build distance and cast highest rank blizzard (which costs a ridiculous amount of mana, which now is free). Repeat.
---
With this technique you even can solo the Crocs in Zul'Gurub.
---
Well shit my office job just got a little more interesting! Thanks!
---
I agree entirely. I think the trilogy had the best music. Every zone had music that felt relevant to the zone, rather than just *shits epic yo*. Like Honor Hold, Crystalsong, and Dragonblight come to mind as excellent expansion pieces. But I think WoD onward got really one dimensional with most of its music, and less tasteful.
---
Yeah that sh\*t is absolutely way overpowered for pve dps.
---
Indeed it's possible. There is a video that exists, that I can't find :(
---
I claimed my spot in a semi hardcore guild months ago. I'm good.

Jim Carrey was wrong about what the most annoying sound in the world is.

Everyone will face more competition regardless if you're one of the layer hoppers or not, just because the layer hoppers are competing for your nodes as well.

Did you get that completionist cape? I never could keep up with the grind long enough.
---
One of the reasons I started playing FFXIV was because I could use a controller. At the time I was getting RSI problems (not anymore thanks to ergonomics), and I was surprised at how well the controller worked.
---
This can be compared to real life. 
---
Oh look at that car that person is driving, they look so cool, I want to look cool too - im going to buy a sweet car like that! 
---
Look at that jacket that person has, so stylish, I want to buy that jacket so I can look stylish too. 
---
And etc, etc. 
---
I try to live my life without comparing myself to others, to blaze my own trail, and to improve myself rather than compare myself to other. This is *extremely hard* to do in WoW because a lot of the function of the game revolves around comparing yourself to other characters. 
---
If you can focus on one, and try to improve that character every day, you will be the person other people will be looking at, wanting to roll your class.
---
The fact that pservers are still packed to the rafters right now shows that classic WoW has staying power. Blizz are big boys and have done a business case for this. They wouldn't have put in the development effort if they didn't have confidence in its success.
---
What's your world rank for Jaina? I never see other retail raiders on this sub!

Equipping the shard of afrasa gives you a rejuvenate animation.

Not sure if it would be worth using to bait purges.

"Manhole"
---
warlocks are trash. very boring to level and very boring to pvp with. You dot and wait. None of your damage does any sort of burst like shamans.
---
Well we will see how well that freaking out works then. If freaking out is a good way to communicate and actually effective by the amount of it there wont be layering at all in Classic. RemindMe 69 days "check effects of freaking out"
---
They gave us Gnomish Engineering how bad could they be?
---
Oh yes it is, there is nothing good in it, they deliberately add micronutrients because otherwise it's just a carbs bomb.
---
I don’t think there is too much to offer - I’ll hang around for BGs or quit and rejoin for bgs, when they come out.
---
But I’ve always found raids, forming guilds (for them to fall through due to bad leadership) very frustrating and insipid.
---
Raiding in classic sounds like more of a bore than retail. Too basic of fights, and dungeons are just faceroll levels of stupid. 
---
Just my opinion - some people like it - but I can’t stand guild drama anymore - 12 years and almost a guild breaking up each year is too much.
---
&gt; You are unable to Polymorph enemy targets that are tapped by players with whom you are not grouped.

Well look at that!

Thanks for the source! Apologies for not checking the list beforehand.

A few weeks meant a year when ion said it in legion about flying so it's a scary concept.

What I'm saying is people will not play what they really want to, in favor of something else just because of rumor, and opinions on "limitations" that are in reality pretty subjective. Can't expect all the thick skull bois to fully understand

---
It really comes down to how like-able each of us is a as a player. A person that is enjoyable and moderately competent will get the chance to raid, maybe not get priority, but the eventual chance is there especially once a raid is on farm for the guild. On the flip side, you have try-hards that are down right toxic and they will struggle to get invited despite being the right spec or super meta.
---
If you're in a group that doesnt have a rogue and theres a locked chest is it okay to blow it open and take it for yourself if you're an engineer with bombs?
---
Always wondered that
---
As long as well agree hunter and druid are terrible choices. lol
---
Won't lie, it would probably get me to buy a switch.
---
If you want warrior to be your main then it’s more valuable time-wise to just go for it imo. The speed increase of AH gear isn’t worth the hundreds of hours spent on levelling another toon. Nor is the farming potential of that other toon (which doesn’t pay off for a long time) since you could’ve spent those hundreds of hours just farming months worth of gold on your warrior.
---
Also the opportunity cost of missing weeks of raiding on your warrior.
---
I mean, maybe if you really can’t stand warrior levelling? But being covered in greens and blues doesn’t even fix your fundamental problems of lacking heals, escapes, range, useful cooldowns etc.
---
warrior or rogue? I can't tell lmao
---
Thanks for the feedback.
---
On Talbar Mantle, Arena Grand Master and Fishing Hat, looks like there's some bad data on required level that will need to be fixed.
---
For random enchants, there is an option to show them if you click the filter icon in the top right corner of the item selection panel and check "Random".
---
Cant have burger, it's derogatory against Americans.
---
Marking like that wasn't in vanilla though
---
Love the meme, but I always see hate for Gnomes. I’m for the Horde as much as the next Troll... but I don’t hate Gnomes outright. Now if I see a human paladin walking around... imma commit a hate crime.
---
"Can i get a portal/water/food, what do you care it's free for you, you scumbag mage"
---
Yes i do, and it's my main thing that is going to get me through waiting for classic.
---
I mean BGs aren't out till later phases so why not go for the dal combo?
---
Pretty much me minus the whole having someone that actually wants to sleep with me thing
---
Seeing this makes me wonder if something like Stadia will be successful, and if so, if that's how MMOs might start moving. Being able to run the game through a browser from any device sounds pretty futuristic and awesome.
---
Randall from Monsters Inc. is exactly what Rogues are: slimey rats
---
Congratulations, we will all be there when you get time. Gank away when you have time!!!
---
I leveled as elemental on a private server. Made me never want to play shaman again.
---
Four shoulder trigger buttons could be used to separate the spells.
---
So, A button is attack one. L+A is attack two etc.
---
This way you could have 24 spells or abilities and the switch has four more buttons on the left stick so you could have even more.
---
I approve.
---
However, I do want to note that any alliance can catch these blades. They take no reservations.
---
It took a while, but I’ve come to enjoy a lack of summon stones. In BC/Wrath’s first half, I was always one of the 2 people running so it didn’t change much, most of the time. And when the other 3 did get summoned, one of them was more likely to quit after the second wipe. They didn’t go through the process of traveling to get there, so they’re less invested. 
---
Meanwhile, if you spend 30 minutes crossing continents and flying/running, you’d be wasting your own time leaving after 2 wipes. So, while I normally end up having to run to the stone anyways, not having them doesn’t change much for me. They also act as a “laziness barrier of entry” for people, or a laziness check.
---
I’ll do all the dungeons, and I’ll do BGs for the first month they are out.
---
I don’t think it is that depressing.
---
I think it’ll be more depressing to be in 2020 doing the exact same thing I did in 2006.
---
Just feels like a waste of time for a few virtual rewards.
---
Get the dopamine from killing real players And then Leave.
---
They certainly are not one trick ponies. You can choose to either bubble hearth or divine intervention the tank
---
Dont forget that people in this sub are generally more “serious” about the game. Most casuals aren’t discussing in topics about which class is best etc etc
---
This sub is a niche - an elite group of players and 100% not your average classic player. 
---
Same with OSRS. There’s a big difference between the min-maxers on the subreddit and the general population that just plays.
---
No I am right. Spelladin wants spell power items like Nelthalrions Tear
---
Woohooo *happy arm movements*
---
Hi right. spelladin wants spell power items like nelthalrions tear, I'm dad.
---
You can make quest text instant in classic (which doesn't even require an addon).  Other than that, I agree 100%.

should I go warrior or Shaman?
---
Im a bit worried that there will be millions of warriors
---
Blizz wanted to add titles to vanilla WoW, which meant they didn't want to have titles in player names. They wanted you to have to work hard to be "Lord Joe" rather than just name your character "Lordjoe" or end up as "Captain Lordjoe".
---
They added a few titles with PvP ranks, but iirc the original plan was more extensive.
---
Dual spec/ low penalty respeccing. The only feature I would add is this.
---
&gt;available to all
---
But not EU players... and you have to have an active sub... not quite all.
---
Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker you say?

Nobody says druid is the worst tank

**Descent - PvP/PvE - Semi Hardcore - EU**  
---
**Website:** [http://www.descent-guild.com/](http://www.descent-guild.com/) drop a message on the application forum indicating you would like to join us, privelage will be granted to the forums giving access to VoIP.
---
**About Descent:**
---
Established on Nostalrius as an Alliance guild, and clearing MC and BWL (MC down to an hour). Descent is a guild which focus' on both PvE and PvP, clearing PvE content will be done in a timely manner 2-4 Raid nights per week dependant on current content and progression requirements. Descent is run by a team of people who have been playing together since actual classic, and have run several guilds between Vanilla-WoD. We cleared AQ40 including C'thun and got as far as Kel'Thuzad in Naxx when current. We are looking for players who are willing to be a part of a community, and each individuals capabilities will be taken into consideration, whether playing 10hours or 40hours a week, there is something to be gained for you in Descent. Prioritize personality over elitism.
---
We have no restrictions other than English speaking, and having access to a microphone. Our raid days are yet to be established, this will be done closer to the time dependent on what the guild members are wanting to do. Raid times will be 7pm-11(12)pm server time. Requirements for consumables will not be as strict as 'hardcore' guilds, nor will world buffs. We are aware of them, and how to use them, however why waste 40 peoples time for something that is not required, things like this may be used later for speed running content.  
---
**Early Plans:**
---
Currently we use Teamspeak3 due to reduced system requirements, lack of personal privacy with Discord, and a bit of Nostalgia. However with the hype of Discord we will likely run both or transition to Discord at some point. The guild website will remain active and maintained, and will be the primary hub of communication for the guild.
---
A few of us will be powering from 1-60 in the first 1-3 weeks, the rest will take their time. The initial group to 60 will be working on UBRS keys and other guild favorable tasks(such as Thorium Brotherhood Rep). It is likely that by month 2 we will begin doing MC either as part of an alliance, or bringing in pug groups. By month 3 it is expected that the guild will be raiding in house and beginning to make serious progress in MC, preparing for BWL.
---
I'm good though, I kinda dig having to read it.
---
Caught between enh sham or frost mage. There really isn’t a third for me. Someone help
---
I hope one of the mages or druids have dispel curse on their bar.
---
They want it to be shorter because it’s so boring a. Being so easy you can’t run out of health or resource if you try, b. No gear upgrades because heirlooms, c. No random drops that could make you a surprise meaningful amount of gold, and d. Very little social interaction 
---
I found myself wishing it was faster too when I leveled 1-120 at the start of BFA but I really just wanted to play the game because it starts at max.
---
Well a melee overgearing you is always a problem if your not a mage. Bit if you keep urself on-par with gear its gonna be no problem. I ran with r8 gear and couple blues + epics from Mc and did absolutely fine. Im still depating between disc priest and a shaman, but leaning towards a priest very strongly!
---
Just curious for anyone who played in the last stress test --- did that one get extended for more days that originally scheduled? Was wondering if there is any chance they may accidentally the servers up through the weekend past the formally announced three days.
---
Right, we're talking about vanilla.
---
Yes but those are the slots all casters also compete/ overlap for. Everyone wants a nelthalrions tear, a ToEP, etc.
---
This more applies to me in TBC, but it could have applied in Vanilla.  After going into several battlegrounds on my characters at 19, 29, 39, etc., I realized that there were enough high-geared 19s that if I joined the battle, I would be countering them.  It was fun to gank the undergeared plebs in WSG, but it was also just as fun to fight against another rogue with 1700 HP.
---
Stormdrain sounds like a Gnome warrior.
---
AQ 40 wasn’t bad but AQ20 was ugh.
---
&gt;  very boring to level and very boring to pvp with. 
---
Couldn't be further from the truth my dude, and good luck raiding as an ele shaman
---
I don’t think doing every faction quest even gets you half the rep.
---
Still haven't seen anything and we are mid June
---
Top tier shit post.
---
Or you can actually play the game like the rest of us instead of being so self-entitled.
---
It'd probably be okay for questing. Honestly, I did play Global Agenda with a controller for a period of time when I was getting repetitive strain injury in my wrist and it actually worked pretty well for PvE (PvP was a different beast since the game had an aiming component to it). Classic WoW, especially with a touch screen on the device, seems totally viable for grinding or for lower level dungeons. 
---
@ Switch haters - I sometimes forget that a lot of people online on poor, and of course poor people hate other people have more fun than them.
---
Botters were/are trash players.  I fully support banning every single one of them.
---
Thanks! Ya, I definitely am hearing the feedback on folks wanting some set building options without registering. I have nothing against this and would love to add some functionality along these lines, I just haven't done the work yet.
---
My advice: If you plan on playing casual and not min-max'ing I wouldn't worry too much about the "pros and cons" of each class. You're going to be just fine playing in whatever fashion you like.
---
However, if you think that down the road you may decide to get a little more serious you'll want to consider this information, but again, both classes will be fine. Hunter falls off after T2.5, but very few people actuall have to worry about that.
---
I don't think anybody is going to dispute that Rogue is the better class in Classic, especially for wpvp.
---
But rogues are also very overplayed, and youll likely have a harder time getting gear and spots in raids as a rogue.
---
Picture = yes.
---
Text = no.
---
What do people not understand about that?
---
The 3 most popular vanilla classes lol
---
I agree, this is a scam.
---
You can raid as mage too. Just conjure food/water and spam frostbolt
---
They do most of the time unless they say really weird stuff.
---
I typically go 11 in holy for conc, then 7 in ret for imp judgement and 15% mana reduction which gives me lots of flexability, but i then find i need to hit up prot for some suvivability and imp righteous fury else impatient dps run away with threat
---
I also quit after about a month. The fact that the tier armor that I spent hundreds of hours obtaining was replaced halfway through leveling with trash greens made me feel really disheartened. I felt like I had invested a ton of time into building something that became worthless and I just couldn’t accept the feeling of starting over. 
---
Also got a girlfriend.

If you had left it at ‘that 23k would have been nice’ you would have instantly achieved legend status 😂😂 on a more serious note, congrats! Though you are a victim of your own success..
---
You should get a PiHole, it's great. Also consider something like LastPass instead of the built-in Chrome password manager. That way, it's portable (avoiding locking you to a browser).
---
Thats right, that hurt
---
We still fillin' them tanks with alliance screams though.
---
traps, huntersmark, flare, pet and more not only 3 things
---
And instead of responding the coward just downvotes me. Classic.
---
*laughs in keto*
---
*laughter fades quickly to crying*
---
It does feel smooth, but part of my love for classic is that it is clunky. Sometimes you can outplay a situation, but a lot of the time you are at the mercy of the mechanics of the game. This provides a challenge that is different from mechanical challenge. I like that I dont have an answer to everything in vanilla. I also much prefer  the old run animations.
---
Somewhere along the line I got PTSD from them opening up on my priest. “What the hells attacking m... oh there the little bastard!!”.  
---
Vengeance is a dish best served... Cold..
---
Just YouTube “human exploration route classic” or whatever race you’re looking for
---
totally agree, takes time to get that bigger picture, when early on when im concentrating on doing the right thing positioning defo suffers
---
Carbs aren't inherently bad. Now say it with me: *carbs aren't inherently bad*
---
But not classic Wow, wondered how moving so fast.
---
Hahahahahahaha
---
I can respect that, I usually play with people I know though or pick up guildies so Im not as worried about people pulling threat. Also idk if you know this or not, but you can buff your allies in combat to pull a little extra threat
---
I wouldnt say packed. It seems they just keep a good flow of new players as, for example, I’ve played on them and started playing again when they announced the countdown. Almost all the people I’ve made friends leveling with have already quit lol.. Only see two of them play now. Same thing happened when I played TBC pservers pretty much everyone drops out
---
please FUCK I need it
---
Wait huh? Kill luci mag and gehennas and then jump to where? Garr is right next to Gehennas so where would you jump?
---
If you want to be a troll sure. Pallys have quite a bit of useful utility. Especially if you roll Holy.
---
&gt; It's the only option for alliance players who don't want to be ~~tiny~~ **ridiculous**. 
---
FTFY :o
---
Full beta or gtfo
---
If you use the spirit healer in another zone itll rez you at the same one you spawned at. I found that out the hard way a long time ago
---
Wpvp and bgs = go rogue - doesn't matter what race.
---
Stealing in this case would refer to a melee obviously running towards a mob and is real close to it and a hunter for example hits it first. Tough luck, but if I see this I wouldn't be like the hunter.
---
Oh, is this only a 24 hour beta?
---
I mean, I still have to read it.  But I can read faster than it scrawls, and then I just get annoyed.
---
Kind of like in Live, when you get an unskippable cutscene.
---
He looks smug.
---
This is what ‘The End’ looks like for me.
---
Just making videos for classic dungeons for anyone who needs help when classic comes out, the dungeons are probably different so I’m probably going to have to change it.
---
Hey other people play like me?
---
yeh i did thanks, i think one buff (i forget which) worked best. I seem to remember keeping rank 1 of it on my bars for this exact reason as the threat gain was the same for low mana cost, but i may be wrong
---
Was in one of the 2 guilds in vanilla that cleared Naxx back in the day.
---
I was one of the 3 hunters in rotation, we'd always bring 2. We were top 5 dps for about 80% of the boss fights including Patchwerk, the mother of all dps checks, so if hunters didn't scale our server, Gorefiend, must've been broken :)
---
Pets don't scale and so BM wouldn't keep up. MM and SV scaled just fine.
---
Warlock. They have the longest ramp-up power-wise, and become absolutely disgusting past AQ release if you raid for gear, which you should.  
---
Either that or mage, elemental mages become insane as well.
---
Yeh so much better to be one of the billion humans.
---
Priest or mage. Mage can make money in end game w aoe farm. Holy priest is always in high demand.
---
48 Hour, but my sub will expire half way though.
---
Nah. What with the modern TOS and all, we can have nearly-legit Vanilla gameplay *without* the annoyance of bots. It'll be like Vanilla was, but *even better*. :P
---
direction + button (+another button) gives you quite a lot of abilities
---
ex:
---
a,
---

---
right+a,
---
up+a,
---
down+a,
---
ab,
---

---
etc
---
Wand my guy
---
Well, they can, but it’s a huge grind you have to do that’s really not worth it most of the time
---
Yeah but wowglider wasnt shut down during vanilla so it should be unsued cus blizzards goal is an authentic vanilla experience, u ppl who want changes are gonna ruin classic
---
It's a stress test, and I remember finally getting in during the last one and having to remind everyone complaining that the entire purpose is to see the limit before breaking the server. It isn't going to just be the first 3 hours, there will be constant dc's throughout several days. I think it was Kalimdore specific that you had rolling dc's every 3-5 minutes, and sometimes within 30 seconds for hours after people were supposed to be able to play without issue. I'm glad they had the issue at that time instead of at launch. This is why we will all hit our heads against the wall en masse so it doesn't break when it matters.
---
Staysafe has a “guide” to getting it by 40, it’s one of the worst YouTube videos ever created

Ah, I need to go find a blue post. I wonder if I got in.

---
Tanks make the groups far more often and they don’t really give nearly as much shit about rogues as they do fury. DPS warriors are your biggest gear competition in 5/10 man content as a tank, and a ninja risk for blatant tank gear like shields.
---
Source: am tank who says “sorry full” to every dps warrior who whispers me, after too many bad loot experiences
---
I guess the answer is to layer hop to even the odds. However each hop will require assistance from someone who you know isn't in your layer and who doesn't want to farm the same thing as you. I don't think it's going to be so easy that it becomes an issue.
---
They're not #1 but they're like third most popular still
---
Spirits be with ya mon!
---
I'm sure I'll figure out a way to hook a keyboard and mouse up to that and pwn all the joystick turning noobs!
---
If ur going rogue surely you should go Dwarf and avoid Night elf completely since they bring nothing to the table?
---
Going to be fun committing a horde genocide on my gnome rogue.
---
You could always give a free trial a lvl 10, 1g, and no chat channels or mail restrictions.
---
AP scaling for evis just gave it an AP buff, it didn't affect the base damage. 
---
You brought up WoR, and I'm just saying that even in 1.12 a CB/Prep rogue can do the same things, that you can only do it once every 10 minutes is a caveat, doesn't change the fact that even in 1.12 a naked rogue can do.
---
Even in 1.12 Rogues have very few shared DRs, that point is mute.
---
Better graphics, Duel specs.
---
*sTrEnGtHs aNd wEaKnEsSeS tHo*
---
Nope, would be interested in it thought. So please post it here if you happen to find it again.
---
 It’s not toxic - it is the type of server you are playing.
---
If you view it as toxic - then move to a PvE realm. 
---
Camping is an unfortunate pain - but it is usually due to you competing with someone at a farming spot.
---
90% of the time there is a reason someone is camping you.
---
They may be waiting for a rare spawn, chest, or clearing the way for their alt in that zone by scaring off competition - or at least letting people know there is a higher level around. 
---
The other 10% is boredom or frustration.
---
Waiting for someone to go to a node and then stunning or cc and stealing it in front of them.
---
Fair enough - but they were going to take it anyway - just accept you’ve got a life and don’t need to validate yourself with cheap tricks.
---
Phasing, sharding, layering. Its all the same. Your character gets ported to an alternate reality, no matter what blizzard wants to call it.
---
No, I doubt it. The past few tests have gone down as scheduled.
---
Its a daily struggle.
---
Which is like saying, "snake venom being injected into your body isn't inherently bad" 
---
You're technically correct, but there's a lot more information missing.
---
I've never experienced or encountered an MMORPG that gave me the same feeling as WoW did and I did try a lot of them. I can't pinpoint the exact reason behind it.
---
I don't remember ever seeing the dead bodies thing in vanilla, but I saw it a lot in Wrath.
---
Slippery slope
---
Yes cause fighting someone your own level is out of the question. Cowards
---
Username checks out
---
Or having Prot paladin and Feral druids be able to properly tank. "What would be the downsides of having 3 classes to be able to tank in raids?"... xD
---
I see the guy with the perfect life is still small dicked enough to insult instead of exchange ideas
---
Is that seriously your argument?  Botting was ALWAYS against the ToS.  Go away troll.
---
You usually don't have wand for the first few levels where the bottleneck takes place on launch. Even then, wanding is way slower than a hunters arcane shot for instance. It was a huge pain.
---
&gt;Vathal
---
Yeah its a wierd one, to me 1% dodge is awesome compared to +5 weapon skill with swords, especially when the only sword I can think is worthy of tanking with is Thunderfury. Other than that daggers all the way.
---
Is this a next level troll or are you really serious about this?
---
Not sure why folks are in a rush to get to 60 and raid the worst, most boring raid in the game.  I hated MC farm with a passion, most mind numbing crap ever.
---
It can be interupted and will cause a shadow lockout aswell

bur gerking is alliance for lol jerking

It was against the tos and u could be caught, but at least give botters a fighting chance
---
I asked the same question a few days ago: blacksmithing does not have many good items for holy palas. Sadly :/
---
Like what? Tranq shot? Anything else?
---
So true.
---
I’m leaning towards rogue mainly due to liking melee classes. Any input on racials I like the NE speed increase in stealth and 10sec shadowmeld I know you can’t us it in combat like retail. On the other hand I remember all do the debuffs that lasted 15 to 30 minutes I like the idea of stone skin as a mini CoS. If I remember correctly it gets you out of other rogues blind as well.
---
i want my gold farms to be real people /s
---
CM was such a failed implementation of 5 man progression though. M+ is everything CM wishes it could have been. 
---
There were a couple cool WoD dungeons. Fighting Ner'zhul in Shadowmoon Graveyard was pretty cool. Blackrock Depo and fighting on the train was cool. Hard to compare to Legion though which had so many hits.
---
Absolutely. Selfish bastards hoarding both swords and mace specialization.
---
Scatter shot lasts 4 seconds and has a 30 seconds cooldown though.
---
Not raided much at all in BFA so cant tell if thats true or not, but its fuin when its hard indeed.
---
I worked for him for a couple of months. He's completely reliant on the skills of his carefully chosen partners, which always are immensely skilled, enough to make up for his lack of skills.
---
Even if those players are much better than him, he always blames his team for losing, and even got into a pretty hefty debate with one of them because of that when they tried to climb ranks, but he stubbornly refused to acknowledge his carrying teammates.
---
He doesn't listen to advice even from the best players around, and instead is 100% certain he's smart enough (smarter than anyone else, and he means that unironically btw) to figure out the most optimal solution for everything. Very disrespectful attitude.
---
He also uses a ton of macros in an attempt to reduce his fail decision making, by putting his cds together in a way that allows him to try get through "oh shit" moments without him having to use his "working memory" too much. 
---
It was a meme inhouse that he's the paladin who doesn't bubble, because many times he died because of not bubbling. 
---
He also doesn't call out shit, and completely depends on his teammates to do that for him and figure out wtf he is doing at any point.
---
TL;DR: He picks the best players possible to carry him, but doesn't show them any respect or takes any advice from them. He's trying to get away with fail macros to make up for his lack of skill which even he's aware of (but doesn't admit it directly), and lets his team do all the work while he's refusing to adapt to them to the point where they want to quit playing with him altogether.
---
But it's entertaining and gets views, so ya. Just sucks for everyone involved except him, and he enjoys taking the piss and using anyone for his benefit.
---
Technically going 2h enhancement and kiting with earthbind is mathematically the quickest way to level because it allows for less downtime between mobs because you get hit less.
---
Das racist! :(
---
Hype is still there. Announcement hype was insane... it died down. Blizzcon 2018 hype (at least the classic stuff) was pretty high...it died down. Announcement of release date and subsequent beta was insane...its dying down. It'll peak again dw man :)
---
BFA (or the following expansion) would be far more likely.
---
Totally disagree, warlocks summon are now pretty much useless.
---
It was in 1.12, not? I thought they implemented it with the first raids
---
Im gonna check and edit the comment. Really want to know now when it came.
---
There will be an order of magnitude more fury warriors farming prebis than protection warriors, and many of the items they want will overlap with what I want.
---
So very true!   My first char in vanilla wow was a night elf hunter and I remember being in a low level dungeon and running out of arrows. Good times!
---
Thanks that’s one of my worries about being over populated. I have a feeling that a lot of retail players will start then drop classic due to not being able to steamroll content.
---
im between warlock or rogue or woyer
---
As a holy priest, I usually would stay with a group, but I was asked to go up and check on one of the GY's.
---
As I rounded the top of the hill, I encountered an alliance also mounted.  Not running away, we met eye to eye for several seconds, until he slowly back down the other side of the GY and trotted away.
---
N00b didn't recognize that I wasn't a Shadow Priest;  but dayum, it was good to know that my Devout skirt held up so well!
---
*Have a quillboar nest to burn.
---
it was though. Just not at launch.
---
Mage ...definitely. (Period).   Done.
---
Warlock though ..
---
Cool. I'll have to check that out.
---
I can see what you mean by the actual landscape. I still feel BC was superior to Wrath overall, but the art design in Wrath is arguably the best in any WoW expansion.
---
Because big dick energy sometimes comes in the form of pink plate boots or a teal dress.
---
Yeah hands down. The most advanced thing you have to worry about is maybe fake casting, dispelling if you want to go the extra mile. Even your silence doesn't require timing.
---
Understand what you mean, still gonna stay neutral since I think its much more complex than that.
---
I am so excited!! 
---
*to see the armies of people when their shitty nostalgia is proven false*
---
I dont know why anyone gets upset at others opinions. Its crazy. 
---
I'll be honest, this time, I've 45yrs old, with a Job and Kids. I'll only be able to play 2hrs maybe 3hrs...once the kids are sleeping, and wont be every night. 
---
So for me, this time, I'm going PvE, especially for my first few chars. I might think about leveling an alt on a PvP server after a year or so....but dont fancy the constant ganking and time wasted leveling this time round. (just my own opinion). :D
---
I've played FF14 dungeons with consolers and they were fine. It's likely not the platform that was the problem by the individual players.

\*\*Chocolate Milk\*\*
---
Chocolate Milk is an \*\*EU\*\*-based \*\*Horde PvP\*\* raiding guild eagerly awaiting Classic WoW launch. We were established in 2015 on the private server Nostalrius and are comprised of friends new and old with the desire to be competitive in a semi-hardcore fashion and with a positive atmosphere.
---
On Nostalrius PvE and the subsequent servers after its takedown we were the top Horde guild, claiming all the server firsts Horde side and dominating world bosses for the longest time. We realize a private server is not neccesarily representative of how Classic will be but we aspire to be the same kind of guild we were if not better.
---
\*\*Goals\*\*
---
:small\_blue\_diamond: Raiding endgame content at a competitive level

I mean, just look into premades then. You don't seem poised to lose a lot from the carebare toggle.
---
Yeah who needs a tank anyway
---
Hunter all the way
---
Why not both?
---
Some of the best PvP brawls were started like this!
---
Introduced in patch 1.11. it was around in vanilla
---
Nah if ne looks cooler for him he should go ne
---
Orcs anti stun pvp racial, so is tauren and troll is the best in pve dps, but the alliance racials arent half bad, u can immune rogues blind and remove all poisons and diseases with stoneform and nightelf can shadowmeld if I remembrr correctly, while casting an aimed shot, also useful to eat and stealth. Horde is just superior with racials overall, but paladins are better than shamans and blessing of kings is pretty good on a hunter
---
Lucifron confirmed hardest boss
---
When I tried out the stress test, I was amazed how good the graphics were and was like damn dude
---
Except for world firsts and arena tournament victories.
---
On one hand, being a Horde rogue won't be fun when having to deal with the Perception racial, and being an Alliance warlock won't be fun when playing against Will of the Forsaken racial, buuut anyone who is willing to choose a class based on racial counters probably already has their heart set on a faction.
---
You win an upvote for making me laugh
---
True guildbanks should have been in classic for sure.
---
Only works if you're out of combat.
---
troll gonna troll i guess
---
I plan on remaking my Hunter, but I'm a little bummed that the only way to get the best pet is to camp Badlands for who knows how many dats and fight with other Hunters to get it.
---
What is Youtube? Kappa. wtf...
---
Best explanation I've read by far.
---
Make friends with someone if you dont already have one. Then between the two of you one play a class that can tank while leveling and the other play something that can heal. Insta groups from 1-60 and friendship, whats not to love.
---
Also for the record you dont have to play in prot spec while leveling, you can tank dungeons in vanilla in a dps spec if you keep a shield around (or keep your armor level high if you're druid)
---
That's why I'm asking here... I can't find the video.
---
Gut
---
Reroll?
---
I work in tech so I'm well aware of the high pay scales. But what I calculated is for 40 hours. So if you're part time (let's say 20 hours), that means a pay rate of almost $70/hr. Basically 150k salary (if we extrapolate to full time). For warehouse work? I dont think so. For a fucking internship? I hope not, that's insane.
---
Imagine making a Bobby B meme without Sulfuras in it.
---
Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We were all meant to shine as children do. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others. Sir I just wanna say thank you...you saved my life. .
---
I guarantee you there will be 60's in the first week.  100% guaranteed.  If you push 1-60 time to 5.5 days, you can still sleep 5 hours a night and hit 60 in a week.  Obviously 99% of the player base will not be 60, but you will be seeing more than you think within the first week.
---
Massive buff to tps, which allows dps to play more aggressively without pulling aggro, which results in faster raids and less wipes.
---
It's pretty huge considering that hitchance is the #1 offensive stat for tanks.
---
Dodge isn't bad but not that important. Tps is more often the bottleneck than defense.
---
this guy is either mentally handicapped or a troll as most of his posts are designed to get this kind of response
---
This is not elitism. I am not hating on streamers. Not once was any of this proclaimed in my post. I simply requested for a resource to block or filter out a language that I personally don't enjoy being spammed in my feed. If its not an issue, then its not an issue and I'll continue with my life as normal. Simply requesting for something doesn't automatically make a person a bandwagon anti-streamer.
---
And no, I like my profanity nice and dirty ;)
---
Phasing is actually quite different as it relates to quests. Sharding/layering are the same just different scales. 
---
Phasing is when you further a quest chain and the world changes. You are then phased from people on other parts of the quest where the zone hasn’t changed.
---
I'm 100% Horde, but if I was Alliance I would 100% play Paladin.  
---
I love vanilla pally so much. Think I'm going druid tho
---
Wait isnt friendlist characterbound in retail? I had no damn idea, hahahahaha.
---
NA PVP Horde evenings/nights or weekends - Hello! I am considering rolling a warrior tank (tanked before in vanilla, bc, cata, then again on private servers in vanilla and bc). I am open to either joining a guild or creating one with a core group (have a few friends that will probably roll where I do and would be open to either me starting a guild or joining with me). I have no problem making raids in a set raid schedule, and would like to hear from anyone who thinks there may be a great opportunity. Thanks
---
Mitigating damage isn't really an issue if your healers are any good, most tanks/raids are bottle necked by the amount of threat the tank can put out. Weapon skill lets you generate more threat, which lets your dps do more damage, which means bosses die quicker so less chance your healers run out of mana or people make mistakes and you wipe.
---
I know
---
&gt; but unless you're multitasking and pulling multiple mobs at once and switching aggro between your pet and yourself, this talent will only benefit either you, or your pet and basically halves its healing.
---
So the talent is only good if you're not awful at the game? Shocker!
---
Here's another tip, with very few exceptions bm talents are also useless if you don't tame a pet.
---
&gt; econds out of combat regen on your pet is worth at least ten times the amount of healing this talent brings.
---
And you should rarely ever be out of combat, so I fail to see the point.
---
&gt;  And since when do hunters have any downtime ?
---
Fair enough, let me change it to sustain, is it better now?
---
&gt; If you read it all and still think this talent is worth anything, congrats you're one of the the reasons people call hunters huntards
---
The fact that you even entertain the thought that it's possible to be full health while leveling pretty much shows that you are the reason people refer to hunters as huntards.
---
This. Vanilla wasn't perfect and no one claimed it was. Some classes and specs clearly had issues, but it is what it is. You either deal with it or play another class/spec.
---
If people want "balanced" cookie-cutter classes and specs I suggest sticking to Retail.
---
Tanking is a whole new world in classic. Im sure you will get plenty of good advice down this thread however you should check out Skarms youtube channel. He is a tank!
---
Lvling is boring..you only are efficient with frost..then all you do is Frostbolt, Frostbolt, Nova, Blink, Frostbolt, Drink - repeat..if you go fire you are oom after one mob
---
Yeah it was a Wrath thing but that’s when the 20 trials thing started I think.
---
I wonder if it's too late to sub. I would hate to shell out 15 bucks and then be left out of the stress test because they already figured out what accounts are "active" to give access.
---
You'll have to find a sleeping peon, first.
---
There'll probably be plenty of animals, Quillboar, harpies, and Venture Co. to kill in Mulgore, though.
---
This is objectively wrong.
---
I didn't play one, but I'm pretty sure it's Shadow Priest.  Your "Oh shit" buttons are straightforward and on fairly low cooldowns and you have instant, AoE CC.  Your DPS abilities are also pretty powerful, and their mana inefficiency doesn't matter as much in PvP.  There are other classes that are on the easier side and potentially better, but they require practice kiting or micromanaging pet AI.
---
Vanilla PvP in general is pretty rock-paper-scissors though, so expect some matchups to be difficult no matter what you pick.
---
The world record is 4 days and 20 hours in /played time. In real time it took much longer.

**&lt;Completion&gt;** Horde | East Coast NA | PvP | Semi-Hardcore
---
Sixty iterations off the central finite curve, there's a semi-hardcore guild named &lt;Completion&gt; that will dominate world PvP, raid Tuesday/Thursday 8-11pm, and create a family like community. Our discord has collections of all of the top class guides, profession guides, and BiS lists. Come home to the impossible guild of your own completion.
---
**Who are we?**  
---
Our guild is run by experienced and skilled players that have played since 2004-2006. Our raid leaders have raided in vanilla through Naxx, and have raided through Naxx on private servers. Others have achieved PvP ranks ranging from Rival to Gladiator on retail, and raided at a mythic level with exceptional parses. In short, we raid to gear for PvP. We are looking to min/max our characters at a relaxed pace to dominate all aspects of PvP and PvE and have a blast doing it.
---
**Who are we looking for?**  
---
We are looking for more like-minded players with character min/maxing aspirations with a passion for PvP and raiding to join our ranks and fill out our 40+ man roster. We currently have a core opening for a **Mage**, though we are accepting exceptional players for all classes. We expect our raiders to have extensive knowledge of their class and their role. We are also accepting any casual players looking for an active community.
---
**What will we be doing?**  
---
We will be raiding Tuesday/Thursday, 8-11 EST and will use a 25% weekly decay DKP system for loot. There will likely be a 3rd optional day added in the future during BWL progression and onwards. We also will be doing many world PvP events and PvP raids, as well as an extensive amount of premade BGs. We will make a valiant attempt at rank 14 without killing ourselves in the process. Also, we will have other weekly community events such as dueling tournaments, "where is X" events, and weekly bounties against certain Alliance players, all with gold prizes.

Just looked up the article. Sweet! Thanks.

Can you give some tips on 1H Enh? Currently using windfury on Arcanite Reaper, and while it can be fun, I just go for big chunks (auto attack + stormstrike + earth shock). I assume you use a shield.
---
Okay, lol.
---
\+1 = indeed 
---
was what I meant:)
---
What does this have to do with what he is saying?  I'm not pro-summit or really pro-streamer but honestly this is sort of a piss poor shot at the message he is trying to give.
---
That would be great!

I really like the mythic keystone system. I don't know how you could really make it work with the style of MMO that Classic is, but it would be cool to see some keystone style of dungeon scaling difficulty if they ever do 1.14.
---
So, mages are best at serving vengeance dishes, then?
---
everything about combat rogues, i absolutely hate all the swish swish swish shit.   
---
imo the gameplay will be the biggest thing to look forward to you're so much less consistent in your damaging abilities but are rewarded fairly when you get your crits, ele shaman died with lava burst imo even vanilla ele was more fun than lava burst.
---
Mage - they have it all. Utility, damage, wpvp/group pvp. I love them so much I mained one from TBC to now...
---
What stops me from picking it as a main in Classic?... They aren't priests.
---
Mained priest in vanilla, getting a rep on your server as being a good healer means you will literally never play the game solo if you don't want to. People will beg you to join their groups, you'll always have people willing to help you out with farming or difficult quests. Also, Benediction is the best thing ever.
---
Adults don't look like children. You're the one making the argument that looks don't matter, only the age.
---
Right after you enter MC....
---
Doesnt flame do less damage than frost, even on a 2H? Plus frostbrand has slow on hit for sweet kiting.
---
Except that you get no rage from a dodged hit, so its actually bad on all fights where you need to dps race.
---
Some people will do it, but I think you under-estimate how many people 1% of the playerbase is.
---
This. All these dk or pallys talking about high raitings in wotlk are funny to me. Shit was crazy unbalanced, anyone saying different wasnt paying attention...
---
True, but i love aoe grinding!
---
It's the party and work console for me. Mario Kart, Mario Party, Overcooked, etc. for when friends or family come over. Then Zelda and other single player games to play while traveling on planes and being bored in a hotel.
---
&gt; A modicum of effort is to be expected 
---
So where did you leave yours?
---
Rogue is an awesome class in classic, though so is a hunter. Rogues can pick their fights and gank players in BGs, who think they are safe. They can assault bases in AV/AB and are ok at flag carrying in WSG due to sprint (and speed pots) :D
---
Hunters have great burst DPS, and normally...most of the time....there are others fighting in front of you, so you can do great burst DPS on targets not targeting you. 
---
Good thing about a hunter is they are fast to level with little down time, due to the pet. As a casual player, you'll easily quest and grind your way to 60 without needing much help.  
---
Also, if you are a very casual, hunters can farm great gold when you need it too.
---
Not chill bro, warlocks have great burst especially with conflag. give em a shot because you clearly haven't played em.
---
LOL. That is preraid bis not raid gear but yes you want prebis items that warriors want like bracers and HoJ and you want prebis items that healers and casters want like Briarwood reed. Just like I said...
---
Way to seemingly miss the entire last statement in my post, you know, the one that states I wouldn't take problem if they added the new models. Like shit, Not sure how you miscomprehended me so hard. 
---
(Also, good job making a statement that doesn't provide benefit to -anyone-)
---
I'm honestly wondering, everything okay? Last time I got something like this on reddit, the guy just had a rough day and took things the wrong way. You alright?
---
Is it too late to subscribe, or will I just be throwing $$ away. Would hate to activate my account, and they have already decided what accounts are "active" for the stress test.

---
Been that way for 15 years.
---
/invite &lt;Friend&gt;
---
Now we are not worrying about layers, too. It's not like choosing which subserver that will merge into the same big server doesn't add overhead.
---
If by "slippery slope" you mean "not in violation of the ToS" and "only active during Vanilla because the lawsuit hadn't gone through yet anyway," then yes.
---
Botting is against the ToS. Botting *was* against the ToS. Botting will always be against the ToS. They aren't going to "unsue" someone or allow them to again illegally profit by selling exploit software just to assuage some internet troll trying to piggyback their hopes that botting won't get you banned on the #NoChanges bandwagon.
---
Sorry, chum. No botting. Go play your garbage, hands-free, auto-leveling, idle freemium mobile games and leave the actual RPGs to the rest of us.
---
Did it feel good to leave this comment lol.
---
Thanks! You are the best :) I wish you an amazing latency, outstanding drop and huge crits :)
---
You know, one the one hand I think the naysayers just don't want to "give up" on their characters they invested the last 14 years into and set it aside for classic. Not realizing both can perfectly co-exist.
---
How to properly pull and kite maybe? your skills are more then yours actionbars
---
Maybe this?  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yH3DCga2cys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yH3DCga2cys)
---
Sorry I’m just now seeing this! When you’re using those abilities, how close are the mobs levels to yours? How many are you pulling? Does CoC slow them enough to keep them off of you? 
---
If you found a way to AOE farm without improved blizzard I’m all ears!
---
[deleted]
---
Yes and No. You want to get hit to generate rage. If you get a few lucky dodges in a row you can end up rage starved.
---
Have you ever been on slow release morphine, you will shit a literal fire hardened red brick.

Try rushing something like that and you'll be goatse boy for life.

I would say rogue, you fight mostly on your conditions unless you get caught. You can pull off having same spec for pvp and pve if you do not have an uptight (high end) raiding group/guild. Rogues may seem a bit complex but while leveling you should learn the nice tricks they have.

I can think of 2 fights that do kiting. Seems quite niche honestly.
---
We cleared shit up to and including aq40 without any real use of consumables, no real usage of meta specs, and with 10-15 literal potatoes in the raid.
---
On top of that, we were fucking bad at the game. If you don’t think you can clear basically everything but naxx with whatever spec you want, you have no idea what you’re talking about.

&gt; Has there been any indication whether or not Blizzard will attempt to change that?

They have promised us this wont change, whether or not you're willing to take blizzard on their word is a different talk.
---
&gt;First things first lets go quest, roll up on the quest giver, oh wait I can't immediately grab the quest, it's writing it out as a note, I've got to read it, then I can accept it. Well lets go kill some boars, but where (no blue ring) checks quest "North East of the Den" checks map, heads to boars.

Joana plays basically entirely solo. From what I read in a different post, people who are planning to get to 60 first are going to make it a team effort by doing things like providing summons and portals and gold to the ones getting to 60. Should speed up the process a decent amount.
---
this is all great for leveling, but you don't need this stuff in bg's or raids
---
If there is an army of Dwarf Priests, that's good right? That means in a given raid there should be plenty of them to cast fear ward, allowing lots of room for non-dwarf priests to be there without losing out on value
---
ME NOT THAT KIND OF ORC!
---
Cos some of us have guilds that want to win the races?
---
Lifetap, mana potion, runes... those are all solutions but they are all objectively worse than not having to do anything at all like with regular mounts. And besides this you can be interrupted and you get locked out of shadow spells and cant even properly fight back whoever interrupted you.
---
Have fun with that quest on launch day

Vanilla had dynamic respawning, it's a bug that it's not in the Beta: https://clips.twitch.tv/TolerantRespectfulHerbsKappaPride

And Classic has faster respawns of named mobs, quest items, and escort NPCs than all the big Pservers.

This is pure nonsense thing to be worrying about. I played a hunter back in Vanilla, and while we didnt clear naxx before tBC, we killed a lot of bosses. We used to always take 3-4 hunters, in our guild, as we were good players. 
---
If you have been with a guild through MC, BWL, ZG &amp; AQ40, and you show that you are a good player, who knows their class, has their own consumables (ie food buffs, elixers, flasks, pots), and you show up on time, you are a respectful player, who helps guild mates and isnt a drama queen.....then you'll easily be raiding Naxx.
---
Man you're right. Wow my memory sucks
---
Wow haven’t seen that for weeks now.
---
In beta, rep gains from questing are roughly half of what they are on pservers or post-TBC retail. If you do all of the Darnassus quests, you'll still need some cloth/soil/morrowgrain to hit exalted.
---
Jesus fucking christ enough with the circlejerk already.

Since WoW is free, can we just make an American account and sub there?

Well 1% dodge is nice until you get a few dodges back to back and you're now rage starved.
---
Also, if you roll human that +5 weapon skill means when using swords to tank you can equip any gloves you want.

On a NE Warrior you're forced to wear the gloves that give weapon skill even all the way up to Naxx.

Also, the fact the world pvp and pvp in general aside small scale arena bs was made second class to raids.

No this such a bad analogy that you shouldn't even have made it. Carbs are the thing your body needs most to function properly, snake venom is purely negative. That said too much carbs will make you fat and food high on carbs and/or fat is often not very healthy because people with a sober diet often reach their carb goals already.
---
You can have it. Just buy a GPD win 2 handheld computer, it runs world of Warcraft very well. Even the original, which I have, runs it decently well in the old zones. Console port addon works great.

It’s been widely discussed that if they choose to do this they would probably make a new TBC server and I think the best way to appeal to people is have the option to transfer your 60 from classic to TBC realm and also possibly have a complete fresh start TBC server, but I think just option to transfer is enough.
---

inb4 _fukken clicker noob_
---
&gt; What make you most envious of other classes?
---
Those green swords from ZG and Zinrokh, Destroyer of Worlds.
---
&gt; What stops you from maining that class?
---
Already had a main and didn't have the attention span to grind back to 60.
---
An order of magnitude is a clear exaggeration. 
---
There will be more, yes, but the ones who can’t or won’t tank are far less likely to be forming their own groups. They likely lack the dungeon knowledge or confidence. The FOTM/first-time furies will be tagging along on other people’s groups.
---
Ofc the knowledgable fury tanks will be your biggest threat. You’ll still find groups just fine, though, every other rogue who ever farmed dal’rends made it through and so will you.
---
Not saying to add it now, it should have been in the game on 2004. Other mmos at the time had ways to edit your appearance.
---
Part of me really wants to play warrior but part of me also really wants to play warlock and will really miss the ease of a lock's solo play if I go warrior.
---
There will be.  Still no tanks and LFG channel will be "LF tank blah blah instance."
---
Everyone wants to be a warrior and nobody wants to tank.
---
It's kind of nice for raiders, too, given that AQ40 sets are locked behind reputation gates, and the AQ40 ring scales all the way up to Exalted.
---
Lot of people ITT saying they don't twink to crush normal leveling players with ease. I'm gunna come out and be the honest one here, I twinked and will twink to crush normal leveling players with ease
---
Telling the tank he's useless rofl
---
Great Art/Design of environment and complimented with great Music. More raid mechanics, Quality of Life changes such as LFG and Raid Finder, Flying mounts to accomodate for bigger zones with a lot more dynamics (floating areas, etc. Netherstorm for example). 
---
On the other hand I didn't like cross realm zones, pet battles and all other micro transactions for mounts, race changes, character level boosts. They made the game cluttered with a bunch of features just to appeal to a bigger audience or at least that's how it feels.
---
While I totally understand what it is you're saying, and I myself am not really into the above casual experience, I just can't bring myself to worry about the Casual player, we worried about them in the past and we're at BFA. Visually stunning game, horrendous MMORPG.
---
Great time to run a stress test.
---
At 2pm in the afternoon at the direct middle of a work week.
---
Are ret pals any good i mean if esfand can i can, right?
---
I love leveling. In Classic, I had a hunter main, and a resto shammy, which I played/raided/PvP'd with. But I was also an altaholic. I leveled a Priest, Rogue, warrior, druid &amp; pally all to level 60.....but didnt play any of them a day past 60. They are all still in their quest rewards gear. 
---
I enjoyed questing the most. 
---
Cant wait to get back doing that again when classic is released. (without worrying about an expansion in 2yrs time).
---
&gt;It's the only option for alliance players who don't want to be ~~tiny~~ **ridiculously AWESOME**.
---
there we go that's better.
---
&gt;Because a pending 2 minutes in between packs drinking because /oom was very fun.
---
In hindsight, yes. It made every fight mean more. This is supposed to be an mmo afterall.
---
Just roll any healer but priest. Problem solved! (and healing superiority decreased).
---
Are those fights even in Naxx?
---
Nah man, you can do the math and Nelf is the worst possible choice for an alliance druid.
---
Going back to my roots of undead warrior
---
duh of course you can't you dunce.
---
*Want* it to fail? Not really.
---
Most of the opposition comes from the standpoint of people seeing "superior" game type stuff and fighting back against it. It is hard to read how much of the hype is from the novelty, or nostalgia, or enjoyment of old design principles (which fit vanilla well, and were totally broken by the end of BC just by adding a few new abilities and talents along with gear scaling up).
---
I've been frustrated with both subs and people upvoting love/hate posts that refuse to acknowledge the real world nuance that led to all the design choices over the years. Though that is probably just an overflow of general internet driven social media echo chamber culture sadly.
---
Yeah, probably.  1% of 1mil is 10,000, which is probably a lot.  We'll see though! 
---
Part of the fun though is watching everything unfold.  I'm not racing to 60 or taking time off work or anything.  I've done a Realm First for leveling and it sapped my motivation to play for a week.  I just plan on going slow and watching how hard some people can go.
---
I understand its quest related. But the action and the outcome are the same. Only difference is what triggers the action. The act of your character “phasing” in and out of alternate Azeroth’s causes an outcome that is not respectful to the spirit of Classic World of Warcraft.
---
Yes, unless they trust the group.

---
For an altoholic one of the best things about classic is that leveling takes so long and gearing as well... I didn't have any other class over 20ish in vanilla except for my lock. In retail I've maxed every class since cataclysm in every expansion.
---
Going consecrate first is the only way to tank, healers will pull off of you without it so unless you have cons, you can’t tank while leveling. Healing yeah you can do that as any spec
---
I don't know how you can't imagine it because its literally reality.  Min. wage in the US is around $9 in the US.  Working full time 40 hrs/week (Which most min. wage jobs won't allow you to work 40 hours a week, they cap you around 30-35 so they dont have to provide health insurance.) thats $18,720 as a yearly salary.  Thats reality.
---
Why would it not be able to? WoW is old asf and the switch can handle shit like Doom and Wolfenstein.
---
Put EVERYTHING on Switch!
---
Oh look an overused meme.
---
Just let the noobs go night elf ? Who cares lol. Everyone will think the same thing
---
&gt; If you don’t think you can clear basically everything but naxx with whatever spec you want, you have no idea what you’re talking about.
---
I never said you couldn't. All i'm saying is you're gonna have a hard time finding a guild that want you in their raid as an arms warrior. Todays standards is a lot higher than back in the day, and if you don't believe me, then I guess you're in for a big surprise when Classic launch :-)
---
Wands can't compete with spells like fireblast, earth shock and arcane shot.

But people will pass on all the tier sets before naxx for shitty greens and blues because epics arent the best in slot armor people thought they would be.
---
There are going to be way more fury wars than historically. My guild for instance currently has 3 protection wars and 10 fury, with around half the fury number in rogues (other rogues often changing classes). There's more fury because everyone knows they're top dps.
---
Thats how it always worked so no problem
---
sshhhhhhh don't tell anyone
---
I went more casual after Kil'Jeaeen my highest kill was top 300 ( 296 ).
---
Its not really high but that was when I first joined a guild that wanted to rank.
---
Other guilds I was in I got around 500isch.
---
Not exteemly good but the KJ kill is something I'm proud of.
---
Thank you, I needed this.
---
There's always some natural ablation. It's a big time commitment and not everyone's cup of tea.
---
A bar is not an inn.  You don't have to go home but you can't stay here.
---
Why would they need luck?  Honestly, some guilds really struggle to pick up 40 people every night.  An arms warrior is better than 39 players.
---
Well I guess that’s why they’re implementing layering during the beginning

To all of these except the mage: scatter shot &gt; feign death &gt; ice trap. Literally any melee class I'll eat for first and second breakfast with room for lunch.
---
With the mage it's obviously more difficult. You'd have to preempt the blink with a trap and hopefully snare them.

'Lamp' might just be my Druid's name.
---
Just install custom firmware, then you can be a serial downloader for free.
---
eh, we used to run with 5 arms warrs and were a world first guild. It was only slightly under rogues dps(rogues would be top 3 or so, but 4 and beyond was mixed). Not that people would do that anymore though, we know a hell of a lot more now, but arms wasn't an issue originally.
---
&gt; Now we are not worrying about layers, too.
---
Oaky then, here's a next problem: switching layers by relogging to farm rare mats.
---
That would be perfect!
---
Oh my fucking God, please delete this dude and go take a nutrition class
---
Like, there are plenty of guilds that don't care if you are comming as a meme spec, but things that are completely useless (fire mage in MC) or things that actively hurt the raid (Mortal Strike taking a debuff slot) are probably still going to get turned away.

I don't know why people think you are wrong here.

Is that helm from classic wow?
---
 &gt;One of the best parts about classic release is that private servers will have more accurate info.  RIP good ping though
---
Oh boy will Blizz drop the hammer on those servers when classic is out though.
---
I don't think there is going to be a surprise at all actually lol not sure why you think it's going to be so hard to find a guild that just need 40 players.
---
Dude just say what you want. Being 'neutral' doesn't help when you insinuate the choice is 'idiotic' regardless
---
As a hunter, you will be lower on the DPS side, it's just the way it is. But you have awesome utility, and especially in Naxx (I'm lookin at you Gluth) they are necessary for kiting. Tranquilizing shot is a god send as well. I will playing huntard this go around. I will be gearing up heavily in raids (though I admit I will not be dedicated enough to go into naxx). My end game is wPVP, and a full raid geared hunter is an absolute powerhouse in the open world when it comes to the enemy faction! So eat that low DPS up, and go give the other faction hell after raid!!!!
---
Yea I’m still stuck. It’s either Fury War or Rogue. Fury gives me the option to offtank and have easier times grouping but it also needs an absurd amount of commitment to optimize due to gearing and consumables. Combat rogue is similar but I can do a bunch of things without relying on grouping up.
---
Yeah I know, it's crazy lol. If I leave a tab open in the background too long even with adblock+ it starts lagging my PC. Nothing major, but it's noticeable when trying to load other websites. Pretty sure it's just a connection issue since my ping shoots up when it happens and not any issue with my hardware.
---
Bruh you gotta think trash too, you know how much shit you can skip with a hunter?
---
forsenE chu say
---
It really is the other way around actually. If you don't move a lot you don't need high calory food like doritos. If you do workout you can eat more of them than you otherwise should and still be healthy.
---
What? Conflag or double shadowbolt with nightfall and crits
---
that's because we no longer find enjoyment in running around aimlessly just "exploring the world". Been there done that. We aren't kids anymore. Leveling is fun, but let me get to 60, gear up, and smash in wPvP/PvE. I like efficiently progressing my gear/mount/maxing professions. Nobody here is the same 11 year old running around stormwind looking at people's gear for hours. 
---
We have jobs, some have families(yikes). If I'm going to log on I'm going to be 100% efficient towards reaching my endgame goals. Not saying I won't enjoy leveling or remember all the good memories of STV, but efficient gameplay is what I suspect why alot of people are going to rush to 60.
---
It's extremely likely it will still exist in phase 2. The only way it's going away is if the population plummets to the extent that Blizzard anticipates. If that doesn't happen and more people stick around, they will have the perfect excuse to keep layering in the game permanently. On the other hand, if the population does plummet enough for everyone to fit in a single layer... they *still* have no reason to remove layers, because the players would rarely ever notice it.
---
No way are you going to convince the mmo community to not min max. It comes with the territory of playing an mmo and is the reason why a lot of bad game design decisions have been made (endless sinks like artifact power). I think a lot of people are pumped for raiding because they have never done it at 60. Most will be unpleasantly surprised, but some will like it. If I were you I would just find a guild of similar minded players that aren't going to go turboed neckbeard and get world buffs every raid. Just because it's easier than originally perceived doesn't mean raiding isnt worth being excited for, the gear is still crazy good.
---
The average gamer spends ~6 hours a week playing video games. Playing three times more than that dose make you hardcore.
---
 The increase is equal to one rank of Master of Deception, which is a 5-rank talent.   Not worth it.
---
Thats why I'm thinking about changing my sleep schedule for launch!  If I sleep during the evening after work/school which is primetime, then wake up in the middle of the night and play until I have to go in for work then I'll be able to avoid most of the crowd!
---
Not actually doing this but the thought did cross my mind...
---
Min Max is a D&amp;D Fighter with a strength of 20 and an intelligence of 6 who traded his ability to read and his ability to dress himself for a +1 bonus to hit.
---
Yes, but it will only work against bad players.
---
/camp logs you out
---
You are surprised by a repost of a shitty meme on Reddit in 2019?
---
&gt; Similarly though a lot of people here who get off on playing a "superior" game.
---
Man, I've played Gwent, Shadowverse, MtG:A, Dota2, and Wildstar. In every single one of these communities, people would stroke themselves to how much better they were than people who played Hearsthone, LoL, WoW, etc.. I don't know why people need to pull these sort of mental gymnastics in order to justify not playing the most popular game in the genre, but its such a turn-off. I want to play a game because its fun, not because it gives me some undeserved sense that I'm better than someone else.
---
Pretty sure you just r/woooosh\-ed everyone.
---
I'll agree there, there's cons with all classes but warlocks are pretty tanky anyway. The lack of mobility doesn't bother me that much.
---
If you think that people play on pvp server just because wpvp you are mistaken. I play on pvp server because pve servers make no sense to me. It makes no sense to me that horde and alliance cant attack eachother. That was my mentality 14 years ago when i didnt care at all for pvp and still is (i do pvp now tho)
---
dat juicy bear ass
---
I dislike that I can’t farm spots late at night because NA is at it’s peak time on pservers.
---
I like having time windows like that.
---
Anyone want to make a list for those of us at work?
---
I recommend you visit the sidebar, where there is a Classic Census/Demographic Survey and the results posted. You can see the breakdown of class distribution.
---
Im so happy this pisses you off because everyone that wants buffs are just gonna get them lol
---
I am having this problem. I want to tank since I have been tanking since I returned to the game ,so obviously warrior. But its hard to get a tank spot in raids. I want to play balance druid because its awesome and has great class fantasy. But I want to raid so I will be fighting clothies while doing less dps. I want to play a mage so I can raid without the problems listed above and I want atiesh which I won't get as balance.
---
Yea because that's totally related to what he's talking about in the video. EVERY streamer complains about stream snipers.
---
The point of an expansion is to start the process again.
---
What would be the point of the game beyond vanilla if you didn't get new gear.
---
As a DPS, I work hard to foster relationships with above-average skilled healers. Having a veteran healer with you in a group can make for some really fun dungeons/wpvp.
---
Words out!!
---
Sort of.  +5 Weapon skill increases white attack damage by 6% total through glancing blow damage increase.  The difference in hit increases white damage by 3% and yellow damage by 3%, so they're pretty similar.  The hit chance is massively more important for tanks, who generate almost all of their threat through yellow hits.
---
Corpse runs should be exhausting, if not tedious. This would make the world a bit more frightening and not so modest.
---
But it's nothing new. It's just common sense.
---
Rogues are the biggest counter to locks. If I was horde I'd be going orc 100%
---
He’s Flemish not French-Canadian, you’re thinking XQC
---
If youre are better than everyone else the measure of doing good is you.
---
 Once I did a study where I was sat in a chair for a whole week with this big weird headset on. Turns out sitting for a whole week is bad for your poop and I didn't shit the whole time. When I finally did, it was just like you described. Fucking nightmare.
---
Elemental leveling is awful.
---
1h enh is really good. You get fast flametongue procs, a shield so you take less damage, fast ghost wolf casts, and way more sustain because you're melee based so you can regen mana while fighting
---
&gt;  An arms warrior is better than 39 players.  
---
Honestly, no. I bet you most people would rather raid with 39 players without than arms warrior than 40 players with an arms warrior. Also, if an upgrade for warriors drops, who would you rather give it to? The fury warrior that top dps meter or the arms warrior that does shit dps and actually gimps the whole raid with his mortal strike buff?
---
You cant code a community you are correct
---
 If you want me to point to hardcore proof of something I cant possibly do because the game hasnt launched yet then you are correct. I'm looking for that experience I'm not gonna play on a streamer server with the twitch spazzes. I'm going to have a great time and engage with the community because it's a part of what I want from classic wow. If you actively go out of your way to not engage I'm sure you wont have to worry about it.
---
I think you're overestimating how many players will be minmaxers.
---
You memorize this?
---
Switch has touch screen
---
 Came here for the classic lulz, wound up with nutritional advice.
---
Sure if classic wow had the mechanics to go with it. On FFXIV managing mana is important as well as knowing the boss mechanics.
---
Say what you will about TBC's warts, class design/balance alone make it better imo. It just opened up all of the classes and specs so well. The diversity was such a breath of fresh air.
---
My 59 BE rogue twink back in TBC was super fun. My biggest thrill was fighting other twinks, not non-twinks. UNLESS I was getting the flag back or something.
---
&lt;3
---
Yeah except half the intended playerbase because they happen to be in the wrong region, 10/10 blizzard
---
&gt;Twinks were always a minority in BG's.  when you separate queues  the queue times for twink players rose exponentially.  you go from queueing against your entire battlegroup,  to 20% or less of the players in your battlegroup.  
---
&gt;the battleground queues were also bugged during the seperation which also caused queue times to be longer.  
---
&gt;queue times for every twink battlegroup went from 1-2 minute queues, up to 1 hour or more.  nobody wants to spend 1 hour in a queue to play a game.  
---
&gt;so what happens?  people are waiting in queue for an hour to get 1 game.  then they queue again and have to wait 1 hour again.  people lose interest while waiting, thus they log off and go back on their mains.  Then it's just a snowball effect resulting in queue times being 5+ hours a week after the change,  then never popping a week later.  
---
&gt;And this was just in the 19 bracket which had by far the most twinks.  higher brackets like 39's and 49's were killed instantly because of queue seperation and bugged queues.
---
Warrior!
---
That’s what I did! I started playing WoW back in 7th grade the first month it came out. It took me a while to find and revive my old account (thx blizzard customer support) but I finally got logged back in and was able to look at my old characters from 15 years ago. It was fun.
---
Best chance I will have to test leveling routes, spawn points, etc. It sounds like it will be available for 3 days to look at things. So for me, it will be worth it...
---
You wait and see :p
---
Yeah, dont fuck around in school. You pay to be there, be there.
---
I agree!
---
Why do you think every guild is going to be filled with players? There's going to be a lot that struggle to fill a 40 man roster every night.
---
I can guess that your referring to some private server tactic to increase tps. Unnecessary for 90% of guilds imho, we didn't do it in classic, we didn't do it on Nost and had 0 issues. +5 to swords only makes it so level 61 creatures are not glanced, so if going for min maxxing then you would want +15 for level 63. The difference is so minor its not worth playing something you don't want to play over the course of 2 years+ imo. Again no swords except Thunderfury I would want to tank with for tps.
---
I am really excited to level up a character in Classic WoW.
---
I'm not sure if I am similarly excited to level up Alts.
---
I thought the concept of heirlooms was a good compromise. You earn them at max level, and if I remember correctly, were pretty expensive, and they expedite the tedium of leveling multiple times.
---
Heirlooms, plus scaling, plus generally neutering difficulty was taking the concept way too far.
---
They could sell a stylus with it. Left joystick does forward/backwards/strafe, drag screen to turn/ pan camera up and down. Touch target, touch skill.
---
Still slower than kbm, but it could definitely work.
---
So negative, my bro.
---
Also, ”I don’t think...” “Sounds like...”
---
Play it, then form your opinions. You sound like many ppl on here who simply read too much about a version of a game they’ve never played, but w/e.
---
Honestly fear Ward is freaking op in PvP too. Dwarf Priest has a passive WotF that they can apply to everyone in their party. People always talk about how they don't want to play ally warlock because of WotF, but in organized WSG and AB horde locks get shafted by Fear Ward way worse.
---
Its a meme that works in dungeons at best
---
An OOC rezz for druids.
---
This is a leak. It's not supposed to be announced until April 1st.
---
Because characters are recognizable. I remember some friends characters had the stupid dwarf face, or this color hair, etc. It helped with immersion and the worldly feeling.
---
Man, you under estimate how damn low and unlivable minimum wage is.
---
Yes, that is exactly what i'm trying to say.
---
You dont feel like getting buffs? fine :D Everyone else is and you will remain salty about it. The content is already trivial and the raids were never hard.
---
What he is actually talking about is holding off hks with out bgs , since they are lumping bgs with bwl phase 1 we likely be one of the longest phases in classic, they will leave time for you to lvl to 60 then clear mc. Keep in mind phase 2 will not be long as the qq will be massive on the official forums. Hks no bgs means farming lvl 50+ by 60s

I've tried running WoW through CRD but every time I right click the camera freaks out, I have to get by with keyboard turning and minimal camera movement. Have any suggestions on how to set it up?
---
There are only two things for me. I really want the updated graphics because let's be honest, BFA's world is beautiful and the spell graphics are amazing. I would like to have a less punishing way of talent management, whether it be dual spec or just a cheaper way to respec. Mainly just the graphics though becasue they are stunning.
---
Man I hated WoD questing, that was the main thing that made me realise I dont like modern wow
---
Exactly. People can look back at it now and say he was trash but at the time he was probably considered good. But of everyone went back in time with the knowledge we have now he might be considered trash even tho he is dtill doing the same. You can be the best while doing it in a very inefficient way
---
sorry bad memory here especially with names, the outdoor boss in Silithus will be there in the classic game?
---
I had full tier 2 on my paladin but I never got that shield... :(
---
This is pretty flawed. People hate twinks because they want to pvp as a break to leveling. There is no amount of "getting better" or "dedication" that can make you not get shit on by twinks if you're planning on leveling that character. Your whole premise is a strawman
---
So essentially warrior or gtfo?
---
But it's arguably the worst part of the Classic experience.
---
You won't main tank in raids
---
FFXIV has alright dungeons and raids but I lack any sort of RPG feel outside of them.
---
If you like it more, no. Feeling ways about stuff isn’t toxic. It’s when you try to impose your opinion on others or treat your opinion as fact.
---
49 enhancement shaman BiS takes a few hours and virtually no luck, and rewards you with an extremely strong PvP character.  
---
60 enhancement shaman BiS requires you to spend months playing WSG full time and a 1% drop from a 40 man raid, and rewards you with a mediocre character that loses most matchups lol
---
Immersion, difficulty, zone size, progression path, combat.  
---
All the failed MMO's screwed up one or multiple of these where Classic nailed all of them.
---
Face buttons + shoulder buttons for modifiers. There are ways to get like 20+ hotkeys out of controllers and it kind of is common knowledge by now.
---
layering is the only interesting thing to discuss, unless you prefer “what class should I play #848274” threads
---
- More options for smaller raids. 40 mans are very much the style of vanilla, but raids designed for 10-25 players are nice options.
---
- Lessened hybrid tax. I dislike excessive homogenization, so I think hybrid tax should still exist to encourage a hybrid style of play like vanilla did... but I think it's a bit too strong in vanilla and maybe a little too weak even in TBC. I think paladins should be able to DPS and tank reasonably effectively, even if they're not the first choice. I'd love to see balance druids not be the butt of jokes too.
---
- Progressive 5 man content. Challenge modes and mythic+ are interesting. I liked the reward system of challenge modes better than mythic+, but the concept of challenging content for small groups is appealing.
---
- Interesting single-player challenges. I really enjoyed the Mage Tower even if I only completed the challenges for a select few specs.
---
- Arena. It was usually fun for me. Small format PvP is a nice option to have.
---
Wondering if I should start my WoW sub now so I can get in on the beta to change my settings so that they are ready for launch.....damnit Blizzard
---
If you think donation money doesn't occasionally get pocketed by *every* private server team I have a bridge to sell you.
---
Why was holding the flag frowned upon? I used to always try to *win* WSG games on my 19 twink. That's how I had fun, I would see how many games I could carry to victory in a row. I don't get why this is wrong?
---
I don't need to wait and see, I've been playing vanilla on other servers for years now and nothing has changed.
---
we had a pally trash tank for the raids... main and off were always warriors.
---
you can easily do it
---
Elemental. Mana is really their main limiting factor as well.
---
A lot of people are still in the BFA mindset of only the best dps/hps matters when they're forgetting everything a class brings to the table for everyone else in the raid which is why there are 40 man raids, not everyone needs to be doing insane dps like mages, warriors and rogues.
---
Then that's a retarded guild.  If you don't want him to use MS then tell him not to use MS.  A warrior there literally auto attacking is better than a player short.
---
They have a mode that lets you move a cursor through a grid party setup and heal that target. It is easy to get to ANY person in the group in the time of a GCD. 
---
It works fine.
---
Yeah I think I'm gonna level with a group for classic - at least on my warrior. And I just like being prot better, especially in a group.
---
Id sell out for 23k, single pay.  2/3 of my yearly
---
yes, for the majority of the raids.
---
look, it's another era. it's not coming back.
---
back in 2004 people , Everquest veteran look at WoW as an anti-social game because you could level to max. then Everquest itself became less and less social... players expected the TLP server ( equivalent of classic WoW) to bring back the community aspect. It didn't.
---
same story will happen here.. you think classic will be back heavy community interaction, but the people playing it are the same; I'll forget about you as soon as we're done with the instance. you'll be referred to by class/role and not by name, and all the other anti-social behavior you loathe.
---
Well that's the thing that tips me over. I'd be fine with it if it didn't interfere with my questing so much. But in zones like STV, where 90% of the quests are shared between factions, if there's Horde there and no Alliance, too bad. Can't do your quest. On a PvE it's just a contest of who tags fastest, and I usually win that.
---
I don't believe a Paladin Tank is generally a good choice. It's really Warrior or Bust for Tanking in Classic. Druids make some pretty good off-tanks, but again, Warriors and usually there is 1-2 other Warriors(tanks) there to keep threat close to the Main tank, and take over if for some reason the main tank should die.
---
Damn. I was hoping the Bobby B not would work outside of /r/freefolk
---
10/10 well meme'd sir
---
No taunt and nothing to stop crushing blows. Good luck.
---
Some guilds use ferals as dps/offtank since they have taunt wich paladins do not, but warriors are still the best and most widely used.
---
Yeah you're wrong mate. I've leveled on private servers multiple times.
---
Flametongue increases your spell power as well though, and I just earthbind kite in between swing timers a lot with 2H
---
Gods, I was smart then.
---
Its the most fun u can have as a enh shammy
---
In that case, I wouldnt see something like that happening till a month or two in. I dont see how free characters, especially that cant chat, would be any benefit to the new community.
---
This would be beyond amazing...I would love to be able to just quest on the switch. Obviously macros and complicated PvP wouldn't work out well but my god this would be a dream.
---
I better start playing with music I guess :)
---
I could have fucking sworn you had to win.. (I never got it either and tried a bunch of times)
---
It's warrior tanking or druid off tanking with the few spots a druid is better on a few raid bosses.
---
It's great fun - I want to be able to run to dungeons and farm in peace though.
---
I'll probably roll an alt on a pvp server way down the road, but I don't want to be 100% on when I'm fishing for herbing - that's what I have bgs for :)
---
Doesn't Arcane Explosion require you to be in melee range (or close to it)? Seems very difficult to master, even harder than regular AoE farming.
---
Word. Thanks for the update.
---
They are great, we need an Alliance counterpart to mess with Horde streamers as well
---
Just depends on if you want to hardcore raid or not.  If you aren't hardcore anything is viable.  If you want to be in a top end guild though, some classes will be difficult.
---
Ive played my human warrior lolgenerator for 12 years I know im going to make lolgenerator the human warrior again
---
Want to never worry about finding a group? Priest or Warrior.
---
Watch tips out recent video with skarm tank or just skarm in general and youll see druid tanks are technically viable end game tanking. Though most guilds wont even entertain the idea. 
---
Still more likely than letting a paladin tank, though.
---
C C C combo breaker...
---
its about killing people
---
Did you report it in-game?
---
Honestly I can't think of a single thing and that makes me sad because, I feel like that's a neck beard answer. However in this case I have to stand by it. I can't think of a single change they made that I like.
---
Yeah deathdealer helm from aq
---
If you're dedicated warrior will be fine. Probably 50-70% of the people that say they will play warrior will drop out because of how painful it is to solo level as warrior.
---
Id say spront doesnt last long enough for the big trash skips
---
24 hours, not 3 days
---
ofc :)
---
Been a lock since day one. Wanted to try a hybrid for classic for going feral druid to start. Wish me luck lol.
---
That's just doesn't give you the proper feeling of progress that people want tho. The tier system is just fine.
---
I think thats when Russell Brower moved on from Blizzard.
---
Record from back in the day was 116 hours.
---
Don’t forget the private server scene.  There’s a community of speed runners that have existed in this isolated bubble world.
---
There’s 168 hours in a week.  It’s doable in a week.
---
Maybe better to say 1% will be 60 after 10-14 days.
---
If so, they will lose a lot of players.
---

---
I played both TBC and wrath, and I'm honestly not sure why so many people like TBC more.  
---
In my opinion, Wrath was better by almost every metric: Environment, quests, lore, art direction, story, class design, item rewards, cinematics...  
---
TBC had better class balance overall, but that was eventually improved in Wrath too (with holy paladin and deathknight nerfs).
---
I keep changing my mind over the last few months.  I was originally set on warrior, then rogue, not I'm considering shaman or hunter as well.  Basically if I'm actually able to no life it and hit launch hard warrior will probably be best.  If I actually want to take my time and enjoy leveling rogue is my go to.  If I'm too busy and come in late I'll probably roll hunter because they are a lot of fun and easy to level.  And I love shaman so there's just that in the back of my head.  I'm just worried I won't like raid healing.  I like hybrids in 5 mans, but I'm afraid I'll just be looking at raid frames if I go heal in end game.  Also totem twisting sounds like a pain in the ass.
---
Mechanical skill in vanilla wow is mich less important than it is today. The game was much slower, and the theory crafting aspect is what made the best the best. Athene might of been a good player, but from what i remeber he was a great theory crafter and thats what pur him at the top.
---
Can’t read
---
I’m doing warrior first, luckily found a friend thats leveling a priest so if it works out I’ll have a pocket healer.  Then warlock, then rogue and after that TBD.  Now, if it doesn’t workout and I don’t find another pocket healer I’m gonna start with lock, druid, or shaman/paladin.  I’d ideally like my first character to have some use past DPS (locks still in there because I like their utility and solo ability).
---
Me playing a rogue, seeing the other classes having fun: all must pay, all must suffer. &lt;stealths&gt;

Lots of losers in this thread saying the usual dumb Bullshit like  
---
"twinks only do it to kill noobs reeeee"
---
when in fact in 95% of battlegrounds the enemy team also had twinks on them.  but of course you losers like to act as if twink players just bypassed each other to kill the noobs on the other side. which is a lie.
---
The twink players that only did it to kill noobs were in the minority, and were considered trash among twink guilds. 
---
Of course im going to obliterate a non-twink when hes in my way,  after I dispose of the noob then the real challenge begins of outplaying the enemy twink flag carrier.   
---
Do some players play twinks just to kill noobs?  yes.  
---
Do some players play twinks because they like the meta game and beating other twinks. yes.
---
and before I get the usual talking point anti-twinkers always like to say   
---
 "iF TwInKs oNlY WaNtEd tO FiGhT OtHeR TwInKs wHy dId tWiNk bRaCkEtS DiE AfTeR ThEy wErE In tHeIr oWn sEpErAtE Bg's??
---
Twinks were always a minority in BG's. when you separate queues the queue times for twink players rose exponentially. you go from queueing against your entire battlegroup, to 20% or less of the players in your battlegroup.
---
queue times for every twink battlegroup went from 1-2 minute queues, up to 1 hour or more. nobody wants to spend 1 hour in a queue to play a game.
---
so what happens? people are waiting in queue for an hour to get 1 game. then they queue again and have to wait 1 hour again. people lose interest while waiting, thus they log off and go back on their mains. Then it's just a snowball effect resulting in queue times being 5+ hours a week after the change, then never popping a week later.
---
And this was just in the 19 bracket which had by far the most twinks. higher brackets like 39's and 49's were killed instantly because of queue separation, because there was way less 39 and 49 twinks, and bugged queues.
---
Crushing blows are so insignificant that warriors dont even need defense cap
---
Thank god for. If you can, go to every instance that it happens and report them individually, lol. Not sure if it would matter.
---
So you're telling there's chance!
---
&gt;Pallys are always trash ~~tanks~~ 
---
fixed xD
---
How do Warriors stop Crushing Blows?
---
The best and most unique (not repetitive farming and afking in bgs spawn) content in Classic is leveling, dont rush, enjoy that in every aspect.
---
Well, no. He’s a Paladin
---
&gt; Also, if you roll human that +5 weapon skill means when using swords to tank you can equip any gloves you want.
---
That doesn't really counter his point that the only sword worth tanking with is TF. 
---
&gt; On a NE Warrior you're forced to wear the gloves that give weapon skill even all the way up to Naxx.
---
Being locked into a pair of gloves seems a lot less obtrusive and fun-killing than being locked into an entire race you don't enjoy.
---
Something tells me you didn't play a paladin in classic.
---
I could deal with this until the last point. Lock T1 was one of the best sets ever and looked AMAZING on my Femorc lock.
---
Don't forget that night elf rogues have better stealth so they're actually gaining a free talent point that most builds would normally use in master of deception. NEs can go 4/5 and still be the same stealth level as a 5/5 different race.
---
It's litterally bad in every single way.
---
Pvp? gz, you just gave the enemy warrior 1% extra chance to overpower crit your face.
---
Pve? Yeah, lets get stats that give you LESS rage generation. 
---
1% dodge is a bad thing if you're going to min/max, not a good one.
---
Stop trying to make Fetch happen! It's not going to happen!

Wow I feel fucking stupid for making that run the long way so many times

I've having trouble seeing some items come up when I try to add them in Character Details. But they show up in Items. Mark of Fordring is one example. Even if I only have quest items clicked.
---
something something bilderberg meetings

it isn't though?
---
&gt;Player attacking a Player Edit
---
Weapon skills are maxed in PvP combat. This means leveling a weapon skill for pvp is unimportant; when attacking an enemy player, your Weapon Skill will always be considered to be your level * 5, and your target's Defense will always be treated as his level * 5 (before any Defense Rating from your target's gear is added in).
---

I don't really mind the new models, but I can't stand all the new animations and spell effects for the classic spells. I also hate the new rigging, the way the races move just turns me off. Perhaps I'm just too nostalgic.

when i started, i got into a guild through a friend, and would have 100% been a raid logger, had the MT/raid leader/guild leader not singled me out to help me, i ended up being a core raider through all of tbc, and geared nearly everyone in our guild through dungeons and farm raids purely because my guild leader had made the effort to make the game fun for me as well, he cared very little about who got gear or who was geared and because of his attitude the guild didn't care much either gear was inevitable fun wasn't. we rolled on gear coz  your new friends stick around when you treat them well
---
I dunno man. WotF gives you the edge over all Alliance warlocks and priests.
---
Autoattack is usually reasonable for the first few levels when your sbolt spam isn't strong enough to totally kill something. The damage you take and time lost from being hit is worth it for a tag, and your demon skin regens it all very easily.
---
I got sick and tired of moderating everyone's "WHAT SPECS DO I NEED!?" posts so I did my best to get a sense of how old, shitty systems can handle Classic.
---
Void sucks because you should just be threat bouncing with a Succ anyway. Faster kills and just as safe + an extra CC.
---
same :-) join us for twinking in some bracket (29 39) and keeping an alt for fun leveling thru locations to 49 in meantime
---
This?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU6PAnGUKV0
---
You didn't even mention the ganking opportunities that shadowmeld provides!
---
Shamans/Paladins are definitely in the running for top 3 most popular. On whatever faction you choose, those classes will definitely be like 2nd/3rd most popular after warrior. Warlock is probably like 5th popular.
---
Right to 11
---
Basically you're not going to be server first anything or get any legendary or hit rank 13 or 14. Also, not going to be in a streamers guild.
---
Because WoW is heavily CPU bound in raid environments and the Switch's CPU is a mobile-level CPU from 2012. Especially in hand-held mode, the CPU is probably pretty close to the same level as an average off-the-shelf desktop from 2006 and I'm sure we all know how much those struggled in raids. Doom and Wolfenstein are primarily GPU-intensive games so having a weaker CPU is just fine, not to mention Doom 2016 is one of the most well optimized games ever released.
---
Yes kkomrade

Party leader stays in town to recruit til full.

Can I get achievement points for doing it?

I fucked your dad right to 11

The headpiece looks like something out of a Halloween costume store. Sorry buddy

The first year is cake
---
If you don’t think racial traits impact pvp you haven’t been frustrated fighting humans before.
---
Lol wut. This comment for least true in the entire thread please. 
---
Leveling with lock is exciting if you don't play like an idiot and use Succ over Voidwalker. PVP if you dot and wait you are HORRIBLE at it. Locks eat up most shamans with pet totem stomping and being able to kite (dispelling frost shock on self).
---
Being a horde lock isn't so peachy though. Paladins can spam dispel your curses for cheap plus you'll always be facing a dwarf priest in any decent comp team
---
&gt; Curse of the Indecisive
---
Sounds like you should roll a Druid or Mage for decurse.
---
This is the truth.
---
Because warriors have defensive abilities.
---
Yes, im pretty sure i stated above that's his prediction ?
---
"Plan B" is what you use to keep having me time.
---
I'm always running a tv show or movie on the second screen so I miss out the music
---
Yea, I loved it when World PvP could have meaning: Killing a guild group with their world buffs, camping someone so they would leave your farming spot, etc. Can't do that anymore nowadays
---
also a minority of comeback'players who do not want to spend whole time in the content they spent whole vanilla in (raids, farming, raids, casual bg, farming)
---
Good thing a shadow priest is fully capable of healing dungeons then
---
I hate gnomes, but if they provide a pvp advantage on zeppelins then I have to give that props
---
lol def annoying.
---
Not having BGs in until phase 3 is going to be great for World PvP.  People are going to seek it out as theres no BGs to queue for so if they want to PvP they're going to find it in the open world.
---
I know a lot of people are rolling on a PvE server because they dont want to deal with it, especially while leveling.  But I feel like they'll be missing out on half a game until BGs come out, and will still be missing out on a good portion of it even then.
---
We have a wife to find.
---
Wha
---
Yeah, if your class is weaker at PvP or you just don't want to do it as much, then you actually have to come up with strategy for avoiding said pvp. That's what made the world feel more dangerous than it is
---
Rogue, Prot Warrior, Shadow Priest, Resto Druid, Enhancement Shaman....
---
I have no idea what I want to play. I REALLY want to play Shadow Priest but with the 16 debuff slot limit, not too sure if I want to take on the challenge of attempting to get a guild to let me run raids.
---
Classic wow was about just having fun your own way.
---
But that not the mindset people have anymore.
---
Majority of people will try to minmax.
---
Then they will realize this game ain't about that life and they quit lol.
---
I playing a mage.

Best looking gear ever in WoW, paladin t2.
---
Is that a Samsung 2233RZ 120hz monitor aswell?
---
Overreacting much? 
---
I for know many of us here dont view r/wow. This is much better than "streamer x did this" or the 1077th post of "whats after classic" or the 12089th post of "will i be able to raid with this spec".
---
I've also known of Twink players who got gladiator titles their first time trying endgame PvP, after maining twinks
---
Yeah, I'm doing the same. Working on Paladin now, and so far I think that's what I'm gonna go with. I also tried Warrior and Hunter, but Paladin just has that "Holy Warrior" factor that I really like in RPGs.
---
Everyone has already pointed out all the ways that it's easy enough to use all your abilities, that's no problem. The bigger issues is that I don't see a way to actually target stuff that wouldn't feel clunky as hell. In handheld mode you could tap on the screen but that doesn't transfer over to docked mode at all and would require you to take your hand off the controller anyways. Good luck doing that in any pvp situations. Could have a button assigned to tab targeting and set it to also cycle through friendly targets but that's going to be a pain in the ass trying to fight anything when friendly targets are nearby. Maybe have clicking in one stick tab target through enemies and clicking in the other stick tab targets through friendlies?
---
TANK IT ALL!
---
But OP was just stating his opinion. It wasn't imposed on anyone any more than any other opinion in this sub. This seems like more of a case of someone stating opinions you don't like than anything else. Call it toxic if you want but that doesn't say much because toxic is like just your opinion man. Not fact right?
---
Stadia.
---
Mythic plus means more replayability for the dungeons and more interesting raid mechanics and considerably better class balance.
---
&gt; 2h shamans
---
What does shamans have to do with anything related to the *alliance* racial that is being discussed here?
---
Yes, the wowhead said 19-21 June so I had to go back &amp; look at the official message which says 48 hours - so 5pm on the 19th through 5pm on the 21st. The first several hours on the 19th will likely be unplayable.
---
I remember grinding so many damn quests to get the saber mount for my paladin back in the day. Best racial mount, hands down.
---
&gt;How long time does it take for you to take a dump?
---
A couple minutes, but easily half an hour or more with this.
---
I actually really disliked playing with Europeans and Russians on private servers. It's just different cultures and it made it harder to make friends especially when people start talking in languages I can't read.
---
That's exactly how it's supposed to be. If you control an area and camp the other players, it must be scary for them. but also vice versa, if the momentum turns or just a huge battle arises. Now it's just a zerg that gets phased.
---
The PS3 could run final fantasy 14 in raid environments, and FF14 is newer and has better graphics, AND the switch is stronger than PS3 and Xbox 360...
---
Imagine running for 2+hours to a zone and then dying, only to respawn back at the original place except now with a naked 2+ hour run back to your body and gear.
---
EverQuest
---
Ion said ~2 months each for the first 2 phases, so Layering will be in at most for 2 months.
---
Looks like the parry belt from AQ.
---
Yes!
---
How funny would it be if Blizzard started to release the numbers after Classic is released?
---
It is ok to have opinions, even if yours is wrong.
---
"Leveling is the game" is the biggest miss-selling on this subreddit.
---
I couldn't care less about 1-59..... other than some pvp. Loved raiding in classic.
---
Everyone is different.
---
I could lay the hurt down pretty well.
---
Oh ok. All things I dont care about.
---
Thankyou!
---
Getting a girlfriend is what sucked me into TBC. She had just started playing.
---
Holy shit fkn Pizza Hut. I was on Mannoroth with a twink Orc Warrior Pigskim. Full BIS, man was it fun. This just brought me back lol, thanks.
---
Pallies can’t decurse. They can dispel magic thou.
---
This is 100% fine, but the issue isn't with how they are playing. The issue is with how they are telling everyone else they HAVE to play or else they won't ever get to play.
---
Only on Reddit.
---
So how much better or worse is the performance in Classic on low vs. the 1.12 client used on private servers?
---
While I understand your sentiment and I also agree the wpvp aspect is half the game, there are tonnnnns of people who just want to explore the world, do quests, absorb all the lore, and piddle about without any ganking.
---
&gt;that's a talking point that a lot of anti-twinkers like to talk about.  but it's easily proven wrong.  
---
&gt;And this was just in the 19 bracket which had by far the most twinks.  higher brackets like 39's and 49's were killed instantly because of queue separation, because there was way less 39 and 49 twinks, and bugged queues.
---
the only bracket to get consistent games was the 19 bracket, and it was only doable because people transfered their 19 twinks to the same battlegroup.  and they would have 3-4 games going consistently throughout the day,  that lasted for over a year.   of course not everybody was going to spend $25 on a character transfer just to play twinks, so they died in every other battlegroup
---
TBC improved PvP for a lot of people, replacing the honor grind with arenas, which were super fun back in TBC.
---
Azeroth always need more tanks.
---
&gt; but I thought everybody who wanted Classic was looking forward for the trip, not the destination.
---
It was a meme, there've been plenty of warnings about it since well before Classic was announced, but like most reflections on Vanilla that aren't sickeningly positive they're usually buried.  Yea, the journey to 60 was different than today's journey to max level in WoW and many people prefer the old system over the new, but almost everyone, whether they admit it or not, is looking forward primarily to playing the game at 60.  The main value of the "journey" for most of the playerbase is to make the destination feel more prestigious and to increase personal investment in whatever character.
---
WoW has always been about the end-game.  Back in Vanilla it was well agreed on that "end-game is the real game" and "the game starts at 60."  That doesn't mean the road there can't be more or less fun (whatever fun is to you), but expect people who played back then and missed out on content to be wondering how to avoid missing out on content this time around.
---
&gt; Well, Im just curious, but if endgame is what its all about, isnt every expansion better than Classic?
---
Gist is, the end-game playstyle is different.  Since Wrath end-game has been about executing rotations or priority systems with extreme precision and very little down-time, while in Vanilla the difficulty came from resource management more than high octane button sequences, though some classes lean more towards having rotations.
---
Nothing wrong with that. I think its tough to listen to min/maxers as a new player and not understand fundamentals. 
---
Summit is speaking to new players. Why? Bc new players want to have an edge over vets. They fear not being invited or getting to play the game bc they don’t have FoTM like in BFA. 
---
Yet as a new player spend your time learning your class, just pick one and learn it. Have fun. Doesn’t matter if you’re min/maxing you’re gonna get invited and you’re gonna have fun. But first you need to learn your class. Be one with your class :p
---
Have you never changed your hairstyle? In 18 years or better have you kept the same style all your life? “Muh immersion”         Isn’t affected by someone changing their hair not to mention how all the cosmetic options look nearly indentical from a distance anyway, and that’s assuming we aren’t wearing helmets the whole time
---
Like a few other have said it has to be mythic+ and the modern raids generally. I know I’m going to love classic up until raiding just a little worried that’s when it could lose its appeal for me.
---
Are you sure that casting will cause shadowmeld to drop on Classic?  That was actually an important gameplay element to me.
---
I agree with most of these points but not bringing many due to utility early on is a stretch. Just by existing you'll always want to have 3 for curses, sometimes 4 for Shadows if you can get one.
---
For raiders not trying to go full hardcore, weak DPS early on isn't much of an issue because the early raids are relatively casual; the main concern is keeping the people you want for the endgame around by placating them with goodies. Warlocks shine by AQ and AQ is when you really need to buckle down, so taking as many as you can to ensure the later supply is there is closer to reality than only taking a few early on.
---
This is fantastic and I really appreciate your effort. It deserves attention
---
Yes it does, when you have vision beyond the small world you live in and realize that others exist with this same concept and can *GASP* actually group up with each other!
---
This is insulting to EU Players. Atleast let us join the Americans.

---
Trueshot Aura is extra 7DPS for everyone.
---
There is no strategy. The only thing you can do is quit playing. Or play on a PvE server and PvP on your own terms, in battlegrounds. At least there you have a fair chance. Because let’s face it, most world PvP boils down to waiting until some dude is busy fighting a mob or low on health / mana. There’s no skill in that.
---
And this was just in the 19 bracket which had by far the most twinks. higher brackets like 39's and 49's were killed instantly because of queue separation, because there was way less 39 and 49 twinks, and bugged queues.  
---

---
Less so than if they just admitted it now. A lot of people will already be invested in the game and accustomed to layering by that point.
---
It's more consistent and reliable than wf procs
---
Are you really posting your own screenshoted post?
---
Damn classic... lol
---
This happened to me so many times, and every fucking time you are like on silithus and your traveling all the way to Black rock mountain just to be kick 3 minute after
---
Rofl. Thanks
---
I can count on one hand the number of people who said they were going to play a non meta spec and also claimed they would be in a competitive raid guild. 
---
The only ones making that association are the ones telling them they can't play those specs.
---
Greetings, fellow altoholic.
---
Unless you just got a new rank of rockbiter you might as well be a ret paladin doing that shit
---
Yeah, but this all depends on whether or not the cast bar addon is allowed in vanilla. I saw in the PvP tourny people were using it and it was kinda upsetting as I thought that was a massive disruption in how vanilla was.
---
I played Warlock in Vanilla, Spriest from BC all the way through WoD and Shaman in Legion. Legion was my first time ever healing. I wish I had known how much I loved healing sooner. Though I know it will be different in Classic, I am so excited to Shaman heal!
---
Your problem was leveling elemental
---
As you can see, the priest in this clip can't be reduced below 1 hp (as a bug, he's not just getting lucky).
---
Looking for any other information on what might cause the bug, and looking to spread this awareness to Blizz. Was reported via in-game tracker, but figured video evidence would help.
---
druids can tank well too. I think gearing wise it might be even optimal to have 1/3 druid main tanks and 2/3 warriors. Paladin could tank something but you should never be geared over even fury warriors so theres that. So unviable but possible. Basically once you get the gear which would otherwise be nexus crystals and when the real tanks are off then you could probably have tanking duties.
---
I too like to cook fantastic meals then dump them in the garbage.
---
2 things: #1 love the name, i had a gnome warlock with that name!
---
\#2 yes shaman. (but I'll also be rolling a rogue =P)
---
June 12th, 2006 - started wow.
---
Done it before.
---
I can watch old videos of people raiding - I can read guides and reviews for all raids when they came out.
---
It’s not negative - it’s just not my preference.
---
But then you might as well be a ret paladin because you just auto attack. Firebrand + searing is comparable to 2h + wf and it's more consistent/reliable
---
Only when you are answering yourself will the response always be "No"
---
What is it with all you types who seem to think all of you are the ONLY players in the game and EVERYONE has your exact mentality? What is that special bubble of a world like?
---
I've somewhat tried it at other instance locations but none of the others exhibit that behavior. At least SM and RFD don't for sure but can't be certain for other instances altho I haven't noticed it.
---
Not really, I want to PvP when I feel like it. I can wait until battlegrounds. Classic is probably gonna be around for a while.
---
Not enough streamers in EU
---
To add to what you said, effective effective health points (EHP) just a buffer.  In all situations your healers have higher HPS than boss DPS, so your EHP just needs to be higher than the maximum damage a boss can do in a single heal cast.    Since the main limiting factor in a boss fight is duration (healers go OOM or boss enrages), maximizing DPS is more important, and to that end TPS is the most important  Stats are generally a tradeoff, so the best tanks try to find the minimum viable EHP for a fight, so they can maximize TPS.
---
Avoidance (dodge and parry) reduces the total damage you take in a fight, and reduces healer mana consumption.  However, it doesn't technically increase your EHP because it is chance based and can't be attained in amounts that could be considered reliable.  The 1% dodge bonus for night elves is nice, but not meaningful when talking about raid tanking.
---
Prot palas threat generation is terrible, and they go oom in 2 seconds. There is no way you will be tanking raids. Perhaps dungeons, but not raids.
---

---
Yes I am
---
&gt;some 
---
What do u mean no strategy? If the target is similar level to yours, you can adapt your playstyle to try to beat them. If there's multiple people, you can bring more people of your own. If you can't beat em, try avoiding them. If if all else fails, find another farming spot.
---
oof
---
There will always be lots of rogues, they are the second most played class on private servers IIRC.
---
Free server firsts. Use the tokens immediately and rush everything then transfer off server
---
Just do something like Xx_virginslyr45_xX
---
You know, real original
---
Just avoid the servers with the streamers on them EZ Clap
---
Use a shield with a fast 1h so that you get more firebrand procs. Then just drop searing totem and lightning shield. If your 1h is slow you can probably get away with some earthbind kiting.
---
Thankyou for your service /u/NanoNostalrius
---
What time does the test go live?
---
Mo work?
---
What do you mean?
---
Ultimately, Retail WoW gave us Classic. I think that's kind of a good thing.
---
Well not that I remember
---
That's where I am right now. Played since Vanilla beta and I always mained Rogue and Mage but this go around I want to play a Shadow Priest but feel I am really boxing myself in and will eventually end up being a heal bot in endgame.
---
I will probably pussy out and go Rogue to play it safe.
---
You know that your body converts all nutrients to glucose (sugar), right?  And you’re also aware that that sugar is broken into ATP, without which every cell in your body will starve to death?
---
Well... here in Switzerland I would need 5 tokens  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
But your idea is not bad at all, but this would limit the social interactions to a minimum.
---
Mage and warrior will be more populated than rogues but they will still be hard to gear since most of the time you will have a warrior tanking the dungeon. As for lock it still might be pretty popular in classic just not as populated as a mage but you also don't need as many in a raid. If you love rogue I would recommend playing rogue, its a long journey to 60 and it wouldn't be smart to settle for something you don't like as much just because of a fear of overpopulation.
---
 If you're worried about getting into groups and gearing up the best solution is to find a guild and start making friends.
---
I seen a post on another sub and screenshot it to here? Don't see an issue
---
mage rotation until AQ drops

---
Idk it feels like a lot of people are looking forward to the 1v1a and large scale battles. Phase 2 is going to be groups and groups of people 24/7 trying to rank.
---
Ye, but Im guessing nobody adds specific characters and instead adds through battlenet account
---
Pretty sure server transfers weren't a thing in classic. Is my memory wrong on that?
---
I enjoy the consequences that came with respeccing in Vanilla. Gives your character much more of an identity when you're not switching back and forth. I understand the convenience, but from the standpoint of video game immersion, I think the single spec/high cost for respec is good for the game.
---
Well if I had a bad game I afked out and switched to an identical character with a different name.
---
You can just as easily play only 20hrs a week, not seeing the issue
---
Have fun with any quest in any starting zone
---
WotLK would be perfect if it had the exact design philosophy of TBC. Only 1 version of raids, no Dungeon Finder, and everything else
---
&gt; this would limit the social interactions to a minimum.
---
What makes you say that?
---
You can’t beat someone who sneak attacks you while fighting a mob. You can, but the chance is very slim. If you die once it’s game over because the guy will camp you and kill you before you can get your health back.
---
What if nobody feels like helping? What if all good farming spots are taken? 
---
I like some PvP every now and then, but not in the form of this unavoidable cockblock that I run into time and time again.
---
Hunters are good for gathering professions too seen as they can hold their own in wpvp, i'll be making a hunter alt too for gold farming
---
I still think WotLK version of shadowmeld should be in the game in order for NE to be on par with the good races.
---
90% of the game was not getting there....
---
The game had as much end game as any other version of Wow... the big difference being the design of the world and less casual mechanics made it feel more alive.
---
I seen a post on another sub, commented and screenshot it to here?
---
You think you do, but you don't.
---
To play effectively in pvp with some classes you need 36+ keybinds. They would have to dumb down the game to BFA action-rpg spin to win levels of lame in order to make playing competitively on mobile viable. That's exactly the direction that they're been going with the game and it's precisely why it's terrible. Nobody actually wants this for any reason other than the basics of farming, questing, auction housing or whatever else.
---
K. Any idea how it is on i5 integrated graphics(desktop) from a few years back? It had zero problems running the 1.12 client at a locked 60 when I tried it a few months ago.
---
FFXIV's raid size is 24 at the absolute highest. Classic WoW's raids have literally double that. Plus, supporting the PS3 caused some pretty severe limitations for the game, like only being able to show 40 characters/mobs on screen at once. That kind of limitation literally wouldn't even let you see all of your raid and the boss/adds at the same time.
---
And on top of all of that, only the Switch's GPU is stronger, the CPU is at best about the same performance at the 360 and PS3 in docked mode, probably slower, and definitely much slower in handheld mode.
---
Just model the controller scheme and UI after FFXIV's, allowing you essentially full control over the whole UI and letting trigger holds alternate your castbar. So actionbar 1 is open, 2 is LT, 3 is RT, 4 is LB, 5 is RB, and you could expand by variations of trigger / bumper holds. It's not that complicated and gives you a range of abilities that you quickly memorize.
---
I really do this every night for about 20 minutes after my wife passes out lol.
---
/castsequence x, x, x
---
I would buy a switch just for this game! Unfortunately I do not see this happening.
---
Whats r/woooosh\-ed?
---
I wholeheartedly disagree. The new Tauren is absolutely stunning and the best of the new models
---
Go play retail. You can play 20 hours a week and be fine.
---
oh and /castrandom x, x, x
---
well, yes, there is a way to not get shit on by twinks
---
If you don't want to get shit on, you go out and get better gear and items before entering the BG's before you start leveling again.
---
not only will it help you do better in BG's, it will help you having that good gear for when you want to start leveling again   :)
---
I've been deciding between lock and rogue and i think you just brought me back over to the lock side again haha..
---
Mortal Strike is the main source of damage for an arms warrior. Why the fuck would anyone want a warrior in their raid that is only allowed to auto attack? And why would you want to give that person gear? Come on dude, just stop already.
---
Sure you can, if you happen to meet them.
---
And considering they're a minority spread across many different levels, zones and even time zones, you probably won't.
---
For months I have been set on going lock. But recently I am starting to want to go priest because I want that role priority since I don’t know how often I am going to be able to play.... My brain is fucking with me at this point.
---
As long as your reputation on your server is that of a skilled/good player I doubt you’ll have trouble finding groups.
---
This needs more upvotes
---
Layering is only on for starter zones and/or start of the game. What rare mats?
---
It is more complex. Dual spec decreased investment in the character/class identity, and I'm saying this as someone who really rooted for dual spec. Because it was expensive to respec, I tended to roll different alts to fill those roles. It sounds goofy now, but I had my ret paladin, a holy paladin, and a prot paladin (for instance). This druid was resto and that one was kitty. This hunter was MM and that one was BM. I feel like it secured me an attachment to those characters and when I played them, secured an attachment to their identity via their spec.
---
I can't deny that dual spec would save most of us some major headaches (or gold sinks), but I'm not going to pretend that it didn't have negative consequences, too. Being able to switch on the fly without a real cost meant you lost that feeling of, "I'm a prot paladin" or "I'm a holy priest."
---
Sounds like what you are looking for id diablo 3.
---
It's my personal opinion. Some players will have day shifts, some night shifts. And some will work in between. so you'll have to time this well, if you want to play with you friends and with randoms. This is what I ment :D
---
At least the melee isn't over extending their healers.
---
The whole reason it became easy and boring though is because people wanted it to be easier and faster because they decided they didn’t care about the journey anymore. Enough people that eventually blizzard made changes, then more changes, with even more still to come. Now people complain that the journey doesn’t matter. It’s the reason the you think you know what you want but you don’t meme exists.
---
I just hope that now with two games the people who want those kinds of changes will just play retail and not ask for them in classic
---
That's where the beauty of having better gear comes into play. Or skill, and if you have both, doesn't really matter who gets the opener. And if nobody feels like helping if you're getting corpse camped (which u can always GY res), then you need to find a better guild lol
---
We got work work to do!
---
It's for people that don't want people who can play 80 hours a week charging past them and rolling everything. At launch you gonna have a lot of no life teens camping people who can't level quickly. Not everyone wants to deal with that. 
---
I wouldn't play on a 20 hour a week server because I intend on no-lifing classic for at least 6 months but, I know quite a few guys who would love this.
---
The idea that changing my characters hair breaks someone else’s immersion is absolutely ridiculous. 
---
I would like to have my chars hair go from short to long and then turn grey and have him eventually go bald over time.  That would be fun for me.  
---
Seems a little silly that my character in an rpg has a beard that they can never shave, but it is what it is I guess.
---
We need more r/freefolk here.
---
I too vaguely remember not being able to summon from kalimdor to EK
---
The old ones had the exact same art style, it was just inhibited by low poly count and texture resolution
---
Where are you getting that info? Because all ive seen is that the switch beats PS3 and Xbox 360 massively in everything.
---
And again, classic wow is less intensive than FF14.
---
yeah it's an absolute no-doubter that it's a bug. The priest is at 1 HP and literally getting his ass beat by like three dudes and just can't die.
---
Pretty sure its gone by 1.12.
---
seems to be related to priests specifically? I've seen a couple of these clips of invincible players and all 3 of them were priests.
---
In classic the game starts at 1.
---
There was a horde priest on asmon's stream last week or so that was invincible also. I don't know the cause but some people speculated it was something to do with mind control.
---
I was so glad when they broke healbot.
---
Luke from Linus Tech Tips/Floatplane was on Countdown to Classic a few weeks ago. He discussed why building something with old parts is a terrible idea.
---
Well whatever voices are in your head are wrong, unless you would like to elaborate
---
Already works.
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/console-port
---
It's not the same game. One is an MMORPG and, one is... fuck I don't even know what to call the shit pile that is retail because it's no MMORPG.
---
lmao still arguing with people and starting fights I see
---
Rebind you C (info) key to I and you're on to a winner
---
I would be interested to know what specifically about mind control or priest would cause this. Strange.
---
&gt;TBC dungeons punish mistakes more heavily than Vanilla dungeons ever did.
---
Yes and no. Depends what kind of mistakes were made. DPS pulling for instance mostly became a non-issue. Which, incidentally, if what we're talking about here.
---
&gt;The only problem here is mentally inflexible tanks not understanding the game doesn't have to revolve around aggro
---
First of all. Not everyone can be amazing. You may be, I may be, but to expect it of every tank is honestly super fucking shitty. 
---
Second. Not having control can be stressful, you might feel like you're failing, or you might get told off by DPS/healers who think you are.  
---
If you cannot empathise with this, that's on you. That's you being "mentally inflexible" (whatever kind of low-key /r/iamverysmart remark that's supposed to be.)
---
&gt;As a tank, I appreciate some interesting pulls or even fuckups once in a while, actually engaging the group both on a gameplay and social level.
---
And yet, if that's not how others are able to enjoy the game, that should be respected as well. 
---
We need tanks, and burning them out instead of being patient with them just because they don't confirm to your idea of "the vanilla experience" is... well at this point you either get it or you don't.
---
Your post is arrogant as fuck by the way. I'm sure that fits perfectly with your vanilla experience. Sure are enough of you.

Mace of McGowan used to be surprisingly cheap on the AH in vanilla, it’s identical stat wise to the Dal’Rend MH. Keep an eye out for it.
---
you didn't mention that you will play a character that looks like Legolas and Arwen. 95% of the people playing in 04-06 were playing because of LOTR hype.
---
But... Frostshock is soo good!
---
If this is something that's easily reproducible this could literally bust the game.
---
Layering is NOT to deal with overcrowded starter zone.
---
It's to deal with the large decrease in players after the initial rush, to prevent dead servers.
---
Around 90% is to be expected, or as blizzard put it;
---
&gt; Most players don't make it to level 10
---
(Paraphrased)
---
Layering is there so you can have 3 servers in one to be merged at a later point.
---
It is NOT meant to alleviate the launch overcrowding. You will still be queuing for that named scorpid in valley of trials.
---
God yes. When they added this, I was in heaven. I specifically remember deleting a fairly high-leveled alt just because I wanted it lower on the list. :')
---
i think theres gonna be a lot of more world pvp. If you want pve challenge you're gonna be playing retail, not classic. But for pvp theres a lot of stuff which is fresher and different. Compared to vanilla i think way way more people who are playing classic for pvp and world pvp. pve is just there to gear up for pvp.
---
So this guy is playing WoW beta and asks why this game can be so bugged?  
---
Does he understand the meaning of a beta?  
---
Stop crying and just report it with the tool.
---
I’ll send you a message in a minute — you sound like a perfect fit for my guild!
---
Editted the original post with my source.
---
Not everyone camps you in the end they will waste time and get bored (if you stay in ghost until they leave for example). Most people gank you and move on.
---
If all the mobs are dead already you won't be pulling them any faster
---
Hey dude, what server are you gonna play on? I just want to make sure I avoid that one. Thanks.
---
Retail is actually good with BFA, not Legion good, but still good. And as the guy said, its exactly what you are calling for in your post, you can play 20hrs or less a week and be perfectly fine
---
Oh yes, totally. I leveled with a friend and he went enhance, so I decided to go elemental with int gear so I could heal dungeons. Big mistake.
---
Yeah exactly, the leveling process was a huge part of the game and not an arbitrary hoop you have to jump through.
---
It's a hard one to report meaningfully. "A guy on my team couldn't die," is a bit vague.
---
You were downvoted for the truth lol.
---
Vanilla wow started the whole "game starts at 60" trend
---
Alakazam was great for EQ at the time. Used it a bit for WoW, but Thottbot was just better.
---
I'm going to straight from Tirsfal to Silverpine at 13.  It can get rough over there but there are a few doable quests and a lowkey spot to level professions.  Then, I'm going to do 3-4 RFC runs at 16 turn all my shit in, go to TB and get my skills, do WC a bunch of times and them back to Silverpine, and get my SFK on.
---
It's not fast, but I think it's going to be the most sane way for me to do it, and I should have most of my old raid team around somewhere around so it ain't crazy rando city.  Plus vanilla dungeons are super fun.
---
Wrath was a much better overall expansion for all the reasons you said, but it was a more subtle improvement on TBC  than TBC was on vanilla.  Wrath also brought in a lot of the tools that killed the social element of the game.
---
it really needs to get noticed it's literaly gamebreaking
---
Hahaha true
---
Warrior OR druid really
---
That Horde over there.
---
Oh so it’s just a fail safe, got it.
---
lmfao you are retarded
---
No...just the group the hunter is in.
---
I wouldn't add dual spec necessarily, but lower penalty respeccing might be okay. Better yet, lower penalty respec if you complete a specific objective: say, you tank or heal a dungeon the cost goes down a bit; that would help the burden on healers and tanks who often need to respec for other things. :)
---
Yeah everything im reading says the switch's 4x ARM Cortex A57 destroys the Xbox 360 and PS3's CPUs...
---
I’d be mad at him for sitting around and masturbating all day. Like Christ, get a job or something.
---
It may be more fun to level with wf or as 1hand and shield. But the like I said it is mathematically more efficient to level with earthbind. Assuming you understand attack swings and how to effectively kite in a way that reduces the amount of times you get hit.
---
If you're the kind of person that likes proving people wrong and being stubborn then maybe warrior is the class for you after all ;P
---
Yes. Warrior is the only truely viable hybrid in vanilla.
---
the fuck you talking about? this is direct video evidence of what is specifically happening. People site these videos on bug reports constantly and blizz has even used them themselves
---
coming from someone playing on playing a warrior, this aint it
---
You can think it's good but, I'm not interested in playing it because it's not an mmorpg. It's in no way shape or form what I am asking for. I am saying their should be a version of classic where people who have jobs can play and, not be charged passed by no lifers.
---
To be clear I am intending on being a no lifer. I am just saying this would be a good idea for other people who don't want to play because they feel like they are being pressured to rush. By being forced to play on a server with people that are willing to play 12-16 hours a day.
---
Strat Live Orb runs for me and my guild has always been Round Robin. 
---
One drops - everyone rolls need. Whoever wins, the next orb that drops they pass on until everyone has one. Once everyone has one, everyone rolls need again. 
---
If you are having a hard time getting a tank for the run, some groups offer the first orb for the tank. 
---
Typically a couple drop, maybe 2 or 3. If you’re lucky, everyone gets an orb.
---
PLEASE

Oh I Member!

Transformable weapon enchantments should also survive transforming as well. That was fixed back around 1.6 or so.

---
I did this but can't see where to download classic, is it already available to download for the stress test?
---
What are those?
---
I was thinking the same but it might not be enough with the starter edition of wow? I get that we need the subscription but we might as well need to buy the game?
---
I'm loving the hell outta Gnomeragan's logo. Fits perfectly
---
That's been showcased on private servers. We don't even know of druids will be that great. It wouldn't take much mechanically to make them terrible. One thing for example is the parry chance is way higher on the beta. So using a MCP on a bear druid will get them hit a LOT more.
---
That's how an mmorpg works though... some play 12+hrs a day, some only a couple hours a day.
---
I'd choose the ooga gang for that quest
---
'Dragon kill points.' It's a player-managed system, where players are given points for things like attendance or killing bosses, and then spend those points to 'buy' the gear that drops. Sometimes this is done in a bidding system; rules vary from one guild to another.

As an outsider, I viewed it as you stating they're not fun to level as. Sure its a meaningless argument but in the future putting imo might save you some headaches.
---
I am also interested to know what Round Robin is!?
---
Agreed that 2-3 seemed to be the average per run from memory.
---
Im going rogue as main and huntard as alt I think. Would be awesome to play retri but i need a farmbot as an alt.
---
Usually you don't actually use the "round robin" loot setting since it can't distinguish between worthless green items and the orbs.
---
Just use the "group loot" setting. When the first orbs drops, everyone rolls. After you win an orb, you can't roll on any more orbs until everyone has one. Usually 2-4 drop each run. If you leave early you're likely to be blacklisted.
---
You might be able to use class rarity to reserve the first orb.
---
The difficulty curve on BFA is also off. I was fine because I’ve been playing off and on for a decade but for my family that started in bfa going from insultingly easy leveling to m (+) at 120 is a skill cliff, not a curve. Normal and heroic would be ok to practice but the gear is irrelevant after a couple warfronts and world quests.
---
In classic going from ZF, to BRD, to Strat, to UBRS isn’t like going into a whole new game.
---
Spirit of Redemption bug has been talked about a lot over the last couple of weeks.
---
OSRS is everything Classic ought to be aspire to be. The game is a perfect case study.
---
It's also a great example of why "no changes" is destined to kill the game. Private servers are frequently reset and don't need to maintain large player populations, neither of which are realities for Classic.
---
In the same way that OSRS is a good example of how Classic ought to be, it's also a great warning on what Classic shouldn't do. OSRS had massive initial hype but it very nearly died several months down the road before Jagex figured out that they actually needed to update their game. I'm worried that Blizzard isn't going to be nearly so smart about it and we'll have to deal with 1.12 for over a year before they renege on their promise to keep the game Vanilla-like, which will definitely siphon players off the game as fast as BfA ever did.
---
Poggers! 69 days away!
---
You don't want none of that inconvenience.
---
Yea but, a lot of people who can't play 12+ hours a day don't like that. Do you think it would be a bad thing for them to get a server?
---
It is not possible. I belive the cap for lvl 19 is rank 4 :)

You know that you can live without any carbs, right (let's keep fibers at least) ? Saying cells will starves to death is a big lie. I recommend you take a look at the ketogenic diet, also "The magic pill" documentary on Netflix if you can. All the diseases you see today like cancer, diabeties, and such are caused by high carbs (modern) diet.
---
Is wow classic a stand-alone game?
---
I always go for the whores! What...?
---
Hope you have a shit birthday you miserable cunt.
---
This is also a sub filled with private server players so don't take those numbers and think thats what the entire population of classic is going to look like and its not like all those 20k people are gonna be on the same server. Class population is going to vary from server to server. I have no doubt that rogues and hunters will be more popular than warlocks in general.
---
A fight? Count me in!
---
"Respecting" was expensive for sure you gotta earn it :D
---
Good once
---
It wouldn't be the way classic was, so yes it's a bad idea. If people can only devote 20hrs a week that's fine,  but you get passed by, which is also fine

Yep. That's what most groups agree on in my experience too.
---
The whole protection talent tree for Paladin is designed to make you a beast...after you get crit. Guess what's a tank's first and utmost priority when gearing up.  
---
Also the fact that you don't have any taunt ability is the nail in the coffin.  
---
You can however tank 5 mans all day every day, and when the tier 0.5 runs arrive you will be the hottest thing out there, due to your ability to actually deal great dps against undead on top of being able to tank.
---
The auto attack thing was me making a point.  You do know that there are other abilities besides auto attack right?  They still do amazing damage in aoe pulls like on ony.  
---
They won't be doing top tier dps, no.  But they will be doing enough to help clear a raid.  And you give them gear because they are in your guild.  How the loot is distributed is up to the raid, if they don't want to give it to the arms warrior until the other warriors are geared then sure... but DE'ing gear after other are geared is dumb.
---
You are just being an elitist try hard, when you yourself are more than likely going to be stuck in one of these guilds yourself.
---
Keep trying to act like 90% of guilds are going to gate off uncommon pve specs when that's never going to be the case.  The majority of guilds and players have always been and will always be casuals.

---
Can you elaborate? What causes the bug? Is it recreatable?
---
I 100% agree. This organic growth of death squads add a small bit of RP. Its like our own little inglorious bastards.
---
Most serious PvP players use deviate/noggenfogger tho, should they be removed since they hide gear then?
---
It's not hard to report meaningfully at all. Just be detailed.
---
Mage, always mage! Finally I get all my spells back wooooo!!
---
This is a way better idea than people just not giving a care about what other people do with their game time.  
---
Why change your attitude when you can tell a company to fix it for you?
---
Trick is, level a mage to gold farm to support your healer or tank. Its a time investment for sure, but classic and its likeliness to evolve beyond naxx is going to be around for the foreseeable future
---
Troll post ?
---
In this very case it is very unrealistic that anyone would want you in their raid. It wouldn't make any sense to have an arms warrior in your raid, especially not when you can respec to 2h fury and still use your "arms" gear. You must be a very stubborn person if you refuse to do this one simply thing that can actually help your guild/raid instead of gimping it.
---
Is summoning underwater in an awkward boat/ cave something that can be done?

Peace!
---
was envious of warlocks because they always got full tier sets first.  so few warlocks in classic, and they always got raid gear real easy, just had to sacrifice their bag space for shards to get purples.

Which in some places in the United States is well below the minimum wage.

Your not going to be a famous streamer

I will probably have multiple alts. Even in the live game leveling is one of my favorite things to do. I never did the endgame stuff in early wow so i will try it. Now i do M+ and it actually keeps the game exciting. So my plan is to level characters and do all the dungeons because dungeons are the most fun content for me. I am also excited to actually do quests in zones that i never did before the Cataclysm.
---
Same! The levelling is the fun part, for me. Getting new abilities. Attacking old quests and monsters with a new tool kit. Getting that sweet random upgrade. Guiding people through dungeons.
---
End game has always felt repetitive and boring to me.
---
"I got nothing to say so this guy must be retarded"  
---
ok dude. Just downvote me and get out of here lol.
---
Not sure why you'd say that. Protection paladin has the highest threat generation of all the tanks and they most definitely not go oom anywhere that fast.   
---
Paladin tank problem lies in the fact that he has no taunt (which has nothing to do with threat generation) and that half of his protection tree is based on him suffering crits to allow his procs to work, which is mutually exclusive with a tank's primary objective.  
---
But threat wise paladins are much more up there than warriors and druids.
---
Yea and pally's can have em for PvP. Especially the ones warriors don't really care for like Sulfuras and Ashkhandi. But guilds are not idiots for giving 2h weapons to others.
---
Argent Dawn tabard is the real /flex

I haven't looked into it too much, and I'm not on the beta so I haven't had the chance to play with it personally, but most people think this 1HP-unkillable bug is related to using Spirit of Redemption. As far as I know, nobody's been able to seamlessly/intentionally recreate it, but that was a few days ago I read that. Maybe someone's got the hang of what's causing it now.
---
I guess, but there's not a lot facts in Reddit comments, mostly opinions and guesses. Sure they can be fun to play but, Imo, they're such a pain compared to most other classes.
---
I don't understand why your comment seems so hostile because I could bounce that back at you. If the company were to give those people a server. Why should you worry about it? I mean could you just not care about the fact they have a server like that?

What you saw was correlation, not caudation.

Xp-locking was introduced in wotlk, which was the hay-day of twinking, and absolutely did not have queue time problems on active battlegroups. This version of twinking was so successful for many reasons, and the later drop off of popularity was caused by the removal of these aspects.

Fantastic class balance. Outside of the Enti's exploit, nearly every class -- when played at the highest level -- could beat each other, and every one had a place within warsong gulch. The only two outliers, shaman and warlock being stronger than others, really only amalgamated at the highest level of play, and could certainly be dealt with by 2 players. Arena skirmishes turned out to be a huge boon to twinks, as in most of its existence, there was no benefit for a leveler to join. It turned into a twink's dueling and 2v2 paradise on balanced maps, and a huge amount of skill expression was shown in these games.
---
Great gear choices: gear was at its most important moment during this expansion, with the inclusion of hit and expertise itemization. The balancing of standard stats and these anti-rng stats made gearing choices the most dynamic they had ever been. And for the barrier of entry, while the cost of enchanting for a twink had drastically decreased, in wrath heirlooms were attained by extensive badge farming at max level, or months of grinding Argent tournament dailies. While they were very powerful, Heirlooms took a vast amount of effort to attain.
---
In cataclysm, Blizzard overhauled the talent system and culled a huge amount of abilities from each class. This massive change completely obliterated the careful class balances that had been established over the last 6 years. Each class got access to a 31 talent instantly at 10, and this lead to massive imbalances. In cataclysm, see arcane mages spamming instant cast nuke spells and shadowstep rogues literally 1-shotting other twinks. This class imbalance has propagated throughout expansions and has never been fixed. In Legion, any retard disc priest could 1v10 an entire battleground while never ooming, dying, and killing the entire enemy team.
---
Even so, the twink scene still lived on. Due to the massive single class imbalances, the only high level of play available was in full 10 on 10 premades. Solo-queueing a bg would result in such imbalanced games there was no point. At this point, "in-house" games became very popular, where people would craft balanced teams from a big group of players and use war games to ensure the teams stayed even. The existence and popularity of the Twink Cup tournament at this time demonstrated it.
---
Gear changes: heirloom items, which in wotlk took immense effort with a max level character, were changed to only cost a miniscule amount of gold. With xp-off, 0 character planning went into making twinks, and at this point a single twink could solo getting all of their gear. There was no barrier of entry for full bis characters.
---
Additionally, changes in Legion caused gear stats to completely not matter, the only benefit being item level. The bis rings for all classes were white wedding rings. There is no twink identity when changes like this are made.
---
And the pet can/will tank mobs while you gather, then dismiss/feign if running isn't an option.
---
this post again
---
OP is talking about PvP. Not pve.
---
Blocked attacks can't be crits or crushing blows
---
In the same boat, can’t decide between human mage or Nelf Rogue. Mages wear dresses while rogues look dope plus nelf gets better race mount. Can’t decide !!
---
CTS main is true but 15 agi in main hand??!?
---
Do you have to be autistic to type alternate caps or did you have to practice?
---
Argent Dawn Tabard MasterRace
---
Orbs are usually in the neighborhood of like, 30g? In the maybe 50+ times I've run stratholme, I've also never seen a person who 'bailed' after getting one. (Maybe partially because sometimes you can get lucky, and end up getting 5+ orbs.)   
---
But also because a community of a couple thousand people is smaller than you think. If people behaved like that, the players who got 'burned' wouldn't just hold it against the player who did it. They'd be likely to hold it against that player's entire guild. (You'd also see players sending messages to that person's guildmaster complaining and warning about the reputation their guild is getting.)
---
Classic is coming.
---
Yeah not reading that
---
as long as there is not a curse on the healers yes. sometimes you cast a rank 1 or rank 4 frostbolt to try for a clear cast on max rank if the fight lasted too long because of failing mechanics.
---
No, I just had no idea people would be so hostile to this. To me it seemed completely anodyne.
---
Argent Dawn tabard is the real /flex bro
---
I lost at character customization since I'm below minimum height for caucusian male :(
---
&gt;Where are you getting that info? Because all ive seen is that the switch beats PS3 and Xbox 360 massively in everything.
---
Again, as far as graphics go yes, it does. CPU-wise, no, the CPU is generally actually slower. The info comes from just calculating the numbers from the specs of both. I'd be really curious to see what you're seeing that says the Switch's CPU is better.
---
&gt;And again, classic wow is less intensive than FF14.
---
And again, it's only less GPU intensive. Just like how Doom and Wolfenstein that you mentioned earlier are vastly more GPU intensive but require much less CPU power, which is the reason they run on the Switch at all.
---
Woah dude hold up I wasn’t coming at you or anything. Saying, “I like this” is totally different from saying “this is better than that trash”
---
Which is what this post and others have implied and why there is even people discussing toxicity in here. You don’t see these conversations in posts that aren’t trying to push another thing down. 
---
Either way we are just discussing things so no need to come in swinging.
---
Pssst, don't tell them.
---
Yeah oops. That's what I meant
---
I wish I remembered my old login info. I made a new account because I hadn’t played in so long I couldn’t remember even my username.
---
You don't have to make people do it. People will just naturally start doing it on their own in the manner I have described above. Eventually, you will be feeling like you won't be able to compete on meters unless you follow suit and get world buffs. That is perfectly fine if you are okay with it. But most DPS players tend to get buffs as well since they like competing on meters.
---
And Paladins can't block?
---
Honestly, sometimes its not helpful to help your faction on launch. When you're competing for mobs and don't feel like grouping with them whether it be for XP reasons or item drop reasons, I don't want to help him kill mobs faster so he can attempt to tag more. i want him to go as slow as possible.
---
Sorry, Warrior spending 5 minutes on one mob while you hamstring kite. You're alone there atleast until the launch rush is over.
---
And what exactly is the source on that?
---
i cannot wait for the glorious tarren mill v  southshore battles
---
Jesus. I jumped on a private server to just play each class to 15 or so and see what I wanted to do this go around... All alliance classes later, I've ruled out nothing.
---
I played a Warrior for most of Vanilla, TBC, and WotLK but I want to try a new class.
---
I really like the idea of buffing random strangers, so I'm gonna roll either a Priest or a Druid. And I REALLY like this idea, so I'm gonna spec improved Fort/Divine Spirit as a Priest or Improved MotW as a Druid, even for levelling.
---
It requires a Sub to play.
---
I remember that its’ wings got in the way of everything. Other than that it was a good pet. I think that cats had higher DPS but IDK.
---
You realize you can eat absolutely nothing but egg whites every day, and your body will take the liberty of converting them to carbs for you?  Your body is 100% operated on carbs.
---
Dietary carbs should be eaten in moderation, but are indispensable for extreme endurance.  Go take a three day backpacking trip one day eating nothing by fat/protein and let me know how your energy level is doing at the end.  Now repeat this with 30% dietary carbohydrates and compare.
---
Kind of loses its appeal when it's your own screenshot you're posting, lol
---
Pretty much just Shadowstrike/Thunderstrike and Anathema/Benediction. Lok'delar/Rok'delar originally was a transformable but they eventually split it into a Staff and Bow respectively since it was a bit more awkward to use than the other two.
---
However enchantments you put on them would be lost when you transformed the weapons, essentially forcing you to stick with one form OR not enchant the weapon.
---
Pretty sure this relates to the spirit form priests get when they die, or are supposed to die.
---
Wikipedia and google. I haven't found a single source saying the switch doesn't beat xbox 360 and ps3 in every department.
---
But he is also not you suck at cooking. Those are two different guys
---
This correct and it’s pretty difficult to pull off reliably. Probably not worth considering for raiding.
---
Completely uneducated guess here, but 1.12 is supposed to be based on a somewhat modern version of their engine, whereas private servers just use an older image of WoW at whatever version they host.  They probably tweak things, but I doubt they ever got down to the engine level to overhaul performance to any significant degree.
---
So my completely wild guess would be that classic will run quite a bit better than private servers.
---
I’m not sure now. I’d always heard that owls were the lowest DPS of the DPS pets, but now I’m hearing otherwise so I may have been misinformed.
---
Not seeing anything you are talking about, but ok
---
I mean, I'm sure it's meant to solve more than one problem. But I hadn't put much thought into that angle before, but it makes sense.
---
Mr. T suggests you play the Night Elf Mohawk
---
But it wasn't my original post, I made a comment and screenshot it here
---
" human has a tiny bonus to 2 wep types "  
---
With the most recent information about weapon skill, it is even more impactful than originally thought. It is sadly not a tiny bonus. Spoken as someone who likes to play Nelf warrior, its not looking great for us.
---
Unpopular opinion.. I don't think nodes/herbs belong to the person who killed the closest proximity mob to it.
---
I don't remember someone or blacklist them for doing that. I should have looked around and checked before someone was nearby if I need to clear more mobs to get to it, and then we'll stare off as I wait for him to get bored and leave or grab the mob.
---
This doesn't make any sense to me since this 2 types of players don't even meet.   
---
You are never in the same lvl bracket (bar alts) you are never going to be doing dungeons together or raid together so wtf is the deal here?
---
The Wikipedia pages for the Switch doesn't say anything about it's CPU being more powerful than the 360's or PS3's. What exactly are you reading that says the Switch's CPU is more powerful? Surely you can copy/paste one of the links you read.
---
I got infernals to drop in gold shire.
---
DABUU
---
If I go mage it'll be human, but if I go rogue it'll be dwarf. Dwarves are badass and I never see them as rogues.
---
Ahh I see. That had to suck prior to change lol.
---
Much easier time forming groups, plus you secure the main cloth user spot in the group so you can pretty much get all the caster gear by not inviting any others. Not the worst trade off imo.
---
So where's that info? Who hit number one on twitch while playing Nostalrius? Most I've ever seen was barely 100 viewers before Twitch shut them down for streaming a private server.
---
&gt; First things first lets go quest, roll up on the quest giver, oh wait I can't immediately grab the quest, it's writing it out as a note, I've got to read it, then I can accept it.
---
Turn on "Instant Quest Text."  Defaults to off, which makes the text fade in slowly.  With it on you can once more accept quests without waiting, although it doesn't auto-accept quests like retail.
---
As for the difficulty, Vanilla leveling is harder in general but what class you pick and your experience level with the class determines the difficulty, even in the early levels.  Stand closer to max range from whatever and by the time it reaches you auto shot will have it down to 1/3 health, that goes for just about everything in the starting area.  Hunter is relatively hard until 10 since the pet is such a big part of your ability to do anything, but most of the difficulty you seem to be having is just from making noob mistakes.
---
In comparison I got to level 7 in an hour and a half and never really felt like I was threatened.  I was on a shaman but the playstyles aren't that different at that point.  Competition for spawns will slow you down but that's player density more than an intrinsic quality of the game.
---
My retail guildies are huge troll nerds, so when levelling with them, I'll likely roll troll shammy. But my undead priest absolutely will be going this route as well.
---
But it wasn't my original post, I made a comment and screenshot it here, why is that less appealing?
---
Resist DPS
---
Fuck BFA!! Long live classic!!
---
So start it at 11AM PST which is 7PM CET. Best of both worlds. The daytime US crowd and the peak EU evening crowd. It's still a day time test so the same team will be present. It just starts a bit earlier.
---
I found one once or twice, that's it. Super rare!
---
So many retail-stans say the game starts at Max level, but the only reason is because the leveling experience is so dumbed down. Leveling was always supposed to be your training and a journey.
---
The hostility you're assuming is all on you.
---
i personally don't care much about it anymore.
---
WoW was pulled down from Nvidia streaming service and doubt it will be available on any other as it can be used to hide cheat apps.
---
In my opinion Druid was the most fun out of those. Mage does more damage, you’re basically just hitting 1-2 spells to build up something to fuel a third spell. It’s fun for a little while but gets repetitive and all three specs are like that (at least at lower levels). Warrior is interesting and it felt like you got to use more abilities than Mage while also having more diverse specs. Warriors can also be fun tanks (more fun than Druid imo) if you plan on leveling through dungeons. Druids, with their 4 specs are able to do every role and may be a good choice if you want to take the time to play them all. Overall I liked druids more because they could heal, tank, and stealth. Druids still feel like the old game when each class had a lot more spell options.
---
from my exp on pservers it's round robin but ONLY on the orbs. Typically tank gets the first orb because tanks, but after that everyone who hasn't gotten an orb yet roll on each drop, until 5 orbs has dropped(that rarely happens though) and then you go again. Note that tanks don't have the chance to get more than 1 until 5 has dropped, they just get the first one automatically and then pass next 4.
---
These are all compelling reasons to go alliance.
---
More compelling reasons;
---
Pally&gt;shaman
---
Pally buffs&gt;totems
---
Terrain in AV favors alliance Zerg.
---
When did you play?
---
It can be summed up as “if players can do it, they will”.  If they CAN genocide the rabbits, they will.  
---
It’s the same thing that basically caused Red is Dead in WoW.  You have no meaningful interaction with the other faction beyond killing them.
---
Tank paladins lack both the abilities **and** itemization to be successful. The gear just isn't there.
---
Thanks for the work.
---
I think its safe to say that I should be fine with my Ryzen 5 2600x, 16gb 3000mz RAM and GTX 1070 :)
---
The other downside is absolutely dismal to play in raid. Spam shadowbolts but you can't actually spam so you will rip Aggro so you have to meticulously cast shadowbolts while watching the threat meter.
---
Classic failing is about the same odds as gravity failing.
---
Christ that one hurts xD. I do this all the time.
---
Get a dog lil' longie, get a dog
---
I think now that I’m older I would tolerate it better. 15 year olds don’t necessarily think like that.
---
N i c e
---
I have a similar era but slightly worse AMD laptop that can still push the retail client at mostly bare minimum settings. Really pretty smoothly runs low level zones and dungeons, BGs and Raids it dips down below 30 though for sure.
---
I type all of this to offer that I reckon my brave little toaster will still hold its own in what ought be a gentler role come time for Classic. If it can do it then a still running i5 ought do the trick, so log as you don’t mind jagged edges and frame dips during intense moments!
---
She should have married a chad Shadow Priest.
---
Chadow Priest.
---
Filthy dps players...
---
In soviet Russia game plays you!
---
You are correct. Classic wow is not undertuned.  Private servers are overtuned though and thus achievements there are probably more difficult than classic. 
---
However, abusing world buffs are a massive thing in pservers and not as easy to do in classic and those make quite a significant difference.
---
I doubt Google will allow cheat software on their servers. That is just asking for a backdoor.
---
It was mostly the girlfriend yes lol
---
It's 14 years later i still masturbate all day, somethings never change
---
It's not a jump through, you literally jump to your death on the north edge of Dun Morogh, putting your body *technically* in the wetlands.
---
You Rez and Menethil, walk/swim across from the GY and hop the boat, no Rez sickness under lvl 10 so gg
---
It does per hit, but the frost buff is a chance on hit like windfury, not every hit.
---
Mouse Machine is the best for this !
---
more of a Gnome post, they are always short on time
---
Nope. Played a lot of rogue in vanilla, raided, zg trinket, pvp gear. A bad player will die sure, but a good warrior, Pali or druid cannot die. They might not be able to kill you but they won't die. Hunters and mages you can win or lose based on their spec, with zg trinket you can just blow up a poorly geared mage or Hunter or priest honestly, but if they are pvp geared they will survive the stuns and play their controls and it's a lot more even. Honestly rogues are great before gear starts scaling too hard. Your damage doesn't scale as fast as hp for many classes and you have to start getting really creative.
---
If you honestly can't tell how finishing a sentence with "Why change your attitude when you can tell a company to fix it for you?" could be seen as hostile and condescending...
---
I mean it is an assumption on my part but, it seems reasonable.
---
Long enough for the GF to solve the problem herself.
---
lol, sorry to hurt your feelings bro. But don't worry, if you play arms in pve, we're likely never going to speak to each other anyway lol.
---
Uh cast bar addons were in vanilla buddy
---
ITT: Every class WoW Classic has.
---
Thanks man! Appreciate the support
---
EU servers from NA. No streamers and insanely bad ping, truly classic experience.
---
Having played with some of those people as I leveled later alts in Vanilla, they were still mostly quite bad.
---
&gt;oom a minute into a fight
---
So longer than the length of most vanilla fights. Really you can get enough mana restoring consumes for this to never be an issue but elemental's biggest problem is not having nature damage be in curse of the elements, meaning you need to wait until the spell penetration gear from AQ to be particularly useful. It's lots of fun in BGs, though.
---
I'm sure the longer queues definitely put a lot of people off but there is undeniably a lot of players who only did it to beat players who had no chance of fighting back and quit when they couldn't be the big fish in the baby pool.         
---
I know this because I tried twinking at 19 and the only reason I did it was to be a god in BG's but although it was fun getting BiS I got bored with it after like 2 or 3 BG's, just felt like playing with cheat codes on.
---
I feel like the easiest benchmark is "If you can't comfortably run retail WoW, you might want to finally upgrade off your 2010 toaster."
---
The idea is to have 102.4% avoidance (including block), so that a level 63 never gets you with a full hit.  Warriors have shield block that increases their block chance by 75% for two attacks.  As it has a 5 second cooldown, you can keep it up most of the time against single targets.
---
While you unlock Poisons at level 20, I don't think it's fair to call it a level 20 weapon enhancement. At level 60, your instant poison is level 60.
---
He's likely more invested and cares more about the game getting fixed than most of the people you can think of. I'm pretty sure he's done his fair share of bug reporting.
---
In Vanilla, I recognized people by their gear, way before their face/hair (if that was even visible).
---
on the classic one you just added everyone for no reason though. 10 ‘friends’ which will probably get deleted later on. sure you had more interaction with others, but i highly doubt you actually made any friends.
---
Priest. 
---
Getting the raid invite to the raid, even when you’re blatantly late, is always fun!
---
Guys all you really need are sugar-free gummie bears. All this bullshit about fiber is a waste of time. Just eat a handful of sugar-free gummie bears.
---
Reducing annoying things like pathing issues , using AH quicker, mail system not being click each fucking item etc
---
Anything that will save us energy **yet does not change the base mechanics of the game**.
---
I don't want raiding and atunement and my class in general to be made as simple and quick as possible, but things like the AH (where you have to spend some of your time if you plan to have your gold for mounts) could be improved from vanilla's version without having a negative impact on the game.

From the PS3 wiki it has  230.4 GFLOPS. The switch docked destroys it in that.
---
At this point id be posting every website that google finds, because pretty much in every single link someone points out that thinking the PS3 is stronger in any form than the switch is laughable.
---
TLDR; The switch is in between PS3 and PS4 in every department.
---
But please show me any of your sources saying the PS3 is stronger than the switch, even though the switch is stronger than the WIIU and XBOX 360.

And there are others wanting to build PCs with 2004 specs. Those posts pop up here and there.

For nowadays hardware picks - AMD APU like R3 2200G is more than capable. Doesn't need a dedicated GPU and is cheap (integrated Vega 8 is around GT 1030; plus second hand marked is flooded with Polaris AMD cards which supersede low end nvidia and integrated graphics). Even Athlon 200GE and latest Intel iGPU should be able to run it easily on lower (&lt;= mode 3) settings although if you buying - pick the better value of R3 2200G. Recommending old GPU is risky as right now WoW does require DX11 capable graphics card (and some old Nvidia cards even if marked as DX11 may not meet the required feature level - like GTX 5XX already shows an unsupported warning). Plus old hardware does age and may affect system stability or longevity after a second hand no-warranty purchase.

This whole "toxic" talk is retarded. What are people trying to achieve by calling something toxic? I don't get that. It's just a limp-wristed way of saying you don't like how something makes you feel.
---
As a chemical engineer intern you can make around that but I see most of them in my are $22 to $25 an hour
---
Yeah, it was probably one of those "had the mats and am poor" things at the time that I just never changed.
---
Yeah it’s good in PvP for sure, sorry for underselling that. The question seemed more aimed at whether or not NE spriest would be gimp and I really do t think it is. Strongest is Troll for the healing debuff but spriest are nasty in PvP regardless
---
&gt;He isn't planning on shitting in a bucket attatched to his chair on release to maximize XP efficiency
---
&gt; I am saying that world buff addictions slowly engulf your raid group unless you actively try to stop it.
---
Then I will actively stop it and kick anyone who starts complaining about it.
---
Mathematically doesn't account for variables that pop up all the time in leveling.
---
Hell yeah, riposte was amazing in pvp.
---
Yes, I made a twink at first for the same reason as you,  it got boring quickly,  it became much more fun to outplay enemy twinks
---
In vanilla 95% of BGs weren’t Twinks and I am 100% sure about that. Every game there was only 1 or 2 of them, that would swing a huge advantage to whatever side they were on. This made the games super unbalanced and unfun.
---
People leveling up to 60 sometimes wanna hop in a BG and have some fun and Twinks always ruined it. If you spent that much time getting gear for a twink, why not do it for a level 60 where it is more complex?
---
This isn't a rule by far, just etiquette if I can clearly see the intent of someone fighting for that node etc. In other cases it probably will go down as you just said. There are some jerks tho *looking at the stealthed rogue waiting for things to clear up*
---
I keep moving my mouse to the "sort bags" button in the Classic beta. It never realized how much I used it.
---
Basically every first video on internet
---
The thing is that you can bring most of those class-unique things with a better spec. 
---
An enh shaman doesn't really bring anything that a resto shaman can't. A ret paladin doesn't really bring anything that a holy paladin can't.
---
In the end, you'll be able to clear all of the content with less viable specs but it will be harder. Most people will prefer to bring an optimal comp if they can instead of having to carry, unless they're friends ofc.
---
It's vanilla, they all do. They're the most fun to play in pvp, though.
---
Who needs fiber when you have no more waste to relieve yourself of?
---
Its true...all of it.
---
&gt; It is a mechanic that was designed to get people to log back in.
---
Regardless of what it is designed to do, it still incents logging off by the system itself. In the same vein I could argue that World Buffs are designed to make raiding more accessible to those without good gear (it does).
---
&gt; I don't care about the semantics. I never said "this is an exploit". 
---
You didn't say it, but you are supporting the arguments of those who have. They are saying it is an exploit because that is the ONLY justification for removing it from the game. There are systems that I think are bad design as well (Like DKs for example) but that doesn't mean they should be removed. It doesn't matter what *you* think is good for the game - again this is why #nochanges exists. I don't think world buff stacking is bad business because only the most hardcore are going to buff and raid log - you don't need to worry about losing those subscribers.
---
Personally I think world buffs are great because they get people out into the world and doing things. It also gives incentives for guilds to run content they have already completed - which is good because it helps people catch up. I wont say most guilds, but certainly many guilds just get the world buffs RIGHT before raiding - they don't normally log out as you are arguing.
---
I don't know much about you, just this post. Going off that I'd put my gold on you not making it to 60.
---
&gt;running past allies while leveling
---
Ah yes, a tank is so useful while *running past people leveling*
---
Juat play your 20h and let us no lifers play hundreds of hour per week
---
Not going to waste time with you since you clearly are not very level headed.
---
From what I know a Priest or Paladin would be better for heals, but windfury and shaman utility is pretty nice for just a bit less single target healing ability.

It’s the technique that the top players use for speed leveling with the fastest times.

This would make my switch go from my least used console to my most used console...just for casual leveling when I’m chillin in bed or traveling or getting my knob slobbed
---
I feel attacked.
---
TBH after playing WoW since release and every expansion, Legion was the best if not tied for best expansion, and a lot of people agree. They introduced a lot of amazing mechanics. The Mage tower challenges and Mythic + were really fucking fun. You missed out. I don’t know how they turned the game from amazing to shit in one expansion but they did.
---
&gt; You are just being an elitist try hard  
---
Why am I being an "elitist try hard" for stating something so basic and logical? Arms is bad in PvE and any other class/spec will be considered/chosen over you, if possible.  
---
I mean, if you manage to get in a raid and get loot as an arms warrior, good for you. But don't be surprised if you dont.
---
Best paladin in the fucking world okay? 
---
Shwooop round the corner

I can offer to tank.
---
Warriors have shield block. This skill gives you +75% chance to block the next 2 attack for the next 5 secs, and it has a 5 secs cd, so, unless the boss attacks every 2 seconds the warrior will block ALL attacks.
---
The closer thing paladins have is Redoubt and Holy shield. The first talent gives you +30% block chance for the next 5 attacks after being critically hit. The other one is 30% chance to block 4 attacks for 10 secs. So a paladin needs to get critically hit to have a +60% block chance. 
---
If mitigating crushing blows is the priority, warriors are the best at that.
---
Although, I don't know if getting one crushing blow every 10 seconds is the only thing that makes paladin tanks not viable. I would like to try it on classic
---
Ah, wand or pet standing on spawn it is then.
---
Of course, Shadow Priests were OP in classic but i dont remember them being that OP
---
Regarding your first point, you're the exception not the rule when it comes to twinking. When Blizzard put xp off players into their own queue it devastated the twinking community because the vast majority were primarily interested in crushing undergeared players. Sure you could sometimes get them to do a twink v. twink game, but that was definitely not their primary motivation.
---
1.12 client uses DX9 and aged poorly - it still works but depending on GPU (usually Nvidia) may show artifacts. Aside of that the performance is much lower than on the current beta client. The only bad thing that the beta Classic game engine has from retail is the transparency effects that can limit the performance a lot if placed in your field of view.
---
Says the 'rogue' (flair)
---
Rogue, Mage, and Druid for me.
---
In a perfect world...
---
The best answer here. Never played WC3 or cared about the lore as a kid. Only recently in the past 5 months have I been learning about it and it's retroactively making my previous wow experiences that much more rich. A lot of dots connecting. Super excited to get another iteration this August where I actually understand the context of the different people groups and overarching plots.
---
If soul shards and summons didn't exist I would instantly roll a Warlock. But unfortunately they do so I'm rolling a Mage. 
---
Mages are also fast levelers, they're top tier gold makers, top tier in pve &amp; pvp, and most importantly they have insane QoL improvements like portals and free drinks &amp; mana gem. Portals in vanilla are a godsend as you'll come to find out.
---
... because it already vacated itself unexpectedly while you were in church?
---
ikr?! my heart skipped a beat for real
---
Yeah I'm a big fan of that ability. If you have Preparation, and all your main CD's down, you can get two Ripostes with one parry. Big DPS time.
---
Ok enough about this poop talk. Is this legit? If this drops on the Nintendo switch I am buying one.
---
Something me doing?
---

---
Shadow Oil procs end up being about 4% to 5% of your total damage. Add Dragonbreath Chili to that (which also scales with SP buffs) and you're looking at another 2%.
---
Without the buffs, your best option is Instant Poison, which rarely ever reaches 2% of your total damage.
---
So going through the trouble of getting SP is worth 3x the damage of your poisons.
---
Kind of disappointing. I was too young to know about addona rly. But I thought having to figure out what the other person was casting was a huge part of the skill
---
Would be a must buy. Grinding alts on the toilet all day until my intestines fall through my asshole sounds like a dream
---
Shh
---
I'd buy the hell out of that in a second.
---
He's honestly pretty right
---
I really don't like summit tbh, mostly because he does things like letting his idiotic chat tell him not to play a shaman, but sooooo many people are elitist about this game now cuz of retail
---
I really hope by the time AQ drops there's guilds with fucking druid tanks, shadow priests, ele and enhance shamans, ret paladins all progressing and crushing raids and a pace similar to guilds min-maxing 
---
If I took 90 seconds longer to kill each boss because I chose to have people in my raid grp that are actually cool, even though they play ret pala or prot pala or fuckin disc priest, I'll take that all day
---
I'm gonna stop worrying about that shit, as I have been guilty of it too. Obviously, can't raid MC or BWL as fire mage, BUT YOU BETTER BELIEVE IM A DAMN FIRE MAGE EVERY OTHER SECOND OF MY CLASSIC EXISTENCE BOIS LETS GOOOO
---
Fetch me the Hot Pocket stretcher!
---
People still think back porting from Legion was a good decision lmao?
---
Why they didn't make OG 1.12 compatible with their modern systems is beyond me.
---
The excuse they gave that there would be "invisible issues" pretty much sounds like another bullshit by Activision in my books.
---
It also gives them the excuse to keep in modern tech such as sharding and layering, since that wouldn't be possible if they went with 1.12.
---
On top of that the cancer that is sharding/layering, you're seeing all these bugs and incosistencies such as this bug, melee leeway, hunter dead zone, incorrect spell animations, incorrect AV lighting.
---
But hey let's keep chanting "It'S JuSt bEtA" folks!
---
Yea and most of the people will be playing the more viable specs, Im saying its not going to hurt if you bring a few of the less optimal ones.
---
People keep saying this to me. Did I write my post wrong? Because a vast majority of servers I'm sure would still be unlimited. I'm talking about a secondary server type like RP or RP-PVP servers.
---
I see you are an enlightened person of culture.
---
Original Vanilla had the level 20 10day trial. Why would it be level 10 now?
---
The first two links only talk about total system performance which primarily comes from GPU performance, not CPU. The third link actually has comments talking about how the 360, PS3, and Wii U CPUs are more powerful than the Switch's. In fact, there's also comments in there talking about how the Switch in undocked mode is actually slightly less powerful than the PS3 overall instead of just having a less powerful CPU.
---
So again, what sources are you reading that say the **CPU** is more powerful? Not the GPU, not total system performance, the **CPU**.
---
The thing that was cool about AV wasn’t necessarily sticking around for the whole battle, it was jumping into a war in progress. Then hopping out when you needed to and potentially even returning for the grand finale. If you stayed for an entire match then god bless you, that is some fortitude.
---
I personally try to encourage people to be less shitty. Even if it just in the internet.
---
1.13 client should run faster. I benchmarked retail on Pentium J5005 and that's an atom-alike CPU with cut down modern iGPU that due to cut-down has problems with beating full HD3000/4000/5000 iGPUs depending on scenario.
---
&gt; even if it means playing a race they normally wouldn’t just because it gives them .005% of an advantage in certain situations.
---
More like 5%+ Off by several orders of magnitude there.
---
If you're gonna belittle people, why can't you at least be accurate?
---
Hehe. I personally like the dwarf look. Shout out to an old friend wolford. Dwarf warrior looked awesome back in the day. I'll be dwarfing it up in honor of him.
---
So you will force your way of playing on the raid group just like an elitist.
---
This is really great stuff! 
---
Also it's reminding me how jealous I was of my friends 9800 GT back in the day and confirming that I was right to be. It's still good enough to fuck around in IF!
---
The body is able to convert it's own carbs like you say. So why do you want to add more, especially bad ones like starch and raffined carbs?
---
It's been a year I'm on a keto diet, I do intermitent fasting and I fast for a week  regularly and train fasted also.  My body is fat adapted I eat less than 20gr net carbs a day and my form and endurance are amazing. You can compare those diet but if the test subject has been on a carb diet all his life then his body is not fat adapted it can take lots of month of strict ketosis to do so, but one you are fat adapted you are an endurance machine, trust me.
---
No, it started in vanilla.
---
Shadowmeld is OP af in BG's
---
because the time spent gearing a twink is minimal compared to leveling to 60, and raiding once a week to maybe get the gear you need
---
Well I mean, I hadn't played classic in 11-12 years at this point. Good for you though
---
&gt;How is your shit so bugged that someone won’t die
---
Buddy, you do know you’re playing the beta, right?
---
Where are the moonfires!? That close together and it should be and endless sky of silvery white and crits
---
Thanks for the reply.
---
If you look at my reply to another comment on my post, you can read why the xp off changes were not the problem that cause the twinking community crash.
---
It is touchscreen
---
Can you send me one of the mid range pc’s you built? XD
---
It would have to be an add-on to chrome.
---
The client.
---
Yes he was one of the best paladins in the world at the time.
---
This is what happens when you stream for longer than 24 hours a lot and let twitch chat get to you. Dude has been streaming too much.
---
Probably because there's no good way to respond to someone that's taking a joke too seriously.
---
Loved every second of it. An immersive world.
---
add Durrian#1563 brother, I got a big group of similar people and we are going to need players like you!
---
hey look! your anecdotal evidence contradict my anecdotal evidence! guess we can't use anectodal evidence and hence must rely on the widespread behavior we all see and agree is present on the internet nowadays! ( hint, a lot of people on this sub complain about said behavior!)
---
I linked the video elsewhere of my fedex route from that post. Not the one you're looking for (2-3 hours) but it's the kind of thing you're looking to do.
---
UI improvements. Like 90% of the modern UI could be brought back for Classic and would have zero impact on gameplay or community building. It'd just mean I didn't have to install 30 different addons for basic things like class colors in chat, buff/debuff timers, enemy cast bars, or a useful trade skill interface. All of these things are easily done by addons, and indeed were done by addons I used in Vanilla. Just make a button in the UI options that defaults to on that says "Vanilla-like UI" but let people turn those things on if they want to. It's just a hassle and waste of time to force people to use addons for things that are already base UI in future versions.
---
It comes out at the same time world wide, similarly to bfa
---
Every 1000 ms is a second delay so you will have a pretty noticeable delay.
---
"You are not going to be an Enhancement shaman with Sulfuras." 
---
Watch me.
---
Right above play you switch to the client/stress test using the drop down menu
---
WF is a flat 20% to proc, so it really helps.
---
Your shaman will also be able to use chain lightning and magma totem to great effect on multi-mob pulls.  
---
3 or 4 regular mobs at a time and you guys will be able to kill an elite mob with 2 adds like you need to do for some group quests.
---
Sometimes you will want to use a shield and one hander with defensive stance if the mobs hit hard  on some elite quests.
---
It might be in your battlenet launcher if you signed up for the classic wow beta.
---
Just give me the extra mailboxes.
---
You can say Warriors may as well go Paladin then... the point of choosing a class isn't only dependent on their rotation while leveling. There's also the fact that you'd be switching factions if you "Might as well play pally"
---
&gt; That is an unreasonable target for alts since there is a chance you won't ever "max out" your main in the first place.
---
In the original iteration of the game, sure, because the game was basically on a "timer" due to TBC coming out.
---
This time around it would be conceivable to max out every single class because as far as we know, once all the content is out, we'll just have the servers sit there for years.  Unless they announce new content (very doubtful) or TBC servers (I doubt it, but more likely than brand new content I think), you're going to have a pretty long time to max out anything you want.
---
Just look up a leveling guide.
---
Hey, I never said not a single person won't be able to do this. I said 98% wont, and if you end up doing it, Ill be proud of you and give you props. But, for majority of the people, not likely.
---
Warlock, then level up a priest alt with a buddy running dungeons
---
If your bashing the stormlight archive, we might have to fight.
---
Yeah, you do that, then when it lands on one you'll realize you actually want to play another class more.  Happens every time :P
---
So about the hunter rotation, what this guy is saying is really dumbed down. Yes you use your aimed shot and multi-shot on cooldown, but you have to use it so you dont lose dps. Hunters rely on their auto shots to do dmg, and how the auto shot works is that theres the cd (around 2.8) depending on your wep, but because of your quiver it will always be lower. You want as slow a weapon as possible. So after the 2.8 secs, theres a 0.5-1 sec charge time on your auto. This means you have to always be aware of when your next auto will hit so you dont lose time as the auto shot cd is doesnt follow your spells. This means that you should never use aimed shot and then instantly use multishot as youll lose out on auto shots and youll go oom. So the best rotation is auto shot-&gt; aimed shot (start with an auto so you dont instant get aggro and have to fd)-&gt;auto shot-&gt;multishot-&gt; and then you use them when they get out of cd, but lets say your aimed shot comes up when theres 1 secs left of the cd on your auto shot. Well aimed shot takes 3 secs to cast, so if you use it then, youll lose out on an auto shot, which is most of your dmg. And you dont want to use multishot close to the auto shot as that will also delay the auto shot most of the time. 
---
This mechanic means that its easy to be a okay hunter, hard to be a good hunter, and really hard to maximize your dmg as theres also your pet, which you have to keep alive as healers dont heal them. So other than just the 3 spells and the tranq shot which is important on some bosses, you have to keep track of your pet. You can ofc choose to send your pet in at the start and hope it doesnt die soon, but most of the time it will. 
---
But his mechanic also makes it so hunter is one of the most fun classes to play, as you can just keybind 1 spell to your scroll wheel and then do top dps, like mages or locks. 
---
But sadly after all this work, hunters will forever be the worst dps, unless your guild brings meme specs (rets, moonkins, more than 1 spriest, enhancement and ele shamans and the shit feral who thinks he can play but doesnt put the time it takes into it.)
---
But all in all hunter is fun af and youre 1 of 2 classes who have a sick questline at 60 where you have to do it yourself (unless you pay a hunter to carry you ofc, which if you can raid shouldnt be nessesary´)
---
Bfa players complain classic raid are too easy and only require time.
---
Classic players complain that Bfa and previous expansion have no soul and is not an MMO but a hack and slash.
---
Now imagine classic wow with level design of bfa raid bosses would it be good?
---
True but there is no possible way Blizz doesn't already know about the bug.  AV weekend had some groups pushing with a bugged priest.
---
Tanya
---
add Durrian#1563
---
I've got a large group of friends, trying to form a semi-serious ACTIVE guild to do end game content with!
---
Storytelling is much better in the current game. Probably the biggest thing, going from Wc3 to Wow there were basically no cut scenes or voice overs or anything.
---
You can play casually and be fine. Just have to find the same-minded people. Trust me, there was a lot of them back in Vanilla, and there will be a lot of them (myself included) now.
---
3pm pst the 26th
---
Most clever bots use OCR so they can find fish schools by seeing their appear on the screen. Or follow a path on the map and "see" nodes or herbs. (there are reasons why there are sometimes nodes floating high in the air to distract/detect such bots). So you only need the display output which you get from the streaming. The bot then sends key press events just like if you did that on the keyboard and done.
---
YES! On alliance, warlock is probably the least played class. I've never played a warlock (it's just not my style), but i think warlocks and paladins are two of my favorite class to have in my dungeon/raid group. They are a huge benefit to groups/raids. We can never have enough warlocks and paladins! Please people! Main a warlock! We need more warlocks on the alliance side!
---
It is great until you have to sit there for 20-30 seconds before you can start casting again due to threat. Stock up on Limited Invulnerability Potion's as they can save you when you do pull(for certain bosses), if your lucky and your tank is good.
---
No. Warriors dont want ret paladins in their raid stealing their gear to do dog shit damage with it. Because these people have seen it time abd time again. Bring in a ret, gear him out cause he claims if just had x and y his dmg would be good. Give him X and Y. He does less dmg than the tank. "o I misunderstood ret pally I actually need Z". On and on stealing gear and wasting it.
---
Ffxiv can be played on controllers too and as far as I know does it fairly well
---
Please
---
On the server I was on orbs were always open rolled on, with a limit of one per person until everyone got one.  They were not treated as a piece of BoP loot.
---
By late game most people running live strat were only there for orbs which sold pretty well like 75+g so it would didn't make sense to reserve them for anyone or could them as a piece of gear.
---
I've already conceded the concrete evidence you're  wanting isnt available because the game isnt released. I've also said why I believe the evidence you have noted on the beta is the way it is. No continuity on a beta no need to find new people, although I guarantee people have met friends they will level with on release during the beta. I dont understand why you're so up in arms about the game having a community, do you not want that?
---
Patience grass hopper
---
Hunter on alliance.
---
My guild my rules. Don't like it then you can gtfo. Simple. Cya!
---
As a raider, I'd argue the "BFA mindset" of most players (by sheer population) is "do the absolute minimum to complete LFR, and maybe pug higher content when I can get carried by people who outgear it".
---
Don't mistake the most vocal players for the most populous.
---
Why so? And which has the hardest would you say?
---
here you go.

---
I hope so. To play effectively on a mobile plaform the game would have to be dumbed down to BFA levels or worse. This over simplification of everything is a major part of why retail sucks!
---
Depends whether I'm at work or not.
---
Uh, no? Layering is definitely to compensate for overcrowded starting zones and they have said explicitly as much in interviews.

I highly doubt it. Since that wasn’t in the 1.12 client. But never say never. 
---
As for the codes most likely there is some out there if you have deep enough pockets.
---
Doing this will give you a bit of a head start on the rep grind, but the cloth grind will still be very real.
---
tilted I have class both nights every other night would have been gg
---
But... they're free tho?
---
Cool.
---
What are your thoughts so far on the classes you've played?
---
Warlocks have a lot of neat stuff that make them unique. I could never get into them and am pretty certain I’ll roll another hunter. I always like to remind people that you’ll enjoy the most time on classic by finding a class that clicks with you. I know as a hunter I won’t be doing the most damage after the pre-bis phase or being an unstoppable force in pvp scenarios but it’s a play style that I enjoy.
---
That frees up a talent point to be used elsewhere then.
---
He was definitely good, but the majority of the Athene personality was memeing before memeing was a meme.
---
Yeah except it's not basic or logical in terms of finding a guild to raid with.  It's basic and logical if you are in a guild that is *try harding* or wants to min/max.  But for a casual guild who will more than likely to struggling to pull together 40 players, it's illogical to come up with the statement of "LOL GOOD LUCK GETTING IN A RAID".
---
That's a try hard mindset for a casual setting.
---
Psh, South Shore PvP...
---
The real stuff is going to be going on in Black Rock Mountain ya'll!
---
Here's a secret to tagging mobs before anyone else (hunters can do this too). Set your pet to "aggressive" near where the mobs you want to tag spawn. Even before the mob appears on your screen, your pet will auto-tag it for you before anyone can even see it.
---
&gt;I guess I was wrong
---
Look at it this way, now you're right! :)
---
To be honest, it was really recent though and if you don't follow retail or retail drama I wouldn't expect you to know about it.
---
mage does all :D
---
Thank you very much for taking the time to do this.
---
Truth be told I think very early raiding will have a lot of min/maxing tryhards, but as time goes on you'll find it easier and easier to find slots in more laid back guilds for the more frowned on specs like ret, boomkin, spriest, ect.
---
Then again, I'm pulling this out of my ass, but it would make sense to me.  
---
I'm rolling a warlock preciously because I DON'T want fight for a spot on top of a lot of my gear being good in PvP as well, but I was gonna level a priest on the side because I love shadow and I was just gonna focus on gearing it up down the road after I've settled into a nice guild and made friends that I could talk into letting me bring my spriest :P
---
These sorts of things lose a lot of their oomph when it isn’t organic. If you saw someone post that and then you Screebshoted and posted it would be more interesting. You hand tailored the comment for posting in this sub.
---
I was about to give him credit for being better than the average GRIZZLY player which is a guild notorious for being a bunch of shit heads, then I realized he's not actually typing to the priest or talking to him in discord. So he's sort of just pretending to tell him to drop it.
---
Lots of people asking how all the spells would work, while in live there are add-ons that let you play with an Xbox controller.
---
The switch, unless I'm wrong, has the same number of buttons as an Xbox controller, so this easily could work.
---
All the new animations looks like shit. Retail is literally unplayable.
---
Hunters on alliance are the only mail wearers. You are right to assume that the highest played classes will be hard to gear. Rogues, mages, warriors. A lot of healers will want the same gear as well so they might have a hard time
---
Wouldn’t it still be PDT? I dunno when the DST transition is my state doesn’t do it so I’ve rarely had to adjust my clock for it.
---
Fuck yes we do.
---
Good for you buddy :)
---
I also like the idea of my character identity being tied to my spec, but I feel like it penalizes tanks and healers too much. It wouldn’t really work with the way classic talent trees are, but maybe something like speccing into or out of a tank/healer spec is free and speccing into or out of a dps spec costs gold.
---
If you can keep Screech up to date, it's a fantastic ability for damage mitigation, not to mention it can hold aoe aggro. It doesn't do quite as much dps as a cat, but it's survivability +reasonable attack power makes it a force to be reckoned with.
---
Of course, the starting owls in Teldrassil don't have screech and you have to get it from carrion birds in Westfall or else wait until like level 40ish to get a felwood owl with screech... So probably not something you would have done while leveling 😂
---
Again, you're "sources" are only talking about total system performance or GPU performance, not CPU performance.
---
&gt;FYI Tegra X1 is what the Switch is using for its CPU. And the last link uses flops, which is what were comparing CPUs with https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/console-gpu-power-compared-ranking-systems-by-flop/2900-1334/9/
---
The Tegra X1 has both a CPU and GPU in it. That Gamespot link is only using total system performance, not CPU, and is actually wrong. The 1 tflop that they say the Switch has is actually the total performance of the Tegra X1 CPU and GPU combined running at 1GHZ, but the Switch's actual performance is lower than that.
---
ALL older models look better.
---
Hey brother add Durrian#1563 on battlenet
---
looking for more players like yourself to join our large group
---
It gets a bit blurry in classic since classes can wear any type of armor, unlike retail. So for instance as a holy pala, I'm grabbing cloth, leather mail as well as plate if it has healing power/crit etc. DPS plate, thats really only warriors as you won't have ret's (normally). Leather dps, is shared between rogues and ferals, though again minimal to no ferals. Cloth comes with +dmg or +heal, so they'll only be after the dmg, that will be split between mage/lock normally as a raid usually only has 1 Shadow priest. 
---
Long and short, it's more about the stats on the item, rather than the armor type. One could argue holy pala's have the easiest time of gearing since they can wear all types of armor, but thats subjective.
---
No one competitive will fall for this because they'll all be using cast bar and enemy cooldown addons. Don't waste your time.
---
I’ve had a rough past couple of weeks and it’s pulled me down hard. Haven’t been coming here like I always professed and stopped taking care of myself.
---
It’s amazing how fast just neglecting basic care can make yourself fall so hard.
---
I’m trying to pick myself up and move forward and trying to press on like all the other amazing people here.
---
I just hope I can be better and become the best person I can be. Wish I could snap my fingers and just be the perfect person I want to be for my loved ones and myself.
---
Thanks to all the wonderful people here and thanks for reading. &lt;3
---
Maybe I'm remembering wrong but the Hunter epic wasn't transformable, you just have a bow and a staff?
---
This is specifically what stress tests are for. Yes, experiencing a bit of the content is just a bonus, for us. Their primary goal is not to test content, though, but what the servers can handle.
---
lol cry baby
---
^ Elitists are toxic and bad for the game. This guy is our holy savior that will not use consumes or world buffs for raids and kick you if you do!
---
Just hoping for RP PVP
---
First of all, you're missing the point of the analogy. Venom is used to to make the antibodies to it, in small amounts. 
---
Second, while your body does need carbs, it doesn't need much. Hence people doing keto still being healthy and alive.
---
The whole point of my post in general was to point out that people parrot what they learn, without doing any research for themselves. There has been a very big history of lobbying and other interests skewing the research data that has shaped our understanding and views on nutrition. Remember the food pyramid? How about how breakfast in the most important meal of the day? The importance of 3 meals a day? 
---
There is TONS of misinformation backed by cherry picked research funded by whoever wanted to make a buck, much of which is still taught and used as fact today.
---
W.e its PT
---
Wait what the fuck? It ALWAYS did an "Omni" Ani when finished. What does it do now? Not the single Target one???
---
Aware and was never referring to the guild master but game master.
---
Is this real?
---
Obviously I meant speed levelers for the fastest shamans. It’s not going to outrace really any other class except warrior.
---
You don't have to play with any add-ons.
---
Pretty sure i'm going to end up like that as well.. 🤪
---
He works in some subs

Dunce confirmed.

I played that character mostly thru BC and early wrath

Alliance
---
/wave: Hi, lets not fight and be curtious while leveling
---
Horde: Ohh an alliance, lets be kind to each.... DID HE JUST FLIP ME THE BIRD, dem fighting words
---
God damn, I'm sorry but that's such a dumb thing to say. If the math is done right IT DOES account for those variables. You find out how much damage you're doing / how fast you're able to kill mobs on average. Just because something is more consistent does not at all mean it's better. Sure there may be some more variability, but if you're more often killing mobs faster, then you're leveling faster. And on top of all that, how does your method account for all the variables that come up while leveling whereas this on doesn't?
---
What if i told you that it can come out the 26 in NA but the 27th for the rest of the world and not be a day early
---
The questing xp issue was fixed more than a year ago now.  The only thing still different about pservers is that the rested xp accumulation rate is 2x what it should be (which will have little effect on the super hardcore players that hit max in less than a week)
---
My main has been a NE death knight since WotLK so my plan is to make a warrior or hunter and make him look the same and with the same name as my DK and pretend that it is the same character before he was raised by the Lich King. My biggest fear is someone steals my name on reserve day and I’ll have to replan everything on the spot lol.
---
I don't know anything about this particular streamer, but the guild he's in, GRIZZLY, is notorious on private servers for being filled with a bunch of shit heads and ninja looters. So him acting like a cry baby on stream is exactly what I expected from someone in that guild.
---
Yeah you can unequip the shard bag lol. No reason to be carrying a 26 slot shard bag when you're not about to raid.

No joke, only Warcraft
---
There is a deep disc build that is really good but it is mostly only considered for guilds that are farming completed content that just want to do it fast. So mostly only something that the a high end guild would bother with.
---
Bear in mind that any priest can effectively heal any dungeon well (with practice) until scholomance/BRD or so as a shadow spec.
---
Soul link warlock
---
Nah. If you rly wanna play, play a private server. I'm resubbing the 27th of august after being absent for years (early MoP). In my opinion the stresstest alone isn't worth it.
---
Oh alright, never knew. I always just assumed it worked this way.
---
I'm sure that'll work on retail classic too. There's no wall walking involved in it. It probably works on retail too but I don't have an active sub to test.
---
Aside from a main, I'll try to have 3-4 alts I level mostly on rested XP... more in prep for a hopeful BC than endgame stuff, since BC is my fav for raiding and endgame stuffs.  I will take my main through as much vanilla as I can stomach though.
---
The retail community wants faster leveling because the game has become 100% geared towards end-game content.  IN Vanilla the journey to 60 was a huge part of what made the game fun.  Today it's all about getting to the end where you can join in on the mindless AE spamzola fest with a cross realm group of players you'll never talk to again.
---
Retail feels like its just a boring slog of things you need to do in order to get leveled up.  There is no challenge or danger.  Its just busy work.  It's a bad game.  
---
I hope they learn from Classic if it isn't already too late (i think it is).  
---
Like OP said, retail sure does look nice though...  THat's about the only good thing i can say about it.  I've tried to like it.  I've tried to play it while i wait for classic.  The problem is that it isn't a fun game.
---
So... wait... you can start off Classic at 60 if you had characters that never progressed very far?
---
This is referencing the quest where you literally go around waking peons up to complete a quest.
---
Yep definitly the hardest competition here. Every goddamn class rolls on hunteritems™ .  
---
 you are right either way, wether you are serioys or not. Love it.
---
I'd be curious to have a more in depth look at that. Blizzard going through Nvidia they have much less control and access. Through Google I imagine they would have more direct control from start to finish.
---
Yes - sub 50 dungeons should be doable.
---
Of course I know him, he's me.
---
« If the tank dies, he was undergeared. »
---
Do you remember an ally guild called Twink Inc?
---
Nope - unless you plan on playing 8.2
---
I personally like Asmongold and MadSeason. People hate Asmongold for petty reasons or for reasons in the past, but he’s very knowledgeable about the game. MadSeason is a much more monotone guy, but people like him because he’s also very knowledgeable.
---
... it's not early it's the same day.
---
I got sucked into twinking by circumstance and discovered it was pretty fun, so stuck with it. The most OP racial by a mile from 10-39 was shadowmeld. Twink vs twink WSG, a couple NE hunters mid and horde doesn't have a chance.  Same for AB, 3-4 NE hunters at xroads or other spots depending on dispositions, horde has to get very lucky to even compete.  Probably somewhat less true for 40-59, but without epic mounts it's still imba.
---
I already play PS, it's not classic and not a stress test experience. I prob will resub tbh
---
Warlocks have TONS of utility, and therefore people will love having you in the raid/group. You bring a lot more to a group than simply dps. rogues have zero utility in a group, and bring nothing except dps. So you have a very big advantage to getting invited to raids/groups over rogues. Rogues will be a dime-a-dozen anyway.
---
Depends what kind of person she is.  
---
For me the story kept me in WoW  
---
And now the nostalgia of reliving the best part of it
---
Never going to happen
---
🤯🤯
---
Lol 200iq right there, i didnt think this far back then
---
Classic is built upon the modern engine so addons will be much more similar to retail than they are to vanilla.
---
If you learn on a vanilla pserver you will have to throw away almost everything and start over.
---
My suggestion is to use a retail starter account, no sub required up to level 20 and some other restrictions but the client is the full one so good for learning.
---
Involved game mechanics.
---
Also, I think in TBC they made more of an effort to make other specs/classes viable in all forms of gameplay. Double-edged sword here, because arguably this began the trend of chasing balance, and lead to many class skills and thematic abilities being trimmed. Today the classes do not feel terribly dissimilar from each other.
---
I'd like them to have a balance patch post-release that does a few things to bolster some specs without changing too much of the core-gameplay.
---
Give Paladin's a taunt. 
---
Adjust Hunter scaling *slightly*, so that they aren't awful post AQ
---
Lessen the mana issues that plague Boomkins, Ele shamans and to a lesser extent Shadow Priests. Some co-efficient or raw numbers adjustment perhaps as well. Just a little.
---
Give Druids a standard rez. Honestly druid healing is just OK, so in a dungeon run, especially with the existence of Locks, I don't see this making them OP. If you want though, give their Rez a debuff, like forbearance, that prevents the target from benefiting from battle-rez within X-seconds/minutes.
---
Little stuff like this can make a big difference to make other classes playable, without breaking the classic feel, in my opinion.
---
While running past people leveling. Okay.

Looking for semi-serious and relaxed players (pref 18+) to join my growing group of friends! Many of us are WoW veterans playing since back in TBC-WotLK. We are undecided in regards to Faction.. Most important to me is keeping as many friends playing together as possible. We plan to do PvE and PvP and will be raiding \~1 day a week.

Just seeing that shield brought back memories.
---
I wish I could remember what 2h epic my pally had :(
---
Hey man, try /stormlingx 
---
He's one of the most nicest and chill guys I've seen streaming.
---
Also his WSG game is top tier. You won't be disappointed :\]
---
Madseason, SmoothMcgroove or Quissy are the 3 i mainly watch right now
---
If they cant who do you think is able to?? Druid only?
---
Mainly just looking for an intro to say this is the game and what it’s all about
---
It's not an English word though.
---
I dont hate Esfand but like anyone with that many people watching the community can suck.  I actually  like watching Kevin Jordan (@kevinjordon) play a lot he is one of the devs from vanilla wow.
---
Really fucking hard. It's easier to find a BfA addon that's similar and adopt that instead. Or you could write a new addon from the ground up, that would also be easier.
---
Yea, easy. Anyone with a healing spell can heal sub 50 dungeons regardless of the spec. Might be a bit more gear dependent but you can still do it
---
The only sword worth tanking with is whatever sword you happen to get while raiding or grouping. 99% of Tanks won't get TF. 
---
Quel Serrar and others suffice until you can get it.
---
My point is that Humans are the better tanks because of the WEP skill and the lack of increase dodge.
---
I'll still be playing a NE Warrior myself but if I want to Raid anything past MC/Ony Im going to NEED those gloves.
---
I mean if no one else can open it I feel like that’s fair game
---
\&gt;  you're gonna have a frustrating graveyard run.  
---
\*laughs in  Warlock\*
---
I really want to get my 0.5 set. They seems specifically good for the hybrids. The druid, paladin, and shaman sets all seem to have a good variety of stats that could be used for ret, enhance, or feral. Obviously it's not the best gear but it seems comparable to the rank 10 pvp gear or mc gear
---
Priest for sure, pally you may need some healing gear but should be fine
---
The loot is from the TBC prepatch, so I don't see it in Classic.
---
Hey, it's your money :) Just giving my pov.
---
Then what was the whole point in this post?
---
It isn't a hard game to pick up. I don't think I'm any better than I was when I was in Vanilla. Not really the story for most but I really don't feel like it takes long to get the hang of things.
---
There was a level 19 twink ganking in redridge when I leveled on a private server. I didn't mind it too much. We could fight back.
---
I didn't even run with prep, never thought about getting that with riposte. Huh, guess I'll have to try that out in classic ;)
---
Can you reduce enemy armor to 0 ? Or am I wrong in thinking that it should be a bit less than 7dps after reduction?
---
Yes, I like it for rez after dying when you're surrounded and need to get to full and prepped to try and grind your way out instead of death crawling
---
Saaame. I was gonna name my lock Ainsooalgown but I kind of want to play mage too. I guess it works for either but still...

This is the thing about the Classic community that scares me the most, that an otherwise competent and enthusiastic player will be socially barred from content because they enjoy playing something like Boomkin
---
Can we have the /u/bobby-b-bot back here?
---
Are you looking for Mankirk's wife too?  I can't find her anywhere.  I found their hut, but no one was there...
---
You're argument is based on assumptions of the entire player base so it doesn't really hold up. Im just talking about what i've noticed in the premade group finder. Pugs don't carry people in bfa just try getting into a m+ with 400ilvl or lower and no io score.
---
If she is into the story you can actually find a video on YouTube of all WC3 cut scenes which would bring her up to speed. Then probably have her test out a tree 1-20 on the current retail game to understand questing, mechanics etc. I think that will be easier than watching a video of someone’s gameplay, but obviously MUCH more time consuming.
---
&gt;I think it's a funny joke Blizz made to make Warriors the "poor" class considering it has the most expensive repairs.
---
Hybrid Tax.
---
Just wanted to drop by and say I enjoyed this read. It happens to a lot of us. Not only wow, life in general. Great question too!
---
I would buy a switch just for that playing wow on the go was my dream back then.
---
What if i told you people have already seen all of classic
---
I had highwarlord, I still had a twink alt. Honestly, the twink matches were always even.
---
You mainly faced other twinks in similar gear. People not twinking rarely pvped as they had no incentive. You could get one or two non twinks but less rare and always on both sides.
---
Not sure why people think twinking meant someone was bad.
---
My highwarlord group would slaughter people new to pvp or 60 who are signing up.
---
I main tanked every raid in Vanilla. We absolutely found it necessary. I've never even touched a Pserver before the past week to test out low level routes.
---
The +5 to swords means you don't have to itemize for that extra WEP skill. Which other tanks NEED to. It's not about mix/maxing. It's about being hit capped before you go Tanking for 40 people.
---
If you aren't hit capped you will lose threat in the raid. Full stop.
---
MadSeasonShow on YouTube. His whole channel but specifically https://youtu.be/0anqyc7greQ
---
Nobody is going to build buying old parts if you can buy new ones with better performance, this only shows how the hardware that some people may have today will fare with the release of classic. If you are uncertain on what to get just get an AMD 2400g with no dedicated video card or a Core i3-8100 + GT 1030, both systems with 8GB ram and a 256GB SSD as the main components and you could play classic on low/medium settings on 720p/1080p, you can get so much more if you can get better components but then it becomes a matter of how much money you want to spend and what you are using your computer for.
---
The soul shard thing isnt too bad, it's the bag space that wrecks. And you would be surprised how often each curse is actually used. Weakness is the only one I rarely put up, and even then it's great for PvP until you can get your kite going and squishy tanks that need some extra help.
---
Definitely prep hemo in there just by the double vanish and hemo debuff
---
I think I was one item short of full tier 2.  I had that shield but I can't remember what 2h I used !
---
Yes and its listed as its CPU for the switch.
---
Also I LITERALLY GAVE YOU THE GFLOPS NUMBERS. Stop talking out of your ass and give proof.
---
Ooh! 
---
Looks like he’s actually streaming now. 
---
Thanks for the fast reply, I appreciate it, I’ll check him out :)
---
Everyone from retail is like “What’s the problem? This is a standard disc priest”
---
Its reported 100s of times during the AV beta phase, they know.
---
Mechooga is da best, mon!
---
This true and a lot of people cant get out of the perspective of raiding end game. In another thread someone mentioned how feral and other meme specs were complete useless trash. But then when someone mentioned better itemization to make them more viable for raids they humbly had to state that they would then be overpowered in pvp. 
---
A lot of people trash on ret paladins dps in a raid but will do everything they can to not fight one in pvp
---
Yes, and that's exactly what I was looking for when I posted this. Just others opinions, so thank you! (Not being sarcastic, can be hard to tell via text sometimes)
---
What class are you interested in watching ? We might be able to give you better suggestions if we had an idea of what char you wanna play
---
Now that is some serious beta testing
---
Okay so if a raid denies an arms warrior to join because it would gimp them, they are tryharding? I guess our defintion of what try harding is, is different.
---
No it's not? The starter edition is free but you only get to level 20 on that one.
---
\&gt; Wrath also brought in a lot of the tools that killed the social aspect of the game  
---
This is a good point, I forgot that LFG was a wrath feature
---
Paladins of Justice?
---
Super Paladins
---
PalaGang?
---
Holy Gang?
---
That’s great, I’ll put them in my notes and maybe check some of their archived stuff until their next stream. Thank you for the recommendations, they’re really appreciated.
---
So I'm not the only one, thank god! I've been playing since Vanilla, and although I don't totally agree with where the game has gone, I still like retail while at the same time looking forward to go back to the roots and enjoy both games :)
---
No problem, dude!
---
If they allow sl.. Locks man
---
Watching Ziqo is always a good time.
---
No way. [I love Brandon Sanderson's work](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cosmere/comments/bcgakx/married_my_gemheart_before_an_obligator_uniting/). :-P
---
Im not your buddy, pal
---
I haven’t really watch many streams but Kargoz, skarmtank, defcamp and melderon, and metagiblin are some of my fav content creators on YouTube, oh yeah and frostadamus but I don’t think he has put much out recently
---
If you don't want ganking, you need to roll on a non-pvp server IMO.
---
I don't think a single starting zone is going to be spared.
---
I'm the opposite, got the faction, race, and name down. I can't decide on the class!
---
Hahhaa, I came into this thread only to read the tinfoil hatters about their ridiculous theories, thanks for not disappointing.
---
I assume you're looking to play ret. If that's the case, then your rotation is 2 buttons. Cast a seal, cast judgement. Repeat.
---
Meh soul sharding seems like farming that doesn't yield any real rewards (obviously soul shards are the reward but it feels like a grind on top of an already grindy game)
---
I don't mean the curses are never used but on my mage I have buttons I use every fight no matter what, that's not the case for the 1894843 curses warlocks have lmao
---
PVE servers have battlegrounds right? So you get things the way you want, no PVP unless you ask for it...
---
*laughter resumes as dinner is cheese and bacon*
---
Wand available at lvl 5. Arcane shot trainable at what..? 6/8?
---
Oh right that's a good idea, didn't think about the starter version being free.
---
In the scenario I literally just provided for you, where most casual guilds are short people, how on earth would the arms warrior be gimping them exactly?  First off, casual guilds barely even give 2 shit about debuff slots if that's what you are going to say, but lets just humor you for one second and act like they give a shit.... Tell him not to use MS and use a different attack like whirlwind or something.  Problem solved.  Now how exactly is this player 'gimping' them?
---
That's what felhunter is for. Paranoia is an ability that is essentially perception+
---
The results might be slightly off, I’ll agree - currently 93 people have responded to the first part of the poll and only 65 to the third part of the poll. What kinds of people are the 65 who filled out all 3? More likely they are big fans of WoW who are more interested in this poll so the last poll might have slightly skewed results towards the 10 side, and the 28 who didn’t fill out everything might be more blasé about these dungeons in general. 
---
However, this poll was just for a bit of fun. The results won’t be completely useless and I’ll be writing up a results post (likely tomorrow) in which I’ll be certain to mention where I see issues in my methodology. I have taken a few statistics courses and although I’m not an expert I do absolutely acknowledge the issues with splitting it over three polls. I also can’t know who those 28 people were that didn’t continue to take the polls, so I can’t throw out any data either (nor do I think I would if I could - we can get a general idea of which dungeons people like more and which ones they like less even with the slightly awry polling method).
---
I don’t, however, think that the poll being split into three parts will have an impact on those 65 people who DID fill each part out. It’s just split into three links that they continued to click between instead of being one webpage.
---
I’ll be putting the data in excel to get some averages and I’ll also use it to interpret the data a little bit better and come back with my findings. I may make subgroups by which poll each dungeon was in so that we can get a picture of, within each poll, how did dungeons compare.
---
I wouldn't be sure you'll manage to plau much 8.2 if you sub for a month today at this rate.
---
That’s a good question, I’m still mulling that over. I figure I’ll either re roll my first character which would be a hunter or maybe try out a warlock this time around- mainly because I haven’t played one before and I love the demonology aspect of them and think a caster could be exiting new frontier.
---
And it will have a negative impact on the raiding scene. But you don’t care about that as long as you spout NOCHANGES like an idiot that’s what matters
---
it probably wont show up for like another 8 hours but it should be today yeah
---
Oof sorry can't be of help there. Id just watch some of the cinematics and some gameplay
---
4 of them
---
It's on the launcher just above the play button
---
I wouldn’t, it’s going to be so crowded and it only lasts a few days.
---
Work is da poo poo! No more!
---
Awesome, I’ll add them to my notes and check out their stuff, thank you!
---
Completely different comparisons that you're trying to make. Porting a PC game to console with much more limited controls is an issue. Say you have 25 binds on PC. On a switch you won't have that many buttons. This sort of thing would lead to ability pruning so that the game plays better on all platforms.
---
The three exact choices I've been considering. I still don't know 100%. Don't come for me like this
---
Don't do it dude. Blizzard already sucked enough money out of us. They will get paid when they deliver the product.
---
For this bug to work you need to be Holy though.
---
Unless you are Asmongold. He will get in fine.
---
Thank you for your service.
---
I missed out on pvp the first time round as I was a noob and rolled pve server. Not this time round! I'm ready to gank and be ganked!
---
I’ll peak in on Kargoz, they sound great, and I’ll add TipsOut and Esfand to my notes for later. Thanks for the help :)
---
It shows the exact time for every region on their website.
---
Screenshotting your own comment?
---
If you sub you can play until level 110. All non-bfa content including classic is sub-only..
---
Btw the correct answer is to roll a priest ;)
---
Massively populated at lower levels. Not many make the full trek to 60 cause its a rough leveling
---
I’m happy to see so many people mention MadSeason, he must be pretty good at what he does. I’ll check out both of their channels, thank you!
---
Jesus Christ you still swear like how a 16 year old swears

Thank you Nostalrius!
---
Taking a reply from my pornfree posts.  Nice.  It’s a good place to go for support if you’re having trouble yourself.
---
My question is why repost my own comment here?  Very strange.
---
That’s completely untrue haha. Especially with salvation. Most tanks don’t even use swords, ever. Daggers are superior in TPS. 1% dodge, especially in higher raid tiers is much more crucial for a progression tank. Now if we’re talking about fury, yes human is far superior.
---
Look at it like this.
---
100 people roll Warrior
---
50 of those make it to Level 30+
---
25 of those hit 60
---
10 of those Tank
---
5 of those Tanks are actually good
---
1 of them gets Thunderfury
---
Did you..  did you just played stealth sound in my head? What the hell?
---
OOM in any fight that’s longer than 1 min. You won’t have sustainable threat generation. In a raid a warrior will always be the better option. Even in 5 mans a warrior will always be better by miles. Also no taunt.
---
I have mained a paladin for 14 years. I have been Prot since the BC prepatch. I am rolling warrior for Classic. If you want to tank you should consider doing the same. Warrior is fun. Paladin in Classic is a support hybrid and the are great in that role.
---
We all know what paladins can and can’t do now. People going into Classic expecting to raid as Prot or Ret need to set proper expectations for themselves and their raid team. If people want to bring Prot or Rets to raids that’s fine but those guys will never be as effective as a warrior in those roles. As long as everyone is cool with that great. 
---
At least Prot brings Blessing of Sanctuary to the raid. Ret brings nothing to make up for their lack of DPS like a Feral, Boomkin or Shadow Priest does that a holy paladin couldn’t do better.
---
They beat everyone else to the medeival D&amp;D/Tolkien type fantasy MMO setting, so now they are the standard that everybody compares other games to, in that respect. That type of setting has always been hugely popular, Blizzard was able to create an online world around it and make it accessible to the masses in a way that far exceeded previous games like EQ or Ultima Online.  
---
Additionally, the design of the original game was well done and contains countless pop culture references which increased its appeal to a wider audience beyond the traditional hardcore gamer/computer geek.
---
Good point , super crowded. Idk it will be a unique experience though! Good points though thank you that's why I made this post &lt;3
---
down vote this fucking shit
---
Ah okay, thanks for the info. Let's hope it's enough to get into the stress test then :)
---
If you like mage play, watch Venruki. He and Ziqo often group, and Venruki is more fun to watch and easier to learn from.
---
&gt;The average MC/BWL raid will have 2-3 Warlocks and 6-8 Mages.
---
This is actually, in a round-about way, a pro for Warlocks. Quicker gearing potential.
---
Damnnn... Tru
---
They know what they're doing tho THEY KNOW WE WANT IT
---
They want to play a BG or two as a break from leveling. They don't want to halt their entire leveling process in order to have them not get absolutely destroyed in that one or two bg. If it weren't for twinks they absolutely wouldn't have to.
---
I love twinking and I'm going to twink, but you are completely misrepresenting the issue here
---
Warriors that hit max level are going to have a hard time getting geared unless they're willing to tank.
---
Fury DPS Warriors will be last pick for a Warrior Tank forming a 5-10 man group.
---
It was a question bro don't get butthurt
---
OK, me an that kinda orc
---
It's way easier to farm deadmines than molten core.

WARNING: Mostly ranting to relieve my feelings. Ignore if you wish, I won’t be hurt!
---
Having a tough time and just trying to sit here biding my time until the near-slip I’ve had passes. Feeling angry and resentful and wishing I could just cave in and stop having to fight this.
---
Drives me crazy how fluid my emotions are. Like I slip and slide from happy, to sad, to depressed, to craving, to nearly relapsing, and then feeling angry.
---
Angry I can’t have it. Angry that giving in would be fruitless. Angry that my past actions have hurt someone. Angry that I just want them to be better and for me to be better.
---
Seriously feeling like sometimes I should just run away from everything. I just want to run and escape the anger, the cravings, the pain, and the past being brought up every couple weeks!
---
Thanks to anyone putting up with this read. Totally understand if you skipped it.
---
That's a think paladins dont have!
---
Well yeah that and the "I dunno where to quest" board behind him.
---
I’m sorry if I misunderstood your initial comment, are you a streamer as well? 
---
Beyond that I’ll google Kevin Jordan, a dev for vanilla could be a really interring angle indeed. Shaky endorsement for Esfand haha, but I haven’t heard of them and may check them out as well. Thank you for the help!
---
"how is this shit so bugged that you don't die x(((("
---
it's a beta you stupid fuck
---
I played vanilla in highschool. I'm now 30 with a wife and kid. A lot of my gaming these days is on my Switch on the couch while I "watch The Bachelor" or whatever show with my wife. 
---
Being able to do basic stuff (level, farm gold, craft, maybe even some dungeons) would be absolutely huge for my ability to play Classic more than an hour or 2 a few times a week.
---
It’s going to be similar to launch, many many people competing for mob tags. It will be interesting trying out wailing caverns at 15 though.
---
I love Mara too!! Somehow it feels like less of a maze than BRD to me while still retaining some mystery due to the hidden bosses and sheer scale of the instance. The orange and purple sides aren’t the most memorable parts of the dungeon but I certainly think those made for a cool idea.
---
Don't really think it's THAT hard tbh. 
---
MoP had great class design, Legion class halls and mage tower were great additions, modern raids have fun mechanics and are much more challenging, arena is great, a decent amount of QoL changes over the years have been good for the most part, transmog is cool (I do understand some people don't like it, but a simple opt in/out feature would solve that).
---
There's plenty of stuff they have added post-wotlk that's been good.
---
I was having fun with it. There are loads of fun quests in Durotar to reference with this!
---
Well either way it’s bad.
---
I know I was one of those vanilla hunters inspired to be a dedicated puller based on my EQ experience.  I would mark the pack, pick them apart with traps, and bring a staggered continuous stream of single mobs to the tank  for the group to pummel.  Even used a "/p Incoming %T" macro.  I recall it working really well at launch for locations like Stratholme Baron runs.  I think this was due to the mob layout in Stratholme more than anything.  The frequent patrolling gargoyles and invisible shades ("The living are here!") made it precarious to fight packs where they stood.  Early vanilla groups were also really prone to body pulling unintentional adds from backpedaling into them.  However, I rerolled to a warrior to tank by patch 1.6 and I can't recall a single instance the rest of my vanilla career where a hunter stepped up to pull.
---
I don't generally thank pirates but I can thank Blizzard for shutting it down, if they hadn't we wouldn't be here today.
---
Noob mistakes aren't a bad thing, they just don't present an accurate picture of difficulty because different noobs are going to make different mistakes.  Take for instance you saying it was a mistake to go to Senjin first... it wasn't, Senjin is the best next step after you leave the valley of trials and saves you backtracking when you finish the one or two quests a level 5-6 can do in Razor Hill.  On that note, get level 6 in the starting zone, it should be comfortably doable.
---
On the other end I remember people saying they got to level 10 in an hour in Vanilla.  I have no idea how that's possible and am pretty sure it isn't, but maybe I'm missing something.
---
Man, I sure do miss Thottbot.  Short and sweet and not bloated like wowhead today.
---
That's bad ass.
---
The main 2 features of layering is to   
---
1. split a massive realm (basically all realms on release) into multiple layers so that later on when everybody is playing at different times/timezones they can merge the layers back into the original realm.  
---
2. To make queue times hopefully nonexistent as another layer can simply be created when others are full, their main goal with layering isnt to make the starting areas. They said in interviews they dont care if people cant get quests done, but they do care if people are not even able to log in to play.  
---
They also said that server size would be somewhat similar to retail vanilla, 2.5-3k im guessing, which is still gonna be a complete shitshow in any starting area 1-20, after that u can kinda start branching out abit. Layering wont help that.  
---
If there was NO Layering, NO Sharding, it would be exactly the same, except there would be 9000 people sitting in queue all day unable to play the game theyre paying for.
---
Dear god man, please learn how hardware works before making claims like this.
---
&gt;Yes and its listed as its CPU for the switch.
---
In some places that don't get specific. Look at the Wikipedia page for the Switch, it specifies the Cortex A57 CPU and the Maxwell-based GM20b GPu which make up the two halves of the Tegra X1. The Tegra X1 is what's known as a "system on a chip". That means it has a CPU and a GPU on one piece of hardware. That doesn't mean it uses the same hardware to do both jobs. The CPU and GPU sections have separate performance figures, of which the GPU will make up the majority of because GPUs generally provide much more compute power than CPUs with the tradeoff of being much more specialized. That 1 tflop number that your Gamespot link gives is the total combined power of the CPU and GPU of a Tegra X1 running at 1ghz on both the CPU and GPU in FP16 operations. Again, that's the total combined power of both the CPU and GPU, of which the GPU makes up the vast majority. The CPU's performance makes up only a fraction of that.
---
&gt;Also I LITERALLY GAVE YOU THE GFLOPS NUMBERS. Stop talking out of your ass and give proof.
---
Again, you gave the total gflops of the system, not of the CPU. I gave you the double precision gflops of both the Switch's CPU and the PS3's CPU. You can even do the calculations yourself using the formula here: http://www.novatte.com/our-blog/197-how-to-calculate-peak-theoretical-performance-of-a-cpu-based-hpc-system
---
You can even look up the specs of the CPU in each if you don't believe my numbers, but I'll give them again anyways:
---
PS3's Cell CPU: 3.2GHZ, 7 cores available to games, 1 instruction per cycle, 1 CPU. Plug those into the formula and you get 22.4 gflops of double precision performance for the PS3's CPU.
---
Switch's Cortex A57 CPU: 1.02GHZ, 4 cores, 4 instructions per cycle, 1 CPU. Plug those into the formula and you get 16.3 gflops of double precision performance for the Switch's CPU.
---
They may have been trash but they were carried by OP classes like death knights and broken beast cleave
---
If you roll a warrior and refuse to tank you're in for a rude awakening
---
"but you're going to die". Not playing paladin I'm not.
---
Also, if you want to tank and are considering Paladin. Just be well aware that you won't Tank in raids. Outside of UBRS.
---
However, if you're good, you can be a popular Tank on your server for 5-10 man's. Though that requires some gear from raids which requires you to heal for a while.
---
If this is anything like dark souls, isn’t that just a fact?
---
There are tons of reasons why they can't use a 15 year old version of the game.
---
Security, stability, customer support, etc.
---
Layering would be possible even if they used the older version of the game and it's not in the game because it's possible, it's in the game because you either have 10 hour long queues, dead servers in a few months or layering. It has issues and there are millions of ways to make it better sure but it's not some retarded conspiracy that Activision wants to intentionally put in layering just to fuck with people.
---
Possibly
---
Rogues aren't useless in zerg vs zerg. You just have to be extra patient, target those that overextend, and protect flanks. It's pretty fun tbh.

I always skipped this quest for some reason. I guess it started with me never noticing it and even once I did, I never completed it.
---
Hey guys fire mage here looking for MC or BWL!
---
Can't relate will be playing paladin.
---
hell yeah which race you going? for me all of the downsides of a lock are in raids so i dont mind it cause i wanna be a pvp monster after gearing up
---
Well if I'm being truthful, at worst I get blown up by the two rogues stealthed behind the healer lol
---
I have seen this bug a few times and even in the AV over the weekend. It's definitely limited to priest but I don't any know how to intentionally initiate the bug but some have suggested it has something to do with the Spirit of Redemption talent. 
---
Are there any priest that can confirm it happening to them without that talent?
---
Go in blind and let her explore/make all the decisions.
---
I know that’s why I said damn classic the whole thing was supposed to be a joke
---
Ooga gang is great and the main reason I’m sad to not be in the beta.
---
I agree with your positives here are some negatives, it's not all crits and felsteads.
---
\-Summon bitch, have to go to dungeon first while your party dicks around
---
\-Candy bitch
---
\-Soul shards suck
---
\-Curse bitch (getting screamed at by the mages out dps'ing you to keep up CoE)
---
\-Shadowbolt spam, granted most classes have really boring pve rotations
---
if you are a warrior, tank all my mobs that are attacking me since you have better defensive capabilities.
---
Yes, it is totally unviable, moving on...
---
My favorite was BC
---
In which scenario would an arms warrior ever be your last option? Like come on dude. And if you are struggling with finding people, why the fuck would you not try your best or AT LEAST spec into a proper pve spec? This is absolutely ridiculous.
---
What is OSRS?
---
https://youtu.be/mczb2LAYrMo?t=111
---
yeah it makes no sense you should be able to root anywhere. like how come a mage can frost nova when theyre on a volcanoe in ungoro.
---
you're retarded on many levels. how can u even type that shit
---
I can't answer that for you but for me the answer would be no. Gear is how you progress you character and without raiding you're going to hit a wall pretty quickly unless you plan to rank grind and that requires more time than raiding.
---
Fair enough! You're is better with the Cyperpunk reference for sure, just throwing it out there in case you were Alliance scum and had no idea about the peons :P
---
Paladin but so boring
---
Only consideration for the mount spell is that it doesn’t take up bag space
---
"Fuck you"
---
Sincerely, EU
---
I'm a little concerned Pantheon wants to bring back having a dedicated CC class, the enchanter.  I thought it was universally agreed vanilla greatly improved on EQ's system by having CC be a group effort.
---
Then they will just have scouts/spies which is very intriguing to think about. Now if only blizz could make the npcs do ambushes and random things like this (wow2?) that would be amazing
---
My sim is broke.
---
Are you really trying to imply that paladins won't get kited to shit by a hunter?
---
Priests and Druids both have pretty low competition for gear. Priests can craft themselves a truefaith and mix/match t1/prebis items early game.  Layer on they want to be using 8/8 t2 so they only have to compete against fellow priests for those 8 slots.  They also get Benediction for basically free which will last you a long time and takes care of another 2 slots. 
---
 Druids get the benefit of being the least common class in a rad comp so they can pick up their tier sets easily.  They will have to compete more with other classes for their weapons though. However,  the shifting sands quest chain provides the fang of korialstrasz that can easily last you all the way through naxx as both a Druid and a Priest.  It's a long chain and a big commitment of effort,  but their will be little competetion and a lot more opportunity for it compared to items like lokamir or scepter of the false prophet.
---
Both can use Hide of the Wild for the majority of the game(hell I am clearing naxx on a character till using Hide of the Wild right now).  
---
Both of these classes should definitely grab their respective Edge of Madness trinkets from ZG.  They are the best healer items in the game and absolutely amazing tools for dealing with the high amounts of raidwide burst damage on many trash and boss encounters in AQ and naxx.  Once again there is little competition and lots of opportunity to grab these.  That takes care of another slot.
---
  Basically the only big things you will need to compete with all other healers for as a Priest or a Druid are rings/rejuv gem.
---
You can felhunter off blessing of freedom though and blessing of protection I think
---
Honestly I’ve payed $15 for much, much less.
---
It's fine that you don't enjoy it, I personally like that I can log on and do a Mythic+ and then log off in 30-40 minutes and it's a pretty fun time. There's not much I can accomplish in classic in the same time frame, and that's also perfectly fine. I'm going to play classic when I have longer stretches of time and retail when I've only got a short burst.
---
Retail is geared for casual play because that's what most of their community has asked for. Classic is releasing because the part of the community that wants to put in long hours for their gear has been growing and getting louder. Both games are fun for different types of people.
---
Priests can heal fine in any spec.  Pallys can heal ok with a bunch of cloth healing gear but it becomes harder as you approach 60.  I used to main heal UBRS on my prot/holy pally at 60, but I'm not sure I'd want to do when Ret.
---
Have you ever gone three straight days burning 5000 calories via constant, vigorous exercise and not eating carbs?  I can tell you first hand that it is fucking awful and had to bail part way through a 3 day hike due to dizziness and weakness (I was eating ample total calories, but limited to protein and fat sources due to calculating the most weight:calorie beneficial diet).  I absolutely reeked of ammonia due to the muscle breakdown as my body started breaking down lean body mass in order to try (unsuccessfully) to meet my energy needs.
---
I did the exact same hike the next weekend after researching and adding about 20% carbs and felt fantastic the whole way through.  Speed, stamina, everything improved.  This is when I realized that nutrition is vastly more complex than “protein good, carbs bad”.
---
The time for carbs is when you are actively expending significant energy.  Because it is the simplest thing to process, your body will use those carbs immediately, instead of falling back on gluconeogenesis out of necessity.
---
If you’re dieting for weight loss, or strength training/bodybuilding, keto is great, but there are times/conditions where carbs absolutely are indicated.
---
Dwarf only gets stone form every 3 min and even then hunter can spam it back on after it’s gone. Not helpful at all if the hunter wants to drain your ass he will
---
Kevin Jordan, he was  lead class designer for vanilla wow. Lots of interesting stories, and his chat is not a clusterfuck of kids begging for attention.
---
Do I stream? A little. Am I a streamer? No. Just gotta use a starwars meme when ya can.
---
I personally feel the large streamers have annoying communities more so than the streamers actually  being that bad. I find Esfand (including his chat) to be the least cringe/annoying/toxic/out of touch of the popular ones though.
---

---
No they suck don’t play one it’s terrible you can trust me I’m an anonymous reddit guy
---
yeah but i mean.. its warlocks, they have a bag less anyway.
---
Because fuck gnomes, thats why
---
Yeah that was another question about gear as a paladin I was going to ask. I presume by what youre saying is a pala to be viable they must get some raid gear. What sort of stuff are we talking about? Early tier mc boss drops or deep into the bowels of that raid?
---
nobody wants this on switch or a phone, just memetards doing memetard things.  to answer your question tho, most people were too poor or too stupid to purchase/use a computer, and it came with the added stigma of "lol computer nerd".  once idiotphones came out with simple buttons and icons that 2 year olds can figure out, it's no surprise it caught on.  also phones are the 'fad' status symbol at present, PCs never were.  it's cool to be stupid and have goldfish memory now.
---
I leveled as a warrior. Was always great having people throw buffs and heals my way. My dumb ass couldn't afford food cuz I kept buying pointless shit on the AH and at one point near 40 saved up for a mount and refused to buy anything.
---
Well I’m just wondering if they will have raidfinder like they do now for raids instead of having to join a guild and do set raid times. It just doesn’t work with my time vs how it used to be so long ago.
---
Personally I prefer smaller streamers so that you can ask them questions about their gameplay and they will respond. Snutzy is an awesome warlock streamer. He won the lvl 30 duel tourney. He’s playing an undead warlock. He always answers your questions and explains what his thinking/reasoning is. 
---
Staysafe is a gnome warlock. He’s probably the biggest streamer for lock. I find him entertaining but his stream is so big that it’s tough to get an answer from him if you have questions. 
---
Not too sure about hunter streamers.  I don’t plan on rolling that class, so I haven’t looked up any of their twitch handles.
---
I'd legit love the shit out of this. ConsolePort showed me that WoW can work really well played with a controller.
---
I'm confused, he is just saying that of course there are bugs because it's a beta, and that's what beta testing is for: Catching bugs.
---
Not really, your combat log showed it back then as well
---
Haha I'm only stuck between 60% Warlock, 15% Mage, 10% Warrior, 
---
 10% Shaman, and 5% Rogue you casual fool
---
Why’d they remove the weather aspect ?

We are looking for a feral kitty/bear that can also heal certain fights. Utility off tank.

you only focus on the negatives

what about the twinks on your team that help you win,  or helping the twinks on your team to help you win?
---
Unfortunately for me I fear thunderfury will be out of my reach, but that's a very enlightening list.
---
They said as few as possible. We won't know until the release the names.
---
you mean like we did yesterday and probably 10 times before?  
---
i hope there is a nostard containment server
---
Not really. You share most of your gear with Mages and you won't use much if any Tier gear until AQ.
---
It's weird though. While [subscriber growth](https://imgur.com/AD2Fnud) is jumping up, [comments per day](https://imgur.com/D0gi3Yq) and [posts per day](https://imgur.com/22nyUj1) are doing the opposite.
---
Hmm... I didn't find it anything like retail as there's no reinforcements.  Every game I was in was multiple hours.
---
Dps warriors were a meme in vanilla wow. Once you got AQ40 gear it was possible, but you had to tank Tier 0- Tier 2 to even get there. Tier 0 dungeons will be a major barrier to people who think they'll be DPS warriors because a prot warrior forming his own group will not pick them to compete with his loot.
---
Supreme in CSGO playing on 3g mobile network only, fight me kid.
---
Thank god
---
You have serious, serious issues.
---
Can you PM me if you do get the option after subbing, please?
---
Just going to throw it out there I can probably play with a controller better than you play with mouse/keyboard. As it is 99.99% of people play with mouse and keyboard and like 70% of you are complete dog shit at WoW. Also classic is SUPER EASY, every dungeon boss is pretty much a tank and spank, raid bosses maybe have 2 mechanics at max if they aren't just a tank and spank, classes use all of 1-4 buttons for their dps rotation (Just because you have 40 spells on your bars because your a sperg doesn't mean you actually use all of them), the list goes on an on. People ass riding this idea that Classic is some true form of challenge in WoW and that it's the hardest WoW has ever been are a fucking joke. Try killing Mythic Archimonde from WoD, or how aboujt Mythic Garrosh, or how about from this expansion Mythic Jaina or Mythic Un'nat? Literally any of these are harder then anything in Vanilla.
---
Aah shit, here we go again
---
not forcing players to sell and interact on the grey market for wow gold.  having a safe market for buying gold from other players for your salary to make the payments on PVP talents, repair bills, crafting mats and consumables is a god send.  Since they won't have the wow token in classic, that just means using third party sites for gold.
---
I meant Horde lol
---
Druid... But warrior looks cool too?
---
“KINGSLAYER GET IN ‘ERE!”
---
For better or for worse they're not using the vanilla API for classic, it's a modified version of the legion one. I'll miss the overpowered macros but I won't miss the shitty old version of lua and all the stuff that was a pain or even impossible with the old API lol
---
There are many reports that he didn’t play the account back then. Lots and lots and lots of boosting and win trading went on back then and Athene is 100% the type of person who would have done something like that
---
Of course.     
---
However, there is no problem sharing the information to players that they may not be able to log on the first few hours (and that many people could not the first 2 tests).
---
What helmet is that?
---
Staysafe and Esfand
---
🥴👌😂
---
&gt; In which scenario would an arms warrior ever be your last option? Like come on dude. And if you are struggling with finding people, why the fuck would you not try your best or AT LEAST spec into a proper pve spec? This is absolutely ridiculous.
---
It's absolutely not lol.  And you wonder why I call you an elitist.  This is literally how casual guilds work, you just invite whoever is on.  Some people are just on to pvp and will join up if they are needed.  There's tons of scenarios that happen where an arms warrior or any pvp specced class is going to end up in your raids.
---
&gt;In which scenario would an arms warrior ever be your last option?
---
I literally just gave you the fucking scenario you moron.  You are short players for a raid, but you have an arms warrior on, you invite him.  Period.  
---
&gt;why the fuck would you not try your best or AT LEAST spec into a proper pve spec?
---
There we go there is the elitist mindset I'm talking about.  "If you're joining a raid why WOULDN'T you mix/max your spec".  Some people don't play the game like that my dude, in fact, MOST don't.  If there is a guy who likes to play boomkin, he most likely isn't going to want to respec to resto because it's the 'best' spec for him.  In a casual guild that dude is staying boomkin.  If there is a hunter who likes BM, why would you make him go marks?  For one night a week?  Make him pay up 100g just so you can get that extra little bit of damage in?  I don't think you understand what casual means, and you're taking your hardcore mindset into it like any of these people give a fuck.  News flash, they don't.
---
There is debuff priority in 1.12. Not sure where MS lies, but I would hazard a guess it is not higher priority than almost any debuff raids need.

Been watching a lot but these are the ones I've watched the most recent:  
---
Stormlingx - Druid  
---
Kala - Shadow Priest  
---
Crom - Rogue  
---
kevinjordan - Warlock   
---
Stumphumpr - Warrior/Mage  
---
They've all been super cool answering questions and interacting with chat. The top 4 are pretty hardcore players and the last one is a guy I stumbled across that plays pretty casually and is just trying out classes he didn't play in the past.
---
Then you wingclip him again and keep running? It's not like he has poisons to slow you down.
---
Very intriguing.  Are you going to show up at my house and kill me?
---
Archeology is kinda cool.
---
Wish it was more lore bound.
---
Expectation: is crushing noobs in altercac valley with his thunder fury main hand.
---
Reality: Still has the WW axe, just hit 60, and is using a gun to avoid charging in and dying.
---
Why wouldn't they? We all know vanilla isn't balanced, especially at pre-60.
---
Don’t worry about them.
---
Huge fan of swampletics. Definitely slipped a freudian with this post by quoting his "incoming dopamine rush"
---
People made fun of boomkins in Vanilla as well.  There were just a lot less lemmings prior to streaming.
---
Plate gear = Decent competition on the alliance, little on the horde.
---
Mail gear = Hunter, Shamans, Pallys and warriors(Yes warriors wear mail for DPS)
---
Leather gear  = massive competition from Druids, Rogues, Hunters, Pallys, Warriors(Lots of warriors wear leather for DPS).
---
Cloth gear lots of competition from Mages, Warlocks, Priest, Pallys, Druids, Arcane shot speced hunters*
---
*Yes it's a joke.  I hope.
---
So if you wan little competition in gear roll someone who wears plate.  Mail is #2 in low demand and leather and cloth is the worst.
---
I consider myself very enthusiastic and somewhat competent and will be playing Boomkin and some of my other buddies are gonna be playing strange specs as well.   If a guild does not want us for what class or role we play than oh well something else will come along.
---
Those two sound like great spots. I can understand the appeal of a smaller streamer from what you’ve described. I honestly won’t roll another hunter unless I go into just full nostalgia mode, so checking out some warlock streamers is perfect. Thank you for your help, I really appreciate it.
---
R)
---
&gt; You can't tell me what to play.  
---
I never did. People can play whatever the fuck they want. All i'm saying is they are likely going to have a hard time getting into raids because people that "try hard" will be considered and chosen over them. This might not be the case for all meme-specs, but now we're talking about arms pve and thats one of the least favored specs in pve.
---
Just pointing out an exploitable situation. I know people want #nochanges but blizzard probably won’t ignore some of their paid services
---
Hitting peons with a blackjack in 2019.  :3
---
Isn't this already on the front page of the sub?
---
Difficulty in retail vs classic is a completely different topic having to do from the shift from gear checks to actual player skill being the key factor. Only a small % of players is meant to be able to accomplish the highest level M+ or Mythic raids, but because they have normal raids and lower M+ the decision is that it's still fine.
---
Same
---
I raided heavily back in Vanilla days / about a year into TBC then quit on only 1 toon and didn't have any alts until TBC. This time I just plan on leveling 2-3 characters and just do dungeons and PVP. Also helping randoms out or trying to solo things like I used too but less raiding due to time. What was fun for me back in the day was helping people run things or gear their alts when I wasn't hardcore raiding as a mage officer.
---
Sure. I'm subbed right now so we'll just have to wait and see until 2pm 19th now.
---
You are completely wrong, sorry, but dps warriors do decent damage at all stages of the content and do insane damage end game.
---
You will think that until you need 100 gold per week just to farm consumes for your raid and then respeccing to your raid spec. I would have less of an issue with it if it affected all classes equally, but it certainly doesn't. The game does need gold sinks, but considering that consumables are such a big part of the game you already are sinking your gold into other things.
---
Great job! However i did find one error: Kirtonos the Herald is not in Stratholme he is in Scholo
---
They are in the mindset of Sim for 99% parse dps or fail. This is a mindset that people who have no mind of their own adopt. Also, because they are self aware of their lack of own mind, feel the need to lord over others their superiority that they had zero inpact on obtaining (either by getting lucky gear drops, being told exactly how to play, or both) in order to feel better about themselves. 
---
In the end, anyone saying "you will never find a guild LOL" prolly is projecting because they know full well they offer nothing as a human being to find a group to accept them for anything other than being the top of the line meta that someone else taught them.
---
Funny thing is, all of them would be in for a rude awakening when they realize if 90% of the elite playerbase rolls warrior or rogue, there WILL NOT be enough gear for all of them. Like 10% of those people will actually get the gear to perform at the level that all those logs they chase after do.
---
The Rep bonus for humans actually sucks, I’ve found. Most mobs in the world that give rep give +5 on a kill, which with the +10% human modifier, does... NOTHING. 0.5 rep does not round up to 1. You only get a bonus on a 10+ rep kill and for quests, which just always give more than 10. 
---
In the overall I found the rep bonus to be very underwhelming in real application.
---
7 times a minute, weapon doesn't matter
---
Leveling (including leveling professions) was really my favorite part of the game. In vanilla I only did Molten Core on one character and never moved into BWL because my guild wasn't very good (and I wasn't very good!). I ended up with four level 60s. I'm now making plans for classic to start multiple classes all with mutually beneficial professions.
---
cool
---
Starting out yeah there will be a lot of warriors. All the specs are viable. Only class in the game that can say that. Also they will be the only tanks for the most part. Anyone who tanks for their guild in Live will probably role warrior. 
---
Yes druids can tank but let’s be honest they will not be the majority of druids. 
---
I bet warriors have the highest drop off rate after 40 though. The grind 40 to 60 on a warrior is a slog solo. I think by 60 things will even out a lot.
---
While warriors are great, most guildless warriors won’t make it to max level. Will see tacked on to recruitment spams. “Not accepting Warriors at this time” Every sperg our there wants to be a MT for a guild with a Thunderfury but 99% of them won’t want to put in the work to deserve it.
---
48 hours to ding 15 and take down RFC and Wailing Caverns.

Fair enough :)

Ulduar was the only saving grace for Wrath.  DKs started off wildly OP. The questing was terribly boring and samey and lacked any soul. (unless you're an edgelord) The shining star of Wrath was the Kvaldir.. but compared to the epic stories in each Outland zone, I simply couldn't take Northrend. I had so many alts sitting at 70.
---
42
---
Dps warriors are still the #1 melee dps class in the game in pre raid bis.  This gap continues to grow as the raids progress. 
---
Not sure where you are getting it’s a meme. 
---
Unless you’re talking about farming for that pre raid bis because yeah I def agree with you
---
Alright I see what you mean.
---
Still the main subject was bread is not a good source of carbs.
---
Prefer non processed carbs.
---
Nah just have some sort of identifier for people playing on mobile. If you don't want to take them don't, if they want to form their own groups let them
---
You could pretty much clear all of mc/bwl and probably to either huhuran or twin emps in AQ40 before you are forced to try very hard. My server was full of raiding guilds and we had like 15 or so at 4-5 kills in naxx and up to twin emps, then after that we had 1 horde guild stuck on cthun, 1 alliance guild with cthun kill(s) and no KT kills to my knowledge
---
Slower weapon the better
---
Seen so many people downvoted for pointing that out.
---
I started playing vanilla shortly after MC had come out, and this is literally what my friends were telling me to keep me motivated to hit max level.
---
"don't worry, you get to 60 and then you can do all the cool stuff". Endgame pvp happens at 60, raiding happens at 60, cool gear happens at 60.
---
"Game starts at max level" absolutely started in vanilla, people just apparently don't like hearing that anymore.
---
Generally, the reason for that is the lack of sustain given to them - arguably any ret's or ret hybrid's should be in charge of maintaining Judgement of Wisdom - I recommend on rotation with a second ret so that they can mana dump with judgements, seal twisting etc.
---
They can also be placed into the tank group to augment the tank by granting enhancement with aura's.
---
SoC is a proc-per-minute effect, meaning you'll want slower weapons with high average damage.
---
Isnt this what they did in legion? Where gear stopped mattering except for incremental stat increases but the stats were made uniform?
---
Would be so glorious if they went alliance..gnome for example lol.
---
Simple because the fact that majority of pvp players are horde. Would love to see them rage hehe
---
Who still cares for stresstest?
---
7PPM.
---
&gt;In short, anything that procs based on PPM in vanilla is set to a soft PPM, which means that the proc rate is a percentage based on your base weapon speed.  This means for things like Seal of Command, which functions on a soft PPM of 7, using a 3.8 speed weapon, the chance to proc is 44.3% per swing. However, using attack speed enchants, you can get more than 7 procs per minute over large sample sizes. So whether the proc is based on PPM or is a flat percentage, no matter what it is, attack speed will increase the uptime, or number of procs. In this case, yes, if you are a nightfall bot for your guild, you will want to use the 3 1% attack speed enchants (Helm, Gloves, and Legs) and also use Seal of the Crusader for 43% Melee haste. Also make sure to use HoJ, which is an effective extra 2% melee haste, bringing you to 45%.

https://forum.nostalrius.org/viewtopic.php?f=43&amp;t=33479
---
While it's the nostalrius forum, the numbers are identical to vanilla.
---
What? Why? I just have a different opinion and view on things. Feel free to join the discussion, but if you got nothing better to say, just leave it to yourself. Thank you.
---
A DPS warrior will be tanking the tier 0 dungeons. You do not need to be protection spec'd to tank them.
---
Its going to be a lot less epic because wsg and AV are very old obviously and the meta transformed heavily, specs, playstyles and keybinds are a thing of the past, we were clickers, 95% of us, with laggy internet. Like he said, if 50% of the experience remaibs, then it's a great success. It will be fun tho am sure, hypes real and the game is vastly different from the past 4-5 expansions. Expect a new game, nothing like retail but nothing like classic, that was like Woodstock, once in a lifetime.
---
General Reposti? Is that you?
---
Seriously, not trying to shit on the post, but this happens multiple times a week. And it's always countered with Nostalrius didn't do nearly as much work as those ancestors who fell before them and developed the code. They were just the most popular.
---
And even without a warrior tank sometimes you need one more dps, but one with CC so warrior is out
---
Oh yeah. It's totally not a problem. You can be full retribution or full shadow priest and be totally fine being the main healer in a any dungeon group in classic. You will quest and level TONS faster/easier as shadow/ret. The only people who will level as holy priest/paladin will be people who have no idea what they're doing. You should be shadow priest while leveling to 60. You should be retribution while leveling to 60. Holy for either class will only make you want to quit playing, while only marginally making you a tiny bit better at healing. The only time you want to switch over to spec holy for either class is the moment you step into raiding MC and beyond.
---
The shadow priest gear you obtain while leveling (#1 spirit, #2 int, and #3 stamina) will work perfectly with healing in dungeon groups as well. However, with paladin you will want to switch from retribution gear (+strength mail/plate) to healing gear (+intellect mail/plate gear) for dungeon healing.
---
Even if its not money, you still exchange the most valuable resource. Time. You can earn money, but you cannot earn time.  If you fuck around, and have to retake classes, that would be an epic waste of your life.
---
Or you don't want to respect constantly and like to PVP?
---
Or you have a group of people who just DONT GIVE A SHIT and play the game however, fail or not, and are perfectly fine with any result?
---
Or a group of friends who are comfortable enough with themselves to not need to judge each other for not being optimal, and just live with their choices?
---
There is a world that exists outside your mindset. Try to accept that.
---
Mangos devs are underappreciated.
---
&gt; If you don't think its worth the effort or just want the raids to be more challenging, then don't get the world buffs.
---
Melderon argues players who normally wouldn't consider getting world buffs will feel compelled to do so to compete against others who use them to top meters.  What do you say to the video's rebuttal of your point?
---
All classes can say that all specs are viable. Unless you are talking about PvE only but then again not all warrior specs are viable for pve
---
0.5 came with AQ40 patch so you'd have to compare it with AQ40 and Rank 10 gear.
---
Yeah it seems like Blizz felt that auras and totems would give paladins and shaman more of an up on the front lines kind of feel...that didn't really happen.
---
This I think is normal behavior from Classic.  Someone correct me if wrong, but the original servers "served" zone by zone, even though the world was seamless.  That's why you usually had areas devoid of enemies along zone boundaries / sometimes would see what looks like modern sharding along boundaries that did.  Good example is the crocs between Durotar and Barrens.
---
Layering, of course, is still a best-worst solution, and will be a travesty if left in Classic beyond phase 1 or even the launch.
---
If population doesn't drop as they expect, the proper response will be *more realms*.
---
U R DuMbO
---
Aww, is this little snowflake mad his American education failed him completely?
---
Wait wait... I thought Blizz said that the +5 to certain weap skills basically supersedes the code to ignore the first +1% hit a player has if a mob has 315 defense. So ready humans or orcs get an effective +1% hit, not 3%, no?
---
How much does that affect Dps? Like are they at the bottom of the charts because of so little uptime?
---
For raids? Never
---
If $15 is too rich for your blood, you may want to just save your money.
---
If it's more "Will I get $15 worth of out of it" I'd say for two days of access, sure. That's like seeing a 2 hour movie or going out to fast food.
---
Every single person here saying this is a good idea, you do not really want wow classic and you're lying to yourself
---
Fun fact it will be even worse when people actually want to win instead of having fun and when they have the gear to rush it.
---
Enjoy :)
---
Blizzard wants to put in layering because it requires less effort and costs than releasing multiple servers and merging them later. That would solve the issues that layering is trying to "fix" and eliminates exploiting. But costs costs costs, screw gameplay!
---
I thought if you do flips into the raid boss it will remove the bridge and he'll fall into lava?
---
Gotta max some characters for the potential TBC launch 👌🏻
---
Probably true in alot situations vs hunters, but add rogue blind+poisons counter and fearward on top. I don't see any competition for pve and pvp for best priest race.
---
Nope
---
dwarf female looks best on a tiger
---
Don’t wrongly correct people if you have no idea what you are talking about.
---
To make things worse you now are playing the victim card.
---
Layering shouldn’t affect higher level zones such as where the BL spawns are locates.
---
You can thank both :)
---
Respectfully, it sounds like you're saying "wait until it's not a zerg."
---
It can't hurt. They have plenty of utility and can even go tank to help gather the mobs and save you some stress of potentially messing up the rotation and dying, picking off some mobs that may run. You'll certainly be fighting a lot of mages in all the good aoe grinding zones, so be ready for that and potentially a lot of waiting for mobs in hope you get the tags.
---
You’re welcome , happy to help !
---
Ogay
---
A dps warrior *can* tank Tier 0 dungeons, but many of them won't. That's why they chose to be DPS warriors, because they don't want the responsibility of tanking.
---
You actually legitimately think that this is the minority?
---
Wow you elitists really do need to convince yourselves of an alternate reality to comfort your poor, tortured souls huh?
---
I mean guess what? I was in a guild that did this and completed up to Naxx and was fine with it. I am in one in Live that is ok with only doing heroic raids when many have completed Mythic. In fact, I found numerous guilds with that mindset with less than 1 day of looking each time. 
---
But go ahead and try to justify being a dick to people online for daring to not follow YOUR golden standard.
---
Obviously casuals are not going to have these, duh.
---
The good stuff is reserved for people who put in the effort and play the game, this isn't retail where you can get top tier gear if you play 2 hours a day.
---
Well, there's not that much to say anymore I feel like. And then we get the same posts every once in a while that are downvoted so far and so fast.
---
Of course there are those times we get the spam on subject X. Wondering what the next will be, we got streamers, sniping and blacklists. We had those million posts on Layering. 
---
Whatever will ruin classic next.
---
It‘d 3% **hit** not 3% **damage**.
---
I don‘t know how I can make this clearer to you.
---
Nope - in both cases streaming platform would work as a proxy between Blizzard and your controlling device. Plus Blizzard really didn't wanted to share more on this topic as it would help cheap apps to bypass their systems :) For WoW on Stadia/Nvidia to be "ok" you would have to have Blizzard client apps running on you device so they can check you and play the game streamed... kind of awkward and bit problematic for Blizz to setup.
---
*laughs in kidney strike*
---
Meh, I'm not the biggest raider (more a pvp guy), but I wanted to dip my toe in the water, so to speak, and try Legion. That said, it felt like it would have taken more investment than I wanted to commit try the raids - also, while leveling, I tried a dungeon and was completely put off by the mad rush through. Being more of a pvper, at max, I tried that, but personally found it unfulfilling, at best. All the colors and lasers bothered me, too. Just my opinion.
---
&gt;but how many will actually go protection?
---
I'd first ask how many will quit because leveling is so tedious
---
They loot boxed a damn beta for a 15 year old relaunch. Pretty scummy shit right there.
---
 Nice
---
There's not much gear in MC that helps a paladin tank. You want stam, armor, and spell damage which can pretty much only be found on T0.5 and T2.
---
If you plan to aoe level - you'll do so in about 6 months
---
A tank pally with a shield spike could work, and you would be able to farm areas with caster mobs that usually mages will avoid.
---
If you don't see the option in the launcher you might not get it but then again you can always request a refund anyway.
---
I do. It was mostly a joke. I guess more accurately an exaggeration of how dps and healers are looked at by guild recruiters.
---
Well guess we will have to wait and see :P
---
Oh it’s that time of the day again I see.
---
replace thunderclap with 2x battle shout
---
Mulgore won't be spared, but it'll still be better than Valley of Trials or Tirisfal.
---
That church needs to be a bit more rundown.
---
&gt; jealous pink-skins 
---
Is that you commander Shran?
---
Mage + Paladin makes a great AoE team with the right spec and gear. Consecration, Holy Shield, Blessing of Protection, it's all good.
---
Having played for 15 years, playing both factions and having a strong affinity for the horde, I have found that the people who comprise each faction are the same. They are the same shitters who one shot you when ur lvl 32 and they are 60 in t2. They are the same shitters who ineffectively play their non heal spec. Same shitty hunters that dont know to hit the sundered target. The only thing that is different is that more horde queue for BGs resulting in short queue times for alliance. As much as I'd like to paint alliance as turbo virgin white knights and horde as sweaty neckbeards with anger problems, your faction dont mean shit about you as a player.
---
This man speaks the truth
---
Classic could definetly benefit from a few more raid mechanics, particularly MC and BWL. However I think there is something to be said for classics 40man lots of leeway raids. There's room to bring along your friends, room to bring along that balance druid as the guild mascot, room to bring in people who aren't 100% up to date on the content, room to bring along people who help out the guild and just want to raid for the fun of it. The easierness of vanilla raiding helps make raiding a more widely social experience and less finally tuned multiplayer gaming experience. I think things like this are why people are so afraid of touching anything in vanilla. Lets say they redid MC with much more in-depth mechanics...how would that change the social dynamics of guilds as they're just getting started. BfA has LFR to help people get into raiding, WoW just has MC, so as much as we can complain about its simplify, MC really is where you go to learn how to raid.
---
You can get 60 unique binds on any modern game controller using two buttons as modifiers, or 208 using four buttons as modifiers.
---
If you subtract the home button since consoles don't let you bind that, that leaves 56 with two modifiers and 192 with four modifiers.
---
When 4 out of 5 members can potentially tank, do you really NEED a tank?
---
Oh, we agree totally in that point.  My kids get bacon and eggs on normal days for breakfast, and only get pancakes when they have baseball or another activity.  Has the bonus that they look forward to sports and hiking because that means they get pancakes :)
---
Whaaaaa.. The questing in Wrath was infinitely better than Outland. The only zone that can really compete in Outland is Nagrand.
---
GIVE ME A SOURCE THAT SAYS ITS STRONGER.
---
Wellllll, it depends. If you look at Deathknell currently, yes the church is rundown. But there was a time when that church was standing strong.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPa7bu1q7D4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPa7bu1q7D4)
---
but who care about people you meet for WC? you'll spam LFG in trade chat, get a group, rush through the thing in 30 min, then move on with your questing.
---
maybe you'll form bond with people when chain-spamming strat-scholo-brs to get your raid BIS, or when there's barely anyone in your level range cause you've been playing non-stop for 48 hours.
---
but believing community will form spontaneously in low-level content just cause it's classic... especially at launch? hell no, people will be busy lvl'ing and if grouping with you slow them down, you can bet they'll  be gone faster than you can blink.
---
Yeah sure. The hardest part about aoe farming is the pull, an extra player literally of any class can help a lot. AoE farming is never really better as 2man but it's not neccesarily worse as long as you pull well, and a paladin can help in emergencies (or even res if you die), and ofc help a bit with consecration.
---
I literally just showed you how to calculate the flops of a CPU so you could do the math yourself.
---
People saying warrior is a rough leveling to the point it'll make people quit with the class probably isn't watching the same streams I am. People got this concept that Warrior is really hard to level because private servers did a lot of things wrong, things like life regeneration when out of combat, possibly crit chance, parry, early armor drop rates, harder elites, etc. All of those things made for a miserable experience being melee on a private server, a thing I don't really recall being that big of a deal back then. Sure, it's harder than doing ranged damage and kiting enemies or having a pet to tank for you, but as shown by people streaming: once you get a nice weapon you become a grinding machine with little downtime between pulls.
---
I think those leveling difficulty scales people used to do will change a lot when Classic comes up. Hunter will still be the first place, sure, but I'm starting to think there is a change that Rogue and Paladin will go down and Warrior will come up because of how much they can tank and deal damage at the same time.
---
That said, tanking is "hard" and a bad tank will be called on it and this can make Warriors don't even try it more than once. Also, a lot of people playing Warrior finds it boring, so Tanks are always a good friend to have added. :p
---
&gt; You actually legitimately think that this is the minority?
---
Absolutely.
---
&gt;Wow you elitists
---
There's nothing "elitist" about demanding people pull their own weight in a GROUP EFFORT ACTIVITY.
---
If you want to be mad at something, be mad at the fact WoW uses the instance system to begin with. The game is literally *designed* to be "elitist".
---
Definitely true. Time is the only commodity we can't buy. So it confuses me when people waste it on working a bajillion hours a week and then complain that they don't have enough time to play Classic... Like duh.. try working less maybe?
---
Not really. Classic isn't a guaranteed success.
---
OSRS was doing terrible before they released new content to expand OSRS beyond original rune scape.
---
If only there were some sort of test these people could be in... with an in-game bug reporting tool.
---
Wouldn’t you demo shout before the battleshout to reduce damage taken? Or does battleshout cost less rage?
---
Desperate prayer is awesome. But the main reason is fear ward, having 3-5 dwarf priests goes a long way.
---
I don’t know, I don’t want to discuss this ad nauseam. Many people will just tell me here how I am wrong etc. and that is a giant waste of my time.
---
Moreso, if you are an NE priest, you are wearing a newbie badge. You telegraph to everyone that you are super casual or new to the game.
---
Many of us are racists.
---
I would recommend to check into a few YouTube videos or guides. What I am saying is not really disputable, have someone offer perspective that puts in more effort than me.
---
If you still want to go NE, all the power to you. But please, consider doing yourself a favor and inform yourself first. And don’t dismiss opinions because you don’t want them to be true, like most the bullies do in this sub.
---
I see the option in the launcher, cant click play though but the stress test isnt live yet so well have to wait.
---
Its not a rebuttal, being compelled to do something isnt forcing someone to do it.
---
If being at the top is what they want then they will have to get the buffs.
---
Are you against people getting "compelled" to get BIS gear to top the meters aswell?
---
Hahaha nice. Another thing is that the mobs on the beta are hitting for way less than people remember. The private servers seem to have slowly buffed the content.
---
Low mythics are mainly what I was talking about. It’s not a different topic because leveling should prepare you for entry level content at 120 (m0 and low keys are). If they wanted you to spend time with normal and heroic dungeons they wouldn’t have made the loot for them irrelevant within a day of reaching 120. Should have mentioned I wasn’t speaking about raids though, you’re right about them.
---
I guess comments like this are clearly "the discussion" and not you having issues right? 
---
Excellent addition to the conversation, attacking an individual for not wanting to play with you since you are... attacking individuals.
---
Crendor and Strippin are my two that I watch.
---
I pity the fool that doesn't.
---
Ones that are likely to cause just as much of an outburst from the community as layering already has, yes.
---
Same concept.  It's increasing convenience in some way.
---
But hey, they're *totally* different and not valid comparisons at all because there were no technical limitations to distributing movies for people to watch at home, putting news on the Internet, building pocket calculators, etc, amirite?  Your argument is akin to saying cinemas would all have to start showing movies in 4:3 ratios to match televisions.
---
Have you never played a console game with an ability wheel and modifier buttons?  No abilities would need to be trimmed from the PC version.  Gameplay would be slightly clunkier on a console, but honestly, unless you're PvPing or raiding, you're probably not using more than a couple abilities anyway.  There are numerous people in this thread claiming to play WoW with a console controller just fine.
---
It depends on many things, hence the inherently. It's just odd to say "bread is unhealthy" when someone mentions bread. If you ONLY eat bread, it's a bad idea, but that is not what was said.
---
Don't know about you, but I had the Herald of Woe
---
I'm sorry you have no faith in the community. Low level content is not easy to solo groups will be made, if you're leveling consistently in the same zone with the same people you should get the elite quests around the same time. I hope you find the solo content you are looking for.
---
Consistent is good because it has less variable dps and is a more reliable method for knowing how much you can pull rather than hoping for crits and big hits every so often. 1h + shield is just that, it has a shield you have more defense with dmg that is just as good as 2h + rockbiter. If you accidentally get adds you're more likely to be able to deal with them as 1h enhance compared to 2h RB that has less defense and relies more heavily on crits.
---
Not such a dumb thing when you actually stop to think about what variables there are when leveling.
---
I keep waffling between mage and priest.
---
In dungeons/raids, I enjoy both equally. It's a lot easier to find a group as a priest, but farming is 10x better on a mage.
---
I'm planning to raid, and most of my time will be spent on my main, so an alt might not hit 60 for a year or two.
---
So to put another spin on things. If I was to level as prot warrior with a healing priest (the wife) would we be pretty efficient at levelling? I know you can still tank while levelling as dps, but i would like to be fully competent when the time comes.
---
And thats not good enough. I gave you way more sources saying its stronger in both departments and have used the PS3 and Switch and its fucking obvious the switch shits on the PS3 in every department.
---
Also the wikipedia pages literally listed both of the CPUS and their gflops. SPECIFICALLY CPUS. But your saying it isn't.
---
Wait I don’t see it on there, I see my account and region but see nothing about the stress test
---
While I won’t be reading all of this, I’m very happy to know somebody went through all the trouble of doing this!
---
Pink skies overhead
---
Your departed friends below
---
Rise when the time comes!
---
There will definitely not be a raid finder, or a dungeon finder for that matter.
---
WoW is on the slow side, but 300ms will just not feel good to play.
---
I recently looked at a server I hadnt played on since wrath and found a lvl 32 hunter from vanilla who I never finished leveling. Still had arrows. Made me chuckle a little
---
Some people don't think Dwarves are the master race. Those people are wrong.
---
Even then it still relies on big hits and crits unlike 1h enhance. It's not nearly as consistent which means it's not as good for speed leveling when you could go a long time with no crits meaning you have more downtime from taking longer to kill the mobs.
---
If multiple people are able to get the quest tag like it works on private servers it wont be too horrible.
---
People are so negative, I just did exactly what op did and yet you down  vote it, both have there value and yet posting pictures like this gets people butt hurt. Talking about negativity in a game, I've never seen so many people try and run bfa down as I have now precious classic is out.. Lol I'll still play both as both games have there qualities.
---
Wasn’t that just for original CE and nothing else?
---
Not everyone is going to have rank 14 gear cause it's not really progressive. A lot of people myself included will only ever attempt rank 10 gear. And from how it sounds over 75% of players never made it past mc/bwl
---
My main since mid-Naxx40 has been a Lock but before that I was a Rogue from MC -&gt; starting Naxx40. The decision struggle is real.
---
that, and battle shout generates more rage than a thunderclap or demo would. Piggybacking it onto a revenge cements threat like crazy.
---
asd
---
I said DPS warriors were a meme, not are. Back in 2005 the idea of warrior dps was laughable to the majority of the player base.
---
This, exactly.  "Come back tomorrow" design.  I hate it and am done with it.
---
That’ll be what it is, then. I had a teldrassil owl.
---
dude he says they can enable layering on the 1.12 client. do you know how retarded that is? prolly not right. just type some random meme and hit downvote please :)
---
I waana wait this out until it gets 69 ir 6.9k upvotes so i can get free karma
---
See this is the sort of thing that confuses me. I actually try to take a serious stance and say "I'm going to do that" then someone comes in and blows it out the water. I know vanilla is very diverse but it really splits opinions.
---
That is exactly the video :)
---
Many many thanks!! That is perfect to start few toons in Classic. It wil spread the people apart for the FRESH start!
---
dude I fucking miss pasta though &gt;.&lt;
---
Nice. Hopefully I can get some guild runs going so every orb goes to a guildie and the chance pattern drop should also benefit us as a whole. If memory serves me, truefaith drops from last boss in strat live so even more reason to do it.
---
PW:S before Charge.
---
This here is the problem, you're ragestarving your warrior friend. Don't do that and let him get a bit of aggro before doing whatever and healing (and don't use mind blast).
---
Yeah I try my best. It’s a bit more difficult when trying to lose weight. On top of that it is pretty hard for me as I happen to be on a keto diet. That makes eating *a lot* of beans or *a lot* of nuts difficult (sorry if I should have mentioned this before).
---
I still believe it requires a lot of discipline to get to 38g every day.
---
Currently making an xsheet that lists fiber and net carbs. Hope I can find a few more things to support it.
---
Keep in mind though you are not going to eat 100g of peanut butter and in many cases not hundreds of grams of fruit.
---
Definitely thanks though, I appreciate your response a lot!
---
I’m stumped between Tauren paladin or Dwarf shaman
---
"A priest on my WSG team named \[name\] was unkillable during a match around \[time\]. Instead of dying the priest stayed at 1hp"
---
they did do that in retail, and I agree it's a good move. But this is classic so #NoChanges
---
Can’t wait to name my rogue leatherdaddy
---
The falls is where it’s at!
---
A competent way to gear up at max level. In Vanilla WoW your only options are raid with 39 other people to kill bosses that drop 2(two) pieces of loot each, or PvP 16 hours a day because of the shitty ranking system. Don't raid or feel like spending literally all your waking hours PvPing? You're stuck in shitty dungeon blues until the next expansion.
---
zoodles work well enough for me
---
I haven’t played warrior in so long and I didn’t play one in vanilla. I’m excited to have stance dancing as my kit since it looks like it’ll be the most skill required class for PvE.
---
When do you see that time in game?
---
yeah I'd love to use the original client and watch people fly and speed hack all over the fucking place
---
You are still handicapping your raid at 15 debuffs rather than 16.
---
Are you going to level enchanting at level 5 to get the wand? Can't buy one off the AH on release. Leveling enchanting is going to take far longer than just running around trying to tag with melee.
---
AOE grinding for the first few months after release is going to be slower than just grinding, especially with a partner.
---
Lol what? God you're fucking retarded
---
Haha chill out mate, I just saw the picture and was reminded of Deathknell.
---
it's pretty essential. there are lots of noob traps in abilities like rend/heroic strike and thunder clap
---
In vanilla thunderclap is pretty much useless unless you really need to dump rage.
---
To elaborate by “healthy” I mean the darker less sugary bread as opposed to toast. Not making a judgment on whether bread is healthy or not. I just am talking about the one with seeds and nuts in it.
---
I do not eat bread myself. I don’t consider it healthy either, so I will be the one that defends you here. *But bread is also not unhealthy*. It’s main advantage is getting a lot of calories and being flexible with the taste.
---
I love this keep em coming boys
---
As another user pointed out, you're not going to be able to AOE level until 6 months a brand new server come out.
---
It's been an hour, I think your logic broke him.
---
Your tears sustain me.

I hate that I don't hate this.
---
Shhh he wants to play the victim let him have his fun.
---
Im on one of those shady servers atm. Spent like 200g yesterday just leveling engineering 1-300 most of that gold was on low level stuff. So inflation is real Boys
---
Blizzard already said it's gunna be crossrealm BGs
---
The perks of playing Druid, I don’t have to compromise.
---
Pretty much this. Unless layering is somehow going to be exploitable to some insane degrees.
---
While leveling, going Fury is better for tanking.  You won’t take enough damage for mitigation talents to matter.  At the same time, getting crit will proc Enrage, which is a huge damage boost.
---
Outside of dungeons, a Fury warrior with a healer is an insanely powerful questing duo.
---
Carba are not inherently bad. It’s just that on their own they are not good either.
---
You need a lot of micros. It’s easy to fill full with bread and not have room left for other foods that add all the micros we need.
---
7 day free trials then.
---
Based on the current region/realm list and player population sizes, my guess is 41 servers.
---
China gets 5 PVP and 5 PVE.
---
EU English gets 3 PVP, 3 PVE, and 1 RP.
---
US Pacific and US East get 2 PVP, 2 PVE, and 1 RP (each).
---
US Mountain, US Central, Oceania, EU French, EU German, Taiwan, and Korea get 1 PVP and 1 PVE (each).
---
Latin America, Brazil, EU Spanish, EU Russian, EU Italian get none.
---
With 41 servers, Blizzard can support a minimum of ~600,000 players at launch (2 Layers per continent) and, from what we've seen in the previous Stress Tests, at least ~1,700,000 players if needed (6 Layers per continent). This will support ~150,000 players when Layering is removed ~2 months after launch, which I think is a reasonable number for Classic playerbase retention after the tourists leave.
---
I wouldn't level as prot. You can tank with arms/fury and use a 2H. Especially if your wife is rolling a priest, you won't have to worry about sustain. Re-roll into prot once you hit 60.
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/LLxjBGN.png](https://i.imgur.com/LLxjBGN.png)
---
You can’t do any tanking as a prot pala, especially if time is a factor.
---
Warrior or Druid, those are the tanks
---
being able to channel the powers of the twisting nether is still a net gain for recruiting a warlock over another DPS.
---
Keto here too :/ fiber is a struggle especially while I still try to lose weight (but soon I can increase calories)
---
Found the NE Hunter
---
As a percentage:
---
7 procs per minute Divided by (60 Seconds Divided by Weapon Speed).
---
- 60(Seconds) / 3.8(Weapon Speed) ~ 15.7
---
- 7(Procs Per Minute) / 15.7 = .4458… (44%)
---
|Weapon Speed|% chance to proc on hit|
---
--:|--:|
---
|2.0|23.33%|
---
|2.4|28.00%|
---
|2.6|30.33%|
---
|2.9|34.22%|
---
|3.2|37.72%|
---
|3.5|41.22%|
---
|3.8|44.72%|
---
|4.0|46.67%​|
---
All even out to 7 procs per minute. It's best to have it hit big, since 7 procs of 500 is better than 7 procs of 200.
---
Point of raiding is to get gear for PvP. The world (along with items like skull, engineering items, consumes) is what makes PvP in Vanilla fun.
---
Yep, I am very happy about that. Don't need that on my server
---
Lots of recipes that taste basically the same! Try out many keto recipes. Some are super surprising.
---
I’m guessing there will be a nice courteous queue at every sleeping peon?
---
I am ignorant. As you can see from my stance on it I’m not a min/maxer so no I don’t know the exact % that having escape artist vs shadowmeld as a rogue will help you in PvP but what I do know is I did just fine in one of the top raiding guilds on my server in Vanilla as a NE Druid so you don’t need to do it to be successful in PvE. I believe it is unhealthy for the game and promotes an elitist mentality against those who don’t which is why I speak negatively of it. Unless you are pushing to be literally the best on your server then I think it is unnecessary and you should happily roll your night elf priest.
---
For a solved game there sure seems to be a lot of difference of opinion.
---
Crucify me if you wish.. But I don't think personal loot is that awful IF YOU GET THE CHOICE TO STILL USE MASTER LOOT.
---
If I have to PUG a raid because my guild falls behind or gets busy, I find it hard to trust I will be taken into serious consideration if I'm in a half PUG, half guild run. What am I going to do, accuse the raid leader of giving bias to his guildies over me in world chat? No one will care.
---
I'd love to have the option for us all to roll the dice on personal loot, especially when you're pugging more than 5 spots.
---
100% me hahaha
---
There is not class indecisiveness if you simply play everything, I dont have to worry about a thing!
---
Sign me up. I have 3 girls so will only be on casually after bedtimes!! On EU server.
---
Yeah, I like rogue group pvp, too. Trouble is, this makes you a bit of an x-factor. Fun, but it can definitely be frustrating when the other team isn't being aggressive, and you're sitting on your hands waiting. But worth it, because once a few dumb pricks get a little too cute, and you lock them down to get melted, it can shift the balance of a fight real quick.
---
What a dumb fucking question
---
I'll be interested to see some of the posts people have for newer stuff. I'm old school too, Laintime, Neilyo, noone(mage). to add a few. forgot about drakedogg.
---
There is not much more to say in this case than I already said. People know the advantages and disadvantages or can look it up. The point of my comment is to offer a bit of a different perspective.
---
Server transfers were indeed a thing in vanilla, it just had some limitations like you can't transfer from a PvE server to a PvP server.
---
And stupid fucks like yourself keep acting like there hasn't been a late trend with bugs and issues carrying over from beta to release as evident in their latest trash expansions.
---
Thank you!  I did have that, I also remember having a shitty 2h epic polearm I think.  I was browsing online but still haven't found it lol
---
No it isn't
---
You are absolutely blind if you think its the minority.
---
It is possible to do things with non optimal specs, in Vanilla, up to Naxx. There are loads of players who are fine with this. There are loads of players not looking to race. The instance system it is designed for not only allows this flexibility for a LOT of its content, it was basically encouraging it with its specs. Developers have provided quotes of things such as intending for Shaman, Hunters, and Warlocks to be able to pick up tanking duties for a long period of time in dungeons. 
---
Again, you keep stating opinions as facts.  You are putting words into an entire playerbases mouth. And you are completely ignoring the fact that the game was played that way then and thus, can be now. 
---
But I mean, I know for a fact when you use terms like "pull their own weight" that you have a pretty stubborn mindset and won't change. Not like it matters, most of us who don't give a shit will be happy to be avoided by you :P
---
Esfand has connections. If you think you can get into raids go ahead but it'll be difficult
---
Oh yeah. So for aoe farming, mage + mage is really good. But mage + paladin is very good too. Paladins can aoe tank (to an extent) while you aoe. Plus, if you die by fucking up an aoe pull, the paladin will likely survive cuz paladins have AMAZING survivability (best in the game). They will be able to rez you after combat (you will LOVE the fact that the paladin can rez in classic because the graveyard runs are fucking long!) Paladins also can heal you, can cast blessing of protection, blessing of freedom, blessing of salvation, lay on hands, etc etc. They have so many useful tools! So I'd say overall mage + paladin benefits are equal if not more to the benefits from going mage + mage.
---
The biggest of thumbs up from here! Well done, sir!
---
&gt;And thats not good enough. I gave you way more sources saying its stronger in both departments and have used the PS3 and Switch and its fucking obvious the switch shits on the PS3 in every department.
---
Again, no, you showed "sources" that say the overall performance is better, not CPU performance. Honestly, what part of that don't you understand?
---
&gt;Also the wikipedia pages literally listed both of the CPUS and their gflops. SPECIFICALLY CPUS. But your saying it isn't. Even though it goes against you.
---
And again, no, the wikipedia pages don't list the CPU flops specifically, only total or GPU.
---
You mind sending me some info about the guild first? Looking for some specific criteria to fill when joining a guild.
---
This post reminds me of when my old dad laughs a bit too hard at his own jokes.
---
Being born in NYC is similar to starting a new toon with 0 gold on a highly inflated realm, best to roll your birth on a newer realm.
---
I see why you wouldn’t in a raid because a debuff slot. But it says in the tool tip it generates additional threat, is this not accurate? I see why you wouldn’t want to use heroic strike or rend (outside of a 5 man) because sunder armor and revenge generate the most threat. Wouldn’t demo shout and thunderclap (since it reduces attack speed) be good on trash mobs so your healer won’t have to use as much mana between pulls?
---
Is there any chance that this download is the same client we will need for Classic's actual release? Or do y'all think we're gonna have to download another game file for Classic's final release?
---
Do I even need a VPN to create an account on their side of servers?
---
Ideally you want to the make the goal to kill a boss rather than on directly acquiring gear.
---
[This video](https://youtu.be/hhJ78qfgrK4) explains why it’s quicker better than I can. You don’t have to believe me but it is factually faster because it’s more efficient. Assuming you can earthbind kite properly of course. If you just stand in front of the mob and don’t use the technique, which admittedly is much less stressful, then yeah the other way is faster. But otherwise it’s not.
---
He's not really acting like a cry baby here, he just doesn't want to win by cheating. I think you're letting your hatred for a particular guild cloud your judgment.
---
What does that have to do with cheating on the stadia. The detection mechanisms would be the same whether or not the cheating happened on PC or another platform since blizzard would have the same information available to them in both situations.
---
Druid then. Best anti-poison class (maybe next to shaman).
---
Very puntable though
---
Issue with BFA is it literally only has content for hardcore progress players. Its basically legion minus artifacts, class halls, mage tower, Suramar story,etc. But in terms of raiding content its still great CoS is probably the hardest raid Blizzard will ever make next to ToS. And thats really why the ckntent drought happened.
---
so you never played classic. thanks for the info
---
But will strategize in the middle of combat like San Tzu and design ingenious mass destruction gadgets out of otherwise benign QoL items.
---
I should try it out, thanks.
---
Calm down. I just don't think that this scenario that you gave, really exists. I could be wrong, but honestly if you are a casual guild and you lack players and the players you got refuse to play a proper pve spec, then are you even raiding at that point? I've never been in a guild that is THIS casual so I don't know. I can't speak for other classes like moonkin or bm hunters but arms warrior is just so bad that I think most would prefer to have them respec. I'm not saying that it's impossible to down anything as a casual guild, but if you except to do BWL, AQ and especially Naxx, you have to at least play some proper pve specs.
---
In my short time on keto so far, I've found fiber isn't too hard, but mostly cus the shit I wanna eat has carbs, and most of those carbs are dietary fiber.  I've been making frozen berry smoothies which is like, a cup or so of berries, a half a cup of heavy whipping cream, half a cup of almond milk, and a dash of vanilla.  Very few sugars, lots of dietary fibers, though if you're on a really strict keto then that might be a lot of your carbs for one day :(
---
r/classicwow btw hahaha
---
Some good points there, when I fucked about in vanilla in was a clicker using a bog standard ball mouse. I now have an 8 button one with a much better internet connection (like most). So I'm hoping to be able to up my game, but then again I'm sure so will everyone else.
---
I pick my name last.
---
I'm not much of an RPer, but I still try to use RP suitable names. I also want to make sure that the first syllable is short and easy to say, because that's what everybody is going to call me.
---
The hardest part for me has always been trying to find a name that I don't hate but is still available.
---
That's some real interesting logic you came up with there.
---
It's not like there aren't several private servers still operating today that are larger than Nostalrius was.
---
Responding to your edit.  He may not be rage starved in the long run.  But you are slowing down his initial threat gen by him generating less threat at the start of the fight.  Which of course makes it harder for him to generate the initial threat on the mobs. I wouldn't PW:S unless he's at 50% HP or less.  Still I'd probably not use it at all.  Remember, to a warrior every point of rage is more dps.  You only slow things down by using it even if you are aoe grinding.
---
Deathdealer's helm from the aq40 set.
---
IDK why so many people in the comments here are bashing you. The tank was over-concerned and the people in your guild sound like they were way too far up their own asses about "reputation matters" or whatever.
---
Gross that seems horrible to me. I guess I was just too much of a noob to remember.
---
&gt; 25 man raids vs. 40
---
I've seen so many guilds on private and retail servers disband due to the difficulty of hitting that 40 number.  Going to 25 man was the best decision wow made as far as im concerned.
---
Once tanks get geared they don't need to be def capped anymore unless for some fights like Patch were a crit would one-shot the tank.
---
But he wasn't talking about difficulty. Actually, he even said it's easier to raid than to rank.
---
So he's just complaining for the sake of complaining. You still have to PvE to PvP.
---
Don’t powerword:shield warrior tanks friend :)
---
Actually its better at 60. Because people with the best gear are not getting any stronger, but as you gear up you will close the gap.
---
While leveling you are in one twink bracket for example at lvl 19 and get rekt, then you level up and now you're in another one where you are level 20 and everyone is 29, and you get rekt. 
---
You just constantly keep fighting maxed out people in each bracket but your gear never improves if you adjust for your level. At 60 your gear is constantly improving (dont have to adjust for level as you stay 60)
---
Spoken like a true armchair programmer.
---
I 100% agree with this: The Ryzen 2200G (or upcoming 3200G for $100) is a great choice. Toss in 2x4GB of DDR4 and a 240GB SSD and you're set.
---
What? Did you read what I said?
---
In case it wasn't clear, priority system means higher priority debuffs erase / cannot be erased by lower ones.
---
If MS is lower than whatever othr 16 debuffs you NEED, it will never apply or can be removed by them if it is already there.
---
So no, if its low on priority you would not have 15 debuffs.
---
You gotta tell Phil Harrison he is all over the place saying the opposite.
---
Do elaborate
---
If Shadowmeld works similar to how it does in Modern WoW (it may not), Shadowmeld is a get-out-of-combat free card. It works essentially as a feign death.. You can also use it as a suedo-interrupt in PvP if someone is casting on you.
---
Ok let's say I didn't write power word shield in my text :p I'm really looking to learn how fade exactly work in classic :D
---
I will be rolling prot warrior and I can raid 4 nights a week, more if needed. 
---
I have high Hope's.
---
Not the bottom, but you can drop because of it. It all depends on your tanks and how geared you are as there is a lot of rng with your threat, tanks threat, others passing you on the TPS meter and such. Depending on the flow/time of the fight I would usually spam SB's and once i got close enough that a crit would push me over I would delay a second or so(maybe create a new healthstone if i used it) then go back to spamming. I tried to keep an eye on how much average threat a non-crit and a crit would produce so i could gauge if I was going to pull before my next cast. Remember to factor in projectile travel time to the boss and the update on threat meter as well. Then again, some fights like AQ40 Huhuran(don't do this on Vaelastrasz in BWL), you just keep slinging SB's and pray you don't pull. :) Just my opinion as I am sure others have figured out better how to deal with their threat in raids.
---
Most actually do twinks because it nullifies gear as a factor, since it's so easy to have max BiS at 19.
---
You had me giggle goodjob
---
No, you want to be arms/fury for sure. Your tanking rotation doesn't change a ton by switching to prot.
---
Time lost adjusting your play-style would be much smaller than time lost leveling with no damage.
---
Can I get a shout out to all the skeezy back alley drug dealers peddling illegal bunk dirt weed to kids, because without them we would not have the fine, super-potent, medicinal hydro at all the hundreds of legal dispensaries around the country.
---
Did some ping testing just now, I'm getting like 230ms ping when connected to some server in France where I believe B.net servers are located.
---
Is it noticeable?
---
Only fade when you pull aggro in this situation. If your warrior has 0 threat on the target it won't matter though.  If your using swp to tag a bunch of targets the warrior needs to hit them all to grab aggro. Then when you get a big heal off fade instantly after that.
---
Me me me me me me me me meeeeeeee!
---
For example the difference between a Night Elf warrior and a Human Warrior can be about 10% DPS. It's definitely quite significant. There will be *plenty* of non-elitist people looking for other people like them to play the game and raid and start guilds with.
---
You should let the people who have fun minmaxing do that if they want too. It won't affect you unless you want to directly compete with them which you seem to not care about
---
How do you download beta ? It said “ you can Pre-Download the Game Client” today but I don’t know where to find it . Thanks.
---
As as a fresh account with not enough gold to pay the inflated item prices? er ok then...
---
You're breathtaking! ... but I guess orc peons wouldn't say that ...
---
Damn, I just subbed too but no option in the launcher.
---
&gt; arguably 
---
let's hear some arguments
---
You probably can. You'd have to space out your raids a bit but it's not impossible. 
---
Rank 14 definitely is impossible though.
---
Actually, can I still use my US account to start in their region when Classic launches? Or do I need to start a whole new Blizzard account just for that?
---
I prefer to watch Xaryu realy nice stream, great peronality and great community. If your more in the wecky stuff I recently started watching Payo witch is kinda fun in a totally different way.
---
I don’t know or care about the specific implementation, but layering is a server side thing not a client thing ya wanna be smart ass.
---
Looks like I’m pvp bound!!!
---
Are you using fade before or after you gain threat?
---
Nah he watched his friend play on a private server once.
---
Is 15 dollars going to break your bank?? 
---
I subbed both of my accounts and both of them got stress test invites.
---
Good choice, it’s an amazing time
---
Your US account is for US
---
I’m not judging them because they find it fun. I’m judging because it is unnecessary for 99% of the playerbase but the sheep feel the need to look up guides on the internet to tell them how to play the game instead of making their own choices.
---
Imagine playing fire mage pre-AQ.
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Fade
---
Don't PW:Shield a Warrior ever unless it will absolutely save his life by giving you enough time to heal. You mention that you understand this, but it's still a bad idea. Less Rage for the Warrior means less Threat he can dish out, making your Threat a bigger problem. There's also no real reason why you and your Warrior friend should be pulling multiple mobs on purpose, neither of you is especially good at dealing damage to multiple enemies at once.
---
Fade reduces your threat by a specific number. At maximum rank, that number is 820. Once the buff ends (10 seconds), your next combat action (basically anything) will return the 820 threat to you.
---
I'm surprised no one said "you're breathtaking" yet.
---
Lol, I simply just replied to him at his level. Do you think I care who this guy is and if he will play on my realm? Ofc not lol, why would I?  
---
I'm not attacking anyone, people are just easily offended by my opinions.
---
Hyperbole is a thing my friend.
---
No Leefflet... 2H enhance for leveling?!?! Just play a different class then!! /S
---
I had to leave a little cushion there in case someone does disagree but I’m firmly in the camp of it is the worst.
---
No its a design thing. why do you think they redesigned the game. Specificly for Bnet implementation and so they can use the new technologies like sharding aka layering.
---
You should check out perplexitycya for rogue, tribe_tv1 for warrior and kraunx for mage. All of them great players, does a lot of testing and their interaction with their chat is very good. Answer most questions! =)
---
Do you know the timestamp for that part? I'm not about to watch a 45 minute video. You can still earthbind kite with 1h enh as well, especially so if you don't happen to have a fast 1h at the moment, so even then it should still be faster, or at least better considering the added defense and armor vs the minimal amount of dmg you MIGHT get from from a 2h + RB.
---
It's worth every penny if you get the invite. 
---
Being part of the beta invites are a pretty cool experience.
---
Imagine the guy who killed you takes all your stuff off of your corpse.

Ultima Online

Horde4lyf
---
40 is the breakout point.  It gets way easier once you've got your 31 point talent.
---
I think Mage is superior in gold making though
---
This is a big part of my question should I fade once he's 50% life and heal him like crazy? Will I generate zero treat if my fade buff is up?
---
THat's possible. It's hard to say for certain from just a minute long clip, but he just seemed disingenuous to me. He didn't stop trying to help the FC carry the flag at all, he kept attacking and cc-ing until he died while claiming to want him to drop the flag, so it came off as fake crying to me.
---
**GOOD THINGS:**
---
+ 1: Dual spec
---
+ 2: Better art, zones and quests. (By better I mean more modern)
---
+ 3: Raid mechanics
---
+ 4: Mythic+ stuff (For people that like to push)
---
+ 5: Arenas and other fast PvP modes as a premade with friends.
---
+ 6: Better music overall.
---
+ 7: Expeditions and Battlefront. (For people that enjoy those)
---
I mean its pretty hard to come up with more stuff, let's make a list of bad things aswell.
---
**BAD THINGS:**
---
+ 1: Crappy talent tree. (If you can even call it a tree)
---
+ 2: Crappy Dungeon finder.
---
+ 3: Crappy Raid finder.
---
+ 4: Crappy PvP Rewards and progression.
---
+ 5: Leveling experience is shiet.
---
+ 6: Combat is too streamlined.
---
+ 7: There is no such thing as class fantasy.
---
+ 8: Everyone has the same cooldowns in different forms.
---
+ 9: Artifact and necklace farming or any other such system is utter garbage time gating.
---
+ 10: Professions are not needed anymore, outside of a few gems.
---
+ 11: Daily quests and otherwise just to get you to login.
---
+ 12: Removal of almost all spells, You can barely fill out your bars now, let alone if you're using a custom one with more space.
---
And it goes on and on and on, I can sit all day coming up with why I hate the game after cataclysm.
---
The holy trinity is Vanilla / Crusade / Wrath, anything else after that is utter garbage. (In my opinion)
---
Did you train Decurse Magic and Conjure Water? You're in.
---
Off topic, but does anyone know what ui addons North are using in this clip? Thinking about the cast bar and bars.
---
That's the entire point of the talent system. If you choose to spec for solo play (shadow), you're gonna be gimped in other aspects (PvE/team PvP). Having everything available at the click of a button removes a lot of gameplay since you will never have to play a sub-optimal spec.
---
🦀
---
I'm already resubbing one month early to reserve my names, and that's bad enough . Quit thirsting for every month you can squeeze out, Blizz. If you want my resub that bad, make retail interesting and fun.
---
Someone better have a damned good reason to just stay behind while 3 people head to the instance. I don't want to play with people like that.
---
ahh so you wont be good you are saying
---
Thunder clap does not generate bonus threat.
---
Demo shout and thunderclap are luxury and should only be used once you have cemented threat.
---
It's accurate.  Like you, I got in with no problem, too.  But we're the exception.  Most people had massive waits.
---
:'( 
---
Staaahp
---
I’m at work at the moment but I’ll get one for you later this evening
---
You must be really bad at the game
---
Not totally unviable.  You won’t likely be a main tank, but I off-tanked up to AQ40 clears and Naxx trash.
---
For sure, I live for those instances where it basically becomes controlled chaos with the entire group on the same page. Which is a blast as a dps for sure, but I've just always enjoyed that type of gameplay more in the healer role.
---
If you don't intend to waste your time reading quest text, just download a quest helper addon for classic. It will work the same way as it works right now in retail.
---
Arenas.
---
But they are shitty right now, so... =/
---
I did Deadmines the other day on an 18 hunter and my 6 slot quiver was full (so 1200 arrows).  Got to the end with about 44 arrows left.  I was seriously worried I was going to run out, lol.
---
What makes you l entitled to purchase high end items at a low price as a broke new character?
---
And get geared up and do Dead Mines, which will be a good challenge.
---
This. This is why 1H is worse. Everyone levels 2H+Flametongue, everyone knows this... /Thread.
---
Ehhh...  In five man dungeons, sure.  In raids?  Depends - might not be a problem at all.
---
And I doubt any Warrior **refuses** to tank.  The scenario is more likely that they want to be a DPS Warrior, but are still quite willing to tank when forced to do so.
---
Hmm, could it have been Thunderstrike/Shadowstrike? Also known as Vendorstrike. Not many people wanted it, so makes sense that a Pally would be allowed to have it
---
Just in time for this thread to be dead and irrelevant
---
&gt; Adjust Hunter scaling slightly, so that they aren't awful post AQ
---
Don't even need to change much things, just make a ranged weapon that actually has some T3-like DPS
---
You are a hero &lt;3
---
You will thank me.  I've gotten all of my friends hooked on it, too.  It's the kind of thing that when you bring up, it sounds kinda silly and joking, but I am dead serious -- after 2-3 days of having one glass per night, your next poo and every poo thereafter will be solid, clean, and extremely satisfying.
---
Please indicate how the comment I replied to is NOT an attack.
---
Nope everyone knows you must level as healer if you wanna heal
---
You do understand that there are legitimate isues with layering, right?
---
Is wow really that popular in China (I have no idea seriously)
---
I’m not preventing anyone from doing anything though. I’m expressing my opinion regarding min-maxing.
---
Your combat log shows the spell they are casting when they first start casting it? I only remember it showing in the log once they performed the cast.
---
I will roll protection warrior, I will make a lot of friends and I am so f***ing happy about it :-)
---
Because the respec cost is too high? There are specs available that perform well in many different gameplay situations. 
---
Also, people having to farm gold adds a lot to the world (and there are MANY ways to farm gold).
---
Not to diminish what the Nost team did but damn mate, this is still on the front page, you could have at least waited a few days before doing your karma whore thing ...
---
Never thought I'd ever read the phrase "raised by Powerslaves", but there we have it!
---
I was already in College when I started playing. My WoW friends were often way more present than my IRL friends could be. I've had dear friends who've passed away and we've never met, that's the sort of impact an MMO can have. It definitely can shape and change you.
---
they are referring to the "fair fight" in terms of once you're on the battlefield, one player has way more gear so the fight is no longer an even match of pure skill.
---
In that regard, every fight in the history of WoW has been "unfair"
---
If you can grab the current character level from a variable, maybe the message could read, "Time spent at level curLevel - 1:  ".  
---
It may draw other people with customizable options such as hiding the interface completely (is this in memoria), or panels that open up before the screen shot is taken, like, displaying your quest log, displaying your character sheet, displaying your skill screen, pet skills, or honor screen.  I could see that being a problem to some players while turning in a quest that it closes their quest turn in screen.
---
&gt; A person that is enjoyable and moderately competent will get the chance to raid, maybe not get priority
---
A warm body will almost always be better than noone in a raid slot, but contested loot will absolutely be going to the people who are going to make best use out of it in my guild. If you show up, aren't an asshole, and can at least moderately play the game, you will get geared out.
---
Any joker can get at least one T3 piece because Anub is like BWL difficulty. 
---
But most people won't even get to 60. Of those who actually get all the way to 60 I think a fair amount of them will at least see Naxxramas and take down Anub.
---
I agree with almost everything you say, but....
---
Expeditions freaking sucks. I just damn hate them, but thats my opinion and I accept thoose who like islands aswell :)
---
And even in the places where it's well above minimum wage, it's still not near enough not to struggle. Source: I make $11/hr in a $7.25 minimum wage area.
---
It'll affect world firsts and server firsts for phase one. Not sure if you consider that "lasting," but i certainly do.
---
Not sure why you get downvoted. It's true.
---
But I don't think it will hurt the number of people on launch day. It may hurt streamers, as followers have already seen them playing enough. And to be honest, watching someone play WoW for days, weeks, is boring, imo.
---
As for the beta, it is not supposed to build hype or make fun, finding new metas. It is supposed to find bugs, and fix them, for a better experience after go-live.
---
Dun mat, hunters can use mail at 40
---
Damn, I got not time to request off and you're getting a raise for more than I make yearly.

The point isn't to go and build a new system using old parts, it's to give a point of reference for people using older computers currently. I think.

Haha yes, but Hunters still use leather beyond 40. It’s all about the stats.
---
Yeah I meant let them play how they want without shitting on them for being no lifers who don't care about fun or whatever you seem to think. Obviously you don't have the power to prevent someone from doing something
---
Okay, then it's a problem you would choose to make:)
---
Always Duo anytime you can. Pretty simple. As a good solo class, it just means you'll both power through together even faster.
---
Humm
---
Let's say I'm at 200 treat on the mob and I pull aggro. I fade while the buff is on me can I cast anything without generating treat? I'm sorry I'm still not 100% sure to get it

My friend and I are only playing to level. Endgame content isn’t what we’re looking forward to. Just the journey.
---
idk what addons you think you can make, but a lot of what can be done is already done. 
---
Classic is in a weird inbetween spot where it has access to most of the current api but blizz disabled some of the addons such as getdetailedthreatsituation this returns the percent of threat a player has. This is why there currently isnt omen cuz the vanilla counter part is get threatsituation which returns 1-4 4 being you are tanking and 3 being you might take threat.

Shamans had to hold all 4 of their totems and a stack of ankhs. Plus a healing set.

But sure that text totally doesn't exist. This is a waste of my time.
---
yeah no shit it would be easier to make modern changes on modern software. See the comment of the “fuckin retard” you originally replied to who said that. Was your whole comment about layering on an old client? Dunno why you wanna be an ass about the smallest insignificant shit when you have no idea how it’s programmed.
---
Must have been I saw that one before you mentioned it but it don't remember the look, probably because I never used it.
---
My guild was straight dkp with no restrictions , but we would all let warriors loot good 2h swords first just out of politeness.  I remember being close up to get an ashkandi from nef! But I never ended up getting one.
---
Really stoked for classic!
---
Not quite. It overrides the artificial 1% hit penalty, and also grants 2% hit chance on top of that.
---
I mean I reported it- pointing out its bad that there's an invincibility bug isn't crying to attention..
---
I was mostly mad the priest held on to the flag while he was bugged which means they can never get it back- he eventually dropped it though.
---
Repost in r/freefolk for free karma
---
This is how fade works in classic (a little different than on retail). In classic, fade just slightly lowers your total accumulated aggro temporarily. You also keep generating more aggro by healing during the fade duration. So lets say before you fade, you had 100 aggro accumulated from casting aggro generating spells (healing). Casting fade will temporarily lower your aggro from 100 to like 60 or something (i dont know the exact amount). If you cast a heal while the fade buff is on you, you will still generate the exact same amount of aggro from that spell. If your healing spell generates 10 aggro, then it will still generate 10 aggro while faded. So your aggro will increase from 60 to 70 while faded. Once fade ends, your total aggro will go from 70 to 110 if all you did was fade, cast a heal that generate 10 aggro, and nothing else.
---
Here is what i'd do. I'd cast shield on the warrior before combat starts (it wont generate any aggro). Then i'd let the warrior charge in, and i'd wait as long as possible to do anything that generates aggro while the warrior generates as much aggro on each mob as quickly as possible. Eventually you will need to start healing, but the better the warrior is able to generate aggro on as many mobs as possible before you have to start healing, the better off you will be. Potentially, if you have a super skilled warrior, you wont even have to fade. Fade should only be used in an emergency to get a mob off you. It's a temporary fix, and does nothing but temporarily lower your total aggro. All the aggro you generated during combat before you cast fade, and all the aggro you generated during fade will all be there on you once fade ends until combat ends.
---
Yeah it was terrible. I would have a group of body's saved up for my brother who played a paladin at the time 90% exp recovered for a rez lol.
---
How would you rate the PvP options compared to more PvP-centric MMOs?
---
I don’t remember the crocs in the stream between Durotar and Barrens clipping in and out like Chronalis dragon here.
---
I'll always prefer leveling with someone, don't care if it's considered the best solo class ever seen. MMO's are meant to be played with people and will make things easier, being able to do tougher quests, mobs.
---
Radical
---
there is only 1 server and its RP-PVP
---
I wonder if there is a PTR with open access to 60 and BIS gear so that a group of people could go and show everyone that you don't "need" optimized groups to clear this content -\_-
---
To be onest, the version of me who played Vanilla was noob as fuck. And still cleared most of that.
---
I'd say to him "learn to play, scrub".
---
Idk. For me its the memories from wrath (never played classic) so im going lock main hunter gold alt.
---
Thanks. I thought it was as easy as switching location from the Blizzard launcher.
---
&gt;Layering would be possible even if they used the older version of the game and it's not in the game because it's possible
---
Following lines is hard?  I reply to that comment. Can you guys look into the future or something? Everyone is saying the game will be dead after 3-10 weeks so WE NEED LAYERING TO SAVE THE SERVERS.
---
The cycle of vanilla is longer then 3-12 weeks btw.
---
Wow!! This is exactly the answer I was looking for ty so much kind sir!!
---
WoW programming is actually a really great way to get into programming! I'm going to give you one piece of advice: DO NOT START BIG. Trying to realize your full vision will be frustrating and a mess. 
---
Start with the basics, learn how to get a frame to appear with text in it. Then make it grab your character's name and fill that in. continue to increment towards what you want to do. There's a reason every programmer starts with a Hello World! program first, you have to crawl before you can figure out how to run.
---
Too late for that
---
Fade only when you have pulled threat off of him.
---
&gt; ~150,000
---
lol if you think there will only be 150k
---
&gt; Again, you keep stating opinions as facts.
---
Oh the irony.
---
&gt; You are putting words into an entire playerbases mouth.
---
Not entire, just majority.
---
&gt; I find myself immediately hit with Nostalgia as I remember my daily treks across Ironforge Bridge into the Auction house as some low level scrub as i pass those godly players who stuck with their class and were decked out in epic looking raid armour. The level of admiration / jealousy looking at that sick looking main tank.... Time to roll a warrior! But wait, that hunters bow looks sick... no no a Hunter, ill be a hunter.  
---
&gt;Decision made, the levelling begins (again). Deep in the depths of STVietman, I watch in awe as a warlock gets ganked by 3 evil hordies, the gankers being feared into mobs, a void sacrifice, a healthstone popped, 2 die but its not enough, the warlock falls, but wait hes back up, soul-stone popped. The 3rd dies....that was sooo cool...This is a sign....the gods want me to be a Warlock.  
---
&gt;Its a long trek to Scarlet Monastery, but my little warlock legs carried me the whole way and i summoned the remaining party members. Its a tough run as were all under levelled, under geared and have no clue what were doing. But this priest.... unfazed he kept us all up and carried the group hard, this was the first time i thought healing looked fun. But healers are lame he can't kill anything i thought to myself... armoury done, time to head to the cathedral. A horde group attacks us as we leave, its a quick, fun and messy fight but we die, except the priest... who strolled out after us and appeared to solo 4 of them (admittedly on low hp) and then had an epic 1v1 with the last guy.... why i am wasting time with this warlock... priests are so much cooler.
---
Oh man... you just described me both then and what I'm doing with youtube/streamers right now trying to pick a single class ahead of time.  
---
What stops me from maining X class?  Seeing what Y can do that X can't.  Grass is always greener.
---
https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Attack-table
---
&gt;Are you against people getting "compelled" to get BIS gear to top the meters aswell?
---
Sure, if getting BIS requires unhealthy gameplay then I'm all for removing the mechanic.  One example that comes to mind was when raiders would endlessly farming Maw of Souls for artifact power back at Legion's launch.  The devs implemented a number of changes to discourage the behavior.
---
The “Sell Junk” addon is great in classic. Does just what you want.
---
Where is the PSP version ????? xD
---
There’s not much to discuss when the entire sub is just an echo chamber
---
I think you should stick to RP servers.
---
OH MY! 
---
No but really thank you. I'm new to WoW and only dabbled in it during BC. Druids seems so unique due to its diversity role.
---
Party of two LFM.
---
WoW classic is the sandbox we wanted, but you don't get to tell people how to play in it.
---
Cool ty vm!
---
I would say no. Simply ecause with the way that vanilla is set up, every spec is not "viable". If you increased the debuff limit and did a little work to balance oout the specs.... yeah maybe I could get behind that. But #nochanges is a thing... so?
---
Had to have high high hopes for some tankin'
---
&gt;Imagine getting to enjoy the lore again.
---
Yes, imagine enjoying "lore" in a game that literally contradicts itself as soon as the character creation screen.
---
By that logic all English words are either Latin or Proto-Germanic.

I played arenas with a dude in tbc and found out towards the end that he lived 20 blocks away.  Never met him irl his name was woodblock and he was a hunter.
---
which thing?
---
Yeah I spent a lot of time messing around with classes.  Definitely helped to narrow down what I want to main.
---
What are the differences between early iterations of AV and the 1.12 version they gave us? I remember they changed it a few times thru-out vanilla but I honestly forget since it's been so long.
---
Didn't they move the starting spawn or something for the horde or why does nobody kill the 2 faction Bosses near the middle of the map anymore?
---
Dude nobody asked you anything.
---
Lol. 
---
Pandas were in the game years and years before king fu panda.
---
Open world bosses might cause issues on low end systems, but this is very promising results for pretty efficient game motor it seems. Good job on blizzard too and hats off for quality beta work.
---
I mean old school runescape went mobile and most liked it because you can do grinds passively. Collect rescources, fish, check the auction house and do flips. It's a joke but people would love it.
---
In all seriousness, I'm in a world 1000 retail guild and most of my guildies have no interest in classic or plan on playing it very casually alongside retail raiding. This will not be the case (of course a lot of people switch though at least for a few months)
---
&gt; The only people who will level as holy priest/paladin will be people who have no idea what they're doing.
---
Hey PvP does exist. Just saying.
---
This, a thousand times. Also, don’t shield a warrior unless it is an emergency. That, a thousand times more ;)
---
That would be better, I agree but how exactly do you think it would cost more??
---
Having 3 layers with 3k people on each requires the exact same amount of server capacity as 3 different realms with 3k people each.
---
I've seen people arguing this same bullshit without understanding how modern server infrastructure works.
---
Isn't it a good thing for players since it would make respec, repairs,  etc essentially cheaper?
---
I do accept that. Like I've said, people can play what they want and if they have success with that, then good for them. But the thing is, this Summit guy said that you can get in any raid with any spec, and thats just outright wrong. I think there's a limit to how casual you can be. Not everyone wants you in their raid if you play and arms warrior or some other meme spec and not all content can be cleared with a raid that has arms warrior and other meme specs in it. And thats what i'm debating in this thread.
---
But fire weapon damage is based on weapon speed.. 2 procs at 50 each is the same as 1 proc of 100, given the same amount of time. Obviously If fire weapon was a flat amount 1h would be way better. 
---
Apparently you want either a slow 2h with rockbiter or a fast 1h with WF, according to some studies that were done, check out the channel Defcamp &amp; Melderon, the guy is a scientist by profession and his tests/results are very detailed and well formulated.
---
Maybe. But the Teldrassil Darkshore Ashenvale and Stonetalon + Duskwood questing routes are actually fairly efficient. If you're on a pvp realm you admittedly probably can't do stonetalon without a large efficiency drop, similar to STV.
---
At least compared to my standard leveling efficiency, it's a negligible drop in speed.
---
This bug has been present in the beta for several weeks now- I get that it's a beta and it has issues, but given the recent trend of Blizzard entertainment not fixing bugs that are extensively reported in a beta, I think its worth pointing them out and not just accepting that "oh its a beta there will be bugs."
---
It might not make me popular to say this, but if the beta continues at this rate of bug fixing a lot of broken shit will make it into the beta- to name a few that aren't class specific: [layering](https://www.twitch.tv/aylegaming/clip/MoistSoftGullWholeWheat?filter=clips&amp;range=all&amp;sort=time), [batching](https://www.twitch.tv/aylegaming/clip/LitigiousFrigidOrcaRalpherZ?filter=clips&amp;range=all&amp;sort=time), [melee ranges](https://www.twitch.tv/perplexitycya/clip/OptimisticSmilingFungusBudBlast?filter=clips&amp;range=7d&amp;sort=time).
---
Maybe it'll come off the wrong way, but I think it's the responsibility of the beta testers to stir up buzz around these bugs to make sure Blizzard doesn't repeat the mistakes they made from BFA beta to launch.
---
Sorry but I actually enjoyed the lore till Warlords of Dreanor and I also enjoy the lore right now. Not playing retail anymore but I always watch the lore vids and read the books. To be honest, WoW Classic has like no lore at all. It's not hard to not mess up something when it's not existing.
---
&gt;Ysera still alive and not nonsensically killed by people they just made up for an expansion.
---
Ysera is corrupted by Xavius and the emerald nightmare and mercy killed by Tyrande. Im not sure how this isnt true to the lore of these characters... 
---
Of all the stupid deaths you choose one that would actually fit in classic.
---
I might be a moron but please help... how to do I get to classic. There is no "REGION/ACCOUNT" option on my wow screen. I have this button on starcraft, hearthstone, diablo etc but on wow it only has the play button and no drop down menu for region or classic. How do I get this option to show up? I have game time.
---
WoW teached me that the Internet can be a fun place. It lead me to forums, porn and influenced my music taste.
---
Fk em all and go with Holy DPS, or a dagger tanking build based on Seal of light.
---
&gt;First of all. Not everyone can be amazing. You may be, I may be, but to expect it of every tank is honestly super fucking shitty. 
---
I don't expect anyone to do more than the bare minimum, after all there's plenty of room for new players in dungeons and you'll be fine in the vast majority of cases even if the tank doesn't know their stuff.
---
&gt;Second. Not having control can be stressful, you might feel like you're failing, or you might get told off by DPS/healers who think you are. 
---
This notion that only tanks have control of the run is why you might perceive it as stressful. No one should be "telling you off" in standard dungeons at all, and I don't see how this has anything to do with the above discussion either.
---
&gt; We need tanks, and burning them out instead of being patient with them just because they don't confirm to your idea of "the vanilla experience" is... well at this point you either get it or you don't.
---
Why would they burn out? I advocate a non-rigid way of playing that allows for a variety of play-styles, instead of forcing everyone to fall into the pattern of tank and healer having to carry the rest of the party. Feel free to tank and spank everything you want, just don't be surprised when other players do it differently.
---
In truth, non-tanks can easily carry the dungeon run, there's no need to put the tanks on a pedestal and put so much pressure on them. Might help prevent "burnout" to just  think of them as just another cog in the machine instead of putting pressure on them.

Behold the triple-tree, two-handed """tank""" Holydin. Holy damage from Consecration, holy damage from Retribution and even more holy damage from Shadow of Chernobyl.
---
Apparently rockbiter is the best echant to use for this style of play.
---
was this nerfed in TBC or by 1.12? Basically will classic have this?
---
Right on! This brings back memories lol. That’s a long, rough road to gank.
---
Damn, that would be a 5-5 matchup for sure
---
I've been on countdown to classic a few times actually! I'd really recommend Josh and his content, dude puts on a great show :)
---
&gt; Imagine powerful lore characters like Ysera still alive and not nonsensically killed by people they just made up for an expansion.   
---
&gt; Imagine lore that's consistent where they don't make up random children for Grom Hellscream to have because they need a Big Bad for an xpac or two. 
---
arent we getting 40 people to kill c'thun, hakkar, onyxia, nefarion, kel'thuzad, and drek'thar and forgot his names alliance dwarf, powerful lore characters?
---
This is correct
---
My 2009 PC runs retail pretty well (not in big cities xD) and classic i guess will run better. Specs: AMD Athlon II x4 620, 4GB RAM, GeForce GT 240, gigabyte motherboard (don't remember the exact model now) and 500gb storage (and windows 7 of course).
---
I disagree. The best FC spec for druid is 8/11/31
---
But HotW spec is still damn good.
---
Wand was usually my go to, but there is still a ~1.8 second cast time when you activate it if you get the lvl 13 enchanting wand.
---
Pull with a mind control then mind blast another mob and cast fear when they all reach you hopefully attracting further adds. Throw some dots and start rubbing for the exit casting PW:S and renew on yourself, then fade. Use a speed boost potion to hurry the f out of there. 
---
Then when in safety spam the hunter for doing a terrible pet pull.
---
It can’t be used in combat in classic
---
Faction?
---
Its one of the better combos. Consentration while the pala is tanking you can just aoe over that.
---
Exactly, release in roughly 60 days and game breaking bugs not fixed. At a certain point they have to finalize their release version for launch and if critical bugs are not fixed the launch could be a disaster.
---
People shouting "It's beta don't worry!!" are going to look more and more stupid if July tests go as poorly as they have been going so far.
---
&gt;didn't lag
---
found the guy who didn't play on peak hours
---
I played Vanilla and TBC on my EU account, then moved to Canada so been playing on US servers from WotLK onwards, so cant really get my original chars back :(
---
Healing guide 
---
missing a little hp - use flash of light
---
missing decent amount of hp - use holy light
---
repeat.
---
It does scale but the dps comes out to nearly the same but also has the benefit of having more defense and relies less on big crits and isn't hurt as much from missing.
---
Which is why I'm leveling my Warrior alt with my brother who is doing a priest alt. I'm looking forward to the instant group forming we'll have as well as the smooth leveling and ability to do all the group quests easily.
---
My main is going to be a Warlock, though.
---
He does have gouge and all of his energy to unload on you. A twink rogue will take down a hunter real quick once he gets in range.
---
Really dig all the lore you put in!
---
If we annoy Blizz enough with forum posts maybe they'll bump up the release date. Or at least just do an open beta to keep us busy.
---
We’re just talking to each other anyway. No one is really going this deep in a thread.
---
I will have fun with my frost mage 💀
---
Yea but sl is on another level of balance. For duels at least.
---
Ooooh. That makes sense. I thought you could use it defensive stance. Thunderclap is trash then.

Sorry to hear man :/. Fresh start for us all when Classic drops!

Why aren't you working?

Shit maybe I am retarded cause i have no idea what you’re trying to say. Thought we were talking about the new client version not justifying layering, if you read the rest of the words in that comment there’s plenty of other reasons why Blizzard could want that.

Anyway no reason the client needs to care what layer its on. Again don’t care how its actually programmed.

Are you levelling solo or as a group/duo? If you are leveling solo I would go something like https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxuoxZZibhtbfV

I'm leveling whit a warrior friend and my current thoughts on spec is https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxubgkxZeb0zb
---
Same here taking ret talents first. As a duo whit a warrior you spend a significant amount of time healing and the resistance to spell pushback is amazing.
---
There's a PvE guide linked on this page and if a PvP guide is written it'll be linked here as well. The PvE guide is a good starter guide but doesn't go into a ton of details.

---
Except warriors are the best DPS for the majority of classic wow, so you’re wrong.
---
Yeah I meant dungeons primarily.
---
&gt;Imagine powerful lore characters like Ysera still alive and not nonsensically killed by people they just made up for an expansion. 
---
Xavius wasn't "made up for an expansion", he was a recurring major villain, the heart of the corruption of the Emerald Dream, who had locked away Malfurion for years (until he miraculously escaped from his clutches in a god damn book so that he could show up for the Cataclysm expansion out of the blue... great job on that one Blizzard). 
---
&gt;Imagine lore that's consistent where they don't make up random children for Grom Hellscream to have because they need a Big Bad for an xpac or two. 
---
Garrosh is easily the best original character in WoW and I'd argue he is up there with the likes of the WC3 OGs. He's such an interesting character, it's really everything surrounding him that sucks content-wise. The idea of a Warlord's son, promised a wondrous destiny, left to run the Horde in its darkest hour, and then condemned by all his closest allies for the decisions he made to protect and preserve the Horde is compelling. Ultimately he made the decision that many real leaders often fall to - when he was pushed to his breaking point, he reacted by attempting to silence his critics/enemies. He sought the power to enforce his vision of the Horde and in the process alienated almost all but his most loyal followers. 
---
His story ending by being murdered by Thrall in violation of the rules of Mak'gora is a fitting end to the character - the deck was stacked against him, he was told to play by the rules, and in the end he paid with his life because he was only knew the glory of the old ways.
---
How is it an attack? Like unless this dude really wants to play with me on the same realm (which he clearly wont), how can any of what I said be considered an attack? I didn't insult him or threaten him in any way. I really don't know what you are on about. If anything, that guy is attacking me.
---
&gt;his name was woodblock and he was a hunter
---
i love it when people name their characters like this
---
My job has a lot of downtime. Why does it matter?
---
I'm happy your reported it and I apologize if it wasn't your intent to cry for attention. My comment about your guild still stands though and I would never associate with them.
---
He was playing but he was playing (being carried) with rank 1 players, braindeadly was a hunter that helped him, I don't remember the other guy's
---
The page for the X1 only mentions GPU flops, not CPU. The page for the Cortex A57 make no mention of flops. The wikipedia page for "Playstation 3 technical specifications" is wrong, it's 230.4 gflops for total system power, not CPU power. Follow the link the information is sourced from, it's this: 
---
https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/power/library/pa-cellperf/
---
It says Cell Broadband Engine (the actual CPU) has peak double precision performance of 21 gflops, which is pretty damn close to what I calculated earlier. The same section says that that's compared to 230.4 peak gflops when including the VMX (a more precise term for the PS3's GPU), which means it's not 230.4 gflops for the CPU, that's for the total system power, which is what I fucking said.
---
This is a great example of why you should check the sources of Wikipedia articles rather than just taking them at face value.
---
Didnt hear about that shit hole server until I joined this sub after classic was announced so nah fuck those guys.
---
Seal of the crusader. Auto attack.
---
I have been looking around as well. Haven’t found much of anything. For being the best pvp healing class it’s weird not finding anything.  Let me know if you do &lt;3
---
I hope they don’t do any expansions
---
This was patched in 1.10 and will **not** be in classic.
---
Druids can farm anything, including soloing melee elites with Roots. The lashers in DM are done by opening the fight with hurricane, popping a Rejuv, then getting into Dire Bear and finish them off by Swipe spam.
---
Feral Druid FTW
---
We don't really know what the priority on MS is and there is a good chance it's going to be knocking off debuffs that matter. 
---
You also have to consider that there's going to be a million fury warriors trying to get in the raid.
---
I love it!
---
And you do? It's common sense - if it costs exactly the same then what the fuck is the point of having it? With their latest news revolving their greed, this correlation as to why they've went this route makes perfect sense.
---
Good players no matter the spec or class always get invited as long as they put in effort and are likable.
---
That would be sharding.
---
"Hey Patrick what am I?" 
---
"Uhhh, stupid?"
---
"No! I'm Texas!"
---
"What's the difference?"
---
All versions of WoW have always supported both:   
---
 - Full Screen   
---
 - Windowed Full Screen   
---
Including vanilla, including classic, and including retail. You just have it misconfigured. I myself prefer Windowed Full Screen since multi-monitor.
---
Here's another one.  
---
https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/pve-holy-paladin/
---
Sounds like a good fit for me! Just turned 30 this year. Im looking to play a warrior and more than willing to tank if needed. Most of my vanilla experience is in PvP but very willing to learn raiding mechanics.
---
Dinged 120 in retail.  66k HP.  People in BGs with over 200k HP.  Please tell me more about how unfair twinking is...
---
&gt; While leveling, going Fury is better for tanking.
---
IDK man, Tactical Mastery and Anger Management are pretty legit as well.
---
I think the important thing for tanking while leveling is simply awareness.  Mark targets, pull intelligently, watch your healers mana.  If you can do those things, spec matters a lot less.
---
BFA, cata, and Warlords had the worst lore
---
Legion wrath, and BC were the best
---
Loktar ogar
---
Go watch another Gillette commercial and have some hot chocolate with marshmallows you ninny.
---
I know right? I know the general idea because I played it a lot from Wrath on. Just want to know what people did in Vanilla.
---
Did they say it was an open stress test or invites again?
---

Warrior: I lift things up and put them down
---
Everyone else: we know buddy, good job :D
---
Only top dps , tanks , and healers get hearthstones. Between warlocks that’s maybe a few hearthstones a Raid. I also refuse to summon people unless they have a good reason to be late or are main tank. Feels good man

Monkeynews is my favorite warrior to watch.
---
I’m duoing with my buddy, he’s a warrior.
---
No. You could always have played in the region if you had the right product code. I had a trial EU account for a while in TBC to play with a college friend who lived in Germany but I couldn't deal with the lag.
---
Given the private server culture of "finish Naxx and start a new one", Nostalrius likely would've been long replaced by a newer server at this point had they not gotten the C&amp;D.
---
Speaking of masturbation, this image post is pretty masturbatory.
---
I don't do it for the karma, I do it for you guys. ♥
---
It was one or the other. I went with conjure water because keeping your homies hydrated is important.
---
Not only lore characters, we fight a lot of "random children" of Deathwing, we fight a made-up Firelord, we fight a made-up Old God., we fight a made-up Blood Good. Tons of shit in Vanilla is pulled out of one's ass. It's definitely a weird complaint from OP. BC/WOTLK were much better at balancing old and new lore (Ulduar in WOTLK for instance).
---
Aww, I was hoping for a real reply.  Come on!  Sell me on the merits of world buffs!
---
* For the most part I enjoy the flow of combat and the new animations + sound effects. I like that I have a filler skill, slam, which doesn't do \*too\* much animation wise (at least on my human). I'm not doing flips or spins every 1.5 seconds when I'm smashing it to burn rage. That leaves the longer CD skills to be a bit flashier, and feel punchier. Escalating to a spinning swing for mortal strike, to leaping in the air for Colossus Smash. On my old warrior I was pretty much spinning and leaping for every attack, or spinning a lot if I was tanking (which always felt weird). 
---
* Although I on one hand dislike the loss of community, I recognize that my community (server) was already fading on it's own. So I was kinda happy that I could at least find people to play the game with as cross-server features came in. A big problem I had with cross-server LFD/LFG at the end of WotLK was that it was putting the cart before the horse. It was throwing me into a dungeon with cross-server people, before I'd even have an option to friend them or contact them in-game without rolling an alt on their server. A more complete cross-server social feature-set at least tries to fulfill the idea that you can extend your own personal community beyond a single server, which is not what I'm looking for in Classic, but is not necessarily bad all together. 
---
* I've more or less enjoyed every new expansion experience. Rushing to the new area, doing new quests, seeing everyone in the world exploring, always a good time. It's just some expansions have lost me in the middle/end experiences. I even enjoyed the process of building my Garrison, and hanging out in it was cool. It was just the "maintenance" part that sucked.
---
You can always spot a good warrior by how they use battle shout, and by how they don't use thunderclap.
---
Love those animations, both male and female. Absolutely amazing
---
yea all those reasons are bullshit. they CAN hardcap servers at 5K and have like 50 servers at launch. Layering breaks the game in many ways. nothign justifies it.
---
How is the gear from heroics 'irrelevant' if you can't do m0 without it? Sure on the right weeks you can get some higher pieces from the weekly quest, or get upgrades from LFR (which is about as hard as a heroic dungeon) But aside from waiting around for the right WQ reward you aren't completely bypassing heroics. And if you're waiting around for the right WQ heroic gear certainly isn't becoming irrelevant in a day.
---
I love how the really strong racials may/may not do anything in your eyes but the super easy to counter racial (shadowmeld) has "endless possibilities"
---
Stoneform, fear ward, and desperate prayer are extremely likely to save your life. Much more than a stationary stealth
---
When you raid as a holy paladin your build will be different depending on the spec of other paladins raid only need one kings for example and one need to spec might and so on you will have to talk whit your guild mates normally it is https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxubgkx
---
Followed whit prot or ret depending on what buffs/auras you are supposed to use in raids
---
*N*
---
*I*
---
*C*
---
*E*
---
Yeah classic is kinda full of effects that temporarily effect threat rather than directly reducing it. Another thing you might run into is your warrior friend's mocking blow. Mocking blow is not taunt, all it does is make the mob focus the warrior for the duration of the effect. Everybody keeps generating threat like normal, so if you're still on top of threat at the end of the mocking blow effect, then the mobs are back on you.
---
So similar to fade, the point of the skill isn't to solve your agro problem, it's to buy time for the tank to build up some threat so hopefully by the end of the fade, you are no longer on top.
---
Also, make sure you're standing back out of melee range. If you're in melee range of a mob, you need 110% of the tanks threat to pull agro. However if you're at distance, you can go up to 130% tank threat before you pull.
---
is that actually faster/cheaper than cloth donating?
---
Combat rez, innervate priest. That's raiding as a Druid.
---
Leveling is fun, so is healing/tanking/DPSing 5 and 10 mans. But raiding sucks. Your Healing Touch, though very mana efficient, doesn't come out quick enough relative to shammys, priests, and pallys. HoTs don't stack.
---
Also you're wearing a moose hat and your shoulders are twigs.
---
The question is, how many clients you can run simultaneously?
---
Farts
---
Not quite right.
---
If you have 100 threat at level 1 to level 19, you'll temporarily have 45 threat when you fade and all your spells will generate their normal amount of threat.
---
If you have 100 threat at level 20 to level 29, the next 55 threat you generate will be temporarily ignored, anything beyond that will generate its normal amount of threat.
---
If you have 100 threat at level 30 to level 39, the next 185 threat you generate will be temporarily ignored, anything beyond that will generate its normal amount of threat.
---
If you have 100 threat at level 40 to 49, the next 320 threat you generate will be temporarily ignored, anything beyond that will generate its normal amount of threat.
---
If you have 100 threat at level 50 to 59, the next 520 threat you generate will be temporarily ignored, anything beyond that will generate its normal amount of threat.
---
If you have 100 threat at level 60, the next 720 threat you generate will be temporarily ignored, anything beyond that will generate its normal amount of threat.
---
And you should never shield a Warrior unless it will save his life.
---
After playing pally you'll love rogue. You'll go from providing buffs every 5-15 minutes to providing buffs every never ever ever. From being responsible for others to being responsible only for yourself.
---
Lol was actually a Dwarf Warrior.
---
It could be server specific, that said i did level on two different pvp servers and found the experience fairly consistent.
---
It also depends on how you define "good pvp"
---
It would be cheaper, but not faster, and I am clueless whether cloth donations are a thing at release in Classic; they weren't in private servers.
---
Locks are bae. Their lore is the best (no one trusts them, even in their own factions), their DPS by end end game is prob near the top of only slightly below mages, but additionally, they are the best 1v1 duelers, and they have so much group utility... gahh so good. Why am I rolling Druid? So hard to decide between these two.
---
its a weird complaint, but very popular, always has been
---
I would buy these as a patch!
---
These are awesome man. Well done!
---
think there are few EU streamers but it seems they are  in minority... but honestly, I'd roll on streamers server, for sure there will be enough ppl to do stuff + the community wont die out that fast
---
&gt;HOW WELL DOES A 9900K AND GTX 2080 RUN I NEED TO KNOW IF I NEED TO UPGRADE PLZ GO BUY THEM AND TEST PLZ PLZ THX
---
ERMAHGAED SOUNDS LIKE YOU NEED URGENT UPRGRADA ASAP LOLZ!?11ONEONE
---
and all 100 are fury
---
Also dodge passive so you prolly wont die as much to begin with
---
in Mexico the min is 4 USdls a day  ;) . thats why gold in classic will be worth more than pesos
---
"if they hadn't shut it down, they could have never re-released it"
---
How profound...
---
How do you pronounce your toons name?
---
To be fair, it was only introduced in the last major patch iirc.
---
I love reddit because there's people like you that do research like this out of a combination of being curious, and tired of hearing the same questions over and over.   
---
Thank you man!   
---
Sadly this confirms my suspicion that I have NO excuse what-so-ever to upgrade my PC to the new Ryzen line, since Classic will probably be the only game I play for the next few years. oh well.. money saved I guess.
---
One of the major problems with flying is that it makes it too easy to avoid combat. Since you can't fight while flying, there can't be flying encounters, and other players can't gank you.
---
If mounted combat were a thing, and flying combat was a proper part of the game, and there were places to explore that were built around flying (like a vertical column of floating islands, or something), then it could be an immersive part of the game. It might need different controls to feel right - some mounts should control like helicopters and some should control like planes but right now they all control like you're swimming in the air.
---
You will get lots of quest loot along the way, and the increase in mob kill rate from having 2 instead of 1 will outweigh if each of you have a few crappy pieces of gear
---
what new raid?
---
Blind runs can be so good for the soul sometimes. Love it.
---
Jokes on her, I think about both.
---
For me it's Monkey News' apes montage which contains some of if not the craziest world PvP action ever captured. https://youtu.be/YjG4UpuL84M?t=75 
---
Some of this shit is pure mayhem and has made me decide that I want to join a PvP guild come launch.
---
My man. Lok'tar ogar
---
They really capitalized well, I’m a vanilla-tbc-wotlk returner and I feel they been true as ever to the lore
---
Hahaha, tell 'em.
---
Yeah i mean this one is open too so it's 100% , I don't think $15 would break the bank but I don't like spending it for like 24 hours of play time, when it could be going towards classic sub time. I'm torn!
---
Add no hit chance talents outside of affliction spells.
---
i don't have a legit "full screen" option in BFA, only full screen (windowed). you can probably force it through CLI though?
---
If any of the quests you want to know about start at 40 I can check the beta for you
---
Good thing I have tons of time from 1-60 to learn stance dancing as a warrior tank.
---
Is this with or without silent resolve?
---
ONE ARMY ONE PURPOSE
---
But...you can do this using a virtual bootcamp that mirrors specific parts. For free. Someone did this at the start of beta.
---
And here's me thinking I was wasting my money by upgrading my CPU and graphics card for classic. That BRM clip was fucking insane and there's no way my PC will survive an encounter like that.
---
My only gripe is that the factions are on the opposite side to how they "should" be, e.g. character screen. 
---
Great stuff though.
---
elemental shaman 1000% 
---
a) They naturally spec 21 points into resto
---
b) They are way way stronger healers just by default
---
c) You can raid heal even as ele
---
and most importantly D)
---
They are actually good in pvp, boomkin kinda blows, but elemental is amazing
---
I should also mention that I love healing but want to be able to take out the ol’ 2-H and beat face
---
&gt;I'm just pointing out that there are more ways than one of playing the game instead of pigeonholing everyone into boring and ineffective narrow roles.
---
Which is exactly what I was doing from the get-go.
---
If the tank wants the run to be done a certain way, then that should be respected.   
---
Not respecting that is pigeonholing the tank.
---
Here's what it comes down to. If the DPS wants to go off-script there's a very easy way to solve that: ask/tell the group you want to nuke a mob and to not worry about threat when they do.   
---
The bad thing is in the situation that started this entire thread: when the DPS just does fuck-all because they don't give a fuck about their group.  
---
Pulling aggro on mob groups IS the tanks responsibility and privilege to delegate, if the group wants to deviate from that, *say so*, don't just do it.
---
You came into this thread with the entirely wing context.
---
As for what I want to do and hope I want to tank. I won't be tanking. I'm rolling a shaman. It's what I played in classic and I can't imagine anything more fun than shaman healing/support.   
---
Incidentally, that kind of healer playstyle is unmatched in when it comes to off-script scenarios like not giving a fuck about aggro etc. 
---
Thing is, I know what the reality of classic dungeons are from the passive healer role as well as the trening role.   
---
Your utopian idea of dungeon running just isn't realistic. People are different, and your "just be chill and take everything in stride" makes so many 5-mans crash and burn.
---
YOURS won't, but GENERALLY.
---
how does this work?
---
Oh, we had plenty of those in Vanilla first time around. It was apparent when our first Rag kill was with 26 people in the raid.
---
$15 for 24 hours of game time when I don't even like paying 64$ for a hardcopy that lasts for years it has nothing to do with being too rich, if you look I even say I have the $15 already on my battle.net lol idk how people like you deduce this has anything to do with the $15 ... It could be 5$, 30$ 1$ I'd still debate spending the money because it's a 24 hour window of gametime that will 100% have queue times, server restarts etc.... 
---
That's like saying "well if you don't wanna pay $12 for a movie ticket to see the preview of the movie, it may be too rich for your blood"
---
Well, no....
---
So you think if they used the original 1.12 it would be impossible to put layering in the game? 
---
They managed to change the modern client to work with the 13 year old data but you think they couldn't put something like layering in the game, which isn't even a client side thing?
---
If we're gonna use the unstable, unsecure and unoptimized 13 year old client why not use 13 year old servers too? How about that? Run every realm on an individual server that are so unstable that they have to give out free days to players because the servers are down all the time?   
---
Then the servers would crash all the time, especially at the AQ gate opening event, I guess nobody wants to see it anyway. Why use their modern servers that has been proven to run the game a million times better on the stress tests.
---
Lets go all authentic, old outdated client old outdated servers and everyone who isn't playing on a potato banned.
---
Herbing while on the shitter? Making arrows in the car? If you DONT want this you don’t know the pain classic brings.
---
Got it. That means if I want to play on the EU server, I actually need to purchase the right product code from that region. Thanks.
---
Then it becomes your professions. Then what alt to have. What professions it should have. Which one will be pvp  or pve or both. Wait do I like this character more? Now I am stuck at stage 1 again.
---
I’m not trying to prove anything. It’s already fact, everyone knows and agrees that WoW is an rpg except for you...it’s an rpg dude. End of argument. You’re ignorant and trying hard as shit to be edgy “oooh it’s not an rpg cause of dumb reason 1-2-3” get that shit out of here, you’re not cool, you’re just an annoying prick and I’m sure you are exactly the same in real life and people can’t stand being around you cause you always gotta try to correct them with some weird personal opinion you made up one day while staring at yourself in the mirror. Get over yourself. WoW is an MMORPG, grab that fact, swallow it whole, and move on cause your argument sucks dick here buddy.
---
Maybe because that was *four fucking years ago* and you are totally clueless?
---
Would rather do this than hardcore min maxing autists. Ideally a happy medium, though 🙃
---
It isn't, I've only ever played 100+.
---
Is it open? My friends account didnt get an invite but I'm going to let him use my second account.
---
You are blatantly incorrect. It is to deal with overcrowding, whether that is a daily area, a city, or a starting zone. Nobody wants to wait in line to smack peons or gather cactus fruit. You also don't want to lag so hard your grandmother can feel it from beyond the grave. 
---
It's also not 'three servers in one'. It's one server that's segmented. You specifically do this to avoid paying for the three servers, and only pay for one. If the population decreases you just decrement the number of shards and distribute new entries to even them out. Same concept applies to incrementing the shards when your population shifts up.
---
I read on here that cloth donations will be in the game at launch
---
and they definitely were a thing on private servers, my gnome mage on [redacted] has a ram
---
(reposting comment to remove pserver name)
---
Nice try at another karma grab. Linking to an image too, so it actually accrues.
---
Point is who give a shit about some dickheads who ran an illegal server?
---
I have no real frame of reference for this comparison, the only MMO I've played besides WoW is Runescape in the early 2000's and PVP there was pretty simple. I did dabble in Maplestory, but not enough to remember if it even had PVP. I personally consider Looter Shooters like Destiny to be MMOs and have played it extensively, but the PVP there is so different from WoW, I'm not sure how I would begin to compare them.
---
I would argue that Retail WoW has much better PVP than Classic in every way except one, which is random world PVP. It has many more Battlegrounds, all with diverse playstyles, a lot of open-world PVP scenarios, and Arena, which is really the only type of competitive WoW PVP that anyone pays attention to.
---
In my experience you might have problems healing deadmines as pala just because you have no int gear. Pro tip there is a cheap 5 int cloth belt in lochmodan excavation site. After that you can easily heal as any healing class in any spec until level 60 just keep a updated int set and you are golden. And bring extra water I normally bring 60+ water to any instance when healing.
---
That's what I was going to point out. In-game, it's Alliance on the right, Horde on the left. Other than that, it's pretty cool.
---
Depends on if your nightfalling as a Ret-Support, in some cases other classes are better though a Dwarf with Edgemasters is pretty damn good with it but gloves are a main slot come AQ for Ret gear for mana gain on hit.
---
My 2950X Threadripper and 1080 Ti can likely run more than I'd ever be able to micro, anyway.
---
I think that's part of it but you also have to consider they didn't add in new world buffs you could use in raids in TBC.  Capturing the towers in Hellfire Peninsula didn't boost your damage in the Magtheridon raid.  Turning in Magtheridon's head didn't give you a 2 hours buff you could use to trounce Serpentshrine Cavern.
---
I raided as both rogue and holy priest in vanilla and imo healing was much more dynamic and fulfilling than spamming an attack rotation. You actually had to improve, predict, and react - and you were necessary. Plus finding groups for anything is a breeze.
---
I am torn between Hunter, which I played in vanilla, and Priest, which I started playing when I came back at Wrath launch and have played ever since.
---
I will probably try to level both, if I can find the time.
---
Guild banks
---
Having the option means respeccing a lot though?
---
Will people actually let you stay in ele spec for raid healing?  Every time I read a post it seems like its resto shaman only in raiding for classic.  Would love to raid but being I have no interest in the handful of dps classes or going full healer I just gave up on that dream.
---
it'll show up around 5-6pm EST
---
...Is it?
---
Well the theory is that increase damage to target from blocks etc by the Warrior will generate more threat due to the Ret-Support Presence augmenting the other dps to do more damage as well as providing 2 weaker dps but decent off healers due to spellpower stacking.
---
I don't know if I'll be the one, but I really want to at least be on of the 5.
---
Who knows whether I'll end up raiding, but I definitely want to spend a lot of time tanking 5 mans.
---
I thought it was mage or hunter with a slight chance of druid in the morning?
---
Oh yeah, the struggle is real- it’s really reminded me of my Vanilla experience though. I’m stuck between going the pure nostalgia route and playing as a hunter like I initially rolled bakc in the day, or going with something new like a warlock or a rogue.
---
I don’t believe paladins can use daggers.
---
Brilliant way to put it, "over-concerned" great wording. When I say, "it doesn't matter" that's what I mean. It's of no "REAL" concern.
---
typical hunters being in the top kills, but i was amazed to see it wasn't alliance dominated as i thought it was going to be. horde won most of the time. it was fun to mess around with different specs
---
A geared Prot Paladin in Teir 2 can easily speedrun any of the 5-10 mans. Speedrun meaning finishing pretty quickly. Still have to stop for your healers mana and tanks mana lol
---
No one will argue that Blizzard has good design philosophy.
---
I'd like to be the one to teach you that 'taught' would have been grammatically correct there.
---
Transmog would be very bad in vanilla/classic. But in BfA where at the gear looks ridiculous, it's nice to transmog back into Vanilla/TBC gear.
---
_Nice_
---
Because people are just passing through while leveling and want to play some BGs which is ruined by twinking. Level 60 it is expected to have gear differences.
---
That's a sexy ass orc
---
Both. Silent Resolve doesn't change the ceiling for Fade, just reduces the amount of threat your spells generate.
---
With Silent Resolve, you can do 2050 points of straight healing and you'll generate 820 threat, which is the ceiling on level 60 Fade.
---
Without Silent Resolve, you can do 1640 points of straight healing and you'll generate 820 threat, which is the ceiling on level 60 Fade.
---
Can you link that? I'd be curious to see how they used software to emulate specific GPUs.
---
They can’t do it as fast as any of the others, this lie needs to stop before we get too many disappointed wannabe tanks.
---
It’s warrior or it’s Druid
---
You'd want Tier 2. A good shield and a strong main hand. With that setup you can easily tank 5-10 man's.
---
That's your limit though.
---
This post makes me feel personally attacked... personally *auto* attacked.
---
I have always played paladin and been main tank and been horde
---
I decided main tank is what i actually enoy so i am to be human warrior. Also taking engineering and alchemy and I've never done those
---
The i suggest the second build. And as a side note it is probably better to funnel gear while leveling to the warrior he will always be doing damage while you will spend time healing and drinking water
---
i'd rather watch a stinky pile of dog poop sit on a dxracer chair in front of a keyboard with classic wow stuck at the title screen than watch a second of esfand. that guy is such a douchebag. i don't know why he has more than 1 person watching him
---
Blood and Thunder!
---
And now we end up dying to boars.... so fitting
---
Careful, how little you know about this subject is showing. Calling Nost dickheads is like calling a paramedic *"fucking pig"* at a firefighter's convention.
---
Truth, I’ll keep that bookmarked. Thanks for the help man.
---
Just FYI for fellow laptop users.  I’ve been playing on a razer blade stealth with on an intel HD 620 GPU on certain servers.. and it has been running very smoothly.  Also played a free trial toon on retail and ran with no issues either.
---
Important to fix, but he needs to fix his attitude. He's privileged enough to be invited to the beta, a server with the purpose of testing the game and finding bugs, and then he's complaining about bugs. Is it really hard to fathom that a beta has bugs? Like seriously, get a grip.
---
&gt; Edit : "the next x treat. Will be ignored"
---
&gt; Only while the fade buff is up I'm guessing?
---
Yes, that's why I said "temporarily". The first combat action you take (any spell, any consumable, etc) after Fade ends will throw all the threat Fade was masking back onto the mob's threat table.
---
Fan girl harder.
---
The issues come when the shaman that does no damage wants damage gear. Yea sure you bring some unique utility that a resto could also bring. But you dont need gear for that utility. And you will not do much better dmg if you are given the gear you want so why give it to yu?
---
Woof!
---
Thanks man! 
---
This was just a test fitting so I might swap them around for the final version. 
---
I will still have them on corresponding sides as per orb of deception though ;)
---
Thanks again!
---
What's the third playstyle?
---
"~~Level 60~~ WoW is expected to have gear differences."
---
In Vanilla before I landed my guild I was a Solo player and Tanked 5 man's for days.
---
Made a good name for myself on my server and before I knew it I was getting msgs from guilds "Hey man, one of our tanks didn't show up, you want a spot? X item is on reserve but you can roll on Y and Z"
---
Few raids like that and then I found my home.
---
Love this quote.  Thanks for sharing.
---
Can you elaborate on why? Just curious as I never thought 20% dr and 3% damage was that game breaking. IIRC I remember people killing the pet as a primary strategy against SL anyways and warriors/rogues/mages can do that quite easily.
---
Helps you quest fast. Not sure if better that joanna
---
Yes u cant read or what? I told u a couple times already.
---
 Man it shows u have no idea how computers work do you? Every server used to be run on a server blade with limited harware capabilities. They then migrated the data of the old servers into their new sever infrastructure and sold off the old server blades for charity.  
---
If they did not integrate battle.net and all that bullshit they could easy just run a 1.12 server on their infra and it would not unstable or unoptimised because its a stand-alone game and not linked to retail. Do you even know what it means for software to be unstable or unoptimised or what causes server lag?
---
Damn that's right. Still would work with a healing sword, or a fast one.
---
I'm pretty novice at PvP in Live, and only ran a few bgs way back in Classic, so forgive me if I'm naive about the topic!
---
I don't think it's available to download yet is it?
---
I mean, you're entitled to you own incorrect opinion =P
---
I remember our guild being stalled in Naxx, members stopped logging in on raid nights etc.  So I ended up spending an outlandish amount of time in AV.  
---
Being a combat rogue in mostly full tier 2 and some AQ weapons/gear added in, I felt like a God in that place.  
---
Unless you went up against people who were in t2+, almost nothing could stop you if you played smart.  
---
I know I wont have the time to get back to the gear set up I had back then, so I'll never feel the same feeling again.  It's nice to reminisce.
---
Oof. I didn't even think of that. After Giantstalker, they all kinda suck, huh? Purple dragon bits, and brown spiderman. (Not counting AQ set because those are all garbage.)
---
WORK IS DA POOP
---
I mean from what I recall if you were even OT you could tank as arms through BWL. I enjoyed pvp back in vanilla and OT through ZG as arms. Was never really a big issue. Now AQ 40 I dont think would be so forgiving
---
Yep, it's so awful I had to race change to orc
---
10 out of 25 warriors will not be a raid MT. Maybe 2 or 3, of which maybe .2 will get a thunderfury.
---
It's not about 3-4 encounters. it's that stoneform and fear ward both hard counter certain classes/pve mechanics and desperate prayer is a free save yourself heal. 
---
Night elf gets to hide, to deal arcane damage if somehow shadow and Holy get kicked, and run back from the dead faster?
---
To be honest, you could raid heal in MC or Ony as an ele/resto spec, as long as you have +healing gear. The fights are not long enough to cause you serious mana issues. Just make sure you have mana food, mana oil on weaps, mana elixirs / flasks / pots and you’ll be fine.
---
Where you will run into problems will be BWL or AQ40. 
---
But if by then you’ve gotten yourself into a good guild and you show up to raids on time, and with all the right specs, then they may still take you. 
---
There is easily room for a couple hybrid classes/specs in raids, and good guilds with good players won’t have an issue with it.
---
Only the hardcore min/maxing guilds will tell you how to spec/play.
---
Warlock. I'm a warlock. I will always be a warlock.
---
The internet would implode with pure rage if they included LFR in Classic.
---
This would be great. I'm away during the launch week and my Switch will be my permanent companion there.
---
Chain healing and totems ftw
---
More like just warrior tbh
---
If you've never played on a "good" connection, you don't really have any right to compare or judge the difference.    
---
Just because pain is all you've ever known doesn't mean that not being in constant pain is just as good as not being in pain.
---
Whoa easy there! Hand of Reckoning isn't in vanilla.
---
&gt; Calm down. I just don't think that this scenario that you gave, really exists. 
---
I'm extremely calm, thank you though.  And the fact that you don't think this scenario exists is absolutely hysterical to me.  It either shows you have either A)Never play vanilla B) Haven't been playing that long in the first place or C) Just been in serious mode guilds the whole time you have played. 
---
This is literally every casual guild in vanilla right here, this scenario happens every single day.
---
&gt;refuse to play a proper pve spec, then are you even raiding at that point?
---
I honest to god feel sorry for you, if this is the way you look at video games.  You are straight up treating them like a job and this is really reflective of just how video games play into your life honestly.
---
&gt;but if you except to do BWL, AQ and especially Naxx, you have to at least play some proper pve specs.
---
You know a lot of guilds back in the day had things like bookins and enhance shamans in their raids when downing these things right?  I hate to break this to you sweetheart, but the raids themselves aren't actually that difficult or require an insane number of dps to actually complete.  
---
&gt;Like I've said, the todays standards is a lot higher than back in the day.
---
It most certainly is not LOL.  It may be for YOU if YOU choose to act like that, but most players are not going to.  How come players back in the day had no issue clearing these things on their terrible computers, slower internet, raiding with bookins enhance shamans and pom pyro mages, were able to clear it just fine... but for some reason today holds higher standards as if it got any more difficult LOL.
---
Honestly dude you're just memeing at this point you don't ACTUALLY know what you're talking about.  Summit's video was literally directed at people like you, you don't know anything.
---
No sorry thats just wrong.
---
 In higher raid tiers progression threat is your #1 priority. 
---
Your DPS at that point start to far exceed the TPS your tanks can put out and in a lot of high end guilds the DPS have to hold back. This is why Troll tanks are used by the high end Horde raiding guilds for progression, they have better TPS.
---
This is also why you started getting people theory crafting on fury tanks. Because even high end guilds were hitting enrage timers due to their DPS having to hold back so as not to pull threat.
---
That's a rookie move.  Just train the first rank of conjure water.  It's super cheap and people can always just drink more of it!
---
Yes, China has about the same amount of players as US and EU combined.
---
Cloth donations are the de-facto rep grind in Vanilla, since that herb quest went down to 5 rep per turn-in at L60.
---
Okay, well that’s good to know! Thank you.
---
How do i respec? I ended up putting to many points into depression and alcoholism.
---
I have always played horde an stick with it. But, i never played druid in any state, so i‘m rolling one, if have no idea on the quests in mulgore either 😂
---
Mastering a new class is fun! Can‘t wait t shapeshift it like a stance dance
---
The whole "don't expect a raid spot/loot" is a private server rule.  Straight up Pserver goggles.  
---
Real vanilla with a more spread playerbase means more casual guilds will exist and many will not want to be with the tryhard guilds.  Tryhard guilds will have drama and fighting, who exactly needs that to be a part of their classic experience?
---
Velkommen til WoW Classic Norge!
---
Et fellesskap for alle som skal spille Classic! Vi begynner å nærme oss 1 000 medlemmer og vi vokser for hver dag.
---
Hensikten med discorden er å ha en felles hub for alle norske spillere, og samles på en server ved launch. Her kan vi bli kjent med nye spillere, finne folk å spille med, få en oversikt over norske guilds og snakke om alt relatert til WoW Classic.
---
Tre enkle regler:
---
1. Snakk norsk
---
2. Hold det WoW Classic-relatert
---
3. God tone i chat
---
Her er linken til discord serveren: [https://discord.gg/GJdHa4N](https://discord.gg/GJdHa4N)  
---
Del gjerne linken med venner og bekjente :)
---
What race/class are you planning
---
You must not live in the working to middle class USA.  If you don't work minimum 40 hours a week here, you aren't paying rent.  I make $17 an hour and that puts me upper working class. I have to let my mother and brother in law rent out rooms in my house, else Id lose it. I live in a VERY affordable area comparatively.
---
It’s. The suggestions/recommendations are obviously not mandatory but most likely what will be meta.  As always, if you don’t mind not being accepted to cutting edge guilds, play what you want to play. Of course there’s fun to be had as any spec, with the right people.
---
Druids have better dungeon times with the right gear and group setup, raid is another thing
---
&gt;Side note: I'd love to test in AV, but Blizzard hosted AV on Father's Day weekend and I'm a good boi and was visiting family so RIP most of my time to test last weekend.
---
Yup. Also, I logged in during the brief moment I had a second and saw that the shaman didn't have a 2h for enhancement and logged right out.
---
&gt;Classic is only ~5 GB currently, so you aren’t going to be hurting on space.
---
Just out of curiosity, does the classic beta not use any shared assets from the _retail_ folder?
---
I'd say even if you only manage to get crit once a fight, it's still worth *considering* for raiding :)
---
I don't see how op pets with abilities, additional hp and mana 'pots', and the ability to summon people is not rewarding, especially considering that you can just farm shards while grinding rep or gold anyway, just press drain soul at the end, no big deal. Also curses don't overthrow your main abilities, they are an addition. You still use a lot of skills in every fight.
---
Even if you do all the NE quests at the appropriate levels, you’ll still be over 15k reputation short (less for Humans). That means over 300 stacks of Runecloth for exalted.
---
This was the ticket response, their second “please note” stated they freed the names, but it was originally ‘Bhelliom’- the numbers must have been from the restoration process?
---
Hello ,
---
We don't delete characters, so they are still there. I only had to find your old account ********** and add it to your list of games:
---
https://account.blizzard.com/games 
---
I had to upgrade it to Legion so you can buy game time from here:
---
https://shop.battle.net/product/world-of-warcraft-game-time 
---
Please note:
---
- your new wow account "starter" is separate from that old account
---
- the old characters are still there but with the names freed, so you will need to set the names again when you log in
---
- you can login to the old account with the account selector (over the Play button) 
---
We made a lot of changes, you will see. Check this guide: 
---
http://worldofwarcraft.com/game/returning-players-guide 
---
If you are planning to play Classic, it doesn't matter which account you use, because the old characters will not be available in the Classic servers. If you add game time for Classic, you can also level up that shaman from 60 to 110 and see all the new content.
---
Great duo, as both can share professions. Both take skinning, and one take LWing and you can craft gear for both as u level. Take a gathering spec and sell the mats and you should both have good gold too.
---
it is going to chug in AV and raids from spell effects and models, and it will be worse if you don't use low settings for them.  there is an option in there to lower your settings for raids and BGs.  Otherwise it runs fine for the other open world and dungeon content.
---
They will be Tanks. You know raids have a MT and an offtank or two...sometimes 3.
---
YOUR PREMADE LEADER IS A DUMB WHORE WITH A FAT ARSE, DID YOU KNOW THAT?
---
That really does hurt its usefulness after level 40 especially if  you don't spec imp GW. In retail, I use GW as my indoors mount and outdoors use actual mount. The only usefulness it has is it's usability in combat and lower cast time than mount.
---
They are. You forgot that Soul Link is the most OP PvP spec in game.
---
There will also be Zygor and Dugi guides coming out. So lots to chose from.
---
I am not aware if Joanna has an in game addon to guide you or just alt tabbed to a web page? That is the only thing I could see as different.
---
Can we all vote to get Bobby B bot in this sub reddit? I’m so serious too
---
the post is about enhancement losing weaponskill after respeccing you absolute sperg
---
Bobby B would be more of a hand of rag type of guy
---
Fade reduces your thread by a flat amount. Then after it's up you get the threat back.
---
i never used it until i got aggro.
---
I am wanting to roll a Warrior, but my goal is to be a tank for dungeons as I will not have time to raid. Pretty much how I played back in vanilla. Luckily for me the dungeons were so well crafted that it was entirely possible to make that my end game. Who knows, if a guild likes my tanking maybe one day I'll tank a raid.
---
We need him added! NEED
---
We do not kneel.
---
Ah might be that, i tried this on my work computer and that bitch is out of sync like a motherfucker :D i will try at home now
---
Damn lol
---
Thanks, I appreciate the reply.
---
Now that I have legit adult responsibilities, I don’t expect to be ready for progression raids and it may take me a couple months to level.
---
I plan on rolling resto Druid.  My main enjoyment is PvP, but I know I need to raid for gear.
---
WoW running on Stadia or Nvidia platform doesn't know what processes are running on your system and thus can't detect for cheating and bot software that for example automates the game based on what is visible to the character.
---
Cliff notes? Why?
---
"north shows" it's been well documented by multiple people before he whined about it.
---
Truly the greatest nation on Earth eh?
---
You die a lot faster and you kill people a lot fast.
---
Heavy gear dependence and many matchups are very much rock, paper, scissors.
---
Not to say the adrenaline rush from outplaying someone in an unfavorable matchup doesn’t feel fucking amazing.
---
No shit, but you made a blanket statement about weapon skill in PvP that was OBJECTIVELY wrong. Instead of name calling and down voting frivolously move the fuck on.
---
Highlight similarities as well as differences.   
---
It amazes me how, after 15 years, people still join Warsong and run to the middle of the map to pointlessly attack the other players who are also ignoring the objectives. Warsong is supposed to be a 10v10. Instead, it's almost always been a 3v3, with the remaining \~14 players not materially participating.
---
I'd hazard that 90% of players never made it past MC. I'm not even sure the majority of players were 60 when TBC came out.
---
Depends on your guild, but I'm sure some guild will allow a proper prebis geared shaman to stay ele and raid heal with it. You actually don't lose that much and raids don't have the highest requirements for healers in at least mc and BWL. 
---
If not then well that's 1 less reason to play elemental, but there's still plenty.
---
nice guide, looks like you spent a decent amount of time putting it together
---
Every realm and everything is ran on the same server infrastructure that allocates resources where it's needed, Classic will run from their perspective the exact same way as it runs modern WoW. 
---
When you log in to modern wow and see different realms, they are not ran on completely different servers obviously. Same thing will be the case with classic, the only difference is that in Classic the players from different realms won't be able to interact with the exception of battlegrounds.
---
This is a very very good thing. Modern servers are far superior to the old ones. Blizzard used to give out free game time all the time because servers were down. 
---
When the AQ gate opening happened, the servers couldn't handle it, on every single server.
---
The modern server infrastructure will easily handle that. 
---
My point is, running a layer or running a completely different realm on the modern server is the exact same thing, the only difference is wether the game allows interaction between them or not.
---
Sure Activision does greedy shit all the time, but this has nothing to do with that.
---
&gt; Pulling aggro on mob groups IS the tanks responsibility and privilege to delegate, if the group wants to deviate from that, say so, don't just do it.
---
We disagree on this core concept. I'll be fine with DPS in my groups pulling whatever they want as long as they have the tools to handle it. 
---
If you want to have some rigid tank-focused run feel free to communicate that before the run, just don't expect other players to automatically be on the same page. Because waiting for the tank is not always the optimal play, so other players will deviate from your script if they don't see an issue with it.
---
well - it was Blizzard that took down the game from Nvidia service and even banned some players for using it.
---
Yes they can. Once your party is in T2 the 5-10 man's become a joke. Paladins natively without engineering, oil of immolation etc will deal more damage to groups than Warrior and Druid.
---
Warrior and Druid will hands down be better tanks overall, but in just specific terms of AoE potential in large groups with the right gear and healer, Paladins shine slighty more.
---
That all being said. I'd take a Warrior or Druid over them because though they may be a few seconds slower they are going to survive better and have better single target threat for bosses.
---
I have only tried AAP for a little bit back when BFA launched. I prefer Zygor and plan to use NO guide coming launch of classic. . 
---
BUT you install the addon and it walks you to the most optimal path to level. . \* As optimal as the particular leveling guide author thinks.
---
It was a simplified statement because the exceptions are completely beside the point. And I didn't downvote I don't care about karma.
---
He will make an add on eventually. What guide does yours follow? I haven't a clue who makes the best. I've tried your program earlier and whilst I love automatic quest buttons the rest seemed to get out of sync frequently. Getting me lost and missing quests that it asks me to let later. Maybe I did something wrong, probably is that as many others like your work. Just was bad for me
---
Stack int and holy nova lashers, or herbing
---
Man our guild hit a real roadblock on Lucifron progression. Up until that we were slaughtering the trash.
---
You can drop it and relearn it.
---
agreed
---
I just went with u/HorrorFruit's suggestion and turned unchecked the "use subreddit style" box. That does seem to have the unfortunate consequence of nixing the custom style on *every* sub I visit, but being as I spend most of my time here anyway...
---
Tanks dont need any gear from strat live but alot of other classes do. So there is a need for tanks in strat groups and passing an orb is one way to incentivize them to run it.
---
Alliance locks can chain-spam a little more bc of Blessing of Salvation, but another thing not mentioned is that Warlocks are the caster class least likely to go OOM, so even though a Mage might outburst you for a min, on long fights like Rag, for example, you can top the charts above the mages because they died from their low HP, or don’t have Life Tap so that you’re nearly always casting, which they have to evocate and wand.
---
/r/outoftheloop
---
So your incorrect statement excludes you from objective facts. That makes a lot of sense buddy.
---
Thats actually a pretty neat idea. As the 'mancave' can use some decoration, I might do this with other unused game cd's aswell.
---
You sound like the anti-vaxxers that go "I never took permanent damage from polio/measles, why vaccinate at all?"
---
Just take improved charge and go prot. The extra rage makes killing a lot easier. The wifey can go Boomkin to AOE shit.
---
There are no new raids.
---
Stupid meme
---
You have to trust people.
---
All you’re doing is convincing some poor guy that people want to support their stupid idea.
---
Warrior or Druid, nothing more
---
If you're melee a lot of your damage comes from timing your skills inbetween your auto swings.
---
I'm not sure if that's as stressed upon in retail with so many skills and GCDs being used.
---
They don't, unfortunately. It's level 46+.
---
The question is, what hardware do I need to run it in 5120 x 1440
---
The true wow classic experience, keyboard turning and clicking abilities
---
Not to mention how 10man raids drove class design towards insane homogenization since you know longer could count on having every class in the raid like you could even with 25 and 9 classes.
---
It was common knowledge in the twink community, not to be that guy. Holding the flag while smashing the opposing teams GY and not going for the cap just to farm HK's was considered dirty play. 
---
Doing stuff like that would either get you kicked from a legit twink guild or you would never even get a chance to join in the first place. Reputation mattered in those days...
---
No resilence
---
No arenas
---
No rated BGs
---
No way to grind honor as currency, only rank matters
---
There're BG-specific reputations
---
No time limit on WSG, flag carriers aren't shown
---
No reinforcements on AV
---
AB requires more resources to win
---
wPvP is *completely* different: no flying, consumables and world buffs, large-scale wPvP happens more often, small-scale fair wPvP happens more often, ganking gap is often smaller because leveling is slower (making it easier to call friends and re-gank, or even to kill the one who thought he's a ganker in certain cases)
---
I've played since classic.  I've always been horde.  I have always hated gnomes.
---
Gnome warrior inc.
---
Almost be better off double mage but mage Prot pally works.
---
I love it.
---
Group of Hunters under the guild &lt;Gang Bang&gt;.
---
Your guild will not last very long if your raid leaders decide to do this...
---
I did 1-20 on my 3 classes I’m deciding on, then spent a few days in instant 60 bgs on all of them and I feel like it didn’t narrow it down at all for me.
---
oh the good old days, my most epic twink was a lvl 60 paladin in WOTLK, Outlad socked gear with wotlk gems, Wotlk eng and LW; it was what got me into 60 everything die when they add exp to BGs but then with the friends i made at the 60s braket, people with no expansions, we form a guild to raid MC-BWL-AQ40, once we clear all we move to TBC and then back to WOTLK, i made so many good memories and thats what got me into classic
---
It's been possible since [patch 1.10](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.10.0):
---
&gt; Players that unlearn Engineering or Leatherworking may now respecialize if they decide to relearn the professions.
---
You have to:
---
1. Drop the profession completely.
---
2. Take it up again and get to 225 skill.
---
3. Talk to Narain Soothfancy in Tanaris and pay her (100g for LW, 150g for Eng).
---
4. Read the book next to her, *Soothsaying for Dummies* and pick a new specialization (or your old one).
---
You go quest in the ne starting area at lvl 1.  Do all darkshore, ashenvale, feralas.  Possible to be exalted by 40 if you solely quest in NE areas.
---
You get almost zero rep for going back and doing low level quests, have to do them at right level to get the maximum amount.
---
Sorry I dont blindly love ppl who profited off someone else's work.
---
If it's too insane I'll just find a grind spot and not quest.
---
That is because def cap doesnt remove crushing blows lol it removes crit.
---
Warriors remove crushing blows by pressing shield block. You dont know what you are talking about.
---
Raids have basically been really good forever. It's like the only thing in retail that almost never disappoint. The only time it does is when they screw up the tuning, like emerald nightmare too easy or at the moment crucible of storms that was so hard nobody attempted it till it was nerfed.
---
Go get a wife :-P
---
Screenshot it, post on the forums. People care if they think their loot will be swiped if they join a raid with a bunch of ninjas.
---
With no xrealm dungeons people will probably act alot better
---
Late Stage capitalism, We've meddled in the free market enough to break it, regulated enough to stop competition,  and let the wealthiest population buy laws to keep them gaining while repressing the masses.  That said, I've been to the 3rd world, and would take this busted ass place over that any day.  Mud hutts with 10 kids sharing mats for sleeping, double amputees begging for food with a dirty mcdonalds cup in thier mouth. ect
---
he's a streamer. streamers don't report bugs
---
A lot of what you bring to the table are in the form of totems, so it may still be beneficial to have you even if you are not full resto, especially if you aren’t going for world firsts or anything
---
You don't have to see it lmao, "rewarding" in that context is highly subjective. 
---
Seems to be a common misconception among Reddit, but Reddit's approval isn't needed for the opinion to be valid.
---
This is the only thing ive found so far, the buff when you respawn in BG's that allows you to buff without a mana cost for a small period of time
---
Both lock and druid have a 30 minute resurrect.  Both lock and druid have mana bars.  Both are some of the most underrepresented or played classes.  Only the warlock class is one you would want to bring a third, fourth or fifth copy of a player to the raid night.  Only rogue's compete with druids for leather gear.
---
Interesting that you used Iron Maiden's Powerslave image for your post.  For the first 3 expand I used to listen to it during BGs and Arenas especially Losfer Words.  It's such a high energy album for playing to.
---
Druid and Hunter only is totally right though. Just because dwarf racials aren't that good for hunters
---
None of the fake cast bars is going to work on people as the wide spread use of cast bar addons will nullify the benefits.
---
Not to mention that a heartstone only misleads people who play without sound as they have a very clear audio indication over regular nature spells
---
Not to yuck another dudes yum but yuck.
---
I only tested by running around in Elwynn and Stormwind, but I was able to get about 40-50FPS average playing “Classic” settings @1080p on the 2012 Mac Mini hooked up to my TV. For reference, that thing has a laptop class Core i7 and HD4000 integrated graphics.
---
You probably wouldn’t want to raid on it or queue into AV with it, but it’d be more than decent for running around questing with a wireless KB and mouse, especially if capped at 30FPS to smooth out the FPS spikes.
---
The problem that OP is discussing is that if they are using a loot council, they would be fucking naive to actually give the loot to a PUG player they may not raid with in the future over their guildmate, so there is little incentive to PUG unless Classic WoW has parses/etc that show how good you are at raids. (I know private servers have parses/logs too.)
---
If someone ninjas you, yeah it's clear and people will shit on them in chat. If a RL of a pug group does you dirty, no one will give a shit (And itll be hard to prove a dirty deed was done with loot council.) No guild is gonna do /roll for loot in a PUG group.
---
Just wondering, what does it distract you from in WoW
---
Affliction is DoT attrition, Destro is big nukes (disgustingly Big sometimes), and Demonology is like being a PvP tank a la Soul Link.
---
Oh, thank you for the info! Guess the comment was wrong then.
---
No, people are just over the top in their egos because they've exclusively played vanilla private servers for the past 4-5 years and think they know best and force this narrative that you MUST play this class. It's annoying and that portion of this community really kinda kill my hype for classic.
---
We can only sign the forum post and hope.
---
Bad not. No one needed to know this.
---
Another dumb post
---
we have a more relaxed raid 2 on weekends that will raid in 2-3 months instead of 4-6 weeks if you can achieve that.
---
I built my current PC several years ago and I seem to be able to play retail with fairly decent FPS. 
---
Every now and then I do witness some screen tearing that quickly goes away. 
---
A few times I got some horrible graphical glitches that forced a system restart. 
---
Should I expect to be able to play classic on this rig? I don't remember all of the specs but I do know the graphics card was an older version whenever I bought it. GTX680Ti. I really don't feel like upgrading it but I will if I absolutely have to.
---
GRIZZLY has a bad rep and it did a lot in the past to deserve that rep- but the guild has undergone a lot of changes and imo those are a problem of the past.
---
Only way we're gonna change the mind of people who know the old grizz is by not being afraid to associate with the new one
---
True pre raid bis for dps warr.
---
My biggest gripe with wrath mechanically was that the talent system break down which started in TBC was pretty much complete in Wrath. In vanilla, you had roughly 31/20 point talent divisions, which means even though you were specialized, you only had 50% invested in your primary tree than in your main tree. And then in vanilla you had a variety of 21/21/x style builds as well.
---
TBC put such powerful skills at the top of each tree that you pretty much had to go 41, so now, with rare exception (fuck you SL/SL locks) you were looking at 41/20 splits, or 100% more in your primary tree than second.
---
Then comes Wrath which just really goes all in on the power of top-tier talents, so you're specced 51/20, 150% more in your primary tree.
---
At this point you really stopped feeling like you were playing a class and felt like you were playing a spec. Cate's spec system was just being honest about what had already happened in TBC.
---
Personally I prefer vanilla's stronger class identity to WotLKs very strong spec identity.
---
Do what? Play somewhere between casual and no-lifing it? That seems absurd.
---
Yes some of the numbers are off but the private server data is close enough that it should be fine. Also even if they get hit more they have larger hit point pools so they have more time to be healed which is fine for a off tank or if they main tank a boss they are a better fit for you just add a extra healer.
---
With a better understanding of itemization and the right gear for bear tanking they should be fine there was almost no change to bear talents in to BC where they where they were fine.
---
Give this a read if if you're interested in druid tanking [Taladril’s Treatise on Druid Tanking in Vanilla] (https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/).  
---
Will druids be main tanks not really but they can make amazing off tanks and for the rare fight a good main tank.
---
You wont have many mounts tho, there is not that many to get and everyone wants them, different race mounts require exhalted reputation with those races and there was no tabard to grind rep, u donated cloth and stuff :D Seeing a guy with a different mount than what he was supposed to have was actually a "holy shit" moment :D
---
Tbh, I’m a girl, and I’m struggling to choose what class to play 😂😂
---
One thing we used to do was get a whitelist of people, not in our guild, that show up frequently. If you were there consistently you were more than eligible for loot, because you were helping clear content. This way you get raiders to show up and not have to worry about them just getting lost and bailing. You may want to find or start a group that does something similar.
---
Now just take your face, and roll it around your keyboard and you'll win any PvP.
---
earthshock does higher damage and also has more %crit (%crit to nature spells talent / gear ( e.g. t2-5piece)
---
I'd rather the "ladder" you speak of function like.
---
When Naxx is on farm, a TBC server opens up and you can either progress into outland, or stay on the classic server.
---
Then TBC progresses into Wrath and you can again chose to stay or continue into Northrend.
---
Maybe this one by Platinum WoW?  He uses a mix of broad explanations about the game's draws, without going too in-depth and keeps it light with a few jokes.  
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xd2pdBVzwZw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xd2pdBVzwZw)
---
lol mage and hunter have extremely high skill ceilings in pvp compared to spriest
---
? Just delete your character and start again if u wanna reset fam
---
how do you plan on reserving your names a month before the game is open?
---
Why didn't you just make Virtual Machines and limit the hardware that way?
---
Sarkoth that level 4 scorpid.
---
Yeah, I thought it was fitting since that was what our guild was named after. Iron Maiden is one of those bands that when I hear I immediately associate with WoW because of how much I listened to it while playing.
---
This, shine in leveling dungeons it will carry you into raids. Do your best dps, use distract to avoid pat adds, kick heals, use stuns on fleeing monsters, use blind if you need cc midfight, level lockpick.
---
It depends on what system that PUG is using. There's a very good chance a PUG raid won't succeed though. 40 people in a PUG with a MUCh older play style... it's rare but... it's RARE. Good luck. That's wild-wild west territory and the Leader could just change the loot last second and yoink it all. I would NEVER pug that. The best solution is just to NOT do a full PUG -= beyond just the frustration guaranteed in it.
---
Now a Partial PUG raid, should clearly be lead by a proper Guild Leader that can be unbiased and treat both parties fairly. Obviously you can't use DKP or something... unless they were a recurring party I suppose. Possibly a reputation DKP system set up between the guild and specific individuals, but man that's a lot of bookkeeping. Usually this can turn into a guild full or majority merge too though, so that issue may resolve itself. 
---
&gt; heck do you ensure you'll actually have a fair shot at loot? 
---
I don't think it's possible. There's always a chance of chaotic evil in there haha.  If it's a 30/10, I'd imagine you'd be last on the totem pole for loot as the 10, first up on the 30, but still behind some kind of Guild determined loot system within that 30.
---
I recall most Guilds doing a PUG run if they wanted to see performance in general, taking you in, putting you on the DKP list or whatever system they used. I'm trying to recall when I used to PUG, being effectively part of that 10 you mention... but man it's so fuzzy. Bleh.
---
Depending on how bad you all needed eachother, I'm sure some bartering is required....
---
Decided to go tauren druid rather than undead priest because I want to have fun with friends and be able to be any role/provide utility. I was a teen who was not great during vanilla, so shape-shifting will provide me with some good challenges with play style too. Plus I still get the horde nostalgia this way.
---
Hi a warlock. i will always be a warlock., I'm dad.
---
Warrior charge too
---
I installed Classic once on a system with BFA already installed, and then about 6 times on each of these systems with a freshly wiped SSD and a fresh Windows install *without* BFA already installed. Got about 5 GB for all of them. If there is a difference, it's very minor. So, my guess is that no files are shared between the two installs.
---
It's your opinion of good game design. Some people like LFR and think that's good game design. There's BFA for everybody.  
---
&gt; and will still give people who don't want to use it the option not to.  
---
This is nonsense. Once you open the box for one person, it's open. You can't justify bad game design by saying "You don't need to participate." LFR is bad game design, and my not participating in it doesn't make it any less bad. LFD is bad game design, but I'd be retarded to try to organize groups in trade chat to run the dungeons myself since it killed my ability to find players.  
---
If I make the choice to painfully level as a healer and my endgame reward is that I am just as powerful of a healer as everyone else that leveled as a DPSer and swapped, that's **bad** game design.  
---
And it isn't a "a bit of extra pride." It's gamechanging amounts of pride. The amount of pride you'd have in your lv60 paladin on classic that you leveled 100% as Holy (or needed to group to level), and the amount of value that you would have as one of the few tryhards wiling to level as holy, would be substantially higher.  
---
You're just loading up your garbage opinion into your entire stance, which would be fine if you weren't so wrong. Dunno what debate there is even to have here; you're a casual. Go back to candy crush.
---
This meme absolutely fits my ZG run in pserver 2 days ago. Yeah i cleared it back then but for example no one remembered perma sheeping the blooddrinkers.
---
It became more a graveyard run than a ZG run lol
---
One issue you'll have with that mindset though is that on certain fights that additional 90 seconds means a wipe.  More time for something to go wrong, bad RNG, healers running OOM, or hard enrage timers like Thaddius and Patchwerk.
---
Warlocks, for example.
---
There is only one rule: Ban/remove whatever/whomever so that they can get that power trip dopamine hit.
---
I've never found a good way to make virtual machines imitate GPUs reliably, and having the physical hardware seemed like the most reliable method. Can VMs perfectly emulate GPUs, even obscure GPUs from 2008?
---
No one actually dies in the retail version, there are bazillion damage dampening spells.
---
Our guild will fit your needs.  You can apply here!   https://www.guilded.gg/r/EnORLQ3yKl?i=841VqM5d

Thanks man. I’m really putting effort into these ones! I’ll strike gold one day!

No it wouldn’t
---
Christ. You just skim other people's posts so you can get to praising your own narcissistic ass faster, don't you?
---
Nobody cares what YOU want. You've repeated what YOU want like six times now. We get it. It was never relevant, nor asked for.   
---
You are just one person, classic will have tens of thousands of tanks, and this thread was about how to make dungeons go smoothly with as many of them as possible. YOU are irrelevant in this context, and YOU are not special..
---
Figured it might read more easily for you if I highlighted references to you, like they have to do for Trump.

And best!
---
We can help you with finding a home guild!   https://www.guilded.gg/r/EnORLQ3yKl?i=841VqM5d
---
It's in the battle.net launcher, right above the play button there should be a drop down tab and you can click on the classic beta/stress test.
---
That’s never an option because the idea is you play with people doing similar things.  Even if you can de facto claim a server for some challenge or other, trolls will show up and ruin it because none of the rules are enforced server side.
---
assert your dominance by belittling the most dominant personality in the raid
---
The only raids a PUG should join are straight rolls, never something like Loot Council. Everyone might agree on "one piece of loot only" or "if the Bindings drop, they're only going to the MT", but that should be discussed before the raid starts.
---
dont worry im already  doing that with my 2012 laptop
---
&gt;  No one will give a shit if a 30 guildmates/10 pug raid shits on the puggers with loot distribution.
---
This is untrue! Word travels.
---
IMO the most fair way to distribute loot with a Guild/PUG mix would be to /roll on any item that a pug is interested in. Maybe distinguish which possible items PUGs will be rolling on as I'm sure there are plenty of items that are only sought out by guildies
---
Because there is no sensible reason to make your gaming experience worse.
---
And not using dark mode... It's a no from me.
---
A300 desk mini. Yep, those are a good pick. If someone isn't afraid of building a small PC then doing an mATX build could be also a good solution as it gives the option to drop dGPU for bigger resolution or to play more demanding games. With low prices on second hand RX570/470 and even 480/580 it's quite tempting.
---
Or maybe Deez Nutz
---
great explaination, i particularly like all the attention to detail you gave
---
I hate that you're right
---
i feel called out
---
Aiden, The Academy Is..., Bayside, Say Anything, JamisonParker
---
Why do you love pally so much?
---
Robert wielded a two-handed hammer, so looks like he's a more Might of Menethil type :)
---
So your idea is that we use the shitty old client and play the game on that?
---
Yes, obviously the server lag wouldn't be an issue since we use the modern server, but that doesn't mean that the original 1.12 client isn't trash. 
---
The old client has security issues, it's not optimized for modern operating systems and it doesn't support modern CS. 
---
It's also not integrated with battle.net which they want to do.
---
There was an interview even with the devs talking about why the old client is bad. They literally said the first thing they tried was to look at the old client and see if they could change it, but how they do it now is a much better way.
---
That is definitely my goal, 60 by Thanksgiving.
---
I plan on being a pretty decent R-Druid in PvP and PvE. Topping meters doesn’t mean much to me. Winning and downing bosses while providing good healing and utility is what I’m excited for.
---
Open rolls baby.
---
Yeah some people think it is worth it for a smaller hit box. But there is hidden code that causes severe penalties to relationship, reputation and career - so it's not worth it.
---
The game runs flawlessly on an i5 3210 (dual core 2.5ghz-2.9ghz) 4gb ram laptop. Looks pretty good too mostly low with high textures.
---
But GODS the world PvP was strong then.
---
Are you using the keypad to move?  What is your camera set to?
---
I just now got this installed and having a hard time moving around and seeing everything due to the camera.
---
Here's the thing, though. Sharding was more about managing the population of a specific zone. Layering is more of a server-level to manage the world population and merge it together once we see the (expected) drop of players. 
---
The problem is all the population of that layer will be in the starting zones at the beginning, so you'll still see a lot of overcrowding. That should hopefully pretty quickly spread out.
---
I thought I was missing something.
---
It is fun being a lock on Rag being able to just go crazy, but some of the bosses should have higher then usual shadow resist i believe. This could be just my experience on those servers we don't talk about, but i know some bosses, locks will do less dmg just because of boss shadow resistance.
---
I don't see how a warrior has time to get behind you if you've started charging an aimed shot.
---
Did smite priest in BC. Would do again.
---
I want to focus on the sound effects and music makes it harder to concentrate on them. Like someone talking in a movie theater where the talker is the music and the game and associated sound effects are the movie.
---
Other people on your team/faction.
---
Sure thing, loremaster.
---
Looks more like the human starting zone, except the humans are dead.
---
&gt;You are just one person, classic will have tens of thousands of tanks, and this thread was about how to make dungeons go smoothly with as many of them as possible. 
---
It's not at all about me, this advice applies to those tens of thousands of tank just fine. I don't get why this is such an infuriating concept.
---
I believe I was rather clear that in order to even tank as a Prot Paladin (which people did do) you'd have to "know your place" and heal in raids until you accumulated enough gear to actually allow for it.
---
And even then your limit was 5-10 man's.
---
That's pretty realistic to say. Hell, during the TBC pre-event and TBC launch there was plenty of Paladins running around with Thunderfury from their guild having MC and BWL on farm for months.
---
If you put in the time as a healer you can get Prot gear, you just won't tank in raids.
---
Don't understand why people despise a particular faction. I play both Horde and Alliance and it's great to have a choice and experience the other side of the game
---
Black lotus were 1h respawn not 2
---
Are people from Norwegia friendly or elitist?
---
I had totally forgotten that flag carriers weren't shown in WSG!!
---
&gt; Like the buttons to sell all greys at once
---
I've been using the same macro since tbc for this... is it in the default bags interface now? (using bag addons too geez)
---
I've raided successfully and put up competitive numbers on 100+ ping so I have to disagree

Yhul the Ghoul
---
I mean I've played with them again since that point but still, the point still stands. I would say in the last 3 expansions for Wow I've added, maybe 2 people to the friends list from in game, and have never spoken to them again since that day. All my friends on retail come from better socially defined games.
---
I am 100% placing my money on the Forsaken being the most played Horde race
---
Well let’s see what else... Fear is a better CC than sheep, period. Healing your target for the most part sucks, and Fear also lets you get grater distance than just running away from a stationary target.
---
Aoe farming is doable in nearly the same speed if specced for it (both classes still need to drink). The lock AOE spec is less versatile for other things as opposed to Frost tree just naturally getting the imp. Blizzard without having to really change your phase 1 DPS, true, but if you are in lasher farming mode for example, it pays for the spec cost pretty quick. And th AOE playing field is more level when you have to realistically go to an instance to avoid overcrowding or ganking.
---
Extra bags... is cool. Not a dealbreaker when you can get 20+slot bags for Shards.
---
Summon makes it easier to find a tank or healer. Much bigger draw for a player to join your group when you can tell your prospective tank he can just chill and wait for the summon. Healers will like your mage water, but they probably appreciate the summon more.
---
Dark power calling...
---
I tend to park my toon manually at a fishing spot and then go from there.  I haven't tried much of anything beyond fishing.  TBH I bet anything else will be brutal.  My plan for classic will be to part a auction alt right in front of an AH or mailbox and my main at a safe fishing hole for remote sessions.  Anything else might be tough, but I'll try and optimize some stuff and post results tonight.
---
Not all the vanilla elements are going to be left as they were in 1.12 - for instance, drop tables will be partially an approximation of earlier patches - so this is a kind of a bizarre thing to keep because it wasn't broken for all of vanilla, just for the patch they picked. So in a way the fix is "more" classic because it was that way at an earlier point in time.
---
All they read is “prot paladin can be done”.
---
I know what it requires and it’s stupidly expensive and not worth it
---
I see a PTR: World of Warcraft . But not “ classic Beta / stress test “
---
That is not how I remember vanilla
---
Wait are you serious? I was planning on running to dun morough from teldrasil using the wetlands drowning trick, so you’re saying that doesn’t work on beta?
---
Also, this seems to be a shocker for people, but you can get your character good gear *as you level*.  I always try to have the best possible gear for my level, and never had a problem with twinks.  They might be a bit stronger, but you can certainly compete.

---
"the shitty old client" works better then Classic wow beta. Security issues? Maybe when they are run in someones basement and via dubious hosts like private servers. Blizzard can put into place fixes for security on their back end? And fix the exploits that have been known for years now.

Instead of remaking the game, remaking the bugs and adding more bugs on top + addinng a layering system that will kill economy and basicly invites exploiting it -\_-

idk if you knew this but this sub doesnt have favorite streamers
---
Yep and with blizzard pointing the gun at me to play it every day I think I will pass, not worth it.
---
Do you even understand sharding? Layering is like continent-wide sharding. So any similar system that is confined to a smaller area is closer to the type of sharding they have already implement, and that the Classic community has emphasized they do not want to see.
---
You roll and if they cheat you then that guild will never successfully host a pug on the server again.
---
one is better
---
&gt; Can VMs perfectly emulate GPUs, even obscure GPUs from 2008?
---
Yes. Assuming you have a compatible machine and correct BIOS settings, Virtualbox will allow you to completely passthrough the PCI device and then limit the vRAM and clock speed of the GPU.
---
IN AN OPEN FIELD!
---
Retail's loads are huge compared to Classic ones, I've noticed. So I think the game overal requires less. If you can't run retail you could still run Classic I think
---
While I think there might be some connection between being bad, and envious of PvP players leading to twinking, I also think some good players twink. That's not to say that twinking is anything to be venerated. Its essentially someone showing off wealth in a literally smacking you across the face with it kind of way.

We utilize an EP/GP system to assist our Loot Council in making gearing decisions and we raid two nights/week Tue and Wed from 8pm – 11apm Eastern. \*\*During progression we reserve the right to add a third raid day, in that case, we will also raid Thursday night

---
&gt; going to the MT
---
MT is a position in a guild, not a pug, but definition a pug would have a different person as tank every time and there coudnt really be a main tank....
---
&gt;If you want your group to play in some super rigid way all you have to do is form the party yourself and clarify that before the run.
---
That'll be up to whoever tanks my runs. I guess you missed that part as well.
---
&gt;It's not at all about me, this advice applies to those tens of thousands of tank just fine.
---
\&gt; Everyone is like me or should be like me. Mine is the optimal way. 
---
Optimal is subjective. Clearing time isn't everyone's *main* goal.  
---
Do you get this concept at all? That what is true for you, isn't necessarily true for others?
---
If people queue for bgs with bad items and not at level cap deserve to get slaughtered.  I always gear up as I level and never had a problem with twinks.
---
Well, raiding and late 60 content is not all this game is about.
---
Leveling, instances, questing, pvp and other stuff can surely fill your time with fun..
---
Also, the early raids will probably be quite easy to do with pickup groups many times a week, i guess it depends why you say you cant raid.
---
Its surely worth it as long as you are having fun though, right?
---
You start to see that light at the end of the tunnel at lvl 36 when you get whirlwind :) Once I got Mortal Strike it was like playing a different class.

Oh that's handy! Thanks!

When the honor system comes out and every streamer decides to rank early - that'll be a very homogeneous Twitch directory for several months

Night elf melee also gets Thier pick of all axes and daggers that drop. Humans won't even want them, and if min maxers are to believe, then they will be everything
---
Cool thanks for the clarification.
---
i’ve just been trying to restore my old toons and in my ticket from blizz I was asked to create a new toon and delete it straight away and my old characters would reappear. Did this work for you?
---
This idea effectively destroys the legacy server because 99% of the playbase will move on to the new hotness.
---
the 400 IQ play is just grind wintersaber rep. Reverse Wetlands run? pffft I'd rather spend dozens and dozens of hours running north and south in Winterspring

I absolutely guarantee you could not just throw up a new instance in Blizzard's modern cloud infrastructure and have it work. cmon bro, really?
---
Oh okay. Thanks for filling me in.
---
I think you would be a great fit for our community!

Here is some more information on our raiding: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lW8Pj2ENl8hLTK8qzzPMoD8Vnxfry390grfGYdy42JU/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lW8Pj2ENl8hLTK8qzzPMoD8Vnxfry390grfGYdy42JU/edit?usp=sharing)

Having been in both I experience the most drama in casual guilds compared to the hard core. In hardcore guilds everyone is on the same page and working towards the same goal, when the BIS sword drops it goes to your best melee dps who consistently puts in the most effort. Nobody cries or complains because they all expect it to be that way, that's why they joined a hardcore guild to play as efficiently as possible. When CTS drops the whole guild gets excited for the one guy who will get it because he will now do that much more dps for the raid. 
---
Now when CTS drops in a casual guild all anyone is thinking about is themselves. Everyone thinks they are just as entitled to loot as everyone else is. Doesn't matter if they've only been in the guild for 3 weeks, or haven't bothered to enchant any of their gear or have never popped a consumable in their life. They don't think of the bigger picture they just raid to get themselves geared.
---
Okay Nicholaes, buddy. You don't have to feel sorry for me. I enjoy the way I play the game and I certainly do not see it as a job. You know, its possible respec for pvp/pve and do your best without being a try hard, right?  
---
&gt; You know a lot of guilds back in the day had things like bookins and enhance shamans in their raids when downing these things right?  
---
Might be true for some but certainly not everyone.  
---
&gt; were able to clear it just fine..  
---
Ye you couldn't be more wrong. People struggled a lot back then and in fact most people never downed C'thun and most guilds never even entered Naxx.  
---
Todays standards aren't higher because content is harder, it's just how the meta is. People are just way more experienced today and prefer fast and clean runs.  
---
I do know what I'm talking about but we clearly don't agree with each other. Maybe we should just agree to disagree.
---
If you are playing casually, just play want you want. No reason to worry about it.
---
well a thing that is NOT different is the flaming.. tryhards will flame whatever
---
&gt;:(
---
A raid has a main tank and as many offtanks as needed. It's not a guild position, it's a raid position. A guild can have many main tanks and they do if they run multiple raid teams.
---
And since the Main Tank is easily the most crucial part of the pug raid, they're usually the one forming it and leading it. If the MT says "I'm not rolling on any loot, but if the Bindings drop, they're mine", that's the way it goes.
---
Correct, ganking is just getting in the way of what they planned to do
---
You don’t. You take the chance and that’s it
---
Most people are scum bags. Don’t expect anything
---
I live at home and don't have a girlfriend, so I'm feeling pretty confident about Classic! I do need to stop trimming my beard though, so that it can get properly neckbeardy.
---
Doesn't fit my listed times
---
That may be, but remember that valley is shared :( I doubt there will be more forsaken than orcs and trolls combined 😔
---
Here is some more raiding info: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lW8Pj2ENl8hLTK8qzzPMoD8Vnxfry390grfGYdy42JU/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lW8Pj2ENl8hLTK8qzzPMoD8Vnxfry390grfGYdy42JU/edit?usp=sharing)
---
These are good points, and the 5 man content in TBC was ace.
---
I've never seen anyone use those for benchmarks when running reviews on hardware/software websites or YouTube channels. There's no way that's going to be more reliable than using the actual hardware. I definitely appreciate the info, but I feel more confident using a hardware approach for this purpose. I may go back and repeat these tests via a VM just to compare though.
---
The example was 30 guildies (so a MT) and 10 PUGs
---
Doesn't matter. People will view it as the continuation of the Vanilla raid/tier progression and will switch over, along with all the streamers, because it's 60-70 content.
---
It's pretty unanimous that TBC was the best era of wow in terms of talent points and spells/skills.
---
Here's the thing, if you were really competent and enthusiastic about raiding then you wouldn't play a boomkin and expect other people to carry you...
---
It's like if I called myself competent and enthusiastic about playing basketball but day after day I showed up to the gym in my sandals..
---
10g, all in the berries really
---
Good geared people in PvP ruin the game for people who aren't geared. At 60 this is apparently not an issue, regardless of whether you HAVE to PvP in order to get the best gear accessible to you. At lower levels where PvP have very few rewards and it doesn't really matter this should not be allowed. A Naxx geared dps killing a new dinged 60 in two seconds is fine. A 19 rogue killing a level 12 is not. I don't understand why people think there's a difference. It's just how it is.
---
Sharding doesn’t lock you to a shard once you’re in it and nor does it allow people to hop realms or prioritize guild members.
---
Here is some more raiding related info: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lW8Pj2ENl8hLTK8qzzPMoD8Vnxfry390grfGYdy42JU/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lW8Pj2ENl8hLTK8qzzPMoD8Vnxfry390grfGYdy42JU/edit?usp=sharing)
---
Imo you should play what you most like, and roll a nostalgia toon as an alt.
---
I liked how you said FUCK THAT H and really streamlined the word honest
---
Generally if they are pugging they will allow for open rolls MS while reserving key drops while they advertise looking for pugs
---
Same here, have them all in a spreadsheet, knowing full well NONE of them will ever hit 60 😝
---
My gut is super unhealthy the past 6 months. I am talking chronically. Every day. I need like 10-15 grams of fiber to keep the problem in check.
---
So far I have been using chia and flax seeds as a pseudo supplement. But you cannot grab more than 1.5 or so table spoons of chia seeds due to health concern warnings.
---
I will probably try out the supplement on top of that. Just to push my good days from 60% or so to 100%.
---
I've got a full month after release for me. She's been with me for 8 years, so luckily she understands my deep hunger for classic.
---
Depends if you know the difference between a friendly person who's good at the game and wants to get things done - and a toxic person.
---
Is he a priest?
---
Dongeons are same but many will get a shock that they can't Speed run like they do now.
---
What will be interesting are the dungeons people have forgotten espcialy like the first one after NELF start BFD, whish was a pain just to get to start of.
---
Hey brotha!  I think you would be a great fit for our community!

Here is some raiding info: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lW8Pj2ENl8hLTK8qzzPMoD8Vnxfry390grfGYdy42JU/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lW8Pj2ENl8hLTK8qzzPMoD8Vnxfry390grfGYdy42JU/edit?usp=sharing)
---
&gt; That'll be up to whoever tanks my runs.
---
It'll be up to the entire 5 man group, the tank's opinion has no more weight than anyone else's.
---
&gt;&gt; Everyone is like me or should be like me. Mine is the optimal way. 
---
That's the 4th post with a straw-man and ad-hominem, we're done here.
---
You know what type of loot you’re allowed to roll on, starts with BoE epics and the most useless/common/already vendored once drops.
---
We once gave 6/8 t1 to a hunter in one MC, he paid 300g for 3 pieces and once he was out we decided.. fuck it.
---
Collect poop like in BFA?
---
There's a bug on the beta where sometimes priests become invincible, it's pretty well documented now so it'll prolly get fixed soon.
---
I love the racials but FUCK the way armor looks on them, they should have just let us have the bone knees/spine/elbows thing as a customization like the slack jaw or glow eyes
---
Hey my dude, check out the links I posted above.  If you and your friends are looking for a home guild feel free to apply! :)
---
I mean conc shot is still a little important!
---
“The most casual guild” isn’t going to think twice about inviting any specs, because they aren’t concerned with irrelevant shit like meta specs. If you’re easy to get along with and are able to turn on your pc, you’ll find a raiding guild.
---
Yeah mage, hunter, shaman lock are all great in AV.
---
That's what I've heard but didnt want to be too presumptuous. I raided casually and helped my guild down Rag for the first time but we never set foot in bwl. I was rank 8 I think (what ever Knight is) before they changed the honor system over to points. I felt like I had about average gear for people who played pvp at 60.
---
I tend to be on the meta side of things as a raid leader, but do keep in mind in order to beat enrage timer for patchwork dps only has to do ~330 dps each. That is so low.
---
why would a pug give a fuck if someone says they are main tank?
---
Main tank means that thats the tank that is most often taken on a raid.
---
I have pugged forever and have done guild runs forever, Im the guild main tank cuz im the most consistent, best geared, and most experienced. In a pug im just one of the 2 tanks
---
RP-PvP surely is the only true representation of MMORPG's - so its not a first unless its on RP-PvP because PvPers are avoiding RP.
---
No, it still matters if it's not on a PvP server.
---
Soz.
---
:(  it fetches a new saved version  of the next page and if one doesnt exist then it cant display anything. I went to rogue abilities and it  went into january 2007 version instead of the july 2006 of the frontpage.
---
Maybe theres one for each page? one can hope.
---
I'll have to agree. So far nothing from blizz on there being RPPVP servers though.
---
Some will be 5, some 6.
---
It's not AKs Grizzly anymore
---
With click to move I was able to get to the mailbox from the AH and back, but that’s about it.
---
Have to use the trackpad function and use two fingers at once for the toon to move.
---
All I’m looking to do is fish and post on the AH, so this looks doable.
---
It will never hit live
---
There's been a priest invulnerability bug in the game at least since AB opened. People were walking around AV constantly with 20+ people attacking them without dying on 1hp. Current theory it's something to do with Spirit of Redemption.
---
Rogue is a great class for herb/skinning though!
---
This is correct. Layering won't help with overcrowded starting zones, that's what sharding would be used for. Blizzard was very unclear about if they are going to use sharding additionally to layering so noone really knows how packed the starting zones will be.
---
Imo asking random people on reddit what they like isn't a good way to find what you like yourself. Just start from the top and watch a couple min to get a grasp of what kind of streamer they are, and follow the ones you enjoy. Way more reliable and not that much work imo.
---
This expression, I like it. I'm taking it.
---
Meh you can figure it out dude
---
 90 seconds is a made up figure, literally pulled out of my ass.
---
Eventually, people will get better and better gear  and that 90 seconds might be cut down by 1/3 and then it's not a wipe and they get even more gear
---
No one said it would be easy, they said it would be FUN.
---
Now, fun is subjective, but that goes both ways. Why doesn't everyone just do what they want and take their noses out of other people's business? Imo that's the best option, stop telling people how to play , play how you want, and find others who also want to play that way.
---
It's not going to negatively affect you in any way if other people you never talk to, play with, raid with, etc are playing off-meta specs.
---
it doesnt matter youd be hard pressed to find warriors willing to join this example, the term main tank means nothing to the person pugging
---
some rolls against people, this just means the odds are really against the pugged players
---
Yeah, exactly.  I'm more or less just looking for a way to make a few extra gold here and there when I'm bored and away from home
---
Hey brothaman!  I think you and your friends would be a great addition to our growing community!
---
I really like that idea. Literally take the OSRS route and just update and add upon the classic version of WoW, stuff that was never there in the original game. That sounds dope
---
Live doesn't have Resil anymore just fyi. 
---
Live still has BG specific reps, they just don't mean much.
---
The main difference is that all classes and specs are far less homogenous, and not every class has an answer to nearly everything like they do in retail.
---
This makes actions and choices have actual weight and impact.  Cooldowns are much longer and options are more limited.  If you choose the wrong ability at the wrong time, you're likely dead.  In retail, you just hit your damage reduction ability, or immunity, of self heal, and carry on till the cds are back up.
---
This same homogeneity, shared immunities/drs and self heals means that fights go on forever.  There's a reason arenas have had to resort to dampening to end most matches.  It's pretty sad that pvp has come to this, honestly.
---
And don't even get started on wPvP.  Might as well be two completely different games.
---
Imagine if we said the same with both world wars...
---
You need to state before the raid which items are reserved and make sure the pugs know. It's not uncommon to reserve the more rare and dominant drops so they will understand. Then, unfortunately for the classes that you pugged you will need to do rolls +1 item, resetting at 2nd last boss. (If you pugged a rogue and a mage piece drops, you can loot council that piece. Just the items that the pugs need will go to roll). This is why having a core 40 and rewarding people who show up is so important. If you have a member who is flaky, he is fucking the whole guild by giving items to pugs.
---
"Hey, we're getting a PUG together, wanna join?"
---
"Sure, who's the MT?"
---
Does not mean, "who's the guy that shows up to all the raids?", it means "who is tanking the bosses?".
---
Look at this guy with his fancy new processor's.
---
&gt; Dps warriors were a meme in vanilla wow.
---
wut face. Multiple Fury Warriors were present for almost every world first kill in Vanilla, not like rogues were but still.
---
Laptop with i5 and no dedicated GPU is awful in 1.12. Not sure if that translates but I was used to 20-30 frames in raids.
---
Hunters doesnt really need the stats, all you need is a good wep and your pet will do  the rest. This will work pretty well because you can take the agi gear and the druid takes str/int/stam gear since for druids str is more important than agi, and theres plenty of leather greens that gives str

Hi, /u/Yesyes_ouioui

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c26gnt/post_for_those_of_you_who_have_never_experienced/). 
---
The people saying its hard are still stuck in pserver mode where parry dodge and miss are thru the roof because of the incorrect numbers. Warrior and Rogues will be much easier in classic with the correct values.
---
I honestly don't like the look of much beyond the Black Dragon Mail set. Most of the lvl60 gear is just ugly. Beaststalker and Beastmaster both look super goofy to me. Giantstalker is decent, but I don't like the huge shoulders or the short-shorts. Dragonstalker makes you look like an exotic bird person. Cryptstalker, the brown spider set, is not all that bad looking if you hide the helmet and get a decent tabard to match.
---
The tier sets were great, you built them up and then moved onto the next while getting all the other items you needed elsewhere to allow you to do it. I used to love having to work out what I needed and where to get it from.
---
The only way to continue "vanilla" is to have vanilla esque expansions, anything else ends the classic experience and people will just ask for servers again in 15 years.
---
If they move on to TBC and you can keep your characters on classic and continue to play then the TBC servers die. I dont think blizzard is looking to further splinter the wow community. Any way they implement TBC does that is going to do that.
---
Also when would they stop rolling out the next expansion then?
---
Idk man this is the wow classic movement not the "wow we wanna play all the old games again" movement
---
It's like 5 gigs, it doesn't matter
---
It’s your loss if you complete this quest. You can smack players around the world if you keep the foremans blackjack. Beating the piss out of your friends with a club before a raid pull is a great thing
---
Ok cool, I've been doing it right then
---
3-4 actual pve encounters for fear ward, and of course stoneform comes into play, but this is still a situation where it's not going to make or break you unless you're going for world firsts or trying to be a pvp god. If you are, more power to you, but most people don't play at the level that necessitates it beyond playing what they enjoy.
---
Now it’s ttvwoodxblock
---
&gt; Also when would they stop rolling out the next expansion then?
---
Like everything in game development, that's a “future us” problem.
---
Yeah I tend to eat a cup of raspberries myself and it’s great. Yours works very well with frozen berries tho!
---
idk if you know this but bosses often require more than 1 tank.
---
I agree. their cloud cancer would probably not even be able to run the server when more then 300 people login without any sort of layering :P
---
Makes people only care about the dps meter but dont want to put in any effort butthurt.
---
World buffs wont matter anyway, since its all down to class pick if you will be at the top of the dps meter.
---
Removing the option to use them because some dont want to put in the effort to be at the top is just silly.
---
 Collect poop like in TBC..
---
you have plenty of mana to kill 1-3 ppl, depends ofc...vs shadow priest you are oom, also vs good hunters you can get oom, or good balance / resto druids
---
More info can be found in this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bzhiqp/game_breaking_godmode_pvp_bug_need_help/) regarding the bug.
---
I saw in that article that Louis said the source code was lost. I had thought they were always so good about that. I am ever in the very early days of Westwood (Westwood Associates back then), and this is a very vague memory, stopping at a bank during lunch where they were putting some discs in a safety deposit box.

Sweet humble brag topic
---
you know switch has a touch screen right?
---
Layering is to deal with overcrowded servers, not overcrowded zones. There will still be 500+ people in every starting zone without sharding.
---
Try restarting [Battle.Net](https://Battle.Net), thats how I got the dropdown to show for me last stress test
---
You also lose the World Enlarger.
---
Err, How is BC regarded the best? The Burning Legion retcons, what it did to Kael, blood elves joining the horde, space goats, it was a mess.
---
I actually couldn't agree more with this. It would be funny if pve servers weren't allowed to report world firsts
---
Blue set isn't BiS, neither is a full rank 14 set. BiS is Naxx. If you pick 19 as your twinking level you can get that character to near BiS in a day or two, not counting STV fishing rewards or AGM of course. A pure PvP character at 60 won't have BiS, and a raider at 60 will have to pay 50g to respec every time because they don't have the right spec for proper PvP. They will also have to use several golds' worth of consumables every match to stay at the top of their game, and they'll need 300 engineering. 
---
For maximum performance lower brackets is where most players will get the most bang for their buck. I suspect that with all the years worth of knowledge that most players have now lower brackets will be close to 100% twinked out because PvP as a leveler is a waste of time. This will make for some very interesting PvP. Just imagine games where everyone is at the exact same gear level as you are. It's fucking awesome.
---
No, your hardware is ancient and in dire need of an upgrade. You can scavenge parts better than this ;o;o;o;o;o
---
I would love the group finder without cross realm.
---
I honestly don't see how spamming world chat is in any way a better system, having a notepad file open to copy and paste from, making sure to change it as you get more dps or healers etc...
---
This has to be a bit of satire right?
---
PVP MM/SURV spec really needs savage strikes.
---
I imagine all the serious guilds that are going for kill brag rights will be on pvp servers anyway.
---
Don’t forget judgement
---
I can see where you are coming from... but based on my experience you are going to want to post those raid times now or else your recruiting efforts could be futile.  Unless people know the times ahead of time you could be recruiting sets of people who will never be able to make your raid times to begin with.  Just some food for thought.
---
See this is just your opinion. And opinions are like assholes, in that everyone has one!
---
I’m sure if a PVE guild gets World first kills, then those on the PvP servers will be fine with that and will pretend that it doesn’t matter. 😂😂👍
---
Heya norske brødre og søstre.
---
This is truth and you'll appreciate every damn upgrade you get, believe that.
---
It's a shame they made stat increases at all, to be honest (I am probably in the minority here?). I would rather have had just a bunch of cool different set bonuses that gave you even more freedom to customize your character.
---
In archeage (fuck those devs) I used a chest piece that made a "mind control" type ability an instant cast ... it wasn't BiS but it sure made wPvP fun (and people never expected it). I was a stealthing, melee/insta-cast magic user who would open on people (blowing CDs) and then MC them while my abilities came off CD and then canceling on my own terms to finish em off. So fun. :D
---
&gt;Imagine lore that's not based around weird time travel and even more weird alternate realities. 
---
You do realize time travel lore was put in the franchise before classic World of Warcraft, right?
---
As opposed to "make up random children" for Blackhand because they need a Big bad?
---
Someone should tell this guy about Diablo 2.
---
I'm 30+, I got nothing on streams and what streamers do all day. And I don't play retail, so I can't contribute to the 200 discussions about why is Classic better than bfa.
---
So basically I got nothing. Just lurking waiting for classic at this point.
---
How do you have time to auto attack between reapplying buffs.
---
As a mage the utility of a warlock looks sick. They have multiple builds for pve, candies, pets, soul stones, hard cc that doesnt heal, a free mount, and the coolest cloth sets. But spending hours farming soul stones is a no go, I'll keep my perma slow thank you. Besides if i play long enough my free food is better than a free mount lol
---
hahahhhaahaha
---
They were a joke character, the panda.
---
Yea but this way you can read it at the speed of not a retard..! Or a fourteen year old who is also masturbating, whichever bliz had in mind, I forget.
---
How are you reserving names?  Aren't they wiping everything on release?
---
Spoken like a true idiot
---
Don't tease me like that. My heart can't take it.
---
feels more like they just gave it random shit lmao
---
&gt; You know, its possible respec for pvp/pve and do your best without being a try hard, right?
---
You know not everyone has time to invest into a video game to come up with that amount of gold a week just to min/max raids right?  I feel like this is probably the biggest issue you have understanding this.  Some people only play for a couple hours a week.  
---
&gt;Might be true for some but certainly not everyone.
---
I would say if you looked at most raids back in the day of just average people downing stuff, you will 100% see unviable specs in the raids.
---
&gt;Ye you couldn't be more wrong. People struggled a lot back then and in fact most people never downed C'thun and most guilds never even entered Naxx.
---
I could not be more right you mean.  I never said that these guilds would get into nax did I?  You specifically stated that you would struggle to down BWL for christ sake, so that is what I was referring to.  They might not have been able to do every single raid but most of them for sure.  
---
&gt;Todays standards aren't higher because content is harder, it's just how the meta is. People are just way more experienced today and prefer fast and clean runs.
---
I'm so glad you did your research to study all the guilds throughout the years to see how people behave wow you are so smart...
---
Except you must have missed the MAJORITY of guilds on every single private server that has been out since Nost, where people don't care about debuff slots or specs or speed runs and just do the raids just to do them.  Christ on most pservers I was on people would literally message me randomly and ask if I had time to raid and I didn't even know them.  Finding 40 people will ALWAYS be tough to find for casual guilds.  Period.  Just because you think people are all of a sudden more try hard in an old game will not change that fact.
---
&gt;I do know what I'm talking about but we clearly don't agree with each other. Maybe we should just agree to disagree.
---
This isn't about agreement or opinions here my friend, you're just flat out wrong.  Have a good one.
---
First\*
---
\*in 15 years...
---
No worries, I thought we would be close enough.  Good luck!
---
Def looking forward to leveling dungeons with friends. Gonna be fun!
---
Private servers have dynamic respawns and have 10k people at start. Now imagine a server with 30k people with no dynamic spawns. It's not just about lag, you can look at the beta or the stress tests that they can fit tons of people in the same place, a lot more than what private servers could handle.
---
Layering is to prevent queues because they will have to put limits on server population and to prevent dead servers so we can have more people at the start than what we have later.
---
It's delusional to think that there won't be tons of people that leave after a short while. Imagine all the retail players who never played an MMO but are subed so will check it out.
---
Clearly you haven't watched any of their interviews or seen blizzcon where they explained in detail why the old client doesn't work. They even explained why in BFA you can't have too many people in the same zone but you can in Classic.
---
Yeah it's important to understand that lower middle class is still a lot better than the vast majority of the world.
---
My Battlenet launcher is downloading a 9GB patch.  I'm hopeful! But still no beta/ptr option on the region drop down.
---
"You think you do but you don't." -douchebag
---
After Feline Swiftness I would go down balance for omen of clarity. Furor is a great talent but I don't think it provides quite as much during leveling as it does for pvp/powershift raiding dps.
---
Omen of Clarity will get a lot more use in the earlier stages of the game than furor since most of the time you will stay in cat or bear form, only switching out to drop a heal. I'd definitely still get it, maybe even right after omen of clarity, but as someone else said, there really isn't a reason to level as HotW/resto spec because the resto points aren't that useful to you while leveling (minus furor).
---
Another alternative is going for improved thorns after getting omen of clarity. Someone crunched some numbers on a thread a while back, and the 75% increased damage from thorns over the next 25 levels adds up to quite a bit of damage. Of course it's more of a passive damage, but 75% more damage on only three points really isn't that bad.
---
Lots of good games on the store that are cheap. Only aaa games are expensive

That would have been great tbh.
---
That’s a great point that I believe might often be overlooked! A real chicken or the egg scenario. What came first, people demanding faster levels, or the levels themselves becoming a monotonous, cookie cutter grind? I have no idea, but it’s an interesting question!
---
They’re just jealous because Paladins are master race

I'd assume his issue is that it's a massive massive, fundamental bug, not that it's just a bug.

Fetch me the PTO stretcher!

I only recall one fury warrior in my raid back in vanilla. His name (ironically) was Tankos, and he was badass DPS. No other warrior was allowed to DPS besides him.
---
&gt; demanding people pull their own weight
---
You're implying that unless you choose specific races and classes and using cookie cutter builds you arent pulling your own weight, but we know for sure that this only applies to world first guilds and not to normal people who DO clear all available content in vanilla and BC and WOTLK
---
While the specifics of the current story might leave something to be desired, it is kinda cool to have a large chunks of content with an overarching theme, instead of a ton of short vignettes. Vanilla was a hundred-something hours to get to 60, then a bunch of hours to gear up...and you're fighting Ragnaros who had seemingly very little to do with everything you faced along the way.
---
They would have to make a special UI that takes advantage of the touchscreen for handheld mode and give mouse and keyboard support when docked. If they did that I'm all on board.
---
Hrm, hourly 5 instance lockout or 1 week lockout with 100x the commitment. Wonder which is easier/faster?
---
I just logged into the account they recovered in the Launcher using the dropdown menu and selected my old server Dethecus and they all magically reappeared!
---
Why does a warrior have mana?
---
If my account is still active but will end this month, can I still access the stress test?
---
No. The price of respec and repairs is the same as it always is. The disposable income of players is what changes, and that income comes from NPCs not other players.
---
So the total gold in the economy rises and rises because the sinks which take money out of the economy (AH cut, repairs, reagents, purchasing vendor items etc) can't keep up.
---
No they weren’t. They were a real race. But nevertheless, in the game like a decade or more before king fu panda.
---
They're not very popular in the US...
---
I mained a rogue in early vanilla and then switched to a priest for the last half before BC. Because of this I was thinking of rolling a mage when classic goes live and alting a hunter. Then I started remembering how incredibly insidious warlocks were... Then I started thinking about the feeling of raid healing on the priest and how much I loved it (I used to turn off all game sounds and listen to Mozart while healing to keep myself on an even tempo so I had less of a chance of getting distracted by emergencies and could react calmly). 
---
Now I have come around to rolling a priest again and alting either a lock or a hunter.
---
Don't even get me started on picking a profession.
---
That's an odd request to ask for us to downvote you.
---
Night Elves suck.

Cleary u have never played wow before wod or something right? I was there at TBC launch we had 1 zone for both horde and alliance to level in. guess what? we made it to 70. I was there for WOTLK and CATA launches aswell. guess what? No layering and we made it to max level.
---
If you cant deal with people then maybe dont play a social MMORPG. 
---
Cap servers at 5-8K, make 50 servers and add queues. People that wont keep playing will drop off imediatly anyway when there are massive queues. Thats just how MMORPGS work. adding a layering system has massive impacts on economy and will ruin the whole server cycle.
---
To you, others find joy playing the meme specs if they can get the gear.
---
To those who just tunnel vision on "Prot Paladin can be done" without learning how and to what extend.....fuck em. They learn the hard way like we all had to back on Vanilla release.
---
Being ignorant of the Prot Paladin meme is no excuse in 2019.
---
Should have only included 4 discs since the 5th was added to the boxes later on, including patches to potentially save people DAYS of downloading.  
---
9/10 good shit dude, really cool :p
---
Quel Serrar is too slow for efficient threat generation, you are robbing Peter to pay Paul by equipping it as a human. I experienced it myself on Nostalrius, 3 Human off tanks with Quel Serar, me as main tank elf with Finkle's Skinner, their threat generation was no where near mine when compared.
---
The 1% dodge is not going to starve you of rage, you will never be rage starved tanking a 40 man raid unless going back a tier, in which case you should adjust your armour appropriately.
---
Man, that time I was in greens and blues murdering the world on my rogue. The healing from the naxx geared priest didn't hurt. :P
---
please fill out the talents here: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#c

and send them to me
---
I may include them into the guide :)
---
Here are my 3 favorite druid balance specs:
---
**24/0/27 Moonglow/NS healer PvE build**
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/BJUwzxwABMw1xog
---
* Has Okay damage for non-raids and Great healing + healing sustain for everything including raids.
---
**30/0/21 Balance Damage/NS healer PvE build**
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/BJUxzx8AA8w1xA
---
* Has Good damage for non-raids and Good healing + healing sustain for everything including some raids.
---
**29/11/11 Balance Damage/FC/IS PvP build**
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/BZYMw8egAjORAjME
---
* Has Good damage for non-raids and high utility for PvP. I mainly used this build to push for Horde General? rank (the rank above PvP mount) back in vanilla.
---
Blizzard said it will be available later tonight
---
Guarantee you the guilds that a lot of the guilds willingly do this will have a lot more fun than the try-hards lol
---
People getting mind controlled and going berserk when looting bone piles or something too?
---
So.... stupid ones.
---
This trend of crossover of /r/classicwow and /r/freefolk is something I wholeheartedly endorse
---
thanks, yeah it took some time
---
I plan to update/fix slides and also to add more in the near future
---
I will be rolling a Prot Warrior. Plan to tank dungeons and raids if time permits. I was mage in Vanilla/TBC but starting in wrath and up til now I have been exclusively tanking but since I never got a chance to do it in vanilla I will roll prot warrior this time around.
---
It's crazy how people dont understand this, if you are a dps with the "wrong" build and have decent gear you CAN out dps the "correct" build BiS gear if they dont know their rotations or die to aoe's because theyre stupid. A "worse" healer class can be the superior healer if they manage their mana right and have incredible awareness and timing, etc. Class/race/build isnt everything if you know what you are doing and stay alive.
---
God this is so on point ha ha. Everyone will always come back for new content / Expansions though.
---
So, basically... If you have a rig that can run retail, you should be fine running Classic, right?
---
I have an older system with a GTX680Ti that's able to run retail with very few issues. 
---
I plan on raiding, so do you think I should go ahead and get a newer card?
---
R1 + a/b/x/y

24 skills. Ground targeting can be placed with pressing the button once then selecting the area with eight stick then pressing the button again. Right stick otherwise moves camera. Left stick move. Right/left on dpad tab enemies (when weapon sheathed can target non hostile npc). Up/down cycles thru party list.
---
It's not impossible.
---
Sir I'll have you know it'll be 26 and downloading a tb of pron
---
Gnomes do
---
Because PC's suck and are inconvenient. Consoles are plug and play and the switch doesn't require you to play at a desk.
---
To be fair in ultima you wouldn’t have to walk back to your corpse at all though, you’d just know it was empty and say fuck it, and grab new shit!
---
I found it by researching. It is medium priority and that puts it below all the main raid debuffs, but equal to many of the weapon debuffs (such as nightfall).
---
I did the research, and it is somewhat an issue, but it will NOT get rid of imperative things such as any tank or DPS based debuff.
---
People have this illusion that world first guilds set the standard for the millions of players. They were less than 1% of all players. Most people thought DPS warriors were a joke.
---
After seeing that name is unavailable so much, Isunavailabl is my chars name. As unavailable is unavailable and there’s a character limit
---
Cat durid is for fite
---
It is only irony if you are also wrong :P
---
Touchscreen in handheld, keyboard and mouse docked. Why is that so hard to understand? Furthermore they aren't pruning spells in classic.
---
&gt;If I was to level as prot warrior with a healing priest (the wife) would we be pretty efficient at levelling? I know you can still tank while levelling as dps, but i would like to be fully competent when the time comes.
---
Prot is worse than the other specs at tanking while levelling. Surviving is not an issue whatsoever in low level dungeons. You need threat, and prot does not provide much extra threat compared to the DPS specs. So if you want to tank, go fury or arms. 
---
While levelling outside of dungeons, especially with a healer, prot is absolute shit, only thing it does is make you survive for longer (which is pointless with a healer), but you take way longer to kill anything. A dps warrior with a healer is the best damage dealer in the game (taking damage increases your own damage), why would you ruin that by going prot? 
---
And even if you are solo levelling, the only thing prot might do for you is give you a slight advantage when trying to kill high level/elite mobs on your own. It's worse at everything else. 
---
Tl;dr: do not level as prot under any circumstance.
---
This may be a good fit for me and my brother. I plan on playing shaman while my brother plans on warlock. 
---
I’d just be interested in your raiding schedule, as that’s our one big goal is to do raids for the first time. We currently live in Hawaii so don’t know what to expect for raid times and/or if we’ll be able to make them every week or biweekly
---
Idk what the retcons were 
---
Also draeni were known to be corrupted in wc3. So idk how finally showing there non corrupt form is retconning?
---
Oh I would go for the cap always. That makes sense gotcha
---
I mean, I'm going to wait for the controller add on anyways so whether you like it or not there is a chance you'll play bgs with someone who is using a controller. Stop acting like wow is hard and needs 40 buttons.
---
Elements, wind fury was strong then!
---
No, cause then there would have been a massive failure. But since the entire purpose of layering tech is to handle server load on launch it makes no sense to believe it will be around until AQ.
---
You don't go extra points for just improved CS, you go deeper arcane for arcane meditation, IE in combat mana regen - which from my personal testing gives more benefit than the points in frost mana cost reduction - though I guess it's really probably not THAT far off.
---
2pm on a wednesday, i'm at work and can't participate. What kind of stress test is this? Just do it on a weekend blizz wtf
---
To you
---
&gt; Need 10 wolves (thousand players trying to kill the same 10 wolves)
---
Don't forget that most Azerothian Wolves are deformed and instead of dropping 4 paws they drop 1 or even zero :p
---
Sharding deals with overcrowded servers. Layering mitigates overcrowded population centers. 
---
Think of it this way, you have a zone with 300 people in it one one server. That server has 3 layers. You distribute them evenly: 100 people per shard. That's where you get your zone pop reduction. If you were to unravel the layers, you would have 300 people in that zone.
---
GIMME MY DRAGON KITE
---
?? I said adult Night Elf's fuck Adult humans??
---
Stop projecting you fucking freak
---
Yeah but I might get shot.
---
Everyone isn’t equally geared because you don’t get raid level gear just for logging in. 
---
Things actually die and gear actually matters in a PvP situations because scaling isn’t making sure that everyone can get a trophy.
---
Unfortunately it doesn't work for me. I've yet to find a cure for my chronic constipation. Every solution I find works for like 1 week and then my body just adapts and tells me to go fuck myself and then it stops working.
---
What about the strategy of not being a sucker and letting some dude gank you while you’re fight a mob? You can just shout no skill just because you didn’t see the danger arrive. That is a skill in and of itself, no?
---
I played Diablo 2. Blizzard should have relied more on the itemization from that game, instead of just piling on vertical progression. The raid tier set bonuses allowed players to change their playstyles in both PvE and PvP. This was a better solution than just adding more attributes to new raid gear, which is what WoW turned into.
---
Just use gold to buy a wow token
---
Can warrior not play daggers?
---
Master Class*
---
This issue is exactly why guilds are essential. They had a purpose in Vanilla - to find trustworthy people that appreciate you.
---
Hmm not sure, are you signed up to be in the wow classic beta in your account settings?
---
I kind of agree with that, but thst randomness allowed for players to be creative and cudtomize their characters.
---
They seem to be umming are areing atm different dev's have said differing things.
---
This bug is already well known, and has been for some time. I'm doubtful this one will make it to live. We are still 70+ days from release. Just like many other bugs that had been reported and fixed, this one will too 
---
To say that in it's current state the client is scuffed is a stretch. It's still leaps and bounds ahead of private servers, which is truly a "scuffed" experience. 
---
Don't worry, the sky is not falling. Continue to report the bug and move on. Just remember it's a beta.
---
I’m dagger spec
---
It would actually be the other way around. Go Goblin, craft the BoP items, then drop it and go Gnomish. The death ray cannot be used unless your Gnomish whereas the majority of Goblin items (such as grenades) can be used while Gnomish
---
That's not a terrible idea. But I already own a switch. I'd have to go buy a tablet or GPD Win.
---
Even if you have skill, you have to fight mobs at some point. What are you gonna do? Constantly wait for everyone nearby to leave before attacking anything? Come on dude
---
true. Nostalrius was a mess at times, but didn't they solve some issues and get a stable server with tons of players?  I thought they worked a lot of stuff out eventually.
---
Extraordinarily humble ones.
---
Even though the WoW reddit has over 1 mil subs, it only has 7k active users right now. In comparison to the 5k classic wow has. Food for thought
---
There are a number of ways they can mitigate the abuse, you just are so irrationally angry you can't stop and think. For example, what if it's possible to make resource spawns global outside layers? What if it's possible to limit resource spawning globally? What impact will it actually have relative to total player count even if it goes unaddressed?
---
Sure I agree with that
---
Sweet. Im in beta, PM me!
---
Not even a single enhance shaman for windfury?
---
Yeah, I just double checked. Have been for months. 
---
I also tried the beta Battle.net client and signing up for the PTR.
---
Still no option yet, maybe it's just slow. 
---
https://gyazo.com/33b95841aeef15c7ff6d3e3784c33082
---
I picked Paladin when I was younger because dying is bad, and I heard from friends that Paladins did next to no damage but would NEVER DIE.
---
Holy Magic, Plate Armor, healing ability, and survivability? WELL SIGN ME UP.
---
Still to this day my main, favorite class. We went through a lot together. Though, to answer your question:
---
I get envious of other classes when I have to pull mobs, with my face...
---
What stops me from maining that class is I don't care if I have to pull mobs with my face, I'll kill 'em all and go to the next group!
---
I meant layering, not sharding. 
---
With layering though, it's still one server. You are just splitting the clients interaction with the server into three separate channels. It is at the server level where you are making the split, I'm not disagreeing with you there, but as a result you will see fewer people in that starting zone than you would without the layering.
---
Thottbot sucked. Every time I used it I ended up on some bugged nonsense garbage item. Everything was super inaccurate. Allakhazam was way better and the comments were way less toxic than Thottbot. Thottbot comments were all people bitching about a Hunter taking their loot or people whining about how their class should get priority rolls on it and if you give it to another class, your guild sucks.
---
Fucking tormund followed me here one time
---
You're just mumbling gibberish - the question was why don't they release more servers as opposed to implementing layering. I'm telling you it's because they wanna cut costs. You said otherwise. No one is arguing that old servers are superior to modern servers.
---
Having a basically guaranteed opener against any non-human rogue seems worth it to me.
---
I plan to go fury warrior just so I can run 5 mans for my guild and if the need arises I'll try raid tanking.  I don't know how viable this plan will be but my first class is going to be Hunter just to feed my warriors gear cost.
---
A fairly common tactic these days.
---
Entitlement is such an incredibly lazy arguement.
---
What makes twinks entitled to steamroll lesser geared players in BGs? 
---
Maybe you should crack out some gems about living in my parents basements or something about snowflakes...
---
Yup, switch has a fully functioning touchscreen.
---
That's xp waste.
---
You want it to tp too or just find groups? Because TP sucks imo:
---
I'm in between rogue and hunter.  Rogue was my main from classic to wrath but the changes in cata made me give up on rogue. I had always a hunter as my 3rd alt behind Mage, so i proceeded to main Hunter from Cata - BFA.  Ive leveled both 30ish on "servers" with a 60mage as main ON ONE.
---
So question, if i told you Surv Cata hunter was one of my all time favorite specs and have mainly top raided as BM hunter since would you recommend 60 hunter to me?
---
Handheld: buttons + touchscreen.
---
Docked: mouse and keyboard.
---
I'm ok with this. Let them go back to retail. Vanilla is not going to be for everyone. Way more niche for sure.
---
The heal went through!
---
Mortal Strike is on the highest priority level, so that guess would be wrong.
---
Right
---
Lots of people are into the idea of a warrior. Even into the idea of tanking... but then the harsh reality sets in. You need a group for everything, soloing a pair of mobs becomes a real chore, you can’t farm as efficiently as most other classes - the list goes on and on. Basically being a warrior is like being an army ranger or something. Tons of people wash out, and end up playing rogues or something else equally mechanically straightforward, but those who succeed in trainer become a killing machine.  In the end, if you roll a prot warrior and stick with it, you’ll get groups like no ones business. The only challenge is getting there.
---
I never played shaman in vanilla and will be doing that in Classic. 
---
Previous toon was a human warlock.
---
So with loot trading I was thinking about this... then I remembered something from Wotlk and Cata era. Where blizzard would ban ninjas if loot rules were stated. 
---
So to prevent this you just insist on loot rules being stated. Free roll means free roll. If you win an item and don’t get it report them and it will almost certainly end in a ban.
---
Basically only join a raid as a pig if it’s open roll or MS&gt;OS. Any loot council shit and I wouldn’t join it as a pug cause you won’t get a shot at it.
---
Charges into Redridge, dies to boar 30 seconds later.
---
Yeah, I feel like warrior is the class that SHOULD have started the hunter gear meme. 
---
Taskmaster's axe? Need. 
---
Miner's cape dropped? Need.
---
Lavishly Jeweled ring? Need.
---
Oh, smite's dropped  and you already got taskmaster axe? need.
---
Neither dropped, and the emberstone staff dropped? need.
---
Oh, cape of the brotherhood dropped? need. 
---
Ooops, false alarm. It was the cruel barb. Need.
---
The thing is, ALL of those are very meaningful upgrades, and in the case of the emberstone, I would argue it's actually a much more meaningful upgrade for warriors than casters. For a mage, the emberstone staff is very nice. For warriors, it's a complete game changer. 
---
All gear is warrior gear.
---
We used to roll for loot when we had one of more randoms in our raid and an item dropped that they had a legitimate interest in (no Ashkandi for the holy pala). Word travelled fast on our server and we made a name for ourselves being a guild you could trust. And before long a decent number of those randoms became guildmates so we could fill our raids internally. It really paid off in the long run.
---
upvoted. that is such a good idea
---
I guess I just lucked out then, have been enjoying most of the suggestions. I’m new to twitch so I wasn’t having much luck finding consistent streamers and generally ended up quickly running into people that weren’t speaking English. It’s also fun just to know what other people are enjoying to check that out. Thanks for the advice though, there will always be an element of self exploration involved, but I was very happy and impressed with the response this morning.
---
Or because they couldn't get a tank spot, in my case at least.
---
One is fun, one is not.
---
What bosses ever require more than one tank on the boss mob?
---
Nothing in Molten Core or ZG.
---
Razorgore for Conflag, sure.
---
Vael? Only if you're not killing him in 45 seconds.
---
Kuri, sure.
---
Not going to bother with AQ40 or Naxx.
---
Hardly "often" and certainly not enough to ever call more than one player the MT.
---
I’m pretty sure the term “main tank” means exactly the same thing to a pug as anyone else.
---
The closest you'll be likely to see is new servers launching.
---
Unsure if new servers would progress through the phases, or just go live to the current phase.
---
And this would probably only happen if blizz's expected low retention model doesn't go down that way.
---
The only legitimate concern is possible abuse of the system. Which, since it's only temporary, means it will have minimal effect on the game. This also assumes Blizz doesn't implement solutions to the obvious problems with it.
---

In addition to the blood elves having 2 separate parts. In TFT, Kael took all the blood elves to Outland with him.
---
Pandaren Warrior?
---
Tbh I am probably going to roll mage.  The ability to farm aoe style, great pvp abilities, and a prime pvm class with great CC and dps.
---
All gear is warrior gear. Sagely wisdom.
---
Minimum specs for the vanilla WoW client (which you use on private servers) are lower than the Classic client.   
---
This means: some PCs will run the old vanilla client much better than the Classic client. Some PCs will be able to play on private servers and not run Classic WoW.  These are very old PCs often with no discrete GPU.   
---
People ask a lot if they can run the old vanilla client will they be able to run Classic. The answer is maybe not.   
---
Now, most newer PCs will be able to run Classic. And on many newer PCs, with graphics settings set higher, the new Classic client will run better than the old vanilla client.   
---
The new Classic client is superior in so many ways, and runs really well. The graphics look a lot better in game.    
---
The old vanilla client is just extremely lightweight and undemanding on the lowest settings.  That is about the only advantage it has over Classic (being able to run on some very old machines with minimal specs).
---
Swifty, Incredible Warrior Tricks I
---
The only “hard” thing about warriors is the leveling process *in comparison* to everyone else. It’s not like it’s ever going to be a challenge to level up in wow..  but it will take a warrior a lot more time than a mage if they’re both doing it right.
---
I was ser in stoję for druid od Paladin but nów i obły think about warrior.
---
That's not true you also have Maladath from BWL.
---
There is always a tank spot when you make your own group lol. Easy as "/2 LFM UBRS need Heals/DPS"
---
PLAINSRUNNING TAUREN IN AN OPEN FIELD NED!
---
Warrior, then Shaman, then Warlock, then Priest, then Mage
---
Looking forward to meeting you with my Paladin...
---
and this is why betas are important.
---
Nah opinions are like voices, we all have a different kind.
---
You've not tested the most (imho) important graphic setting, which is "Classic" that, if I understand well, sits in a kind of mid-lowish setting.
---
Don't know about the other users here, but I'll 100% playing in Classic settings, even if my hardware will be able to push prettier graphics.
---
Please, try and update your tests with the Classic settings.
---
Oh, I don't actually roll on all that stuff. But I do want to.
---
Invisible ones.
---
Yeah, it would likely only affect (in my estimation) world/server first kills through phase 1. I imagine (assuming blizz does nothing to change the system as it currently functions) the hardcore guilds will abuse the layering to power farm items/mats for their raid group. While this wouldn't necessairly give them an advantage over other guilds with similiar dedication/goals/community, it would give them a LARGE advantage over guilds on less populated servers who don't have the same kind of layering access.
---
Are you having a stroke?
---
Don't level as prot, it will take forever to kill anything and you will be perfectly survivable with a healer.
---
There is no amount of money I would not spend on this amazing creation if it were real....
---
&gt;Yes some of the numbers are off but the private server data is close enough that it should be fine.
---
I mean they had parry chance off A LOT. Not just a % or 2. Like it wasn't even close.
---
Why not just have pve first and pvp first?
---
There will be guilds that want to min/max. There will be guilds that allow everything. Not sure why people have to argue about it. 
---
Join a team that suits your playstyle.
---
Which race?
---
Take that money
---
During lvling soulshards arent hard to get, youve got this channel that increases mana reg for 100% out and 50%in combat if your enemy dies during channeling.
---
Thats also why i love warlock the most.
---
Never go oom
---
Never
---
There is also an app called crazy remote that looks to be a bit more advanced in movements (has left click, right click) and WASD movement, but it’s $10 in the store and doesn’t look to support Windows 10.  All the YouTube videos on it are 7+ years old.
---
Really surprised there isn’t a better option out there besides CRD.
---
Cat.
---
Hmmm, yeah... That sounds suspect.
---
It would be interesting to know how these would hold up in 5man or 40 man groups.
---
Is it feasible to raid with the Laptop? I have Laptop with a reasonable age as well and would love to know if I can expect to be able to play on it, but the FPS while standing alone in IF seem like a not so good indicator for that.
---
&amp;nbsp; 
---
Fantastic work, though. Thank you so much for the effort.
---
That's a good looking cowsham, pard.
---
We raided up through bwl and sorta took stabs at aq40 but it was too close to TBC and we fell apart.   
---
So I had a mixture of teir 1 and 2 and I was better geared than the general pile of the server. For my server atleast being a raider was far less common than not.
---
I played shaman from vanilla to cata. I can basically no life wow in the winter. Do I heal as a holy pally? Or do I be that person and play Rogue. Lol I’ve been back and forth with this for months..  I can find rogue videos but literally zero holy pally guides.
---
I was there at TBC Launch and there were barely any people around compared to what 5k people would mean for the starting zones. Although that might have been because the servers sucked so much that you could barely zone into Outland for the first day or so. Wrath was a bit smoother but I don't remember there ever being a mass of people in wrath anywhere.
---
It's not about me dealing with people I don't mind if there's a bunch of people, the queues I would hate.
---
You have to be realistic, Blizzard won't do server merges, they won't do queues and they don't want 10k people in the same zone. This has been confirmed. There is no point argueing about that. It's like argueing against titanforging. Everyone knows it sucks, yet we also know that blizzard won't remove it at this point. So why bother?
---
The only reasonable arguement is how to make layering better. Because it does suck as it is now, but anyone who thinks Blizzard will just decide not to do it is delusional. If they see how easy it is to exploit there is a realistic chance they will make changes to it.
---
Most of the time, but when it get repetitive then I just power through the zone and forget.
---
In My experience this is outlined beforehand and usually you just /roll but with some items restricted depending on the raid leaders prerogstive. You just have to trust in the reputation of those leading the raid. I'd they mess up chances are they won't be running more than one raid.
---

&gt; You can’t tell the gear the enemy has equipped.
---
Solution: Disable transmog when you are PvP flagged.
---
Also what the other guy said, people just use noggenfogger or costumes anyway
---
Ah, I knew there was a reason...  when playing generalist, you would want to be setup for AoE grinding where you would use arcane explosion liberally, and even then when kiting with cone of cold sometimes you literally have no mana at all.  In those cases you can rank 1 cone of cold kite infinitely and still regen mana assuming arcane meditation and mage armor, allowing you to lengthen the fight and eventually kill whatever you are dealing with.  Shatter requires you to freeze things in place/nova which is already a long cooldown reserved for unfortunate cone of cold resists, so you typically do not want to use it on cooldown anyway, so its use is more an oh shit I had a resist than something you can rely on for shatter dmg, and even without shatter you should be critting 30ish% of the time with reasonable gear.  Also improved dampen magic can be pretty useful in PVP too, against mage counters like shadow priest and lock, though definitely not that difference making.  I definitely think your build has some good things going for it in a PVP setting, and shatter can be extremely satisfying, but I feel like a generalist build should fill all mage niches well and particularly be suited to the AoE farming that is the mage bread and butter for gold making, and the build I linked is one I used in and outside of raids with no need to respec until I geared enough to go arcane frost in raids with arcane power.  Also 3/3 imp blizzard is a no no because it has a stronger snare than cone of cold, meaning if you cone of cold with blizzard snare still up it doesnt apply and mobs eat you when blizzard snare drops.  2/3 is enough albeit slightly less dmg with blizzard, in return for being able to cone of cold while mobs are still under blizzard snare to keep things constantly slowed.

1%? Of the people who ROLL warrior? Hahahaha. I think you may need to revise that.
---
Paladin can only heal
---
Systematically feeding your new players excess gear using ML is more than enough to keep them playing. Rolling on gear allows trials access to incredibly rare pieces like DFT, which is frankly really fucking goddamn stupid. 
---
Keeping loot on ML doesnt mean 'deny everyone not core' it means 'gear core before new players'. Getting to the point of excess where you can afford to gear newer players comes very, very early on, and with a good ML system, new players can get powerfed gear.
---
Giving free access to loot to everyone isn't a kindness, it's a punishment. It fucks the guild and hinders progression. If you're an individualist and only care about YOUR progression and YOUR items, sure, it's better, but that's not how raiding in good guilds works. You need to care about the team, and the guild, because you are only 2.5% of a 40 man raid. Give the upgrade to those who can use them the best, which in turn gives you access to more boss kills, which in turn gives your guild access to better gear. The more bosses you can kill, the more loot you get per week, which accelerates the rate of loot trickledown.
---
Your idea of 'treating people well' has the unintended consequence of a lack of security and infrastructure. You can enjoy playing with them, but a non-ML system will never be optimal for any class of player in a guild. Trials can walk with high priority pieces, prioritizing giving tier bonuses to characters that need them isn't possible, players can roll on retarded shit they don't need.
---
A good ML guild that has their shit sorted out will systematically gear every player to the teeth, but they need the time to do it. They will see more bosses dead because their throughput is dramatically higher. Unlike in a roll based guild, if you show up every week in a ML guild, you will eventually get BiSed out, and when you get BiSed out in that process depends on how you contribute to your raid. 
---
You dont strike me as the hardcore type if you're advocating roll systems, IDK why I'm bothering trying to explain why ML is better if you cant see it yourself.
---
Your guild sounds cancer and I would hate it. 0 care for gear assignment means they arent putting in full effort on progression. Without a primary focus on progression, I would not enjoy your guild. If you say your guild didnt care much for gear, it means your guild didnt care much if they did well. Gear assignment is fucking VITAL, to the point where modern guilds are split raiding to properly assign gear using ML systems. 20 alts, 20 mains in a raid, the 20 alts get nothing, the 20 mains get all the loot. The mains and alts swap, and the guild runs the raid again. 
---
Nothing beats ML.
---
:(

I kinda like it, but improved ghost wolf so late and not maxed out? And no improved lightning shield? That's my favorite talent on the entire tree! I suppose you dungeon a lot with this build, or?

What do you do for your remaining six points?

He's not going to be playing high end. He just said he's gonna play casually. They are pretty easy to pick up

Sry bro you're wrong. Please watch the interviews about layering. Layering is continental wide and simulates a server with about 2-3k people. If there are more people online on that server they get shifted on a second layer, more than 6k players and a 3rd layer opens on that same server and so on, players don't get distributed evenly.
---
You are describing exactly what sharding is, not layering.
---
Yeah, obviously the DPS wouldn't be representative of what you do in PvP, but  you can use the AVG DPS Calc page to see the damage of each ability, as well as the health/mana of the main page to see what stats you would have with certain gear/buffs.
---
Have a buddy who claims he hops on from time to time to drop 1 arrow in the AH and see what it will go for.
---
Of course. This was what made Gurubashi amazing. That run seemed like it took fricken FOREVER lol
---
Yes those happen all the time in betas, it is to be expected.
---
&gt; What makes twinks entitled to steamroll lesser geared players in BGs?
---
The fact that they went out of their way to save up and purchase the best BoE items available, completed quests/dungeons that may be difficult for characters at their level to complete (obviously getting ran through by a 60 is common though), acquiring mats/gold for high level enchants for all of their gear...the list goes on. 
---
What's the difference between a twink acquiring the best gear possible for their class level, and a level 60 dedicated raider that decks themselves out in AQ40/Naxx gear? Both of them had to work to acquire that gear, and will shit on lesser geared players at their level.
---
I didn't say they do nothing, I said trinkets and potions can do the same things - and they're not going to be needed most of the time anyway.
---
Damn, I miss Bobby B. Gonna kill some boar in his honor in August.
---
Bobby B tell 'em!
---
No this is totally relatable. My friends and I only completed MC ZG ONY and a bit of AQ20, and we forget most of it anyway. The second we step foot in AQ40 it will be blind and we will die....excited for it!

Do you know if it’s possible to have retail and Classic both installed but on separate hard drives?  I would like to put classic on my SSD but keep retail on my HDD.
---
If you can run BFA, you'll run Classic as well or more likely much better.
---
How is it cutting costs exactly?
---
Do you really think just because another realm name pops up in the list of realms it costs them more?
---
10 realms with 10 layers each is the exact same thing for the servers as 100 realms with 1 layer each.
---
OP would probably lose his virginity with himself and then high five each other
---
You can get 3 buffs off per auto.  Waiting for that 3.6 sec auto timer.
---
Then go for it.   But how often are you going to stumble across another stealthed rogue in a situation where this matters, outside of duels?
---
Wasn’t there 6 disks?
---
&gt; how does this work?
---
Math and shit.
---
Classic is a "4" preset, so you can *roughly* approximate it as being harder to run than the "1" Low preset I used, but much easier than the "10" preset I used for Max.
---
Dont lie. TBC launch the whole server had to meet at the darkportal and go through it. It was a cluster fuck even on lower pop server and very hard on high pop servers. All the questing zones for horde and alliance had quests in the same places. world pvp, ganking, griefing.
---
a vanilla server can work fine with only 1-2K pop. it has been designed for those numbers. A 10K pop server is not fun at all. I rather play on a 3K pop server then on a 10K pop.
---
Oh is that was "fucked up" means?! 
---
GET MORE!

$30

Added a SSD for $70
---
Added a 6gb 1060 for $100
---
I’m in $200 on wife’s WoW classic rig 
---
Seems like a steal to me.
---
So again I'll ask you - if it costs the same why are they implementing sharding as opposed to releasing more servers?
---
Do you have any PTR’s listed?
---
Gotta spec down to holy shock!
---
We were talking about OCR anyway so no data from the wow process is read in either case. Also it's piss easy to sandbox processes so that they are not visible to others.
---
I am only ever jealous of those who actually managed to see the Cruel Barb drop, I easily ran VC over 100 times between  levels 16-34, and I never saw it drop. My warrior's RNG in vanilla was painful to say the least.
---
So what's the point of this post? To try and put down anyone else who has been playing games for this long as well? Are we all "wasting our lives"? I work 6-7 days a week, play with my kids, take care of my family, run a business. I'll do whatever I damn please on my spare time, and it's not a waste of time.
---
Bought the SSD and Graphics card used on eBay
---
they should name one realm on eu and us nostalrius :)
---
Pretty sure layering is an alternative to sharding. It serves the same function, at least as I read it.
---
Been doing this by looking around my room and just picking a random item, the two that have grown the most on me are , "Lanyard", and "Painting" strangely enough. Made a runescape character recently named "Air Purifier"
---
I dont have the button but I did check for updates and its downloading 8 gigs
---
Definitely mage.
---
Idk what kind of questing addons there are, but when I played classic you had to just to figure out where you needed to go for the quest.
---
thanks for lettuce gnome
---
Not saying your wrong, but what is your thinking that layering will affect world and server firsts?
---
How will they get a LARGE advantage? The larger the server, the more competition you'll have. Someone layer hopping will potentially get more opportunities, but resource influx is going to be gated by time. How much of an advantage will they realistically get before it goes away?
---
In a theoretical optimal scenario, layer hopping can get you resources faster than everyone else. But it's going to be far from that optimal scenario during release. I suspect it will be a slight advantage and insignificant vs putting time and effort into other things.
---
The 10 year old play pokemon and yu-gi-oh. Most Magic players are 25+
---
I have also seen were the guild members who need roll and the pugs roll.  If a guildmate wins it goes to the guilds loot system and if a pug wins, they get the loot.  
---
The obvious issue is people in the guild who dont need it rolling on it so that the pugs dont get it.  Just need people to not be shitheads. :)
---
10 teeth and an hour later
---
Shit you're right. My bad
---
Did you know that Blizzard already launched an MMO once where the population *didn't* shrink after launch? Want to know how they solved this? It's crazy, you won't believe it.
---
They opened a bunch of new servers.
---
I mean your a Rogue and it's world pvp. That's fish in a barrel no matter how you cut it. Very little difference between a rogue ganking a 60 and a lowbie. Unless the rogue is god awful or attacking someone with double his gear level. In world pvp your victory is a forgone conclusion.
---
To bring peoples delusions crashing down around them.
---
Are you talking about the beta/stress test? Or the full game?
---
Really? It's a 1 in 5. I have seen it multiple times. 
---
But it's really not that big of a deal for a warrior (though it is better for your tanking set than smite's reaver)  and if I were a rogue with a fresh character, I would probably pay basically every copper I had to roll on it unopposed.
---
&gt; For players who have not yet tested World of Warcraft Classic, the game will become available for download late tomorrow, June 18.
---
It's not "late" yet.

no looks like this

Not exactly sure how you define "plenty", I'd be a little amazed if the number was more than a handful.  I saw a single binding drop once in my entire Vanilla raiding experience of having MC on farm for a huge chunk of it, so just guessing based off personal experience.  I did also watch my friend's parents raid where both bindings dropped in the same run and no one knew what they were, so they gave them to like OT # 4.
---
I like buffing/supporting/bardstyle classes. Plus they're great pvp healers.  
---
Also I never got to play one in classic on my first go around; so it seems appealing.
---
Would be easy in switch with an on screen pop-up keyboard.  If they allowed Bluetooth keyboards it would be amazing!
---
This is your pledge of allegiance if you subscribe to /r/freefolk
---
Was talking about raids. And yes, that's how you get the tank spot there as well.
---
I used to do priest with a mage in the Tanaris pirate areas.
---
Trick was we pulled with the priest using PW:S and fear and renew essentially pulling as much as possible.
---
Then when ready the priest runs toward the mage, pops a renew and a PW:S onto the mage. Then leave the group. Let the mage aggro and tag all the mobs and kill them with the frost aoe spells taking healing as required. Meant the mage took all the experience of course but was super fast levelling on the mage.
---
my friend didn't test it.. Didn't even sub yet and his shows up just grayed out.
---
I'm sorry? 
---
They are doing it for free basically, its just lumped in with the basic sub,  hell of a deal really
---
The nice thing about the game, is you can exercise your freedom to choose.
---
You can “choose” to pay to play the game, or you can “choose” not to.
---
It’s an amazing concept that blizzard implemented, the ability to “choose”
---
I'm still learning how to read so... No
---
You seriously think most people are assuming they will get server first 60 and all of the best items that Classic has to offer? And that they need a condescending video like this to set them straight?
---
&gt;opinions are like assholes, in that everyone has one!
---
one of my favourite sayings.
---
1 in 5 of the "Good Tanks"
---
Contrary to popular belief, by the time Naxx was out and eventually the TBC pre-event was launched, there was Rogues and Paladins running around with Thunderfury.
---
8.2 is doing more to level boosting than twinking itself. Twinks still very much exist and will in retail.
---
Dude warriors and druids have rage. Rage incentivizes going faster between pulls in order to preserve as much as you can. Paladins have mana. They are incentivized to go slower so they don't have to drink. There is no way they can go as fast as a warrior or druid.
---
isn't minimum wage like $15 now? just work an hour a week.
---
If you get it yes.
---
How much higher level than the dungeon do you need to be to solo as a hunter?
---
The full game. I'd only play it casually as I dont have much time I can dedicate to it and it's just too steep.
---
Nothing better than watching runner about to aggro the entire zone, casting curse of recklessness, and watch him slingshot back to the tank. You feel like a god damn hero
---
I can never explain my luck for that item. When I finally saw it drop I was running a guild mate (level 15 rogue) through, and of course I wasn't going to take it as it was useless to me at that point. The only positive is that the experience of running VC over and over was I learned how to run a 5-man as a tank and properly LOS, so not all was lost.
---
After the raid if you feel you have been treated unfairly you chalk it up to experience and dont raid with them again. If they have been particularly blatant about it make it known publicly so that others dont get treated the same way.
---
Must be Horde then.
---
As it stands right now, competition for gear and world mats (black lotus, devilsaur leather, etc) will be contest across servers. If we get into a hypothetical scenario where Method (not sure if they are playing classic, but its a reconizable name) is competing for a world first, they will have two specific advantages over a majority of the pack. Knowledge and Dedication. However, layering offers them a third advantage. Name/Guild recognition will drive players to join their server, either to join them, help them, or compete against them. This will drive up the number of players on their home server and therefore drive up the number of potential layers the server will require. If Method uses this to their advantage, they can theoretically throw their players across multiple layers and compete for rare items like black Lotus which will then allow them to have access to more flasks across more players than a similiar guild on a lower pop server. Hypothetically speaking of course.
---
it's supposedly opening up for everyone to download around 5-6pm EST, or PST. one of the two.
---
98% of people won't share this, but my true friends will!
---
That's definitely true, Valley is gonna be PACKED!
---
Not as packed as The Barrens though ^_^
---
So much this, I know when I was tanking in Vanilla and even if I wasn't forming the group I would tell whoever was to not invite any other warrior's, I always upheld the belief that if a warrior wanted to run a dungeon they could simply tank it themselves.
---
Blizzard is also at work at 2pm on a Wednesday. They also enjoy their hobbies on the weekend. 🤔
---

Pretty much anybody who could use it lol
---
I don't have 120k (last time I checked was a month ago) gold in game, haven't played much recently to be able to make that type of gold with the economy inflation in wow
---
I stole it from a friend who is sticking with Live so feel free heh.
---
I agree it's a great deal for people who play BfA already. But for people who don't and are not planning too it's not.
---
I agree, it should be $20, the actual vanilla price adjusted for inflation.
---
No, but I think a good dose of reality is healthy.
---
Y’all seem triggered, I thought the video was kinda funny.
---
Oh, you're that guy from Receiving I used to work with in 2005 @ BestBuy.
---
He once told me that he leveled slowly, because he would level his hunter and warrior one level at a time, and alternate at every level.  He also really enjoyed his "smithing".  He enjoyed it so much he had mining and blacksmithing on both and also kept them at the same level.
---
I stayed away from that dude after that.  He had to be a nut.
---
You're going on a tirade about something only you care about. I have been playing WoW for over a decade and you're literally the 1st person I've ever met who thought no respecs was a good idea. It's sad and pathetic that you resort to calling people casuals because they don't support your ridiculous, terrible idea. I've done progression raiding as an officer/raid leader going back to TBC, and again, not a single person has ever mentioned there should be no respecs. Grow up and get over it.
---
Tell me More...
---
Pretty sure that applies to any game.
---
Any chance to benchmark a Ryzen CPU? I'd like to know how well will it do, considering it has worse single core performance than Intel counterparts.
---
Thanks for the update Chief.
---
I had a ton of class envy in Wrath when playing a warrior.  Warrior was so boring to me compared to every other class.  It was just hitting things with a weapon and literally no cool perks.  That's pretty much why I won't play a warrior again.
---
I don’t think he’s saying play on a PvP server or you suck...he’s more so pointing the finger at the .01% of the people racing for world firsts that won’t even see this.
---
This relates and should matter to no one but those involved.
---
Wish I'd kept my original discs. Still got my BC collector edition box though.
---
Ouch
---
Horde. Easy choice.
---
 Just wait till you're out of school, then.
---
Like you both said though, you can do everything. With one build you can do legit PvP (especially as a WSG FC), tank dungeons, and heal raids. Even if the raiding experience “sucks” I don’t really care, I’ll just be happy to be along for the ride and actually help the group. That’s the stage I’m at with WoW at this point. I think Druid will make me happy for those reasons.
---
Druid isnt for me. Maybe it's better in their 40's but at level 30 it's like you have the tools level 18 Warrior and a Rogue. I didn't like it. 
---
Paladin sucks until level 20, then its actually kind of fun. Seal of Command is like a slot machine, but for some reason waiting for it to proc is fun for me. Going through Duskwood as a Paladin is a unique leveling experience. You really feel the class lore. 
---
Priest was the most fun for me. The efficiency is something I enjoyed. You have zero downtime. I see why some people might be bored by it; Bubble, Smite &gt; Mind Blast &gt; SW:P &gt; wand until dead. It definitely my favorite so far.
---
Even if I dont main a Priest I'm 100% making an alt for one.
---
I had just over 100 days /played when TBC released.
---
That's ~$0.15 cents an hour. You can't even get parking for that.
---
I will test this, but DM me in a week. Won't be with my PC for the next seven days. Just send me a reminder and I'll try to do that on my main system.
---
no time to wife when can wow.
---
i kinda want to join a guild that has no clue about the raids i know some tactics for most raids but never played them in classic i kind want to go through the process of learning seems like it might be more fun and rewarding.
---
Quel is great when you're starting out but quickly falls off.
---
I don't mean to seem like I'm trashing NE Warrior. I'm playing a NE Warrior Tank.
---
I'm just playing the devil's advocate here, Human IS the optimal tank for raiding. It's not a huge deal but it's nice to not have to rely on gear so much to be hit capped if you snag a sword.
---
It's why so many people roll Orc tanks for the axe spec even though Troll is the superior choice for high end progression.
---
OP is dumb, he is a rogue not a warrior. He even stealths.
---
Euronooga
---
My warrior stealths. Just saying.
---
I love you.
---
Sounds like crying
---
Try rebooting or relogging. If that doesn’t work contact customer support. I asked about PTR’s cause there was an issue before where people who had 2 PTR licenses on their account weren’t seeing the beta &amp; stress test.
---
No one ever mentions the biggest fuckin factor!!! :) Health pool sizes/ stat inflation. A fight can be over in 3 seconds in classic. You can legit two shot people in the right circumstances
---
Have you opted in to Classic beta testing in your Account settings?
---
Uvu   g!/
---
I'd take Kobe in sandals over you in jordans
---
For casual play (less than 20 hours a month) I would still consider it worth it.  When you sit and think about how many things cost about $15 like a movie ticket, which only lasts about 2 hours and you basically forget about it later that same day.  
---
I’d say if you play at least once a week for a couple hours it would be worth it. Anything less then I’d reconsider.
---
The Ryzen CPUs will perform better than every CPU I tested except the 6600k and 6100T. I have a 2200G system at home I can test for you though. DM me in a week to remind me, I won't be near my PC for the next week so can't test before then.
---
fuckin cool story dude
---
It's mutual.
---
It's not if I can afford it, because I can. But it's a matter of spending money on this or other things. At that price it's not worth it to me. But if I was a big fan I'd definitely pay it, like I did back in 2004 and 2005.
---
Honestly not every warrior wants to be the Thunderfury warrior, It might be the more visually noticeable weapon of the two early Legendary weapons but I bet there are as many warriors in this subreddit that want to be that first Haus Warrior AFKing on the IF AH bridge or Org Bank Roof being ogled by by every dick, jane, and terry.
---
I played classic and even then I only read the quick objective, but now I’m going to read sentence by sentence. Really makes the world of a difference. Not going to use thottbot, or any quest aids like back in the day or in current retail.
---
"KINGSLAYER! GET IN HERE! We're telling war stories, who was your first PvP kill? Not counting old men."
---
Beta and stress test shows up under WoW Classic: beta &amp; stress test.
---
It's not really. The people who "do what they want to have" are called social guild members. They will fill in when the actual raid members can't fill a raid for the night.
---
And yet some how this comment doesn’t have more upvotes than this post. 
---
This isn’t how this works. This isn’t how ANY of this WORKS!
---
So the current game is $15 and that's fine. Now they bring out a better game and it still only costs $15 a month and you get that shitty retail game with it as well. 
---
So now you get the game you actually want which is a really good game for only $15 a month? I don't see a problem here.
---
Probably the same as BFA. I think it’s using the same client.
---
Not only that but that's 4 other players that are getting to run a dungeon now as well should that Warrior tank.
---
No harm in saying "Hey I'm running this for DPS gear just so people know" they will be greatful to have a Tank.
---
That's good to know. I last raided in Ulduar on this machine but it bogged (a little) down in the Helgen fight in Naxx during the dance.
---
It's actually more important for casual guilds to be in proper specs....
---
I did not write this. Did my post every mention that?
---
I am the developer of Will it Classic and I know many where looking for this so I announced it.
---
But you are right. You have no idea about the author or the routes they chose. That is where you all need to test these things out.
---
Mythic is dropping July 16th, so will only be out just over a month when classic comes out, so not a lot of CEs yet yeah
---
The sky is not falling, but I'm of the opinion that if we don't raise a fuss, it won't all get fixed.
---
I'm curious why you think this client is leaps and bounds ahead of private servers?
---
You really gotta plan two months ahead to download 5 gigs?
---
He has mastered the ability to move so slowly that he is invisible. Confirmed rogue.
---
I you're the only that can take something then I have never seen other people argue that they should get a shot at it as well. Non miners don't roll for nodes and expect the miner to grab it for them either. I feel the same way about locked chests and rogues.
---
Here is the simplest response to your post. If $15 is too much for you, for whatever reason, then just leave. There is no reason to come here and post this message. Few people share your opinion and even if many did, its extremely unlikely that your collective opinions would change the fact. It is literally pointless for you to be here complaining, just pack up and move on.
---
Favorite*
---
*Citation needed*
---
To be fair it should be more than retail its the better game so yha.
---
Anyone who cares about world/server firsts will use every advantage to get them - this won't affect going for firsts other than adding something extra they'll need to be mindful of. Such a tiny fraction of the population will be going for firsts.... I'd rather have a better launch experience than worry about the plight of extremists going for a meaningless achievement.
---
LOL.   HAHAHAHAH.
---
As if most mother fuckers didn't start at that girth.
---
I like it too :D
---
I enjoyed Priest the most. Druid was fun, but at 30 I felt like I was a level 18 Warrior/Rogue. Felt weak. I think I'm gonna have to level it more to give it another chance.
---
Paladin is my second choice of the three so far.
---
Warriors are not only the best endgame tank, but they are also really good endgame DPS.  It's pretty hard to have too many warriors.
---
You are still benefitting from Blizzard's labor without fair compensation. Clear violation of the terms of service.
---
The numbers are basically flagging it for a rename upon logging in. When they freed the name up they changed your character name to include the numbers.
---
That's one way to look at it.
---
Low-key messed up, man :p
---
Played a level 19 rogue twink. Fishing hat and all.
---
It was 100% because I am bad at high level PvP because I don't enjoy jumping and circling.
---
It's not about chain pulling. Paladins can do Strat several packs at a time. You build the group around it.
---
I agree with what you say and am saying Warriors and Druid's are superior.
---
Paladins DO have a niche and they can do it quite efficiently if geared and played well. No different than how a well geared and properly played Druid can MT a lot of raid fights except for like Saph and Lotheb.
---
Has your friend somehow installed the game before? I never tested but had the install (from another friend who installed it on my computer) and it showed up for me the other day. Have your friend uninstall it and see if he has the install option, I would bet he doesnt.
---
I've had music off in WoW for years simply because 90% of it is boring ambient music and I'd rather have...y'know, actual music playing, like in Ragnarok or Maple Story.
---
Most likely EST as it would be 24 hours before the stress test starts
---
Just go druid. No pros or cons, they just do everything but kinda do nothing at the same time. The most vanilla class in all of vanilla wow.
---
GPD WIN 2 anybody? I tried a p-server on a gpd win and i was able to quest and farm without any problem....
---
True if you play so much, it's worth it for you.
---
Its still a great deal,  you don't have to buy the game and the sub price is the same its always been if you don't play bfa
---
Mind if I ask why you hate gnomes?
---
I was giving two examples of playstyles and saying choose one based on your preference. No need to worry about what the other is doing, let alone attack them for doing it. 
---
I agree with your comment, my classic guild will have a casual rair schedule, but proper PvE specs will be required. We dont raid much, but we have to goce our best effort when we do!
---
Level as Fury until you reach the 40's, and then if you want to try out Prot give it a go then, it will still be slower than all hell but at least then you will have all the important and fun things from the prot talent tree to play with.
---
Although I still wouldn't reccomend Prot until you're either 60 or on the final few levels too reach 60 and you want the little bit extra amount of beefiness to do some of the elite quests and dungeons you will be encountering around that level.
---
in the end, no one cares and you're gonna be the one losing out.🤷🏼‍♂️
---
There was Rogues and Paladins running around with them.... 
---
Maybe your server wasn't as competitive? I saw a lot on Black Dragonflight.
---
Stop stealing my ideas!!
---
Nah, that was the expansion with kung fu pandas. That's when the game started to artistically show that it was complete trash at that point.
---
You also have to kill twice as many and you won't kill them twice as fast in a group.
---
So let's say that for some odd reason (and for the sake of this example) every has to wait until week 3 to really start raiding. Players take between 4-7 days to reach max level so week one is kind of out the window. Black lotuses are supposedly on a two hour spawn time, and i'm not sure of the uniqueness of them across the continents/zones but we can overestimate and say that for each zone and continent you'll get 3 spawns per two hour time gate (I'm pure speculating on this, but the numbers don't really matter in terms of my point). This means that across the 8-10 zones they can spawn in (i haven't counted) you can get a total 30 per two hours if you know where every single spawn is, are there on time and in each zone. This comes to a total of 5,040 total Black Lotuses that can be farmed (with max efficiency) before our magical gated raid release. 
---
Now of course, no one is going to be able to farm those at max efficiency, and I'm fairly sure my numbers are way off in terms of their spawn rates. However, the total number of black lotuses that can be farmed before a raid is ready to enter said Raid is very finite. If your guild is on a lower population server your final number of Black Lotuses may very well be that 5K figure. However, for larger guilds who drive population influxes to their home servers, that number is variable based purely on population. so X(5,040) where X is equal to the number of players on your server divided by 3,000 (the layer size).
---
Whether or not this will give them an advantage is speculative, I'll agree. you would need a scenario where your guild knows layer abuse mechanics, and a server full of people who can't compete with your sheer amount of dedication. However, there is an advantage to be gained none the less.
---
Same, my old account appeared on the launcher as an option. When I first logged on it said I had no characters. But then I clicked on the realm my old chars were on and when it took me to the character selection screen, there they were!
---
Smaken är som baken!
---
Dude click targeted then coned in the wrong direction. Probably lost track of where the bug report is.

When designing the paladin class:

Prot: NO TAUNT
---
Ret: NO DAMAGE

I'm sorry, but that's fucking amazing.!!!!!!
---
&gt; Even at 1 hour per night, that's $0.50 per hour. 10x cheaper than one movie a month.
---
Hey.  I'm just wanting to check to make sure I'm understanding.  I'm subscribed to the game and opted-in to the Classic beta.  Am I waiting to see a client download option OTHER than the PTR (e.g., one that says Classic somewhere?) and the live clients?  Meaning, I need to wait until it's "late"r today before I see in the drop-down menu the client I will need for Classic?  
---
Or, is the PTR client the correct one to use for the Classic stress test?  
---
Thanks for your time! :)
---
100% and this is why almost nobody in my guild is interested in classic (I am cuz I want to play an MMO but I get where they're coming from)
---
I'd read a paper titled "The Organic Growth of Death Squads."
---
i always see hunters being rated low in dps for pve and not excelent at pvp either..
---
i really like hunters but i also wanna be competitive.
---
Sorry, bro, I'm totally taking KILLSWITCH
---
I watched like three minutes of the arena championship this weekend.   3v3.  It was just six people running around 2 pillars while two of those players' health bars shifted between full and half full.
---
On one hand I agree with you, because I'm not shooting for a world first. On the other, I understand the point of view from a world top 50 guild who plays on a lower population server trying to out compete APES who have 24K people on their server and acess to 12 unique layers.
---
Made up numbers for empahasis.
---
But there will be new players who might not know the raids
---
2 weeks before release they will open up creation of characters and names, 3 per server, for a total of 50 that you can reserve.
---
If i can get a tank and healer to join easier by offering a summon, i am fine with that
---
They said that there will only ever be one World Boss no matter when layer you're on, I don't see why the can't do the same with resources.
---
&gt;  not enough to ever call more than one player the MT.
---
my whole point is that there wouldnt even be an MT
---
Maybe a pug can let 1 person do all the tanking but seeing as each raid needs multiple tanks to partake in most boss fights, (idk what you mean about nothing in MC or ZG) or why you wouldnt even bothering mentioning the 2 raids with the most tannk swapping
---
Paladins have decent AoE farming and solo-ability.
---
Most guild run PUGs will have a lot of items reserved.  Stay away from these because it just shows they are too inept to fill the roster, and that usually means they aren't fun people.
---
The best PUGs will allow rolls.  The best of the best will allow 1-2 item winning rolls for every boss except the last (such as Rag/Hakkar etc.) and will allow everyone to roll on Ragnaros gear.  This way people actually stay past winning their first piece of loot if there is a wipe.  
---
Above all else avoid guild hosted PUGs that run on DKP.  You are nothing more than an upaid mercenary for a group of shitty people.
---
Cool.  See ya later.
---
I am not fine with it, but I'll endure it because it's better than standing around shouting for a tank.
---
This is actually pretty plausible even though it pains me to admit as a retail raider
---
Ignorant, sure, whatever you need to tell yourself.
---
It’s shit and people like you are creating disappointment
---
Oddly reminds me of Jurassic Park
---
In vanilla you could summon people off cliffs, or trick people with ritual of doom
---
I don’t even see a drop down menu lol. I even installed BFA to see if it would pop up then. Nope. 
---
Shouldn’t be that big of a download though :)
---
Yeah it all depends on how much you value it. For instance a fan of Guild Wars 2 may say that it should be free because GW2 is a better game and is free. Where as you can say that GW2 it crap and Wow is a better game and is worth the sub. I am not saying that objectively for everyone this is a bad deal. No, clearly for many it's good. But there are people like me for whom it isn't.
---
That's my beef with BfA. I skipped out on Cata and MoP and only barely touched WoD which seemed more like an idle game if you spent any time on your garrison. But I did a fair amount of Legion content and although I think the story and content for BfA are pretty good, it's hard to reconcile the fact that I was commanding a spaceship full of alien light goats whilst wielding not one but three artifacts of immense power against the demon responsible for the entire history of the Warcraft story. 
---
Helping Lady Waycrest get her house back from some ghosts seems like small potatoes.
---
Well, Purge doesn't have a cooldown, but could possibly get the shaman to waste a bit of mana on it.
---
Agreed, it's less people than if everyone on the server was together. Layering just won't help with starting zone population as much as sharding would. It'll still be crazy
---
As an example (for everyone else): sharding could have a 50 player limit per zone / area. You would only see up to 50 people in a starting zone. Layering could have a 1000 player limit for the world before a new layer is opened on that server. But all of those 1000 people could be split amongst the same 6 starting zones.
---
Imo it's a good compromise because layering should be less jarring than sharding and help ensure a more stable post-launch server population
---
There is always a Main Tank in every raid. Maybe not for every second of every fight, but for every raid, yes.
---
You no take candle.
---
please confirm if you're trolling; I think you are but i'd like to know if you really are.
---
Versatile classes are the best! Buy I find Pallies a littler boring. :P
---
Skarm Tank on YouTube has his pally MT Hakkar actually. But he basically admits there aren't any raid bosses pally's should MT except for memes
---
Mrglglglglglgl!
---
Real warriors use staffs
---
Sweet welcome to the club I had mine recovered as well at the start of the year BFA is not the game I use to love can’t wait for classic
---
I dunno man I think you're the one behind an illusion. Warriors were always a top DPS spec, that was one of the issues a lot of people had with Classic. The one of the best DPS spec ins the game was also the only tank.
---
You wanna catch these Troll hands?
---
People clearly care enough to downvote me.
---
Sonii (sonydigital) if youre a gay workout bro. No homo
---
Just because it's a 15 year old game doesnt mean it's bad and not worth playing. You should give it a try for a month and see how you feel before writing it off entirely.
---
Why go through all the trouble of shaving your balls if you don't plan to screw after?
---
Oh man. How many tourist players do you think will:
---
* not buy skill ups
---
* not do quests required to obtain certain skills
---
* rage quit at trying to get enough gold for a mount
---
I don't even have that dropdown above my "PLAY" button.  Anyone know why that might be?
---
Some of us have to have the balls to heal and tank so newbs get to press 1, 2, and 3 and shoot magic missiles.
---
TIL: My dad who (rightfully so) was on my ass for the entirety of 05 and 06 for playing "that stupid game too much" is now reading a subreddit related to it.
---
ME BUSY! LEAVE ME ALONE!
---
Right, unless you rather watch one movie.
---
As someone who will be participating in 40 man raids and hates waiting on unnecessary stuff there's really no need for anyone on a built PC or even a laptop to not be using a SSD.
---
If you aren't broke enough to pay $15 a month to play the game you can afford $60 to put the game on a cheap SSD.
---
**For the love of god please.**
---
The switch is touch screen so you could literally just press them. Plus outside of pvp and other more serious content, vanilla doesn’t require much moving while in combat. Would be totally playable for basic leveling/crafting/checking the AH/etc.
---
Unfortunately people who wish to get geared in the first year.
---
Nope.  There's just so much quest text and I've read most of it before.  It's mostly just flavor text for you to go out and kill some boars or whatever.  
---
"The furbolgs, troggs, centaurs, bears, raptors, trolls, dwarves, venture co., etc. have invaded this part of the zone.  Why don't you go over there and kill them/their leader/steal supplies/save our captured friends/etc.
---
Since it’s only when he stands still it sounds more like shadowmeld. He can even eat while doing it.
---
Honor among thieves.
---
I just felt like having a conversation. I am certainly not looking to change anything. If you dont like it, my advice is downvote and move on.
---
This. I ended up replacing the sounds with a muted version.
---
honestly, i think Morhaime (and a few others) knew the gig was up, and they executed their exit strategy ... the completion of the Warcraft storyline. there's really no further worlds left to conquer.
---
they left right after Overwatch, Hearthstone, and Legion peaked; Diablo was on ice, Starcraft was in maintenance mode, and it was pretty clear HotS was an also-ran in the MOBA space.
---
Most healing specs only give you about 10% healing, Mana conservation, and some cool ability or two. You can heal in offspec just fine, except maybe in endurance or healing intensive raid fights. Even then, as long as most of your healers are spec for raid, you'll be fine
---
" Reason being, with me being a full on geezer with family and work, time will be limited as I do strange shifts and guold raiding will possibly be a struggle for me "
---
Sure, just dont expect to main tank for raids. maybe a fill-in offtank depending on availability/reliability
---
At least blizzard didn't forget about that like they did for Nature damage
---
*cries in Ele shaman*
---
Red is dead
---
I'll admit that rolling a rogue totally changed my personality, pretty much as you described. I became an asshole immediately.
---
That said, I don't ascribe to the red = dead mentality. I use a rule I call "Out of place".
---
For example, if I'm a level 40 rogue in a level 40 zone and I see a level 40 guy, we're all supposed to be there so he's fair game.
---
If I'm a level 60 rogue in a level 40 zone and I see a level 40 guy, I'll leave him alone. He's supposed to be there, and I'm not.
---
But if I'm on a level 40 rogue in a level 40 zone and I see a level 20 wandering around, I'll one shot him. He's out of place, and he took the risk of coming into the zone.
---
Spriest, mage, warlock
---
Isn't Nerubian Slave Maker (I think its called) pretty solid overall?
---
Hunters just scale poorly with gear iirc.
---
Yep and I'll gladly give u my food and water for it 🤣
---
If you spend a decent amount of time not casting SB to avoid pulling agro, would it be roughly equivalent dps to go affliction so you could have the +hit talents and other affliction perks?
---
Not my first play through, but definitely every playthrough after it.
---
I am not. I'll probably delete this post, people are getting a bit more upset than I expected.
---
I think some rogues think of themselves as invincible just because they can stealth and get an opening move on other players. This “code of honor” bullshit is meaningless when one encounters an alert player that knows how to duel. Rogues aren’t the toughest class to beat 1v1 and they should really get a reality check.
---
Perhaps so. But not a thief.
---
Are u artistic dude? Ah I misspelled
---
Yes you should be able to in theory.
---
TBC is my favorite period of WoW, but the questing experience in Wrath was definitely better. Outlands was definitely a bit of a mess.
---
I mean.. Daggers are fantastic for tanking. A 1.3 speed dagger like Finkle's or Alcor's are absolutely fantastic. You basically have infinite rage, which means you can spam Heroic Strike on every single swing. It being a yellow hit, and not white, means it pushes glancing blows off the table. It's the best way to generate threat, especially in raids.
---
It would help a bit but would probably hurt your rate of exp more than it would help.  
---
The paladin won't be able to do much though, aside from consecration which is a bad mana -&gt; damage coefficient.  He can heal you a lot, and BOP, and blessing of wisdom or kings which certainly helps.  And he can tank or heal dungeons helping you get into those. 
---
40+ the paladin can actually do the pull and gather some mobs for you.. Below 40 he could still gather some but is just slow as well and has no range ability.
---
Did somebody say [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker](https://www.wowhead.com/item=19019/thunderfury-blessed-blade-of-the-windseeker)?
---
I can see it not affecting other people's immersion. But it did for me. Especially for faces. Haircuts yeah maybe but it wouldn't sense to be bald one day and a rock star the next.
---
I played back in Vanilla days. Private servers as well not so long ago.
---
 So your argument here is "Hey, you're a gun owner, why aren't you shooting everyone"?
---
I don't plan on ganking lowbies, but I'd make an exception for you.
---
I gave you a +1 just because FUCK ARCHEAGE.
---
I guess if you go all out with thistle tea and all cooldowns every time you open on someone. But as a whole I don't disagree, well said haha
---
First time for me I can play WoW maxxed out, ULTRA.. As a 15-17yo kid I only had a potatoo pc for that time
---
Only to form groups, I think the UI is fantastic. I agree that teleporting to the dungeons is a bad idea.
---
No kidding. The Crescent Staff from the WC quest or the Staff of Westfall from the DM quest could easily carry you to level 30 when you can get the Whirlwind Axe (with some help).
---
I mean I see what you're saying, but you're not feeling that fire like the rest of us then. Shit I'd prob drop 20$ a month.
---
You can raid as a out of battle resser.
---
He has chosen not to pay.
---
Agreed. Howling Fjord had such fitting music I loved it.
---
First release had 5 then it went to 6 after updates. ( I believe )
---
Don't forget the addon, "And yours is full of shit."
---
Tomorrow the test won’t even be available until 3 PDT “I think” which is in like 25 1/2 hours ish..
---
Wait until 3 PDT today and maybe it’ll be available to download 24 hours or so before it is available
---
That's the rule I use as well. Didn't think anyone else did this.
---
I could have TF and id still gank lowbies if your not my faction fuck you
---
this os reddit those people are stupid, they downvote anything and everything they dont agree on instead of holding a discussion. they live for this stuff. I didnt downvote it, but I think your comment is irrelevant.
---
it's like saying you dont want to pay 5 dollars for a sandwich and everyone else will be more than happy to give those 5 dollars cause the new sandwich sucks and the old one was way better.
---
Last I hear they were pretty clear about not having RP PVP servers at launch, which is a shame, because they always have the best communities.
---
Cool story bro, but really why?
---
What does your plan look like? Here is my _current_ plan:
---
* Hunter with skinning and herbalism
---
* Druid with enchanting and leatherworking
---
* Priest with alchemy and tailoring
---
I'll start with the hunter and send leather, herbs, and cloth to the other guys. My hope is to have so many materials that my crafting professions will always be far ahead of that characters level so I can make the most use of everything.
---
Then when all 3 of these hit 60 I will drop skinning and get mining on the hunter and start a warrior with engineering and blacksmithing. Probably all done by Thanksgiving ... 2021 lol
---
While I have every intention of ganking lowbies and probably even corpse camping, I don't agree with this:
---
&gt; You chose to pick a class who's entire motif is that your an ass hole
---
Rogues make great bodyguards. That's not being an asshole.
---
Rogues open chests, doors, and boxes. That's not being an asshole.
---
Rogues disarm traps (important in BWL) so others can pass through safely. That's not being an asshole.
---
If I were an NPC, I'd rather be temporarily knocked out with no permanent damage than turned into a sheep, frozen in a block of ice or entangling roots, struck with terror, or losing complete control of my mind. That's not being an asshole.
---
If I were an NPC in BRD. I'd rather my enemy stealth about, stealing our Dark Iron ore and looting our pockets, than outright killing us. That's not being an asshole.
---

He is moving!
---
What kind of conversation were you expecting?
---
Weapon skills are the best thing they ever took out of Wow. It brings nothing of positive, only negative.
---
How much INT is typical on most gear at say 20-30. I'm wondering how much INT you give up for +61 Spellpower.  
---
If you're really doing 30% extra damage on frostbolt, you need an extra 3 casts of an INT build for every 10 casts from a Spell power build, to do the same amount of damage, aka 13 casts. So at 15 mana per 1 INT and a cast cost of 65 for the level 4 spell (Correct me if I'm wrong) you just need 5 INT for 1 extra cast so, 15 INT for an extra 3. Granted your damage output and time to kill will be slower - 2.6 seconds per cast but you'll have managed to keep up with the damage output (26 seconds vs. 33.8 seconds) .  Is my math totally off there? 
---
So the question really becomes how much mana do you need to burn down these mobs and how much benefit is burning them down faster vs. slower, is there a lot of risk to drinking and eating downtime with either build... plus a ton of other variables.  But I do see the merit in INT.  I wish we had more definitive numbers.
---
This post literally makes no sense. “It’s not that I can’t afford it it’s just that I don’t value it like others who like the game “ is basically what your saying. You could say this aboutttttt ANYTHINGGGGGGG
---
I don’t value steak as much as most people so I can’t justify spending $25 on a good cut. But people who love steak can absolutely justify it.
---
So in essence cool story bro
---
Skill can't make up for class limitations in the game like that im afraid. The best moonkin in the world would do less than half the dps of me playing a rogue or mage.
---
Only if dispel deals damage =)
---
I've played up to 20 on both factions on a private server, read all the quest descriptions. I really enjoyed it, but when I leveled with a friend it become a hassle and started just reading the objectives.
---
Sharding and layering and phasing were what started to ruin the game for me in WotLK. I remember several quests I needed help with and fellow players couldn't assist because they couldn't get to the version of the zone I was in. It's cool to see that progression but with cross-realms it just got worse and worse. I miss the days when you could see the crowd in front of the AH in IF (and worry it might crash your machine) - when barrens chat was full - etc. 
---
I understand why they want to do this for server loads on launch - they'll have totally different challenges than on the original launch, but as soon as we can get back to one server = one world, the better
---
Can somebody tweet this at McConnell and make sure he knows about this?
---
I'm gonna read them when I get the feeling it's part of a fun chain
---
In 1.12, at least.
---
Back in 1.1 they were buff bots in raids because 5-minute single-target blessings. And their damage output was even worse, leading to the infamous post about Paladin being the porn-browsing class.
---
If you move the images in a little bit you can put a red and blue banner around the factions, or something to sort of break it up a bit.
---
I know what you mean. I used to feel that fire as well.
---
There’s obviously a big difference between ganking people around your level and ganking lowbies. If you’ve ever outplayed a ganking rogue you should know this
---
Holy shit this sub is fixated with streamers, you really love em do you
---
Question: How do guilds handle Warriors on 4 Horsemen. Need 8 equipped tank warriors ... who has that? Yea there was poaching etc, but ... did they just have 8 full time tanks? Throughout all of Naxx? Sub some in and out? Cough up the 100g per no longer needed tank to respect for the fight (and back after)?
---
I don't think layer hopping will be as easy as this thread seems to believe.  I think finding which layer you're on, how many layers exist,finding 10-15 players PER LAYER to cover all the BL spawn points, etc will put a big damper on this sort of farming.  That said, your premise is sound, but I question the realism a bit.  World first Ragnaros is entirely based on who gets 40 players to level 60 first.  Method-level players don't need the more expensive consumables to down Rag and almost all gear farming is dungeon-based, so who gets more Black Lotus or devilsaur leather is completely irrelevant.  I'd expect the server firsts to largely follow the same pattern.
---
I can't betray the Horde.  Alliance is just so boring to me.  But, I will be rolling a druid which I've never really played besides a boost to 90? to level to 100 in WoD and quitting immediately after hitting max.
---
I gave you both a +1 because that beta was so damn good!... Then it released.
---
Same - just want to have fun on the journey.
---
Nah, even just facing the bosses as it moves around would be a bit of a challenge on mobile. God forbid if you have to reposition or deal with adds.
---
The main advantage of leveling is that you don't really care if you play poorly.
---
It always just made sense to me. I'm in the game to have fun, and pvp is a part of that fun. But there's no pvp when someone shits on a toon 20 levels below them.
---
Depends on what you define as bad. If you can avoid dying and press your 2 or 3 button rotation then that’s all you need on a good class to outperform any bad spec like moonkin or shadow priest, regardless of how ‘good’ they are.
---
If you want to define bad as ‘dies to boss mechanics’, sure, but then you might as well say “bad class good player &gt; good class dead player.”
---
Probably different? You just fought hogger in that video. In the stockades.
---
There are times where you can play the edges and focus a target during the zerg. I wouldn't go into the center of it all; you'll get focused down.
---
Thank Christ you let us know, we can all sleep at night now.
---
Nope... Just humor
---
What's the problem with FS windowed?
---
Ret Paladins rotation was on a priority queue - always changing depending on the circumstance. A cast sequence macro would work but this addon dynamically changed the skills as needed. Far better output.
---
Less then an hours work irl for me so when classic drops if i play the game for more then 2hours a months its worth it for me i cant say the same about you as i dont know your currecy financial situation but 15 to me is next to nothing and im not a rich guy either
---
haven’t watched him in probably 6 years but Athene is a narcissist man-baby. he was pretty good and honestly kinda funny but nowhere near what he said himself
---
like someone else said he was just a memelord
---
Killed! By a Pig!
---
Beating a rogue who opens on you in the open world is one of the most satisfying feelings in the game, and one of the reasons I play on PVP servers.
---
He saw me, he decided he could take me out, and I proved him wrong.
---
Well now we're talking about preference. You'd rather watch a movie than play WoW. Either because you don't know how good WoW is or it's just not your type of game. If that's the truth, then there's really no price that would make WoW worth it for you to play.
---
BfA kinda seems like a good wrap-up almost. Showing that with the Legion's end, the cycle will remain unbroken and it will always remain a World of Warcraft. 
---
Of course, as long as people keep playing, they'll keep up with new content. I just feel like it will only get wacky from here.
---
I'd love to see something new. I still wish I could play a World of Starcraft
---
Yeaway!

Only one person or party can tag a mob

I may end up doing that.  I think in TBC I replaced the gun sounds with the bow sound.
---
Then rerolled druid because my friend was on a different server/faction and it didn't matter.
---
You mean sick leave?
---
Absolutely not my mate, as I say I'm not expecting to be a main tank due to job responsibilities as a paramedic. I'm just hoping to be able to fill in my spare time on the game I used to thoroughly enjoy to the max.
---
I mean, unless you have a super old computer, it shouldn't be a problem. I built my current computer in 2015, with mostly cheap 2013-2014 parts, and it runs Classic perfectly fine, 1440p with mostly maxed settings, and I always sit at 60fps.
---
Not great, not terrible.
---
&gt; If I'm a level 60 rogue in a level 40 zone and I see a level 40 guy, I'll leave him alone. He's supposed to be there, and I'm not.
---
There isn't a contested zone in the game where a level 60 rogue couldn't come up with a legitimate reason for being there.
---
😀
---
&gt; Ganking a lowbie or Ganking a 60 whats the difference? You start from invisible and aren't going to lose either way. Who are you trying to impress here?
---
That's a scrub quote if I've ever seen one.
---
RIGHT!? Easily one of the most exciting betas and early releases I've ever played. I bought the pre-release pack for like $100.
---
Then the game released. They repackaged the pre-release pack for $40. I've never felt so betrayed by a game company.
---
Then the zillion bots flooded the game.
---
They're half the reason I'll never pre-order another game as long as I live. (The other half was EverQuest Next: Landmark).
---
I remember Fury warriors loved offhand daggers for the fast rage build. At least that's what they told me when i asked why they were rolling on my dagger.
---
Oh man, I feel you but I think that one is a no brainer. Make both. Level the mage first. It’s fast, easy, and not dependent on gear. It’s also a better farming character. Then you can use it to funnel gold to the warrior alt. The rest xp and green gear will make leveling the warrior a breeze (comparatively).
---
Wise tip, teach us more.
---
I came back once for a boost to max level offer thing they had and I don’t think I gave it more than two hours. (Never got max level back in the day and it felt like cheating)
---
Ahh ok. My bad
---
There are some guides on how to make a bunch of gold pretty quickly.
---
Seems to me like they’re taking an incremental approach to it. This should bring in more players than the last one while still allowing it to grow for future stress tests. Always sucks to be excluded but I think that all regions will be included in future stress tests.
---
$15 a month is chump change and i'm not super rich or anything. there's a lot other shit i waste money on that wouldn't give me nearly the value classic would, but I've had a wow subscription for a long time anyway. just avoid getting lunch one day a month and it pays for itself. i don't see how $15 is a make-or-break it deal when it comes to not being able to buy other things because you have to spend $15 a month. I spent 400 a week on day care alone.
---
My ass, they're amazing. Glad to see them back. Walk on back to r/Wow
---
PVE server?
---
Could be awesome, but the first one was just so great that id hate for the second one to be a letdown
---
Sounds like you’ve done a good personal cost/benefit analysis and decided you don’t think Classic WoW will deliver $15 worth of benefit a month in the form of entertainment.  If that’s your conclusion, good on you for choosing to act appropriately and not pay and participate in it.
---
For me personally I think the entertainment value I’ll get is worth many times more than $15 a month.  But we’re all individuals with different tastes, circumstances, and opinions, so you do you.
---
Lol as if there is an option. No arrows in classic so you 100% will ahve to read some part of the quest.
---
That was such a dumb statement from him. Fire mages literally could not deal any fire damage to most bosses at the beginning. Thats why they were not a thing.. its not discrimination against them. smh
---
Ever heard that saying... "trust, but verify"?
---
Erm
---
\#NoChanges?
---
But leveling is awful training for anything in Vanilla. Nothing is intuitive. Nothings going to tell you "Only spam this single spell" or how to heal or tank decently.
---
Vanilla has massive flaws that are really giant timesinks designed to maintain subscription time, yet people don't think of them like that. But when there's a rep grind in retail it's exploitative.
---
My lower right button says preparing to download. Is that BFA or classic, can't tell
---
a lvl 19 to press like 2 buttons?
---
The upcoming test (tomorrow I think) is open to anyone with an active sub and you can level to 15 I believe.
---
It's because they're modern players, I suspect. Most of the game was about the grind. I remember soloing mobs in the cauldron for weeks from 58-60 on a holy Paladin to get those last few levels, catching BRD groups when I could for the XP and maybe a piece of tier 0.
---
It was the quests, the group's, the socialization, and the farming to get that next incremental upgrade or crafting skill up where gameplay happened. The world PvP with four 40s beating a 60 who tried to Hank one of them. The slow methodical murder and sacrifice of neutral AH access in Booty Bay to grind rep with the Pirates...
---
Hi I plan on tanking. I will be an orc warrior called Eztac on an EU Pvp server. 
---
Ps I will be one of the bad tanks but as long as we are having fun that's the important part.
---
Maybe with practice I will be a good tank
---
It’s so easy to downvote an idiot that I don’t think it’s a good gauge of somebody’s level of care.
---
What about Priest did you like?
---
There can be, but retail added class complexity in exchange for resource management.
---
In the exact same boat
---
I remember trying to level a Warri in classic. It was really shitty solo. Many mobs stand in groups (so you cannot solo kill) and you don't have CC.
---
Unlucky streaks of Parry/Dodge/Miss could quickly cause you lots of distress, the AoE fear was a dangerous oh shit button as it could pull more mobs, you're very gear dependant but not gonna have BiS while leveling (unlike beta server, where people had plenty time at 30 and now 40 to farm up, get whirlwind axe early, farm money to buy upgrades off the AH, have streamer fanboys send you money and gear...) and you weren't really tanky before plate, making the whole mob groups without CC story even worse.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
I tried in classic, it was a struggle. And it wasn't because I was terrible. It's not like a lvl20 Warrior has that much leeway to be played terribly with the amount of abilities and rage at your disposal (especially when your first 3 hits are dodged/parried/miss)
---
Only for people in the US
---
Traque and ohhgee have some really informative vids to help you get better as well as some pretty crazy montages that show their skill
---
"If you don't play exactly how I do, something bad will happen to you."
---
Yeah I only got it because it had a free level 90 that I could use to actually play the WoD leveling content.  I skipped MoP and only bought the expansion to level a panda to ~15 (waste of money) so I didn't have a 90 to play.  I haven't played in Legion or BfA at all though.
---
Raid gear should only be replaced by new raid gear, not some random drops. EQ was able to do that pretty well.
---
Apparently they will, soon™
---
Someone in management here. 
---
Don't expect we don't know. And don't be surprised when some of us don't show up either.
---
people are going to be stuck in the starting zone for the whole stress
---
&gt; is open to anyone with an active sub
---
In NA/Oce regions, my fellow EU bros still don't have access.
---
Well kinda, sharding is used in a different way in retail than layering is on vanilla. Sharding was retails answer for dead low-pop servers to play with other people on highpop realms.  
---
Also for server stability, blizzards servers should be able to handle classic without problems if they keep the server pop close to what they originally had.  
---
Sharding wasnt really used to make zones LESS populated, but more or less push people together kinda like layering but much more aggressive phasing.
---
I fail to see how giving players more freedom to explore the game in different ways is detrimental to their experience
---
300 people is a point of reference, not an absolute, assuming 100 is the max. I'm not sure if absolutes have been stated anywhere by blizzard but if they have I doubt it's in the thousands. 
---
Your description is sort of what im saying though, but from a bottom up perspective instead of a top down one. Think if it as having 15 Gallons of water and a 10 gallon bucket. After you put 10 gallons in that bucket, you pull in another 10 gallon bucket ant put the additional 5 gallons in. Let's say you get 7 more gallons. Fill the second and get a third filled with the remaining two. So on and so forth. 
---
Sharding is completely different, since it involves multiple servers. Sharding is used to populate areas that are sparse. If your in a main city you're probably seeing mostly players from your realm. Go to a sparse zone like Felwood and you'll probably see players from other realms. This is sharding in action.
---
This is awesome. It’s exactly the kind of tool I was looking for. Thank you
---
A downvote and an insult? Seems like you care more than most.
---
That's how I remember doing it with a full group sometime in wotlk and I doubt they changed it somewhere along the line. 
---
As long as you time it and press it at the same time everyone gets credit.
---
Move? \*shrug\*
---
It's only $15.  Tell her to play when it comes out and if she likes it she likes it.  
---
If she winds up not wanting to play the game and needs to be convinced then just let it go.
---
This philosophy will be the most annoying part of classic imo. Min/max elitism will be annoying as hell
---
Okay I actually like this post, but isnt the real question who in the actual f*ck uses light mode on reddit?
---
No offense
---
I think that getting 40 players to 60 first is definitely a good chunk of the race. However... most guilds/hardcore players are going to have similiar level times I would assume. So I personally believe that things such as BIS/consumables will give guilds a clear advantage.
---
As for the ease of abusing layer hopping. It's really as simple as communicating with other people on your server and determining that if you are in the same general area and don't see eachother, you are on separate layers. Then the person who is on the desirable layer just needs to invite the other person. 
---
I think Method went into large debt promising gold for "free items" so something similiar could be done with mats either by letting Method players get access to them, or simply benefiting from the fact that there are double, triple, quadruple the spawns of things because of layering.
---
Well I'll do my best
---
400 on daycare is actually  not bad at all.
---
Lots of private servers let you sit to activate enrage. So it gets a 100% uptime. Even on the beta you can abuse batching to get it up 100% of the time.
---
So is PVE gear best in slot for PVP?
---
Support hybrid class = less dps and more emphasis on utility.
---
This looks like the very structure that Uldum is based on in vanilla.
---
Ah that's right, I remember reading that somewhere.  Thanks!
---
I mean have you ever seen a rogue start a world pvp he's going to lose? It's the truth. Sorry if I hurt your feelings lol.
---
Shoot him in the face!
---
Haha levelling as prot ??
---
Zug Zug
---
Totally irrelevant to the discussion, the peons aren't just "mobs" they are NPCs that you use an item on. There's a small window after the item is used that others can use it during and get credit.
---
People prefer TBC for similar reasons as to why people want Classic. It was more or less an improved version of Vanilla, but it still had that same slower paced, RPG adventure feel. The social structure was still intact for pretty much every realm. Wrath is when population drift 1st started getting out of control imo, along with high end guilds xffering to smaller realms to steal server firsts.
---
The raids and the content surrounding them(attunements, rep requirements, etc) were much more interesting than in Wrath. Ulduar was one of the best raids ever, but ICC was just "good" and the rest were flops. TBC also had arguably the best 5 man dungeons in WoW's history, with heroics having meaningful difficulty.
---
The reward systems were better as well imo. The progression was pretty much linear for the most part, at least until 2.4 when they added a bunch of catch-up gear. Getting tier gear was still significant, as there was only 1 difficulty for each raid. You could either do BT, or you couldn't. No different raid sizes, no hard modes.
---
Professions were also really useful and interesting, and in my opinion the best they've been. Frozen Shadowweave set, BS'ing weapongs, engineering items, etc. 
---
And like you said, it also had the closest thing to class balance that Blizzard can manage to find, while still having classes be unique. 
---
Obviously it comes down to preference at the end of the day, but there are a lot of things to like about TBC. It was a pretty unique expansion when you look at what came before and after.
---
What kind of entitled communism are you smoking here? It's just a name. Not even your actual name is reserved for you alone. 
---
If you can't think of a single name that no one else on your server's faction will reserve in the 10 minutes it takes to download the client, how the fuck do you get through life so paralyzed by the fact that every idea you've ever had has been had by someone before you?
---
I wish I could get it up 100% of the time...
---
15 min buffs, takes less than 30 seconds to buff all classes in a 40 man.
---
CoT over ZF. The architecture is not Mayan at all
---

Thanks for the tip. Was planning on going full prot.
---
Check out his twitch or discord, should be easy to find if you Google it
---
If something is hard to achieve, achieving it feels better. In other words: If you're forced to spend 50g to respec, it's going to feel a lot more meaningful and you're going to put a lot more effort into making it worth the money. 
---
Let me be hyperbolic for a moment: Do you think we should be able to teleport wherever we want in Azeroth, whenever we want? If not, why should we not have the "freedom to explore the game in different ways"?
---
BFA patch for later this month.
---
I guess it's possible the rogue could lose however. You ever seen a rogue open up on someone in world pvp when he might lose? No they wait until you are attacking mobs or until you sit to eat and, they can get that crit.
---
Why would it be bad? I'd love to hang out on the couch with my wife and "watch" a movie/show while farming mats or farming mobs. Not to mention it would be badass to take it with you on a road trip and use it wherever you go.
---
I'd say classic pvp is a lot like Rock, Paper, scissors, Where some classes literally can't beat other classes. And Retail is more like a chess match, they have had 15 years to try and balance classes in pvp and for the most part they have done a pretty decent job.
---
Go for it my mate, best of luck 😊
---
This logic is hilarious.
---
Absolutely 😂
---
It looks like the place where the Holy Grail is housed in Indiana Jones.  /s
---
Wtf are you talking about? I just want a silly name for my gnome, like Bob or Billy. I think everyone should have equal chances. If you disagree with that you’re a fucking moron
---
Warlocks are crap, just a watered down mage. Just play mage instead. Their tons of abilities is just fluff to make the player feel better. And don’t get started on soul shard storing and farming. Enjoy getting ganked 
---
Don’t play a lock play a mage or something else
---
i always thought it was just his band of blood elves
---
Yes. All your statement told me was "I'm incapable of beating a rogue, and have a 3s reaction time".
---
After reading all the responses, I am sure I didn't actually hit rank 14, I just bought the gear when the honor system changed. My Paladin's name was Vindicus, but I renamed him Frasier at some point. What guild was your friend in?
---
casually explained is a great channel
---
Nah to be honest I will level as arms or maybe fury, could not decide yet. Leveled as prot in 2005 and I know the pain, so I won't do it again. But I will respecc around 55 to prot.
---
They don't want login queues and they don't want to merge servers because they want people that started on lets say Mal'ganis realm to stay on that realm. If they merged servers there's also the issue of who gets to keep their name if there happens to be same named characters on two merging servers.
---
They answered this question in multiple interviews and Q&amp;As.
---
The last interview which was john hight and omar. They said it was being considered for large regions.
---
okay this is getting away from my point and that was PUGs are not gonna care about your guilds main tanks gear progresssion.
---
Looks more like that FFA map from Overwatch
---
How do i download the client?
---
Personally i prefer imp grounding totem but that is up to each person. 
---
For the remaining 6 i prefer -10% mana cost on shock/bolts then 1 point into greater earthbind range (makes soloing elites a bit easier when you need to kite), but you can also go 5/5 against pushback on the resto tree if you prefer to PvP more
---
I have been looking for the answer to that for an hour now. Commented so we can both get an answer
---
What bullshit.. Firemage? Srls? Fire is just the best Dps class in the game, wow. Your so off meta. AQ is clearable with whatever the fuck you play but cmon you don't belive "at a similar pace" do you actually? There isn't a "small" difference in dps, it's quite literally double. ppl can decive to play their character to be the absolut best for their role or to be the absolut worst and they will still clear everything. **Not** in the same pace though
---
Depends on what layer you’re on.
---
I don't disagree. Can get a 240GB SSD for $40 or so these days easily. But for older systems using an HDD, I just advised that it is "fine" to use an HDD.
---
Im not maining a healer without deul spec. Hybrid specs don't work for me because I want to easily switch between restoration and enhancement
---
There are plenty of reasonable comments here. Also a discussion about the economics of Blizzard's decision could have been interesting. At any rate, too many people are getting upset so I will go ahead and delete the post.
---
The point is the organizer can make whatever the fuck rules they want. Stay, and you abide by them.
---
I’d say Indiana Jones.
---
Booming Voice is great, the extra duration helps with uptime and rage efficiency and the extra range helps get everybody in your group, nice for out questing or building extra threat when tanking if that range helps you hit the casters.
---
Piercing Howl is nuts, it can be used defensively to run away from packs or to quickly snare mobs just out of melee range that are about to run into enemy packs. It can be used offensively in pvp to keep players in range.
---
Imp BS is just more attack power, nothing wrong with that.
---
Imp Execute is great in pvp, decent out soloing.
---
Enrage is an insane dps buff if you're not HS kiting.
---
DW is a really underappreciated coaoldown.
---
Imp Intercept is nuts in pvp.
---
Imp Slam is the basis of 2hfury, with a swing timer and careful use it will do more damage/rage than mortal strike against mobs.
---
And where many arms talents (Imp Overpower, Deep Wounds, Sweeping Strikes, MS) are all dependent on a fat 2hander to be worthwhile, and wep specs are even more narrow in needing an exact weapon type, all of the fury talents (except Imp Slam) are equally good 2hander, DW, or sword and board.
---
Don't get me wrong Arms is great too, but Fury has a lot to offer.
---
Dont forget in the settings menu you can turn on instant quest text so you dont have to wait for it to load through like its being written out.
---
Oops a day too late.
---
[Wait til you see this Naxx40 Cthun from 2006](https://i.redd.it/bon7cnk3l8131.jpg).
---
Notice any "non-optimal specs" in there? They seem to have pulled their weight.
---
Its probably the most efficient class in the game in terms for downtime. Its not the fastest leveler, but as long as the enemies aren't higher level than you, you never have to eat or drink. I guess I'd rather have longer fights than more downtime. Thats what I like the most.
---
I can see how someone might find it boring, but not taking no damage and then regening your mana after a kill with Spirit Tap is super satisfying for me.
---
okay and if you read the OP it says how can he be sure its fair. and im saying its not because they are gonna choose to gear up people, especially there main tank.
---
Awesome customizable party and raid frames!
---
What if it cost 100 gold to get into a raid? Every time you needed a 100g mat from a vendor right outside.
---
It sure would make raid nights more meaningful, as only the most hardcore grinders would be able to regularly do the content. You'd have to work together with your guild to pool the 4000k every night, and have some reserves in case you need to pug people.
---
Think of all the social interaction it creates! It stimulates the economy and makes people really have to *play the game* to experience all the content.
---
Blizzard checks what you have installed on your system and can/did ban for having cheap or other game altering apps present (+ the recent texture replacement drama). They also have honeypots in the game and other things. They don't really disclose things for obvious reasons. That's why Blizzard really wants to be installed on the PC from which you play. With streaming platforms they are only left with honeypots and monitoring a character activity for to precise patterns which isn't easy/efficient.
---
were you leveling with 2h? i used to DW till like 30 (31?) when you get 31 points and switch to arms for MS. cruelty-&gt;unbridled wrath-&gt;enrage-&gt;flurry with piercing howl on the way. 
---
leveling my first warrior was very hard but that's because he was also my char and i have no gear. i was also learning the game. i never wasted rage on trying to kite and stuff. just charge in and hit em hard. eat when i needed to. 2nd one was much easier. also helped they buffed rage generation as it was shit when the game just came out.
---
yea, it's actually actually a little more (42/day) with 2 kids @ 5 days a week, but they do a lot of cool activities and field trips, plus they feed them themselves instead of asking us to pack lunches every day. it's actually hard to find a good day care--we went through 3 of them before we landed on one.
---
Yeeeeee boiii
---
I raided in the burning crusade and my guild legit wiped for at least a month straight on bloodboil in black temple. 
---
4 nights a week 4 hours a night. 
---
That boss legit killed our guild and our guild had been raiding together since gruuls lair and karazhan.
---
WAR and the Archage Beta did for me. Both those games have a similar history though, they changed a few key of things from beta &gt; release, then fired a bunch of staff and failed to put out any end game content in a reasonable time.
---
Well, I forgot or learned that factions have separate rankings, as I was horde, I just knew that our side was competitve as hell, and I remember that alliance had instant queues when we were waiting 10 to 20 mins. Nevermind then.
---
Why do you call them gold sellers when you're talking about people buying characters
---
Life is never equal or fair. Get over it.
---
Really?
---
Literally
---
I think it should be possible to ignore a chunk of it in the game. For all the people trying to rush to 60 there will be lots of people just discovering classic for themselves and if the game does well there will be more of them than the min maxers.
---
As long as the server doesn't crash down on him before he dies.
---
He obviously rubbed you the wrong way, but why are you asking us this question if you don’t want the opinions of others? We cannot decide what this is worth to you. Some would pay hundreds, a few maybe would even play thousands, most would pay 15, some wouldn’t pay at all. How much it’s worth in your eyes may vary. Anyways, it’s 51 hours of game time not 24. Pay the $15 if you want to have access for 51 hours or don’t. We can’t tell you how to spend your money.
---
Everyone has the chance at the stress test tomorro
---
also its unclear if you would need to download a new client anyway
---
You’re right achieving something that is hard makes it feel better. But when you’re flicking between specs, you’re not achieving anything so it doesn’t matter how much effort you put into it, the outcome is joyless
---
US only
---
The stress test only lasts 48 hours so uhhh good luck!
---
I just came back for the first time in many years and some servers that I have characters on have them listed like this. It must have been a wave that they did at some point for characters that hadn't been logged on in a certain amount of time.
---
I *always* say “this time I’m going to read every quest text.”
---
Yeah that doesn’t last long.
---
Yes imp OP is a nice talent, yes cruelty is a nice talent. There isn't a huge difference between fury/arms while levelling.  
---
Arms  
---
* Imp OP
---
* Sweeping Strikes
---
* Weapon spec
---
* Mortal Strike
---
Fury  
---
* Cruelty
---
* Enrage
---
* Deathwish
---
* Flurry  
---
Arms is probably better in most situations mainly because a slow weapon works so nicely with WW and MS and imp 2er/wep spec is nice for flat bonus. Fury is good for tanking with enrage and you can use whatever weapons you come across - 2h, 1her - even fast weapons aren't really that 'bad' (except it tanks your WW damage). Arms you have to use a slow 2her and a different type can mean a respec which can be pretty painful in Vanilla economy.    
---
TLDR: Spec whatever the fk you want, you're talking a few % difference so who gives a shit. It's not like you're choosing between resto and feral druid, it's still a warrior. Just play the damn game.
---
But I thought the term main tank didn’t mean anything to pugs?
---
The level 10 in an hour was possible, I did it a few times on alts when I had multiple accounts back then. 
---
It was a matter of knowing exactly where all the quest items and mobs were at, how to get them done efficiently and which ones were more of a time sink and not worth doing. IE: Run across the map to talk to this person then run the other direction to talk to this person and no quests in between.
---
lol at this over exaggeration, hes asking if we can get access to download the game before the 13th
---
A episode under this statement with real connections. Perfect Classic/reddit plot
---
So how would you feel if everyone in the world would get to play two weeks earlier and the US release was delayed?
---
Warrior tanks can do strat several pulls at a time as well... Its not hard.
---
Also spec identity is a lot looser in Vanilla than it really was elsewhere.  There's so much shared that outside of a handful of things there's nothing one mage can do that another can't. It's just 2-4 abilities, a pro or two, and some shifting percentages.
---
It's tough, but usually, as a guild, you all have ran BWL and AQ repeatedly leading up to Naxx release. All your warriors should have some sort of raid-gear tank setup. If I recall, two of the 4hm do heavier melee damage, and that's where you start your main tanks in the 4hm fight rotation. This was my personal experience.
---
Presuming that someone who buys an account won't be good at the game is pretty baseless. Besides, most guilds have a trial period.
---
The funniest part is that even Shamans generate more threat than Paladins. Shamans have their own flaws of course too (since they aren't technically tanks), but they are shockingly efficient at generating threat.
---
it's a video game. play as you like. red = dead. sure, if you're camping someone they might get a buddy or get on their main and camp you back. that drama was all part of the game lol. i haven't read up on how the servers are going to be setup but back in the day you could choose PvP vs. PVE for a reason.
---
what a dumb reply. I don't like one thing about classic wow and instantly "go back to /r/wow". dude, no words
---
I mean, hes not wrong
---
lol 
---
I played on more of those servers than I can count and it's no other server ever even got close to having the effect that Nost did.
---
Also, there's not a single even decent server for any content except Vanilla because ... well, Nost was the only server to make the game playable. 
---
When the private server stuff started, abilities like charge strictly didn't work, abilities like blink just flung you forward, didn't break stun etc.
---
Besides most of these servers had 100x XP rates and shit like that. 
---
You honestly couldn't have discredited yourself more.
---
Charging gold to summon group mates? Yep sounds like a scummy alliance player
---
Considering that I would never play on a non-US server, I wouldn't care.
---
&gt; Every time you needed a 100g mat from a vendor right outside.
---
That sounds really dull since it doesn't really add anything to the game apart from telling you that "you need more gold". 
---
What the talent spec system does is force you to pick talents that (you think) are good for whatever it is you want to do. You dont just hand off a bunch of gold to a vendor, you actually have to put in 51 talent points, keybind the new skills you acquired and then use the entire package (that you built yourself) efficiently.
---
Yeah this door is in the South in Tanaris, almost identical, on the border of Uldum.
---
Horde
---
When they open up on me from 25% no pretty much normally lose. I don't really have a problem with the fact rogues do that. After all they are rogues and they are the mouth breather class in classic wow. I enjoy the fact they get to be villains because I think it's a part of what makes classic so special.
---
What I don't get though is the need to be "not like those other rogues". I mean yes your exactly like those other rogues lol. Rogues are the shit eaters of classic. Love them for it hate them for it, either way it's what they are. All I'm saying is I don't understand the "virtuous rogue". Play another class if your so virtuous lol.
---
I ran this on two characters in the past, its quite nice, dunno if optimal but I felt quite strong early on.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LMhxbZV
---
lvl 26, about the time you'll run into your first pvp
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LMGxdhwoZV
---
lvl 39, I respec'd at 40 to the standard arms pvp build. I've never leveled as fury but hamstring kiting was far more viable on private servers, so it might be better in regards to that, though I still remain fond of sweeping strikes regardless.
---
It's a shame MMOs don't support the hybrid role anymore (or the communities). Every class has to be equally viable at either taking damage, dealing damage, or healing, and pure utility and buff roles have been lost. Always my favourite kind of classes to play
---
i recall reading most of the quest text. it wasn't much reading, from what i remember. mankrik did give bad directions, though.
---
There main taink as in the guild hosting the pug, i was speaking reference to the actual post.
---
As a PUG you wouldnt care about their tanks gearing, and as a raid leader you shouldnt expect PUGs to be happy if you hand over all gear the tank needs
---
*Shrugs*
---
And my answer is: you shouldn't care.
---
Not really unless you're a no lifer, and even then, you're only going to get a week or two of herb farming in those zones. Not to include those that reach the high levels that quick are going to farm gear and patterns.
---
I read them all before I replied.
---
Your response shows that you know you're wrong but are refusing to admit it because you don't want to look stupid in front of internet strangers, which makes you look more stupid because we all know you are wrong. 
---
Just accept the criticism and move on.
---
Sounds like the voice of someone who‘s like to be told what to do. Here have an axe. Now make damn sure you kill people with it. 
---
I‘d be cutting wood.
---
Hey man our raid group 2 is need of a warrior tank in a leadership role, would this interest you?

So make a spec that does everything you want to do, decently. Or accept that every character isn't able to do everything. 
---
I really think this is a pretty big RPG element that is very important to the game. Every character can't do everything at once, and that's fine - it's up to the player to choose what they want to do, and how good they want to be at it.
---
20 replies and no one answered my mans' quandary. OP, you're looking for the [Filled Cerulean Vial](https://classicdb.ch/?item=17696), but I don't believe it'll be usable outside of Mara in Classic. 
---
You were most likely watching [lolwtf/greatwizard](https://youtu.be/v_OoUNtunIw?t=7) and that was recorded on Feenix.
---
You mean players who don't have an enemy castbar addon
---
For end game as caster dps elemental shaman is out.  
---
Personal preference mage is more fun but I advise watching videos of people in classic
---
I ran WoW on a 300 or so dollar laptop with a dual core with integrated graphics (This being in Cataclysm). I would say it is safe to say any 300-400+ dollar Laptop or Desktop will run Vanilla/Classic WoW.
---
I run fury till 30. 
---
Then I usually switch back to fury around 50 when whirlwind axe falls off. 
---
(Assuming fresh server conditions)
---
Why do people love their own nation while hating other nations
---
Arms forces you to pick a weapon specialization. That is fine for end-game when you won't replace your weapon very often, but it is bad for leveling when you will replace your weapon every 6 hours. Respec is expensive.
---
It's really not that many. Macros do the rest.
---
Ooh I'll look for traque in particular. They were amazing in that duel tourney a while ago
---
Id imagine so, usually blizz allows patches/games to be downloaded in advance anyway.
---
because the have a good amount of level 60 characters lying around....
---
how do you think they got the gold?
---
I agree. But of all people/studios I trust, South Park would be the one. But that's probably the only reason why they wouldn't. The first one was such a classic pardon the pun.
---
I googled "vanilla wow exploration leveling"
---
BOW, YA SHITS!
---
In the PVE category i agree... Mages just FARM and Shamans Don't but in PVP i know Shamans can put some work in.  Just Torn between the 3.
---
That is a weird comparison...
---
i used dagger to tank up until BWL. it was on my alliance gnome warrior and got the dagger from whatshiface dragon world boss north of STV. high attack speed + agility is great for tanking (rage gen + dodge/crit). but never take it unless a rogue or even hunter doesn't need it. that's a dick move..
---
Totally fair and understand the concern. For me, I can’t even tell you what my own schedule or availability is going to be next month (let alone 3+ months+!) so I’m focusing on shorter term plans. 
---
The shorter term plan is to organize instance running nights and seeing how that goes. Eventually that would hopefully evolve into smaller raids like for scholo and UBRS. Eventually hope to work our way up to 40mans.
---
Yeah Ive seen this before. What is it that makes it so strong? Just the raw DPS on it? Or are the stats legit good for that level?
---
If only they didn't remove Crusader Strike after the alpha or beta or whatever it was.
---
Great idea!
---
Yeah, 30’s was my favorite too.
---
We're talking about a video game here
---
if they took it from you (a rogue?) when it was an improvement, they were dicks.
---
If they did add later xpacs they should be able to implement them with little to no extra work once they've gotten Classic figured out since recreating other xpacs will be nearly the same process.
---
“People will be people.” 
---
Okay.
---
You literally can’t lose mana as a hunter since they use focus
---
Niiice n clean! Get it ready for classic will you! Lmao
---
We can’t ever have enough pvpers! Throw me a pm or join our disco and say that you’re here to kill alliance. I’m sure you’ll get a warm welcome... :)
---
Camera and movement on a touchscreen: Two finger gesture to turn and move with a static "over the shoulder" camera angle. Rotate two fingers to turn your character. Move two fingers away from the center of the screen to move that direction. It would be like a thumb stick, so you just move your fingers slightly and keep them there to continue moving.
---
Huh???
---
Totemic or a similar addon.  
---
I'll be honest, I bind a lot of things, but I end up clicking most of them.  Classic is less about how fast you can click, and more about using the ability that's most appropriate for the situation.  Mana is a much bigger fiend than your GCD.

Came here looking for fellow based r/freefolk
---
This. I want this.
---
I have a feeling ret is gonna suprise a few people
---
Red is dead people are a necessary part of the pvp ecosystem. They are like Tony Montana in scarface. "I'm the bad guy".
---
Variety is the spice of life.
---
We could play the last one though 🙃
---
Not in classic where classes are designed a certain way.
---
A lot of you seem to forget the reason Blizzard started pushing "bring the player not the class" is because in classic there was a huge outcry by players who felt left out and forced to fill a certain role because their other builds weren't up to par with the rest.
---
Guilds that will do PvE seriously won't be gimping the raid with classes that perform visibly worse. Organizing and leading 40 man raids is too straining to bring underperforming classes in just for the hell of it. It's easier to teach a bad mage how to top dps meters than it is making the greatest player alive a contributing boomkin dpser.
---
.. which no good player will be playing without.
---
&lt; Also people say warrior levels slow but I use hamstring kite
---
Just FYI, Um the hamstring kite (Aka slow + kite) has been proven to NOT work in classic due to mob speed being too fast (even when slowed).
---
Did they raise it after Vanilla? I thought you could get higher but most of my twinking was during BC.
---
Takes alot of rebinding, but it's alot of fun!
---
Won’t be annoying because you can just not play with them. The best part about min maxers is you’re not even on their radar for most of the game. You might as well be another npc so no worries.
---
And then released a few years later.
---
Did you look at the link i put in my post and the theory behind how druid tanking and gesr work?
---
Also the warriors and druids where competing in the same environment on those servers so when they both have to deal with the higher parry chance the data should still be accurate when they have to deal with it on classic servers.
---
But i don't think what im saying or any info i present will change your mind it seems like you made your mind up on this and you just dont want druids to tank.
---
Hardcore music mixed with high-level PvP gameplay...
---
Yeah that's perfect for someone who has never ever played the game. /s
---
Edgy. Somehow I don't believe you played vanilla. You'd have to be older than 14.
---
"Gold sellers" will sell in-game currency and services (like leveling service or accounts with high-level characters.  Gold isn't the only thing they sell.
---
never had an issue. only macro i had was for NS+big heal when leveling (for when you get ganked). i used to level as 1h+shield elemental shaman. WF on my main hand, lightning shield up -&gt;flame shock - &gt; melee -&gt; whatever my highest shock is at that level. maybe throw in a lightning bolt if i felt cheeky.
---
A cheap little laptop would do it just as well.
---
I would have a great healer to run with lol
---
&gt; most guilds/hardcore players are going to have similiar level times I would assume. So I personally believe that things such as BIS/consumables will give guilds a clear advantage. 
---
Have they said whether MC will be open day 1?  I would assume not but if so, we'll need to agree to disagree on the impact layering has.  I doubt Raganaros will survive the first day he's spawned, and if there's no delay, it will literally be "The first or second hardcore guild to get 40 bodies".  I'd go so far as to say that more that a bit of MC will be world-first cleared with less than 40 people.  
---
If they DO delay the opening, then it may be a factor, although I would doubt that they would go so far as you'd described.  You'd only really need consumables for 1 raid, and 40 pre-raid BiS skilled players will decimate that instance.
---
Afaik yes, unless you can no-life PvP for months
---
fuck wow the warlock and rogue one is fucking hilarious. I haven't seen that in sooooo long hahaha. he smacks him in the head with the watering can lol.
---
The dirt is the wrong color.  This is clearly Uldaman.
---
Through the [battle.net](https://battle.net) client like everything else.
---
Hahah quite the analogy there thank you. The more i read the more I worry a tank is for those that have a lot more time than me unfortunately.
---
A gun is an item and, a class is your in game "identity". This is a complete non-sequitur. It In real life it would be more along the lines of "Guys I know I'm a Nazi but, I'm not like those other Nazi's I'm a tolerant Nazi. I treat everyone equally." It's like okay I guess but, they why the fuck do you identify as a Nazi?
---
Lol you don't even have an argument. Just a shit talking child. First, try forming an opinion. Second, try backing it up. Like maybe how there were some Nostalrius employees that ended up embezzling from the donation funds that kept the servers up.
---
This would be great for newbies if it was cut to 3 minutes and had a more exciting voice behind it.
---
Love MadSeasonShow but even he makes fun of himself for having a "boring" voice.
---
Gold wasted too.
---
Me with Enhancment shamans. At least we get Stormstrike, I guess.
---
An RPG can never be balanced and still be fun.  If you tried to play Dungeons and Dragons in a way where the rogue and the wizard were equally powerful in all situations, you'd suck every bit of fun out of it.  As a side note, the same goes for min-maxing.
---
Rogue literally never sucks ever unless you're trying to kill something using only ranged attacks. If you wanna cast spells as a rogue, you're gonna have a bad time. Otherwise, having played rogue in every expansion and vanilla included, it's my second favorite class overall. The only thing that it can do but doesn't excel at is farming large packs of mobs at once.
---
What? If you've started charging an aimed shot at *anyone*, how will they get behind you to intercept/charge AFTER you've begun charging it? They can't.
---
The fuss has been raised, for weeks in fact, and now the dead horse has been beat.
---
You are in beta, and streaming. Prepare to be criticized as whining/crying on stream about a beta for a game we all love, but not all have access to, will not be taken in with open arms. It's clear you are passionate about the game, but you put yourself out there for everyone to see. Maybe be more constructive and understanding that, first and foremost, you are a beta tester. Test the game, make bug reports, but don't cry about well known bugs that clearly have the developers attention. It's not very becoming.
---
You want to know how rustle some jimmies with the private server community? Poke fun at the client, it gets them every time. If you think private servers are a true and accurate representation of the vanilla WoW client, you either never played Vanilla or the years of private servers have distorted your memory of a 13 year old game.
---
Macros.
---
You don't need binds/hotbar slots for 1, alt+1, shift+1 &amp; control+1.
---
You just need one macro with [mod:] lines, something like:
---
    #showtooltip
---
    /cast [mod:shift] Stoneskin Totem
---
    /cast [mod:alt] Tremor Totem
---
    /cast [nomod] Searing Totem
---
    /cast [mod:shift] Healing Wave(Rank 4)
---
    /cast [mod:alt] Healing Wave(Rank 3)
---
    /cast [nomod] Healing Wave(Rank 2)
---
You slap that baby on hotkey "1" and then hit "alt+1" for rank2 healing wave etc.
---
1.12 leveling vs 1.0 is a big difference
---
All of your knowledge sounds like it comes from private servers. In vanilla. True progression guilds used night elf and tauren.
---
/u/SoupaSoka - hitting "HD Graphics 520 GPU, which scored 414" - was it on 1080 resolution? I barely got 250 points with 620 GPU, so just wondering... (otherwise it is Lenovo 720s IKBR (i5-8250U), so it's not a showstopper as you said).
---
Just giving different prospectives I know it's tough to understand how people are all different and gravitate to different things. But you have fun out their bashing peoples opinions with your insecurities. GL
---
Did that while raiding ZG a few times. Had to hearth back to get more. What sucked was getting the Thorium bullets and converting them to arrows when it happened. If I didnt have time to do that I just had to buy the highest available arrows from the vendor.
---
Warlocks probably have just as many if not more.
---
I know, but my box came with 5 discs and I wanted to keep them all together, I'm too sentimental to throw one disc away :p 
---
It would make sense to go with 4/4/4 though, thanks for the feedback! :)
---

Why write this? Clearly i hurt your feelings somehow. Like i can magically identify an elitist when i group with randoms before grouping. Please. Its not a huge deal but still a minor problem thats a fact deal with it.
---
I think you are assuming they are going to open up when they can lose. This is never the case in the real world.
---
but only when standing still, he shadowmelts
---
Yes but this is just a general warning and some people who have not played in a long time not know about level 60 account selling.
---
I cant use alt my hands are too small :(
---
Thanks alot!
---
Which is what I wrote? Yet, it's only 3-5 slots a spelladin competes with, compared to the 15 slots another mage competes for.
---
I'm not planning to join a guild before release. When i play during the leveling process, i'll meet new people and maybe get to know about a guild to join. Just go with the flow
---
If you read other comments, you'll see why. I even say "this is why I posted this , thank you"
---
I said we don't know how it's going to turn out. Settle down. You don't need to get all defensive about druids being a slightly better than sub optimal spec.
---
Warlocks dont downrank much tho
---
no, rotations and classes still boring trash
---
You know, not everybody playing on pvp server... Some people only care of pve. Why those people chose rogue then? For me rogue is the closest class to a "ninja" style fight... DW, Agile, poisons, stealth....
---
I'd think pally would be the most cumbersome
---
yeah, stuff like this video (druid tanking one boss on bug trio then healing the other two) https://youtu.be/bG5P71m6D4g is very rare to find in today's MMOs and such an awesome feeling for both character fantasy and gameplay.
---
When Trump got elected my dude.
---
*Saitama*: OK.
---
razoregore's still an annoying event for anyone new to it. it takes a team effort. well, so is the next guy but razoregore was the hardest when we were getting into it, if i recall.
---
I think MC will be open Day 1.
---
train of thoughts
---
Could use trueaim gauntlets in the gloves category. They make it more than likely free to get the cookie cutter 20BM/31MM spec instead of having to go 18 into surv for + hit (less attack power and crit than the devil saur combo for twice the hit - and you get way more dmg out of your char if you don't have to dip into sv - may stick around till Dire Maul opens up)
---
2 handed category could do with peacekeeper. the 3,4 speed is better suited for melee dives with the faster than 3 sec speed ranged weapons. It is also the low budged option for people who don't go for a reaper.
---
Seeing as we won't get a leaf till phase 2 it is quite likely that you will be using those pre raid blue ranged weapons for quite some time which raises the value of the arcane rifle as the rifle + thaurisan's belt(missing in belt section) also boost you to a lvl 61 entity
---
Especially as Strikers and Blastershot are simply better in the hands of melee dps. With 2.5 and 2.6 they are way too fast for hunters who plan to utilize an AiS rotation and the moment the leaf is out those ranged weapons end up in the trashcan aka they are wasted
---
Talents could do with the preraid 5 man spec 7 / 31 / 12 +1 free to distribute point grabbing trap duration for ice and entrapment for frost on large trash fights
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/hunter/AsAwBDjTNzQCjMM](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/hunter/AsAwBDjTNzQCjMM)
---
The rotation only covers the mindless private server one melee dive per cycle option
---
You can add another one during the multishot autoshot swingtimer on the usual AiS rotation
---
The post patch 1.10 4:3 no AiS rotation is missing. Main benefits are no delay due to AiS casts on faster than 3 sec speed weapons. Doesn't force you into a 10 sec cycle (no10+ sec on slow weapons and no clipped autos on faster weapons). Not viable in green/blue gear due to AiS +600 physical unless you tryhard right away from week one (highly unlikely) There is the counter argument that it is way more mana intensive. Less relevant for alliance as judged wisdom allows for the old 5 sec arcane cd prior to T3 mana conservation.
---
consumes could go with winterfall in addition for yourself as grinding might for both you and your pet can be rather time consuming with blue gear and the -5 points of melee attack power aren't the end of the world as long as you can deal with the larger hitbox for positioning.
---
Supreme power, arcane and greater arcane are missing for the tryhard version of 4:3. 
---
Macros could do with a stop attack and stop casting addition. The main use is between melee dives and the way back to range to avoid latency related delay on your melee/auto shot commands. (the game won't queue an auto shot command until you are back at firing range and keeps trying to continue the melee swing timer which just spams the server and your client with out of range messages. Though manual activation/deactivation of the different swingtimers are obviously always an option when people don't want an additional button on their bars.
---
Played a NE hunter and the nostalgia to obtain the leaf and Rok‘delar again is strong. 
---
But I never healed in Classic and was never ever a dwarf in 14 years. Dwarf priest inc. (and no intention of min/maxing)
---
They have groups who sell gold in game items and characters, even gold sellers who keep there 60 accounts will sell raid run throughs and the devilsaur mafia is mainly from the gold seller groups.
---
Can shamans not dualwield in vanilla? I cant remember lol
---
i love this meme, and this particular incarnation of it is a beaut
---
Do it and post pictures of 'em!
---
Hits very hard in comparison to weapons that you can obtain in that level.
---
&gt;/equipmentslot 16 and 17
---
PS
---
Yes, this is why I'm thinking maybe I shouldn't even start
---
You know what, I feel like this is a much better idea. Idk I was warming up to the idea of joining a discord server with a guild before release, get to know them and then venture off to Vanilla with new freinds
---
Works for me. Half of my social group will be playing Classic.
---
The other half knows where they can find me after Aug 26...
---
Doesn't work...:(
---
I'm on private vanila if that helps
---
Hello me.
---
I agree with a lot of this stuff. Many Classic classes have awful unintuitive design. Spam one button for your Ranged DPS. Melee has 3-4. Warlocks literally can't DoT things because of the debuff limit.
---
A lot of people talk about spec identity, but outside of say Druid, and Spriest it really doesn't exist anywhere near the level it's gotten to.
---
Also the largest flaw in the new talent tree system is the distance between things. If the theorized level squish is coming, they should maybe move to one every 6-10 levels and have between 6-10 talents to keep the progression alive.
---
Where is your source for this?  If this is true, then that kills the strategy for several other classes, including Mages, Hunters, Rogues, and Shamans.
---
Priests, Warlocks, Druids, and Paladins wouldn't be affected.
---
Yeah I guess but I dont click anymore save hearthstone etc
---
As a Switch owner, I would love this.
---
Buying an account means that person either was too lazy to get a character on his own or too bad.
---
Either way someone who buys an account is a shit player.
---
I think it could do pretty well if they have all the characters become adult/older versions of themselves, and they repeat similar but different plot points and jokes.
---
AN IMPRESSIVE SIGHT FOR THE MASSES EH? BOW BEFORE YOUR RAID LEADER! BOW YA SHITS!
---
I only had a priest on my first account. I was really envious of the mages ability to aoe farm and the we had an amazing hunter that could kite with such elegance that made me want to become one.
---
The first time I quit wow, I sold that account. I came back with recruit a friend and went all in on the alts. Loved my mage, lock, and pally. Was warming up to the rouge and Hunter. Didn't give much love to the others.
---
I have a feeling a lot of people are going to roll ret paladin and realize 15 years of skillups and innovation can't change math.
---
Classic: "2+2=4"
---
Ret Paladins: "But, what if I try REALLY HARD to make it equal 5?"
---
We don’t have a raiding schedule yet. 
---
Currently more focused on building a solid core with a good culture of people. 
---
If I had to guess though, it would be weeknight raids for the big ones. Probably not more than 2 a week. Again, this is 3months out and a lot of things can change. 
---
Realistic plan is to see how well we can even form for smaller instances while leveling up.
---
Was thinking more along the lines of ganking 60's in BRM like in the pvp videos, but in the scenario you put forward there's not much counterplay and it is effortless for sure.
---
Thanks man, I had a good time with this little project!
---
I will! Thanks mate. What a nice chap
---
Please say the name is based on Kim Jun saying "hello"
---
Hey man, I'm really looking for something more focused on one raid group for vanilla - I can definitely see why the 2 raid groups is appealing, but that is my thought process for now. Thank you!
---
Because that's not Vanilla. It would be fine for BFA to be on a phone or switch, not Vanilla.
---
When people make ranks of leveling difficulty they're always based on 1.12 playing in private servers because that's what you have to base your opinion about vanilla nowadays beside old forum posts and videos with potato resolution. You can search ANY class guide in youtube for Classic and they'll say the same thing.
---
Lol no. Some people value their time but can still be skilled at the game.
---
Seriously. And only better players understand this.
---
50% crit to one ability, vs. 5% crit to all abilities.  That one ability is only useful after the enemy dodges, which doesn't happen all that often against mobs in PvE, unless you're fighting above your level.
---
You're also comparing 1 talent to 1 talent, which isn't an effective way of comparing talent trees.
---
If you like to click hotbar items then you can make a macro so that it performs a different action depending on if you left or right click it

I feel like it is the class with the most binds needed id you want to bind every thing that could be needed in combat. Then again you might define ”not that many” differently than me.
---
They cannot. Either 2H or 1H + shield.
---
Why do you mention that?
---
I got it! I got it! I....
---
Aww....
---
I never used quest helper.
---
You're right it is a different perspective. One that doesn't explain what the game is or how it works. One that a new player won't understand at all.
---
This but ctrl &gt; alt
---
It was 720p using the "Basic" preset in Heaven.
---
Ah cool, thanks for the macroing info it is useful! However I prefer to bind every spell or ability/item I could possibly need in combat and only click for things like hearthstone.
---
Jesus what a waste.
---
So the class with fire ward and that doesn't rely on converting health to mana dies on Ragnaros?
---
Why you taking jabs at fortnite players?  Fortnite has a much higher mechanical and strategic skillgap than wow.
---
Then don't play a pc game.
---
The point is just play what you want to play and makes you happy. If everyone coordinates you can make it work. One pet would off tank and we would cc like 3. It's more fun when you actually get to use all you abilities and strategize. The same old cookie cutter group and builds gets boring imo.
---
One of my concerns for classic is that I will have to explain to new players why I need on certain items... for example as a hunter, Dal'Rends main and off hand swords are the best pre-raid weapons, cause as a set they give 1% crit and 50 Ap...  (they are also pre-raid BiS for rogues too)
---
but they are swords and have strength and defense stats... How many will call you ninja for rolling for them?
---
I understand if people like more to get settled before the release mostly because they want to have a good raid spot. I'll just see were it goes play on my own pace not having to rush to 60 in couple of weeks play the auction house with some professions to make some gold. you'll for sure meet other players during your leveling and who knows next you'll have a good dedicated 5 man dungeon group etc. I like the unexpected thats just me :D
---
Im in exactly the same boat.. but sometimes thoughts about Mages, Rogues or Druids pop up as well 🤣
---
i would go with what you find fun. warlock was amazing in PvP. not as squishy as mage and still able to dish out damage. elemental shaman is viable. you need the tricket that boosts spell power on cooldown. i had guys in my old guild who could put up respectable DPS. BWL onwards. however, i have no idea what blizz has done with the talents for classic as i'm not in this beta or w/e. mage is always good all around. probably not as gear dependent as the other two you mentioned. was always up there in DPS and could wreck in PvP. but definitely warlock for PvP.
---
also, don't forget shadow priest for PvP if you want to melt faces.
---
TLDR: all 3 are good. play the one you have fun with.
---
got 'em
---
Yea no worries, like I remember getting in some WSG matches lasting 3 hrs or longer from flag holding. It happened, and ppl farmed HK's no doubt, but generally speaking you wanted to face other skilled twinks and always go for the win.
---
Just use questie an you get arrows an markers
---
I leveled a Warrior to 15 back in vanilla and had no problem at all. Same with a Rogue. I did it when trying to decide what alt to do.
---
What should we trust... The low difficulty streamers recently had leveling warriors in Classic Beta or memories from 15 years ago from people who struggled + opinions of people who just played in pservers? And yes, now everybody in beta is a twink, but it wan'st like that when they started.
---
I'm in "I'll believe it when I see it" mode when it comes to this.       
---
           
---
"We pinky swear we will remove it" is not legally binding, linking to this video months from  now if they *don't* remove it won't change their minds. If they decide ahead of launch that keeping layering indefinitely is best for the game, they'll keep it in, promises be damned.      
---
          
---
Until the day they actually DO remove it, I will continue to doubt. They haven't earned the sort of trust this kind of promise requires.
---
Having classes that are equally as powerful but in different ways is also how you let people shine. My wizard can manipulate the fabric of reality and warp space and time, my rogue can assassinate a key target and hide almost unnoticed in the shadows, and my bard can manipulate everyone with his persuasion and deception.
---
Nah you're 100% right, it adds to the RP of the game as well as the adventure
---
Old School Rune Scape
---
Thanks, that is kind of what I was trying to achieve as well.
---
I'm personally convinced that if they were to make a "WoW 2" where they stayed to the Vanilla design philosophies while at the same time adding the learnings (note: not the same as conveniences) of expansions and the balance and viability changes it brought with it to the various specs of the various classes it would be immensely fun but of course it's always easy to theory craft under the assumption that everything goes well.

Huh, never thought about it, only assumed everyone went 2h cause its more fun. I remember dualwielding on my shaman in bc tho.
---
This. I've been gushing to my coworkers of all ages that would listen as august 27th comes closer. 
---
Talking about meeting people/guildies from different states, cultures, age groups. Having these guildies/role models  mentor me as I was a rebellious 15 year old and wanted nothing more than to separate myself from my parents. 
---
Learning life lessons one used to only learn in team sports like cooperation, persistence, responsibility. 
---
Keeping in touch with my late father when I eventually went away to college because he picked up the game to play with me and then he continued to play while I'd take breaks to focus on more difficult semesters. He even made good friends with 2 boys of 15, the age I was when I began playing and he mentored them, I watched, humbled to be able to see this again but from a different perspective as they grew. Then around the time he passed they were so broken up, probably more than I was because I was able to see it all coming and we grieved together. Happy Father's Day, Myrdin.
---
What a ride. 
---
I want nothing more than to be that mentor now I think it is my main driving force for playing classic. Not only to relive nostalgia but pick up the  reins and be the raid leader or class officer that I once looked up to as a youth.
---
Incorrect, WoW makes me better than everyone. Look into it.

That's 27 keys within reach, not add alt, ctrl and shift modifiers and I really don't see how you can lack binds, if anything it's actionbar space you'll be missing.

People live in different circumstances. I know technology has advanced to the point where 5gb isn't alot, but the maybe the CPU i'd be using doesn't have a lot of space cause it's a secondary one, an old laptop? You dont know my situation, no need to be a dick about me asking a question. Dismissing it like it's no big deal because it's no big deal to you. 
---
What if I just wanted to know in general to remind myself to delete the stress test later cause I like not occupying space on my hard drive if I dont have to? Regardless of my reason, you come off as a dick, and dont contribute to my question so thanks for the snarky remarks fam. I hope they don't match ur social skills in real life.
---
But it's going to be my main, so I'll definitely be running engineering on it.
---
They're working on it still, it'll appear in the [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) app soon-ish (possibly separately from the beta client as well).
---
2H enhancement was very good to level as well, if a bit squishy compared to 1h+shield. those WF procs, though!
---
You select *Beta &amp; Stress Test: Wow Classic* as your region in the battle net app.
---
Does that matter?
---
One thing I wished, back in the day, is that WoW would have had itemization more like Diablo 2.  In D2, the color of the item didn't tell you how good it was, it just told you what to expect:
---
* Blue items were "magic" and could only have 1-2 bonuses, but they could be very powerful bonuses (i.e. where a Rare might cap at +75% damage, a magic weapon could cap at +300% damage).  In WoW, this would be like an "of Stamina" or "of the Monkey" item, only I wish they had Rare and Epic-level versions.
---
* Yellow items were "rare" and could have 3-5 bonuses, but not as powerful as a Magic item.
---
* Gold items are "unique" and you'd know (within a small variance) what it had
---
* Green items are "set" items and may not be as powerful as a similar-level item on their own, but complete the set and they are more powerful
---
Imagine being on an Affliction warlock and getting an item that only had a ton of Stamina and Shadow Spell Damage, a Hunter getting an item with just a ton of agility, or a Paladin with an item that has +4% spell crit (and no other stats).    It might not total to as much stat value as something with a more balanced approach, but it would be stats that your class loves more than any other.
---
As a pug you do whatever the organizer says. As an organizer you do whatever the hell you want. That’s it. No ones forcing a pug to stay, if you don’t like the rules, leave. If you stay, you’re stuck with the rules. Doesn’t matter two shits what you think about the them.
---
There are plenty of PuG loot systems, but one that I found usually worked extremely well was having a loot spreadsheet and every raider could put one item as their desired item for a raid.  If it dropped, anyone after that item would roll for it.  If only one person had that item listed, they got it free and clear.  For items that no one called out, like tier set pieces, it was free roll between anyone that needed it main spec over off spec.  Special extremely rare items would typically be guild reserved, but as a PuG coming to a raid where the majority of people coming were part of the organized guild that made it possible to come and down the content, that typically isn't a big deal.
---
In the end you have to understand that guilds and guild leaders have reputations, and unlike retail people care about maintaining a positive reputation because the server community definitely will remember if you screw over people and typically you won't be able to fill PuG raids in the future.
---
alright cool happy to have helped you made your mind GL on your journey then Godspeed adventurer
---
They meet all the time. In forums, on Reddit, and in Twitch chat.
---
Unless something changed this week Method has no plans on going to classic world first.
---
They made a joke about it, considering how mechanically simplistic vanilla was.

---
Any tips on what monitor to get?
---
Gamepad, mouse with thumb buttons, and macros.
---
Downranking macro is the best thing you can do. You have a "downrank" key, then every one of your spells is actually a macro that checks for that key, then ranks down if it is pressed, that right there cuts the number of buttons you need in half. Sometimes you still need more, for example you'll probably want R1 Healing wave if specced Healing Way, or if you're trying to tank you'll need 3 ranks of Earth Shock.
---
They also can't speak in anything but /say and /party
---
I def agree that the old sandwich was better, and I remember eating way too much of it.
---
If 100 people bought an account, your argument may account for 1 of them.
---
If you want to level, generally
---
It should be possible as they should have their own launch icons. Its just a matter of mapping the icons to look for the program in their own separate hard drive space.
---
You can also get fancy with it and have the macro do different things depending on if your target is friendly or enemy
---
    /cast [help] Healing Wave
---
    /cast [harm] Earth Shock
---
True, hah, I'm more talking in general though.
---
Hurt my feelings?  I agree with you man.
---
You’re feelings seem the most hurt here and I’m not sure why.
---
My hands are small I cannot comfortably reach alot of those keys! Like F1 etc and b,v,y. 
---
But I guess ur right It is possible, Ill just have to settle for some awkward ones like shift-Z etc.
---
From a priest that did all vanilla apart from a couple of boss's in Nax, it's not the raiding that is the problem it's the farming, farming alt is mandatory.
---
Seems like reporting posts that hurt your feelings sustains you, snowflake
---
that sucks. i have like a 8 button mouse and binded all my main skills to that. mid mouse for strongest shock, m4 for NS+Heal macro, etc. etc.. good to have multi button mouse. was very helpful on my warrior for quick stance switches.
---
If you play alliance on pvp server then only then it means you have @@. Horde on pvp servers are 80-20...
---
It's also slow and boring to play. Zero mobility, long ramp-up, garbage DPS until way late game raiding. Yeah, no.
---
Down ranking and full access to all spells makes for the best time to play a mage imo.
---
Yeah, why go on the adventure when you can just buy the destination, this isn't BFA. Why play this game if theres no time for the grind.
---
See what I mean, Fortnite players already drawn to the salt I layed out.
---
I think there's a happy medium.  You want progression, and you want players to desire things out of the later raids.  One thing I think makes players burn out in Legion and BFA is that there's not much point to raiding, when you can get just as good of gear from random world quests.
---
However, the opposite is true of WotLK, in that gear scaled so high you had most healers hitting the 1.0 second GCD with haste, a lot of DPS hitting 70%+ crit or 100% armor penetration, and Rogues that could solo a raid boss by having 102.4% avoidance.
---
Yeah I stop taking people seriously when they use the latest popular game as an insult as if anyone who plays it is incapable of learning more complex situations in games.
---
Can confirm. Got jumped by a rogue in Hellfire Peninsula once as a warrior. Now I really don't PvP much, I forget why I was flagged even. But I had picked up enough to be able to break out of stun-lock and down him. All I could think was "My god you are the absolute worst rogue ever."
---
Having played human and done many corpse runs back into dungeons, I was always jealous of the NE wisp form
---
I use uBlock Origin with no issues to block ads, maybe that's why wowhead runs smoothly for me
---
Certainly that is true, Boomkin was terrible and wouldnt be able to pull their own weight as a DPS in a raid. There are bad PVE classes/builds, undoubtedly, and no amount of gear can make them viable. I just meant you can play combat daggers/assasination as a night elf rogue, and still do respectable DPS, for example. You don't HAVE to play Human and combat swords, etc.
---
Make sure leave the option for "instant quest text" unchecked for even more immersion.
---
I was sold on Hunter until this "leeway" stuff surfaced. Now I'm not so sure.
---
After over a year without a vehicle I was able to get my hands on a used car. Working 7 days a week to pull through, I am so excited to put these on today. Much love to everyone, see you all in Azeroth!
---
Have fun respeccing to tank for a dungeon and then respeccing back to DD for 50g each.
---
Depends entirely on your PC and budget. What's your PC?
---
You laugh but this is what layering is for.
---
To separate mobile and console players from PC players but all run on the same server infrastructure...
---
Hand of Justice, one of the best trinkets in the game, is valued just for it's 20ap, not the amazing proc.
---
I think, you'll run into trouble with other items giving a value to their procs, which is very hard.
---
No ones ever called it VC, ever.
---
Yeah, casue grenade launchers, auto rifles, and across map snipers take skill when theres not even a fight.
---
Ok, now score is 505. So on par with everything stated at the beginning. Thanks! :)
---
Its probably due to hamstring being a shit anare compaired to other classes
---
Its because of the current Melee lee-way. If they dont fix the melee lee-way then the "slow kite" melee method wont work. and yes it sucks QQ

---
\*for the hording intensifies\*
---
which if we ever see a classic+ is somthing they play around with (somthing i was thinking was undead get daggers, remove humans having maces insted tauren and dwarfs have it, NE gets fist weapons and trolls have polearms.) how much would that one small change just totally mess with BiS lists.
---
I read somewhere recently that every expansion blizzard goes through and does this. Not sure what the time limit is but yeah on my account that was restored every character had names like that.
---
While running through a lower level area I like to tell the players you tag I bag and get them a few fast kills before I take off.  Especially warriors because I feel their pain.  Even in alliance areas I might try to scare them a little bit before helping them if at all possible.  On my way to Badlands yesterday passing through redridge I saw a paladin almost die to a mob but he got that last hit in just in time and dinged from it.  I congratulated him as I started my perilous journey and was killed by a 60 druid guarding the bridge in the north.  I really like the idea of people having the ability to be douche bags and hope they don't take tickets for killing lowbies but I will be one of those weirdos that would help out the opposite faction if I could.
---
You do realize how few real changes come from the talent trees right? There's not a lot there. The "new" keybindings are mostly going to be replacing one ability with another, and some light shuffling of spells.
---
Outside of the penalty that non DPS pay for wanting to actually do anything besides raid, respeccing fees do nothing. There's no "sense of pride and accomplishment" when you want to DPS or even move to another build you saw online
---
"I think I am fine with my 1080Ti, 64GB TridentZ 3600MHz, i7 9700K, 1TB 960Pro NVMe SSD, Razer Ultra-Gamer-Nightclub RGB keyboard with Cherry MX light-brown keys (...)"  
---
Those are the cringiest to me.
---
Not as much, but a decent amount. Soul Drain is a good one, you want max rank if you're trying to drain people in pvp to keep shards up, or R1 for efficiency. Downranked Rain of Fire if you want to push rogues out of stealth, downranked banish is nice for those times when you want to control an elemental but don't want to wait 30 seconds banish to wear off. Downranked CoReck is nice when you want to prevent mobs from running but don't care for the extra AC debuff and don't want to buff the mobs attack power.
---
PM me if anything is bothering you. I'm here to lend an ear
---
I recently saw someone soloing mythic KJ whilst clicking I dunno pretty sure its the new meta.
---
Why is everyone saying Warriors are going to be so popular? Is there data?
---
Its really just 31 point talents that identify you, since you can take the other things as a hybrid build. So really unless you have PI, Lightwell, or Voidform you’re just a priest so it doesn’t really matter because you can basically access everything.
---
Unless you have Moonkin, you’re still a Druid who’s flexible in anything they do.
---
He straight up tells you that he last saw her at a small Tauren settlement off the gold road. When you go south on the gold road from the crossroads the first hut you see off the side of the road is where his wife is. Sounds like perfect directions to me.
---
Worth a shot imo
---
Yes true, I need to get another wow mouse like the one I had back in wrath
---
Considering Warriors are pretty shitty solo farmers it's not asked too much to get some sort of compensation while tanking dungeons for others. Not talking money here, but the ability to roll on DPS gear, a port potentially, no other plate wearer or dibs on a certain item. You'll naturally get more money that way, too, because dungeons are actually quite worthwhile if you don't have to spent an hour forming a group, which you don't if you're a tank.
---
Perfect, glad it makes sense!
---
If you want a staff that bad you can just take the Staff of Westfall quest reward immediately after completing the dungeon. It both does more damage and has more spirit. The only reason for a warrior to roll on the Emberstone Staff is if for some crazy reason he's killing VC without the quest for VC's head.
---
Petra
---
Both of you have +30% movement speed around level 20.  This means you're not waiting for the other to catch up.
---
Neither class is that gear dependent.  I would say hunter gets the bows by default (duh) and up until 40 I don't see why the druid couldn't get more of the upgrades.  Quest rewards and Leatherworking will help.  Past 40, the Hunter can get mail gear.
---
I'm with you, have you decided what you're rolling yet?
---
You and your friend sound like a pair of dumbasses. I r8 1/10
---
Take it. Every time. Tanks &gt; DPS always.  Your TPS boost means, they can push better.
---
&gt;felt like an MMORPG
---
See, that's what I miss. Practically everything now is solo-able, even the economy. In retail, you never really need to worry about health or mana when soloing, unless you pull something too large. In vanilla, even a normal fight would consume some of those resources and to get the most out of your abilities, you needed the support of other players.
---
I'm sorry but this "every class has to be able to..." mentality is what makes MMOs SUCK, including retail. When you fall into that mentality, class uniqueness goes out the window. Is ret paladin VIABLE? certainly. Is it OPTIMAL? No. Should it stop you from playing it if that's what you enjoy? Fuck no.
---
Yes. Especially since I've been avoiding playing Horde and forgot most of those quests. :)
---
Yea, I'll admit some of the combinations are pretty awkward, I usually keep semi low impact binds on those,
---
for instance alt-c and alt-b are my food and drink keybinds as most the time I'll be standing still when I need to hit them anyway, others such as 2 and shift 2 are super easy to hit while moving so I prioritize abilities that I'll often cast while moving there.
---
just came i restart the blizzard launcher
---
Also has good caster boots, kodo rustler boots.
---
Jessh, i was gonna comment rationally but you really just seem salty about rogues in general. 
---
I recommend another game if a class pisses you off this much.
---
&gt; You do realize how few real changes come from the talent trees right? There's not a lot there.
---
Then why do you have to respec so often..?
---
&gt; Outside of the penalty that non DPS pay for wanting to actually do anything besides raid, respeccing fees do nothing. 
---
DPS classes also benefit massively from respeccing, depending on what they're trying to do well. Where did you get the idea that only tanks and healers find use in respeccing?
---
Truth is there is no reason why you should be more right than a "dreaming" ret. Reason is :
---
1) you've most likely not tested yourself to min max the shit out of a ret like you would have for you main class. And the rare times where people display data, it's with very small samples (&lt; 5 players) and none of them are really minmaxed geared either. I don't call that meaningful to have an opinion on it.
---
2) we have still no clue if there are other differences between Classic and pservers (such as the recent Blizzard post on parade values) and what consequences they will have on dps in general, armor values of bosses, and so on
---
Don't try to act smart by comparing current knowledge to math.
---
What's wrong with it?  Is it significantly less snare value?
---
I didn't play much warrior and when I did, I was mostly in Defensive Stance due to tanking dungeons.  So I don't know much about Hamstring.  But I don't think it's that much worse than Wing Clip or Concussive Shot.
---
&gt; you will use overpower around one time per mob 
---
How about no
---
I’ve been the prince of darkness since 1979!
---
&gt;  (+ the recent texture replacement drama)
---
This won't be possible anyway if you are streaming the game so there is no reason why blizzard should worry about monitoring for any of that.
---
The bottom line is that any cheat that is possible on the stadia would also be possible on PC with the same difficulties for them to detect it. So possible cheating is not a reason to not offer it there.
---
I think you are just projecting because you have a hard time getting in groups because of your bad attitude. I've personally kicked lots of people like you out of groups because I don't need your drama.
---
Stop being an elitist shithead telling other people that the way they play is wrong. Not everyone is capable, and it is a matter of preference anyway. It is their business, not yours.
---
It's only boring for those people that came in not understanding what makes a game an MMO and who cbf to deal with the grouping or social aspects.
---
\*runs all the way to Camp Taurajo\* HAY GUSY WHERE MANKIRK WIFE?!
---
Not everyone likes what you like.
---
You can play whatever you want,  just have to have a guild on the same page. Try hard builds min max which excludes a lot of people and specs. It's necessary to them so they can have fast clear times.
---
Yes I was a lock in vanilla going rogue this time 90% going to alliance just don’t like most of hordes animations or voices emotes
---
&gt; Imp Slam is the basis of 2hfury, with a swing timer and careful use it will do more damage/rage than mortal strike against mobs.
---
Where did you read this?
---
Wrong actually.
---
PVP gives really good gear, so the PVE content becomes easier to beat on PVP servers. That's why guilds roll on PVP.
---
Probably cause you only have one account associated with your bnet account.
---
Its a nice Duo.. you have tank (your pet), DPS (you and Druid) and also Healing (Druid). I think it is a good DUO and you can overcome many challenges with it. You are both have good travel speed 36% (with talents) and 40% (travel form). Druid can also easily tank dungeons as bear, so you will also have access to dungeon groups really fast. Or you can make your groups and make sure to avoid loot competition.
---
&gt; That one ability is only useful after the enemy dodges,
---
It's 50% 5% of the time. So a 2.5% overall bonus to crit.
---
Played a a top end guild back in vanilla and we had two mages who were fire spec that cast untalented frostbolts. 
---
The mindset that has developed on private servers is toxic to a majority of the players. Personally, I love to min/max, but it’s also entirely unnecessary to clear the content. Shit we didn’t use flasks, buff pots or world buffs back in the day and we cleared everything.
---
Are there any blue items at level 15?

Yes. I intend to raid and lvl 60 PvP this time around but a fuckton of my nostalgia for this game is lvl 19-29 twinking. It's what I did most when vanilla was retail. So I will have a toon there. Whether I spend 6 hours a week or 6 hours a month playing it, it'll be there when I want it.
---
When are hybrids actually allowed to hybrid though? The are pretty much just healers or DPS. Modern Disc is closer to a true hybrid.
---
Warlocks are mages who evolved to the next level, friend.
---
Smite's hammer?
---
It will appear as WoW Classic: beat &amp;stress test in the drop down menu. If it just says PTR: WoW that is the regular ptr for WoW.
---
Warlocks are NOT tanky if you don't spec into Soul Link
---
As a healer I try to avoid going into melee range on mobs due to the extra threat that you will receive by getting close to the mobs. Possible to rip one right to you just by walking forward if your tank hasn’t been generating a lot of aoe threat.
---
Yes but minimizing it as 4 pieces is a bit unfair because those are some of the most contested/ best/rarest pieces for casters.
---
iirc you can actually go inside the door and "uldum" is an area in Tanaris.

I'd love to see some self-awareness to it pointing out that somehow the kids haven't aged even though they're talking about a state of the game older than their stated ages.
---
That’s 18 I’m pretty sure
---
at the end of the day Ret is still gonna be Ret
---
and Ret ain't that good
---
i use 1234,QWER,ASDF with shift and control modifiers for each, 36 keys in total. If you need more you can add in ZXCV also, but I don't find those as comfortable to hit with modifiers. My mouse has 2 side buttons I use to strafe and I rebound backpedal to "," in case I ever need it.
---
By using these keys, you'll unbind reply to tells and Assist Targeting(?), I just rebind them to a number key.
---
Do you need multiple accounts to play the beta?
---
&gt;i only have 2 differents choices on the launcher :
---
&gt; BFA
---
&gt; PTR Wow
---
So you don't have the client to update. No, there's no 9GB update.
---
Why the farming alt? Was thinking of doing an alt enchanter to save some mats so I can level as Skinner then switch to Enchanting at 60 but otherwise I'll probably just have my one main.
---
This doesn't seem to have anything to do with mob speed, then.
---
This is a meme or people really are so nostalgic about vanilla that they even acquire bad visual taste? The old models are worse in every aspect you can use to compare.
---
Just to be clear,no am not advocating people buy 6-10 year old PCs. I was just trying to provide guidance for people already on those old systems, wondering if they need a new PC or not.
---
I 100% agree btw. AMD has been been amazing for the CPU market these past two years. With RAM and SSDs dropping so much, too, it's a great time to build.
---
That means 99% of hunters are gucci anyway
---
It is now available on the [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) client for everyone with a US WoW account and an updated [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) client.
---
A class is a collection of stats and abilities, not an identify.   How you choose to use those abilities defines your identity.
---
Would i just open an ingame ticket?
---
Oh didn't know about resil.
---
Would probably know about BG specific reps if I've been thinking about it for longer :D
---
&gt; If you see another player at a mining/herb node, let them have it.
---
Nope. It belongs to the first player that successfully mines/picks it.
---
&gt; Roll on locked chests.
---
Nope. It belongs to the rogue.
---
It actually moves your character? Yikes. That seems sketchy. I'm sure it's fine, but that seems to verge on TOS violations as well as the risks inherent in allowing a program to make keystrokes. 
---
Quest helper was the one that inspired the highlighting and locations in Retail IIRC, much less risky in my mind.
---
it showed up.. i am DLing it now thanks all.
---
Surely they could just reduce the size of each layer and increase the number if layers at the start. 
---
First day have like 500 people per layer. 
---
2nd day 1000
---
Third day 1500
---
Etc
---
That way starting zones at less of a zerg and no one ahead of the curve will notice because they're ahead of the curve anyway. And layers get bigger as the masses level up and spread out.
---
Buying a max level character defeats the purpose of classic. 
---
If someone wants to buy character boosts just go play retail.
---
DM=Deadmines not Dire Maul
---
Please don't promote clicking sir.
---
I never understood the argument..Unless its raid time and you are sending the invites for a certain fight it dosen't even matter.
---
both sides are telling the other what's acceptable - both sides play with each other when push comes to shove. If u wanna play a "non optimal" spec go for it, there's no way to make it optimal. Thats not to say you can't make it work. If you want a guaranteed spot everytime you need to play with a group who is down or play an optimal spec. 
---
Its not a personal attack nor is anyone telling you what to do. Make a choice and stick to your guns like everything else in life.
---
- former ret pally
---
Except that this is classic and reputation matters so you cant just so w.e the hell you want
---
Just means you weren’t around when Dire maul wasn’t in game, pleb
---
Sounds like you did the absolute easiest content humanly possible to find (intentionally ignoring more difficult content?) and then are complaining its not engaging enough
---
TRUMP 101 Thinking right here, Jesus Christ
---
No. A drop down should appear as soon as the client is made available to download. May require a reboot of b.net. Did see someone say it appeared for them after a reboot.
---
In a similar vein to what made classic wow actually happen I have to promote something:
---
r/slashdiablo
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10645/gnomish-death-ray
---
I don't see it in the tooltip...
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18660/world-enlarger
---
You're right, it's also quite a loss...
---
I agree.  Even as a hunter with FD for aggro dump, I'd much prefer the tank gets the best tanking weapon possible so we can all DPS faster.
---
I just updated my client and I still do not see the thing in the dropdown menu. I also have an active WoW subscription.
---
Oh and going back to mulgore and helping full groups find fitzsprocket for that goblin smasher feels amazing
---
Your argument basically boils down to, "What if EVERYTHING WE'VE EVER KNOWN is actually wrong!?"
---
There is a fine line between optimism and delusion.
---
Everyone in a PUG raid has the same zero percent chance to loot.
---
Jokes aside, you'd want to make sure master looter is on and that you trust the person. This was one of the huge advantages of single-server worlds with limited transfer ability. Someone might abuse master looter once, but they would quickly get blacklisted.
---
I would never join a vanilla raid without master loot on.
---
Nevermind. I needed to restart the client.
---
It doesn't physically walk your character, it's just like a questing GPS.
---
That's true, I still find myself having all 5 of my bars full and everything bound as a level 60 warlock with all the macros and what not.
---
And honestly in some cases those are negligible.
---
If you're healing you're holy, because you need some of the things deep in the tree, but fuck lightwell.
---
Like I was a Marks or die Hunter back in the day. To this day BM is the enemy. At least one of the two specs was good.
---
But I also know they're functionally the same barring some tiny tweaks.
---
As someone who leveled as a holy Paladin, I know ways of making someone like you suffer.
---
God, bfa tauren models really look silly. Glad i get my original cow back
---
I just did a 1-10 hunter (pserver), and it took me 4hrs...
---
True, I may have worded it wrong BUT also mobs in classic move faster baseline than they do on private servers. Proof for this is in the list of “Reported bugs that aren’t bugs list” from blizz. 
---
So the faster baseline speed means the slow isn’t as effective against mobs but also this melee leeway thing doesn’t help either QQ.
---
I use ctrl &gt; alt for 1-4, but I use alt for QWERT.
---
Used to play in the morning after night shift - great for farming or quests, terrible for dungeons and PVP.
---
The leveling experience becomes infinitely smaller the more you play the game. The purpose of Classic is whatever you make it. If your purpose is end-game content, why not skip the first ~120 hours of the game? Especially if you’ve already done it.
---
I remember my first main was a rogue. And I wouldn't gank anyone, I was too nice for my own class. The worst i would do was sap people waiting for the boat.
---
Thinking back I should have rolled a priest.
---
I was a blacksmith. 
---
People always forgot I could make keys.
---
Tip: You can use this talent calculator:  [https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/](https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/) 
---
It also records the steps you get the talents. Its nice for leveling builds. 
---
I would go for Consecration first and then for Seal of Command.  [https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/?class=paladin&amp;talents=HBHCHDHEHFHpHqHLHMHNIUGwGxGyGzGAINIOHOHPHQHU](https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/?class=paladin&amp;talents=HBHCHDHEHFHpHqHLHMHNIUGwGxGyGzGAINIOHOHPHQHU) 
---
Consecration let you tank dungeons if you like and you can get it at level 20, exactly when you will need to do the paladin quest for the awesome 2H mace... going as a tank will be easier to do it faster. Improved seal of Righteousness along with a fast one hand will help a lot with threat, along with Consecration of course.
---
The characters haven’t aged in twenty years, I don’t think they will now, heh.
---
This is stupid. I love rogues. I love that they are the mustache twirling villains of classic wow. My issue isn't that rogues do villainous shit. My issue is that I don't understand rogues that need to be "not like other rogues". You picked the villain revel in it. Don't virtue signal about how your different.
---
1.12 was the golden age
---
Im torn between hunter and Lock for my first character.. i would prefer the lock but my first char is mainly to funnel money for my second (main) character (warrior). Either way im going alliance but i will roll a shaman on another server for sure as a 3rd char once my main is pre-raid bis
---
16GB RAM, i5-8400, GeForce GTX 1060 6GB :) unsure about the budget, looking out for a sale. Will try to stay under €200 I think!
---
Why? I’ll take help in classic at any time. I’ll pass my buffs and what not.
---
But eso the game was so easy having someone kill the monster you are fighting is quite disappointing.
---
But mobs would have to move around double your speed for hamstring to not be effective.  They aren't that fast.
---
Let me clarify a bit here - This was representative of the male Tauren model specifically. The new one is too wide and loses the feeling of being tall to me. I enjoy the original male Tauren model much more than the new one. Pixels aside, they did a disservice with the new body shape.
---
I was in an AV once, and one of the players I played with was an old grandma.  I had been in the AV with her for 14 hours straight... and I had to get some sleep.  I slept for like 6 hours, and the same AV match was going on, and she was still in it.
---
Was nuts.
---
What are you even talking about dude? And please stop shit talking, because you are really bad at it.
---
I envy mage's ice block. Because it makes them invincible and heals them. Also portals and conjure food provide convenience and source of extra income 
---
I'm not maining mage because I prefer meelee combat and they can only be damage dealers.
---
Maybe hunter
---
I remember doing this to fellow Paladins and half the time they would say "Paladins can Rez???"
---
Bitch, do your class quests.
---
I'm looking forward to giving that a shot when classic comes out. I'm not a terrible gamer and stand by what I said, but maybe going through the experience again 15 years later will reveal something to me that I didn't know/consider back then.
---
I have pretty harsh memories of leveling Warrior and didn't have any comparable problems with any other class I leveled in classic (Mage, Druid, Rogue, Hunter to max level) so I have problems accepting that I somehow gravely misplayed the Warrior. Again, looking forward to try it out.
---
Paladins also suffer more threat loss from being offtank than warrior or druid on top of everything else that has been mentioned here.
---
It probably can be done and I assume we will see someone do it. But if you go paladin with the expectation if tanking raids it will most likely be a disappointment.
---
There is already a guild that was mentioned trying to down Ragnaros before the first week reset.
---
This is what I'm saying. If your gonna be a rogue. Embrace your nature. Just do you. No need to pretend your a hero. You aren't and, if you are why pick rogue? I simply don't get it.
---
PRIVATE SERVER SCUM!
---
We used to have a guild called &lt;Peon my face&gt; until they made us change it.
---
VC is a boss and not a license plate.
---
We need Bobby B to grace us with his presence!
---
Never played pservers before a week ago and only to familiarize myself with some mechanics.
---
My knowledge comes from main tanking in Vanilla and seeing the guilds on my server that had Naxx on farm.
---
It's like they tried to balance the classes or something
---
So then you’re forced to choose spending mana on Fire Ward, which will make you go oom. My comment is a generalization, but there’s no denying Warlocks have likely about 1K more health than a mage, and a ‘bigger’ mana pool via Life Tap. So yeah, longer fights, locks have been mana management tools built-in (excluding Flasks or Pots, obv)
---
BESSIE'S TITS!
---
To be fair, if you had T3 and Naxx gear you would’ve kept that into Karazhan. 
---
You only lost that sense of progression if you didn’t “finish” Vanilla raiding. But by “finish” I mean farm Naxx until 40+ people are decked out. So the sense of progression was there, but only really available to less then 1% of the players.
---
Also Night elves can quickly earn gold by dancing on top of mailboxes
---
i always felt like shadowmeld was under used back in TBC for 2v2s. i think if we ever get a tbc old server some of the top 2v2 teams will be alliance with druid/warrior night elfs rather than the tauren/undead combo we saw so much
---
The quality of life racials for night elves are great. I wish others racials were more like that. 
---
The standing-still stealth is perfect for mind control priest shenanigans.
---
I wish there was a mod that could replace your client-side model while in certain forms with the humanoid/nelf model.  "Astral Form" was a minor glyph in retail that was introduced years ago that made your Moonkin form into a starry-textured Nelf model for example.  Would be nice to have that option if it only affected yourself and you still showed up as whatever animal to everyone else.
---
But what about when some cheeky other-faction player starts beating you to all the good farm spots? You just gonna let that happen or are you going to lay the smackdown and let it be known to all that you also banged his mom?
---
Mained a holy paladin since day 1. This is basically it.
---
It does indirectly affect it though, because mobs have “longer range aka leeway” then it takes the player longer to get out of range to perform the slow+kite method.
---
Classes don't need to be just as powerful as each other in order for skill expression to be a thing. All you need is a high skill ceiling. In fact, Imbalances in games allows for meta strategies to develop around them and causes a whole new layer of tactics a 100 % "balanced" game would lack.
---
Aside from all the other people (rightfully) telling you why this is dumb, I’ll add that time caps like that would fundamentally change player mentality for the worse. People will fixate on the best X per hour, and become toxic towards those who seemingly waste their time.
---
I sold my account in 2006 for $1,200 (had almost every warlock drop in the game) and then in like 2015 I managed to get Blizz to restore it because I'm a dick but my main had been transferred off. Smart move.
---
I know that too but I’m also the guy intentially have my characters be Disc and Balance. And half wanting to roll a melee hunter.
---
Shadowmeld is great for defending locations in BGs. Always great to ambush would be back cappers
---
Yea but do the DPS warriors stay tank spec forever then? Respec every raid night? Just for this fight? Do you constantly have EIGHT warriors in your raids leading up to Naxx? Do you switch some in for that fight? Twink Warriors maybe? 
---
I love classic with all my heart but thinking about this fight I just feel it's utterly terribly designed considering the tank situation. 1/5th of the raid spots filled with 1/8th of the classes? All of them need tank spec and tank gear? Like what do you do with 8 tank warriors the rest of the raid night? EIGHT. It's fucking insane.
---
Very much dps. 
---
The staff of westfall actually has more raw dps than smites hammer, which is BIS for the level you get it, barring potentially really expensive BOEs. 
---
But it's a very big sacrifice to take the staff of westfall, and I would absolutely not do it if I intended to run other group content. It's just much easier to replace a relatively fast, poorly itemized 2 hander than a pretty much BIS itemized pair of blue pants. 
---
For example the woodsman's sword is noticeably weaker, but not terrible and can be acquired at the same level solo, and the [orc crusher](https://classicdb.ch/?item=6093) Is just a better weapon, both in general for warrior, and for what you will be doing at that level (cleave spamming, which gets much more expensive in terms of rage, as your weapon speed increases, and it's why orc crusher is such a good weapon for a leveling warrior. It's like a guaranteed smite's mighty hammer.

Thank you so much!! I’d been wondering about this for awhile. Thanks for taking the time to answer. :)
---
Lock down a healer or aoe class in a zerg
---
Part of your original post assumes gear goes to the person who "did the best". That is a terrible loot system. In a mixed raid it should start with rolls and if a guild member wins then it can go to the guild loot system (e.g. loot council).
---
If someone is so bad they don't deserve loot then kick them from the raid with prejudice. If they did lower dps but won the roll then suck it up. That's what pugs are like.
---
I'm not saying Warriors arent the better tank, or that being a Paladin tank isn't a meme.
---
I'm just saying. They CAN do it very limited and in certain runs (Strat, Scholo) the Paladin is actually faster as they can pull an entire room and do just as much damage to them as your DPS.
---
Yes Warriors can do it as well but in those runs vs undead Paladins do it faster. This results in Paladins speedfarming Strat with aoe groups.
---
It's there only niche. So like I said, roll Pally tank if you want to, but know your limits and know your place.
---
Yeah I suppose I can see that happening.
---
Yeah but we look cooler.
---
But who waits until 60 to PvP? Ill be leveling my hunter with a PvP build. I dont want to gimp myself in BGs just so I can farm mobs faster.
---
open stress test to all players with sub
---
You didnt get in. Everyone has that now.
---
I do. , Vr
---
Playing on pservers for the last few years - I too grew tired of bear/kitty ass for hours on end, and what made it more bear-able(!) for me was adjusting my spec while leveling to incorporate more spirit into my gear, and more offensive casting into my rotation.  The extra spirit really helps open up more casting opportunities instead of reserving your whole mana pool for healing/sustain.
---
It has the same rules as hunter traps in classic. Can only be used out of combat.
---
No one should play warrior because they suck and I'm definitely playing warrior.
---
Ah, I still remember the rogue anguish when I won Felstriker on my warrior back on Nostalrius. 
---
Ofc I also remember how much fun it was to tank with it - at least when it procced.
---
Not all all. Both are DPS. Both have an upgrade from the weapon.
---
That means it's fairgame. /Roll.
---
Hi, /u/Goooose

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c28ai6/with_the_stress_test_coming_tomorrow_what_are/). 
---
it's so dumb. i dont play retail, maybe 1-2 months each new xpac but I do want it to succeed. retail and classic success aren't mutually exclusive, one definitely can help another. 
---
but the memes are always good regardless
---
Game was new then. I guarantee you if one part of the world got Classic weeks before another there would a shitstorm for weeks.
---
See you say that, but the last couple stress tests that ive played on have said "Beta &amp; Stress Test". Having just beta was a sign you got in previously. So idk if they just changed this. I got the same thing on my client though.
---
Cold sweats are starting again 😐
---
Good points, nothing like accidently rebanishing a mob for full duration in mc when it is the last one left and everyone gets mad.
---
And then get the Resurgence rod from Maraudon
---
Good call, might add those binds then
---
Doesn't matter, had sex.
---
They are using the future retail client of Classic for the upcoming stress test, not the existing beta type client.
---
With a sub? Ewww no.
---
For the Horde!
---
No, it'll be a wild and chaotic dance of Orcs and Trolls around every single Peon spawn point.
---
I'll be sure to be on the lookout for you then ;)
---
Warlocks have a threat reset, it’s called “Soulstone”.
---
Dunno how you think I'm disagreeing with you or think I'm creating disappointment. Im just playing the devil's advocate here and stating, you CAN tank dungeons but that's it and even then Wars do it better.
---
Serious raiding guilds will likely not have to worry about this issue. If the player is good then they won't care, and if they are bad then they will be benched / removed and replaced
---
where does that video come from?
---
Stadia game doesn't know who is clicking - a human or bot. Local Blizzard game may not also know but may deduce that if you have one of know botting apps somewhere on your system then you may be botting and flag you - and alike. They were very serious with the Nvidia platform and they work in pretty much the same way. Stadia may have more tech but the principles are the same. Something on those platforms isn't compatible with their anti-cheat systems.
---
My entire server did soooo....
---
Holy shock. Wear plate. Bubble. Strong stun. Lay on Hands. 
---
You're the best PvP healing class because of those things. Holy Paladins can also tack on a little extra spike damage with instant casts compared to other healers and they are very durable because of plate.
---
They can pop out of a stun or sheep with bubble and cast BoP on a non-physical DPS. You are practically invincible to rogues because of the plate and the instant heal of holy shock. Consecrate helps flush stealthers out if you take it. 
---
Your downsides are a lack of mobility, range, and sustained damage. Stay close to a Mage or Warlock for their CC and ready a stun/critical holy shock/judgement.
---
One disadvantage is that all of your spells are part of the same school. Never cast Holy Light in a situation where you might get countered or interrupted. Lure mages and rogues into interrupts by starting to cast and then immediately cancelling and casting holy shock instead.
---
Petra? That’s because it pretty much is.
---
"If you don't have one" 
---
There, now I can relate.
---
Yes I miss spelled is...fuck.

It would be fun to beat the crap out of him and claim the spot as mine, but I play with a physical disability/limitation that makes pvp difficult, so if I'm bein' real with myself, I'd run in, guns a-blazin', music cranked up like in a 2005 youtube pvp video, and then I'd die spectacularly! Embarrassingly, even. The other pvper would be a small-time streamer who was livestreaming at the time and they'd get famous off of my embarrassing mishap as two billion clips of it get posted online and then other streamers react to the clip live for more video coverage and I am even further humiliated.
---
Oops, got a bit carried away there. I guess you could say I'm pretty mediocre at pvp, so unless I find the best guild ever...I'm unlikely to roll there on purpose.
---
Seriously though, if another faction player tries beating me to the good farming spots, I snipe things from them until they get sick of my nonsense and go away. Usually. It doesn't always work but sometimes it does!
---
At 36 with kids going out, meeting people, making plans and finding the cash for events and get togethers? Fuck that noise. Sit at home, drink jack and cokes and embark on epic adventures for loot, sign me up!
---
Why? Because it isn't min/maxing? Because your world-first guild won't invite a clicker so they are ruining their chance at being your friend?
---
What is so wrong with clicking that you don't want anyone to even mention that it is an option?
---
Did clicking touch you in your no-no place?
---
All major QoL features that are part of current wow are available to classic via add-ons
---
Yeah, sure, I downloaded it too. Give me a sec, will add an image once it's uploaded.
---
Afterthought I guess? I wonder what about the character/game was an afterthought.
---
It means you are having some small effect on the community, yes. You're mixing things up. Mixing things up is the only benefit of PVP servers.
---
VC is almost acceptable to me. The part that boggles my mind is calling Dire Maul DM. What wing? I don't think I've ever seen anybody just make a group for the entire thing. 
---
It would be like saying "looking for more BRM" gonna do the whole damn mountain? Lbrs, ubrs, brd jump run and an attunement? May as well throw in MC and BWL while we're at it.
---
 Mine does not say Beta:World of Warcraft Classic
---
It just says World of Warcraft Classic
---
Classic popped up in my launcher(Not Beta, actual Classic) and upon trying to login these are the servers I can see.
---
I'm reading all quest text because I believe that lore is the most important part of WoW
---
I thought it was funny.
---
What!? I just downloaded a Pserver and got to level 5 in 44 mins......
---
MANY WHELPS, HANDLE IT
---
How many other people were in the zone while you were testing this?
---
I was actually just having fun with it. I agree and really kind of wanted to see how far shaman tanking could be taken for classic.
---
I have the same too, it's a bait again I guess
---
Yeah drop rates can be funny sometimes. I can't tell you how many times I killed the beast and never saw finkles Skinner.
---
If you can get crescent staff and wingblade quest at lvl 15 thats prolly good for horde
---
Probably one of the best posts I've seen on this page.
---
Does shadowmeld cancel out abilities in classic like it does now?
---
&gt; Is it nowadays?
---
Yes, it is. 
---
For example, Prot paladins have no access to a Taunt in Vanilla. Every other tank viable class does. Paladins do not have access to any AoE ability unless they spend 11 points into holy, which is counter intuitive if your goal is to tank.
---
Warriors and Druids both get AoE abilities for their tank specs starting at level 10 and they don't have to talent into it. 
---
The goal in Vanilla was for you to want to take the class no matter the spec so long as they brought something to the table. However, some class/spec combinations, when brought up to min/max ideals, just didn't make that feasible. 
---
&gt; Method had 9 affliction warlocks in a 20 man raid on their first kill of the most recent raid final boss and only brought 7 of the 11 classes in the game.
---
Apples to Oranges. Method is also min-maxing to the extreme and playing at a completely different level than 99.5% of the player base. They often spam one particular class because they often try to do a crazy strategy that requires crazy amounts of coordination and skill. On top of the fact that they are racing to the finish line and they all have 2-4 alts a piece for them to swap out as needed. 
---
Your average mythic raiding guild that is actually doing the content isn't doing that and doesn't have to do that. 
---
&gt; Ret paladin (from t2 onwards), moonkins and both dps shaman specs have the advantage of having fairly little gear overlap with other classes, which by itself is also an argument against bringing the 8th mage or fury warrior. 
---
The problem is that the moonkin, or ret paladin, or dps shaman isn't going to bring anything to the table that their healing counterparts don't already have. Their dps is going to be less ***by design*** than other "pure" dps classes. It's an argument ***for*** bringing that 8th mage or fury warrior.
---
That's what I am getting at here. Why take that Ret Paladin when you already have all of your blessings covered with your holy paladins? His dps is going to be less than a rogue, or a mage, or whatever.  
---
There are niche positions that some classes could theoretically get in, like having a feral druid in a single melee dps group, but having more than that would be a dps loss to the raid as a whole.
---
Doesn't Blizzard catch everyone that buys gold or buys accounts?
---
Is that the name of the wind book
---
I never really played horde or dps. I mained a holy paladin and still do. When having a secondary spec became a thing, I added prot and sword never to play ret (old school players will know the disrespect that is held for the rest paladin).
---
So I never got the joy of Barrens chat and got the crappy Alliance version in Ironforge general and Elwynn.
---
I'm thinking an undead Mage may be just what the doctor ordered.
---
Yeah I think that's what he was going for. I doubt it meant anything in particular, but if I remember 2004 correctly that name is just edgy enough to check out.
---
Warrior.  
---
The difference between an average geared warrior and one that is well geared is incredible.
---
There is a reason why guilds will gear their tank first, and that is because it makes it better/faster for everyone to get their gear, and to run raids faster/smoother.
---
They are a pain in the ass, but totally worth the effort if you have the time.
---
if you don't want to put that much effort into it, play a mage.
---
Can’t imagine they intended people to see the number of servers, unless this is somehow part of the test.  Perhaps testing how it works with folks on multiple realms this time?

LIES!!

The chausses of westfall, as compared to the best reasonable alternative you can have at that level (goblin mail pants, which the shipbuilders in deadmines drop), is about +30 armor, +7 strength, +2 stamina. Which is 1 dps plus 30 armor and 2 strength. It's a huge sacrifice to give up those pants, as I note in another post on this thread, because they are so irreplaceable, whereas the staff of westfall is very replaceable. Probably replaceable at level 22 if you kill tharil'zun. 
---
I have absolutely run around with the emberstone staff, because often, it's just not a big sacrifice for your group to give it to you. Last time I got it, I was running with 2 clothies that were visibly wearing their own, clearly spamming the dungeon trying to get the stirring rod. Our 2 rogues were fine with me needing it when absolutely no other 2 handers dropped. 
---
Last night, I 4 manned deadmines with a hunter, druid, and paladin. The druid got smites. If emberstone staff would have dropped, do you think anyone would have been mad if I had rolled need? 
---
I know they wouldn't have, because I discussed it with them while we were flying to westfall. It didn't drop and I got the taskmaster's axe, but the emberstone staff is MUCH better than the staff of westfall. 
---
Not only does it give you 50 more health, but the dps difference is more than made up for by the chausses. The emberstone staff is very legit. The staff of westfall is a very costly consolation prize that is mainly for solo levelers.
---
It could happen

These servers are for tomorrow's stress test. Not necessarily the exact same configuration as Classic will go live with.
---
Most likely just the latest stress test as they said it'd be available to download today. Everyone with an active sub is able to play this stress test.
---
That said, mine doesn't say Beta it just says "World of Warcraft: Classic" - but I already did the battle.net update so see if it changes after that. Where it says Region/Account is different for me and has two drop downs one for Version and one for Account.
---
Good, then you'll join a guild that accepts fire mages pre-AQ and I'll join one that won't.
---
Yup. As what I hope to be water cooler number 8 in my guilds weekend team, I assume I will get gear, eventually. and thats fine.
---
Warrior or Hunter? warrior or Hunter? Warrior or HunteR?
---
&gt; Why? Because it isn't min/maxing?  
---
ya
---
&gt; Because your world-first guild won't invite a clicker so they are ruining their chance at being your friend?
---
uh huh  
---
&gt; What is so wrong with clicking that you don't want anyone to even mention that it is an option?
---
baddddd
---
&gt; Did clicking touch you in your no-no place?
---
also ya
---
I'm sure they cool, but I ain't clicking all that shit
---
Breathtaking
---
Also worth noting that riding skill won’t be in Classic, so it’s going to be 800g for each mount, meaning 800g for your first epic mount at 60 and another 800g to buy another faction’s mount.
---
Resto shaman can just place a wf totem aswell
---
Alternatively there is a photo album style which can be viewed at  [http://www.cbmason.ca/ScreenshotAlbums/Vanilla/](http://www.cbmason.ca/ScreenshotAlbums/Vanilla/)
---
The grind is real in vanilla. Leveling an alt is a major undertaking compared to Retail. With nostalgia coming from older players, the reality is likely that having two vanilla toons of significant level is not really on option with life responsibilities.
---
Great guide would love to see it from other classes PoV
---
Ill read them for sure.
---
I believe the best addition was being able to easily switch specs. Expands options for my characters. Pick protection when I want to run dungeons, arms when I want the true warrior experience, and fury if I like like killing by just spamming blood thrist
---
And Blizzard would just ignore it.
---
Useless? Rogues are top tier dps in raids with fury warriors.
---
Dwarf priest is essential. Need that fear ward
---
Yeah I'm pretty sure you're right. It's still there and all, but broken of course.

That’s actually a good idea - could get rid of the boring stuff

Super Best Friends - Alliance US (EST) PVE - Family/Raiding
---
Synopsis: Super Best Friends was originally created in TBC to house real life friends in our new leveling experience. During a Zul'farak run, where my prot paladin had a newly-acquired Flurry Axe, I impressed some randoms with my 1337 Dps and invited them into the guild. This bloomed and soon we had many friends of friends of friends! Now I come back 12 years later, having tracked down a number of those friends and decided to try my hand again at running a guild.
---
Focus: Leveling and PVE - While we don't frown upon PVP, and frankly I probably enjoy it the most out of our team, we will mostly be focusing on raids, using a system of DKP which fits our playstyle.
---
Playstyle: Casual/Raid Focused - Let's be honest, we're not in college anymore, and most of have full time lives, working or taking care of our families, or both. I know I have a daughter on the way, and plenty of us have responsibilities. However, we are all WoW veterans and have a good understanding of Vanilla raiding. Wed/Thurs 6pm-10pm(11pm if progression) EST.
---
Are we a good fit? - We are a guild with realistic outlooks towards the game. We all want to raid and enjoy the magic that is Vanilla WoW together, but within the appropriate scheduling of our real lives. We are also older now, which isn't a requirement, but understand that most of the guild to start will be around 30+. We are not going to have squabbles over nonsense, be relaxed while enjoying what the game has to offer. We will joke and kid around, but if anyone starts to bother another, it will be dealt with appropriately.
---
If Interested Contact Me Directly. Thank you for reading this post.
---
Those people have so much more faith in humanity than I do.
---
Yeah its showing that for everyone. I was in the previous stress test and I have both Beta as well as World of Warcraft Classic. Looks like they have it available for download / are making realms.
---
https://imgur.com/a/hH0QiVd
---
Yes, but even in video games faction pride exists.
---
That client is for the stress test tomorrow and the eventual release.
---
Allways look at it like this. "If i was really there in fantasy word and i can be one class i would be....
---
(No matter how OP or bad class is).
---
Still cant decide between 2 classes? 
---
Do a simple mind trick. Toss a coin. When you see what you got, if you feel a little disapointment chose the other class, if not take the one you got.
---
Well it starts at 2pm but you have access for 48 hours so you get some time after work I guess....
---
Take what small comforts you can, young one.

It linked correctly in the editor. [https://www.reddit.com/r/woooosh](https://www.reddit.com/r/woooosh)
---
The real question
---
How exactly do you rest your left hand on the keyboard?  Using WASD for movement, hit shift with your pinkie and Z with thumb.  It really isn't that awkward with a little practice.
---
Keep in mind too that not every keybind needs to be super comfortable and intuitive;.  I remember decursing on my Mage in Vanilla with 5; even though it's not super intuitive, when that's literally all I'm doing in a fight it doesn't really matter.  Flamestrike is another good example.  Doesn't see much use in PvP, and in PvE it's not something that requires super quick reactions like, say, Ice Block or Blink.
---
On another note, you could try remapping your movement keys to ESDF to make room to the left for additional keybinds.
---
This is good to hear. Whilst not identical - my new laptop has a 3700U in it which has Vega 10.
---
I'm not expecting to be able to max out the game but playing on Medium would be acceptable.
---
Just roll mage like 99% of everyone else.
---
I get no realms are currently available.
---
Yeah but you better have group lead.. otherwise you're going to get kicked for being stingy af lol
---
Charge you phone, you fucking savage.
---
Mages, Rogues and Warriors all had fairly comfortable lives in PVE throughout Vanilla
---
Rogue is top tier in PvE and PvP. You're convinced.
---
I just want to you tell me which fight that is? Through evocation, gems, mana pots and demonic runes. Mages won't oom anytime soon unless the player is slacking, at which poin this discussion is pointless.
---
Ofc they would, they’re really good at that.
---
This is simply the number of realms available tomorrow.
---
I could be wrong so don't hang me if I am but, I actually think he might be right. World firsts on pve servers might actually not count but, I could be remembering wrong.
---
My problem with mage is there's gonna be a metric asston of people paying them. Just way more than needed.
---
Gonna be nice if you need a portal somewhere I guess
---
I think you're very much along the lines of our ranks in Super Best Friends, send me a message and also check out about us below :)
---
Weren't you just trying to play the "lol im an epic troll and i love tears" card? Get your shit straight you societal reject

Ret does more than DPS though, which is the whole point. Its more a support class, not healer, tank or dps. And it is one of the best at it. Ret would be OP if it could do as much damage as other pure dps classes.
---
So if Blizzard would ignore an entire region crying for access to a game already available in another region, what makes you think they’ve even given your desire to preemptively download the client so you can reserve your name 10 minutes sooner a single thought?
---
Feral main tank is viable. It's just not optimal. So it doesn't apply their. 
---
Other then that. Ele Shaman because they chuck lightning.
---
Not much else to talk about right now.
---
&gt;Deadmines will be a challenge to complete. 
---
I distinctly remember doing that at level 11. It was difficult and challenging, but doable with a competent group and testing the encounters and pulls with careful respect.
---
Not reading the quest is like ejaculating without sex.
---
Lok’Tar Ogra!

&gt; Where it says Region/Account is different for me and has two drop downs one for Version and one for Account.

https://i.imgur.com/m0FyUoz.png
---
Payo ofc. The salty gentleman rouge
---
Even if other classes have more dps in theory, raid till aq and I assume naxx never needed everyone to be at their max dps to be doable.
---
I have an old vanilla account that I assumed was gone but I may as well try tosee if its salvageable. I forget if vanilla accounts were tied to a specific username or to an e-mail account?
---
Haha, I don't watch a ton of South Park. Have they ever done a "Future" episode where the characters are grown up or anything?
---
FMLA
---
Good point
---
You're not the kinda player I'd want to replace.  With 40 people in an average raid, you're gonna have a bell curve of skill with players.  Every raid I have been in had at least a few dipshits who never listened/never brought consumables/etc.  I'd take an optimal player in an unoptimal spec every day of the week than a knuckle dragger playing a more optimal spec.  Vanilla raids are paradoxically quoted as being super easy but also requiring 100% optimal composition with zero players allowed to stray from the norm.
---
Great idea I support this idea 100% very cool Poodle!
---
For those that plan to no life it please get up and rest every once in a while.  People have died from no lifing this game and ill be really sad if it happens to any of you.  Just getting up to stretch at the very least every few hours and try to shoot for every hour.  Just a couple minutes is all I ask.  It'll help you maintain focus too.
---
Should have mentioned it alliance for us haha
---
Clearly you did not comprehend my post. So I’ll make it clear. 
---
-I enjoy min maxing and will do so. But don’t expect everyone I play with to do so. 
---
-Min maxing is also not required to clear content. 
---
-People will successfully clear content without min maxing.
---
Was on the fence about including feral tank. Do they have a taunt in vanilla? Can't recall.
---
The race unlocks are based on previous content, so depending on what you did in previous xpacs, it may be easier than for others.
---
What are you talking about?  Soulstone is great threat reduction....
---
Ice block doesn’t heal in vanilla :)
---
Got nothing? I'm pretty sure almost everyone here knows of Nost and their efforts.
---
yoo thats dope, yea was planning on horde too. sending u a pm
---
All fun is valid.
---
It's a stress test.
---
Would make sense since anyone with a sub can join in.  Wonder if starter zones are playable with the population spread across 21 servers?
---
We could also test the streamer server theories.  See how different the one is where they go, or if they choose to hide it, etc.
---
Meme is hatching
---
Yesum.
---
Forum polls, surveys and the general fact they're the most ability equipped to be the complete tank.
---
Didn't work, made sure it was case sensitive. Add me @Phenotyx#4544
---
I'm curious how laptops variants related to the desktop ones... but the Vega 8 desktop at 3440x1440 on mode 4 was 80+ FPS :\]
---
1-10 in 2 hours is usually the norm
---
Yeah you’ll usually have near 8 warriors in your raid comp, warrior DPS is no joke. I know at least four warriors need to be tank spec, I don’t think all warriors have to be though. I definitely could be wrong. It’s been quite a while since I’ve raided Naxx
---
The fight is memorable that’s for sure, but don’t knock it yet. It’s a way to weed out the non-autonomous raiders in your guild. And at least Blizzard was going for something other than the normal tank and spank, obviously they found their own rhythm more in TBC.
---
My server alliance Stonemaul US called it VC all through vanilla.
---
I see someone has never played dota 2
---
Right? If I wanted to pay to skip content, I'd just pay nothing and skip it all. People who buy 60s are cancer that feed Chinese organ harvesters.
---
More evidence and more instances of a bug occurring helps the resolution of said bug.  And the streamer doesn't already necessarily know about those other instances.
---
Ret pally.  Just real life Leroy shit all the time.  It'd be fun I think as well.
---
I chose the most populated beta server to play on, but there's a real lack of people leveling up and certainly no way to mimic launch day conditions. In the guide I do mention specific quests that have a higher priority of completion, and others you can skip if crowded in order to not get stuck early on, as well as giving a variety of options for grinding locations if the primary ones are crowded. Hopefully that will give people an idea of what to prioritize when the area is more crowded.
---
Swords Rogues put out tons of damage, they're always wanted.
---
Ffxi is up there
---
My five closest friends and four other fairly good friends are all rolling a on a server together, my social life is transforming into WoW!
---
I've been ninja looted in a pug raid before (was mostly one guild running it).  Ever since then just felt like there was no point in pug raiding unless you are face rolling the content.  No point in spending repair costs/consumables when you can't trust the people.
---
Except he did.  And the priest dropped the flag because he asked them to.
---
Lanuch it and check.
---
mouuuuuse clickers paradise.
---
Dual spec by far, such a great way to enjoy the versatility of hybrid classes
---
Would be a huge waste for your guild not to bring rogues as they would have a lot of gear drops not being taken advantage of.
---
Also all of the top parses include maximum world buffs which benefit warriors a lot more.
---
I don't know about that.
---
The pre T1 BiS Dwarven Hand Cannon has 32.76 DPS
---
The best ranged weapon ever Nerubian Slavemaker has 57.19 DPS
---
Meanwhile the warrior's pre T1 BiS 1h weapons have about 40 DPS, and the Naxx ones have about 73 DPS
---
So I don't know, maybe hunters should get some 70 dps ranged weapons.
---
I know, I was joking because /camp is one of the oldest WoW traditions to fuck with noobs. You've never seen someone say what I said in trade chat? Or someone asks the command for something in trade and you troll them by replying /camp and logging them out?
---
If you have a dropdown entry that just says World of Warcraft Classic that is for the upcoming stress test and eventual release.
---
If the dropdown says Beta: World of Warcraft Classic AND has a clickable play button you have access to the beta.
---
Vanilla wow is about your place in the world.
---
Its why both Arena Gear and Flying Mounts were bad.
---
I recently learned the legendary Leroy video was actually a recreation of the event done after the fight. Life has been shambles since.
---
I'd love to find out I was lied to
---
If you are trying to speedrun yeah
---
Correction: 99 of them are bank alts
---
Boomkin or Enhance Shaman. I was the buffs they bring to be viable cause I like playing support.
---
Honour is for saps and saps are for sapping.
---
Well said
---
I've been spending more time with my family and trying to work out on a regular basis. I've basically quit video games in the last month. When classic comes out, I want to have built up as much wife aggro resistance potions that I can spend 4 hours a night on Classic for a couple months. I'm kidding myself though, everyone knows wife aggro resistance potions don't work.
---
No PvP realms
---
Posted this already but I joined a "pug" that was run by a guild.  Got an item ninja looted by the guild when I was one of the top dps on the fight.  Never joining a pug raid again.
---
Hah... Hah...
---
If love to see a full side-by-side comparison of models and animations for each race
---
**This is a nice knife.  I'm keeping it.**
---
 Oomkin because bres is always nice and 3% crit for 3-4 mages also helps.
---
If you have an active sub you can reserve your name about 2 weeks prior to launch. Blizzard confirmed this.
---
Yes, but actually no it's opposite
---
Seems like you'd enjoy twisting totems :D
---
No PvP realms, dont think so.
---
Real talk: 21 (maybe 22) realms seems like a solid number to start.
---
Stress test
---
This is how I was always told to play mine. My raid leader had me spec 30 into Holy to be able to basically heal forever, and melee with seal of wisdom or light up, whichever they needed at the time.
---
Feral is viable and will be in raids.
---
Id go Boomkin though
---
21 different realms.
---
Obviously not talking about serious raiding guilds.
---
What a selfless decision :D They are the only ones that provide the crit buff I believe, right?
---
&gt; But it does matter. Its the tanks job to hold aggro not yours.
---
Wasn't trying to hold aggro.
---
&gt; Dps using high threat abilities makes things harder on the tank and healer.
---
As stated numerous times, the tank never lost threat and the mobs never ran at healer.
---
&gt;If you want smooth runs and people to group with you again don't do it. If you don't care don't expect people to care about you.
---
The run was as smooth as can be. We only rested once before a boss. 
---
So, like I said, your post lacks a lot of valuable or even constructive material.
---
I was referencing DnD where there isn’t really a meta for designing characters, but I get what you mean.
---
Having to carry two sets of armor and sinking all of your gold into respecs.
---
I don’t feel like carrying meme specs through instances because someone gets a boner from handicapping themselves. I doubt I’m in the minority. 
---
Inb4 “then don’t play with them”. I’ll try to limit it as much as possible, but I doubt I can avoid them completely. I wouldn’t mind if every spec became viable at some point in the future, and I don’t buy that doing so would ruin the game or instantly result in LFG tools or whatever.
---
https://youtu.be/RjMgi8dAXtw
---
That video breaks it down a bit more, that gent goes into the 6 or so Warlock PvP specs that are out there, and describes why Soul Link is the mightiest of them. Keep in mind — SL is almost a PvP-only spec, so to be able to PvP and Raid in one spec, you’ll want to go 30/0/21, but if that’s not an issue, SL is just a disgusting amount of damage reduction that lets you outlast pretty much every class (though I’d be curious as to who wins in SL lock vs. 0/30/21 Hybrid Druid, heh).
---
I sure hope not.
---
I don't really like to DPS outside of questing/leveling so all of these are pretty unappealing for me. Feral tank is viable, and I'd probably pick it because of that alone compared to the rest.
---
I'd have to pick something I've tried to play and actually enjoyed leveling as. Enhance shaman was fun 1-30 when I tried it on a pserver. I could probably make it work if I was able to focus on support/utility, but I really can't be bothered with DPS meters and all that.
---
Oh I know I would! I just also know I'm a good healer and will be forced into that haha
---
Oh wow. I forgot how "bitey" they looked.
---
I support this idea 100% 
---
very great idea Maxamos!
---
This 100 times over
---
&gt; Having just beta was a sign you got in previously
---
No it wasn't, I have access it said "Beta &amp; Stress Test: Wow Classic" for me 55 minutes ago, it now says Beta: Wow Classic
---
My vote....server mcserverface
---
Ignoring the rest of your post, your title is an outright lie. Vanilla is the most gear dependent meta and vanilla has the biggest gear gap between raiding players and other players. If you want to enjoy the game on a PvP server, you have to raid, it's just a fact. Even if you're not raiding Naxx, you almost certainly have to do some amount of raiding just to stay relevant in PvP.
---
OK, so that'll easily handle 1080P/60FPS for Classic and probably something like 1080p/120FPS would be reasonable. I'm not super experienced with monitor purchases so I can't recommend a specific model, but I'd look for a display that is 1080P and capable of 120 to 144 Hz (refresh rate), as opposed to the older/more common refresh rate of 60 Hz. I don't think the GTX 1060 6GB will be able to play most games at 1440P or higher, though it *might* be able to play Classic at 1440P. I'd say to stick with the 1080P resolution, but aim for a higher refresh rate (120/144 Hz).
---
I have both but it just shows a realm screen when I load the game.

You can do that on Retail foo then?
---
I am literally raised by WoW players. 
---
Back in 2006 i started playing as 12-13 year old. I used to play Runescape and I wanted membership, but then a friend of my dad told my dad that WoW is much cooler for 6 euro more a month.
---
So that's how it begun. I created my own account and after a while, my dad got interested and made his warrior on my account.. He then played so much i couldn't play anymore, so he made his own account and transfered his character to his account..
---
Then my mom did the same on my dads account and we ended up with 3 accounts in the house :D
---
I'll be glad to tell you that now 13 years later im 26 and I will be leveling with my dad again on release to relive the nostalgic. (my mom likes to take it easy)
---
Excuse my English, it is not my first language. And i thought some of you would like to read this story :)
---
I knowwww, I became a casual over the years.
---
We have years of raiding in classic with plenty of theorycrafting and real experience to know it's not optimal...
---
I remember him that's where I got my Tabard of the Flame. I doubt we will see him.

Also, the awareness to equip a shield.

I'm sure I'll get a lot of crap for this, but in many ways raiding can be the worst time you'll have playing the game.  Farming consumes so you can get wiped all week great!  Guild drama over gear great!  Main tank is getting yelled at by mom for 30 minutes, so you sit around doing nothing great!
---
Clearing raids and getting your tier gear is the best feeling, but it comes at a big price.  Enjoy leveling.
---
He's probably joking about how Paladins used to have 5 minute buffs and no greater blessings at one time.
---
First off, its against terms of service and second, go play BFA if you want to skip the leveling experience. Classic is about socializing, not your need for end game glory. All the people who committed to get Bliz to remake classic wanted the social scene while leveling. That's how end game guild develop, by leveling together and SOCIALZING!!! try it sometimes.
---
Ive never heard a complaint about arena gear..
---
I can't get this to load (Tweet removed?) so I'm removing this post. ModMail us if I made a mistake.

Alliance Shaman, Horde Paladins.
---
I think you mean playing the way for the most focused results. Because maybe fun is the best result.
---
You mean the sub that is required to play Classic once it launches?
---
Yea look I don't knock it. Not at all. I just think it's a hell of a weird design to require 1/5 of the raid to be a specific class.
---
The fight was surely one of the most intense ever, but REQUIRING class stacking like this is just not really cool. I mean I can live with it, but it's something they rightfully never did again and if they ever add content to vanilla I hope they don't suddenly design a fight that requires 8 Druids or something like that.

If I could tank on a paladin I'd tank on a paladin 
---
but I can't so I will play something else, maybe a priest healer but probably a warlock or a mage
---
I feel like I have repeated the same thing 3 times now. Hiding any cheating apps from the wow process is super easy. So they will only have the way you interact with the game to see if you are cheating. Exactly the same as if you were playing on Stadia.

I 100% agree - and I hope that people explore what they find fun about Classic by experimenting and discovering that themselves, rather than by reading **xXxGodOfWar's LEVELING AND DPS GUIDE** because they feel pressured into doing so.

I got a weekend. We can do a BRM run!

title, i originally had stress test &amp; beta: world of warcraft Classic and a few weeks later got this.
---
Yeah sounds like a good fit.
---
Is there a discord yet? Looking to have group lined up for launch.  All join same server and whatnot.
---
Neat, then we'll both join a guild that doesn't accept those fire mages and we'll let other guilds do as they please.

It would have to be epics only, otherwise everyone would flock to the legendary servers.

PvP Gear and Arena is good though. Flying is bad.

WTF are you talking about. This is about illegal purchasing of 60 character accounts. And any classic fanatic knows Fortnite is a dumpster fire of Gen X not being able play the ORIGNAL difficulty that games used to offer.

Ao they’re just called classic?
---
Currently in beta I have a great mix of turning off instant quest text so I read the quests when I pick them up and using questie to assist with finding things. 
---
If you really want to go full vanilla use both but I'm really liking no instant quest text because after hearing the reasons about it from Mark Kern I can see it's benefits. 
---
Just be careful of quests you pick up from objects in the world, if there are hostiles around they could interrupt you and you have to read the whole thing again
---
I played the game?
---
I'm not talking about in raids, since when you're buffed the fuck out BT is amazing, but when out soloing before you gear up imp slam is awesome.
---
Retpally with Spelladin build!  
---
Metacultists must burn in the Shadow-Holy-Chilli fire!
---
@Nizeth
---
Go home, you’re drunk.
---
&gt; If you want to enjoy the game on a PvP server, you have to raid, it's just a fact
---
I can't begin to describe how out of touch this is. You don't have to be the best player to enjoy yourself. It's a game, man - the competitive aspect is there if you choose to play that way, but you by no means have to.
---
Classic is 1.13, it's always been that.
---
Subscriber growth has dropped to the level it was pre-beta announcement.
---
Nah man better quality water means less drinking and less downtime. When I played a mage in vanilla people loved my crystal water
---
Really?  Arena gear was like one of the top complaints about wow from 2007 to 2009.
---
One theory is that it has to do with spell batching and Spirit of Redemption.
---
Batch starts  
---
Priest takes damage, dropping him below zero.  
---
Priest is flagged as dead.  
---
But wait, the priest doesn't die like a normal player. Instead, Spirit of Redemption should activate.  
---
Priest heals himself, bringing HP to positive values.  
---
Flag player as alive.  
---
Batch Ends
---
So, the priest is alive but has Spirit of Redemption at least partially activated. Spirit of Redemption has 1 HP and can't take damage.
---
But said you were using it so that if the tank lost agro the mob would go for you instead of the healer. 
---
That contradicts what you just said. 
---
Also the fact that the tank didn't lose aggro doesn't me he wasn't having to dump more rage into sunders for each mob to hold aggro. 
---
You should try tanking sometime.
---
Not meaning this in an insulting way, but I could see it. I did this once myself for a different sub (r/murderedbywords, and it was about a researched and sourced comment about how much CP was probably in the world because somebody said they doubted there were GBs of it), and I got bugged about it. We all gotta learn somehow lol
---
Lol, please gimme a chart explaining it plz.
---
Especially since loot trading will be in the game. So the 30 guildies can collude and have 5 people roll so that 1 gets the item.
---
I have both options yet the Beta: World of Warcraft Classic play button is greyed out.

gotta break the chain somehow
---
Honest question, how does Night Elf stack up against the only other race that can be a druid, Tauren, from a min-max perspective.
---
I'd be surprised if this doesnt exist,  but I'll work on making an updated,  all encompassing one for YouTube this week for you :) been trying to find something to sink some time into.
---
Okay aside from resilience which was an overall problem tho?
---
Can you play the game right now?
---
F\*\*\* you! China namba waan, Taiwan namba toow, and US namba nein... okay!?!?!
---
We need to make a petition to enable Bobby B Bot here. Seriously.
---
You don't get to gatekeep what Classic is about or what people want out of the game. Plenty of guilds will form with players that never leveled together and plenty of guilds will recruit players they never leveled with.
---
There's absolutely no difference to a guild between someone that buys an account and someone that transfers realms.
---
Could be because I don't have an active sub?
---
You have beta
---
Zandalari are all in BfA. But what I was missing was that he had already earned the rep needed for the race. They became available after 8.1 and he probably stopped playing before then, even though he had already done most of the work toward unlocking them
---
Actual Beta. Stress test on mine just says World of Warcraft Classic.

Can't wait for season 2, guys.
---
Getting new gear is welcome.  Getting greens from trash that obliterate your epic loot from raids feels bad.
---
Not true, I've been reading it all in beta and there's actually a lot of great lore and story especially when you're playing messenger to NPCs. It's quite interesting and it varies themes a lot as you progress through zones.
---
You know what? Don't even listen to those buzz kills. They were probably hurt badly by someone and can't help projecting about it online. Repost your own comments all you like dude. I liked this post. Lok'Tar Ogar Bitch!
---
So far I’ve completed 1 of 2 goals. Got my transfer at work so now I make more money and my 2nd goal is to buy a $1000 pc before classic drops. Couple more weeks and I’ve accomplished both. 
---
Might set a few more goals just to keep myself occupied till launch.
---
Not even. There's almost nothing to do at these levels
---
Thanks for buying my old pc
---
No respecs in Outside unfortunately. But if you grind enough reputation with certain religions, you unlock the ability to Re-roll as a new character upon death.
---
Play is greyed out? Probably a bug
---
hold on there, cowboy! 16 debuff slot limit.
---
Damn you are bad
---
Oh, you're like a WoW Celeb! Classic Hype? Or still committed to 8.2?
---
Who said it was a warrior tank? The number of assumptions you people make is absurd.
---
Panic!!!!
---
sure, if u want dozens of layers
---
I could, for whatever reason though people are latching onto that, it's just one little thing that comes standard that builds on the mountain that is the superior game.
---
Pretty sure that's in preparation for the public stress test
---
&gt; And I'm pretty sure they said it was going to be 1.12 at the start.
---
1.13 uses 1.12 as a base, yes.
---
Saving this for later. This looks like a good community.
---
Its against terms of service and considered illegal and theres no realm transfers. I'm not saying to anyone you can't do it. You do it and get banned, that's a laugh for me. I'm just warning people who make it to end game and this problem arises.
---
I double checked, Durrian#1563 
---
but I sent you a friend request nonetheless! See you in August friend!
---
I think I'm wrong i remember it post nerf  so i dont know now
---
Which blows my mind. Like, you are basically taking a shower every time you sit down! It’s fantastic.
---
No, I'm leaning toward a PvP server.
---
They are also bis for fury warriors (human especially)
---
How did it run during regular leveling and in cities? I don't think I had a single framedrop during the 20ish levels I played on a private server. This is desktop tho, which has significantly higher single thread clock and iGPU performance compared to a T420.
---
I think you drastically underestimate how good improved over power is, esp as it synergises with natural weapon choice (slow) and deep wounds.
---
Improved rend is also fantastic for levelling.
---
Going 2/2 improved rend with 3/5 parry in the first tier of arms is definitely on par with cruelty.
---
Arms also gives clear access to tactical mastery, a key talent for tanking, pvp and well... just being a warrior.
---
Heroic strike is rarely worth the range. Grinding down a mob with white hits and rend is optimal, followed by a double pull with cleave.
---
A standard 31/20 arms / fury build is optimal to 60.
---
That early bag drop. OP. I didnt get one on beta till the AH =/

But who was whirlwind axe
---
I've seen a few one-offs but nothing comprehensive. If you end up doing it, I'll be excited to see!

It was always VC on Burning Blade (Alliance).

Is a sub needed for this?
---
Relive some of those WC3 games!
---
Wait wtf
---
Oh we finally arrived at the carrying. 
---
None of them likely ever planned on coming near you guys, but since you actually are the minority you might not have a choice at some point. 
---
You know, kind of exactly like it was during vanilla
---
Approaching 22k? That's way too high for vanilla. In Skarm's video main-tanking KT as a feral druid, right around [4:51](https://youtu.be/n70syHDWfr4?t=290) you can see his armor count at ~14.5k. That's after popping an armor potion.
---
same. did i get jebaited and i dont get to play for real or?
---
It’s not awesome because it resets your auto
---
There’s no loot council in a pug, if that’s what you’re thinking. Everyone rolls regardless of performance, usually main-spec trumps off-spec and specific items might be reserved. 
---
Other than that, it’s trust and usually consequences. People learn to avoid those who host pugs and scam participants.
---
Great guide man. Theres a serious lack of horde powerleveling and itd be sick if you started streaming since youre clearly knowledgable. Would seriously watch and copy the entire 10-20, 20-30 etc. Curious on your best times too.
---
It's the opposite in-game. Alliance is left and Horde is right. What you described is exactly what OP did..
---
Weren't you just trying to play the "lol im an epic troll and i love tears" card? Get your stupid troll shit straight. 
---
No one wants to PM you, no matter how much you crave interaction.
---
Pally/Mage is perfect. I leveled 1-50 or so with a Mage friend.
---
thank you people like you do motivate me
---
When did the nerf hit?
---
In the P server I'm on, I believe my Wing Clip while leveling was only 5% stronger than Hamstring (50% vs. 55%).  That's not a whole lot of difference.
---
The problem with rogues is stealth is not conducive to team play. 
---
It doesn't matter how sneaky the rogue is, sir clankzalot will get the party noticed. So either the rogue is going solo or stealth doesn't matter.
---
Who TF would you call a dungeon by its last boss name lol.
---
No it is not, I have just a starter account with no sub and got the download
---
Ya if you can get some high level friends to help you obtain WW axe right at level 30 then you can hold onto that for a few levels longer than most weapons, but you're still going to be replacing it rather quickly with something like Grimlok's Charge
---
Stress test i think
---
Mine has said the same since friday with a greyed out "play"
---
I got you [covered](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=6346) bro!
---
Are you the kind of person that prefers to be stunlocked--&gt;killed by a rogue and calls it balanced? You probably find modern arena unfun because you have no idea what is going on.
---
In a 1v1 fight people die just as they used to in every expansion.
---
indeed they are! Forgot about them :P Basically for every warrior except Orcs.
---
When I played on private servers I saw an isolated mage regain all health and Mana through ice block
---
/r/kenm
---
Will it be playable for non subs is what i meant to ask
---
I don’t care what you saw.
---
And what server?
---
I’m vanilla, ice block doesn’t heal.
---
He was likely healed by another player whilst in ice block.
---
Depends on the day. If I'm in the mood to immerse myself, yes. If I had a long day and just want to get a level done before going to bed, then probably not.
---
Maybe someone chose rogue because they want to spy on the other faction (lore-wise) and therefore always stay hidden. I dont see how it can be so difficult to understand that people will interpret the purpose of classes differently which in turn will affect the way they decide to play the game.
---
He does stream his leveling runs actually! His twitch is: twitch.tv/cauthonluck :)
---
WHO NAMED YOU? SOME HALFWIT WITH A STUTTER??
---
I thought that was the case prior to TBC.
---
Prot pally MT.  Was OT up to AQ40 and Naxx trash.  Got my chance on a couple battles.  It’s slower, and likely wouldn’t work with time sensitive fights, but prot pallys can put in work if you have competent companions.
---
He's 150% committed to Classic WoW. No 8.2 here :/
---
Elysium and thier was no healers near him
---
You said you will be replacing your weapon every 6 hours ww axe can ve acquired at 36 and last as long as 6 levels
---
Thats far longer than 6 hours
---
This might not be responding to you directly, but to a lot of people talking about fun and balance in games. I think a lot of people have a twisted idea of balance that leads to undervaluing the immense and important job that game designers do to balance the game, and putting balance and fun as opposites somehow.
---
Balance doesn't have to mean things being "equally powerful in all situations", it means that everything has a purpose and a situation where it's worth using over any other option. That's still very difficult to achieve, and Vanilla devs surely have put a lot of time and effort into balancing and the math behind it. They didn't do perfectly, but those efforts were still very important for making Vanilla WoW a success that it was. 
---
Balance is important. You can't just throw things in the game randomly for the sake of fun and call it a day.
---
Would you rather hard counter rogues, ferals, warriors, hunters, and warlocks or have stationary stealth in pvp?
---
well if you for some reason have 130k on retail across all characters you can resub for gold
---
Well, [you're dead wrong about Realm Transfer](https://youtu.be/O3b423uqrdo?t=554).
---
And it's not illegal. There's no crime committed.
---
There are websites that have sold thousands of accounts. Blizzard never knows unless you let the secret out.
---
Totally agree. I was in a few guilds where most of us were willing to repeat content. Hell we did it for fun. So a little turnover was fine. 
---
In later WOTLK, there were several times when people would use us to gear up and then just gquit, costing us a lot of time and investment we were hoping would pay off in raids. 
---
I suspect this will be less prevalent in classic because the mechanisms that make it easy to get away with this are not being added to classic (cross-realm removing lack of server community accountability, group finder making it easier to queue up even if you've burned all your bridges, personal loot mitigating the pain of someone running off with gear they don't need.)
---
I definitely gonna roll on Skinning Knife server
---
Patch 1.9 introduced greater blessings.
---
Truefaith, more healing, more mana regen and more HP

The stress test is only open to America and Oceania accounts, not EU sadly.

Well I was able to download and log in, none of the realms are available since it doesn't start till tomorrow. Won't know officially until it starts!
---
What kind of support does Ret provide that Holy doesn't?
---
They have said no
---
Mostly the pace.;
---
Missing Battlegrounds.;
---
No arena system.;
---
The viable classes.;
---
The variety of classes.;
---
The powerlevel of healers.;
---
The duration of certain crowd control abilites (20s sheep for example).;
---
Mana is a resource not just for the healers.;
---
Some PVE items are insanely overpowered (currently COS items are the same in retail arena, but most of the time these get nerfed quickly).;

I was in a guild where we would kick people for not having their consumable buffs
---
Do you think it would skew representation of certain classes on those realms? More melee on Sulfuras? More hunters on every server?
---
Stay away from da voodoo!
---
&gt;The are pretty much just healers~~ or DPS~~.
---
ftfy
---
no, im not subbed and i cant click play
---
i wasnt sure because im not subbed
---
are you subbed?
---
Hey man, checked ya out and I don't think the guild is for me. Definitely going to try going Balance Druid just for the sheer novelty of it and as of right now I'm not looking for dedicated raid days.
---
Stress test starts tomorrow, almost assured thats what this is
---
As I said, they can have 3 versions of every server name (Malganis A, B, C). Those who started on Malganis will remain on Malganis after all 3 versions merge. Character name restriction can happen across 3 versions. So again I ask, why are they not doing this if it costs the same ?
---
FOR THE HORDE!!!
---
Yes you can. Anyone can hit R10 just by playing AV a couple hours a day. R11 and beyond is where the real challenge begins.
---
I'm an adult but would you be willing to mentor me?

Alliance are only higher because they accept that their marriages are a sham. Their men are doing choir boys on the side, and their women are sneaking out to bone Orcs in the night.
---
truefaith but no ones actually going to bother getting it. just not worth. get robes of the exalted
---
True fans got pregnant by December so they could go on maternity leave by August.
---
Shadowmeld itself might not work in combat but it also improves rogue/druid stealth which makes nelf rogues have the best stealth in the game.  
---
Couple that with humans having stealth detection racial, horde aint gonna find you if you play elf rogue unless you want them to.  
---
This increases your chances of getting an opener in pvp or being able to stealth anywhere in the world.
---
My Lenovo IdeaPad 330s runs in beautifully. 8th gen core i3, 22gb ddr4 ram and a simple Nvidia 620 integrated graphics I've seen very little hiccups. Optimization on Blizzards side of things is great.

8.2 downloaded earlier today at like 9gb.... classic just released and is 4.8gb 
---
should look like this now
---
And the spirit for regen isn't bad either.  
---
Combat downtime what makes the warrior so incredible slow to level, so it helps a ton.

98 percent of North America's grizzly bear population lives in Alaska.

That sounds a lot like my timeline with my old hunter. I never capped in vanilla, and come Cata I wasn't as fond of the class anymore. I had a blast with Blood DK and Disc/Holy priest though.
---
&gt; And it's not like you're going to be constantly feared all the time to make it super necessary
---
In pvp that's exactly what it felt like.
---
I was in a similar age, but was excited to become a core raider, as I was undergeared to be in my guilds main team. Ended up leaving because I still wasn't in the raid group into a guild that disbanded a week later, and 7 if us went to a guild that passed my original guild in progression fairly quickly.

Well, how much mp5 is +11 spirit (+12 if Alliance), with 15% from Meditation? 
---
+heal is more or less equal, even more so with Spiritual Guidance.
---
After the recent Q&amp;A I can honestly see Classic being a middling success in time. 
---
If Blizz is able to actually incorporate the things we love about wow back into the current retail version, I don't see people playing Classic seriously for very long. 
---
Because, if they are actually able to do that. You don't need to release new content for Classic. You can just fix modern wow and move on. 
---
Now I could just as easily seeing them failing at that massive challenge and Classic ending up as the reboot. Who knows how it goes. But WoW will not have the same trajectory as Runescape did.
---
The changes in RS3 were way too much compared to OSRS. They actually have night and day differences that are irreparable. WoW's classic and retail versions aren't really that different. It's graphics, specs, flying, and gear. 
---
I was actually surprised how similar Vanilla wow is to modern wow. I remembered it being a completely different game and that's what I expected. So because it isn't that different I actually don't see both of these version surviving long. One of them is going to be a fad that burns out.
---
Hey its been 12 hours, not sure if it's happend yet but good luck on the second kid bro 👍

Ret can pinch off heal, provide buffs, add another aura, use nightfall to add spell damage debuff, has HoJ/Repentance, and does a not-insignificant amount of DPS through MC.
---
Made gear you got from raids useless.
---
I mean thats even worse then. This way you have even more lockout time on your main. Is it fun to not play just to preserve your world buff?
---
Mine still looks like OPs (except play button isn't greyed out).
---
I assume N3WT0N has an active sub? That might be the difference.
---
classic was 3GB for me
---
You're a shaman so it wasn't a paladin.  So warrior or druid the rage comment still stands, just replace sunder with maul/swipe.
---
Also the fact that most tanks are warriors means pretty much everyone will assume the tank is a warrior unless stated otherwise. 
---
So going be your response here I'm starting to think you intentionally didn't state the class of the tank so that you could have an "aha! Gotcha I never said warrior" moment like you did just now. So instead of actually countering my argument you just go "haha you're wrong because I never said warrior".
---
Now can you please actually respond properly?
---
I mean, this is just a novelty thing that can be done once you outgear the content it's not really a practical thing to do.

Yeah who needs a top dps class.
---
It’s not pointless because you’re assuming a fully stocked, perfect player. I’m talking under the assumption we’re going by just class abilities and stats, whereas sure, a try hard mage with a bag full of runes won’t go oom. Assuming just buffs and heals happening, a lock’s mana pool is just bigger.
---
I'm in one like that now. It's great tbh.
---
I agree to a certain extent (I'm always going for the flag personally), however if one team can truly dominate midfield with a bunch of hunters/mages/locks etc, it will make it almost impossible to score for the opposing team and you only need a team of 3 (sometimes just 1) to get the flag and get out in the open where the midfield can support you on the way back. I guess the problem is when midfield doesnt pay any attention to either flag carrier and it becomes a stalemate where no team is really trying to return the flag.
---
Question was what are you going to name your character
---
A holy pally is probably the most useful spec to have on your pug team, along with a raid geared warrior. You don't even need crazy gear as a pally, just being a good support is super strong.
---
&gt;will the beta stress test serve as a place where we can reserve character names
---
&gt;are all names being reset after beta is closed
---
They'll give everyone with a sub a chance to reserve names on 13th of August.
---
Man I loved arenas. Some of my best memories were all night grudge match arenas, where you fought the same teams lots.
---
Some are wondering if they'll be named after land marks like the Field of Strife server was for AV testing.  
---
I'm excited to see the names no matter what they are.
---
&gt;GRIZZLY
---
I'd be on The Nicker.
---
sublime trolling
---
More often than the situations Im actually gonna use perception at least.
---
Confining it to rogue vs rogue, the openers likely bring more wins than stoneform and escape artist. Though those 2 are likely more useful in any other situation.
---
21 is the day of my birth! Thanks Blizz ^__^
---
"Who was your first kill, not counting prot warriors?"
---
If you mean 8.2, I do not believe you do. It just came in earlier today
---
Ok I will amend my statement.
---
"but it is bad for leveling when you will replace your weapon every 6 hours, except for in the mid 30s when you get your WW axe and that will take you about 12 hours to replace"
---
No, never meant it.
---
Thanks for your answer :) does that hold true for healers too? Or do healers rank up alongside the more kill focused specs at similar pace? (sorry if this is a shitty noob question I'm not entirely sure how it all works yet)
---
I uninstalled and reinstalled it to verify, its 4.8gb
---
Dude how can you tell what he said?
---
&gt;transmogs
---
I had a beef before that. Even through BC, you could tell who had raid gear and who didn't. If I stood around in my full T7, you knew what I had done. 
---
WotLK rolled around and every top-level dungeon drop, PvP, or casual raid item was indistinguishable from raid gear. It took so much away to not be able to show off that you were rocking the full set.
---
And with transmogs it's worse because you have the purchasable display sets and can cover up the fact that you're wearing a set of mismatched greens!
---
I like being able to customize my look and its huge for RP servers to not have to swap into "costumes," but I'm stoked to seeing someone wearing a particular hat and knowing that they just completed X
---
Smoke Two Joints - Sublime
---
Yeah but probably not enough to really skew the results that much
---
challenge = more time
---
They stated previously that Beta was added back to the client for people who had it installed already, as there was no way to uninstall it otherwise. So it looks like you have the beta client installed still but don't have access to the beta.
---
Weird! Yes n3wt0n has an active sub but it was a launcher update. I went to the menu and there was a "restart with update" button that I clicked and it changed to 
---
It’s 2.8 if you download it in the same directory as retail wow because it can share stuff.
---
Aren't we getting 1.12 though?
---
August 12th if you're in the US.
---
I have the same - But the play button is greyed out?
---
Shadowmeld is literally never "needed" if any of the dwarf racials are needed even once it's mathematically infinitely better
---
Awesome :) thank you
---
You mean you have to pay to play games? Wtf corruption EA
---
I'm 100 percent playing a combat sword gnome rogue leveling in kalimdor for rep to ride a tiger, as I do not care about the human meta
---
Yeah, greater blessings will be in. He was just making an old joke is all.
---
They are healers. Holy is great output with all the support. Nobody in the right mind would take a ret over a holy paladin. No matter how much you say "but support!" those buffs don't make them a competitive choice.
---
Questing through 58ish should still be best afaik.
---
Or if your social life is still destroyed from vanilla......
---
It’s possible, when you install the default is within the new WoW folder structure. But if you choose to install it elsewhere it will warn you that the install will be larger (9gb instead of 4gb) as it won’t be sharing some files.
---
I have tested and it works fine, currently have the classic beta on one ssd and retail bfa on another.
---
Hunter.
---
Excuse me, but poop sock says "whadup."
---
It really was immersive. I'd lose myself in the tasks of Azeroth - farming mats, questing, raising skills. It felt like work because it was, but it was rewarding.
---
I used to farm motes for hours and just chat with guildies until someone wanted to do a dungeon run.
---
When new players came in, the draw was there but the work was different than other games. They pressured the change into more of an action rpg than an MMO
---
I would love to see the end result of classic turn into a retelling of a whole new version of the story but keeping the elements that make the game a true MMO
---
I mean, that could just be a skill thing. Getting to a high rating enough to get glad gear was a challenge, but if you're topping meters with half of the stats doing nothing to help you with damage, thats a problem with your guilds talents.
---
Top mages on WWS/Wowmeter were not using glad gear unless there was a fancy trinket im not thinking of.
---
You really need to stop with this ignorance.
---
Going to surprise retail folks. "Why am I doing half the damage of other dps specs?"
---
it is now
---
It wasn't strictly resilience, the TBC arena gear had inflated Item Level, combined with 5 stats vs pve gear's 4 stats (on average).  The only PvE items that were categorically better than Arena gear were 'end boss items' and '5-stat items'.
---
[Tier 4 Plate Healing](https://tbc-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=29061)  
---
[Season 1 Plate Healing](https://tbc-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=31616)  
---
The only reason the PvP helm has less stats is because it is weighted towards Stamina.  
---
When Season 2 hit, it invalidated every raid other than BT and Hyjal.
---
I’m not finding an option for a different download. Any ideas?
---
I'm not sure how that's even a question, Truefaith has more everything.
---
I do but id rather not risk it
---
I’ve been walking for an hour each day for the last five days, I won’t get to walk today because I am babysitting a 1 and 4 year old but that’s exercise enough. I’ve starting researching to build a new gaming pc for wow and likely borderlands 3 when it hits steam. I also finally got around to getting new glasses last week which was long overdo.
---
Paladin Warlock
---
Either your guild is trash or you're bullshitting. S1 gear was pretty much garbage and that season are largely dictated by PvE gear. S2 gear was still worse than what gear you'd have if you went into t5 **for PvE** (PvP gear being better than equivalent tier raid gear for PvP? The horror). You'd have to be talking about taking s3 gear into t5 raids, and at that point you're talking about being way behind the curve.
---
Your post doesn't do anything except make you look like a terrible player - because you're either lying or you're not good enough to get into a good guild.
---
No, I agree not in real life:). But it does impact on being able to play as much as I'd like.
---
Palarlock.

The history of the Dark Portal is a long one, which you can brush up on [here.](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Dark_Portal) 
---
Suffice to say, that it is how the first orcs came to Azeroth. It was present in Vanilla, though not operational. The intro into TBC was the re-opening of the Dark Portal.
---
People who want to enjoy the end game, let them. People who want to enjoy the leveling, let them. Let’s stop making redundant posts
---
Generally when I ran raids that had some Pugs or was a pug myself in a pre-made raid generally it was free rolls to everyone Main Spec only / upgrades, then if no main specs needed it and it wasn't an upgrade it was opened to offspec rolls.
---
Of course it was set to ML so people couldnt ninja loot pug or not and handed out to the winner.
---
It was assumed you came in on your main spec unless you were specifically asked to run as your offspec, this kept people from coming in as one spec then claiming that their main spec was something else.
---
Its the same thing it was just renamed back to beta. if you uninstall the client it will disappear.
---
Ha! May as well roll a kobold
---
Some suggestions:
---
1.) Make a Druid for versatile PvE play or as a farming alt. You'll get to play any role for dungeons, so you can narrow down which class you really like. If PvE ain't working out, you'll still have an incredible proficient PvW(ild) class to farm with. Bind your jump to swap between mining/herbalism in a pinch.
---
2.) Make a bank alt, Rogue recommended if you want to pick locks and combine that with Dwarf treasure hunting racial, plus you will be more prepared for rogue ganks by understanding the class. Consider it a PvG(old) class. I recommend Alchemy and/or Enchanting to send consumables across characters and disenchant gear.
---
3.) Pick a main for fun's fucking sake. The game is meant for you to have fun. There is no wrong way to do it. You will learn what you want through trial and error, don't overthink it. Passionate gameplay happens after you start an adventure, not before. Make friends, be social, join a community - because that's what Classic is all about.
---
You were in the first stress test (Beta &amp; Stress Test) which they removed from the stress testers. They added it back last week to make uninstalling easier. Today, because they're moving the stress test from the beta so they aren't related at all they removed the "&amp; Stress Test" part of the dropdown. But, you still don't have beta.
---
awesome! Are you leaning towards horde or alliance?
---
I'm currently towards alliance, but nothing set in stone. Also yeah this was targeted toward parents not just dads!
---
The only theory at this point is an active sub? Do you have one?
---
I am working on a professional certification. I would like like to lose 10 pounds over the summer.
---
looks like 8pm is prime time then;)
---
Uninstall the beta client and it will go away.
---
Pally tank is not viable in vanilla without being overgeared, which would mean farming instances as a healer or being carried as a ret paladin.
---
People said that it works if you travel to the other continent in spirit form, after dying.
---
It wont work if you run on the same continent you died on.  
---
So if you can give this a try on next stress test. Die in teldrassil, on kalimdor, and try to use boat to get to eastern kingdoms and talk to a spirit healer there.
---
thanks for the info
---
SURROUNDED BY ALLIANCE! EVERY TIME I CLOSE MY EYES I SEE THEIR BLONDE HAIR AND THEIR SMUG, SATISFIED FACES!
---
i hope you’re trolling
---
Hey there :)
---
You could try more fruits and vegetables, like:
---
-Pears with Fiber content: 5.5 grams in a medium-sized pear, or 3.1 grams per 100 grams
---
-Avocado with Fiber content: 10 grams in a cup, or 6.7 grams per 100 grams
---
-Brocoli with Fiber content: 2.4 grams per cup, or 2.6 grams per 100 grams
---
-Lentils Fiber content: 15.6 grams per cup of cooked lentils, or 7.9 per 100 grams 
---
-Oats Fiber content: 16.5 grams per cup of raw oats, or 10.6 grams per 100 grams
---
-Almonds with Fiber content: 3.4 grams per ounce, or 12.5 grams per 100 grams 
---
Hope formatting isnt to bad in my post.
---
Well well, look at this Grade-A A-hole. Got life all figured out huh? Meanwhile, I still am trying to decide between Horde or Alliance.
---
I've always been confused as to why ret gets so much attention in vanilla. I mean it's not like there is this super exciting playstyle hidden behind poor performance, even if ret was absolutely top tier it's still just so bland to play, at least in my opinion. I not saying there is no room to inset player skill and stand out a bit, but overall it just feels so flat.
---
And not take care of their kid.
---
&gt; Well, how much mp5 is +11 spirit (+12 if Alliance), with 15% from Meditation?
---
12 spirit is 4 mana/tick, so equivalent to 10 mp5 while not casting or 1.5 mp5 while inside fsr due to meditation.
---
I think it works out to a little less than 3 mp5.
---
Honestly the difference isn't big enough that it's worth going out of your way to farm and craft Truefaith. Plus the mats alone are worth a few hundred gold or more, depending on server prices.
---
you linked the same picture again.
---
If you find a group of people who understand how godly Holy Paladins are in PvP and the necessity of keeping you alive, you will be unstoppable
---
Well a friend of mine just did that and got it.
---
There isn't a dungeon in WoW called VC though?
---
Druids can tank certain content and if the raid is prepared for it. They lack much of the mitigation of warriors instead relying on larger HP and lots of dodge. They do not generate threat nearly as well and are prone to spike damage that healers must be prepared for. It's not bad to have one handy, but not necessary compared to a warrior tank which is essential
---
I didn’t even read this post
---
Closest was there parents hired actors to pretend to be future versions of the kids who became drug addicts for not getting good grades
---
r/woooosh
---
Would be cool if it showed gear.
---
The macro experience alone from the last 15 years will help progression a lot
---
Pretty sure I'm going to have these thoughts every damn day until launch
---
Prot paly
---
S1 was only ruled by the Blacksmithing weapons because they were the highest teir possible at the time.
---
holy pally was by far my favourite class/spec to heal as in BGs. so hard to kill. you're probably wanna go ret to level though, unless you wanna kill yourself.
---
Only if it was super meta.
---
Sort of like 21/22 jump street was, that meta logic of we know it is the same shit, but you guys like it so we did the same shit again.
---
Bellygrub!
---
Interesting. IIRC there is at least 1 item in Gnomish that makes it better to retain at max level in addition to Ultrasafe Transporter: Gadgetzan. Porting to Gadge can save a lot of time flying at 60. (However, Goblin is nice because creating your own nades saves $)
---
I spent far more time raiding in vanilla than anything else.
---
It'll be updated but there will be less to download as they fix and improve things.
---
Veiling Caverns?
---
I think this just made me realize that the Ooga Gang is the past, present, and future versions... of the same person?
---
https://imgur.com/ycGamof
---
You were saying?
---
Download now if you want to play the open stress test tmrw..otherwise you can wait I guess
---
They have some of the best looking gear. And they were clearly gimped when you look at all the plate that was intended for them
---
If the target you are healing gets a Honorable Kill you still get honor.
---
Thanks, I’m gonna read that in a second, I just didn’t know it was relevant enough in vanilla to be the login screen.
---
I know I did
---
Irl yes, but not in game so I'll level with ret yeah ;P thanks!
---
Controller is fine for DPS, maybe healing. But God damn every controller tank I've ever had has been awful.
---
They run in her he arcs because analogue sticks, can't pick out mobs in a pile of trash because no mouse, struggle to quickly use certain lifesaving abilities on themselves or allies.
---
I've only ever used one for casual stuff. Tanking or endgame I use a keyboard.
---
I’m going PvP for sure, but so what if people want to roll PvE just let people play the game how they like without being judged, if you care about what others are doing then maybe the problem lies within you and not them
---
Cool :) I'll try look for a group once I get better. Thanks
---
Got into the actual beta servers? Not the stress test?
---
48 hrs, 15 level cap
---
Every race rogue can eat in stealth.
---
440mb.
---
tbh a (off)tank that can self heal is not all bad, I'm not talking specifically about raiding.
---
Priests get more dps out of Holy due to spiritual guidance though.
---
I'm the one who made the joke lol. I just thought we were still getting 5 min buffs.
---
Oh okay, sorry, I misunderstood, thought you meant it changed again.
---
I'm assuming the difference is because you're NA with an active sub and that's what's granting you access instead of me who has regular godmode luck beta access.
---
You're suffering from a hilariously immense lack of reading comprehension. 
---
I never claimed WotLK was when it started, so demanding answers from me just makes you look like a moron.
---
Also, you somehow claim that I have no PvP knowledge because I brought up a server that had a massive population spike of Horde rerolling alliance for racials, and indeed, entire guilds based around it.... because you were blathering about a battlegroup?
---
News flash: Player characters reside on servers, not battlegroups.
---
The gachi at 2:40 made me lose my shit
---
Sorry I mistook you for OP. Sounds like you have access to beta. I uninstalled and it disappeared for me (I had it installed for the last stress test).
---
Previously I posted a pretty fast run as a druid. In that post I got several requests for different classes. The route is pretty much the same (except for class quests). Shaman felt a lot easier than Druid though. Very little downtime and pretty high damage output early on.
---
If you have any questions, suggestions or request, feel free to ask!
---
You can PvP on PvE serves ya dingus
---
Ah right, I see what you mean. Thank you :)
---
When I started off 14 years ago I had a Mac with dual processor running on 867Mhz 1.5gb ddr1 and a 64mb gpu.. This ran wow on like 15 fps and 25 when looking down on the char, played like this till 2008 :) I don't worry my i3-8350k with 16gb and 1070 will run it smoothly
---
I would say dungeons would be a lot easier. Questing with 5 characters sounds like a pain - constantly waiting for respawns and drops and quest items. Mindless dungeons with some music or tv show on the other monitor sounds much more relaxing to me.
---
Read the quests, soak in the zone stories, PVP a bit in each bracket, do all the dungeons at the appropriate level, quest in as many zones as possible. 
---
I'm drinking in every last drop of this game and its world.
---
This is every MLB bench clearing "brawl"
---
The vast majority of casters were using S1 weapons.  There was only 2 drops in the game better at the time, and both were raid bosses.
---
the stress test.
---
Which is why you use a swing timer to time it for after your auto...
---
Kids require care? Damn...maybe that's what's wrong with mine...
---
Sulfuron Hammer added 1.4 per Itemization.info.
---
For everyone?
---
You can do whatever the hell you want, there are just repercussions. The repercussions for ninja looting is a bad rep. The repercussions for having rules such as "MT gets bindings if they drop" are nil.
---
:D
---
You can also move characters from one WoW account to another if they are both under the same Blizzard Account, but that's a paid service. Cheaper than maintaining two subscriptions, however. It's the same as the realm transfer service, so you can also change realms at the same time for free.
---
They've said no, but it might be worth trying to do the starter account this guy is talking about if you don't have a sub before getting one tomorrow, if that was your plan.
---
roques were always among the top dps in most of the boss fights up to TBC.  where did you get the idea that it was anything but? my favourite build was backstab.
---
Yeah that's how mine looks, I was just wondering if the bnet update is why ours looks different from OPs or what.
---
Even if it was possible they haven’t announced the next season’s release date, and August would be too quick for the network Comedy Central because they typically announce the next season about a year before it happens
---
If the pugs dont like how the loot is being done then they can get fucked and move on?
---
Yeah it really breaks immersion imo
---
Lul, bullshit. The dude is pretty fucking good at anything he does, gaming wise. Or used to be atleast. No matter what you think of new athene, he is hella intelligent and you dotn reach rank 1 in 2s 3s  and 5s and the same Time with a second tier class and be bad at the same time.
---
Yup reactivated last night
---
where do you download it?
---
You right dude, but I still hold my opinion on the matter of what I think will happen. But I can state people buying level 60 accounts around when MC is finished for the people committed will cause problems. I have my opinion, you have yours.
---
PVE or PVP server? 
---
As a multiboxer you will have hard time pulling different mobs and will kill one mop way to fast so the leveling efficiency will be very low. 
---
I would suggest farming dungeons as you can do them without the fear of Ganking as well as you get some good EXP.
---
SOME QUALITY CONTENT. Thanks for posting something acutally good instead of just memes and reaction clips. Also good Video!
---
I thought you needed a sub for it? It just showed up for me without one do i still need it to play? So confused haha
---
There was a well balanced version of D&amp;D once. It was called 4th Edition, and fans of the earlier editions hated it.
---
No not really. Just some naxx gear. A few pieces.
---
Wish he did some team fights. Everyone talks about spriest being a 1v1/2 god, but it would be nice to see how they do in a group setting.
---
&gt;**What make you most envious of other classes?**
---
Warriors can tank, Druids to a lesser extent, Paladins to an even lesser extent than that
---
&gt;**and What stops you from maining that class?**
---
Other classes don't have totems. 😎
---
are you EU?
---
oh lol
---
I let the other hunters get the tier peaces.  Only stat that mattered was +crit chance.
---
Wolf Slayer Sniper rifle and a bunch of +Crit gear was all that was needed to destroy the DPS meters.  The full T5 hunters were pretty confused.  I told them it's drinking from my Brewfest pony keg that have my dwarf the drunk buff.  
---
I felt like passing up T5 and letting them have it was like setting them up for failure.
---
That's the joke
---
Wait, you are saying you are in the beta and it doesnt look like mine does?
---
This is wrong.  It may be the highest ilvl gap (i didnt even check), but stats per ilevel is exponential.
---
The difference between ilvl50 -&gt; 60  is less stats than ilvl 100 -&gt; 110.  It would take some math to see if the relative increase is more or less, but your statement is just false.
---
Wrath, Cata and WoD all to my knowledge had way larger gaps.  I seem to remember WoD having poeple start at 100,000 hp and by the 2nd raid teir they had 1,000,000 hp...
---
truefaith is considered to be fairly competitive with the t2 chest, there won't be anything around as powerful until you kill nefarian in phase 3 so there is not really an excuse to not go for it, imo.
---
All active (non-EU) subscribers will be able to participate in June 19 - 21 stress test that will be open for 48 hrs, all races and all classes, level cap 15. And some dungeons will be enables as well as WSG.
---
Well I do it every day at work so why would WoW be any different?
---
So it (thorium bro’s rep rewards) would come out with BWL patch, no?
---
WEAR IT IN SILENCE, OR I'LL HONOR YOU AGAIN!
---
In my previous post I linked to a Tauren druid speed run video of mine. In that post I got several requests for different classes/races. Here is my take on Tauren Shaman. The route is pretty much the same as on my druid, except for the class quests. The shaman felt a lot smoother than druid this early on though. (Much) higher damage output and very little need to sit down and drink (all though, in hindsight, 5 to 10 milk would've made things go even faster around level 7-8).
---
I'm still debating if a staff or shield and fast 1h mace would be better.  I could come back to this class and see what works better. Overall, pretty happy with this result.
---
If you have any questions, requests or suggestions, I'm happy to answer them. Thanks!
---
[Battle.net](https://Battle.net) launcher
---
Like i told the other guy this is classic. You have reputations that last till the day the game ends.
---
If you piss off some pugs word gets around
---
Where do you download it?
---
I can’t launch it.
---
An Alliance Warlock with a Holy Paladin pocket healer is GODMODE.
---
Update your [battle.net](https://battle.net) client. even though it restarts itself, Close it out completely, and then open it agian. Click on World Of Warcraft, and look above the "play" or "install" button. you'll see 2 drop down boxes.  
---
"Version" should have classic WoW. account is whatever account you wanna play on.
---
Need a Grommy H bot
---
That’s why you passively farm it. You don’t just aim for it and grind it out. Live strat runs will be popular for money and gear, you can/will do a bunch of them regardless.
---
Truefaith isn’t replaced until T2 chest off Nefarian, which is phase 3 iirc. You’ll have months to work toward it.
---
I see it and almost had a heart attack.
---
Interesting guide, will obviously not work like this on Classic release tho, but a good guide for speed leveling on empty realms.
---
I'd be down for this since I already have a switch c:
---
I can do that next time!
---
I wasn’t capped for most of TBC but I vividly remember many guildies complaining about PvP gear essentially being “welfare epics” - that was actually the first time I heard that term.

---
I miss this. I loved that I earned my nightsaber riding human, and I hate seeing hundreds of weird and whacky dragons and mechs in every city.

&gt; I have my opinion, you have yours.

Yes, and yours is baseless and wrong.
---
Idk why this bindings topic keeps coming up. 
---
Im adviding against pugging with a guild cuz theres no way in hell they wont use master looter and piss you off
---
Should I not worry so much maybe? I wont have a pocket healer most of the time, and I still wanna have a good time
---
World Enlarger (credits to /u/UbiGeofram).
---
Most likely on phase 5 you want HS in CH anyway, so transporter isn't a big loss IMO.
---
Man ! That's alot of work, good job.
---
Your main peel is Deathcoil or charm into chain fear. Now imagine a big percentage of your enemy has a racial trinket and a 5 sec  immunity to charm and fear plus a regular trinket.
---
Yes, there is a stress test coming that everyone with an active sub can join in.
---
Male or female?
---
They have aged. Just not a lot.
---
Yeah when they changed hunters it really gutted my enjoyment of the class and the game. 
---
It came out after that none of the class developers actually played a hunter. So the whole gameplay was redesigned by people who knew nothing about it. 
---
And in my opinion Hunters in Wrath were in a great state. And they still maintained a lot of the feel and gameplay. 
---
Anyways, looking forward to Classic.
---
Actually it is about raiding. Sure leveling is a big part of the game but ultimately end game raiding is the most fun I've had in this game and the point of leveling is to reach max level to ultimately raid.
---
This has nothing to do with launch, this has to do with the stress test tomorrow
---
 OH, IT'S UNSPEAKABLE TO YOU? WHAT ARTHAS DID TO PEOPLE IN STRATHOLME, THAT WAS UNSPEAKABLE!
---
That would be dope!
---
**Weapons were literally the ONLY pieces of gear where they seriously intruded on the raid scene in a meaningful way.** There was a huge stink s3 about it, yes it was a thing (I still used a PvE weapon on some fights because the gladiator's healing mace didn't have MP5), but meme'ing about going into a raid with a full set of PvP gear in a legitimate progression guild and topping the meter? It's a joke. It's a big fucking.
---
Now you can test it on Silver Hand on Saturday.
---
I don't see it in the launcher? I have an active sub and I have the box check off to beta test retail wow and classic wow.
---
Stress test tomorrow, anyone with an active sub can play it
---

Doesn't Dwarf zone need you to get fur off the wolves as one of the first quests?

---
This is for the stress test tomorrow
---
I do like that NPCs start referring to you as "Champion" in the later expansions. But honestly it gets a little old with every player being the chosen one champion who wields might artifacts. Just being another soldier of the horde/alliance is much more exciting.
---
There will not be 21 servers for the stress test.
---
No no, you’re thinking of alt f4
---
This 100%. The difference between T1 and T2 gear was much smaller than what you would see in WOTLK or something.
---
Also been in both, this hits way too close to home. There was nowhere near the amount of drama and infighting in the tryhard guild as there was in the more casual guild.
---
That isnt in a cave, but yes
---
Hmm, did you restart the launcher?
---
Lololol
---
I mean with sac you still absorb a ton of dmg and if u go deep demo and get soullink it gets even more gross.
---
Sadly though undead are like 90 percent of the horde ..... you can still fear them but they will break it and immune it just don’t think it’s WORTHLESS cause they are undead
---
Yes EQ was awesome at this. I quit early in TBC as well. 
---
In EQ I was wearing items well into and sometimes through expansions. You were also always farming items and plat to Twink out other characters with scepters of destructions, blade of Carnage, tuned bolster belts, golden efreeti boots and things like that. There were just so many powerful twink items that it was fun to collect them all.
---
Yea, when I saw your screenshot, I checked my launcher, saw there was an update, but nothing (appeared) to have changed.
---
 oh gotcha. 
---
 i dont think 1 slot in 1 tier is the strongest reason. there are better ones.
---
Weird, lol.

Would you mind asking your friend if he has this additional pop-up option in his client under "version" and under the "In Development" section called "Beta: World of Warcraft Classic".
---
And you know this how? The stress test is open to everyone, they may want to test the infrastructure with multiple realms.
---
I mean, those are choices. Choices we make. For the greater good.
---
In the works!
---
Damn I envy you lucky bastard : c
---
feral is viable.
---
maybe boomkin cause its funny.
---
Also, saber mount and being the tallest Alliance race.
---
With hand of rag and t2.5 and an enhance/ele build you can do strong dps
---
Yaa I was a little worried, just wondering if it's truly as bad as people say
---
It will show on Blizzard launcher. Select the drop down menu.
---
This looks like it’s doing the trick! Updating the launcher now
---
Or stress test tomorrow :)
---
I think the Gadgetzan transporter is a pretty big loss. I'll be going Gnomish and will just hire a Goblin Engineer to make me their stuff if/when I want it.
---
I enjoyed BC, but if played vanilla so long and it was exciting to finally go through the dark portal. Blood elves irritated me as did the Draenei. I hated that Draenor was just floating islands even though I knew that's what it would be. I loved some parts of WoD for that reason - we got to see the world of the orcs.
---
MAKE IT HAPPEN!
---
 I assume it's the difference between *real* beta access and *NA with active sub* beta access.
---
Oh it’s bad for sure in comparison to a horde lock make no mistake. But you are still extremely strong. Just keep in the back of your head if you fear them and they break it you need to last 5 secs to fear again.
---
Back in the day, I rolled Warlock because my friend brought me to Jaedenar.
---
It's still a solid class, and the Alliance have Paladins. Your fear of fighting a bunch of WOTF popping Horde should be contrasted with the thought of a warrior and his cleansing buddy smashing your face in.
---
oh ok, so having this on your launcher doesnt mean you access to the beta, had me super excited for a second. :/
---
I honestly dont think people will need to farm consumables to the extent people say they would. It wasnt until patchwerk we ever used a raid wide flask, and we cleared naxx in vanilla. I think people will be surprised at how easy it will all be this time.
---
lol, unless you needed +hit or +mp5, the S2 gear was on par or better than SSC+TK drops.
---
I am against twinking. My reasoning:   
---
Non-twinking players who are leveling their characters will feel discouraged to do Battlegrounds during their leveling journey. The difference between a twink and a regular Joe leveling is greater in lower level brackets compared to max level. In max level BGs there are plenty of people of different gear levels participating. Of course there are max level premades as well, which will have the same effect on random noobs as in the lower brackets, where twinks rule.  
---
Also my nostalgia goggles see the time when WSG was released. There were no twinks and people joined battlegrounds through the whole leveling bracket, instead of being max level of the bracket to stand the slightest chance. That was glorious and I sort of wanted to feel that kind of low level BGs once again, but alas, when BGs are coming to Classic WoW, there will be twinks already in their BiS gear.  
---
I can understand that people want to feel overpowered. I can understand that with limited playtime that is the only way to have top notch gear in PvP. But... the enjoyment of twinking community is directly diminishing enjoyment of all the other players leveling, who just want to do battlegrounds once in a while.  
---
To some extent twinking won't have much of an effect on other players. If, for example in WSG,  there are two twinks on each side, it won't be that noticeable. People can still outplay those individual twinks if they work together in a group. On the other hand, 5 twinks on one side and zero on the other will just be unplayable for the other team.   
---
This is a matter of values: there are no right or wrong approaches to this. In my opinion the enjoyment of those players, whom the content is meant for, should be able to enjoy it in a more fair way. Twink feels (to me) like a bully, who is afraid to mess with people of similar size, and instead messes with weaker kids. And if twinkers say that they don't care about being overpowered, that they just want to play in that certain level bracket for what ever reasons... Well, for some reason these same people hate the idea that twinks should only fight against other twinks in the battlegrounds. This was clear after Blizzard separated twinks from other players. But to be fair, people doing premades at lvl 60 wouldn't do them either if they were forced to face only other premades. Efficiency (honor gained) wins against having a fair match between similarly skilled opponents.
---
&gt; Sadly though undead are like 90 percent of the horde
---
This is just wrong.
---
It was every slot.
---
&gt; I hated that Draenor was just floating islands even though I knew that's what it would be.
---
Err, that seems bad considering thats what they were in War3? I wouldnt call it "just" floating islands, NetherStorm, Bladge's Edge, Nagrand, Shadowmoon Valley are all very different.
---
I literally had nothing to download as I still have the Classic Blizzcon Demo, Classic Beta(well stress test), 8.2 PTR, live game, and technically BFA Beta installed on my computer. I'm such a gosh dang hoarder
---
It's just annoying. It will definitely get you killed a lot while levelling when all the ud rogues/warriors see you and lick their lips.     
---
You do get some nice bonuses of being on alliance though as well, mainly in PvE you're guaranteed salv/wisdom which is awesome as a lock, and in PvP you get pally support which is far superior to shaman support.    
---
Basically in pvp your job on alliance becomes more damage heavy and less about CC because alliance doesn't get ele sham burst and because ud are a very popular priest/mage/rogue race and your cc now sucks against them.
---
I am hoping that Bobbyb.bot shows up here somehow
---
I prefer classic here. I feel like a character exploring a world with lots going on. Retail feels like a single player game where I HAVE to see everything to get levelled up, whether I want to or not. 
---
I also really hate quests that make me not play as my character.
---
...... it’s a gross exaggeration obviously. I’m sorry you didn’t grasp that.
---
OP please make note my statistics are not backed up by any real data 
---
Ffs
---
* "Everyone was running around in full sets of PvP gear and nobody took raid gear and the game were ruined **REEE**".
---
"Hey, that's not true."
---
* "Okay actually it was only the weapon, and it was only certain classes for certain tiers of content. But it was still horrible, because skilled players (actually TBH arena boosting was a problem, boosting scrubs to 1850 was a totally viable strategy) being rewarded with gear that could be used in other parts of the game... **REEE**".
---
NA or Oceanic only, I read.
---
It's for the open stress test tomorrow.
---
Same tho
---
We're fucked up over here. I bet wash clothes are big where you're from too. We literally take a bar of soap, scrub it between our ass cheeks, then leave it for the next person.
---
I mean, that's the same with retail right now. People want to go to places to get world quests done, but because people go there to get world quests done and not to PvP, they just run past each other.  
---
The flip side is that people with world buffs will try to preserve them, so they would log out their mains outside the raid and not log in until it's clear, locking a whole raid's worth of level 60 mains out of doing pvp.
---
I am sure everyone will eventually be updated to the new method.
---
Yep capacitive touch screen like your phone, not a nasty resistive one like on the DS
---
true, excludes EU unfortunately
---
If a character is inactive for more than two expansions they release the names now. This was done to stop people submitting tickets to request a name be released
---
I think I once heard that most players back then didn't even reach 60. And so, even less raided.
---
This is what I hope to look like by next summer
---
I mean the blasted, shattered series of islands rather than a full world. They felt like little isolated nothings.
---
afaik, there will be up to three layers per server, with thousands of players per layer. 
---
that still spells overcrowded leveling zones to me.
---
HOW'S IT SO SCUFFED THAT SOMEONE CAN'T DIE
---
&gt;playing a test environment version of the game
---
Makes good sense, tbh I was mainly worried that I would be handicapping myself too much and would end up regretting rolling lock. Seems like it's not the definite case...
---
As I obviously haven't tested AAP on beta yet (just saw the post now, but I'll give it a ago), the fact that it dynamically changes the guide (at least it does on BFA), based on what quests you have and haven't done and where you are in the world, this is probably better for the average player, who is just looking for some guidance and isn't too fuzzed about absolute speed.
---
Yessssssss
---
I think everyone is just patiently waiting. Stress testing is more necessary now than ever, but I think Blizz should learn from their own playbook and recognize that less is more when building hype and that they really did earn that sardonic (tm) on the Blizzard "Soon"
---
Oh god now the other brain dead pug players wont want to join my groups either
---
Reputation won't make a whole lot of difference unless you're absolutely awful. You'll still get into good guilds, still do dungeons with good players etc
---
Delusional boomers that think reputations are something that only existed in vanilla are getting really old. Maybe it's just because everybody in my region is toxic anyway but nobody really cares if you're toxic as fuck as long as you can show up to raid and not cause a guild to implode.
---
kk I'm rolling on The Nicker see u guys there
---
It's how the Orcs got to Azeroth in Warcraft I. It's one of the most iconic things, if not the most iconic thing in all of Warcraft lore.
---
Answer is EU server...
---
But I have friends on NA too
---
My retail is NA
---
My old classic character was EU
---
Who am I? 
---
Where am I? 
---
Who turned off the light !
---
Shadow is freaking RIDICULOUS in classic. Mages, Locks, Rogues, Warriors... the Spriest is the true god of Vanilla.
---
Just keep a healthy supply of mana pots and water and you will own in BGs.
---
More gear for the rest of us then
---
He doesn't. He literally wanted to play the Stress test and used gold to resub for it.
---
I miss those rivalries we would build without ever even communicating with the opponents. Good times.
---
honestly yeah, I'd love if every race got a weapon skill racial. 
---
On a completely different note, something that I thought of that would be hilarious for 'classic+' (not that it'll ever actually happen) is a Tier equal to the AQ40 sets that would just flip class roles on it's head. IE Rogues become tanks with tier bonuses for threat generation and cooldown changes as well as +defense, warriors get their dps halved but instead dish out partywide hps, paladins become high tier dps etc.
---
I leveled as a prot warrior in 2004. I would not recommend doing this. Level as Arms and respec prot after hitting at least lvl 50 or higher.
---
Judge Dredd over here upholding the law
---
VC stands for Dead Mines obviously.
---
It's about 37% for the major Pservers, which you could have easily looked up.
---
I'm buying a standing desk before August 27th.
---
I'll be on Finkle Skinner

I remember that site, I think I even had an account once upon a time.

Oddly enough it just has one unguilded entry for my main but has some info on my alts at least.
---
http://www.warcraftrealms.com/charsheet/4666763
---
I mean, hardcore for sure will get it but majority won't.
---
Be honest you didn’t. Search at all
---
Pretty sure there's a poop collection quest in literally every expansion
---
It was obviously hyperbole ? Are you this dense ?
---
That’s a fair amount of time. Good to know thanks!!
---
Really made me LOL at a restaurant
---
I had all my shit bound and the Naga mouse, with the numpad keys on the side. It was pretty insane.
---
Sorry that I disagree with you...l2p amirite?
---
First of all, homogenized gameplay in retail sucks. And even Ion admitted that the plethora of dampening skills/spells tends to stall matches and leads to unenjoyable gameplay. Maybe he has no idea what is going on too.
---
Jesus this video makes Rogues look *awful* in Classic.
---
i wonder what the stress test is testing for? random times where everyone is trying to play all at once? you're right, it obviously has nothing to do with launch
---
Lots of info on the August 12th date, didn't find any info on names being reset from beta. Sick comment though my dude
---
The server of kalecgos called it VC. The server popped up right before the release of battlegrounds.
---
I saw people make groups for all of Dire Maul, granted it was right after 1.3.
---
Sublime is the shit.
---
It's a play on the song Smoke Two Joints by Sublime.
---
Pandas were a lot more interesting than generic fantasy orcs number 43 or generic fantasy dwarves number 80
---
You need to find a desk+chair combo that doesn’t put pressure on your wrist and neck.
---
I’ll add to the conversation by saying that WoW helped my ability to type immensely. So much so, that during 8th grade typing class I was typing more words in my class per minute than anyone else. I remember purposely slowing myself down as to not be made fun of. 
---
WoW also increased my vocabulary and my social skills, even if the friends I made were virtual.
---
Gonna disagree. Didn’t see it called VC when I leveled my warrior on stonemaul US.
---
He just wants us to know that all our comments matter, ya know.
---
Wow, I'd forgotten about that.
---
Just play Soul link and continue to slay every single rogue you see, you won’t even need fear.
---
Much better than BfA.  
---
All classes have one viable spec for PvE or PvP and they are 95% all the same.
---
I updated my Bnet launcher and the Classic download was in there.
---
I have severe spinal issues. So will be taking breaks often. Did the same in Classic.

What leeway stuff :o
---
Who are these people who are enjoying being bad at a game? I've never met them.
---
I think it’s just to get ready for tomorrow.
---
The bulk of my raid experience in vanilla was post vanilla during bc and wotlk when I didn't upgrade my account. I kept it that way because I was in the NAVY during vanilla and only had time to run 5 mans and twink. But i had tons of fun dispute my lack of raiding during the vanilla era.
---
Warlock + pally is really weak in vanilla pvp vs competent players.
---
You can have fun killing shitty players though.
---
I prefer Joanna
---
What time tomorrow?
---
Disagree, people helped each other back then, pve or pvp. If you dueled a player in your faction they could tell you what to do better. Tank/healer/dps? Same deal, you were all in it together.
---
Since it's open to everyone with an active sub, I suspect it is more than just layering tech. I would guess they want to do a "mini" launch to test out their overall backend tech.
---
They already said 50 realms at launch. I mean if you going by this.
---
Then Blizzcon and Virtual Ticket will have a Beta access with its own server.
---
I don't really know tbh. But it was catchy and all the servers I ever played on, and most of my WoW friends today, still use this acronym!
---
Blasphemy!
---
I got a lazyboi and a mat to go across it. Playing reclined, with my feet up was fkin awesome.
---
Putting serious thought into buying a new sofa with recliners so I can play like I used to. 😂
---
Yeah I remember feeling obligated to compete in Arena just to remain competitive in progression raiding during SSC and beyond.  It sucked because I've never liked instanced PvP outside of Alterac Valley.
---
Well yeah I knew that. I just didn’t know that it was relevant in vanilla wow
---
Yeah that probably wouldn’t fly here haha. Where you from?
---
Are we his victims?
---
One of the rare ones? BC and Wrath Hunter were both MILES better than that crapshot YOLO class they became afterwards. Cannot think of any class that was ruined like this, without actually being overpowered in the first place. Man, I miss playing that one!
---
Nah man, this is like nostalgia at its core for me. VC is an integral part of the Classic experience. Never understood it then either  but it stuck!
---
Stands to reason that if reservation is on the 12th there would be no saved names before that point.
---
What are you on about?  You can go look up the items...
---
Arena Grand Master for the best duelest.
---
WoD has catch-up gear. A non-raider in WoD can get his legendary ring, he can get his shitty LFR gear, he can do all that stuff. He's definitely weaker than someone doing Mythic content, but not as weak as some guy in 0.5 trying to go up against someone in Naxx gear. 
---
I'll respect that you're coming at me with facts, but the context is relevant. There was a gear progression you could take in WoD, you weren't hitting a dead-end if you chose not to raid. I think you were what, 60-70% weaker than someone in Mythic gear? Pretty significant, but a Naxx geared player will legitimately one-shot someone in 0.5.
---
Alliance Ursin, Boulderfist and Bleeding Hollow did.
---
We've been practicing this game for years. Even if spells and talents change, our minds have been exercised in the details. Our eyes and hands are coordinated to work together better. It's definitely going to be easier this time around.
---
My old GT 210 got a 125 on Heaven Benchmark lmao.
---
But still could run clients of pservers at 30-40 fps with some tweaking. Don't how it'll hold on the new one. I'll probably have to make some upgrades.
---
Eh fehk, got me!
---
Quest boards? That’s a thing in wow now?
---
I wouldn't be so absolute and say "it is about raiding." Classic Wow was probably the most open to every play path. Some got to max level and simply RP'd, Some stuck to dungeon sets and playing through dungeons. The guilds back then still had major draw, the community you would be a part of which would keep people coming back. People had different motivations. Your reason to level being raid, which is very valid, is just one of many.
---
Looks like a Gundam
---
Says the loser that likely never got past MC when it was relevant.  Comparing the pirated realms to Vanilla is like comparing building a bridge to walking over top of one.   Getting the information was what created the difficulty.   It wasn't handed to you like today.
---
I like it. Without them they just look like human rogues. Makes us stand out a bit more than just a missing jaw
---
Who said he is on my license plate? I'm LFG, he is in Deadmines.
---
Great video, knows what's up
---
nerd
---
Don't worry, a paladin won't help you much in real group pvp anyways as you're already incredibly vulnerable to dispels and a paladin just compounds that weakness. You basically just need to solve the problem of creating a gap between you and the warrior / rogue / hunter pet / enhance sham. Engineering is good for this, and succubus can be acceptable in really small scale fights (but remember seduce is channeling so anyone competent will just interrupt with abilities like earth shock).
---
If you manage to group with proper peels like rogue hunter mage that will help a lot more than paladins.
---
If you’re struggling to find 5gb of storage then boy do I have some news for you!
---
WHen you are progressing through SSC in a mix of Tier 4 and Gruul/Mag gear, Season 2 gear helped you progress until your BiS gear dropped from SSC (something that could take weeks or months)
---
Hybrid spec only. You're off/raid heals. No feathers allowed!
---
Yea, people are not gonna get gkicked for subpar DPS numbers. Whats gonna get you kicked is failing at mechanics or being a dick. Classic raids are gonna be between LFR and Normal in difficulty. It's not gonna be like Mythic Argus.
---
What you overlook is the dilemma pretty much only warriors do face. Tanks are sorely needed for everything, EXCEPT raiding guilds. Since it's the first spot to fill, every serious raiding guild will already have tanks so prot warriors will basicially get stuck in pugs and 5-10man content.
---
This guy gets it. I never understood why a level 20 would be looking for Dire Maul, but apparently enough of us youngins were so confused we adopted the great acronym of VC!
---
Why do you assume that you can only play if you intend to be the best or stay stat relevant? It seems like community meant nothing to you, which is a major reason why people are looking forward to vanilla returning. Your viewpoint is valid but you can't just outright dismiss other's desires or views.
---
I made the mistake of getting my life back on track. Time to put an end to that.
---
turns out when bosses have less mechanics than the average normal dungeon nowadays and the average players skill level has increased dramatically over the last 15 years things won't be that difficult. I don't know why some people are expecting to need all these consumables to raid.
---
Interesting question to read for me as I'm in a similar situation so I hope OP will allow me to add if that's ok :)
---
How's the gearing for a Holy Pally? It seems like the PvP gear is more itemized for Ret.
---
Is it moderately easy to pug a raid to get some healing wraps or tier gear with a Holy Pal in pre raid BiS on case I don't have time to follow my guilds schedule and be part of the core raid team?
---
Finally for those that are familiar with it, what would be your answers if you switch Holy Pal with Ele Sham?
---
&gt;PS. unfortunately it's not super accurate and sometimes lacks information
---
Seems very spotty. Some of my old chars dont show up at all, and most have their "first seen" at level 60 a year or two after the character was created.
---
That is correct .
---
Blozzard's thought was that prot pally needs to spend mana on self-heals to draw additional threat, which was not reasonable even if executed perfectly.
---
We can literally do the math, right now, to determine their maximum possible DPS. And we have. And it is bad. Really bad.
---
Asmongold was streaming today watching a video on part of the screen. For about 10 minutes in the background, an undead priest was standing in view getting wailed on by 3 guards and a player or two. Everyone was yelling "look at that priest!"
---
Pretty gross that you have to have an active sub. Why would I pay for 3 days of level 15 content?
---
It was pretty awful around big cities but definitely playable. Frame drops happened depending on angle.
---
Perhaps it was a problem as I played on linux tho but Blizzard used to support running WoW on Linux.
---
On the one hand, that could be a really good thing, but at the same time the reason for its exclusion is rather interesting.  
---
I asked Kevin jordan about this directly and he said the reason he removed it is was that it made Ret far too powerful and demanding for a reactive/support class. Paraphrasing what he said, "you don't want more attacks on your action bar that you need to be using every combat when you need to be able to react with bubbles, blessings and heals, all of which are very powerful."
---
He also went on to say that the paladin isn't just a spell-warrior, its a hybrid, and the exclusion of crusader strike means they failed to deliver on the class fantasy of the light-swinging warrior. I also asked him what he would change about Paladin, interestingly his only suggestion was to rework the class around having judgement not consume the seal, with no mention to crusader strike. Clearly, he think the class could be a bit better in some areas but he didn't want them topping the damage meters or having additional "deal some damage" buttons that are technically unnecessary when they already had judgement and seals, which are honestly a lot more interesting than crusader strike.  
---
Sorry for the wall of text, tl;dr, the guy that made the class says the class doesn't need crusader strike, but it could have been improved in other areas to deliver on the class fantasy and make it a bit more fun.
---
Better alternative than having acid thrown on you, I’d say.
---
tomorrow
---
I saw. It's happen before on his stream with the same priest in Un'Goro
---
These posts man. Red=Dead. That's it man, does not matter what level, the circumstance its world pvp and as such all will get  annihilated if possible. Its fun for  a lot of people, and corpse camping, killing flight paths and npcs is also fun. Play a pve server if you have issues with this line of thinking.
---
Saw him today in the background. Had no health in his bar, but withstood 3 guards attacking him. He was on screen in the background for several minutes.
---
This might help.
---
* With and HDMI cable you can connect your PC to a TV, assuming both have HDMI ports.You can the set the TV as the primary monitor for the PC.
---
* if you have a PC gaming controller (or PS4/Xbox controller) you can use it to play WoW viva a program that let's you re-bind the buttons to act as a mouse or keyboard (like the program Xpadder). The just bind it like left joystick is wasd and right is mouse movement, bind the buttons to your wow Hotkey bar and maybe like left trigger is shift so you can do double your buttons using shift modifer.
---
You know I was gonna agree with him but you make a valid point. Could be for stress test tomorrow.
---
There’s just something about trading blows with someone that causes you to understand them. You can feel their desire to beat you and the satisfaction you get from denying that is, in some sense, the soul of contest. it makes the game very fulfilling to play :)
---
I'd rather have servers named after famous players from vanilla. You could roll on MoarDotsGuy, LeroyJenkins, or ERPersInTheTram.
---
👍👍
---
Thanks, I will check some of those out. But of course I cannot eat 15 cups of broccoli :p. That is one of the bigger problems. Some of the recommendations only contain like 2-3 grams of fiber and I should be eating 38g.
---
Agreed! I don't ever recall farming constantly for raiding. Not much at all, in fact. I played both a priest and a rogue and spent much more time in raids than not. I recall MC being easy. Naxx really messed us up but once everyone had the fights memorized, it was smooth sailing for the most part.
---
I dunno I guess that's just what I thought. I'd read hunter wow forums and it seemed like everyone pro focus. 
---
I never thought the hunter needed fixing.
---
16 debuff slots makes them hard to justify in raids. Warlocks end up being a shadow bolt spec.
---
They perform worse than mages in all raid tier content as a result. Though they do perform very well in naxx gear.
---
With this said Warlocks are monsters. Find a shadow priest friend!
---
You sort of do.   It requires like 560 mana and 2 GCDs every 10 seconds.  You can't do that and heal at the same time.   You could try, but you would literally be a waste of a slot.   Your healing output would be a total joke, so you are wasting a raid slot on what amounts to a grace of air totem for 1 group.   
---
That's just fucking dumb.
---
Loving the old school style on this one. And is that some beautiful Kala vocals I hear?
---
And slay every single incompetent trash Rogue that you see*
---
You should have still had a 440mb file.
---
You know fury warriors can tank up to UBRS just fine, right? Without having to respec.
---
So anyone with an active sub. Kek.
---
Boy, they sure are creative with the naming.
---
Every single rogue you see*
---
Taunt in classic was really a cool down/emergency manuever. DPS was expected to manage their threat and reduce output or drop threat when it got too high. Paladins lacked a taunt because the expectation was that they traded that emergency ability for several other powerful emergency abilities.
---
In practice, the additional management required to pull it off wasn't viable with the level of organisation any guilds were capable of pulling off. Even among those capable of doing so, the benefit was non-existent compared to the ease of simply using the much more utilitarian warrior tank.
---
Vanilla roles were pretty much pigeon-holed. The only flexibility you'd get was in Druids and then a little later with Shamans and Priests. 
---
But we should remember that just because certain things became gospel doesn't mean they need to be set in stone. Much of what became the accepted strata in raids was worked out through trial and error and then followed religiously by later raiders.

Thanks for the help! Got the classic download finally
---
Battle shout doesn't seem to add much threat in the beta, are you in it?
---
hey thanks for the link! unfortunately i dont think this is for me since it's gonna take quite a bit before i hit end game stuff haha
---
There are no invites for this sub. Everyone has access to the game if they have a sub. It makes perfect sense to have 21 realms for this stress test.

---
Yes, and they are all "Normal".
---
You saw it here first folks, no PvP servers in Classic ^^/s
---
In wrath we wouldn’t accept pugs in mostly PvP gear.  The ilvl is high but the stats sucked for pve.
---
I'm jealous you managed to hang onto these. I lost my vanilla screen caps to a full Windows reinstall to wipe out a virus.
---
Stress test only
---
I game 8 hours a day consistently and I never have any joint issues because my ergonomics are pristine and I’m always aware of my posture.
---
rushing and min/maxing in a 15 year old game is pathetic.
---
There are way better methods than the generic ones like Xpadder: https://youtu.be/W5K2NrSZvO4
---
Here's hoping that Blizzard forgets and gives everyone beta access on the 20th
---
That's an interesting idea, but they're already splitting the base with class is so I doubt they'd want to split it further. I'd definitely play a ladder if it were available.
---
Can you provide more context with what you mean about it not ending the same way?
---
&gt; Balance doesn't have to mean things being "equally powerful in all situations", it means that everything has a purpose and a situation where it's worth using over any other option.
---
That depends on one's subjective definition of 'balance'.  And the problem is that many game designers (including the kind of people who say 'bring the player, not the class') are more on the "equal in all situations" side of those possible definitions than they are on the "each class has a situation where it is the best choice" side.
---
In TBC my Paladin was by far the best single-target healer in my raid group.  But on some fights (10-man bosses with high aoe damage) it was almost impossible for my healing to keep up, so I had to either bring an alt or get benched for those.  But that was the price I had to pay for ridiculously good single-target healing, and it made the times that I did shine as the best that much more rewarding.
---
Interesting, I hit Install and after roughly a minute it went straight to "Finalizing". I assumed that time was spent copying. Perhaps the download bar just didn't appear until it was finalizing?
---
That’s really fast..
---
T R U E  C L A S S I C  E X P E R I E N C E
---
Fear is just a crutch that bad Warlocks lean on.
---
My favorite system back in the day we’re GRaids. For those that don’t know items that dropped would be auctioned off to the highest bidder and at the end the total gold would be divided among each raider. That way if you got no drops you atleast got gold.
---
I blame Punkrat. It sounds like a P server only thing. I dont know any top guilds that world buffed. Straight up we made fun of people that used consumable as a crutch back in Vanilla. Like seeing someone pot and or tuber in a duel or pvp would get you ridiculed. 
---
The game is different now that we know more, and can min max more, but there just isnt a reason to need to. Its like taking steroids for a gamily dog walk
---
I guess I just don't understand the appeal of reaching Max level and not wanting to experience the endgame content. I suppose as long as you're having fun though that's the most important part.
---
I only heard that for those who got the CE of Vanilla. I mean- I'd happily take my Olympics tabard and dragon pet again.
---
They are opening 21 Realms for the Stress Test?
---
&gt; people might think you're being a dick
---
That means it was frowned upon...
---
I met cooler people playing WoW than I ever did in real life!
---
Your biggest counter is your mana pool.
---
So tribalism just goes away because it's a video game instead of rl?
---
Fair enough, Mortar isn't even so good to reload, and there will be at least someone in the guild who crafts Sappers.
---
And BoP things, Goblin Bomb Dispenser, Goblin Construction Helmet and Goblin Dragon Gun, are frankly quite useless.
---
Imagine respeccing for a dungeon. 😂😂😂
---
I can't think of anyone that made a name for themselves doing it.
---
You’re probably young too, it will catch up with you
---
I can agree with the sentiment. 
---
But 200 hrs of leveling and only playing a few extra days at max is not the best example of how people play. 
---
Most expacs ive played 30+ days in game at max and i feel im fairly casual. So i feel there is a level of importance about what you will be doing at max. So even if i do take the average ps time to level i will still be spending 3/4 of my total play time at max. 
---
I think the main important thing to know is undertanding the role of a class while leveling and at max. 
---
Alot of players have fallen into the paladin trap, getting all excited to play the big beefy holy crusader smacking people. When in reality you wi have a hard time if your not the cloth dress wearing healer.
---
Isn’t that answer obvious?
---
As others have said, it's 7 PPM, so your proc chance is 7 / 60 seconds \* attack delay. Because Seal of Command does a percentage of your attack's damage rather than a flat amount, it's worth noting that you then have even more incentive than usual to use a slower weapon.
---
Looks like fun, I will need to play with this later.
---

---
Saw this website and thought I would share it!
---
Wrong.
---
Just tried 4 hunters 1 priest...it lasted 2 pulls. Going to try warrior 4 priests now.
---
Wirt's Third leg
---
The point is playing what you enjoy and not worrying about racials.
---
&gt;Beyond those 3 everyone else should be warrior/rogue/mage/warlock for DPS
---
Man what is with the Classic community and this stupid mindset. The raids are not some crazy insane hard difficulty that requires near perfection in composition and execution to beat. You can bring whatever class/spec composition you want and take down Ragnaros, it doesn't matter. If you are looking to be efficient to the max, then yes what you say is valid. The level of difficulty is not high enough to warrant that as the only way to play however. Guilds will clear raids with Ret paladins, Oomkins, Shadow priests and feral DPS's. 
---
Everyone needs to calm the fuck down and accept that WoW is not hard, raids are not difficult. The difficulty of raiding in Classic is organizing 40 people, not what class or specialization they are.
---
I'm curious about what will happen long term, too. I could see them doing a 15-year rotation and keeping it up forever. This is kind of becoming a norm for pop culture with cycles of reboots and reimagining of old material. 
---
On the one hand it makes sense. There is far too much for an individual to directly consume over a lifetime, so maybe the last 100 years of entertainment is enough to simply update and cycle through forever, with people always having something new to experience that they haven't seen before. 
---
But we have a cultural memory and even if you haven't directly consumed some aspect of entertainment, you may be aware of it through reference that colors your experience - meaning it will never be new to you if recycled. 
---
There is also the issue of context - movies set in the 50s for example draw heavily on the shared experience of the intended audience having lived through WWII and all of the cultural implications of that.
---
This has become more philosophical than I meant it to, but I am curious what the plan for classic is. They will have to reboot, innovate, or recycle or we will end up with stale environments with everyone at top level.
---
Yes WoTF is gonna be a thing when ur fighting undead, but that gnome racial is amazing for a lock, and imo kinda evens it out. Locks greatest problem in PvP is the rogues who are gonna priority you cause it is a brutal counter, if your Dcoil is on cd forget it bro, anything to help you out with this issue is huge.
---
The stress test will be open to everyone with an active sub I believe.
---
I'm gonna go 2 gathering professions on my 1st alt (probably skinning and mining, since you cant track both mining nodes and herbs in Classic) then start the production professions on my next alts, so they can be boosted in profs right from the start.
---
Will do tailoring+enchanting, mining+engineering, herbalism+alchemy, skinning+leatherworking etc on the classes that can actually use them
---
Imo the least amount of servers the better
---
Dude if they could put in commentary on modern gaming and the trends toward microtransactions and noncommittal ultra super baby mode, thatd be good shit.
---
No because they just dropped it
---
I don't understand why that is 'obvious'. 21 is a lot of Realms, even with all of US/Ocean
---
Great video, can you elaborate for me on the experience differences for killing mobs of different levels? I.e. you're level 6 and you kill a lvl 5, 6, and 7 mob. 
---
Additionally, do quests not change their experience value for the turn in based on your level? 
---
Not for me, you must need a sub to see it.
---
My biggest hope is that the 'getting 40 people' struggle will be difficult enough that people will be brought along as long as they're committed.
---
Its like google maps, its shows an arrow that tells you where to go and wich quests to take, the only automatic thing it does its auto accept quests, but i think you can turn that off if u want to read
---
To a certain extent, yes. They will have to guesstimate how many people stick around for the long haul and then work from there. 21 sounds like it may be right for launch
---
There needs to be a realm called “Nostalrius”
---
typing reee in bold caps makes your argument valid
---
I am being sarcastic by the way
---
Truefaith makes you look nice, exalted makes you look like a stripper (possibly a plus of your character is female) that's the real choice.
---
&gt; cast shield on the warrior before combat starts
---
Warriors gain rage when they get hit, and the beginning of a fight is arguably the most important time for a warrior to have rage so that they can use abilities to increase threat.
---
By shielding the warrior before pull you are denying rage to the warrior and making it more difficult for them to build agro.
---
Luckily your new one doesn't do that.
---
Ya I'm trying undead priest and am stuck at close to 2 hours 20 minutes.
---
This messed me up for years.
---
It’s about whatever you want it to be about ye ole gatekeeper.
---
dope thx man
---
Moroes was the second boss of the first raid (important bit for you to remember - t4 and t5 launched simultaneously, so you're essentially talking about some of the weakest raid gear on the market substantially outclassing the best PvP gear) , a fairly easy raid, and those boots are **way** better than the PvP boots for raiding. What, exactly, are you trying to get at? 
---
Now you're sliding down to "some arena/bg items were better than some **dungeon** items you could get at the start of the expansion." Just stop it dude. You bullshitted, you got called on it, just save face and high-tail it out of here before you make yourself look like a fool.
---
My precious RP
---
The Formula: Enchant Cloak - Greater Nature Resistance server is where it's at
---
DPS warriors who are willing to offtank will be invited instead of you every single time. Not trying to sound like a jerk, but it's true. If you are dead set on melee dps but have no desire to tank, you really should just roll a rogue.
---
i don't think even blizz knows. at least we know there's 16 servers
---
I would guess this is another one of the many many bugs that have happened. They just recently change the way the launcher looks for people that are in this coming stress test and my guess is that during that process the name changed from "stress test and beta" to just "beta". Uninstall the game and see if it still shows on your launcher for you.
---
Yeah, fury warriors are pretty bad ass.
---
who said over?
---
Lmao just from jealous bads. You’re better than me. That’s not fair!!
---
!remindme 2 months
---
Not likely [https://i.imgur.com/z044uUD.png](https://i.imgur.com/z044uUD.png)
---
I would say yes to play, but not sure can you click on play?
---
I would love to see more ret paladins actually dispel their teammates or maybe give freedom to the warrior who is closer to the enemy rather than tunnel visioning and OMG I matter the most while you play catch-up and your teammate is looking at you in a freezing trap....I have no problems with whatever you want to play. 
---
Biggest problem is not because you choose to be different but you don't even support anyone around you when the option is most viable for you to do so. Anyways that's my rant for today.
---
Ask, if they tell you the rules and dont seem fair then dont join, if they tell you but dont give you loot blast them on all chat, if they keep doing it, overtime reputation will catch up to them and no one will pug with them.
---
All the work going on today is for the stress test. It makes no sense that they'd be working on live servers the day before a major stress test.
---
With no EU stress testing on the horizon, I'm hoping to see at least one of the EU realms be named Earthen Ring Reborn, because that shit is gonna be unstable as fuck.
---
Saying that, who wouldn't roll on Dal'rend's Sacred Charge?
---
[Renamed already](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13285/the-blackrock-slicer).
---
With that said, if you want to raid and join a good guild on your server to find out you won’t be invited as a balance druid and have to respec resto you’ve been warned! 
---
The game has changed. People want to play optimally and that’s fine, people also want to play casually and that’s fine too. It will be interesting to see how picky guilds and raid teams can be now that you need 40 humans on at once...
---
Ahh thats a good idea man gonna try that right now.
---
I was originally going to play on an RP server and got talked out of it back in vanilla. I like RP and thought I should pick the server that supported it. 
---
But the argument I was presented with was that in Warcraft, PvP *is* RP. Although the horde and the Alliance are not fully at war, they are also not at peace. Encountering an enemy player should be a matter of determining intent. Maybe they will shank you over that copper node. 
---
Add into this that we didn't have battlegrounds at first and world PvP was all there was. 
---
I remember the first time I saw Stormwind seiged. Practically the whole server participated. It was an opportunity to earn honor and defend other players who were just trying to get out to go quest/dungeon run. The horde had disrupted our activities and we would not stand for it. The Alliance had to fight back.
---
I remember levelling in Stranglethorn Valley, the Alliance's first taste of a shared PvP zone in quest progression. Ganking was rampant. I'd team up with other players and we'd assist on quests just to have protection from enemy players. Of course we did our fair share of opportunistic attacks as well. 
---
PvP is part of the experience. The threat of enemies in the world is worth it and I've never had ganking be so rampant as to completely ruin the experience. At worst, I'd go somewhere else for awhile if he enemy aggression was too tough.
---
Launch day guide:
---
Make a mob targeting and instant cast ranged ability macro, every time you need to fight a new Target.
---
Really? Raid trinkets were the top complaints from arena players. Guess what? That’s the game get over it.
---
&gt;  They still do amazing damage in aoe pulls like on ony.
---
LOL
---
Well now, that is way easier!! Will it work with classic is the question though?
---
Those are the exact same servers we had during the blizzcon demo.
---
That's a bad tank
---
The + hit talent(suppression) in the affliction tree is for affliction abilities only, it does not count for SB since it is a destruction spell. There is not enough debuff slots for a lock to go affliction, let alone the rest of the locks in the raid. If you are lucky some guilds/raid leaders will let some locks put up a corruption for extra damage, but it all depends on your guild/RL/boss. You can wand if you would like, but that wont help much since you will still be inching closer to pulling off the tank if you already had to stop/slow down. Aggro wont be a huge problem for you early on in raiding(factor in tank knowledge/gear). It will all depend on how much hit rating you are able to get honestly, but with 1.12 items you may go into MC/Ony or BWL with much more hit rating then what you had originally would of had in vanilla.
---
For us americans: www.avoidstreamers.com I will definitely use this when picking a server
---
I played from Vanilla up to MoP and was Horde until after WotLK dropped. I've done the Horde content through and through a dozen times, but Alliance I mostly lvled the new races or race-changed my Horde characters to Alliance so I don't remember much of those original zones from the Alliance perspective.  
---
This time around I'm going Alliance and get to go back to OG hunters. Fuck that focus bar shit.
---
And latency is (generally) much lower than it used to be.
---
No problem at all, that's why I am asking. Trying to realistically manage my expectations. I wouldn't mind being a back up/ emergency tank, just don't want to have the weight of the raid on my shoulders consistently.
---
Yes and no.
---
What do you think is more likely
---
\- Server engineers are working on setting up servers for the stress test tomorrow
---
\- Server engineers, the day before a stress test, are working on servers to be released in two months
---
All the meaningful goals can only be achieved after the release though...
---
I feel your pain, I have a desk job too. 
---
Standing desk might be a good investment. 
---
I will mostly be playing while sitting in a recliner with my computer hooked up to my TV. I'll use some sort of lapdesk for the mouse and keyboard in this situation.
---
Gnome warriors *do* look pretty awesome with massive weapons. I lvled a tank gnome through LFG back in the day.
---
Are you missing a finger on your left hand?
---
OP is the fun gatekeeper. If you’re just having fun like them, you’re not having fun. Now everyone please do OP a favor. Limit your play time to his. Don’t bother to learn the ins and outs of game mechanics. Be sure to keyboard turn!
---
What a chad
---
is the client already available for download?
---
It's not cheating tho and everyone should be happy it happened so that they all can report it. The point of the beta is to try to find stuff like this, so well done by them.

Tbc didn’t have welfare epics but that was a really cool story!
---
Sweeping strikes plus MS?  Yeah they did pretty good aoe damage my dude.

One of my favorite things was watching the text appear with the sound of a quill scratching the papyrus. So satisfying..
---
It's my absolute favorite internet trend. We all have an unspoken number of threads in our head which we read but don't personally respond to, while still getting frustrated, and when we hit are personal limit we make a public post calling out all those posts we never bothered to respond to personally. So silly.
---
Ele 100%
---
Been ele main for 15 years.
---
They said anyone with an active sub in NA / Oceanic will get invited. They never said that other players from the EU wouldnt be, just not ALL of EU
---
It's not socially barred if you don't meet a guilds requirements lol.  That's not the definition of socially barred.  Socially barred would mean you do something in the social sphere that people don't like and they exclude you.  Not have a spec they want is just being barred because of the guilds game requirements.
---
If you aren't the main tank, you won't have to worry about having the weight of the raid on your shoulders. There will likely be several other DPS warriors in the raid but you will probably be asked to offtank certain fights or trash pulls.
---
I just had the same issue here. Uninstall it and the option will vanish. Its just a bug/ addition to help people uninstall it.
---
OMG thanks, I couldn't remember my old guild name for the life of me but found it!
---
No you weren’t.  My god this thread is drowning me in bullshit.
---
Creative? Customized unique player characters? Crazy man, this is WoW, you either have all bis gear as instructed by some guy you don't know, or you're a scrub! 
---
Yeah man being one of the best dps with control over your threat is terrible :/
---
If you make an 'americas' starter account, you can get into the Beta from the EU
---
Greece easy mode?  Doubt it
---
Rogues have something that warriors don't have. They generate less threat and they have ways to lower their threat. We don't know how much threat tanks will be able to put out so we could easily find ourselves in a situation where warriors are threat capped but rogues can just keep going.
---
They do they’re just called chloroform.
---
You had to show up in someone’s /who search when they were using the census addon. The original addon didn’t hide the UI, so you couldn’t play while running it and it was just simple screenshots that needed to be uploaded and then parsed. Very few people bothered.
---
Wanna bet?
---
Cold Blizz, Very cold.
---
I feel like a contract for any amount of money but seeing as you talk a big game and don't want to bet the man who even is willing to do all the legwork for you. Seems you're a little upset for no reason.. if you don't care why are you replying. You do care but don't want to put up the coin...

---
Yeah but iam not THAT eager to get into the stresstest. I cant wait. The past stress tests i was invited. This one is not for EU so i dont care. 
---
I do hope though they make one for EU in the future so we get a smooth launch too.
---
The blizzard account I made the ticket from is same email I most likely originally registered my username to originally.
---
Yes moros was early and easy, but he was super desired and the boots were rare.
---
Should i just keep it installed anyway? or just delete and cry along with everyone else? 
---
Also, It just says "World of Warcraft: Classic" no beta &amp; stress test at the end, Is this just the bug the other comment was talking about?
---
I don't see a joke
---
How old are you?
---
In Vanilla would you have to keep the quest in your log for the rest of your life or could you abandon the quest without losing the item as long as you didn't complete it?
---
Besides his shield I think you can get everything visible this summer!
---
&gt;What I'm seeing that bugs me is people who have *never played Vanilla* asking for what's **viable** or what's **the best raiding spec** or what's the **BiS gear** for their class. 
---
Sorry, what? You don't like it when people new to raiding ask for information?
---
Most likely, yes. Uninstall it and see if it goes away. If it does then you dont have anything. :(
---
Well as someone in my thread suggested. If your that eager make a new account and make it a american one. That one will get access but you have to sub for only that. Hard pass from me.
---
Yeah, just checked my rogue that was rolled on launch day and if lists November 12th, 2006.  Wondering if that’s when the site/program went live or something and that’s the earliest date available.  Also, if you swerved transferred, it appears to create a second entry.  Shows my rogue as a 60 on Lightning’s Blade and a level 70 on Executus (which is accurate as I did served xfer towards the end of Vanilla).
---
The real test will be indeed be raid combat in 40 man raiding. At least server input lag wasn't as much of a problem in the world pvp videos I saw. Whether or not you have shit FPS on the client side when everybodys casting their spells is another matter though. Can turn down the particle density and some other stuff to help with that (emphasize own spell effects etc, if they're using a retail framework)
---
my secondary CPU is also low on space, dam.
---
As if the grind spots won't be packed too.
---
The vast majority of players never sniffed 1850. Why are you so butthurt all these years later?
---
bruh what a scummy move
---
Ret Paladins (and Arcane mages) and 3.0.1. "Won't hit live"
---
Paladins that don't cleanse are scum.
---
I'm pretty sure you're not the guy who gets to decide these things.

Shaming people for having fun their own way a video game is pathetic.

Just fyi that those can fuck you up just as bad if you don't switch regularly. (You do you obviously)

I'm planning on doing jumping jacks every time I die or turn in a quest, because any regular break helps me more than anything else.
---
Undead priest, see you at tarren mill.
---
Choose if im leveling warrior or priest first, and who my bank is going to be, no i havent decided yet.
---
Current plan is level something to 5 so they learn enchanting, then i either go on the warrior, the priest or i play priest until i can craft 8 slots bags for the warrior and then go for him.

You’re remembering it wrong or your guild was trash.

When the raids been cleared 1000000 times it becomes about speed. In vanilla what separates hardcore guilds from semi-hardcore and casual guilds isn't succeeding or failing to clear, its the speed at which you do so, until AQ/Naxx at least.

Check out a vertical mouse for that wrist of yours

Why?

1 Warrior, 3 Mages, 1 Priest is easiest.

The point is that Ret can actually do damage and provide support at the same time, holy is all support. Not everything needs to be looked at in a min/max raid context ffs.

Anybody looking for a 256gb SSD that is top tier should check this reddit thread out https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/c0xboo/ssd_adata_su800_256gb_3dnand_25_inch_sata_iii/

It's in the top end of SSDs, just one tier below the MX500 and EVO860, but plenty good for putting an OS and games on. The low end SSDs dont have a DRAM cache, whereas those aforementioned 3 drives too, which helps a lot with the longevity of the drive. With that said, you'll notice you can get that drive in 1TB form for like 80 bucks if you follow that subreddit, or around 100 for the MX500.

Yeah fine with me.

Maybe not if theres noobs. I remember using twig of the world tree for far longer then it was good, because I just assumed the twig of the world tree would have to be the stone nuts lol.

Renaming it to the Black~~rock~~ Slicer really doesn't seem to be any better based on its history.
