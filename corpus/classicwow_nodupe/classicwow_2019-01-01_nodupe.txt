ye, im not gonna sell it.. 
---

---
gonna keep it for classic release :)
---
---
---
That's really the point though, this won't be Vanilla anymore will it? Were entire guilds ever blacklisted server wide? In any case, the odds are the blacklisted guild would have company, other guilds that used the same tactics. They can coordinate with them for dragon kills...
---
I'm not entirely right, here, sorry. I mis-remembered.  
---
This is probably the quote that gave me that impression: [quote](Once we had our starting point, we began taking stock of what we had in the source code and what we could make available, which included restoring the original development database from archival backups. After stitching various key pieces together, we had a locally rebuilt version of Patch 1.12 running internally)  
---
But, source as requested, in the same article:  
---
So we asked ourselves, would it still be possible to deliver an authentic classic experience if we took our modern code, with all its back-end improvements and changes, and used it to process the Patch 1.12 game data? While that might seem counterintuitive, this would inherently include classic systems like skill ranks, old quests and terrain, talents, and so on, **while later features like Transmog and Achievements would effectively not exist because they were entirely absent from the data.**
---
So happy that 2018 was the last year we'll ever have to go without Classic servers! Have a happy new year all &lt;3, see you in Classic!
---
Lol. Yeah, just be master looter with no one complaining and then everything is possible right?
---
Not sure why you try so hard to sell that while it's blatantly obvious that both situations have nothing in common.
---
what i would love to see happen is other companies seeing the success of classic start putting out classic styled mmorpgs and start the second golden age of the mmo genre instead of all these clunky action combat pay to win cash grabs.
---
Some stuff (proc chances and drop rates) are "best guesses" and not necessarily accurate. For example Ironfoe is widely considered to proc more often than it should on a popular pserver i play on. 
---
AV xbow is almost indistinguishable from rokh
---
The reason I'm concerned is specifically that I've had zoning/sharding ruin a big pvp raid in BFA.  
---
Still 2018 over here.
---
R-10 and AV exalted. Yeah it's not grand marshal-tier, but unstoppable force is as good a weapon for pvp as anything you can get pre-ragnaros
---
OMG what do you don't understand in the difference between 1) "Yey very nice I ninjaed this to sell it 2-5 gold to the NPC yey" versus 2) "YEY NOW I CAN GIVE IT TO MY FRIEND IN THE GROUP THAT NEEDS IT / YEY NOW I CAN SELL IT TO THAT OTHER GUY IN THE GROUP FOR 50+ GOLD".
---
You don't see the difference? Really?
---
When you say "everything on farm", do you literally mean everything, as in Nax on farm? Meaning that elemental shamans aren't broken until full t3 or t2.5?
---
This is total BS. In pvp paladins counter locks far more than wotf, and shamans are an easy kill with curse of tounges.
---
Where have you heard that last part?!?!!
---
Mor ladim, devilsaurs and that dragon in blasted lands
---
Dude I don't know if you're trolling, talking out your ass or just a total idiot but they said exactly this.
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-GobXQTf6w
---
Note that he says in a limited and time limited way, mentioning starting zones as candidates for sharing and also mentioning that there should only ever be 1 kazzak up or 1 zone of veins to farm.
---
In the end keeping the ring caused the death of isilidur.
---
Make this game correct for the players that ACTUALLY want it, or suffer.  There’s really no in between as people think there can or should be.  The casual shitters wanted current wow, it’s what led Vanilla Wow to what BFA is, why cater to the market that never wanted Vanilla back anyway?
---
This really really simple.  They have prime examples in front of them in Cata—&gt;BfA, Battlefield 5, D3, Diablo Immortal fiasco, and countless others.  If they tell us don’t buy it, if you don’t like this “hybrid Classic WoW”, you’ll be damn sure the market responds accordingly.
---
I’m not worried really.  And I don’t have much faith in Blizzard to do this right because I’ve heard all the stories of the SJW/Casual-minded shitters that have taken over Blizzard ranks all the way up to Executive ranks.
---
Simple decision-making here and I’ve never seen a better opportunity to draw a line in the sand.  They want our money or they don’t.
---
I agree because I miss getting a talent every level after 10, but at max level, talents are much more interesting than they were before the revamp.
---
Dude Ion said they are only going to use it for the start of the game and in starting zones. He literally said this at BlizzCon, go look up the clip.
---
I'm not going to defend Blizzard for much these days, but this sharding crap is ridiculous when Blizzard has said multiple times that they only intend to use it in starting zones. It's not ideal but it really won't break the game.
---
If we start getting western plaguelands zoned then we can start the riots, but until then they have said their only intention is starting zones.
---
I've never played with WoW tokens, but I assume these are the tokens players can pay gold to get to renew subscriptions?
---
If so, I dont actual care about how someone pays for their subscription. That being said this would increase the number of children playing. Also it may increase the number of gold sellers.
---
When in doubt always go with No Changes.
---
Awesome video though
---
And the 99.99999% aren’t the market for Classic, they have BfA.  There’s really no in between as you think there is.
---
Yes it was called nostalrius and Activision killed it.
---
I like tje idea, and they shouldve done this is retail, in the way you explained
---
But keep it tf outta my vanilla
---
I don't know why would people downvote such a thread. I did exactly one like that like 1-2 weeks ago, and almost everyone commented that no GM tickets and no loot trading is the best.
---

---
This.
---
You can pay real money to buy the tokens then sell then on the AH for gold. 
---
I haven't. I still play here and there. However, I've played less and less since Cata/MoP because of how anti-social it's become.
---
Good point. Thank you for correcting my lapse is absolute no changes judgement.
---
Once again, since it involves more people, it's statistically less probable. And nobody is going to buy shit like that, drops from a random dungeon 
---
Sorry, but my BS se sd it tickling. What you are saying is that lvl 50 zones sharding isn’t out of the question because, you just never know. 
---
It’s not really a pug if you control 4/5 party members
---
Because its buying gold. The economy is better hen there is less gold flying around.
---
I hope every fucking streamer does classic so people who wouldnt have played classic otherwise come in and make it even more popular. Am I excited to play with streamers? not really no. But it adds popularity to the Classic game 
---
By a little longer you mean like 2x-5x time longer,  I guess.
---
"If somebody wants to steal loot they will find a way."
---
This is genuinely a crazy to say. The situation for the ninja is:
---
"Hmm, there's no possible way for me to steal this item I need in this game, guess I'll just roll need like everyone else and hope for the best."
---
vs
---
"Oh cool, there's now a way I can ninja that item I need if I can find other players to help me! Guess I'll do go ahead and do that then."
---
There's no "finding a way" around impossible. Are you daft?
---
if they fuck it up. Then I just start on Pservers again. If those go down then I guess im done with blizzvision being they arnt putting anything else out that I care for. Even though I do have a phone..
---
I dont think anyone cares if you can buy your Classic subscription on Retail with tokens, but gold has real value in Classic and should not be sold outright.
---
Wotf doesnt invalidate alliance warlocks as many seem to think. UD being the worst race raid wise will make them less desirable
---
Except there was no attack on his character at all. He provided exactly 0 evidence to support his assertion, while making guarantees he is not in a position to make.
---
If he provided no evidence, then he can be dismissed without any further reason. There is no need to show why their argument is invalid since he didn’t actually make one, he just stated his opinion as fact.
---
He started with 0 credibility and went negative by how he presented himself.
---
Unless you’re claiming that the burden of proof is in everyone else aside from the person making the claim?

I know I'm missing some and again this is probally way the hell off, a ton of this depends on your tank knowing the pulls and where to go, how quickly the pulls are done such as CC and the speed of your DPS, also downtime such as drinking, rebuffing, rezzing. There are a ton of factors that could make the shit go WAY faster or WAY slower but to the best of off my head those numbers look ok to me.
---
Yes. There were guilds on my server in Vanilla that were blacklisted server wide. 
---
Not sure how trusting another guild that is know for ninja-ing could be beneficial. But sure. 
---
And swapping to master looter as the boss is about to die denies you the opportunity to just leave, while also giving them 100% control on drops.
---
Seriously, you already are an asshole. Stop using loot trading as a justification for it.
---
I was playing Runescape at the time. I mustve been 9 or 10 when I saw the trailer for the first time. It was everything I wanted and more. I stuck around with the hope of WoW returning to its old philosophy. Classic WoW is the next best thing.
---
You do understand you can swap master looter on at any time, right?
---
Not sure why you need to ignore how everything works in reality to say that you’re right.
---
If you want to be an asshole and ninja loot, swapping to master looter just as a boss dies is the single most effective means of doing so.
---
Stop using loot system to justify toxic behaviour.
---
I dont like it but id rather tokens in a cash shop over sparkle horses, we all know kotick's crack addiction demands a cash shop sooner or later.
---
There's more former WoW players than current retail players. 
---
Why would you want to play something you know dicksquat about as a sub 18 YO?
---
No gold is being added to the game this way.
---
I thought I did, obviously I was wrong.
---
No, it won’t replicate the magic of the old days, it will create new and equally as great magic.
---
Because farming and earning gold was a bigger part of vanilla than it is in retail. In retail having gold just gets you extra shit like xmogs, pets, etc that isn’t necessary. Your passive gold income covers your needs. In classic though farming was part of raid prep. Passive income no where near covered raiding costs. Allowing tokens in classic would be allowing ppl to bypass some of the work required to participate in raids with money. 
---
Also classic will have a separate economy from retail. If tokens are there they won’t be 120k ish.
---
said on stream?
---
&gt; During the day it was generally fine though, but evenings every day after work i had to wait around 1-2 hours to get in :/ 
---
Lol seriously?! Like even long after release?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Causes general inflation, just like printing money in real life, the first people to buy gold get more value out of it, people who buy later will probably have to pay double or more for the same items.
---
It eventually makes collecting and vendering grey items is basically pointless, but if everything's inflated that means if you sell items on the auction house the odds are you can charge a lot and it makes skill training and respeccing "cheaper" because gold in general is easier to get. Same thing happens on all servers eventually, people have more gold than they know what to do with because all the best items are earned through raiding, and the AH prices get all wonky and nonsensical. (players who are used to new servers sell items for a "fair" price, but on this server it's dirt cheap, so you can easily just buy it and resell it for double.)
---
Better server performance btw LOL
---
This guy spreads misinformation like wildfire.  He probably knows but just doesn't care.
---
Yes, that's the point. This is WARcraft, you are in a war. You form guilds to have mutual support and protection. This is a competitive game you know. Not only you are competing against the opposite faction, there is also intrafaction competition between guilds, like poaching top raider and getting server first.
---
Don't tell me you joined a guild because of the tax break and the pizza coupon?
---
Not insane enough to warrant going over 3 pieces
---
Gold is scarce in classic my dude. It’s pay to win. You can buy BIS crafted gear with your token gold and with barely any power creep in vanilla these items stay BIS up until Nax. Pretty much making people pay to keep ahead of the curve is not very good. 
---
As someone that actually had their account hacked, and everything stolen, (pre any form of 2 factor auth) I don't care if they add the token, this was something I wish they'd done in Vanilla, and would be fine with now.  Do you really think gold buying won't happen if Blizz doesn't offer the token?  It will, but it will all be shady as fuck people doing it, and damaging the economy and hacking accounts while they are at it, just like in original Vanilla.
---
Read when I said : 
---
&gt;As soon as someone turns ML, I will be suspicious. I barely ever did 5 mans with ML back in the day. Why would I today?  
---
Stop making everything look like ML is the problem. Need/greed with loot trading will be the problem.
---
No. MMO's like classic WoW are not profitable ENOUGH. Sadly, capitalism seeks to maximize profits, and MMO's with no microtransaction bullshit, and a hardcore play to win atmosphere, don't do well with capitalism.   
---
Making a video on this topic currently.
---
&gt;just like printing money in real life
---
This is not even remotely how tokens work.  
---
Agreed, people keep saying this like its law. As if Warlock has no other ways to control an enemy for the next 5s oh the humanity.

They get ok with T2.5. With BiS naxx gear they break pvp. So everything on farm. I wouldn't really bother with full dps ele until AQ40 and you have it on farm, offensive healer is the best way to play until you have the gear to start blowing people up.
---
Like this thing is, once people are on the shaman the shaman cannot do that much to get away and cast. So the entire viability revolves around being able to blow people up before they notice you. I'd say that once your lightning bolts start hitting for around 1K without trinkets elemental can start really showing how powerful they can be. You will need a fair bit of spell power for this though. With the totem (item not spell) that increases lighting bolt and chain lighting damage by 33, i need about 550 spell power to do that.
---
In case someone didn't understand, loot trading, by allowing trading BoP items for 2h with the group members that killed the said boss, allows the 2 following situations (that were not doable in Vanilla) :
---
1) You can roll for an item, win it, and give it to your friend that is in the group if he needs it (more % chance of winning an item since many friends can help someone by rolling too)
---
2) You can sell the item to a group member for a LOT of gold if that person need it really badly. Back in Vanilla, your only choice was to sell the item to an NPC for 2-5 golds.
---
See the problem now?
---
People are jumping the gun and automatically hating anything blizzard does because they’re edgy. It’s just the cool thing to do these days to hate on popular companies 
---
I’ve played at the launch of every major server since Nost came back online in 2016 (iirc), and those experiences have definitely swayed my opinion on sharding at launch. The game world is simply not made for that many players competing for kills/items.
---
I personally love the original leveling experience, and even though PvE is my big aspiration in Classic, I will also enjoy a lot of time on alts
---
Removed rule 1. 
---
Wrong, loot trading is for greed rolled bop items only.
---
Loot trading is only for bop greed rolled items.
---
Ok, you leave when they swap master looter as the boss dies. Nobody attempting the ninja cares. They already got the kill and, if it dropped, the item.
---
Using loot trading to funnel loot to specific players requires you to control the majority of the party for it to be even remotely viable. But if you control the majority of the party, it’s extremely likely you also have the group leader among the conspirators.
---
You are right, these 2 methods aren’t comparable at all. The one I am explaining is vastly superior and exists regardless of loot trading. 
---
It’s fine to not want loot trading. But to say loot trading shouldn’t be allowed because it’s a less effective means of being a ninja than existing loot options is worse than just saying you don’t want it because it wasn’t originally in vanilla.
---
That’s how loot trading has always and will always work.
---
Funny I seem to remember a certain mmo going down the drain because it catered to the casual majority. I hope you enjoy  this new exciting feature in ‘classic wow’
---
Hey! I recently made [this controversial post](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/a9qbj7/unpopular_opinion_not_implementing_the_wow_token/) regarding the WoW token so you can read through that for a lot of the reasons people give.
---
I want to point out that I'm not one of those pro-Token people who thinks it won't impact the Classic experience. I 100% acknowledge that it will impact everybody's Classic experience, most likely negatively.
---
The reason I still argue that we need the WoW Token is for a larger, *meta* reason. The WoW Token, without a doubt, [destroyed the black market gold-selling industry.](http://www.cracked.com/personal-experiences-2228-im-paid-to-play-mmorpgs-its-nightmare-5-realities.html)
---
&gt; “Jeremy thinks he has only a few years left in his job, and here's the big reason:
---
&gt;[Image of WoW Token]
---
&gt; If you're a player looking to buy your way to better gear in WOW, you can buy a $20 token that can then be traded in an in-game auction house for gold. The purchaser of the token can't redeem it for cash—they can use it only toward free months of their game subscription (to prevent farming).
---
&gt; Jeremy says the decision caused a panic among the gold farming community. And although the demand for black market gold still exists, Jeremy has seen his income fall, despite putting more hours in this year than last.”
---
Like Prohibition as a reaction to end excessive drinking once-and-for-all, no form of *moderating*  (either in-game via banning or off-game [via criminalization](https://www.cnet.com/news/china-bans-online-gold-farming/)) has had as significant an impact on gold-selling as offering a safe alternative. To believe or argue otherwise is akin to arguing for abstinence-only education. It simply Does. Not. Work.
---
Gold-selling itself is not the problem, but coming from anyone other than the developer, it's an attack vector for their customer base. When gold-selling goes wrong your customers are in real world danger, facing crimes such as hacking, identity theft, credit-card fraud, etc.
---
My contention is that a responsible company cannot afford to pretend it's still 2004 when it comes to everything we've learned about how to destroy the black market gold selling industry. The analogy I'm trying to draw is that any company seriously marketing a replica of a Model-A Ford vehicle without 2019 security features (or at least a damned seat-belt) [is morally and ethically wrong.](http://www.mafca.com/seat_belts.html)
---
By the way, yes, there is controversy in the replica automobile community over whether it is okay to install seat-belts or not. You can assume what side I'm on.
---
Is adding the Token to Classic going to change the experience of Classic? Yes. 100%. But so is having Classic be attached to the modern B.Net client. Or having 2019 Wowhead + Data-mining. Or other security features that Blizzard has already assured us will be present in Classic whether we like it or not.
---
At the end of the day, the WoW Token is an admission that we now understand how to responsibly manage gold-selling in 2019. To uninstall this safety feature is, in my opinion, to remove seat belts from your vintage car for “nostalgic reasons.”(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_car_crash_songs)
---
**EDIT:** You'll notice I completely sidestepped the issue of whether or not people who seek out black-market gold sellers “deserve” to get hacked or their bank accounts stolen. I ignored this because it's a **fucking stupid** argument that only a thirteen year old would use. 
---
Players will use these services. Period. Full stop. It's up to the developers who run the game environment to implement systems that will protect their users and oftentimes that means protecting users from themselves. We've learned this the hard way.
---
I appreciate the honesty for a change. "We want this fairly major exploit to be in the game so we can take advantage of the idiot players who believe the devs when they say it's just for correcting honest mistakes. Every inch they give us we'll use to run as far as possible, just like every other video game."
---
I know that's how at least 70-80% of guilds will look at this rule, so I've got nothing against you for saying it straight. I'd personally love it if you could break off with your faction entirely and take the game over in territories like a real war game would let you do. But alas, the "war" in this case Does mean with the opposing faction, and the classic game was clearly designed to keep people on friendly terms with most of their faction, expressed most clearly by it's 100% fair looting and binding system. Competing for devilsaurs and dragons, are exceptions, but they aren't a big part of the game.
---
so did they sell the horde version in us and alliance in eu? 
---
US had both, if memory serves me right
---
A remote control?
---
Check yourself
---
The good old days. Also telling people alt+f4 was a hot key. I fell for it once also. Happens to all noobs I feel 
---
On the original server I rolled on, Dethecus, there was an elite Alliance hardcore guild call &lt;Jesters of Doom&gt; most of whose members apparently rolled over from everquest or something.  They were dedicated to doing end game content when most of us were busy with trying to get epics mounts and raiding 5 man dungeons with 15 people for gear. 
---
JoD was so "elite" that they basically refused to talk to anyone outside the guild.  I'd leveled with one of the guys who later joined up and he would no longer respond to my tells after joining. They were kind of stuck up shitheads, but there were attempting content no one else was.  All and all they were a bit of a mystery and some of the few times I saw them active was watching them run back after a 20 man Ony attempt.  People were in awe of some of the MC geared they'd picked up (A real purple) while inspecting them in IF.
---
During this time I was busy running 5 mans, getting myself and others through the Ony quest line (no mean feat back decent tanks didn't exist), in order to get ready to raid.  There were a bunch of well-known guilds on my server but no one really had enough people to raid the MC or do Ony so we spent our days making up PvP or dungeon content for ourselves.  
---
At some point, JoD posted on the forums about how elite they were when they took down the first boss in the MC(Server first).  People praised them for it, and it kind of started a group of alliance guild's trying to do the MC together.  We didn't make it very far(IE we died on teh trash), but we all knew we wanted more.  Besides JoD I don't think anyone had tried Ony on the alliance side.  JoD stopped posting much about their progress and no one really knew what they were up to.
---
During this time we had multiple city raids against each other starting with the alliance's successful kill of the leader of Thunderbluff, followed by repeated horde failures to kill the leadership of SW, IF, and Darn.  The horde even organized a 3am raid and managed to kill the wrong boss in Darnassus.  On the forums they tried passing off that the priestess of the moon was the leader of the city instead of the archdruid.  Eventually, the alliance successfully killed thrall during prime time claiming total victory over the pathetic horde.  We ran 2 raids groups:  One 20 man group to attack the gates of Org, but not go inside to far and get owned by saurfang to pull the Horde out while the backdoor raid took thrall out.  It was a very close fight, but most of the horde was distracted by the raid out front.
---
One day a horde guild posted that they had downed Onyxia(I don't remember who it was, sorry).  The alliance was shocked.  We'd thought we were the elite faction with all the good players and some random horde guild, not nearly as elite as JoD other guilds beat us to the kill.  Dethecus world PvP was very fierce with the majority of the server trying to kill the other faction on sight.  We even had an e-famous rogue named Awngee camping the alliance boats 18 hours a day killing lowbies.  Both sides hated each other.
---
Because JoD didn't seem to be doing shit with Ony and because our pride was so hurt,  we formed our own Ony PUG taking the "elite" players from every guild, expect for JoD who declined to take part.  They could have shown so real leadership if they'd lead the group instead of blowing us off.  2 days and 9 attempts later we downed that bitch for an alliance first Ony kill.  This event kind of launched raiding as a thing on Dethecus and every guild got into it.  Well everyone but JoD.  They kind of faded away after those first couples of MC boss wins and once the rest of the server got into raiding.
---
I still wonder what happened to &lt;Jesters of Doom&gt;.
---
Probably true, I know nothing about them, I was going on the commenter above knowing what he was talking about.
---
Personally, I played on one of the top 10 lowest pop realms in North America until the very end of WotLK (transferred to a heroic ICC guild on my bear; first of many transfers).
---
I loved my low pop realm, the only part that was a bit problematic was finding groups for low level dungeons, but I honestly felt like I found successful dungeon groups more frequently on that realm than any private server I ever played on.

You will destroy undergeared players regardless.

100% agree. If they do classic 100% authentic then they could save their stock prices from going the same way as EA!
---
You are making two different fallacious arguments yourself here.
---
The first is [non-sequitur](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/136/Non-Sequitur). Remember, you started with saying that it was not an ad hominem attack. 
---
&gt;It’s not actually an ad homenim attack, though.
---
Now you say there was no attack on his character because it was not an attack, despite the confirmation earlier that he was accused of being unable to spell or doesn't bother with spellcheck, or hasn't researched facts (an attack on his character):

&gt;by someone who either isn’t capable of spelling, didn’t bother with spellcheck, or didn’t care while having no special authority or insight on the topic at hand should not be taken seriously.
---
His ability to provide evidence, or his presentation of it, is not a resolution to whether or not his character was attacked (just whether or not it was justified).
---
Second, you have created [straw man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man) arguments to finish, by focusing on a secondary and third path away from the original argument.
---
1. You create a new argument (based on your opinion concerning evidence) about whether or not the original argument was even made. 
---
2 You change focus to the "burden of proof". You hope to "win" the original argument by creating one that is actually completely different from the original presented and making false assertions about what I am claiming.
---
This kind of arguing can go on for hours, but it's not a resolution of the original argument and it doesn't really solve anything. Even if you "win" your new arguments, it doesn't mean anything, because you created and ended them yourself.
---
**Straw man**
---
A straw man is a common form of argument and is an informal fallacy based on giving the impression of refuting an opponent's argument, while actually refuting an argument that was not presented by that opponent. One who engages in this fallacy is said to be "attacking a straw man."
---
The typical straw man argument creates the illusion of having completely refuted or defeated an opponent's proposition through the covert replacement of it with a different proposition (i.e., "stand up a straw man") and the subsequent refutation of that false argument ("knock down a straw man") instead of the opponent's proposition.This technique has been used throughout history in polemical debate, particularly in arguments about highly charged emotional issues where a fiery "battle" and the defeat of an "enemy" may be more valued than critical thinking or an understanding of both sides of the issue.
---
Straw man tactics in the United Kingdom can be known as an Aunt Sally, after a pub game of the same name, where patrons threw sticks or battens at a post to knock off a skittle balanced on top.

All the things you listed still occur with the WoW token in place. Gold selling is still a thing through private sellers, and people who dont have proper authentication still get hacked
---
If it was gear you needed why didn’t you roll need and if somebody else rolled need against you and won why would they then trade it to you? Unless of course they are your friend and you are abusing the system OR you have geared alts this way on retail and have no clue how classic works. 
---
Where i live (worst pary of canada the quebec) the us and eu version were sold due to a law to have a french version of the booklet. They had to put sticker to tell ppl wich one was the one to connect to the french server
---
False. The answer is Bears. Bears are the #1 threat to ~~America~~ Classic.
---
OH i would believe that there's no way that we'd see sharding up this high level. My fear is that sharding will make it into zones like Duskwood but even this I consider unlikely.
---
Then again it appears that the hardcore haters that wow has bred over the years won't just relax and wait to see what happens. Can't change those stubborn minds.
---
no changes, no experiments. no QoL improvements, just fking vanilla. Thanks
---
“I speak for Blizzard’s MOST LOYAL fan base!”  (Says person who plays on pirate emulated servers that use Blizzard’s IP and pay nothing for it, and is threatening to steal more IP and still pay nothing unless they get their way.)
---
Everyone throwing around blacklist as if somebody immediately gets put on the naughty list as soon as they commit a wrong. Community policing works for sustained asshole behavior but if everybody is doing it and it’s rather infrequent and subtle nothing is going to come of it. 
---
Natures swiftness into ghost wolf 👍
---
Sorry, but saying that someone presented themselves poorly and didn't research their facts isn't an attack on their character when that reflects reality.
---
Let me demonstrate what is an attack on character: You are an idiot.
---
It's not a strawman to require someone to have either special insight into a claim they're making that's verifiable, or that they provide evidence to support that claim.
---
For someone who likes to link to wiki pages about logical fallacies, you sure as hell don't seem to understand them.
---
No further response to you is warranted, as I've aptly demonstrated my point to anyone reading this.
---
Im in Canada and only ever saw the Alliance box (Still played horde though!)
---
Have a good day carebear 
---
Happy cake day. Also best comment in this thread. 
---
When people think about WoW tokens they often think about people buying tokens with their in-game gold in order to pay their subscription fee.
---
But what people forget is the part where people have to buy the tokens with their real life money and THEN sell them on the auction house to other players for gold.
---
So the player willing to spend real life money buys gold, and the player willing to spend their gold buys subscription time (money).
---
The loot sharing makes me nervous for this fact. While not enough to deter me of course, its at least one minor strike. So far news has been mostly positive. Their blue posts share the communities general philosophical stances. Mostly. I hope they don't screw it up. Its still Activision/Blizzard after all. 
---
Except for in style points
---
Your a retard when you claim it was worse without Loot Trading. I played during 3.2 when Loot Trading was introduced and have experienced the concequences myself. Joining a pug and realizing your in a grp with 2-4 friends that is needing for friends is no fun I can tell you that you idiot.
---
if i was in america I wouldn't have shitty ping lol
---
The memories.....I was also on bonechewer. I remember VM and their world first ptr kills in Sunwell during tbc. 
---
Nah man I’m playing it as long as it’s 80% there lol
---
Or, you could rather have neither of those things.
---
I think they're going to be happy to take everyone's money for the first 2 months and just ride the hype, then they'll not fix the bugs, they won't respond efficiently or correctly, they'll add restrictions nobody asked for, add features nobody requested and within a year we'll be close to retail.
---
Ion specifically said they will Loot Trading in Classic at Blizzcon because "its the same as asking a GM to trade loot".
---
I’m so nervous for this game. Like, I worried they are gonna fuck it up. 
---
Rank 10 gear won't be available at the start, either
---
r/classicwow are not going to be the only ones playing, in case that's somehow slipped your mind... There will be toxic players. There will be noobs from retail who know nothing about ninja looting. There will be people who don't give a shit. Would you rather a community that doesn't have to worry about this kind of thing? Or would you prefer Azeroth turning into Ancapistan?
---
Keep in mind the rank 10 gear won't be out for likely several months
---
Sharding and right click reporting. Barrens chat made a mark on internet culture, will there be ANY barrens chat with right click reporting? How about you are rank 13 and 40 people spam report you? That 1 or 2 day auto ban means 1 to 2 extra weeks of playing 18 hours a day. 
---
[removed]
---
I think it is fair to say it has been proportionally massively reduced. 
---
Yes tokens were a mistake. Blizz should have come up with some other way of preventing real world gold buying services.
---
Joana is outdated and overrated, his route is kinda trash nowadays, there is plenty of hunters on pservers who are miles ahead of him.
---
I don't trust current Activation Blizzard not to mess it up. If classic is popular, they will want to further monetize it even though people already pay a sub fee.
---
&gt; Need rolls always bound the loot in retail and greed rolls could be traded. 
---
BoP loot was always bound no matter if you clicked need or greed and BoE loot was never bound no matter if you clicked need or greed...
---
They want to use Loot Trading, as in making all BoP tradable for 2h, so that people will not ask GMs to correct loot mistakes.
---
Basically, the trash prior to the dungeon is the queue for the dungeon itself. You make your dungeon-group simply by killing that trash. This is true for Gnomeregan, RFK, Wailing Caverns and a bunch of other places. 
---
When you finally get inside, you already have your plan down for how to tackle mobs. The issue is, mobs are like fucking Dark Souls. Someone could pull 2 stray mobs which have unique or strange mechanics that need specific counters or stategies from your tank or healer. The real issues occur when the group wants to go fast, forcing the tank and healer to keep up with all of these mobs and their abilities at the same time.
---
Whereas, in comparison, the only thing you need to worry about in Legion is at least 1 of the DPS is trying, your healer doesn't AFK and keeps you shielded, and you keep aggro away from the healer, which is boring, tedious, mindless shit compared to classic. 
---
If your hunters aren't trapping, if your rogues aren't sapping, if your locks aren't soulstoning, if your hunters pet is unhappy, if your hunters pet has growl, if your healer is out of mana because dps is too low...the complexities of issues that can occur in classic that would never and can't ever happen in retail is astounding.  
---
The poor retail babies who haven't played private servers. EU guilds will have multiple 60s within 8 days of release. The forums crying about NOPE is going to be hilarious. 
---
US will be more chaotic as there is no real US scene, but the good players will gravitate together quickly. Over the course of 6 servers I met enough good US people, but not enough good US east people. That 3 hour time difference is too much for people working full time. 
---
provide your evidence for me to review
---
I'm sure people have found better methods in the 10 years its been since vanilla. I just thought it was decent stream to put on in the background to ring in the new year if you got nothing to do tonight like myself.
---
You know I feel like Elrond probably could have just tackled the guy and got the ring off him or hurl him into the lava. I mean Isildur could have put the ring on but it was a narrow walkway and Elrond prob could have taken him.
---
You lost me so quickly haha
---
This is legit. I'm excited to hear what you think about it. Hopefully I catch it on here at some point. Plus you're on this sub so you probably already have a pretty good idea of what you're getting into.
---
Really depends on how skilled and knowledgable the players in your group are. I'd say on average they all probably take twice as long. There's a lot more CCing and single targeting. Some dungeons like Mara can take a hell of a long time (2-3 hours) if you're doing a full clear. Sunken Temple is much longer because blizz removed over half the dungeon etc. WC also had some removed content I believe
---
&gt;if you got nothing to do tonight like myself
---
If you have nothing to do, you can always jump on a pserver and test best routes for yourself, it'll give you better results than watching this.
---
The other day I asked someone who was obviously doing the same quest as me if they wanted to party up for the quest, and they just said "no thanks I'm good." That sole interaction increased my anticipation for Classic exponentially.
---
Im not watching this for tips my dude. It's just a sip of nostalgic. I feel like youve taken this post as a personal insult or something.
---
I've been following his guide and so far it seems pretty good. Though Ive only gotten to level 20 and dont plan to go further so I can save some of excitement for Classic
---
When a players kills a mob, some copper may drop along with some grey items.  Vending those grey items to a NPC will exchange them for more copper.  Fundamentally speaking, these are the only two ways that gold is created.  Now automate the mob killing and vending process and you've created a bot, which in turn contributes to inflation.
---
Purchasing a Token is different as the value is locked and the gold is simply traded from the seller to the buyer.  No gold is created, and this process competes with bots.  One could then argue that Tokens prevent some amount of inflation equal to however much botters suffer because of them.  Making Tokens marginally good for the economy.  If you're a complete skeptic of the system and don't agree Tokens combat bots, then Tokens don't impact the economy at all... which is a huge improvement over bots inflating it.
---
I'll leave my opinions out of this, but I just wanted you to let you have a proper reference for making up your own opinions.
---
Of course its been reduced, but gold in retail and gold in vanilla are two completely different entities. If they add the WoW token it will completely devalue the level of satisfaction that comes from things such as professions, BOE's, etc.. Yes there is a pro to adding a WoW token to classic, but the cons definitely outweigh the pros. 
---
Lol, enjoy huddling together with your guild for warmth. Aka retail.
---
So you can turn db entities intinobjects with an ORM. Either entity franework in C# or Hibernate/JPA in Java. It speeds up databasing massively. Check it out! It will make you a better engineer I promise.
---
They absolutely did. You could get 7 kills, die, call in your heli and be primed for a second heli before you knew it.
---
You do realize they are working on other Diablo IP's right? Not every release is going to be for you so stop being a whiney asshole
---
But isn't classic being included in the retail sub? 
---
If tokens are introduced into Classic that means that you can now convert your retail gold to tokens to classic gold which would completely wreck the economy of Classic
---
I was in Blood of the Horde on Stormrage when we were pushing content. I remember our GL left to join his brother on alliance side to the number 1 guild on the server. If I remember right it was a top 20 world at the time.
---
Some kids can't appreciate things for what they are.
---
Ohhh, I think I get it now, thanks for that! So, players give gold to activision for subscription fees, and other players buy it from activison for cash. Yeah, that's totally different. Shouldn't effect inflation one bit. Really quite an elegant system in the end.
---
The world is designed for 2500 people, and only raised to about 3k or so right before TBC. But otherwise you are right, 10k, or hell 5k is an unplayable mess and ruins both the feel of the game and all of the core systems. As far as sharding so they can have more people on a realm you are going to have to come up with an actual source, as I see no reason they would ever expand the cap past the original 2500. Having more people in the world in the second zones when sharding goes away would be a disaster.
---
Yeah mage vs shaman is basically, either mage kill shaman during counterspell or mage lose or have to run away.
---
Community shall be the least of the problem I think, since at the end of the day, it will be made up by us, who wanted this in the first place.
---
I wouldn't worry about it. Once classic exists the loophole they are using to avoid shutdown goes away and all servers hosted in europe will go dark. They will be back to playing on 20 man servers hosted in russia with 1k+ ping and the server owners stealing their info to sell to people.
---
Yeah but regardless of whether wow tokens exists or not people will buy gold. The only difference is when 3rd party services are used to sell gold more gold gets generated by bots and mass farming. When blizzard decides to "sell gold" none is created and instead is traded around. The gold farmers cause a ton of inflation while the token prices are controlled by blizzard.  
---
Honestly I don't really care if tokens do or don't exists, but it's not like wow token = evil and how it was in vanilla = good. And please don't tell me how gold farming is against the rules and that cuts down on it cause that shit has existed in every single mmo I've ever seen and in mass.
---
I care because it's facilitating pay-to-win. Fresh level 60? Buy some WoW tokens and use them to buy all your BoE BiS gear immediately. Things like epic mount training become far less prestigious, because you can't tell if someone earned it through hard work and dedication, or if they just happened to have some spare cash.
---
And this is all assuming that subscriptions are isolated. IIRC, Blizzard wants to bundle Classic into the Retail subscription. And now you have an economic link between the two games, something that nobody (including Blizzard, who have explicitly stated a desire to keep the game worlds separate) wants. Thankfully, these elements combined would seem to suggest that WoW tokens aren't happening in Classic.
---
There's also the economic incentive problem - this adds even more incentive for hyper-efficient gold farming into the game, because now it's actually worth IRL money. Previously... well, past a certain point, you just didn't have any use for gold. And that was good, because it reduced the value prospects of gold farming, thus placing less stress on the game world (remember that gold farming affects the world for non-farmers as well) and helping to mitigate inflation.
---
This is why I hope Classic is not a massive success. I hope it's only JUST successful enough that they'll keep the servers on, but not so much that they start to see dollar signs.  
---
EQ introduced the krono (kr) some years back and have completely ruined the economies on each TLP server. High end items are usually bought and sold with kr OR it's pp (platinum) equivalent. 
---
Within hours of WoW classic launching you will see players auctioning high value items for WT (WoW tokens) and folks are right. WT will completely fuck the servers economy. 
---
You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.
---
They never used the words "will" be disabled. They have been very specific about not being specific about Loot Trading...
---
I bought it in the US and have the Night elf/dwarf version.
---
I haven't played retail WoW since the WotLK expansion so I can't make any comparison but I think it's fair to say that you can estimate the average time per dungeon to be around 2 hours in vanilla, sometimes more sometimes less.
---
You have to remember that a lot of the time for a dungeon run is spent to actually put the group together and then get to the dungeon before you can even start clearing it, and for certain dungeons it can take really long to even get there.
---
For example if you're in the level 35-40 bracket on Alliance and you want to run Scarlet Monastery (because everyone wants to run it during those levels since you get some really good loot from there) you'll most likely be in Stranglethorn Vale leveling and you have to make it all the way to Tirisfal Glades which is the Undead starting area. You probably don't have even the 60% mount so the whole group has to run there on foot which might take 30-40 minutes.
---
I've personally seen on private servers in worst case scenario it taking over 3 hours for a person to make it inside the dungeon but you probably shouldn't expect it to take nearly as long 95% of the time.
---
Maybe 30 minutes to put a group together, 30 minutes to get to the dungeon and 1 hour to clear it if you don't wipe at all. But that's just a guess on average, some dungeons will take you a bit longer to do especially the longer ones like Maraudon or BRD if you want to do a full run.
---
That's like telling a level 30 night elf warrior to fight a level 50 human warrior. It aint happening bro.
---
Other than LBRS/stocks I'd say you're looking at maybe half an hour longer than that for them on average unless you have a group speed-clearing with little to no mistakes at all.
---
If you can get a solid 10-15 rogues /druids together for wpvp you can do so much.
---
Pservers still won't know how Onyxia's deep breath works.
---
WotLK would be great if they kept the gameplay like classic and tbc. I hated dungeon finder and the dungeons them selves. Raids I liked but still.
---
That's literally all I want. Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, FFX, Pokemon Firered, etc. are all remasters of my favorite games.
---
I don't give a shit about playing 99% of new titles. I just want to play the games I grew up with. 
---
1) Helping people out because the game is hard. I'd like people to know that I'm someone who's always willing to help, and I love that with server communities can be tight enough for this to be a possibility.
---
2) Leveling! I loved leveling characters back in the old world. Raids and dungeons are fine, but the open world content is why I fell in love with WoW, and it's still my favorite thing to do. I like the challenge and that the things you loot are useful. I like that it's slow. Everything from level 1 is relevant content. I also love the random players you meet and group up with for quests.
---
3) Slower gameplay. I love playing a paladin in Vanilla. I'm glad it won't be just pressing the attack buttons that I want and that's it. Paladins in Vanilla were a lot of auto-attacking, but you have to manage the seals, auras, buffs, heals, utility skills, etc. I can't wait. Other classes are fun too, of course.
---
Honorable mentions, in no particular order:
---
Crafting.
---
Blues and purples having real value (and of course legendaries).
---
More meaningful guilds.
---
Old night elf models and human male hair styles.
---
The only way you have described it as easy is with the reasoning of tackling it with overleveled players. 
---
Not really accurate. The pirate servers hosted in europe are using a loophole in european law relating to emulation of games that are not available currently. Since blizzard does not offer the product currently, they are getting away with it. As soon as classic launches that loophole goes away and the hosting company turns them off as soon as the first letter hits their desk.
---
They will be back to hosting in russia or some parts of eastern europe with 1k+ ping and 20 people on the servers. Pirate servers will always exist as they always have, it's too hard to shut them all down and the tiny ones don't really matter to blizz anyway. But the days of the big pirate servers will be over.
---
Literally my first time thinking of this. 
---
I am looking forward to professions actually being useful. 
---
Realm transfers are fine with me. Im ok with faction transfers to but thats about the extent of it.
---
I was a refugee from Star Wars Galaxies and I had a friend from that recommend it. I stuck with it because I was a depressed 17 y.o. with no life. I quit right before TBC because it seemed like the responsible decision.
---
The european hosting will be over the minute classic servers go online. They are using a loophole in the law to avoid shutdown, that will go away as soon as blizz offers the product and they will be back to hosting in russia with shitty ping. 
---
Try out path of exile.
---
I came back (left after vanilla) pre BFA earlier this year.  Left 2 months ago because the game just lacks purpose.  Leveling is dumb...there's no point in collecting anything because there's too much and nothing is unique.  There aren't skill trees anymore...raiding feels pointless.  Transmogs...ack the whole thing is just all messed up now.
---
And different client...
---
A ***geared**** level 50 lol
---
Shut up u egg 
---
His stream seems to get posted here fairly often now.
---
I imagine they'll just keep it in retail. What is the point in adding it to classic? The subscription is shared.
---
Godless, marauding, killing machines. 
---
Frys electronics right?
---
Gold farming being 'illegal' makes it a possible scam for the player and therefore cuts down on it. If you give some PayPal $20 and they never give you gold there's not much you can do. 
---
Even if you don't agree with that, you must agree there are some players that WOULD buy blizz-supported gold and WOULDN'T buy farmed gold. That difference in people is enough.
---
Not at all remotely true. BC through legion servers still exist
---
So you can spend $20 to buy 118,000g in BFA to pay for your $15 classic sub?
---
It's a nonissue.
---
Not worth shit sorry m8
---
What is a prot pala anyway? You get concecration from Holy and prot is only really needed for 1v1 reckoning...
---
a) there's no "retail sub'" vs "classic sub" --- you pay $15/mo to play wow. There's only "wow sub"
---
b) there's been 0 indication that you can convert tokens to classic gold. Literally none. It won't happen. I have something like 25 million gold in retail. I will go into classic with 0 gold and know there's zero legit way to convert one to another.
---
So blizzard supplies BC through legion servers? News to me. Complain all you like, but law is law and 5 minutes after classic exists they are supplying the product and all vanilla servers hosted in europe will have their hosting shut off. No hosting company is going to open themselves to paying lawyer fees and judgements when blizz goes scorched earth on these pirates as soon as the law doesn't give them a shield.
---
Edgy AF
---
devs have already stated that the store items will not transfer to classic servers. but you can use your retail account to use tokens for monthly subscriptions in order to play classic.
---
&gt; and only in the starting zones.
---
They never said that. They have never said sharding will only be used at launch and in the starting zones...
---
Used to play a lot of warcraft 3 custom games and had a couple older friends who played EQ while I was young. Stopped playing before TBC because I didn't realize I was on a timezone 6 hours ahead of my own so raiding was never an option. Looking forward to the nostalgiafest
---
Rp players are weird 
---
Isildur's sword lost all its durability, might have been close to even.
---
Why is levelling in a slower and shittier way exciting? 
---
You know, it totally went over my head that all he showed were his Christmas presents of back then. You're right, he was totally lucky. Though a onesie is damn comfortabel for long gaming sessions.
---
No vendors to repair or clear bags. He was not prepared. 
---
The Rank 10 gear will do in a pinch, but the problem with it is that it isn't particularly good for healing or feral. At the start there also won't be PVP gear available. I'd recommend Taladril's guide. There are a few pieces here and there that I don't agree with the ranking but 98% of it is money.
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wGBasFY8fFGpBtiD1TAUBB99wxboCSVh5MW_6b_z0oU/pubhtml#
---
In the beginning, you really just want to be running a healing set and a damage set as you really won't have enough mojo to do both comfortable. Once BG's come out you will get access to a lot of equipment that will further help you create dedicated damage/healing sets.
---
Once AQ comes out, thats when you can really start trying to make a harmonious set that does both feral and resto stuff. However, part of the struggle of being a druid is that there is still a real benefit to running two different sets, even when you can cobble a "hybrid set" together.
---
All that being said, it also depends how you plan on PvPing. I got to rank 10 by pocket healing a few people and it really didn't take much time or effort at all. I also had a feral set for when I was pvping alone. Hope that helps.
---
They're not hosting bc thru legion servers at the moment, but okay 
---
WildStar felt amazing to me, just a very different style. Same for GW2. WildStar's UI and things popping up all over the place is what killed it for me. And poor optimization.
---
/camp gives you an xp buff if you do it in a rested area
---
You talking about male or female Orcs? 5 was my initial hairdo as well back then when I initially wanted to roll an Orc warrior (wanted to be a Grunt), till my brother made fun of my hair style choice and encouraged me to roll shaman, which I complied and then wanted to look like Thrall.
---
&gt;Things like epic mount training become far less prestigious, because you can't tell if someone earned it through hard work and dedication, or if they just happened to have some spare cash.
---
You couldn't tell before either.  There's no way to know if someone paid a Chinese gold farmer or not.
---
&gt;this adds even more incentive for hyper-efficient gold farming into the game, because now it's actually worth IRL money.
---
Tokens combat inflation through competition against botters that create gold, and simply exchanges ownership of gold.  My understanding is you are concerned that people will farm more gold, causing inflation, so they can afford a subscription... to keep farming gold... to keep maintaining their subscription...  See how that kinda falls apart?  Gold buyer are a minority, Token buyers by relation will also be a minority.  Neither one of us actually could predict the outcome, but I don't think a minority of people that buy subscription with gold can compete with the economic damage of uncontested gold farmers.  
---
I would buy a Classic WoW CE, I hope they make one.
---
&gt; During this time we had multiple city raids against each other starting with the alliance's successful kill of the leader of Thunderbluff, followed by repeated horde failures to kill the leadership of SW, IF, and Darn. The horde even organized a 3am raid and managed to kill the wrong boss in Darnassus. On the forums, they tried passing off that the priestess of the moon was the leader of the city instead of the archdruid. Eventually, the alliance successfully killed thrall during prime time claiming total victory over the pathetic horde. We ran 2 raids groups: One 20 man group to attack the gates of Org, but not go inside too far and get owned by Saurfang, but enough to pull the Horde out while the backdoor raid took thrall out. It was a very close fight, but most of the horde were distracted by the raid out front.
---
Let me add a bit of context here. I was at the the SW and IF raids, holy shit were those bad. I was also at the 3am Darnassus raid, I was so laggy I got stuck behind a tree and missed all of the action, but we definitely didn't do very well that night either.
---
I was also at the Thrall prime time raid. It was even worse than you described. We were told in advance that the Alliance was coming, AND we all knew that they were coming in the back door. It didn't fucking matter. Everyone got absolutely obliterated. I was able to see that raid a bit more clearly and it was an absolute massacre. People were definitely salty about it. Good times.
---
&gt; One day a small relatively unknown horde guild posted that they had downed Onyxia(I don't remember who it was, sorry). The alliance was shocked. We'd thought we were the elite faction with all the good players and some random horde guild, not nearly as elite as JoD other guilds beat us to the kill.
---
This must have been Chaos Theory or Dethecus Death Dealers. I was in DDD but I think CT did Onyxia first, then DDD beat CT in MC and BWL and then CT came back to beat DDD in AQ and Naxx. Holy shit what a long time ago.
---
Whats your quicker step by step way?
---
&gt; if you got nothing to do tonight like myself
---
Tonight
---
&gt;If you have nothing to do, you can always jump on a pserver and test best routes for yourself, it'll give you better results than watching this.
---
Tonight vs 116 hours from now, Friday January 4, 2019.
---
Exactly my point? They are going to shut off vanilla servers, all of them being hosted in europe. and it will happen FAST. The loophole they are using is because blizz does not offer the product. As of classic launch they offer it, and those servers lose their protection. Hosting company gets the letter, server goes offline.
---
Unlikely, theyll all just shift to russia or euro countries outside EU
---
Where is the cliffhanger?
---
IDK how other people feel, but I think new content with the feel and mindset of Vanilla would be really awesome if they could pull it off.
---
Right, where they will have 1k+ ping and steal all your info. I'm sure that you and the other 4 people who decide to play there will have tons of fun.
---
Russian servers don't have 1k ping though but okay 😂
---
I have 0 intention of playing on a vanilla p server when classic comes out, but they will definitely exist. You're very hostile pal
---
Noo players give gold to other players for a wow token that grants them $15 blizzard balance or one month game time. People buy tokens from Activision and sell them on the auction house for gold. At no point does anyone give gold to activision for sub time.
---
If I have MC epics, why do I need pvp rewards? If they go by that release schedule, there is no reason to climb the pvp ladder unless you no life it to rank 12+
---
Is growl an issue because of the lack of rage generation from the damage?
---
What do you mean trade gold?
---
OP said they won't raid and will mainly pvp.
---
&gt; This must have been Chaos Theory or Dethecus Death Dealers. I was in DDD but I think CT did Onyxia first, then DDD beat CT in MC and BWL and then CT came back to beat DDD in AQ and Naxx. Holy shit what a long time ago.
---
It wasn't CT.  I remember Bokchoy praising the guild who did it and slamming the alliance for being losers, which motived us to get our shit together and down her.  I don't think it was DDD either.  Whoever they were it was the first time I'd heard of them when they posted about the kill on the forums.  We were all pretty impressed.
---
&gt;I was also at the Thrall prime time raid. It was even worse than you described. We were told in advance that the Alliance was coming, AND we all knew that they were coming in the back door. It didn't fucking matter. Everyone got absolutely obliterated. I was able to see that raid a bit more clearly and it was an absolute massacre. People were definitely salty about it. Good times
---
You guys knew? Wow, I'm surprised it worked.  We lost 10 or so people on that turn left to head to thralls room.  They lagged right off the cliff into the middle of org.  I don't know if they ever made it to the fight.  Admittedly it was about the best organized of the city raids for the alliance.  Very strong leadership provided by several guilds.
---
From reports, there was around 30 horde out front fucking with the distraction raid.  I was in the primary kill raid.
---
We all had blast with the city raiding both defending and attacking.   Good times indeed.
---
Well at least I know you've never bought gold lol. There's websites that act as a 3rd party holder of funds so that its impossible to scam because they investigate and prefer the buyer over the seller for the most part. The paypal example you give you could easily refund and there's not much the farmers can do so kind of the opposite of what you're saying.  
---
For sure there are a small minority of misinformed players that think buying gold makes your account get hacked or will get them banned from wow instantly, but that isn't enough to say we should or shouldn't have wow tokens by any means.
---
&gt; You can pay real money to buy the tokens then sell them on the AH for gold.
---
If both retail and classic have tokens you could assume that you can buy a token using retail gold and then turn around and sell your token into classic gold...
---
Though the same subscription. So they're the same as far as corporate is concerned. If anything they might kill classic before retail if it does equal or worse numbers (which retail will probably do better numbers for the same reason as Skyrim does better than Morrowind, just more mass appeal regardless of overall quality) because it might not be seen as profitable enough. Corporate tends to make some silly short term calls that hurt in the long run like that.
---
you actually have no idea what youre talking about
---
Azshara. Silithus could prob use more quests. 
---
Sharding will remain. As you said it's not UX it's about cost cutting by not investing more resources to make adjustments to the servers for a larger pop.
---
This company will never ever learn and I am 100% sure Blizzard will fuck up classic.
---
so you've got no idea how they would implement a trading system in classic and you're 100% guessing based on the retail systems.  There it is.
---
What they could have done is made Outlands just a leveling zone for 58-70 with maybe one raid and a few dungeons and no major city and then made the max level content back on unused portions of Azeroth. People would have gone there, done the quests, seen the content, and then come back to the old world for most of the max level content.
---
And due to lack of tmog.
---
I doubt it. There are plenty of people who like insta gratification retail. There are tons of people asking for changes to classic to make it more retail like. There will be a ton of people who try classic and bail because they have to work for everything they have.
---
Did you read OP?
---
This was how the box looked in the EU (both outside and in): [https://imgur.com/gallery/HSRSTXq](https://imgur.com/gallery/HSRSTXq). At least it did in the Netherlands for me.
---
Oh, cool. That's an even better system. Can't really form an overall opinion of buying gold from Blizz vs gold farmers, but the system's very well thought out.
---
If it follows the same pattern as prohibition, it means legalizing it amounts to more people taking part in it, but in smaller amounts, and in the end the same amount of the product is sold.
---
and how is that different from people who assume it will work differently from I have *experienced* it working?
---
It's the 8 piece bonus that's amazing. 10% chance when you cast missiles, fireball, or frostbolt to reduce the casting speed of your next spell under 10 seconds to cast instantly.
---
As a fire mage, imagine having a 10% chance every fireball to grant you an instant pyroblast. That's potent.
---
Came here to ask the same thing haha
---
It’s almost like exploring a world you haven’t seen in years might be fun for some people or something 
---
Aaah he was holding a WoW token. As someone who stopped at Cata the joke of the vid totally went over my head. Something I don't mind at all, because WoW tokens sound terrible.
---
STAY CLOSE BUT FAR! In this screenshot aq40 was a 40 man instance... getting that many people to coordinate was tricky .
---
False.  
---
Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica.
---
That too 
---
Sorry played from 2004-2008 
---
 I'm against it largely because what I might be most hyped about classic is that every person starts on an even playing field. No prior market for *anything* how will the market play out? Especially with far better info and experience.
---
But if Preston McToken produces a high value item with no in-game interaction (token), and builds a large financial base, he'll have the capitol to shape markets. Having that principle to invest will mean he has an unfair advantage. 
---
I think your investment is safe regardless: just convert it to a server if things don't work out.
---
IF.
---
Every indication so far leads anyone to believe that you WON'T be able to acquire or exchange a token within the classic environment.
---
I'm with you here, it's just a Blizzard hate train, their wont be any sharding after starting zone which they said was for a limited time too. People are just jumping on the hate train sadly. 
---
Ofc their is a small chance blizzard use it later, but rather unlikely from what they have said to us so far...
---
Yeah but that's not in the context of OP
---
When in doubt, wait. 
---
I was going to do a day1 play like I used to do long ago. Not anymore. Now I'm gona wait and see how it goes, what changed, etc. 
---
"queue and 100 players per mob is better then sharding" so wrong, u need to look at it from a perspective of blizzard for me and u (super hardcore private server players, or people that are super excited for classic wow) sure it is. But for people that wanna try classic after many years, aren't to sure, retail players, they will join kill 10 mobs in 2 hours and be like "fuck this" or see a 1 hour queue and be like "fuck this"
---
People like me will have 5 piece t1 gear bombing the OP with greens is going to make his r10 grind a lot of fun. I am replying to your comment based on that. 
---
Your comment ruins pvp for nearly everyone involved. The epicced out raiders have no incentive in the ladder and the people who need the ladder rewards have to climb against MC geared players. By the time the OP gets pvp blues, raiders will be in BWL epics likely based on your comment.
---
I doubt they would add Wow Tokens to classic. It would have such a ripple effect on the entire game and economy. But never say never I guess with Blizzards track record.
---
I would play an alliance warlock if it wasn’t for gnome being a much better race for warlock than human. I know it’s not huge, but it’s bother me. I’ve just never really been able to get into my character if it’s a gnome.
---
At least on horde you can argue for orc or undead. On alliance you can’t argue anything in the favor of human (other than looking great in gear). I’ve always liked orc, so I’ll probably be going horde again.
---
Following that guide helps you discover a fuckton of quests you'd have never just stumbled upon casually. Unless you love hillsbrad that is.
---
Mages aren't the only popular class. You'll get more raid love than rogues or hunters for sure
---
how do you explore a world you've already seen, which has been documented and mix maxed to the extreme? i love classic, its not the wild west out there.
---
My comment doesn't do anything, it's just a reminder of Blizzard's current plans. If anything it warns of the same things you're saying, in that if someone's planning on gearing up through PvP they're going to be severely behind in the meantime.
---
step 1: mage.
---
step 2: aoe grind.
---
This needs more upvotes.
---
Paid realm transfer is something that I think should be available. I did it back in the day because I didn't realize initially I was on an EU server in a much different time zones. If they want to sell non combat pets, and accessories and shit that has 0 combat value for real money idc. That really should be the line though 
---
You know your price stickers well 
---
Haha good point. My ignorance proved I'm in the small demographic that wouldn't do it.
---
Mages can do plenty of dungeon AOE farming, plus as someone said ZG farming that is supposed to be very profitable. No idea how much hunters can farm up in an hr but I think the mage can push somewhere between 70-90g per hour. Never did this myself, but have watched a couple videos about mage dungeon farming in vanilla recently 
---
The Earth is flat
---
Water is heavier than gold
---
I drank tea with God yesterday
---
Humans can live without food and water
---
See, I can play this game aswell..
---
Elemental is *not* garbage. At least it wasn't during Vanilla for me when I farmed HW with it. It has a lot of burst (e.g. I dueled one of the best arms warriors on Horde side of my server at the time that was in full BWL epics, and I managed to burst him down before he reduced my HP to half). The thing is is that it isn't exactly a solo build. As elemental hasn't got a lot of protection, CC and escape abilities, you rely on blending in with the crowd to shine. 
---
Also you don't open with Chain Lighting like a lot of the old stupid PvP videos showed, but 
---
1. you open with Lightning Bolt (slowest cast) from max range (Storm Reach is a must), 
---
2. then another LB (as you casted the first LB from max range, this one should be almost done casting before the first LB lands)
---
3. Chain Lighting
---
4. Nature's Swiftness + LB (if NS is off cooldown)
---
5. Frost or Nature Shock (depending on the opponent and situation).
---
Also I found that stacking spell crit was very effective in PvP, which goes against one's intuition of giving spell damage priority.
---
I have mad respect for the dude and what he has accomplished, but any new player who is looking to play seriously in classic should already be practicing on private servers rather than living in the past.
---
With all the cost cutting measures lately I fear they will try to implement this as cheaply as they can.  Automated reporting, loot sharing, what else are they going to change to save money?  Are they going to keep item stats and loot tables the same?  Or make it blizz-like?
---
That music.
---
Blizz, if you're listening, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LITERALLY GIVE US VANILLA WOW. That's it. Then you win.
---
Played a little bit around launch in late ‘04 on a friend’s machine.  Played a few levels a night elf but it didn’t interest me much.  zoster by ‘06 literally everyone at work was playing it so i felt the urge to try again.  Rolled an undead warrior in June ‘06 and played hardcore until Ulduar in WOTLK. 
---
Streamers wont be able to play pservers and blizzard will crack down on them super hard too. Much rather work with blizzard on this.
---
Are you Australian or something?
---
&gt; the buff you get when you wipe that increases your stats like damage done, damage reduction, healing increase by 5% per stack
---
What the fucking fuck?  This is a real mechanic?  Had no idea WoW was this terribad now.
---
People keep acting surprised, “wow one day blizzard coould  do no wrong, now everyone is up there ass about everything”
---
Like no, people with brains and foresight saw this coming.  Didn’t take a genius to see Blizzard isn’t run by the same people anymore.  Mark Kern already stated these sentiments many times.
---
As soon as I wrote it must have been CT or DDD, i had a suspicion I was wrong. I was a bit behind the curve so I wasn't at the first Onyxia raids on horde side and I definitely can't recall who was running them so we would need an archeologist to figure it out.
---
As for the Raid, some people knew which is why they were at the back door. The problem was that we kept screaming at people to go to the fucking back door because it was obviously a ruse, but the fighting was so fierce I guess they just didn't believe that an even BIGGER force would hit the backdoor. I think some people might have even furthered the ruse by saying that they were so confident they could kill Thrall that they would come in the front door.
---
Obviously a lot of this stuff is long in the past, but I'm 100% sure the Alliance had killed Thrall prior to that prime time raid and that raid was just the icing on the "fuck you" cake. I think I was in Org when Sylvanys was killed, and no one ever cared about Cairne because he could be kited down the mountain and away from guards and was basically a jobber past that. Whenever it said "THUNDER BLUFF IS UNDER ATTACK" no one gave a shit haha.
---
The server also had great world PVP with the Azuregos. I don't know how but somehow whenever Azuregos was getting raided everyone on either faction always knew. The pulls would end up becoming blood baths because someone would kill the tank and Azuregos would just walk around wrecking people, or people would intentionally try to evade bug him. I think my biggest regret from WoW was not having the money to afford a computer good enough to participate more fully in all of those world events. Won't be a problem this time around though!
---
There's so much misinformation out there I'm surprised blizz isn't more active in these threads to give out the right information.
---
That being said.... This gif had my laughing.
---
&gt; I was also at the 3am Darnassus raid, I was so laggy I got stuck behind a tree and missed all of the action
---
Gave me a good chuckle.
---
You do understand that aoe grinding won’t be anywhere near as effective on an official server with static rather than dynamic spawns, right?
---
I got interested sometime around the Summer of '08 by watching YouTube videos by Oxhorn, WoWhobbs and various raid videos. Most of the raid videos I remembered had countless blue and black balls flying toward the boss, and I decided that I wanted to do that. I stuck around for nearly a decade because of friends I made back in Wrath and Cataclysm and because I was simply addicted until the beginning of MoP. Afterward I only stuck around for my friends. I'm returning because I've played a few classic servers, and I absolutely loved it.
---
Why are we still up voting these.. I have 3 vanilla boxes 😒
---
As someone who loved WC3 abd WC3: TFT to pieces there was no way I wasn't going to try it out! I remember spending ages on the forums working out which class I was going to be before I ever got the game itself!
---
The irony of this thread holy shit.
---
Long story short: taking The One Ring by force is a pretty bad idea and would have almost certainly instantly corrupted Elrond.
---
[This answers it pretty well.](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/38417/why-didnt-elrond-or-c%C3%ADrdan-take-the-ring-from-isildur-by-force-and-destroy-it)
---
How do you achieve this low-effort looking style (no offense meant, I love the aesthetic) of putting images over someone's face in a video? I would sincerely like to know. A video tutorial would be ideal. Thank you.
---
Well this makes sense if Classic sub is tied to retail sub.
---
But if I see an in-game WoW token in Classic I will be a sad panda.
---
A million people wanted all the features that are in current retail wow and now it's a shit game.
---
[Bruising Intensifies]
---
They're like the most conspicuous elites in the game. It's not like they sneak up on you...
---
&gt; Obviously a lot of this stuff is long in the past, but I'm 100% sure the Alliance had killed Thrall prior to that prime time raid and that raid was just the icing on the "fuck you" cake. 
---
We hadn't as best as I can recall.  If it happened it was probably the middle of the night.  I'd been on 3 or 4 failed Thrall raids before that one. The fucking troll leader would AOE frog the hell out us and the horde would group up, rush in and go right for our healers. It was also the cohesion and spontaneous coordination of the Horde in PvP that gave us trouble.  Thrall also did an amazing amount of damage.  You guys had good fucking defenses and having 2 city leaders in a single room made it a much, much harder fight.
---
&gt;The server also had great world PVP with the Azuregos. I don't know how but somehow whenever Azuregos was getting raided everyone on either faction always knew. The pulls would end up becoming blood baths because someone would kill the tank and Azuregos would just walk around wrecking people, or people would intentionally try to evade bug him. I think my biggest regret from WoW was not having the money to afford a computer good enough to participate more fully in all of those world events. Won't be a problem this time around though!
---
I think we all just wanted some content and PvPing over a world dragon was actually more fun than actually killing the world dragon.   It certainly was a World PvP crazy server.
---
Then classic isn't for you.
---
That's fine imo.
---
&gt; but any new player who is looking to play seriously in classic should already be practicing on private servers rather than living in the past.
---
It's a good metric though.
---
I have a paladin route I'm working on. Pserver has me at ~128 hours. I catch up at about level 24, get passed up at 33 (going by his published pace) so I know where I need to make improvements.
---
You don't need dynamic at all, and it'll be esp stupidly easy if blizzard leaves DM in on release.
---
I can't be bothered to read the comments in this thread, because the only thing I have to say about tokens is this:  
---
Introducing tokens to Classic WoW will solidify the popularity of private servers and ensure they are never out of style. Private servers would remain the ONLY option for a huge population of players if Classic had pay-to-win mechanics such as tokens.  
---
I don't currently play private servers, but if tokens were confirmed? ***F R E S H***
---
He obviously didn't read the OP, he's not gonna read your post.
---
I hit rank 10 without too much trouble before quitting and was exalted in WSG and AV (although apparently only revered in AB, who knew). I admit that it has basically been 12 years since I played, but I was pretty good back in my day and I doubt there's anything wrong with what I wrote.
---
Sounds pretty Fel Reaver like then doesn’t it?
---
You believe that 15% MS is inconsequential to druid FC. That's wrong.
---
I didn’t make a post?
---
A post to discuss the changes is one thing, multiple posts stating all is lost and WoW classic is dead before it started, is another. 
---
Also, stating that possible loot trading and sharding for the starting zones are massive sweeping changes might be a bit of a stretch? 
---
Oh well, we can agree to disagree.
---
As I said I definitely could be wrong but I could have sworn Thrall had been killed once before then. If not it would make sense it is definitely not an easy row to hoe trying to kill two raid bosses at the same time.
---
One of my favorite things about world PvP on Dethecus is that high ranking players would generally leave each other alone. I still remember watching a dwarf hunter massacre some people in Silithus and I just hung around and watched and waived and he came over to chuckle and dance with me after. I would get attacked sometimes by a group of players and a few would just leave me alone and one time the guys even disengaged, pretty funny in hindsight as.
---
And I once again could be wrong but I think it was on the forums some people talking like "we can come in the front if we want to" or on vent or something. It's such a pity that there are some moments I remember as clearly as if they were yesterday, and others that are so hazy I should probably just abandon them altogether.
---
Lmao I came down to see if anyone was as surprised as me. It's amazing how fucking bad retail is, and a huge surprise if you haven't played for ~8 years. God what a true disaster of a game.  
---
It could be coloured by my experience. I was generally in pre-mades so once I was out the door, I was usually safe. There is really only one time in WSG in which the bonus would be beneficial and that's when crossing the field. Considering you're already in cheetah form, i'm sure it would help but I doubt anyone won any games due to the speed boost. AV and AB are pretty mount heavy, so i'm still not convinced that is wrong either.
---
We may just have to agree to disagree. Come classic I will definitely give it a more concerted shot though and see if my opinion is the same.
---
Moon Bears?
---
I hope that middle ground exists.
---
How exactly do you see that trade going down?  The only thing you can do with WoW tokens is sell them on the AH or use them for Bnet balance, how exactly do you think someone is going to buy (or sell) an item on Classic for WoW tokens?
---
It's not like you can trade them directly on retail to another player.
---
and see the true limits of cheese by watching grounding totem do silly things. 
---
Every now and then they'll land an insane chain lightning that pretty much decides the teamfight right then and there. The rest of their toolkit has plenty of options, but imho they're nothing more than good, certainly not a class I've ever really seen stomping face.
---
Sharding is not a solution, it's a hacky workaround detrimental to the experience most classic players want classic for.
---
I mean, it'll probably be a massive success in terms of people who played WoW back in the day and are the voices who've been calling for Classic for years now.  I've seen a lot of people who haven't played WoW in years talking about how hyped they are to play Classic, but I dont't see it penetrating the current gaming market much.  It's not gonna revive the MMORPG genre by any means.  If you didn't play Vanilla back in the day and didn't start playing WoW til post Cata, you probably aren't going to stick around on Classic now.
---
That's fair, but hunters are expected to level faster than other classes. That being said, it's impressive to continually improve your times.
---
As an aside, I'm so tired of all these people talking about classic as a theoretical thing when thousands of truly hardcore players have already been playing "classic" on private servers for years. People who practice on private servers will be miles ahead of everyone else when classic begins.
---
They already messed up by planning on implementing loot trading. 
---
Was a huge WarCraft 3 fan, played it for 6 years straight competitively online in tournaments and ladder, and to imagine I can play as one of the characters from the game and meet all the main characters from the campaign "personally" was huge for me. Also we had a 10 man group of close friends who played the game, so that was a huge bonus as well
---
I personally believe that the MMO genre is dead, and that we are extremely lucky Blizzard is even entertaining this idea, considering all the signs say big bucks are elsewhere.  
---
We've now re-entered the era of the arcade game with the onset of things like Call of Duty and Fortnite, which are both very arcade-y by nature. No growth, no development, no attachment to your in-game persona.  
---
I hope they keep the lights on at Classic WoW for a long time.  
---
&gt;  I still remember watching a dwarf hunter massacre some people in Silithus and I just hung around and watched and waived and he came over to chuckle and dance with me after.
---
That sounds a bit like outbakjack. I first ran into that fucker when he was like level 25-30 killing horde in Stonetalon.  He was fucking with 50+ warrior who'd come to kill him for camping his alt and outbakjack just keep going after him.  I helped him kill the guy and chatted with him for a bit.  He took forever to hit 60 because he spent all his time fucking with people and screwing around.  Fun guy both in the game and on the forums.
---
People who roll undead don't do so for pve, they do it for PvP, so it kinda does.
---
You don't take the One Ring.  It takes you.
---
As long as the in-game economy is completely isolated, I don't care how people pay for their game time. This seems ok to me.
---
The community is so clear about what crosses the line. If they fuck it up, this will be the biggest gaming gaffe of all time. Blizz, just give us what we want and you’ll make a lot of money for many years, do it right! We set up the ball onto the tee. Just swing hard and you’ll hit a guaranteed grand slam. It’s actually simple. Just do it right!
---
I want it to be a success so we get a hardcore WoW 2. That would be the best case scenario imo.
---
WHY DONT YOU PUT THEM IN ORDER
---
Loved Warcraft 3 and the lore.  When I heard they were building an RPG where you were IN WC3 and it was a HUGE world, I was stoked to the max.  I couldn't wait to customize my character, explore, fight other other players, and find cool loot.  I can almost remember the feeling of playing my first character.  I felt so much excitement that I felt almost weightless.  I'd get a new green item and be elated.  Fly over an area with ?? monsters and feel intimidated.   See people with better weapons and armor and wanted to be better than them.
---
The sense of exploration and mystery might not be the same, but I kept playing for the world pvp and getting cool loot.
---
Hunter is by far the best class with rank 10 gear.
---
I would put mage second.
---
Druids can join one pug per month and get full t1 in like 2 runs.
---
Exactly like they do in retail now. I want a wow token for x. Ok heres xxxx gold. Basically you give them the gold to buy a token. If you don’t have that gold, well then you buy a token, sell it and give them that gold.
---
Druid rank 10 gear is completely useless.
---
You can Get better helm from scholo
---
Better shoulders from dm north
---
Just get rank 8 and make sure you bind macros/addons to unequip that shit gear when you dont need the 4 set bonus movement speed
---
They will keep classic up as long as WoW is up. Unless you want to be like everyone else and just ignore what blizzard says.
---
How are you gonna get your token to the classic server to list it?
---
The servers will be separate. The only thing you could do if tokens make their way into classic is pay $20 for a token and sell it on classic.
---
You won’t be able to mail anything at all between characters on classic and retail. Nothing blizzard has said should give anyone any reason to think otherwise.
---
I saw the other day a post of Spinebreaker-US server and they had an alliance guild called 'Requiem' killing Ghuul for the first time on the entire realm , and I found it funny because Spinebreaker-EU best  guild  was called 'Dark Requiem' and they where from the horde.  I entered the post thinking 'look at my boys bragging on reddit' and when I saw all the gnomes and Night Elfs, I was like WTF! That was a cool coincidence, looks like they agreed on the names and factions.
---
Wow token's wouldn't *destroy the economy*. First off, wow tokens do not inject gold into the economy. If day 1 there is one wow token on the AH, versus 100 million, it doesn't change anything. The value of wow tokens changes based off the number of tokens available.
---
Now if someone wants to make the argument *'wow tokens encourage people to pay real money for gold'* that's a completely valid argument.
---
Personally I think people are going to be paying for gold one way or the other.
---
&gt; Unless you want to be like everyone else and just ignore what ~~blizzard~~ activision says.  
---
How could I ever ignore the words of a company as honest as ~~blizzard~~ activision?!
---
Druid with 4 pieces of their PvP set also attain 55% base move speed in travel form, but without the 1-3s cast
---
So druids and shamans with specific gear and move speed enchant moving them at 63% move speed (under the assumption MV speed stacks with travel forms) would be the fastest.
---
What exactly would be in WoW 2?  
---
World PvP
---
Farming AV for just kills
---
Big ass WF and CL crits.
---
Those 3, really.  
---
Played from about 1.2 until the end of TBC. That might make it seem like I liked TBC, but in reality, my disappointment with the game's direction with TBC was what put me off of buying any more expansions. The way the lore was abused and the impermanency of my vanilla achievements were the biggest motivating factors, to put it concisely.
---
Mages will be everywhere, as will rogues and warriors. That's just the way it will be. Not a good reason to avoid the class you're set on playing though!
---
I wish that would be their stance. That’s the stance they should’ve taken.
---
You should look into Pantheon: Rise Of The Fallen. It's being made by one of the original creators behind classic EverQuest (before SOE destroyed that game after the first couple of expansions) and their goal is to bring back that more social and hardcore dungeon crawling style gameplay which EQ was known for.
---
It's currently entering pre-alpha 4 and they just hired a new lead animator, concept artist and a character artist and they're in the process of doing a massive overhaul to the graphics and animations and putting a lot more of the game systems online for players to test.
---
I think a beta this year is pretty likely to happen, personally I'm more excited for this game (since it's a brand new IP with a fresh world) than classic WoW although I'll be playing classic in the meantime just as a filler game even though I've played through it a couple of times on private servers.
---
Horde has better Racials for PvP but they aren’t that game breaking. In my experience the ones I hated most, were good Tauren stomps and orc stun resist. Almost every undead burns wotf immediately.
---
Bullshit. Stop trying to explain your way out of the cringey lie you like telling randoms online. 
---
Buy a token  to buy a token?
---
What does a wow token have to do with someone buying an item with gold??? It will exist with or without wow tokens except wow tokens just enable people with lives who cant farm gold an easy option to get said gold exactly like it is in retail now...
---
New stuff yo. Like Vanilla but better. Dude idk. Adham is back at Blizz.You never know.
---
Hahaha I'm glad someone said it
---
Yup, I mentioned it on one and got complained at. Who knew it's not spam if someone still hasn't seen it even if it's been posted multiple times in the last few days! 
---
He's been looping the same thing on his stream for quite a while, I'm just sick of people posting this here everyday.
---
1. Give gold on retail to buy a token
---
2. Recieve item/carry
---
It’s also directly opposed in mindset and style of Vanilla and therefore Classic.
---
The tokens should work in retail like they do and should therefor pay for a classic sub. You shouldn’t be able to by a token in classic and sell it on the classic ah for gold.
---
I know it is against the mindset of vanilla but cute noobs think it is end of the world if someone wants to buy an item with gold. If people want to trade wow tokens for items on classic then they are an idiot. 
---
Liquid gold is worth way more on classic than some measly 30 day wow token.
---
They really think 3k capped servers will stay with this number forever.
---
If you wanna get 3~5k, you should open a bigger server (10k cap for example), after a few months, the server will lost 50% of it's population, hitting the pop you wanted in the first place (4~5k).
---
3k capped servers will most likely be a ghost town after the tourists go away, staying with 1~1.5k, slowly dying, no influx of new players because people are not dumb to roll on a dead server, then we also have big guilds transferring to another servers, which will kill servers even faster.
---
Do you expect Blizz to protect you from getting ripped off in that odious transaction?
---
I don't know about that in dungeons, but I know it happens on LFR bosses.  Gotta let the braindeads brute force their way through bosses with already easy or basically no mechanics because LFR.
---
what you rather isn't gonna stop a crack fiend from funding his habit. ill take game time tokens over bs mounts and item skins.
---
People didn’t expect blizzard to protect them from gold farmers either 
---
I agree with this.  It's not the content that ruined things, a lot of it comes down to systems changes. 
---
&gt; This -requires- that there was substance that was ignored. But there was no substance, so they're not avoiding genuine discussion of it.
---
You're just avoiding the original argument and your stance in it by insisting that there was no substance to it, which of course is subjective, because we all know that the substance of the argument was sharding and whether or not blizzard will abuse it. That's the only reason anyone is here and commenting... because of the substance of the argument. 
---
You are insisting proof of a negative (there was no argument)... which (since you seem so attached to having proof) is an impossibility.
---
&gt;It's not a strawman to require someone to have either special insight into a claim they're making that's verifiable, or that they provide evidence to support that claim.
---
You must have misunderstood this part. I was talking about you and your current tactics, because you were diverting the original argument.
---
Let me even read the word TOKEN a single time from a blizzard statement and I'm all the way out. I will not waste my time investment in something that will be even POSSIBLY be shilled out at some point in the future anymore. I've been so over this shit in the last few years.
---
Considering that the fastest speed run to 60 was approximately 6 days played, I doubt I will personally hit 60 for quite some time — assuming I could do that pace, which I won’t because I’ll want to do dungeons and stop and smell the roses, it would still take me over a month with my availability to play. 
---
By the time I’m 60, I don’t really know what content will be out or if PvP gear will be out. It’s just going to be my preferred method of gearing which is why I’m looking towards that path eventually. In an ideal world Id be playing BC so PvP was separate from PvE, but if I can’t get BC I’ll settle for Vanilla ;).
---
"leaves dm on release" ok, what about the other 55 levels?
---
Totally forgot about ZG. You’re absolutely right. 
---
I mean people are worrying about things to worry about things at this point.
---
Truth is people will try and do retail gold to classic gold transfers, or even a wow token via retail side for gold on classic. Those have nothing to do with WoW tokens being available on WoW classic though.
---
I will be an unsubbed party.
---
I started playing WoW because some of my friends in high school kept talking about it. "This new game is coming out, you're gonna get it right?". I didn't really know anything about WoW, I just knew that for some reason a lot of people seemed to be excited for it.
---
Anyway I got the game maybe a week after it hit the stores. I had never played a 3D MMORPG before (I played games like Runescape which had a top down view) so when I first logged in I remember how insane I felt that a game could look that good and it was all online and not a single player game.
---
I played up until the end of the WotLK expansion and then quit for good. I was already planning to quit at the end of TBC but figured I'll give the next expansion 1 more chance.
---
Wasn't my favorite expansion honestly. Recently I played through Wrath on a private server and did all of the raid content and I'm pretty sure I'm never playing that expansion again even if the official classic servers eventually lead up to it, I think it's really overrated.
---
[deleted]
---
Activision hasn’t neutered a franchise in that way in a long time. Ending support is not that same as no longer carrying. Don’t trust em all you want but you can bet they will keep classic up as long as the WoW franchise is profitable.
---
I don't see it as an issue. Part of the reason people keep asking for remasters is that they don't like the direction a game series took.
---
Same could be said for classic. Personally I'm hyped for classic as it was, but after Naxx is on farm, I really hope they add brand new content in the spirit of classic wow.
---
How do they fare in the blue PvP gear? The set bonuses look pretty decent and the itemization seems okay? I know it won’t be as good as raiding, but all things considered?
---
However if they are added into classic. Like you can pay $20 for xxxx gold in classic it’s an issue.
---
Give gold on Classic, receive gold on retail, then buy a WoW token on retail, and play more on Classic? Not the safest sale, but it'll exist!
---
&gt;it was hot in Darkshore
---
Idk about you but northern locale and cloud cover sound chilly to me!
---
By that logic +10 resist is roughly equivalent to +100 hp against a relevant mob. Interesting.
---
Druid for leveling much faster, pvp and 5man tanking as options. Pally for topping healing meters in raids and being unkillable. Not that a holy pally can't work wonders in pvp!
---
&gt; can have more people on a realm you are going to have to come up with an actual source, as I see no reason they would ever expand the cap past the original 2500
---
Tourists.
---
They expect a lot of people that will try the game and quit after a week or two.
---
If they started with normal caps servers would die very early, so their intention is raise the cap, use sharding to compensate, then after the tourists leave, *bring back down the cap* to what the game is designed for (or close) and end up with possibly all servers being healthy.
---
That's why they said they want to use it at launch. After the tourists leave you don't need sharding anymore anywhere.
---
So what stops any other person from buying a token and getting roughly the same financial investment?
---
Tokens don’t create gold and put it in the economy. Tokens transfer gold in the economy.
---
If tokens were in at launch of server the token wouldn’t ah for much cause no one has much. You would make a poor decision paying $20 for a token in the first few weeks of server life.
---
Tackle him so he drops it. Then play hockey with your sword and shoot it down without touching it. 
---
Hi, /u/imok_nt
---
Op is a pserver screenshot, people still use the old /gquit delete system32 and alt+f4 gags.
---
I still believe the massive world/community feel that classic will bring is a major appeal. 
---
so priests can't run?
---
Right, so people can buy gold from gold farmers anyway so tokens don’t change anything?
---
It has to be the stupidest argument ever, there is 0 logic in legalizing something just because a small percentage of people do it anyway.  
---
Do you want to combat illegal gun murders by legalizing murder? Sure your **illegal** gun murders will drop to 0 and you can say that you solved the problem, but everyone with more than a few brain cells can realize that’s far from true. 
---
Creating a legal (in this case, not against the ToU)  way to buy gold will only serve to rapidly increase  the amount of people who buy gold. Legitimizing a p2w structure won’t make the game any better. 
---
The token is not there to make it safe to buy gold, it's there to make Blizzard earn 5$ more for each sub paid with gold (even more in case of people buying more months at a time since you get discounts with real money, no discounts with the token).
---
1. class design: you played a class, not just a spec
---
2. community: actually seeing people playing
---
3. traveling: the world felt way bigger on foot and without all those portals
---
Sorry but if it took you that long to get out of starter zones ur not a pserver vet, just a casual.
---
Getting ahead the pack is really easy if you experienced a lot of fresh launches. 
---
Blizzard grew and grew in subs without sharding. I was happy to sit there with large ques to log in and lag because of lots of players. IT WAS AMAZING being around that many players. Without sharding you will never know the true immersive player experience!
---
"Boromir *tried* to take it, and it had him even without him having to touch it."
---
Then mage is perfect, it's not hugely gear reliant unless you go elemental spec and performs well in pre-raid dungeon bis and pvp gear.
---
Something like that. I think they should have made Outland a level 60 elite zone where you have to go with a group because it's too dangerous alone. Maybe have Black Temple as a raid post naxx raid but without Illidan pls. But don't create a new world that makes the old world obsolete. If they would have created other content on Azeroth alongside Outland, then people would have ample reason to go back to the old world.
---
I started playing Warcraft 1/2/ since I was 7, then 3. It was the natural progression.
---
True. But it didn't seem like that would be the case here. Elrond didn't seem seduced by it like boromir was.
---
Man I never saw a horde box in US lol
---
That’s beautiful bro ... captured the real impact that a game can have on your life. Hope we all get this experience again, minus havin to wait for it to be in stock haha 
---
I heard Quebec has the worst free speech laws, ur forced to speak French right?
---
Riddle me this; what is the difference between WoW tokens and the Chinese gold sellers that were very prevalent during vanilla?
---
I genuinely love how the 7 day trials turn into years it maddening to think but it happens so much haha !!
---
&gt; Blizzard shut down Nost
---
Actually Nost shut down voluntarily to make people talk about it.
---
If they didn't do that we probably wouldn't have Classic now.
---
Dude if you can’t relate to this post then you’ve missed out on such a good feeling. 
---
I remember having the same thing rolling a warlock and trying to get really high armour... until I got my first green and it have strength on it. 
---
That I was like I need as much strength as possible.... finally learning at 18 that I needed intellect as some high level mad fun of me for of the boar cloth armour haha 
---
Goon Squad o7
---
You got heirloom gear don't you?
---
/s
---
Totally agree! Who wouldn't do it? I mean it's barely 2000 hours of running back and forth in WSG and Arathi Basin!  Come on people, it's 2018 get your gaming skills together, stop being n00bz! l0l!
---
No matter what you post, good or bad there willl be multiple people who get upset on this reddit .... beware of manatide 
---
When possible, orc for pvp is better.
---
Can you check for the commander guy rare spawn with /target from the entrance?
---
Fact.
---
No, this is not a thing in dungeons. It is a thing in LFR, the tourist mode for raids though.
---
yeah and dont even get me started on the avaliability of affordable internet. you used to pay PER HOUR what you now pay for a full month of broadband
---
&gt; The pirate servers hosted in europe are using a loophole in european law relating to emulation of games that are not available currently
---
Actually the [exception to copyright](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/11/expanded-dmca-exemption-video-game-preservation-grants-small-victory-amidst) to allow emulation of dead games is US law and it works only on standalone games (it seems the same for online has been rejected).
---
I'm not a layer but we in EU have strong laws protecting customers and their purchases, so I believe that's the "loophole", I bought the game so I have the right to play it, even if it's not available anymore, as much as it's legal here to make backup copies of media you buy even if producers say you can't.
---
was not going to sell anyway , but just wondered :D
---
So play human? 
---
Ok, you can relax because you believe so. They can’t because they believe otherwise. 
---
I know this is for fun, but it's scary how accurate it MIGHT be.
---
The buff thats stacks after wiping is not even a thing in dungeons, ppl should verify stuff before commenting.... Kind of sad that basicly someone can post something that isn't even true and ppl jump on it assuming its true actually without any verification. 
---
I don’t argue it should be there, I said it would have been useful. They solved the exact same thing with GM tickets. I am very much against loot trading in any other case than this - especially dungeon pugs
---
Is STVietnam a meme from overpopulated pservers? I can't remember it ever being called like this in Vanilla, atleast on EU.
---
You don't need the T3 taunt bonus if you have 8 tanks, and druid can tank it fine.
---
I've looked into it! It seems like a fun game, but it's been in production for so long without any news so I've forgotten about it more than once. Maybe it's time to start keeping track of it!
---
The only way to order i see is amazon US though and I think that is a separate account from the one in EU
---
If your server has even 2000 people on it, stv will be a hotspot for pvp. Both factions have tons of quests there, and later on it's where raids gather for the zg heart buff!
---
I played on Stormrage! Were you EU or US? 
---
This is really grasping for straws
---
Ragefire Chasm isn't a good metric, in my opinion.  It'd be more meaningful to think about the dungeons at max level: Scholomance, Live/Undead Stratholme (technically both were in the same instance until Cataclysm, but each side could be as long as any other dungeon), Dire Maul North and West, those kinds of dungeons.
---
Back then, it wasn't uncommon for one full dungeon run to take almost an hour, no exaggeration.  Hell, it was an in-game "challenge" to complete Undead Stratholme in under 45 mins for a certain, somewhat obscure quest.
---
But now that the average skill level of MMO players seems to be much higher now compared to back then and because we have so many experienced players nowadays, I think everyone will find that the dungeons really **are not** nearly as hard as they felt back then.  People were just really bad back then.
---
So I estimate an average dungeon run will be about 35 mins for a PuG and 20-25 mins for an organized party.  Of course, like always in WoW no matter the era, the party's average gear makes a big difference.
---
&gt; And yes, obviously, there will be people that will enjoy Classic regardless, but a handful of us never signed up to half of the changes they've already said they'll introduce, so private servers will boom.
---
Since you're already proclaim Classic doomed have fun at pirate servers I guess. 
---
But keep in mind:
---
They're going to be a direct competition and threat to Blizzard's profit so you can be sure Blizzard will try their hardest to take them down and not just let them exist in peace.
---
Protect you from what? Losing small amounts of gold?
---
I hope this as well.
---
Not the most active roleplayer but I love when everything is at least trying to be in character.
---
Rp-pvp would be my homeserver without doubt.
---
Only just not sure of which faction to choose this time.
---
Horde most likely but I just love the nightelf starting area and music. 
---
&gt; Regarding loot trading, again, this is not what folks asking for vanilla desired. We would rather have it stated that GMs do not handle loot accidents and that any tickets received regarding misloots will be closed with an auto response advising to be more careful with rolling on and or assigning loot.
---
So you DO want changes. Because that's a change. 
---
US
---
I don't see why they wouldn't have RP servers.
---
I love how everyone here works for Blizzard and knows everything that's going on inside the company. 
---
It just makes things that much more frustrating because the tank has to go back to hit whatever the pet is now tanking.  Most wipes happen due to stress more than anything else, honestly.
---
It appears you are correct, I'll take this down, dont want to mislead people.
---
Best post ever regarding the whole loot trading issue.
---
Well...way to kill my 13.6 seconds of excitement. :(
---
That seems about right to me given that people in 2019 WoW Classic are likely to be overall much, much better players than what was prevalent in 2006.  Just one thing about Maraudon: I never heard of people clearing more than one wing there.  Each area was clearly designed to be worth one dungeon by themselves, but it's true you can easily cross over to another area because it's all one instance just like Live &amp; Undead Stratholme.
---
Mage is pretty good without gear because frost gives shields and tons of cc. Other casters will shot on you but melees hate you for the most part. Only downside is the severe lack of hp.
---
Hunter is also a decent choice as they are chill to level and offer amazing cc and kite potential. Blue Pvp set is also good for them.
---
As far as healers go, priests and paladins are pretty potent but all healers suffer from mana problems early on. In pvp your most used button (as a priest) will probably be disspell and shield.
---
I cant recommend warriors as others have, they are the most gear dependant class in the game and early on its a struggle to find the sweet spot between hp and damage stats. 
---
IIRC BGs won't be out until BWL releases. Maybe 6 months after launch? Maybe more? I dunno.
---
So if you wanna PVP in BGs only, take your sweet time to level. No need to rush :)
---
Respawn would kick in after sth like 2 hours i think
---
Wanted to say the same lol...
---
I think there will definitely be RP and RP-PvP servers. Even if it's just one (but I think there will be more).
---
I'm a part of a guild that is preparing for Classic and we will likely be the largest RP-PvP guild on EU come Classic. So we really need this!
---
(Anyone interested in the guild can PM me for details. [Alliance])
---
At first I thought that gold token is a good thing if it was adjusted for classic, at least remove cross-server market for tokens. After all, chinese farmers will be there and I'll be the first to buy gold from them. But after I learned a little bit more about vanilla, I've found that there are a lot of powerful BoE items, much more than in retail WoW. Not everyone will buy gold from chinese farmers, but buying a token is a different thing, so vanilla just is not compatible with gold tokens.
---
I'm not worried as such, I just found a humorous incongruity in this dude thinking he was a loyal customer as opposed to whatever the opposite of a customer is.
---
It will raise prices on high end consumables and rare stuff. Now if you dont buy token you need to farm way more for consumables and it safe to say you can't afford rare stuff, even with nolife farming.
---
Yeah, from losing whatever you're attempting to barter across 2 separate games.  This isn't even getting into the issue of finding someone who wants your retail gold *and* is on the same server cluster so they can actually trade the gold in the first place.  What do you do when they insist you pay them your retail gold first before they trade/help you on Classic, then bail on you?  What do you when they insist you give them your Classic item/gold before paying you in retail gold so you can buy your monthly token then they rip you off?
---
If someone actually bothered attempting what you're proposing, the exchange rate would be hilariously large.  Nobody on Classic is going to give a single fuck about your gold on retail, and the few that will, are going to want a *massive* amount in exchange for their gold/gear/time on Classic.
---
Think like 1000 to 1 exchange rate.  You want 1k gold for your epic mount?  I want a mil on retail, *at least*.  Realistically though, if I had a spare 1k kicking around on Classic, I definitely am not playing enough retail to want or need a million more gold than I already have on retail.
---
Plus, whats to stop me from saying "Gold up front, then [gold/item/carry]" and just taking your gold and walking away?
---
Its just silly to even worry about, short of Blizzard fucking the dog and directly putting tokens into Classic in exchange for Classic gold, this type of shit isn't even going to be a blip on the radar in the economy.  People might try to liquidate their retail gold for Classic gold because they plan on never playing anything beyond Classic again, but they're going to realize awful quick that *everyone* else is attempting to do the same thing and it just won't work so people will give up and stop and it'll make itself into a non-issue.  Got 50 mil on retail?  I'll give you 250g on Classic, because we're all level 50 and its the most we have right now, simmer down.
---
To be fair, it's possible an organized group of friends could get meaningful EXP from farming dungeons, but most elites didn't give especially high EXP back then, so I'm not totally sure.  It could possibly be a wash compared to just questing.
---
Tokens did not even work in the end. I'm buying gold from my friend and so do many people I know.
---
Probably started being called that in USA as they were in the Vietnam war where as EU wasn't as involved as USA.
---
-
---
But either way, stv has always been a hotspot for pvp because it's an amazing place to level, with mobs ranging from low 30s all the way to high 40s in the south eastern region.
---
Both factions having lots of quests there with good rewards, and most of all it's a zone very easy to travel to, primarily for horde with a zeppelin.
---
Probably because they don't have that information. They took a lot of measures to reduce classic cost of operation. Loot trading, so they don't need game masters. Sharding, so they don't need servers. I don't believe that they will suddenly fight gold sellers, so if gold tokens are an effective measure, it'll be introduced. Probably few months after start, so people are hooked and won't escape.
---
Apparently some people fear to buy gold from gold sellers, but ready to buy gold from Blizzard. The same with gold selling. So the difference is in number of participants. I'm playing on Russian servers and nobody here fears of anything like that, so it won't change a thing. But on EU or US servers players are apparently very law-obedient and even treat that license nobody reads like a law. So it might make a difference there.
---
Logically it would be 'deals 18 damage' yes. If only it would reflect a certain percentage.
---
"You reflect 500 dmg to MUFUKN KING MOSH" upon getting crushed. At least he would feel that. A bit.
---
Not necessarily. With optimistic approach, I think if they add WoW token, the whole economy will see massive inflation, and therefore the professions, BOE's will go on insane prices on the AH, as much more people would have insane amount of vanilla gold. Prices can skyrocket and therefore things with fixed price, such as epic mount would devalue in some way. This would fuck over people who have no money to spend on tokens but they could probably farm things and get more gold for it. 
---
But as many things could go wrong here the safer way is to just disable token trading for Classic.
---
Which server is this? 
---
To fully clarify here about the "wipe buff:"
---
[Determination](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=139068/determination) happens in LFR (Looking for Raid, an auto-group finder for each raid in WoW post-4.0) if the raid wipes to a boss they'd been fighting for a few mins (exact time depends on boss and is invisible).  This is because LFR is designed to be completed with only PuGs with minimal to no difficulty, and without this buff, people would just all leave because they'd soon realize it'd be simply impossible to complete the raid after a few wipes and nothing changing.  After each wipe where enough time had passed, all raid members gain +5% Damage/Healing Received/Health, stacking to +50%, and this is removed once the boss is defeated.
---
What this poster is probably thinking of is [Luck of the Draw](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=72221/luck-of-the-draw).  This buff is only active if you use the Dungeon Finder to enter a dungeon, and it grants +5% Damage/Healing/Health to each party member for each random PuG member the Dungeon Finder matched you with, up to +15%.  That means you can queue with 1 friend and still get the full buff or queue with 2 friends and get +10%, 3 friends and get +5%.
---
I'd never step foot inside STV prior to reaching 36ish. It's a waste of travel time imo.
---
Sounds like you’re into a bit of crack yourself mate 
---
Just about every private server ever.
---
[Here you go buddy!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tco1i_ibOuQ)
---
Shit. They are called "*Curse* Guild". These must be the biggest goddamn bad-asses on the realm.
---
&gt; It won't happen
---
[I won't bet on it...](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-11-22-new-report-reveals-concern-within-blizzard-about-activision-relationship)
---
Infrastructure costs money? What IS this bullshit? It's like air, it's free!!1
---
You always do gold first, and it's as simple as finding a deal you're comfortable risking
---
&gt;If someone actually bothered attempting what you're proposing
---
This is funny to me because this -was- the norm back before the token came out. I've been buying gametime with gold since wrath. 
---
And retail gold isn't worthless anymore since they added the ability to convert it to Battle net balance. This means Overwatch loot crates, Hearthstone packs, Call of Duty 29, Destiny 3, whatever else Activision decides to put on the Battle net launcher. It has value. So if some idiot in Classic finds a Freezing Band and posts in trade he wants a Wow Token for it, he'll more than likely get one.
---
That's true.  Patrols had a much lower respawn time than everything else.  It was 2 hours for normal mobs, and patrol respawn time each had their own independent time as far as I can remember.  I'd say, on average, patrols had a 20 mins respawn time.
---
I get you! It wouldn't surprise me if WoW tokens are implemented though. We'll just have to see
---
Will be interesting to see how he competes vs high population/mob tagging and how his route fairs vs modern strats. Those old runs were on dead servers.
---
idk appearences arent all they seem. Even gandalf didnt trust himself to take the ring and that was with permission from frodo. this very well could have been a moment of "I know if i take it it will consume me as well" kinda deal.
---
This is what most people don't understand. Wow servers only work if they're in a constant state of gaining new players otherwise they just stagnate and die. Capping a server slows that growth and just accelerates its death.
---
*cries in Emerald Dream*
---
Gold sellers are part of the vanilla experience. I'd rather have them than the token for that reason alone.
---
&gt; Think like 1000 to 1 exchange rate.  You want 1k gold for your epic mount?  I want a mil on retail, 
---
&gt; at least
---
idk man, maybe i play with a bunch of rich fucks, but like half my retail guild could feasibly pay that. they make bets on wow tokens worth of gold multiple times every raid night. 
---
STV was where I learned the value of a soulstone and healthstone :)
---
RIP
---
Nice 2016 meme
---
if you buy a token you HAVE to use it. so i dont really think you could od that as easily as you think.
---
Go priest so you don't have any chance of melee. That'll give you the full-on squishy caster experience.
---
Plus, it's best class ;)
---
Since modern hardware and servers CAN keep up with this, I'd argue I absolutely WANT this. 
---
Absolutely, but it won't matter to the overwhelming majority of the casual playerbase, they'll play regardless.
---
Oh it sure is a hotspot seeing thats its basicly the first zone where levelers from both really meet eachother head on, but in Vanilla it was far less of a hotspot as some of the pservers have been. For example i was on a pretty high pop server in Vanilla, and there never was raid v.s. raid pvp at the ZG world buff giver for example. 
---
Priest strong point is strong overall healing, raid heals, and the fact that you can MIND CONTROL ENEMIES OFF OF CLIFFS.  
---
Weak points are mana efficiency imo. Definitely need to know how to downrank and be mindful of how much mana you have. Also, squishy.
---
you also HAVE to use a token if you buy it with gold. just like you HAVE to auction it if you buy one with money
---
Its less about that actually being a large amount of gold, and more about me (and your example is perfect) illustrating how worthless gold is on retail currently.
---
"you'll still see those players"
---
 No you won't...  Like you said. There will be 8 shards of 50 people. So the 350 others you won't see.
---
You're over exaggerating, I've played with 12k+ people during server launch, after 3 hours you're already in your second zone being lvl 6+.
---
So it took 1hour longer with, 1000 ppl at the starting zone.
---
Also Activision didn't say that they will shut it of after starting zones. They said early zones, which could even mean Barrens, westfall, ashenvale, redridge, stonetalon, duskwood...
---
And maybe it feels like a nuisance to you, but for me a packed zone for the tooth like orgrimmar during the weekend at peak hours is awesome.
---
I mean you are correct but anything is tiny compared to sharding...
---
tbh, i would say it would likely be safer for the economy than gold sellers. but thats pure speculation and i could be wrong, just that the average person isnt looking to farm obscene amounts of gold because its literally their job, unlike gold sellers.
---
Listen, I get your concerns but your original comment was you saying you have a preference for one evil over another, should it come to that, and me simply saying that I would, realistically, prefer to have neither of them. Classic WoW is a product of the consumers speaking up and it is reasonable to take the stance that backs this. I don’t want wow tokens and I don’t want an ingame shop of any fucking kind whatsoever, that isn’t negotiable for me and many others. I will happily start on a private server should they introduce either of these. 
---
Hardware servers cost more and take up room, hence why the majority of BFA is done on the cloud, instanced servers that they rent 
---
You are thinking of BoE loot, and no, not in vanilla. That system was added in Cata I belive. Loot Trading was added in Wotlk and is for BoP loot making it tradable for 2h.
---
Well I hope that they are able to emulate the new 1.12.1 quickly cause Kotick and whatever shell Blizzard is cant help themselves. I don't know what kind of cash shop classic will have but they will not allow it to exist without one. Hopefully it is stupid things like wow gametime tokens and change your hairdo but I think theres more money to be made in mounts and pets and I count on seeing all that shit.
---
You're right people are gonna do retail gold to vanilla gold transfers. Do you have any idea how valuable one gold is on vanill compared to retail? I bet 1k gold vanilla  is pretty close to 100k or more on retail. Vanilla gold is going to be a goldmine for Chinese farmers. If blizz doesn't sell wow token goldsellers will sell gold. This is why everyone is so worried, blizz will undoubtedly want a piece of that pie.
---
The issue is the way the economy works. The price of flask/raid consumes is based off of how much money is actively going around in circulation. Thousands of gold sitting in a china mans pockets? Not impacting the economy. He's not trading with that gold anyway it's sitting there collecting dust. China man selling gold for wow time? Now Lil jimmy with his moms credit card can afford to raid. And now the price of those consumables he just bought went up just a little. Do that hundreds of times a day and you WILL see inflation.
---
Saame here friend.
---
We can't mention server names on this subreddit because it is considered "advertising" and breaks rule 4.
---
But if anyone would really like to know, drop me a PM.
---
This was 2 nights ago just before the Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer (Ony/Nef head) buff went out and a whole bunch of guilds left SW to do BWL+MC.
---
How exactly would it cause inflation? Buying wow tokens depends on the amount of gold already in the economy. so if theres only say, 100 gold in the economy, the token cant be listed any higher than that because it couldnt be bought in a timely fashion, even now in retail where many players have millions and millions of gold, the tokens only go for about 100k cause lots of people need to be able to afford them. 
---
So while people might farm gold for the wow tokens, is it really going to inflate the economy more than gold sellers will?
---
That's fine, but what about the issue of Chinese gold farmers grinding gold on classic to sell bc it is more cost efficient than trying to grind gold on retail?
---
It didn't ruin OSRS and I don't think it will ruin classic
---
From someone very uninformed of russian culture, politics and gaming, you make Russian WoW sould like the wild west of WoW and that honestly tickles me.
---
You, sir, have absolutely no idea how servers work :)
---
The cloud is just another word for remote HARDWARE SERVERS. Blizzard is easily able to configure the amount of resources a server gets for classic. Stop being stupid please.
---
Mmos are dead because they all try to be like retail wow, which is a shit game.
---
It’s going to be on Amazon eventually. 
---
&gt; Blizzard is easily able to configure the amount of resources a server gets for classic.
---
which, if we look at BFA, wont be anywhere near enough
---
Always enjoyed priest most out of all the healers I've tried. Think it is because they have offensive and defensive dispell in one. Very useful in PvP.
---
And that's absolutely a FALSE statement.
---
When it comes to BfA Blizzard has no interest in having 90% of server resources UNUSED because there's on city raid happening.
---
When it comes to Classic, Blizzard is FULLY AWARE that city raids are a requirement and that zones overall will be of higher population. Therefore any given classic zone will have much more power than any retail zone ever since the existence of phasing.
---
Guys just use your brains, understand what phasing/zoning/sharding/virtualization actually is and realize that blizzard knows they can't fuck up classic.
---
The stupidity of people ignoring such simple facts is astounding.
---
yeah, there are counter measures to avoid the masses, some are kinda devious...
---
One of them is have a bunch of your lvl 1 friends make their way to an elite mob and be used as sacrifices so you can get to level 5 fast and be ahead of the curve.
---
Because BfA uses small servers for every zone. Classic will require going back to bigger servers for entire continents.
---
Remember to whisper people in bgs to remind them to turn their afk flag off
---
Stop spreading false information. They didn't say "starting zones" they said "EARLY ZONES"
---
Can you give me the quote where they say strating zones only? They said early zones.
---
It’s gonna be so much fun 
---
Russians don't have much respect for laws by itself, only if there's an immediate punishment. Probably comes from totalitarian times, when laws are applied selectively and everyone could be blamed with something. I have an impression that EU players are more law-obedient citizens. I'm playing in a guild and there are often discussions in discord about whether someone wants to sell some gold. Do you have something similar in EU? Of course there are different people and I might just live in my own bubble, so don't take it too seriously :)
---
Lol, I’m fairly sure you are capable of deciphering that complex riddle. 
---
Yeah, you have like 4 level 30-32 quests after which you're doing orange quests. Usually if you're stuck doing quests 4-5 levels higher than you, you probably should be questing somewhere else. Usually
---
Don't listen to people who say "only starting zones and only for the first week"
---
Blizzard hasn't said anything like this yet. They said early days and early zones. Early days is vague and could mean weeks and months as the community manager Lore said. Early zones could be from valley of trails to redridge and stonetalon. Read up on it and check the videos and post done by Blizzard
---
Shaman is all about whether you enjoy totem management, priest is about being a pure healer (and also MC shenanigans).
---
The world is doomed, the end is nigh. 
---
I really want to try to RP as a jawless undead. Communicating via gestures and unintelligible /say typing. 
---
I dont play EU i play US but the closest thing that ive seen happen to that is people doing /roll bets on wow tokens. So something that is in a little bit of a grey area in the ToS i THINK, i might be wrong. But even then, those people are more using that gold to convert into time, not so much converting it into actual money or spending actual money on it. 
---
Shocking suggestion: getting huge amounts of gold shouldn't be as easy as emptying your wallet to Blizzard
---
Probably has more to do with gamers in general have more knowledge these days and are just more efficient than back then.
---
Gaming in general was still a relatively small thing back then compared to now. After all, wow was released about 15 years ago now, and gaming wasn't really more of a thing until the 90s or so. Think some games came to exist before but the more fleshed out ones were later 90s I believe.
---
I’m going to quietly laugh to myself 2 weeks after release when sharding is over and all these edgelords on the internet crying about pointless sit feel like fools.
---
Precisely. Alliance has a handful of 28 quests right at the entrance and you do have a good handful of 30s, but ultimately it's not enough to carry you through the zone. 
---
It's really simple. The whole point of classic is to "go back" to a specific state of the game (1.12). That patch didn't have the modern conveniences features (and casinofication) of retail. If tokens got implemented we'd see a cascading effect that would render it an entirely different experience and defeat the whole purpose of Classic.
---
A rule not being 100% effective does not mean it's useless or should not exist. Blizzard should be against selling gold, period. Of course it will happen regardless of tokens, but that's not the point.
---
Additionally, the generation of gold is a secondary problem. The true issue is that gold gets distributed based on real money spent. That is what is considered unfair.
---
Nice 2013 meme...
---
Paladin bubble and hearth leaving my warrior deep in the brown stuff. It was that moment I knew I needed a rogue main. Still had to push the warrior to 60 first though.
---
The stupidity of people trusting Blizzard to keep their word is even more astounding. 
---
I'm not trusting Blizzards WORD.
---
I'm trusting Blizzards intention of making Classic successful and not totally destroy their economics... subtle difference.
---
Not good enough to warrant using over pieces with FAR better stats like mish, blackwing cabal shoulders, arcane accuracy bracers, ringo boots and mana igniting cord
---
I pray that you're right. However, I understand that beancounters are retarded at management and it's the Finance crew who are in charge at Blizzard now. 
---
It made sense in the old days as internet speeds were still slow and it wasn’t as easy.
---
But 14 years later, with internet speed upgraded, development being easier, modern code and that new MMOs these days which only ask you to pay once (ESO) it’s hard to believe that all of that money is going towards just keeping servers stable.
---
So feel free to make another argument that makes sense... 
---
I really would love a classic wow dedicated roleplay server.
---
I started roleplaying around Cataclysm time end, and as I roleplayed people would talk of the Wotlk days or the Cata days, and chat would always drift towards what would you rp as in vanilla? 
---
So yea defiantly looking forward to the chance to roleplay in vanilla wow, with all the creativity people can muster, of course there will be some toxicity that follows, but I’m confident it will still be great fun.
---
I played so much horde in the old days that to this day I have a habit of running up to the horde flight path in Booty Bay and right clicking him as alliance. 
---
Ew
---
I really liked when they launched new servers in classic.  Was originally in an alliance guild that came from EQ and at some point (just before BWL or maybe shortly after?) we decided to reroll horde on a fresh server (I think due to alliance queue times).  So at BWL launch I gave up my full T1 geared hunter and rerolled UD priest.  I enjoyed horde quite a bit but I think I got burned out and quit for a bit around the time we were doing nefarian (was mostly T2 geared at this point).  Rerolled on another new server to alliance again with idea of being MT, but unfortunately I became MT, raid leader, and guild leader due to a series of unfortunate events which ended up stressing me out a bit and I quit yet again(I think I had stopped taking raid gear for a while and passing it to OTs to the point they were better geared than me and a solid chunk of my gear I crafted/farmed).  So ultimately in vanilla I had 3 raid (or at least semi-raid geared characters I gave up on).  Ended up going back to my priest and rejoining that guild for a bit and working on AQ40.  Can't remember when/why(if I just was frustrated and dipped or guild broke) but transferred servers and joined a naxx guild (which also fell apart within a few weeks).  Went back to my hunter as TBC was about to launch and raided with him all the way till the candyland patch at end of TBC.
---
Honestly leveling on a fresh new server and starting raiding was the most exciting part of vanilla for me.  World PvP while leveling was great and it was fun to be around new groups of people and forming new communities.  That is what I am looking to do again in classic and who knows how long I will stick around this time.  My main struggle is between liking leveling areas as Alliance better and the fact Horde is more likely to have better world PvP and queue times.
---
Uhhh wow token has no affect on that as it doesnt inject gold into the economy. Are people looking at retail which as what 15 years now of accumulated gold and thinking shit is going to be the same??? uhhhhhhh
---
shaman would be my choice here. the ele/resto build is well fun, you get like 11% spell crit just from talents, you get a 1.5sec cast time chain lightning and a panic button with natures swiftness  
---
shocks are super powerful as well, earth shock hits for a lot and it screws casters as it's also an interrupt. frost shock hits for almost as much and with earthbind you can kite endlessly
---
Waiting for that sweet, sweet buff
---
Most gold comes from hacked accounts. Blizzard will probably restore hacked accounts which means gold will inflate rapidly. Blizzard also tend to not remove this gold like private server people do. Then again, maybe the GMs on private servers spawn and sell their own gold, who knows. It's impossible to disprove. 
---
Guild decided to switch from Sullon Zek server in EQ to WoW.  Our PvP rivalry continued across games however(our neutral faction went alliance, evil side went Horde) which made the leveling and raiding process rather fun.  Stayed until end of TBC when the candyland patch happened.  WoW took up a decent chunk of time at that point and I was in college rather than HS when I started.  I also have a habit of burning out whenever things are on farm status ... I can wipe on the same fight for hours a day, several days a week but I cant stand going through the motions with no challenge.
---
It's not that they can't do it. It's just that Activision Blizzard doesn't want to incur the costs.
---
Lot of Lupos pets there I see 
---
Here's sincerely hoping they make an RPPvP server, at least one if not two (for NA).
---
While I am not opposed to the idea, why should they bother? Why not just play on the RP servers in retail? You need to sub to play classic so there is nothing stopping you. I would welcome the better graphics and player models as it improves immersion for me at least. I can see the benefits though (mainly having the same people running around the server and so you can build relationships between characters way easier)
---
Yeah ive Been thinking about The 30/0/21 spec but dont know how well i can Master all The totem management 😂
---
You experienced something in retail and are now saying that's for sure how it will be in classic.  Stop talking out of your ass.
---
Don't use "we". 
---
And the question is always HOW DO YOU MISS A T-REX!!!
---
Nathanos is brutal on vanilla with his blighthounds, I remember alliance trying to kill him and getting crushed, kinda sad what they did with him on retail, they should've kept his undead appearance, it's scary.
---
Are you unironically suggesting that having a stance on something based on how it currently is is talking out of your ass but having a stance that's "this system sucks because it opens the door to all kinds of abuse because despite having no indication for it i know they're going to change it back to how it worked before they fixed that possible way of abusing it"
---
You need to step up your [game](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcRiiSM_aMecKKkqojLxBwCFvAjFZB3uGjk-c8zeZY6SMUZQpRQ9)
---
Would be more difficult for Blizzard to market Nathanos as the cartoony evil guy if he actually looked menacing and intimidating.
---
Great post OP.  This is exactly where I am at.  I will give Blizzard a chance to do this right.  If however they add sharding or loot trading, wow tokens or any other nonsense microtransactions that did not exist in Classic I'm out.
---
The target audience for this product has been **VERY CLEAR** as to what their expectations are.  
---
&gt; Joana is outdated and overrated, his route is kinda trash nowadays, there is plenty of hunters on pservers who are miles ahead of him.
---
Watching him was like ...waaa?      
---
The Lunar festival guys are up. If that was 2006 (I don't doubt it), then WoW was only a year and a few months old as a whole at the time of recording. 
---
He knew the quests down pat. He knew which to take and which to skip. He'd leave that continent, quest there, come back, and take the quests he'd skipped previously.
---
Was talking to my kid. We're both of the opinion that he had insider help, likely a Blizz employee? Nothing wrong with that, but the guy made zero mistakes, hunted for zones, knew exact locations of every mob needed, and their respective zones. He made plans for the hub he was flying to by shuffling through his quest log mid-flight. 
---
None of his movements were haphazard at all.    
---
That's not normal. Not something regular Joe Shmoe is gonna do while wandering from zone to zone. And not easily done without some sort of addon which it didn't look like was running on the frontside of the game. Perhaps he had a spreadsheet on his computer that worked all of it out for him. 
---
Glad to see yet more people with the same understanding as I. There's a hell of a lot of people that are against this post.
---
i wouldnt say worthless... i feed most of my gold to a hearthstone addiction. probably 10 tokens worth every 4 months and this is a little off topic but it still isn't enough to craft the whole set and it pisses me off.
---
It will definetly take more than 30 mins of code. Confirmation windows are only simple when they are not introducing new complications, which is not the case here.
---
The problem is that this introduces needs for syncing with another player and the whole bunch of additional states that a piece of loot can be into.
---
What happend if a player never clicks anything? What happens if he leaves the group or disconnects? What if he is on the loading screen? What if he transitions on the loading screen? When the piece of loot becomes unlocked? What if the player confirms after the piece becomes unlocked again?
---
On live we have sort of the same confirmation with summoning. And it is still rather buggy. And with summoning you can always shut down the summoning process without problems, that is not the case with the loot.
---
A friend at work knew I liked gaming and particularly warcraft 2. He'd been playing since around launch time and was raiding MC and Ony with one of the top Alliance guilds on our server (EU Aggramar). He'd been badgering me for months to play but as I was working 2 jobs and running my own company I just didn't have the time. Finally it was getting towards the end of the year and I was cutting back on the working hours, I couldn't sustain it any more so I agreed to try it out. It had me hooked immediately and I in turn got other friends involved, even loaning one my laptop for a year so he could main heal for us, who cared if it only got 5fps, it worked. 
---
Vanilla was awesome, TBC was also very good but different, flying mounts, while convenient changed the dynamics, but Kara looked and played fantastic. 
---
I dropped off the scene a little towards the end of tbc but was still around. Played in wrath casually, maxing one of each class and gearing through 5 man content but I never really got the raiding bug back. It was too much the focus of the game I felt a and the server identities were gone. I did play each expansion, maxing my warrior rogue and priest at the very least but not BFA.  
---
&gt; Was about to comment that in the video ge only has 164 hp, then I realized it's footage from private server. Why is that even allowed on wowhead..
---
Nothing wrong with private server footage. Complaining about it would be like noting the Ouija board on a youtube video isn't the traditional yellow kind, so you gotta ignore the guy explaining how the whole set-up works.
---
Two warriors grouped up in that vid. That's the way to do it.
---
The lvl 9 is a 44/75 blacksmith, geared up for the fight and has his axe sharpened with a blacksmith-made sharpening stone (which he tried to give to the lvl 12 who joined him, but the guy jumped up and tried to Braveheart-charge Fizzle on his own). That's one of the arguments I made in this thread: blacksmithing is worth it on a Warrior. The class is sooo gear dependent, it's totally worth the extra grind.
---
Will they though? 
---
According to retail players sounds like the situation is pretty dire on live servers.
---
one of the main problems is things like wow tokens inflate the price of everything.
---
e.g. if you have a small percentage of pay to win players buying up all the flasks and good items the price of those things goes up for everyone not paying to win.
---
raid consumables was expensive and something people spent a lot of time farming gold for.  if essentially people are using a visa card on the auction house they can afford to buy whatever they want , whats left for everyone else will be more expensive.
---
its pretty simple though , if you want wow tokens in classic just play retail amd farm gold . they confirmed the sub is shared so you can easily get free game time by playing retail wow. 
---
Does this mean I can buy wow token on retail where I got millions, apply them as bliz balance and use that money to buy token for classic and exchange it for money there?
---
He's a mediocre player, he doesn't kite mobs, backpedal, waste time doing stupid shit like clicking on loot instead of using shift, and plays on a dead server with no mob competition, he will be crushed by pservers speedrunners once classic launches.
---
It definitely is worse on retail but people have to understand one important thing.
---
With retail, Blizzard is all about optimization of resources. Basically they have to find an acceptable middle-ground for zones to run. They have to cover the 95%+ of cases and that's working. City raids are not really  a thing on retail so there's no reason to have instances as powerful as to handle them.
---
The fact that the Warfront Dailies are so laggy is just utterly ridiculous and my assumption here is that Blizzard has no way to configure specific instances with more resources. They likely have one template for all spawning instances.
---
When it comes to classic, the requirements are a whole different beast. Classic - in total - has less zones where players will partake in. Therefore the instances need to be higher in power than any given retail zone would need to be.
---
On top of this comes to absolute requirement for World Bosses and City Raids to be able to happen. We're talking numbers of 500+ people here - REGULARLY. Blizzard knows they have to cover this requirement and I trust them to do so. Not because I trust their word but because I trust their willingness to earn money and not crash classic down to the ground.
---
&gt;Why are people against WoW tokens?    
---
Because Warcraft Server realms are independent terrarium communities. They exist and flourish on their own, without outside interferences (aside from server maintenance and bug fixes lol).    
---
It's what it should have stayed like. No paid name changes. You earned your shitty (or decent) rep. No server hopping, especially from PVE to PVP (looking at you Fires of Heaven. Likely a Blizz dev guild) after all your toons peacefully leveled with zero ganking. And then you run around skunking lowbies on your new realm...? Who knows.
---
Anyhoo, the world(s) doesn't need outside gold screwing the economy. Want gold? Go grind for it. Work the AH. etc.
---
I never said you have to be over levelled, just that you have to be not laughably under levelled (ie even the starting trash is orange, final boss is red, etc.)
---
it depends how they do the servers.
---
if there is seasons like path of exile with fresh servers starting for new players every so often i feel like that will extend the popularity.
---
if they just release the raids over time i dont think many people will be play8ng 1-2 years after nax releases. 
---
any game in general that has no new content coming out will slowly die, the question is what form will that new content take.
---
they could do fresh servers every now and then or tbc - wrath - etc progression 
---
honestly though i doubt retail wow is going anywhere either , as long as there is a few million people wiling to buy aol the expansions and sub why wouod they stop developing retail. 
---
if anything kills retail it would be a new mmo likley developed by blizzard , classic wow on its own just does not have enough content to outlast retail 
---
Are... Are you serious? Mage aoe on early server is arguably fastest levelling even without dynamic. It's entirely possible to go sub 4 days WITHOUT dynamic and without DM. I honestly expect world first 60 to be a mage, and will likely be close to sub 3.5-3.75 /played.
---
The argument OP is made insubstantial. Blizzard has clearly said that the two versions will be kept separate. 
---
If anyone is curious about why he looks like a fresher corpse check out this short story https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/20704258/warcraft-short-story-dark-mirror .

Guess he needed a new body after too many alliance did this quest https://classicdb.ch/?quest=6187

Blood elves/void elves

End of TBC when Candyland patch came out.  We were trying our hardest to kill Kil'Jaeden before that patch came out (M'uru was dead already) but we just couldnt quite make it.  I think I came back after the patch did our faceroll run to see the end and that was it.  I was going to be bored playing until WotLK came out and had the idea that candyland was going to be extended into WotLK(easy epics/raids to make hard content like M'uru irrelevant).  Gave me more free time to play other stuff and I dont regret it.
---
&gt; He's a mediocre player, he doesn't kite mobs, backpedal, waste time doing stupid shit like clicking on loot instead of using shift, and plays on a dead server with no mob competition, he will be crushed by pservers speedrunners once classic launches.
---
Not a 'dead' server. It's fresh.
---
I agree regarding practiced speedrunners. And there are likely newer addons that will lead people who aren't familiar nor optimized to do it as a speedrunner. Carbonite (i think. Might have been a different quest helper) was out during TBC. 
---
I just want to be able to get shit done on whichever class I choose to roll. Likely gonna create 2 toons. One will definitely be a hunter, but I'll use it to run with my kid on their harder-to-level class. Then they'll use a hunter to help mine, which will likely be a warrior or shammy.
---
And yeah. I leveled 2 toons of my own to near level cap (one got all the way, the other 10 levels from cap) by the end of expansions back then. Hunter &amp; druid. Having multiple high-level toons wasn't that common back then... except for people like Joana lol. Not without botting or account sharing.
---
I guess my point is its worthless *in WoW*.  What do you need millions of gold for in BfA?  Nothing, its more relevant to you in an entirely separate game at this point.
---
Small indie company
---
If you're Alliance it can be worthwhile to do the Kurzen quests and some of the Safari quests so you get past the horrible 30-33 grind. Then do the Alterac and Badlands quests up to 36 and return to STV up to 40 or maybe even 42. 
---
He’s not wrong though? From their perspective it’s either cloud servers vs dedicated servers which they probably won’t bother with (at the end of the day both are physically present somewhere except one is in-house). 
---
Also, no need to call someone stupid at January first man, let’s try not to start the year while being a dick to each other.
---
Let's also not delude that this is a Jan. 1st issue ;)
---
The thing is, there's no such thing as inhouse servers for gaming companies. Servers have to be spread around the globe for better localized pings. Thus it's all "the cloud" (also known as the internet).
---
While generally I think you are correct, both of the fastest Vanilla leveling times we are aware of (Joana’s official record, and VarakWoW’s ~3day 14hr run on the most popular pserver) make multiple trips to STV, the latter making 3 trips
---
So I don’t think it’s a waste of time unless your route is bad
---
How many people this server had? Because it seems dead as fuck.
---
Also, if you're going to play with your kid since lvl 1, I would recommend not choosing hunter with a slow class such as warrior, it'll be painful to follow up a hunter with aspect of cheetah. Going double hunter or double slow class is your best bet.
---
I’m not deluding anything, there’s literally no need to call anyone stupid.
---
Some companies do have dedicated servers then they use cloud servers as proxies spread all around similarly to how Firebase works.
---
Yes it's a over populated pservwr meme. I never recall this from vanilla as well. In a over populated pserver I played it tends to have lots of max levels that like to sit and camp quest hubs as well as people tend to be grouped more which means they kill whoever they come by who's not on their side.
---
How many of you stood in lines outside the stores during those 'release parties' that put Black Friday's overnight lines to shame?
---
Fair point!
---
\^
---
1) Go to the server you want to reroll on.
---
2) Spam trade chat: "Trading gold from X server to this server."
---
I believe so. Although his name is escaping me. He drops the phantom armor
---
Thank you for clarifying that point. I knew the buff existed but I wasn't to familiar, I stopped playing wow after cata and only come back beginning of expansions to explore the quests and level a character or two so my knowledge to retail isn't the best. 
---
They will likely have a small number of servers for Classic, so if they do not believe there is much demand for RP servers then they may just stick with PvE/PvP ones.
---
Even if there's no dedicated RP server, I'm sure the community will choose one server to be the RP one. But yes, having an official one, where certain rules are enforced, would be ideal. And I think it's also very much likey that we get at least one per region.
---
STV is where I lost my human warrior lost his butt cherry, metaphorically speaking
---
Let's say after a month those "tourists" stick around. What are they gonna do? Open up new servers months after the fact? Keep everyone on one massive sharded world? Neither option seems right.
---
wow...just wow
---
This is mostly due to overpopulated private pvp servers.  
---
Optimist view: the parent company has understood the backlash from the long-time fans of Blizzard games and has decided to course correct
---
Cynical, pessimistic view: from a PR standpoint, the easiest way to resuscitate an image is to find a good scapegoat
---
Both are probably true, to an extent. I'm a pessimist, so I'm biased towards the second point of view.
---
Sharding really destroys a large portion of the RP community. You just miss out on a ton of events and things from large groups of RPers because you end up sharded out. 
---
And personally, I would like to RP a less crazy world than retail.
---
Just heal with int gear. Stay feral to level. You don’t need anything more than int gear. 
---
There could be a common term for this, but I'm calling it 'preheal'.  You have to learn how much DPS different mobs do to different players and learn to start healing so your healing touch lands as soon as they need it.  This is pretty much how you keep up as a druid.  
---
Keep Rejuvenation on people that need to be healed quickly and use Regrowth sparingly, it is extremely mana inefficient.  Tell the tank to wait so you can get mana.  Don't be afraid to speak up about CC.  Remember you can use Hibernate and roots.
---
You absolutely should be pessimistic. Blizzard was in a downward spiral long before the bean counting clown took control. She was only in charge for a year. This is a cheap attempt at saving face, but unless they make changes to the people in charge of the design philosophy that helped turn WoW into a shitty game it's still going to suck. 
---
Friendly Neighborhood Nathanos on Retail
---
City raids can't happen in retail. Phasing makes city raids impossible. Asmongold tried to raid org, sylvannas kept resetting and people kept phasing in and out of the fight until they gave up.
---
Jiggle tits night elf sylvanas is cool too
---
&gt; private servers will be more popular than ever.
---
And you are so naive to believe Blizzard won't fight against private servers once they re-release classic?
---
A potentially big issue I don’t see discussed much is the number of servers Blizzard intends to launch with.
---
I personally am worried we see something like 4 PvP, 2 PvE, 1RP, 1RPPVP per region
---
You, sir, are a fish.
---
Very interested but I’m playing US :(
---
Quest text. Truly amazing.
---
“Assemble an army and travel to the Eastern Plaguelands. Launch a full assault on Nathanos Blightcaller and any Horde filth that may attempt to protect him.
---
Keep your wits about you, &lt;name&gt;. The Horde will defend the ranger lord with their very lives.
---
 
---
Do you know how many ranger lords exist in this world? How many human ranger lords have ever existed?
---
Nathanos' accomplishments were unprecedented. He was a tactical genius, responsible for Alliance victories spanning a decade of conflict.
---
And now... the champion of the Forsaken.
---
No. This cannot be. Order must be restored.
---
Gather an army, &lt;name&gt;. Return to the Plagues with your army and destroy the Blightcaller.
---
I wish you luck, &lt;name&gt;. Truly, you will need it for this battle.
---
Progress”
---
Let's say you're a normal player who raids and buys all their consumables through farming your own gold ingame. The most you can possibly make is ~50g per hour from the best farming methods. This rate never changes as it's made from vendoring items. If a large % of players on your realm are buying gold regularly this increases the cost of flasks/consumables. Meaning you need to spend more time farming gold to compete with the people who are just paying real life money.
---
Are we still doing this?
---
Healing Touch is usually more heal per mana than regrow this while leveling; try to think of HT as your primary healing spell (try not to overheal), Rejuv when it won’t overheal, and basically don’t cast regrowth (cast it on yourself before shapeshifting to get some “free healing”, but don’t use it otherwise while leveling)
---
They re not going to give us what we want and we're not going to play it because it's not going to be vanilla wow and they're going to say "we told you no one wanted classic", while not fully committing to remake the game in its original state because they don't believe in what they are doing and are trying to appease the fans using as little money and time as possible.
---
I’ve never played an RP server, but I’m strongly considering it for Classic.  As I’ve gotten older the appeal has grown and I think I would really enjoy it.  RP-PVP specifically since I like pvp and the RP potential is more open with some easier access to wpvpx
---
Been playing a bit of retail lately (wouldn’t recommend it), and probably one of my biggest gripes are the new graphics...
---
Way too cartoony, it makes the game feel totally different 
---
Its a fresh server and joana is ahead of everyone, thats why he's alone.
---
More than likely those interested in making money playing Warcraft will gravitate towards classic as the economy is far less inflated and 1 hour spent farming gold in classic will yield far far more value than 1 hour farming gold in retail and you can very easily transfer this gold between the two games. Look at old school runescape and rs3 people were trading billions of gold for small scraps in the old school game.
---
Priest is fun a f in Vanilla (better in TBC, best in WotLK imo).
---
My plan is Mage 1st to farm gold/consumables for a Warrior that will eventually be my main. If this doesn’t happen for whatever reason, I will probably play priest
---
Totem management is as simple as knowing what your totems do and when you’d want to use them
---
I would expect people with large amount of gold to buy token and therefore redistribute their own wealth in a way that wasn't there in Vanilla. Because of this, anyone without time (which was essential at that time to gain gold) can earn huge amount of golds by listing a token that they bought in the Store. And this "easily" earned gold goes easier than gold acquired by "hard work" earned gold, therefore buying stuff at a higher price in AH, because who cares, if I run out of gold I'll list another token. 
---
That's my feeling tho, I might be wrong in the grand scheme. 
---
Wrong... blizzard is betting on a few things... the current, the past, and the future player... the last two are not subbed. Many people never got the chance to play classic...this is their chance...$15 will increase their numbers greatly even for a short time...
---
\&gt;  I'm currently collecting +INT gear to help my mana pool
---
Are we even allowed to help players playing on private servers on this sub at all?
---
I've found that if used responsibly, growl can be great in dungeons.  I'll use manually to pick up an add that runs in if the tank doesn't grab it first, or on bosses sometimes if the tank dips really low.
---
Just build something cheap. Get a used off-lease Optiplex 7010 with a decent processor. Throw a cheaper GPU like a 750ti SC or so in it. Then maybe a cheap 80+ nonmodular power supply. Could easily be done for $200, even less if you're willing to source a used GPU. This will be plenty good enough to play games like WoW, League, CSGO, and more in 1080p.
---
If they start adding content to Classic then it won’t be the museum.  We can’t play vanilla on an official server anymore, if they start adding crap to it, then we will yet again not be playing vanilla.  Now I understand Classic will not be vanilla, it’s a replica, but I want as faithful of a replica as possible.
---
There are a couple quality of life things that my mind wants, but my heart remains #nochanges.
---
Give me my Classic Museum and I will run the halls and revel in its glory.
---
Same boat, can't wait to go in blind
---
Changes that don't affect gameplay are in a total different category than those that do.
---
That's not true, look at starting zones... doesn't seem to be a fresh server at all, it's empty 
---
Let's assume following Scenario:
---
We have two actual Servers (Blackrock and Frostwolf). Those are the two physical Servers that Blizzard intends for a given region. Now the start of classic will be much bigger in numbers due to all those tourists.
---
This means Blizzard is going to spawn more shards where Blizzard intends to get people playing on both server, BlackWolf-1, BlackWolf-2, etc... (those are hidden things).
---
Now if those Tourists actually are players then Blizzard will have to push the people from those shards onto the actual Server. Problem being: people might get separated from their friends. This is a thing where communication and free choice of server (read: server transfers) come into play.
---
It's a pinnacle for Blizzard because no matter what they choose to do, the community will be upset. There's no right or wrong. Servers do have limits. That's true for now as much as it has been for a decade ago. And even though Servers (and players hardware) will be easier able to handle a bigger load, there's a limit that Blizzard will need to uphold. Though as we've seen with Servers like N, E or ED, numbers should be able to become big enough so that the MASSES should remain happy.
---
Sad thing is, the happy people will stay silent while those few angry people will cry out loud - nothing to be done for those peepz...
---
How long are you going to kerp this up?
---
for some reason the forsaken aren't allowed cinematic characters (we only ever see slyvanas and nathanos who each have  non decomposed bodies)
---
Yeah but like lategame im going to focus probl more on pvp than pve since less time to play/raid so was justh refering to that there are so many totems and keybinds for them to be efficent to use right totem at the right time and fast can be a hazzle.
---
&gt; How many people this server had? Because it seems dead as fuck.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Also, if you're going to play with your kid since lvl 1, I would recommend not choosing hunter with a slow class such as warrior, it'll be painful to follow up a hunter with aspect of cheetah. Going double hunter or double slow class is your best bet.
---
[Hakkar](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Server:Hakkar_US)?    
---
&gt;Hakkar is a US Central Time PVP server in the Vengeance Battlegroup, released in February of 2006. Hakkar was at one point considered one of the best PvP servers in the world.
---
I can't decide if that would be an overreaction. Buying gold was a thing in Vanilla. 
---
But it would be a major change that sets the precedent for other major changes... like *shudders* lfd
---
BlueBlaster69????? What a name
---
Cinematics look too real, they won't put truly disgusting stuff there. In-game graphics is much more cartoony,
---
Orgrimmar isn’t a “early zone” and they clearly said they would disable it in Cities. 
---
Might want to rewatch their presentation before getting upset.
---
You’ll still see 50 players. Which is more than enough to group with. You won’t see the other 350. 
---
Btw, did you realize that private server that you played on for that launch added non-Blizzlike dynamic respawns to deal with that traffic surge? 
---
Guessing you didn’t. Based on your reply. 
---
But dynamic respawns of that nature is a bigger change and is harder to revert than sharding. 
---
A year from the launch of classic a lesser magic wand will be 500g instead of 35 silver. It ensures the only way to afford anything is buy playing into  it. 
---
Also cuz china
---
Poor try
---
old WoW forum &gt; current WoW forum
---
Int gear is all you really need to be successful. Spirit helps too. Try to use mana in bursts to maximize time regening mana. Ideally you pre-cast your highest rank healing touch and let it land when it won't overheal the tank, then immediately rejuvenation so that mana is used all at a single point of time allowing you more time before you need to heal again.
---
Keep two lower ranks of healing touch on your bar for healing smaller amounts of hp like when DPS take a hit or two, or if the tank has low hp and you can't afford to let him drop low enough for max rank healing touch.
---
Always keep thorns on the tank.
---
Get a good staff and smack enemies around when you don't need to heal, which will be pretty often before level 40 or so in most groups.
---
This was so incoherent I'm not even going to try to figure out what you meant.  Maybe reword and try again?
---
Darn.. If this is true it's something I will consider :o
---
And as we all know fashion&gt;functionality
---
No, it's because of China. Corpse stuff is forbidden there so they have to show non-corpsy undead.
---
Blizzard is fucking dead, fuck this shit.
---
The issue there is that if they are using sharding only in the starter zones and only for a short time that won't work. If they allow let's say 5k (Example) then after the first couple hours when people start hitting the second zones (Barrens, silverpine, loch modan etc.) there will be way too many people in the unsharded zones and they will have the same problems as if they had launched without it at all. 
---
Unless they plan on sharding the whole world for a month or so until the population stabilizes (Which they have not indicated) they will still have an overpopulated unplayable mess just not in the first zone. 
---
Secondly, this plan fails because nobody knows the percentage of tourists or how they will distribute themselves. It might be feasible on some servers when half the population or more is tourists. But certain servers will wind up having mostly people who really want to play for whatever reason (Private server people picking servers to congregate on, streamers, etc.). These servers, after you allow 5k (Still just an example) to play will have about that same 5k when you want to turn the caps back to normal and now you have a long queue to play for anyone on those servers as they are totally full. 
---
These are large problems that are solved by simply having normal capped servers and then aggressively merging them as soon as the dropoff happens about a month in. The community is not settled at all at that point, most people are still leveling and would barely notice. So the merges when the pop stabilizes of low pop servers together to make normal pop ones should solve the problem and leave you with however many populated realms.
---
i dont think they have yet confermed the wow token will be available in classic.
---
when i last played retail it was trivial to get enough gold per month to play for free. grinding gold in classic is a rather slow process, im pretty sure it would take  more hours playtime in classic to earn one than retail. 
---
Anyone with that much bread and water (in their only bag at the beginning) isn't picking up quest items in the meantime. lol @ the phone text: "Tarren Mill 20 ally log in!"
---
Okay.
---
My stance: This is how it is currently implemented and I see no reason to believe it should change.
---
You are telling me that not seeing a reason it should change is pulling it out of my ass
---
Other people are suggesting that it should will lead to abuse that is literally impossible with the way it's currently implemented in the client, suggesting they believe they will revert a change that was put in place specifically combat the abuse they're talking about.
---
This you seem to think is not pulling shit out of their asses?
---
Feral is by far the best tank up to 60, and you will have an easier time finding a group while also not needing to collect intellect gear.
---
Just leave healing to someone with a res until then.
---
Funny how server first on all classic servers always was lock or hunter then
---
As long as you dont mention or advertise the server why would it be a problem?
---
Lots of people play private servers and enjoy that as theres currently no alternative until Classic. Deal with it.
---
You somehow managed to spell rogue correctly the first time and then incorrectly the second time.
---
The fact that you earn gold slower in classic is what makes it more valuable. People will be trading 100 gold in classic for 100k gold on retail or something like that.  There will be a conversion rate and until inflation catches up it will likely be way more efficient to grind on classic.
---
If you have millions of gold on retail you'd gladly trade large amounts of it for a free epic mount on your first 60. That's how they will make their money.
---
No because there won't be tokens in classic.
---
I dont want 30fps
---
In my mind, Paladins are preferable than Shamans as tank, but the both are super fun and good 
---
The reason blizzard is now starting to realize it’s an issue is because the “lmfao this game is unplayable! Fix this fucking game you retard asshole”-type posts went away. Now it’s people writing long and well typed posts explaining general frustration with the content and lack of response from blizzard. The mad raging assholes are happy because they can just bash their face into the monitor for 2 hours and get gear and the core fan base is starting to realize the game is too different now.
---
So, this video has given me a deep dilemma from picking priest as my main. The versatility of Feral druid has always been super attractive to me. Having only played a feral druid as an alt back in BC/wrath, the change of flavor as my main is more exciting than a priest to me.  
---
  
---
We'll see where this goes
---
Shamans wont be tanking anything outside of fucking around with friends.
---
Paladins wont be tanking anything more than a 5 man.
---
Paladins are quite good tanking dungeons, more aoe aggro than warriors, shamans are meh.
---
Am I the only one thinking this kind of reads like a Trump tweet? 
---
Ahh yes the time where rogues go from instant poison to crippling
---
a couple things
---
1. the current loot systems are massively different from what existed in classic, so the loot trading system would necessarily need to change to fit that model
---
2. The given reason for adding this loot trading system in classic is not to combat abuse but to ease the strain on the GM teams.
---
all this is to say that no one knows what blizzard will do for sure, but judging by their past behavior I wouldn't trust them to not take the easiest route to a solution and in doing so break important aspects of the game
---
assuming the token is available yeah they will be dirt cheap for ages at the start because of how much of a pain getting the mount gold is on a first character. 
---
The slower pace is part of the charm of the game back then and effort being rewarding, today everyones everyones weekly progress is locked to rng not personal effort.
---
the token will totally change the game id argue classic is not worth the downoad if they patch the token in. 
---
Paladins can tank every dungeon as any spec as long as they have the gear for it. They are really good as AoE tanks because of Consecration. So you can do really fast runs of Strath and Scholo. Many paladins go for Consecration first while leveling up so they can tank dungeons. 
---
You can easily go for a holy spec and still be able to tank 5-mans and some stuff in raids like the imps in MC, demons in ZG, small dragons and skeletal constructs in BWL, tunnel bugs and Fankriss adds in AQ40 and spider adds in Naxxramas.
---
I have no clue about Shamans though.
---
It's the other way around, removing it requires development.
---
I won’t speak for everyone but I’m thinking yes you are. 
---
Man sticky keys really hits close to home 
---
Is Isildur really that good? It seems like Elves are just better than humans with the stuff Legolas was doing in the films. Could have slashed his hand off.
---
That’s a nice theorie 
---
That was an insult basically right after acquisition, people knew it would be the start of the downfall.
---
Please don't call the cops!
---
&gt;Nothing wrong with private server footage. Complaining about it would be like noting the Ouija board on a youtube video isn't the traditional yellow kind, so you gotta ignore the guy explaining how the whole set-up works.
---
Private server footage on wowhead is a problem. There's a lot of information we don't have about vanilla, such as mob health and resistances. If I recall correctly on that server he didn't even use Drain Life. Wowhead should not be a source for misinformation.
---
&gt;Two warriors grouped up in that vid. That's the way to do it.
---
I agree with this. But if that warrior had  the Skull mentioned earlier he'd only need to use 2 Heroic Strikes to kill Fizzle at level 9. That's easier than most level appropriate mobs. The level 9 in this video seems totally oblivious to his health and his surroundings. Playing like this, ofc Fizzle is hard. Hell, a level 10 scorpion would be challenging for this dude.
---
&gt;The lvl 9 is a 44/75 blacksmith, geared up for the fight and has his axe sharpened with a blacksmith-made sharpening stone (which he tried to give to the lvl 12 who joined him, but the guy jumped up and tried to Braveheart-charge Fizzle on his own). That's one of the arguments I made in this thread: blacksmithing is worth it on a Warrior. The class is sooo gear dependent, it's totally worth the extra grind.
---
I wholeheartedly disagree with this too. Yes, they are gear dependant but Blacksmithing is not a good solution while leveling. The time spent grinding Blacksmithing would be better used running dungeons or leveling. The gold required would also be enough to funnel gear through AH. It's also very hard to craft level appropriate gear unless you enter higher level zones.
---
Engineering or alchemy have a much higher impact if you insist on taking a crafting profession at all. On a first char I'd even skip crafting alltogether and focus on double gathering instead.
---
Well that is good advice...for a mage.
---
good old ask jeeves
---
anyone else remember how bad search engines sucked back then.
---
dont even get me started on porn on a 56k modem watching those jpeg lines slowly load and thinking about if you even wanted to load the rest of the pic
---
What do you mean? The original wow trailer cinematic had an undead warlock shambling through a swamp killing murlocs..
---
Let the bodies hit the...... psh psh psh psh
---
FLLLOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
---
Generating gold into existence makes it so everyone who grinds out their gold is immediately put at a disadvantage. The server economy is thrown into disarray.
---
Your examples don't even apply: prohibition (alcohol) and abstinence-only education? Really? How are they even related to guying gold via wow tokens? 
---
Your shit reads like a Scott Adams sock puppet. Man, that guy sure loves himself, too.
---
No thottbot ? 
---
Shaman tank is possible but it requires so much more focus, patience, and skill from your group that most people will just say no thanks.
---
Paladins can tank very well until raids, then they are extremely niche.
---
the only thing modern blizzard cares about today is profit.
---
vanilla was designed by people trying to make a great game, retail is designed by people trying to keep you subbed as long as possible.
---
if they turn around retail and the direction they take classic will be based only on what people in a boardroom being paid millions of dollars think will be most profitable to the company. 
---
tbh i dont think blizzard even exist in anything other than name alone anymore, its activision all the way down now. I will be shocked if they dont find a way to monetize the shit out of classic and ruin it in the process.
---
Apply HOTS and then jump around or help dps.
---
Refresh hots and talk shit if you are pulling higher dps than any dps. 
---
That's because WoW and TBC were released prior to Activision acquiring Blizzard
---
Half those threads were just people trolling.
---
And yet we lost RSC and RS2. 
---
paladins lack taunt and dps pull agro a lot , i believe thats the main problem
---
Question is, was that cinematic used in China and did it have visible bones? Or did China change the laws afterwards, for example Undeads have a different model in China without visible bones, because it seems you aren't allowed to show bones. See for example this article: https://kotaku.com/5331872/wow-finally-returns-to-china-with-a-little-more-censorship
---
 Question is, why do I care about China?
---
I will also try to Main a Feral in classic, and He proves that kittys can be viable BUT it takes so much more effort to be competitive, many more consumables and a lot of gnomeregan runs for the crowd pummeler.. you can top the dps Meters but compared to a rogue its Just insanely more Preparation and the Rotation is also more complicated with powershifting. Just have to See if its worth it (especially the farming of the Mace!)
---
China doesn't allow undead bodies and Blizzard doesn't want to do 2 renders of their cinematics. 
---
Only amateurs played without alt tabing to thott every 3 seconds
---
You don't. The company does
---
Pretty much this.  Most shamans I knew had zero intrest in tanking. However, both pallys and shamans spent a lot of time off tanking in 5 mans.  Most tanks couldn't handle tanking multiple mobs so typically shamans and pallys, and even hunters pets would pick up the slack.
---
Needs more queue time!
---
I actually had a Shaman tank LBRS 5 man last night. It went shockingly well.
---
He was a lvl 60, not sure what spec, and has a mishmash of blue and purple gear (mostly blue).
---
We additionally had a Hunter, Warlock, Rogue, and Druid (me).
---
The thought of healing this creature absolutely terrified me, especially after seeing that he wasn’t grossly overgeared for the dungeon.
---
We made it all the way to the room before Wyrmthalak with next to no real issues.
---
We didn’t make it to Wyrmthalak not because limitations to Shaman tanking capacity, but more so because our CC wasn’t as solid as it needed to be.
---
Shaman could hold affront extremely well, and wasn’t nearly as squishy as anticipated (still squishy compared to warrior though). The biggest issue was a lack of an “oh shit” buttons to maintain control when we fucked up,
---
We accidentally pulled extra adds twice that run and it was utter chaos. No way for him to gather aggro, which was actually a good thing because he didn’t have the defensive cooldowns to keep him alive even if he did. I ended up dying in every instance he couldn’t open up on a pack with Chain Lightning, due to passive aggro gained from healing.
---
Also, he had to sit to drink after every 2 pulls. Otherwise, it was decent. I thought he’d just melt at every boss, but that wasn’t the case.
---
Mana is not a problem and neither is damage. Paladins wear plate after 40 just like a warrior and unlike a warrior can stack defense without rage starving.
---
How much more time does the consumable + Pummeler farm add to a raid night prep?
---
I played on a RP-PVP server back in the day and did not regret it. I was not a hardcore RP'er, but whenever I interacted with people I assumed RP stance and tried to keep things in RP spirit. We had a small guild that did some events and it was all good.
---
One side benefit, we had a good group of level 19 twinks that formed a guild just for that and we had epic matches against the RP guild on the alliance side with their 19 group.
---
Hope that can be found again as I feel I was able to get everything out of the game in this setting, RP, PVP, etc.
---
Its nothing agaisnt free speech, but you cant go in a english school before colege if your parent are not english. So with the current law i cant send my daughter to anything in 100% english like daycare primary school.
---
How
---
Well I believe what they are doing is on farm. You are a cat so you can stealth/sprint to the boss. If you have something on farm and your raid leader doesn't mind you conserving then you could probably just save for progression. You pretty much have to be alch or herb to help you with consumables. I was pulling 320 dps in shitty pre-bis gear(9% hit) without consumables, buffs, pots or the wolf helm. So he goes on to mention that pummeler is only 60-100 total dps increase in comment on the YouTube.  
---
Either way, not bad for being a ready off tank/brez.
---
When i was young english class will only be 50 minute every 2 or 3 day a week and they started only in the 4th year of school(around 10 year old).
---
The sad part is most of the older here dont speak english.
---
But now they start way earlier
---
You can always have another res class in your group, which I would recommend for long instances. 
---
Int gear should be enough. My strategy would be to start with max rank rejuvenation and regrowth on the tank, then down ranked healing touch to spot heal, tossing a rejuvenation every now and then. 
---
I played on an undocumented server that starts you at 60. i tried the rotation, its not too bad and with crappy pre-BiS (9% hit) I was able to get to ~320 dps without consumables, buffs, pots or the wolf helm. So I assume with some decent gear wolf helm and pummeler you could be at a pretty good standing as long as you get a decent amount of consumables.  
---
my guesstimate for Gnomer runs would be 8-10min but thats just off the top of my head
---
Paladins can tank dungeons well and also do well on certain raid trash and boss adds. DPSers and healers just need to be slightly more careful not to overaggro due to the lack of taunt but it's not a big deal. Paladins will also probably take a bit more damage than Druids and Warriors will.
---
Shaman tanking is much more impractical. There is alot you can theoretically do, but it takes alot of effort and isn't nearly as good as Paladins.
---
For example here is a case of a pserver in 2010 that even back then already had made 3 million in from running a wow server and selling items. 
---
A quote: 
---
&gt;How seriously does Blizzard take the operation of private World of Warcraft servers? On August 10th the company was awarded a stunning $88,594,539.00 judgment against a woman who operated a business running her own WoW server and selling items via Paypal. That may seem steep, but over $3 million of that amount came from "inappropriate profits" the woman made from running the server. That's right: her private server, run under the name Scapegaming, was a multimillion dollar business. It also made her a very attractive target for litigation.

---
Chill out, I was paraphrasing from memory. Early zones indeed
---
Thats because he gets ahead of the pack 15mins in and never looks back.
---
You WILL be more dead than alive as a lvl 30 trying to kill lvl 30 panthers/tigers/x. 
---
It will always be bad to get to STV at 30 at a full fledged PvP server.
---
same here. please someone holla for a US RPPvP guild
---
This is why.  
---
I distinctly remember that everybody postponed everything they planned to do in STV and joined the weekly sunday evening raid on Grom'gol on german Kel'Thuzad PvP server.
---
Elemental shamans sitting on the guard tower shooting chain lightnings down into the attacking alliance.
---
I don't agree with tourists hitting second zones within a couple of hours, they're not speed levelers.
---
&gt; this plan fails because nobody knows the percentage of tourists or how they will distribute themselves
---
I absolutely agree, this plan can fail badly if Blizz overestimates the number of tourists.
---
There's also another problem, someone playing the demo (don't remember who he is so can't give credits) said that because of sharding people were choosing the highest populated server because nothing could stop them (like queues or server full for example) so the other servers ended up quite desolated.
---
The same could happen on classic launch with people over-saturating a selected few servers making it impossible to take sharding away later on.
---
&gt; aggressively merging them as soon as the dropoff happens about a month in
---
This would be my favorite solution as well but unfortunately it seems Blizzard is allergic to merges, they don't do it on retail, they do connected realms instead (it would be horrible on classic because you totally lose realm individuality).
---
60-100 is a pretty big jump, thats 10% of his DPS and 25% more on your 320 dps.
---
There are going to be alot of mages, but there will be similar numbers of warlocks, warriors, and rogues too. They are the big 4 DPS classes so expect to see them alot.
---
you can do dungeons without a dedicated tank at all. think about that. so all this claims "look im tanking" are retarded. its not a question of what can possibly be donу (everything can be done), as i said you can do dungeons without a tank or in not full groups even. its about what is more convienient, thats why ppl run wars/feral or run 5 ppl. cos its faster. and vanilla dungeons take a ton of time.
---
Org has a back door in vanilla?
---
Keep an eye on /r/PantheonMMO, they post news and stream regularly.
---
the sticky keys part lol
---
They do make great tanks in ZG though. Almost every single pack of trash in there is just a huge pull with multiple mobs, and the bosses either dont require taunt or can be tanked solo by your warrior/druid maintank.
---
Druids have dash though
---
RSC was shut down because no one played it at all.
---
Rs2 is osrs with new content. Which is exactly what classic wow will have to do in order to survive in the long run. If this model didn’t work.. osrs would have been died rather than more popular than ever.
---
That’s why I don’t care what these #nochanges people say. You are going to need quality of life updates and new content on this game in order for it to survive. Yes it’ll have a player base for a year.. after that? I doubt it. Most the reason why these private servers have survived is because of the resets they’ve done.. or people have just hopped server to server. 
---
I remember the release of osrs.. people said all this same shit “I won’t play if you make changes”... “pets come out I quit” yet pet hunting is the #1 grinder content. Simply put these players arnt the people we want to run the future of the game. You want the people who will stick through it and help the dev team create an amazing experience.
---
Considering every class can just slap on a movement speed enchant or use the arathi basin boots, this is not true.
---
Is warlock and warrior switched? what causes the jagged lines on warlock?
---
Agree with the music being an often overlooked thing that was amazing as hell - but my favorites are all the music from the human areas like Hillsbrad (i think they’re shared with Elwynn and Hinterlands etc.), the Barrens, and some of the Ashenvale tracks - again, some shared elsewhere.
---
Lol that top picture looks like human in Halloween costume
---
It's not because of China. Regular undead models are already edited there so they could've just given him a regular model instead of spending money on a new one.
---
My bet is they want people to 'like' Nathanos but he wasn't 'pretty' enough.
---
I really miss the old model instead of a regular human with red eyes.
---
No flying mounts means that people will be down on the ground in the open. So things will get much more personal and exciting.
---
I don't know about the RP-PvEs, but the RP-PVP's are already talking about patrolling the contested zones.
---
A gaping one. I actually got lost when i logged into retail as I was looking for the back door and couldn't find it!
---
Not only was there a back door, but the backdoor was a hop skip and a jump away from Thrall and Vol'Jin. If you went through the front door of Org, it was a huge bottleneck that led to the fucking pain train of Saurfang and everyone on top of the bank and in the auction house, so going through the backdoor was a lot better for raids. Even though it was a one way street, there was a lot more room for manoeuvring. 
---
Willing to make a wager on this? lol
---
Although I've elsewhere argued why I'm comfortable with loot trading, I'll agree that this would be an improvement over it. And disallowing name changes is also something that I'd get behind regardless of this issue.
---
Don't they have their own client, though? 
---
YES, fucking outbakjack, he was a great player. When AQ was new I would see him at the Cenarion Hold often. I'm sure if you start rattling off names I'll remember a bunch of them. We had Faylaen, Tactician, Orean, Caingarl, Naz, and a bunch of other well known players. I don't think I was thought of as particularly important in comparison, being a druid and all, but since most people couldn't kill me I was largely left alone.
---
I don't know that that would solve Blizzard's support dilemma, since I'd imagine a good deal of loot disputes arise from pugs set to need/greed/pass.
---
Hahaha i love it
---
These have all been very helpful, but I especially appreciate this suggestion. It didn't even cross my mind that I could be using multiple rank healing touches to conserve mana. A little embarrassed, but appreciative.
---
I don't think I will ever understand the twitch culture. I like to watch a stream every now and then but seriously what the fuck, who wants to follow a random ass dude around and help him do quests for hours on end.
---
Most likely yes. 
---
What im hoping for is that they consider setting a pop lock for each faction on said servers. Don't want the faction swing to be to bad at any one time towards one faction or another.
---
We can only wait and see i guess or rather see what they throw up in the next few months.
---
I got mine too! Super excited to see how the development went with all the confusion that apparently happened.
---
I was on a backwater PvE server (Aerie Peak-US) that was known for being terrible but we still had a few guilds everyone was in awe of.  I played Horde which was way worse than Alliance.  How bad?  We were the best horde side guild at the end of vanilla and were only a few bosses into BWL.  Of course it was one of the later servers launched which is one reason progression was bad.  According to the old wowwiki page for our realm, there was a hardcore horde guild (Delerium) that cleared everything through aq40 and transferred before the naxx patch but considering the realm rolled in early ‘06 that seems unlikely.
---
On the Alliance is where the two major guilds were when i played - Avalon and Reborn.  They dominated us but even they only got a boss or two in Naxx.  Seeing one of them out in the world was amazing and rare.  Not being a PvP server made things a little less interesting though.
---
This has been removed as it has no specific relevance to Classic. 
---
Gonna go with a solid probably. I don’t think most people relate politics to everything, let alone a video game quest text.
---
What are some of the improvements you’d make to his route?
---
But testing an ability that has server side scaling will let us emulate that ability with 99% accuracy instead of just 90% based on low resolution youtube videos where we dont know peoples spec and gear.
---
Things like procrates of various weapons and items f.ex is one of the most poorly documented part of Vanilla. Classic will let us figure out this for certain.
---
Tbh it was probably more to do with you healing as a druid. It goes priest&gt;shaman&gt;paladin&gt;druid. Their HoTs cost a lot and that 3 sec heal really sucks. Any big damage is always a struggle with druids. I had a druid complain that I'm a crappy tank that takes too much damage once before he ragequit... I was over 440 def with 4.5k hp unbuffed... didn't realize I needed world buffs and a flask of titans to kill Dire Maul trash with a druid healing... I personally take any other healer over a druid because of how bad they are.
---
It was 2004/5. Nobody used ask Jeeves. Those Nokias were already way outdated. Sidekicks and 3650s were already out. And I don't know anyone who was still on dial-up either....
---
This is like a "people who weren't around in the early 2000s but think they know what it was like" starter pack.
---
In the video he's doing 900-1200. Of course 320 is without wolf helm and Mana buffs which will be much more of an effect.
---
OP seems to be pretty knowledgeable, but for other players considering feral, keep in mind that, as your server develops, it becomes easier and easier to change into a feral druid's role. Yes, in the beginning, you should probably be healing, but as time goes on you'll pick up gear that other people either don't want or don't need.
---
A few examples: Once MC is on farm, your chances of getting a Quick Strike Ring, Wristguards of Stability, Band of Accuria, and Cloak of the Shrouded Mists all go up.
---
Once BWL is on farm, your chances of getting a Cloak of Draconic Might, Cloak of Firemaw, Interlaced Shadow Jerkin, Herald of Woe, Taut Dragonhide Shoulderpads, Taut Dragonhide Belt, and more all go up, saying nothing of Malfurion's Blessed Bulwark which no rogues want and Nefarian's head. I'll stop there but AQ20/40 have unreal gear for druids as well.
---
As you play you will pick up good gear from PvP or BG rewards, and from crafting such as the bat gear from ZG or devilsaur gear. It can be a slow process but it is certainly an inevitable one. I still think being a healing druid and picking up gear over time is the way to go but forge your own path!
---
A+ may may. Very good.
---
You are clueless about shamans as tanks.
---
In order to tank, you need a combination of the following
---
- mitigation. Shield carriers get it through those and their (plate) armor. In order to bear-tank, you'd use dodge and high stam instead.       
---
- threat generation.
---
- taunt to re-grab a boss or adds
---
Shaman don't have enough of any of those. Even if you were to stack agility for dodge, do you have a taunt and enough threat generation to get and keep the mob's attention?   Perhaps if your damage output is high enough, you might pull it off. But the healer keeping you alive might pull threat simply by doing his/her job of keeping you alive.
---
Maybe in small 5-man runs, but not raiding.
---
If you played vanilla through legion, why can we tell that you're like 13 from how you type?
---
"You have no interest in proper conversation"
---
Then downvotes and ignores everything you dont disagree with.. hmm
---
&gt; It went shockingly well.
---
&gt;  I ended up dying in every instance he couldn’t open up on a pack with Chain Lightning, due to passive aggro gained from healing.
---
&gt; Also, he had to sit to drink after every 2 pulls.
---
Ok, LBRS is really hard, but I mean, it sounds aweful what you describe...
---
Mages are pretty popular, but that's simply because they do great DPS and are good levelers, AoE or not. I wouldn't worry about feefling like it's overpopulated though, more than enough people will be playing so that it doesn't really matter anyway.
---
Cos u were a rich boi probably
---
You can at least try to be honest about why these things work the way they do.
---
Private servers are based off of the 1.12 patch. It's never going to be possible to accurately emulate all off vanilla which means things like the honor system, pvp gear and all those things have to be added at a time deemed to make sense by whoever runs the server.
---
This is the exact same scenario as we will see from Blizzard with Classic, which is ALSO based off of the 1.12 patch.
---
Thanks Hycran, always like your input. I was hoping to tank 60 dungeons and use that to gather decent gear for MC. Was actually going to do the opposite of what your saying and use MC/BWL to farm resto gear. Again I have only played feral as PVP think I'm TBC so it will all be new to me in the vanilla world, which is very exciting.   
---
I feel as long as I study Taladril's and Shedo's work and can make for a good hybrid if I put in the time.
---
&gt; What happend if a player never clicks anything? What happens if he leaves the group or disconnects? What if he is on the loading screen? What if he transitions to the loading screen? When the piece of loot becomes unlocked? What if the player confirms after the piece becomes unlocked again?
---
&gt; If the player transitions to an instance (physically changing servers), then the confirmation state should be transferred to another server too, adding a whole bunch of between-server communication states again.
---
Well first we can sum up your questions by : what happen if the player cannot receive the piece?
---
The answer is simple, he will not receive the piece. Same as today in retail so I don't get it why you try to think too far into the same question base being "if he is in a state he cannot receive the item". In retail if you are in state you cannot receive it, then you don't receive it. The window is obviously not the same as a  summoning window.
---
What does that even mean?
---
We will though. Take the procrate of Ironfoe f.ex.
---
What is the easiest way to confirm the correct procrate?
---
1 - Go on Classic and farm the weapon, then swing at the immortal mobs in Blasted Lands 2000 times.
---
2- Look up some 640x480 low bitrate video on youtube and cross reference the numbers with some archived forum post to how often it procs
---
Server side scripts just mean it cant be datamined. It's still pretty easy to figure out how it works when you have access to playing on the servers and are determined to find out.
---
I had dialup back in 2004, I also had one of those blockias. Even though they were a few years out of date. And loads of people used [ask](https://ask.com) jeeves was insanely popular back in 2004. What are you even on about you gatekeeper
---
To be fair that is a terrible example. Because Onyxia Deep breath mechanics are guessworks based off of those exact videos that the person you responded to were talking about.
---
I seriously doubt anyone actually sat down and tried to gather data on how deep breath worked during actual Vanilla. Meanwhile after classic you can just make a raid and figure it out close enough that one could never tell the difference.
---
Ehh there's a humungous difference between wow classic as its an mmo and cod 4 remastered. 
---
An mmo thrives on the content being fed into over time, cod not so much. Cod depends on the gameplay loop that it has, and they make many slight adjustments for each iteration that comes out annually. I'm not disagreeing and saying it's a bad thing,  but for cod it's different when you go into a remaster of a game and get killed by melee weapons which were never in the original. 
---
It's like playing wow classic and then a month later they add heirlooms, then another month later they add lfg feature, another month and now lfr is out. These are nice, but they were not there in classic and just like with call of duty that would leave an undesired taste in my mouth seeing stuff that wasn't in the original. 
---
That was TBC, Classic had him summoning an Infernal.
---
I should do that! Thanks!
---
Lol no.  11 dps isnt indistinguishable, even with the slower speed.
---
&gt; Question is, was that cinematic used in China and did it have visible bones (i don't remember 100%)?
---
No, the undead in both the classic and TBC cinematic trailer had flesh covering their arms.
---
Wait what? What's alt-tab? I always had to exit the game to get my information and then re-enter.
---
Just wait a few more year , osrs will be the new Rs3.
---
You cant trust a compagny that bury every fucking version they make.
---
Somehow his human form looks like more of an edgelord than his zombie form.
---
Not true, they just cover up the bones sticking out and change skulls and bones to bread in the world
---
&gt; Generating gold into existence makes it so everyone who grinds out their gold is immediately put at a disadvantage. The server economy is thrown into disarray.
---
Before commenting make sure you understand what you're talking about.
---
The WoW Token adds exactly zero gold to the game.
---
You do if you want that Ony buff.
---
I mean that's a cool stand to take out of principle and I respect that, but thats purely all it will be principle. The same amount of $ will be exchanged for gold the same people will still cheat regardless of the tokens the only difference is how much does it will impact the economy via inflation and who gets the profit blizzard or gold farmers.  
---
If mmo's could get rid of gold farmers they would of a long time ago, tokens or the d3 debacle of making gold non-tradeable are the only ways I've seen that really hurt gold farmers. And with blizzards new track record there is 0 chance they will police the shit out of gold farming so it will be even worse then it was in vanilla. Unless of course the gold farmers are directly competing with their WoW tokens in which they'll definitely try to do more to stop it.  
---
Whether they add the tokens or we have gold farmers I don't really  care since 90 % of items that matter come from raiding and not from the economy. People are going to cheat regardless and get away with it, but for those people who do care about the prices and the inflation on the auction house gold farmers 24/7 botting gold is going to hurt prices alot more then wow tokens will.
---
Do want to to play a Paladin or shaman as a tank or why are you asking? If so, be warned that there is not gear to be a good Pala/Shaman Tank in raids. So basically if you want to progress in raiding it will be really hard to find people letting these classes tank for good reasons. 
---
Hell yes. I won't forget until they show me they have adopted a different attitude.
---
Haha fucking pleb! 
---
**TL;DR:** You ain't tanking shit if nobody wants a Paladin tank.
---
After leveling many Paladins on various private servers (through various stages of bugs and bad programming) and reading every vanilla Paladin tanking guide on the Internet, I'm pretty sure I can comment on this.
---
Like Groucho Marx said: “I wouldn't join a club that would have me as a member.” Any players  inexperienced enough to accept a Paladin tank while leveling were consistently unable to deal with the particular needs of a Paladin tank (positioning, threat management, ranged-pulling, etc.)
---
*Some* people claim that Protection Paladins are efficient for leveling, not because you can tank dungeons, but because you can skip questing by AoE leveling.
---
There are a couple problems with this opinion:
---
First off, /sit macros are not going to be a thing. Private servers are working off broken / wonky code and they can't or haven't wanted to change this. This makes many Paladin talents less effective than they are on pservers. Some talents actually negatively affect your ability to tank, such as Anticipation (noob-trap) and Deflection in the Ret tree.
---
Secondly, Consecration for anything other than “tanking” *sucks*. It's really, really useless for soloing and I'm convinced that anybody who suggests rushing Holy tree for Consecrate in order to “AoE grind” hasn't actually leveled a Paladin effectively before.
---
The fact is, Protection Paladin is hugely inefficient while leveling. The YouTuber [CaffeineInjected](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq2gA8qCTLY) has been doing an AoE Tankadin vanilla playthrough (shield-spike memes and all!) and a few of his observations have been:
---
* AoE grinding while leveling probably won't work when Classic releases because of all the AoE Mages (and other leveling classes) contesting the same mobs.
---
* AoE grinding isn't even that efficient until you're geared up at 50+
---
* Any type of group play is going to be near impossible to do because lolmemespec.
---
On that third point: PuGing as a paladin tank has been one of the worst experiences leveling on private servers that I've ever had.
---
Literally *nobody* wants to gimp their DPS just because a special snowflake wants to run a memespec. Nobody cares. Nobody wants to understand. You're only begging for a toxic experience.
---
This is on private servers, which are notorious for having patient, experienced players who know what they're getting into. It will be a million times worse in Classic with all the tourists, new players and returning players who think they remember, but have no fucking clue. The backlash against memespecs is going to be real.
---
You can try leveling as Protection but you're going to be in for a rude awakening.
---
The token doesn’t inject or add gold to the economy. The inflation will happen whether blizzard does a token system or not.
---
You're fun. 
---
r/StarterPacks
---
Hey I hope you're well man. Not sure why you're getting involved. Your comment is not very constructive. Just to let you know I haven't down voted anyone. Not sure why you think that. Since a proper conversation was out of the realm of possibility I took the logical decision to withdraw from the conversation. Which is my right to do so. As I said before not sure how exactly you were ever involved so it's an off topic comment which I have to ignore. Feel free to message me anytime if you want to talk. Don't want to cause any clutter on this thread. Thanks!
---
I had a beastly 1gig of ram. I could alt-tab to thott to help me find the hunter pets with the fastest attack speed.
---
yeah they cant do connected realms with classic though so it may force their hand. The issue with the speed of leveling is that the sharding of "Beginning zones" was not defined. It could be just valley of trials and once you hit durotar everyone is in the same world again. I don't know how they plan on dealing with it, but you are right that people tend to self select high pop and cram a server full when there is no barrier. With luck queues and caps will solve that issue for launch.
---
I was walking to my car at the end of the day in high school. (That sweet 88 firebird with t tops).  One of my best friends was walking beside me and goes “know what this is!?” While holding up a game time card. He then explained what WoW was and how 2 of our other friends were playing it already. I got it that night. We leveled and pvpd together up until our 50s. At that point a few of them had stopped playing and our small guild of 30 players was falling apart as we were getting closer to max level. At around 50 I left the guild because I wanted to raid and I loved this game even if it wasn’t for my friends. Only one of them stuck around for BC. I quickly found a raiding guild as I was a resto druid and had established a good reputation on my server. I joined &lt;Crimson Legacy&gt; and started running ubrs with the same 9 people every day. We eventually progressed into MC and beyond. 
---
So, without inserting quest tables ala WoD (wtf were they called? where you had a minion/stooge who were asigned the task, with percentages of success displayed?), then your saying Blizz is gonna sell wow tokens for ... what?.. 5 to 30 gold/ea? Because gold isn't as easy to come by, and people saved their gold for mounts, getting abilities through class trainers (holy hell, that was expensive at higher levels), or -- god forbid-- you needed to re-spec your character again and again, taking it up to 50 gold a pop.
---
If they want to pump out gold as a reward in exchange for real world, who is gonna lay down $20 real world money for a token worth 5 to 30 in-game gold? They would need to install mission tables and other shit that didn't exist in vanilla.
---
OCD triggered....
---
&gt; who is gonna lay down $20 real world money for a token worth 5 to 30 in-game gold?
---
I assume many players would.
---
But that's beside the point. I can tell you read nothing of what I posted because I don't mention *or care* about the effect the WoW Token has on the game.
---
My premise and argument are about a bigger problem than game mechanics.
---
Yes but if they don’t put the tokens in classic then you aren’t gonna be able to sell your retail token for gold on classic through any sanctioned means and run a risk of getting ripped off.
---
People always wanted everything asap. Now they have it and there's no point sticking around. The longing and sense of achievement is gone, this hurts the players and company alike, as we could see it through the years. 
---
I really wonder what they really think about this at actiblizz. There must be something in the background we don't know, there's just no way they don't see this.
---

That's not mechanics. It's the economy. It's the grind. It's our (the players) time. Time invested, gold earned.
---
&gt;because I don't mention or care about the effect the WoW Token has on the game.    
---
So all you care about is making sweet, sweet bank by selling tokens? Activision-Blizzad, is that you?
---
This practice is one of the reasons bonds came to Old School RuneScape. People were having to bounce from RuneScape 3 and OSRS to trade/swap for game time.
---
Gold swapping is also a thing over there that I'm 99.99% sure will exist in Classic WoW as well unless its highly regulated and bannable. 
---
Maelstrom - NA. Or unsub.
---
I was a resto druid and loved it. You have a ton of utility and you get innervate. Plus, one of your best healing items comes from a quest in un goro.
---
The lack of a normal Rez doesn’t bother anyone but you. 
---
You don’t know anything about loot trading other than it’s going to be in classic. Why not wait till we get more info?
---
Yeah pretty sure I already had 5-10 Mbit in 2004

Please provide a source.

After leveling many Paladins on various private servers (through various stages of bugs and bad programming) and reading every vanilla Paladin tanking guide on the Internet (the best one is by Krynn but I can't link to it because it's on a pserver forum), I'm pretty sure I can comment on this.
---
Like Groucho Marx said: “I wouldn't join a club that would have me as a member.” Any players inexperienced enough to accept a Paladin tank while leveling are consistently unable to deal with the particular needs of a Paladin tank (positioning, threat management, ranged-pulling, not stunning, etc.)

---
First off, /sit macros are not going to be a thing. Private servers are working off broken / wonky code and they can't or haven't wanted to change this. In Classic this means Paladin tanking is going to be significantly nerfed, especially considering talents like Anticipation actually diminish your ability to tank by also increasing your Dodge + Parry (Anti-stats for Paladin.)

---
How is that gatekeeping if half his starter pack is a few years out of date. Ask Jeeves existed, in the same sense that it still "even" today. Google had already dominated the market, Yahoo picked up any scraps. Sorry if you can't differentiate between 1998 and 2005 in your mind. It was a long time ago but I still can...
---
I'm pretty sure a raspberry pi has the processing power of a 2004 computer
---
alliance because night elves and goldshire
---
Lacking memory though :) 
---
I've done some low level shaman tanking (RFC, WC, BFD, SFK), and it went really well. The passive threat from rockbiter weapin is really useful, and earthshock works as a taunt when you lose agro. I think shaman tanks do more damage than warrior tanks, but have to spend more time drinking between pulls.
---
If you want to define the game economy as not part of the game mechanics, sure. Okay.
---
But you still haven't understood my post. I suggest going back and rereading it. It has nothing to do with the economy or in-game mechanics.
---
Here, seems like you're having trouble. I'll summarize my argument:
---
&gt; Third-party black market vendors becomes an attack vector for your playerbase. When gold-farming goes wrong your customers are in real world danger, facing crimes such as hacking, identity theft, credit-card fraud, etc.
---
&gt; A responsible company cannot afford to pretend it's still 2004 when it comes to what we've learned about player harm-reduction. Even though the WoW Token will negatively affect user-experience, this impact is not worth uninstalling the most effective tool against hacking/identity-theft/fraud: A safe, legal alternative to gold-selling.
---
It really depends on your group, but even a skilled and well geared party would take longer than today. An average group would take waaay longer. Hard to say really, gear and skill mattered back then.
---
Seems kinda scummy for guild to get you Thunderfury only for you to bail on them
---
That's mage's blink.
---
Warcraft series basically. also warcraft 3 specifically hyped me so much, at the time i was so into the lore.
---
game magazines showed screenshots and their descriptions just sparked my imagination, which once i played the actual game it managed to exceed my expectations and imagination (also first mmo rush)
---
So there were TWO cinematics with decaying corpses
---
You angry about a meme, friend
---
The token system won’t do that. The prices will go up naturally through inflation, also the gold sellers/botters/hackers.
---
I like crendor but if those weren't the most cherry picked topics out of a plentora of wholesome ones...  plus most of the ones he listed seemed like trolling to me.  
---
Wow look at fancy pants there with a flatscreen monitor.  I was still using my crappy CRT until Cataclysm.
---
Having any purples really seems like he outgears that place though. 
---
Thanks for your kind comment. I know I haven’t played for a while but I still try to do my best to contribute.
---
You’re actually in better shape in classic than you would have been originally as having access to Dire Maul will give you a number of pieces of gear for both your feral and healer sets. Combine that with some gear from UBRS and you’ll be laughing. For tanking, Make sure to get the Mark of Tyranny, not Blackhands breadth. After all that I’m certain you’ll be able to collect gear for tanking and healing.
---
And yes, gear delegation in MC can be really rough. Even though everyone had more access to information, not everyone will have every slot of their pre-raid BiS before hitting MC. It can take a long time before gear starts funneling down to Druid’s, but sometimes you get lucky and things can just fall in your lap.
---
I’m the beginning, Druid’s really need additional healing power from their heals due to not necessarily having a lot of +heal gear. I’d recommend something like 3/13/37 so you get a decent autoroot chance, keep the QOL feral abilities and max out every good healing ability in the tree. Moonglow spec is great for Druid’s that are really juiced on +heals, especially after ZG enchants are our.
---
Wow, that sounds really stupid. How can they call the game *World* of Warcraft if you can't have a war in the world?
---
ah ok, I thought maybe it was warrior charge or something
---

---
Critical thinking cap is spinning a red warning light bubble. Sounds like some fallacious reasoning.
---
Fear based motivational tactic. Nice. Perhaps you should take a job with the NSA.     
---
Who gives two shits what gold farmers want or do? Just because they exist doesn't mean it's allowed... doesn't mean players should or even want to buy their crap.
---
I'm mad yo
---
You've at the very least changed my mind on sharding, I'd not thought it all the way through
---
More copypasta from my post:
---
&gt; EDIT: You'll notice I completely sidestepped the issue of whether or not players who seek out black-market gold farmers “deserve” to get hacked and their bank accounts stolen. I ignored this because it's a fucking stupid argument that only a thirteen year old would use.
---
&gt; Players will use these services. Period. Full stop. It's up to the developers to implement systems that protect users. Oftentimes that means protecting users from themselves. We've learned this over and over the hard way.
---
it's vanilla. If you get 30 fps from that, spend $200 and upgrade to the cheapest laptop possible.
---
There's a not so modern proverb - "You dont have to care about politics, but politics care about you."
---
A more modern version would be - "You can make jokes about politics, but politics wont joke about you"
---
Great story, thanks for sharing!
---
It’s neat that they have a canon reason for his model update. 
---
The game didn't drop with knowledge at it's current level nor patch progression where it will be on actual classic. Vanilla is not classic. They are different in many ways. Please continue talking out your ass.
---
&gt;Right, so people can buy gold from gold farmers anyway so tokens don’t change anything?
---
Woah, are you serious?  It's clear you haven't done any research on the massive impact Tokens and legal action from Blizzard has had on the botters and gold sellers.  These are public knowledge multimillion dollar federal cases, and documented drops in the WoW gold selling industry that you literally are ignoring because you don't want Tokens.
---
&gt;It has to be the stupidest argument ever, there is 0 logic in legalizing something just because a small percentage of people do it anyway. 
---
Has you ever heard of the prohibition?  Do you follow marijuana legislation?  These things have precedence 
---
&gt;Do you want to combat illegal gun murders by legalizing murder?
---
This has no relationship to supply and demand, but sounds edgy 10/10.
---
&gt;Creating a legal (in this case, not against the ToU) way to buy gold will only serve to rapidly increase the amount of people who buy gold. Legitimizing a p2w structure won’t make the game any better. 
---
These aren't facts, just projections of your worries.  Fear of the unknown isn't an argument.  "Rapidly increase the amount of people who buy gold" based on what information?  The "p2w structure" exists with or without Tokens.  People with no disposable income or otherwise being able to play because of Tokens does make the game better.
---
I will make any wager you want that the world first 60 will be wayyyyy below 4d20h, and a mage will readily dip below 4. It also depends on how "legit" the runs are since many people abuse mob tagging to tweak speeds.
---
Whoever took the screenshot is getting 30fps
---
Need to consider these are tank spank no movement fights with boss kill times of 50 seconds to 2 mins.  Also bis gear with full consumables.  Pre aq ferals wont come close to the top of meters for anything other then maybe vael.  Having a priest main and casually leveling a feral and starting to gear it once bwl is on farm would work out very well.
---
'/Emote You have been flagged as afk, please type /afk to cancel this.' 
---
Always used to be able to get one or two with this
---
Cause it’s a pserver. Where lupus is pre 1.9 and hunters are post talent revamp. Want a beefy hunter play on a pserver.
---
Oh no...
---
This will inevitably be my plan. My heart is always with priest but ferals are just so damn fun. I think I have cemented my plan.
---
Yeah but it was worth it. Just like retail, porn is given to the youngin’s too easily nowadays. Back in my day we used to have to work for our titties. 
---
Same is on the official one too. 
---
This. This. This. Not enough gold? Buy a token, and buy your bloodvine pieces. It'd turn it P2W, and also destroy the game's economy.
---
As a pala, I want to be able to tank, heal or dps in 5-mans while I'm leveling. That's it. I just want variety while Im leveling.
---
Didn't take this as a grammar lesson, justh came to ask advice and if u wish to be a dick about it mabey try lil harder ey? :))

I had dial up. Not all of us were fortunate assholes.

---
You only need 4 GB RAM!! $21.49!
---
Why is that out of curiosity? How would WoW Tokens matter in the scheme of things? Even with WoW Tokens the gold comes from inside the server.
---
Imagine the following scenario. John wants to buy a mount, his friend Steve grinds gold all day in DM. Steve gifts John the gold he needs.
---
Now imagine the scenario with wow Tokens. John wants a mount. Steve grinds gold all day in DM. John puts a wow token on the AH which Steve is happy to buy. 
---
Both of these scenarios have the exact same effect on the day to day workings of the servers economy. 
---
It's not like they compete with one another in vanilla.
---
2-4 Weeks and 2-4 Months to 60 both have about same % (about 20%).  There is a lot of confused people thinking they will reach 60 in 2-4 weeks lolz
---
If the community exposes every loophole in the rule then we're lost as a community anyway. If not through loot trading, then another way.
---
It's like with addiction of any type. You can put all the external measures in place to try and stop it from happening but if the person themselves wants it and falters then they're going to find a loophole and a way around it.
---
I can't imagine they wouldn't have either server type. If they only had enough resources to do 4 servers that'd be enough for 1 PvE, PvP, RP, and RPPvP each. Given the demand, I can't imagine they'd do only 4.
---
What I hope is that the RP community is able to dominate the RP servers and hold each other to characterization throughout the world.
---
There is no information to suggest that tokens increase the amount of the player base who purchase gold and gold farmers have a net negative impact on the ingame economy and value of goods. The token isn't perfect but it is the best alternative we have to gold farmers. The token itself likely doesn't increase the amount of players who are purchasing gold.
---
I distinctly remember seeing my cousin play vanilla for the first time and as he entered stormwind he stopped at the bridge and waited as everything loaded in. I asked him what he was doing, he replied ," if i go any further my game will crash, i have to wait here for awhile to let my pc catch up with all the information trying to be sent to my game by entering stormwind." instead of saying wow shit game OMEGALUL. I instantly begged my mom to get me this amazing game that had all of these random people playing together all the time. Knowing if i put in a little effort and patience id be able to enter the city of stormwind and ironforge to partake in amazing things and if i did not choose to, could still explore a massive beautiful world uninterrupted solo. So yeah if it's even a fraction better than back in the day ill personally be satisfied. 
---
My girlfriend's boyfriend got me hooked. I actually started before then on a free trial at a gaming center in vanilla but only got to like level 8.
---
I truly started about 5 months, around 7th grade after bc was released on one of his accounts. I would pay for the time to play on this account since he really wanted to play a maxed shaman. I had absolutely no idea what the fuck I was doing lol. 
---
He ended up giving me some pointers and letting me play on two different accounts which had maxed characters. I ended up sampling the end game of rogues and some others, but I really ended up missing that shaman.
---
So at around level 30, after doing endless grey quests and stomping on lowbie NPCs without much progression until I was asked wtf I was doing lol. I ended up moving on to do some quests of my level and hung around stv forever lol. 
---
That's what gave me that real experience, I was introduced to world pvp considering it was a pvp server. After endless ganks I decided it was best to just camp at dungeons with a few players I made friends with.
---
I actually used the other accounts with max levels to help boost a friend I made. This was when in game voice was introduced. That feature was amazing, I met so many people and had way too many laughs. Anyways I ended up "wasting" a lot of time because I'd always find new gear and swords were cool. So I ended up spending time on alts mainly a rogue because my friends rogue was super cool, and of course, shamans can't use swords.
---
After farming rares on the max account and trading them in windowed mode I'd start dreaming of all those ctrl-clicks. It left me craving for better gear. I ended up getting to 69 on the shaman only to earn some purples to impress my girlfriend's boyfriend, he hops on to steal that last thousand or so exp to ding to 70. Stolen right out of under my nose lol.
---
Either way that's what made me love wow, I'm terrible at typing on a phone so I had to leave out a large portion of what happened. Like getting my friends in school hooked. Joking and learning about mods. The endless all nighters into the next school day. The list goes on and on, but it's mainly because I've always wanted to recapture that moment. 
---
It’s antithetical to vanilla and classic. Yes people bought gold but it was against the rules and not sanctioned. 
---
Some vanity shop items I wouldn’t care if they were in classic. Things like name/race/faction change or buying gold via the token don’t have a place in classic.
---
Classic and Live are going to share a sub, so you're paying for a sub to the Live game and getting Classic bundled with it.
---
Oh funny how the class changes would be so different, It is well known that in a vacuum an AOE farming mage would have the least /played up to 60, but in a server first you really cant compete with the versitility of a good hunter or lock which can pull multiple mobs and also have a lot of utility.
---
If you search some on the subreddit you can find decent builds for that. You can either do a 30-21 build to be a good healer/prot dungeon tank, or if youre more tanking inclined then you can go something like this: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxuzZVGzIczvoV
---
   
---
You can do whatever you want during the 60 dungeons phase, but raidcomp/leaders will ultimately decide which path you take
---
Oh I see, you mean through the Troll district. I thought you meant the entrance to Azshara that was added in Cata. Cool; thank you!
---
&gt; The thought of healing this creature absolutely terrified me, especially after seeing that he wasn’t grossly overgeared for the dungeon.
---
I love the way this is written.
---
&gt; As a pala, I want to be able to tank
---
You can do it, but you need a group that's aware of your limitations. Threat meters are a must, as is the ability of DPS to not go full HAM all the time.
---
Very false. Keep your illusions in check.
---
Altavista was considered the best SE before Google, m8
---
As healer, I wouldn't turn down a paladin of shaman tank in 5 mans. I'd just expect it to be a little more rough, is all. I'd want them to be an extra level or two higher than usual, I'd expect dps to have to give them time to build aggro before starting dps, I'd expect to have to pre-HoT more, I'd be ready to swap to bear form when I pull aggro off them with my heals, I'd expect a few wipes, I'd be ready to swap to my tanking set for specific bosses they had trouble with, etc.
---
Not a big deal in my opinion.
---
I'm not sure if this is what you mean, but mob tagging in actual vanilla didn't work the way it does on private servers.
---
In order for the tagger to receive full xp for a mob, the person killing said mob needed to be within a level range that would also receive xp for that mob. If the mob was grey to them, the player who tagged it would receive partial xp based on damage they had done.
---
&gt; Shaman don't have enough of any of those.
---
Shaman can use shields + one handers.  
---
There is a totem for damage mitigation, but as a non-shaman player, I can't speak to it's effectiveness in a lvl 60 5-man.  
---
Rockbiter weapon generates additional threat.
---
Earth Shock isn't a direct taunt, but is very high threat and works well as a ranged taunt.
---
Shaman are much more viable for non-warrior tanking than paladins.
---
The early private servers were full of bugs and quests that didn't work properly or at all, so, toxic. And the later servers had about 10K people playing on one server, so the trade and general chats are shitshows, so, toxic. I don't think it's anybody's fault.
---
This is Brill Tavern RP erasure
---
No flying mounts. I can't fucking wait. :)
---
Have seen multiple Shaman tanks in dungeons, they are actually pretty decent if done by someone with a brain. Don't talk shit about something you know nothing about.
---
How did this quest generally get done? I imagine slow gathering of a PuG? I didn't know there were just random world raid quests until now.
---
Nah, that makes perfect sense. It'll never get past Blizzard's crack team of experts.  
---
What? I played resto druid from vanilla through cata. I went to undocumented servers and boom no normal rez. Didn’t bother me a bit. 
---
&gt;Yep, cuz Blizzard's never changed it's mind before. Can't think of a single example...
---
Depends on your class - as a warrior dungeon xp is pretty good compared to questing, especially if you’re a good tank with a good group that can clear fast.
---
True haven't thought about that.
---
Okay I look into it. I thought I just get Rank 10 gear. I'm pretty knowledgeable about PVE, but this will be the first time I will dive deeper into PvP.
---
Priest was more fun, in my opinion. But neither of these are classes I played a whole lot of.
---
Since you have it narrowed down to two, I suggest you make both of them once Classic arrives. Play them both, taking turns with rested experience. Within a couple weeks you'll probably find you like one more than the other Play that one, and the other becomes an alt.
---
Great question im also curious from the information I've gathered over the past few weeks. Hunter seems to be the safest bet and what i personally will be rolling. They scale great with r10 and if you dare to join me and many others endeavoring r13 you will not be disappointed, as grand marshal is BiS/ or comparable from my knowledge until Naxx. So ya grind R13 do a bit of MC for the bow and sit back for 70% of the expansion like a fucking PIMP, rofl. I know, its not that easy.
---
So dumb lol
---
I would like to see that addon, but I doubt the GMs'll do anything about it, and the community won't be able to either because the reports of abuse will be so common that people'll just tune it out eventually. Save money by refusing to loot transfer, not complicated. I wasn't even aware the GMs were willing to do this back in the day anyways, played til the game became child's play without complaints.
---
Thats honestly pretty good idea in general but im how u say a one toon kinda guy so i only probl gona play one toon + a mail/ah alt and once the classic has cycled all available content i recon they will start adding "fresh" servers so im gona make alts on those. Or mains if u will.
---
Raids need lots of shamans. pick shaman if you dig buffing people and enjoy a unique toolkit
---
It would be a huge deal
---
&gt;Why did you start playing WoW?
---
I was a huge fan of most of Blizzard's games up to that point. Orcs vs Humans, Warcraft 2, Diablo, Starcraft...but then Diablo 2 was released, and it just didn't do it for me. D1 was a dungeon crawler, and D2 was a heart-hearted hybrid RPG. And then Warcraft 3 was released and I thought it was awful. Warcraft 2 was an RTS. Warcraft 3 seemed like it was made bythe people who were too dumb to play Stacraft, and who just liked the horrible "hero" missions where you took Kerrigan or whomever and mindlessly mopped up the map without the resource management or construction parts of the game.
---
The problem to me, seemed that Blizzard was trying too hard to "mix" genres and was failing. So when they announced that they were going to make an MMO, my first reaction was that it was going to be terrible for the same reasons I disliked D2 and Warcaft 3.
---
Eventually I decided to try it.
---
I liked it.
---
So basically I'm going to aim for a Feral/Cat Set and a full Healing Set and just ignore Rank 10.
---
I honestly looked at that spreadsheet and only thought about PvE. Lmao
---
Well I plan on going to PvP in Battlegrounds. So I will be a pocket Healer, but with the option to also play 1vs1? I think that sounds absolutely perfect.
---
ele shams can 2 shot people with 2 lightning crits (Nature's swiftness). I hear it's very satisfying
---
You made a typo in the word "level"
---
Well put. I hadn't thought of that. That sort of thing happened in the early dungeons quite a bit. Stopped being much of an issue passed level 30 or so, as far as I can tell. Downside would be, always being suspicious when running a dungeon with two or more people from the same guild.  :(
---
Running with a druid is a great idea you guys can switch between tank and healer as needed. In my very limited experience as a shaman tank, I've been running with warriors who didn't want to tank. I've convinced the group by saying if I can't do it, the warrior will slap on the shield and take over. Never had to have it happen on trash, just a couple times on final bosses.
---
It was hard, took at least a ten-person raid, was usually done with substantial guild help. 
---
is*
---
woah ok, if I knew you were going to get so uptight about this I wouldn't have commented at all lol, enjoy the new year dude, I'm sorry for being a twat &lt;3
---
Ohhh well 10 is more manageable than 40, at least. I just assumed it was recommended to have a full 40 people for it with a quest marked "raid." Seems like it'd be epic nonetheless. Is there a Horde counterpart raid quest?
---
His world record run is made on a fresh server, that is why he never see any other player out in the world, he is far ahead.
---
Yes, the horde version is different and requires killing the scarlet courier in the end. Also a raid quest, but not as hard as nathanos. 
---
Priest is generally more fun in PvP 
---
I love how you changed the dudes name to a language. great video! 
---
It's not pessimism, it's realism. They've shown where their priorities lie many times. The most likely occurrence is that Classic is hampered by the cost-saving setup used by retail. There's no evidence to suggest they won't use that, and evidence to suggest that they will.
---
Optimism is fine and good, until you start pretending that your hopes are more likely than reality. Then you're simply delusional.
---
So cool. Every day I come on here and find more shit in Classic to be excited for. I started off thinking "I want to rush to 60 and heal as a pally in raids to the end." Now I'm super excited to level all over the world and do leveling dungeons, experience the old quest chains (e.g. Missing Diplomat), raid of course, rank to 10 in BGs, try tanking 5 mans, participate in faction raids, and as of today, I'm excited for these endgame quests!
---
&gt;My guess is that they knew there would be backlash at Blizzcon, but it wouldn't hurt sales of the game considering it was made with the Chinese market in mind.
---
And that's not indicative of how much contempt they have for their core fanbase? They announce a mobile game aimed at the chinese market during a western PC gaming conference and you don't think that suggests a significant disconnect?
---
sandstorm
---
&gt;Not allow any ticket about loot mistakes, while advertising this on the loading screen tips.
---
This solution is acceptable to me.
---
&gt;For a distributed loot through master loot : Create a pop-up window from the RECEIVER which confirms he accepts to receive the loot that is given to him.
---
I suppose this is also acceptable, but I don't think it actually solves the problem. The primary complaint I see about loot trading isn't that people "accidentally" click, but that people will game the system by needing on things to give to friends. Plus, if people are going to 'accidentally" need they're probably going to "accidentally" accept. It's just an extra layer of nuisance for everybody.
---
That said, I think this issue is not a particularly important one. I suspect that there will be more simple outright ninjas than people conspiring together to trade look to their friends.
---
Working as intended
---
It just showed up. I was confused with all of the kickstarter updates too. But if you're US it should be all good
---
&gt;I’d like to play a class that does fairly well with gear attainable from dungeons and PvP.
---
Keep in mind that as of last we heard from Blizzard, the plan is that pvp rewards will be part of progressive content that won't be in the game on release. 
---
Oh that was kb/s, not kB/s, half a meg """broadband""" was still pretty common back then in Finland at least and on a bad day that meant 42kB/s.
---
Yeah depends on how many ppl willing to farm gold for token. I have a feeling, that here in the EU servers we will easily get 15-20% percent of the population that rather farm than spend 13€ for the subscription... 
---
If I have to guess regular consumables will be doubled in price and rare BOE twink and high end stuff will be bumped to token level prices.
---
I see in another post, you mentioned, that ppl either buy chinese farmer gold or the token... You couldn't be more wrong. Only a couple of idiot will risk their account, but if its legal, there are a tone of ppl wo can easily afford 1-2 token, or even 10.
---
I am happy to inform you that shmn tank can do raids. You just need the proper guild/gear.
---
Source?
---
Lets face it, there isn't much demand for RP servers. I can't see why they wouldn't have at least 1 per region though.
---
Shadow suffers mainly from mana problems and the debuff slot limit. Ferals main problem are the items. TBC introduced those staves with attack power in feral forms, which helped a lot. Other problem as bear tank is the lack of defensive cooldowns, barksin is caster form only
---
&gt;I actually had a Shaman tank LBRS 5 man last night. It went **shockingly** well.
---
\*groans\*
---
The OP is wrong unless he has clear sources where it states that it doesn't work when you click need. And it wouldn't make sense. Probably many errors back then happened where someone basically did "oups, I needed, sorry".
---
Fuck that, I never want to play a private server again.
---
My 2005/2006 nostalgia's been replaced by 2015/2016 nostalgia. Guess that speaks to how good this game is.
---
Priest offers superior overall healing in pve and is really good as shadow in pvp.
---
Shamans are great geoup healers, always drop wf totem for your melees. Elemental is fun in pvp, and enhancement kann be fun in pvp too.
---
I always loved the enchanted forest theme.
---
AM Horde, But alliance is much easier to RP and it can very immersive because it has this "rl medieval" or "tolkien" theme you can build around.
---
Damn, you're right. If the OP was even born when WoW was released, I'd be shocked.
---
Feral AP weapons exist in vanilla, they're from the harder content though.

Builds that aren't "good" are very fun for a certain kind of player.
---
In Diablo 2, I loved making weird builds like the melee sorceress. You'd have to put together a shopping list before rolling, and gradually work up to the point where you have those key items that are necessary to make it work. I found I could take a certain pride in these kinds of builds that I never found in the cookie cutter builds. Most importantly, these weird specs added an entire _dimension_ of replay value to D2.
---
The hybrid DPS specs in Vanilla are great examples of this kind of build, where the deck is stacked against you. They can be a fun project for players in guilds that have much of the end game content on farm, as suddenly you can start doing more casual clears of earlier raids to gear up alts. Likewise, for those of us who are gluttons of punishment, we can actually main a meme spec out of the gate, and figure out how to make our way in the end game.
---
Honestly, these specs are a lot of fun exactly as is. They're just not fun for competitive min/maxers.
---
Naxx items that 99% of the players wont ever see though. Early on you are stuck with some big 2hd that gives some stats
---
This new version of Nathanos makes him look like a *slightly* healthier Benjen Stark.
---
If you want vanilla systems/mechanics but with all specs viable just look at TBC because that's exactly what it is. Pretty much all of them have multiple fundamental issues, just adding a few more bits of gear or adding 1 skill won't do it.
---
Yeah lol. Never ran it as anything less then a 40 man. But there was always that small % that fucked everyone lol
---
Hi, /u/wotanson66
---
modern day blizzard has a 0% chance of pulling it off
---
Yeah I really liked TBC. Felt like everything was playable and itemization was still unique enough that content didn’t go stale. 
---
Vanilla was a bit of a slog for me. 
---
Only two of those are from Naxx. Other two are from Four Dragons, and AQ40.
---
I also missed the AQ20 one http://classicdb.ch/?item=21407
---
There were plenty of negative posts in the days too. 
---
A lot of it had to do with class imbalances and how the hectic patch cycle created unpredictability, many felt left out of top level raids and found it too hard to get gear. Plus the usual server issues of course.
---
All of it understandable but honestly I thought vanilla would only be the first step towards something greater for the genre. My 2005 self would be gutted to learn MMOs would by and large go downhill from there.
---
20 + X = 30
---
Sadly Blizzard doesn’t have modern servers, what they use can’t handle a 20 v 20 in Dazalazor or Boralus. 
---
RPPvP if an option will prob be what I do. Power to the Forsaken
---
Even with unlimited mana, shadow has way shorter range than other casters and terrible +dmg scaling on all its spells so it would still be terrible in the end game.
---
Oh for sure I know.  I remember people saying wotlk was the worst expansion and the death of wow when it was current.  I’m just saying this video doesn’t really help his point considering most of these posts are extremely cherry picked and most of them are just jokes.  Like people complaining about gnomes and chuck norris jokes.  Not sure what this has to do with what’s going on in BfA because it is for SURE way worse right now in terms of customer dissatisfaction 
---
I'm someone who adores "underdog" specs. I played a bear druid in Vanilla and minmaxed to the best of my ability, and as a result I got raid tanking spots back in a time when the spec was supposed to be garbage.
---
Vanilla is not balanced across the specs, and whilst that's definitely not an ideal status, it's unfortunately how it was. The underdog specs have to work a lot harder to perform, but the satisfaction that comes from succeeding or at least surprising people is part of the fun.
---
I see bear tanks, kitty/moonkin dps, prot/ret paladins and dps shamans as being fun specs that have niches, but they're specs that you have to go into knowing it'll be an endless uphill struggle and you'll need to work three times as hard as a primary spec to be half as viable. 
---
But to a lot of people, that kind of challenge is part of the fun of the spec. Nothing made me prouder in Vanilla than when my MC group got its first kill of Ragnaros... with me as the main bear tank. I'd proven by my devotion to the spec, my endless grinding of the most minmaxy of minmax gear available to me at the time, that my raid group trusted me to do the best I could and it paid off. 
---
Obviously this wont be possible for some specs (protadin is my next target but even I only expect to be primarily tanking aoe trash before swapping to healing, due to the way the spec is just unsuited to big boss tanking), but i think the concept that "all specs must be balanced" was actually a detriment to a degree. 
---
So those undead archers in the BfA cinematic don’t count for some reason? Oook.
---
That’s how loot trading works, the source is world of Warcraft.
---
A source of what?
---
I remember when I completed the quest we didn't know any better so we came prepared with virtually a full raid.
---
Memory is fuzzier on this part but I don't think it was a cakewalk either, probably died during the fight like a noob.
---
😂😂
---
Sounds exactly like the remastered CoD 4 packaged into Infinite Warfare.
---
Can’t I just pay for classic? Guess not
---
Shame
---
Come on man. I have really been trying to find this information dont troll. :(
---
This depends on the dungeon and what you do there. Full clear BRD, or straight Emperor run BRD are two very different shoes. Same for Maraudon (Princess run? Full clear? Only orange/only purple wing?) Some Vanilla dungeons don't take that much time (with a competent group), like the Scarlet Monastery ones.
---
I would play hunter, but I just played one on Nostalrius and if I’m honest I didn’t love it. It was fun, and there sure are a lot of mechanics that make it easy and fast but by the time I got to level 60 and finished MC I had class envy for just about everyone haha
---
This "people were bad than" narrative is such bullshit. Vanilla ran for years. People knew how to play their classes. The classes had vastly different toolkits, and were overall weaker. No AoE tanking and threat actually mattering are game changers on their own.
---
The only change i see for offspecs are lower mana spell costs.  
---
I'm in the same boat as you and only play one class for a couple year chunks at a time.  Druid is my choice because if I don't like one aspect, I am able to respec, pick up some gear, and play a completely different way.
---
With that in mind, I'd suggest really thinking about what you want to accomplish.  Do you want to run your warrior friend through SM for his Herods Shoulders?  That's a realistic goal to achieve for a Shaman.  Do you find the peak of PvP excitement to be watching your enemy slowly and inevitably die from dots while your health ticks back up to full and there's nothing they can do about it muhahaha?!!  Then you'll probably click with a Priest more.
---
Just make a list of what nuances you love and see which class has more of them, or does a better job at them.  Explore the class fantasy.  Shaman can bring themselves back from the dead, and Priests can control the minds of their enemies.  One of these unique traits is going to resonate with you.
---
They're not "services". When Blizzard still had control of the game, they nixed it, and for good reason: servers need to be self-sufficient and self-correcting. 
---
Wanna justify the use of glider, too? Why not have it so someone else levels your account? No? Then why not heirlooms?
---
All of it is why wow devolved into what it is today. 
---
The gold from the token come from a player, they aren't generated by the system! The amount of golds in the mage doesn't change!
---
And, btw, the gold sellers will be a huge problem without token, and people will still buy golds, so the "balance" you still call in cause will be always shattered.
---
Moreover, the gold farmers bring more account security issues. And I'm not speaking for the customer, but for everyone. Did you ever login to find yourself naked without gold? That's.
---
I get where you're coming from but I don't think you need to worry. At the very least, they would have one server of each type (pve, pvp, rp-pve, rp-pvp) and most likely many more
---
It's not entirely just that. Shadow can do decent damage but their threat can easily pull off the tank. Mind blast does a stupid amount of threat so they can only pepper it in or they risk dying (and maybe killing others). You can say the same about enhancement and elemental, when they happen to do good damage, they have to stop for a bit or risk ripping the mob off the tank. I remember doing onyxia and getting back to back windfury crits and doing competitive dps, only to have the tank warn me my threat is stupid high and one more (un)lucky windfury will kill me and cause the boss to turn and whip the rest of the raid into whelps.
---
What's spell batching? The old macro system? Sounds important, maybe someone should make a thread about it.
---
One side of strath takes 1hr15min.  Scholo takes 1hr30.  Brd can range from 30min to 3hrs.  Dire maul takes from 30min to 1.5hrs to complete a wing.  And factor in 30 min for group forming and travel time.  
---
Bread and water stacked to 20...........
---
What if the boss doesnt die in 20sec by an overgeared raid and you can't spam shapeshift....
---
Some people who rp also like playing good games, and being able to experience those good games on their rp characters
---
We just don’t know. If it’s the same as vanilla you can power level people really quickly by have them tag stuff and then get other people to kill it. The exp system might be from the legion client though to prevent this (with vanilla values). If you’re in the same group as a 60 it becomes completely pointless so I doubt anyone’s recorded those values. Would be pretty easy to check on a PS though if you really cared.
---
&gt; Shaman can use shields + one handers.
---
&gt; There is a totem for damage mitigation, but as a non-shaman player, I can't speak to it's effectiveness in a lvl 60 5-man.
---
&gt; Rockbiter weapon generates additional threat with each hit.
---
&gt; Earth Shock isn't a direct taunt, but is very high threat and works well as a ranged taunt.
---
&gt; Shaman are much more viable for non-warrior tanking than paladins IMO, but maybe I've just never seen a very good pally tank outside of Undead Strat.
---
Nice. Mind you, I'm not trying to crap on the idea of shammy tanking. 
---
During TBC, we ran Horseman holiday event with a rogue as tank. He had his agility (and dodge) maxed. It worked, but it was also due to his pocket healer he brought with him, who was raid geared.
---
The great thing about wow is it's a numbers game, like most games in its field. The numbers have got to balance out, for this and that. And the devs had to take into account all the variables and loopholes players could find in order to min-max themselves.
---
I remember reading Ghostcrawler talking about shammies getting nerfed back when they could tank. I'm not sure if mentioned stat priority on mail gear, but it might have been discussed. That, or shaman being plate wearers, but changed to mail...? It's been a while since I read it. It wasn't something the devs thought the game needed: yet another do-all, but not quite well, hybrid.
---
Haha I played on thorium brotherhood, I remember Bloodrite. I was in a guild called reckless ascension. I remember we raided stormwind with each other back in the day 
---
Pretty easy to fool people though, how would you even know if your friends list is trustworthy? They could've waited til you left to trade the item, or if the rules allow, traded it in town after. You'd have no clue, you'd be suspicious of other players constantly. Everything needs to be out in the open or it'll rot away at the community far more than it strengthens it.
---
A lot of it is stigma tbh. I just recently tanked Hakkar as a prot paladin. Only two people died because the warrior used intimidating shout and feared everyone before the sheep because I wasn't expecting it and used my bubble to stop the mc and continue to build threat early. We used a bear tank normally so I wasn't prepared to how a warrior could cause problems. Now that I know, I'll just save my "get out of anything" card for future fears. After that little incident, Hakkar only swapped between me and the warrior. Paladins and bears can do the content, the people are the problem.
---
Also, only grouping with people you trust shows how much power this rule has to make everyone suspicious of the community around them. An ugly, ugly rule change.
---
That’s funny because I just took a peak at GD and  80% were way worse than this video go look if you want
---
That's what I had here in Sweden.
---
&gt;i.e. Level 60 and Level 10 are in group. Level 60 kills level 57. How much xp does level 10 get.
---
If the 60 kills a 57 mob solo, it gets 280 xp
---
If the 60 groups up with a 10, the base XP is split 240 / 40 --- and then the group penalty is put into effect, so 120xp / 20xp
---
**The level 10 character will get 20xp from that kill.**
---
Sauce:
---
Math assuming everyone in the group is the same level
---
XP = MXP/numberOfMembers * modifier.
---
Modifiers:
---
1 person group = 1.0
---
2 person group = 1.0
---
3 person group = 1.166
---
4 person group = 1.3
---
5 person group = 1.4
---
In a group of two characters, the total experience awarded for the mob is calculated using the solo XP formula and the level of the higher character. The experience is always divided between the two characters in the same ratio, regardless of how much damage was caused by each. The ratio for each character is determined by the formula:
---
CL1 = Character 1 Level, assumed to be the higher level character
---
CL2 = Character 2 Level
---
MXP = Solo Mob Experience, as calculated above for CL1 (60 vs 57 grants 280xp)
---
XP1 = MXP * CL1 / (CL1 + CL2),   the experience awarded to character 1
---
XP2 = MXP * CL2 / (CL1 + CL2),   the experience awarded to character 2
---
XP for 60 = 280 * 60 / (60 + 10) --- divided by 2 cause grouped 
---
XP for 40 = 280 * 10 / (60 + 10) --- divided by 2 cause grouped
---
GMs "not handling loot accidents" does affect gameplay. 
---
Plus rp addons have come a long long way now.
---
Small groups of people managed to do it essentially perfect while working for free. It really ought to make investors wonder...
---
What? You mean the source is for example how loot trading is applied in BfA? I don't know BfA but literally no one has mentioned this before, and many people of this sub seem to have played BfA.
---
&gt;Loot Trading will be introduced to Classic, allowing players to trade Bind on Pickup items to other players who participated in the same kill for up to 2 hours after the loot dropped, and assuming the item was not equipped.
---
This is literally Blizzard's words. No words on need and greed. There is no way to know but it may be different than what's applied in BfA don't you think?
---
Honestly, not talking about raids here obviously, but if an object is not tradeable when it is won with "need", then it won't solve any of the GM tickets associated with that situation, but **it will encourage people to ninja more than before because now you can sell it to other group members for a lot more gold than for a NPC**. Which is probably meaningless in BfA since you loot good gear all the time, but will matter in Classic where 1) loots were rare, and 2) dungeons were long af.
---
Within guild runs was my suggestion, but then again, inner guild conflict isn't much fun either.
---
&gt; Builds that aren't "good" are very fun for a certain kind of player.
---
You aren't answering OP's question. They didn't ask for your apologia for broken specs existing. They wanted to know if there were viable ways to fix the issues.
---
The short answer is yes there are viable ways and TBC proved it.
---
However there's usually not one single thing that can be changed that will fix everything. If there was Blizzard would have done it back in 2006.
---
And how do you plan on trading that gold?
---
Check out the "Stat Values" tab of [Taladril's Druid Gear Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wGBasFY8fFGpBtiD1TAUBB99wxboCSVh5MW_6b_z0oU/pubhtml#). He put 1 hit as being worth 15 attack power and while I can't personally confirm his stat weights are correct he's about as reliable a source as you could possibly get.
---
so. much. rage.       
---
&gt;"Do you want to turn on sticky keys?"      
---
       
---
No, I do not want sticky keys.  I never want to be offered the option for it again.  I never want it to be turned on accidentally ever.   In fact, wait here while I get a linux iso and install right over top of you...  
---
I was so jealous of Swedes because you had those bbb 10M internetz.
---
You're right. Shitting on Blizzard belongs in a different sub.
---
You heard the man. Move it along people.
---
coward
---
Yea that would be nice.
---
OHHHHHHHHHH "divided by 2 cause grouped" I was not doing this math. Thank you very much!!!!!
---
I see a lot of uneducated and badly sourced comments here in general. Positive and negative. 
---
There’s obviously a ton of people who post here who have not watched the Blizzcon panel still. 
---
Specifically in regard to their comments on sharping (which is stupid to fight about imo). But also there’s a bunch of other stuff which people would rather speculate on for hours instead of spending 60 seconds on google. 
---
They just haven't rented the upgraded plan from whatever cloud service provider they use for shards
---
I still had a Nokia similar to that phone around 2005.  It's retired, but doubtless still working if I could find it.  You could hammer nails with those things.
---
Who tf still had dialup when WoW was released? I was late af to the broadband party and even then I had broadband in 2004.
---
Sooo that’s what became of him? Always wondered where he went without realizing that he is in fact the red eyed quest guy from ”Boring wow aka retail” expansion/expansions lmao.
---
I tanked all 5 mans, UBRS and ZG many, many, MANY times back then. No 40 raid in Vanilla of course. Were other players playing with me suffering? I don't think so, because it went well, I did friends that way, and the guild mates doing ZG with me were very happy to do so because it went well and there was a good atmosphere.
---
&gt;And this is on private servers! Which are notorious for having patient, experienced players who know what they're getting into.
---
You made my day with this one. There are 2 types of people in this sub :
---
1) People that are chill and fine whatever the spec they play with (specially when we are talking about everything but 40 raids)
---
2) Terrible and toxic people that do all they can do to shut down offspecs, and everything not elitist 100% hyperoptimal minmax shit. Because the only reasons we'll be playing Classic is to be 1st of servers right? And from memory of their comments it was obvious they were from private servers.
---
&gt;The backlash against memespecs is going to be real. 
---
And somehow, I know in what side you belong. And you are wrong, because not every people in Classic will think like you do in pservers.
---
I'm gonna to every possible Darnassus quest to get that saber mount ASAP on my gnome.
---
Blizzard absolutely have the hardware power for this and way more. lag with 20 vs 20 fights on retail is because of the way they have configurated their sharding. If you think a company like Blizzard lacks modern technology you really do not know what you are talking about. Now, whether their decision to configurate the way they do is a whole other issue, one I think we have very like minded opinions on.
---
The value of hit and crit go up with the amount of AP you have.
---
It is relative, you will need to work out how much AP and Crit you will have before working out how much hit is worth.
---
Think of it this way. Getting 10dmg with no chance of critting is worth less than getting 10dmg while already having a 25% chance to crit.
---
I want to roleplay on classic because classic is the game I want to play, not BFA. You're right about the tools available to players on BFA, and certain illegal servers I've played on have had even more extensive tools. But, again, classic is the game I want to play, not BFA, so I'll be roleplaying in classic. Roleplay is about the people you're playing with. The platform is important, but even with toys and cosplay and throw-away characters, the bulk of roleplay is always text. 
---
Agreed, they haven't messed up classic, hopefully they won't ever. Giving voice to our fears is one thing but let's not let is spiral down.
---
For a retail RPer, the WoW Classic server version of RP will be like you visiting the midevil fair.  It's in a different time period, different people are important, certain things don't exist, and factions have changed a lot over the years.  
---
Early factions went from being a ragtag bunch of misfits or brothers in arms trying to carve a place in an alien world or in defense of their birth rights to land... to whatever retail is - saviours of the plant or something, I have no idea.  So people want to go back and it is absolutely a different experience.  PvP and Raiding aren't the only things that have changed, so PvP and PvE shouldn't be the only servers available.
---
I doubt they actually do. They have an expansion focused on alliance vs horde and the second we get 2 raids in one shard it falls apart. Hell it falls apart the second people start showing up for incursions. They probably cost cutted and haven’t upgraded their servers since the WoD release.
---
Blizzard has always been a profit-driven company. The only thing that slowly changed over the years was the philosophy as to how profit could or should be achieved. 
---
Thank you for this post.
---
I'm already not happy with sharding at launch (yeah yeah a lot of people, whatever, it doesn't belong in classic period, and they haven't told us how long it will be there for), loot trading promotes unfair trading practices and doesn't fix the problem and it wasn't in classic so it shouldn't be there, and right click player reporting which can lead to mobs reporting people for no reason and exploitation.  So far it seems to me they're trying to automate and make things easier for themselves to save money on servers and GMs.  I've lowered my expectations.  
---
But we need to talk about sharding every 4 hours otherwise Blizzard may think we want it!!! 
---
Okay. Nice points and all, but you made a fatal mistake by not taking one thing into consideration.
---
People like the simple theme that Classic's lore has. It's like WC3, but a bit expanded. They like not having to deal with annual worldwide threats. The world is simple, yet so large. The basis for the game's story allows for some amazing RP. You can roleplay things like the Scarlet Crusade or a group of sentinels in Ashenvale without feeling 'irrelevant' to the game because of how useless 1-60 zones are nowadays.
---
Some people just like the simplicity of it. RP -works- on imagination. It doesn't need immersive facetracking to work even though it's a good feature.
---
hmm interesting was this your feeling for the class in pvp as well? I know in the case of pve most other classes have it better due to us being used for tranq shot and being a nightfall wielder which is arguably as boring as the frostbolt mage. I'll be focusing pvp as well and did not play hunter max level in vanilla so itd be nice to know why you felt that way. I have it in my head currently with Rhok'delar and Field Marshal's Pursuit most classes will envy the hunter and its safe to assume you wont be the nightfall bitch at that point.
---
That's not how the internet works
---
Okay
---
That one youtube kid "Alexsesu.." or whatever his name is, is going hard at this angle right now. He has a lot of viewers still so I imagine he's leading this charge.
---
I personally think it's very possible that Blizz downsized on GMs because it'd be cheaper to have fewer for now, and rehire some new ones come Classic because they can avoid spending resources on retraining the current GMs for Classic. Not to mention what a waste it would be keeping them on right now while subscription numbers are so low. (and may never climb back up...)
---
That being said, I believe I heard (from this subreddit so the source isn't reliable) that a few particular changes are already "confirmed" so this alone is enough to be pissed off. Minds might still change though if there's enough outcry.
---
What's wrong with voicing our criticism? We can only gain from doing so, being loud and voicing our opinion has proved over centuries as a way to get demands.
---
The problem is there's not really anything to talk about in this subreddit because there's barely a trickle of news from blizzard, not to mention classic wow is a "solved" game.  It's old and everything has been theory crafted already.
---
And no, this criticism and news belongs here, not in r/wow. This is specifically pertaining to classic wow and wouldn't fit in other subreddits.
---
No one is trying to kill hype, literally everyone wants it to succeed.  We are trying to make sure the product lives up to the standards of vanilla.
---
i'd be sceptical about static stat weights that's for sure.
---
The day memes died...
---
I didn't explain it well.
---
Player 1 trades player 2 1000g on X server.
---
Player 2 trades player 1 1000g on Y server.
---
Honestly, I just didn't like the entire playstyle in PvP. Some huge numbers that could be entertaining, but it just wasnt for me. I enjoyed them more in PvE.
---
 I don't know if you've played one back then, but the mechanics of it just didnt feel fluid to me. That may have been a function of it being on Nostalrius, but I don't really think so.
---
The GD is talking how awesome garrison were 
---
1) it’s for casual mode 
---
2) Mythic Dungeons and Normal + raids do not have this . 
---
I recall this not working in vanilla but it worked on pservers 
---
Did you take into consideration that gold can't be traded across servers?
---
Nope, as customers we have the right to praise the game when it is really good (Vanilla to MoP) and criticize it when it is awful (WoD and BfA). 
---
Ah CRT monitor, but I was one of them who liked it because of its 100/120hz. 
---
The gold isn't changing servers.
---
Oh wow, I've had Taladril's Sheets bookmarked but hadn't noticed the stat sheet before. Thank you!
---
Moonkin Form:
---
In addition to the regular effect, your Moonfire, Wrath and Starfire cost 15% less mana, and if you gain the Innervate effect if you Innervate another raid member.
---
Enh Shaman:
---
Stormstrike is now a buff for the player, so it doesn't piss away debuff slots. Casting Stormstrike reduces the next spell cast mana cost by 75%.
---
Shadow Priest:
---
When in Shadow Form, Fade returns 10% of your maximum mana.
---
Oh no, don't get me wrong, I think there is a disconnect. I was only arguing the idea that they did see the backlash coming but didn't care as they'd still be cashing in regardless. And that the situation is different compared to Classic as it's in their best interest financially to appeal to Classics target audience.
---
So then whats the point? Why would I want some fresh level 1 character to have a bunch of gold on a different server instead of just on the server I'm already on with my main?
---
the problem is they given us a reason to. over the course of 10+ years. community out cry for specific things that improve QoL and Blizzard actively does the complete opposite almost in spite leaving countless people and a million threads whining about it. Honestly, you can't give Blizzard an inch and they'll turn it into a mile. Being very vocal that people want classic as it was is very very important.
---
I don’t get why criticizing blizzard for something they did is wrong. But I do get why in the classic sub it makes less sense since we have no real info and a lot of it is prospective. Overall tho I highly support constructive criticism. 
---
So content 95% won't see. I don't see why AP Druid items, or idols, couldn't have been a thing in 5mans, or even when leveling. 
---
It's how people hit 70 on the first day when TBC launched. Tag boosting was definitely around on vanilla.
---
That is entirely the point. To reroll on a new server. The context in which I brought that point up, is that people would do this before Transfers were a thing.
---
Thanks for toughts this rly got me thinking. But theres justh so much i like about both classes that i cant rly decide, altough u got me whit the muhaha abit. +1 for that.
---
Hello where you been at the last 5 years, you see what retail wow has become? What happened to the diablo franchise? activision-blizzard made it clear in which direction they want their games to go. Sure i hope they dont fuck it up and classic will be sucessul but as long as their philosophy dont change i will try other games. But hey thats just my opinion
---
So it's safe to assume at lower levels (say newly 60, working on pre-raid BIS) 34 AP is probably better to have then +1% hit. This is what I was leaning towards, but I've been having trouble finding any discussion on what the value of +hit really is. I guess it's tricky because, like you point out, it depends on your other stats. But if you have 2000+ AP then the +hit will be worth quite a bit more no doubt.
---
Sure, but it can provide a reasonable estimate. Unless you have a comprehensive calculator that allows the user to select gear, buffs, and consumables and then uses their stats to compute a DPS value and the marginal DPS value of each stat, you're not going to get any better.
---
Ain't cross-faction communication about as anti-immersion a thing possible? You can communicate with your raid/party in character while in a serious fight with some "opposing faction" savages, how is this not perfect role playing? Also, it's easy to macro in emotes and find a half second click one or two while fighting.
---
I think you're right that the weight would not be a static thing. I wonder if he is using a rough average or something similar to come up with 15. At least I would assume that is a rough but accurate starting point.
---
This right here. Both on discord and on this subreddit I notice,too, that there are just a ton of people who haven't watched a single video or even read a transcript that are commenting heavily on things that they have no idea what they're talking about.
---
Lol
---
I agree with most of what you said. There hasn't been any real information about Classic since Blizzcon, so everyone is continually harping on the big points from then (Sharding and looting). This is fine, they're big points that will make or break the game for a lot of people, but at some point it does get old hearing about them every day, almost 2 months later. 
---
As far as pertaining to this subreddit, what I was referencing was the constant news from other games and general news about the state of Blizzard. IE: Blizzard making cutbacks, BFA sucking, HoTs getting canned, Diablo mobile, ect.
---
Lastly, I think you're wrong about the hype. There are plenty of people trying to shit on Classic. It was happening way before Classic was even announced. People have strong opinions, and some of those people don't see the appeal of Classic or think that by making Classic it will take away from current WoW. A lot of people want to see Classic fail.
---
Like I said above, it's fine to voice criticism, but considering there haven't been any new developments about Classic in the past month, there probably shouldn't be nearly as many complaints voiced every day on this subreddit about theoretical problems in Classic or non-relevant issues with other Blizzard titles. 
---
I just ordered my copy from the preorder store. I received an email receipt but how do I get access to a PDF version? Can’t seem to figure it out.. any help would be super appreciated!!
---
Think you could take a second to set the record straight? What language did they use with the changes they mentioned? Are any changes being called "confirmed" yet?
---
That is of course a logical way of thinking, but the actions of Activision have shown we can't really trust their judgement for such matters. Your argument is based on Classics succes = most profit for Activision Blizzard. The problem here is that Activision might not see it like that. Their recent history kind of shows they believe more in short time games then letting them die to make room for a new product (a game release brings a "burst" of money, so more of them equals more profit).
---
Activision have simply shown that they have a different philosophy than the old Blizzard and with current events there is more Activision than Blizzard left in the company.
---
The new models are so bouncy. It’s like they are running in low gravity. Bugs me so much.
---
It doesn't matter how many options or items they give you to RP with in BFA. The game isn't fun, and that makes RPing in it not fun as well.
---
&gt; haven't told us how long it will be there for
---
They said maybe a few weeks.
---
RP requires communication. That doesn't mean talking but you have to be able to convey what you are doing.
---
I completely agree that these are big issues that should be on the Classic teams radar moving forward, but that doesn't mean we need a new post every hour for the past 2 months to reiterate it. Maybe a better way would be to have a stickied post with our collective major complaints as we get more information. The two main criticisms being Sharding and Looting. I'm not sure if that's the right solution, but it could help.
---
That could mean 2 weeks or 6 weeks.  We don't know, and that worries me.  I hate sharding as a principle and the longer it is there the worse the experience will be for socialization 
---
Depends on who you ask. Loot trading is a pretty big mechanical departure from 1.0
---
Salvation helps alot with this and the threat isn't god awful it's just not anywhere near as good single target as bears or warriors. The aoe threat however is much better then both bears and warriors esp w/ alot of targets. Dungeons are fine to tank with paladins it's raids that become the issue due to itemization and the inability to push crushing blows off the table like warriors can do with shield block ( holy shield is only 30 % increase in block chance while shield block is 75 %)
---
People reaffirming their concerns over and over is how you get change and get through.  Having one post minimizes the impact.  
---
Right. My point being the game hasn't even gone into Beta and we've only had 1 Blizzcon worth of information about it. Other than the main points from the Blizzcon panel, there isn't anything to criticize about Classic at this time.
---
Jokes on you. I didn't even own a cell phone. 
---
The pain involved when you finally load down to the tit-line and it turns out she's got something covering her chest
---
I love your little story, not only because it's great to hear how another WoW fan got into the game, but because it shows something important about Classic vs Vanilla.
---
Back when WoW launched technology simply sucked compared to now. This meant things like waiting before entering a big city or 5 FPS at a raid. Now, the question is whether this is part of the "Blizzlike experience". Blizzard certainly don't think so and is currently discussing how to somewhat avoid it. Personally I don't think it's part of the experience, but rather an annoyance that was only tolerable at the time because that was the standard at the time. 
---
It's fine if someone wants this, but I don't think you can blame Blizzard form excluding it as part of the "vanilla experience".
---
I love you both
---
This is what I mean about feeling as though people aren't RPers. Are you a RPer? Have you ever RPed? From my own experience it doesn't matter what narrative Blizzard feed you, you make your own stories independantly of the main story. Sure, there are plenty of RP guilds out there focused on the current threat, but there are plenty of people just out there doing whatever. People can and do RP Scarlet Crusade guilds to this day, same goes for Sentinel guilds. The uselessness of 1-60 zones gameplay wise has no impact on RP whatsoever.
---
We'll stop shitting on them when you stop fanboying and supporting their bullshit. 
---
They have done plenty to warrant every single bit of criticism they're getting. I've played blizzard games for 14 years, others have played even longer... 
---
The shit they've been pulling lately has been a MASSIVE kick in the nuts to anyone who has supported them for so long. 
---
I’ll make a quick comment but I’m blocking anyone who replies to me without having watched it. 
---
It’s not just about WHAT was said. 
---
The big takeaway is HOW they said it. Which is why if you are reading this and have not watched it you need to do so. Now. 
---
It was clear they were trying to establish goodwill and an open minded approach. The loot trading thing comes to mind immediately. It was clear it was still on the table to be changed and they would be receptive to positive feedback. 
---
So of course what happens? Thousands of entitled loot whores descend upon every Warcraft forum to completely destroy that goodwill by crying about this as opposed to providing constructive solutions. 
---
And yes I have seen some positive constructive feedback but damn, I know the people most interested in this game lean a little older in age but you wouldn’t know it from most of the comments on that issue. 
---
They're spelled differently based on region.  
---
The emotes are quite extensive if you've read the full list ever, I was very surprised by how deep it goes.
---
I don't really get it though, what's there to say when the other faction is a bunch of weird monsters who speak different languages and are in a constant, bitter war with you? You can communicate more directly if you use that "faction changing" trinket in Vanilla too, correct?
---
AQ20 is puggable.
---
AQ20 is ridiculously easy and accessible, it just sounds spooky because AQ40 is to lots of people. Also all of the non-healing idols are from 5 mans / LBRS. 
---
I still play Retail with my guild. I just want to try and play old lock again with my guildys and friends.
---
Was talking to my guild, I had no idea pet quests were removed, and my fellow warlocks never knew we had those.
---
I also think imma go Orc Lock instead of Forsaken this time. 
---
How so? I am not a native speaker, I was sure that "leveling" is correct my whole life
---
My bad, I thought you were talking about retail WoW 
---
Eh I’m rolling with guildys, if I chose one with a youtuber it would be Nixxiom. With a plan to sabotage him, even though I’m a big fan of his. 
---
Maybe fuck with Moocluck.
---
Though I’d totes wanna work with Nixioms warlock friend. Though he will probably be Alliance :/
---
he has a much different feel but  I still think he looks really cool
---
My comment wasn't about asking questions about how should it work, it was about explaining that it is not a "30 minutes of code" feature.
---
There is a huge amount of things that should be done and can go wrong even before the player sees the confirmation.
---
&gt; Everyone that has been around since Nostalrius never wanted this, we wanted to remain on Nostalrius with our characters.
---
Speak for yourself. I only ever played pservers because there were no official servers. The only reason I can see why anyone would rather "remain on Nostalrius with their characters" is because of exactly that, their characters. Not because they prefer a pserver to an official.
---
It's an embarrassing mechanic for blizzard to have implemented no matter what content it's for. 
---
I felt the pain of that Mage missing Frost Nova. 
---
I guarantee you, Asmongold and WoWcrendor will warp servers. Asmongold is hated enough that the server will more than likely turn into Fans vs Haters.
---
For Crendor he’s big enough on YouTube and loved that he could say “I uhhh hope X gets scarab lord.” Or “I uhh wish I could get scarab lord, but I doubt it” and suddenly boom, he or who ever he designated gets carried to scarab lord. 
---
The time when we broke into a garage knowing there where tons of magazines inside..
---
Chinese gold? 
---
Well, that's really nice to hear.
---
Gotta say though, you yourself seem to be adding to the conflict too, assuming the motives of the "no changes" crowd by disparaging them as "loot whores" when, from what I read, protecting community trust and the authentic Classic "feel" seemed to be themes that came up much more than anything else.
---
If you have low expectations you won’t be so let down when this launches like a turd 
---
And it had snake!
---
are you actually blind or did you just look at one topic?
---
The items lists are not AQ20 tho
---
I can respect that. Honestly that's as good a reason as any to want to RP in Classic. If you're already playing the game with like-minded people then why not?   
---
My post was aimed more towards people who don't have much/any experience RPing and think Classic WoW is going to be a godsend for RPers. Frankly, RPing on Classic servers is going to be much harder than RPing on BfA servers, and cross-faction RP is going to be near impossible. I just wanted to bring that to light since it seems as though the majority are misinformed about what RP is and what it typically entails.
---
Best constructive solution I read was, "Have it only be possible all the people who rolled on the item are still in the group and agree to the trade." Literally fixes every issue I can think of.
---
The best part is those people always say “Activision Blizzard” instead of blizzard. Makes me chuckle every time for some reason 
---
i can see the feeling clunky argument for sure as i think everyone knows "standard" pet AI is crap. I didnt play one back then but currently on kronos things feel fine to me. with a auto shot addon weaving things between is easier, feels fun, and quite "fluid" to me. On the pet side of things i felt the same for awhile until i got deep into macros. for example a staple macro for me is my hunters mark also commanding my pet to attack that target and use dash if i press again, then my pet will come back after the target dies unless i switch targets and use it again becuase they are put into passive. Also i make every ability i have an autotarget if in range and continue autoattack string baked into them. after getting used to all the macros and bindings of a hunter it felt really rewarding imo becuase i can now control my pet to the point its like playing two classes at the same time.
---
I am kinda mixed on "bad" items in game design. I suppose it adds to the experience that not all items are "good" or "balanced" but I can imagine a raid getting the worst item in a tier over and over again each week might be a little demotivating (like repeatedly getting shaman gear on Alliance). 
---
It sort of feels like "The Lion Horn of Stormwind" was a precursor for Azerite armor with that RNG...
---
I had forgotten that :)
---
&gt; I doubt they actually do.
---
Well, it's not really guesswork. There are information available about Blizzards servers. I can't explain why they did so with BfA, but in all honestly I don't think they made the faction war as "going back to roots of big epic pvp battles", they made it as a cool story theme but still with the same focus as Legion. *That* is just guesswork, though.
---
Most of the specs being underdogs is completely attributed to stigma. Bear tanks are fantastic, well-rounded tanks that can do better than Warriors now and then, but since there are a very select few encounters Bear tanks are horrible on people go for Warriors.
---
I'm 19, and I played with my dad up to level 20 during Vanilla. Got all the way to 70 with him in BC though
---
I never mentioned inflation once. All good comes from a player. However if you make it ok to buy that gold in classic 
---
1. you are giving blizzard positive feedback to put more micro transactions in. 
---
2. You are saying it’s ok to have the game pay to win. That’s a rabbit hole I’m not comfortable in going down. 
---
Yep gold sellers are a problem a massive problem they do bring account security issues. However I don’t really care about that at all. You can make it difficult to get into your account by using an authenticator and having a good password. Also if you loose your account because you are buying gold I care even less. 
---
Your arguments while true for the most part are invalid. 
---
You cite extra toys and lore as incentive for RP, but it can be argued the lore has gotten absolutely ridiculous and the toys can sometimes lead to.. eccentric RP'ing by people who like to get a little *too* crazy. 
---
You say our expectations are off, when many people here want to go RP-PVP to avoid assmangold and other streamers and their obnoxious fan base. They want a more mature playerbase on the server. They don't want to or expect to RP through deadmines, but maybe they want some light tavern RP in Stormwjnd or they want to just not have some douche spamming memes in /y for hours on end. And I'd say those expectations are a lot closer to par for RP servers than what you're assuming. 
---
Damn who hurt you? 
---
Thats classic WoW. What..cuz u raided this week, u r entitled to have good drops, naaah bitch ima RNG this bitch up..goosebumps just thinking of it
---
If you're looking at the quest category, I have no clue why it's wrong but it is.
---
If you're looking at the individual items everything there is from AQ20 (don't forget to check "contained in" tab). Even if I were wrong, the only things you couldn't get off the AH is the exalted rep, and the hilt. 
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Ruins_of_Ahn%27Qiraj_quest_loot
---
you can powershift for minutes lol
---
There are several, but I'll give you mine.
---
Was it in vanilla?
---
No?
---
Then no. 
---
Be useful or be a piraya
---
Because that is how the system worked. Otherwise it would have been completely useless. It introduced a 2 hour window where you could trade a soulbound item to any other player who is eligible for that item (Cata added making boe items bop on need). If it only worked on greed rolls it wouldn't fulfill the purpose it was designed as to reduce GM time on loot related issues.
---
&gt; Players will now be able to trade soulbound items with other raid or group members that were eligible for the loot. This system will work like the Item Buy Back system and allow 2 hours for players to trade an item after it has been looted. Players who choose to enchant or add gems to the item will get one last confirmation before losing the ability to trade the item.
---
That is the exact text of the system AS OF WotLK.
---
I seem to recall that Northrend had set Lupos' spawn timer to 10 minutes.   I know if you get in AV there, you are gonna see a lot-o-lupos.   He is about as rare as racism in barrens chat.      
---
    
---
I look forward to rare items actually being rare in retail classic.  Some Pservers have got janky drop rates to keep the players happy.  I do not want to see 3 Pendulums of Doom on the AH every time I look, or shadowfang being 30g.  
---
Damn right! Curse you for being a spec that isn't viable! /s
---
Yeah this. In vanilla it was accepted because the game was new most people were awful, everyone was playing on potatoes and it was just the norm.
---
It isn't the norm these days, hardware is capable of running raids and Internet isn't as unstable.
---
Being dead weight will get you kicked/blacklisted. It won't be the same as it once was. 
---
BFA?
---
If this is what classic is like I'll be so disappointed 
---
The only thing that really bothered me about these items was the shit guild I was in would force people to take them and it would cost DKP. These items were rarely an upgrade unless someone was in seriously shitty gear and even then they weren't worth the DKP. I had no remorse when I got enough gear and left that guild.
---
I'm waiting for the summer 2019 launch of classic mobile ^^^tm.      
---
      
---
"Did we not mention it's a phone game??  Do you not have phoens?"
---
it wouldnt be clasic wow without people pushing for changes and then trying to shut everyone who disagrees out. I'll leave when i want to. 
---
Thank you. Great reply, I find the blizzlike experience a very controversial one but agree with you it being an annoyance and not exactly part of the experience. The only thing that concerns me is how they go about removing this annoyance if they even do. In a perfect world I'd love for the classic wow engine and everything to just transition smoothly with no complications maybe some shakes at launch due to literally everyone being in one area but after that everything stabilizing and the servers being able to handle everything 100x better then back then. but if for some reason its just not possible and the only way to produce an environment where you dont have to wait at a big city or have a 5fps raids is sharding i personally would rather have things slow and annoying.
---
Man, remember when we were players and not heroes and champions??
---
Meme spec by itself is not the main reason. 
---
It's the combination of meme spec + bad player. Nobody really expects these specs to be in the top-10 or even top-15 DPS, but getting outDPSed by the tanks is cringe-worthy no matter how you look at it.
---
Popular and mainstream most definitely are not interchangeable when talking about entertainment. Take a look at music - metal is not mainstream at all, that does not mean there are no pupular metal bands.
---
Everquest was an extremely popular MMO. WoW made MMO's mainstream and of such changed what number might be considered popular, but that does not mean it goes back in history and "rewrite" everything. It does not delete the popularity that Everquest had for its time.
---
You're right, and I wish there was a better way for us to voice those criticisms directly to Blizzard, but at what point do those 2 main criticisms become stale here? Is it worth it to us as a community to bog down this forum with continuous posts about those issues at the cost of us seeing the same post for the 1000th time? If Blizzard hasn't noticed the complaints about sharding and looting at this point, will they ever?
---
Not as bad as people say. You will get wrecked for a while until you hit like level 20.  Once you can start doing dungeons and getting some blues you can stand on your own much better.
---
Did you take in consideration, that the behavior is much more enjoyable on RP-servers?  
---
That is my main reason to join such a server, besides that RP-play.
---
they actually said the first few months and they left what areas will be affected open-ended , starting zones doesnt the carry the same meaning to blizzard in 2019 
---
Wow that is terrible, was the DKP even discounted a little? That just sounds like a good way to get players looking for other guilds. Why not just give these items to the enchanters?
---
nah.
---
Meh, I'm not pushing for changes, but if you aren't planning on playing then your opinion isnt even invested in the issue.  
---
It wouldn't be Reddit without people spouting off opinions on matters that don't effect them.
---
&gt; hat would you divide by if it was a group of 3/4/5? Is it as simple as 3/4/5 :P
---
almost. In groups of 3 / 4 / 5 there's a slight bonus.
---
- Group of 3: Take base, multiply by 1.166 then divide by 3 for group.
---
- Group of 4: Take base, multiply by 1.3 then divide by 4 for group.
---
- Group of 5: Take base, multiply by 1.4 then divide by 5 for group.
---
Doesn't count for much in the end, the bonus is mostly negligible.
---
Imagine if we never complained about vanilla servers in the first place not existing? What if we never voiced our opinions about sharding once we noticed it in the demo and they thought it was fine as is and they would use it more sparingly in classic? These posts are absolute cancer to accomplishing what many were/are fighting for..
---
If you could convince me it's possible to RP that the Cataclysm never happened then I may give it a shot.  There's a particular ancient wood that I'd love to RP in as a Night Elf, unfortunately it's a Goblin highway now and it's infuriating.  With all the time travel gimmicks BFA has *eye twitch*, this may as well be possible.  But as I see it now, I'd rather be in a place I love with like minded people putting in more effort than have a bunch of toys and content that doesn't interest me.
---
Why? 
---
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision\_Blizzard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision_Blizzard)
---
Can work. Is slow. Is frowned upon. Harder to find group. Do it if you want to be special. Not worth it otherwise. 
---
It seems the general consensus on this sub to just attack blizzard before they have even done anything wrong. 
---
Blizzard have been open and honest about classic wow, which we are lucky to even get by the way.
---
Imagine getting something we have wanted for years and destroying it with our negativity, by the time classic actually releases I wouldn’t be surprised if blizzard decides the community doesn’t actually want it.
---
Wouldn't throwing two horn trinkets on a bear druid or moonkin druid that stacks armor be quite significant? 250 would turn into just under 1000 as far as I know. Have two or three moonkins wearing two of them in a single pvp group, and depending on how the proc buff worked you could be looking at a truly insane amount of damage mitigation...
---
Nah totally false dichotomy there. Vengeance Cleric sucks bawlz sure. That is true statement that can’t be contested. Only scrubs play clerics neway and being vengeance is triple threat bad ok?
---
But thre r other meme specs that can be decent if piloted skillfully. Melee hunter (NO PET, NO RANGED) comes to mind first n foremast. Can easily top dps meter on my 60 melee hunter when I run my friends thru etc n shit. Easy
---
these changes are not confirmed. im making points about a game i will play depending how it turns out. i dont see how im spouting off opinions on matters that don't affect me.
---
even if i was 100% not playing ive been playing wow since vanilla, and like to discuss my interests, even if it bothers you. 
---
&gt;piraya
---
do you mean pariah? 
---
&gt;trying to kill hype and lower expectations  
---
no, people just want the game to be as good as it can be. sharding and loot trading are things you should absolutely be loud about. and blizzard *has* turned into complete shit when you look at what it used to be, there's no question about it
---
Every time I hear that we shouldn't voice concerns/complaints early, I think of BfA
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgoqQ_ArQ_Y&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=472
---
That’s the thing about relating something to something though: You need something to relate the other spmething to
---
Maybe he means be a useful or a delicious papaya
---
The BFA prepatch removed 32bit, Classic was based on 7.3.5 which had 32bit support. Its something I can see blizzard removing anyway to keep it in line
---
It's refreshing to discuss those matters with someone who is actually sane. A few comments:
---
&gt; maybe some shakes at launch due to literally everyone being in one area
---
There will be lower fps at launch, and honestly we can't expect them to spend the resources just for a week of the games life. I totally agree, some sort of lower performance is acceptable here.
---
&gt;  only way to produce an environment where you dont have to wait at a big city or have a 5fps raids is sharding
---
As to this we don't have to guess. Sharding can certainly make it work, but it depends on how they configurate the shards. I'd dare say if they *don't* do shards it won't be blizzlike. Vanilla launch did not have anywhere near the amount of players that Classic launch will have, this is the whole reason why Blizzard is talking about sharding. Yes, fighting for mobs are part of a authentic vanilla launch experience, but it's a question of *how many fights for the mobs*. Assuming Blizzlike realm cap and about equal amount of people at each starting zone you get around 417 persons per starting zone. Even after the first few hours you might still see over 100 people camping one mob. Sharding as on retail would ruin it, but what if it was much more subtle? Maybe just shard into 2 instances to half it making it closer to Blizzlike for those that want that and more tolerable for people that just want to play vanilla.
---
With specs like Shadow being very strong in PVP, it'd be hard to balance it solely for PVE.
---
Same goes to Enhancement, Elemental, Feral and Balance. I hear cases of all these hybrid speccs being very capable in PVP, albeit not top tier, but still enjoyable to play because you can kill people.
---
You don't, but Blizzard does. I'm pretty sure the majority of their subs are in China at this point. 
---
What the hell did I just read?
---
Jeez luigi... please, keep your sexual escapades to yourself. I knew NE rpers were insatiable fiends, but my goodness... keep your “ancient wood” keep to the goldshire brothel!
---
Half of the ones now are just people trolling
---
Or he means be useful or a dangerous piranha 
---
If literally nobody needed it they would be disenchanted. The guild leadership though would decide who needed things though because they knew people would rather pass on gear that wasnt technically an upgrade. They would decide who needed something ultimately and would just force it to someone. It was their way of trying to get people in the raid to have better gear. I understand the thought process but some of these pieces are absolutely useless. It was also one of the few guilds on our server willing to take fresh 60s into raids. People used them as a stepping stone to learn fights, get a few pieces of gear and ultimately move on. I was a Prot Warrior and I only stayed until I had the gear from MC that I needed and had to leave for a new guild. They never progressed past razorgore in bwl because people kept leaving and they would backfill with newbies. They never thought to look at their leadership as the problem. 
---
You are misunderstanding the issue. People couldn't care less how you pay for your sub, it's the money to gold conversion that will ruin Classic. 
---
Unlike retail, Vanilla had a very different progression and economy. A lot of very strong items were gated behind gold, WoW tokens would thus remove this barrier. It would very much be like if you on WoW retail in Legion could just use WoW tokens to buy legendaries.
---
All companies are profit driven 
---
... Wait. So in china, the road between hellfire citadel and the dark portal in outland is paved with *BREAD?*
---
Theory*
---
gameplay, challenge, players interaction
---
I don't really care too much about this discussion, but...
---
&gt;And now you willingly want to go back to a time where you had to GUESS where your campfire would spawn?
---
Campfires would always spawn to the front-left of your character. An experienced player was absolutely able to place a campfire exactly where he wanted to given that the terrain wasn't obstructing standard placement, and even if it was obstructed there was further logic to its placement. It's funny because to me even just learning these sort of obscure mechanics was something that made the game more fun.
---
he's oom in 1 minute the way he burns it lol
---
If he wanted to manage mana for longer fights and have mana consumables he would output wayyy less DPS.
---
I think memes are becoming self aware.
---
This is going to be a very controversial opinion but one of the things I hate in all of WoW and mmos in general is RNG loot. The fact that character progress is tied up to a slot machine. You put in a lot of effort to do difficult content and your reward is the roll of a dice to see if an item is really for you. Retail is plagued with this crap with titan forging and not being able to really *cap* a character. I prefer a deterministic loot system to a random one.
---
I know why Blizz does it, keeping people from being capped by giving an indeterminate time until people can get the items they want. It does make the game a bit more "exciting" but it does feel similar to loot boxes in a way.
---
Yes loot dropping that you need is exciting but you have to weigh that against the times items dropped that no one needed. I would much prefer a mixed system with loot drops and badges/tokens exchange for bad drops so there is atleast some loot protection and you get the excitement of getting good roles.
---
This is all just my opinion though, I want no changes in classic (especially loot trading, that should not be added). I am just saying a system I prefer. Also I am aware that some people do raid purely for the experience but some people do it solely for the loot and prestige as well.
---
Hey look, it’s the slippery slope fallacy 
---
The thing about specs like this is that you are essentially saying to your raid "Please carry me so i can have fun". Some will be cool with it, some won't.
---
I remember being suspicious of other players all the time in vanilla, ninja looting was something to be feared. That's what made my friends list and my guild so very important, it's why you made friends with certain players and not with others.
---
There won’t be 32 bit support.
---
"I'm being an asshole and people said mean things to me"
---
They were the same level brackets 
---
its not that tech sucked, it just evolved faster
---
back then a 1000$ pc wouldnt be able to run many new games after 3 years, thus many people played with bad PCs, and since you could play everywhere but av/cities/raids with much lower requirements people would just live with it
---
today a 1000$ pc can run the newest shit after 6 years
---
It's much more like "we need to talk about sharding every minute of every day or Acti-Blizz may think we have *accepted* it." It doesn't matter what we *want.* All that matters is the minimum level of quality that we are willing to accept. By ceaselessly bitching and moaning we are sending the very clear message that this bullshit is not acceptable in any way, shape, or form.
---
Bought a bradygames guide a few months back for like $5. I think I jidt wanted good pooping material again
---
YOU SAY THAT BUT YOU CAN'T ERASE 14 YEARS OF PTSD
---
I hate guilds like these, they really put forward the sterotype of the "shadow cabal" of guild officers and leaders who are out to get the lower ranking members of a guild. This is why Blizz put personal loot only into WoW because they were listening to people who though the Cabal was real.
---
A lot of players really don't seem to understand that a guild wants to keep people and have a stable raid team so they do give loot out to everyone equally or at least the people who are more reliable.
---
&gt;We know how to make good games.
---
- Blizzard 2007-2018
---
You think you....
---
WTF y downvote?!?!?!!
---
Like I said it wouldn't be Reddit...
---
Also, loot trading is confirmed, since you missed that apparently.
---
You have an interesting defiition of what "being an asshole" means, but assholes usually do.
---
How’s t3 feral dps?
---
Intentionally making the game worse for other players doesn't make you an asshole according to you?
---
The last is one of the most immature statement I've ever read.
---
1- You must really think at blizzard like a donkey with a carrot on stick right at it's eyes. I don't wanna defend blizzard, but they should be able to understand from mistakes.
---
2- Token = pay2win is a silly equation: 1. a token must be sold, so it have to be buyed, but in classic it's hard to make golds, so not many people as in retail will be interested in it and the price will be impacted by it. 2. What's the difference from a token and share luck in drops? I mean, some people drop pricy epic boe, other not: the game is unfair because the system doesn't guarantee you a fixed reward after a fixed effort, you may kill 1000 mob without getting any epics, an other person may drop one with just 1 kill. Then a luky guy is game breaking? We need to address this issue too then. 3. The token it's not, in any way, worst than gold sellers, and vanilla, during all it's life, had that issue with it, so a true vanilla experience is one with gold sellers, so why not with the token that it's the same and legal thing?

Ps. Buying gold doesn't make my account more vulnerable, I can't say the same in a macro prospective on the whole community.

If you think that people didn't abuse the GM system you're dreaming.

Probably because you have 0 writing skills?

if you’re gonna be a meme spec like ret/enhance at least put in enough effort to out dps tanks. that’s pathetic, and you should be ashamed for thinking you came out of this exchange on top if you’re the ret. gj making it harder for those others who actually put in time and effort on their characters while you sat back and did virtually nothing for the sake of your own “fun”.

If that's true, then you should be in negative karma based on your /u/ alone.

As a PC gamer and fan of MMOs like Planetside and DaoC, WoW was MASSIVELY hyped in the years before its release. 
---
They had a great slow drip of information coming out about the game, as well as the alpha tests that had everybody raving. 
---
I remember being super bummed about not making it into the closed beta, but I was on the 1 week open beta as soon as I could.
---
Exactly. I think it's frigging rude to join as a dpser, do less dps than the tank and think that's okay because "fun". How about you have fun *and* pull your own weight like everybody else! 
---
I don't know what people expect tbh.

Meme specs are meme specs for a reason. They're not just "not topping the charts", they're that much worse they need to get carried. Why do people think they're entitled to getting carried by their raid? Sorry, but "Just play whatever you want" does not apply to group content where everyone has to do their job for the group to succeed. And as Ret or any other meme spec you're picking a spec that is ridiculously bad at their job. 
---
Not everything was better back then, please understand this. Of course it sucks when classes that are supposed to be hybrids (able to fulfil mutliple roles) are reduced to just healers in the most important content (by far) of the game, which is end game PvE. But that's just how Vanilla was. It had its flaws, and specs being non-viable for raiding was one if not the biggest of them, and it was NEVER intended to be that way. 
---
TBC did a way better job at making specs viable for the roles they are supposed to fill... and still without any homogenization. But that's not an option for Classic of course, and any balancing changes are extremely dangerous. I'm not arguing slippery slope here (because that's just a bullshit argument), I'm talking about direct impact. You see it in multiplayer games all the time, even small balancing changes can affect the meta and trying to make non-viable specs viable would be anything but a small balancing change.
---
So don't expect to raid as a meme spec in Classic. Unless you're planning on doing stuff that will allow you to let yourself get carried by your guild. 
---
I can't wait to see all the tears here when Classic launches and the threads start rolling about people minmaxing
---
look up skinner box conditioning my dude. that’s basically all this game really boils down to.

This idea or "change" is to accommodate blizzard since they said they were introducing tradeable loot to minimize tickets generated by mislooting. Tradeable dungeon loot is a massive change to the vanilla experience because it promotes friends rolling on loot they don't need and trading it to their buddy / guildy. Sure you can say you can call them out about doing it but when a high number of players do it (take a look at previous expansions in retail in dungeons / raids especially) it's more socially acceptable and there are no consequences. 
---
Sure you can argue to masterloot bosses but that is much more inconvenient to everyone compared to group loot and it can also make players feel uneasy if they don't know the party leader. Plus it's easier to misloot on ML compared to misclicking need or greed, so it's counterproductive in that regard. Blizzard can advise players that mislooted or misdirected items are not handled by GMs or the blizzard staff and to take higher caution when distributing or rolling on items. This accomplishes the directive blizzard wants with reduced tickets without actually making a core gameplay change and keeping loot mechanics exactly how they were in vanilla. Based on the general response that the vanilla community has had regarding loot trading I think it's fair to say that I speak for the majority when I say I'd rather have blizzard decline ticket generation for misloots than loot trading make it's way into classic.

NA. Cleric just sucka LOL
